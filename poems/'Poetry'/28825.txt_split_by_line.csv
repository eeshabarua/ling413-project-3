31,THE VERNER RAVEN,
32,THE VERNER RAVEN,
33,THE VERNER RAVEN,"The Raven he flies in the evening tide,"
34,THE VERNER RAVEN,He in day dares not intrude;
35,THE VERNER RAVEN,Whoever is born to have evil luck
36,THE VERNER RAVEN,In vain may seek for good.
37,THE VERNER RAVEN,
38,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Lustily flies the Verner Raven,"
39,THE VERNER RAVEN,"High o'er the wall he's flown,"
40,THE VERNER RAVEN,For he was aware that Irmindlin fair
41,THE VERNER RAVEN,Sate in her bower alone.
42,THE VERNER RAVEN,
43,THE VERNER RAVEN,"He southward flew, and he northward flew,"
44,THE VERNER RAVEN,He flew high up in the cloud;
45,THE VERNER RAVEN,And he beheld May Irmindlin
46,THE VERNER RAVEN,Who sorrowing sate and sew'd.
47,THE VERNER RAVEN,
48,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Now hear me, little Irmindlin,"
49,THE VERNER RAVEN,Why weep in this piteous way?
50,THE VERNER RAVEN,"For father or mother, or is it for brother,"
51,THE VERNER RAVEN,"That adown thy cheek tears stray?"""
52,THE VERNER RAVEN,
53,THE VERNER RAVEN,"It was Damsel Irmindlin,"
54,THE VERNER RAVEN,Swift out of the window looked she:
55,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""O who is he that will comfort me,"
56,THE VERNER RAVEN,And list to my misery?
57,THE VERNER RAVEN,
58,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Hear thou, wild Raven, bird of Death,"
59,THE VERNER RAVEN,Fly thou hither down to me;
60,THE VERNER RAVEN,And all my trouble and all my care
61,THE VERNER RAVEN,I'll straight relate to thee.
62,THE VERNER RAVEN,
63,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""My father gave me the son of a king,"
64,THE VERNER RAVEN,"We were fitted the one for the other,"
65,THE VERNER RAVEN,But he was into the Austrian land
66,THE VERNER RAVEN,Dispatched by my cruel step-mother.
67,THE VERNER RAVEN,
68,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""So happily we should together have lived,"
69,THE VERNER RAVEN,For he my whole love won;
70,THE VERNER RAVEN,"But she wished to give me her sister's son,"
71,THE VERNER RAVEN,Who was liker a fiend than a man.
72,THE VERNER RAVEN,
73,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""I had a gallant brother once,"
74,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Sir Verner by name was he,"
75,THE VERNER RAVEN,But he was transformed by my cruel step-dame
76,THE VERNER RAVEN,"And driven to a strange countrie."""
77,THE VERNER RAVEN,
78,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Hear thou, Damsel Irmindlin,"
79,THE VERNER RAVEN,"What wilt thou give me, say?"
80,THE VERNER RAVEN,"I'll carry thee straight to thy plighted youth,"
81,THE VERNER RAVEN,"If with me thou wilt fly away."""
82,THE VERNER RAVEN,
83,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Thou shalt from me the ruddy gold,"
84,THE VERNER RAVEN,And the silver white receive;
85,THE VERNER RAVEN,"If thou bear me to my Bridegroom bold,"
86,THE VERNER RAVEN,"And me from my woe relieve."""
87,THE VERNER RAVEN,
88,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Keep thou thyself thy silver and gold,"
89,THE VERNER RAVEN,Such gifts I do not crave;
90,THE VERNER RAVEN,"The first son thou conceivest of him,"
91,THE VERNER RAVEN,"That, that from thee I'll have."""
92,THE VERNER RAVEN,
93,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Then straight she took the Raven's foot,"
94,THE VERNER RAVEN,Laid that her white hand upon;
95,THE VERNER RAVEN,"She swore to him by her Christian faith,"
96,THE VERNER RAVEN,That he should have the son.
97,THE VERNER RAVEN,
98,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Then took he Damsel Irmindlin,"
99,THE VERNER RAVEN,He placed her on his back;
100,THE VERNER RAVEN,Then flew he over the wild sea waves
101,THE VERNER RAVEN,As fast as he could track.
102,THE VERNER RAVEN,
103,THE VERNER RAVEN,"It was the Verner Raven wild,"
104,THE VERNER RAVEN,On the turret he alighted:
105,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Now sit we, Damsel, upon the house,"
106,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Where dwells thy Bridegroom plighted."""
107,THE VERNER RAVEN,
108,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Out came bold Sir Nilaus,"
109,THE VERNER RAVEN,A silver cup in his hand:
110,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Be welcome, Damsel Irmindlin,"
111,THE VERNER RAVEN,Here to this foreign land!
112,THE VERNER RAVEN,
113,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""What shall I give to thee, Raven wild,"
114,THE VERNER RAVEN,That hast brought to me my Bride?
115,THE VERNER RAVEN,"No better tidings I have heard,"
116,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Since from Denmark forth I hied."""
117,THE VERNER RAVEN,
118,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Thanks be to brave Sir Nilaus,"
119,THE VERNER RAVEN,He kept his faith so well;
120,THE VERNER RAVEN,"The Monday next that followed,"
121,THE VERNER RAVEN,His bridal it befell.
122,THE VERNER RAVEN,
123,THE VERNER RAVEN,They their bridal solemnised
124,THE VERNER RAVEN,With glee and utmost joy;
125,THE VERNER RAVEN,When forty weeks away had flown
126,THE VERNER RAVEN,She brought into the world a boy.
127,THE VERNER RAVEN,
128,THE VERNER RAVEN,"It was the Verner Raven,"
129,THE VERNER RAVEN,Perched on the turret tall:
130,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""What thou did'st promise me, Irmindlin,"
131,THE VERNER RAVEN,"To thy mind I'd have thee call."""
132,THE VERNER RAVEN,
133,THE VERNER RAVEN,"So sorely she wept, and her hands she smote,"
134,THE VERNER RAVEN,Because it a girl was not:
135,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Thee shall the wild Death Raven have,"
136,THE VERNER RAVEN,"That will cost thee thy life, I wot!"""
137,THE VERNER RAVEN,
138,THE VERNER RAVEN,There came flying over the house
139,THE VERNER RAVEN,"The Raven, with looks to scare;"
140,THE VERNER RAVEN,"So sorely then wept both Maidens and Dames,"
141,THE VERNER RAVEN,And their hands wrung in despair.
142,THE VERNER RAVEN,
143,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Sir Nilaus went, and proffered the bird"
144,THE VERNER RAVEN,Proud castles many a one;
145,THE VERNER RAVEN,He proffered him even the half of his land
146,THE VERNER RAVEN,If he only might keep his son.
147,THE VERNER RAVEN,
148,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""If I get not the little babe,"
149,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Thou sorely shall rue it straight,"
150,THE VERNER RAVEN,Thee I limb from limb will tear
151,THE VERNER RAVEN,"And thy kingdom devastate."""
152,THE VERNER RAVEN,
153,THE VERNER RAVEN,"She has taken the babe, and in linen white"
154,THE VERNER RAVEN,Hath wrapped it tenderly;
155,THE VERNER RAVEN,"""Farewell, farewell, my dearest son,"
156,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Thou owest thy death to me."""
157,THE VERNER RAVEN,
158,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Then bore they out the little babe,"
159,THE VERNER RAVEN,On its mother's breast that lay;
160,THE VERNER RAVEN,"O'er the cheeks of all did big tears fall,"
161,THE VERNER RAVEN,Such woe was and wail that day.
162,THE VERNER RAVEN,
163,THE VERNER RAVEN,"The Raven took the child in his claw,"
164,THE VERNER RAVEN,He croaked in joyous guise;
165,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Sir Nilaus stood and looked thereon,"
166,THE VERNER RAVEN,Pouring forth bitter sighs.
167,THE VERNER RAVEN,
168,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Then tore he amain its right eye out,"
169,THE VERNER RAVEN,Drank the half of its heart's red blood;
170,THE VERNER RAVEN,Then he became the handsomest knight
171,THE VERNER RAVEN,That upon earth e'er stood.
172,THE VERNER RAVEN,
173,THE VERNER RAVEN,He changed into the loveliest knight
174,THE VERNER RAVEN,That with eye man ever had seen:
175,THE VERNER RAVEN,"It was Irmindlin's brother himself,"
176,THE VERNER RAVEN,Who had long enchanted been.
177,THE VERNER RAVEN,
178,THE VERNER RAVEN,"All the folk that stood thereby,"
179,THE VERNER RAVEN,They fell upon their knees bare;
180,THE VERNER RAVEN,And the child it was to life restored
181,THE VERNER RAVEN,When to God they had made their prayer.
182,THE VERNER RAVEN,
183,THE VERNER RAVEN,"Now sitteth Dame Irmindlin so glad,"
184,THE VERNER RAVEN,All her grief has from her hied;
185,THE VERNER RAVEN,"For she has now both brother and son,"
186,THE VERNER RAVEN,And sleeps by Sir Nilaus' side.

192,DAUGHTER,DAUGHTER
193,DAUGHTER,
194,DAUGHTER,
195,DAUGHTER,"Within a bower the womb I left,"
196,DAUGHTER,'Midst dames and maids who stood to aid;
197,DAUGHTER,"They wrapped me first in silken weft,"
198,DAUGHTER,And next in scarlet red array'd.
199,DAUGHTER,
200,DAUGHTER,"But a stepdame soon 'twas my lot to get,"
201,DAUGHTER,And fierce and wild she proved to me;
202,DAUGHTER,"Within a coffer me she set,"
203,DAUGHTER,And pushed it out upon the sea.
204,DAUGHTER,
205,DAUGHTER,"By one wave I was borne to land,"
206,DAUGHTER,And by the next away was ta'en;
207,DAUGHTER,"But God on High, it seems, had plann'd,"
208,DAUGHTER,That I should footing there obtain.
209,DAUGHTER,
210,DAUGHTER,"The tide it drove me to the shore,"
211,DAUGHTER,And in its backward course retook;
212,DAUGHTER,Sure ne'er had child of king before
213,DAUGHTER,Such buffeting on sea to brook.
214,DAUGHTER,
215,DAUGHTER,"But God He help'd me, so that I"
216,DAUGHTER,Was cast above the billows' reach;
217,DAUGHTER,"And soon a savage wolf drew nigh,"
218,DAUGHTER,Was prowling on the sandy beach.
219,DAUGHTER,
220,DAUGHTER,"Soon prowling came a wolf so gray,"
221,DAUGHTER,"And me up-taking in his jaws,"
222,DAUGHTER,He carried me with care away
223,DAUGHTER,"Deep, deep into the forest shaws."
224,DAUGHTER,
225,DAUGHTER,That self-same wolf he was so kind
226,DAUGHTER,That me beneath a tree he laid;
227,DAUGHTER,"And then came running a nimble hind,"
228,DAUGHTER,And me unto its lair convey'd.
229,DAUGHTER,
230,DAUGHTER,There me for winter one she nurs'd--
231,DAUGHTER,She nursed me for two winters' space.
232,DAUGHTER,"To creep, to creep, I learnt at first,"
233,DAUGHTER,"And next I learnt to pace, to pace."
234,DAUGHTER,
235,DAUGHTER,"And I was full eight years, I wot,"
236,DAUGHTER,"Within the quiet, green retreat."
237,DAUGHTER,Close couched beside the hind I got
238,DAUGHTER,Full many a slumber calm and sweet.
239,DAUGHTER,
240,DAUGHTER,"I had clothes and shelter of no kind,"
241,DAUGHTER,Except the linden green alone;
242,DAUGHTER,"And, save the gentle forest hind,"
243,DAUGHTER,Had nurse and foster-mother none.
244,DAUGHTER,
245,DAUGHTER,But forth on courser reeking hot
246,DAUGHTER,"There rushed a knight of bearing bold,"
247,DAUGHTER,And he my foster-mother shot
248,DAUGHTER,With arrow on the verdant wold.
249,DAUGHTER,
250,DAUGHTER,"He pierced the hind with mortal wound,"
251,DAUGHTER,And all our fond connection cut;
252,DAUGHTER,"Then wrapped his cloak my frame around,"
253,DAUGHTER,And me within his buckler put.
254,DAUGHTER,
255,DAUGHTER,"That self-same knight, so bold and strong,"
256,DAUGHTER,Within his bower the foundling bred;
257,DAUGHTER,"He tended me both well and long,"
258,DAUGHTER,And finally his bride he made.
259,DAUGHTER,
260,DAUGHTER,He had by long inquiry found
261,DAUGHTER,My father was a noble count
262,DAUGHTER,"In Vendel's land, who castles own'd,"
263,DAUGHTER,And rul'd o'er many a plain and mount.
264,DAUGHTER,
265,DAUGHTER,The first night we together slept
266,DAUGHTER,Was fraught with woe of darkest hue;
267,DAUGHTER,"Foes, whom he long at bay had kept,"
268,DAUGHTER,"Broke in on us, and him they slew."
269,DAUGHTER,
270,DAUGHTER,The night we lay together first
271,DAUGHTER,A deed of horror was fulfill'd;
272,DAUGHTER,"The bride-house door his foemen burst,"
273,DAUGHTER,And in my arms my husband kill'd.
274,DAUGHTER,
275,DAUGHTER,"Soon, soon, my friends to counsel go,"
276,DAUGHTER,A husband new they chose for me;
277,DAUGHTER,The cloister's prior of mitred brow--
278,DAUGHTER,The good Sir Nilaus styl'd was he.
279,DAUGHTER,
280,DAUGHTER,"But soon as I the threshold cross'd,"
281,DAUGHTER,The nuns could not their fury smother;
282,DAUGHTER,"They vow'd by God and all His Host,"
283,DAUGHTER,The Prior Nilaus was my brother.
284,DAUGHTER,
285,DAUGHTER,"Forth from the cloister him they drew,"
286,DAUGHTER,They pelted him to death with stones;
287,DAUGHTER,"I stood close by, and all could view,"
288,DAUGHTER,I scarce could hear his piteous moans.
289,DAUGHTER,
290,DAUGHTER,"Once more my friends to counsel hied,"
291,DAUGHTER,For me another spouse they get--
292,DAUGHTER,Son of the King of England wide
293,DAUGHTER,"Was he, and hight Sir Engelbret."
294,DAUGHTER,
295,DAUGHTER,Nine winters with that princely youth
296,DAUGHTER,"I lived; of joy we had no dearth,"
297,DAUGHTER,"I tell to ye, for sooth and truth,"
298,DAUGHTER,To ten fair sons that I gave birth.
299,DAUGHTER,
300,DAUGHTER,"But pirate crews the land beset,"
301,DAUGHTER,"No one, no one, my grief could tell;"
302,DAUGHTER,"They slew with sword Sir Engelbret,"
303,DAUGHTER,And nine of my fair sons as well.
304,DAUGHTER,
305,DAUGHTER,My husband and my sons with brand
306,DAUGHTER,They slew.  How I bewail their case!
307,DAUGHTER,My tenth son here they from the land--
308,DAUGHTER,I never more shall see his face.
309,DAUGHTER,
310,DAUGHTER,Now is my care as complicate
311,DAUGHTER,As golden threads which maidens spin;
312,DAUGHTER,"God crown with bliss Sir Engelbret,"
313,DAUGHTER,He ever was so free from sin.
314,DAUGHTER,
315,DAUGHTER,"But now I'll take the holy vows,"
316,DAUGHTER,Within the cloister under Ey;
317,DAUGHTER,"I'll ne'er become another's spouse,"
318,DAUGHTER,But in religion I will die.
319,DAUGHTER,
320,DAUGHTER,But first to all the country side
321,DAUGHTER,I will declare my bosom's grief;
322,DAUGHTER,"I find, the more my grief I hide,"
323,DAUGHTER,"The less, the less, is my relief."
324,DAUGHTER,
325,DAUGHTER,

328,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW
329,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
330,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
331,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"From his home and his country Sir Volmor should fare,"
332,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,His wife he commends to his mother's best care.
333,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
334,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Proud Lyborg she sang, as the dancers she watched,"
335,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Behind stood Dame Ingeborg, malice she hatched."
336,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
337,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""To live to the Fall if the luck I enjoy"
338,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Fair lady, thy beautiful voice I'll destroy."""
339,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
340,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Proud Lyborg's fair maidens upon the floor sprang,"
341,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,And all through the evening she unto them sang.
342,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
343,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"But alack two short summer days scarcely had pass'd,"
344,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,When in desperate sickness proud Lyborg lay fast.
345,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
346,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Proud Lyborg fell sick, and lay stretched on her bed,"
347,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Then backwards and forwards Dame Ingeborg sped.
348,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
349,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Now hear me, Dame Ingeborg, dear mother mine,"
350,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Do bring me, I pray, either water or wine."""
351,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
352,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""The water is frozen, and frozen the wine,"
353,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,And frozen the tap in each barrel of mine.
354,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
355,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""The door it is locked, and the keys are away,"
356,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"But where, daughter dear, by the Saints I can't say."""
357,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
358,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""If I can nor water nor wine from thee win,"
359,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Then open the door that the dew may rush in.
360,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
361,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Cause the door to the North to be wide open set,"
362,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Then my feverish frame cool refreshment shall get."""
363,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
364,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""The door to the South I'll have straightway undone,"
365,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"That the hot sun may flash in thy visage upon."""
366,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
367,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""O would there were one that for sweet pity's sake,"
368,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"To my mother a message in secret would take."""
369,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
370,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Then answer'd proud Lyborg's own little foot-boy:
371,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Your message in secret I'll carry with joy."""
372,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
373,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,That they were alone they with confidence thought;
374,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Dame Ingeborg stood nigh, and every word caught."
375,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
376,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"The lad he upsprang on his courser so high,"
377,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,He galloped as fast as the winged birds fly.
378,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
379,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"In, in came the lad, in a kirtle red drest:"
380,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Your daughter, Dame Lyborg, in death will soon rest."
381,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
382,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""She bids you to come with all possible quickness,"
383,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"To live through this night she can't hope from her sickness."""
384,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
385,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Straight unto her servants proud Mettelil says:
386,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""My horses go fetch from the meads where they graze."""
387,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
388,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"The horses they galloped, the chariot wheels turned,"
389,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Throughout the long day whilst the summer heat burned.
390,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
391,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,The midsummer's sun with such fury it glows
392,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Proud Lyborg swoons 'neath it in terrible throes.
393,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
394,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"A purse takes Dame Ingeborg fraught with gold treasure,"
395,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"And she speeds to the hall, her heart bounding with pleasure."
396,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
397,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Whosoever will gold and will bounty derive,"
398,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Let him help me to bury proud Lyborg alive."""
399,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
400,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Soon as she of the gold distribution had made,"
401,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Below the black earth the fair lily they laid.
402,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
403,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"To the gate of the castle proud Mettelil came,"
404,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Dame Ingeborg stood there, and leaned on the same."
405,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
406,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Proud Ingeborg, hear what I say unto thee:"
407,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"What hast done with my daughter? declare that to me!"""
408,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
409,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""But yesterday 'twas that with sorrowful mind,"
410,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Her corse to the arms of the grave we consign'd."""
411,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
412,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Proud Ingeborg, hush thee, nor talk in this guise,"
413,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"But show me the grave where my dear daughter lies."""
414,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
415,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"As soon as Dame Mettelil o'er the place trod,"
416,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Proud Lyborg she screamed underneath the green sod.
417,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
418,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Whoever will gold and will silver obtain,"
419,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Let him help me to dig now with might and with main."""
420,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
421,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"They took up proud Lyborg, all there as she lay,"
422,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,Her mother flung o'er her the scarlet array.
423,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
424,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"""Now tell to me, Lyborg, thou child of my heart,"
425,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,"Since restored to the arms of thy mother thou art,"
426,THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW,
