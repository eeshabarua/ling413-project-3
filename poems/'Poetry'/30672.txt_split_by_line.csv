82,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
83,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
84,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"Hazlitt says, one cannot ""make an allegory go on all fours,"" it must"
85,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"to a certain degree be obscure and shadowy, like the images which the"
86,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"traveller in the desert sees mirrored on the heavens, wherein he can"
87,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,trace but a dreamy resemblance to the reality beneath. It therefore
88,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"seems to me advisable to give a solution of the ""Eidolon,"" the symbol,"
89,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"which follows, that the purpose of the poem may at once be evident."
90,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
91,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"In ""Eidolon"" I have attempted to symbol the course of a Poet's mind"
92,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"from a state wherein thought is disordered, barren and uncultivated,"
93,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"to that which is ordered and swayed by the true Spirit of Poetry, and"
94,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,holds its perfect creed.
95,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
96,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"I have therefore laid the scene on a desert island, whence, as from"
97,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"the isolation of his own mind, he reflects upon the concerns of life."
98,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,At first he is a poet only by birthright '_Poeta nascitur_.' He has
99,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"the poet's inherent love for the Beautiful, his keen susceptibility of"
100,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"all that is lovely in outward nature, but these are only the blossoms"
101,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"which have fallen upon him from the Tree of Life, the fruit is yet"
102,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"untasted. He has looked at the evil of the world alone, and seeing how"
103,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"much ""the time is out of joint"" has become misanthropic, and turns his"
104,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,back alike on the evil and the good.
105,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
106,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"Then comes Night, the stillness of the soul, with starlight breaking"
107,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"through the gloom. He gazes on other worlds, and pictures there the"
108,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"perfection he sighs for, but cannot find in this. Thus by the"
109,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,conception of a higher and nobler existence acquiring some impetus
110,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,towards its realization.
111,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
112,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,We then find him lying in the sunshine with the beauties of Nature
113,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"around him, whose silent teaching works upon him till the true SPIRIT"
114,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"OF POETRY speaks _within his soul_, and combats the misanthropy and"
115,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"weakness of the sensuous MAN, showing him that Action is the end of"
116,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"Life, not mere indulgence in abstract and visionary rhapsodies."
117,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
118,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"In the next scene he makes further advances, for the spirit of Poetry"
119,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,shows him that the beauty for which he has sought amongst the stars of
120,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"heaven lies really at his feet; that Earth, too, is a star capable of"
121,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,equal brightness with those on which he gazes. He is thus brought from
122,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,the Ideal to the Real.
123,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
124,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,The fifth scene emblems the influence of Love on the soul. It is the
125,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"nurse of Poetry, and Sorrow is the pang which stimulates the divine"
126,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"germ into active vitality. Had he been entirely happy, and the course"
127,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"of his love run smooth, he would have been content to enjoy life in"
128,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,ease and idleness.
129,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
130,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"Next we find him looking broadly on life, on its utmost ills as well"
131,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"as its beauties, but not with the eye of the misanthrope, but of the"
132,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"Physician who searches out disease that he may find the remedy, and"
133,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,though the soul still sighs for the serenity and placid delight of
134,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"the ideal life, the world of Thought, the glorious principle of Poetry"
135,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"prevails, and he sacrifices self-ease, feeling that he has a nobler"
136,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"mission than to dream through life, and that here he must labour ere"
137,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,he can earn the right to rest.
138,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
139,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,Thus in the last scene the SPIRIT and the MAN have become one--he is
140,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,_truly_ a Poet. His prayer maintains the direct and divine inspiration
141,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,of the Poet-Priest.
142,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,
143,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,The action in short is the conflict of two principles within the
144,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,"breast, the False and the True, ending in the extinction of error"
145,INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.,and the triumph of truth.

158,MAN.,
159,MAN.,"How lonely were I in this solitude,"
160,MAN.,"This atom of creation which yon wave,"
161,MAN.,"White with the fury of a thousand years,"
162,MAN.,"Might gulf into oblivion, if the soul"
163,MAN.,Knew circumscription. Far as eye can reach
164,MAN.,"Around me lies a wild and watery waste,"
165,MAN.,With every billow sentinel to keep
166,MAN.,Its prisoner fetter'd to his ocean cell--
167,MAN.,What were it but a plunge--an instant strife--
168,MAN.,Then liberty snatch'd from the clutch of Death
169,MAN.,"The Tyrant, who with mystic terror grinds"
170,MAN.,"Men into slaves--But he who thinks _is_ free,"
171,MAN.,"And fineless as the unresting winds of heaven,"
172,MAN.,Now rushing with wild joy around the belt
173,MAN.,"Of whirling Saturn, then away through space"
174,MAN.,Till he and all his radiant brotherhood
175,MAN.,Dwindle to fire-flies round the brow of Night.
176,MAN.,"Thought is the great creator under God,"
177,MAN.,"Begotten of his breathing, that can raise"
178,MAN.,Shapes from the dust and give them Beauty's soul;
179,MAN.,"And though my empire be a continent,"
180,MAN.,"Squared down from leagues to inches, what of that?"
181,MAN.,The mind contains a world within its frame
182,MAN.,"Which Fancy peoples o'er with radiant forms,"
183,MAN.,Replete with life and spirit excellence.
184,MAN.,O! there is glory in the thought that now
185,MAN.,I stand absolved from all the chilling forms
186,MAN.,"And falsities of life, that like frail reeds"
187,MAN.,"Pierce the blind palms of those that lean on them,"
188,MAN.,And from the springs of my own being draw
189,MAN.,"All strength, and hope, and joyance, all that makes"
190,MAN.,"Lone meditations sweet, and schools the heart"
191,MAN.,For prophecy. In the o'erpeopled world
192,MAN.,"We seem like babes that cannot walk alone,"
193,MAN.,"But fasten on the skirts of other men,"
194,MAN.,"Their creeds, conclusions, and vain phantasies,"
195,MAN.,"Too languid, or too weak to poize ourselves;"
196,MAN.,"But here the crutch is shattered at a blow,"
197,MAN.,"Dependence made a thing for winds to blast,"
198,MAN.,And paraphrase in bitter mockery.
199,MAN.,
200,MAN.,"From this retreat, as from a cloister calm,"
201,MAN.,I dream upon the busy haunts of men
202,MAN.,"As things that touch me not. An empire riven,"
203,MAN.,"A monarchy o'erthrown, here seem to me"
204,MAN.,Importless as a foam-bell's death. The world
205,MAN.,And all its revolutions are now less
206,MAN.,"Within my chronicles, than is the ken"
207,MAN.,Of a star's orbit on the fines of space;
208,MAN.,But like a mariner saved from the wreck
209,MAN.,"On this calm spot I stand, unscathed, secure"
210,MAN.,"From the rough throbbings of the sea of strife,"
211,MAN.,"And woe, and clamour, wherewith this world's life"
212,MAN.,Ebbs and declines unto the printless shore
213,MAN.,"Of death. O! blessed change, if there were one"
214,MAN.,"To love me in this solitude, and make"
215,MAN.,Life beautiful. My soul is wearied out
216,MAN.,"With earth's fierce warfare, and its selfish ease;"
217,MAN.,The slights and coldness of the hollow crowds
218,MAN.,"That are its arbiters; the changeful face,"
219,MAN.,"The upstart arrogance of base-born fools,"
220,MAN.,"Who crown them with their golden dross, and deem"
221,MAN.,_That_ the all-potent badge of sovereignty.
222,MAN.,
223,MAN.,"O thou, my heart! hast thou not framed for life"
224,MAN.,"A golden palace in all solitude,"
225,MAN.,Whither the strains of quiet melodies
226,MAN.,"Float on the breath of memory, like songs"
227,MAN.,"From the dim bosom of the evening woods,"
228,MAN.,Peopling its chambers with sweet poesy?
229,MAN.,Hast thou not called the sunshine from the morn
230,MAN.,"To circle thee with a pure spirit life,"
231,MAN.,And with the softness of its tender arms
232,MAN.,Clasp thee in the embrace of heav'nly love?
233,MAN.,"Hast thou not heard the music of the stars,"
234,MAN.,"In the calm stillness of the summer night,"
235,MAN.,"And read their jewell'd pages o'er and o'er,"
236,MAN.,"Like the bright inspirations of a bard,"
237,MAN.,Till glowing strophes rung within thy soul
238,MAN.,Of glad Orion and clear Pleiades?
239,MAN.,Hast thou not seen the silv'ry moonshine thrill
240,MAN.,"Upon the dusky mantle of the night,"
241,MAN.,"Like radiant glances through a maiden's veil,"
242,MAN.,Till shaken thence they fell in a pure shower
243,MAN.,"O'er flood and field and bosky wilderness,"
244,MAN.,Wreathing earth with the glory of a saint?
245,MAN.,
246,MAN.,"O! thus to dwell far from the stir of life,"
247,MAN.,"Far from its pleasures and its miseries,"
248,MAN.,"Far from the panting cry of man's desire,"
249,MAN.,"That waileth upward in hoarse discontent,"
250,MAN.,And here to list but to that liquid voice
251,MAN.,"That riseth in the spirit, and whose flow"
252,MAN.,Is like a rivulet from Paradise--
253,MAN.,To hear the wanderings of divine thought
254,MAN.,"Within the soul, like the low ebb and flow"
255,MAN.,"Of waters in the blue-deep ocean caves,"
256,MAN.,Forming itself a speech and melody
257,MAN.,Sweeter than words unto the aching sense--
258,MAN.,To stand alone with Nature where man's step
259,MAN.,"Hath never bowed a grass-blade 'neath its weight,"
260,MAN.,Nor hath the sound of his rude utterance
261,MAN.,Broken the pauses of the wild-bird's song;
262,MAN.,And thus in its unpeopled solitude
263,MAN.,"To be the spirit of this universe,"
264,MAN.,"Centering thought and reason in one frame,"
265,MAN.,"And in the majesty of quenchless soul,"
266,MAN.,"Rising unto the stature of a man,"
267,MAN.,"_That_ is to make life glorious and great,"
268,MAN.,"Dissolving matter in the spiritual,"
269,MAN.,As the green pine dissolveth into flame;
270,MAN.,Not on the breath of popular applause
271,MAN.,That is the spectre of all nothingness;
272,MAN.,"Not on the fawning of a servile crew,"
273,MAN.,"Who kiss the hem of fortune's purple robe,"
274,MAN.,"And lick the dust before prosperity,"
275,MAN.,"Waiting the cogging of the downward scale,"
276,MAN.,To turn from slaves to bravos in the dark;
277,MAN.,"Not on the favours of the politic,"
278,MAN.,"Who in the smile of honour, Persian-like,"
279,MAN.,"Pamper the pampered from their banquet halls,"
280,MAN.,"But to his starving cry, when fortune frowns,"
281,MAN.,Mutter their falsehoods through the bolted gate;
282,MAN.,"But in the brightness of the inner soul,"
283,MAN.,"The placitude of peace and holy thought,"
284,MAN.,"The joyous lightness of the spirit's wings,"
285,MAN.,Sweeping with equal strokes the azure sky
286,MAN.,"Of Present, Past, and wide Futurity;"
287,MAN.,"In the high tidemarks on the sands of life,"
288,MAN.,"Where thought hath swept her purifying wave,"
289,MAN.,Bearing the treasures of the unsearched deep
290,MAN.,To swell the riches of humanity.
291,MAN.,_That_ is a happiness apart from man
292,MAN.,"To aid, to sympathise with, or destroy;"
293,MAN.,In its calm solitude alike secure
294,MAN.,"From the broad adulation of the weak,"
295,MAN.,"And the strained condescension of the great,"
296,MAN.,"Both insults to the mighty soul within,"
297,MAN.,That is not prized but for its golden shrine.
298,MAN.,Here there is that which makes the spirit free
299,MAN.,"And noble in the measure of its strength,"
300,MAN.,Untrammelled by conventionalities
301,MAN.,That make the very light of heaven take worth
302,MAN.,According to the casement it shines through.
303,MAN.,
304,MAN.,O solitude! thy blessed power hath swept
305,MAN.,All earthly passions from my soul like weeds
306,MAN.,That choke the issues of eternal love.
307,MAN.,What now to me are hatred and revenge?
308,MAN.,Thoughts that if fleeting through the mind would fall
309,MAN.,"Like unknown birds upon a foreign shore,"
310,MAN.,"Strange, wonderful; where no false hearts are nigh"
311,MAN.,To poison life with variance and strife.
312,MAN.,O holy Nature! thou art only love
313,MAN.,"And peace and universal unity,"
314,MAN.,From thy sweet bosom springeth up no seed
315,MAN.,"Of bitterness and sorrow, that like thorns"
316,MAN.,"Cling to the vesture of mortality,"
317,MAN.,Piercing the spirit through with cruel woe.
318,MAN.,"With thee my soul could dwell for evermore,"
319,MAN.,"Expanding all good feelings day by day,"
320,MAN.,"Till, at the last, like roses in full bloom"
321,MAN.,The blossoms fall from pure maturity.
322,MAN.,Pride! Here no scale of inches is set up
323,MAN.,"For man to strain his littleness against,"
324,MAN.,"But o'er me hangs the majesty of heaven,"
325,MAN.,Bright with the glory of the noontide sun;
326,MAN.,"Beneath, the Earth, that whispers ""Thou art dust,"
327,MAN.,"""Gat like a child forth from my fertile womb,"
328,MAN.,"""And bone of my bone, thus, flesh of my flesh!"""
329,MAN.,Thou glorious firmament that like God's love
330,MAN.,"Enfoldest all creation utterly,"
331,MAN.,Making the pathway of the wheeling spheres
332,MAN.,"A splendour, and a triumph, and a joy,"
333,MAN.,That on the brightness of thine azure breast
334,MAN.,"Settest the constellated stars like gems,"
335,MAN.,To flash the glory of thy loveliness
336,MAN.,Through all the fulness of unmeasured space.
337,MAN.,Can madness in its raving cast a thought
338,MAN.,"To soar unto thy blessed perfectness,"
339,MAN.,Nor stand subdued with reverence and awe
340,MAN.,In contemplation of the Infinite?
341,MAN.,O Earth! thou Mother and true Monitress!
342,MAN.,Can thy frail children close their ears for aye
343,MAN.,'Gainst the deep-hearted warnings of thy voice?
344,MAN.,In the wild whirl of life the tones may die
345,MAN.,"Amid the clangour of contending foes,"
346,MAN.,"But here, as in the stillness of the night,"
347,MAN.,Thy solemn teaching falleth on the soul
348,MAN.,To the vibration of the low heart-beat.
349,MAN.,Then what is there to charm me back to life?
350,MAN.,"To wrestle with the guilty and the vain,"
351,MAN.,And lose identity amid the crowd
352,MAN.,Who struggle onward after base desire.
353,MAN.,This quiet scene doth teach me how to weigh
354,MAN.,Your pleasures and your vanities aright;
355,MAN.,To hold as dross the honour that is flung
356,MAN.,"Around man like a winter covering,"
357,MAN.,"Which the same hand can pluck away again,"
358,MAN.,And leave the outcast shivering in the blast.
359,MAN.,"There is no honour saving that within,"
360,MAN.,"Which none, nor man, nor Death itself can snatch,"
361,MAN.,But which falls from the spirit in its flight
362,MAN.,Like a prophetic mantle upon Time.
363,MAN.,
364,MAN.,Pleasure! O World! in thine insanity
365,MAN.,"Thou sinkest Soul into a poor buffoon,"
366,MAN.,Garbëd in tinsel and false ornament
367,MAN.,"To play its antics on the stage of life,"
368,MAN.,A thing for fools to laugh at in their mirth.
369,MAN.,Thou sat'st thy lust upon the sapless husks
370,MAN.,"That strew the highways of this pilgrimage,"
371,MAN.,"Closing thine eyes unto their emptiness,"
372,MAN.,And out of folly turning sour to sweet.
373,MAN.,Hast thou the joy that nature's converse sheds
374,MAN.,Thro' all the pulses of the quiet soul?
375,MAN.,The gentle calm that like a whispered song
376,MAN.,Steals o'er the sense with sweetest languishment?
377,MAN.,"Hast thou the magic of the Beautiful,"
378,MAN.,"Wreathing about thy spirit evermore,"
379,MAN.,In sunshine and in shadow; when the stars
380,MAN.,"Gather around the azure dome of heaven,"
381,MAN.,And the pale moon glides like a virgin bride
382,MAN.,Humbly behind the footsteps of her love:
383,MAN.,When the sweet morn dawns on the sleeping world
384,MAN.,To bring reality to visions bright;
385,MAN.,And on the curtain of dissolving mist
386,MAN.,Arches the many-tinted sign of heaven?
387,MAN.,"Hast thou the minstrelsie of the wild woods,"
388,MAN.,"Clear-tided strains floating along the sky,"
389,MAN.,"Swelling, subsiding, like a silvery sea"
390,MAN.,Beneath the dulcet breathing of the south?
391,MAN.,Hast thou that essence of all joyousness--
392,MAN.,The glorious independence of the soul--
393,MAN.,"That spurneth man's usurpëd tyranny,"
394,MAN.,"The power of wealth, and hapless circumstance,"
395,MAN.,"And, sweeping on its own unaided wings,"
396,MAN.,Measures the circuit of the boundless sky?
397,MAN.,"What is thy wealth, that fadeth in the use,"
398,MAN.,"And all the pomp and vanity it buys,"
399,MAN.,"To the rich treasure of undying thought,"
400,MAN.,"Encreasing evermore, till like a dower"
401,MAN.,It benizon humanity for aye?
402,MAN.,All thy poor gold resolveth into dust
403,MAN.,Before the test of such a scene as this:
404,MAN.,Can it charm forth the blossom of a flower
405,MAN.,Ere summer bids it with her gentle smile?
406,MAN.,Can it restore the verdure to the leaf
407,MAN.,When yellow Autumn marks it for her own?
408,MAN.,"Or, in the noontide bid the dew-shower rise"
409,MAN.,To fill one rosy chalice to the brim?
410,MAN.,"Go! gild thee with it, worldling, as thou wilt,"
411,MAN.,Yet all thy pains will leave thee but a fool!
412,MAN.,
413,MAN.,Ay! there is love to beckon me away
414,MAN.,"And lead me to a fountain of delight,"
415,MAN.,"Gliding before me in its purity,"
416,MAN.,Like some bright angel guiding souls to heaven.
417,MAN.,"O Love! have I not drained thee to the dregs,"
418,MAN.,Thy pleasures and thy sorrows equally;
419,MAN.,Clinging unto thee as the Arab doth
420,MAN.,To his low fountain in the wilderness?
421,MAN.,Have I not gazed into thy tender eyes
422,MAN.,"And read the secret of thy holiness,"
423,MAN.,"Cleansing my soul in humbleness and faith,"
424,MAN.,To shrine thee in thy fulness evermore?
425,MAN.,Have I not clasped thee in my frenzied arms
426,MAN.,"And heard thy heart-beats answer back to mine,"
427,MAN.,Fainter and fainter till the deep voice stilled
428,MAN.,In the eternal silence of the grave?
429,MAN.,O be to me henceforth but some sweet dream
430,MAN.,Illumining the sky of Memory:
431,MAN.,A fixëd star of everlasting light
432,MAN.,"To pilot me along the sea of life,"
433,MAN.,And keep the bearings of the spirit true.
434,MAN.,"Visit me in imagination's train,"
435,MAN.,"The sweetest and the fairest child of Thought,"
436,MAN.,"Till thro' my being, as thro' columned aisles"
437,MAN.,"When incense from the altar upward wreaths,"
438,MAN.,There float the fragrance of thy breath divine.
439,MAN.,Circle my soul in its far wanderings
440,MAN.,"Thro' spirit lands and empyrean heights,"
441,MAN.,"Where though it sink in wide bewilderment,"
442,MAN.,"Thou wilt enfold it in thy dewy arms,"
443,MAN.,And pillow it to strength and fearlessness!
444,MAN.,"Be to me like a heaven beyond all Time,"
445,MAN.,"Dreamt of, and worshipped in this pilgrimage--"
446,MAN.,"The habitation of all pure desire,"
447,MAN.,"Solace of sorrow, and the home of rest,"
448,MAN.,"Where I may lay me from life's troublous way,"
449,MAN.,And feel Eternity rise in my soul!
450,MAN.,"No, World! the cords that bound me unto thee"
451,MAN.,"Are snapt in sunder ne'er to join again,"
452,MAN.,"Thy voice is waning fainter on mine ear,"
453,MAN.,And thine allurements powerless and vain.
454,MAN.,"There springeth up within me a new want,"
455,MAN.,"A perfect yearning for the spiritual,"
456,MAN.,That shaketh from its pinions all the cares
457,MAN.,"And interests of earth, like cleaving dust"
458,MAN.,That clogs its upward winging to the skies.
459,MAN.,"Wend onward, as thou wilt in weal or woe,"
460,MAN.,"Swell the rude triumph of thy battle march,"
461,MAN.,"Spread thy gay banners broadly to the wind,"
462,MAN.,And let thy clarions ring among the spheres;
463,MAN.,"Laurel thy heroes and thy favourites,"
464,MAN.,And pluck the crowns again from off their brows;
465,MAN.,"Worship thy follies, and thine empty gains,"
466,MAN.,And barter life for mammon--gold for dross.
467,MAN.,"Here let me lie upon the rear of Time,"
468,MAN.,"Unheeded, unremembered, and alone,"
469,MAN.,"Like a quick seed dropt by a flying dove,"
470,MAN.,That groweth unto blossom and to fruit!
471,MAN.,
472,MAN.,
473,MAN.,SCENE. _Night._
474,MAN.,
475,MAN.,MAN.
476,MAN.,
477,MAN.,How still are all things now in earth and heaven!
478,MAN.,From the green-tided woods no rippling stir
479,MAN.,Breaks on the shore of silence; the sweet birds
480,MAN.,"That sing, like naiads from the crystal deeps,"
481,MAN.,"Amid the murmurous coverts, now are mute"
482,MAN.,"As dreams of faded happiness, and life"
483,MAN.,Seems calmly slumb'ring in the arms of death.
484,MAN.,"The far waves alone are rocking in unrest,"
485,MAN.,"With moonlight flashing o'er them, but their sound"
486,MAN.,"Dies in their own wild bosom, like a song"
487,MAN.,Murmuring in the spirit of a man.
488,MAN.,Thus is a poet's soul!--around it hangs
489,MAN.,"The darkness of this world's reality,"
490,MAN.,Its cares and struggles and necessities;
491,MAN.,But in its firmament for ever shines
492,MAN.,"The starlight of divine imaginings,"
493,MAN.,"Shedding upon the waves of restless feeling,"
494,MAN.,"And aspirations for the undefined,"
495,MAN.,The glory of a cloudless hemisphere.
496,MAN.,
497,MAN.,"O Stars! that gaze upon me from on high,"
498,MAN.,"Like angels from the gates of Paradise,"
499,MAN.,That weave your myriads in a golden chain
500,MAN.,"To bind creation with the Beautiful,"
501,MAN.,As locks are interrun with precious gems
502,MAN.,To deck a queen out for her royalty:
503,MAN.,"Hear me, ye bright ones, for a poet's love,"
504,MAN.,"And let light fall upon my swelling soul,"
505,MAN.,To crest each rising thought with purity!
506,MAN.,"There was a time--in youth, ere yet the sands"
507,MAN.,"Of life clogged 'neath satiety, but ran"
508,MAN.,Lighter than blithe rills down a mountain's side;
509,MAN.,"There was a time, when in my soul a voice"
510,MAN.,"Rang faintly like a huntsman's horn afar,"
511,MAN.,"Sounding along a forest; and I arose,"
512,MAN.,"And listed, as the bounding Antelope"
513,MAN.,Starts at the echo of a falling bough.
514,MAN.,"Louder it grew, and clearer--""Search for it!"""
515,MAN.,"What?--It melted from me, but the voice still came."
516,MAN.,"Then up I gat, and to the pressing world"
517,MAN.,"Sped on the wings of passion, striving on"
518,MAN.,"Thro' pleasure and thro' pain, alike unchecked."
519,MAN.,"Then, what were lets to me? Amongst the strong"
520,MAN.,I wrestled for ambition's upper seats--
521,MAN.,Clung to the slippery shrouds of policy--
522,MAN.,And in my fury prayed for eagle's wings
523,MAN.,To poize me in the shadow of the sun.
524,MAN.,At wealth I grasped as a poor crippled wretch
525,MAN.,Grasps at the crutch that steadies him along;
526,MAN.,"Yet not for it but for the power it brought,"
527,MAN.,"For, Timon-like, within my heart of hearts"
528,MAN.,I cursed the yellow dust I trampled on.
529,MAN.,But by the wayside I sat down and wept
530,MAN.,As a child weeps above some shattered toy.
531,MAN.,Oh Misery! to climb the steep of life
532,MAN.,Led by a phantom without form or truth--
533,MAN.,To find reality still rising up
534,MAN.,To crush hope's fabrics with relentless force.
535,MAN.,"All was a fiction, but the voice said ""Search!"""
536,MAN.,"And glory flashed before me like a wisp,"
537,MAN.,"Dazzling me on to bloodshed, and to strife."
538,MAN.,
539,MAN.,"Upon the field I stood with Victory,"
540,MAN.,And Death in all its ghastliness--Around
541,MAN.,The dim watchfires stood like a burning wall
542,MAN.,Betwixt the dead and living. On that night
543,MAN.,"Ye saw me, ye pure ministers of heaven,--"
544,MAN.,Shone on my anguish and my bitter tears.
545,MAN.,"Then, when the mangled forms of fellow-men,"
546,MAN.,"With hideous passion stiff upon their lips,"
547,MAN.,Blanch'd 'neath the twilight of your glimmering!
548,MAN.,Oh! there lay one beside me--a mere youth--
549,MAN.,Whose dying hands had pressed unto his lips
550,MAN.,"A long fair tress, through which his dying sigh"
551,MAN.,"Crept, as in happier days perchance did love's."
552,MAN.,"Witness, ye stars, of my abasement then,"
553,MAN.,"Judged and condemned by that poor lover's pledge,"
554,MAN.,"Lying there like a messenger of heaven,"
555,MAN.,"Breathing of peace and love, mid deadly hate."
556,MAN.,"Glory! thou mirage on this desert life,"
557,MAN.,Charming the weary on to water springs
558,MAN.,That shrivel up to barrenness ere reach'd!
559,MAN.,Thou shadow of a shadow that departs
560,MAN.,As the eye scans its bodiless outlines!
561,MAN.,Thou golden-imaged Ruin and Despair!
562,MAN.,"When this earth cracks, like a poor blasted rock,"
563,MAN.,"Before the burning of Almighty wrath,"
564,MAN.,Thy pallid spectre shall rise up to judge
565,MAN.,The wretched victims that did trust in thee!
566,MAN.,
567,MAN.,"""O Heaven!"" I said, ""lead me to love and peace;"
568,MAN.,"Love, that makes all things calm and beautiful,"
569,MAN.,"And like the sun, e'en in its setting, flings"
570,MAN.,A glory o'er the cloudy peaks of Time.
571,MAN.,"Peace--that doth hush the throbbing voice of life,"
572,MAN.,"Till through the stillness of the Poet's soul,"
573,MAN.,The echoes of Seraphic harmonies
574,MAN.,"Float like a spirit through the blue eterne."""
575,MAN.,"I said--""I will sit neath the ancient woods,"
576,MAN.,And list unto the voices of the winds
577,MAN.,"Coming from far o'er spirit lands, and full"
578,MAN.,"With stolen snatches of their utterance."""
579,MAN.,"I said--""I will lay bare my soul unto the sun,"
580,MAN.,And let its glory rest there till it charm
581,MAN.,"Forth from its womb, as flowers from the cold ground,"
582,MAN.,All lovely thoughts and high imaginings
583,MAN.,That shed sweet perfume o'er the waste of life.
584,MAN.,And when the sickle of autumnal time
585,MAN.,"Gathereth in the harvest of ripe thought,"
586,MAN.,"Nourish and strengthen long futurity."""
587,MAN.,
588,MAN.,Then as an eagle fleeth to his crag
589,MAN.,"High in the stillness of the dim cloudland,"
590,MAN.,"Fled I from man into the trackless woods,"
591,MAN.,To sate my soul with quietude and song.
592,MAN.,"Then, too, ye saw me, ye pure orbs of heaven,"
593,MAN.,And sent your blessed radiance to my heart
594,MAN.,In the still twilight of my calm content!
595,MAN.,Then came an answer to the unseen voice--
596,MAN.,"""O holy calmness of the inner soul!"
597,MAN.,Treasure of treasures! sweetness of all sense!
598,MAN.,Athwart the smoothness of whose liquid tide
599,MAN.,"Floateth the spirit of eternal love,"
600,MAN.,Tracing a pathway to the All-Divine!
601,MAN.,"Thine is the perfectness of earthly bliss,"
602,MAN.,"The brimming of life's chalice o'er with peace,"
603,MAN.,"Till thro' all thought and feeling, the pure draught"
604,MAN.,Sheddeth its gladness and serenity.
605,MAN.,"Thine is a joyance passing utterance,"
606,MAN.,"A deep delight, that like the songs of heaven,"
607,MAN.,"Swell through its fulness, but are mute without."
608,MAN.,"Thou art the goal of most sublime desire,"
609,MAN.,"The haven that all longing seeketh for,"
610,MAN.,"Where, shaded from the storms and blasts of life,"
611,MAN.,"The bark glides gently down the stream of Time."""
612,MAN.,
613,MAN.,How cloudless is this azure firmament!
614,MAN.,Brighter than all the dreams of sinless youth!
615,MAN.,Deeper than the deep heart of woman's love!
616,MAN.,"Now as I gaze upon each shining star,"
617,MAN.,"What visions steal upon me with its rays,"
618,MAN.,Of that which makes its glorious excellence!
619,MAN.,Can there be revelation of high truths
620,MAN.,"But through the channels of weak sense alone,"
621,MAN.,Thus like a fountain filt'ring thro' the clay.
622,MAN.,Or doth the soul hold converse spiritual
623,MAN.,"With powers unseen that fill the universe,"
624,MAN.,"Receiving, as by intuition, things"
625,MAN.,That man attains not by intelligence?
626,MAN.,"Is not the spirit perfect in itself,"
627,MAN.,Unmingled with the base alloy of earth
628,MAN.,That prisons it within this narrow sphere?
629,MAN.,"Hath it not apprehension natural,"
630,MAN.,"Attributive as immortality,"
631,MAN.,Unshackled by an organ that will die
632,MAN.,Beneath the friction of a few short years?
633,MAN.,"O there is blindness on us in this life,"
634,MAN.,"That seeth not the things which lie around,"
635,MAN.,E'en in the circuit of our littleness!
636,MAN.,"But death will loose the scales from off our eyes,"
637,MAN.,And smite our fleshly dwelling place in twain;
638,MAN.,"Freeing the spirit, till with joyous wings"
639,MAN.,It cleave the limits of immensity.
640,MAN.,"Yet _now_ the soul will shake its fetters off,"
641,MAN.,"And yearn unto the freedom of the skies,"
642,MAN.,Like a poor bird whose life is liberty.
643,MAN.,
644,MAN.,"Yon star, methinks, must be a glorious world,"
645,MAN.,Where Nature hath a spiritual life
646,MAN.,"And bloometh on in Spring perpetual,"
647,MAN.,Unsatiating in its loveliness.
648,MAN.,Verdure of herb and leafy plenitude
649,MAN.,"Spread o'er it like a vesture, and the glow"
650,MAN.,"Of sunlit waters smiling from afar,"
651,MAN.,"Half as in fancy, half reality."
652,MAN.,The skies above it glassy and serene
653,MAN.,"As the reflection of its own repose,"
654,MAN.,And every new alternation of the light
655,MAN.,Shedding new beauties on the scene below.
656,MAN.,"Thus far in fashion, kin to Earth as Time"
657,MAN.,"Beareth the impress of Eternity,"
658,MAN.,But differing henceforth as the gentle dove
659,MAN.,Doth from the vulture on its carrion:
660,MAN.,The dwellers on this paradisal sphere
661,MAN.,"Methinks, must be of glorious lineament,"
662,MAN.,"Clad with the brightness of eternal youth,"
663,MAN.,And buoyant with internal blessedness.
664,MAN.,"Spirits that shining with untarnished light,"
665,MAN.,"Radiate, and make matter luminous,"
666,MAN.,"Filling the eyes with sweet felicity,"
667,MAN.,"And love, and peace, and all emotions pure."
668,MAN.,"No sorrow there to make the vision dim,"
669,MAN.,And wash the mellow ripeness from the cheek;
670,MAN.,"No guilty deed to brand the heart with shame,"
671,MAN.,And write its direful sentence on the brow;
672,MAN.,"No rankling venom struggling through the veins,"
673,MAN.,"And blasting all the kindliness within,"
674,MAN.,"Till like a torrent bursting o'er restraint,"
675,MAN.,It spread its desolation on mankind;
676,MAN.,"But a pure regnant holiness and love,"
677,MAN.,Directing impulse with most queenly sway
678,MAN.,To ends of tenderness and charity;
679,MAN.,A nature purified by fellowship
680,MAN.,"With angels and bright ministers of Heaven,"
681,MAN.,That wander thither from their homes above
682,MAN.,On missions of benignity and grace.
683,MAN.,"And in this pleasaunce, as by holy need,"
684,MAN.,"There reigneth deep communion of soul,"
685,MAN.,That frameth as it were one atmosphere
686,MAN.,"Of joy, and hope, and blessedness for all;"
687,MAN.,No selfish pleasures fluttering before
688,MAN.,"To woo satanic emulation forth,"
689,MAN.,"But all combining for one common weal,"
690,MAN.,Moved still by sympathetic influence.
691,MAN.,
692,MAN.,"How passing beautiful must they not be,"
693,MAN.,"Thus dower'd with Virtue's highest attributes,"
694,MAN.,That from the spiritual springeth up
695,MAN.,A living fount of light and loveliness.
696,MAN.,"Soul is the life of Beauty, as the sun"
697,MAN.,Is of the universe it luminates.
698,MAN.,"O what were matter, fashioned ne'er so fair,"
699,MAN.,But for the beaming of that quenchless light
700,MAN.,"That plays around it, like the radiance"
701,MAN.,Of heaven's own glory stamped upon its work?
702,MAN.,What were the charm of the soft arching brow
703,MAN.,White as the snow-flake 'neath its golden braid?
704,MAN.,What were the dimpled cheek with roseate shades
705,MAN.,"Spread o'er it like the budding of a flower,"
706,MAN.,"The lips' ripe crimson, and the melting eye,"
707,MAN.,"Unbrightened by the sunshine from within,"
708,MAN.,"The emanations of seraphic thought,"
709,MAN.,"And full emotion, kindling into life"
710,MAN.,"Light, grace, the temple that they glorify?"
711,MAN.,Oh Death! when thou dost bear the soul away
712,MAN.,The charm is shattered--the illusion gone!
713,MAN.,"Ay, they are beautiful, and as bright forms"
714,MAN.,"Make fair the mirrors that they image in,"
715,MAN.,So are their courses glorious and glad.
716,MAN.,Still doth their swelling harmony ascend
717,MAN.,"In thrilling cadence to the gates of heaven,"
718,MAN.,"Making the air about them sweet with joy,"
719,MAN.,As summer's breath with floral incense fumes;
720,MAN.,"And every echo learns the words of love,"
721,MAN.,"And wonders at its sweet deliciousness,"
722,MAN.,Repeating o'er and o'er the honied tones
723,MAN.,Till they infuse into their secret souls.
724,MAN.,
725,MAN.,O ye bright orbs! your shining would be dimmed
726,MAN.,"By sin and all its pallid consequence,"
727,MAN.,Till scarce a glimmer fluttered on the sky
728,MAN.,To 'lume the dreamer to your sadden'd sphere.
729,MAN.,"But ye have held your priceless birthright sure,"
730,MAN.,"And walk among the panoply of heaven,"
731,MAN.,Clear and true-hearted as the sons of God.
732,MAN.,Yet may we gaze upon you from afar
733,MAN.,"As the unstained gaze on the innocent,"
734,MAN.,"Lovely and peerless in their purity,"
735,MAN.,Smitten and wondering with humbleness
736,MAN.,Of that which is your everlasting dower;
737,MAN.,Quenching within us pride and earthliness
738,MAN.,Before the glance of your serenity;
739,MAN.,"Aspiring ever for the spirit life,"
740,MAN.,"That casting off this fleshly tenement,"
741,MAN.,"With all its weakness and infirmities,"
742,MAN.,"Entereth on the cycle of the just,"
743,MAN.,"Unstained, immortal, glorious and strong!"

749,MAN.,
750,MAN.,There is no place so sweet as the greenwoods
751,MAN.,"In summer, heaven and earth awake with sounds"
752,MAN.,Melodial; the ripple of the breeze
753,MAN.,"Amongst the sun-green leaves, and pliant boughs,"
754,MAN.,Just like the rustle of young summer's dress;
755,MAN.,"The songs of birds, and the low mystic hum"
756,MAN.,Of bees amongst their floral treasuries;
757,MAN.,"Sweetest of all, the cool and liquid tones"
758,MAN.,"Of brooks--nature's true-hearted bards, who draw"
759,MAN.,"Bright inspirations from a pebbled ridge,"
760,MAN.,And frame them into sweetest melody.
761,MAN.,There's poetry in every pendent leaf
762,MAN.,If we could read them truly; but our hearts
763,MAN.,"Grow strange to nature's language in the world,"
764,MAN.,Nor can translate their heaven lore. Ev'ry change
765,MAN.,"From bud to full-blown ripeness, thence again"
766,MAN.,"To sereness and decay, is as the flow"
767,MAN.,"Of a short tale, whose moral is life's history."
768,MAN.,"The woods were made for poets and all dreamers,"
769,MAN.,"Men who philosophize Time's hour-glass down,"
770,MAN.,"And younger grow, till with the last shot sand--"
771,MAN.,"They die. The very leaves are fanciful,"
772,MAN.,And write their maxims on the sward in sun
773,MAN.,And shadow. Here I'll lay me down and dream
774,MAN.,An hour away amongst these violets!
775,MAN.,O my heart joys to gaze upon the sky
776,MAN.,"Gleaming athwart green leaves, like happiness"
777,MAN.,Above the gloom and shadow of the world!
778,MAN.,"Then, thought first feels its attribute divine,"
779,MAN.,"And like a callow eagle spreads its wings,"
780,MAN.,And makes its rest amid the lumin'd heavens.
781,MAN.,"The lark sings poized above me in the sun,"
782,MAN.,Like Moslem in his gilded minaret
783,MAN.,Calling the faithful unto matin prayer.
784,MAN.,"There would my spirit follow thee, sweet bird,"
785,MAN.,"Ling'ring for ever in the midway air,"
786,MAN.,"Earth shrouded 'neath me by ascending mists,"
787,MAN.,"And sunny-crested cloudlets, like the base"
788,MAN.,"Of bright Imagination's airy halls,"
789,MAN.,Whose roof is the star-fretted empyrean:
790,MAN.,"Thence let the world hear my full gushing joy,"
791,MAN.,"And thrill at pleasures they can never know,"
792,MAN.,"Hear the sweet tumult of my throbbing breast,"
793,MAN.,Like a clear spring of joyance bubbling up
794,MAN.,And overflowing time and space with streams;
795,MAN.,"Whilst I, wrapt in my own high blessedness,"
796,MAN.,Drain the sweet nectar shareless and alone.

802,SPIRIT.,Singing for heaven and earth undying hymns
803,SPIRIT.,"Of beauty, and deep-hearted tenderness;"
804,SPIRIT.,"But more, when sinking on its own sweet song,"
805,SPIRIT.,"It flutter, jubilant, to its soft nest"
806,SPIRIT.,Couched in the lowly bosom of the earth.
807,SPIRIT.,And so it is with life. Man may build up
808,SPIRIT.,"A pillar of misanthropy and self,"
809,SPIRIT.,"Raising him, statue-like, above his kind,"
810,SPIRIT.,And emulate the monumental stone
811,SPIRIT.,"In coldness and stern-browed indifference,"
812,SPIRIT.,"But in the paths of love, and sympathy,"
813,SPIRIT.,"And lowly charity, true glory lies,"
814,SPIRIT.,The substance of all joy and happiness.
815,SPIRIT.,"Let not thy spirit spurn man's fellowship,"
816,SPIRIT.,"And force the stream of kindness up life's steep,"
817,SPIRIT.,"Till, 'mid the rocky peaks of Thought it flow"
818,SPIRIT.,Unmargined by the verdant bloom of Act.
819,SPIRIT.,Shun Self! 'tis like the worm a rosy bud

823,SPIRIT.,Her wisdom by the inverted standard rule

825,SPIRIT.,There's not a flower but with its own sweet breath
826,SPIRIT.,"Cries out on selfishness, the while it gives"
827,SPIRIT.,Its fragrant treasures to the summer air;
828,SPIRIT.,"And not a bird within the greenwood shade,"
829,SPIRIT.,The burden of whose gentle minstrelsie
830,SPIRIT.,Is not of love and open-hearted joy.
831,SPIRIT.,The blest of earth are they whose sympathies

842,SPIRIT.,That fillest the blue vault of heaven with smiles
843,SPIRIT.,"As of a mother smiling on her child,"
844,SPIRIT.,"Pure, holy, without guile or artifice,"
845,SPIRIT.,Melting the spirit of each fleeting cloud
846,SPIRIT.,From darkness unto beauty and soft grace--
847,SPIRIT.,Thou art the emblem of that perfect love
848,SPIRIT.,"That sheddeth joy around it evermore,"
849,SPIRIT.,And from whose sweetness rise all gentle thoughts
850,SPIRIT.,As scent from vernal flowers; that in the heart
851,SPIRIT.,"Waketh all goodness by a magic spell,"

853,SPIRIT.,Start into instant light and eloquence.

1032,MAN.,"Strikes on the heart by contrast, as though heaven"

1034,MAN.,Of God burst on Creation. All is still
1035,MAN.,"Save the rapt nightingale, that sings to rest"
1036,MAN.,"Earth's warring multitudes, and this bright rill"
1037,MAN.,Whose voice is eloquent as poesy.
1038,MAN.,The very breeze is hush'd that stirr'd the leaves
1039,MAN.,"To pleasure, and the golden clouds float on"

1042,MAN.,"The melody of silence in the woods,"
1043,MAN.,"When outer life is hushed, and in the heart"
1044,MAN.,"The echo of its murmurous sweetness sounds,"
1045,MAN.,As in the pauses of a song the harp
1046,MAN.,Still vibrates. 'Tis a test by which the soul
1047,MAN.,"Lies open unto Nature, for its frame,"
1048,MAN.,"Impure or guilty, unto discord turns"
1049,MAN.,Those tones of peace and harmony. Perchance
1050,MAN.,"These woods ne'er heard the voice of man till now,"
1051,MAN.,Nor know the motion of his jarring thoughts.
1052,MAN.,I feel the weight of judgment o'er my head
1053,MAN.,"If, Adam-like, I bring the brand of guilt"
1054,MAN.,On this unfallen Paradise. In sooth
1055,MAN.,"This scene is rich in Eden loveliness,"
1056,MAN.,"And peace, and the rude din of jabbering crowds"
1057,MAN.,Unheard as when Earth's generations yet
1058,MAN.,Lay in the womb of Time. How soft the air
1059,MAN.,"Breathes with the scent of flow'rs, o'er which the dew"
1060,MAN.,"Hangs like a charm of sweetness! Ah, fair Earth!"
1061,MAN.,'Tis sad to die and leave thee e'en for heaven;
1062,MAN.,"Yet the blue sky above is glorious,"
1063,MAN.,And brings the spirit visions of bright scenes
1064,MAN.,Yet lovelier than this. There is a veil
1065,MAN.,"Of dreamy beauty o'er it, from whose woof"
1066,MAN.,The mystic star-eyes glimmer like a bride's.
1067,MAN.,"In such an hour peace steals upon the soul,"
1068,MAN.,Like the soft twilight o'er the toiling world;

1094,SPIRIT.,"Unblinded by the blighting mist of sin,"
1095,SPIRIT.,Sees emblems of its everlasting hope
1096,SPIRIT.,In Nature's loveliness. This quiet hour
1097,SPIRIT.,"When the calm'd heart cries truce unto itself,"
1098,SPIRIT.,"And lays the weapons of resentment down,"
1099,SPIRIT.,"And bitterness and anger, yields the bliss"

1101,SPIRIT.,The Earth is ne'er so sweet as when it seems

1121,SPIRIT.,"Made up of such pure loveliness within,"
1122,SPIRIT.,"That like a gem it glistens through the crust,"
1123,SPIRIT.,And makes heaven luminous. A chasten'd sound
1124,SPIRIT.,Of never failing melody still floats
1125,SPIRIT.,"About it, like an ocean, undulating"
1126,SPIRIT.,"To the sweet breath of summer scented airs,"
1127,SPIRIT.,"From hill to dale and leafy-tufted woods,"
1128,SPIRIT.,"That catch the humours of the golden sun,"
1129,SPIRIT.,And deck them in his livery. There falls
1130,SPIRIT.,"From the soft twilight gloom of sparry grots,"
1131,SPIRIT.,"And crystal pillar'd caverns, many a stream"
1132,SPIRIT.,"That breaks in light and music on the soul,"
1133,SPIRIT.,And like a diamond-sandall'd spirit glides
1134,SPIRIT.,"In beauty through the land, margined by flowers"
1135,SPIRIT.,"That mirror in its tide, and seem like stars"
1136,SPIRIT.,"In heaven. There are flowers everywhere, in vale"
1137,SPIRIT.,"Hill-side and woodland, in the sun and shade,"
1138,SPIRIT.,"That whether dreams be on them, or they wake,"

1140,SPIRIT.,"Sun-crested mountains, softened into grace"

1145,SPIRIT.,"The very clouds that scan the blue of heaven,"
1146,SPIRIT.,"Fused sometimes by the sunshine as with soul,"
1147,SPIRIT.,"Or flaked by the light fancies of the gale,"
1148,SPIRIT.,Form to the vision labyrinths of grace
1149,SPIRIT.,"And beauty, that melt into space, and spread"
1150,SPIRIT.,A hemisphere of magic o'er the orb--
1151,SPIRIT.,"And thro' this world at morning, noon, and night,"

1260,SPIRIT.,"Sprung from the womb of space, in perfectness"
1261,SPIRIT.,Co-equal with the fairest orb that holds
1262,SPIRIT.,Vice-royalty in heaven for the sun;
1263,SPIRIT.,"Form, substance, seeming, and that vivid charm"
1264,SPIRIT.,Which is the soul of matter like in each.
1265,SPIRIT.,"Mind differs only, making fair seem dull"
1266,SPIRIT.,"With what it glances through, and thus yon star"
1267,SPIRIT.,"Viewed with man's callous nature, would resolve"
1268,SPIRIT.,Into reality as cold as Earth.
1269,SPIRIT.,
1270,SPIRIT.,O Earth! thou Beauty! and thou Wonderful!
1271,SPIRIT.,That from thy bosom like a living womb
1272,SPIRIT.,Bringest all forms of loveliness and grace
1273,SPIRIT.,Into the gladness of the summer air--
1274,SPIRIT.,That givest to the winds that are the breath
1275,SPIRIT.,"And heaving of thy passion, wingëd thoughts"
1276,SPIRIT.,"To root, seed-like, into the ground, and spring,"
1277,SPIRIT.,"Bud, blossom, nourish'd ever by young showers,"
1278,SPIRIT.,"And moon-distillëd dews, until they make"
1279,SPIRIT.,"Thine utterance odorous. That from thy soul,"
1280,SPIRIT.,"As from an unseen presence of divinest light,"
1281,SPIRIT.,Dartest into the spirit subtle rays
1282,SPIRIT.,"That quicken life to blessing, as the breath"
1283,SPIRIT.,"Of being stirreth the inanimate,"
1284,SPIRIT.,"Making existence joy, and love, and power."
1285,SPIRIT.,O woods! and rustling forests! Ye that send
1286,SPIRIT.,"Soft murmurs ever to the ends of heaven,"
1287,SPIRIT.,"And from your breast, as from a poet's soul,"
1288,SPIRIT.,Issue all sweetest melodies of birds
1289,SPIRIT.,And leafy eloquence. O springs! and streams!
1290,SPIRIT.,"Blithe hearted wanderers throughout the earth,"
1291,SPIRIT.,Tracing your footsteps still with flowers that rise
1292,SPIRIT.,Like stars beneath the feet of Night. O hills!
1293,SPIRIT.,O mighty mountains! round whose hoary brows
1294,SPIRIT.,"Gather the mystic clouds of heaven, like thoughts"
1295,SPIRIT.,"Of unimagined wisdom, that are rocked"
1296,SPIRIT.,"To slumber by the deep-songed hurricanes,"
1297,SPIRIT.,"Sons of Destruction, and whose waking voice"
1298,SPIRIT.,Is the eternal thunder. O wide ocean!
1299,SPIRIT.,Swelling for ever with the mighty throes
1300,SPIRIT.,Of Nature's agony and ceaseless Act;
1301,SPIRIT.,Emblem of Time and of Eternity!
1302,SPIRIT.,"Time the great worker, the Implacable,"
1303,SPIRIT.,"That with the roll of human will and deed,"
1304,SPIRIT.,"And hopes, and joys, and shatter'd purposes"
1305,SPIRIT.,Dashes relentless on! Eternity--
1306,SPIRIT.,"The Pauseless, the Insatiate! the gulf"
1307,SPIRIT.,"Whereto all motion, all existence flows,"
1308,SPIRIT.,"Enters and ends. O sunshine! and cool shade,"
1309,SPIRIT.,And all that makes earth beautiful and sweet!
1310,SPIRIT.,"Soft moonlight! life's pure maidenhood, whose dreams"
1311,SPIRIT.,"Are gleams of antenatal blessedness,"
1312,SPIRIT.,"Witness for Earth's equality, and bid"
1313,SPIRIT.,"The sister orbs of heaven cry ""Hail!"" to her."

1315,MAN.,MAN.
1316,MAN.,
1317,MAN.,O Mother Earth! methinks I hear a voice
1318,MAN.,"Sound 'mid the surging of the stars of heaven,"
1319,MAN.,Like a clear trump athwart the mighty roar
1320,MAN.,Of falling waters.
1321,MAN.,
1322,MAN.,"""Oh thou beautiful,"
1323,MAN.,"""Frail daughter of Immensity! that hangest"
1324,MAN.,"""Upon the bosom of dim night, at once"
1325,MAN.,"""A glory, and a brightness, and a shame--"
1326,MAN.,"""That from the urn of everlasting love"
1327,MAN.,"""Drinkest of light and immortality,"
1328,MAN.,"""Like a fair child in waywardness and mirth,"
1329,MAN.,"""Triumphing in her loveliness; the swell"
1330,MAN.,"""Of thy rapt harmonies is mute in heaven,"
1331,MAN.,"""That once rang through the arches of all space,"
1332,MAN.,"""A wonder and an ecstasy; but still"
1333,MAN.,"""Thy path is with the glorious and pure,"
1334,MAN.,"""Spanning the empyrean with a jewelled zone,"
1335,MAN.,"""Making heaven beautiful, and with thy grace"
1336,MAN.,"""Charming to goodness, though thou act it not."
1337,MAN.,"""Arise, O lovely fondling of the skies!"
1338,MAN.,"""Wake from the silence of thy fallen doom,"
1339,MAN.,"""Breathe forth thy sweetness to the longing air;"
1340,MAN.,"""The angels are about thee evermore,"
1341,MAN.,"""Like watchers o'er a stricken one, that hold"
1342,MAN.,"""A glass to catch the life-mist from her lips."
1343,MAN.,"""Arise! and don thy bridal vestments pure,"
1344,MAN.,"""And lead the train of heaven to the morn!"
1345,MAN.,"""Art thou not beautiful, Daughter of Heaven?--"
1346,MAN.,"""Beautiful as a bride before the sun,"
1347,MAN.,"""Gliding along the blue serene of space,"
1348,MAN.,"""Pensive and glorious; showering soft light"
1349,MAN.,"""Upon the path of heaven, as from the eyes"

1357,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1358,SPIRIT.,
1359,SPIRIT.,"There are pure angels ever round the earth,"
1360,SPIRIT.,"As stars are round the azure dome of heaven,"
1361,SPIRIT.,"In sunshine and in twilight and in gloom,"
1362,SPIRIT.,That with the sweetness of an unseen love
1363,SPIRIT.,"Circle humanity, and like the lark"
1364,SPIRIT.,"Hid in the glory of the noonday sun,"
1365,SPIRIT.,Pour o'er the world heaven's constant tenderness.
1366,SPIRIT.,"Some in the soft-hued glimmering of dreams,"
1367,SPIRIT.,"Through the unfolded lattices of sleep,"
1368,SPIRIT.,"Steal to the soul in visions of delight,"
1369,SPIRIT.,Pure and benignant as the evening dew
1370,SPIRIT.,That cools the bosom of the blushing rose.
1371,SPIRIT.,"Some all unseen, save in the blessed care,"
1372,SPIRIT.,"That like a lover's arm, from life's rough way"
1373,SPIRIT.,Presses the serried thorns that choke it up;
1374,SPIRIT.,"But all as with an atmosphere of love,"
1375,SPIRIT.,"And peace and strength encircling man, alike"
1376,SPIRIT.,"Within him and without, that the foul breath"
1377,SPIRIT.,Of pestilent corruption touch him not.
1378,SPIRIT.,Some are there who have loved and suffered much
1379,SPIRIT.,"For earth, as a fond mother doth who sees"
1380,SPIRIT.,Her babe die in her bosom; who have traced
1381,SPIRIT.,"Man to the precipital brink of ruin,"
1382,SPIRIT.,"With open arms to charm him back from death,"
1383,SPIRIT.,Rejected and despised; who on the scroll
1384,SPIRIT.,"Of conscience, as with words of living light,"
1385,SPIRIT.,"Stamp the pure precepts of a holy lore,"
1386,SPIRIT.,That sin obliterates and sets at naught.

1388,MAN.,MAN.
1389,MAN.,
1390,MAN.,Oh! how polluted must man's spirit show
1391,MAN.,"In contrast with these ministers of heaven,"
1392,MAN.,That e'en beneath frail woman's purity
1393,MAN.,Dims like a taper 'neath the light of day!--
1394,MAN.,"Methinks if from our eyes sin's blindness fell,"
1395,MAN.,"And gave pure angels to our ravish'd sight,"
1396,MAN.,Gliding around us clad in the bright robes
1397,MAN.,"Of love and immortality, this earth"
1398,MAN.,"Would be like heaven. O! 'twere a blessed change,"
1399,MAN.,And perfect as when Death's exulting sigh
1400,MAN.,Swoons through the empty chambers of the soul
1401,MAN.,His note of liberty.
1402,MAN.,
1403,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1404,SPIRIT.,
1405,SPIRIT.,'Tis man alone
1406,SPIRIT.,Makes Earth less Paradise; its frame is full
1407,SPIRIT.,"Of perfect blessedness, which to the pure"
1408,SPIRIT.,Were Heaven in all its fulness; but mankind
1409,SPIRIT.,"Are crimsoned o'er with sin, which like blood-stains"
1410,SPIRIT.,A soundless ocean could not cleanse away.
1411,SPIRIT.,And thus all flesh must thaw back to the dust
1412,SPIRIT.,"From which it sprang, as ice doth unto water,"
1413,SPIRIT.,Before the soul is purified for heaven.
1414,SPIRIT.,Men little dream how near heaven is to them
1415,SPIRIT.,"In possibility, how far in deed."
1416,SPIRIT.,"As little as they dream amid their mirth,"
1417,SPIRIT.,Death stalks beside them; that his shadow falls
1418,SPIRIT.,In the same mirror where the maiden sees
1419,SPIRIT.,"The image of her loveliness, and flits"
1420,SPIRIT.,Amongst the whirl of revelry and show.
1421,SPIRIT.,
1422,SPIRIT.,
1423,SPIRIT.,SCENE. _A rock overhanging the Sea._
1424,SPIRIT.,
1425,MAN.,MAN.
1426,MAN.,
1427,MAN.,A rock and the wild waters! 'Tis a spot
1428,MAN.,"To moralize on life, and strip the world"
1429,MAN.,"Of all its gaudy trappings and false gloss,"
1430,MAN.,"That like the daubing on a wanton's cheek,"
1431,MAN.,"Crimsons the paleness of disease and shame,"
1432,MAN.,And with life's semblance mocks a rotten heart.
1433,MAN.,
1434,MAN.,"O wild, wild sea! eternal wilderness"
1435,MAN.,Of strife and toil and fruitless energy!
1436,MAN.,Birthplace and Tomb! whence unto being spring
1437,MAN.,"Successive myriads to run their race,"
1438,MAN.,"Rage, labour, and grow hoar, then pass away"
1439,MAN.,"With all their deeds and memories, and cede"
1440,MAN.,Their petty sphere of inches to another.
1441,MAN.,"O wild, wild sea! thou bosom of all passion,"
1442,MAN.,"And thought, and hope, and longing infinite!"
1443,MAN.,"That struggling ever from the riven caves,"
1444,MAN.,"And fathomless abysses of the Earth,"
1445,MAN.,"As from the cells of an awakened soul,"
1446,MAN.,Fling your hoarse murmurs and aspiring groans
1447,MAN.,"To the strong wingëd winds, that puff them on"
1448,MAN.,In sport and in derision; that art stirred
1449,MAN.,To tumult and to madness by the breath
1450,MAN.,"Of unseen currents, unsubstantial air,"
1451,MAN.,"That passes on, and leaves a foaming train"
1452,MAN.,To wonder at the thing that angered them.
1453,MAN.,"O wild, wild sea! soul of indifference!"
1454,MAN.,Lashing eternally the rifted sands
1455,MAN.,And lonely shores about ye; swallowing
1456,MAN.,"The wreck of man's dependence, and the life"
1457,MAN.,"That struggles with ye for the prize of love,"
1458,MAN.,"And joy, and sorrow, clinging round its soul;"
1459,MAN.,That flowest on in coldness and self-aim
1460,MAN.,"O'er the dissolving frames of countless waves,"
1461,MAN.,"That sink like generations, and so rise,"
1462,MAN.,"Pausing or stilling never, numb'ring up"
1463,MAN.,A myriad selfish interests to make
1464,MAN.,Thy sum of being perfect. Man may read
1465,MAN.,"The lore of human nature in thee, writ"
1466,MAN.,"Not with the pen of flattery, that gilds"
1467,MAN.,"The base past recognition, but all plain"
1468,MAN.,And coloured only by its truthfulness;
1469,MAN.,"The good and ill alike displayed, that lie"
1470,MAN.,Within the sounding of its inmost soul.
1471,MAN.,"O! thought might wander o'er this briny waste,"
1472,MAN.,"Dove-like, without one Ark whereon to rest"
1473,MAN.,"From the interminable ebb and flow,"
1474,MAN.,"As many a soul has flutter'd o'er the earth,"
1475,MAN.,"Weary and faint, as mine did till it found"
1476,MAN.,A haven in the bosom of sweet love.
1477,MAN.,
1478,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1479,SPIRIT.,
1480,SPIRIT.,Then thou hast loved?
1481,SPIRIT.,
1482,MAN.,MAN.
1483,MAN.,
1484,MAN.,Ay! so that life is bound
1485,MAN.,"About by it, as by a Gordian knot,"
1486,MAN.,"Inseparable, until Death's sharp blade"
1487,MAN.,Divide its inmost coil. There is a time
1488,MAN.,When all that sweeten'd youth and childhood dulls
1489,MAN.,"And fades to nothingness, as the faint moon"
1490,MAN.,"Pales at the bright foreshadowing of morn,"
1491,MAN.,"And leaves heaven void, when every chord is dumb"
1492,MAN.,"That once made music in the soul, and life"
1493,MAN.,"Is still and silent, though it be the pause"
1494,MAN.,"That presages the storm and bitter strife,"
1495,MAN.,"Whose fury ofttimes bends the spirit down,"
1496,MAN.,And strips it of its blossoms; Then to me
1497,MAN.,"O'er the blank chaos of my being came,"
1498,MAN.,"As from the haunted chambers of deep thought,"
1499,MAN.,"A glorious presence--an imagined grace,"
1500,MAN.,Whose footfalls as she rose pulsed thro' my heart
1501,MAN.,"With tremblings exquisite. It was sweet Love,"
1502,MAN.,The Blessed! the Indwelling! that doth make
1503,MAN.,"A virgin firmament for its pure light,"
1504,MAN.,"Then at the pleading of its own deep want,"
1505,MAN.,Shines forth in glory and in tenderness.
1506,MAN.,
1507,MAN.,"Amongst the laughing and the gay I went,"
1508,MAN.,"Seeking for one to realize love's dream,"
1509,MAN.,As mid the countless hosts of heaven the sage
1510,MAN.,Peers for the brightness of a new-born star.
1511,MAN.,"Then, soft hands trembled in my palm, and forms"
1512,MAN.,"Graceful and rounded with the bloom of youth,"
1513,MAN.,Flitted about me in the languishment
1514,MAN.,"Of music and sweet motion; voices low,"
1515,MAN.,"And modulate from laughter unto sadness,"
1516,MAN.,"Hung on the air like perfume on the wind,"
1517,MAN.,"And eyes, flashing, and mild, and fond, spake too,"
1518,MAN.,"A very Babel of soft speech, and yet--"
1519,MAN.,"I sighed. Life seemed to me a painted daub--all glare,"
1520,MAN.,"And show, and tinsel, where the eye in vain"
1521,MAN.,"Sought some green spot to rest on, till a mist"
1522,MAN.,Swam o'er it as in gazing at the sun.
1523,MAN.,
1524,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1525,SPIRIT.,
1526,SPIRIT.,Man ofttimes palms an artificial life
1527,SPIRIT.,"Upon the heart for that which is the true,"
1528,SPIRIT.,Though to the real it be what a flower
1529,SPIRIT.,"Is to its mimicry, a tinted rag"
1530,SPIRIT.,Unsweetened by the breath of summer's love.
1531,SPIRIT.,"Joy flows alone from an _untroubled_ spring,"
1532,SPIRIT.,"Unstirred by the false whirl of giddy dreams,"
1533,SPIRIT.,That send the dregs of passion through its veins.
1534,SPIRIT.,
1535,SPIRIT.,"Amid that gay assemblage many wore,"
1536,SPIRIT.,"Perchance, a laughing vizard o'er a heart"
1537,SPIRIT.,"Empty and sad; many a vacant smile,"
1538,SPIRIT.,Like a sun-ray upon the winter's snow
1539,SPIRIT.,That freezes yet beneath it. Some there were
1540,SPIRIT.,"Who flutter'd round its glitter, like a moth"
1541,SPIRIT.,That takes a petty rush-light for the sun;
1542,SPIRIT.,And few who let the honest heart appear
1543,SPIRIT.,Unveiled mid Fashion's frigid masquerade.
1544,SPIRIT.,Didst thou look deeper than the outward guise?
1545,SPIRIT.,
1546,MAN.,MAN.
1547,MAN.,
1548,MAN.,"Ay! some there were so lovely, that the eye"
1549,MAN.,"Dreamt of them in its night, when they were gone;"
1550,MAN.,"But when I search'd them, like a single flower"
1551,MAN.,"The outer blossoms parted, and showed nought within."
1552,MAN.,
1553,MAN.,"Oh! then I fled, as one whose own wild thoughts"
1554,MAN.,"Bid him outstrip the curbless winds of heaven,"
1555,MAN.,And storm the bulwarks of sublime desire.
1556,MAN.,Want grew within me as a famine grows
1557,MAN.,With every hour that fleets unsatisfied;
1558,MAN.,"But in my wanderings there rose a spot,"
1559,MAN.,"Where man had wrought pure nature's counsel out,"
1560,MAN.,Nor reared a shrine to mock her loveliness;
1561,MAN.,"Yet this I heeded not, for there was one"
1562,MAN.,Who came to me on sudden with such joy
1563,MAN.,"That I stirred not, but like one weak with thirst,"
1564,MAN.,Let the life draught flow o'er my powerless lips.
1565,MAN.,
1566,MAN.,"O! yet I see her, with those blessed eyes"
1567,MAN.,"Slaying my soul with beauty; eyes so deep,"
1568,MAN.,That in their azure ocean of soft light
1569,MAN.,"Thought shrank into a fathom length; and smiles,"
1570,MAN.,"Stealing their sweetness from a heaven of love,"
1571,MAN.,"And joy, and immortality within,"
1572,MAN.,"Whence all emotion, angel-like, came forth,"
1573,MAN.,Clad in a vesture of celestial light.
1574,MAN.,Her face beamed on me like a glimpse of heaven
1575,MAN.,"Caught in the rapture of prophetic trance,"
1576,MAN.,"That in all day-light thoughts, and shaded dreams,"
1577,MAN.,"Haunts the deep soul for ever. As she went,"
1578,MAN.,"Grace lapt its mantle o'er her, like the gold"
1579,MAN.,On fleecy-bosomed clouds in sunny skies.
1580,MAN.,O Spirit! she was beautiful! a thing
1581,MAN.,"Guileless and pure, as though her youth had past"
1582,MAN.,"With Heaven's own children in the light of God,"
1583,MAN.,"Thence come to make a paradise of earth,"
1584,MAN.,And breathe the transports of transcendant bliss
1585,MAN.,Like floral exhalations through my soul.
1586,MAN.,
1587,MAN.,"And I--I loved her with the love of heaven,"
1588,MAN.,"That melts down time and space, and all between,"
1589,MAN.,And clasps an essence in the soul's embrace;
1590,MAN.,And from her being there would ever flow
1591,MAN.,"Full streams of holy melody, that lapt"
1592,MAN.,"Earth, air, and heaven, and all terrestrial forms"
1593,MAN.,With charms bright as heaven's new-created light.
1594,MAN.,"And as she gazed on the blue firmament,"
1595,MAN.,"And shrined the stars with her pure thoughts, and dreamt"
1596,MAN.,"Of that which lay beyond; I gazed on her,"
1597,MAN.,"And drew Elysian theories of Heaven,"
1598,MAN.,As though borne thither by wing'd seraphims.
1599,MAN.,Oh! what is there in love that wreathes all things
1600,MAN.,"With an unfading halo of sweet light,"
1601,MAN.,Making the mystery of Nature clear?
1602,MAN.,
1603,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1604,SPIRIT.,
1605,SPIRIT.,"Love, like the sun, clears from the soul all clouds"
1606,SPIRIT.,"That darken understanding, and wrap earth"
1607,SPIRIT.,"Round with a misty curtain, through whose folds"
1608,SPIRIT.,The lineaments of beauty glimmer forth
1609,SPIRIT.,In undefined luxuriance. 'Tis a spell
1610,SPIRIT.,That brings by sympathetic influence
1611,SPIRIT.,The soul-deep glory from the universe.
1612,SPIRIT.,"All things are beautiful to those who love,"
1613,SPIRIT.,Whether in mind or matter. Life becomes
1614,SPIRIT.,"A pathway of soft light and radiance,"
1615,SPIRIT.,Whereon the spirit glideth unto heaven
1616,SPIRIT.,As angels up the sunshine. Thought and deed
1617,SPIRIT.,"Are blessed in the framing and the act,"
1618,SPIRIT.,"Fashioned and temper'd with pure charity,"
1619,SPIRIT.,"That knits man unto man, and grants the weak"
1620,SPIRIT.,Exemption from the thraldom of the strong;--
1621,SPIRIT.,"And things inanimate, that yet are pierced"
1622,SPIRIT.,"Through with the spirit of eternal love,"
1623,SPIRIT.,As with a life that circulates and glows
1624,SPIRIT.,"In ruddy currents throughout all their frame,"
1625,SPIRIT.,By gracious intuition stand revealed
1626,SPIRIT.,In all the plenitude of Eden charms.
1627,SPIRIT.,"Then Nature's language reaches to the heart,"
1628,SPIRIT.,As through the modulations of a song
1629,SPIRIT.,Sweet thoughts flow o'er the spirit. What was fair
1630,SPIRIT.,"Seems fairer, what was vividless grows bright."
1631,SPIRIT.,
1632,MAN.,MAN.
1633,MAN.,
1634,MAN.,"Ay! she made all things beautiful to me,"
1635,MAN.,"Drawing, with youth's pure privilege, the sting"
1636,MAN.,Of guilt and wrong from life--'twas as the sun
1637,MAN.,Rose on a sphere seen but by night before.
1638,MAN.,"Ah! bitter image of a transient thing,"
1639,MAN.,"That shineth with Promethean glory, then"
1640,MAN.,Sinks 'neath the shadow of Eternity!
1641,MAN.,"Oh Spirit! day by day I saw her fade,"
1642,MAN.,"The life within her grew more spiritual,"
1643,MAN.,"Triumphing in the weakness of the flesh,"
1644,MAN.,"And in her eyes supernal brightness shone,"
1645,MAN.,As from the glory of approaching heaven.
1646,MAN.,"Dear child! that kisses could not keep awake,"
1647,MAN.,Or woo from the sweet love of Mother-land.
1648,MAN.,"She lay within these arms, and angels came"
1649,MAN.,"And whispered her away with them to Heaven,"
1650,MAN.,"So softly, that I knew it not, but still"
1651,MAN.,Murmured my heart to her. To sense she lay
1652,MAN.,"Upon my breast, and yet she was in heaven;"
1653,MAN.,This but the earthly mantle she had shed.
1654,MAN.,"There were those silken locks that curtained her,"
1655,MAN.,And her sweet lips that I had kissed but now;
1656,MAN.,"From whence, as from a living spring of love,"
1657,MAN.,Trickled pure heaven streams o'er my life's dull waste.
1658,MAN.,"But Oh! I kissed the soft lids from her eyes,"
1659,MAN.,"And knew my desolation, for the soul"
1660,MAN.,"That was their soul, as light is day's, no more"
1661,MAN.,"Stood in their dewy portals, like a queen"
1662,MAN.,Swaying true-hearted multitudes. Oh heaven!
1663,MAN.,"'Twas wonderful to fold her thus unto me,"
1664,MAN.,"With life's ripe bloom upon her cheeks, and grace"
1665,MAN.,"Clinging round her like a bridal robe,"
1666,MAN.,"Yet feel that she, the verity, the self,"
1667,MAN.,"Was floating, worlds-off, on the stream of souls"
1668,MAN.,To God. Oh mind! 'tis ever thus with thee!
1669,MAN.,"Thou graspest at material shadowings,"
1670,MAN.,Whilst that the immaterial substance of all good
1671,MAN.,Flies from thee like a vapour from the wind;
1672,MAN.,"So that thou hast a clod within thine hand,"
1673,MAN.,"Life seems eternal, till the crumbling dust"
1674,MAN.,"Runs through thy clenching fingers, and thy gage"
1675,MAN.,Mocks thee up from the mould'ring frame of Earth.
1676,MAN.,There is no mystery like Death; it comes
1677,MAN.,"Sightless as the first breath of infant life,"
1678,MAN.,And goes to an unsearched Eternity--
1679,MAN.,The End and the Beginning are alike.
1680,MAN.,
1681,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1682,SPIRIT.,
1683,SPIRIT.,"Death strikes upon the soul the last deep chime,"
1684,SPIRIT.,"That tells it Time's short hour has passed away,"
1685,SPIRIT.,Eternity's undialled course begun;
1686,SPIRIT.,There is a trackless ocean round this life
1687,SPIRIT.,"Whose tide is tremulous with unseen gales,"
1688,SPIRIT.,And storms that lash it off to fury--shades
1689,SPIRIT.,Of deep chaotic darkness ever hang
1690,SPIRIT.,"Above it, like the thunder crags of heaven,"
1691,SPIRIT.,"And sounds, as of the swooning of a blast"
1692,SPIRIT.,"Through time-worn caverns, flap their heavy wings"
1693,SPIRIT.,On the white foam crest of the surging waves.
1694,SPIRIT.,O man! that standest on the pinnacle
1695,SPIRIT.,Of life's abysmal heights with failing heart
1696,SPIRIT.,"And reeling brain, gaze on that troubled gulf--"
1697,SPIRIT.,"It is thy pathway to the Better-Land,"
1698,SPIRIT.,"Which thou must traverse with a sea-bird's flight,"
1699,SPIRIT.,Whose rest is on the bosom of the storm.
1700,SPIRIT.,Ay! 'tis a fearful plunge! Now think of Death--
1701,SPIRIT.,"There is an angel merciful and strong,"
1702,SPIRIT.,"Hovering ever o'er the weary world,"
1703,SPIRIT.,"That foldeth in his arms the weak, whose feet"
1704,SPIRIT.,"Totter upon the brink of the Inane,"
1705,SPIRIT.,"And, like a mother, wafts them from Earth's strife"
1706,SPIRIT.,Into the bosom of eternal rest;
1707,SPIRIT.,Is he not merciful who spares so long
1708,SPIRIT.,"The guilty for repentance, and the pure"
1709,SPIRIT.,Transplants in all their purity to heaven?
1710,SPIRIT.,"Death harms not aught that's lovely, that poor frame"
1711,SPIRIT.,"Is mere corruption, which the soul makes fair"
1712,SPIRIT.,"By luminous infusion, and the soul"
1713,SPIRIT.,"Feels not Death's breathing on its healthful bloom,"
1714,SPIRIT.,"But like a virgin doffs its earthly veil,"
1715,SPIRIT.,And gives its fullest beauty to the light.

1719,MAN.,"O Spirit! tell me, shall we meet again"
1720,MAN.,As those who have loved well in Time; or drop
1721,MAN.,All memories of Earth with the sad dust
1722,MAN.,The soul shakes from it at the gate of heaven?

1732,SPIRIT.,And the same power that makes identity
1733,SPIRIT.,"'Twixt man and man, being the soul within,"
1734,SPIRIT.,"That constitutes the _Self_ of every man,"
1735,SPIRIT.,Bears its distinctive features when it sheds
1736,SPIRIT.,The crysalis of frail humanity;
1737,SPIRIT.,"They who have loved on Earth will love in Heaven,"
1738,SPIRIT.,"Through each the current flowing unto God,"
1739,SPIRIT.,"Thence shed again in blessing on their souls,"
1740,SPIRIT.,As from clear tided springs a summer cloud
1741,SPIRIT.,"Gathers its dewy freight to yield again,"
1742,SPIRIT.,In sunny showers upon the native earth.
1743,SPIRIT.,
1744,SPIRIT.,"True Love is Earth's blest blessedness. All else,"
1745,SPIRIT.,"Wealth, fame, nobility, and the poor gauds"
1746,SPIRIT.,"Wherewith man trinkets out his little life,"
1747,SPIRIT.,End with the dust that rattles on his bier;
1748,SPIRIT.,"But Love, like a rich heritage, ascends"
1749,SPIRIT.,"With the freed spirit to the throne of God,"
1750,SPIRIT.,There to be perfected and purified
1751,SPIRIT.,To commune with the Children of the Light.
1752,SPIRIT.,"Therefore love much on Earth, keeping the heart"
1753,SPIRIT.,"Pure from the rank pollutions of the flesh,"
1754,SPIRIT.,That like a mould'ring bank hangs loose above
1755,SPIRIT.,To launch its filth upon each errant wave;
1756,SPIRIT.,"Let thy love circle wider with all time,"
1757,SPIRIT.,"Like the light ripple round a pebble plunge,"
1758,SPIRIT.,"Wider, and wider till the swells subside"
1759,SPIRIT.,In the calm fulness of Eternity.
1760,SPIRIT.,"The love of heaven flows in _one_ stream to God,"
1761,SPIRIT.,As from a fountain'd unison of soul
1762,SPIRIT.,Wherein all spirits blend inseparably;
1763,SPIRIT.,"There is no isolation but in Time,"
1764,SPIRIT.,For Death that units out mortality
1765,SPIRIT.,"Like minutes on a dial, now, will break"
1766,SPIRIT.,"His arrows 'mid the ruins of the Earth,"
1767,SPIRIT.,"Proclaiming _everlasting_ life and love,"
1768,SPIRIT.,The consummation of all unity.

1771,SPIRIT.,SCENE. _Hill and Dale--Morning._
1772,SPIRIT.,
1773,MAN.,MAN.
1774,MAN.,
1775,MAN.,The breath of morn is stealing o'er my brow
1776,MAN.,"All redolent of life, and health, and joy,"
1777,MAN.,"As the first breeze that fans the prisoner's cheeks,"
1778,MAN.,And welcomes him to Liberty. The Earth
1779,MAN.,"Is yet in her sweet childhood innocence,"
1780,MAN.,Ere the dark cloud of worldly interests
1781,MAN.,"Obscure her taintless heavens, and the blue mist,"
1782,MAN.,"Which is the spirit of the rising dew,"
1783,MAN.,"Hangs o'er it like the sadness of first love,"
1784,MAN.,That makes youth beautiful. The lark is up
1785,MAN.,And singing like a disembodied soul
1786,MAN.,"Within the brightness of the blessed sun,"
1787,MAN.,Telling of naught but heaven and happiness;
1788,MAN.,"There is no dew upon her bosom now,"
1789,MAN.,For the young beams have kissed it utterly;
1790,MAN.,"Yet over flower, and bud, and blade there lies"
1791,MAN.,"The crystal tissue, trembling with soft light,"
1792,MAN.,"As the young day moves gaily up the sky,"
1793,MAN.,And sheds his guerdon o'er the waiting Earth.
1794,MAN.,
1795,MAN.,"O what a charm there is in purity,"
1796,MAN.,"Of morn, life, love, and nature all. This scene,"
1797,MAN.,"So clear and calm and peaceful, that it fills"
1798,MAN.,"The soul with its o'erflowing blessedness,"
1799,MAN.,"Pales 'neath the glare of noon, and man's rude lust,"
1800,MAN.,To scarce the semblance of its former self.
1801,MAN.,But with the heart--O God! Thy richest gift
1802,MAN.,"Is Innocence, that like a quenchless spring"
1803,MAN.,"Of everlasting light, encircles life"
1804,MAN.,"With beauty and unfading radiance,"
1805,MAN.,Keeping all sense and feeling fresh and sweet
1806,MAN.,As the untainted breathing of the morn.
1807,MAN.,
1808,MAN.,"How lovely is all nature, separate"
1809,MAN.,From man! There is no whispering of strife
1810,MAN.,"Or sorrow here, naught to inform the soul"
1811,MAN.,Of man's deep wretchedness and sin. No lust
1812,MAN.,To justify the wretch who binds his soul
1813,MAN.,"In the drear darkness of a murky cell,"
1814,MAN.,Scraping for gold as beasts do in the earth
1815,MAN.,"For carrion, and counting life-time out"
1816,MAN.,By ducats; closing house and heart alike
1817,MAN.,To the benignant sunshine. If our hearts
1818,MAN.,"Could lave in Lethe's cleansing stream sometimes,"
1819,MAN.,"Till evil vanished from its memory,"
1820,MAN.,And left a virgin tablet for the pen
1821,MAN.,"Of Nature, life would be as sweet as love."
1822,MAN.,
1823,MAN.,What far extremes of woe and blessedness
1824,MAN.,"This earth can yield! The woe create, the joy"
1825,MAN.,Begotten from a never failing womb;
1826,MAN.,"Woe! fashioned out of craft, and guile, and sin,"
1827,MAN.,"That hungereth for prey, till, as it were,"
1828,MAN.,The mother eats the babe that sucks her breast;
1829,MAN.,The joy! inherent and diffused like light
1830,MAN.,"From the eternal glory of the sun,"
1831,MAN.,"Gather'd from all things, sight, and sound, and sense,"
1832,MAN.,E'en from the very breeze that whispers us
1833,MAN.,Of yielded sweetness and unhoarded gifts.
1834,MAN.,
1835,MAN.,O God! preserve my heart emancipate
1836,MAN.,"From all world feelings that must die with Time,"
1837,MAN.,Like things unworthy of Eternity;
1838,MAN.,Sow in my spirit seed that may spring up
1839,MAN.,"And bud and increase throughout life, until"
1840,MAN.,"It blossom fully in the light of heaven,"
1841,MAN.,Grant that the evil of the world may ne'er
1842,MAN.,Harden my heart against the sweet impress
1843,MAN.,"Of Beauty, that beholding there, she see"
1844,MAN.,No mirror'd image of her loveliness!
1845,MAN.,
1846,MAN.,Methinks life were a curse if separate
1847,MAN.,From loving of the Good and Beautiful!
1848,MAN.,"To gaze upon that azure dome, so blue"
1849,MAN.,"And penetrate with sunshine through and through,"
1850,MAN.,"As lover's eyes with fondness--the far hills,"
1851,MAN.,And sun-green meadows sloping to the stream
1852,MAN.,"With tints of bosky shadows, yet not feel"
1853,MAN.,"A motion in the spirit, like the tide"
1854,MAN.,Of waving woodlands rippled by a breeze;
1855,MAN.,"Better return to dust from which we sprang,"
1856,MAN.,And bid the winds of heaven scatter it!
1857,MAN.,
1858,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1859,SPIRIT.,
1860,SPIRIT.,Love Beauty: let it be an atmosphere
1861,SPIRIT.,"Above thee and around, whence comes the breath"
1862,SPIRIT.,Of life and health and gladness. Yet beware
1863,SPIRIT.,"Thy love be not an ideality,"
1864,SPIRIT.,"That, like the smile upon a sculptur'd lip,"
1865,SPIRIT.,Freezes upon the stone nor sheds abroad
1866,SPIRIT.,The genial influence of a loving heart.
1867,SPIRIT.,There is an aim still nobler than the love
1868,SPIRIT.,"Of Beauty; to show Beauty forth in _act_,"
1869,SPIRIT.,"And _life_, that like some fertilizing stream"
1870,SPIRIT.,It glide flower-margined to Eternity.
1871,SPIRIT.,"Beauty quiescent loseth half its charms,"
1872,SPIRIT.,As a blue eye when sleep hath closed its lid;
1873,SPIRIT.,"But in its operation, 'tis a star"
1874,SPIRIT.,That leaves a track of glory on the sky;
1875,SPIRIT.,Worst miser he who hoards up in his soul
1876,SPIRIT.,The blessed wealth of Beauty and repels
1877,SPIRIT.,Unbenison'd the weary at his gate.
1878,SPIRIT.,
1879,SPIRIT.,"There is a way to make life glorious,"
1880,SPIRIT.,"And nobler than the heritage of kings,"
1881,SPIRIT.,"Though thy path lie along a vale in life,"
1882,SPIRIT.,With mountain pride reared up on either side--
1883,SPIRIT.,"To make thy march triumphant, trailing not"
1884,SPIRIT.,The colours of thy Purpose in the dust--
1885,SPIRIT.,And be received as victor into heaven.
1886,SPIRIT.,Set Beauty in thy soul like a sea-light
1887,SPIRIT.,"To warn thee from the rocks and shoals of wrong,"
1888,SPIRIT.,And guide thee surely to thy journey's end;
1889,SPIRIT.,Let her pure promptings stablish in thy heart
1890,SPIRIT.,"A living spring of motive, that may flow"
1891,SPIRIT.,"Through thought and action, like the veinëd life"
1892,SPIRIT.,Through man and all his members; not for praise
1893,SPIRIT.,"Let thy work be, nor gain, but heaven and right,"
1894,SPIRIT.,"And for the feeling of that sweetest sense,"
1895,SPIRIT.,That from thy sowing springeth up no tare
1896,SPIRIT.,"Of grief or bitterness, but goodly fruit"
1897,SPIRIT.,"That nourisheth the heart, and gives it strength"
1898,SPIRIT.,To combat manfully for life and truth;
1899,SPIRIT.,"Look manhood in the face unblanchingly,"
1900,SPIRIT.,With no rose-coloured veil 'twixt it and thee--
1901,SPIRIT.,"With pure integrity to match the great,"
1902,SPIRIT.,And humbleness to poize thee with the small;
1903,SPIRIT.,"Look at its guilt and shame, as on deep wounds"
1904,SPIRIT.,Wherefrom a life is flowing; seek thou then
1905,SPIRIT.,"To staunch them in thy measure; mark its wrongs,"
1906,SPIRIT.,The burden of oppression and the toil
1907,SPIRIT.,That grind the sand of life down till it run
1908,SPIRIT.,"Like water through the mighty glass of Time,"
1909,SPIRIT.,And let thy voice come like a trump to call
1910,SPIRIT.,"The faithful to the rescue. Find the weak,"
1911,SPIRIT.,"And weary, and the desolate of heart,"
1912,SPIRIT.,"Faint with the sorrows and the cares of life,"
1913,SPIRIT.,And let no act add to their bitter cup
1914,SPIRIT.,"One drop of gall, but like a priest do thou"
1915,SPIRIT.,"Tell them of hope and peace, and gladden them"
1916,SPIRIT.,"With that blest balm, pure kindness, which transforms,"
1917,SPIRIT.,"With more than Magian art, the meanest act"
1918,SPIRIT.,Into the brightness of the summer sun!--
1919,SPIRIT.,Doth not this quiet hour fall on thy soul
1920,SPIRIT.,Like music dropping from the spheres?
1921,SPIRIT.,
1922,MAN.,MAN.
1923,MAN.,
1924,MAN.,Ay! sooth
1925,MAN.,It is most sweet! Methinks that such a time
1926,MAN.,"Were meeter far for lover's tryst than eve,"
1927,MAN.,"When the dark night must sadden o'er their vows,"
1928,MAN.,"And hide them from each other. Now, all things"
1929,MAN.,"Are pure and beautiful as love should be,"
1930,MAN.,"The dew of youth fresh on them, and though life"
1931,MAN.,"Should darken o'er with clouds as it roll on,"
1932,MAN.,"Still love would light them on, like the bright guide"
1933,MAN.,"Of Israel, to the promised land of rest."
1934,MAN.,"'Tis beautiful, love plighted in the morn"
1935,MAN.,"Of life, when not a shadow dims its heaven--"
1936,MAN.,"Plighted for good or ill, as fate may rule,"
1937,MAN.,"Enduring alike true through sun and storm,"
1938,MAN.,"Save when the cold blast sweeps across the way,"
1939,MAN.,It knits them only closer heart to heart.
1940,MAN.,
1941,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1942,SPIRIT.,
1943,SPIRIT.,Love is no faint exotic made to bloom
1944,SPIRIT.,"In the close summer of a glassy frame,"
1945,SPIRIT.,That at the first breath of the unquelled air
1946,SPIRIT.,Shrivels up like a parchment in the flame.
1947,SPIRIT.,"No! let it stand upon the mountain's brow,"
1948,SPIRIT.,And bid the untamed winds make sport of it;
1949,SPIRIT.,"Yet though they drive it 'fore them in their might,"
1950,SPIRIT.,'Twill be like the strong eagle that exults
1951,SPIRIT.,In the wild rapture of his headlong swoop;

1955,MAN.,
1956,MAN.,"Now as I gaze upon this cloudless sky,"
1957,MAN.,"So soft and tranquil, mem'ry paints to me"
1958,MAN.,One whose life bid as fair--that my heart said
1959,MAN.,"Beholding her--""O flower! so bright and sweet,"
1960,MAN.,"""With the pure dew of maidenhood bestrewn,"
1961,MAN.,"""Thy life will be unfolded like the rose,"
1962,MAN.,"""That leaf by leaf adds sweetness to the spring!"""
1963,MAN.,"She was most beautiful! but more in this,"
1964,MAN.,"That she moved like an angel, minist'ring"
1965,MAN.,To joy and peace and charity. The weak
1966,MAN.,Rejoiced before her as the embodied smile
1967,MAN.,"Of Providence, and sadden'd when she pass'd;"
1968,MAN.,"And yet one short, short year and she was gone,"
1969,MAN.,"Her heart pierced through with thorns, who ne'er had borne"
1970,MAN.,The semblance of a sorrow into life.
1971,MAN.,Is there no armour against sorrow's sting?
1972,MAN.,
1973,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
1974,SPIRIT.,
1975,SPIRIT.,"The highway of this world is set with thorns,"
1976,SPIRIT.,O'er which poor pilgrims still must journey on;
1977,SPIRIT.,"There are who walk it shod with iron sense,"
1978,SPIRIT.,"That crushes opposition like a vice,"
1979,SPIRIT.,And puts aside the ready points like twigs
1980,SPIRIT.,Pressed backward in the woodlands by a child.
1981,SPIRIT.,There are who seem buoyed upward by some power
1982,SPIRIT.,"Above the level of affliction's range,"
1983,SPIRIT.,"Until their term be run, and then they fall"
1984,SPIRIT.,Into the bosom of the angel Death.
1985,SPIRIT.,And there are some whose tender feet are pierced
1986,SPIRIT.,"Evermore deeper by the rugged path,"
1987,SPIRIT.,Whose softness and whose beauty nigh invite
1988,SPIRIT.,"The cruel spoiler to his unarmed prey,"
1989,SPIRIT.,"As the swift hawk high poizëd in the sky,"
1990,SPIRIT.,Swoops when the dove floats past on silv'ry wings.
1991,SPIRIT.,
1992,SPIRIT.,"There is a veil upon the eyes of men,"
1993,SPIRIT.,"That makes all things show dimly, but if rent"
1994,SPIRIT.,"Would work like resurrection on the mind,"
1995,SPIRIT.,Bringing to life thoughts dead in doubt and error;
1996,SPIRIT.,"Thus, standing on the bridge of Time, which spans"
1997,SPIRIT.,The gulf 'twixt two eternities through which
1998,SPIRIT.,"Flows ever on the tide of human life,"
1999,SPIRIT.,"That troubled stream would seem a sea of glass,"
2000,SPIRIT.,And all its thick impurities appear
2001,SPIRIT.,Clear as the outline of a floating corpse;
2002,SPIRIT.,Gaze down upon it though it sicken thee.
2003,SPIRIT.,
2004,SPIRIT.,There cometh one beneath whose ermined pride
2005,SPIRIT.,"Stalks the corruption of a charnel-house,"
2006,SPIRIT.,"Where fest'ring flesh lies in its cloth of gold,"
2007,SPIRIT.,E'en yet the wonder of the gaping crowd.
2008,SPIRIT.,"Upon his brow the jewelled circlet rests,"
2009,SPIRIT.,His only title to nobility;
2010,SPIRIT.,"But that, unto the vulgar, symbols still"
2011,SPIRIT.,"The orbit of the everlasting sun,"
2012,SPIRIT.,That fills and glorifies a universe--of clay.
2013,SPIRIT.,"Where is the mind that should have overtopp'd,"
2014,SPIRIT.,"Saul-like, the level of the multitude?"
2015,SPIRIT.,Where the bold front that in the breach of wrong
2016,SPIRIT.,"Stemm'd the fierce current of insidious foes,"
2017,SPIRIT.,Flashing Truth's falchion in the van of Time?
2018,SPIRIT.,"Shame! it hath rusted in its scabbard, till"
2019,SPIRIT.,The nerveless arm can scarce withdraw it thence.
2020,SPIRIT.,O Earth! rejoice that at his side there comes
2021,SPIRIT.,An undimm'd light to beacon on the world;
2022,SPIRIT.,One who upholds the honour of his line
2023,SPIRIT.,Unsullied as the glory of the stars;
2024,SPIRIT.,"Whose voice rings clear above the battle strife,"
2025,SPIRIT.,And shakes oppression from his iron throne;
2026,SPIRIT.,"And for the purple, round his heaving breast"
2027,SPIRIT.,Folds like a vesture manly Honesty.
2028,SPIRIT.,Is it not glorious the light that gilds
2029,SPIRIT.,"The hoary summits of the giant hills,"
2030,SPIRIT.,Spread like the standard of eternal Truth
2031,SPIRIT.,O'er many phalanxed Ages--blazoning
2032,SPIRIT.,The stalwart band that barrier'd from the world
2033,SPIRIT.,The bitter fury of Heaven's huricanes!
2034,SPIRIT.,Onward there come a thick'ning mass who drown
2035,SPIRIT.,Defects and vices in a shower of gold;
2036,SPIRIT.,"Who crush report, like Rome the Sabine maid,"
2037,SPIRIT.,"Beneath the burden of their molten wealth,"
2038,SPIRIT.,And 'neath their gilding flaunt them in the sun
2039,SPIRIT.,Brightly as though there were no dross within;
2040,SPIRIT.,"So the eye sees them, but search thou the soul,"
2041,SPIRIT.,And part the sterling from the counterfeit.
2042,SPIRIT.,"Oh! for the sighing of the desolate,"
2043,SPIRIT.,"The widow and the orphan in their woe,"
2044,SPIRIT.,"Drown'd 'neath the clink of gold wrung from their need,"
2045,SPIRIT.,Like moisture from the crushing of the grape.
2046,SPIRIT.,"Oh! for the fruitless cry of misery,"
2047,SPIRIT.,"The Tantalus of stern reality,"
2048,SPIRIT.,"That feebly perisheth in Famine's grasp,"
2049,SPIRIT.,"Whilst plenty moulders for the lust of pride,"
2050,SPIRIT.,And adds its rottenness to the hot-bed
2051,SPIRIT.,Of wantonness and subtle infamy.
2052,SPIRIT.,And yet the worker wears as fair a port
2053,SPIRIT.,"As he whose life is holy Charity,"
2054,SPIRIT.,Setting his footprints on the way of life
2055,SPIRIT.,Like sunshine rippling o'er the summer sea.
2056,SPIRIT.,"Some wear their little merit on their sleeve,"
2057,SPIRIT.,"Which 'neath the friction of Time's troublous waves,"
2058,SPIRIT.,Grows threadbare as the coat of beggary.
2059,SPIRIT.,Some under rugged lineaments enclose
2060,SPIRIT.,"Treasures of truth and goodness, that like gems"
2061,SPIRIT.,"Shine through the fissures of the strong Time-quake,"
2062,SPIRIT.,"Showing more perfect as affliction works,"
2063,SPIRIT.,And sorrow rends the earthy covering.
2064,SPIRIT.,"Some are there with the sight turned inwards still,"
2065,SPIRIT.,"Beholding but the narrow sphere of self,"
2066,SPIRIT.,And trampling under foot the weak who stand
2067,SPIRIT.,Betwixt them and the goal of their desire.
2068,SPIRIT.,Blessed the few who unto fellow men
2069,SPIRIT.,"Turn with the fervent grasp of Brotherhood,"
2070,SPIRIT.,"Breasting the surges of tempestuous fate,"
2071,SPIRIT.,With souls fulfilled with kindliness and Faith--
2072,SPIRIT.,Raising the ensign of prophetic Hope
2073,SPIRIT.,Like the clear rainbow on the thunder-cloud;
2074,SPIRIT.,"And 'mid the darkness of impending care,"
2075,SPIRIT.,Pouring the cheerful daylight of the soul!
2076,SPIRIT.,"There are sweet spirits mingling with the throng,"
2077,SPIRIT.,"Marked out with sunshine, like the pouting waves"
2078,SPIRIT.,"When heaven looks down in sun and shadow, hearts"
2079,SPIRIT.,"So leaven'd through with grace and purity,"
2080,SPIRIT.,"That though sin warp and sift them at its will,"
2081,SPIRIT.,Some hidden sweetness lingers yet to tell
2082,SPIRIT.,The perfectness of Nature's handy-work.
2083,SPIRIT.,"Are they not as the ministers of heaven,"
2084,SPIRIT.,"Liveried with beauty, and deep tenderness,"
2085,SPIRIT.,Missioned in mercy to this fallen sphere
2086,SPIRIT.,Proclaiming peace and blessedness above;
2087,SPIRIT.,"Threading the ranks of Earth's fierce battle field,"
2088,SPIRIT.,"Amid the clangour of death-darting steel,"
2089,SPIRIT.,"Raising the wounded from their helplessness,"

3419,THE MAN.,"Evermore wander around it,"
3420,THE MAN.,"Like the vein'd tide through our members,"
3421,THE MAN.,"Quick with the blessings of beauty,"
3422,THE MAN.,"And health and verdurous pleasure,"
3423,THE MAN.,Filling with yellow sheaves
3424,THE MAN.,And plenty the bosom of Ceres;
3425,THE MAN.,"Calling forth flowers from the slumbering Earth,"
3426,THE MAN.,"Like thoughts from the dream of a Poet,"
3427,THE MAN.,"Till the island throughout is a garden,"
3428,THE MAN.,The child and the plaything of summer.
3429,THE MAN.,
3430,THE MAN.,[A] The principal mountain of Cyprus was thus named.
3431,THE MAN.,
3432,THE MAN.,In luscious clusters the fruit hangs
3433,THE MAN.,"In the sunshine, melting away"
3434,THE MAN.,From sweetness to sweetness.
3435,THE MAN.,"The grapes clust'ring 'mid leaves,"
3436,THE MAN.,That give their bright hue to the eye
3437,THE MAN.,Like the setting of rubies.
3438,THE MAN.,The nectarines and the pomegranates
3439,THE MAN.,"Glowing with crimson ripeness,"
3440,THE MAN.,And the orange trees with their blossoms
3441,THE MAN.,"Yielding sweet odour to every breeze,"
3442,THE MAN.,As the incense flows from the censer.
3443,THE MAN.,
3444,THE MAN.,"The air is languid with pleasure and love,"
3445,THE MAN.,"Lulling the sense to dreams Elysian,"
3446,THE MAN.,"Making life seem a glorious trance,"
3447,THE MAN.,"Full of bright visions of heaven,"
3448,THE MAN.,"Safe from the touch of reality,"
3449,THE MAN.,"Toil none--woe none--pain,"
3450,THE MAN.,Wild and illusive as sleep-revelations.
3451,THE MAN.,Time to be poured like wine from a chalice
3452,THE MAN.,"Sparkling and joyous for aye,"
3453,THE MAN.,"Drained amid mirth and music,"
3454,THE MAN.,"The brows circled with ivy,"
3455,THE MAN.,And the goblet at last like a gift
3456,THE MAN.,Thrust in the bosom of slumber.
3457,THE MAN.,
3458,THE MAN.,Thus are the people of Cyprus;
3459,THE MAN.,"Young men and old making holiday,"
3460,THE MAN.,Decking them daintily forth
3461,THE MAN.,In robes of Sidonian purple:
3462,THE MAN.,"The maidens all beauteous but wanton,"
3463,THE MAN.,"Foolishly flinging youth's gifts,"
3464,THE MAN.,"Its jewels--its richest adornment,"
3465,THE MAN.,Like dross on the altar of pleasure;
3466,THE MAN.,Letting the worm of mortality
3467,THE MAN.,Eat out their hearts till they bear
3468,THE MAN.,Only the semblance of angels.
3469,THE MAN.,
3470,THE MAN.,Amongst them like a gaunt and gnarlëd oak
3471,THE MAN.,"Waving majestic o'er a pigmy race,"
3472,THE MAN.,Pygmalion was; for by the mete of soul
3473,THE MAN.,Man ranges in the phalanx of his age.
3474,THE MAN.,"His heart was like an ocean, tremulous"
3475,THE MAN.,With radiant aspirations and high thoughts
3476,THE MAN.,"That fretted ever on mortality,"
3477,THE MAN.,"Wearing life out with passion and desire,"
3478,THE MAN.,"Struggling against the limits of the flesh,"
3479,THE MAN.,"The bonds and shackles of the Possible,"
3480,THE MAN.,"That bound him, like Prometheus, to the dust,"
3481,THE MAN.,And clogg'd the upward winging of his soul.
3482,THE MAN.,He walk'd 'mongst men like one who felt the strength
3483,THE MAN.,"Of nobler nature swelling in his breast,"
3484,THE MAN.,Eternal breathings fanning the Divine
3485,THE MAN.,Within him into flame and utterance.
3486,THE MAN.,"He spake not much, for that his heaving thoughts"
3487,THE MAN.,Yearn'd vainly for the living fire of heaven
3488,THE MAN.,To burn them through the soul-core of the Time;
3489,THE MAN.,But in the inner man the tumult sped
3490,THE MAN.,"In burning currents, like the ruddy streams"
3491,THE MAN.,From every pulse-beat of his o'er-fraught heart.
3492,THE MAN.,"His soul hung in an atmosphere of grace,"
3493,THE MAN.,"And beauty, midway betwixt earth and heaven,"
3494,THE MAN.,"Revolving, like the moon through azure space,"
3495,THE MAN.,"Mid starry fancies and faint orbëd dreams,"
3496,THE MAN.,That made bright land-marks in the spirit's flight.
3497,THE MAN.,Faint glimmerings of loveliness untold
3498,THE MAN.,"Flash'd ever on him in his solitudes,"
3499,THE MAN.,Luring him on to search and far pursuit
3500,THE MAN.,"Through empyrean altitudes of thought,"
3501,THE MAN.,Sped onward by the god-like thirst to grasp
3502,THE MAN.,"The spiritual, and with creative hand"
3503,THE MAN.,Mould it to corporal reality.
3504,THE MAN.,Love was his guiding star--his bright ideal
3505,THE MAN.,"Shining above all visions and all dreams,"
3506,THE MAN.,As doth the Pole-star o'er the icy North;
3507,THE MAN.,Love in its broad and fineless empery
3508,THE MAN.,"Ruling, directing all by right divine,"
3509,THE MAN.,"Pressing its seal of vassalage on thought,"
3510,THE MAN.,And crushing passion with relentless heel;
3511,THE MAN.,"Love--the refiner, whose alchymic art"
3512,THE MAN.,"Transmuteth very dross to purest gold,"
3513,THE MAN.,Passing emotion through the furnace heat
3514,THE MAN.,"That scorcheth up its perishable frame,"
3515,THE MAN.,And yields the essence purified for Act.
3516,THE MAN.,The soul that wanders like the mission'd dove
3517,THE MAN.,"Along the chaos waste of boundless thought,"
3518,THE MAN.,"Must have some ark to nestle in on Earth,"
3519,THE MAN.,And shelter from the endless Undefined.
3520,THE MAN.,"So to Eve's daughters would Pygmalion seek,"
3521,THE MAN.,Won by sweet hopes and promises of good
3522,THE MAN.,"And beauty, such as emblem'd to him still"
3523,THE MAN.,The end accomplish'd of aspiring thirst--
3524,THE MAN.,Essence and grace materialized. In them
3525,THE MAN.,"He saw the sum of Nature's perfectness,"
3526,THE MAN.,The acmè of idealism reach'd:
3527,THE MAN.,"Fair forms, smooth with the ruddy glow of health,"
3528,THE MAN.,"And ripening time, whose every motion seemed"
3529,THE MAN.,The wak'ning of ethereal gracefulness
3530,THE MAN.,"To life, and on whose lineaments the light"
3531,THE MAN.,Of a seraphic imagery play'd;
3532,THE MAN.,Forms lithe and rounded by the art of youth
3533,THE MAN.,"To be the shrines of spirit excellence,"
3534,THE MAN.,And hold the fusion of immortal grace
3535,THE MAN.,Unblemish'd by corporeal defect.
3536,THE MAN.,What found he then? Flower-wreathëd chalices
3537,THE MAN.,"Tinted with rosy dyes, bright elegance"
3538,THE MAN.,"Of shape and garniture, but brimming up"
3539,THE MAN.,Draughts bitter to the taste and nauseous.
3540,THE MAN.,"He gazed upon their beauty, which his soul"
3541,THE MAN.,"In thought had dower'd with purity and truth,"
3542,THE MAN.,As from the inward reflex of itself;
3543,THE MAN.,"But, gazing, all his visions pass'd away,"
3544,THE MAN.,And cold reality rose death-like up
3545,THE MAN.,To mow the aureate blossoms from his soul.
3546,THE MAN.,
3547,THE MAN.,In Amathus the chill grey morning dawn'd
3548,THE MAN.,"That woke him to truth's ruggedness, and left"
3549,THE MAN.,"Life struggling, joyless, sunless, to its goal."
3550,THE MAN.,"Woman stood forth before him beautiful,"
3551,THE MAN.,"But mocking heaven with a shameless brow,"
3552,THE MAN.,"Wearing foul lewdness like a victor's crown,"
3553,THE MAN.,And dashing virtue's elixir away.
3554,THE MAN.,From the deep fountains of her eyes there flow'd
3555,THE MAN.,"No lucid streams of holiness and love,"
3556,THE MAN.,"But lust and utter wantonness, that fill'd"
3557,THE MAN.,"The heart with loathing, fraught with death to Hope."
3558,THE MAN.,Her crimson lips shed forth no silvery strains
3559,THE MAN.,Of gentleness and peace to hymn life's bark
3560,THE MAN.,"Across the heaving waters of this Time,"
3561,THE MAN.,But folly and discordant revelry
3562,THE MAN.,"Sounded around her evermore, and woo'd"
3563,THE MAN.,To sin and shame with notes once toned for heaven.
3564,THE MAN.,"No Priestess she of lovely innocence,"
3565,THE MAN.,"Stoled for the work with beauty nigh divine,"
3566,THE MAN.,"But, warping all her natal destiny,"
3567,THE MAN.,"Prostrate she lay before the shrine of vice,"
3568,THE MAN.,Yielding herself a living sacrifice
3569,THE MAN.,To the deep blasting of the idol's breath.
3570,THE MAN.,
3571,THE MAN.,The heart clings fondly to the last faint hope
3572,THE MAN.,"That bindeth still the once dear to its love,"
3573,THE MAN.,"Rejecting credence whilst a doubt remains,"
3574,THE MAN.,"And so Pygmalion. Thought he, 'tis a phase"
3575,THE MAN.,"Through which her soul doth pass, like rippling streams"
3576,THE MAN.,"That filter for a space through earth's deep pores,"
3577,THE MAN.,"Emerging thence more pure and bright than erst,"
3578,THE MAN.,And set himself with patient love to watch
3579,THE MAN.,"The giddy current of her blinded soul,"
3580,THE MAN.,For the subsidence of its troubled waves.
3581,THE MAN.,
3582,THE MAN.,"It came not; till his spirit sick'ning o'er,"
3583,THE MAN.,Pour'd forth its bitterness and wounded sense.
3584,THE MAN.,"""Oh! living lie! truth's outward counterfeit!"
3585,THE MAN.,Fair masquerade of virtue's unknown charms!
3586,THE MAN.,Thou too hast perish'd from my trusting soul;
3587,THE MAN.,"Thy beauty yet endureth, the fair sweep"
3588,THE MAN.,"Of limb and rounded form, such as my art"
3589,THE MAN.,Can yield the senseless marble; but the soul
3590,THE MAN.,"That made the work of heaven stand forth alone,"
3591,THE MAN.,"So peerless in its radiant loveliness,"
3592,THE MAN.,"Hath perished 'neath mortality's cold grasp,"
3593,THE MAN.,And yielded up the patent of its charm.
3594,THE MAN.,"Henceforth I can compete with Heaven, and fill"
3595,THE MAN.,"My world with bright creations as its own,"
3596,THE MAN.,"Unmarr'd by inner loathsomeness and sin,"
3597,THE MAN.,That rushing through its pulses like a blight
3598,THE MAN.,"Make beauty hideous. Thou, my soul, return,"
3599,THE MAN.,"Sit on thy throne, and with creative might"
3600,THE MAN.,"People thy kingdom with a beauteous race,"
3601,THE MAN.,"Fair form'd, and nobly featured, and the life"
3602,THE MAN.,"Set undulating on the Parian,"
3603,THE MAN.,"Whom viewing, thou may'st cry with lofty joy,"
3604,THE MAN.,'Behold the life without its baser part.'
3605,THE MAN.,"O Beauty! I have loved thee with full heart,"
3606,THE MAN.,Follow'd thy shadowy guidance as the cloud
3607,THE MAN.,Sails at the unseen steering of the wind;
3608,THE MAN.,"Sought thee in Heaven and Earth and Nature all,"
3609,THE MAN.,"Led by supreme adorings and desires,"
3610,THE MAN.,"Till by communion with thy perfect soul,"
3611,THE MAN.,"Mine hath grown wise, in measure, to discern."
3612,THE MAN.,Not now can I be satiate with grace
3613,THE MAN.,That gildeth but the superficial frame
3614,THE MAN.,With the false tissue of deep-seeming life;
3615,THE MAN.,"The searching knife must pierce into the heart,"
3616,THE MAN.,And shew a frame veined with the same warm stream
3617,THE MAN.,That melts in blushes on the downy cheek.
3618,THE MAN.,"My bright ideal, like the bow of heaven,"
3619,THE MAN.,"Hath faded into nothingness, and made"
3620,THE MAN.,A blank upon the clouded sky of life.
3621,THE MAN.,Can my soul live and love not?
3622,THE MAN.,
3623,THE MAN.,"""I will call"
3624,THE MAN.,"Art my divinity, and bid her frame"
3625,THE MAN.,New joys to cherish such as Earth hath not
3626,THE MAN.,Create by natural developement;
3627,THE MAN.,"Nature shall be my monitress, and teach"
3628,THE MAN.,"The chisel knowledge of all loveliness,"
3629,THE MAN.,"That wrought upon the snowy Parian,"
3630,THE MAN.,"Shall give investiture of life's pure part,"
3631,THE MAN.,"Grace, ease, and motion's unexerted power."
3632,THE MAN.,"Better no soul than one debauched and foul,"
3633,THE MAN.,And shaming beauty with eternal blots;
3634,THE MAN.,Therefore my creature shall be beautiful
3635,THE MAN.,With all that makes up woman's excellence;
3636,THE MAN.,"Youth's bloom imprinted on her gentle charms,"
3637,THE MAN.,"And tenderness set playing on her lips,"
3638,THE MAN.,Whilst round her gracious presence for a robe
3639,THE MAN.,Shall float the vesture of pure modesty;
3640,THE MAN.,"A woman, she, save in the fallen soul,"
3641,THE MAN.,"A spotless angel framed, but spiritless;"
3642,THE MAN.,"This being shall I mould, and with my love"
3643,THE MAN.,"Animate to ideal consciousness,"
3644,THE MAN.,"Then let her sisterhood pass humbled on,"
3645,THE MAN.,"Unheeded in the depth of my content."""

3650,THE WORKER.,THE WORKER.
3651,THE WORKER.,
3652,THE WORKER.,"Forth went he from the ebb and flow of men,"
3653,THE WORKER.,"Whose busy vortex drowneth quiet thought,"
3654,THE WORKER.,To hold communion with wise Nature's soul
3655,THE WORKER.,"In solitude. Amongst lone woods he roamed,"
3656,THE WORKER.,Listing the murmurs of the swaying boughs
3657,THE WORKER.,"That quivered with the spirit of the breeze,"
3658,THE WORKER.,"Threading their archëd aisles with solemn heart,"
3659,THE WORKER.,And hiving in his soul a myriad thoughts
3660,THE WORKER.,That fell unseen upon him. Oft he stood
3661,THE WORKER.,"On mountain fronts, and gazed long hours away,"
3662,THE WORKER.,"Tracing the sweep of hill and dale, now veined"
3663,THE WORKER.,"With glistening waters, and now dark with groves,"
3664,THE WORKER.,"Still changing till sight lost identity,"
3665,THE WORKER.,And the ideal and the real met.
3666,THE WORKER.,He saw the sun enter the golden gates
3667,THE WORKER.,"Of Night, that closed upon his radiant path,"
3668,THE WORKER.,And left Earth wondering; and star by star
3669,THE WORKER.,"Unlid their shining orbs, and o'er heaven's plain"
3670,THE WORKER.,Wheel their bright cars to greet him in the East.
3671,THE WORKER.,"He saw the morn break beautiful and pure,"
3672,THE WORKER.,"Like virgin from her slumbers, and robe earth"
3673,THE WORKER.,"In dewy brightness, cresting the far hills"
3674,THE WORKER.,With glorious halos of oncoming day.
3675,THE WORKER.,"All loveliness of earth and sky he sought,"
3676,THE WORKER.,"And pondered with a heart attent to learn,"
3677,THE WORKER.,"Knowing that Beauty, like a parent stream,"
3678,THE WORKER.,Is nourished by each trickling rill that flows
3679,THE WORKER.,Into it; and the soul that would be apt
3680,THE WORKER.,"To work its highest counsels out, must toil"
3681,THE WORKER.,"Through long apprentice-ship to mastery,"
3682,THE WORKER.,By units gath'ring fitness for the whole.
3683,THE WORKER.,
3684,THE WORKER.,"Thus did he, till with spirit brimming up"
3685,THE WORKER.,"With glorious inspiration, he returned,"
3686,THE WORKER.,And set the god-like in him to create;
3687,THE WORKER.,"His swelling soul grew patient to the work,"
3688,THE WORKER.,"Wise with the sense of innate potency,"
3689,THE WORKER.,And on the shapeless marble still he wrought
3690,THE WORKER.,With faith and firm assurance.
3691,THE WORKER.,Many came
3692,THE WORKER.,"Amid their aimless wanderings, and stood"
3693,THE WORKER.,"Beside that quiet worker, wondering"
3694,THE WORKER.,"At the majestic purpose on his brow,"
3695,THE WORKER.,"And vapouring forth their self-important views,"
3696,THE WORKER.,That turned his course as little as the air
3697,THE WORKER.,Swerveth the eagle in his lightning flight.
3698,THE WORKER.,Many applauded with patronic warmth
3699,THE WORKER.,"And empty commendation, and no scorn"
3700,THE WORKER.,"Curled his proud lip, not one defiant word"
3701,THE WORKER.,Echoed their nothings into transient life.
3702,THE WORKER.,But as the marble grew beneath his hands
3703,THE WORKER.,"To shape and comeliness, his soul-deep eyes"
3704,THE WORKER.,"Flashed with the joy of high accomplishment,"
3705,THE WORKER.,And scanned each valiant critic with a glance
3706,THE WORKER.,That sifted all his littleness away.
3707,THE WORKER.,
3708,THE WORKER.,"Thus did he till his work stood perfected,"
3709,THE WORKER.,"A woman beautiful with youth and grace,"
3710,THE WORKER.,But like a Vestal singled from her sex
3711,THE WORKER.,To show the beauty of pure innocence.
3712,THE WORKER.,Her form was such as rapt Endymion
3713,THE WORKER.,Saw on the heights of Latmos when he slept
3714,THE WORKER.,And dreamed Heaven down to him. A glorious shape
3715,THE WORKER.,That to the brightness of ethereal charms
3716,THE WORKER.,Join'd the familiar sweetness of a maid;
3717,THE WORKER.,A soft clear forehead circled by the light
3718,THE WORKER.,That heaven sets lambent on its imaged self;
3719,THE WORKER.,A face that beaming on the heart of man
3720,THE WORKER.,As by a silent teaching in the sense
3721,THE WORKER.,Makes goodness natural. Upon each limb
3722,THE WORKER.,"Grace laid its sweet commandment lovingly,"
3723,THE WORKER.,"Whilst the fair bosom glowed with tenderness,"
3724,THE WORKER.,"As from the fulness of a soul beneath,"
3725,THE WORKER.,Woman's divinest attribute possessed
3726,THE WORKER.,Unsullied and entire; and through the frame
3727,THE WORKER.,And every feature radiating went
3728,THE WORKER.,A lovely sense of gentleness and love.
3729,THE WORKER.,
3730,THE WORKER.,"Bright is the summer of Cyprus,"
3731,THE WORKER.,"Undimm'd the skies and clear,"
3732,THE WORKER.,Blue and clear as a maiden's eyes
3733,THE WORKER.,That loves and hath never felt sadness.
3734,THE WORKER.,"Then, Time is a sunlit river"
3735,THE WORKER.,Flowing 'mid flowers and green pastures
3736,THE WORKER.,Brightly onward to heaven!
3737,THE WORKER.,"There is music pervading the air,"
3738,THE WORKER.,"Music of voice and of instrument,"
3739,THE WORKER.,And the silver toning of laughters
3740,THE WORKER.,Blendeth in jubilant chorus;
3741,THE WORKER.,Bands of maidens and youths
3742,THE WORKER.,"With flowing garments of purple,"
3743,THE WORKER.,And zones jewelled and bright
3744,THE WORKER.,"As the mystic girdle of Venus,"
3745,THE WORKER.,"Wreathëd with myrtle and roses,"
3746,THE WORKER.,And their beauty wantonly bared
3747,THE WORKER.,"To the swimming glances of passion,"
3748,THE WORKER.,"Evermore sweep o'er the pathways,"
3749,THE WORKER.,Strewing sweet flowers as they go
3750,THE WORKER.,To the sacred altars of Venus
3751,THE WORKER.,"'Neath the feet of the snow-white kine,"
3752,THE WORKER.,That must bleed at the shrine of the goddess;
3753,THE WORKER.,"Care is forgotten, for life"
3754,THE WORKER.,Hath no aim and no mission but pleasure;
3755,THE WORKER.,"Its cup is a foretaste of Paradise,"
3756,THE WORKER.,"Drain the sweet draught to the dregs,"
3757,THE WORKER.,The fountain will flow on for ever!
3758,THE WORKER.,'Tis the feast day of Venus--Hail! Hail!
3759,THE WORKER.,
3760,THE WORKER.,"Pygmalion stood beside his master-piece,"
3761,THE WORKER.,Still with his mind devote to mighty thoughts
3762,THE WORKER.,"And busy inspiration, for through Time"
3763,THE WORKER.,"The worker must be constant to his toil,"
3764,THE WORKER.,Heedless of pleasure and the idle toys
3765,THE WORKER.,For which man bartereth eternity;
3766,THE WORKER.,"Life is his seed-time, after life his rest."
3767,THE WORKER.,"Had he not joyed to scan that lovely form,"
3768,THE WORKER.,"And mark each glorious lineament, that held"
3769,THE WORKER.,A model up to Nature of pure grace
3770,THE WORKER.,Unblemished by the shadow of a fault?
3771,THE WORKER.,Had he not loved with more than Artist soul
3772,THE WORKER.,"The beauteous creature of his heaven-drawn power,"
3773,THE WORKER.,And oped again the flood-gates of his heart
3774,THE WORKER.,To the full current of humanity?
3775,THE WORKER.,"Had he not thanked the gods for victory,"
3776,THE WORKER.,And gloried in his strength with conscious might
3777,THE WORKER.,That made e'en fame his fellow? Yet he stood
3778,THE WORKER.,Silent and sad beside his finished work.
3779,THE WORKER.,What lacked he yet? Life! life! for his creation:
3780,THE WORKER.,"""What have I wrought,"" he uttered, ""what achieved?"
3781,THE WORKER.,"Naught! naught! my power hath wasted on a stone,"
3782,THE WORKER.,"Changed its rude seeming haply unto grace,"
3783,THE WORKER.,"But as it was, so is it now, mere stone;"
3784,THE WORKER.,"My beauteous image, emblem of my soul,"
3785,THE WORKER.,"Cast in the mould of thought's supremest good,"
3786,THE WORKER.,"Fairer than all of womankind on Earth,"
3787,THE WORKER.,Is yet more worthless and more transient
3788,THE WORKER.,Than is the meanest wretch who feels the life
3789,THE WORKER.,Throb quenchlessly within him. Time may strew
3790,THE WORKER.,"Its fragments blindly o'er the face of Earth,"
3791,THE WORKER.,"Scatter its spotless beauties, yet pass on"
3792,THE WORKER.,And leave the world no poorer than it was.
3793,THE WORKER.,There is no beauty separate from soul;
3794,THE WORKER.,From it as from a spring flow all the streams
3795,THE WORKER.,That clothe this dust with living loveliness
3796,THE WORKER.,Else doomed to deep aridity and death.
3797,THE WORKER.,O lovely daughter of my craving soul!
3798,THE WORKER.,Hope of my life! Divinest shape of Earth!
3799,THE WORKER.,Can I regard thy beauty thus and know
3800,THE WORKER.,Thou art the empty semblance of a worthless thing.
3801,THE WORKER.,Are those sweet charms where loveliness hath set
3802,THE WORKER.,"The limits of her potency, mere dust"
3803,THE WORKER.,"Unnobled by the passage of a soul,"
3804,THE WORKER.,"Rescued a moment from the senseless mass,"
3805,THE WORKER.,That soon again shall have thee for its own?
3806,THE WORKER.,What hath my soul begotten? Death in life--
3807,THE WORKER.,"A child of Earth unblessed, unstamped of heaven."
3808,THE WORKER.,First-fruit of Spirit love! is this thy fate?
3809,THE WORKER.,"Gods! hear me from your thrones! Must it be so?"""
3810,THE WORKER.,Forth sped he.
3811,THE WORKER.,"Like a stream that is swayed in the sunlight,"
3812,THE WORKER.,"Breaking in flashes of brightness,"
3813,THE WORKER.,The people of Cyprus were gathered
3814,THE WORKER.,Around the temple of Venus;
3815,THE WORKER.,Mirth and music ascended.
3816,THE WORKER.,"Amid the fumes of the incense,"
3817,THE WORKER.,Loud as when pleasure hath knocked
3818,THE WORKER.,On a heart that is hollow and empty.
3819,THE WORKER.,"Maidens rejoiced in their shame,"
3820,THE WORKER.,"And fancied their lewdness devotion,"
3821,THE WORKER.,"Banishing thought from their bosoms,"

4270,RETROSPECTION.,Did I shame them that rejoicing in the freedom of my spirit

4280,RETROSPECTION.,
4281,RETROSPECTION.,"What were they with all their lordship, all their riches,"

4288,RETROSPECTION.,
4289,RETROSPECTION.,Oh! I felt a high compassion for their warp'd and narrow feelings
4290,RETROSPECTION.,"As I press'd my bride unto me, and read o'er her gentle eyes,"
4291,RETROSPECTION.,"Gaining deeper insight daily, meeting ever new revealings"
4292,RETROSPECTION.,"Of the grace of woman's spirit, and her holy sympathies."
4293,RETROSPECTION.,
4294,RETROSPECTION.,"So we pilgrim'd on together, buffeting the ills about us,"
4295,RETROSPECTION.,"Sharing hope, and joy, and sorrow, as we shared our daily bread,"
4296,RETROSPECTION.,"Keeping still a pleasaunce scathless in our hearts, though all"

4303,RETROSPECTION.,Glide amid the high and noble with a grace beyond their own.
4304,RETROSPECTION.,
4305,RETROSPECTION.,"And those proud ones now are gracious, bowing fawningly before her,"
4306,RETROSPECTION.,Whilst she with her true eyes calmly takes the measure of their

4308,RETROSPECTION.,"Weighs aright the honied speeches, and the praise they heap upon"
4309,RETROSPECTION.,"her,"
4310,RETROSPECTION.,Her own innocence instinctively disarming all their arts.
4311,RETROSPECTION.,
4312,RETROSPECTION.,"For she knows their tongues are venal, sold to flatter wealth and"

4314,RETROSPECTION.,"And to crouch with serpent homage in the dust at Fortune's shrine,"
4315,RETROSPECTION.,"Ready to revile and slander if calamity should lower,"
4316,RETROSPECTION.,"And to flout as base, deceitful, what they late had termed divine."
4317,RETROSPECTION.,
4318,RETROSPECTION.,Thus unmask'd and sifted throughly let them stoop and fawn at
4319,RETROSPECTION.,"pleasure,"
4320,RETROSPECTION.,Little reck I to revenge me better for their former spite

5458,IV.,That murmur with the linnets and at e'en
5459,IV.,"Sigh with the plaintive nightingale, and oft"
5460,IV.,"Mirror your bright eyes in the sparkling dew,"

5493,VI.,Of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn;
5494,VI.,"Down your deep-furrow'd slopes let torrents dash,"
5495,VI.,And on the winds their hollow rage be borne.
5496,VI.,"Ye mighty ones! Why should ye bow your pride,"
