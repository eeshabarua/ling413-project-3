95,THE DARK AGES,THE DARK AGES
96,THE DARK AGES,
97,THE DARK AGES,
98,THE DARK AGES,MEN call you “dark.”  What factory then blurred the light
99,THE DARK AGES,"Of golden suns, when nothing blacker than the shades"
100,THE DARK AGES,Of coming rain climbed up the heather-mantled height?
101,THE DARK AGES,While the air
102,THE DARK AGES,"Breathed all the scents of all untrodden flowers,"
103,THE DARK AGES,"And brooks poured silver through the glimmering glades,"
104,THE DARK AGES,Then sweetly wound through virgin ground.
105,THE DARK AGES,Must all that beauty pass?
106,THE DARK AGES,And must our pleasure trains
107,THE DARK AGES,Like foul eruptions belch upon the mountain head?
108,THE DARK AGES,"Must we perforce build vulgar villa lanes,"
109,THE DARK AGES,And on sweet fields of grass
110,THE DARK AGES,The canting scutcheons of a cheating commerce spread?
111,THE DARK AGES,
112,THE DARK AGES,"Men call you “dark.”  Did that faith see with cobwebbed eyes,"
113,THE DARK AGES,"That built the airy octagon on Ely’s hill,"
114,THE DARK AGES,"And Gloucester’s Eastern wall that woos the topaz skies,"
115,THE DARK AGES,Where the hymn
116,THE DARK AGES,"Angelic “Glory be to God on high,"
117,THE DARK AGES,"And peace on earth to men who feel good will,”"
118,THE DARK AGES,Might softly sound God’s throne around?
119,THE DARK AGES,Is that a perfect faith
120,THE DARK AGES,"Which pew-filled chapels rears,"
121,THE DARK AGES,"Where Gothic fronts of stone mask backs of ill-baked bricks,"
122,THE DARK AGES,"And where the frothy fighting preacher fears,"
123,THE DARK AGES,"As peasants fear a wraith,"
124,THE DARK AGES,His deacon’s frown or some just change in politics?
125,THE DARK AGES,
126,THE DARK AGES,"Men call you “dark.”  Was Chaucer’s speech a muddy stream,"
127,THE DARK AGES,The language born of Norman sun and Saxon snow?
128,THE DARK AGES,Was Langland’s verse or Wyclif’s prose mere glow-worm’s gleam?
129,THE DARK AGES,And the tales
130,THE DARK AGES,"Of Arthur’s sword and of the holy Grail,"
131,THE DARK AGES,"And Avalon, the isle where no storms blow:"
132,THE DARK AGES,From such romance did no light glance?
133,THE DARK AGES,"Have we not heard a tongue,"
134,THE DARK AGES,Whose words the Saxon thralls
135,THE DARK AGES,"Would scorn to speak above their muck-rake and their fork,"
136,THE DARK AGES,"The speech of barrack-rooms and music-halls,"
137,THE DARK AGES,Where every fool has flung
138,THE DARK AGES,The rotten refuse of Calcutta and New York?
139,THE DARK AGES,
140,THE DARK AGES,Men call you “dark.”  But _chivalry_ and _honour_ stand
141,THE DARK AGES,"As words that you, not we, did fashion, when the need"
142,THE DARK AGES,Of food beyond the price of gold awoke our land.
143,THE DARK AGES,For you taught
144,THE DARK AGES,Inconstancy is like a standard lost;
145,THE DARK AGES,And we who prove untrue in love or deed
146,THE DARK AGES,Will doubly shame an ancient name.
147,THE DARK AGES,"Your robes were not all white,"
148,THE DARK AGES,Your soul was not a sea
149,THE DARK AGES,Where all the crystal rivulets of God found room:
150,THE DARK AGES,"But we must often to your lessons flee,"
151,THE DARK AGES,"Our truth with yours unite,"
152,THE DARK AGES,Before we meet the holy dayspring of the doom.

161,THE BELLS OF VENICE,"RING out again that faltering strain,"
162,THE BELLS OF VENICE,"Cease not so soon,"
163,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Sweet peal that brought to me the thought
164,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Of some deep shadowed English lane
165,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Across the blue lagoon.
166,THE BELLS OF VENICE,
167,THE BELLS OF VENICE,The water street where oarsmen meet
168,THE BELLS OF VENICE,"And shout ahead,"
169,THE BELLS OF VENICE,"The glowing quay, all noise and glee,"
170,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Seemed hallowed as when angels’ feet
171,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Touched Jacob’s stony bed.
172,THE BELLS OF VENICE,
173,THE BELLS OF VENICE,On pearly dome and princely home
174,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Day’s glory dies:
175,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Once more the bells’ low murmur tells
176,THE BELLS OF VENICE,That faith is not a line of foam
177,THE BELLS OF VENICE,Nor life a bridge of sighs.

1951,LETHE,"And slowly break,"
