74,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!","ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!"
75,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",
76,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",Walt Mason's poetry is in a class by itself.  Although having the
77,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",appearance of prose the rhythm is perfect and the philosophy that runs
78,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",through his lines is illumined by an irresistible humor.  There is a
79,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",quaintness about his style that makes his writings a continuing delight.
80,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",
81,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",I began to read Walt twenty-five years ago and although he has drawn
82,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",upon his intellectual store constantly for more than a quarter of a
83,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",century the fountain of his genius still is flowing with undiminished
84,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",volume and the waters are as pure as in the idealistic days of his
85,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",youth.
86,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",
87,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",I have shared the satisfaction that his increasing fame has brought him
88,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!","and have encouraged him to publish this collection that his readers,"
89,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!","now numbering people of many lands, may have permanent companionship"
90,"ONE MOMENT, PLEASE!",with him.

317,THE STRONG MEN,No hale man ever loves him; he stirs the sportsman's wrath; the whole

319,THE STRONG MEN,"love a duffer so pallid, weak and thin, who seems resigned to suffer"
320,THE STRONG MEN,and let folks rub it in?  Yet though he's down to zero in fellow-men's

364,THE POOR MAN'S CLUB,"where never a soul is bored.  We recklessly squander our minted brawn,"

373,WORDS AND DEEDS,A fire broke out in Bildad's shack and burned it to the ground; and
374,WORDS AND DEEDS,"Bildad, with his roofless pack, sent up a doleful sound.  And I, who"
375,WORDS AND DEEDS,"lived the next door west, hard by the county jail, went over there and"
376,WORDS AND DEEDS,"beat my breast, and helped poor Bildad wail.  Around the ruined home I"
377,WORDS AND DEEDS,"stepped, and viewed the shaking walls, and people say the way I wept"
378,WORDS AND DEEDS,would beat Niagara Falls.  Then words of sympathy I dealt to Bildad and
379,WORDS AND DEEDS,"his wife; such kindly words, I've always felt, nerve people for the"
380,WORDS AND DEEDS,"strife.  If I can kill with words your fears, or argue grief away, or"
381,WORDS AND DEEDS,"drown your woe by shedding tears, call on me any day.  I have a"
382,WORDS AND DEEDS,"sympathetic heart that bleeds for others' aches, and I will ease your"
383,WORDS AND DEEDS,pain and smart unless the language breaks.  And so to Bildad and his
384,WORDS AND DEEDS,"mate I made a helpful talk, with vital truths that elevate and break"
385,WORDS AND DEEDS,disasters' shock; I pointed out that stricken men should not yield to
386,WORDS AND DEEDS,"the worst, but from the wreckage rise again like flame from torch"

2422,THE OPEN ROAD,
2423,THE OPEN ROAD,To walk again the open road I have a springtime longing; I yearn to
2424,THE OPEN ROAD,"leave my town abode, the jostling and the thronging, and tread again"
2425,THE OPEN ROAD,"the quiet lanes, among the woodland creatures; where birds are singing"
2426,THE OPEN ROAD,joyous strains to beat the music teachers.  Afar from honks of motor
2427,THE OPEN ROAD,"cars, and all the city's clamor, I'd like to sleep beneath the stars,"
2428,THE OPEN ROAD,"and feel no katzenjammer when in the vernal dawn I wake, as chipper as"
2429,THE OPEN ROAD,"the foxes, to eat my frugal oatmeal cake put up in paper boxes.  I fain"
2430,THE OPEN ROAD,"would revel in the breeze that blows across the clover, and drink from"
2431,THE OPEN ROAD,"brooks, with stately trees, like Druids, bending over.  I'd leave the"
2432,THE OPEN ROAD,"pavement and the wall, the too persistent neighbor, and hear the"
2433,THE OPEN ROAD,rooster's early call that wakes the world to labor.  I'd seek the
2434,THE OPEN ROAD,"hayfields whose perfume the jaded heart doth nourish, I'd go where"
2435,THE OPEN ROAD,wayside roses bloom and johnny-jump-ups flourish.  I'd see the pasture
2436,THE OPEN ROAD,"flecked with sheep and mule and colt and heifer, and let my spirit lie"
2437,THE OPEN ROAD,"asleep upon the twilight zephyr.  Oh, town, I leave you for a week,"
2438,THE OPEN ROAD,your burdens and your duties!  The country calls me--I must seek its
2439,THE OPEN ROAD,glories and its beauties!

2443,THE OPEN ROAD,Gee whiz!  I'd give a million bones to be back home a-sleeping!  My

2445,THE OPEN ROAD,"night I sought a stack of hay, where slumber's fetters bound me, and at"
2446,THE OPEN ROAD,"the cold, bleak break of day a husky farmer found me.  I tried to"
2447,THE OPEN ROAD,"pacify his nibs when he stood there and blessed me; alas, his pitchfork"
2448,THE OPEN ROAD,"smote my ribs, his cowhide shoes caressed me.  The dogs throughout this"
2449,THE OPEN ROAD,countryside all seem to think they need me; they've gathered samples of
2450,THE OPEN ROAD,"my hide, and many times they've treed me.  And when I roamed the"
2451,THE OPEN ROAD,"woodland path to see the wild-flowers' tinting, a bull pursued me in"
2452,THE OPEN ROAD,its wrath and broke all records sprinting.  At noontide I sat down to
2453,THE OPEN ROAD,"rest, and rose depressed and dizzy; I'd sat upon a hornet's nest, and"
2454,THE OPEN ROAD,"all the birds got busy.  My whiskers now are full of hay, my legs are"
2455,THE OPEN ROAD,"lame and weary; it's been a-raining every day, and all the world is"
2456,THE OPEN ROAD,dreary.  The road will do for those who like a pathway rough and
2457,THE OPEN ROAD,gritty; I've had enough--just watch me hike back to the good old city.
