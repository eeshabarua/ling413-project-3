78,THE OLD HANGING FORK.,THE OLD HANGING FORK. 
79,I.,I. 
80,I.,"O don't you remember those days so divine, Around which the heart-strings all tenderly twine, When with sapling pole and a painted cork We fished up and down the old Hanging Fork-- From the railroad bridge, with its single span, Clear down to the mill at Dawson's old dam-- From early morn till the shades of night, And it made no difference if fish _didn't_ bite? "
81,II.,II. 
82,II.,"What pleasure it gives to think and to dream Of those long, happy days, and the old winding stream, When we waded the creek with our pants to the knee, And got our lines tangled in a sycamore tree, And were most scared to death when out from the root The long, wriggling snake through the water did shoot, And you lost your line, your hook and your cork, And I slipped and fell in the old Hanging Fork! "
83,III.,III. 
84,III.,"The years they have come, and the years they have fled, And frosted with silver the hairs of the head, But still in fond memory there lingers the joy Of scenes such as these, when a bare-footed boy I wandered away to the clear rippling stream-- No cankering care to trouble life's dream;-- And we spit on our bait and in whispers we'd talk, As we threw out our lines in the old Hanging Fork! "
85,IV.,IV. 
86,IV.,"We sat there and fished with the sun beaming down On the tops of our heads through hats minus crown, And when I got a bite or you caught a perch We'd just give our lines a thundering lurch, And land him high up on the bank in the weeds, Then string him along with the pumpkin seeds! O don't you remember the hot, dusky walk, Along the white pike to the old Hanging Fork? "
87,SWEET SEPTEMBER DAYS.,SWEET SEPTEMBER DAYS. 
88,I.,I. 
89,I.,"There's a something in the atmosphere, in sweet September days, That mantles all the landscape with its languid, dreamy haze; And you see the leaves a-dropping, in a lazy kind of way, Where the maple trees are standing in their Summer-time array. "
90,II.,II. 
91,II.,"There's a yellowish tinge a-creeping over Nature's emerald sheen, And the cattle stand, half-sleeping, in the middle of the stream Where the glassy pool is shaded by the overhanging limb, And the pebbly bottom's glinting where the silvery minnows swim. "
92,III.,III. 
93,III.,"The tasseled corn is nodding, and the crow on drowsy wing Is sailing o'er the orchard where the ripening apples swing, And the fleecy clouds are floating in the azure of the sky, And the gentle breeze is sighing as it's idly wafted by. "
94,IV.,IV. 
95,IV.,"The cantaloupes are ripening in their yellow golden rinds; And the melons, round and juicy, are a-clinging to the vines; And the merry, laughing children, in their happy hour of play, Are a-romping in the meadow and a-sliding down the hay. "
96,V.,V. 
97,V.,"The busy bees are buzzing where the grapes with purple blush, And the hanging bunches tempting with their weight the arbor crush, And the blue jays are a-wrangling in the wood across the road, Where the hickory boughs are bending 'neath an extra heavy load. "
98,VI.,VI. 
99,VI.,"Let your poets keep a-singing about the Springtime gay, And the blossoms and the flowers in the merry month of May-- But the early Autumn splendor, with its sweet September days, Eclipses boasted Springtime in a thousand kind of ways! "
100,YER OLD COB PIPE.,YER OLD COB PIPE. 
101,I.,I. 
102,I.,"When the chilling winds of Winter come a-knocking at the door, And the fleecy flakes are flying and the earth is covered o'er, And you've supped on sweet potatoes and a 'possum frosted ripe, Then glory hallelujah! Git yer Old Cob Pipe! "
103,II.,II. 
104,II.,"When the fire is blazing brightly and the room is snug and warm, And you've left your cares and troubles on the outside with the storm, And your natural leaf is colored with a golden yellow stripe, Then glory hallelujah! Git yer Old Cob Pipe! "
105,III.,III. 
106,III.,"When the old split-bottom rocker is far better than a throne, And the visions of the fancy are the fairest earth has known, And you watch the mystic shapes that the dancing shadows write, Then glory hallelujah! Git yer Old Cob Pipe! "
107,IV.,IV. 
108,IV.,"When your dressing gown and slippers might be envied by a king, And the voices of the children sound as sweet as birds' that sing, And the feelings that possess you are all of heavenly type, Then glory hallelujah! Git yer Old Cob Pipe! "
109,V.,V. 
110,V.,"When the ringlets aromatic have circled round your head, And a drowsiness o'ertakes you, and you want to go to bed, And the bowlful that you're smoking has burned to ashes white, Then glory hallelujah! Quit yer Old Cob Pipe! "
111,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM. 
112,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"'Twas a place of fifty acres, in a lonely neighborhood, And near a grove of somber pines the shackly farm-house stood; And all the folks, for miles around, did solemnly declare That ghosts and goblins horrible held nightly revel there. "
113,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"They said the house was ""hanted,"" and that not a man alive, In all the country round about, could own the place and thrive; That the cattle died with fever, and the hogs the cholera took-- And every one that tried it wore a mighty troubled look. "
114,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"But they put it up at auction, and Tim Bluster bid the most, Who always said ""There want no hants nor any kind of ghost That ever walked a graveyard in the middle of the night Could make _his_ nerves unsteady, or could fill _him_ with affright!"" "
115,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"So Tim got full possession, and he moved out to his home, And the first night, as he sat there, within his room alone, The door was softly opened, and a cat came walking in, With eyes like balls of fire and a coat as black as sin. "
116,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"Then squatting on its haunches, it said, in tones polite, ""There seems to be but two of us to stay in here to-night!"" Tim muttered in a trembling voice, as for the door he run, ""Perhaps _you_ think there will be two, but darn me, there's but one!"" "
117,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"Tim staid away the blessed night, but when the daylight came, It brought him back his courage, and it filled him full of shame; And then he said, unto himself, ""There wasn't any cat Could make him leave that room again--he'd bet his life on that!"" "
118,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"So when the shades of evening fell, Tim double-barred the door, And took precautions that, perhaps, he hadn't night before, And felt quite sure that nothing now could gain admittance there, And peacefully he dozed and slept, a-sitting in his chair. "
119,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"Then, all at once, he roused himself, and opening wide his eyes, Beheld a figure standing there that made his hair arise Like quills upon a porcupine, and froze his heart with fear, And headless though it was, it spoke, and said in accents clear, "
120,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"""There seems to be but two of us to stay in here to-night!"" Tim made a bound, and took with him the sash and every light, And then he jumped a nine-rail fence, and down the road he spun, And said, ""Perhaps _he_ thinks there's two, but darn _me_, there's but one!"" "
121,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"'Twas seven miles before he stopped and sat down on a log To catch his breath and rest awhile from his nocturnal jog And then he turned his head around, and right before his face The figure stood, and said to him, ""I think we've had a race!"" "
122,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"Tim tried to speak, and not a word he found to utter then, But as he jumped from off his seat and broke away again, He spluttered out, ""I _know_ we have, but think it's not quite done, For you can bet right now's the time we'll have another one!"" "
123,TIM BLUSTER'S DREAM.,"Away Tim flew--he left the road, and through the woods and fields The pace he set was wonderful, the ghost right at his heels! And that old house is tenantless, and slowly rotting down, Since that dread night Tim had his dream, and moved right back to town! "
124,APPLE BLOSSOMS.,APPLE BLOSSOMS. 
125,I.,I. 
126,I.,"There's the rose and the lily, the daisy and pink, And many rare flowers which others may think Are the fairest and best, the sweetest that blow, With delicious perfume, and colors that glow-- But go to the orchard and sniff the delight Of the incense that's shed by the pink and the white, And let the soul float away in a swoon On the ambient air where the apple trees bloom! "
127,II.,II. 
128,II.,"There's the cowslip, narcissus, and sweet mignonette, The asters, verbenas, the fuschias; and yet, As much as I love them in Summer array, It's the white and the pink I dream of to-day, And I walk 'neath the branches that just interlace And shower their blossoms right down in my face When the breeze that is laden with rarest perfume Is wafted along where the apple trees bloom! "
129,III.,III. 
130,III.,"With glad voices the birds as they flit to and fro Are singing their songs where the pink and the snow Of the orchard, bedecked in its garments so rare, Is diffusing and sending its breath on the air; And the rays of the sun sift through on the grass, And the dew-drops that sparkle no jewels surpass! In Springtime at evening, at morning, at noon, How sweet is the scent of the apple trees' bloom! "
131,IV.,IV. 
132,IV.,"And when Summer is gone, and Autumn has shed It's soft, dreamy haze through the trees overhead, On each spreading branch where blossoms now cling The red and the gold to the fruit it will bring, And stripe with a skill and give it that blush Only Nature can paint with her delicate brush! O when life ebbs away, then make me a tomb Right out in the orchard, where the apple trees bloom! "
133,CHICKAMAUGA.,CHICKAMAUGA. 
134,CHICKAMAUGA.,"To Chattanooga's vale, where flows the winding Tennessee, And rugged Lookout sentinels heroic dust of sixty-three-- Where Chickamauga's gory field re-echoed to the cannon's roar, And shot and shell through serried ranks a bloody pathway tore, And mountain slope and wood and field were lumined with the blaze Of musketry from Blue and Gray in those September days-- They come again, the gallant few, survivors of the fray, Their breasts with hallowed memories filled, but passion passed away! "
135,CHICKAMAUGA.,"The fleeting years have silvered o'er the locks of those who live, And turned to dust the sleeping ones who to their flag did give The last drop of the crimson tide from ghastly wounds poured out Amid the conflict's awful din and wild resounding shout; And yet it seems but yesterday, or like a passing dream, When marshaled on the mountain's side they saw the bayonets gleam, As for a moment from the vale the battle's smoke was lifted, And circling o'er the Blue and Gray in lurid clouds it drifted! "
136,CHICKAMAUGA.,"And now upon the blood-soaked ground once more they stand, Where the unyielding ""Rock of Chickamauga"" held command, And strewed the field with heaps of the assaulting Gray Who dauntless rushed where lines of Blue refused to give the way; And bloody scenes crowd thick and fast upon the memory here To fill the heart with grief and dim the eye with misty tear; And spanning Time's chasm with the imagination's bridge, They hear the thunder of the guns from Missionary Ridge! "
137,CHICKAMAUGA.,"And there the pyramid of balls is reared to tell And mark the hallowed spot where tuneful genius fell; The vagrant winds around it now seem sighing The requiem sad of ""I am dying, Egypt, dying!"" Prophetic words by gallant LYTLE penned-- A laurel wreath with immortelles to blend! A halo hovers round about this gifted son, Whose deathless name with pen and sword was nobly won! "
138,CHICKAMAUGA.,"They come to mark with tokens of their love and pride Each consecrated spot where bleeding heroes fell and died, And gaze with reverence on some gently swelling mound Which hides the dust of comrade in his sleep profound; To picture to the mind--with melancholy pleasure trace The unforgotten outlines of a dear, remembered face, Which passed from loved ones and from life away, A victim on the bloody field of fratricidal fray! "
139,GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON.,GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON. 
140,GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON.,_Facile Princeps._ 
141,I.,I. 
142,I.,"O gifted one of the Sunny South, with lips so eloquent, In whose great heart no malice e'er was found! And now thou art a messenger of Peace, by heaven sent On mission of fraternity, to heal the cankering wound! "
143,II.,II. 
144,II.,In that dread day when fratricidal strife Convulsed with passion--crimsoned with its blood-- No nobler son than thou who staked his life With veterans Gray withstood the overwhelming flood! 
145,III.,III.

152,UP AND DOWN OLD CLARK'S RUN.,"Bright visions of childhood! How dear to the heart Are the scenes which from memory can never depart! Undimmed by the sorrows, the grief and the tears Which have shadowed the pathway of life's later years, They come like the rainbow which follows the storm-- On remembrance reflected with colors as warm-- And in dreams of delight they picture the fun That we had long ago when we fished in Clark's Run! "
153,UP AND DOWN OLD CLARK'S RUN.,"With a can full of worms and a heart full of joy, Up and down the old stream, a bare-footed boy, A truant from school, my footsteps would stray To the deep-shaded pool, or where ripples at play, As they flowed over beds of smooth-polished stones, Sang a lullaby sweet in soft undertones! From the dawn of the day to the set of the sun What pleasures we've had when we fished in Clark's Run! "
154,UP AND DOWN OLD CLARK'S RUN.,"Equipped with a pole, a hook and a line, And stowed in some pocket a long piece of twine On which you could string, if you seined for a week, Every fish that was found up and down the old creek-- With one ""gallus"" to pants that were rolled to the knee, And holes in our hats through which you could see Where the sunbeams had turned the light hair to dun-- We hied us away to the banks of Clark's Run! "
155,UP AND DOWN OLD CLARK'S RUN.,"There we baited the hook and threw out the line, And watched the cork disappear with a rapture divine! And felt just as proud as a prince or a king When we landed high up, with a jerk and a swing, A fish that would measure two inches or more, Then anchored him fast with the string to the shore! But unnumbered now are the silver strands spun With the hair of the head since we fished in Clark's Run! "
156,UP AND DOWN OLD CLARK'S RUN.,"O who can there be with a heart in his breast Would forget the dear scenes which so lovingly rest In the bosom when life has grown old and cold, And feel no delight when such pictures unfold, And would blot out forever from memory's page The records of childhood which solace old age? 'Till time ends for me and with life I have done, I'll dream of the days when we fished in Clark's Run! "

"
192,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"It stood on a porch where the Summer sunshine Sifted down to the floor through a clambering vine, Whose tendrils about the lattice-work clung Like my heart-strings round her, and the song that she sung; And the pictures of fancy I con o'er and o'er, Till, raptured, I see the dear features once more, And thrill with the touch when her lips set the seal Of her love, as she spun on the old spinning-wheel! "
193,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"Then through the shadows and mists of many long years The old cottage home to the vision appears; And though youth it has fled, and the hair it is gray, I'm a bare-footed boy returned to his play-- Forgetting the present to dream once again That life had no anguish, no sorrow, no pain; And sweetly the bells of the memory peal When communing up there with the old spinning-wheel! "
194,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"And back from the past, with its grief and its joy, Come the tones of a voice I heard when a boy, And I see once again, as it moved to and fro, A form that now rests where the wild roses blow, And the sentinel stars their love vigils keep Above the dear one in her long, dreamless sleep; But memories sweet to a heart that can feel Still cluster around the old spinning-wheel. "
195,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"Some spokes from the rim are broken and gone, And it stands there forsaken, neglected, alone; It knows naught of language, but a story can tell With a charm that for me time cannot dispel; And often I climb the old attic stair The love of my childhood with it to share, And emotions possess me I cannot conceal When fondly I gaze on the old spinning-wheel! "
196,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"The distaff is worn and smooth with the touch Of the now folded hands that used it so much; And lingering there I clearly can trace The sweet smile of love from a well-cherished face, Which sheds round about it a halo divine When thus I am kneeling at memory's shrine, And hallows the thoughts which on the mind steal, When up there alone with the old spinning-wheel! "
197,A CHERISHED RELIC.,"'Tis then that I see her in saintly guise, Through the fast-welling tears that come to my eyes-- A vision arrayed in raiment white That beckons to me from the regions of light, And illumines the way that my footsteps may tread Unerringly where her love for me led-- Along the straight path that she tried to reveal As she taught me, and spun on the old spinning-wheel! "

"
230,PERRYVILLE.,"From yonder hill the shotted guns in dreadful chorus rang-- And on this plain was heard that day the glittering sabre's clang, And in that vale, where wound the brook, with waters murmuring, We stood and heard the Minie balls their deadly message sing, And saw the life blood, gushing red, from stricken comrade near, Whose gentle voice his loved ones then no more should ever hear-- His blue eyes close--his bosom heave--his pulse forever still, A sacrifice to cause held dear, on the field of Perryville!

312,TO SCENES I USED TO KNOW.,"I can see it all when fancy weaves its magic with a dream, And I hear the tones from voices like the murmur of a stream; And oh, the heart seems young again and from its anguish free When I gaze upon these pictures that are ever dear to me; Then I see the darkies dancing, I can hear the fiddle ring As they gathered in the cabin and they cut the pigeon-wing; I can smell the 'possum roasting, I can see the cider flow, When memory takes me back again to scenes I used to know.

336,II.,II. 
337,II.,"Give me the youthful friends I knew, now scattered far and wide-- The loved ones who have passed beyond the bounds of time and tide-- And let me see the rose's hue that mantled every cheek When we were run-aways from school, a-fishing in the creek. "

339,III.,"Give me the stone-bruise on my heel, the hat without a crown-- The unkempt suit of yellow hair the sun had burnt to brown-- And let me go and soak myself, just where we used to walk, In that old swimmin' pool we had, up on the Hanging Fork! "
340,IV.,IV. 
341,IV.,"Give me the wealth I used to have--a wealth of vast content-- The pockets that were always full--but in them not a cent-- And let me hear the music sweet the wild birds used to sing In woods and fields I wandered o'er, beyond the Old Cove Spring! "
342,V.,V. 
343,V.,Give me--but what's the use of wishing for the days that won't return-- The vanished faces of the friends for whom we fondly yearn? And what's the use of trying to look beyond the misty screen Time's hand has hung between the eye and each familiar scene?

347,II.,II. 
348,II.,"Writ it was to a wayward boy, When life to him seemed full of joy-- Pleading with him so to live That he her heart no grief would give-- That after years might ne'er be fraught With sorrow that himself had wrought:-- ""May guardian angels 'round you hover,"" She wrote--and signed the name of--Mother! "
349,III.,III. 
350,III.,"The paper has the taint of must-- The hand that traced the lines is dust, And silvery hair is on the head Of that same boy since first he read This missive from the sainted one That bore her love to an erring son-- More fondly prized than any other-- 'Twas written by the hand of--Mother!

354,THE HERMIT.,"Legend says high-born and wealthy, seeking there in Nature's wilds To forget a maiden fickle, basking in a rival's smiles. "
355,THE HERMIT.,"Where the music of the wild birds, echoed from the cliffs around, Blended with the voice of waters, flowing past with silvery sound; "
356,THE HERMIT.,"Where in Springtime wild flowers blooming shed their incense day and night, And the rugged cliff-sides wearing robes of dogwood, snowy white; "
357,THE HERMIT.,"Where in Summer old trees spreading overhead a leafy roof Flung their shadows, deep and cooling, 'gainst the burning sunbeams proof; "
358,THE HERMIT.,"Where in Winter wild winds raving whistled 'round his lonely home, And the swollen torrent rushing struck the rocks with sullen tone-- "

360,THE HERMIT.,"All of human-kind deserting, where no din of toil and strife Ever came to break the stillness--there he spent a hermit's life. "

362,THE HERMIT.,"Striving to forget the false one, dwelling 'neath her sunny skies, Who had left the arrow rankling in his heart with honied lies. "
363,THE HERMIT.,"Long ago she was forgotten, and at last surcease had come-- For his heart was stilled forever, and his lips were sealed and dumb. "
364,THE HERMIT.,"Long he lay beside the river, flowing sweetly there to-day, Where was found a bleaching skeleton, and a rude hut in decay. "

"
369,II.,II. 
370,II.,"How often I've strayed on a hot Summer's day Where it gurgles and gushes, then flows on its way With a ripple as sweet as the music that died When the tones of loved voices are to us denied, And mirrored my face in the ""Medical Spring,"" Where the beetling old cliffs their cool shadows fling! "
371,III.,III. 
372,III.,"Not riches, nor honors, nor place do I crave, Ere they lay me at last to rest in the grave, But oh, let me hear its music once more, And drink from its depths while I kneel on its shore-- Then bear me away on the Death Angel's wing While my lips are yet moist from the ""Medical Spring!""

I'll ne'er forget when first I met her, And saw the dainty slippered feet Glide o'er the floor at Linnietta! "
376,II.,II. 
377,II.,"O, dreams of youth and beauty rare, What rose-hued visions thou canst paint! But none in loveliness compare With her who seemed Love's patron saint! Her pictured image haunts the mind, And, oh, I never can forget her, Nor rarer pleasure hope to find Than dance with her at Linnietta! "
378,III.,III. 
379,III.,"Arrayed in softly flowing gown, The love-light flashing from her eyes-- With cheeks aglow like roses blown Beneath the ardent summer skies-- No artist hand could fitly trace The wondrous charm that did beset her, When tripping with a fairy's grace O'er the waxen floor at Linnietta! "

383,II.,II. 
384,II.,"The step may falter, eye be dim--the brow may wrinkles wear, And underneath the crumbling mould our friends be sleeping there-- But oh, these visions come to us as to the rose the dew, And while with raptured gaze we look the heart seems ever new. "
385,III.,III. 
386,III.,"Oh, when perhaps at last we're left a laggard on life's stage, This is the mellowed draught we quaff our longings to assuage-- As sweet as that from Paradise the smiling Houris hand The Prophet's faithful followers when at its gates they stand! "
387,IV.,IV.

391,"A TWIST OF ""NATURAL LEAF.""","When sorrow's dark mantle the spirit doth wear, And the heart is oppressed with the demon of care, Then get out your pipe and its magic invoke And all of your troubles will vanish in smoke!

392,"A TWIST OF ""NATURAL LEAF.""","Since the days of King James and his old counterblast Its sway of all classes has ever held fast, And its patron saint Raleigh forever will live In remembrance as sweet as affection can give, And the incense we burn is an offering seen In wreaths of blue smoke from a twist of long green!

404,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"With its rude walls of stone and its moss-covered roof-- ('Tis a picture inwoven with memory's woof)-- It stands there to-day, as it stood in the years When we knew naught of sorrow--nor anguish--nor tears; And though far from it now, I can see it at will-- The old spring-house at the foot of the hill! "
405,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"O flights of fond fancy that deeply inurn Sweet scenes of our childhood, no more to return! Which carry us back in visions and dreams And illumine life's pathway with memory's gleams-- Till we see once again, though with tears the eyes fill, The old spring-house at the foot of the hill! "
406,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"There we children, bare-footed, would wander to play, And wade in the branch that flowed on its way Through the meadows and fields with current so fleet, And a gurgle and ripple that sounded so sweet! And the water that helped turn the wheel at the mill Was from the spring-house at the foot of the hill! "
407,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"And, oh! I remember a pair of blue eyes, With glances as tender and soft as the skies, And a little brown head that was covered with curls, And the laughter that rippled between rows of pearls, Which was changed to a cry of despair and of woe When the craw-fish was clinging to a little pink toe! "
408,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"Distilled by the heart into memory's wine, 'Tis thus that we drink a draught that's divine, And lighten the burdens which after years bear, And banish with dreaming the demon of Care! O in fond recollection I linger there still, By the old spring-house at the foot of the hill! "
409,THE OLD SPRING-HOUSE.,"Though vanished forever the faces that smiled, And hushed is the laughter I heard when a child-- Yet often when musing they float back to me, And I see them and hear it as clear as can be! And I'm playing again, while the heart strings all thrill, By the old spring house at the foot of the hill! "
410,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND. 
411,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,"Where the Cumberland flows on its way to the South, From its source in the hills half-way to its mouth-- When Autumn has come and tempered the rays Of the hot blazing sun with its soft mellow haze, Is an Eden of bliss and a place of delight, When the minnows are good and the ""jumpers"" will bite, And a fellow's well fixed with a reel and a pole, And other ""equipments""--(of which I've been told)! "
412,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,"To camp there and fish for a week at a time, And have the four-pounders just tug at your line, Is a feeling akin to sweet visions we see When we dream of that home where we all hope to be; And no king in the world who sits on a throne E'er felt the rare joy that thrills to the bone When you throw out your line and it whizzes away, Just cutting the water to foamy white spray! "
413,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,"He darts here and there, dead game to the last, When he feels the barbed hook and finds that he's fast, And plunges and struggles, disdaining to yield, Till exhausted at last to the bank he is reeled, And carefully lifted from out the old stream, While he flounders and gasps and his scaly sides gleam, And you measure his length and guess at his weight-- (Five inches too long and a pound too great)! "
414,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,"And when shadows of evening are gathering around, And the sun with pure gold each hill-top has crowned, Then pick up your trappings and leisurely wend Your way back to camp, above the long bend, Where the cook has prepared a supper, I trow, Ne'er dreamt of in thoughts of Delmonico! And you'll sit there and eat for an hour or more With an appetite keen--and unheard of before! "
415,CAMPING ON THE CUMBERLAND.,"Now bring out your pipe and fill up the bowl, And loll there and smoke till it seems that the soul Is wafted away like the ringlets that rise As blue as the dome of the star-jeweled skies! Then roll in a blanket with your feet to the blaze, And the croak of the frogs and the ripple that plays Will lull you to sleep with music as sweet As that of the song when the angels you greet! "

427,THE STAGE COACH.,THE STAGE COACH. 
428,THE STAGE COACH.,"No matter what the weather was, in good old stage coach days, The driver with his ruddy face and spanking team of bays Would spin along the turnpike road, o'er level stretch and hill, That wound away from ""Idleburg"" to classic Nicholasville. "
429,THE STAGE COACH.,"The depths beneath his seat were filled with leathern sacks of mail, And all the coach's top at times was crowded to the rail With trunks, valises, packages, and bundles by the score, That must have weighed, it seemed to me, five thousand pounds or more. "
430,THE STAGE COACH.,"And strapped within the bulging boot, that hung far out behind, Was added weight enough to make a team of oxen blind; And counting all the passengers that filled the coach within, The load those horses had to drag--I thought it was a sin! "
431,THE STAGE COACH.,"How proud of them the driver was! And often he would brag That they could pull a heavier load and never balk or flag; If all the road was ankle-deep in miry, sticky mud, That was the time his team would show its metal and its blood. "
432,THE STAGE COACH.,"The ""ribbons"" then he'd gather up, and give his whip a crack, And any team in front of him had better clear the track; He seemed to own the turnpike road, and kept the right of way Unto himself as jealously as bloomers do to-day. "
433,THE STAGE COACH.,"By wood and field he wound along, and by the river's bank, And when he reached the covered bridge the hoof-beats on the plank Were echoed from the cliffs around and from the vale below; And going up the hill beyond he'd let 'em walk and blow. "
434,THE STAGE COACH.,"Then urged into a trot again around the curves they spun Till hove in sight the manor-house of Camp Dick Robinson; And on beyond where Nelson lay, the bravest of the brave, Till Nicholasville at last was reached, to them the reins he gave. "
435,THE STAGE COACH.,"And when the sun was hanging low and slanting shadows fell, Along the streets of ""Idleburg"" that old familiar yell Would greet the ears of villagers from small boys as they ran With open mouths and lusty lungs a-shouting ""Here comes Sam!"" "
436,THE STAGE COACH.,"Ah me! The old stage coach, abandoned now, stands in the stable lot, A victim to the tooth of rust, and slow decay and rot; Its whole-souled driver years ago forever passed away, And crumbled now to dust the hand that drove each gallant bay! "

438,I.,I.

440,II.,II. 
441,II.,"Past where the meadows gently sweep The limpid waters silent creep, Until, o'erhung with cooling shade, They lave the shores of sylvan glade, And many a wild-flower blooming there Its incense flings upon the air; And spreading o'er each sloping side An emerald carpet stretches wide. "
442,III.,III. 
443,III.,"Now gliding out, the waters gleam And sparkle with the sun's warm beam, Reflecting then some mirrored cloud Like specter wrapt in filmy shroud-- Till pouring down with fretful whirl They o'er the mill-dam rush and curl, And foaming round in eddies deep, The circles wide and wider creep! "
444,IV.,IV. 
445,IV.,"Oh, by thy wave I've loved to stray On many a balmy summer's day-- When youth, and hope, and life were sweet-- Thy wooded banks and cliffs to greet! And often back to days of yore My fancy strays along thy shore, And musing thus I fondly dream I see again thy waters gleam! "

449,II.,II. 
450,II.,"Dear little one with innocent lips, Tasting life's cup at the sparkling brim! Oh, may the dregs that sorrow sips Ever be kept aloof from him!

453,WHEN THE COAL HOUSE'S FULL.,"When the wintry winds are whistlin' through the branches o' the trees, An' the dead leaves are a-flyin' and a-rustlin' in the breeze, You kin feel the vast contentment that over you will roll-- If the barn is full o' fodder, and the coal house full o' coal! "
454,WHEN THE COAL HOUSE'S FULL.,"When the 'skeeter's ceased from troublin' and the fly is chilled to death, An' the window-pane is written with the Frost King's icy breath, You kin dream about the Summer-time, an' that old fishin' pole-- If the pantry's full o' victuals, an' the coal house full o' coal! "
455,WHEN THE COAL HOUSE'S FULL.,"When your supper's been digested an' you're dozin' in your chair, Or you're tucked between the blankets from the frosty, nippin' air, Why, your dreams will be the sweeter if you've helped some sufferin' soul Whose larder's scant o' victuals, and his coal house minus coal!

459,II.,II. 
460,II.,"Beneath thy foot-prints lie the Autumn leaves, Mould'ring and hast'ning to decay; And where the drifting snow its mantle weaves The Summer songsters sang the happy hours away. What tho' the birds have flown the blighted stem? There's in thy jeweled crown the Star of Bethlehem! "
461,SOLACE.,SOLACE. 
462,SOLACE.,"One Autumn evening, wandering, when the sun was hanging low, Through a woodland where the music of a streamlet's gentle flow Commingled with the rustling of the yellow golden leaves, And the idling breeze's sighing as it floated through the trees, I heard sweet voices whispering in accents soft and low, That lulled to rest the troubled soul, like those of long ago. "
463,SOLACE.,"Enchanted thus I lingered, by unseen hands fast bound, My willing fancy captive to the magic of sweet sound, And eagerly I listened to the whispering voices tell Of happy days of childhood, and the tear unbidden fell, As were pictured to the mind again the halcyon scenes of yore, And loved ones that no more I'll meet till on the silent shore! "
464,SOLACE.,"And as the slanting shadows fell athwart the scattered leaves The language that the voices spoke was formed of words like these: ""You may mingle with the sordid world, in eager, restless haste, To struggle for the golden fruit that Mammon loves to taste, But find at last, the end attained, that there are better things To satisfy the longing heart--that sweeter solace brings. "
465,SOLACE.,"""Thy Springtime, thy Summer, and thy Autumn's mellowed haze, If rightly lived and rightly spent, will bring rare, happy days, That temper with their sunshine the frigid Winter's wrath, When gathering storms are darkling o'er life's declining path, And lend a ray celestial that hoarded gold ne'er gave To lighten all thy journey, from the cradle to the grave.""

469,II.,II. 
470,II.,It may not suit a bookish clan that cannot understand The rhythm and the cadences they never can command-- But what is that to him that knows and touches all the strings Of hearts responsive to his strain when gifted Stanton sings? 
471,III.,III. 
472,III.,"We read his songs and hear the notes repeated once again His ear has caught when listening to the mocking-bird's refrain, And interwoven with the sense a mystic something rings That fills the soul with ecstasy when gifted Stanton sings! "

475,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,THE OLD CHURCH BELL. 
476,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,"It hangs today where it has hung for fifty years or more, But some who loved its silver tones the church-yard covers o'er, And many are the times since then, with deep and solemn knell, Has tolled for dear departed ones the Old Church Bell! "
477,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,"Within a latticed tower it swings, high up above the street, And every Sabbath morn is heard the music clear and sweet Which floats above the village roofs, and over hill and dell, Upborne upon the vagrant wind, from the Old Church Bell! "
478,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,"Full many a change the hand of Time has in the village wrought, And passing years have often been with grief and anguish fraught, Yet age has never changed its tones, and years cannot dispel The magic of the music from the Old Church Bell! "
479,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,"Since it was placed within the tower, in days of long ago, The tempests wild have round it raved, and many a driven snow Has sifted through the slats up there, and mantled as it fell In robes of white its dwelling place, and the Old Church Bell! "
480,THE OLD CHURCH BELL.,"Though gone from earth and earthly things--forever passed away-- The faithful ones who loved while here its summons to obey Now rest beyond the tide of Time, with rapture long to dwell, For there their footsteps guided were by the Old Church Bell! "

482,I.,I.

484,II.,II.

487,I.,I.

495,THE MEADOW PATH.,THE MEADOW PATH. 
496,I.,I. 
497,I.,"It led adown the sloping hill, and through the valley wound, And where the blooming clover shed its fragrance all around, And then between the maple trees, across the little brook, To where the old fence bars let down, a tortuous course it took; And often are the times I've heard the merry, ringing laugh, From rosy-ankled children there, along the meadow path. "
498,II.,II. 
499,II.,"Three boys--and a little girl whose hair was chestnut gold-- (She's resting now in dreamless sleep beneath the crumbling mold;)-- But I remember her as when, with innocence and glee, Her laughing eyes looked into mine--for she was dear to me; And thus it is I love to let the fancy photograph The merry group that idled there, along the meadow path. "
500,III.,III. 
501,III.,"Adown it oft we used to go at twilight for the cows, Or wander from the beaten track a rabbit to arouse, And watch him as he scampered off, with frightened leap and bound, The while we made the welkin ring and with our shouts resound. The sweetest flowers that bloom for me--a fragrant aftermath-- Are those that in the memory blow, along the meadow path! "
502,THE FOX HUNTERS.,THE FOX HUNTERS. 
503,I.,I. 
504,I.,"With fleet-limbed steeds and baying pack They follow close on Reynard's track, And wake the slumbering echoes round With music of the horn and hound; Through wood and field, o'er hill and dale, They course him in the moonlight pale, And sport they find which brings delight-- These reckless riders of the night! "
505,II.,II. 
506,II.,"The game is up! away, away! Nor hedge nor fence their course can stay; They clear them at a single leap, And like the wind they onward sweep! O'er fallen trunk and hidden ditch The fearless horsemen plunge and pitch, And heedless all they follow on With ringing shout and winding horn! "
507,III.,III. 
508,III.,"Thy wondrous ride, oh Tam O'Shanter, To speed like theirs was but a canter; Had you bestrode that night instead Of gray mare Meg a thoroughbred (Such as Kentuckians only breed-- To Scotia then an unknown steed), No carline could have caught his rump And left your brute with scarce a stump! "
509,IV.,IV. 
510,IV.,"His foaming horse with throbbing sides Unslackened yet his pace he rides, Till in among the yelping hounds The foremost huntsman proudly bounds, And sees the leaders of the chase (Two matchless dogs that set the pace) O'ertake the game and win the race! And then dismounts and feels the flush Of victory as he takes the brush! "
511,V.,V. 
512,V.,"O royal sport, befitting kings! It bids the demon Care take wings, And the rose's hue to the cheek it brings! And sweeter music none can hear Than that which greets the list'ning ear-- By distance mellowed to a key That breathes divinest harmony-- And wakes the slumbering echoes round-- The winding horn and baying hound! "
513,THE CHARMING GIRL OF SOMERSET.,THE CHARMING GIRL OF SOMERSET. 
514,THE CHARMING GIRL OF SOMERSET.,"By magic spell was I entranced When on me first thy brown eyes glanced, And sunbeams played at hide and seek Thro' silken ringlets on thy dimpling cheek, And like some glorious halo shed Their radiance o'er thy shapely head-- And seemed as if they loved to dwell Where'er thy airy footsteps fell! And in my dreams I see thee now-- The pearly teeth--the arching brow-- The form that mocks the sculptor's art To add one curve that could impart More beauty and more witching grace, Or chisel out a sweeter face! Blest be the hour when first I met This charming girl of Somerset! "

518,II.,II. 
519,II.,"Where the sloping banks are with verdure clad, And the hoary cliffs with moss o'ergrown, And the tangled vine and the wildflowers pad The fallen trunk and the hidden stone! "

524,TO J. R. M.,TO J. R. M. 
525,TO J. R. M.,"I walked within the silent city of the dead, Which then with Autumn leaves was carpeted, And where the faded flower and withered wreath Bespoke the love for those who slept beneath, And, weeping, stood beside a new-made grave Which held the sacred dust that friendship gave. That heart with milk of human kindness overflowed-- That sympathetic hand its generous aid bestowed To lighten others' burdens on life's weary road! And there no polished shaft need lift its head In lettered eulogy above the sainted dead-- His deeds are monuments above the dust whereon we tread! When from its fragile tenement of clay To fairer realms his spirit winged its way, With poignant grief we stood around the bier Which held the lifeless form of one held dear, And broken hearts that knew no comfort then Still mourn the loss of one of Nature's noblemen!

527,TWILIGHT.,"The sun is sinking where the western hills The vision bounds with rugged summits old, And with his latest beam he brightly gilds And crowns with amethyst and gold. "
528,TWILIGHT.,"The distant music of a tinkling bell Is floating o'er the meadow's gentle sweep-- No discords mar the magic of the spell, And stealthily the twilight shadows creep. "
529,TWILIGHT.,And gently falls upon the listening ear-- Like tones from voices of the long-ago-- The cadence of the murmuring waters near-- With rhythmic ripplings soft and low. 
530,TWILIGHT.,"Now grow apace the shadows' slanting shapes And fade the rugged hills to misty gray, As dying day its calm departure takes And yields to coming night her sable sway. "
531,TWILIGHT.,"The vaulted dome above now glows afar With many a soft and tender light, Each sparkling gem it wears a jeweled star, With sweet effulgence purely bright. "
532,TWILIGHT.,"Sweet scene! Sweet hour! If to the heart No quick'ning pulses they can lend, And to the soul no rapture thus impart-- Vain were our lives--and vainer still the end! "
533,TWILIGHT.,"O, such the time when he who will may feel Release from care, vexation, toil, and strife-- And musing then will gently o'er him steal The sweetest moments of the turmoil--life! "

550,II.,II. 
551,II.,"This Ephraim Jones' yellow mare, she was no nice and fleet That all the girls for miles around on Eph. were very ""sweet,"" In hopes to get a ride or two behind her on the road, With sleigh-bells jingling 'round her neck, some day when it had snowed. "

555,IV.,"This thing went on till finally our Ephraim fell in love With Tildy Ann Serepty Brown--as gentle as a dove-- Of all the girls around about the reigning country bell, Whose father was as rich as cream--he'd struck an oil well! "
556,V.,V. 
557,V.,"About three nights in every week could Ephraim's yellow mare Be found a-standing hitched outside, while he was courting there, And so the boys, with envy mad and jealousy aroused, To humble Eph. hit on a plan they heartily espoused. "
558,VI.,VI. 
559,VI.,"If anything in all the world, beside sweet Tildy Ann, Was dear to Ephraim's eye and heart, it was his claybank, Fan; He boasted of her speed and looks, and of her pedigree-- Said more intelligence in a brute no man would ever see. "

572,II.,II. 
573,II.,"The firelight seems to mock me as the ruddy flames arise, And I turn about to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes; And I ponder then in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke Its fate with my condition, and to vanish like the smoke. "
574,III.,III. 
575,III.,With fondest recollection the loving thoughts that start Into being are but feelings from the bottom of my heart; And to wear the new hats over is a luxury divine-- Till my truant fancy wanders with that old straw hat of mine.

"
588,II.,II. 
589,II.,"Though scattered by Time o'er the face of the earth, And sorrow and anguish have succeeded to mirth, Still many there be whose mist-bedewed eye Looks longingly back, while the breast heaves a sigh, To that far-away time, when together we played In the school-house yard, or on Saturdays strayed Where the knots in our sleeves were tied tight as a bond, As we splashed and we dived in Tom Barbee's pond!

590,III.,III. 
591,III.,"The ""pleasures of memory"" by Rogers were lined, With rhythm as sweet as in verse you will find, But could he e'er picture one-half of the joys We had when we wandered as barefooted boys Through the woods and the fields and the meadows out there, With our sun-blistered backs and the burrs in our hair, Or recall to the mind a remembrance more fond Than bathing and swimming in Tom Barbee's pond?

"
606,II.,II. 
607,II.,"O the hills of old Lincoln!--how fondly I gaze On their wildwoods and thickets and deep-tangled ways When memory's mirror presents them to view, And I dream once again that I tread them anew, While raptured I listen to the music of love That the song-birds are singing in the tree-tops above, And the soul drifts away in a swoon of delight, Unanchored from care and from sorrow's cold blight! "
608,III.,III. 
609,III.,"O the hills of old Lincoln!--my footsteps have trod Up and down their green valleys, with shotgun and rod, And it seems to me now that the years that have fled Around their old summits a halo have shed That guides the fond fancy unerringly there When backward it wanders with childhood to share Sweet scenes such as these, inurned in the heart, And which from fond memory can never depart!

620,SCRIBBLER CLUB.),"""Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again""-- A maxim true as holy writ;--then it is plain, If rudely woven by an untaught hand it be, Sustains but transitory wrong and injury. "
621,SCRIBBLER CLUB.),"And thus it is, in homely rhyme, I venture forth, Relating nothing here but under oath; And if, perchance, at times it sounds a little strange, You know that truth o'er fiction hath a wider range. "
