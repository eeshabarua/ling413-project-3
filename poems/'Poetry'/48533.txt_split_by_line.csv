93,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,
94,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,
95,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,These ever wakeful eyes are closed. They saw
96,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Such grief, that they could see no more. The heart--"
97,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,That quick'ning pulse of nations--could not bear
98,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Another throb of pain, and could not hear"
99,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,Another cry of tortur'd motherhood.
100,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Those uncomplaining lips, they sob no more"
101,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The soundless sobs of dark and burning tears,"
102,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"That none have seen; they smile no more, to breathe"
103,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,A mother's comfort into aching hearts.
104,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The patriarchal Queen, the monument"
105,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Of touching widowhood, of endless love,"
106,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,And childlike purity--she sleeps. This night
107,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Is watchful not. The restless hand, that slave"
108,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"To duty, to a mastermind, to wisdom"
109,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,That fathom'd history and saw beyond
110,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The times, lies still in marble whiteness. Love"
111,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"So great, so faithful, unforgetting and"
112,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Unselfish--must it sleep? Or will that veil,"
113,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"That widow's veil unfold, and spread into"
114,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The dovelike wings, that long were wont to hover"
115,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"In anxious care about her world-wide nest,"
116,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"And now will soar and sing, as harpchords sing,"
117,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,Whilst in their upward flight they breast the wind
118,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Of Destiny. No rest for her, no tomb,"
119,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,Nor ashes! Light eternal! Hymns of joy!
120,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"No silence now for her, who, ever silent,"
121,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Above misfortunes' storms and thund'ring billows,"
122,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Would stand with clear and fearless brow, so calm,"
123,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"That men drew strength from out those dauntless eyes,"
124,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"And quiet from that hotly beating heart,"
125,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,Kept still by stern command and unbent will
126,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Beneath those tight shut lips. Not ashes, where"
127,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"A beacon e'er will burn, a fire, like"
128,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The Altar's Soma, for the strong, the weak,"
129,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"The true, the brave, and for the quailing. No,"
130,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Not ashes, but a light, that o'er the times"
131,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Will shed a gentle ray, and show the haven,"
132,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"When all the world, stormshaken, rudderless, will pray:"
133,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,If but her century would shine again!
134,TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN VICTORIA,"Oh, Lord! Why hast thou ta'en thy peaceful Queen?"

144,A FRIEND,Old age is gentle as an autumn morn;
145,A FRIEND,"The harvest over, you will put the plough"
146,A FRIEND,"Into another, stronger hand, and watch"
147,A FRIEND,The sowing you were wont to do.
148,A FRIEND,Old age
149,A FRIEND,"Is like an alabaster room, with soft"
150,A FRIEND,"White curtains. All is light, but light so mild,"
151,A FRIEND,"So quiet, that it cannot hurt."
152,A FRIEND,The pangs
153,A FRIEND,"Are hushed, for life is wild no more with strife,"
154,A FRIEND,"Nor breathless uphill work, nor heavy with"
155,A FRIEND,"The brewing tempests, which have torn away"
156,A FRIEND,"So much, that nothing more remains to fear."
157,A FRIEND,"What once was hope, is gone. You know. You saw"
158,A FRIEND,"The worst, and not a sigh is left of all"
159,A FRIEND,"The heavy sighs that tore your heart, and not"
160,A FRIEND,"A tear of all those tears that burnt your cheeks,"
161,A FRIEND,And ploughed the furrows into them.
162,A FRIEND,You see
163,A FRIEND,"How others work again and weep again,"
164,A FRIEND,And hope and fear. Thy alabaster room
165,A FRIEND,With marble floor and dainty hangings has
166,A FRIEND,"A look so still, that others wonder why"
167,A FRIEND,They feel it churchlike. All thy life is here;
168,A FRIEND,"Thy life hath built the vault and paved it, and"
169,A FRIEND,Thy hands have woven yonder curtains that
170,A FRIEND,"Surround thy seat, a shady sunshine."
171,A FRIEND,Age
172,A FRIEND,"Is feeble not to thee, as all thy wishes"
173,A FRIEND,Are silent and demand no effort. Age
174,A FRIEND,"Is kind to thee, allows thee all the rest"
175,A FRIEND,"That never came, when life was hard and toilsome."
176,A FRIEND,Receive it with a smile and clothe thyself
177,A FRIEND,"In white, in Nature's silver crown, and sing"
178,A FRIEND,A lullaby of promise and of comfort.
179,A FRIEND,"Tell them that life is precious, after work,"
180,A FRIEND,"And after grief and after all the deaths,"
181,A FRIEND,And not a loathsome burden of a life.
182,A FRIEND,"Old age is like a room of alabaster,"
183,A FRIEND,The curtains silken; thou art priest and Druid!
184,A FRIEND,"No mystery for thee, but Light from heaven!"

193,OUT OF THE DEEP,
194,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Thy soul grows silent, when its accents are"
195,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Disturbed, and low thy heart, when dark a burden"
196,OUT OF THE DEEP,Has deeply covered it. Thy soul is proud.
197,OUT OF THE DEEP,"When thou hast made it free of wants and wishes,"
198,OUT OF THE DEEP,Then art thou rich.
199,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Our life is seldom open,"
200,OUT OF THE DEEP,For love and fear have shut it. When we lay
201,OUT OF THE DEEP,"It open, there is nought to show in it,"
202,OUT OF THE DEEP,But wounds and burning pain.
203,OUT OF THE DEEP,Mysterious is
204,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Thy power, great as it may be, a trial"
205,OUT OF THE DEEP,Of thine own will and of the curb upon
206,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Thyself; mysterious to thyself, the more,"
207,OUT OF THE DEEP,"The greater it has grown, surrounded as"
208,OUT OF THE DEEP,We are by fear and pain.
209,OUT OF THE DEEP,And when the soul
210,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Lifts up her voice and speaks, then must she go"
211,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Against the will of people, not her own,"
212,OUT OF THE DEEP,"The will that is herself, the soul's own might."
213,OUT OF THE DEEP,"When heaven asks, we work with joy, a dear"
214,OUT OF THE DEEP,Beloved business put into our hands.
215,OUT OF THE DEEP,"We dream at first to make it daintily,"
216,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Like Nature's work, so careful and so rich,"
217,OUT OF THE DEEP,"And then the dream becomes a wish, then changes"
218,OUT OF THE DEEP,"To action, to be called by us our own"
219,OUT OF THE DEEP,Free will. And when we feel alleviated
220,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Of suffering, we call it hope. In each"
221,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Hard battle of our life, free will is quite"
222,OUT OF THE DEEP,"The same, unbending and undone, and gave"
223,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Us never yet a ray of satisfaction,"
224,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Nor of real joy, the bleeding conqueror."
225,OUT OF THE DEEP,And hope is e'er the same. It dwelleth not
226,OUT OF THE DEEP,"In hearts that are too great for hope, too great"
227,OUT OF THE DEEP,"For wishes, and that fearless never ask"
228,OUT OF THE DEEP,"Why will is but obedience, power worthless,"
229,OUT OF THE DEEP,"The greatest strength a reed, and thought an echo."
230,OUT OF THE DEEP,Great hearts are free of either want or wish;
231,OUT OF THE DEEP,They may be proud and richly clothe themselves

242,A CORONATION,"When in Bohemia there were kings and queens,"
243,A CORONATION,The crown was laid upon the head that had
244,A CORONATION,"To bear and to exalt it--on the King's,"
245,A CORONATION,And then upon the shoulder of the Queen.
246,A CORONATION,"The shoulder bears the weight, the head the burden;"
247,A CORONATION,"The shoulder lifts, the head must carry. Great"
248,A CORONATION,"For both the heaviness, the endless pain,"
249,A CORONATION,"For both the thorns, for both hard labour, thankless"
250,A CORONATION,"Unending work, the sorrow of their people,"
251,A CORONATION,"The care of each and all, the scorching tears"
252,A CORONATION,"Of all, that make their path a desert, and"
253,A CORONATION,"Their robe so heavy, as if dew had changed"
254,A CORONATION,Into the icy hangings of the frost.
255,A CORONATION,The shoulder oftentimes is wounded by
256,A CORONATION,"The crown, the head bowed low, the heart so heavy,"
257,A CORONATION,"Much heavier than all that heavy weight,"
258,A CORONATION,And yet doth woman's frail and bending shoulder
259,A CORONATION,"Resist the load, and still her smiling eyes"
260,A CORONATION,And gentle lips make all the world believe
261,A CORONATION,"Her shoulder bleedeth not, her toil is easy,"
262,A CORONATION,The load they put upon her without asking
263,A CORONATION,"How great her strength, is like a toy. Oh, smile!"
264,A CORONATION,Ye heavy-laden Queens! Let not a sigh
265,A CORONATION,"Escape your loving hearts, and no complaint"
266,A CORONATION,Break from the lips God made to heal and bless!
267,A CORONATION,"Oh, smile! The world doth not forgive its slaves"
268,A CORONATION,For looking overworked. If thou canst bear
269,A CORONATION,"No more, then change the shoulder, tired Queen!"

280,DOWN THE STREAM,"In mountains' deep recesses, stone-black lakes"

282,DOWN THE STREAM,"Into the shining day with scarce a voice,"

287,DOWN THE STREAM,"Into the Unknown all its youth and strength,"
288,DOWN THE STREAM,"And thunders into hell, to rise again"
289,DOWN THE STREAM,"In sheets of whiteness into dreamy veils,"
290,DOWN THE STREAM,To kiss the flowers' feet and overflow
291,DOWN THE STREAM,"The meadows; thence, o'erbridged and caught and fastened"
292,DOWN THE STREAM,"To wheels, to grind and grind with irksome noise,"
293,DOWN THE STREAM,"To lose all liberty, all winsome frolic,"
294,DOWN THE STREAM,And work till doomsday. On and on the stream
295,DOWN THE STREAM,"Goes widening into calm and mighty strength,"
296,DOWN THE STREAM,"A hero of a stream, that bears the ships"

298,DOWN THE STREAM,Wider still
299,DOWN THE STREAM,"He grows, and stronger, as he drags the waters"
300,DOWN THE STREAM,Of hundred rivers with him to the sea.
301,DOWN THE STREAM,"At last his course is sluggish, tired, slow,"
302,DOWN THE STREAM,"A living death, till, blended with the sea,"
303,DOWN THE STREAM,A rising tide will carry him away
304,DOWN THE STREAM,Into oblivion. Such is life! A stream
305,DOWN THE STREAM,"From unknown heights through storm and dangerous fall,"
306,DOWN THE STREAM,Through unknown land and never-ending work
307,DOWN THE STREAM,"Unto Eternity's great, unknown sea."
308,DOWN THE STREAM,"You cannot rise above the height you come from,"
309,DOWN THE STREAM,"You only widen and expand--but downwards,--"
310,DOWN THE STREAM,"Your strength is gone, your impetus is quenched."
311,DOWN THE STREAM,"And then the world will call you great and grand,"
312,DOWN THE STREAM,And make a fortune out of all those waters:
313,DOWN THE STREAM,"Your tears, your blood, your work, and what you spent;"

345,IN THE RUSHING WIND,"As if a thousand chains had chained it down,"
346,IN THE RUSHING WIND,"To howl, to suffer, to rebel against"

1143,A ROOM,With untoward avowal break the peace
1144,A ROOM,That folds thee to its heart and asks no question.
1145,A ROOM,"Such perfect peace pervades a room like this,"
1146,A ROOM,"'Twould seem the raging storm, the roaring sea,"
1147,A ROOM,Might lay themselves to rest upon its threshold.
1148,A ROOM,"The ghosts that haunt it come in guise of angels,"
1149,A ROOM,"With rosy finger-tips laid on their lips,"
1150,A ROOM,To hush our voices to the whispered tones
1151,A ROOM,"Of children's prayers. Enter, thou weary wanderer,"
1152,A ROOM,"Enter! and have no fear, for pain and anguish"
1153,A ROOM,"Have long been wept away, and have but left"
1154,A ROOM,Their precious perfume and the healing balm
1155,A ROOM,Of self-forgetfulness to comfort thee!

1165,UNREST,To toss with fevered brain and throbbing pulses
1166,UNREST,"Upon thy bed at night--thine aching eyes,"
1167,UNREST,"Straining into the darkness, hot and weary,"
1168,UNREST,"Thy heart like lead, yet ever wildly bounding"
1169,UNREST,"Within thee, like a gun made loose in shipwreck,"
1170,UNREST,"That rolls from side to side, an unchained danger,"
1171,UNREST,"Thy pillows fire, thy couch a rack, whereon"
1172,UNREST,"Thy tortured limbs seem cords strung by the storm,"
1173,UNREST,"Thy thoughts a tangled skein, unclear, disordered,"
1174,UNREST,And all the past that should have been forgotten
1175,UNREST,"Rising up ghostly, in fantastic guise,"
1176,UNREST,"To make the present worse, to slay all hope,"
1177,UNREST,To quench the beacon that till now has been
1178,UNREST,Thy only stay in night's deep gloom and horror!
1179,UNREST,"This, O my soul! is Unrest, and thou knowest"
1180,UNREST,Its misery but too well! All the old scars
1181,UNREST,"Of former battles bleed once more within thee,"
1182,UNREST,"As if thy life were oozing, drop by drop."
1183,UNREST,And thou wert fain with trembling fingers seize
1184,UNREST,"That foolish heart, and fling it in thy path"
1185,UNREST,"To trample under foot, or, further still,"
1186,UNREST,"Sink it in sea-depths, and then turn away"
1187,UNREST,"Calm and indifferent, deeming all were well"
1188,UNREST,"Were but its restlessness thus stilled, and thou"
1189,UNREST,Free from its tumult.
1190,UNREST,Yet that heart of thine
1191,UNREST,"Has weathered may a gale, and still might stand"
1192,UNREST,"Unshaken at the helm of life's wrecked craft,"
1193,UNREST,"A gallant pilot, waiting for the sign"
1194,UNREST,"That bids the clouds disperse, hushes the winds,"
1195,UNREST,"And, having calmed the waves, shall guide thy course"
1196,UNREST,"To sun-lit shores, sweet with immortal flowers."
1197,UNREST,"Be brave, poor heart, for thou drawest near the haven,"
1198,UNREST,"And though thy beacon be extinguished, though"
1199,UNREST,"Thy rudder has been snapped, thy compass lost,"
1200,UNREST,"Thou still art safe, for the same Mighty Hand"
1201,UNREST,That sent thee forth upon the stormy sea
1202,UNREST,Shall lead thee home and give thee rest at last!
