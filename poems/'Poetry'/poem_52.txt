                    I

Of old our City hath renown.
  Of God are her foundations,
Wherein this day a King we crown
  Elate among the nations.
      Acknowledge, then, thou King--
      And you, ye people, sing--
      What deeds His arm hath wrought:
      Yea, let their tale be taught
        To endless generations.
