104,A SUMMER NIGHT,A SUMMER NIGHT
105,A SUMMER NIGHT,
106,A SUMMER NIGHT,
107,A SUMMER NIGHT,Her mist of primroses within her breast
108,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Twilight hath folded up, and o'er the west,"
109,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone,"
110,A SUMMER NIGHT,Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn.
111,A SUMMER NIGHT,Silence and coolness now the earth enfold:
112,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Jewels of glittering green, long mists of gold,"
113,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height,"
114,A SUMMER NIGHT,And shake in tremors through the shadowy night.
115,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Heard through the stillness, as in whispered words,"
116,A SUMMER NIGHT,The wandering God-guided wings of birds
117,A SUMMER NIGHT,Ruffle the dark. The little lives that lie
118,A SUMMER NIGHT,Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh
119,A SUMMER NIGHT,More softly still; and unheard through the blue
120,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The falling of innumerable dew,"
121,A SUMMER NIGHT,Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay
122,A SUMMER NIGHT,Burned in the heat of the consuming day.
123,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love,"
124,A SUMMER NIGHT,Admitted to the majesty above.
125,A SUMMER NIGHT,Earth with the starry company hath part;
126,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The waters hold all heaven within their heart,"
127,A SUMMER NIGHT,And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere
128,A SUMMER NIGHT,Lifted to meet the angel lips of air.
129,A SUMMER NIGHT,The many homes of men shine near and far;
130,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Peace-laden as the tender evening star,"
131,A SUMMER NIGHT,The late home-coming folk anticipate
132,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Their rest beyond the passing of the gate,"
133,A SUMMER NIGHT,And tread with sleep-filled hearts on drowsy feet.
134,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Oh, far away and wonderful and sweet"
135,A SUMMER NIGHT,"All this, all this. But far too many things"
136,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Obscuring, as a cloud of seraph wings"
137,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind,"
138,A SUMMER NIGHT,"I fall away in weariness of mind,"
139,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And think how far apart are I and you,"
140,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Beloved, from those spirit children who"
141,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Felt but one single Being long ago,"
142,A SUMMER NIGHT,Whispering in gentleness and leaning low
143,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Out of its majesty, as child to child."
144,A SUMMER NIGHT,I think upon it all with heart grown wild.
145,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Hearing no voice, howe'er my spirit broods."
146,A SUMMER NIGHT,"No whisper from the dense infinitudes,"
147,A SUMMER NIGHT,This world of myriad things whose distance awes.
148,A SUMMER NIGHT,Ah me; how innocent our childhood was!

158,CREATION,"The spirit issued dark and bright,"
159,CREATION,Filling thy beauty like a cup.
160,CREATION,
161,CREATION,"Sacred thy laughter on the air,"
162,CREATION,"Holy thy lightest word that fell,"
163,CREATION,Proud the innumerable hair
164,CREATION,That waved at the enchanter's spell.
165,CREATION,
166,CREATION,"Oh Master of the Beautiful,"
167,CREATION,"Creating us from hour to hour,"
168,CREATION,Give me this vision to the full
169,CREATION,To see in lightest things thy power!
170,CREATION,
171,CREATION,"This vision give, no heaven afar,"
172,CREATION,"No throne, and yet I will rejoice,"

174,CREATION,Thy word in every wandering voice.

182,DUSK,Dusk wraps the village in its dim caress;
183,DUSK,"Each chimney's vapour, like a thin grey rod,"
184,DUSK,"Mounting aloft through miles of quietness,"
185,DUSK,Pillars the skies of God.
186,DUSK,
187,DUSK,"Far up they break or seem to break their line,"
188,DUSK,Mingling their nebulous crests that bow and nod
189,DUSK,Under the light of those fierce stars that shine
190,DUSK,Out of the calm of God.
191,DUSK,
192,DUSK,Only in clouds and dreams I felt those souls
193,DUSK,"In the abyss, each fire hid in its clod,"
194,DUSK,From which in clouds and dreams the spirit rolls
195,DUSK,Into the vast of God.

203,NIGHT,Heart-hidden from the outer things I rose;
204,NIGHT,The spirit woke anew in nightly birth
205,NIGHT,Unto the vastness where forever glows
206,NIGHT,The star-soul of the earth.
207,NIGHT,
208,NIGHT,"There all alone in primal ecstasy,"
209,NIGHT,"Within her depths where revels never tire,"
210,NIGHT,The Olden Beauty shines: each thought of me
211,NIGHT,Is veined through with its fire.
212,NIGHT,
213,NIGHT,And all my thoughts are throngs of living souls;
214,NIGHT,"They breathe in me, heart unto heart allied;"
215,NIGHT,"Their joy undimmed, though when the morning tolls"
216,NIGHT,The planets may divide.

223,DAWN,
224,DAWN,Still as the holy of holies breathes the vast
225,DAWN,Within its crystal depths the stars grow dim;
226,DAWN,Fire on the altar of the hills at last
227,DAWN,Burns on the shadowy rim.
228,DAWN,
229,DAWN,Moments that holds all moments; white upon
230,DAWN,The verge it trembles; then like mists of flowers
231,DAWN,Break from the fairy fountain of the dawn
232,DAWN,The hues of many hours.
233,DAWN,
234,DAWN,Thrown downward from that high companionship
235,DAWN,"Of dreaming inmost heart with inmost heart,"
236,DAWN,"Into the common daily ways I slip,"
237,DAWN,My fire from theirs apart.

245,DAY,In day from some titanic past it seems
246,DAY,As if a thread divine of memory runs;
247,DAY,"Born ere the Mighty One began his dreams,"
248,DAY,Or yet were stars and suns.
249,DAY,
250,DAY,But here an iron will has fixed the bars;
251,DAY,Forgetfulness falls on earth's myriad races:
252,DAY,No image of the proud and morning stars
253,DAY,Looks at us from their faces.
254,DAY,
255,DAY,"Yet yearning still to reach to those dim heights,"
256,DAY,"Each dream remembered is a burning-glass,"
257,DAY,Where through to darkness from the Light of Lights
258,DAY,Its rays in splendour pass.

266,DANA,"I am the tender voice calling 'Away,'"
267,DANA,"Whispering between the beatings of the heart,"
268,DANA,And inaccessible in dewy eyes
269,DANA,"I dwell, and all unkissed on lovely lips,"
270,DANA,"Lingering between white breasts inviolate,"
271,DANA,"And fleeting ever from the passionate touch,"
272,DANA,"I shine afar, till men may not divine"
273,DANA,Whether it is the stars or the beloved
274,DANA,They follow with wrapt spirit. And I weave
275,DANA,"My spells at evening, folding with dim caress,"
276,DANA,"Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair,"
277,DANA,"The lonely wanderer by wood or shore,"
278,DANA,"Till, filled with some deep tenderness, he yields,"
279,DANA,Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart
280,DANA,"He knew, ere he forsook the starry way,"
281,DANA,"And clings there, pillowed far above the smoke"
282,DANA,And the dim murmur from the duns of men.
283,DANA,"I can enchant the trees and rocks, and fill"
284,DANA,"The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery,"
285,DANA,Make them reveal or hide the god. I breathe
286,DANA,"A deeper pity than all love, myself"
287,DANA,"Mother of all, but without hands to heal:"
288,DANA,"Too vast and vague, they know me not. But yet"
289,DANA,"I am the heartbreak over fallen things,"
290,DANA,"The sudden gentleness that stays the blow,"
291,DANA,And I am in the kiss that foemen give
292,DANA,"Pausing in battle, and in the tears that fall"
293,DANA,"Over the vanquished foe, and in the highest;"
294,DANA,"Among the Danaan gods, I am the last"
295,DANA,Council of mercy in their hearts where they
296,DANA,Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones.

304,REMEMBRANCE,"There were many burning hours on the heart-sweet tide,"
305,REMEMBRANCE,"And we passed away from ourselves, forgetting all"
306,REMEMBRANCE,"The immortal moods that faded, the god who died,"
307,REMEMBRANCE,Hastening away to the King on a distant call.
308,REMEMBRANCE,
309,REMEMBRANCE,"There were ruby dews were shed when the heart was riven,"
310,REMEMBRANCE,And passionate pleading and prayers to the dead we had wronged;
311,REMEMBRANCE,"And we passed away unremembering and unforgiven,"
312,REMEMBRANCE,Hastening away to the King for the peace we longed.
313,REMEMBRANCE,
314,REMEMBRANCE,"Love unremembered and heart-ache we left behind,"
315,REMEMBRANCE,"We forsook them, unheeding, hastening away in our flight;"
316,REMEMBRANCE,We knew the hearts we had wronged of old we would find
317,REMEMBRANCE,When we came to the fold of the King for rest in the night.

325,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Who would think this quiet breather
326,THE HOUR OF THE KING,From the world had taken flight?
327,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Yet within the form we see there
328,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Wakes the golden King to-night.
329,THE HOUR OF THE KING,
330,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Out upon the face of faces
331,THE HOUR OF THE KING,He looked forth before his sleep:
332,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Now he knows the starry races
333,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Haunters of the ancient deep;
334,THE HOUR OF THE KING,
335,THE HOUR OF THE KING,On the Bird of Diamond Glory
336,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Floats in mystic floods of song:
337,THE HOUR OF THE KING,As he lists Time's triple story
338,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Seems but as a day is long.
339,THE HOUR OF THE KING,
340,THE HOUR OF THE KING,From the mightier Adam falling
341,THE HOUR OF THE KING,"To his image dwarfed in clay,"
342,THE HOUR OF THE KING,He will at our voices calling
343,THE HOUR OF THE KING,Come to this side of the day.
344,THE HOUR OF THE KING,
345,THE HOUR OF THE KING,"When he wakes, the dreamy-hearted,"
346,THE HOUR OF THE KING,"He will know not whence he came,"
347,THE HOUR OF THE KING,And the light from which he parted
348,THE HOUR OF THE KING,"Be the seraph's sword of flame,"
349,THE HOUR OF THE KING,
350,THE HOUR OF THE KING,And behind it hosts supernal
351,THE HOUR OF THE KING,"Guarding the lost paradise,"
352,THE HOUR OF THE KING,And the tree of life eternal
353,THE HOUR OF THE KING,From the weeping human eyes.

359,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,
360,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,
361,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,The grey road whereupon we trod became as holy ground:
362,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,The eve was all one voice that breathed its message with no sound:
363,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"And burning multitudes pour through my heart, too bright, too blind,"
364,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,Too swift and hurried in their flight to leave their tale behind.
365,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"Twin gates unto that living world, dark honey-coloured eyes"
366,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,The lifting of whose lashes flushed the face with paradise--
367,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"Beloved, there I saw within their ardent rays unfold"
368,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,The likeness of enraptured birds that flew from deeps of gold
369,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,To deeps of gold within my breast to rest or there to be
370,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"Transfigured in the light, or find a death to life in me."
371,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"So love, a burning multitude, a seraph wind which blows"
372,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,From out the deep of being to the deep of being goes:
373,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,And sun and moon and starry fires and earth and air and sea
374,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"Are creatures from the deep let loose who pause in ecstasy,"
375,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,Or wing their wild and heavenly way until again they find
376,THE WINDS OF ANGUS,"The ancient deep and fade therein, enraptured, bright and blind."

385,REFLECTIONS,Its depth of blue is from the skies;
386,REFLECTIONS,And from a distant sun the dreams
387,REFLECTIONS,And lovely light within your eyes.
388,REFLECTIONS,
389,REFLECTIONS,We deem our love so infinite
390,REFLECTIONS,"Because the Lord is everywhere,"
391,REFLECTIONS,And love awakening is made bright
392,REFLECTIONS,And bathed in that diviner air.
393,REFLECTIONS,
394,REFLECTIONS,We go on our enchanted way
395,REFLECTIONS,"And deem our hours immortal hours,"

403,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,
404,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,
405,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Come earth's little children pit-pat from their burrows on the hill;
406,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Hangs within the gloom its weary head the shining daffodil.
407,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,In the valley underneath us through the fragrance flit along
408,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Over fields and over hedgerows little quivering drops of song.
409,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,All adown the pale blue mantle of the mountains far away
410,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Stream the tresses of the twilight flying in the wake of day.
411,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Night comes; soon alone shall fancy follow sadly in her flight
412,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"Where the fiery dust of evening, shaken from the feet of light,"
413,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"Thrusts its monstrous barriers between the pure, the good, the true,"
414,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"That our weeping eyes may strain for, but shall never after view."
415,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Only yester eve I watched with heart at rest the nebulæ
416,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Looming far within the shadowy shining of the Milky Way;
417,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Finding in the stillness joy and hope for all the sons of men;
418,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Now what silent anguish fills a night more beautiful than then.
419,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"For earth's age of pain has come, and all her sister planets weep,"
420,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,Thinking of her fires of morning passing into dreamless sleep.
421,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,In this cycle of great sorrow for the moments that we last
422,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,We too shall be linked by weeping to the greatness of her past:
423,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"But the coming race shall know not, and the fount of tears shall dry,"
424,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,And the arid heart of man be arid as the desert sky.
425,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,So within my mind the darkness dawned and round me everywhere
426,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,"Hope departed with the twilight, leaving only dumb despair."
427,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,
428,THE DAWN OF DARKNESS,

434,NATURAL MAGIC,We are tired who follow after
435,NATURAL MAGIC,Phantasy and truth that flies:
436,NATURAL MAGIC,You with only look and laughter
437,NATURAL MAGIC,Stain our hearts with richest dyes.
438,NATURAL MAGIC,
439,NATURAL MAGIC,When you break upon our study
440,NATURAL MAGIC,Vanish all our frosty cares;
441,NATURAL MAGIC,"As the diamond deep grows ruddy,"
442,NATURAL MAGIC,Filled with morning unawares.
443,NATURAL MAGIC,
444,NATURAL MAGIC,With the stuff that dreams are made of
445,NATURAL MAGIC,But an empty house we build:
446,NATURAL MAGIC,"Glooms we are ourselves afraid of,"
447,NATURAL MAGIC,By the ancient starlight chilled.
448,NATURAL MAGIC,
449,NATURAL MAGIC,All unwise in thought or duty--
450,NATURAL MAGIC,Still our wisdom envies you:
451,NATURAL MAGIC,We who lack the living beauty
452,NATURAL MAGIC,Half our secret knowledge rue.
453,NATURAL MAGIC,
454,NATURAL MAGIC,Thought nor fear in you nor dreaming
455,NATURAL MAGIC,Veil the light with mist about;
456,NATURAL MAGIC,"Joy, as through a crystal gleaming,"
457,NATURAL MAGIC,Flashes from the gay heart out.
458,NATURAL MAGIC,
459,NATURAL MAGIC,"Pain and penitence forsaking,"
460,NATURAL MAGIC,"Hearts like cloisters dim and grey,"
461,NATURAL MAGIC,"By your laughter lured, awaking"
462,NATURAL MAGIC,Join with you the dance of day.

469,IN THE WOMB,
470,IN THE WOMB,Still rests the heavy share on the dark soil:
471,IN THE WOMB,Upon the black mould thick the dew-damp lies:
472,IN THE WOMB,The horse waits patient: from his lowly toil
473,IN THE WOMB,The ploughboy to the morning lifts his eyes.
474,IN THE WOMB,
475,IN THE WOMB,The unbudding hedgerows dark against day's fires
476,IN THE WOMB,Glitter with gold-lit crystals: on the rim
477,IN THE WOMB,Over the unregarding city's spires
478,IN THE WOMB,The lonely beauty shines alone for him.
479,IN THE WOMB,
480,IN THE WOMB,And day by day the dawn or dark enfolds
481,IN THE WOMB,And feeds with beauty eyes that cannot see
482,IN THE WOMB,How in her womb the mighty mother moulds
483,IN THE WOMB,The infant spirit for eternity.

497,FORGIVENESS,Such things to her who knew not sin--
498,FORGIVENESS,"The sharp ache throbbing in my head,"
499,FORGIVENESS,The fever running high within.
500,FORGIVENESS,
501,FORGIVENESS,I touched with pain her purity;

503,FORGIVENESS,My soul was black as night to me:
504,FORGIVENESS,To her I was a wounded thing.
505,FORGIVENESS,
506,FORGIVENESS,I needed love no words could say;
507,FORGIVENESS,"She drew me softly nigh her chair,"
508,FORGIVENESS,"My head upon her knees to lay,"
509,FORGIVENESS,With cool hands that caressed my hair.
510,FORGIVENESS,
511,FORGIVENESS,"She sat with hands as if to bless,"
512,FORGIVENESS,"And looked with grave, ethereal eyes;"

525,A WOMAN'S VOICE,That withered for the cooling dew.

527,A WOMAN'S VOICE,It was but pity when I spoke
528,A WOMAN'S VOICE,"And called him to my heart for rest,"
529,A WOMAN'S VOICE,And half a mother's love that woke
530,A WOMAN'S VOICE,Feeling his head upon my breast:
531,A WOMAN'S VOICE,
532,A WOMAN'S VOICE,And half the lion's tenderness
533,A WOMAN'S VOICE,"To shield her cubs from hurt or death,"
534,A WOMAN'S VOICE,"Which, when the serried hunters press,"
535,A WOMAN'S VOICE,Makes terrible her wounded breath.
536,A WOMAN'S VOICE,
537,A WOMAN'S VOICE,But when the lips I breathed upon
538,A WOMAN'S VOICE,Asked for such love as equals claim
539,A WOMAN'S VOICE,I looked where all the stars were gone
540,A WOMAN'S VOICE,Burned in the day's immortal flame.

592,THE HEROES,
593,THE HEROES,By many a dream of God and man my thoughts in shining flocks were led:
594,THE HEROES,But as I went through Patrick Street the hopes and prophecies were dead.
595,THE HEROES,The hopes and prophecies were dead: they could not blossom where the feet
596,THE HEROES,"Walked amid rottenness, or where the brawling shouters stamped the street."
597,THE HEROES,Where was the beauty that the Lord gave man when first he towered in pride?
598,THE HEROES,But one came by me at whose word the bitter condemnation died.
599,THE HEROES,His brows were crowned with thorns of light: his eyes were bright as one
600,THE HEROES,who sees
601,THE HEROES,The starry palaces shine o'er the sparkle of the heavenly seas.
602,THE HEROES,'Is it not beautiful?' he cried. Our Faery Land of Hearts' Desire
603,THE HEROES,"Is mingled through the mire and mist, yet stainless keeps its lovely fire."
604,THE HEROES,The pearly phantoms with blown hair are dancing where the drunkards reel:
605,THE HEROES,The cloud frail daffodils shine out where filth is splashing from the heel.
606,THE HEROES,"O sweet, and sweet, and sweet to hear, the melodies in rivers run:"
607,THE HEROES,The rapture of their crowded notes is yet the myriad voice of One.
608,THE HEROES,"Those who are lost and fallen here, to-night in sleep shall pass the gate,"
609,THE HEROES,"And wear the purples of the King, and know them masters of their fate."
610,THE HEROES,Each wrinkled hag shall reassume the plumes and hues of paradise:
611,THE HEROES,Each brawler be enthroned in calm among the Children of the Wise.
612,THE HEROES,Yet in the council with the gods no one will falter to pursue
613,THE HEROES,"His lofty purpose, but come forth the cyclic labours to renew;"
614,THE HEROES,"And take the burden of the world and dim his beauty in a shroud,"
615,THE HEROES,And wrestle with the chaos till the anarch to the light be bowed.
616,THE HEROES,We cannot for forgetfulness forego the reverence due to them
617,THE HEROES,Who wear at times they do not guess the sceptre and the diadem.
618,THE HEROES,As bright a crown as this was theirs when first they from the Father sped;
619,THE HEROES,Yet look with deeper eyes and still the ancient beauty is not dead.
620,THE HEROES,"He mingled with the multitude. I saw their brows were crowned and bright,"

652,BLINDNESS,"A stranger's lips--but thine I kiss not,"
653,BLINDNESS,Erring in all my tenderness.
654,BLINDNESS,
655,BLINDNESS,I sometimes think a mighty lover
656,BLINDNESS,Takes every burning kiss we give:

945,THE PARTING OF WAYS,In elemental solitude.
946,THE PARTING OF WAYS,
947,THE PARTING OF WAYS,We knew not in redeeming day
948,THE PARTING OF WAYS,Whether our spirits would be found
949,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"Floating along the starry way,"
950,THE PARTING OF WAYS,Or in the earthly vapours drowned.
951,THE PARTING OF WAYS,
952,THE PARTING OF WAYS,Brought by the sunrise-coloured flame
953,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"To earth, uncertain yet, the while"
954,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"I looked at you, there slowly came,"
955,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"Noble and sisterly, your smile."
956,THE PARTING OF WAYS,
957,THE PARTING OF WAYS,We bade adieu to love the old;
958,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"We heard another lover then,"
959,THE PARTING OF WAYS,"Whose forms are myriad and untold,"
960,THE PARTING OF WAYS,Sigh to us from the hearts of men.

968,SONG,"Dusk its ash-grey blossoms sheds on violet skies,"
969,SONG,"Over twilight mountains where the heart songs rise,"
970,SONG,Rise and fall and fade away from earth to air.
971,SONG,"Earth renews the music sweeter. Oh, come there."
972,SONG,"Come, acushla, come, as in ancient times"
973,SONG,Rings aloud the underland with faery chimes.
974,SONG,Down the unseen ways as strays each tinkling fleece
975,SONG,"Winding ever onward to a fold of peace,"
976,SONG,So my dreams go straying in a land more fair;
977,SONG,"Half I tread the dew-wet grasses, half wander there."
978,SONG,Fade your glimmering eyes in a world grown cold;
979,SONG,"Come, acushla, with me to the mountains old."
980,SONG,There the bright ones call us waving to and fro--
981,SONG,"Come, my children, with me to the ancient go."
