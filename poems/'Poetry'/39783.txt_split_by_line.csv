103,I,Ah! red-leafed time hath driven out the rose
104,I,And crimson dew is fallen on the leaf
105,I,Ere ever yet the cold white wheat be sown
106,I,That hideth all earth's green and sere and red;
107,I,"The Moon-flower's fallen and the branch is bare,"
108,I,Holding no honey for the starry bees;
109,I,The Maiden turns to her dark lord's demesne.
110,I,
111,II,II
112,II,
113,II,Fairer than Enna's field when Ceres sows
114,II,"The stars of hyacinth and puts off grief,"
115,II,Fairer than petals on May morning blown
116,II,Through apple-orchards where the sun hath shed
117,II,His brighter petals down to make them fair;
118,II,"Fairer than these the Poppy-crowned One flees,"
119,II,And Joy goes weeping in her scarlet train.
120,II,
121,III,III
122,III,
123,III,"The faint damp wind that, ere the even, blows"
124,III,"Piling the west with many a tawny sheaf,"
125,III,Then when the last glad wavering hours are mown
126,III,Sigheth and dies because the day is sped;
127,III,This wind is like her and the listless air
128,III,"Wherewith she goeth by beneath the trees,"
129,III,The trees that mock her with their scarlet stain.
130,III,
131,IV,IV
132,IV,
133,IV,Love that is born of Time and comes and goes!
134,IV,Love that doth hold all noble hearts in fief!
135,IV,"As red leaves follow where the wind hath flown,"
136,IV,So all men follow Love when Love is dead.
137,IV,"O Fate of Wind! O Wind that cannot spare,"
138,IV,"But drivest out the Maid, and pourest lees"
139,IV,"Of all thy crimson on the wold again,"
140,IV,
141,V,V
142,V,
143,V,"Korè my heart is, let it stand sans gloze!"
144,V,"Love's pain is long, and lo, love's joy is brief!"
145,V,My heart erst alway sweet is bitter grown;
146,V,"As crimson ruleth in the good green's stead,"
147,V,So grief hath taken all mine old joy's share
148,V,And driven forth my solace and all ease
149,V,Where pleasure bows to all-usurping pain.
150,V,
151,VI,VI
152,VI,
153,VI,Crimson the hearth where one last ember glows!
154,VI,"My heart's new winter hath no such relief,"
155,VI,Nor thought of Spring whose blossom he hath known
156,VI,Hath turned him back where Spring is banished.
157,VI,"Barren the heart and dead the fires there,"
158,VI,"Blow! O ye ashes, where the winds shall please,"
159,VI,"But cry, ""Love also is the Yearly Slain."""

173,I,
174,I,'Tis the clear light of love I praise
175,I,"That steadfast gloweth o'er deep waters,"
176,I,A clarity that gleams always.
177,I,"Though man's soul pass through troubled waters,"
178,I,Strange ways to him are openèd.
179,I,To shore the beaten ship is sped
180,I,If only love of light give aid.
181,I,
182,II,II
183,II,
184,II,That fair far spear of light now lays
185,II,Its long gold shaft upon the waters.
186,II,Ah! might I pass upon its rays
187,II,"To where it gleams beyond the waters,"
188,II,Or might my troubled heart be fed
189,II,"Upon the frail clear light there shed,"
190,II,Then were my pain at last allay'd.
191,II,
192,III,III
193,III,
194,III,Although the clouded storm dismays
195,III,"Many a heart upon these waters,"
196,III,The thought of that far golden blaze
197,III,"Giveth me heart upon the waters,"
198,III,Thinking thereof my bark is led
199,III,To port wherein no storm I dread;
200,III,No tempest maketh me afraid.
201,III,
202,IV,IV
203,IV,
204,IV,Yet when within my heart I gaze
205,IV,"Upon my fair beyond the waters,"
206,IV,Meseems my soul within me prays
207,IV,To pass straightway beyond the waters.
208,IV,Though I be alway banished
209,IV,"From ways and woods that she doth tread,"
210,IV,"One thing there is that doth not fade,"
211,IV,
212,V,V
213,V,
214,V,"Deep in my heart that spear-print stays,"
215,V,"That wound I gat beyond the waters,"
216,V,Deeper with passage of the days
217,V,"That pass as swift and bitter waters,"
218,V,While a dull fire within my head
219,V,Moveth itself if word be said
220,V,Which hath concern with that far maid.
221,V,
222,VI,VI
223,VI,
224,VI,My love is lovelier than the sprays
225,VI,"Of eglantine above clear waters,"
226,VI,Or whitest lilies that upraise
227,VI,Their heads in midst of moated waters.
228,VI,No poppy in the May-glad mead
229,VI,Would match her quivering lips' red
230,VI,If 'gainst her lips it should be laid.
231,VI,
232,VII,VII
233,VII,
234,VII,"The light within her eyes, which slays"
235,VII,"Base thoughts and stilleth troubled waters,"
236,VII,Is like the gold where sunlight plays
237,VII,Upon the still o'ershadowed waters.
238,VII,When anger is there mingled
239,VII,"There comes a keener gleam instead,"
240,VII,Like flame that burns beneath thin jade.
241,VII,
242,VIII,VIII
243,VIII,
244,VIII,Know by the words here mingled
245,VIII,"What love hath made my heart his stead,"
246,VIII,Glowing like flame beneath thin jade.

257,I,"Heart mine, art mine, whose embraces"
258,I,Clasp but wind that past thee bloweth
259,I,"E'en this air so subtly gloweth,"
260,I,"Guerdoned by thy sun-gold traces,"
261,I,That my heart is half afraid
262,I,For the fragrance on him laid;
263,I,Even so love's might amazes!
264,I,
265,II,II
266,II,
267,II,"Man's love follows many faces,"
268,II,My love only one face knoweth;
269,II,"Towards thee only my love floweth,"
270,II,And outstrips the swift stream's paces.
271,II,"Were this love well here displayed,"
272,II,As flame flameth 'neath thin jade
273,II,Love should glow through these my phrases.
274,II,
275,III,III
276,III,
277,III,"Though I've roamed through many places,"
278,III,None there is that my heart troweth
279,III,Fair as that wherein fair groweth
280,III,One whose laud here interlaces
281,III,"Tuneful words, that I've essayed."
282,III,Let this tune be gently played
283,III,Which my voice herward upraises.
284,III,
285,IV,IV
286,IV,
287,IV,"If my praise her grace effaces,"
288,IV,"Then 'tis not my heart that showeth,"
289,IV,But the skilless tongue that soweth
290,IV,Words unworthy of her graces.
291,IV,"Tongue, that hath me so betrayed,"
292,IV,"Were my heart but here displayed,"
293,IV,Then were sung her fitting praises.

302,I,"Thy gracious ways,"
303,I,"O Lady of my heart, have"
304,I,O'er all my thought their golden glamour cast;
305,I,"As amber torch-flames, where strange men-at-arms"
306,I,"Tread softly 'neath the damask shield of night,"
307,I,"Rise from the flowing steel in part reflected,"

316,II,Till all the summer of the eastern farms
317,II,"Doth dim the sense, and dream up through the light,"
318,II,"As memory, by new-born love corrected--"
319,II,With savour such as only new love knoweth--
320,II,Through swift dim ways the hidden pasts recalleth.

322,III,III
323,III,
324,III,"On barren days,"

326,III,"Bent low in thought of the great charm thou hast,"
327,III,Behold with music's many-stringed charms
328,III,The silence groweth thou. O rare delight!
329,III,The melody upon clear strings inflected
330,III,"Were dull when o'er taut sense thy presence floweth,"
331,III,With quivering notes' accord that never palleth.

339,IV,Hides Khadeeth's pearl and all the sapphire might
340,IV,"Of burnished waves, before her gates collected:"

372,I,He that is Lord of all the realms of light
373,I,Hath unto me from His magnificence
374,I,Granted such vision as hath wrought my joy.
375,I,Moving my spirit past the last defence
376,I,"That shieldeth mortal things from mightier sight,"
377,I,"Where freedom of the soul knows no alloy,"
378,I,I saw what forms the lordly powers employ;
379,I,"Three splendours, saw I, of high holiness,"
380,I,From clarity to clarity ascending
381,I,"Through all the roofless, tacit courts extending"
382,I,In aether which such subtle light doth bless

2311,THE SEAFARER,
2312,THE SEAFARER,
2313,THE SEAFARER,"May I for my own self song's truth reckon,"
2314,THE SEAFARER,"Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days"
2315,THE SEAFARER,Hardship endured oft.
2316,THE SEAFARER,"Bitter breast-cares have I abided,"
2317,THE SEAFARER,"Known on my keel many a care's hold,"
2318,THE SEAFARER,"And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent"
2319,THE SEAFARER,Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
2320,THE SEAFARER,"While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,"
2321,THE SEAFARER,My feet were by frost benumbed.
2322,THE SEAFARER,Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
2323,THE SEAFARER,Hew my heart round and hunger begot
2324,THE SEAFARER,Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
2325,THE SEAFARER,"That he on dry land loveliest liveth,"
2326,THE SEAFARER,"List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,"
2327,THE SEAFARER,"Weathered the winter, wretched outcast"
2328,THE SEAFARER,Deprived of my kinsmen;
2329,THE SEAFARER,"Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,"
2330,THE SEAFARER,There I heard naught save the harsh sea
2331,THE SEAFARER,"And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,"
2332,THE SEAFARER,"Did for my games the gannet's clamour,"
2333,THE SEAFARER,"Sea-fowls' loudness was for me laughter,"
2334,THE SEAFARER,The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
2335,THE SEAFARER,"Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern"
2336,THE SEAFARER,In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
2337,THE SEAFARER,With spray on his pinion.
2338,THE SEAFARER,Not any protector
2339,THE SEAFARER,May make merry man faring needy.
2340,THE SEAFARER,"This he little believes, who aye in winsome life"
2341,THE SEAFARER,"Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,"
2342,THE SEAFARER,"Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft"
2343,THE SEAFARER,Must bide above brine.
2344,THE SEAFARER,"Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,"
2345,THE SEAFARER,"Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then"
2346,THE SEAFARER,Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
2347,THE SEAFARER,The heart's thought that I on high streams
2348,THE SEAFARER,The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
2349,THE SEAFARER,Moaneth alway my mind's lust
2350,THE SEAFARER,"That I fare forth, that I afar hence"
2351,THE SEAFARER,Seek out a foreign fastness.
2352,THE SEAFARER,"For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,"
2353,THE SEAFARER,"Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;"
2354,THE SEAFARER,"Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful"
2355,THE SEAFARER,But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
2356,THE SEAFARER,Whatever his lord will.
2357,THE SEAFARER,"He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having"
2358,THE SEAFARER,"Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight"
2359,THE SEAFARER,"Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,"
2360,THE SEAFARER,Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
2361,THE SEAFARER,"Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,"
2362,THE SEAFARER,"Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,"
2363,THE SEAFARER,"All this admonisheth man eager of mood,"
2364,THE SEAFARER,The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
2365,THE SEAFARER,On flood-ways to be far departing.
2366,THE SEAFARER,"Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,"
2367,THE SEAFARER,"He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,"
2368,THE SEAFARER,The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not--
2369,THE SEAFARER,He the prosperous man--what some perform
2370,THE SEAFARER,Where wandering them widest draweth.
2371,THE SEAFARER,"So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,"
2372,THE SEAFARER,"My mood 'mid the mere-flood,"
2373,THE SEAFARER,"Over the whale's acre, would wander wide."
2374,THE SEAFARER,"On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,"
2375,THE SEAFARER,"Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,"
2376,THE SEAFARER,"Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,"
2377,THE SEAFARER,O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
2378,THE SEAFARER,My lord deems to me this dead life
2379,THE SEAFARER,"On loan and on land, I believe not"
2380,THE SEAFARER,That any earth-weal eternal standeth
2381,THE SEAFARER,Save there be somewhat calamitous
2382,THE SEAFARER,"That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain."
2383,THE SEAFARER,Disease or oldness or sword-hate
2384,THE SEAFARER,Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
2385,THE SEAFARER,"And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after--"
2386,THE SEAFARER,"Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,"
2387,THE SEAFARER,"That he will work ere he pass onward,"
2388,THE SEAFARER,"Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,"
2389,THE SEAFARER,"Daring ado,..."
2390,THE SEAFARER,So that all men shall honour him after
2391,THE SEAFARER,"And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,"
2392,THE SEAFARER,"Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,"
2393,THE SEAFARER,Delight mid the doughty.
2394,THE SEAFARER,"Days little durable,"
2395,THE SEAFARER,"And all arrogance of earthen riches,"
2396,THE SEAFARER,There come now no kings nor Cæsars
2397,THE SEAFARER,Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
2398,THE SEAFARER,"Howe'er in mirth most magnified,"
2399,THE SEAFARER,"Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,"
2400,THE SEAFARER,"Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!"
2401,THE SEAFARER,"Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth."
2402,THE SEAFARER,Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
2403,THE SEAFARER,Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
2404,THE SEAFARER,"No man at all going the earth's gait,"
2405,THE SEAFARER,"But age fares against him, his face paleth,"
2406,THE SEAFARER,"Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,"
2407,THE SEAFARER,"Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,"
2408,THE SEAFARER,"Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,"
2409,THE SEAFARER,"Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,"
2410,THE SEAFARER,"Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,"
2411,THE SEAFARER,"And though he strew the grave with gold,"
2412,THE SEAFARER,"His born brothers, their buried bodies"
