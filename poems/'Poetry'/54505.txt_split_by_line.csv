332,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
333,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
334,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,THE poems contained in the following pages must be taken as parts of a
335,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"whole, being intended to be distinct only in their subjects. This will"
336,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,account for the same measure being used throughout.
337,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
338,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of these pieces, the only one which has been previously published is"
339,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"that addressed ""To a Wild Flower."" My reason for inserting it here"
340,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"is, that it harmonizes with the other poems; and, having been already"
341,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"favourably spoken of by competent judges, I must confess it is one"
342,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"which I should ""not willingly let die."""
343,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
344,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"In the first poem on ""Autumn,"" I have introduced what has always"
345,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"appeared to me a beautiful incident in nature; namely, the singing of"
346,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"the missel-thrush during a thunder-storm. The louder the thunder roars,"
347,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,the shriller and sweeter becomes its voice. This interesting little
348,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"bird is popularly known by the name of the storm-cock, because he is"
349,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,supposed to sing boldest immediately previous to a storm; but that he
350,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"also sends forth his ""native wood notes wild,"" during its continuance,"
351,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,is a fact which has been satisfactorily ascertained. Undismayed by the
352,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"tempest's fury, or, rather rejoicing in its violence, the small but"
353,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"spirited songster warbles on unceasingly, as if desirous of emulating"
354,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"the loudness of the thunder-tone, or of making his song be heard above"
355,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,the noise of the raging elements.
356,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
357,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The poetry of nature, particularly at this joyous season, is in its"
358,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"landscapes; and if these unpretending ""Lyrics"" should lead any one to a"
359,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"healthy contemplation of natural objects, or impart, to refined minds,"
360,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"any pleasure in the perusal, the time which has been bestowed upon them"
361,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,will not have been idly or unprofitably employed.

385,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
386,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The vapour from the brow
387,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of the old mountain crests, begins to part,"
388,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Like care from off the forehead, and the heart--"
389,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,And all is cloudless now!
390,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
391,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The universal air,"
392,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The smiling sky, and the far-stretching mead--"
393,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"All nature, in its varied forms agreed,"
394,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Mingle their beauties there!
395,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
396,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The ripple of the wave,"
397,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Beachward returning to the distant shore,"
398,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Like a lone pilgrim to the cottage door,"
399,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,That once a welcome gave:
400,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
401,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The new-waked laureat bee,"
402,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"On the flower-blossom, breathing in its mirth,"
403,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Its conch-like matin song, to greet the earth,"
404,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,With ever grateful glee!
405,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
406,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The landscape's free expanse,"
407,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And all the harmonies that, spread around,"
408,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Combine the joys of hearing, sight, and sound,"
409,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Are gathered at a glance;
410,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
411,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And powerfully they tell,"
412,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"With deeper eloquence than notes divine,"
413,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of many things that round our heart-strings twine,"
414,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,And in our fancies dwell;
415,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
416,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of boyhood's sportive days,"
417,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The thymy glade, the daisy blooming there,"
418,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The vale remote, or lake secluded, where"
419,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The smiling sunbeam plays;
420,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
421,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The gay flowers on the plain,"
422,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Gemming the mead, perfuming all the wood;"
423,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"As if each Summer morn was Spring renew'd,"
424,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Or May-day come again!
425,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
426,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The music of the birds,"
427,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Telling all sleepers of the birth of day,"
428,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And, with reviving Nature, haste to pay"
429,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Their homage, not in words!"
430,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
431,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The dreamy waterfall,"
432,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Babbling and bubbling from the upland spring;
433,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The soaring crag where eaglets rest their wing,"
434,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Listening the eagle's call:
435,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
436,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The minstrel streamlet near,"
437,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The zephyr's breath, too languid for a breeze,"
438,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"That stirs, yet scarcely moves, the gentle trees,"
439,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Touching the waters clear.
440,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
441,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sunrays, as they pass"
442,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Into broad sunshine, throw their light on all,"
443,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"With bloom and blossom, whereso'er they fall;"
444,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"On mount, or meadow-grass."
445,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
446,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,And something more than light

459,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Bringing new joyousness to wood and wild,"
460,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"To ocean, earth, and sky."
461,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
462,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The groups of early flowers
463,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"To th' enamoured sun their bosoms ope,--"
464,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Apt emblems of the welcome birth of Hope,"
465,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,In life's oft darkened bowers.
466,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
467,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Pass to the green hill-side,"
468,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And let us wander where the wild flowers grow,"
469,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Gaze on the sedgy stream's calm depths below,"
470,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Where gentle minnows glide.
471,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
472,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sheltered cuckoo's notes,"
473,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"In the young sunshine, echo on the ear--"
474,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"A moving voice, from all around, is here!--"
475,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Hymns from a thousand throats:--
476,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
477,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The spirit grows the more
478,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Refined and holy, as we stand and gaze"
479,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Upon the landscape, brightening in the blaze"
480,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,That gilds both land and shore.
481,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
482,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"All objects, far and near,"
483,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The light of morn illumines; it is now

486,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
487,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And, lo! there is a stir"
488,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"In yonder village, bosomed in the dell,"
489,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Like a meek babe, loved by its mother well,"
490,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,And loving nought but her!
491,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
492,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Where claims the eye to rest?
493,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Earth has a balmy look, and so has Heaven;"
494,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And thoughts, like mazy clouds through ether driven,"
495,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Float in th' enraptured breast.
496,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
497,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sylvan haunts, where youth"
498,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Roams, fancy led, all glorious in their hue;"
499,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The quaint sequestered spots and paths we view,"
500,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Where Age consorts with Truth.
501,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
502,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Read we of aught that wakes
503,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"High inspiration in the soul, in scenes like these?"
504,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The tufted trees' fantastic tapestries--
505,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Romantic knolls and brakes;
506,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
507,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The hill-enskirted glen,"
508,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Where bound the wild deer; and the huntsman's horn

510,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Till Echo sounds again!
511,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
512,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And more than all, the old"

515,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,As none else of earth's mould
516,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
517,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Hath done: the sun embrowns,"
518,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"But does not scorch them; rain, and wind, and snow,"
519,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Renew them, not destroy; no waste they know,"
520,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,But lasting glory crowns.
521,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
522,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Still to the heart endeared

577,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
578,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sinless flowers, away"

587,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
588,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The virgin rose assumes
589,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"A bridal bearing, as if noonday came,"

672,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The sunbeam does recall:
673,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
674,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,The hope of life above;

714,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
715,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Thy thoughts I can divine,"

719,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,
720,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Of Earth's fresh shrubs and roots;
721,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of Summer days, when men their thirsting slake"

1615,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"Of a far higher, purer, lovelier world;"

1622,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"When the glad morning sun is shining forth,"
1623,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,Passing so silently away from earth;

1634,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,And in its little heart an arrow sought
1635,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"Unsanctified admittance, quivering there,"
1636,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,Like an unwelcome messenger of fate.
1637,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"The spoiler came--I drew his arrow out,"

1651,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,In the lone grave the body soon is clothed
1652,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"In vileness, and this most delicate frame"

1669,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,
1670,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"To go into the grave--if that were all,"

2367,THE WOLF. (4),"Led him to where his lover's hut arose,"
2368,THE WOLF. (4),As if her vicinage could soothe his woes.
2369,THE WOLF. (4),"There for awhile he lingered, and he wept"
2370,THE WOLF. (4),The tear of fond remembrance--slumber crept
2371,THE WOLF. (4),"Upon his eyes, for he was overspent,"
2372,THE WOLF. (4),Wasted for want of needful nourishment:
2373,THE WOLF. (4),"Before him in the moonlight rolled a stream,"
2374,THE WOLF. (4),Whose murmur lulled him to a blissful dream:
2375,THE WOLF. (4),"A dream of love, of happiness and pride,--"

2381,THE WOLF. (4),The lovely maid would steal to think of him;--
2382,THE WOLF. (4),A stir!--a motion!--it was not the breeze
2383,THE WOLF. (4),"That shook the hedge,--for why waved not the trees?"
2384,THE WOLF. (4),"He started and awoke--again it shook,--"
2385,THE WOLF. (4),"His gun was in his hand--one hurried look,"
2386,THE WOLF. (4),"One rapid touch--the fatal ball was sped,--"
2387,THE WOLF. (4),"A long wild shriek was heard, and Giulio's dream was read."
2388,THE WOLF. (4),
2389,THE WOLF. (4),"In triumph now, he thought of home again,--"
2390,THE WOLF. (4),"The prize was his, the wolf at length was slain--"
2391,THE WOLF. (4),"Swift as the ball that from his rifle flew,"
2392,THE WOLF. (4),"He reached the river, and swam gaily through:"
2393,THE WOLF. (4),The corpse lay there before him in the light!--
2394,THE WOLF. (4),Why breaks that mournful shriek upon the night?
2395,THE WOLF. (4),"Why motionless stands Giulio gazing there,"
2396,THE WOLF. (4),"A form of stone, a statue of despair?"
2397,THE WOLF. (4),"At length he spoke--""Is _this_ the wolf I've sought"
2398,THE WOLF. (4),"In glen, and mount, and precipice remote?"
2399,THE WOLF. (4),"Its skin is soft, its eyes are bright and fair,"
2400,THE WOLF. (4),"And still they smile on me,--the wolf's should glare;"
2401,THE WOLF. (4),"But sweet though sad, still do they charm my view,"
2402,THE WOLF. (4),"Like my fair bride's, the beautiful, the blue--"
2403,THE WOLF. (4),"The wolf!--ah, horror! 'tis herself I've slain!"
2404,THE WOLF. (4),"I feel it, like a fire within my brain,"
2405,THE WOLF. (4),And on my heart--no tear is in mine eye--
2406,THE WOLF. (4),"For her alone I lived,--with her I die."""
2407,THE WOLF. (4),"The stream is near, he lifts her as a child,"
2408,THE WOLF. (4),While from his o'erpressed heart there bursts a wild
2409,THE WOLF. (4),"And fiendish laugh,--the peasants wondering hear,"
2410,THE WOLF. (4),"And in a crowd assemble, half in fear:"
2411,THE WOLF. (4),"In the broad moonlight then, as in a dream,"
2412,THE WOLF. (4),A figure rushed before them to the stream;
2413,THE WOLF. (4),That form did bear another--on the brink
2414,THE WOLF. (4),He pauses not--one plunge--they sink! they sink!
2415,THE WOLF. (4),"'Twas Giulio and his bride!--they rise no more,--"
2416,THE WOLF. (4),And onward rolls the stream as smoothly as before.

2755,MOUNT HOREB. (5),A mighty earthquake's shock anon
2756,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Shook to its base the Sacred Mount,"
2757,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"And soon a fire, like a small fount,"

2764,MOUNT HOREB. (5),A still small voice! that speaks to youth
2765,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Of wisdom, piety, and truth:"
2766,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Elijah heard--with solemn pace,"
2767,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"(His mantle covering his face,)"
2768,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He rose and stood without the cave,"
2769,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Relying on God's power to save:
2770,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"The hurricane had past away,"
2771,MOUNT HOREB. (5),And calm and bright the prospect lay;
2772,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Far up the double mountain stood,"
2773,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Varied by water and by wood;
2774,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He saw the herbage thickly grow,"
2775,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"The bubbling springs, and far below"
2776,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He saw the semicircular fount,"
2777,MOUNT HOREB. (5),That like a bent bow skirts the mount;
2778,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He saw the desert spread beneath,"
2779,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Like an extended vale of death;
2780,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He saw the blue sky far above,"

2782,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"A burst, of sunshine fell on him,"
2783,MOUNT HOREB. (5),To which all other light was dim;
2784,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He heard again that still small voice,"
2785,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Which made his inmost heart rejoice:
2786,MOUNT HOREB. (5),It was the Lord! and power he gave
2787,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Elijah, to anoint and save."
2788,MOUNT HOREB. (5),
2789,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Thrice Blessed Mount! thou art a sign,"

2793,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Of sin, and doubt, the welcome light"
2794,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Of truth breaks sudden on our sight;
2795,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"The heart becomes a hallowed dome,"
2796,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Where holy feelings find a home;
2797,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"For there the law of God secure,"
2798,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Makes every thought and impulse pure:
2799,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Repentance may be slow to bring
2800,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Comfort and healing on its wing;
2801,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"The doubting sinner in despair,"
2802,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Asks, trembling, in a hurried prayer,"
2803,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"If guilt like his, of foulest trace,"
2804,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Can hope for pardon and for grace:
2805,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"But, when such doubts are swept away,"
2806,MOUNT HOREB. (5),The still small voice of truth bears sway:
2807,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"For Jesus died and rose again,"
2808,MOUNT HOREB. (5),To free the world from guilt and pain:
2809,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Jesus, the only Son of God,"
2810,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Like Moses, takes the gospel rod,"
2811,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"And strikes the barren rock within,"
2812,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Hardened by wickedness and sin--
2813,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Whence springs a living well, to free"
2814,MOUNT HOREB. (5),The thirsty soul from misery.
2815,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"He, like Elijah from his cave,"
2816,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Came to the world with power to save;
2817,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"And Israel, trusting to his aid,"
2818,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Shall innocent and pure be made;
2819,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Redeemed, shall reach the heavenly land,"
2820,MOUNT HOREB. (5),Supported by his mighty hand.

4051,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,And now in course of worldly changes

4085,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4086,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"A time of gloom, and doubt, and terror,"

4090,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4091,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"A time of judgment, when God's dealings"

4120,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4121,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Bent near the Doctor then, and laid he"

4124,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"No more words than ""the eagle's nest!"""
4125,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4126,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"The change was sudden and amazing,--"

4130,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4131,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Gasped a long breath, as if a struggle"

4133,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"No sound made but a low faint guggle,"
4134,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Like cry of infant newly born.
4135,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4136,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"A smile passed o'er her features sunken,"

4138,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Remembrance, just as one half-drunken,"
4139,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Strove to retrace its course again.
4140,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4141,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Ah! then came back the well-known faces

4146,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,She saw her father as he taught her
4147,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Her youthful lessons at his knee,"
4148,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Where Mississippi's mighty water
4149,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Rolls like a full flood to the sea.
4150,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4151,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,She saw her mother too beside her
4152,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Long, long since taken to her rest,"
4153,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"And then, as opened Memory wider,"
4154,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"She stood beneath the eagle's nest,"
4155,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4156,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"With him she loved, in courtship prudent,"
4157,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"And of love's sweetest cup she drank,"
4158,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"She saw again the youthful student,--"
4159,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,All that came after was a blank.
4160,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4161,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Thus ever Memory touched can bring time,"
4162,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"With its past feelings into light,"
4163,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,And thus the sweet joys of her spring-time
4164,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Came rushing thickly on her sight.
4165,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4166,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Thus, too, doth roused Imagination"

4173,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Her pulse resumed a quickened beating,"
4174,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,Revolved the wheels of life again.
4175,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,
4176,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,And day by day she gained new strength then

4604,HUMAN CONDUCT.,On health is oft a teller.
4605,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4606,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He had an eye for bales and goods,"
4607,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And turnings of the market;
4608,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But for the country's picturesque,"
4609,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His shadow rare did dark it.
4610,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4611,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He rode out had to breathe the air,"
4612,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And give his nerves a bracing,"
4613,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"His steed unruly had become,"
4614,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His horsemanship disgracing.
4615,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4616,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The countryman pulled up some grass,"
4617,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"No readier thing appearing,"
4618,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And rubbed him down in ostler style,"
4619,HUMAN CONDUCT.,The mud from off him clearing.
4620,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4621,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And then for having saved his life,--"
4622,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"To cut my tale the shorter,--"
4623,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He offered him, as a reward,"
4624,HUMAN CONDUCT.,To take him as his porter;
4625,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4626,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And if he showed capacity,"
4627,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"To give him education,"
4628,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"To make him fit in course of time,"
4629,HUMAN CONDUCT.,To fill a higher station.
4630,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4631,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The youth agreed to't, for he thought,"
4632,HUMAN CONDUCT.,(While handing back the bridle)
4633,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He'd like the change, besides just then"
4634,HUMAN CONDUCT.,He happened to be idle.
4635,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4636,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"In Glasgow busy city now,"
4637,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Behold this country clown bred,"
4638,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"First porter and then junior clerk,"
4639,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And learning to be town bred.
4640,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4641,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Years passed, the sun shines once a day,"
4642,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But days make years, and every"
4643,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Sun that rises counts one, thus time"
4644,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Flows on, as water rivery."
4645,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4646,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Through all gradations of the desk
4647,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The youth, still true and steady,"
4648,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Had risen till, from senior clerk,"
4649,HUMAN CONDUCT.,He partner was already.
4650,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4651,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The merchant now, as commerce had"
4652,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"To counting-house long held him,"
4653,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Resolved to take his ease at last,"
4654,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And came to business seldom:
4655,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4656,HUMAN CONDUCT.,The junior partner and head-clerk
4657,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Care of the cash-box keeping,"
4658,HUMAN CONDUCT.,While he himself had chosen to be
4659,HUMAN CONDUCT.,What's called the partner sleeping.
4660,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4661,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The countryman, no longer young,"
4662,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Had toiled both late and early,"
4663,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And gained some wealth, and 'twas his boast"
4664,HUMAN CONDUCT.,That he had won it fairly.
4665,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4666,HUMAN CONDUCT.,But with it he had learnt betimes
4667,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And aye the more the faster,"
4668,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Some of the city's ways that were
4669,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Not pleasing to his master.
4670,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4671,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He ne'er had married, and was fond"
4672,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Of being hospitable;
4673,HUMAN CONDUCT.,For 'twas his pride always to have
4674,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His friends around his table:
4675,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4676,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And so extravagant became,"
4677,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"To feasting much addicted,"
4678,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And rich wines drinking, which of course"
4679,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His income much restricted.
4680,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4681,HUMAN CONDUCT.,One night his master was in town
4682,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And heard he had a party,"
4683,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"An old man now, not wanting sense,"
4684,HUMAN CONDUCT.,But humorous and hearty;
4685,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4686,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Yet this he to himself oft thought,"
4687,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He thought that 'twas a pity,"
4688,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His clerk should spend his money in
4689,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Thus feasting all the city.
4690,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4691,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And so resolved to call on him
4692,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And bring him to his senses,"
4693,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Not by a lecture commonplace
4694,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Of prudence and expenses:
4695,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4696,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But by a something which he had,"
4697,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"A sort of old memento,"
4698,HUMAN CONDUCT.,That in his judgment was well worth
4699,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Of lectures grave a cento.
4700,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4701,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"It was a frosty night, and there"
4702,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Had been a fall of snow on,"
4703,HUMAN CONDUCT.,The slippery streets required great skill
4704,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And caution them to go on.
4705,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4706,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"With but one fall, he reached the house,"
4707,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The entrance well he knew there,"
4708,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Sudden and unexpected burst
4709,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Amidst the jovial crew there.
4710,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4711,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The gas burnt clear, the host looked blue,"
4712,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And not the lights, as use is"
4713,HUMAN CONDUCT.,When one particular guest appears
4714,HUMAN CONDUCT.,That no one introduces.
4715,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4716,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He said, ""Lies the skeleton frost"
4717,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"On one street and another,"
4718,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""I tripped and fell, and where I lay"
4719,HUMAN CONDUCT.,One skeleton hugged his brother.
4720,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4721,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""His breath is on each pane congealed,"
4722,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Cold enters through each portal,"
4723,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""How my teeth chatter with the cold,"
4724,HUMAN CONDUCT.,A sign that we are mortal.
4725,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4726,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""What's this, a banquet spread and rich,"
4727,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The wines all bright and glowing,"
4728,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""No thought of this when you I met"
4729,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Along the road-side going."""
4730,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4731,HUMAN CONDUCT.,He then produced a bundle which
4732,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He opened with derision,"
4733,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And singly held up the contents
4734,HUMAN CONDUCT.,To their astonished vision.
4735,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4736,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"There was the wellworn hairy cap,"
4737,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The corderoys to back it,"
4738,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"His host had owned, and there too was"
4739,HUMAN CONDUCT.,His former fustian jacket.
4740,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4741,HUMAN CONDUCT.,These were the clothes the country lad
4742,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Had on at their first meeting,"
4743,HUMAN CONDUCT.,And these he now brought forth to be
4744,HUMAN CONDUCT.,To him his present greeting;
4745,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4746,HUMAN CONDUCT.,That he might pause in his career
4747,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Of jollity and revel,"
4748,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Lest in his age, reduced he should"
4749,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Be to his former level.
4750,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4751,HUMAN CONDUCT.,'Tis strange that human conduct oft
4752,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"So reckless is and hollow,"
4753,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"That when the right path reason shows,"
4754,HUMAN CONDUCT.,It seeks the wrong to follow.
4755,HUMAN CONDUCT.,
4756,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The master having said and done,"
4757,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Quick vanished from them after:
4758,HUMAN CONDUCT.,The host attempted at the time
4759,HUMAN CONDUCT.,To turn it off with laughter.
4760,HUMAN CONDUCT.,Next morn reflection made him take
4761,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The hint,--and to be brief then,--"
4762,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Though roughly put, 'twas kindly meant,--"
4763,HUMAN CONDUCT.,He turned o'er a new leaf then.

4772,MORAL.,
4773,MORAL.,"Instead of gen'ral moral saws,"

4893,THE POET.,I WAS told yesterday by one with wise
4894,THE POET.,"Solemn aspect, and wrinkles 'bout his eyes,"
4895,THE POET.,"That poetry is an idle trade, alack!"
4896,THE POET.,"He had a good black coat upon his back,"
4897,THE POET.,"And deemed himself respectable,--he said, too,"
4898,THE POET.,That he who verses writes will never do
4899,THE POET.,"Well in the world, that his character is gone,"
4900,THE POET.,And he himself no better than a drone.
4901,THE POET.,So having said he walked away well pleased;--
4902,THE POET.,"Now that's a man, I say, whose mind's diseased."
4903,THE POET.,Has he in summer ever watched a rose
4904,THE POET.,"Burst into blossoming, and as it grows"
4905,THE POET.,"More and more beautiful, sweeten all the air"
4906,THE POET.,"With its rich perfume,--poetry was there."
4907,THE POET.,
4908,THE POET.,A sunbeam thrown across
4909,THE POET.,"The clouds, that makes them glow"
4910,THE POET.,With light ineffable
4911,THE POET.,To eyes from earth below;
4912,THE POET.,A small wave of the sea
4913,THE POET.,When the vast ocean waits
4914,THE POET.,"The coming of the storm,"
4915,THE POET.,That slightly agitates
4916,THE POET.,"Its surface passing,--as"
4917,THE POET.,When of danger near
4918,THE POET.,"First made aware, the roused"
4919,THE POET.,"Lion, though not in fear"
4920,THE POET.,"Looks up, the watchfire then"

4923,THE POET.,"Moved, nor erected high"

4928,THE POET.,"A priest of Nature's own,"
4929,THE POET.,"One she herself ordains,"

4941,THE POET.,They speak to him alone
4942,THE POET.,"With low and whispering voice,"
4943,THE POET.,Like gentle maiden to
4944,THE POET.,The lover of her choice.
4945,THE POET.,
4946,THE POET.,And none but he can tell

4963,THE POET.,"And voices of the past,"
4964,THE POET.,"With fancies of old times,"
4965,THE POET.,Do their murmurings recall
4966,THE POET.,Which he fondly puts in rhymes.
4967,THE POET.,
4968,THE POET.,Echoes of distant lands

4975,THE POET.,Of care-worn worldly men.
4976,THE POET.,And ever for his kind
4977,THE POET.,"Doth his spirit warmly yearn,"
4978,THE POET.,And his verses speak of things

5004,THE POET.,"Been a worldling born,"

5656,BYRON.,"According to the Guide Books, Loch Awe and its vicinity, more perhaps"
5657,BYRON.,"than any other district in the Highlands, abound with memorials of"
5658,BYRON.,"former ages. The lake is thirty miles in extent, and of the average"
5659,BYRON.,"breadth of one, although in some places it does not exceed half a"
5660,BYRON.,"mile. It is surrounded by mountains finely wooded, and like many of"
5661,BYRON.,"the Scottish lakes, its surface is studded over with small islands,"
5662,BYRON.,"beautifully tufted with trees, and some of them large enough to admit"
5663,BYRON.,of being pastured. Upon the island of Innis-Hail are the remains of
5664,BYRON.,a convent; and on a rocky promontory at the eastern extremity of the
5665,BYRON.,"lake stand the magnificent ruins of Kilchurn Castle. This structure,"
5666,BYRON.,"which still exhibits the vestiges of a castellated square tower, was"
5667,BYRON.,"built in 1440, by Sir John Campbell, (second son of Argyle,) Knight of"
5668,BYRON.,"Rhodes, and ancestor of the Breadalbane family, and in later times it"
5669,BYRON.,"became, from the extensive view it commanded of the lake, the favourite"
5670,BYRON.,residence of the chiefs of the family. In 1745 it was garrisoned by
5671,BYRON.,"the king's troops, in order to defend the pass into the Highlands, and"
5672,BYRON.,"secure the tranquillity of the country. Emerging from the ocean, and"
5673,BYRON.,"rising on the north-east bank of Loch Awe, soars Ben Cruachan, the"
5674,BYRON.,"largest mountain in Argyleshire. Its perpendicular height is 3,390"
5675,BYRON.,"feet above the level of the sea, and its circumference at the base is"
5676,BYRON.,"upwards of twenty miles. On the south, the ascent is gentle nearly to"
5677,BYRON.,"the summit, where it rises abrupt, and divides into two points, each"
5678,BYRON.,"having the form of a sugar-loaf. Before the storm, ""the spirit of the"
5679,BYRON.,"mountain shrieks"" from Ben Cruachan, Ben Doran, and some other Highland"
5680,BYRON.,"mountains. When Burke made his tour in Scotland, he declared that Loch"
5681,BYRON.,Awe was the most picturesque lake he had ever seen. It was in a narrow
5682,BYRON.,pass in the vicinity of this lake that King Robert Bruce defeated the
5683,BYRON.,"Macdougals of Lorn, in 1308. In Loch Awe are found salmon, trout, eels,"
5684,BYRON.,and other fresh water fish. The lake discharges itself by the river Awe
5685,BYRON.,into Loch Etive at Bunawe Ferry.

5705,"NOTE 4, PAGE 87.","unavailing pursuit of the savage beast, which he had seen entering a"
5706,"NOTE 4, PAGE 87.",wood about three leagues distant with the child in its jaws. The whole
5707,"NOTE 4, PAGE 87.","village immediately renewed the chase; the mother, arming herself with"
