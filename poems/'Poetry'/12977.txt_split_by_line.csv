210,IN EXPLANATION,"Many of the verses in this book are republished, with considerable"
211,IN EXPLANATION,"alterations, from various newspapers. The collection includes few not"
212,IN EXPLANATION,relating to persons and events more or less familiar to the people of
213,IN EXPLANATION,the Pacific Coast--to whom the volume may be considered as especially
214,IN EXPLANATION,"addressed, though, not without a hope that some part of the contents"
215,IN EXPLANATION,may be found to have sufficient intrinsic interest to commend it to
216,IN EXPLANATION,"others. In that case, doubtless, commentators will be ""raised up"" to"
217,IN EXPLANATION,"make exposition of its full meaning, with possibly an added meaning"
218,IN EXPLANATION,read into it by themselves.
219,IN EXPLANATION,
220,IN EXPLANATION,"Of my motives in writing, and in now republishing, I do not care to"
221,IN EXPLANATION,"make either defense or explanation, except with reference to those"
222,IN EXPLANATION,persons who since my first censure of them have passed away. To one
223,IN EXPLANATION,having only a reader's interest in the matter it may easily seem that
224,IN EXPLANATION,the verses relating to those might more properly have been omitted
225,IN EXPLANATION,"from this collection. But if these pieces, or, indeed, if any"
226,IN EXPLANATION,"considerable part of my work in literature, have the intrinsic worth"
227,IN EXPLANATION,"which by this attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed, their"
228,IN EXPLANATION,"permanent suppression is impossible, and it is only a question of when"
229,IN EXPLANATION,and by whom they shall be republished. Some one will surely search
230,IN EXPLANATION,them out and put them in circulation.
231,IN EXPLANATION,
232,IN EXPLANATION,I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work
233,IN EXPLANATION,collected in his lifetime; and this seems to me especially true of one
234,IN EXPLANATION,"whose work, necessarily engendering animosities, is peculiarly exposed"
235,IN EXPLANATION,to challenge as unjust. That is a charge that can be best examined
236,IN EXPLANATION,before time has effaced the evidence. For the death of a man of whom
237,IN EXPLANATION,I may have written what I venture to think worthy to live I am no way
238,IN EXPLANATION,"responsible; and, however sincerely I may regret it, I can hardly be"
239,IN EXPLANATION,expected to consent that it shall affect my fortunes. If the satirist
240,IN EXPLANATION,who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that while condemning the
241,IN EXPLANATION,sin he should spare the sinner were bound to let the life of his work
242,IN EXPLANATION,be coterminous with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar
243,IN EXPLANATION,hardship.
244,IN EXPLANATION,
245,IN EXPLANATION,"Persuaded of the validity of all this, I have not hesitated to reprint"
246,IN EXPLANATION,"even certain ""epitaphs"" which, once of the living, are now of the"
247,IN EXPLANATION,"dead, as all the others must eventually be. The objection inheres"
248,IN EXPLANATION,in all forms of applied satire--my understanding of whose laws and
249,IN EXPLANATION,liberties is at least derived from reverent study of the masters.
250,IN EXPLANATION,That in respect of matters herein mentioned I have but followed their
251,IN EXPLANATION,practice can be shown by abundant instance and example.

259,THE KEY NOTE,
260,THE KEY NOTE,
261,THE KEY NOTE,I dreamed I was dreaming one morn as I lay
262,THE KEY NOTE,In a garden with flowers teeming.
263,THE KEY NOTE,"On an island I lay in a mystical bay,"
264,THE KEY NOTE,In the dream that I dreamed I was dreaming.
265,THE KEY NOTE,
266,THE KEY NOTE,The ghost of a scent--had it followed me there
267,THE KEY NOTE,From the place where I truly was resting?
268,THE KEY NOTE,"It filled like an anthem the aisles of the air,"
269,THE KEY NOTE,The presence of roses attesting.
270,THE KEY NOTE,
271,THE KEY NOTE,Yet I thought in the dream that I dreamed I dreamed
272,THE KEY NOTE,That the place was all barren of roses--
273,THE KEY NOTE,"That it only seemed; and the place, I deemed,"
274,THE KEY NOTE,Was the Isle of Bewildered Noses.
275,THE KEY NOTE,
276,THE KEY NOTE,Full many a seaman had testified
277,THE KEY NOTE,"How all who sailed near were enchanted,"
278,THE KEY NOTE,And landed to search (and in searching died)
279,THE KEY NOTE,For the roses the Sirens had planted.
280,THE KEY NOTE,
281,THE KEY NOTE,"For the Sirens were dead, and the billows boomed"
282,THE KEY NOTE,In the stead of their singing forever;
283,THE KEY NOTE,"But the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed,"
284,THE KEY NOTE,Though man had discovered them never.
285,THE KEY NOTE,
286,THE KEY NOTE,"I thought in my dream 'twas an idle tale,"
287,THE KEY NOTE,A delusion that mariners cherished--
288,THE KEY NOTE,That the fragrance loading the conscious gale
289,THE KEY NOTE,Was the ghost of a rose long perished.
290,THE KEY NOTE,
291,THE KEY NOTE,"I said, ""I will fly from this island of woes."""
292,THE KEY NOTE,"And acting on that decision,"
293,THE KEY NOTE,"By that odor of rose I was led by the nose,"
294,THE KEY NOTE,"For 'twas truly, ah! truly, Elysian."
295,THE KEY NOTE,
296,THE KEY NOTE,"I ran, in my madness, to seek out the source"
297,THE KEY NOTE,Of the redolent river--directed
298,THE KEY NOTE,"By some supernatural, sinister force"
299,THE KEY NOTE,"To a forest, dark, haunted, infected."
300,THE KEY NOTE,
301,THE KEY NOTE,And still as I threaded ('twas all in the dream
302,THE KEY NOTE,That I dreamed I was dreaming) each turning
303,THE KEY NOTE,There were many a scream and a sudden gleam
304,THE KEY NOTE,Of eyes all uncannily burning!
305,THE KEY NOTE,
306,THE KEY NOTE,The leaves were all wet with a horrible dew
307,THE KEY NOTE,"That mirrored the red moon's crescent,"
308,THE KEY NOTE,"And all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue,"
309,THE KEY NOTE,"Dim, wavering, phosphorescent."
310,THE KEY NOTE,
311,THE KEY NOTE,"But the fragrance divine, coming strong and free,"
312,THE KEY NOTE,"Led me on, though my blood was clotting,"
313,THE KEY NOTE,"Till--ah, joy!--I could see, on the limbs of a tree,"
314,THE KEY NOTE,Mine enemies hanging and rotting!

324,CAIN,His forfeit life to balk thy holy will
325,CAIN,That spares him for the ripening of wrath.
326,CAIN,
327,CAIN,"Already, lo! the red sign is descried,"
328,CAIN,To trembling jurors visibly revealed:
329,CAIN,"The prison doors obediently yield,"
330,CAIN,The baffled hangman flings the cord aside.
331,CAIN,
332,CAIN,"Powell, the brother's blood that marks your trail--"
333,CAIN,"Hark, how it cries against you from the ground,"
334,CAIN,Like the far baying of the tireless hound.
335,CAIN,Faith! to your ear it is no nightingale.

337,CAIN,What signifies the date upon a stone?
338,CAIN,To-morrow you shall die if not to-day.
339,CAIN,What matter when the Avenger choose to slay
340,CAIN,Or soon or late the Devil gets his own.
341,CAIN,
342,CAIN,Thenceforth through all eternity you'll hold
343,CAIN,No one advantage of the later death.
344,CAIN,Though you had granted Ralph another breath
345,CAIN,Would _he_ to-day less silent lie and cold?
346,CAIN,
347,CAIN,"Earth cares not, curst assassin, when you die;"
348,CAIN,You never will be readier than now.

357,AN OBITUARIAN,
358,AN OBITUARIAN,"Death-poet Pickering sat at his desk,"
359,AN OBITUARIAN,Wrapped in appropriate gloom;
360,AN OBITUARIAN,"His posture was pensive and picturesque,"
361,AN OBITUARIAN,Like a raven charming a tomb.
362,AN OBITUARIAN,
363,AN OBITUARIAN,Enter a party a-drinking the cup
364,AN OBITUARIAN,Of sorrow--and likewise of woe:
365,AN OBITUARIAN,"""Some harrowing poetry, Mister, whack up,"
366,AN OBITUARIAN,All wrote in the key of O.
367,AN OBITUARIAN,
368,AN OBITUARIAN,"""For the angels has called my old woman hence"
369,AN OBITUARIAN,From the strife (where she fit mighty free).
370,AN OBITUARIAN,It's a nickel a line? Cond--n the expense!
371,AN OBITUARIAN,"For wealth is now little to me."""
372,AN OBITUARIAN,
373,AN OBITUARIAN,The Bard of Mortality looked him through
374,AN OBITUARIAN,In the piercingest sort of a way:
375,AN OBITUARIAN,"""It is much to me though it's little to you--"
376,AN OBITUARIAN,"I've _taken_ a wife to-day."""
377,AN OBITUARIAN,
378,AN OBITUARIAN,So he twisted the tail of his mental cow
379,AN OBITUARIAN,And made her give down her flow.
380,AN OBITUARIAN,"The grief of that bard was long-winded, somehow--"
381,AN OBITUARIAN,There was reams and reamses of woe.
382,AN OBITUARIAN,
383,AN OBITUARIAN,The widower man which had buried his wife
384,AN OBITUARIAN,"Grew lily-like round each gill,"
385,AN OBITUARIAN,For she turned in her grave and came back to life--
386,AN OBITUARIAN,Then he cruel ignored the bill!
387,AN OBITUARIAN,
388,AN OBITUARIAN,"Then Sorrow she opened her gates a-wide,"
389,AN OBITUARIAN,"As likewise did also Woe,"
390,AN OBITUARIAN,"And the death-poet's song, as is heard inside,"
391,AN OBITUARIAN,Is sang in the key of O.

401,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Hotly disputing, for each swore his own"
402,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Were clearly keener than the other's ills.
403,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"And, truly, each had much to boast of--bone"
404,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"And sinew, muscle, tallow, nerve and skin,"
405,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin,"
406,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Teeth, eyes and other organs (for the soul"
407,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Has all of these and even a wagging chin)
408,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Blazing and coruscating like a coal!
409,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"For Lower Sacramento, you remember,"
410,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Has trying weather, even in mid-December."
411,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,
412,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Now this occurred in the far future. All
413,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Mankind had been a million ages dead,"
414,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"And each to her reward above had sped,"
415,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Each to his punishment below,--I call"
416,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"That quite a just arrangement. As I said,"
417,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain
418,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main.
419,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"For, when on earth, they'd freed a scurvy host"
420,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Of crooks from the State prison, who again"
421,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast
422,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,And (such the felon's predatory nature)
423,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Even got themselves into the Legislature.
424,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,
425,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared
426,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,In Hades. It is true all other males
427,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails,"
428,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,But did not suffer _them_; whereas _they_ bored
429,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Each one the other. But indeed my tale's
430,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Not getting on at all. They lay and browned
431,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Till Boruck (who long since his teeth had ground
432,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made
433,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Stump speeches even in praying) looked around
434,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,And said to Bob's incinerated shade:
435,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"""Your Excellency, this is mighty hard on"
436,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"The inventors of the unpardonable pardon."""
437,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,
438,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"The other soul--his right hand all aflame,"
439,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"For 'twas with that he'd chiefly sinned, although"
440,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"His tongue, too, like a wick was working woe"
441,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,To the reserve of tallow in his frame--
442,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Said, with a sputtering, uncertain flow,"
443,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,And with a gesture like a shaken torch:
444,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"""Yes, but I'm sure we'll not much longer scorch."
445,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Although this climate is not good for Hope,"
446,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Whose joyous wing 'twould singe, I think the porch"
447,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Of Hell we'll quit with a pacific slope.
448,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,Last century I signified repentance
449,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"And asked for commutation of our sentence."""
450,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,
451,A COMMUTED SENTENCE,"Even as he spoke, the form of Satan loomed"

3610,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"If, luckless, I so often cross his way,"
3611,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"Though I've three senses besides that of touch,"
3612,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,To make me conscious of a fool too much.
3613,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"Seek him, friend Killer, and your purpose make"
3614,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"Apparent as his guilty hand you take,"
3615,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"And set him trembling with a solemn: ""Shake!"""

3621,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,Strews notes of introduction o'er the land
3622,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,And calls it hospitality--his hand

3630,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"A rare good riddance, an unwelcome guest."
3631,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,The glad consignor rubs his hands to think
3632,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,How duty is commuted into ink;
3633,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,The consignee (his hands he cannot rub--
3634,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"He has the man upon them) mutters: ""Cub!"""
3635,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,And straightway plans to lose him at the Club.
3636,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"You know, good Killer, where this dunce abides--"
3637,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,The secret jungle where he writes and hides--

3640,TO THE FOOL-KILLER,"Go, bring his blood! We'll drink it--letting fall"

3710,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"I should like, good friends, to mention the disaster which befell"
3711,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Mr. William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel,"
3712,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Whose fate is full of meaning, if correctly understood--"
3713,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Admonition to the haughty, consolation to the good."
3714,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3715,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"It happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred,"
3716,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"When 'twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird,"
3717,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"And men exclaimed: ""By Hunky!"" who were bad enough to swear,"
3718,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And pious persons supervised their adjectives with care.
3719,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3720,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Mr. Peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute,"
3721,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"His learning comprehensive, multifarious, minute."
3722,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,It was commonly conceded in the section whence he came
3723,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,That the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game.
3724,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3725,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"And some there were who whispered, in the town of Muscatel,"
3726,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,That besides the game of Draw he knew Orthography as well;
3727,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Though, the school directors, frigidly contemning that as stuff,"
3728,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Thought that Draw (and maybe Spelling, if it pleased him) was enough."
3729,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3730,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Withal, he was a haughty man--indubitably great,"
3731,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,But too vain of his attainments and his power in debate.
3732,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,His mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift:
3733,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""It's only _me_,"" he said, ""can give the human mind a lift."
3734,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3735,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""Before a proper audience, if ever I've a chance,"
3736,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"You'll see me chipping in, the cause of Learning to advance."
3737,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Just let me have a decent chance to back my mental hand
3738,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"And I'll come to center lightly in a way they'll understand."""
3739,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3740,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Such was William Perry Peters, and I feel a poignant sense"
3741,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Of grief that I'm unable to employ the present tense;
3742,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"But Providence disposes, be our scheming what it may,"
3743,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"And disposed of Mr. Peters in a cold, regardless way."
3744,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3745,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"It occurred in San Francisco, whither Mr. Peters came"
3746,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"In the cause of Education, feeling still the holy flame"
3747,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind
3748,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,To a higher plane of knowledge than its Architect designed.
3749,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3750,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,He attended the convention of the pedagogic host;
3751,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"He was first in the Pavilion, he was last to leave his post."
3752,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"For days and days he narrowly observed the Chairman's eye,"
3753,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,His efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly.
3754,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3755,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,The blessed moment came at last: the Chairman tipped his head.
3756,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""The gentleman from ah--um--er,"" that functionary said."
3757,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,The gentleman from ah--um--er reflected with a grin:
3758,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""They'll know me better by-and-by, when I'm a-chipping in."""
3759,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3760,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,So William Perry Peters mounted cheerfully his feet--
3761,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And straightway was aglow with an incalculable heat!
3762,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"His face was as effulgent as a human face could be,"
3763,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And caloric emanated from his whole periphery;
3764,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3765,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"For he felt himself the focus of non-Muscatelish eyes,"
3766,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And the pain of their convergence was a terror and surprise.
3767,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,As with pitiless impaction all their heat-waves on him broke
3768,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,He was seen to be evolving awful quantities of smoke!
3769,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3770,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""Put him out!"" cried all in chorus; but the meaning wasn't clear"
3771,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Of that succoring suggestion to his obfuscated ear;
3772,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And it notably augmented his incinerating glow
3773,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"To regard himself excessive, or in any way _de trop_."
3774,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3775,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Gone was all his wild ambition to lift up the human mind!--
3776,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Gone the words he would have uttered!--gone the thought that lay behind!
3777,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"For ""words that burn"" may be consumed in a superior flame,"
3778,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"And ""thoughts that breathe"" may breathe their last, and die a death of shame."
3779,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3780,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"He'd known himself a shining light, but never had he known"
3781,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Himself so very luminous as now he knew he shone.
3782,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"""A pillar, I, of fire,"" he'd said, ""to guide my race will be;"""
3783,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And now that very inconvenient thing to him was he.
3784,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3785,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,He stood there all irresolute; the seconds went and came;
3786,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,The minutes passed and did but add fresh fuel to his flame.
3787,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,How long he stood he knew not--'twas a century or more--
3788,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,And then that incandescent man levanted for the door!
3789,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,
3790,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"He darted like a comet from the building to the street,"
3791,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Where Fahrenheit attested ninety-five degrees of heat.
3792,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,Vicissitudes of climate make the tenure of the breath
3793,THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS,"Precarious, and William Perry Peters froze to death!"

5505,INDICTED,Your crooked course more recently is not

9205,THE REV. JOSEPH,But when his tomb the Deacon's burst
9206,THE REV. JOSEPH,(Of two he'll always be the first)
9207,THE REV. JOSEPH,He'll see by studying the stones
9208,THE REV. JOSEPH,"That he's obtained his proper bones,"
9209,THE REV. JOSEPH,"Then, seeking Sammy's vault, unlock it,"
9210,THE REV. JOSEPH,And put that person in his pocket.

9213,THE REV. JOSEPH,
9214,THE REV. JOSEPH,Beneath this stone O'Donnell's tongue's at rest--
9215,THE REV. JOSEPH,Our noses by his spirit still addressed.
9216,THE REV. JOSEPH,"Living or dead, he's equally Satanic--"
9217,THE REV. JOSEPH,His noise a terror and his smell a panic.

9222,THE REV. JOSEPH,"And swears that Time's forever past,"
9223,THE REV. JOSEPH,"Days, weeks, months, years all one at last,"
9224,THE REV. JOSEPH,"Then Asa Fiske, laid here, distressed,"

9226,THE REV. JOSEPH,There'll be no rate of interest!

9232,THE REV. JOSEPH,He killed a man--the labor party rose
9233,THE REV. JOSEPH,And showed him by its love how killing goes.

9244,THE REV. JOSEPH,Here Porter Ashe is laid to rest
9245,THE REV. JOSEPH,Green grows the grass upon his breast.
9246,THE REV. JOSEPH,"This patron of the turf, I vow,"
9247,THE REV. JOSEPH,Ne'er served it half so well as now.

9253,THE REV. JOSEPH,"He cried: ""Cold water!"" roaring like a beast."
9254,THE REV. JOSEPH,'Twas thrown upon him and the music ceased.

9259,THE REV. JOSEPH,"When, like a jewel from its casket,"
9260,THE REV. JOSEPH,"Fell Felton out. Said Estee, shouting"
9261,THE REV. JOSEPH,"With mirth; ""I've given you an outing."""
9262,THE REV. JOSEPH,Then told him to go back. He wouldn't.
9263,THE REV. JOSEPH,Then tried to _put_ him back. He couldn't.
9264,THE REV. JOSEPH,So Estee died (his blood congealing
9265,THE REV. JOSEPH,In Felton's growing shadow) squealing.

9271,THE REV. JOSEPH,To noses of critics and scholars.
9272,THE REV. JOSEPH,If now he'd an office to sell could
9273,THE REV. JOSEPH,"He sell it? O, no--where (in Hell) could"
9274,THE REV. JOSEPH,He find a cool four hundred dollars?
