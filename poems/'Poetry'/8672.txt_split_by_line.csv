24,NOTE,
25,NOTE,For the present volume over two thousand poems by Clare have been
26,NOTE,considered and compared; of which over two-thirds have not been
27,NOTE,"published. Of those here given ninety are now first printed, and are"
28,NOTE,distinguished with asterisks in the contents: one or two are gleaned
29,NOTE,from periodicals: and many of the others have been brought into line
30,NOTE,with manuscript versions. While poetic value has been the general
31,NOTE,"ground of selection, the development of the poet has seemed of"
32,NOTE,sufficient interest for representation; and some of Clare's juvenilia
33,NOTE,"are accordingly included. The arrangement is chronological, though"
34,NOTE,in many cases the date of a poem can only be conjectured from the
35,NOTE,handwriting and the style; and it is almost impossible to affix dates
36,NOTE,to such Asylum Poems as bear none.
37,NOTE,
38,NOTE,Punctuation and orthography have been attempted; Clare left such
39,NOTE,"matters to his editor in his lifetime, conceiving them to be an"
40,NOTE,"""awkward squad."" In some poems stanzas have been omitted, particularly"
41,NOTE,in the case of first drafts which demand revision; but in others
42,NOTE,stanzas dropped by previous editors have been restored. Titles have
43,NOTE,"been given to many poems which, doubtless, in copies not available to"
44,NOTE,us were better christened by Clare himself. So regularly does Clare
45,NOTE,"use such forms as ""oer,"" ""eer,"" and the like that he seems to have"
46,NOTE,"regarded them not as abbreviations but as originals, and they are"
47,NOTE,given without apostrophe. The text of the Asylum Poems which has been
48,NOTE,"used is a transcript, and one or two difficult passages are probably"
49,NOTE,the fault of the copyist.
50,NOTE,
51,NOTE,For permission to examine and copy many of the poems preserved in the
52,NOTE,"Peterborough Museum, and to have photographs taken, we are indebted"
53,NOTE,"to J. W. Bodger, Esq., the President for 1919-1920; without whose"
54,NOTE,co-operation and interest the volume would have been a very different
55,NOTE,"matter. Valuable help, too, has been given by Mr. Samuel Loveman of"
56,NOTE,"Cleveland, Ohio, who has placed at our disposal his collection of"
57,NOTE,"Clare MSS. To G. C. Druce, Esq., of Oxford, whose pamphlet on Clare's"
58,NOTE,knowledge of flowers cannot but delight the lover of Clare: to the
59,NOTE,"Rev. S. G. Short of Maxey, and formerly of Northborough: to J."
60,NOTE,"Middleton Murry, Esq., the Editor of the _Athenaeum_: to Edward"
61,NOTE,"Liveing, Esq., and E. G. Clayton, Esq.: and to Norman Gale, Esq., who"
62,NOTE,"has not wavered from his early faith in Clare, our gratitude is gladly"
63,NOTE,given for assistance and sympathy.
64,NOTE,
65,NOTE,"And to Mr. Samuel Sefton of Derby, the grandson of Clare and one of"
66,NOTE,"his closest investigators, who has patiently and carefully responded"
67,NOTE,"to all our queries in a long correspondence, and who, besides"
68,NOTE,"informing us of the Clare tradition as it exists in the family, has"
69,NOTE,"supplied many materials of importance in writing the poet's life,"
70,NOTE,special thanks are due. It was a fortunate chance that put us in
71,NOTE,communication with him.

93,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The life of John Clare, offering as it does so much opportunity for"
94,BIOGRAPHICAL,"sensational contrast and unbridled distortion, became at one time"
95,BIOGRAPHICAL,(like the tragedy of Chatterton) a favourite with the quillmen. Even
96,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his serious biographers have made excessive use of light and darkness,"
97,BIOGRAPHICAL,"poetry and poverty, genius and stupidity: that there should be some"
98,BIOGRAPHICAL,"uncertainty about dates and incidents is no great matter, but that"
99,BIOGRAPHICAL,misrepresentations of character or of habit should be made is the
100,BIOGRAPHICAL,"fault of shallow research or worse. We have been informed, for"
101,BIOGRAPHICAL,"instance, that drink was a main factor in Clare's mental collapse;"
102,BIOGRAPHICAL,"that Clare ""pottered in the fields feebly""; that on his income of"
103,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""£45 a year ... Clare thought he could live without working""; and all"
104,BIOGRAPHICAL,"biographers have tallied in the melodramatic legend; ""Neither wife"
105,BIOGRAPHICAL,"nor children ever came to see him, except the youngest son, who came"
106,BIOGRAPHICAL,"once,"" during his Asylum days. To these attractive exaggerations there"
107,BIOGRAPHICAL,are the best of grounds for giving the lie.
108,BIOGRAPHICAL,
109,BIOGRAPHICAL,"John Clare was born on the 13th of July, 1793, in a small cottage"
110,BIOGRAPHICAL,"degraded in popular tradition to a mud hut of the parish of Helpston,"
111,BIOGRAPHICAL,"between Peterborough and Stamford. This cottage is standing to-day,"
112,BIOGRAPHICAL,almost as it was when Clare lived there; so that those who care to do
113,BIOGRAPHICAL,"so may examine Martin's description of ""a narrow wretched hut, more"
114,BIOGRAPHICAL,"like a prison than a human dwelling,"" in face of the facts. Clare's"
115,BIOGRAPHICAL,"father, a labourer named Parker Clare, was a man with his wits about"
116,BIOGRAPHICAL,"him, whether educated or not; and Ann his wife is recorded to have"
117,BIOGRAPHICAL,"been a woman of much natural ability and precise habits, who thought"
118,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the world of her son John. Of the other children, little is known but"
119,BIOGRAPHICAL,that there were two who died young and one girl who was alive in 1824.
120,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare himself wrote a sonnet in the _London Magazine_ for June, 1821,"
121,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""To a Twin Sister, Who Died in Infancy."""
122,BIOGRAPHICAL,
123,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Parker Clare, a man with some reputation as a wrestler and chosen for"
124,BIOGRAPHICAL,"thrashing corn on account of his strength, sometimes shared the fate"
125,BIOGRAPHICAL,of almost all farm labourers of his day and was compelled to accept
126,BIOGRAPHICAL,parish relief: at no time can he have been many shillings to the good:
127,BIOGRAPHICAL,but it was his determination to have John educated to the best of his
128,BIOGRAPHICAL,power. John Clare therefore attended a dame-school until he was seven;
129,BIOGRAPHICAL,"thence, he is believed to have gone to a day-school, where he"
130,BIOGRAPHICAL,made progress enough to receive on leaving the warm praise of the
131,BIOGRAPHICAL,"schoolmaster, and the advice to continue at a nightschool--which he"
132,BIOGRAPHICAL,"did. His aim, he notes later on, was to write copperplate: but there"
133,BIOGRAPHICAL,are evidences that he learned much more than penmanship. Out of school
134,BIOGRAPHICAL,"he appears to have been a happy, imaginative child: as alert for mild"
135,BIOGRAPHICAL,"mischief as the rest of the village boys, but with something solitary"
136,BIOGRAPHICAL,and romantic in his disposition. One day indeed at a very early age he
137,BIOGRAPHICAL,went off to find the horizon; and a little later while he tended sheep
138,BIOGRAPHICAL,"and cows in his holiday-time on Helpston Common, he made friends with"
139,BIOGRAPHICAL,"a curious old lady called Granny Bains, who taught him old songs and"
140,BIOGRAPHICAL,"ballads. Such poems as ""Childhood"" and ""Remembrances"" prove that"
141,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare's early life was not mere drudgery and despair. ""I never had"
142,BIOGRAPHICAL,much relish for the pastimes of youth. Instead of going out on the
143,BIOGRAPHICAL,green at the town end on winter Sundays to play football I stuck to
144,BIOGRAPHICAL,"my corner stool poring over a book; in fact, I grew so fond of being"
145,BIOGRAPHICAL,"alone at last that my mother was fain to force me into company, for"
146,BIOGRAPHICAL,the neighbours had assured her mind ... that I was no better than
147,BIOGRAPHICAL,"crazy.... I used to be very fond of fishing, and of a Sunday morning"
148,BIOGRAPHICAL,I have been out before the sun delving for worms in some old
149,BIOGRAPHICAL,weed-blanketed dunghill and steering off across the wet grain ... till
150,BIOGRAPHICAL,I came to the flood-washed meadow stream.... And then the year used
151,BIOGRAPHICAL,to be crowned with its holidays as thick as the boughs on a harvest
152,BIOGRAPHICAL,"home."" It is probable that the heavy work which he is said to have"
153,BIOGRAPHICAL,done as a child was during the long holiday at harvesttime. When he
154,BIOGRAPHICAL,"was twelve or thirteen he certainly became team-leader, and in this"
155,BIOGRAPHICAL,employment he saw a farm labourer fall from the top of his loaded
156,BIOGRAPHICAL,wagon and break his neck. For a time his reason seemed affected by the
157,BIOGRAPHICAL,sight.
158,BIOGRAPHICAL,
159,BIOGRAPHICAL,"At evening-school, Clare struck up a friendship with an excise-man's"
160,BIOGRAPHICAL,"son, to the benefit of both. In 1835, one of many sonnets was addressed"
161,BIOGRAPHICAL,to this excellent soul:
162,BIOGRAPHICAL,
163,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Turnill, we toiled together all the day,"
164,BIOGRAPHICAL,And lived like hermits from the boys at play;
165,BIOGRAPHICAL,"We read and walked together round the fields,"
166,BIOGRAPHICAL,Not for the beauty that the journey yields--
167,BIOGRAPHICAL,"But muddied fish, and bragged oer what we caught,"
168,BIOGRAPHICAL,And talked about the few old books we bought.
169,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Though low in price you knew their value well,"
170,BIOGRAPHICAL,And I thought nothing could their worth excel;
171,BIOGRAPHICAL,"And then we talked of what we wished to buy,"
172,BIOGRAPHICAL,And knowledge always kept our pockets dry.
173,BIOGRAPHICAL,"We went the nearest ways, and hummed a song,"
174,BIOGRAPHICAL,"And snatched the pea pods as we went along,"
175,BIOGRAPHICAL,And often stooped for hunger on the way
176,BIOGRAPHICAL,To eat the sour grass in the meadow hay.
177,BIOGRAPHICAL,
178,BIOGRAPHICAL,"One of these ""few old books"" was Thomson's ""Seasons"", which gave"
179,BIOGRAPHICAL,"a direction to the poetic instincts of Clare, already manifesting"
180,BIOGRAPHICAL,themselves in scribbled verses in his exercise-books.
181,BIOGRAPHICAL,
182,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Read, mark, learn as Clare might, no opportunity came for him to enter"
183,BIOGRAPHICAL,"a profession. ""After I had done with going to school it was proposed"
184,BIOGRAPHICAL,"that I should be bound apprentice to a shoemaker, but I rather"
185,BIOGRAPHICAL,disliked this bondage. I whimpered and turned a sullen eye on every
186,BIOGRAPHICAL,"persuasion, till they gave me my will. A neighbour then offered to"
187,BIOGRAPHICAL,"learn me his trade--to be a stone mason,--but I disliked this too...."
188,BIOGRAPHICAL,I was then sent for to drive the plough at Woodcroft Castle of Oliver
189,BIOGRAPHICAL,Cromwell memory; though Mrs. Bellairs the mistress was a kind-hearted
190,BIOGRAPHICAL,"woman, and though the place was a very good one for living, my mind"
191,BIOGRAPHICAL,was set against it from the first;... one of the disagreeable things
192,BIOGRAPHICAL,was getting up so early in the morning ... and another was getting
193,BIOGRAPHICAL,wetshod ... every morning and night--for in wet weather the moat used
194,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to overflow the cause-way that led to the porch, and as there was but"
195,BIOGRAPHICAL,one way to the house we were obliged to wade up to the knees to get
196,BIOGRAPHICAL,"in and out.... I staid here one month, and then on coming home to my"
197,BIOGRAPHICAL,parents they could not persuade me to return. They now gave up all
198,BIOGRAPHICAL,hopes of doing any good with me and fancied that I should make nothing
199,BIOGRAPHICAL,but a soldier; but luckily in this dilemma a next-door neighbour at
200,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the Blue Bell, Francis Gregory, wanted me to drive plough, and as I"
201,BIOGRAPHICAL,"suited him, he made proposals to hire me for a year--which as it had"
202,BIOGRAPHICAL,"my consent my parents readily agreed to."" There he spent a year in"
203,BIOGRAPHICAL,light work with plenty of leisure for his books and his long reveries
204,BIOGRAPHICAL,"in lonely favourite places. His imagination grew intensely, and in his"
205,BIOGRAPHICAL,weekly errand to a flour-mill at Maxey ghosts rose out of a swamp and
206,BIOGRAPHICAL,harried him till he dropped. This stage was hardly ended when one
207,BIOGRAPHICAL,"day on his road he saw a young girl named Mary Joyce, with whom he"
208,BIOGRAPHICAL,instantly fell in love. This crisis occurred when Clare was almost
209,BIOGRAPHICAL,sixteen: the fate of John Clare hung in the balance for six months.
210,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Then Mary's father, disturbed principally by the chance that his"
211,BIOGRAPHICAL,"daughter might be seen talking to this erratic youngster, put an end"
212,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to their meetings. From this time, with intervals of tranquillity,"
213,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare was to suffer the slow torture of remorse, until at length"
214,BIOGRAPHICAL,deliberately yielding himself up to his amazing imagination he held
215,BIOGRAPHICAL,"conversation with Mary, John Clare's Mary, his first wife Mary--as"
216,BIOGRAPHICAL,"though she had not lived unwed, and had not been in her grave for"
217,BIOGRAPHICAL,years.
218,BIOGRAPHICAL,
219,BIOGRAPHICAL,"But this was not yet; and we must return to the boy Clare, now"
220,BIOGRAPHICAL,terminating his year's hiring at the Blue Bell. It was time for him
221,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to take up some trade in good earnest; accordingly, in an evil hour"
222,BIOGRAPHICAL,"disguised as a fortunate one, he was apprenticed to the head gardener"
223,BIOGRAPHICAL,at Burghley Park. The head gardener was in practice a sot and a
224,BIOGRAPHICAL,"slave-driver. After much drunken wild bravado, not remarkable in the"
225,BIOGRAPHICAL,"lad Clare considering his companions and traditions, there came the"
226,BIOGRAPHICAL,impulse to escape; with the result that Clare and a companion were
227,BIOGRAPHICAL,shortly afterwards working in a nursery garden at Newark-upon-Trent.
228,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Both the nursery garden and ""the silver Trent"" are met again in the"
229,BIOGRAPHICAL,poems composed in his asylum days; but for the time being they meant
230,BIOGRAPHICAL,"little to him, and he suddenly departed through the snow. Arrived home"
231,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at Helpston, he lost some time in finding farm work and in writing"
232,BIOGRAPHICAL,"verses: sharing a loft at night with a fellow-labourer, he would rise"
233,BIOGRAPHICAL,at all hours to note down new ideas. It was not unnatural in the
234,BIOGRAPHICAL,"fellow-labourer to request him to ""go and do his poeting elsewhere."""
235,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare was already producing work of value, none the less. Nothing"
236,BIOGRAPHICAL,"could be kept from his neighbours, who looked askance on his ways of"
237,BIOGRAPHICAL,"thinking, and writing: while a candid friend to whom he showed his"
238,BIOGRAPHICAL,manuscripts directed his notice to the study of grammar. Troubled
239,BIOGRAPHICAL,"by these ill omens, he comforted himself in the often intoxicated"
240,BIOGRAPHICAL,"friendship of the bad men of the village, who under the mellowing"
241,BIOGRAPHICAL,influences of old ale roared applause as he recited his ballads. This
242,BIOGRAPHICAL,life was soon interrupted.
243,BIOGRAPHICAL,
244,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""When the country was chin-deep,"" Clare tells us, ""in the fears of"
245,BIOGRAPHICAL,"invasion, and every mouth was filled with the terror which Buonaparte"
246,BIOGRAPHICAL,"had spread in other countries, a national scheme was set on foot to"
247,BIOGRAPHICAL,raise a raw army of volunteers: and to make the matter plausible a
248,BIOGRAPHICAL,letter was circulated said to be written by the Prince Regent. I
249,BIOGRAPHICAL,"forget how many were demanded from our parish, but remember the panic"
250,BIOGRAPHICAL,which it created was very great. No great name rises in the world
251,BIOGRAPHICAL,without creating a crowd of little mimics that glitter in borrowed
252,BIOGRAPHICAL,rays; and no great lie was ever yet put in circulation without a herd
253,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of little lies multiplying by instinct, as it were and crowding under"
254,BIOGRAPHICAL,its wings. The papers that were circulated assured the people of
255,BIOGRAPHICAL,England that the French were on the eve of invading it and that it
256,BIOGRAPHICAL,was deemed necessary by the Regent that an army from eighteen to
257,BIOGRAPHICAL,"forty-five should be raised immediately. This was the great lie, and"
258,BIOGRAPHICAL,then the little lies were soon at its heels; which assured the people
259,BIOGRAPHICAL,of Helpston that the French had invaded and got to London. And some of
260,BIOGRAPHICAL,these little lies had the impudence to swear that the French had even
261,BIOGRAPHICAL,reached Northampton. The people were at their doors in the evening to
262,BIOGRAPHICAL,"talk over the rebellion of '45 when the rebels reached Derby, and"
263,BIOGRAPHICAL,even listened at intervals to fancy they heard the French rebels at
264,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Northampton, knocking it down with their cannon. I never gave much"
265,BIOGRAPHICAL,"credit to popular stories of any sort, so I felt no concern at these"
266,BIOGRAPHICAL,stories; though I could not say much for my valour if the tale had
267,BIOGRAPHICAL,"proved true. We had a crossgrained sort of choice left us, which was"
268,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to be found, to be drawn, and go for nothing--or take on as volunteers"
269,BIOGRAPHICAL,for the bounty of two guineas. I accepted the latter and went with
270,BIOGRAPHICAL,"a neighbour's son, W. Clarke, to Peterborough to be sworn on and"
271,BIOGRAPHICAL,prepared to join the regiment at Oundle. The morning we left home our
272,BIOGRAPHICAL,"mothers parted with us as if we were going to Botany Bay, and people"
273,BIOGRAPHICAL,got at their doors to bid us farewell and greet us with a Job's
274,BIOGRAPHICAL,comfort 'that they doubted we should see Helpston no more.' I confess
275,BIOGRAPHICAL,"I wished myself out of the matter. When we got to Oundle, the place"
276,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of quartering, we were drawn out into the field, and a more motley"
277,BIOGRAPHICAL,multitude of lawless fellows was never seen in Oundle before--and
278,BIOGRAPHICAL,"hardly out of it. There were 1,300 of us. We were drawn up into a line"
279,BIOGRAPHICAL,and sorted out into companies. I was one of the shortest and therefore
280,BIOGRAPHICAL,my station is evident. I was in that mixed multitude called the
281,BIOGRAPHICAL,"battalion, which they nicknamed 'bum-tools' for what reason I cannot"
282,BIOGRAPHICAL,"tell; the light company was called 'light-bobs,' and the grenadiers"
283,BIOGRAPHICAL,'bacon-bolters' ... who felt as great an enmity against each other as
284,BIOGRAPHICAL,"ever they all felt against the French."""
285,BIOGRAPHICAL,
286,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In 1813 he read among other things the ""Eikon Basilike,"" and turned"
287,BIOGRAPHICAL,his hand to odd jobs as they presented themselves. His life appears to
288,BIOGRAPHICAL,"have been comfortable and a little dull for a year or two; flirtation,"
289,BIOGRAPHICAL,"verse-making, ambitions and his violin took their turns amiably"
290,BIOGRAPHICAL,enough! At length he went to work in a lime-kiln several miles from
291,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Helpston, and wrote only less poems than he read: one day in the"
292,BIOGRAPHICAL,"autumn of 1817, he was dreaming yet new verses when he first saw"
293,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""Patty,"" his wife-to-be. She was then eighteen years old, and modestly"
294,BIOGRAPHICAL,"beautiful; for a moment Clare forgot Mary Joyce, and though ""the"
295,BIOGRAPHICAL,"courtship ultimately took a more prosaic turn,"" there is no denying"
296,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the fact that he was in love with ""Patty"" Turner, the daughter of the"
297,BIOGRAPHICAL,"small farmer who held Walkherd Lodge. In the case of Clare, poetry was"
298,BIOGRAPHICAL,more than ever as time went on autobiography; and it is noteworthy
299,BIOGRAPHICAL,that among the many love lyrics addressed to Mary Joyce there are not
300,BIOGRAPHICAL,wanting affectionate tributes to his faithful wife Patty.
301,BIOGRAPHICAL,
302,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Maid of Walkherd, meet again,"
303,BIOGRAPHICAL,By the wilding in the glen....
304,BIOGRAPHICAL,
305,BIOGRAPHICAL,And I would go to Patty's cot
306,BIOGRAPHICAL,And Patty came to me;
307,BIOGRAPHICAL,Each knew the other's very thought
308,BIOGRAPHICAL,Under the hawthorn tree....
309,BIOGRAPHICAL,And I'll be true for Patty's sake
310,BIOGRAPHICAL,And she'll be true for mine;
311,BIOGRAPHICAL,"And I this little ballad make,"
312,BIOGRAPHICAL,To be her valentine.
313,BIOGRAPHICAL,
314,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Not long after seeing Patty, Clare was informed by the owner of the"
315,BIOGRAPHICAL,"lime-kiln that his wages would now be seven shillings a week, instead"
316,BIOGRAPHICAL,of nine. He therefore left this master and found similar work in the
317,BIOGRAPHICAL,"village of Pickworth, where being presented with a shoemaker's bill"
318,BIOGRAPHICAL,"for £3, he entered into negotiations with a Market Deeping bookseller"
319,BIOGRAPHICAL,"regarding ""Proposals for publishing by subscription a Collection of"
320,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Original Trifles on Miscellaneous Subjects, Religious and Moral, in"
321,BIOGRAPHICAL,"verse, by John Clare, of Helpstone."" Three hundred proposals were"
322,BIOGRAPHICAL,"printed, with a specimen sonnet well chosen to intrigue the religious"
323,BIOGRAPHICAL,and moral; and yet the tale of intending subscribers stood adamantly
324,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at seven. On the face of it, then, Clare had lost one pound; had worn"
325,BIOGRAPHICAL,himself out with distributing his prospectuses; and further had been
326,BIOGRAPHICAL,discharged from the lime-kiln for doing so in working hours. His
327,BIOGRAPHICAL,"ambitions, indeed, set all employers and acquaintances against him;"
328,BIOGRAPHICAL,and he found himself at the age of twenty-five compelled to ask for
329,BIOGRAPHICAL,"parish relief. In this extremity, even the idea of enlisting once"
330,BIOGRAPHICAL,"more crossed his brain; then, that of travelling to Yorkshire for"
331,BIOGRAPHICAL,"employment: and at last, the prospectus which had done him so much"
332,BIOGRAPHICAL,damage turned benefactor. With a few friends Clare was drinking
333,BIOGRAPHICAL,"success to his goose-chase when there appeared two ""real gentlemen"""
334,BIOGRAPHICAL,"from Stamford. One of these, a bookseller named Drury, had chanced"
335,BIOGRAPHICAL,"on the prospectus, and wished to see more of Clare's poetry. Soon"
336,BIOGRAPHICAL,"afterwards, he promised to publish a selection, with corrections; and"
337,BIOGRAPHICAL,"communicated with his relative, John Taylor, who with his partner"
338,BIOGRAPHICAL,Hessey managed the well-known publishing business in Fleet Street.
339,BIOGRAPHICAL,"While this new prospect was opening upon Clare, he succeeded in"
340,BIOGRAPHICAL,"obtaining work once more, near the home of Patty; their love-making"
341,BIOGRAPHICAL,"proceeded, despite the usual thunderstorms, and the dangerous rivalry"
342,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of a certain dark lady named Betty Sell. The bookseller Drury, though"
343,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his appearance was in such critical days timely for Clare, was not a"
344,BIOGRAPHICAL,"paragon of virtue. Without Clare's knowing it, he acquired the legal"
345,BIOGRAPHICAL,"copyright of the poems, probably by the expedient of dispensing money"
346,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at convenient times--a specious philanthropy, as will be shown. At the"
347,BIOGRAPHICAL,"same time he allowed Clare to open a book account, which proved"
348,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at length to be no special advantage. And further, with striking"
349,BIOGRAPHICAL,"astuteness, he found constant difficulty in returning originals. In a"
350,BIOGRAPHICAL,"note written some ten years later, Clare regrets that ""Ned Drury has"
351,BIOGRAPHICAL,"got my early vol. of MSS. I lent it him at first, but like all my"
352,BIOGRAPHICAL,other MSS. elsewhere I could never get it again.... He has copies
353,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of all my MSS. except those written for the 'Shepherd's Calendar.'"""
354,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Nevertheless, through Drury, Clare was enabled to meet his publisher"
355,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Taylor and his influential friend of the _Quarterly_, Octavius"
356,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Gilchrist, before the end of 1819."
357,BIOGRAPHICAL,
358,BIOGRAPHICAL,"By 1818, there is no doubt, Clare had read very deeply, and even had"
359,BIOGRAPHICAL,some idea of the classical authors through translations. It is certain
360,BIOGRAPHICAL,"that he knew the great English writers, probable that he possessed"
361,BIOGRAPHICAL,their works. What appears to be a list of books which he was anxious
362,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to sell in his hardest times includes some curious titles, with some"
363,BIOGRAPHICAL,"familiar ones. There are Cobb's Poems, Fawke's Poems, Broom's, Mrs."
364,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Hoole's, and so on; there are also Cowley's Works--Folio, Warton's"
365,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""Milton,"" Waller, and a Life of Chatterton; nor can he have been"
366,BIOGRAPHICAL,devoid of miscellaneous learning after the perusal of Watson's
367,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""Electricity,"" Aristotle's Works, Gasse's ""Voyages,"" ""Nature"
368,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Display'd,"" and the _European Magazine_ (""fine heads and plates""). His"
369,BIOGRAPHICAL,"handwriting at this time was bold and hasty; his opinions, to judge"
370,BIOGRAPHICAL,from his uncompromising notes to Drury respecting the text of the
371,BIOGRAPHICAL,"poems, almost cynical and decidedly his own. Tact was essential if you"
372,BIOGRAPHICAL,"would patronize Clare: you might broaden his opinions, but you dared"
373,BIOGRAPHICAL,"not assail them. Thus the friendly Gilchrist, a high churchman, hardly"
374,BIOGRAPHICAL,set eyes on Clare before condemning Clare's esteem for a dissenting
375,BIOGRAPHICAL,"minister, a Mr. Holland, who understood the poet and the poetry: it"
376,BIOGRAPHICAL,was some time before Gilchrist set eyes on Clare again.
377,BIOGRAPHICAL,
378,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The year 1820 found Clare unemployed once more, but the said Mr."
379,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Holland arrived before long with great news. ""In the beginning of"
380,BIOGRAPHICAL,"January,"" Clare briefly puts it, ""my poems were published after a long"
381,BIOGRAPHICAL,"anxiety of nearly two years and all the Reviews, except Phillips'"
382,BIOGRAPHICAL,"waste paper magazine, spoke in my favour."" Most assuredly they did."
383,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The literary world, gaping for drouth, had seen an announcement, then"
384,BIOGRAPHICAL,"an account of ""John Clare, an agricultural labourer and poet,"" during"
385,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the previous autumn; the little cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, in"
386,BIOGRAPHICAL,"a little while seemed to usurp the whole sky--or in other terms, three"
387,BIOGRAPHICAL,"editions of ""Poems Descriptiveof Rural Life and Scenery"" were sold"
388,BIOGRAPHICAL,between January 16 and the last of March. While this fever was raging
389,BIOGRAPHICAL,"among the London coteries, critical, fashionable, intellectual, even"
390,BIOGRAPHICAL,the country folk round Helpston came to the conclusion that Clare was
391,BIOGRAPHICAL,"something of a phenomenon. ""In the course of the publication,"" says"
392,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare, ""I had ventured to write to Lord Milton to request leave that"
393,BIOGRAPHICAL,the volume might be dedicated to him; but his Lordship was starting
394,BIOGRAPHICAL,"into Italy and forgot to answer it. So it was dedicated to nobody,"
395,BIOGRAPHICAL,"which perhaps might be as well. As soon as it was out, my mother took"
396,BIOGRAPHICAL,one to Milton; when his Lordship sent a note to tell me to bring ten
397,BIOGRAPHICAL,"more copies. On the following Sunday I went, and after sitting"
398,BIOGRAPHICAL,awhile in the servants' hall (where I could eat or drink nothing
399,BIOGRAPHICAL,"for thought), his Lordship sent for me, and instantly explained the"
400,BIOGRAPHICAL,"reasons why he did not answer my letter, in a quiet unaffected manner"
401,BIOGRAPHICAL,which set me at rest. He told me he had heard of my poems by Parson
402,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Mossop (of Helpston), who I have since heard took hold of every"
403,BIOGRAPHICAL,opportunity to speak against my success or poetical abilities before
404,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the book was published, and then, when it came out and others praised"
405,BIOGRAPHICAL,"it, instantly turned round to my side. Lady Milton also asked"
406,BIOGRAPHICAL,"me several questions, and wished me to name any book that was a"
407,BIOGRAPHICAL,favourite; expressing at the same time a desire to give me one. But I
408,BIOGRAPHICAL,was confounded and could think of nothing. So I lost the present.
409,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In fact, I did not like to pick out a book for fear of seeming"
410,BIOGRAPHICAL,"over-reaching on her kindness, or else Shakespeare was at my tongue's"
411,BIOGRAPHICAL,"end. Lord Fitzwilliam, and Lady Fitzwilliam too, talked to me and"
412,BIOGRAPHICAL,"noticed me kindly, and his Lordship gave me some advice which I had"
413,BIOGRAPHICAL,done well perhaps to have noticed better than I have. He bade me
414,BIOGRAPHICAL,beware of booksellers and warned me not to be fed with promises. On my
415,BIOGRAPHICAL,departure they gave me a handful of money--the most that I had ever
416,BIOGRAPHICAL,possessed in my life together. I almost felt I should be poor no
417,BIOGRAPHICAL,"more--there was £17."" Such is Clare's description of an incident which"
418,BIOGRAPHICAL,"has been rendered in terms of insult. Other invitations followed, the"
419,BIOGRAPHICAL,chief practical result being an annuity of fifteen pounds promised by
420,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the Marquis of Exeter. Men of rank and talent wrote letters to Clare,"
421,BIOGRAPHICAL,"or sent him books: some found their way to Helpston, and others sent"
422,BIOGRAPHICAL,tracts to show him the way to heaven. And now at last Clare was well
423,BIOGRAPHICAL,"enough off to marry Patty, before the birth of their first child, Anna"
424,BIOGRAPHICAL,Maria.
425,BIOGRAPHICAL,
426,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Before his marriage, probably, Clare was desired to spend a few days"
427,BIOGRAPHICAL,with his publisher Taylor in London. In smock and gaiters he felt most
428,BIOGRAPHICAL,uncertain of himself and borrowed a large overcoat from Taylor to
429,BIOGRAPHICAL,"disguise his dress: over and above this question of externals, he"
430,BIOGRAPHICAL,"instinctively revolted against being exhibited. Meeting Lord Radstock,"
431,BIOGRAPHICAL,"sometime admiral in the Royal Navy, at dinner in Taylor's house, Clare"
432,BIOGRAPHICAL,"gained a generous if somewhat religiose friend, with the instant"
433,BIOGRAPHICAL,"result that he found himself ""trotting from one drawing-room to the"
434,BIOGRAPHICAL,"other."" He endured this with patience, thinking possibly of the cat"
435,BIOGRAPHICAL,killed by kindness; and incidentally Radstock introduced him to the
436,BIOGRAPHICAL,"strangely superficial-genuine lady Mrs. Emmerson, who was to be a"
437,BIOGRAPHICAL,"faithful, thoughtful friend to his family for many years to come. In"
438,BIOGRAPHICAL,"another direction, soon after Clare's return to Helpston, the retired"
439,BIOGRAPHICAL,"admiral did him a great service, opening a private subscription list"
440,BIOGRAPHICAL,"for his benefit: it was found possible to purchase ""£250 Navy 5 Per"
441,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Cents"" on the 28th April and a further ""£125 Navy 5 Per Cents"" a month"
442,BIOGRAPHICAL,"or so later. This stock, held by trustees, yielded Clare a dividend of"
443,BIOGRAPHICAL,"£18 15s. at first, but in 1823 this income dwindled to £15 15s.; and"
444,BIOGRAPHICAL,by 1832 appears to have fallen to £13 10s. To the varying amount thus
445,BIOGRAPHICAL,"derived, and to the £15 given yearly by the Marquis of Exeter,"
446,BIOGRAPHICAL,a Stamford doctor named Bell--one of Clare's most energetic
447,BIOGRAPHICAL,admirers--succeeded in adding another annuity of £10 settled upon the
448,BIOGRAPHICAL,"poet by Lord Spencer. But in the consideration of these bounties, it"
449,BIOGRAPHICAL,is just to examine the actual financial effect of Clare's first book.
450,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The publishers' own account, furnished only through Clare's repeated"
451,BIOGRAPHICAL,"demands in 1829 or thereabouts, has a sobering tale to tell: but so"
452,BIOGRAPHICAL,far no biographer has condescended to examine it.
453,BIOGRAPHICAL,
454,BIOGRAPHICAL,On the first edition Clare got nothing. Against him is entered the
455,BIOGRAPHICAL,"item ""Cash paid Mr. Clare for copyright p. Mr. Drury ... £20""; but"
456,BIOGRAPHICAL,this money if actually paid had been paid in 1819. Against him also is
457,BIOGRAPHICAL,"charged a curious ""Commission 5 p. Cent... £8 12s.,"" while Drury and"
458,BIOGRAPHICAL,Taylor acknowledge sharing profits of £26 odd.
459,BIOGRAPHICAL,
460,BIOGRAPHICAL,On the second and third editions Clare got nothing; but to his account
461,BIOGRAPHICAL,"is charged the £100 which Taylor and Hessey ""subscribed"" to his fund."
462,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""Commission,"" ""Advertising,"" ""Sundries,"" and ""Deductions allowed to"
463,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Agents,"" account for a further £51 of the receipts: and Drury and"
464,BIOGRAPHICAL,Taylor ostensibly take over £30 apiece.
465,BIOGRAPHICAL,
466,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The fourth edition not being exhausted, the account is not closed: but"
467,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""Advertising"" has already swollen to £30, and there is no sign that"
468,BIOGRAPHICAL,Clare benefits a penny piece. Small wonder that at the foot of these
469,BIOGRAPHICAL,"figures he has written, ""How can this be? I never sold the poems"
470,BIOGRAPHICAL,for any price--what money I had of Drury was given me on account of
471,BIOGRAPHICAL,profits to be received--but here it seems I have got nothing and
472,BIOGRAPHICAL,am brought in minus twenty pounds of which I never received a
473,BIOGRAPHICAL,sixpence--or it seems that by the sale of these four thousand copies
474,BIOGRAPHICAL,"I have lost that much--and Drury told me that 5,000 copies had been"
475,BIOGRAPHICAL,"printed tho' 4,000 only are accounted for."" Had Clare noticed further"
476,BIOGRAPHICAL,an arithmetical discrepancy which apparently shortened his credit
477,BIOGRAPHICAL,"balance by some £27, he might have been still more sceptical."
478,BIOGRAPHICAL,
479,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Not being overweighted, therefore, with instant wealth, Clare returned"
480,BIOGRAPHICAL,to Helpston determined to continue his work in the fields. But fame
481,BIOGRAPHICAL,"opposed him: all sorts and conditions of Lydia Whites, Leo Hunters,"
482,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Stigginses, and Jingles crowded to the cottage, demanding to see the"
483,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Northamptonshire Peasant, and often wasting hours of his time. One"
484,BIOGRAPHICAL,"day, for example, ""the inmates of a whole boarding-school, located at"
485,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Stamford, visited the unhappy poet""; and even more congenial visitors"
486,BIOGRAPHICAL,who cheerfully hurried him off to the tavern parlour were the ruin of
487,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his work. Yet he persevered, writing his poems only in his leisure,"
488,BIOGRAPHICAL,until the harvest of 1820 was done; then in order to keep his word
489,BIOGRAPHICAL,"with Taylor, who had agreed to produce a new volume in the spring"
490,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of 1821, he spent six months in the most energetic literary labour."
491,BIOGRAPHICAL,Writing several poems a day as he roamed the field or sat in Lea
492,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Close Oak, he would sit till late in the night sifting, recasting and"
493,BIOGRAPHICAL,"transcribing. His library, by his own enterprise and by presents from"
494,BIOGRAPHICAL,"many friends, was greatly enlarged, and he already knew not only the"
495,BIOGRAPHICAL,"literature of the past, but also that of the present. In his letters"
496,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to Taylor are mentioned his appreciations of Keats, ""Poor Keats, you"
497,BIOGRAPHICAL,"know how I reverence him,"" Shelley, Hunt, Lamb--and almost every"
498,BIOGRAPHICAL,other contemporary classic. Nor was he afraid to criticize Scott with
499,BIOGRAPHICAL,freedom in a letter to Scott's friend Sherwell: remarking also that
500,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Wordworth's Sonnet on Westminster Bridge had no equal in the language,"
501,BIOGRAPHICAL,"but disagreeing with ""his affected godliness."""
502,BIOGRAPHICAL,
503,BIOGRAPHICAL,Taylor and Hessey for their part did not seem over-anxious to produce
504,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the new volume of poems, perhaps because Clare would not allow any"
505,BIOGRAPHICAL,"change except in the jots and tittles of his work, perhaps thinking"
506,BIOGRAPHICAL,that the public had had a surfeit of sensation. At length in the
507,BIOGRAPHICAL,"autumn of 1821 the ""Village Minstrel"" made its appearance, in"
508,BIOGRAPHICAL,two volumes costing twelve shillings; with the bait of steel
509,BIOGRAPHICAL,"engravings,--the first, an unusually fine likeness of Clare from"
510,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the painting by Hilton; the second, an imaginative study of Clare's"
511,BIOGRAPHICAL,"cottage, not without representation of the Blue Bell, the village"
512,BIOGRAPHICAL,"cross and the church. The book was reviewed less noisily, and a sale"
513,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of a mere 800 copies in two months was regarded as ""a very modified"
514,BIOGRAPHICAL,"success."" Meanwhile, Clare was writing for the _London Magazine_, and"
515,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Cherry tells us that ""as he contributed almost regularly for some"
516,BIOGRAPHICAL,"time, a substantial addition was made to his income."" Clare tells us,"
517,BIOGRAPHICAL,"in a note on a cash account dated 1827, ""In this cash account there"
518,BIOGRAPHICAL,is nothing allowed me for my three years' writing for the _London
519,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Magazine_. I was to have £12 a year."""
520,BIOGRAPHICAL,
521,BIOGRAPHICAL,"To insist in the financial affairs of Clare may seem blatant, or"
522,BIOGRAPHICAL,"otiose: actually, the treatment which he underwent was a leading"
523,BIOGRAPHICAL,influence in his career. He was grateful enough to Radstock for
524,BIOGRAPHICAL,raising a subscription fund; he may have been grateful to Taylor
525,BIOGRAPHICAL,and Hessey for subscribing £100 of his own money; but what hurt and
526,BIOGRAPHICAL,embittered him was to see this sum and the others invested for him
527,BIOGRAPHICAL,"under trustees. Indeed, what man would not, if possessed of any"
528,BIOGRAPHICAL,"independence of mind, strongly oppose such namby-pamby methods? It is"
529,BIOGRAPHICAL,possible to take a more sinister view of Taylor and Hessey and their
530,BIOGRAPHICAL,reluctance ever to provide Clare with a statement of account; but in
531,BIOGRAPHICAL,the matter of Clare's funded property folly alone need be considered.
532,BIOGRAPHICAL,
533,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In October 1821, notably, Clare saw an excellent opportunity for the"
534,BIOGRAPHICAL,future of his family. A small freehold of six or seven acres with a
535,BIOGRAPHICAL,"pleasant cottage named Bachelor's Hall, where Clare had spent many an"
536,BIOGRAPHICAL,"evening in comfort and even in revelry, was mortgaged to a Jew for"
537,BIOGRAPHICAL,two hundred pounds; the tenants offered Clare the whole property on
538,BIOGRAPHICAL,condition that he paid off the mortgage. Small holdings were rare in
539,BIOGRAPHICAL,"that district of great landowners, and this to Clare was the chance"
540,BIOGRAPHICAL,of a lifetime. He applied therefore to Lord Radstock for two hundred
541,BIOGRAPHICAL,"pounds from his funded property; Radstock replied that ""the funded"
542,BIOGRAPHICAL,property was vested in trustees who were restricted to paying the
543,BIOGRAPHICAL,"interest to him."" It would have been, thought Clare, no difficult"
544,BIOGRAPHICAL,matter for Radstock to have advanced me that small amount; and he
545,BIOGRAPHICAL,rightly concluded that his own strength of character and common sense
546,BIOGRAPHICAL,"were distrusted by his patrons. Not overwhelmed by this, he now"
547,BIOGRAPHICAL,"applied to his publisher Taylor, offering to sell his whole literary"
548,BIOGRAPHICAL,output for five years at the price of two hundred pounds. Taylor was
549,BIOGRAPHICAL,"not enthusiastic. These writings, he urged, might be worth more, or"
550,BIOGRAPHICAL,"might be worth less; in the first case Clare, in the second himself"
551,BIOGRAPHICAL,"would lose on the affair; besides, there were money-lenders and legal"
552,BIOGRAPHICAL,"niceties to beware of; let not Clare ""be ambitious but remain in the"
553,BIOGRAPHICAL,"state in which God had placed him."" Thus the miserable officiousness"
554,BIOGRAPHICAL,"went on, and if Clare for a time found some comfort in the glass who"
555,BIOGRAPHICAL,"can blame him? In his own words, ""for enemies he cared nothing, from"
556,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his friends he had much to fear."" He was ""thrown back among all the"
557,BIOGRAPHICAL,"cold apathy of killing kindness that had numbed him ... for years."""
558,BIOGRAPHICAL,
559,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In May, 1822, Clare spent a brief holiday in London, meeting there the"
560,BIOGRAPHICAL,"strong men of the _London Magazine_, Lamb, Hood, and therest. From"
561,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his clothes, the _London_ group called him The Green Man; Lamb took a"
562,BIOGRAPHICAL,"singular interest in him, and was wont to address him as ""Clarissimus"""
563,BIOGRAPHICAL,"and ""Princely Clare."" Another most enthusiastic acquaintance was a"
564,BIOGRAPHICAL,"painter named Rippingille, who had begun life as the son of a farmer"
565,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at King's Lynn, and who was now thoroughly capable of taking Clare"
566,BIOGRAPHICAL,"into the most Bohemian corners of London. Suddenly, however, news came"
567,BIOGRAPHICAL,"from Helpston recalling the poet from these perambulations, and he"
568,BIOGRAPHICAL,"returned in haste, to find his second daughter born, Eliza Louisa,"
569,BIOGRAPHICAL,god-child of Mrs. Emmerson and Lord Radstock.
570,BIOGRAPHICAL,
571,BIOGRAPHICAL,"At this time, Clare appears to have been writing ballads of a truly"
572,BIOGRAPHICAL,"rustic sort, perhaps in the light of his universal title, The"
573,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Northamptonshire Peasant Poet. He would now, moreover, collect such"
574,BIOGRAPHICAL,old ballads and songs as his father and mother or those who worked
575,BIOGRAPHICAL,with him might chance to sing; but was often disappointed to find that
576,BIOGRAPHICAL,"""those who knew fragments seemed ashamed to acknowledge it ... and"
577,BIOGRAPHICAL,those who were proud of their knowledge in such things knew nothing
578,BIOGRAPHICAL,but the senseless balderdash that is brawled over and sung at country
579,BIOGRAPHICAL,"feasts, statutes, and fairs, where the most senseless jargon passes"
580,BIOGRAPHICAL,"for the greatest excellence, and rudest indecency for the finest wit."""
581,BIOGRAPHICAL,None the less he recovered sufficient material to train himself into
582,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the manner of these ""old and beautiful recollections."" But whatever"
583,BIOGRAPHICAL,"he might write or edit, he was unlikely to find publishers willing"
584,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to bring out. The ""Village Minstrel"" had barely passed the first"
585,BIOGRAPHICAL,"thousand, and the ""second edition"" was not melting away. Literature"
586,BIOGRAPHICAL,"after all was not money, and to increase Clare's anxiety and dilemma"
587,BIOGRAPHICAL,"came illness. In the early months of 1823, he made a journey to"
588,BIOGRAPHICAL,Stamford to ask the help of his old friend Gilchrist.
589,BIOGRAPHICAL,
590,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Gilchrist was already in the throes of his last sickness, and Clare"
591,BIOGRAPHICAL,"took his leave without a word of his own difficulties. Arriving home,"
592,BIOGRAPHICAL,he fell into a worse illness than before; but as the spring came on he
593,BIOGRAPHICAL,"rallied, and occasionally walked to Stamford to call on his friend,"
594,BIOGRAPHICAL,"who likewise seemed beginning to mend. On the 30th of June, Clare was"
595,BIOGRAPHICAL,"received with the news ""Mr. Gilchrist is dead."" Clare relapsed into a"
596,BIOGRAPHICAL,curious condition which appeared likely to overthrow his life or his
597,BIOGRAPHICAL,"reason when Taylor most fortunately came to see him, and procured him"
598,BIOGRAPHICAL,the best doctor in Peterborough. This doctor not only baffled
599,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare's disease, but, rousing attention wherever he could in the"
600,BIOGRAPHICAL,"neighbourhood, was able to provide him with good food and even some"
601,BIOGRAPHICAL,old port from the cellar of the Bishop of Peterborough.
602,BIOGRAPHICAL,
603,BIOGRAPHICAL,At last on the advice of the good doctor and the renewed invitation of
604,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Taylor, Clare made a third pilgrimage to London, and this time stayed"
605,BIOGRAPHICAL,"from the beginning of May till the middle of July, 1824. Passing the"
606,BIOGRAPHICAL,"first three weeks in peaceful contemplation of London crowds, he"
607,BIOGRAPHICAL,"was well enough then to attend a _London Magazine_ dinner, where De"
608,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Quincey swam into his ken, and the next week a similar gathering where"
609,BIOGRAPHICAL,Coleridge talked for three hours. Clare sat next to Charles Elton and
610,BIOGRAPHICAL,"gained a staunch friend, who shortly afterwards sent him a letter"
611,BIOGRAPHICAL,in verse with a request that he should sit to Rippingille for his
612,BIOGRAPHICAL,portrait:
613,BIOGRAPHICAL,
614,BIOGRAPHICAL,"His touch will, hue by hue, combine"
615,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Thy thoughtful eyes, that steady shine,"
616,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The temples of Shakesperian line,"
617,BIOGRAPHICAL,The quiet smile.
618,BIOGRAPHICAL,
619,BIOGRAPHICAL,"To J. H. Reynolds he seemed ""a very quiet and worthy yet enthusiastic"
620,BIOGRAPHICAL,"man."" George Darley, too, was impressed by Clare the man, and for some"
621,BIOGRAPHICAL,time was to be one of the few serious critics of Clare the poet. Allan
622,BIOGRAPHICAL,Cunningham showed a like sympathy and a still more active interest.
623,BIOGRAPHICAL,"A less familiar character, the journalist Henry Van Dyk, perhaps did"
624,BIOGRAPHICAL,Clare more practical good than either.
625,BIOGRAPHICAL,
626,BIOGRAPHICAL,"With these good effects of Clare's third visit to town, another may be"
627,BIOGRAPHICAL,"noted. A certain Dr. Darling attended him throughout, and persuaded"
628,BIOGRAPHICAL,him to give up drink; this he did. The real trouble at Helpston was to
629,BIOGRAPHICAL,"discover employment, for already Clare was supporting his wife, his"
630,BIOGRAPHICAL,"father and mother, and three young children. Farmers were unwilling"
631,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to employ Clare, indeed insulted him if he applied to them: and his"
632,BIOGRAPHICAL,reticence perhaps lost him situations in the gardens of the Marquis of
633,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Exeter, and then of the Earl Fitzwilliam."
634,BIOGRAPHICAL,
635,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In spite of disappointments, he wrote almost without pause, sometimes"
636,BIOGRAPHICAL,making poems in the manner of elder poets (with the intention of mild
637,BIOGRAPHICAL,"literary forgery), sometimes writing in his normal vein for the lately"
638,BIOGRAPHICAL,"announced ""New Shepherd's Calendar""; and almost daily preparing two"
639,BIOGRAPHICAL,"series of articles, on natural history and on British birds. A curious"
640,BIOGRAPHICAL,proof of the facility with which he wrote verse is afforded by the
641,BIOGRAPHICAL,"great number of rhymed descriptions of birds, their nests and eggs"
642,BIOGRAPHICAL,which this period produced: as though he sat down resolved to write
643,BIOGRAPHICAL,prose notes and found his facts running into metre even against his
644,BIOGRAPHICAL,"will. As if not yet embroiled in schemes enough, Clare planned and"
645,BIOGRAPHICAL,"began a burlesque novel, an autobiography, and other prose papers:"
646,BIOGRAPHICAL,while he kept a diary which should have been published. Clare had
647,BIOGRAPHICAL,"been forced into a literary career, and no one ever worked more"
648,BIOGRAPHICAL,conscientiously or more bravely. Those who had at first urged him to
649,BIOGRAPHICAL,write can scarcely be acquitted of desertion now: but the more and the
650,BIOGRAPHICAL,"better Clare wrote, the less grew the actual prospect of production,"
651,BIOGRAPHICAL,success and independence.
652,BIOGRAPHICAL,
653,BIOGRAPHICAL,"On the 9th of March, 1825, Clare wrote in his diary: ""I had a very odd"
654,BIOGRAPHICAL,"dream last night, and take it as an ill omen ... I thought I had one"
655,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of the proofs of the new poems from London, and after looking at it"
656,BIOGRAPHICAL,"awhile it shrank through my hands like sand, and crumbled into dust."""
657,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Three days afterwards, the proof of the ""Shepherd's Calendar"" arrived"
658,BIOGRAPHICAL,"at Helpston. The ill omen was to be proved true, but not yet. Clare"
659,BIOGRAPHICAL,"continued to write and to botanize, and being already half-forgotten"
660,BIOGRAPHICAL,by his earlier friends was contented with the company of two notable
661,BIOGRAPHICAL,"local men, Edward Artis the archaeologist who discovered ancient"
662,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Durobrivae, and Henderson who assisted Clare in his nature-work. These"
663,BIOGRAPHICAL,two pleasant companions were in the service of Earl Fitzwilliam. It
664,BIOGRAPHICAL,was perhaps through their interest that Clare weathered the hardships
665,BIOGRAPHICAL,"of 1825 so well; and equally, although the ""Shepherd's Calendar"""
666,BIOGRAPHICAL,"seemed suspended, did Clare's old patron Radstock endeavour to keep"
667,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his spirits up, writing repeatedly to the publisher in regard to"
668,BIOGRAPHICAL,Clare's account. The hope of a business agreement was destroyed by the
669,BIOGRAPHICAL,"sudden death of Radstock, ""the best friend,"" says Clare, ""I have met"
670,BIOGRAPHICAL,"with."""
671,BIOGRAPHICAL,
672,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Not long after this misfortune, Clare returned to field work for the"
673,BIOGRAPHICAL,"period of harvest, then through the winter concentrated his energy on"
674,BIOGRAPHICAL,"his poetry. Nor was poetry his only production, for through his friend"
675,BIOGRAPHICAL,Van Dyk he was enabled to contribute prose pieces to the London press.
676,BIOGRAPHICAL,"In June, 1826, his fourth child was born, and Clare entreated Taylor"
677,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to bring out the ""Shepherd's Calendar,"" feeling that he might at least"
678,BIOGRAPHICAL,receive money enough for the comfort of his wife and his baby; but
679,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Taylor felt otherwise, recommending Clare to write for the annuals"
680,BIOGRAPHICAL,which now began to flourish. This Clare at last persuaded himself to
681,BIOGRAPHICAL,"do. Payment was tardy, and in some cases imaginary; and for the time"
682,BIOGRAPHICAL,being the annuals were not the solution of his perplexities. He
683,BIOGRAPHICAL,therefore went back to the land; and borrowing the small means
684,BIOGRAPHICAL,"required rented at length a few acres, with but poor results."
685,BIOGRAPHICAL,
686,BIOGRAPHICAL,The publication of Clare's first book had been managed with excellent
687,BIOGRAPHICAL,"strategy; Taylor had left nothing to chance, and the public responded"
688,BIOGRAPHICAL,as he had planned. The independence of Clare may have displeased
689,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the publisher; at any rate, his enthusiasm dwindled, and further to"
690,BIOGRAPHICAL,jeopardize Clare's chances it occurred that in 1825 Taylor and Hessey
691,BIOGRAPHICAL,"came to an end, the partners separating. Omens were indeed bad for"
692,BIOGRAPHICAL,"the ""Shepherd's Calendar"" which, two years after its announcement,"
693,BIOGRAPHICAL,"in June, 1827, made its unobtrusive appearance. There were very few"
694,BIOGRAPHICAL,"reviews, and the book sold hardly at all. Yet this was conspicuously"
695,BIOGRAPHICAL,"finer work than Clare had done before. Even ""that beautiful"
696,BIOGRAPHICAL,"frontispiece of De Wint's,"" as Taylor wrote, did not attract"
697,BIOGRAPHICAL,"attention. The forgotten poet, slaving at his small-holding, found"
698,BIOGRAPHICAL,that his dream had come true. Meanwhile Allan Cunningham had been
699,BIOGRAPHICAL,"inquiring into this non-success, and early in 1828 wrote to Clare"
700,BIOGRAPHICAL,urging him to come to London and interview the publisher. An
701,BIOGRAPHICAL,invitation from Mrs. Emmerson made thevisit possible. Once more then
702,BIOGRAPHICAL,"did Clare present himself at 20, Stratford Place, and find his ""sky"
703,BIOGRAPHICAL,"chamber"" ready to receive him. Nor did he allow long time to elapse"
704,BIOGRAPHICAL,"before finding out Allan Cunningham, who heartily approved of his plan"
705,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to call on Taylor, telling him to request a full statement of account."
706,BIOGRAPHICAL,"The next day, when Clare was on the point of making the demand, Taylor"
707,BIOGRAPHICAL,led across the trail with an unexpected offer; recommending Clare to
708,BIOGRAPHICAL,"buy the remaining copies of his ""Shepherd's Calendar"" from him at"
709,BIOGRAPHICAL,"half-a-crown each, that he might sell them in his own district."
710,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Clare asked time to reflect. A week later, against the wish of Allan"
711,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Cunningham, he accepted the scheme."
712,BIOGRAPHICAL,
713,BIOGRAPHICAL,Clare had had another object in coming to town. Dr. Darling had done
714,BIOGRAPHICAL,him so much good on a previous occasion that he wished to consult him
715,BIOGRAPHICAL,"anew. On the 25th of February, 1828, Clare wrote to his wife: ""Mr."
716,BIOGRAPHICAL,"Emmerson's doctor, a Mr. Ward, told me last night that there was"
717,BIOGRAPHICAL,little or nothing the matter with me--and yet I got no sleep the
718,BIOGRAPHICAL,"whole of last night."" Already, it appears, had coldness and dilemma"
719,BIOGRAPHICAL,"unsettled him. That they had not subdued him, and that his home life"
720,BIOGRAPHICAL,"was in the main happy and affectionate, and of as great an importance"
721,BIOGRAPHICAL,"to him as any of his aspirations, is to be judged from his poems"
722,BIOGRAPHICAL,and his letters of 1828 and thereabouts. They show him as the very
723,BIOGRAPHICAL,opposite of the feeble neurotic who has so often been beworded under
724,BIOGRAPHICAL,his name:

754,JOHN CLARE.,JOHN CLARE.
755,JOHN CLARE.,
756,JOHN CLARE.,
757,JOHN CLARE.,"During this stay in London, Clare had had proofs that his poems"
758,JOHN CLARE.,"were not completely overlooked. Strangers, recognizing him from the"
759,JOHN CLARE.,"portrait in the ""Village Minstrel,"" often addressed him in the street."
760,JOHN CLARE.,"In this way he first met Alaric A. Watts, and Henry Behnes, the"
761,JOHN CLARE.,"sculptor, who induced Clare to sit to him. The result was a strong,"
762,JOHN CLARE.,intensely faithful bust (preserved now in the Northampton Free
763,JOHN CLARE.,"Library). Hilton, who had painted Clare in water-colours and in oils,"
764,JOHN CLARE.,"celebrated with Behnes and Clare the modelling of this bust, all three"
765,JOHN CLARE.,avoiding a dinner of lions arranged by Mrs. Emmerson. On another
766,JOHN CLARE.,"occasion, Clare found a congenial spirit in William Hone."
767,JOHN CLARE.,
768,JOHN CLARE.,"But now Clare is home at Helpston, ready with a sack of poetry to"
769,JOHN CLARE.,tramp from house to house and try his luck. Sometimes he dragged
770,JOHN CLARE.,"himself thirty miles a day, meeting rectors who ""held it unbecoming"
771,JOHN CLARE.,"to see poems hawked about"": one day, having walked seven milesinto"
772,JOHN CLARE.,"Peterborough, and having sold no books anywhere, he trudged home"
773,JOHN CLARE.,to find Patty in the pains of labour; and now had to go back to
774,JOHN CLARE.,Peterborough as fast as he might for a doctor. Now there were nine
775,JOHN CLARE.,living beings dependent on Clare. At length he altered his plan of
776,JOHN CLARE.,"campaign, and advertised that his poems could be had at his cottage,"
777,JOHN CLARE.,"with some success. About this time Clare was invited to write for ""The"
778,JOHN CLARE.,"Spirit of the Age,"" and still he supplied brief pieces to the hated"
779,JOHN CLARE.,but unavoidable annuals. Letters too from several towns in East
780,JOHN CLARE.,"Anglia, summoning John Clare with his bag of books, at least promised"
781,JOHN CLARE.,"him some slight revenue; actually he only went to one of these places,"
782,JOHN CLARE.,"namely Boston, where the mayor gave a banquet in his honour, and"
783,JOHN CLARE.,enabled him to sell several volumes--autographed. Among the younger
784,JOHN CLARE.,"men, a similar feast was proposed; but Clare declined, afterwards"
785,JOHN CLARE.,reproaching himself bitterly on discovering that they had hidden ten
786,JOHN CLARE.,pounds in his wallet. On his return home not only himself but the rest
787,JOHN CLARE.,"of the family in turn fell ill with fever, so that the spring of 1829"
788,JOHN CLARE.,found Clare out of work and faced with heavy doctor's-bills.
789,JOHN CLARE.,
790,JOHN CLARE.,"Intellectually, John Clare was in 1828 and 1829 probably at his"
791,JOHN CLARE.,zenith. He had ceased long since to play the poetic ploughman; he had
792,JOHN CLARE.,gained in his verses something more ardent and stirring than he had
793,JOHN CLARE.,"shown in the ""Shepherd's Calendar""; and the long fight (for it was"
794,JOHN CLARE.,nothing less) against leading-strings and obstruction now began to
795,JOHN CLARE.,manifest itself in poems of regret and of soliloquy. Having long
796,JOHN CLARE.,"written for others' pleasure, he now wrote for his own nature."
797,JOHN CLARE.,
798,JOHN CLARE.,I would not wish the burning blaze
799,JOHN CLARE.,"Of fame around a restless world,"
800,JOHN CLARE.,The thunder and the storm of praise
801,JOHN CLARE.,In crowded tumults heard and hurled.
802,JOHN CLARE.,
803,JOHN CLARE.,There had been few periods of mental repose since 1820. His brain and
804,JOHN CLARE.,"his poetic genius, by this long discipline and fashioning, were now"
805,JOHN CLARE.,triumphant together. The declension from this high estate might have
806,JOHN CLARE.,been more abrupt but for the change in his fortunes. He had again
807,JOHN CLARE.,"with gentleness demanded his accounts from his publisher, and when in"
808,JOHN CLARE.,"August, 1829, these accounts actually arrived, disputed several points"
809,JOHN CLARE.,and gained certain concessions: payment was made from the editors of
810,JOHN CLARE.,annuals; and with these reliefs came the chance for him to rent a
811,JOHN CLARE.,small farm and to work on the land of Earl Fitzwilliam. His working
812,JOHN CLARE.,"hours were long, and his mind was forced to be idle. This salutary"
813,JOHN CLARE.,"state of affairs lasted through 1830, until happiness seemed the only"
814,JOHN CLARE.,possibility before him. What poems he wrote occurred suddenly and
815,JOHN CLARE.,simply to him. His children--now six in number--were growing up in
816,JOHN CLARE.,more comfort and in more prospect than he had ever enjoyed. But he
817,JOHN CLARE.,reckoned not with illness.
818,JOHN CLARE.,
819,JOHN CLARE.,"In short, illness reduced Clare almost to skin-and-bone. Farming not"
820,JOHN CLARE.,only added nothing but made encroachment on his small stipend. In
821,JOHN CLARE.,"despair he flung himself into field labour again, and was carried home"
822,JOHN CLARE.,nearly dead with fever. Friends there were not wanting to send food
823,JOHN CLARE.,"and medicine; Parson Mossop, having long ago been converted to Clare,"
824,JOHN CLARE.,"did much for him. Even so the landlord distrained for rent, and Clare"
825,JOHN CLARE.,applied to his old friend Henderson the botanist at Milton Park. Lord
826,JOHN CLARE.,Milton came by and Clare was encouraged to tell him his trouble;
827,JOHN CLARE.,his intense phrases and bearing were such that the nobleman at once
828,JOHN CLARE.,"promised him a new cottage and a plot of ground. At the same time, he"
829,JOHN CLARE.,expressed his hope that there would soon be another volume of poems
830,JOHN CLARE.,"by John Clare. This hope was the spark which fired a dangerous train,"
831,JOHN CLARE.,perhaps; for Clare once again fell into his exhausting habit of poetry
832,JOHN CLARE.,all the day and every day. He decided to publish a new volume by
833,JOHN CLARE.,subscription.
834,JOHN CLARE.,
835,JOHN CLARE.,"The new cottage was in the well-orcharded village of Northborough,"
836,JOHN CLARE.,three miles from Helpston. It was indeed luxurious in comparison with
837,JOHN CLARE.,"the old stooping house where Clare had spent nearly forty years, but"
838,JOHN CLARE.,there was more in that old house than mere stone and timber. Clare
839,JOHN CLARE.,began to look on the coming change with terror; delayed the move day
840,JOHN CLARE.,"after day, to the distress of poor Patty; and when at last news came"
841,JOHN CLARE.,from Milton Park that the Earl was not content with such strange
842,JOHN CLARE.,"hesitation, and when Patty had her household on the line of march, he"
843,JOHN CLARE.,"""followed in the rear, walking mechanically, with eyes half shut, as"
844,JOHN CLARE.,"if in a dream."" There was no delay in his self-expression."
845,JOHN CLARE.,
846,JOHN CLARE.,"I've left mine own old home of homes,"
847,JOHN CLARE.,Green fields and every pleasant place;
848,JOHN CLARE.,The summer like a stranger comes;
849,JOHN CLARE.,I pause and hardly know her face.
850,JOHN CLARE.,"I miss the hazel's happy green,"
851,JOHN CLARE.,"The bluebell's quiet hanging blooms,"
852,JOHN CLARE.,"Where envy's sneer was never seen,"
853,JOHN CLARE.,Where staring malice never comes.
854,JOHN CLARE.,
855,JOHN CLARE.,"This and many other verses, not the least pathetic in our language,"
856,JOHN CLARE.,"were written by John Clare on June 20th, 1832, on the occasion of his"
857,JOHN CLARE.,moving out of a small and crowded cottage in a village street to
858,JOHN CLARE.,"a roomy, romantic farmhouse standing in its own grounds. Was this"
859,JOHN CLARE.,"ingratitude? ask rather, is the dyer's hand subdued to what it works"
860,JOHN CLARE.,in?
861,JOHN CLARE.,
862,JOHN CLARE.,"Clare rapidly proceeded with his new collection of poems, destined"
863,JOHN CLARE.,"never to appear in his lifetime. In a thick oblong blank-book, divided"
864,JOHN CLARE.,"into four sections to receive Tales in Verse, Poems, Ballads and"
865,JOHN CLARE.,"Songs, and Sonnets, he copied his best work in a hand small but"
866,JOHN CLARE.,"clear, and with a rare freedom from slips of the pen. His proposals,"
867,JOHN CLARE.,"reprinted with a warm-hearted comment in the _Athenaeum_ of 1832, were"
868,JOHN CLARE.,in these terms:
869,JOHN CLARE.,
870,JOHN CLARE.,The proposals for publishing these fugitives being addressed to
871,JOHN CLARE.,friends no further apology is necessary than the plain statement of
872,JOHN CLARE.,"facts. Necessity is said to be the mother of invention, but there"
873,JOHN CLARE.,"is very little need of invention for truth; and the truth is, that"
874,JOHN CLARE.,"difficulty has grown up like a tree of the forest, and being no longer"
875,JOHN CLARE.,"able to conceal it, I meet it in the best way possible by attempting"
876,JOHN CLARE.,to publish them for my own benefit and that of a numerous and
877,JOHN CLARE.,increasing family. It were false delicacy to make an idle parade
878,JOHN CLARE.,"of independence in my situation, and it would be unmanly to make"
879,JOHN CLARE.,"a troublesome appeal to favours, public or private, like a public"
880,JOHN CLARE.,"petitioner. Friends neither expect this from me, or wish me to do it"
881,JOHN CLARE.,"to others, though it is partly owing to such advice that I was induced"
882,JOHN CLARE.,"to come forward with these proposals, and if they are successful"
883,JOHN CLARE.,"they will render me a benefit, and if not they will not cancel any"
884,JOHN CLARE.,"obligations that I may have received from friends, public and"
885,JOHN CLARE.,"private, to whom my best wishes are due, and having said this much in"
886,JOHN CLARE.,"furtherance of my intentions, I will conclude by explaining them."
887,JOHN CLARE.,
888,JOHN CLARE.,"Proposals for publishing in 1 volume, F.c. 8vo, The Midsummer Cushion,"
889,JOHN CLARE.,"or Cottage Poems, by John Clare."
890,JOHN CLARE.,
891,JOHN CLARE.,"1st. The Book will be printed on fine paper, and published as soon as"
892,JOHN CLARE.,a sufficient number of subscribers are procured to defray the expense
893,JOHN CLARE.,of publishing.
894,JOHN CLARE.,
895,JOHN CLARE.,"2nd. It will consist of a number of fugitive trifles, some of which"
896,JOHN CLARE.,"have appeared in different periodicals, and of others that have never"
897,JOHN CLARE.,been published.
898,JOHN CLARE.,
899,JOHN CLARE.,"3rd. No money is requested until the volume shall be delivered, free"
900,JOHN CLARE.,"of expense, to every subscriber."
901,JOHN CLARE.,
902,JOHN CLARE.,"4th. The price will not exceed seven shillings and sixpence, and it"
903,JOHN CLARE.,"may not be so much, as the number of pages and the expense of the book"
904,JOHN CLARE.,will be regulated by the Publisher.
905,JOHN CLARE.,
906,JOHN CLARE.,In his new home Clare was for a time troubled with visitors; to most
907,JOHN CLARE.,"he was aloof, but sometimes he spoke freely of his affairs. One"
908,JOHN CLARE.,visitor who found him in the communicative mood chanced to be the
909,JOHN CLARE.,"editor of a magazine, _The Alfred._ The denials of Clare, frankly"
910,JOHN CLARE.,given to rumours of his new benefits (variously estimated between two
911,JOHN CLARE.,"hundred and a thousand a year), were to this gentleman as meat and"
912,JOHN CLARE.,"drink; and _The Alfred_ for October the 5th, 1832, contained a violent"
913,JOHN CLARE.,manifesto condemning publishers and patrons in the most fiery fashion
914,JOHN CLARE.,and apparently inspired by the poet himself. This did his cause much
915,JOHN CLARE.,"damage, and Clare wrote to the perpetrator in anger: ""There never"
916,JOHN CLARE.,was a more scandalous insult to my feelings than this officious
917,JOHN CLARE.,"misstatement.... I am no beggar; for my income is £36, and though"
918,JOHN CLARE.,"I have had no final settlement with Taylor, I expect to have"
919,JOHN CLARE.,"one directly."" Clare ended by demanding a recantation. None was"
920,JOHN CLARE.,"forthcoming, and the effect on patrons and poet was unfortunate"
921,JOHN CLARE.,indeed. Yet still he could write of himself in this uncoloured style:
922,JOHN CLARE.,"""I am ready to laugh with you at my own vanity. For I sit sometimes"
923,JOHN CLARE.,"and wonder over the little noise I have made in the world, until I"
924,JOHN CLARE.,think I have written nothing yet to deserve any praise at all. So
925,JOHN CLARE.,"the spirit of fame, of living a little after life like a noise on a"
926,JOHN CLARE.,"conspicuous place, urges my blood upward into unconscious melodies;"
927,JOHN CLARE.,and striding down my orchard and homestead I hum and sing inwardly
928,JOHN CLARE.,"these little madrigals, and then go in and pen them down, thinking"
929,JOHN CLARE.,them much better things than they are--until I look over them again.
930,JOHN CLARE.,And then the charm vanishes into the vanity that I shall do something
931,JOHN CLARE.,"better ere I die; and so, in spite of myself, I rhyme on and write"
932,JOHN CLARE.,"nothing but little things at last."""
933,JOHN CLARE.,
934,JOHN CLARE.,"With the gear that Mrs. Emmerson's kindness and activity had provided,"
935,JOHN CLARE.,Clare kept his garden and ground in order; yet the winter of 1832 was
936,JOHN CLARE.,a time of great hardship and foreboding. His youngest son Charles was
937,JOHN CLARE.,"born on the 4th of January, 1833; the event shook Clare's nerve more"
938,JOHN CLARE.,terribly perhaps than anything before had done and he went out
939,JOHN CLARE.,into the fields. Late in the day his daughter Anna found him lying
940,JOHN CLARE.,"unconscious, and for a month he had to keep his bed. As if to prove"
941,JOHN CLARE.,"the proverb ""It never rains but it pours,"" subscribers to his new"
942,JOHN CLARE.,"volume hung back, and when spring had come they numbered in all"
943,JOHN CLARE.,"forty-nine. Clare submitted the work to the publishers, great and"
944,JOHN CLARE.,"small, but the best offer that he got depended on his providing in"
945,JOHN CLARE.,advance £100 for the necessary steel engravings. And now Clare lost
946,JOHN CLARE.,"all his delight in lonely walks, but sitting in his study wrote"
947,JOHN CLARE.,"curious paraphrases of ""the Psalms, the Proverbs, and the Book of"
948,JOHN CLARE.,"Job."" His manner towards those round him became apathetic and silent."
949,JOHN CLARE.,Even the news brought by his doctor--who prescribed Clare to his other
950,JOHN CLARE.,"patients--that subscribers now were more than two hundred, seemed to"
951,JOHN CLARE.,sound meaningless in his ears. But even these danger-signs seemed
952,JOHN CLARE.,discounted by the self-command and cheerfulness which Clare soon
953,JOHN CLARE.,"afterwards regained; and ashamed of his misjudgment, Dr. Smith came to"
954,JOHN CLARE.,the conclusion that he need visit Clare no more. An attack of insanity
955,JOHN CLARE.,"immediately followed, during which Clare did not know his wife, his"
956,JOHN CLARE.,children or himself.
957,JOHN CLARE.,
958,JOHN CLARE.,"From this heavy trance he awoke, bitterly aware of his peril. He wrote"
959,JOHN CLARE.,"at once to Taylor, again and again. ""You must excuse my writing; but I"
960,JOHN CLARE.,feel that if I do not write now I shall not be able. What I wish is to
961,JOHN CLARE.,"get under Dr. Darling's advice, or to have his advice to go somewhere;"
962,JOHN CLARE.,"for I have not been from home this twelve-month, and cannot get"
963,JOHN CLARE.,"anywhere."" ... ""If I could but go to London, I think I should get"
964,JOHN CLARE.,better. How would you advise me to come? I dare not come up by myself.
965,JOHN CLARE.,Do you think one of my children might go with me?... Thank God my wife
966,JOHN CLARE.,"and children are all well."" Taylor wrote once in mildly sympathetic"
967,JOHN CLARE.,"words, but probably thought that Clare was making much ado about"
968,JOHN CLARE.,nothing. And here at least was the opportunity for a patron to save a
969,JOHN CLARE.,"poet from death-in-life for five pounds. Nothing was done, and Clare"
970,JOHN CLARE.,"sat in his study, writing more and more paraphrases of the Old"
971,JOHN CLARE.,"Testament, together with series of sonnets of a grotesque, rustic"
972,JOHN CLARE.,"sort, not resembling any other poems in our language."
973,JOHN CLARE.,
974,JOHN CLARE.,"The ""Midsummer Cushion"" had been set aside, but Clare had submitted"
975,JOHN CLARE.,many of the poems together with hundreds more to Messrs. Whittaker.
976,JOHN CLARE.,"Largely through the recommendations of Mr. Emmerson, the publishers"
977,JOHN CLARE.,"decided to print a volume from these, picking principally those poems"
978,JOHN CLARE.,which had already shown themselves respectable by appearing in the
979,JOHN CLARE.,"annuals. One even written in 1820, ""The Autumn Robin,"" was somehow"
980,JOHN CLARE.,"chosen, to the exclusion of such later poems as ""Remembrances"""
981,JOHN CLARE.,"and ""The Fallen Elm."" With faults like these, the selection was"
982,JOHN CLARE.,"nevertheless a distinctly beautiful book of verse. In March, 1834,"
983,JOHN CLARE.,"Clare definitely received forty pounds for the copyright, and finally"
984,JOHN CLARE.,"in July, 1835, appeared this his last book, ""The Rural Muse."" Its"
985,JOHN CLARE.,"success was half-hearted, in spite of a magnificent eulogy by"
986,JOHN CLARE.,"Christopher North in _Blackwood's_, and of downright welcome by the"
987,JOHN CLARE.,"_Athenaeum_, the _New Monthly_ and other good judges. There was a slow"
988,JOHN CLARE.,"sale for several months, but for Clare there was little chance of new"
989,JOHN CLARE.,"remuneration. This he could regard calmly, for while the book was in"
990,JOHN CLARE.,the press he had received from the Literary Fund a present of fifty
991,JOHN CLARE.,pounds.
992,JOHN CLARE.,
993,JOHN CLARE.,Clare's malady slowly increased. The exact history of this decline is
994,JOHN CLARE.,"almost lost, yet we may well believe that the death of his mother on"
995,JOHN CLARE.,"the 18th of December, 1835, was a day of double blackness for him."
996,JOHN CLARE.,"The winter over, Patty made a great fight for his reason, and at last"
997,JOHN CLARE.,"persuaded him to go out for walks, which checked the decline. Now he"
998,JOHN CLARE.,"became so passionately fond of being out-of-doors that ""he could not"
999,JOHN CLARE.,"be made to stop a single day at home."" In one of these roving walks he"
1000,JOHN CLARE.,"met his old friend Mrs. Marsh, the wife of the Bishop of Peterborough."
1001,JOHN CLARE.,A few nights later as her guest he sat in the Peterborough theatre
1002,JOHN CLARE.,"watching the ""Merchant of Venice."" So vivid was his imagination--for"
1003,JOHN CLARE.,doubtless the strolling players were not in themselves convincing--that
1004,JOHN CLARE.,he at last began to shout at Shylock and try to attack him on the stage.
1005,JOHN CLARE.,"When Clare returned to Helpston, the change in him terrified his wife."
1006,JOHN CLARE.,"And yet, he rallied and walked the fields, and sitting on the window-seat"
1007,JOHN CLARE.,taught his sons to trim the two yew-trees in his garden into old-fashioned
1008,JOHN CLARE.,circles and cones. The positive signs of derangement which he had given so
1009,JOHN CLARE.,"far were not after all conclusive. He had seen Mary Joyce pass by, he had"
1010,JOHN CLARE.,"spoken to her, occasionally he as a third person had watched and discussed"
1011,JOHN CLARE.,the doings of John Clare and this lost sweetheart. He had surprised one or
1012,JOHN CLARE.,"two people by calling mole-hills mountains. One day, too, at Parson"
1013,JOHN CLARE.,Mossop's house he had suddenly pointed to figures moving up and down.
1014,JOHN CLARE.,"Under these circumstances, a Market Deeping doctor named Skrimshaw"
1015,JOHN CLARE.,certified him mad; and on similar grounds almost any one in the world
1016,JOHN CLARE.,might be clapped into an asylum.
1017,JOHN CLARE.,
1018,JOHN CLARE.,"Hallucinations ceased for a few months, but Mrs. Clare had difficulty"
1019,JOHN CLARE.,"in keeping outside interference at bay. Earl Fitzwilliam, in his"
1020,JOHN CLARE.,"position of landlord, proposed to send the man who called mole-hills"
1021,JOHN CLARE.,"mountains at once to the Northampton Asylum. When the summer came,"
1022,JOHN CLARE.,"unfortunately, Clare's mind seemed suddenly to give way, and"
1023,JOHN CLARE.,preparations were being made for his admission to the county Asylum
1024,JOHN CLARE.,"when letters came from Taylor and other old friends in London,"
1025,JOHN CLARE.,proposing to place him in private hands. Clare was taken accordingly
1026,JOHN CLARE.,"on the 16th of July, 1837, to Fair Mead House, Highbeach, in Epping"
1027,JOHN CLARE.,Forest.
1028,JOHN CLARE.,
1029,JOHN CLARE.,"Dr. Allen, the mild broad-minded founder of this excellent asylum, had"
1030,JOHN CLARE.,"few doubts as to the condition of Clare's mind, and assured him an"
1031,JOHN CLARE.,"eventual recovery. As with the fifty other patients, so he dealt with"
1032,JOHN CLARE.,"Clare: keeping him away from books, and making him work in the garden"
1033,JOHN CLARE.,"and the fields. Poetry, it is said, was made impossible for him, paper"
1034,JOHN CLARE.,being taken away from him; but it is not conceivable that Clare could
1035,JOHN CLARE.,live apart from this kindest of companions for many months together.
1036,JOHN CLARE.,"Soon he was allowed to go out into the forest at his will, often"
1037,JOHN CLARE.,"taking his new acquaintance Thomas Campbell, the son of the poet,"
1038,JOHN CLARE.,on these wood-rambles. His hallucinations do not appear to have
1039,JOHN CLARE.,"diminished, although they changed. He was now convinced that Mary"
1040,JOHN CLARE.,"Joyce was his true wife--Patty was his ""second wife."" He had known"
1041,JOHN CLARE.,"William Shakespeare, and many other great ones in person. Why such men"
1042,JOHN CLARE.,"as Wordsworth, Campbell and Byron were allowed to steal John Clare's"
1043,JOHN CLARE.,"best poems and to publish them as their own, he could not imagine."
1044,JOHN CLARE.,John Clare was not only noble by nature but by blood also.--On such
1045,JOHN CLARE.,rumoured eccentricities did the popular notion of his madness rest. It
1046,JOHN CLARE.,would seem that anything he said was taken down in evidence against
1047,JOHN CLARE.,him. How dared he be figurative?
1048,JOHN CLARE.,
1049,JOHN CLARE.,"On the other hand, Miss Mitford records figurative conversations not"
1050,JOHN CLARE.,so easily explained; his eye-witness's account of the execution of
1051,JOHN CLARE.,"Charles the First, ""the most graphic and minute, with an accuracy as"
1052,JOHN CLARE.,to costume and manners far exceeding what would probably have been at
1053,JOHN CLARE.,"his command if sane,"" and his seaman's narrative of the battle of"
1054,JOHN CLARE.,the Nile and the death of Nelson in exact nautical detail. These
1055,JOHN CLARE.,"imaginations she compares to clairvoyance. Cyrus Redding, who left"
1056,JOHN CLARE.,"three accounts of his visit, found him ""no longer, as he was formerly,"
1057,JOHN CLARE.,"attenuated and pale of complexion ... a little man, of muscular frame"
1058,JOHN CLARE.,"and firmly set, his complexion fresh and forehead high, a nose"
1059,JOHN CLARE.,"somewhat aquiline, and long full chin."" ""His manner was perfectly"
1060,JOHN CLARE.,"unembarrassed, his language correct and fluent; he appeared to possess"
1061,JOHN CLARE.,"great candour and openness of mind, and much of the temperament of"
1062,JOHN CLARE.,"genius. There was about his manner no tincture of rusticity."" Once"
1063,JOHN CLARE.,"only during the conversation did Clare betray any aberration, abruptly"
1064,JOHN CLARE.,"introducing and abandoning the topic of Prize-fighting, as though ""a"
1065,JOHN CLARE.,"note had got into a piece of music which had no business there."""
1066,JOHN CLARE.,
1067,JOHN CLARE.,"Clare told Redding that he missed his wife and his home, the society"
1068,JOHN CLARE.,"of women, and books. At last, having been in the private asylum four"
1069,JOHN CLARE.,"years, he ""returned home out of Essex"" on foot, leaving Epping Forest"
1070,JOHN CLARE.,"early on July 20, 1841, and dragging himself along almost without"
1071,JOHN CLARE.,pause until July 23. Of this amazing journey he himself wrote an
1072,JOHN CLARE.,"account for ""Mary Clare,"" which is printed in full in Martin's ""Life"":"
1073,JOHN CLARE.,it is both in style and in subject an extraordinary document. The
1074,JOHN CLARE.,"first night, he says, ""I lay down with my head towards the north, to"
1075,JOHN CLARE.,"show myself the steering-point in the morning."" On ""the third day I"
1076,JOHN CLARE.,satisfied my hunger by eating the grass on the roadside which seemed
1077,JOHN CLARE.,to taste something like bread. I was hungry and eat heartily till I
1078,JOHN CLARE.,"was satisfied; in fact, the meal seemed to do me good."" And ""there was"
1079,JOHN CLARE.,"little to notice, for the road very often looked as stupid as myself."""
1080,JOHN CLARE.,"At last between Peterborough and Helpston ""a cart met me, with a man,"
1081,JOHN CLARE.,"a woman and a boy in it. When nearing me the woman jumped out, and"
1082,JOHN CLARE.,"caught fast hold of my hands, and wished me to get into the cart. But"
1083,JOHN CLARE.,I refused; I thought her either drunk or mad. But when I was told it
1084,JOHN CLARE.,"was my second wife, Patty, I got in, and was soon at Northborough."""
1085,JOHN CLARE.,
1086,JOHN CLARE.,"Rest and home somewhat restored Clare's mind, and it was Patty's hope"
1087,JOHN CLARE.,and aim to keep him in his cottage. Though she attempted to keep paper
1088,JOHN CLARE.,from him he contrived to write verse paraphrases of the prophetical
1089,JOHN CLARE.,"books, sometimes putting in between a song to Mary or a stanza of"
1090,JOHN CLARE.,"nature poetry. At the end of August, round the edges of a local"
1091,JOHN CLARE.,"newspaper he wrote the draft of a letter to Dr. Allen, of Highbeach,"
1092,JOHN CLARE.,which in the almost complete absence of documents for this period is
1093,JOHN CLARE.,an important expression:
1094,JOHN CLARE.,

1099,"MY DEAR SIR,","dullness and disappointment prevented me, for I found your words true"
1100,"MY DEAR SIR,","on my return here, having neither friends nor home left. But as it is"
1101,"MY DEAR SIR,","called the ""Poet's Cottage"" I claimed a lodging in it where I now am."
1102,"MY DEAR SIR,",One of my fancies I found here with her family and all well. They met
1103,"MY DEAR SIR,","me on this side Werrington with a horse and cart, and found me all but"
1104,"MY DEAR SIR,","knocked up, for I had travelled from Essex to Northamptonshire without"
1105,"MY DEAR SIR,",ever eating or drinking all the way--save one pennyworth of beer which
1106,"MY DEAR SIR,","was given me by a farm servant near an odd house called ""The Plough."""
1107,"MY DEAR SIR,","One day I eat grass to keep on my [feet], but on the last day I chewed"

1113,"MY DEAR SIR,",place and could have staid in yours on the Forest if any of my friends
1114,"MY DEAR SIR,",had noticed me or come to see me. But the greatest annoyance in such
1115,"MY DEAR SIR,","places as yours are those servants styled keepers, who often assumed"
1116,"MY DEAR SIR,",as much authority over me as if I had been their prisoner; and not
1117,"MY DEAR SIR,",liking to quarrel I put up with it till I was weary of the place
1118,"MY DEAR SIR,","altogether. So I heard the voice of freedom, and started, and could"
1119,"MY DEAR SIR,",have travelled to York with a penny loaf and a pint of beer; for I

1121,"MY DEAR SIR,","nearly lost the sole before I started, and let in the water and silt"

1166,JOHN CLARE,me.
1167,JOHN CLARE,
1168,JOHN CLARE,"Patty worked her hardest to keep Clare out of future asylums, but"
1169,JOHN CLARE,it seems that her wishes were overridden. Dr. Allen let it be known
1170,JOHN CLARE,through the _Gentleman's Magazine_ and other publications that Clare
1171,JOHN CLARE,would in the ordinary way almost certainly recover: but the local
1172,JOHN CLARE,"doctors knew better. On the authority of an anonymous ""patron"" the"
1173,JOHN CLARE,doctor Skrimshaw who had previously found Clare insane now paid
1174,JOHN CLARE,"him another visit, and with a certain William Page, also of Market"
1175,JOHN CLARE,"Deeping, condemned him to be shut up ""After years addicted to poetical"
1176,JOHN CLARE,"prosings."""
1177,JOHN CLARE,
1178,JOHN CLARE,"Then one day keepers came, and a vain struggle, and the Northborough"
1179,JOHN CLARE,cottage saw John Clare no more. He was now in the asylum at
1180,JOHN CLARE,"Northampton, and the minds of Northamptonshire noblemen need no longer"
1181,JOHN CLARE,be troubled that a poet was wandering in miserable happiness under
1182,JOHN CLARE,their park walls.
1183,JOHN CLARE,
1184,JOHN CLARE,"So far, the madness of Clare had been rather an exaltation of mind"
1185,JOHN CLARE,than a collapse. Forsaken mainly by his friends--even Mrs. Emmerson's
1186,JOHN CLARE,"letters ceased in 1837,--unrecognized by the new generation of writers"
1187,JOHN CLARE,"and of readers, hated by his neighbours, wasted with hopeless love,"
1188,JOHN CLARE,he had encouraged a life of imagination and ideals. Imagination
1189,JOHN CLARE,"overpowered him, until his perception of realities failed him."
1190,JOHN CLARE,"He could see Mary Joyce or talk with her, he had a family of"
1191,JOHN CLARE,"dream-children by her: but if this was madness, there was method in"
1192,JOHN CLARE,"it. But now the blow fell, imprisonment for life: down went John Clare"
1193,JOHN CLARE,"into idiocy, ""the ludicrous with the terrible."" And even from this"
1194,JOHN CLARE,desperate abyss he rose.
1195,JOHN CLARE,
1196,JOHN CLARE,Earl Fitzwilliam paid for Clare's maintenance in the Northampton
1197,JOHN CLARE,"Asylum, but at the ordinary rate for poor people. The asylum"
1198,JOHN CLARE,authorities at least seemed to have recognized Clare as a man out
1199,JOHN CLARE,"of the common, treating him as a ""gentleman patient,"" and allowing"
1200,JOHN CLARE,him--for the first twelve years--to go when he wished into
1201,JOHN CLARE,"Northampton, where he would sit under the portico of All Saints'"
1202,JOHN CLARE,"Church in meditation. What dreams were these! ""sometimes his face"
1203,JOHN CLARE,"would brighten up as if illuminated by an inward sun, overwhelming"
1204,JOHN CLARE,"in its glory and beauty."" Sane intervals came, in which he wrote his"
1205,JOHN CLARE,poems; and these poems were of a serenity and richness not surpassed
1206,JOHN CLARE,"in his earlier work, including for instance ""Graves of Infants"" (May,"
1207,JOHN CLARE,"1844), ""The Sleep of Spring"" (1844), ""Invitation to Eternity"" (1848)"
1208,JOHN CLARE,"and ""Clock-a-Clay"" (before 1854). But little news of him went farther"
1209,JOHN CLARE,"afield than the town of Northampton, and the poems remained in"
1210,JOHN CLARE,manuscript. A glimpse of Clare in these years is left us by a Mr.
1211,JOHN CLARE,"Jesse Hall, who as an admirer of his poems called on him in May, 1848."
1212,JOHN CLARE,"""As it was a very fine day, he said we could go and have a walk in the"
1213,JOHN CLARE,grounds of the institution. We discussed many subjects and I found him
1214,JOHN CLARE,"very rational, there being very little evidence of derangement.... I"
1215,JOHN CLARE,asked permission for him to come to my hotel the next day. We spent
1216,JOHN CLARE,a few hours together. I was very sorry to find a great change in him
1217,JOHN CLARE,"from the previous day, and I had ample evidence of his reason being"
1218,JOHN CLARE,"dethroned, his conversation being disconnected and many of his remarks"
1219,JOHN CLARE,displaying imbecility: but at times he spoke rationally and to the
1220,JOHN CLARE,"point."" To Hall as to almost every other casual visitor Clare gave"
1221,JOHN CLARE,several manuscript poems.
1222,JOHN CLARE,
1223,JOHN CLARE,"A letter to his wife, dated July 19th, 1848, gives fresh insight into"
1224,JOHN CLARE,his condition:
1225,JOHN CLARE,
1226,"MY DEAR WIFE,","MY DEAR WIFE,"
1227,"MY DEAR WIFE,",
1228,"MY DEAR WIFE,","I have not written to you a long while, but here I am in the land of"
1229,"MY DEAR WIFE,",Sodom where all the people's brains are turned the wrong way. I was
1230,"MY DEAR WIFE,","glad to see John yesterday, and should like to have gone back with"
1231,"MY DEAR WIFE,","him, for I am very weary of being here. You might come and fetch me"
1232,"MY DEAR WIFE,","away, for I think I have been here long enough."
1233,"MY DEAR WIFE,",
1234,"MY DEAR WIFE,",I write this in a green meadow by the side of the river agen Stokes
1235,"MY DEAR WIFE,","Mill, and I see three of their daughters and a son now and then. The"
1236,"MY DEAR WIFE,",confusion and roar of mill dams and locks is sounding very pleasant
1237,"MY DEAR WIFE,","while I write it, and it's a very beautiful evening; the meadows are"
1238,"MY DEAR WIFE,",greener than usual after the shower and the rivers are brimful. I
1239,"MY DEAR WIFE,",think it is about two years since I was first sent up in this Hell
1240,"MY DEAR WIFE,",and French Bastille of English liberty. Keep yourselves happy and
1241,"MY DEAR WIFE,","comfortable and love one another. By and bye I shall be with you,"
1242,"MY DEAR WIFE,",perhaps before you expect me. There has been a great storm here
1243,"MY DEAR WIFE,",with thunder and hail that did much damage to the glass in the
1244,"MY DEAR WIFE,",neighbourhood. Hailstones the size of hens' eggs fell in some places.
1245,"MY DEAR WIFE,",Did your brother John come to Northborough or go to Barnack? His uncle
1246,"MY DEAR WIFE,",John Riddle came the next morning but did not stay. I thought I was
1247,"MY DEAR WIFE,",coming home but I got cheated. I see many of your little brothers and
1248,"MY DEAR WIFE,","sisters at Northampton, weary and dirty with hard work; some of them"
1249,"MY DEAR WIFE,","with red hands, but all in ruddy good health: some of them are along"
1250,"MY DEAR WIFE,",with your sister Ruth Dakken who went from Helpston a little girl.
1251,"MY DEAR WIFE,","Give my love to your Mother, Grandfather and Sisters, and believe me,"

1257,JOHN CLARE,
1258,JOHN CLARE,
1259,JOHN CLARE,Life went on with little incident for Clare in the asylum. To amuse
1260,JOHN CLARE,himself he read and wrote continually; in 1850 his portrait was
1261,JOHN CLARE,"painted, and his death reported. In 1854 he assisted Miss Baker in her"
1262,JOHN CLARE,"""Glossary of Northamptonshire Words and Phrases,"" providing her with"
1263,JOHN CLARE,all his asylum manuscripts and specially contributing some verses on
1264,JOHN CLARE,"May-day customs. At this time an edition of his poems was projected,"
1265,JOHN CLARE,and the idea met with much interest among those who yet remembered
1266,JOHN CLARE,"Clare: but it faded and was gone. The ""harmless lunatic"" was at length"
1267,JOHN CLARE,"confined to the asylum grounds, and to the distresses of his mind"
1268,JOHN CLARE,began to be added those of the ageing body. Hope even now was not
1269,JOHN CLARE,"dead, and a poor versifier but good Samaritan who saw him in 1857"
1270,JOHN CLARE,printed some lines in the _London Journal_ for November 2lst asking
1271,JOHN CLARE,the aid of Heaven to restore Clare to his home and his poetry (for he
1272,JOHN CLARE,seems to have written little at that time); a gentleman who was in a
1273,JOHN CLARE,position to judge wrote also that in the spring of 1860 his mind was
1274,JOHN CLARE,"calmer than it had been for years, and that he was induced to write"
1275,JOHN CLARE,verses once more. But Clare was sixty-seven years old; it was perhaps
1276,JOHN CLARE,"too late to release him, and perhaps he had grown past the desire of"
1277,JOHN CLARE,"liberty. On the 7th of March he wrote to Patty, asking after all his"
1278,JOHN CLARE,"children and some of his friends, and sending his love to his father"
1279,JOHN CLARE,"and mother (so long since dead); signing himself ""Your loving husband"
1280,JOHN CLARE,"till death, John Clare."" On the 8th he wrote a note to Mr. Hopkins:"
1281,JOHN CLARE,"""Why I am shut up I don't know."" And on the 9th he answered his ""dear"
1282,JOHN CLARE,"Daughter Sophia's letter,"" saying that he was ""not quite so well to"
1283,JOHN CLARE,"write"" as he had been, and (presumably in reply to some offer of books"
1284,JOHN CLARE,"or comforts) ""I want nothing from Home to come here. I shall be glad"
1285,JOHN CLARE,"to see you when you come."" In the course of 1860 he was photographed,"
1286,JOHN CLARE,and that the Northampton folk still took an interest in their poet is
1287,JOHN CLARE,proved by the sale of these likenesses; copies could be seen in the
1288,JOHN CLARE,shops until recent years. But that Clare might have been set at large
1289,JOHN CLARE,seems not to have occurred to those who in curiosity purchased his
1290,JOHN CLARE,"portrait. A visitor named John Plummer went to the asylum in 1861, and"
1291,JOHN CLARE,found Clare reading in the window recess of a very comfortable room.
1292,JOHN CLARE,"""Time had dealt kindly with him,"" he wrote. ""It was in vain that we"
1293,JOHN CLARE,strove to arrest his attention: he merely looked at us with a vacant
1294,JOHN CLARE,"gaze for a moment, and then went on reading his book."" This was"
1295,JOHN CLARE,possibly rather the action of sanity than of insanity. Yet Plummer did
1296,JOHN CLARE,"his best, in _Once a Week_ and elsewhere, to call attention to"
1297,JOHN CLARE,"the forgotten poet, who was visited soon afterwards by the worthy"
1298,JOHN CLARE,"Nonconformist Paxton Hood, and presently by Joseph Whitaker, the"
1299,JOHN CLARE,"publisher of the ""Almanack."""
1300,JOHN CLARE,
1301,JOHN CLARE,Clare became patriarchal in appearance; and his powers failed more
1302,JOHN CLARE,"rapidly, until he could walk no longer. A wheel-chair was procured for"
1303,JOHN CLARE,"him, that he might still enjoy the garden and the open air. On Good"
1304,JOHN CLARE,Friday in 1864 he was taken out for the last time; afterwards he could
1305,JOHN CLARE,"not be moved, yet he would still manage to reach his window-seat; then"
1306,JOHN CLARE,"came paralysis, and on the afternoon of May the 20th, 1864,"
1307,JOHN CLARE,
1308,JOHN CLARE,"His soul seemed with the free,"
1309,JOHN CLARE,He died so quietly.
1310,JOHN CLARE,
1311,JOHN CLARE,"His last years had been spent in some degree of happiness, and"
1312,JOHN CLARE,"from officials and fellow-patients he had received gentleness, and"
1313,JOHN CLARE,"sympathy, and even homage. It has been said, not once nor twice but"
1314,JOHN CLARE,"many times, that in the asylum he was never visited by his wife, nor"
1315,JOHN CLARE,"by any of his children except the youngest son, Charles, who came"
1316,JOHN CLARE,once. That any one should condemn Patty for her absence is surely
1317,JOHN CLARE,presumptuous in the extreme: she was now keeping her home together
1318,JOHN CLARE,"with the greatest difficulty, nor can it be known what deeper motives"
1319,JOHN CLARE,"influenced relationships between wife and husband, even if the name of"
1320,JOHN CLARE,Mary Joyce meant nothing. That the children came to see their father
1321,JOHN CLARE,"whenever they could, the letters given above signify: but, if the"
1322,JOHN CLARE,"opportunities were not many, there were the strongest of reasons."
1323,JOHN CLARE,"Frederick died in 1843, just after Clare's incarceration: Anna in the"
1324,JOHN CLARE,"year following: Charles the youngest, a boy of great promise, in 1852:"
1325,JOHN CLARE,"and Sophia in 1863. William, and John who went to Wales, went when"
1326,JOHN CLARE,occasion came and when they could afford the expense of the journey:
1327,JOHN CLARE,"Eliza, who survived last of Clare's children and who most of all"
1328,JOHN CLARE,"understood him and his poetry, was unable through illness to leave her"
1329,JOHN CLARE,"home for many years, yet she went once to see him. The isolation which"
1330,JOHN CLARE,"found its expression in ""I Am"" was another matter: it was the sense of"
1331,JOHN CLARE,"futility, of not having fulfilled his mission, of total eclipse"
1332,JOHN CLARE,"that spoke there. N. P. Willis, perhaps the Howitts, and a few more"
1333,JOHN CLARE,"worthies came for brief hours to see Clare, rather as a phenomenon"
1334,JOHN CLARE,"than as a poet; but Clare, who had sat with Elia and his assembled"
1335,JOHN CLARE,"host, who had held his own with the finest brains of his time and had"
1336,JOHN CLARE,written such a cornucopia of genuine poetry now lying useless in his
1337,JOHN CLARE,"cottage at Northborough, cannot but have regarded the Northampton"
1338,JOHN CLARE,"Asylum as ""the shipwreck of his own esteems."""
1339,JOHN CLARE,
1340,JOHN CLARE,"Clare was buried on May 25th, 1864, where he had wished to be, in the"
1341,JOHN CLARE,churchyard at Helpston. The letter informing Mrs. Clare of his death
1342,JOHN CLARE,"was delivered at the wrong address, and did not eventually reach her"
1343,JOHN CLARE,at Northborough before Clare's coffin arrived at Helpston; scarcely
1344,JOHN CLARE,"giving her time to attend the funeral the next day. Indeed, had the"
1345,JOHN CLARE,"sexton at Helpston been at home, the bearers would have urged him to"
1346,JOHN CLARE,"arrange for the funeral at once; in his absence, they left the coffin"
1347,JOHN CLARE,"in an inn parlour for the night, and a scandal was barely prevented."
1348,JOHN CLARE,A curious superstition grew up locally that it was not Clare's body
1349,JOHN CLARE,which was buried in that coffin: and among those who attended the last
1350,JOHN CLARE,"rite, not one but found it almost impossible to connect this episode"
1351,JOHN CLARE,"with those days forty years before, when so many a notable man"
1352,JOHN CLARE,was seen making through Helpston village for the cottage of the
1353,JOHN CLARE,"eager-eyed, brilliant, unwearying young poet who was the talk of"
1354,JOHN CLARE,"London. After such a long silence and oblivion, even the mention"
1355,JOHN CLARE,of John Clare's name in his native village awoke odd feelings of
1356,JOHN CLARE,unreality.
1357,JOHN CLARE,
1358,JOHN CLARE,"The poetry of John Clare, originally simple description of the country"
1359,JOHN CLARE,"and countrymen, or ungainly imitation of the poetic tradition as he"
1360,JOHN CLARE,"knew it through Allan Ramsay, Burns, and the popular writers of the"
1361,JOHN CLARE,"eighteenth century, developed into a capacity for exact and complete"
1362,JOHN CLARE,nature-poetry and for self-expression. Thoroughly awake to all the
1363,JOHN CLARE,"finest influences in life and in literature, he devoted himself to"
1364,JOHN CLARE,"poetry in every way. Imagination, colour, melody and affection were"
1365,JOHN CLARE,"his by nature; where he lacked was in dramatic impulse and in passion,"
1366,JOHN CLARE,"and sometimes his incredible facility in verse, which enabled him to"
1367,JOHN CLARE,"complete poem after poem without pause or verbal difficulty, was not"
1368,JOHN CLARE,his best friend. He possesses a technique of his own; his rhymes are
1369,JOHN CLARE,"based on pronunciation, the Northamptonshire pronunciation to which"
1370,JOHN CLARE,"his ear had been trained, and thus he accurately joins ""stoop"" and"
1371,JOHN CLARE,"""up,"" or ""horse"" and ""cross""--while his sonnets are free and often"
1372,JOHN CLARE,"unique in form. In spite of his individual manner, there is no poet"
1373,JOHN CLARE,who in his nature-poetry so completely subdues self and mood and deals
1374,JOHN CLARE,with the topic for its own sake. That he is by no means enslaved to
1375,JOHN CLARE,"nature-poetry, the variety of the poems in this selection must show."
1376,JOHN CLARE,
1377,JOHN CLARE,His Asylum Poems are distinct from most of the earlier work. They are
1378,JOHN CLARE,"often the expressions of his love tragedy, yet strange to say they"
1379,JOHN CLARE,"are not often sad or bitter: imagination conquers, and the tragedy"
1380,JOHN CLARE,"vanishes. They are rhythmically new, the movement having changed from"
1381,JOHN CLARE,that of quiet reflection to one of lyrical enthusiasm: even nature
1382,JOHN CLARE,is now seen in brighter colours and sung in subtler music. Old age
1383,JOHN CLARE,bringing ever intenser recollection and childlike vision found Clare
1384,JOHN CLARE,writing the light lovely songs which bear no slightest sign of the
1385,JOHN CLARE,cruel years. So near in these later poems are sorrow and joy that they
1386,JOHN CLARE,awaken deeper feelings and instincts than almost any other lyrics
1387,JOHN CLARE,"can--emotions such as he shares with us in his ""Adieu!"":"
1388,JOHN CLARE,
1389,JOHN CLARE,I left the little birds
1390,JOHN CLARE,"And sweet lowing of the herds,"
1391,JOHN CLARE,"And couldn't find out words,"
1392,JOHN CLARE,"Do you see,"
1393,JOHN CLARE,"To say to them good-bye,"
1394,JOHN CLARE,Where the yellowcups do lie;
1395,JOHN CLARE,"So heaving a deep sigh,"
1396,JOHN CLARE,Took to sea....
1397,JOHN CLARE,
1398,JOHN CLARE,"In this sort of pathos, so indefinable and intimate, William Blake and"
1399,JOHN CLARE,only he can be said to resemble him.

1580,EARLY POEMS,
1581,EARLY POEMS,"A faithless shepherd courted me,"
1582,EARLY POEMS,He stole away my liberty.
1583,EARLY POEMS,"When my poor heart was strange to men,"
1584,EARLY POEMS,He came and smiled and stole it then.
1585,EARLY POEMS,
1586,EARLY POEMS,"When my apron would hang low,"
1587,EARLY POEMS,Me he sought through frost and snow.
1588,EARLY POEMS,"When it puckered up with shame,"
1589,EARLY POEMS,"And I sought him, he never came."
1590,EARLY POEMS,
1591,EARLY POEMS,"When summer brought no fears to fright,"
1592,EARLY POEMS,He came to guard me every night.
1593,EARLY POEMS,"When winter nights did darkly prove,"
1594,EARLY POEMS,None came to guard me or to love.
1595,EARLY POEMS,
1596,EARLY POEMS,"I wish, I wish, but all in vain,"
1597,EARLY POEMS,I wish I was a maid again.
1598,EARLY POEMS,"A maid again I cannot be,"
1599,EARLY POEMS,O when will green grass cover me?
1600,EARLY POEMS,
1601,EARLY POEMS,
1602,EARLY POEMS,_Song_
1603,EARLY POEMS,
1604,EARLY POEMS,"Mary, leave thy lowly cot"
1605,EARLY POEMS,When thy thickest jobs are done;
1606,EARLY POEMS,"When thy friends will miss thee not,"
1607,EARLY POEMS,"Mary, to the pastures run."
1608,EARLY POEMS,Where we met the other night
1609,EARLY POEMS,"Neath the bush upon the plain,"
1610,EARLY POEMS,"Be it dark or be it light,"
1611,EARLY POEMS,Ye may guess we'll meet again.
1612,EARLY POEMS,
1613,EARLY POEMS,"Should ye go or should ye not,"
1614,EARLY POEMS,"Never shilly-shally, dear."
1615,EARLY POEMS,"Leave your work and leave your cot,"
1616,EARLY POEMS,Nothing need ye doubt or fear:
1617,EARLY POEMS,"Fools may tell ye lies in spite,"
1618,EARLY POEMS,Calling me a roving swain;
1619,EARLY POEMS,Think what passed the other night--
1620,EARLY POEMS,I'll be bound ye'll meet again.
1621,EARLY POEMS,
1622,EARLY POEMS,
1623,EARLY POEMS,_Summer Evening_
1624,EARLY POEMS,
1625,EARLY POEMS,"The sinking sun is taking leave,"
1626,EARLY POEMS,"And sweetly gilds the edge of Eve,"
1627,EARLY POEMS,While huddling clouds of purple dye
1628,EARLY POEMS,Gloomy hang the western sky.
1629,EARLY POEMS,"Crows crowd croaking over head,"
1630,EARLY POEMS,Hastening to the woods to bed.
1631,EARLY POEMS,"Cooing sits the lonely dove,"
1632,EARLY POEMS,Calling home her absent love.
1633,EARLY POEMS,"With ""Kirchup! Kirchup!"" mong the wheats"
1634,EARLY POEMS,Partridge distant partridge greets;
1635,EARLY POEMS,"Beckoning hints to those that roam,"
1636,EARLY POEMS,That guide the squandered covey home.
1637,EARLY POEMS,"Swallows check their winding flight,"
1638,EARLY POEMS,And twittering on the chimney light.
1639,EARLY POEMS,"Round the pond the martins flirt,"
1640,EARLY POEMS,"Their snowy breasts bedaubed with dirt,"
1641,EARLY POEMS,"While the mason, neath the slates,"
1642,EARLY POEMS,Each mortar-bearing bird awaits:
1643,EARLY POEMS,"By art untaught, each labouring spouse"
1644,EARLY POEMS,Curious daubs his hanging house.
1645,EARLY POEMS,
1646,EARLY POEMS,Bats flit by in hood and cowl;
1647,EARLY POEMS,Through the barn-hole pops the owl;
1648,EARLY POEMS,"From the hedge, in drowsy hum,"
1649,EARLY POEMS,"Heedless buzzing beetles bum,"
1650,EARLY POEMS,"Haunting every bushy place,"
1651,EARLY POEMS,Flopping in the labourer's face.
1652,EARLY POEMS,Now the snail hath made its ring;
1653,EARLY POEMS,And the moth with snowy wing
1654,EARLY POEMS,"Circles round in winding whirls,"
1655,EARLY POEMS,"Through sweet evening's sprinkled pearls,"
1656,EARLY POEMS,On each nodding rush besprent;
1657,EARLY POEMS,Dancing on from bent to bent;
1658,EARLY POEMS,"Now to downy grasses clung,"
1659,EARLY POEMS,Resting for a while he's hung;
1660,EARLY POEMS,"Then, to ferry oer the stream,"
1661,EARLY POEMS,Vanishing as flies a dream;
1662,EARLY POEMS,"Playful still his hours to keep,"
1663,EARLY POEMS,Till his time has come to sleep;
1664,EARLY POEMS,
1665,EARLY POEMS,"In tall grass, by fountain head,"
1666,EARLY POEMS,Weary then he drops to bed.
1667,EARLY POEMS,"From the hay-cock's moistened heaps,"
1668,EARLY POEMS,Startled frogs take vaunting leaps;
1669,EARLY POEMS,"And along the shaven mead,"
1670,EARLY POEMS,"Jumping travellers, they proceed:"
1671,EARLY POEMS,"Quick the dewy grass divides,"
1672,EARLY POEMS,Moistening sweet their speckled sides;
1673,EARLY POEMS,"From the grass or flowret's cup,"
1674,EARLY POEMS,Quick the dew-drop bounces up.
1675,EARLY POEMS,"Now the blue fog creeps along,"
1676,EARLY POEMS,And the bird's forgot his song:
1677,EARLY POEMS,Flowers now sleep within their hoods;
1678,EARLY POEMS,Daisies button into buds;
1679,EARLY POEMS,From soiling dew the butter-cup
1680,EARLY POEMS,Shuts his golden jewels up;
1681,EARLY POEMS,And the rose and woodbine they
1682,EARLY POEMS,Wait again the smiles of day.
1683,EARLY POEMS,"Neath the willow's wavy boughs,"
1684,EARLY POEMS,"Dolly, singing, milks her cows;"
1685,EARLY POEMS,"While the brook, as bubbling by,"
1686,EARLY POEMS,Joins in murmuring melody.
1687,EARLY POEMS,"Dick and Dob, with jostling joll,"
1688,EARLY POEMS,Homeward drag the rumbling roll;
1689,EARLY POEMS,"Whilom Ralph, for Doll to wait,"
1690,EARLY POEMS,Lolls him o'er the pasture gate.
1691,EARLY POEMS,Swains to fold their sheep begin;
1692,EARLY POEMS,Dogs loud barking drive them in.
1693,EARLY POEMS,Hedgers now along the road
1694,EARLY POEMS,Homeward bend beneath their load;
1695,EARLY POEMS,"And from the long furrowed seams,"
1696,EARLY POEMS,Ploughmen loose their weary teams:
1697,EARLY POEMS,"Ball, with urging lashes wealed,"
1698,EARLY POEMS,"Still so slow to drive a-field,"
1699,EARLY POEMS,"Eager blundering from the plough,"
1700,EARLY POEMS,Wants no whip to drive him now;
1701,EARLY POEMS,"At the stable-door he stands,"
1702,EARLY POEMS,Looking round for friendly hands
1703,EARLY POEMS,
1704,EARLY POEMS,"To loose the door its fastening pin,"
1705,EARLY POEMS,And let him with his corn begin.
1706,EARLY POEMS,"Round the yard, a thousand ways,"
1707,EARLY POEMS,"Beasts in expectation gaze,"
1708,EARLY POEMS,Catching at the loads of hay
1709,EARLY POEMS,Passing fodderers tug away.
1710,EARLY POEMS,"Hogs with grumbling, deafening noise,"
1711,EARLY POEMS,Bother round the server boys;
1712,EARLY POEMS,"And, far and near, the motley group"
1713,EARLY POEMS,Anxious claim their suppering-up.
1714,EARLY POEMS,
1715,EARLY POEMS,"From the rest, a blest release,"
1716,EARLY POEMS,"Gabbling home, the quarreling geese"
1717,EARLY POEMS,"Seek their warm straw-littered shed,"
1718,EARLY POEMS,"And, waddling, prate away to bed."
1719,EARLY POEMS,"Nighted by unseen delay,"
1720,EARLY POEMS,"Poking hens, that lose their way,"
1721,EARLY POEMS,"On the hovel's rafters rise,"
1722,EARLY POEMS,"Slumbering there, the fox's prize."
1723,EARLY POEMS,"Now the cat has ta'en her seat,"
1724,EARLY POEMS,With her tail curled round her feet;
1725,EARLY POEMS,Patiently she sits to watch
1726,EARLY POEMS,Sparrows fighting on the thatch.
1727,EARLY POEMS,"Now Doll brings the expected pails,"
1728,EARLY POEMS,And dogs begin to wag their tails;
1729,EARLY POEMS,"With strokes and pats they're welcomed in,"
1730,EARLY POEMS,And they with looking wants begin;
1731,EARLY POEMS,"Slove in the milk-pail brimming o'er,"
1732,EARLY POEMS,She pops their dish behind the door.
1733,EARLY POEMS,"Prone to mischief boys are met,"
1734,EARLY POEMS,"Neath the eaves the ladder's set,"
1735,EARLY POEMS,"Sly they climb in softest tread,"
1736,EARLY POEMS,To catch the sparrow on his bed;
1737,EARLY POEMS,"Massacred, O cruel pride!"
1738,EARLY POEMS,Dashed against the ladder's side.
1739,EARLY POEMS,Curst barbarians! pass me by;
1740,EARLY POEMS,"Come not, Turks, my cottage nigh;"
1741,EARLY POEMS,"Sure my sparrows are my own,"
1742,EARLY POEMS,Let ye then my birds alone.
1743,EARLY POEMS,
1744,EARLY POEMS,"Come, poor birds, from foes severe"
1745,EARLY POEMS,"Fearless come, you're welcome here;"
1746,EARLY POEMS,"My heart yearns at fate like yours,"
1747,EARLY POEMS,A sparrow's life's as sweet as ours.
1748,EARLY POEMS,Hardy clowns! grudge not the wheat
1749,EARLY POEMS,Which hunger forces birds to eat:
1750,EARLY POEMS,"Your blinded eyes, worst foes to you,"
1751,EARLY POEMS,Can't see the good which sparrows do.
1752,EARLY POEMS,Did not poor birds with watching rounds
1753,EARLY POEMS,"Pick up the insects from your grounds,"
1754,EARLY POEMS,"Did they not tend your rising grain,"
1755,EARLY POEMS,You then might sow to reap in vain.
1756,EARLY POEMS,"Thus Providence, right understood,"
1757,EARLY POEMS,"Whose end and aim is doing good,"
1758,EARLY POEMS,Sends nothing here without its use;
1759,EARLY POEMS,"Though ignorance loads it with abuse,"
1760,EARLY POEMS,"And fools despise the blessing sent,"
1761,EARLY POEMS,And mock the Giver's good intent.--
1762,EARLY POEMS,"O God, let me what's good pursue,"
1763,EARLY POEMS,Let me the same to others do
1764,EARLY POEMS,"As I'd have others do to me,"

1766,EARLY POEMS,
1767,EARLY POEMS,Dark and darker glooms the sky;
1768,EARLY POEMS,Sleep gins close the labourer's eye:
1769,EARLY POEMS,"Dobson leaves his greensward seat,"
1770,EARLY POEMS,Neighbours where they neighbours meet
1771,EARLY POEMS,"Crops to praise, and work in hand,"
1772,EARLY POEMS,And battles tell from foreign land.
1773,EARLY POEMS,"While his pipe is puffing out,"
1774,EARLY POEMS,"Sue he's putting to the rout,"
1775,EARLY POEMS,"Gossiping, who takes delight"
1776,EARLY POEMS,"To shool her knitting out at night,"
1777,EARLY POEMS,And back-bite neighbours bout the town--
1778,EARLY POEMS,"Who's got new caps, and who a gown,"
1779,EARLY POEMS,"And many a thing, her evil eye"
1780,EARLY POEMS,Can see they don't come honest by.
1781,EARLY POEMS,"Chattering at a neighbour's house,"
1782,EARLY POEMS,She hears call out her frowning spouse;
1783,EARLY POEMS,"Prepared to start, she soodles home,"
1784,EARLY POEMS,"Her knitting twisting oer her thumb,"
1785,EARLY POEMS,"As, both to leave, afraid to stay,"
1786,EARLY POEMS,She bawls her story all the way;
1787,EARLY POEMS,"The tale so fraught with 'ticing charms,"
1788,EARLY POEMS,Her apron folded oer her arms.
1789,EARLY POEMS,"She leaves the unfinished tale, in pain,"
1790,EARLY POEMS,To end as evening comes again:
1791,EARLY POEMS,"And in the cottage gangs with dread,"
1792,EARLY POEMS,"To meet old Dobson's timely frown,"
1793,EARLY POEMS,"Who grumbling sits, prepared for bed,"
1794,EARLY POEMS,While she stands chelping bout the town.
1795,EARLY POEMS,
1796,EARLY POEMS,"The night-wind now, with sooty wings,"
1797,EARLY POEMS,In the cotter's chimney sings;
1798,EARLY POEMS,"Now, as stretching oer the bed,"
1799,EARLY POEMS,"Soft I raise my drowsy head,"
1800,EARLY POEMS,"Listening to the ushering charms,"
1801,EARLY POEMS,That shake the elm tree's mossy arms:
1802,EARLY POEMS,"Till sweet slumbers stronger creep,"
1803,EARLY POEMS,"Deeper darkness stealing round,"
1804,EARLY POEMS,"Then, as rocked, I sink to sleep,"
1805,EARLY POEMS,Mid the wild wind's lulling sound.
1806,EARLY POEMS,
1807,EARLY POEMS,
1808,EARLY POEMS,_What is Life?_
1809,EARLY POEMS,
1810,EARLY POEMS,"And what is Life?--An hour-glass on the run,"
1811,EARLY POEMS,"A mist retreating from the morning sun,"
1812,EARLY POEMS,"A busy, bustling, still repeated dream;"
1813,EARLY POEMS,"Its length?--A minute's pause, a moment's thought;"
1814,EARLY POEMS,"And happiness?-A bubble on the stream,"
1815,EARLY POEMS,That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought.
1816,EARLY POEMS,
1817,EARLY POEMS,"What are vain Hopes?--The puffing gale of morn,"
1818,EARLY POEMS,"That of its charms divests the dewy lawn,"
1819,EARLY POEMS,"And robs each floweret of its gem,--and dies;"
1820,EARLY POEMS,"A cobweb hiding disappointment's thorn,"
1821,EARLY POEMS,Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise.
1822,EARLY POEMS,
1823,EARLY POEMS,"And thou, O Trouble?--Nothing can suppose,"
1824,EARLY POEMS,"(And sure the power of wisdom only knows,)"
1825,EARLY POEMS,What need requireth thee:
1826,EARLY POEMS,"So free and liberal as thy bounty flows,"
1827,EARLY POEMS,Some necessary cause must surely be;
1828,EARLY POEMS,"But disappointments, pains, and every woe"
1829,EARLY POEMS,"Devoted wretches feel,"
1830,EARLY POEMS,"The universal plagues of life below,"
1831,EARLY POEMS,Are mysteries still neath Fate's unbroken seal.
1832,EARLY POEMS,
1833,EARLY POEMS,And what is Death? is still the cause unfound?
1834,EARLY POEMS,"That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?"
1835,EARLY POEMS,"A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave."
1836,EARLY POEMS,And Peace? where can its happiness abound?--
1837,EARLY POEMS,"No where at all, save heaven, and the grave."
1838,EARLY POEMS,
1839,EARLY POEMS,"Then what is Life?--When stripped of its disguise,"
1840,EARLY POEMS,A thing to be desired it cannot be;
1841,EARLY POEMS,Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes
1842,EARLY POEMS,Gives proof sufficient of its vanity.
1843,EARLY POEMS,Tis but a trial all must undergo;
1844,EARLY POEMS,To teach unthankful mortals how to prize
1845,EARLY POEMS,"That happiness vain man's denied to know,"
1846,EARLY POEMS,Until he's called to claim it in the skies.

1848,EARLY POEMS,
1849,EARLY POEMS,"_The Maid Of Ocram or, Lord Gregory_"
1850,EARLY POEMS,
1851,EARLY POEMS,Gay was the Maid of Ocram
1852,EARLY POEMS,As lady eer might be
1853,EARLY POEMS,Ere she did venture past a maid
1854,EARLY POEMS,To love Lord Gregory.
1855,EARLY POEMS,Fair was the Maid of Ocram
1856,EARLY POEMS,And shining like the sun
1857,EARLY POEMS,Ere her bower key was turned on two
1858,EARLY POEMS,Where bride bed lay for none.
1859,EARLY POEMS,
1860,EARLY POEMS,And late at night she sought her love--
1861,EARLY POEMS,The snow slept on her skin--
1862,EARLY POEMS,"Get up, she cried, thou false young man,"
1863,EARLY POEMS,And let thy true love in.
1864,EARLY POEMS,And fain would he have loosed the key
1865,EARLY POEMS,"All for his true love's sake,"
1866,EARLY POEMS,"But Lord Gregory then was fast asleep,"
1867,EARLY POEMS,His mother wide awake.
1868,EARLY POEMS,
1869,EARLY POEMS,"And up she threw the window sash,"
1870,EARLY POEMS,And out her head put she:
1871,EARLY POEMS,And who is that which knocks so late
1872,EARLY POEMS,And taunts so loud to me?
1873,EARLY POEMS,"It is the Maid of Ocram,"
1874,EARLY POEMS,Your own heart's next akin;
1875,EARLY POEMS,"For so you've sworn, Lord Gregory,"
1876,EARLY POEMS,To come and let me in.
1877,EARLY POEMS,
1878,EARLY POEMS,"O pause not thus, you know me well,"
1879,EARLY POEMS,Haste down my way to win.
1880,EARLY POEMS,"The wind disturbs my yellow locks,"
1881,EARLY POEMS,The snow sleeps on my skin.--
1882,EARLY POEMS,"If you be the Maid of Ocram,"
1883,EARLY POEMS,"As much I doubt you be,"
1884,EARLY POEMS,Then tell me of three tokens
1885,EARLY POEMS,That passed with you and me.--
1886,EARLY POEMS,
1887,EARLY POEMS,O talk not now of tokens
1888,EARLY POEMS,Which you do wish to break;
1889,EARLY POEMS,"Chilled are those lips you've kissed so warm,"
1890,EARLY POEMS,And all too numbed to speak.
1891,EARLY POEMS,You know when in my father's bower
1892,EARLY POEMS,"You left your cloak for mine,"
1893,EARLY POEMS,Though yours was nought but silver twist
1894,EARLY POEMS,And mine the golden twine.--
1895,EARLY POEMS,
1896,EARLY POEMS,"If you're the lass of Ocram,"
1897,EARLY POEMS,"As I take you not to be,"
1898,EARLY POEMS,The second token you must tell
1899,EARLY POEMS,Which past with you and me.--
1900,EARLY POEMS,"O know you not, O know you not"
1901,EARLY POEMS,"Twas in my father's park,"
1902,EARLY POEMS,You led me out a mile too far
1903,EARLY POEMS,And courted in the dark?
1904,EARLY POEMS,
1905,EARLY POEMS,When you did change your ring for mine
1906,EARLY POEMS,"My yielding heart to win,"
1907,EARLY POEMS,Though mine was of the beaten gold
1908,EARLY POEMS,"Yours but of burnished tin,"
1909,EARLY POEMS,"Though mine was all true love without,"
1910,EARLY POEMS,Yours but false love within?
1911,EARLY POEMS,
1912,EARLY POEMS,O ask me no more tokens
1913,EARLY POEMS,For fast the snow doth fall.
1914,EARLY POEMS,"Tis sad to strive and speak in vain,"
1915,EARLY POEMS,You mean to break them all.--
1916,EARLY POEMS,"If you are the Maid of Ocram,"
1917,EARLY POEMS,"As I take you not to be,"
1918,EARLY POEMS,You must mention the third token
1919,EARLY POEMS,That passed with you and me.--
1920,EARLY POEMS,
1921,EARLY POEMS,Twas when you stole my maidenhead;
1922,EARLY POEMS,That grieves me worst of all.--
1923,EARLY POEMS,"Begone, you lying creature, then"
1924,EARLY POEMS,"This instant from my hall,"
1925,EARLY POEMS,Or you and your vile baby
1926,EARLY POEMS,Shall in the deep sea fall;
1927,EARLY POEMS,For I have none on earth as yet
1928,EARLY POEMS,That may me father call.--
1929,EARLY POEMS,
1930,EARLY POEMS,"O must none close my dying feet,"
1931,EARLY POEMS,"And must none close my hands,"
1932,EARLY POEMS,And may none bind my yellow locks
1933,EARLY POEMS,As death for all demands?
1934,EARLY POEMS,"You need not use no force at all,"
1935,EARLY POEMS,Your hard heart breaks the vow;
1936,EARLY POEMS,You've had your wish against my will
1937,EARLY POEMS,And you shall have it now.
1938,EARLY POEMS,
1939,EARLY POEMS,"And must none close my dying feet,"
1940,EARLY POEMS,"And must none close my hands,"
1941,EARLY POEMS,And will none do the last kind deeds
1942,EARLY POEMS,That death for all demands?--
1943,EARLY POEMS,"Your sister, she may close your feet,"
1944,EARLY POEMS,"Your brother close your hands,"
1945,EARLY POEMS,"Your mother, she may wrap your waist"
1946,EARLY POEMS,In death's fit wedding bands;
1947,EARLY POEMS,"Your father, he may tie your locks"
1948,EARLY POEMS,And lay you in the sands.--
1949,EARLY POEMS,
1950,EARLY POEMS,"My sister, she will weep in vain,"
1951,EARLY POEMS,"My brother ride and run,"
1952,EARLY POEMS,"My mother, she will break her heart;"
1953,EARLY POEMS,And ere the rising sun
1954,EARLY POEMS,My father will be looking out--
1955,EARLY POEMS,But find me they will none.
1956,EARLY POEMS,"I go to lay my woes to rest,"
1957,EARLY POEMS,None shall know where I'm gone.
1958,EARLY POEMS,"God must be friend and father both,"
1959,EARLY POEMS,Lord Gregory will be none.--
1960,EARLY POEMS,
1961,EARLY POEMS,Lord Gregory started up from sleep
1962,EARLY POEMS,And thought he heard a voice
1963,EARLY POEMS,"That screamed full dreadful in his ear,"
1964,EARLY POEMS,And once and twice and thrice.
1965,EARLY POEMS,Lord Gregory to his mother called:
1966,EARLY POEMS,"O mother dear, said he,"
1967,EARLY POEMS,I've dreamt the Maid of Ocram
1968,EARLY POEMS,Was floating on the sea.
1969,EARLY POEMS,
1970,EARLY POEMS,"Lie still, my son, the mother said,"
1971,EARLY POEMS,Tis but a little space
1972,EARLY POEMS,And half an hour has scarcely passed
1973,EARLY POEMS,Since she did pass this place.--
1974,EARLY POEMS,"O cruel, cruel mother,"
1975,EARLY POEMS,When she did pass so nigh
1976,EARLY POEMS,How could you let me sleep so sound
1977,EARLY POEMS,Or let her wander bye?
1978,EARLY POEMS,Now if she's lost my heart must break--
1979,EARLY POEMS,I'll seek her till I die.
1980,EARLY POEMS,
1981,EARLY POEMS,"He sought her east, he sought her west,"
1982,EARLY POEMS,He sought through park and plain;
1983,EARLY POEMS,He sought her where she might have been
1984,EARLY POEMS,But found her not again.
1985,EARLY POEMS,"I cannot curse thee, mother,"
1986,EARLY POEMS,"Though thine's the blame, said he"
1987,EARLY POEMS,"I cannot curse thee, mother,"
1988,EARLY POEMS,Though thou'st done worse to me.
1989,EARLY POEMS,Yet do I curse thy pride that aye
1990,EARLY POEMS,So tauntingly aspires;
1991,EARLY POEMS,"For my love was a gay knight's heir,"
1992,EARLY POEMS,And my father was a squire's.
1993,EARLY POEMS,
1994,EARLY POEMS,And I will sell my park and hall;
1995,EARLY POEMS,And if ye wed again
1996,EARLY POEMS,Ye shall not wed for titles twice
1997,EARLY POEMS,That made ye once so vain.
1998,EARLY POEMS,"So if ye will wed, wed for love,"
1999,EARLY POEMS,As I was fain to do;
2000,EARLY POEMS,"Ye've gave to me a broken heart,"
2001,EARLY POEMS,And I'll give nought to you.
2002,EARLY POEMS,
2003,EARLY POEMS,Your pride has wronged your own heart's blood;
2004,EARLY POEMS,"For she was mine by grace,"
2005,EARLY POEMS,And now my lady love is gone
2006,EARLY POEMS,None else shall take her place.
2007,EARLY POEMS,I'll sell my park and sell my hall
2008,EARLY POEMS,And sink my titles too.
2009,EARLY POEMS,Your pride's done wrong enough as now
2010,EARLY POEMS,To leave it more to do.
2011,EARLY POEMS,
2012,EARLY POEMS,She owneth none that owned them all
2013,EARLY POEMS,And would have graced them well;
2014,EARLY POEMS,None else shall take the right she missed
2015,EARLY POEMS,Nor in my bosom dwell.--
2016,EARLY POEMS,And then he took and burnt his will
2017,EARLY POEMS,"Before his mother's face,"
2018,EARLY POEMS,"And tore his patents all in two,"
2019,EARLY POEMS,While tears fell down apace--
2020,EARLY POEMS,But in his mother's haughty look
2021,EARLY POEMS,Ye nought but frowns might trace.
2022,EARLY POEMS,
2023,EARLY POEMS,"And then he sat him down to grieve,"
2024,EARLY POEMS,But could not sit for pain.
2025,EARLY POEMS,And then he laid him on the bed
2026,EARLY POEMS,And ne'er got up again.

2030,EARLY POEMS,
2031,EARLY POEMS,"How oft on Sundays, when I'd time to tramp,"
2032,EARLY POEMS,"My rambles led me to a gipsy's camp,"
2033,EARLY POEMS,"Where the real effigy of midnight hags,"
2034,EARLY POEMS,"With tawny smoked flesh and tattered rags,"
2035,EARLY POEMS,"Uncouth-brimmed hat, and weather-beaten cloak,"
2036,EARLY POEMS,"Neath the wild shelter of a knotty oak,"
2037,EARLY POEMS,Along the greensward uniformly pricks
2038,EARLY POEMS,Her pliant bending hazel's arching sticks:
2039,EARLY POEMS,"While round-topt bush, or briar-entangled hedge,"
2040,EARLY POEMS,"Where flag-leaves spring beneath, or ramping sedge,"
2041,EARLY POEMS,"Keeps off the bothering bustle of the wind,"
2042,EARLY POEMS,And give the best retreat she hopes to find.
2043,EARLY POEMS,"How oft I've bent me oer her fire and smoke,"
2044,EARLY POEMS,"To hear her gibberish tale so quaintly spoke,"
2045,EARLY POEMS,"While the old Sybil forged her boding clack,"
2046,EARLY POEMS,Twin imps the meanwhile bawling at her back;
2047,EARLY POEMS,"Oft on my hand her magic coin's been struck,"
2048,EARLY POEMS,"And hoping chink, she talked of morts of luck:"
2049,EARLY POEMS,"And still, as boyish hopes did first agree,"
2050,EARLY POEMS,"Mingled with fears to drop the fortune's fee,"
2051,EARLY POEMS,"I never failed to gain the honours sought,"
2052,EARLY POEMS,And Squire and Lord were purchased with a groat.
2053,EARLY POEMS,"But as man's unbelieving taste came round,"
2054,EARLY POEMS,"She furious stampt her shoeless foot aground,"
2055,EARLY POEMS,"Wiped bye her soot-black hair with clenching fist,"
2056,EARLY POEMS,"While through her yellow teeth the spittle hist,"
2057,EARLY POEMS,"Swearing by all her lucky powers of fate,"
2058,EARLY POEMS,"Which like as footboys on her actions wait,"
2059,EARLY POEMS,"That fortune's scale should to my sorrow turn,"
2060,EARLY POEMS,And I one day the rash neglect should mourn;
2061,EARLY POEMS,"That good to bad should change, and I should be"
2062,EARLY POEMS,Lost to this world and all eternity;
2063,EARLY POEMS,That poor as Job I should remain unblest:--
2064,EARLY POEMS,"(Alas, for fourpence how my die is cast!)"
2065,EARLY POEMS,"Of not a hoarded farthing be possesst,"

2075,EARLY POEMS,"Folks tell me that the May's in flower,"

2078,EARLY POEMS,"To get this little basket full."""
2079,EARLY POEMS,
2080,EARLY POEMS,--And thou'st got leave to spend an hour!
2081,EARLY POEMS,My heart repeated.--She was gone;
2082,EARLY POEMS,"--And thou hast heard the thorn's in flower,"
2083,EARLY POEMS,And childhood's bliss is urging on:
2084,EARLY POEMS,"Ah, happy child! thou mak'st me sigh,"

2111,EARLY POEMS,
2112,EARLY POEMS,"So fare ye well! and hold your tongues,"

2147,EARLY POEMS,Ere yet the sun unveils his smiles to view
2148,EARLY POEMS,"And dries the morning's chilly robes of dew,"
2149,EARLY POEMS,"Young Hodge the horse-boy, with a soodly gait,"
2150,EARLY POEMS,"Slow climbs the stile, or opes the creaky gate,"
2151,EARLY POEMS,With willow switch and halter by his side
2152,EARLY POEMS,"Prepared for Dobbin, whom he means to ride;"
2153,EARLY POEMS,"The only tune he knows still whistling oer,"
2154,EARLY POEMS,"And humming scraps his father sung before,"
2155,EARLY POEMS,"As ""Wantley Dragon,"" and the ""Magic Rose,"""
2156,EARLY POEMS,"The whole of music that his village knows,"
2157,EARLY POEMS,"Which wild remembrance, in each little town,"
2158,EARLY POEMS,From mouth to mouth through ages handles down.
2159,EARLY POEMS,"Onward he jolls, nor can the minstrel-throngs"
2160,EARLY POEMS,Entice him once to listen to their songs;
2161,EARLY POEMS,Nor marks he once a blossom on his way;
2162,EARLY POEMS,A senseless lump of animated clay--
2163,EARLY POEMS,"With weather-beaten hat of rusty brown,"
2164,EARLY POEMS,"Stranger to brinks, and often to a crown;"
2165,EARLY POEMS,"With slop-frock suiting to the ploughman's taste,"
2166,EARLY POEMS,Its greasy skirtings twisted round his waist;
2167,EARLY POEMS,"And hardened high-lows clenched with nails around,"
2168,EARLY POEMS,"Clamping defiance oer the stoney ground,"
2169,EARLY POEMS,The deadly foes to many a blossomed sprout
2170,EARLY POEMS,That luckless meets him in his morning's rout.
2171,EARLY POEMS,"In hobbling speed he roams the pasture round,"
2172,EARLY POEMS,Till hunted Dobbin and the rest are found;
2173,EARLY POEMS,"Where some, from frequent meddlings of his whip,"
2174,EARLY POEMS,"Well know their foe, and often try to slip;"
2175,EARLY POEMS,"While Dobbin, tamed by age and labour, stands"
2176,EARLY POEMS,"To meet all trouble from his brutish hands,"
2177,EARLY POEMS,"And patient goes to gate or knowly brake,"
2178,EARLY POEMS,The teasing burden of his foe to take;
2179,EARLY POEMS,"Who, soon as mounted, with his switching weals,"
2180,EARLY POEMS,"Puts Dob's best swiftness in his heavy heels,"
2181,EARLY POEMS,The toltering bustle of a blundering trot
2182,EARLY POEMS,"Which whips and cudgels neer increased a jot,"
2183,EARLY POEMS,Though better speed was urged by the clown--
2184,EARLY POEMS,And thus he snorts and jostles to the town.
2185,EARLY POEMS,
2186,EARLY POEMS,"And now, when toil and summer's in its prime,"
2187,EARLY POEMS,"In every vill, at morning's earliest time,"
2188,EARLY POEMS,"To early-risers many a Hodge is seen,"
2189,EARLY POEMS,And many a Dob's heard clattering oer the green.
2190,EARLY POEMS,
2191,EARLY POEMS,Now straying beams from day's unclosing eye
2192,EARLY POEMS,"In copper-coloured patches flush the sky,"
2193,EARLY POEMS,"And from night's prison strugglingly encroach,"
2194,EARLY POEMS,"To bring the summons of warm day's approach,"
2195,EARLY POEMS,"Till, slowly mounting oer the ridge of clouds"
2196,EARLY POEMS,"That yet half shows his face, and half enshrouds,"
2197,EARLY POEMS,The unfettered sun takes his unbounded reign
2198,EARLY POEMS,And wakes all life to noise and toil again:
2199,EARLY POEMS,And while his opening mellows oer the scenes
2200,EARLY POEMS,"Of wood and field their many mingling greens,"
2201,EARLY POEMS,Industry's bustling din once more devours
2202,EARLY POEMS,The soothing peace of morning's early hours:
2203,EARLY POEMS,The grunt of hogs freed from their nightly dens
2204,EARLY POEMS,"And constant cacklings of new-laying hens,"
2205,EARLY POEMS,And ducks and geese that clamorous joys repeat
2206,EARLY POEMS,"The splashing comforts of the pond to meet,"
2207,EARLY POEMS,And chirping sparrows dropping from the eaves
2208,EARLY POEMS,"For offal kernels that the poultry leaves,"
2209,EARLY POEMS,Oft signal-calls of danger chittering high
2210,EARLY POEMS,At skulking cats and dogs approaching nigh.
2211,EARLY POEMS,And lowing steers that hollow echoes wake
2212,EARLY POEMS,"Around the yard, their nightly fast to break,"
2213,EARLY POEMS,As from each barn the lumping flail rebounds
2214,EARLY POEMS,In mingling concert with the rural sounds;
2215,EARLY POEMS,While oer the distant fields more faintly creep
2216,EARLY POEMS,"The murmuring bleatings of unfolding sheep,"
2217,EARLY POEMS,And ploughman's callings that more hoarse proceed
2218,EARLY POEMS,"Where industry still urges labour's speed,"
2219,EARLY POEMS,The bellowing of cows with udders full
2220,EARLY POEMS,"That wait the welcome halloo of ""come mull,"""
2221,EARLY POEMS,"And rumbling waggons deafening again,"
2222,EARLY POEMS,"Rousing the dust along the narrow lane,"
2223,EARLY POEMS,"And cracking whips, and shepherd's hooting cries,"
2224,EARLY POEMS,From woodland echoes urging sharp replies.
2225,EARLY POEMS,"Hodge, in his waggon, marks the wondrous tongue,"
2226,EARLY POEMS,And talks with echo as he drives along;
2227,EARLY POEMS,"Still cracks his whip, bawls every horse's name,"
2228,EARLY POEMS,And echo still as ready bawls the same:
2229,EARLY POEMS,"The puzzling mystery he would gladly cheat,"
2230,EARLY POEMS,"And fain would utter what it can't repeat,"
2231,EARLY POEMS,Till speedless trials prove the doubted elf
2232,EARLY POEMS,As skilled in noise and sounds as Hodge himself;
2233,EARLY POEMS,"And, quite convinced with the proofs it gives,"
2234,EARLY POEMS,"The boy drives on and fancies echo lives,"
2235,EARLY POEMS,"Like some wood-fiend that frights benighted men,"
2236,EARLY POEMS,The troubling spirit of a robber's den.
2237,EARLY POEMS,
2238,EARLY POEMS,"And now the blossom of the village view,"
2239,EARLY POEMS,"With airy hat of straw, and apron blue,"
2240,EARLY POEMS,"And short-sleeved gown, that half to guess reveals"
2241,EARLY POEMS,By fine-turned arms what beauty it conceals;
2242,EARLY POEMS,Whose cheeks health flushes with as sweet a red
2243,EARLY POEMS,As that which stripes the woodbine oer her head;
2244,EARLY POEMS,"Deeply she blushes on her morn's employ,"
2245,EARLY POEMS,"To prove the fondness of some passing boy,"
2246,EARLY POEMS,"Who, with a smile that thrills her soul to view,"
2247,EARLY POEMS,"Holds the gate open till she passes through,"
2248,EARLY POEMS,"While turning nods beck thanks for kindness done,"
2249,EARLY POEMS,And looks--if looks could speak-proclaim her won.
2250,EARLY POEMS,"With well-scoured buckets on proceeds the maid,"
2251,EARLY POEMS,"And drives her cows to milk beneath the shade,"
2252,EARLY POEMS,Where scarce a sunbeam to molest her steals--
2253,EARLY POEMS,Sweet as the thyme that blossoms where she kneels;
2254,EARLY POEMS,And there oft scares the cooing amorous dove
2255,EARLY POEMS,With her own favoured melodies of love.
2256,EARLY POEMS,"Snugly retired in yet dew-laden bowers,"
2257,EARLY POEMS,This sweetest specimen of rural flowers
2258,EARLY POEMS,"Displays, red glowing in the morning wind,"
2259,EARLY POEMS,The powers of health and nature when combined.
2260,EARLY POEMS,
2261,EARLY POEMS,"Last on the road the cowboy careless swings,"
2262,EARLY POEMS,"Leading tamed cattle in their tending strings,"
2263,EARLY POEMS,With shining tin to keep his dinner warm
2264,EARLY POEMS,"Swung at his back, or tucked beneath his arm;"
2265,EARLY POEMS,"Whose sun-burnt skin, and cheeks chuffed out with fat,"
2266,EARLY POEMS,Are dyed as rusty as his napless hat.
2267,EARLY POEMS,"And others, driving loose their herds at will,"
2268,EARLY POEMS,Are now heard whooping up the pasture-hill;
2269,EARLY POEMS,"Peeled sticks they bear of hazel or of ash,"
2270,EARLY POEMS,The rib-marked hides of restless cows to thrash.
2271,EARLY POEMS,"In sloven garb appears each bawling boy,"
2272,EARLY POEMS,As fit and suiting to his rude employ;
2273,EARLY POEMS,"His shoes, worn down by many blundering treads,"
2274,EARLY POEMS,Oft show the tenants needing safer sheds:
2275,EARLY POEMS,"The pithy bunch of unripe nuts to seek,"
2276,EARLY POEMS,"And crabs sun-reddened with a tempting cheek,"
2277,EARLY POEMS,"From pasture hedges, daily puts to rack"
2278,EARLY POEMS,"His tattered clothes, that scarcely screen the back,--"
2279,EARLY POEMS,"Daubed all about as if besmeared with blood,"
2280,EARLY POEMS,Stained with the berries of the brambly wood
2281,EARLY POEMS,"That stud the straggling briars as black as jet,"
2282,EARLY POEMS,"Which, when his cattle lair, he runs to get;"
2283,EARLY POEMS,"Or smaller kinds, as if beglossed with dew"
2284,EARLY POEMS,"Shining dim-powdered with a downy blue,"
2285,EARLY POEMS,That on weak tendrils lowly creeping grow
2286,EARLY POEMS,"Where, choaked in flags and sedges, wandering slow,"
2287,EARLY POEMS,The brook purls simmering its declining tide
2288,EARLY POEMS,Down the crooked boundings of the pasture-side.
2289,EARLY POEMS,"There they to hunt the luscious fruit delight,"
2290,EARLY POEMS,And dabbling keep within their charges' sight;
2291,EARLY POEMS,"Oft catching prickly struttles on their rout,"
2292,EARLY POEMS,"And miller-thumbs and gudgeons driving out,"
2293,EARLY POEMS,Hid near the arched brig under many a stone
2294,EARLY POEMS,That from its wall rude passing clowns have thrown.
2295,EARLY POEMS,"And while in peace cows eat, and chew their cuds,"
2296,EARLY POEMS,"Moozing cool sheltered neath the skirting woods,"
2297,EARLY POEMS,"To double uses they the hours convert,"
2298,EARLY POEMS,Turning the toils of labour into sport;
2299,EARLY POEMS,"Till morn's long streaking shadows lose their tails,"
2300,EARLY POEMS,And cooling winds swoon into faultering gales;
2301,EARLY POEMS,"And searching sunbeams warm and sultry creep,"
2302,EARLY POEMS,Waking the teazing insects from their sleep;
2303,EARLY POEMS,And dreaded gadflies with their drowsy hum
2304,EARLY POEMS,"On the burnt wings of mid-day zephyrs come,--"
2305,EARLY POEMS,"Urging each lown to leave his sports in fear,"
2306,EARLY POEMS,To stop his starting cows that dread the fly;
2307,EARLY POEMS,"Droning unwelcome tidings on his ear,"
2308,EARLY POEMS,That the sweet peace of rural morn's gone by.
2309,EARLY POEMS,
2310,EARLY POEMS,
2311,EARLY POEMS,_Song_
2312,EARLY POEMS,
2313,EARLY POEMS,One gloomy eve I roamed about
2314,EARLY POEMS,"Neath Oxey's hazel bowers,"
2315,EARLY POEMS,"While timid hares were darting out,"
2316,EARLY POEMS,To crop the dewy flowers;
2317,EARLY POEMS,"And soothing was the scene to me,"
2318,EARLY POEMS,"Right pleased was my soul,"
2319,EARLY POEMS,My breast was calm as summer's sea
2320,EARLY POEMS,When waves forget to roll.
2321,EARLY POEMS,
2322,EARLY POEMS,"But short was even's placid smile,"
2323,EARLY POEMS,"My startled soul to charm,"
2324,EARLY POEMS,"When Nelly lightly skipt the stile,"
2325,EARLY POEMS,With milk-pail on her arm:
2326,EARLY POEMS,"One careless look on me she flung,"
2327,EARLY POEMS,As bright as parting day;
2328,EARLY POEMS,"And like a hawk from covert sprung,"
2329,EARLY POEMS,It pounced my peace away.
2330,EARLY POEMS,
2331,EARLY POEMS,
2332,EARLY POEMS,"_The Cross Roads; or, The Haymaker's Story_"
2333,EARLY POEMS,
2334,EARLY POEMS,"Stopt by the storm, that long in sullen black"
2335,EARLY POEMS,"From the south-west stained its encroaching track,"
2336,EARLY POEMS,"Haymakers, hustling from the rain to hide,"
2337,EARLY POEMS,Sought the grey willows by the pasture-side;
2338,EARLY POEMS,"And there, while big drops bow the grassy stems,"
2339,EARLY POEMS,"And bleb the withering hay with pearly gems,"
2340,EARLY POEMS,"Dimple the brook, and patter in the leaves,"
2341,EARLY POEMS,The song or tale an hour's restraint relieves.
2342,EARLY POEMS,"And while the old dames gossip at their ease,"
2343,EARLY POEMS,"And pinch the snuff-box empty by degrees,"
2344,EARLY POEMS,"The young ones join in love's delightful themes,"
2345,EARLY POEMS,"Truths told by gipsies, and expounded dreams;"
2346,EARLY POEMS,"And mutter things kept secrets from the rest,"
2347,EARLY POEMS,"As sweethearts' names, and whom they love the best;"
2348,EARLY POEMS,"And dazzling ribbons they delight to show,"
2349,EARLY POEMS,"And last new favours of some veigling beau,"
2350,EARLY POEMS,"Who with such treachery tries their hearts to move,"
2351,EARLY POEMS,"And, like the highest, bribes the maidens' love."
2352,EARLY POEMS,"The old dames, jealous of their whispered praise,"
2353,EARLY POEMS,Throw in their hints of man's deluding ways;
2354,EARLY POEMS,"And one, to give her counsels more effect,"
2355,EARLY POEMS,And by example illustrate the fact
2356,EARLY POEMS,"Of innocence oercome by flattering man,"
2357,EARLY POEMS,"Thrice tapped her box, and pinched, and thus began."
2358,EARLY POEMS,
2359,EARLY POEMS,"""Now wenches listen, and let lovers lie,"
2360,EARLY POEMS,Ye'll hear a story ye may profit by;
2361,EARLY POEMS,"I'm your age treble, with some oddments to't,"
2362,EARLY POEMS,"And right from wrong can tell, if ye'll but do't:"
2363,EARLY POEMS,"Ye need not giggle underneath your hat,"
2364,EARLY POEMS,"Mine's no joke-matter, let me tell you that;"
2365,EARLY POEMS,"So keep ye quiet till my story's told,"
2366,EARLY POEMS,And don't despise your betters cause they're old.
2367,EARLY POEMS,
2368,EARLY POEMS,"""That grave ye've heard of, where the four roads meet,"
2369,EARLY POEMS,"Where walks the spirit in a winding-sheet,"
2370,EARLY POEMS,"Oft seen at night, by strangers passing late,"
2371,EARLY POEMS,"And tarrying neighbours that at market wait,"
2372,EARLY POEMS,"Stalking along as white as driven snow,"
2373,EARLY POEMS,And long as one's shadow when the sun is low;
2374,EARLY POEMS,"The girl that's buried there I knew her well,"
2375,EARLY POEMS,"And her whole history, if ye'll hark, can tell."
2376,EARLY POEMS,"Her name was Jane, and neighbour's children we,"
2377,EARLY POEMS,"And old companions once, as ye may be;"
2378,EARLY POEMS,"And like to you, on Sundays often strolled"
2379,EARLY POEMS,To gipsies' camps to have our fortunes told;
2380,EARLY POEMS,"And oft, God rest her, in the fortune-book"
2381,EARLY POEMS,"Which we at hay-time in our pockets took,"
2382,EARLY POEMS,"Our pins at blindfold on the wheel we stuck,"
2383,EARLY POEMS,When hers would always prick the worst of luck;
2384,EARLY POEMS,"For try, poor thing, as often as she might,"
2385,EARLY POEMS,Her point would always on the blank alight;
2386,EARLY POEMS,"Which plainly shows the fortune one's to have,"
2387,EARLY POEMS,"As such like go unwedded to the grave,--"
2388,EARLY POEMS,"And so it proved.--The next succeeding May,"
2389,EARLY POEMS,"We both to service went from sports and play,"
2390,EARLY POEMS,Though in the village still; as friends and kin
2391,EARLY POEMS,Thought neighbour's service better to begin.
2392,EARLY POEMS,"So out we went:--Jane's place was reckoned good,"
2393,EARLY POEMS,"Though she bout life but little understood,"
2394,EARLY POEMS,"And had a master wild as wild can be,"
2395,EARLY POEMS,And far unfit for such a child as she;
2396,EARLY POEMS,"And soon the whisper went about the town,"
2397,EARLY POEMS,That Jane's good looks procured her many a gown
2398,EARLY POEMS,"From him, whose promise was to every one,"
2399,EARLY POEMS,But whose intention was to wive with none.
2400,EARLY POEMS,"Twas nought to wonder, though begun by guess;"
2401,EARLY POEMS,"For Jane was lovely in her Sunday dress,"
2402,EARLY POEMS,And all expected such a rosy face
2403,EARLY POEMS,Would be her ruin--as was just the case.
2404,EARLY POEMS,"The while the change was easily perceived,"
2405,EARLY POEMS,"Some months went by, ere I the tales believed;"
2406,EARLY POEMS,"For there are people nowadays, Lord knows,"
2407,EARLY POEMS,Will sooner hatch up lies than mend their clothes;
2408,EARLY POEMS,"And when with such-like tattle they begin,"
2409,EARLY POEMS,Don't mind whose character they spoil a pin:
2410,EARLY POEMS,"But passing neighbours often marked them smile,"
2411,EARLY POEMS,And watched him take her milkpail oer a stile;
2412,EARLY POEMS,"And many a time, as wandering closer by,"
2413,EARLY POEMS,From Jenny's bosom met a heavy sigh;
2414,EARLY POEMS,"And often marked her, as discoursing deep,"
2415,EARLY POEMS,"When doubts might rise to give just cause to weep,"
2416,EARLY POEMS,"Smothering their notice, by a wished disguise"
2417,EARLY POEMS,To slive her apron corner to her eyes.
2418,EARLY POEMS,"Such signs were mournful and alarming things,"
2419,EARLY POEMS,And far more weighty than conjecture brings;
2420,EARLY POEMS,"Though foes made double what they heard of all,"
2421,EARLY POEMS,"Swore lies as proofs, and prophesied her fall."
2422,EARLY POEMS,Poor thoughtless wench! it seems but Sunday past
2423,EARLY POEMS,"Since we went out together for the last,"
2424,EARLY POEMS,And plain enough indeed it was to find
2425,EARLY POEMS,She'd something more than common on her mind;
2426,EARLY POEMS,"For she was always fond and full of chat,"
2427,EARLY POEMS,"In passing harmless jokes bout beaus and that,"
2428,EARLY POEMS,"But nothing then was scarcely talked about,"
2429,EARLY POEMS,"And what there was, I even forced it out."
2430,EARLY POEMS,"A gloomy wanness spoiled her rosy cheek,"
2431,EARLY POEMS,And doubts hung there it was not mine to seek;
2432,EARLY POEMS,"She neer so much as mentioned things to come,"
2433,EARLY POEMS,But sighed oer pleasures ere she left her home;
2434,EARLY POEMS,And now and then a mournful smile would raise
2435,EARLY POEMS,"At freaks repeated of our younger days,"
2436,EARLY POEMS,"Which I brought up, while passing spots of ground"
2437,EARLY POEMS,"Where we, when children, ""hurly-burlied"" round,"
2438,EARLY POEMS,"Or ""blindman-buffed"" some morts of hours away--"
2439,EARLY POEMS,"Two games, poor thing, Jane dearly loved to play."
2440,EARLY POEMS,"She smiled at these, but shook her head and sighed"
2441,EARLY POEMS,When eer she thought my look was turned aside;
2442,EARLY POEMS,"Nor turned she round, as was her former way,"
2443,EARLY POEMS,"To praise the thorn, white over then with May;"
2444,EARLY POEMS,"Nor stooped once, though thousands round her grew,"
2445,EARLY POEMS,To pull a cowslip as she used to do:
2446,EARLY POEMS,For Jane in flowers delighted from a child--
2447,EARLY POEMS,"I like the garden, but she loved the wild--"
2448,EARLY POEMS,"And oft on Sundays young men's gifts declined,"
2449,EARLY POEMS,"Posies from gardens of the sweetest kind,"
2450,EARLY POEMS,"And eager scrambled the dog-rose to get,"
2451,EARLY POEMS,And woodbine-flowers at every bush she met.
2452,EARLY POEMS,"The cowslip blossom, with its ruddy streak,"
2453,EARLY POEMS,Would tempt her furlongs from the path to seek;
2454,EARLY POEMS,"And gay long purple, with its tufty spike,"
2455,EARLY POEMS,She'd wade oer shoes to reach it in the dyke;
2456,EARLY POEMS,"And oft, while scratching through the briary woods"
2457,EARLY POEMS,"For tempting cuckoo-flowers and violet buds,"
2458,EARLY POEMS,"Poor Jane, I've known her crying sneak to town,"
2459,EARLY POEMS,"Fearing her mother, when she'd torn her gown."
2460,EARLY POEMS,"Ah, these were days her conscience viewed with pain,"
2461,EARLY POEMS,"Which all are loth to lose, as well as Jane."
2462,EARLY POEMS,"And, what I took more odd than all the rest,"
2463,EARLY POEMS,"Was, that same night she neer a wish exprest"
2464,EARLY POEMS,"To see the gipsies, so beloved before,"
2465,EARLY POEMS,That lay a stone's throw from us on the moor:
2466,EARLY POEMS,I hinted it; she just replied again--
2467,EARLY POEMS,"She once believed them, but had doubts since then."
2468,EARLY POEMS,"And when we sought our cows, I called, ""Come mull!"""
2469,EARLY POEMS,"But she stood silent, for her heart was full."
2470,EARLY POEMS,She loved dumb things: and ere she had begun
2471,EARLY POEMS,"To milk, caressed them more than eer she'd done;"
2472,EARLY POEMS,"But though her tears stood watering in her eye,"
2473,EARLY POEMS,I little took it as her last good-bye;
2474,EARLY POEMS,"For she was tender, and I've often known"
2475,EARLY POEMS,Her mourn when beetles have been trampled on:
2476,EARLY POEMS,"So I neer dreamed from this, what soon befell,"
2477,EARLY POEMS,Till the next morning rang her passing-bell.
2478,EARLY POEMS,"My story's long, but time's in plenty yet,"
2479,EARLY POEMS,Since the black clouds betoken nought but wet;
2480,EARLY POEMS,"And I'll een snatch a minute's breath or two,"
2481,EARLY POEMS,"And take another pinch, to help me through."
2482,EARLY POEMS,
2483,EARLY POEMS,"""So, as I said, next morn I heard the bell,"
2484,EARLY POEMS,"And passing neighbours crossed the street, to tell"
2485,EARLY POEMS,That my poor partner Jenny had been found
2486,EARLY POEMS,"In the old flag-pool, on the pasture, drowned."
2487,EARLY POEMS,"God knows my heart! I twittered like a leaf,"
2488,EARLY POEMS,And found too late the cause of Sunday's grief;
2489,EARLY POEMS,For every tongue was loosed to gabble oer
2490,EARLY POEMS,The slanderous things that secret passed before:
2491,EARLY POEMS,"With truth or lies they need not then be strict,"
2492,EARLY POEMS,The one they railed at could not contradict.
2493,EARLY POEMS,"Twas now no secret of her being beguiled,"
2494,EARLY POEMS,For every mouth knew Jenny died with child;
2495,EARLY POEMS,"And though more cautious with a living name,"
2496,EARLY POEMS,Each more than guessed her master bore the blame.
2497,EARLY POEMS,"That very morning, it affects me still,"
2498,EARLY POEMS,"Ye know the foot-path sidles down the hill,"
2499,EARLY POEMS,Ignorant as babe unborn I passed the pond
2500,EARLY POEMS,"To milk as usual in our close beyond,"
2501,EARLY POEMS,"And cows were drinking at the water's edge,"
2502,EARLY POEMS,"And horses browsed among the flags and sedge,"
2503,EARLY POEMS,"And gnats and midges danced the water oer,"
2504,EARLY POEMS,"Just as I've marked them scores of times before,"
2505,EARLY POEMS,"And birds sat singing, as in mornings gone,--"
2506,EARLY POEMS,"While I as unconcerned went soodling on,"
2507,EARLY POEMS,"But little dreaming, as the wakening wind"
2508,EARLY POEMS,"Flapped the broad ash-leaves oer the pond reclin'd,"
2509,EARLY POEMS,"And oer the water crinked the curdled wave,"
2510,EARLY POEMS,That Jane was sleeping in her watery grave.
2511,EARLY POEMS,"The neatherd boy that used to tend the cows,"
2512,EARLY POEMS,While getting whip-sticks from the dangling boughs
2513,EARLY POEMS,"Of osiers drooping by the water-side,"
2514,EARLY POEMS,Her bonnet floating on the top espied;
2515,EARLY POEMS,"He knew it well, and hastened fearful down"
2516,EARLY POEMS,"To take the terror of his fears to town,--"
2517,EARLY POEMS,
2518,EARLY POEMS,"A melancholy story, far too true;"
2519,EARLY POEMS,"And soon the village to the pasture flew,"
2520,EARLY POEMS,"Where, from the deepest hole the pond about,"
2521,EARLY POEMS,"They dragged poor Jenny's lifeless body out,"
2522,EARLY POEMS,"And took her home, where scarce an hour gone by"
2523,EARLY POEMS,She had been living like to you and I.
2524,EARLY POEMS,"I went with more, and kissed her for the last,"
2525,EARLY POEMS,And thought with tears on pleasures that were past;
2526,EARLY POEMS,"And, the last kindness left me then to do,"
2527,EARLY POEMS,"I went, at milking, where the blossoms grew,"
2528,EARLY POEMS,"And handfuls got of rose and lambtoe sweet,"
2529,EARLY POEMS,And put them with her in her winding-sheet.
2530,EARLY POEMS,"A wilful murder, jury made the crime;"
2531,EARLY POEMS,"Nor parson 'lowed to pray, nor bell to chime;"
2532,EARLY POEMS,"On the cross roads, far from her friends and kin,"
2533,EARLY POEMS,The usual law for their ungodly sin
2534,EARLY POEMS,"Who violent hands upon themselves have laid,"
2535,EARLY POEMS,Poor Jane's last bed unchristian-like was made;
2536,EARLY POEMS,"And there, like all whose last thoughts turn to heaven,"
2537,EARLY POEMS,"She sleeps, and doubtless hoped to be forgiven."
2538,EARLY POEMS,"But, though I say't, for maids thus veigled in"
2539,EARLY POEMS,I think the wicked men deserve the sin;
2540,EARLY POEMS,And sure enough we all at last shall see
2541,EARLY POEMS,The treachery punished as it ought to be.
2542,EARLY POEMS,"For ere his wickedness pretended love,"
2543,EARLY POEMS,"Jane, I'll be bound, was spotless as the dove,"
2544,EARLY POEMS,"And's good a servant, still old folks allow,"
2545,EARLY POEMS,As ever scoured a pail or milked a cow;
2546,EARLY POEMS,"And ere he led her into ruin's way,"
2547,EARLY POEMS,As gay and buxom as a summer's day:
2548,EARLY POEMS,"The birds that ranted in the hedge-row boughs,"
2549,EARLY POEMS,"As night and morning we have sought our cows,"
2550,EARLY POEMS,"With yokes and buckets as she bounced along,"
2551,EARLY POEMS,Were often deafed to silence with her song.
2552,EARLY POEMS,
2553,EARLY POEMS,"But now she's gone:--girls, shun deceitful men,"
2554,EARLY POEMS,The worst of stumbles ye can fall agen;
2555,EARLY POEMS,"Be deaf to them, and then, as twere, ye'll see"
2556,EARLY POEMS,Your pleasures safe as under lock and key.
2557,EARLY POEMS,"Throw not my words away, as many do;"
2558,EARLY POEMS,"They're gold in value, though they're cheap to you."
2559,EARLY POEMS,"And husseys hearken, and be warned from this,"
2560,EARLY POEMS,"If ye love mothers, never do amiss:"
2561,EARLY POEMS,"Jane might love hers, but she forsook the plan"
2562,EARLY POEMS,"To make her happy, when she thought of man."
2563,EARLY POEMS,"Poor tottering dame, it was too plainly known,"
2564,EARLY POEMS,"Her daughter's dying hastened on her own,"
2565,EARLY POEMS,For from the day the tidings reached her door
2566,EARLY POEMS,"She took to bed and looked up no more,"
2567,EARLY POEMS,"And, ere again another year came round,"
2568,EARLY POEMS,"She, well as Jane, was laid within the ground;"
2569,EARLY POEMS,And all were grieved poor Goody's end to see:
2570,EARLY POEMS,"No better neighbour entered house than she,"
2571,EARLY POEMS,"A harmless soul, with no abusive tongue,"
2572,EARLY POEMS,"Trig as new pins, and tight's the day was long;"
2573,EARLY POEMS,"And go the week about, nine times in ten"
2574,EARLY POEMS,Ye'd find her house as cleanly as her sen.
2575,EARLY POEMS,"But, Lord protect us! time such change does bring,"
2576,EARLY POEMS,We cannot dream what oer our heads may hing;
2577,EARLY POEMS,"The very house she lived in, stick and stone,"
2578,EARLY POEMS,"Since Goody died, has tumbled down and gone:"
2579,EARLY POEMS,"And where the marjoram once, and sage, and rue,"
2580,EARLY POEMS,"And balm, and mint, with curled-leaf parsley grew,"
2581,EARLY POEMS,"And double marygolds, and silver thyme,"
2582,EARLY POEMS,And pumpkins neath the window used to climb;
2583,EARLY POEMS,And where I often when a child for hours
2584,EARLY POEMS,"Tried through the pales to get the tempting flowers,"
2585,EARLY POEMS,"As lady's laces, everlasting peas,"
2586,EARLY POEMS,"True-love-lies-bleeding, with the hearts-at-ease,"

4420,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4421,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And oft as morning from her lattice peeps
4422,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"To beckon up the sun, I seek with thee"
4423,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To drink the dewy breath
4424,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Of fields left fragrant then,"
4425,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4426,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"In solitudes, where no frequented paths"
4427,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"But what thy own foot makes betray thy home,"
4428,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Stealing obtrusive there
4429,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To meditate thy end:
4430,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4431,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"By overshadowed ponds, in woody nooks,"
4432,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"With ramping sallows lined, and crowding sedge,"
4433,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Which woo the winds to play,"
4434,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And with them dance for joy;
4435,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4436,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And meadow pools, torn wide by lawless floods,"
4437,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Where water-lilies spread their oily leaves,"
4438,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"On which, as wont, the fly"

4440,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4441,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Where leans the mossy willow half way oer,"
4442,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,On which the shepherd crawls astride to throw
4443,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"His angle, clear of weeds"
4444,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,That crowd the water's brim;
4445,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4446,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Or crispy hills, and hollows scant of sward,"
4447,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Where step by step the patient lonely boy
4448,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Hath cut rude flights of stairs
4449,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To climb their steepy sides;
4450,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4451,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Then track along their feet, grown hoarse with noise,"
4452,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The crawling brook, that ekes its weary speed,"
4453,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And struggles through the weeds
4454,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,With faint and sullen brawl.
4455,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4456,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"These haunts I long have favoured, more as now"
4457,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"With thee thus wandering, moralizing on,"
4458,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Stealing glad thoughts from grief,"
4459,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And happy, though I sigh."
4460,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4461,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Sweet Vision, with the wild dishevelled hair,"
4462,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And raiment shadowy of each wind's embrace,"
4463,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Fain would I win thine harp
4464,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To one accordant theme;
4465,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4466,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Now not inaptly craved, communing thus,"
4467,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Beneath the curdled arms of this stunt oak,"
4468,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"While pillowed on the grass,"
4469,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,We fondly ruminate
4470,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4471,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Oer the disordered scenes of woods and fields,"

4475,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4476,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Marking the cow-boy that so merry trills
4477,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"His frequent, unpremeditated song,"
4478,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Wooing the winds to pause,"
4479,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Till echo brawls again;
4480,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4481,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"As on with plashy step, and clouted shoon,"
4482,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"He roves, half indolent and self-employed,"
4483,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To rob the little birds

4485,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4486,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And sloes, dim covered as with dewy veils,"

4488,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Arching their prickly trails
4489,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Half oer the narrow lane:
4490,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4491,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Noting the hedger front with stubborn face
4492,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The dank blea wind, that whistles thinly by"
4493,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"His leathern garb, thorn proof,"
4494,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And cheek red hot with toil.
4495,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4496,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"While oer the pleachy lands of mellow brown,"
4497,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,The mower's stubbling scythe clogs to his foot
4498,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The ever eking whisp,"

4505,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4506,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,See! from the rustling scythe the haunted hare
4507,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Scampers circuitous, with startled ears"
4508,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Prickt up, then squat, as bye"
4509,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"She brushes to the woods,"
4510,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4511,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Where reeded grass, breast-high and undisturbed,"
4512,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Forms pleasant clumps, through which the soothing winds"
4513,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Soften her rigid fears,"
4514,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And lull to calm repose.
4515,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4516,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Wild sorceress! me thy restless mood delights,"
4517,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"More than the stir of summer's crowded scenes,"
4518,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Where, jostled in the din,"
4519,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Joy palled my ear with song;
4520,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4521,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Heart-sickening for the silence that is thine,"
4522,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Not broken inharmoniously, as now"
4523,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,That lone and vagrant bee
4524,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Booms faint with wearp chime.
4525,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4526,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Now filtering winds thin winnow through the woods
4527,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"In tremulous noise, that bids, at every breath,"
4528,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Some sickly cankered leaf
4529,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Let go its hold, and die."
4530,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4531,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And now the bickering storm, with sudden start,"

4533,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Thee urging to thine end,"

4535,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4536,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And yet, sublime in grief, thy thoughts delight"
4537,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"To show me visions of most gorgeous dyes,"
4538,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Haply forgetting now

4541,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades,"
4542,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Improvident of waste, till every bough"

4544,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Disorderly divine.
4545,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
4546,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Soon must I view thee as a pleasant dream
4547,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Droop faintly, and so sicken for thine end,"
4548,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,As sad the winds sink low

4994,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And there stood the blacksmith awaiting a drop
4995,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,As dry as the cinders that lay in his shop;
4996,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And there stood the cobbler as dry as a bun,"
4997,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Almost crackt like a bucket when left in the sun.
4998,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He'd whetted his knife upon pendil and hone
4999,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Till he'd not got a spittle to moisten the stone;
5000,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,So ere he could work--though he'd lost the whole day--
5001,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He must wait the new broach and bemoisten his clay.
5002,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5003,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The cellar was empty, each barrel was drained"
5004,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To its dregs--and Sir John like a rebel remained
5005,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,In the street--for removal too powerful and large
5006,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,For two or three topers to take into charge.
5007,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Odd zooks, said a gipsey, with bellows to mend,"
5008,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Had I strength I would just be for helping a friend
5009,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To walk on his legs: but a child in the street
5010,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Had as much power as he to put John on his feet.
5011,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Then up came the blacksmith: Sir Barley, said he,"
5012,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,I should just like to storm your old tower for a spree;
5013,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5014,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And my strength for your strength and bar your renown
5015,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,I'd soon try your spirit by cracking your crown.
5016,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the cobbler he tuckt up his apron and spit
5017,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,In his hands for a burster--but devil a bit
5018,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Would he move--so as yet they made nothing of land;
5019,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,For there lay the knight like a whale in the sand.
5020,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Said the tinker: If I could but drink of his vein
5021,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,I should just be as strong and as stubborn again.
5022,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Push along, said the toper, the cellar's adry:"
5023,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,There's nothing to moisten the mouth of a fly.
5024,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5025,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Says the host, We shall burn out with thirst, he's so big."
5026,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,There's a cag of small swipes half as sour as a wig.
5027,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"In such like extremes, why, extremes will come pat;"
5028,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,So let's go and wet all our whistles with that.
5029,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Says the gipsey, May I never bottom a chair"
5030,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,If I drink of small swipes while Sir John's lying there.
5031,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the blacksmith he threw off his apron and swore
5032,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Small swipes should bemoisten his gullet no more:
5033,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Let it out on the floor for the dry cock-a-roach--
5034,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And he held up his hammer with threatens to broach
5035,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5036,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Sir John in his castle without leave or law
5037,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And suck out his blood with a reed or a straw
5038,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Ere he'd soak at the swipes--and he turned him to start,"
5039,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Till the host for high treason came down a full quart.
5040,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Just then passed the dandy and turned up his nose:
5041,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"They'd fain have him shove, but he looked at his clothes"
5042,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And nipt his nose closer and twirled his stick round
5043,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And simpered, Tis nuisance to lie on the ground."
5044,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"But Bacchus, he laughed from the old tavern sign,"
5045,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Saying, Go on, thou shadow, and let the sun shine."
5046,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5047,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Then again they all tried, and the tinker he swore"
5048,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,That the hogshead had grown twice as heavy or more.
5049,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Nay nay, said the toper, and reeled as he spoke,"
5050,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"We're all getting weak, that's the end of the joke."
5051,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The ploughman came up and cut short his old tune,"
5052,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Hallooed ""woi"" to his horses and though it was June"
5053,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Said he'd help them an hour ere he'd keep them adry;
5054,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Well done, said the blacksmith with hopes running high;"
5055,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"He moves, and, by jingo, success to the plough!"
5056,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Aye aye, said the cobbler, we'll conquer him now."
5057,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5058,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The hogshead rolled forward, the toper fell back,"
5059,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the host laughed aloud as his sides they would crack
5060,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To see the old tinker's toil make such a gap
5061,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,In his coat as to rend it from collar to flap.
5062,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,But the tinker he grumbled and cried Fiddle-dee!
5063,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,This garment hath been an old tenant with me;
5064,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And a needle and thread with a little good skill
5065,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,When I've leisure will make it stand more weathers still.
5066,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Then crack went his breeks from the hip to the knee
5067,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,With his thrusting--no matter; for nothing cared he.
5068,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5069,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"So long as Sir John rolled along to the door,"
5070,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"He's a chip of our block, said the blacksmith, and swore;"
5071,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And as sure as I live to drive nails in a shoe
5072,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He shall have at my cost a full pitcher or two.
5073,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the toper he hiccuped--which hindered an oath--
5074,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"So long as he'd credit, he'd pitcher them both."
5075,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,But the host stopt to hint when he'd ordered the dray
5076,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Sir Barleycorn's order was purchase and pay.
5077,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And now the old knight is imprisoned and ta'en
5078,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,To waste in the tavern man's cellar again.
5079,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5080,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And now, said the blacksmith, let forfeits come first"
5081,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"For the insult swipes offered, or his hoops I will burst."
5082,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Here it is, my old hearties--Then drink your thirst full,"
5083,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Said the host, for the stingo is worth a strong pull."
5084,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Never fear for your legs if they're broken to-day;
5085,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Winds only blow straws, dust, and feathers away."
5086,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"But the cask that is full, like a giant he lies,"
5087,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And giants alone can his spirits capsize.
5088,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"If he lies in the path, though a king's coming bye,"
5089,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,John Barleycorn's mighty and there he will lie.
5090,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5091,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Then the toper sat down with a hiccup and felt
5092,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"If he'd still an odd coin in his pocket to melt,"
5093,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And he made a wry face, for his pocket was bare."
5094,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"--But he laughed and danced up, What, old boy, are you there?"
5095,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,When he felt that a stiver had got to his knee
5096,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Through a hole in his fob, and right happy was he."
5097,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Says the tinker, I've brawled till no breath I have got"
5098,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And not met with twopence to purchase a pot.
5099,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Says the toper, I've powder to charge a long gun,"
5100,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And a stiver I've found when I thought I'd got none;
5101,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5102,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,So helping a thirsty old friend in his need
5103,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Is my duty--take heart, thou art welcome indeed."
5104,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Then the smith with his tools in Sir John made a breach,"
5105,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the toper he hiccuped and ended his speech;
5106,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And pulled at the quart, till the snob he declared"
5107,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,When he went to drink next that the bottom was bared.
5108,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"No matter for that, said the toper, and grinned;"
5109,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,I had but a soak and neer rested for wind.
5110,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"That's the law, said the smith, with a look rather vexed,"
5111,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,But the quart was a forfeit; so pay for the next.
5112,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5113,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Thus they talked of their skill and their labour till noon
5114,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"When the sober man's toil was exactly half done,"
5115,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And there the plough lay--people hardly could pass
5116,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the horses let loose polished up the short grass
5117,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And browsed on the bottle of flags lying there,"
5118,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"By the gipsey's old budget, for mending a chair."
5119,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,The miller's horse tied to the old smithy door
5120,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Stood stamping his feet, by the flies bitten sore,"
5121,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Awaiting the smith as he wanted a shoe;
5122,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And he stampt till another fell off and made two:
5123,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5124,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Till the miller, expecting that all would get loose,"
5125,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Went to seek him and cursed him outright for a goose;
5126,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,But he dipt his dry beak in the mug once or twice
5127,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And forgot all his passion and toil in a trice.
5128,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And the flybitten horse at the old smithy post
5129,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Might stamp till his shoes and his legs they were lost.
5130,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He sung his old songs and forgot his old mill--
5131,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Blow winds high or low, she might rest her at will."
5132,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the cobbler, in spite of his bustle for pelf,"
5133,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Left the shop all the day to take care of itself.
5134,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5135,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the toper who carried his house on his head,"
5136,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"No wife to be teazing, no bairns to be fed,"
5137,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Would sit out the week or the month or the year
5138,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Or a life-time so long as he'd credit for beer.
5139,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The ploughman he talked of his skill as divine,"
5140,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,How he could plough thurrows as straight as a line;
5141,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the blacksmith he swore, had he but the command,"
5142,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He could shoe the king's hunter the best in the land;
5143,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the cobbler declared, was his skill but once seen,"
5144,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,He should soon get an order for shoes from the queen.
5145,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5146,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"But the tinker he swore he could beat them all three,"
5147,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"For gi' me a pair of old bellows, says he,"
5148,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And I'll make them roar out like the wind in a storm
5149,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And make them blow fire out of coal hardly warm.
5150,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,The toper said nothing but wished the quart full
5151,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And swore he could toss it all off at a pull.
5152,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Have one, said the tinker; but wit was away,"
5153,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,When the bet was to bind him he'd nothing to pay.
5154,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,And thus in the face of life's sun-and-shower weather
5155,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"They drank, bragged, and sung, and got merry together."
5156,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,
5157,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,The sun he went down--the last gleam from his brow
5158,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Flung a smile of repose on the holiday plough;
5159,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"The glooms they approached, and the dews like a rain"
5160,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Fell thick and hung pearls on the old sorrel mane
5161,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"Of the horse that the miller had brought to be shod,"
5162,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the morning awoke, saw a sight rather odd--"
5163,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"For a bit of the halter still hung at the door,"
5164,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,Bit through by the horse now at feed on the moor;
5165,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,"And the old tinker's budget lay still in the weather,"
5166,MIDDLE PERIOD 1824-1836,While all kept on singing and drinking together.

6727,ASYLUM POEMS,Meet me in the green glen.
6728,ASYLUM POEMS,
6729,ASYLUM POEMS,Meet me at the sunset
6730,ASYLUM POEMS,"Down in the green glen,"
6731,ASYLUM POEMS,Where we've often met
6732,ASYLUM POEMS,"By hawthorn tree and foxes' den,"
6733,ASYLUM POEMS,Meet me in the green glen.
6734,ASYLUM POEMS,
6735,ASYLUM POEMS,"Meet me in the green glen,"
6736,ASYLUM POEMS,By sweet briar bushes there;
6737,ASYLUM POEMS,"Meet me by your own sen,"
6738,ASYLUM POEMS,Where the wild thyme blossoms fair.
6739,ASYLUM POEMS,Meet me in the green glen.
6740,ASYLUM POEMS,
6741,ASYLUM POEMS,"Meet me by the sweet briar,"
6742,ASYLUM POEMS,By the mole hill swelling there;

6749,ASYLUM POEMS,
6750,ASYLUM POEMS,In crime and enmity they lie
6751,ASYLUM POEMS,"Who sin and tell us love can die,"
6752,ASYLUM POEMS,Who say to us in slander's breath
6753,ASYLUM POEMS,That love belongs to sin and death.
6754,ASYLUM POEMS,From heaven it came on angel's wing
6755,ASYLUM POEMS,"To bloom on earth, eternal spring;"
6756,ASYLUM POEMS,In falsehood's enmity they lie
6757,ASYLUM POEMS,Who sin and tell us love can die.
6758,ASYLUM POEMS,
6759,ASYLUM POEMS,Twas born upon an angel's breast.
6760,ASYLUM POEMS,"The softest dreams, the sweetest rest,"
6761,ASYLUM POEMS,"The brightest sun, the bluest sky,"
6762,ASYLUM POEMS,Are love's own home and canopy.
6763,ASYLUM POEMS,The thought that cheers this heart of mine
6764,ASYLUM POEMS,Is that of love; love so divine
6765,ASYLUM POEMS,They sin who say in slander's breath
6766,ASYLUM POEMS,That love belongs to sin and death.
6767,ASYLUM POEMS,
6768,ASYLUM POEMS,"The sweetest voice that lips contain,"
6769,ASYLUM POEMS,"The sweetest thought that leaves the brain,"
6770,ASYLUM POEMS,The sweetest feeling of the heart--
6771,ASYLUM POEMS,There's pleasure in its very smart.
6772,ASYLUM POEMS,The scent of rose and cinnamon
6773,ASYLUM POEMS,Is not like love remembered on;
6774,ASYLUM POEMS,In falsehood's enmity they lie
6775,ASYLUM POEMS,Who sin and tell us love can die.

6779,ASYLUM POEMS,
6780,ASYLUM POEMS,"Peggy said good morning and I said good bye,"
6781,ASYLUM POEMS,When farmers dib the corn and laddies sow the rye.
6782,ASYLUM POEMS,Young Peggy's face was common sense and I was rather shy
6783,ASYLUM POEMS,When I met her in the morning when the farmers sow the rye.
6784,ASYLUM POEMS,
6785,ASYLUM POEMS,"Her half laced boots fit tightly as she tripped along the grass,"
6786,ASYLUM POEMS,And she set her foot so lightly where the early bee doth pass.
6787,ASYLUM POEMS,"Oh Peggy was a young thing, her face was common sense,"
6788,ASYLUM POEMS,I courted her about the spring and loved her ever thence.
6789,ASYLUM POEMS,
6790,ASYLUM POEMS,Oh Peggy was the young thing and bonny as to size;
6791,ASYLUM POEMS,Her lips were cherries of the spring and hazel were her eyes.
6792,ASYLUM POEMS,"Oh Peggy she was straight and tall as is the poplar tree,"
6793,ASYLUM POEMS,"Smooth as the freestone of the wall, and very dear to me."
6794,ASYLUM POEMS,
6795,ASYLUM POEMS,Oh Peggy's gown was chocolate and full of cherries white;
6796,ASYLUM POEMS,I keep a bit on't for her sake and love her day and night.
6797,ASYLUM POEMS,"I drest myself just like a prince and Peggy went to woo,"
6798,ASYLUM POEMS,"But she's been gone some ten years since, and I know not what to do."

6801,ASYLUM POEMS,_The Crow Sat on the Willow_
6802,ASYLUM POEMS,
6803,ASYLUM POEMS,The crow sat on the willow tree
6804,ASYLUM POEMS,"A-lifting up his wings,"
6805,ASYLUM POEMS,"And glossy was his coat to see,"
6806,ASYLUM POEMS,"And loud the ploughman sings,"
6807,ASYLUM POEMS,"""I love my love because I know"
6808,ASYLUM POEMS,"The milkmaid she loves me"";"
6809,ASYLUM POEMS,And hoarsely croaked the glossy crow
6810,ASYLUM POEMS,Upon the willow tree.
6811,ASYLUM POEMS,"""I love my love"" the ploughman sung,"
6812,ASYLUM POEMS,And all the fields with music rung.
6813,ASYLUM POEMS,
6814,ASYLUM POEMS,"""I love my love, a bonny lass,"
6815,ASYLUM POEMS,"She keeps her pails so bright,"
6816,ASYLUM POEMS,And blythe she trips the dewy grass
6817,ASYLUM POEMS,At morning and at night.
6818,ASYLUM POEMS,"A cotton dress her morning gown,"
6819,ASYLUM POEMS,Her face was rosy health:
6820,ASYLUM POEMS,She traced the pastures up and down
6821,ASYLUM POEMS,"And nature was her wealth."""
6822,ASYLUM POEMS,"He sung, and turned each furrow down,"
6823,ASYLUM POEMS,His sweetheart's love in cotton gown.
6824,ASYLUM POEMS,
6825,ASYLUM POEMS,"""My love is young and handsome"
6826,ASYLUM POEMS,"As any in the town,"
6827,ASYLUM POEMS,She's worth a ploughman's ransom
6828,ASYLUM POEMS,"In the drab cotton gown."""
6829,ASYLUM POEMS,He sang and turned his furrow oer
6830,ASYLUM POEMS,"And urged his team along,"
6831,ASYLUM POEMS,While on the willow as before
6832,ASYLUM POEMS,The old crow croaked his song:
6833,ASYLUM POEMS,The ploughman sung his rustic lay
6834,ASYLUM POEMS,And sung of Phoebe all the day.
6835,ASYLUM POEMS,
6836,ASYLUM POEMS,The crow he was in love no doubt
6837,ASYLUM POEMS,And [so were] many things:
6838,ASYLUM POEMS,"The ploughman finished many a bout,"
6839,ASYLUM POEMS,"And lustily he sings,"
6840,ASYLUM POEMS,"""My love she is a milking maid"
6841,ASYLUM POEMS,With red rosy cheek;
6842,ASYLUM POEMS,"Of cotton drab her gown was made,"
6843,ASYLUM POEMS,"I loved her many a week."""

6850,ASYLUM POEMS,_Now_ is past--the happy _now_
6851,ASYLUM POEMS,When we together roved
6852,ASYLUM POEMS,Beneath the wildwood's oak-tree bough
6853,ASYLUM POEMS,And Nature said we loved.
6854,ASYLUM POEMS,Winter's blast
6855,ASYLUM POEMS,"The _now_ since then has crept between,"
6856,ASYLUM POEMS,And left us both apart.
6857,ASYLUM POEMS,Winters that withered all the green
6858,ASYLUM POEMS,Have froze the beating heart.
6859,ASYLUM POEMS,Now is past.
6860,ASYLUM POEMS,
6861,ASYLUM POEMS,_Now_ is past since last we met
6862,ASYLUM POEMS,Beneath the hazel bough;
6863,ASYLUM POEMS,Before the evening sun was set
6864,ASYLUM POEMS,Her shadow stretched below.
6865,ASYLUM POEMS,Autumn's blast
6866,ASYLUM POEMS,Has stained and blighted every bough;
6867,ASYLUM POEMS,Wild strawberries like her lips
6868,ASYLUM POEMS,"Have left the mosses green below,"
6869,ASYLUM POEMS,Her bloom's upon the hips.
6870,ASYLUM POEMS,Now is past.
6871,ASYLUM POEMS,
6872,ASYLUM POEMS,"_Now_ is past, is changed agen,"
6873,ASYLUM POEMS,The woods and fields are painted new.
6874,ASYLUM POEMS,"Wild strawberries which both gathered then,"
6875,ASYLUM POEMS,None know now where they grew.
6876,ASYLUM POEMS,The skys oercast.
6877,ASYLUM POEMS,"Wood strawberries faded from wood sides,"
6878,ASYLUM POEMS,Green leaves have all turned yellow;
6879,ASYLUM POEMS,"No Adelaide walks the wood rides,"
6880,ASYLUM POEMS,True love has no bed-fellow.
6881,ASYLUM POEMS,Now is past.

6884,ASYLUM POEMS,_Song_
6885,ASYLUM POEMS,
6886,ASYLUM POEMS,"I wish I was where I would be,"
6887,ASYLUM POEMS,"With love alone to dwell,"
6888,ASYLUM POEMS,"Was I but her or she but me,"
6889,ASYLUM POEMS,Then love would all be well.
6890,ASYLUM POEMS,I wish to send my thoughts to her
6891,ASYLUM POEMS,"As quick as thoughts can fly,"
6892,ASYLUM POEMS,But as the winds the waters stir
6893,ASYLUM POEMS,The mirrors change and fly.
6894,ASYLUM POEMS,
6895,ASYLUM POEMS,
6896,ASYLUM POEMS,_First Love_
6897,ASYLUM POEMS,
6898,ASYLUM POEMS,I ne'er was struck before that hour
6899,ASYLUM POEMS,With love so sudden and so sweet.
6900,ASYLUM POEMS,Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
6901,ASYLUM POEMS,And stole my heart away complete.
6902,ASYLUM POEMS,"My face turned pale as deadly pale,"
6903,ASYLUM POEMS,"My legs refused to walk away,"
6904,ASYLUM POEMS,"And when she looked ""what could I ail?"""
6905,ASYLUM POEMS,My life and all seemed turned to clay.
6906,ASYLUM POEMS,
6907,ASYLUM POEMS,And then my blood rushed to my face
6908,ASYLUM POEMS,And took my sight away.
6909,ASYLUM POEMS,The trees and bushes round the place
6910,ASYLUM POEMS,Seemed midnight at noonday.
6911,ASYLUM POEMS,"I could not see a single thing,"
6912,ASYLUM POEMS,Words from my eyes did start;
6913,ASYLUM POEMS,They spoke as chords do from the string
6914,ASYLUM POEMS,And blood burnt round my heart.
6915,ASYLUM POEMS,
6916,ASYLUM POEMS,Are flowers the winter's choice?
6917,ASYLUM POEMS,Is love's bed always snow?
6918,ASYLUM POEMS,She seemed to hear my silent voice
6919,ASYLUM POEMS,And love's appeal to know.
6920,ASYLUM POEMS,I never saw so sweet a face
6921,ASYLUM POEMS,As that I stood before:
6922,ASYLUM POEMS,My heart has left its dwelling-place

6926,ASYLUM POEMS,_Mary Bayfield_
6927,ASYLUM POEMS,
6928,ASYLUM POEMS,How beautiful the summer night
6929,ASYLUM POEMS,"When birds roost on the mossy tree,"
6930,ASYLUM POEMS,When moon and stars are shining bright
6931,ASYLUM POEMS,And home has gone the weary bee!
6932,ASYLUM POEMS,"Then Mary Bayfield seeks the glen,"
6933,ASYLUM POEMS,"The white hawthorn and grey oak tree,"
6934,ASYLUM POEMS,And nought but heaven can tell me then
6935,ASYLUM POEMS,How dear thy beauty is to me.
6936,ASYLUM POEMS,
6937,ASYLUM POEMS,"Dear is the dewdrop to the flower,"
6938,ASYLUM POEMS,"The old wall to the weary bee,"
6939,ASYLUM POEMS,"And silence to the evening hour,"
6940,ASYLUM POEMS,And ivy to the stooping tree.
6941,ASYLUM POEMS,"Dearer than these, than all beside,"
6942,ASYLUM POEMS,"Than blossoms to the moss-rose tree,"
6943,ASYLUM POEMS,The maid who wanders by my side--
6944,ASYLUM POEMS,Sweet Mary Bayfield is to me.
6945,ASYLUM POEMS,
6946,ASYLUM POEMS,"Sweet is the moonlight on the tree,"
6947,ASYLUM POEMS,"The stars above the glassy lake,"
6948,ASYLUM POEMS,That from the bottom look at me
6949,ASYLUM POEMS,Through shadows of the crimping brake.
6950,ASYLUM POEMS,Such are sweet things--but sweeter still
6951,ASYLUM POEMS,Than these and all beside I see
6952,ASYLUM POEMS,"The maid whose look my heart can thrill,"
6953,ASYLUM POEMS,My Mary Bayfield's look to me.
6954,ASYLUM POEMS,
6955,ASYLUM POEMS,"O Mary with the dark brown hair,"
6956,ASYLUM POEMS,"The rosy cheek, the beaming eye,"
6957,ASYLUM POEMS,I would thy shade were ever near;
6958,ASYLUM POEMS,Then would I never grieve or sigh.
6959,ASYLUM POEMS,"I love thee, Mary dearly love--"
6960,ASYLUM POEMS,"There's nought so fair on earth I see,"
6961,ASYLUM POEMS,"There's nought so dear in heaven above,"

6967,ASYLUM POEMS,"Maid of Jerusalem, by the Dead Sea,"
6968,ASYLUM POEMS,"I wandered all sorrowing thinking of thee,--"
6969,ASYLUM POEMS,"Thy city in ruins, thy kindred deplored,"
6970,ASYLUM POEMS,All fallen and lost by the Ottoman's sword.
6971,ASYLUM POEMS,
6972,ASYLUM POEMS,"I saw thee sit there in disconsolate sighs,"
6973,ASYLUM POEMS,Where the hall of thy fathers a ruined heap lies.
6974,ASYLUM POEMS,"Thy fair finger showed me the place where they trod,"
6975,ASYLUM POEMS,In thy childhood where flourished the city of God.
6976,ASYLUM POEMS,
6977,ASYLUM POEMS,"The place where they fell and the scenes where they lie,"
6978,ASYLUM POEMS,In the tomb of Siloa--the tear in her eye
6979,ASYLUM POEMS,"She stifled: transfixed there it grew like a pearl,"
6980,ASYLUM POEMS,Beneath the dark lash of the sweet Jewish Girl.
6981,ASYLUM POEMS,
6982,ASYLUM POEMS,"Jerusalem is fallen! still thou art in bloom,"
6983,ASYLUM POEMS,"As fresh as the ivy around the lone tomb,"
6984,ASYLUM POEMS,And fair as the lily of morning that waves
6985,ASYLUM POEMS,Its sweet-scented bells over desolate graves.
6986,ASYLUM POEMS,
6987,ASYLUM POEMS,"When I think of Jerusalem in kingdoms yet free,"
6988,ASYLUM POEMS,I shall think of its ruins and think upon thee;
6989,ASYLUM POEMS,"Thou beautiful Jewess, content thou mayest roam;"
6990,ASYLUM POEMS,A bright spot in Eden still blooms as thy home.

6992,ASYLUM POEMS,
6993,ASYLUM POEMS,Song
6994,ASYLUM POEMS,
6995,ASYLUM POEMS,I would not feign a single sigh
6996,ASYLUM POEMS,Nor weep a single tear for thee:
6997,ASYLUM POEMS,The soul within these orbs burns dry;
6998,ASYLUM POEMS,A desert spreads where love should be.
6999,ASYLUM POEMS,I would not be a worm to crawl
7000,ASYLUM POEMS,A writhing suppliant in thy way;
7001,ASYLUM POEMS,"For love is life, is heaven, and all"
7002,ASYLUM POEMS,The beams of an immortal day.
7003,ASYLUM POEMS,
7004,ASYLUM POEMS,"For sighs are idle things and vain,"
7005,ASYLUM POEMS,And tears for idiots vainly fall.
7006,ASYLUM POEMS,I would not kiss thy face again
7007,ASYLUM POEMS,Nor round thy shining slippers crawl.
7008,ASYLUM POEMS,"Love is the honey, not the bee,"
7009,ASYLUM POEMS,Nor would I turn its sweets to gall
7010,ASYLUM POEMS,"For all the beauty found in thee,"
7011,ASYLUM POEMS,"Thy lily neck, rose cheek, and all."
7012,ASYLUM POEMS,
7013,ASYLUM POEMS,I would not feign a single tale
7014,ASYLUM POEMS,Thy kindness or thy love to seek;
7015,ASYLUM POEMS,"Nor sigh for Jenny of the Vale,"
7016,ASYLUM POEMS,Her ruby smile or rosy cheek.
7017,ASYLUM POEMS,I would not have a pain to own
7018,ASYLUM POEMS,For those dark curls and those bright eyes
7019,ASYLUM POEMS,"A frowning lip, a heart of stone,"
7020,ASYLUM POEMS,False love and folly I despise.

7028,ASYLUM POEMS,Dost thou think of one ever--
7029,ASYLUM POEMS,A lost and a lorn one
7030,ASYLUM POEMS,That adores thee and loves thee?
7031,ASYLUM POEMS,"And when happy morn's gone,"
7032,ASYLUM POEMS,"And nature's calm moves thee,"
7033,ASYLUM POEMS,"Leaving thee to thy sleep like an angel at rest,"
7034,ASYLUM POEMS,Does the one who adores thee still live in thy breast?
7035,ASYLUM POEMS,
7036,ASYLUM POEMS,Does nature eer give thee
7037,ASYLUM POEMS,"Love's past happy vision,"
7038,ASYLUM POEMS,And wrap thee and leave thee
7039,ASYLUM POEMS,In fancies elysian?
7040,ASYLUM POEMS,"Thy beauty I clung to,"
7041,ASYLUM POEMS,As leaves to the tree;
7042,ASYLUM POEMS,When thou fair and young too
7043,ASYLUM POEMS,"Looked lightly on me,"

7045,ASYLUM POEMS,And shed its perfuming and bloom on thy breast.

7061,ASYLUM POEMS,"In the wrinkles of the spring,"
7062,ASYLUM POEMS,"Then oer the rushes flies again,"
7063,ASYLUM POEMS,And pearls roll off his back like rain.

7066,ASYLUM POEMS,"Village doors and windows by,"
7067,ASYLUM POEMS,Whisking oer the garden pales

7069,ASYLUM POEMS,
7070,ASYLUM POEMS,Whewing by the ladslove tree
7071,ASYLUM POEMS,For something only seen by thee;
7072,ASYLUM POEMS,Pearls that on the red rose hing

7084,ASYLUM POEMS,"To go aboard a ship through love, and plough the ocean wide."
7085,ASYLUM POEMS,"I crossed my native fields, where the scarlet poppies grew,"
7086,ASYLUM POEMS,And the groundlark left his nest like a neighbour which I knew.
7087,ASYLUM POEMS,
7088,ASYLUM POEMS,"The pigeons from the dove cote cooed over the old lane,"
7089,ASYLUM POEMS,The crow flocks from the oakwood went flopping oer the grain;
7090,ASYLUM POEMS,Like lots of dear old neighbours whom I shall see no more
7091,ASYLUM POEMS,They greeted me that morning I left the English shore.
7092,ASYLUM POEMS,
7093,ASYLUM POEMS,"The sun was just a-rising above the heath of furze,"
7094,ASYLUM POEMS,And the shadows grow to giants; that bright ball never stirs:
7095,ASYLUM POEMS,"There the shepherds lay with their dogs by their side,"
7096,ASYLUM POEMS,And they started up and barked as my shadow they espied.
7097,ASYLUM POEMS,
7098,ASYLUM POEMS,A maid of early morning twirled her mop upon the moor;
7099,ASYLUM POEMS,I wished her my farewell before she closed the door.
7100,ASYLUM POEMS,"My friends I left behind me for other places new,"
7101,ASYLUM POEMS,Crows and pigeons all were strangers as oer my head they flew.
7102,ASYLUM POEMS,
7103,ASYLUM POEMS,"Trees and bushes were all strangers, the hedges and the lanes,"
7104,ASYLUM POEMS,The steeples and the houses and broad untrodden plains.
7105,ASYLUM POEMS,I passed the pretty milkmaid with her red and rosy face;
7106,ASYLUM POEMS,"I knew not where I met her, I was strange to the place."
7107,ASYLUM POEMS,
7108,ASYLUM POEMS,"At last I saw the ocean, a pleasing sight to me:"
7109,ASYLUM POEMS,I stood upon the shore of a mighty glorious sea.
7110,ASYLUM POEMS,"The waves in easy motion went rolling on their way,"
7111,ASYLUM POEMS,English colours were a-flying where the British squadron lay.
7112,ASYLUM POEMS,
7113,ASYLUM POEMS,"I left my honest parents, the church clock and the village;"

7142,ASYLUM POEMS,"I love the weeds along the fen,"
7143,ASYLUM POEMS,"More sweet than garden flowers,"
7144,ASYLUM POEMS,For freedom haunts the humble glen

7161,ASYLUM POEMS,For there my boyhood used to dream.
7162,ASYLUM POEMS,
7163,ASYLUM POEMS,There even toil itself was play;

7239,ASYLUM POEMS,And I went to kiss the place

7242,ASYLUM POEMS,"Where she oer the stile had gone,"
7243,ASYLUM POEMS,And I love all other things
7244,ASYLUM POEMS,Her bright eyes look upon.
7245,ASYLUM POEMS,"If she looks upon the hedge or up the leafing tree,"
7246,ASYLUM POEMS,The whitethorn or the brown oak are made dearer things to me.
7247,ASYLUM POEMS,
7248,ASYLUM POEMS,I have a pleasant hill
7249,ASYLUM POEMS,"Which I sit upon for hours,"
7250,ASYLUM POEMS,Where she cropt some sprigs of thyme
7251,ASYLUM POEMS,And other little flowers;
7252,ASYLUM POEMS,And she muttered as she did it
7253,ASYLUM POEMS,"As does beauty in a dream,"
7254,ASYLUM POEMS,And I loved her when she hid it
7255,ASYLUM POEMS,"On her breast, so like to cream,"
7256,ASYLUM POEMS,Near the brown mole on her neck that to me a diamond shone
7257,ASYLUM POEMS,"Then my eye was like to fire, and my heart was like to stone."
7258,ASYLUM POEMS,
7259,ASYLUM POEMS,There is a small green place
7260,ASYLUM POEMS,"Where cowslips early curled,"
7261,ASYLUM POEMS,"Which on Sabbath day I trace,"

7263,ASYLUM POEMS,"A little oak spreads oer it,"
7264,ASYLUM POEMS,"And throws a shadow round,"
7265,ASYLUM POEMS,"A green sward close before it,"
7266,ASYLUM POEMS,The greenest ever found:

7276,ASYLUM POEMS,"The faded leaves away,"
7277,ASYLUM POEMS,Twirling them by the window pane
7278,ASYLUM POEMS,With thousand others down the lane.
7279,ASYLUM POEMS,

7283,ASYLUM POEMS,Whose chirp would make believe

7285,ASYLUM POEMS,In Summer's lap with flowers to lie.
7286,ASYLUM POEMS,
7287,ASYLUM POEMS,I love to see the cottage smoke
7288,ASYLUM POEMS,"Curl upwards through the trees,"
7289,ASYLUM POEMS,The pigeons nestled round the cote
7290,ASYLUM POEMS,On November days like these;
7291,ASYLUM POEMS,"The cock upon the dunghill crowing,"

7346,ASYLUM POEMS,"Of yellowish hue, yet beautifully green;"
7347,ASYLUM POEMS,"Bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed,"

7349,ASYLUM POEMS,Where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers
7350,ASYLUM POEMS,Up each spread stoven to the branches towers;
7351,ASYLUM POEMS,"And moss around the stoven spreads, dark green,"
7352,ASYLUM POEMS,"And blotched leaved orchis, and the blue bell flowers;"

7363,ASYLUM POEMS,"to sunset they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the"
7364,ASYLUM POEMS,"sugar, and be welcome all summer long. They look like things of mind"
7365,ASYLUM POEMS,"or fairies, and seem pleased or dull as the weather permits. In many"
7366,ASYLUM POEMS,"clean cottages and genteel houses, they are allowed every liberty to"
7367,ASYLUM POEMS,"creep, fly, or do as they like; and seldom or ever do wrong. In fact"

7377,ASYLUM POEMS,"hazels, whitethorns and maples are so like gold beads that I stooped"
7378,ASYLUM POEMS,"down to feel if they were hard, but they melted from my finger. And"
7379,ASYLUM POEMS,"where the dew lies on the primrose, the violet and whitethorn leaves"
7380,ASYLUM POEMS,"they are emerald and beryl, yet nothing more than the dews of the"

7382,ASYLUM POEMS,"gold and silver beads, and the further we go the brighter they seem to"
7383,ASYLUM POEMS,"shine, like solid gold and silver. It is nothing more than the sun's"
7384,ASYLUM POEMS,light and shade upon them in the dewy morning; every thorn-point and
7385,ASYLUM POEMS,every bramble-spear has its trembling ornament: till the wind gets
7386,ASYLUM POEMS,"a little brisker, and then all is shaken off, and all the shining"

7452,ASYLUM POEMS,Till I could not bear to look at light:

7455,ASYLUM POEMS,Where eer I saw a wild flower lie
7456,ASYLUM POEMS,I kissed and bade my love good bye.
7457,ASYLUM POEMS,
7458,ASYLUM POEMS,I met her in the greenest dells
7459,ASYLUM POEMS,Where dewdrops pearl the wood blue bells
7460,ASYLUM POEMS,"The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye,"
7461,ASYLUM POEMS,"The bee kissed and went singing by,"

7482,ASYLUM POEMS,And no breeze ever reached us or strained a single sail.
7483,ASYLUM POEMS,"Three ships of war had we, and the great guns loaded all;"
7484,ASYLUM POEMS,But our ships were dead and beaten that had never feared a foe.
7485,ASYLUM POEMS,The winds becalmed around us cared for no cannon ball;

7544,ASYLUM POEMS,
7545,ASYLUM POEMS,"I opened the casement this morn at starlight,"
7546,ASYLUM POEMS,"And, the moment I got out of bed,"
7547,ASYLUM POEMS,The daisies were quaking about in their white
7548,ASYLUM POEMS,And the cowslip was nodding its head.
7549,ASYLUM POEMS,"The grass was all shivers, the stars were all bright,"
7550,ASYLUM POEMS,And Robin that should come at e'en--
7551,ASYLUM POEMS,"I thought that I saw him, a ghost by moonlight,"
7552,ASYLUM POEMS,Like a stalking horse stand on the green.
7553,ASYLUM POEMS,
7554,ASYLUM POEMS,I went bed agen and did nothing but dream
7555,ASYLUM POEMS,Of Robin and moonlight and flowers.
7556,ASYLUM POEMS,"He stood like a shadow transfixed by a stream,"
7557,ASYLUM POEMS,And I couldn't forget him for hours.
7558,ASYLUM POEMS,"I'd just dropt asleep when I dreamed Robin spoke,"
7559,ASYLUM POEMS,"And the casement it gave such a shake,"
7560,ASYLUM POEMS,As if every pane in the window was broke;
7561,ASYLUM POEMS,Such a patter the gravel did make.
7562,ASYLUM POEMS,
7563,ASYLUM POEMS,So I up in the morning before the cock crew
7564,ASYLUM POEMS,And to strike me a light I sat down.
7565,ASYLUM POEMS,I saw from the door all his track in the dew
7566,ASYLUM POEMS,"And, I guess, called ""Come in and sit down."""
7567,ASYLUM POEMS,"And one, sure enough, tramples up to the door,"
7568,ASYLUM POEMS,And who but young Robin his sen?
7569,ASYLUM POEMS,And ere the old folks were half willing to stir
7570,ASYLUM POEMS,"We met, kissed, and parted agen."

7576,ASYLUM POEMS,The swallow swimming by.
7577,ASYLUM POEMS,"He loved the daisy-covered ground,"
7578,ASYLUM POEMS,The cloud-bedappled sky.
7579,ASYLUM POEMS,To him the dismal storm appeared
7580,ASYLUM POEMS,The very voice of God;
7581,ASYLUM POEMS,And when the evening rack was reared
7582,ASYLUM POEMS,Stood Moses with his rod.
7583,ASYLUM POEMS,"And everything his eyes surveyed,"
7584,ASYLUM POEMS,"The insects in the brake,"

7600,ASYLUM POEMS,"Struts with the hens, and seems to like some best,"
7601,ASYLUM POEMS,"Then crows, and looks about for little crumbs,"
7602,ASYLUM POEMS,Swept out by little folks an hour ago;
7603,ASYLUM POEMS,The pigs sleep in the stye; the bookman comes--

7619,ASYLUM POEMS,While oer the odd flowers swim grandfather bees
7620,ASYLUM POEMS,In the old homestead rests the cottage cow;
7621,ASYLUM POEMS,"The dogs sit on their haunches near the pail,"
7622,ASYLUM POEMS,"The least one to the stranger growls ""bow wow,"""
7623,ASYLUM POEMS,"Then hurries to the door and cocks his tail,"
7624,ASYLUM POEMS,To knaw the unfinished bone; the placid cow

7691,ASYLUM POEMS,
