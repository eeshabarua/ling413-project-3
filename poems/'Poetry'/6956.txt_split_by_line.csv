275,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I have lived long, and served the gods, and drawn"
276,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Small joy and liberal sorrow,--scorned the gods,"
277,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And drawn no less my little meed of good,"
278,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Suffered my ill in no more grievous measure.
279,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I have been glad--alas, my foolish people,"
280,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I have been glad with you! And ye are glad,"
281,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Seeing the gods in all things, praising them"

288,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"They heard, and did perceive, and were well pleased,--"
289,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"A little music in their ears; perchance,"
290,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"A grain more savor to their nostrils, sweet"
291,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Tho' scarce accounted of. But when for me
292,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"The mists of Acheron have striven up,"
293,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,And horror was shed round me; when my knees
294,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Relaxed, my tongue clave speechless, they forgot."
295,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And when my sharp cry cut the moveless night,"
296,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,And days and nights my wailings clamored up
297,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And beat about their golden homes, perchance"
298,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"They shut their ears. No happy music this,"
299,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Eddying through their nectar cups and calm!
300,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Then I cried out against them, and died not;"
301,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And rose, and set me to my daily tasks."
302,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"So all day long, with bare, uplift right arm,"
303,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Drew out the strong thread from the carded wool,"
304,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Or wrought strange figures, lotus-buds and serpents,"
305,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,In Purple on the himation's saffron fold;
306,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Nor uttered praise with the slim-wristed girls
307,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"To any god, nor uttered any prayer,"
308,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Nor poured out bowls of wine and smooth bright oil,"
309,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Nor brake and gave small cakes of beaten meal
310,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And honey, as this time, or such a god"
311,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Required; nor offered apples summer-flushed,"
312,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Scarlet pomegranates, poppy-bells, or doves."
313,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"All this with scorn, and waiting all day long,"
314,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And night long with dim fear, afraid of sleep,--"
315,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Seeing I took no hurt of all these things,"
316,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,And seeing mine eyes were drièd of their tears
317,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"So that once more the light grew sweet for me,"
318,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Once more grew fair the fields and valley streams,"
319,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,I thought with how small profit men take heed
320,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"To worship with bowed heads, and suppliant hands,"
321,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And sacrifice, the everlasting gods,"
322,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Who take small thought of them to curse or bless,"

326,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Be one so wretched to encounter it;
327,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Ay, have I seen a multitude of good deeds"
328,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Fly up in the pan like husks, like husks blown dry."
329,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Hereafter let none question the high gods!
330,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,I questioned; but these watching eyes have seen
331,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Actaeon, thewed and sinewed like a god,"
332,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Godlike for sweet speech and great deeds, hurled down"
333,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"To hideous death,--scarce suffered space to breathe"
334,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Ere the wild heart in his changed quivering side
335,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Burst with mad terror, and the stag's wide eyes"

343,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Girt with green vales awake with brooks or still,"
344,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Towers up mid lesser-browed Boeotian hills--
345,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,These couched like herds secure beneath its ken--
346,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,And watches earth's green corners. At mid-noon
347,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,We of Plataea mark the sun make pause
348,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Right over it, and top its crest with pride."
349,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Men of Eleusis look toward north at dawn

354,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"What gods, what godlike men to match with gods,"
355,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Have roamed, and grown up mighty, and waxed wise"
356,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Under the law of him whom gods and men
357,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Reverence, and call Cheiron! He, made wise"
358,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"With knowledge of all wisdom, had made wise"
359,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Actaeon, till there moved none cunninger"

367,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Him the wise Centaur shall behold no more.
368,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,
369,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I have lived long, and watched out many days,"
370,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And am well sick of watching. Three days since,"
371,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I had gone out upon the slopes for herbs,"
372,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Snake-root, and subtle gums; and when the light"
373,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Fell slantwise through the upper glens, and missed"
374,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"The sunk ravines, I came where all the hills"
375,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Circle the valley of Gargaphian streams.
376,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Reach beyond reach all down the valley gleamed,--"
377,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Thick branches ringed them. Scarce a bowshot past
378,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"My platan, thro' the woven leaves low-hung,"
379,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Trembling in meshes of the woven sun,"
380,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"A yellow-sanded pool, shallow and clear,"
381,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Lay sparkling, brown about the further bank"
382,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,From scarlet-berried ash-trees hanging over.
383,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,But suddenly the shallows brake awake
384,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"With laughter and light voices, and I saw"
385,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Where Artemis, white goddess incorrupt,"
386,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Bane of swift beasts, and deadly for straight shaft"
387,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Unswerving, from a coppice not far off"
388,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Came to the pool from the hither bank to bathe.
389,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Amid her maiden company she moved,"
390,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Their cross-thonged yellow buskins scattered off,"
391,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Unloosed their knotted hair; and thus the pool
392,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Received them stepping, shrinking, down to it."
393,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,
394,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Here they flocked white, and splashed the water-drops"
395,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,On rounded breast and shoulder snowier
396,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Than the washed clouds athwart the morning's blue,--"
397,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Fresher than river grasses which the herds
398,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Pluck from the river in the burning noons.
399,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Their tresses on the summer wind they flung;
400,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,And some a shining yellow fleece let fall
401,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,For the sun's envy; others with white hands
402,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Lifted a glooming wealth of locks more dark
403,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Than deepest wells, but purple in the sun."
404,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And She, their mistress, of the heart unstormed,"
405,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Stood taller than they all, supreme, and still,"
406,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Perfectly fair like day, and crowned with hair"
407,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"The color of nipt beech-leaves: Ay, such hair"
408,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Was mine in years when I was such as these.
409,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"I let it fall to cover me, or coiled"
410,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,Its soft thick coils about my throat and arms;
411,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Its color like nipt beech-leaves, tawny brown,"
412,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,But in the sun a fountain of live gold.
413,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,
414,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Even as thus they played, and some lithe maids"
415,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Upreached white arms to grasp the berried ash,"
416,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"And, plucking the bright bunches, shed them wide"
417,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"By red ripe handfuls, not far off I saw"
418,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"With long stride making down the beechy glade,"
419,A WOMAN OF PLATAEA SPEAKS.,"Clear-eyed, with firm lips laughing, at his heels"
