180,_PROEM._,_There is no rhyme that is half so sweet

182,_PROEM._,There is no metre that's half so fine
183,_PROEM._,As the lilt of the brook under rock and vine;
184,_PROEM._,And the loveliest lyric I ever heard
185,_PROEM._,Was the wildwood strain of a forest bird.--
186,_PROEM._,If the wind and the brook and the bird would teach
187,_PROEM._,My heart their beautiful parts of speech.
188,_PROEM._,"And the natural art that they say these with,"
189,_PROEM._,My soul would sing of beauty and myth
190,_PROEM._,In a rhyme and a metre that none before
191,_PROEM._,"Have sung in their love, or dreamed in their lore,"
192,_PROEM._,And the world would be richer one poet the more._

207,I,
208,I,"When I go forth to greet the glad-faced Spring,"
209,I,"Just at the time of opening apple-buds,"
210,I,"When brooks are laughing, winds are whispering,"
211,I,"On babbling hillsides or in warbling woods,"
212,I,There is an unseen presence that eludes:--
213,I,"Perhaps a Dryad, in whose tresses cling"
214,I,"The loamy odors of old solitudes,"
215,I,"Who, from her beechen doorway, calls; and leads"
216,I,My soul to follow; now with dimpling words
217,I,Of leaves; and now with syllables of birds;
218,I,While here and there--is it her limbs that swing?
219,I,Or restless sunlight on the moss and weeds?
220,I,
221,I,
222,II,II
223,II,
224,II,
225,II,"Or, haply, 't is a Naiad now who slips,"
226,II,"Like some white lily, from her fountain's glass,"
227,II,"While from her dripping hair and breasts and hips,"
228,II,The moisture rains cool music on the grass.
229,II,"Her have I heard and followed, yet, alas!"
230,II,Have seen no more than the wet ray that dips
231,II,"The shivered waters, wrinkling where I pass;"
232,II,"But, in the liquid light, where she doth hide,"
233,II,I have beheld the azure of her gaze
234,II,"Smiling; and, where the orbing ripple plays,"
235,II,"Among her minnows I have heard her lips,"
236,II,"Bubbling, make merry by the waterside."
237,II,
238,II,
239,III,III
240,III,
241,III,
242,III,Or now it is an Oread--whose eyes
243,III,"Are constellated dusk--who stands confessed,"
244,III,"As naked as a flow'r; her heart's surprise,"
245,III,"Like morning's rose, mantling her brow and breast:"
246,III,"She, shrinking from my presence, all distressed"
247,III,"Stands for a startled moment ere she flies,"
248,III,"Her deep hair blowing, up the mountain crest,"
249,III,Wild as a mist that trails along the dawn.
250,III,And is't her footfalls lure me? or the sound
251,III,Of airs that stir the crisp leaf on the ground?
252,III,And is't her body glimmers on yon rise?
253,III,Or dog-wood blossoms snowing on the lawn?
254,III,
255,III,
256,IV,IV
257,IV,
258,IV,
259,IV,Now't is a Satyr piping serenades
260,IV,On a slim reed. Now Pan and Faun advance
261,IV,"Beneath green-hollowed roofs of forest glades,"
262,IV,"Their feet gone mad with music: now, perchance,"
263,IV,"Sylvanus sleeping, on whose leafy trance"
264,IV,The Nymphs stand gazing in dim ambuscades
265,IV,"Of sun-embodied perfume.--Myth, Romance,"
266,IV,"Where'er I turn, reach out bewildering arms,"
267,IV,Compelling me to follow. Day and night
268,IV,I hear their voices and behold the light
269,IV,"Of their divinity that still evades,"
270,IV,And still allures me in a thousand forms.

279,I,
280,I,
281,I,"What wood-god, on this water's mossy curb,"
282,I,"Lost in reflections of earth's loveliness,"
283,I,"Did I, just now, unconsciously disturb?"
284,I,"I, who haphazard, wandering at a guess,"
285,I,"Came on this spot, wherein, with gold and flame"
286,I,"Of buds and blooms, the season writes its name.--"
287,I,"Ah, me! could I have seen him ere alarm"
288,I,Of my approach aroused him from his calm!
289,I,"As he, part Hamadryad and, mayhap,"
290,I,"Part Faun, lay here; who left the shadow warm"
291,I,"As wildwood rose, and filled the air with balm"
292,I,Of his sweet breath as with ethereal sap.
293,I,
294,I,
295,II,II
296,II,
297,II,
298,II,"Does not the moss retain some vague impress,"
299,II,"Green dented in, of where he lay or trod?"
300,II,"Do not the flow'rs, so reticent, confess"
301,II,With conscious looks the contact of a god?
302,II,Does not the very water garrulously
303,II,Boast the indulgence of a deity?
304,II,"And, hark! in burly beech and sycamore"
305,II,How all the birds proclaim it! and the leaves
306,II,Rejoice with clappings of their myriad hands!
307,II,"And shall not I believe, too, and adore,"
308,II,"With such wide proof?--Yea, though my soul perceives"
309,II,"No evident presence, still it understands."
310,II,
311,II,
312,III,III
313,III,
314,III,
315,III,And for a while it moves me to lie down
316,III,Here on the spot his god-head sanctified:
317,III,Mayhap some dream he dreamed may lingert brown
318,III,"And young as joy, around the forestside;"
319,III,Some dream within whose heart lives no disdain
320,III,For such as I whose love is sweet and sane;
321,III,"That may repeat, so none but I may hear--"
322,III,As one might tell a pearl-strung rosary--
323,III,"Some epic that the trees have learned to croon,"
324,III,"Some lyric whispered in the wild-flower's ear,"
325,III,"Whose murmurous lines are sung by bird and bee,"
326,III,And all the insects of the night and noon.
327,III,
328,III,
329,IV,IV
330,IV,
331,IV,
332,IV,"For, all around me, upon field and hill,"
333,IV,Enchantment lies as of mysterious flutes;
334,IV,As if the music of a god's good-will
335,IV,Had taken on material attributes
336,IV,"In blooms, like chords; and in the water-gleam,"
337,IV,That runs its silvery scales from stream to stream;
338,IV,"In sunbeam bars, up which the butterfly,"
339,IV,"A golden note, vibrates then flutters on--"
340,IV,"Inaudible tunes, blown on the pipes of Pan,"
341,IV,"That have assumed a visible entity,"
342,IV,"And drugged the air with beauty so, a Faun,"
343,IV,"Behold, I seem, and am no more a man."

349,IV,Rain-Crow_
350,IV,
351,I,I
352,I,
353,I,
354,I,"Can freckled August,--drowsing warm and blonde"
355,I,"Beside a wheat-shock in the white-topped mead,"
356,I,"In her hot hair the oxeyed daisies wound,--"
357,I,"O bird of rain, lend aught but sleepy heed"
358,I,"To thee? when no plumed weed, no feather'd seed"
359,I,"Blows by her; and no ripple breaks the pond,"
360,I,"That gleams like flint between its rim of grasses,"
361,I,Through which the dragonfly forever passes
362,I,Like splintered diamond.
363,I,
364,I,
365,II,II
366,II,
367,II,
368,II,"Drouth weights the trees, and from the farmhouse eaves"
369,II,"The locust, pulse-beat of the summer day,"
370,II,"Throbs; and the lane, that shambles under leaves"
371,II,Limp with the heat--a league of rutty way--
372,II,Is lost in dust; and sultry scents of hay
373,II,Breathe from the panting meadows heaped with sheaves--
374,II,"Now, now, O bird, what hint is there of rain,"
375,II,"In thirsty heaven or on burning plain,"
376,II,That thy keen eye perceives?
377,II,
378,II,
379,III,III
380,III,
381,III,
382,III,But thou art right. Thou prophesiest true.
383,III,"For hardly hast thou ceased thy forecasting,"
384,III,"When, up the western fierceness of scorched blue,"
385,III,Great water-carrier winds their buckets bring
386,III,Brimming with freshness. How their dippers ring
387,III,And flash and rumble! lavishing dark dew
388,III,"On corn and forestland, that, streaming wet,"
389,III,"Their hilly backs against the downpour set,"
390,III,Like giants vague in view.
391,III,
392,III,
393,IV,IV
394,IV,
395,IV,
396,IV,"The butterfly, safe under leaf and flower,"
397,IV,"Has found a roof, knowing how true thou art;"
398,IV,"The bumble-bee, within the last half-hour,"
399,IV,Has ceased to hug the honey to its heart;
400,IV,"While in the barnyard, under shed and cart,"
401,IV,"Brood-hens have housed.--But I, who scorned thy power,"
402,IV,"Barometer of the birds,--like August there,--"
403,IV,"Beneath a beech, dripping from foot to hair,"
404,IV,"Like some drenched truant, cower."

411,IV,
412,I,I
413,I,
414,I,
415,I,"Globed in Heav'n's tree of azure, golden mellow"
416,I,As some round apple hung
417,I,"High in hesperian boughs, thou hangest yellow"
418,I,The branch-like mists among:
419,I,"Within thy light a sunburnt youth, named Health,"
420,I,"Rests 'mid the tasseled shocks, the tawny stubble;"
421,I,"And by his side, clad on with rustic wealth"
422,I,"Of field and farm, beneath thy amber bubble,"
423,I,"A nut-brown maid, Content, sits smiling still:"
424,I,"While through the quiet trees,"
425,I,"The mossy rocks, the grassy hill,"
426,I,"Thy silvery spirit glides to yonder mill,"
427,I,Around whose wheel the breeze
428,I,"And shimmering ripples of the water play,"
429,I,"As, by their mother, little children may."
430,I,
431,I,
432,II,II
433,II,
434,II,
435,II,"Sweet spirit of the moon, who walkest,--lifting"
436,II,"Exhaustless on thy arm,"
437,II,"A pearly vase of fire,--through the shifting"
438,II,"Cloud-halls of calm and storm,"
439,II,"Pour down thy blossoms! let me hear them come,"
440,II,"Pelting with noiseless light the twinkling thickets,"
441,II,Making the darkness audible with the hum
442,II,"Of many insect creatures, grigs and crickets:"
443,II,Until it seems the elves hold revelries
444,II,By haunted stream and grove;
445,II,"Or, in the night's deep peace,"
446,II,The young-old presence of Earth's full increase
447,II,"Seems telling thee her love,"
448,II,"Ere, lying down, she turns to rest, and smiles,"
449,II,Hearing thy heart beat through the myriad miles.

454,II,_The Old
455,II,Water-Mill_
456,II,
457,II,
458,II,"Wild ridge on ridge the wooded hills arise,"
459,II,Between whose breezy vistas gulfs of skies
460,II,"Pilot great clouds like towering argosies,"
461,II,And hawk and buzzard breast the azure breeze.
462,II,With many a foaming fall and glimmering reach
463,II,"Of placid murmur, under elm and beech,"
464,II,The creek goes twinkling through long glows and glooms
465,II,"Of woodland quiet, poppied with perfumes:"
466,II,"The creek, in whose clear shallows minnow-schools"
467,II,Glitter or dart; and by whose deeper pools
468,II,The blue kingfishers and the herons haunt;
469,II,"That, often startled from the freckled flaunt"
470,II,Of blackberry-lilies--where they feed and hide--
471,II,Trail a lank flight along the forestside
472,II,"With eery clangor. Here a sycamore,"
473,II,"Smooth, wave-uprooted, builds from shore to shore"
474,II,"A headlong bridge; and there, a storm-hurled oak"
475,II,"Lays a long dam, where sand and gravel choke"
476,II,The water's lazy way. Here mistflower blurs
477,II,Its bit of heaven; there the oxeye stirs
478,II,"Its gloaming hues of bronze and gold; and here,"
479,II,"A gray cool stain, like dawn's own atmosphere,"
480,II,The dim wild-carrot lifts its crumpled crest:
481,II,"And over all, at slender flight or rest,"
482,II,"The dragon-flies, like coruscating rays"
483,II,"Of lapis-lazuli and chrysoprase,"
484,II,Drowsily sparkle through the summer days;
485,II,"And, dewlap-deep, here from the noontide heat"
486,II,The bell-hung cattle find a cool retreat:
487,II,"And through the willows girdling the hill,"
488,II,"Now far, now near, borne as the soft winds will,"
489,II,Comes the low rushing of the water-mill.
490,II,"Ah, lovely to me from a little child,"
491,II,"How changed the place! wherein once, undefiled,"
492,II,The glad communion of the sky and stream
493,II,Went with me like a presence and a dream.
494,II,Where once the brambled meads and orchardlands
495,II,Poured ripe abundance down with mellow hands
496,II,Of summer; and the birds of field and wood
497,II,Called to me in a tongue I understood;
498,II,And in the tangles of the old rail-fence
499,II,"Even the insect tumult had some sense,"
500,II,And every sound a happy eloquence;
501,II,"And more to me than wisest books can teach,"
502,II,The wind and water said; whose words did reach
503,II,"My soul, addressing their magnificent speech,"
504,II,"Raucous and rushing, from the old mill-wheel,"
505,II,"That made the rolling mill-cogs snore and reel,"
506,II,Like some old ogre in a fairy-tale
507,II,Nodding above his meat and mug of ale.
508,II,
509,II,How memory takes me back the ways that lead--
510,II,As when a boy--through woodland and through mead!
511,II,To orchards fruited; or to fields in bloom;
512,II,"Or briary fallows, like a mighty room,"
513,II,"Through which the winds swing censers of perfume,"
514,II,And where deep blackberries spread miles of fruit;--
515,II,"A splendid feast, that stayed the ploughboy's foot"
516,II,When to the tasseling acres of the corn
517,II,"He drove his team, fresh in the primrose morn;"
518,II,"And from the liberal banquet, nature lent,"
519,II,Took dewy handfuls as he whistling went.--
520,II,A boy once more I stand with sunburnt feet
521,II,And watch the harvester sweep down the wheat;
522,II,Or laze with warm limbs in the unstacked straw
523,II,"Nearby the thresher, whose insatiate maw"
524,II,"Devours the sheaves, hot drawling out its hum--"
525,II,"Like some great sleepy bee, above a bloom,"
526,II,"Made drunk with honey--while, grown big with grain,"
527,II,The bulging sacks receive the golden rain.
528,II,"Again I tread the valley, sweet with hay,"
529,II,"And hear the bob-white calling far away,"
530,II,Or wood-dove cooing in the elder-brake;
531,II,Or see the sassafras bushes madly shake
532,II,"As swift, a rufous instant, in the glen"
533,II,The red-fox leaps and gallops to his den;
534,II,"Or, standing in the violet-colored gloam,"
535,II,Hear roadways sound with holiday riding home

1019,VI,The slender crescent of the moon--
1020,VI,Diana's crystal-kindled crest--
1021,VI,Sinks hillward in a silvery swoon.
1022,VI,What is the murmur in the dell?
1023,VI,The stealthy whisper and the drip?--
1024,VI,A Dryad with her leaf-light trip?
1025,VI,Or Naiad o'er her fountain well?--
1026,VI,"Who, with white fingers for her comb,"
1027,VI,"Sleeks her blue hair, and from its curls"
1028,VI,"Showers slim minnows and pale pearls,"
1029,VI,And hollow music of the foam.
1030,VI,What is it in the vistaed ways
1031,VI,"That leans and springs, and stoops and sways?--"
1032,VI,The naked limbs of one who flees?
1033,VI,An Oread who hesitates
1034,VI,"Before the Satyr form that waits,"
1035,VI,"Crouching to leap, that there she sees?"
1036,VI,"Or under boughs, reclining cool,"

1038,VI,"Of moonlight, palely beautiful?"
1039,VI,"Or Limnad, with her lilied face,"
1040,VI,More lovely than the misty lace
1041,VI,That haunts a star and gives it grace?
1042,VI,"Or is it some Leimoniad,"
1043,VI,In wildwood flowers dimly clad?
1044,VI,Oblong blossoms white as froth;
1045,VI,Or mottled like the tiger-moth;
1046,VI,Or brindled as the brows of death;
1047,VI,Wild of hue and wild of breath.
1048,VI,Here ethereal flame and milk
1049,VI,Blent with velvet and with silk;
1050,VI,Here an iridescent glow
1051,VI,Mixed with satin and with snow:
1052,VI,"Pansy, poppy and the pale"
1053,VI,Serpolet and galingale;
1054,VI,"Mandrake and anemone,"

1074,VI,Breasting through the dewy glooms--
1075,VI,Through the glow-worm gleams and glowers
1076,VI,Of the starlight;--wood-perfumes
1077,VI,Swoon around her and frail showers
1078,VI,Of the leaflet-tilted rain.

1083,VI,"Honeyed pungence of her kiss,"
1084,VI,And her auburn tresses wreathing
1085,VI,"Like umbrageous helichrys,"

1087,VI,"In the moon's ambrosial glow,"
1088,VI,Both her shapely loins low-looped
1089,VI,"With the balmy blossoms, drooped,"

1091,VI,"Spiritual yet sensual,"

1094,VI,"Her delicious body there,--"
1095,VI,"Raimented with amorous air,--"
1096,VI,To my mind expresses all
1097,VI,The allurements of the world.

1100,VI,"All the passionate past.--I reel,"
1101,VI,"Greek again in ancient Greece,"
1102,VI,In the Pyrrhic revelries;
1103,VI,In the mad and Mænad dance
1104,VI,Onward dragged with violence;
1105,VI,Pan and old Silenus and
1106,VI,Faunus and a Bacchant band
1107,VI,Round me. Wild my wine-stained hand
1108,VI,O'er tumultuous hair is lifted;
1109,VI,While the flushed and Phallic orgies
1110,VI,Whirl around me; and the marges
1111,VI,Of the wood are torn and rifted
1112,VI,With lascivious laugh and shout.

1114,VI,"Shameless with the shameless rout,"

1123,VI,So it seems. Yet woods are lonely.
1124,VI,"And when I again awake,"
1125,VI,I shall find their faces only
1126,VI,Moonbeams in the boughs that shake;
1127,VI,"And their revels, but the rush"
1128,VI,Of night-winds through bough and brush.
1129,VI,Yet my dreaming--is it more
1130,VI,Than mere dreaming? Is some door
1131,VI,Opened in my soul? a curtain

1545,VI,
1546,VI,"With its mediaeval streets, that crook,"
1547,VI,"And its gabled houses, it has the look"
1548,VI,Of a belfried town in a fairy-book.
1549,VI,
1550,VI,"So wild the Tyrol that oft, 'tis said,"
1551,VI,"When the storm is out and the town in bed,"
1552,VI,The howling of wolves sweeps overhead.
1553,VI,
1554,VI,"And oft the burgher, sitting here"
1555,VI,"In his walled rose-garden, hears the clear"
1556,VI,Shrill scream of the eagle circling near.
1557,VI,
1558,VI,And this is the tale that the burghers tell:--
1559,VI,The Abbot of Wiltau stood at his cell
1560,VI,Where the Solstein lifts its pinnacle.
1561,VI,
1562,VI,A mighty summit of bluffs and crags
1563,VI,That frowns on the Inn; where the forest stags
1564,VI,Have worn a path to the water-flags.
1565,VI,
1566,VI,The Abbot of Wiltau stood below;
1567,VI,And he was aware of a plume and bow
1568,VI,On the precipice there in the morning's glow.
1569,VI,
1570,VI,"A chamois, he saw, from span to span"
1571,VI,Had leapt; and after it leapt a man;
1572,VI,And he knew 't was the Kaiser Maxmilian.
1573,VI,
1574,VI,"But, see! though rash as the chamois he,"
1575,VI,His foot less sure. And verily
1576,VI,"If the King should miss ... ""Jesu, Marie!"
1577,VI,
1578,VI,"""The King hath missed!""--And, look, he falls!"
1579,VI,Rolls headlong out to the headlong walls.
1580,VI,What saint shall save him on whom he calls?
1581,VI,
1582,VI,"What saint shall save him, who struggles there"
1583,VI,"On the narrow ledge by the eagle's lair,"
1584,VI,With hooked hands clinging 'twixt earth and air?
1585,VI,
1586,VI,"The Abbot, he crosses himself in dread--"
1587,VI,"""Let prayers go up for the nearly dead,"
1588,VI,"And the passing-bell be tolled,"" he said."
1589,VI,
1590,VI,"""For the House of Hapsburg totters; see,"
1591,VI,"How raveled the thread of its destiny,"
1592,VI,"Sheer hung between cloud and rock!"" quoth he."
1593,VI,
1594,VI,"But hark! where the steeps of the peak reply,"
1595,VI,Is it an eagle's echoing cry?
1596,VI,"And the flitting shadow, its plumes on high?"
1597,VI,
1598,VI,No voice of the eagle is that which rings!
1599,VI,"And the shadow, a wiry man who swings"
1600,VI,"Down, down where the desperate Kaiser clings."
1601,VI,
1602,VI,"The _crampons_ bound to his feet, he leaps"
1603,VI,Like a chamois now; and again he creeps
1604,VI,"Or twists, like a snake, o'er the fearful deeps."

1606,VI,"""By his cross-bow, baldrick, and cap's black curl,"""
1607,VI,"Quoth the Abbot below, ""I know the churl!"
1608,VI,'T is the hunted outlaw Zyps of Zirl.
1609,VI,
1610,VI,"""Upon whose head, or dead or alive,"
1611,VI,The Kaiser hath posted a price.--Saints shrive

1614,VI,"""To save him now that his foe is there?""--"
1615,VI,"But, listen! again through the breathless air"
1616,VI,What words are those that the echoes bear?
1617,VI,
1618,VI,"""Courage, my King!--To the rescue, ho!"""
1619,VI,"The wild voice rings like a twanging bow,"
1620,VI,And the staring Abbot stands mute below.
1621,VI,
1622,VI,"And, lo! the hand of the outlaw grasps"
1623,VI,The arm of the King--and death unclasps
1624,VI,Its fleshless fingers from him who gasps.
1625,VI,
1626,VI,And how he guides! where the clean cliffs wedge
1627,VI,Them flat to their faces; by chasm and ledge
1628,VI,He helps the King from the merciless edge.
1629,VI,
1630,VI,"Then up and up, past bluffs that shun"
1631,VI,The rashest chamois; where eagles sun
1632,VI,Fierce wings and brood; where the mists are spun.
1633,VI,

1652,VI,No thing was awake but the lone whippoorwill.
1653,VI,
1654,VI,And haunted of thoughts for an hour I sat
1655,VI,On a lichen-gray rock where the moss was a mat.

1657,VI,"And thinking of one whom my heart had held dear,"
1658,VI,"Like terrible waters, a gathering fear."
1659,VI,
1660,VI,Came stealing upon me with all the distress
1661,VI,Of loss and of yearning and powerlessness:
1662,VI,
1663,VI,Till the hopes and the doubts and the sleepless unrest
1664,VI,"That, swallow-like, built in the home of my breast,"
1665,VI,
1666,VI,"Now hither, now thither, now heavenward flew,"
1667,VI,Wild-winged as the winds are: now suddenly drew
1668,VI,

1670,VI,"All light was a shadow, all hope, a despair:"
1671,VI,
1672,VI,"Where truth, that religion had set upon high,"
1673,VI,The darkness distorted and changed to a lie:
1674,VI,
1675,VI,And dreams of the beauty ambition had fed
1676,VI,Like leaves of the autumn fell blighted and dead.
1677,VI,
1678,VI,"And I rose with my burden of anguish and doom,"
1679,VI,"And cried, ""O my God, had I died in the womb!"
1680,VI,
1681,VI,"""Than born into night, with no hope of the morn,"
1682,VI,"An heir unto shadows, to live so forlorn!"

1691,VI,"From Earth not from Heaven--a glimmering flame,"
1692,VI,
1693,VI,"Behold, at my feet! In the shadow it shone"
1694,VI,Mysteriously lovely and dimly alone:
1695,VI,
1696,VI,An ember; a sparkle of dew and of glower;
1697,VI,Like the lamp that a spirit hangs under a flower:

1700,VI,A fairy may wear in her diadem's bar:

1702,VI,An element essence of moonlight and dawn
1703,VI,"That, trodden and trampled, burns on and burns on."
1704,VI,

1706,VI,That God had revealed to me there in the night:
1707,VI,

1709,VI,The spiritual message of worm unto worm.

3533,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,Cawein's productions.... But the appreciation of his poetry has never
3534,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,been as great as its merits would indicate. His poems are rather _too

3542,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,saturated with the classical spirit or that his native instincts have
3543,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,"been supplanted with Greek exotics and flowers out of the renaissance,"
3544,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,but rather that his own mental constitution is of a classical as well

3547,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,"""The themes of Cawein's poetry are generally taken from the world of"

3551,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,the East. He is the Omar Khayyam of the Ohio Valley. He is as much of
3552,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,a Mohammedan as a Christian. He knows the son of Abdallah better than
3553,SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES,he knows Cromwell; and has more sympathy with a Khalif than with a
