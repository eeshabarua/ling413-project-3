28,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET
29,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
30,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,I lived far more than e'er I sang;
31,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Thought, ire, and mirth unceasing rang"
32,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Around me, where I guested;"
33,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,To be where loud life's battles call
34,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,For me was well-nigh more than all
35,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,My pen on page arrested.
36,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
37,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"What's true and strong has growing-room,"
38,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"And will perhaps eternal bloom,"
39,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Without black ink's salvation,"
40,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"And he will be, who least it planned,"
41,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"But in life's surging dared to stand,"
42,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,The best bard for his nation.
43,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
44,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,A life seventy-seven years long and but two hundred pages of
45,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"lyrical production, more than half of which was written in about"
46,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,a dozen years!  The seeming disproportion is explained by the
47,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"lines just quoted from the poem _Good Cheer_, with which Björnson"
48,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,concluded the first edition of his _Poems and Songs_.  Alongside
49,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"of these stanzas, in which the cause of his popularity and powerful"
50,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"influence is also unconsciously revealed, may well be placed the"
51,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"following one from _The Poet_, which discloses to us the larger"
52,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,conception of the mission that Björnson himself in all his work
53,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"and life, no less than in his lyrics, so finely fulfilled:"
54,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
55,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,The poet does the prophet's deeds;
56,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"In times of need with new life pregnant,"
57,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"When strife and suffering are regnant,"
58,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,His faith with light ideal leads.
59,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"The past its heroes round him posts,"
60,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"He rallies now the present's hosts,"
61,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,The future opes
62,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Before his eyes,"
63,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,Its pictured hopes
64,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,He prophesies.
65,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,Ever his people's forces vernal
66,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"The poet frees, --by right eternal."
67,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
68,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"""The best bard for his nation"" is he who ""does the prophet's"
69,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"deeds,"" who ""rallies now the present's hosts,"" and ""frees,"
70,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"--by right eternal.""  Poet and prophet Björnson was, but more"
71,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"than all else the leader of the Norwegian people, ""where loud"
72,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"life's battles call,"" through conflict unto liberation and growth."
73,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,It has been said that twice in the nineteenth century the national
74,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"soul of Norway embodied itself in individual men,--during the"
75,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,first half in Henrik Wergeland and during the second half in
76,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Björnstjerne Björnson.  True as this is of the former, it is"
77,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"still more true of the latter, for the history of Norway shows"
78,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,that the soul of its people expresses itself best through will
79,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,and action.  Björnson throughout all his life willed and wrought
80,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"so much for his country, that he could give relatively little"
81,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,time and power to lyrical self-expression.
82,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
83,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,But Björnson strikingly represented the past of Norway as well
84,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,as his contemporary age.  He was a modern blending of the heroic
85,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,chieftain and the gifted skald of ancient times.  He was the first
86,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,leader of his country in a period when the battles of the spirit
87,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"on the fields of politics and economics, ethics, and esthetics"
88,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"were the only form of conflict,--a leader evoking, developing,"
89,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,and guiding the powers of his nation into fuller and higher life.
90,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,In his many-sidedness Björnson was also in his time the first
91,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"skald of his people, almost equally endowed with genius as a"
92,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"narrative, a dramatic, and a lyric poet; with talents scarcely"
93,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"less remarkable as an orator, a theater-director, a journalistic"
94,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"tribune of the people (his newspaper articles amounted, roughly"
95,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"estimated, to ten thousand book-pages), a letter-writer, and a"
96,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,conversationalist.
97,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
98,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"If, furthermore, we take into account also Björnson's labors and"
99,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"achievements in the domain of action more narrowly considered, it"
100,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,is no wonder that his _Poems and Songs_ make only a small volume.
101,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Examining the book more closely, we find that three-quarters of"
102,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"its pages were written before the year 1875, so that the lyrical"
103,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"output, here published, of the thirty-four years thereafter"
104,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,amounts to but fifty pages.  From the year 1874 on in Björnson's
105,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"life the chieftain supplanted the skald, so far as lyrical"
106,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,utterance was concerned.  He was leading his nation in thought and
107,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"action on the fields of theology and religion, of politics, economics,"
108,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"and social reform; he was tireless in making speeches, in writing"
109,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,letters and newspaper articles; his poetic genius flowed out
110,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,copiously in the dramatic and epic channels of his numerous modern
111,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"plays, novels, and stories."
112,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
113,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,That soon after 1874 Björnson passed through a crisis in his
114,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"personal thought and inner life was probably, in view of the"
115,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"sufficient explanation suggested above, without influence in"
116,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,lessening his production of short poems.  This crisis was in his
117,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,religious beliefs. His father was a clergyman in the Lutheran State
118,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Church, and from his home in western Norway Björnson brought with"
119,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,him to Christiania in 1850 fervent Christian faith of the older
120,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,orthodox sort.  Here his somewhat somber religion was soon made
121,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"brighter and more tender by the adoption of Grundtvig's teachings,"
122,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,and until past mid-life he remained a sincere Christian in the fullest
123,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"sense, as is repeatedly shown in his lyrics.  But in the years"
124,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"just before 1877 study of modern science and philosophy, of the"
125,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"history of the Church and dogma, led him to become an evolutionist,"
126,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"an agnostic theist.  Nevertheless, he ever practiced the Christian"
127,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"art of life, as he tried to realize his ideals of truth, justice,"
128,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"and love of humanity.  This large and simple Christian art of life,"
129,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"in distinction from the dogmas of the Church, he early sung in"
130,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,lines which sound no less true to the keynote of his later years:
131,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
132,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Love thy neighbor, to Christ be leal!"
133,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Crush him never with iron-heel,"
134,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,Though in the dust he's lying!
135,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,All the living responsive await
136,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,"Love with power to recreate,"
137,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,Needing alone the trying.
138,BJÖRNSON AS A LYRIC POET,
139,II,II
140,II,
141,II,"The quantity, then, of Björnson's short poems is small.  Their"
142,II,intrinsic worth is great.  Their influence in Norway has been broad
143,II,"and deep, they are known and loved by all.  If lyrical means only"
144,II,"melodious, ""singable,"" they possess high poetic value and distinction."
145,II,In a unique degree they have inspired composers of music to pour out
146,II,"their strains.  When a Scandinavian reads Björnson's poems, his ears"
147,II,ring with the familiar melodies into which they have almost sung
148,II,themselves.
149,II,
150,II,Here is not the place for technical analysis of the external poetic
151,II,forms.  A cursory inspection will show that Björnson's are wonderfully
152,II,"varied, and that the same form is seldom, if ever, precisely duplicated."
153,II,"In rhythm and alliteration, rhyme sequence and the grouping of lines into"
154,II,"stanzas, the form in each case seems to be determined by the content,"
155,II,"naturally, spontaneously.  Yet for one who has intimately studied these"
156,II,"verses until his mind and heart vibrate responsively, the words of all"
157,II,"have an indefinable melody of their own, as it were, one dominant melody,"
158,II,"distinctly Björnsonian.  This unity in variety, spontaneous and"
159,II,"characteristic, is not found in the earlier poems not included in this"
160,II,"volume.  So far as is known, Björnson's first printed poem appeared in a"
161,II,newspaper in 1852.  It and other youthful rhymes of that time extant in
162,II,"manuscript, and still others as late as 1854, are interesting by reason"
163,II,of their contrast with his later manner; the verse-form has nothing
164,II,"personal, the melodies are those of older poets.  It is in the lyrics"
165,II,"of _Synnöve Solbakken_, written in 1857 or just before, that Björnson"
166,II,for the first time sings in his own forms his own melody.
167,II,
168,II,Style and diction are the determining factors in the poetic form of
169,II,"lyric verse, along with the perhaps indistinguishable and indefinable"
170,II,quality of melodiousness.  Of Björnson's style or manner in the larger
171,II,sense it must be said that it is not subjectively lyrical.  He is not
172,II,disposed to introspective dwelling on his own emotions and to profuse
173,II,self-expression without a conscious purpose.  In general he must have
174,II,"some definite objective end in view, some occasion to celebrate for"
175,II,"others, some ""cause"" to champion, the mood of another person or of"
176,II,"other persons, real or fictitious, to reproduce synthetically in a"
177,II,"combination of thoughts, feelings, similes, and sounds.  In his"
178,II,"verses words do not breed words, nor figures beget figures unto lyric"
179,II,"breadth and vagueness.  When Björnson was moved to make a poem, he was"
180,II,"so filled with the end, the occasion, the cause, the mood to be"
181,II,"reproduced, that he was impatient of any but the most significant"
182,II,words and left much to suggestion.  Often the words seem to be in one
183,II,"another's way, and they are not related with grammatical precision."
184,II,Thus in the original more than in the translation of the poem
185,II,"_Norway, Norway!_ the first strophe of which is:"
186,II,"Norway, Norway,"
187,II,"Rising in blue from the sea's gray and green,"
188,II,"Islands around like fledglings tender,"
189,II,Fjord-tongues with slender
190,II,Tapering tips in the silence seen.
191,II,"Rivers, valleys,"
192,II,"Mate among mountains, wood-ridge and slope"
193,II,"Wandering follow.  Where the wastes lighten,"
194,II,"Lake and plain brighten,"
195,II,Hallow a temple of peace and hope.
196,II,"Norway, Norway,"
197,II,"Houses and huts, not castles grand,"
198,II,"Gentle or hard,"
199,II,"Thee we guard, thee we guard,"
200,II,"Thee, our future's fair land."
201,II,
202,II,"Such abrupt brevity of expression, not uncommon among Norwegian"
203,II,"peasants, was no doubt natural to Björnson, but was confirmed by"
204,II,the influence of the Old Norse sagas and skaldic poetry.  The
205,II,"latter may also have increased his use of alliteration, masterly"
206,II,"not only in the direct imitation of the old form, as in _Bergliot_,"
207,II,but also in the enrichment of the music of his rhymed verse in
208,II,modern forms. Conciseness of style in thought and word permitted
209,II,no lyrical elaboration of figures or descriptions; it restricted
210,II,"the poet to brief hints of the ways his spirit would go, and along"
211,II,which he wished to guide that of the hearer or reader.  Herein is
212,II,the source of much of the power of Björnson's patriotic songs and
213,II,poems of public agitation.  Those who read or hear or sing them
214,II,"are made to think, or at least to feel, the unwritten poetry"
215,II,between the lines.  Scarcely less notable is this paucity in the
216,II,expression of wealth of thought and feeling in the memorial and
217,II,other more individual poems.
218,II,
219,II,Björnson's diction corresponds to the quality of style thus
220,II,briefly characterized.  The modern Norwegian language has no
221,II,"considerable, highly developed special vocabulary for poetic use."
222,II,From the diction of prose the poet must quarry and carve the verbal
223,II,"material for his verse.  It sometimes seems, indeed, as if it were"
224,II,"hard for Björnson to find the right block and fit it, nicely cut,"
225,II,into his line.  In describing his diction critics have used the
226,II,"figures of hewing and of hammer-strokes, but then have said that"
227,II,it is not so much laborious effort we hear as the natural falling
228,II,into place of words heavy with thought and feeling.  Here it is
229,II,that translation must so often come short of faithful reproduction.
230,II,The choice of words in relation to rhythm and euphony is a mystery
231,II,difficult to interpret even in the poet's own language.  If we
232,II,"try to analyze the verse of great poets, we frequently find, beyond"
233,II,"what is evidently the product of conscious design, effects of"
234,II,suggestion and sound which could not be calculated and designed.
235,II,The verbal material seems hardly to be amenable to the poet's
236,II,"control, but rather to be chosen, shaped, and placed involuntarily"
237,II,by the thought and the mood.  _The Ocean_ is a good example of
238,II,the distinctive power and beauty of Björnson's diction.
239,II,
240,II,"Such, then, in melody, rhythm, style, and diction is the form of"
241,II,"Björnson's verse: compact, reticent, suggestive, without elaborate"
242,II,"verbal ornamentation, strong with ""the long-vibrating power of the"
243,II,"deeply felt, but half-expressed.""  It challenges and stimulates"
244,II,the soul of the hearer or reader to an intense activity of
245,II,"appropriation, which brings a fine reward."
246,II,
247,III,III
248,III,
249,III,"What, now, is the content that finds expression in this form?"
250,III,"As we turn the pages from the beginning, we first meet lyrics that"
251,III,"may be called personal, not utterances of Björnson's individual"
252,III,"self, but taken from his early tales and the drama _Halte Hulda_,"
253,III,"with strains of love, of religious faith, of dread of nature, and"
254,III,"of joy in it, of youthful longing; then after two patriotic choral"
255,III,songs and a second group of similar personal poems from _A Happy Boy_
256,III,"follow one on a patriotic subject with historical allusions, a"
257,III,"memorial poem on J. L. Heiberg, and one descriptive, indeed, of"
258,III,"the ocean, but filled with the human feelings and longings it arouses;"
259,III,"then come a lyric personal to Björnson, and one that is not.  As we"
260,III,"progress, we pass through a similar succession of descriptive,"
261,III,"personal, or memorial poems, some of religious faith, historical"
262,III,"ballads, lyrical romances, patriotic and festival choral songs,"
263,III,"poems in celebration of individual men and women, living or dead,"
264,III,"and towards the end poems, like the _Psalms_, of deep philosophic"
265,III,thought suffused with emotion.
266,III,
267,III,Now these subjects may be gathered into a small number of groups:
268,III,"love, religious faith and thought, moods personal to the poet,"
269,III,"patriotism,--love of country, striving for its welfare, pride in"
270,III,"Norway's history, and joy in the beauty and grandeur of its scenery."
271,III,"The occasional songs and poems in celebration of great personalities,"
272,III,"--whether they were of high station and renown, or lowly and unfamed,"
273,III,"--or for festivals, earnest or jovial, are nearly all conceived in the"
274,III,"spirit of patriotism,--love of Norway, its historic past, its present,"
275,III,"its future.  They may be social songs memorial or political poems,"
276,III,"ballads or lyrical romances,--all are inspired by and inspire love of country."
277,III,
278,III,Not very many of Björnson's lyrics have love as their subject. From
279,III,"his tales, novels, and dramas we know that his understanding of love"
280,III,"was comprehensive and subtle, yet this volume contains but few of"
281,III,"the love-lyrics of strong emotion, which Björnson must have felt,"
282,III,if not written.  He was a man of will and action with altruistic
283,III,ideals; sexual love could not be the whole nor the center of life
284,III,for him.
285,III,
286,III,"Nor are the purely religious poems numerous, although Christian faith"
287,III,is at once the ground and the atmosphere of his lyrics in the earlier
288,III,"period, and some of the latest are expressions of a broad and deep"
289,III,"philosophy of life.  ""Love thy neighbor!"" and ""Light, Love, Life"" in"
290,III,"deeds were characteristic of Björnson, rather than the utterance of"
291,III,passive meditations of a theoretic nature on God and man's relation to Him.
292,III,
293,III,Björnson's unfailing bent towards activity in behalf of others could
294,III,not favor either the lyric outpouring of other purely personal moods.
295,III,Such purely personal poems are then also relatively rare.  Some of
296,III,"them, however, are most beautiful and deeply moving.  Generally he"
297,III,frees himself in an epic or dramatic way from subjective introspection;
298,III,he projects his feeling into another personality or sends it forth
299,III,"in choral song in terms of ""we"" and ""our.""  The moods he does express"
300,III,more directly for himself are vague youthful longing for the great
301,III,"and the instant, joyous trustfulness even in adversity and under"
302,III,"criticism, love of parents, wife, family, and friends, faith in the"
303,III,future and in the power of the good to prevail.
304,III,
305,III,By far the largest number of the _Poems and Songs_ have as their
306,III,"subject patriotism in the broadest sense, a theme at once simple and"
307,III,complex.  It is in them that the skald and chieftain so typically
308,III,blend in one.  Of this group the influence has been widest and
309,III,deepest.  In his oration at the unveiling of the statue of Wergeland
310,III,"in Christiania, Björnson spoke of him and of Norway's constitution"
311,III,as growing up together; with reference to this it has been maintained
312,III,that we have still greater right to say that Björnson and Norway's
313,III,full freedom and independence grew up together.  The truth of the
314,III,statement is very largely due to Björnson's patriotic poems.  Through
315,III,them the poet-prophet interpreted for his nation the historic past
316,III,"and the evolving present, and forecast the future.  Simplifying"
317,III,"the meaning of life, he accomplished the mission which he himself"
318,III,"made the ideal of _The Poet_, and became for his own people the"
319,III,"liberalizing teacher and molder, leading them to freedom in thought"
320,III,"and action, in social and political life.  Of this large and seemingly"
321,III,"complex group of patriotic lyrics,--whether they be on its history,"
322,III,or on contemporaneous events and deeds of individuals with political
323,III,"significance; or on men, both known and unknown to fame, who had made"
324,III,"and were making Norway great; or on historical, political, and other"
325,III,"national festivals; or on the country, its land and sea and fjords and"
326,III,"forests and fields and cities, in aspects more genial or more stern,"
327,III,"--whether they be poems of the individual or social and choral songs,"
328,III,"manorial poems or ballads or lyrical romances, or descriptions of"
329,III,"Norway's scenery,--the unifying simple theme is Norway to be loved"
330,III,and labored for.
331,III,
332,III,"Not a single poem is, however, merely descriptive of external nature."
333,III,Björnson's relation to nature is indeed more intimate than that of
334,III,"any other Norwegian writer of his time, but here also he is epic and"
335,III,dramatic rather than subjectively lyrical.  He sees and hears through
336,III,"what is external, and his feeling for and with nature is but a"
337,III,profounder looking into the soul of his nation or the inner life of
338,III,other human beings.  For him Norway's scenery is filled with the
339,III,"glory of the nation's past, the promise of its future, or the needs"
340,III,of the present.  The poems that contain nature descriptions are
341,III,"primarily patriotic.  In the national hymn _Yes, We Love_, it is the"
342,III,"nation, its history and its future, which with the land towers as a"
343,III,"whole before his vision; in _Romsdal_ the scenery frames the people,"
344,III,"their character and life.  More personal poems, as _To Molde_ or"
345,III,"_A Meeting_, are not merely descriptive; in the former childhood's"
346,III,"memories and the love of friends fill the scene, while in the latter"
347,III,the freshly and tenderly drawn snow-landscape is but the setting for
348,III,a vivid picture of a deceased friend.
349,III,
350,III,"The contents of this volume befit the verse-form, as if each were"
351,III,"made by and for the other.  The subjects are simple, large, weighty;"
352,III,"the form is compact, strong, suggestive.  Björnson is distinctly not"
353,III,"subjectively lyrical, but has a place in the first rank ""as a choral"

1964,BERGLIOT,
1965,BERGLIOT,Odin in Valhall I dare not beseech;
1966,BERGLIOT,For him I forsook in days of childhood.

1968,BERGLIOT,All that I had He has taken!
1969,BERGLIOT,
1970,BERGLIOT,Vengeance? Who speaks of vengeance?
1971,BERGLIOT,"Can vengeance the dead awaken,"
1972,BERGLIOT,Or cover me warm from the cold?

1981,BERGLIOT,Drive slowly! For so drove Einar always;
1982,BERGLIOT,--Soon enough we shall come home.
1983,BERGLIOT,
1984,BERGLIOT,"The dogs to-day will not greet us gladly,"
1985,BERGLIOT,But drearily howl with drooping tails.
1986,BERGLIOT,And lifting their heads the horses will listen;
1987,BERGLIOT,"Neighing they stand, the stable-door watching,"
1988,BERGLIOT,Eindride's voice awaiting.
1989,BERGLIOT,
1990,BERGLIOT,"In vain for his voice will they hearken,"
1991,BERGLIOT,"Nor hears the hall the step of Einar,"
1992,BERGLIOT,"That called before him for all to arise and stand,"

2399,P. A. MUNCH,"Sure and safe for years a hundred,"
2400,P. A. MUNCH,Doubt possessed him as he burrowed
2401,P. A. MUNCH,Day and night -- and saw it vanish!
2402,P. A. MUNCH,But the unrest that gave power
2403,P. A. MUNCH,Made him oft the goal pass over;
2404,P. A. MUNCH,"While to others he gave clearness,"
2405,P. A. MUNCH,Intuitions new deceived him.
2406,P. A. MUNCH,"Therefore: where he once had striven,"
2407,P. A. MUNCH,"Thither he would turn him never,"
2408,P. A. MUNCH,"Changed his ground and shifted labor,"
2409,P. A. MUNCH,From his own thought-conquests fleeing.
2410,P. A. MUNCH,"But his thoughts pursued, untiring,"
2411,P. A. MUNCH,"Followed, growing, as the fire,"
2412,P. A. MUNCH,"Kindled in Brazilian forests,"
2413,P. A. MUNCH,Storm-wind makes and storm-wind follows!
2414,P. A. MUNCH,"Where before no foot had trodden,"
2415,P. A. MUNCH,Ways were burned for many millions!
2416,P. A. MUNCH,
2417,P. A. MUNCH,Northward stretches Scandinavia
2418,P. A. MUNCH,"'Mid the fog that dims the Ice-sea,"
2419,P. A. MUNCH,Darkness of the months of winter
2420,P. A. MUNCH,Lays its weight on sea and mountain.
2421,P. A. MUNCH,Like our lands are too our peoples.
2422,P. A. MUNCH,Their beginnings prehistoric
2423,P. A. MUNCH,Stretch afar in fog and darkness.
2424,P. A. MUNCH,"But as through the fog a lighthouse,"
2425,P. A. MUNCH,"Or as Northern Lights o'er darkness,"
2426,P. A. MUNCH,Gleamed his thought with light and guidance.
2427,P. A. MUNCH,When with filial fond remembrance
2428,P. A. MUNCH,"Tenderly he sought and questioned,"
2429,P. A. MUNCH,Searching for his people's pathways--
2430,P. A. MUNCH,"Names and graves and rusty weapons,"
2431,P. A. MUNCH,Stones and tools their answer gave him.
2432,P. A. MUNCH,"Through primeval Asian forests,"
2433,P. A. MUNCH,"Over steppes and sands of deserts,"
2434,P. A. MUNCH,"'Neath a thousand years that moldered,"
2435,P. A. MUNCH,Saw he caravan-made footsteps
2436,P. A. MUNCH,Seek a new home in the Northland.
2437,P. A. MUNCH,"And as they the rivers followed,"
2438,P. A. MUNCH,"Followed them his thought abundant,"
2439,P. A. MUNCH,Into Nature's All full-flowing.--
2440,P. A. MUNCH,
2441,P. A. MUNCH,See his restless soul's creation!
2442,P. A. MUNCH,"Harmony of truth he yearned for,"
2443,P. A. MUNCH,"Found it not, but wonder-working"
2444,P. A. MUNCH,"New discoveries and pathways,"
2445,P. A. MUNCH,--Like those alchemists aforetime
2446,P. A. MUNCH,"Who, though gold was all their seeking,"
2447,P. A. MUNCH,"Found not that, but mighty forces,"

2451,P. A. MUNCH,
2452,P. A. MUNCH,Deepest ground of all his being
2453,P. A. MUNCH,"Was the polar power of contrast,"
2454,P. A. MUNCH,"For his thought, to music wakened"
2455,P. A. MUNCH,"By the touch of _Northern Saga_,"
2456,P. A. MUNCH,"Vibrated melodious longing,"

2460,P. A. MUNCH,With the free improvisator
2461,P. A. MUNCH,In the land of warmth and vineyards.
2462,P. A. MUNCH,And his swiftly changing feeling
2463,P. A. MUNCH,"And his all-consuming ardor,"
2464,P. A. MUNCH,That could toil the livelong winter
2465,P. A. MUNCH,"Till caprice the fruit discarded,--"
2466,P. A. MUNCH,That immeasurable richness
2467,P. A. MUNCH,"Wherein thoughts and moods and music,"
2468,P. A. MUNCH,"Joy and sorrow, jest and earnest,"
2469,P. A. MUNCH,"Gleamed and played without cessation,--"
2470,P. A. MUNCH,All a Southern day resembled!
2471,P. A. MUNCH,
2472,P. A. MUNCH,"Therefore was his life a journey,"
2473,P. A. MUNCH,"Towards the South in constant movement,--"
2474,P. A. MUNCH,"Through the mists of intuition,"
2475,P. A. MUNCH,"From the darker to the brighter,"
2476,P. A. MUNCH,"From the colder to the warmer,--"
2477,P. A. MUNCH,On the bridge of ceaseless labor
2478,P. A. MUNCH,Bearing over sea and mountain!
2479,P. A. MUNCH,
2480,P. A. MUNCH,"Oh, the time with wife beside him"
2481,P. A. MUNCH,And his bonny playmate-sisters

2486,P. A. MUNCH,"As from history's very fountain,"
2487,P. A. MUNCH,Knowledge wells in streams of fullness;--
2488,P. A. MUNCH,Where a clearness large and cloudless
2489,P. A. MUNCH,Falls upon the bygone ages
2490,P. A. MUNCH,That have laid them down to rest here;--
2491,P. A. MUNCH,"Where to him, the Northern searcher,"

2493,P. A. MUNCH,"Too long lost in history's fogland,"
2494,P. A. MUNCH,Rowing round the deep fjords' surface;--
2495,P. A. MUNCH,Stood where dead men burst the earth-clods
2496,P. A. MUNCH,And themselves come forth for witness
2497,P. A. MUNCH,In their heavy marble togas;--
2498,P. A. MUNCH,Where the goddesses of Delos
2499,P. A. MUNCH,"In the frescoed halls are dancing,"
2500,P. A. MUNCH,As two thousand years before now;--
2501,P. A. MUNCH,Pantheon and Coliseum
2502,P. A. MUNCH,In their spacious fate have sheltered
2503,P. A. MUNCH,All the world's swift evolution;--
2504,P. A. MUNCH,Where a Hermes from that corner
2505,P. A. MUNCH,"Saw the footsteps firm of Cato,"
2506,P. A. MUNCH,"Pontifex in the procession,--"
2507,P. A. MUNCH,Saw then Nero as Apollo
2508,P. A. MUNCH,"Lifted up take sacrifices,"
2509,P. A. MUNCH,"Saw then Gregory, the wrathful,"
2510,P. A. MUNCH,Riding forth to rule in spirit
2511,P. A. MUNCH,"Over all the known world's kingdoms,--"
2512,P. A. MUNCH,Saw then Cola di Rienzi
2513,P. A. MUNCH,Homage pay to freedom's goddess
2514,P. A. MUNCH,"'Mid the Roman people's paeans,--"
2515,P. A. MUNCH,Saw Pope Leo and his princes
2516,P. A. MUNCH,Choose instead of the Lord Jesus
2517,P. A. MUNCH,Aristotle dead and Plato;-
2518,P. A. MUNCH,Saw again how stouter epochs
2519,P. A. MUNCH,"Raised the Church of Papal power,"
2520,P. A. MUNCH,Till the Frenchman overthrew it
2521,P. A. MUNCH,And exalted Nature's Godhead;
2522,P. A. MUNCH,Saw anew then wonted custom
2523,P. A. MUNCH,"In its pious, still processions"
2524,P. A. MUNCH,With a Lamb the great world's ruler!--
2525,P. A. MUNCH,All this saw the little Hermes
2526,P. A. MUNCH,"On the corner near the temple,"
2527,P. A. MUNCH,And the wise man from the Northland
2528,P. A. MUNCH,Saw that Hermes and his visions.
2529,P. A. MUNCH,
2530,P. A. MUNCH,"Yes, when over Rome he stood there"
2531,P. A. MUNCH,"In that high, historic clearness,"
2532,P. A. MUNCH,And his eye the mountain-ridges
2533,P. A. MUNCH,"Followed toward the red of evening,--"
2534,P. A. MUNCH,Then all beams of longing focused
2535,P. A. MUNCH,"In a blessed intuition,"
2536,P. A. MUNCH,And -- he saw a church before him
2537,P. A. MUNCH,"Greater far than that of nature,"
2538,P. A. MUNCH,"And he felt a peace descending,"
2539,P. A. MUNCH,Larger far than all the present.
2540,P. A. MUNCH,
2541,P. A. MUNCH,"When the second time he came there,"
2542,P. A. MUNCH,"After days and nights of labor,"
2543,P. A. MUNCH,"Hard as were it for redemption,--"
2544,P. A. MUNCH,"Then the Lord Himself gave welcome,"

2547,P. A. MUNCH,
2548,P. A. MUNCH,But to us with sorrow stricken

2558,P. A. MUNCH,Also knows when rest is needed.
2559,P. A. MUNCH,
2560,P. A. MUNCH,"But we question, while reviewing"
2561,P. A. MUNCH,All that mighty thought-armada
2562,P. A. MUNCH,"Now disbanded, home-returning:"
2563,P. A. MUNCH,Who again shall reunite it?
2564,P. A. MUNCH,
2565,P. A. MUNCH,"For when _he_ cut his war-arrow,"
2566,P. A. MUNCH,"Lords and liegemen soon were mustered,"
2567,P. A. MUNCH,"And to aid from Sweden, Denmark,"
2568,P. A. MUNCH,"England, France, swift-flying vessels"
2569,P. A. MUNCH,Coursed the sea-ways toward his standard.
2570,P. A. MUNCH,
2571,P. A. MUNCH,"Royal was that fleet and mighty,"
2572,P. A. MUNCH,By our shore at anchor lying;
2573,P. A. MUNCH,We were wont to see it near us
2574,P. A. MUNCH,Or to hear the wondrous tidings
2575,P. A. MUNCH,Of its cruises and its conquests.
2576,P. A. MUNCH,
2577,P. A. MUNCH,What it won we own forever;

2590,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Our King is bereft of a trusty friend!
2591,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,And in dismay
2592,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,We lower our banners and sad attend
2593,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,On his burial day.
2594,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"But Denmark, in sorrow most deep thou waitest,"
2595,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"For fallen the life that was warmest, greatest,"
2596,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,And fallen the tower
2597,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Of mightiest power.
2598,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Bewailing the death of their kingly chief,"
2599,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Men voice their grief.
2600,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2601,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,For Denmark's salvation the man was born
2602,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Who now is dead.
2603,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"When banished in youth from the court in scorn,"
2604,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,To his people he fled.
2605,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"There throve he right well, there grew he together"
2606,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"With peasants and sailors in foul and fair weather,"
2607,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,While fullness of living
2608,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Its schooling was giving;
2609,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"When ready for Denmark was laid the snare,"
2610,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Then he was there!
2611,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2612,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Now soon it was plain, he was peasant-skulled"
2613,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,For their tricks; and hence
2614,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,The traitors' shrewd schemings were all annulled
2615,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,By his bit of sense.
2616,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"He knew but one thing;--what his people thought them,"
2617,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,And therefore in danger he freedom brought them.
2618,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"The whole was his vision,"
2619,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,He would no scission;
2620,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"His words were but few, and of these the key:"
2621,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"""It shall not be!"""
2622,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2623,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"He stood by the helm like a sailor good,"

2628,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"In storm or in fog, exposed or protected;--"
2629,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"And fear allaying,"
2630,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,All folk were saying:
2631,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"""He isn't so stupid as people tell,"
2632,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"For all goes well!"""
2633,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2634,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"""On deck every man!"" was his last command,"
2635,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"""There's storm again!"""
2636,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"When answered the cry from the mast-head: ""Land!"""
2637,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Oh, then, just then,"
2638,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Were loosed from the helm the true hands that were steering,"
2639,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"In death he sank down, while the ship began veering--"
2640,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"No, never veering!"
2641,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,To the course adhering!
2642,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Now, Denmark, united, with all thy force"
2643,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,Hold straight his course!
2644,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2645,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"He made it his honor, in line to stand,"
2646,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,No rank to know;
2647,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"But shoulder to shoulder to lend a hand,"
2648,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,And pride forego.
2649,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,They gather now fruit of his faithful training:
2650,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Well drilled, every man at his post is straining."
2651,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"The course is steady,"
2652,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,For tried and ready
2653,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Is many a helmsman, and all their will"
2654,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Is ""Northward still!"""
2655,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,
2656,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Naught else can they do now, but with good cheer"
2657,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Hold out they must,"
2658,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Stand guard in the darkness and have no fear,"
2659,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,In God their trust.
2660,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"It is sultry and silent, and yearning in sorrow"
2661,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"All breathless they listen and wait for the morrow,--"
2662,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"'T is time for waiting,"
2663,KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH,"Till, night abating,"

3258,EPILOGUE,'T is but a short time since we saw pass by
3259,EPILOGUE,"A picture drawn from life, austere and dark,"
3260,EPILOGUE,A soul in servitude to strong desires;
3261,EPILOGUE,And all its life in prison-labor spent.
3262,EPILOGUE,"Although religion prays and sings its hymns,"
3263,EPILOGUE,"And poetry and art their sunshine spread,"
3264,EPILOGUE,"That soul in slavery toils, till white the hair."
3265,EPILOGUE,
3266,EPILOGUE,"She, in whose memory we gather here,"
3267,EPILOGUE,"Was early made to feel by hard conditions,"
3268,EPILOGUE,"That clouded life and rudely barred her soul,--"
3269,EPILOGUE,How men and women live as toiling slaves!
3270,EPILOGUE,And she rebelled against this servitude;
3271,EPILOGUE,Great powers have birth to longings for the light;
3272,EPILOGUE,"_Freedom she craved, that others she might free!_"
3273,EPILOGUE,With restless spirit outward went her quest
3274,EPILOGUE,"To people, books; but thoughtful she became,"
3275,EPILOGUE,"As one whose search was vain; reserved and shy,"
3276,EPILOGUE,As one whose courage fails;--until one day
3277,EPILOGUE,"_He_, who from fairy-tale and hero-legend"
3278,EPILOGUE,"That wondrous bow received of magic might,"
3279,EPILOGUE,Stood up and to the vale and mountain played:
3280,EPILOGUE,"""Come forth, come from our nation's heart-deep forth,"
3281,EPILOGUE,"Creative might, that in our nation's morning"
3282,EPILOGUE,"Didst lift its image up to dread, to greatness,"
3283,EPILOGUE,In myths of Asas fair and giants grim!
3284,EPILOGUE,"As mountain-walls lean o'er their own reflection,"
3285,EPILOGUE,"In that thought-ocean we our life could see,"
3286,EPILOGUE,"With spring, with winter, and with spring again."
3287,EPILOGUE,"Thou gav'st our image oft in song and story,"
3288,EPILOGUE,In times of darkness and in times of light;
3289,EPILOGUE,"Our image meets us wheresoe'er we go,--"
3290,EPILOGUE,"But yet our nation sees it not, nor looks"
3291,EPILOGUE,Up from its toiling thoughts and dull routine!--
3292,EPILOGUE,"Oh, wake it, lift it, _make it see itself!_"
3293,EPILOGUE,"Then shall it put to use the powers it owns!"""
3294,EPILOGUE,
3295,EPILOGUE,"And living echoes answered! Lo, there swarmed"
3296,EPILOGUE,"Elves of the Stage about him, as he played!"
3297,EPILOGUE,"They made the lamps to burn, and reared the grotto,"
3298,EPILOGUE,"They brought and brushed the costumes Holberg knew,"
3299,EPILOGUE,"And in them played their pranks 'neath powdered wigs,--"
3300,EPILOGUE,Roamed on the mountains of a summer night
3301,EPILOGUE,"And stole the saeter-maiden while she slept,"
3302,EPILOGUE,And filled with mortal fear the aged wooer!
3303,EPILOGUE,"They danced the goblin-dance in dusk of winter,"
3304,EPILOGUE,Played hide-and-seek with their own shadows;
3305,EPILOGUE,"They snared the hypocrite in his own sighs,"
3306,EPILOGUE,In his own web the pettifogger bound;
3307,EPILOGUE,"They scattered wide the hoard a miser gathered,"
3308,EPILOGUE,They tripped and threw the petty parish-pope
3309,EPILOGUE,They saved the tears of innocence seduced
3310,EPILOGUE,And on the altar laid as lustrous pearls;
3311,EPILOGUE,"They melted hatred in the ice-hard breast,"
3312,EPILOGUE,It fell as rain upon the enemy's fields;
3313,EPILOGUE,"They bound the slanderer, Mazeppa-like,"
3314,EPILOGUE,Upon the back of his wild calumnies;--
3315,EPILOGUE,The crafty man of stealthy selfishness
3316,EPILOGUE,They set afloat within an open boat;--
3317,EPILOGUE,"But one who freely gave himself, his all,"
3318,EPILOGUE,They bore to heaven upon their joyous laughter.
3319,EPILOGUE,"They drew the magic ring round those who loved,"
3320,EPILOGUE,And to the altar led the blushing pair.
3321,EPILOGUE,They brought heroic forms from barrows old
3322,EPILOGUE,To tower in might among the teeming present.
3323,EPILOGUE,--There was not one could longer rest in peace;
3324,EPILOGUE,"Himself, his folly, all our country's need,"
3325,EPILOGUE,"Wholeness victorious, halfness doomed to fail,"
3326,EPILOGUE,"The power of honest faith, the wreck of doubt,--"
3327,EPILOGUE,"All this our nation saw in its own image,"
3328,EPILOGUE,When strongly lighted on the Stage 't was set.--
3329,EPILOGUE,
3330,EPILOGUE,And she was part of this! The first full tone
3331,EPILOGUE,Thrilled her breast too and woke a thousand mem'ries
3332,EPILOGUE,Of something that she ne'er before had known!
3333,EPILOGUE,"On that first evening, when the curtain rose,"
3334,EPILOGUE,With timid step one clad in white came forth
3335,EPILOGUE,"And begged for Norway's art, for our young drama"
3336,EPILOGUE,"A home in Norway,--but with so great fear,"
3337,EPILOGUE,"The gentle voice was trembling, dim the eyes;"
3338,EPILOGUE,"Yet from the voice, the eyes, the form, the bearing"
3339,EPILOGUE,Was heard a promise in sweet modesty;
3340,EPILOGUE,"For she who spoke those first words on this Stage,"
3341,EPILOGUE,"That maiden dark with eyes so deep and true,"
3342,EPILOGUE,"Lo, it was she!"
3343,EPILOGUE,
3344,EPILOGUE,And soon her art shone clear
3345,EPILOGUE,And softly radiant through the evening hours.--
3346,EPILOGUE,With fairy lightness fell its magic gleams
3347,EPILOGUE,"On hidden longings, sorrows half-concealed,--"
3348,EPILOGUE,"But gently, tenderly. If joy she touched,"
3349,EPILOGUE,'T was always softly. But we all could feel
3350,EPILOGUE,"A stream of power so full, that if she had"
3351,EPILOGUE,In an unguarded hour let it flow free
3352,EPILOGUE,"With all its deep and swelling tide sincere,"
3353,EPILOGUE,It would have borne herself from earth away.
3354,EPILOGUE,
3355,EPILOGUE,"In truth, the calmness of her course through life"
3356,EPILOGUE,"Was never weakness, but was strength controlled;"
3357,EPILOGUE,"Was never fear, but veneration deep"
3358,EPILOGUE,For those whose souls are great: a model she
3359,EPILOGUE,"For noble women as for forceful men,--"
3360,EPILOGUE,This wreath we weave for her pure memory.
3361,EPILOGUE,
3362,EPILOGUE,"But what she thus had early taught herself,"
3363,EPILOGUE,She taught to others. When upon the stage
3364,EPILOGUE,"She stood, depicting woman's painful conflict"
3365,EPILOGUE,"With rudeness, violence, and wild desire,"
3366,EPILOGUE,"Then,--though she wielded but a woman's weapons,"
3367,EPILOGUE,"Her silent dignity, her subtle smile,"
3368,EPILOGUE,"Her light derision, all-subduing laughter,--"
3369,EPILOGUE,"A spirit-dawn gleamed from their flashing play,"
3370,EPILOGUE,To usher in a day of victory.
3371,EPILOGUE,She barriers raised around the woman weak
3372,EPILOGUE,"(Down-trodden in a half-built social order),"
3373,EPILOGUE,She stood forth here so many an evening-hour
3374,EPILOGUE,And talked to thousands of a woman's worth.
3375,EPILOGUE,though her call was not fully to free
3376,EPILOGUE,"All that a woman's heart may hope and dream,"
3377,EPILOGUE,She shielded it secure in all its beauty.
3378,EPILOGUE,
3379,EPILOGUE,"This conflict made her reticent, severe;--"
3380,EPILOGUE,But sometimes in a song her spirit could
3381,EPILOGUE,"Send forth glad tidings, messages of freedom,"
3382,EPILOGUE,Her large free soul revealing. _Then_ we heard
3383,EPILOGUE,"Such longing after full, unbroken peace,"
3384,EPILOGUE,Our thoughts were captive held by sad foreboding.--
3385,EPILOGUE,
3386,EPILOGUE,'T is now come true!--The crape of mourning droops
3387,EPILOGUE,"About her name, the tolling bell is still."
3388,EPILOGUE,Her final summons gather us once more
3389,EPILOGUE,"Before her stage, and here our thanks we utter"
3390,EPILOGUE,"For what she gave us. So as _she_ had given,"
3391,EPILOGUE,"Has no one given. She gave of her sorrow,"
3392,EPILOGUE,With bleeding heart beneath her winsome smile.
3393,EPILOGUE,"She shared with us the tears her conflict brought,"
3394,EPILOGUE,The radiant glory of her victory.
3395,EPILOGUE,
3396,EPILOGUE,"Thanks, prayer-borne thanks, you noble soul,"
3397,EPILOGUE,"From all your brothers, from your sisters all!"
3398,EPILOGUE,From Norway's youthful art enduring thanks!
3399,EPILOGUE,From women to their pure interpreter
3400,EPILOGUE,Farewell and thanks!--From all those whom you lifted
3401,EPILOGUE,On pinions of the spirit high to beauty
3402,EPILOGUE,"Once more a wreath is brought,--it is the last."

4199,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4200,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),In all the land our race was once excelling.
4201,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),In richer regions it e'en now possesses
4202,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Broad seats and fruitful; but by fate's hard stresses
4203,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),_Our_ branch was bent and bowed to blows compelling.
4204,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Now toward the light again it lifts aloft
4205,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Its top, and fresh buds crown it, fair and soft."
4206,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"The flowing fountain of _your_ faith has laved it,"
4207,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),To life's late evening thus your strength has saved it.
4208,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4209,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"As rests the race in time of chill and rigor,"
4210,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),And from the deeps that lie within its being
4211,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Draws to it what alone can nourish, freeing"
4212,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Its powers to full prophecy of vigor,--"
4213,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),So I divined the unseen stir in you
4214,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Of nature's might that you could not subdue;
4215,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"It was so strong, from sire to son surviving,"
4216,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),In mystery mute descends this power's striving.
4217,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4218,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Upon this poured its radiant warmth pervading
4219,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),My mother's soul; of wedded joy the glory
4220,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Crowns not alone your aged heads and hoary;
4221,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),But it shall death outlive in light unfading.
4222,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),And if my people ever truly prize
4223,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"The pictured home that in my writings lies,"
4224,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Honor of love and faith serene, unbroken,--"
4225,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Of father, mother, both, shall praise be spoken."
4226,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4227,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"If men remember the Norwegian peasant,"
4228,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),As from the field of toil or saga fateful
4229,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"I conjured him; to you they shall be grateful,"
4230,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Father, in whom love let me find him present."
4231,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),And if the woman whom I made them view
4232,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"In sun-like splendid faith and spirit true,"
4233,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"By women is approved, it is the other"
4234,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Who has their homage, my sweet-natured mother."
4235,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4236,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),And now you'll rest the evening long and cheery
4237,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"From the day's work in fair or troubled weather,"
4238,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"And of the by-gone time you'll talk together,"
4239,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Of many a mile you trod with footsteps weary,--"
4240,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Now will as sunlight on the winter's snow,"
4241,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"A warmth of thanks in through the window glow,"
4242,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Harsh memories mellow with its golden shining,"
4243,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Your life in faith complete find its refining.
4244,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4245,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"But none gives thanks as now that son in gladness,"
4246,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"For whom you lived in anxious fear unceasing,"
4247,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Since forth he flew with strength of wing increasing,"
4248,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),For whom to God you prayed in joy and sadness.
4249,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Oh, know, when hot my blood burned over-much,"
4250,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"I felt your soothing hands my forehead touch,"
4251,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"And oft, my heart in mute repentance bleeding,"
4252,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),In thoughts of you I heard God's gentle pleading.
4253,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),
4254,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),And so I pray that I may have the power
4255,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"(Since we again for life shall be united,"
4256,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"And hope 'mid mirthful mem'ries be relighted),"
4257,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),To brighten now their every evening-hour!
4258,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"When children's children in their arms shall be,"
4259,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"Oh, let them morning in their evening see!"
4260,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),"So shall they gladly lay, when death gives warning,"
4261,(UPON HIS RETIREMENT),Their gray heads down to greet the dawning morning.

4744,GOOD CHEER,
4745,GOOD CHEER,So let these songs their story tell
4746,GOOD CHEER,"To all who in the Northland dwell,"
4747,GOOD CHEER,Since many friends request it.
4748,GOOD CHEER,(That Finland's folk with them belong
4749,GOOD CHEER,"In the wide realm of Northern song,"
4750,GOOD CHEER,I grateful must attest it.)
4751,GOOD CHEER,
4752,GOOD CHEER,I send these songs--and now I find
4753,GOOD CHEER,Most of them have riot what my mind
4754,GOOD CHEER,Has deepest borne and favored:
4755,GOOD CHEER,"Some are too hasty, some too brief,"
4756,GOOD CHEER,"Some, long in stock, have come to grief,"
4757,GOOD CHEER,Some with raw youth are flavored.
4758,GOOD CHEER,
4759,GOOD CHEER,I lived far more than e'er I sang;
4760,GOOD CHEER,"Thought, ire, and mirth unceasing rang"
4761,GOOD CHEER,"Around me, where I guested;"
4762,GOOD CHEER,To be where loud life's battles call
4763,GOOD CHEER,For me was well-nigh more than all
4764,GOOD CHEER,My pen on page arrested.
4765,GOOD CHEER,
4766,GOOD CHEER,"What's true and strong has growing-room,"
4767,GOOD CHEER,"And will perhaps eternal bloom,"
4768,GOOD CHEER,"Without black ink's salvation,"
4769,GOOD CHEER,"And he will be, who least it planned,"
4770,GOOD CHEER,"But in life's surging dared to stand,"
4771,GOOD CHEER,The best bard for his nation.
4772,GOOD CHEER,
4773,GOOD CHEER,I heard once of a Spanish feast:
4774,GOOD CHEER,"Within the ring a rustic beast,"
4775,GOOD CHEER,"A horse, to fight was fated;"
4776,GOOD CHEER,"In came a tiger from his cage,"
4777,GOOD CHEER,"Who walked about, his foe to gauge,"
4778,GOOD CHEER,"And crouching down, then waited."
4779,GOOD CHEER,
4780,GOOD CHEER,"The people clapped and laughed and cheered,"
4781,GOOD CHEER,"The tiger sprang, the horse upreared,"
4782,GOOD CHEER,But none could see him bleeding;
4783,GOOD CHEER,The tiger tumbling shrinks and backs
4784,GOOD CHEER,"Before the horse's rustic whacks,"
4785,GOOD CHEER,Lies on his head naught heeding.
4786,GOOD CHEER,
4787,GOOD CHEER,"Then men and women hooted, hissed,"
4788,GOOD CHEER,With glaring eyes and clenchèd fist
4789,GOOD CHEER,Out o'er the balcony bending;
4790,GOOD CHEER,"With shouts the tiger's heart they tease,"
4791,GOOD CHEER,"Their thirst for blood soon to appease,"
4792,GOOD CHEER,To onset new him sending.
4793,GOOD CHEER,
4794,GOOD CHEER,The people clapped and laughed and cheered
4795,GOOD CHEER,"The tiger sprang, the horse upreared;"
4796,GOOD CHEER,"No blood to see was given,"
4797,GOOD CHEER,"For fortune held the horse too dear,"
4798,GOOD CHEER,"To him the tiger could not near,"
4799,GOOD CHEER,In flying curves hoof-driven.
4800,GOOD CHEER,
4801,GOOD CHEER,To say who won I will not try;
4802,GOOD CHEER,"For lo, this rustic horse am I,"
4803,GOOD CHEER,And on the conflict's going;--
4804,GOOD CHEER,"The city, though, where it occurs,"
4805,GOOD CHEER,"And where it cheers and laughter stirs,"
4806,GOOD CHEER,Is known without my showing.
4807,GOOD CHEER,
4808,GOOD CHEER,"I fight, but have no hate or spite,"
4809,GOOD CHEER,"From what I love draw gladness bright,"
4810,GOOD CHEER,My right to wrath reserving.
4811,GOOD CHEER,"It is my blood, my soul, that goes"
4812,GOOD CHEER,"In every line of all my blows,"
4813,GOOD CHEER,And guides their course unswerving.
4814,GOOD CHEER,
4815,GOOD CHEER,"But as I stand here now to-day,"
4816,GOOD CHEER,"Nor grudge nor vengeance can me sway,"
4817,GOOD CHEER,To think that foes I'm facing.
4818,GOOD CHEER,So in return some friendship give
4819,GOOD CHEER,"To one who for the _cause_ would live,"
4820,GOOD CHEER,With love the North embracing!
4821,GOOD CHEER,
4822,GOOD CHEER,But first my poet-path shall be
4823,GOOD CHEER,"With veneration unto _thee_,"
4824,GOOD CHEER,Who fill'st the North with wonder;
4825,GOOD CHEER,In wrath thou dawn didst prophesy
4826,GOOD CHEER,"Behind the North's dark morning-sky,"
4827,GOOD CHEER,That lightnings shook and thunder.
4828,GOOD CHEER,
4829,GOOD CHEER,"Then, milder, thou, by sea and slope,"
4830,GOOD CHEER,"The fount of saga, faith, and hope"
4831,GOOD CHEER,Mad'st flow for every peasant;--
4832,GOOD CHEER,Now from the snow-years' mountain-side
4833,GOOD CHEER,Thou seest with time's returning tide
4834,GOOD CHEER,Thine own high image present.
4835,GOOD CHEER,
4836,GOOD CHEER,"To _thee_, then, in whose spring of song"
4837,GOOD CHEER,"Finland's ""the thousand lakes"" belong"
4838,GOOD CHEER,And sound their thrilling sorrow:--
4839,GOOD CHEER,Our Northern soul forever heard
4840,GOOD CHEER,Keeps watch and ward in poet's word
4841,GOOD CHEER,'Gainst Eastern millions' morrow.
4842,GOOD CHEER,
4843,GOOD CHEER,"But when I stand in our own home,"
4844,GOOD CHEER,One greets me from the starry dome
4845,GOOD CHEER,With wealth of light and power.
4846,GOOD CHEER,"There shines he: HENRIK WERGELAND,"

4935,OLD HELTBERG,"He freed thought from the fetters that the schools inherit,"
4936,OLD HELTBERG,"Independent in teaching, he led by the spirit;"
4937,OLD HELTBERG,Personality unique: for with manner anarchic
4938,OLD HELTBERG,He carved up the text; and absolute-monarchic
4939,OLD HELTBERG,"Was his wrath at mistakes; but soon it subsided,"
4940,OLD HELTBERG,"Or, controlled, into noblest pathos was guided,"
4941,OLD HELTBERG,Which oft turned in recoil into self-irony
4942,OLD HELTBERG,And  a downpour of wit letting no one go free.--
4943,OLD HELTBERG,"So he governed his ""horde,"" so we went through the country,"

4952,OLD HELTBERG,Had no purpose to settle and just there to stay.

4960,OLD HELTBERG,"Each lesson seemed a vision that henceforth was ours,"
4961,OLD HELTBERG,Inspiring each youth's individual powers.
4962,OLD HELTBERG,"His pictures made pregnant our creative desire,"
4963,OLD HELTBERG,"His wit was our testing in an ordeal of fire,"
4964,OLD HELTBERG,"His wisdom was our balance, to weigh things great and small,"
4965,OLD HELTBERG,"His pathos told of passions, burning, but held in thrall,"
4966,OLD HELTBERG,
4967,OLD HELTBERG,"Oft the stricken hero scarce his tedious toil could brook,"
4968,OLD HELTBERG,"He wished to go and write, though it were but a single book,"
4969,OLD HELTBERG,"To show a _little_ what he was, and show it to the world:"
4970,OLD HELTBERG,"He loosed his cable daily, but ne'er his sails unfurled."
4971,OLD HELTBERG,
4972,OLD HELTBERG,"His ""grammar"" was not printed! And he passed from mortal ken"
4973,OLD HELTBERG,To where the laws of thought are not written with a pen.
4974,OLD HELTBERG,"His ""grammar"" was not printed! But the life that it had,"
4975,OLD HELTBERG,In ink's prolonging power did not need to be clad.
4976,OLD HELTBERG,"It lived in his soul, so mighty, so warm,"
4977,OLD HELTBERG,That a thousand books' life seems but poor empty form.
4978,OLD HELTBERG,"It lives in a host of independent men,"
4979,OLD HELTBERG,To whose thought he gave life and who give it again
4980,OLD HELTBERG,"In the school, at the bar, in the church, and Storting's hall,"
4981,OLD HELTBERG,"In poetry and art,--whose deeds and lifework all"
4982,OLD HELTBERG,"Have proved to be the freer and the broader in their might,"

5100,TO STANG,"Upon the breast we love, our common mother's."
5101,TO STANG,

5103,TO STANG,"With all your strength to serve her you have striven,"
5104,TO STANG,"Your youthful fire, your counsel cool have given,"
5105,TO STANG,"And till it waned, your manhood's wealth of power."

5108,TO STANG,"To shield our land from storms of fate's hard weather,"
5109,TO STANG,Till 'neath the roof in peace we sat together.

5121,TO STANG,"When steam and powder, bursting every barrier,"
5122,TO STANG,Gave new-born cravings each its speedy carrier

5124,TO STANG,"The new day's work, as 't were the tempest's welter,"
5125,TO STANG,"In din about you seemed a dream, a fable,"

5165,TO STANG,"From cravings, powers that seek their form, ascending,"

6168,ROMSDAL,"High in the notch within limits straitest,"

6181,ROMSDAL,"Towards him hurry, all white-foam-faced,"

6195,ROMSDAL,"Sponge-wet and slow,"
6196,ROMSDAL,Cloud-masses over the mountain-flanks fumble;
6197,ROMSDAL,"The sun and mist, lo,"

6207,ROMSDAL,
6208,ROMSDAL,"_One_ is the fjord in the storm's battle-fray,"

6215,ROMSDAL,"Be it so bare as the mossy gray rubble,"
6216,ROMSDAL,Be it so brief as a brook's fleeting bubble.
6217,ROMSDAL,
6218,ROMSDAL,"Oh, what a brightness! Beauty, soul-ravishing,"
6219,ROMSDAL,"Shines from his prayer, that now he be shriven"
6220,ROMSDAL,"Of all the past! And penitence lavishing,"

6222,ROMSDAL,Mirrors and masses
6223,ROMSDAL,Deep the mountains' high peaks and passes.
6224,ROMSDAL,
6225,ROMSDAL,The old giants think now: He's not really bad;
6226,ROMSDAL,In greater degree he's wrathful and glad
6227,ROMSDAL,"Than others perchance; is false not at all,"
6228,ROMSDAL,"But reckless, capricious,--true son of Romsdal."
6229,ROMSDAL,
6230,ROMSDAL,"Right are the mountains! This race-type keeping,"
6231,ROMSDAL,_They_ saw men creeping
6232,ROMSDAL,"Over the ridges, scant fodder reaping."
6233,ROMSDAL,_They_ saw men eager
6234,ROMSDAL,"Toil on the sea, though their take was meager,"
6235,ROMSDAL,"Plow the steep slope and trench the bog-valley,"
6236,ROMSDAL,To bouts with the rock the brown nag rally.
6237,ROMSDAL,"Saw their faults flaunted,--"
6238,ROMSDAL,"Buck-like they bicker,"
6239,ROMSDAL,"Love well their liquor,--"
6240,ROMSDAL,"But know not defeat,--hoist the sail undaunted!"
6241,ROMSDAL,
6242,ROMSDAL,Different the districts; but all in all:
6243,ROMSDAL,"Spirits vivacious, with longings that spur them,"
6244,ROMSDAL,"Depths full of song, with billows that stir them,"
6245,ROMSDAL,Folk of the fjord and the sudden squall.
6246,ROMSDAL,
6247,ROMSDAL,"Viking-abode, I hail you with wonder!"
6248,ROMSDAL,"High-built the wall, broad sea-floor thereunder,"
6249,ROMSDAL,"Hall lit by sun-bows on waterfall vapors,"
6250,ROMSDAL,"Hangings of green,--your dwellers the drapers."
6251,ROMSDAL,"Viking-born race,--'t is you I exalt!"
6252,ROMSDAL,
6253,ROMSDAL,It costs in under so high a vault
6254,ROMSDAL,A struggle long unto lordship stable;
6255,ROMSDAL,"Not all who have tried to succeed, were able."
6256,ROMSDAL,It costs to recover the wealth of the fjord
6257,ROMSDAL,From wanton waste and in power to hoard.
6258,ROMSDAL,It costs;--but who conquers is made a man.
6259,ROMSDAL,I know there are that can.

7070,PREFATORY,
7071,PREFATORY,Björnstjerne Björnson was born in 1832 and died in 1909.  The last
7072,PREFATORY,"edition of his Poems and Songs in his lifetime is the fourth, dated"
7073,PREFATORY,"1903.  It is a volume of two hundred pages, containing one hundred"
7074,PREFATORY,"and forty-one pieces, arranged in nearly chronological order from"
7075,PREFATORY,"1857, or just before, to 1900. Of these almost two-thirds appeared"
7076,PREFATORY,"in the first edition (1870), ending with Good Cheer and including"
7077,PREFATORY,"ten pieces omitted in the other editions, eight poems and two"
7078,PREFATORY,lyrical passages from the drama King Sverre; the second edition
7079,PREFATORY,(1880) added the contents in order through Question and Answer and
7080,PREFATORY,inserted earlier The Angels of Sleep; the third (1900) extended the
7081,PREFATORY,additions to include Frederik Hegel.
7082,PREFATORY,
7083,PREFATORY,This translation presents in the same order the contents of the
7084,PREFATORY,"fourth edition, with the exception of the following ten pieces:"

7097,PREFATORY,
7098,PREFATORY,"Nine of these are occasional longs in the narrowest sense, with"
7099,PREFATORY,"little or no general interest, and showing hardly any of the"
7100,PREFATORY,"author's better qualities: five Wedding Songs, a Betrothal Song, a"
7101,PREFATORY,"Silver-Wedding Song, a Golden-Wedding Song, and a Students' Song of"
7102,PREFATORY,"Greeting to Mrs. Louise Heiberg. The tenth, a characteristic, rather"
7103,PREFATORY,"long poem of vigor and value, New Year's Epistle in Rhyme to Rector"
7104,PREFATORY,"Steen, is extremely difficult to render into English verse."
7105,PREFATORY,
7106,PREFATORY,The translator has thought it best not to include any of Björnson's
7107,PREFATORY,lyric productions not contained in the collection published with his
7108,PREFATORY,"sanction during his life, the other lyrics in his tales, dramas. and"
7109,PREFATORY,"novels, many occasional short poems in periodicals and newspapers"
7110,PREFATORY,"which were abandoned by their author to their fugitive fate, two"
7111,PREFATORY,"noble lyrical cantatas, and a few fine poems written after the year"
7112,PREFATORY,1900.
7113,PREFATORY,
7114,PREFATORY,The translation aims to reproduce as exactly as possible the
7115,PREFATORY,"verse-form, meter, and rhyme of the original. This has been"
7116,PREFATORY,judged desirable because music has been composed for so many
7117,PREFATORY,"of these songs and poems, and each of them is, as it were, one"
7118,PREFATORY,"with its musical setting. But such reproduction seems also, on the"
7119,PREFATORY,"whole, to be most faithful and satisfactory, when the translator is"
7120,PREFATORY,not endowed with poetic genius equal to that of the author. The very
7121,PREFATORY,numerous double (dissyllabic) rhymes of the Norwegian are not easy
7122,PREFATORY,to render in English. Recourse to the English present participle has
7123,PREFATORY,been avoided as much as possible. If it still seems to be too
7124,PREFATORY,"frequent, the translator asks some measure of indulgence in view of"
7125,PREFATORY,the fact that the use here of the English present participle is
7126,PREFATORY,formally not so unlike that of the inflectional endings and of the
7127,PREFATORY,post-positive article Norwegian.
7128,PREFATORY,
7129,PREFATORY,The purpose of the Notes is to assist the better understanding and
7130,PREFATORY,"appreciation of the contents of the book, by furnishing the"
7131,PREFATORY,necessary historical and biographical information. Of the persons
7132,PREFATORY,"referred to it is essential to know their dates, life-work,"
7133,PREFATORY,"character, influence, and relation to Björnson. The Notes have been"
7134,PREFATORY,"drawn from the accessible encyclopedias, biographical dictionaries,"
7135,PREFATORY,"bibliographies, and histories.  The notes of Julius Elias to his"
7136,PREFATORY,edition of German translations of Björnson's poems made by various
7137,PREFATORY,writers and published in 1908 have been freely and gratefully used.
7138,PREFATORY,
7139,PREFATORY,The Introduction is designed not so much to offer new and original
7140,PREFATORY,"criticism as to present the opinions generally held in Scandinavia,"
7141,PREFATORY,"and, of course, chiefly in Norway. The lyric poetry of Björnson has"
7142,PREFATORY,been excellently discussed by Christian Collin in Björnstjerne
7143,PREFATORY,Björnson. Hans Barndom og Ungdom by Henrik Jaeger in Illustreret

7176,PREFATORY,1814 when at Eidsvold (see Note 5) a representative convention
7177,PREFATORY,declared the country's independence and adopted a Constitution. The
7178,PREFATORY,celebration day was instituted as a result of King Karl Johan's
7179,PREFATORY,proposals for changes in the Constitution during the years 1821 to
7180,PREFATORY,"1824, especially in favor of an absolute veto. It was taken up in"
7181,PREFATORY,"Christiania in 1824, and spread rapidly to all the cities in the"
7182,PREFATORY,"land, was opposed by the King and omitted in 1828, taken up by the"
7183,PREFATORY,"students of the University in 1829, and soon after 1830 made by"
7184,PREFATORY,Henrik Wergeland (see Note 78) the chief of Norwegian patriotic
7185,PREFATORY,festivals. In 1870 Björnson conceived and put into practice the

7192,PREFATORY,SONG FOR NORWAY. Written in the summer of 1859 in connection
7193,PREFATORY,"with the tale Arne, but not included in that book. The people of"
7194,PREFATORY,"Norway have adopted this poem as their national hymn, because"
7195,PREFATORY,"it is vigorous, picturesque summary of the glorious history of the"
7196,PREFATORY,country in whose every line patriotic love vibrates.

7198,PREFATORY,Stanza 2. Harald Fairhair (860-933) was the first to unite all
7199,PREFATORY,Norway in one kingdom as a sort of feudal state.  His success in his
7200,PREFATORY,struggles with the petty kings who opposed him was made complete by his victory over viking forces in the battle on the waters of
7201,PREFATORY,"Hafursfjord, 872. Many of the rebels emigrated, a movement which led"
7202,PREFATORY,to the settlement of Iceland front 874 on.  Haakon the Good (935-
7203,PREFATORY,"961) was the youngest son of Harald Fairhair, born in the latter's"
7204,PREFATORY,"old age. He was reared in England with King Ethelstane, who had him"
7205,PREFATORY,taught Christianity and baptized. When he was well settled on the
7206,PREFATORY,"throne in Norway, he tried to introduce Christianity, but without"
7207,PREFATORY,success. He improved the laws and organized the war forces of the
7208,PREFATORY,land.
7209,PREFATORY,"Eyvind Finnsson, uncle of Haakon, was a great skald, who sang his"

7211,PREFATORY,"Olaf the Saint (1015-1030) was a man of force and daring, as shown"

7216,PREFATORY,"This and his sternness led to an uprising, which was supported by"
7217,PREFATORY,"the  Danish King, Knut the Great.  Olaf died a hero's death in the"

7254,PREFATORY,"blockaded by the English fleet and suffered sorely for lack of the necessaries of life.  But the nations sense of independence grew,"
7255,PREFATORY,"and when the Peace of Kiel in January, 1814, separated Norway from"
7256,PREFATORY,"Denmark, Norway refused to be absorbed by Sweden, and through a"

7273,PREFATORY,"ANSWER FROM NORWAY. First printed in a newspaper, April 7, 1860,"
7274,PREFATORY,"with the title ""Song for the Common People,"" this poem refers to a"
7275,PREFATORY,"stage of the long conflict over the question of a viceroy in Norway,"
7276,PREFATORY,so important in the history of the union of Sweden and Norway. The
7277,PREFATORY,Norwegian Constitution gave to the King power to send a viceroy to
7278,PREFATORY,"reside in Norway, and to name as such either a Swede or a Norwegian."
7279,PREFATORY,"Until about 1830 the viceroy had always been a Swede, thereafter always a Norwegian. On December 9, 1859, the Norwegian Storting"
7280,PREFATORY,voted to abolish this article in a proposed revision of the
7281,PREFATORY,Constitution.  The matter was discussed in Sweden with vehemence and
7282,PREFATORY,"passion. The storm of feeling raged most violently in March, 1860,"
7283,PREFATORY,"when on the 17th, in Stockholm, this revision was rejected."
7284,PREFATORY,"However, no viceroy was appointed alter 1859, and in 1873 the"
7285,PREFATORY,question was amicably settled as Norwegians desired.
7286,PREFATORY,"While the situation was tense, an unfounded rumor had spread, that"
7287,PREFATORY,on one occasion the Norwegian flag had been raised over the
7288,PREFATORY,residence of the Swedish-Norwegian Minister in Vienna. This caused
7289,PREFATORY,"loud complaints in Sweden, that ""the Norwegian colors had displaced"

7291,PREFATORY,"Norway ought to be ""an accessory"" to Sweden; that ""young,"

7528,PREFATORY,"MAGNUS THE BLIND. Magnus was born in 1115, and became King in 1130."
7529,PREFATORY,He had Harald Gille as co-regent. Their agreement was that Harald
7530,PREFATORY,could not demand a larger share in the kingdom as long as Magnus
7531,PREFATORY,"lived. But Magnus made himself hated by his own deeds, and in 1131"
7532,PREFATORY,a breach resulted between the Kings. The chieftains were on Harald's
7533,PREFATORY,"side. He seized Magnus in 1135, had him blinded and castrated, and"
7534,PREFATORY,"sent him into the monastery at Nidarholm.  Sigurd Slembe, who made"
7535,PREFATORY,"war on Harald and conquered him, freed Magnus from the monastery"
7536,PREFATORY,and caused him to fight in his army. He died in the sea-battle of

7548,PREFATORY,"was a younger sister of the leading Danish literary critic, Clemens"
7549,PREFATORY,"Petersen, born 1834.  He became Björnson's friend in 1856 and aided"
7550,PREFATORY,greatly in opening the way for him in Denmark.  Until 1868 Petersen
7551,PREFATORY,had much influence on public opinion. Soon after that he came to

7556,PREFATORY,BERGEN. Written in 1863 for a musical festival in which Björnson and
7557,PREFATORY,Ibsen took part. Bergen's unusually favorable situation made it for
7558,PREFATORY,a long time Norway's first city in commerce; it has only recently
7559,PREFATORY,fallen behind Christiania. It has ever had a large local fleet and
7560,PREFATORY,great traffic in its harbor.  Founded about 1070 by King Olaf the
7561,PREFATORY,"Quiet, Bergen was very important in the older history of the land,"
7562,PREFATORY,"as the residence of the Kings, until about 1350, when Hanseatic"
7563,PREFATORY,"control began, continuing until late in the sixteenth century. In"
7564,PREFATORY,the seventeenth century Bergen was incomparably the first commercial
7565,PREFATORY,city in the Danish-Norwegian monarchy; in the eighteenth it was
7566,PREFATORY,surpassed by Copenhagen.  The people of Bergen have always been
7567,PREFATORY,distinctly liberal in thought and feeling.
7568,PREFATORY,"Holberg, Ludvig (1684-1754), was born in Bergen, but resided in"
7569,PREFATORY,"most of his life in Denmark. His comedies, which founded modern"
7570,PREFATORY,"Danish-Norwegian literature, are indeed immortal."
7571,PREFATORY,"Dahl, John Christian Clausen (1788-1857), a Norwegian landscape"
7572,PREFATORY,"painter, who, though born in Bergen, went in 1811 to Copenhagen and"
7573,PREFATORY,"from 1818 resided in Dresden. As subjects he preferred water, rock,"
7574,PREFATORY,"and strand, and showed a realistic tendency in his light-effects."
7575,PREFATORY,"Welhaven, see Note 36."
7576,PREFATORY,"Ole Bull (1810-1880), a violinist of world-wide renown.  In his"

7578,PREFATORY,"every year he returned to the home which he maintained near Bergen,"
7579,PREFATORY,at a distance of about two hours by steamer. Carrying out a plan
7580,PREFATORY,"conceived in 1848, he established in Bergen with his own means the"
7581,PREFATORY,"first Norwegian National Theater, which was opened January 2, 1850."
7582,PREFATORY,Collin says that the last line of the poem sums up Björnson's view
7583,PREFATORY,of Norway's historical memories as motive power for new achievement.
7584,PREFATORY,"This seems realized in Bergen's recent development,--it now had the"
7585,PREFATORY,largest steam-fleet of all the cities in Norway.

7588,PREFATORY,"P. A. MUNCH. Peter Andreas Munch (born in Christiania, December 15,"
7589,PREFATORY,"1810; died in Rome, May 25, 1863) became professor of history in"
7590,PREFATORY,1841 and Keeper of the Archives in 1861. He was not only one of the
7591,PREFATORY,"greatest historians of Norway, but also a philologist, an"
7592,PREFATORY,"ethnographer, an archaeologist, a geographer, and a publicist. His"
7593,PREFATORY,chief field was the prehistoric age and the medieval period.
7594,PREFATORY,"He traveled much in the Scandinavian lands and elsewhere in Europe,"
7595,PREFATORY,"made several long stays in Rome, and was buried there. His main and"
7596,PREFATORY,"best known work is the History of the Norwegian People, in eight"
7597,PREFATORY,"large volumes, published from 1851 to 1863. This and his other"
7598,PREFATORY,writings greatly strengthened the national self-consciousness and
7599,PREFATORY,"sense of independence.  Munch had a phenomenal memory, marked talent"
7600,PREFATORY,"for music and drawing, playful humor, incredible capacity for work,"
7601,PREFATORY,rare intuition for epoch-making discoveries. In a speech in 1892
7602,PREFATORY,Björnson placed Munch by the side of Wergeland (see Note 78) as a
7603,PREFATORY,"fosterer of national self-consciousness and faith in the future: ""We"
7604,PREFATORY,"can remember when we were young, how P. A. Munch's History came out"
7605,PREFATORY,"in parts, and how he fought with the Danish professors, to get"
7606,PREFATORY,"Norway brought home again from Danish captivity in history also,"
7607,PREFATORY,"--we can remember how eventful it was for us, and how it had its"
7608,PREFATORY,share in molding us. ... He had his large share in what our
7609,PREFATORY,generation has done.  I put his work in this way by the side of
7610,PREFATORY,"Wergeland's."""
7611,PREFATORY,"Through provincial Asian forests, etc. These lines refer to the"
7612,PREFATORY,"so-called ""immigration-theory"" advanced by Rudolf Keyser and"
7613,PREFATORY,"elaborated by Munch, which maintained that the remote ancestors of"
7614,PREFATORY,the Swedes and the Norwegians migrated from the northeast into the
7615,PREFATORY,Scandinavian peninsula about 300 B.C.: the Swedes from Finland and
7616,PREFATORY,the Northmen through Lapland. These scholars also held that Old
7617,PREFATORY,"Norse literature, as being the product of Norway and Iceland, was"
7618,PREFATORY,"distinctly Norse, and not ""Northern"" or joint-Scandinavian."

7626,PREFATORY,"KING FREDERIK THE SEVENTH. His death occurred November 15, 1863,"
7627,PREFATORY,just before the crisis with Prussia and Austria.  He was born
7628,PREFATORY,"October 6, 1808, the son of Prince Christian Frederik, later King"
7629,PREFATORY,"Christian VIII of Denmark, and his first wife. The early divorce of"
7630,PREFATORY,his parents resulted in his education being neglected; he was left
7631,PREFATORY,for several years in the hands of relatives and strangers; had
7632,PREFATORY,unsympathetic teachers and almost no trace of parental guidance.
7633,PREFATORY,"All his life he had less than average attainments in knowledge,"
7634,PREFATORY,except in a practical way in Scandinavian archaeology. He had
7635,PREFATORY,"natural dignity, but a broad, undisciplined nature, and shunned"
7636,PREFATORY,"court etiquette and constraint.  In 1834, he was in effect"
7637,PREFATORY,"banished to Jaegerspris, a royal estate near Frederikssund, and"
7638,PREFATORY,later was sent on a cruise to Iceland.  Afterwards he resided in
7639,PREFATORY,"disfavor in Fredericia, where his tendencies to plain, direct"
7640,PREFATORY,intercourse with people of all classes were further developed.  When
7641,PREFATORY,"Christian VIII ascended the throne, Frederik's position was somewhat"
7642,PREFATORY,"improved, and his free association with officials and commoners made"
7643,PREFATORY,him very popular.  It was found that he could show at times
7644,PREFATORY,surprisingly clear and sure insight into practical conditions. His
7645,PREFATORY,"interest continued active in archaeological investigations, sea-"
7646,PREFATORY,"voyaging, and fishing.  During the increasing national and political"
7647,PREFATORY,"difficulties Frederik, because of his pronounced Danish feeling and"
7648,PREFATORY,"sympathy with the common people, was disposed to take a stand more"
7649,PREFATORY,national and constitutionally liberal than could please the
7650,PREFATORY,government circles. This became known among the people
7651,PREFATORY,and made him a still greater favorite.  In 1847 he submitted a
7652,PREFATORY,proposal for the introduction of a joint Constitution for the entire
7653,PREFATORY,"monarchy, but King Christian died before action could be taken."
7654,PREFATORY,"Frederik VII ascended the throne January 20, 1848.  The change of"
7655,PREFATORY,"ministry which he made in March as a result of the Schleswig revolt,"
7656,PREFATORY,"his opposition to the division of Schleswig, and his establishment"
7657,PREFATORY,of really constitutional government made his popularity forever
7658,PREFATORY,"secure, although he was not a sure and purposeful ruler.  Frederik's"
7659,PREFATORY,character played an important part in the relations of Denmark with
7660,PREFATORY,Sweden and Norway.  The personal friendship between the two
7661,PREFATORY,Kings united the countries more closely and lifted political
7662,PREFATORY,"""Scandinavism"" to the height it reached shortly before the war of"
7663,PREFATORY,1864 with Prussia and Austria over Schleswig-Holstein.
7664,PREFATORY,"This ""Scandinavism"" is referred to in the poem by the words ""to"
7665,PREFATORY,"the North,"" ""his course,"" and similar expressions.  It was the name"
7666,PREFATORY,given to the sense of kinship of the three Northern peoples and the
7667,PREFATORY,"desire of closer union, whether in spiritual or material or"
7668,PREFATORY,"political relations. It was evoked first by poets and scholars, and"
7669,PREFATORY,gathered strength from 1843 on in meetings of university students.
7670,PREFATORY,In 1848 there was warm sympathy in both Sweden and Norway with the
7671,PREFATORY,cause of Denmark; the assistance of volunteers and even of Swedish-
7672,PREFATORY,Norwegian troops was given. Towards 1864 the three countries came
7673,PREFATORY,"more closely together politically, promises of help to Denmark were"
7674,PREFATORY,"made by Sweden and Norway, and there was even talk of a treaty of"
7675,PREFATORY,"alliance. But the end of the war of 1864, and Germany's victory over"
7676,PREFATORY,"France in 1870-71, destroyed the hopes of political Scandinavism,"
7677,PREFATORY,"and thereafter it became rather cultural and practical, at least"
7678,PREFATORY,"until 1905, when Norway's full independence of Sweden led to"
7679,PREFATORY,emphasis on individual nationality.  The war of 1914-15 may bring
7680,PREFATORY,about a revival of political Scandinavism. (See also Note 38.)

7886,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"esthetic view of art and life, who hated all national exclusiveness"
7887,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and showed a love of his country no less true and intense

8152,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Although one of the most advanced thinkers and keenest combatants in

8283,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,ON THE DEATH OF N. F. S. GRUNDTVIG. Few men have so influenced the
8284,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"spiritual development of Denmark, and indeed that of all"
8285,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Scandinavia, as Nicolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig, the noted Danish"
8286,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"theologian, historian, and poet (born September 8, 1783; died"
8287,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"September 2, 1872). He made a name for himself early by historical,"
8288,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"mythological, religious, and poetical writings. He successfully"
8289,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,opposed the rationalistic thought of the earlier nineteenth century
8290,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,with his simple exposition of Christianity according to the pure
8291,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,teachings of Jesus. His effort was to present to Scandinavia
8292,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Christianity in a popular form, closely connected with the national"
8293,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,thought of the time. There gathered about him a host of able and
8294,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"enthusiastic followers, through whom his religious and political"
8295,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,influence extended over all the North. His characteristic religious
8296,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"views were, as a system, called Grundtvigianism.  For the Church his"
8297,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,ideal was a church of the people with wholly independent
8298,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"congregations. For the nations his ideal was a free, vigorous civic"
8299,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,life. As member of the Danish parliament for many years he showed
8300,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,his intense patriotism by his liberal activity and by his
8301,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,participation in the struggle with Germany for Schleswig-Holstein.
8302,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"He rendered great service also in the reform of education, in"
8303,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"particular as founder of the uniquely valuable ""folk-high-schools"""
8304,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"(see Note 65).  Björnson was a Grundtvigian until 1877, having"
8305,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"heard Gruntvig speak in Christiania in 1851, and having come under"
8306,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,his personal influence in Copenhagen during the winter of 1856-57
8307,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and the following spring.  It was Grundtvig's writings on history
8308,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and mythology that led Björnson to deeper study of the Old Norse
8309,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"sagas and poetry.  It was Gruntvigianism that, especially through"
8310,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,its faith in the power of renewal and in the resurrection of what
8311,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"must first die away, vitalized Björnson's religious faith and"
8312,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"practical philosophy of life.  Björnson once said: ""Grundtvig and"

8330,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,In the flourishing times of Scandinavism he was prominent and of

8401,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,applied mostly to cultural purposes. With O. Arvesen he founded in

8403,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Folk-high-schools are schools for adult men and women, where the"

8415,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"received women during the summer, May to August, and men from"
8416,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"November to April.  Many were established after 1864, which have"

8421,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,THE PURE NORWEGIAN FLAG. The poems here grouped were written in 1879
8422,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"during the active beginning of the so-called ""Flag-conflict"" in"
8423,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,behalf of the removal from the flag of Norway the mark of union with
8424,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Sweden. For a description of the flags of Norway and Sweden, see"
8425,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Note 6.
8426,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,The history of the flag of Norway is briefly this: In 1748 the use
8427,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,of the Dannebrog (see Note 25) was fixed by law for Denmark and
8428,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Norway.  In February, 1814, a decree of Prince Regent Christian"
8429,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Frederik made Norway's flag to be the Dannebrog with Norway's arms
8430,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,(a crowned lion bearing an axe) in the upper square nearest the
8431,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,staff.  Article 11 of the Constitution of 1814 declared: Norway
8432,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,shall have its own merchant-flag; its war-flag shall be a
8433,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"union-flag. Because of the Barbary Coast pirates, however, the"
8434,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Swedish flag with the mark of union was used south of Cape
8435,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Finisterre, and north of it Christian Frederik's Norwegian flag. In"
8436,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,1821 the present pure Norwegian flag was established by Royal
8437,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"resolution as the merchant-flag, to be used north of Cape"
8438,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Finisterre; in 1838 its use was extended by the King to all waters.
8439,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,The war-flag was still the Swedish flag with a union-mark consisting
8440,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,of a white diagonal cross on a red ground. In 1844 King Oskar I by
8441,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,resolution decreed that both the merchant-flag and the war-flag of
8442,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Norway should be the flag of 1821, with the addition of a mark of"
8443,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,union. There was at once some criticism of the union-mark in the
8444,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"merchant-flag, but in general the situation was quietly accepted for"
8445,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"a generation. This was due to Scandinavism, which began to flourish"
8446,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"soon after 1844. Towards 1870, however (i.e., after 1864),"
8447,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Scandinavism lost its force, and the pure flag began to be used"
8448,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,within Norway more and more. The real conflict began in 1879 with a
8449,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,motion in the Storting on February 17 to reënact the flag-law of
8450,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"1821. There was bitter opposition from Conservatives in Norway, and"
8451,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"naturally from Sweden, and the conflict gradually broadened to"
8452,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"embrace everything involved in the union with Sweden, in proportion"
8453,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,as the national spirit of Norway was quickened and strengthened. The
8454,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"famous flag-meeting in Christiania on March 13, 1879, and Björnson's"
8455,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,speech there were the first decisive blow. Essentially the law of
8456,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"1821 was passed by three Stortings, in 1893, 1896, and 1898, and"
8457,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,proclaimed as law without the King's sanction.
8458,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Thor's hammer-mark. Thor's weapon was a hammer=the blue lightning.
8459,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"The symbol of this was the T-mark, to which shape the name cross has"
8460,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,also been given; this mark was much used in the viking period as a
8461,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,sign of Thor's protection. In the flag the blue cross is within a
8462,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,white cross on a red ground.  Colors of freedom. On the institution
8463,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"of the flag of 1821, its red, white, and blue were especially"
8464,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"acceptable in Norway, as being the colors characteristic of free"

8474,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"worker, led for a time a wild life, and was committed under a"

8476,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"February, 1859, to October, 1861. Here he underwent a complete inner"
8477,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,transformation and resolved to become a Christian missionary.
8478,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Rejected by the Norwegian missionary institutions, he went in 1862"
8479,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"to Berlin, and entered a School for Missions there. He supported"
8480,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"himself by work as an engraver, and by unflagging private study"
8481,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,acquired learning and the knowledge of languages. He went to a
8482,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"German Mission in India, which he left in January, 1866.  In 1867 he"
8483,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,began his independent work in Santalistan. Here his persistence and
8484,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"success attracted the attention and support of the English, and thus"
8485,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"he gradually became known and esteemed in his native land, where a"
8486,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Santalistan Society was formed to aid his undertakings.  In 1882 he
8487,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,was duly ordained as clergyman by a bishop of the State Church.  In
8488,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,1873 he published a grammar and in 1904 a dictionary of the language
8489,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,of Santalistan.
8490,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,I do not share your faith. The memorable speech which Björnson
8491,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"delivered to the students in Christiania on October 31, 1877, the"
8492,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"anniversary of Luther's posting his theses in Wittenberg, revealed"
8493,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,that after a hard inner struggle he had freed himself from the
8494,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"religious faith of his early life. The theme of his speech ""Be in"
8495,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"the truth!"" showed that for him henceforth the supreme thing was"
8496,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,freedom of thought and fidelity to the truth as expanding
8497,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,development might manifest it to the individual.  Liberal in thought
8498,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"from the beginning, Björnson departed more and more, not least"
8499,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"through the influence of Grundtvig, from the strict dogmatic"
8500,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"orthodoxy of the State Church.  The study of Darwin, Spencer, Mill,"
8501,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and Comte led him still farther on to a position which may be called
8502,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"that of the agnostic theist, that of Spencer, who does not deny God,"
8503,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"but says ignoramus.  We may recall the late utterance of Björnson,"
8504,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"quoted above: ""Grundtvig and Goethe are my two poles.""  It was the"
8505,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"dogma of Hell, the teaching of eternal damnation and punishment,"
8506,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,that began Björnson's breach with the Church.  He saw how this
8507,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"doctrine enslaved and dwarfed the souls of the peasants, and"
8508,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"blighted all liberal development, both personal and political."
8509,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,
8510,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Note 68.
8511,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,POST FESTUM. Björnson was a decided opponent of the whole system of
8512,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"decorations and orders, royal and other. Here he attacks the Swedish"
8513,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"polar explorer, A. E. von Nordenskjöld (November 18, 1832-August 20,"
8514,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"1901), who earlier had taken the same stand. After Nordenskjöld had"
8515,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"successfully made the Northern Passage, there was a great formal"
8516,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"reception for him on his return to Stockholm, April 24, 1880, at"
8517,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,which King Oskar II decorated him. He also received similar honors

8531,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,HOLGER DRACHMANN. Probably written in 1879. This Danish productive
8532,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"author (and painter), best known as lyric poet and novelist, was"
8533,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,born in 1846 and died in 1908. Here he received from Björnson a
8534,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,reply to verses of homage addressed by him to the latter in 1878.
8535,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Drachmann's early years were turbulent and revolutionary, full of"
8536,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"feuds with everybody. He belonged to the literary and esthetic Left,"
8537,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,opposing all existing institutions. Björnson's characterization
8538,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,exhibits Drachmann at the height of his poetic production.
8539,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,His most popular prose book had recently stirred the Danish national
8540,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,heart and roused the spirit of Scandinavism. The collections of his
8541,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"poems: Songs by the Sea, Tendrils and Roses, Youth in Poem and Song,"
8542,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,he never surpassed.  Perhaps the best were the group of Venetian
8543,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Songs, written in Venice in the spring of 1876, to which time"
8544,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"belongs also his finest story, Two Shots. During the next decade"
8545,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Drachmann underwent an extreme conservative reaction, but about 1890"
8546,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"returned again to his youthful passion for rebellion, romantic"

8552,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"student comedies, and is described as a remarkably charming"
8553,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"personality. In 1871 he became judge's clerk in Molde, and here had"
8554,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,one bright and happy year. Against the disease which showed itself
8555,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,in the fall of 1872 he contended in vain.  This poem was probably

8570,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,SONG FOR NORWAY'S RIFLEMEN.  In 1881 the constitutional conflict
8571,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,between the Left and the Right over the nature of the King's veto
8572,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,had become acute.  The question was whether the veto-power was
8573,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,suspensive or absolute as to amendments of the Constitution.  The
8574,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Left maintained that it was only suspensive, and the conflict was"
8575,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,ended in favor of this view by the Supreme Court in 1884; an
8576,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,amendment enacted by three independently elected Stortings is valid
8577,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,without the King's sanction.  This poem shows that the people were

8609,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"statue in Christiania on the 17th of May, 1881, when Björnson also"
8610,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"delivered a great oration. Henrik Arnold Wergeland was born June 17,"
8611,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"1808, in Christiansand, and died August 12, 1845, in Christiania."
8612,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Though he studied theology, he devoted his life to poetry and"
8613,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"politics. His earliest writings, farces and poems, showed powerful,"
8614,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"but uncontrolled, genius. His great popularity began in 1829"
8615,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,with his active entrance into public life. He labored for the
8616,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,enlightemnent of his people through his writings and his personal
8617,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"influence in journeyings all over the land, and especially through"
8618,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"speeches at political meetings. His chief poetic work, the"
8619,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"rationalistic-republican didactic poem, Creation, Man, and"
8620,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Messiah, appeared in 1830. It was severely criticised in a special,"
8621,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"polemical writing by Welhaven (see Note 36), who continued his"
8622,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,attack on all Wergeland's views and teachings in his Norway's Dawn.
8623,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Thus arose the Wergeland-Welhaven conflict, which was carried on"
8624,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"hotly for many years by their adherents, and contributed much to the"
8625,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,intellectual development of the nation. Wergeland was very
8626,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"productive as editor, publicist, and poet. In 1840 he was appointed"
8627,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Keeper of the Archives, and held this government office until his"
8628,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,death.
8629,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,In his own time Wergeland was in spirit the head of the radical-
8630,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"national ""Peasant party,"" which was indeed patriotic and democratic,"
8631,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"but too narrowly Norwegian, in opposition to all that was Danish,"
8632,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"European, foreign.  During the years preceding 1881 he had come to"
8633,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"be in the constitutional conflict a national hero, the idol of the"
8634,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"peasants, as their political power increased."
8635,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Come now the peasants.  In this volume of translations ""peasant"""
8636,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"is the rendering of the Norwegian word ""bonde.""  The meaning is"
8637,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"""farmer,"" i.e., in general the independrnt owner of land, which he"
8638,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,cultivates and on which he lives. In Norway the conditions have for
8639,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"many centuries been more favorable for the ""peasant"" than in any"
8640,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,other European country; this is due to the topography and to the
8641,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,absence of a powerful nobility. At the present time scarcely one-
8642,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,twentieth of the tilled area in Norway is cultivated by tenants.
8643,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"The Norwegian ""peasants"" have always had great self-consciousness in"
8644,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"the best sense, and importance in the political, economic, and"
8645,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"social life of the country, especially since the adoption of the"
8646,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"democratic Constitution of 1814.  Very often the ""peasants"" have an"
8647,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"aristocratic pride in a lineage traced back to ancient ""kings,"" and"
8648,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"in their own distinctively ""Norse"" culture."
8649,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Österdal's ... chieftain, a peasant of large stature, named"
8650,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Hjelmstad, a radical member of the Storting."
8651,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,The old banner. A flag much used in earlier times as specifically
8652,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Norwegian, dating back to King Erik (1280-1299), before the union"
8653,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"with Demnark, showed on a red ground a lion wearing a golden crown"
8654,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and bearing an axe.  As late as 1698 it flew over the fortress
8655,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Akershus in Christiania.  The future, i.e., the independence"
8656,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,realized in 1905 through the dissolution of the union with Sweden.

8659,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"FREDERIK HEGEL. This poem is the last in the third edition (1890),"
8660,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,for which it seems to have been written.  Hegel (1817-1887) was from
8661,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,1850 the head of the Gyldendal publishing house in Copenhagen.
8662,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Björnson made his acquaintance in 1860, and, beginning with King"
8663,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Sverre in 1861, Hegel became Björnson's publisher. In 1865"
8664,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Björnson's influence secured to him Ibsen's works, and later those"
8665,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,of Lie and many other Norwegian authors. The cultural
8666,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,dependence of Norway upon Denmark for centuries had prevented the
8667,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"prosperous growth of the publishing business in the former country,"
8668,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,whose leading publisher  went into bankruptcy soon after 1860. That
8669,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Björnson thus went to Copenhagen with his books may seem to have
8670,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"been a blow to the cause of Norwegian independence, and to have"
8671,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"delayed the rise of a thriving, stable business, but on the other"
8672,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,hand Björnson's action and influence contributed greatly to
8673,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,establish for perhaps half a century a certain dominance of the
8674,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Norwegian spirit in all Scandinavia. For Björnson personally, as his"
8675,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"correspondence with Hegel shows, it was certainly a great good"
8676,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,fortune to gain Hegel as his publisher and later as his friend. This
8677,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Hegel was to all his authors in the most faithful, self-sacrificing"
8678,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"way, and no less their valued financial adviser."

8682,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,OUR LANGUAGE. Written in defense of the Norwegian-Danish speech
8683,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"of the cultured classes and of the cities in Norway, the result of"
8684,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"development and tradition through several centuries, the so-called"
8685,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"Riksmaal (language of the kingdom) or Bymaal (city-language). This,"
8686,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"and with it the higher spiritual interests of the nation, seemed to"
8687,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Björnson to be endangered by the agitation in behalf of the
8688,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Landsmaal (rural language). The Landsmaal arose from a movement
8689,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"after 1814, to make Norway independent of Denmark in language also."
8690,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,The rural dialects were regarded as more purely Norwegian; on them
8691,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,and the Old Norse as a basis was constructed somewhat artificially
8692,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"this standard rural language. It has been gradually perfected, and"
8693,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"is now, in fact, spoken and written a good deal.  Björnson advocated"
8694,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,rather the natural process of making the language of the country
8695,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,more national by gradually introducing dialect words and reforming
8696,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,the orthography. He thought that the Riksmaal thus modified alone
8697,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"could preserve, increase, and transmit the treasures of culture."

8700,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,Kierkegaard. Sören Aaby Kierkegaard (1813-1855) was the most
8701,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"subtle and profound thinker produced by Denmark, with a prose"
8702,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"style noble, poetic, and eloquent. His writings deal with religion,"
8703,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,"ethics, and esthetics, and present his individual, ideal conception"
8704,NORWEGIAN SEAMEN'S SONG.,of Christianity.
