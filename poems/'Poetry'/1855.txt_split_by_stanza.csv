14,ELEANOR CHARLOTTE SELLAR,"‘_Ban and Arrière Ban_!’ _a host_ _Broken_, _beaten_, _all unled_, _They return as doth a ghost_ _From the dead_. "
15,ELEANOR CHARLOTTE SELLAR,"_Sad or glad my rallied rhymes_, _Sought our dusty papers through_, _For the sake of other times_ _Come to you_. "
16,ELEANOR CHARLOTTE SELLAR,"_Times and places new we know_, _Faces fresh and seasons strange_ _But the friends of long ago_ _Do not change_. "
17,ELEANOR CHARLOTTE SELLAR,"MANY of the verses in this collection have appeared in Magazines: ‘How they held the Bass’ was in ‘Blackwood’s Magazine’; the ‘Ballad of the Philanthropist’ in ‘Punch’; ‘Calais Sands’ in ‘The Magazine of Art’ (Messrs. Cassell and Co.); and others are recaptured from ‘Longman’s Magazine,’ ‘Scribner’s,’ ‘The Illustrated London News,’ ‘The English Illustrated Magazine,’ ‘Wit and Wisdom’ (lines from Omar Khayyam), ‘The St. James’s Gazette,’ and possibly other serials.  Some pieces are from commendatory verses for books, as for Mr. Jacobs’s ‘Æsop’; some are from Mr. Rider Haggard’s ‘World’s Desire,’ and ‘Cleopatra,’ two are from Kirk’s ‘Secret Commonwealth’ (Nutt, 1893), and ‘Neiges d’Antan,’ are from the author’s ‘Ballads and Lyrics of Old France,’ now long out of print.

20,ERRATUM,ERRATUM 
21,ERRATUM,"READER, a blot hath escaped the watchfulness of the setter forth: if thou wilt thou mayst amend it.  The sonnet on the forty-fourth page, against all right Italianate laws, hath but thirteen lines withal: add another to thy liking, if thou art a Maker; or, if thou art none, even be content with what is set before thee.  If it be scant measure, be sure it is choicely good. "
22,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC 
23,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,"DARK Lily without blame, Not upon us the shame, Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true, They, by the Maiden’s side, Victorious fought and died, One stood by thee that fiery torment through, Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed, And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last. "
24,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,"Once only didst thou see In artist’s imagery, Thine own face painted, and that precious thing Was in an Archer’s hand From the leal Northern land. Alas, what price would not thy people bring To win that portrait of the ruinous Gulf of devouring years that hide the Maid from us! "
25,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,"Born of a lowly line, Noteless as once was thine, One of that name I would were kin to me, Who, in the Scottish Guard Won this for his reward, To fight for France, and memory of thee: Not upon us, dark Lily without blame, Not on the North may fall the shadow of that shame. "
26,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,"On France and England both The shame of broken troth, Of coward hate and treason black must be; If England slew thee, France Sent not one word, one lance, One coin to rescue or to ransom thee. And still thy Church unto the Maid denies The halo and the palms, the Beatific prize. "
27,A SCOT TO JEANNE D’ARC,"But yet thy people calls Within the rescued walls Of Orleans; and makes its prayer to thee; What though the Church have chidden These orisons forbidden, Yet art thou with this earth’s immortal Three, With him in Athens that of hemlock died, And with thy Master dear whom the world crucified.

28,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693 
29,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,Time of Narrating—1743 
30,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"YE hae heard Whigs crack o’ the Saints in the Bass, my faith, a gruesome tale; How the Remnant paid at a tippeny rate, for a quart o’ ha’penny ale! But I’ll tell ye anither tale o’ the Bass, that’ll hearten ye up to hear, Sae I pledge ye to Middleton first in a glass, and a health to the Young Chevalier! "
31,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"The Bass stands frae North Berwick Law a league or less to sea, About its feet the breakers beat, abune the sea-maws flee, There’s castle stark and dungeon dark, wherein the godly lay, That made their rant for the Covenant through mony a weary day. For twal’ years lang the caverns rang wi’ preaching, prayer, and psalm, Ye’d think the winds were soughing wild, when a’ the winds were calm, There wad they preach, each Saint to each, and glower as the soldiers pass, And Peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass, As she stood and daffed, while the warders laughed, and wha sae blithe as she, But a wind o’ ill worked his warlock will, and flang her out to sea. Then wha sae bright as the Saints that night, and an angel came, say they, And sang in the cell where the Righteous dwell, but he took na a Saint away. There yet might they be, for nane could flee, and nane daur’d break the jail, And still the sobbing o’ the sea might mix wi’ their warlock wail, But then came in black echty-echt, and bluidy echty-nine, Wi’ Cess, and Press, and Presbytery, and a’ the dule sin’ syne, The Saints won free wi’ the power o’ the key, and cavaliers maun pine! It was Halyburton, Middleton, and Roy and young Dunbar, That Livingstone took on Cromdale haughs, in the last fight of the war: And they were warded in the Bass, till the time they should be slain, Where bluidy Mitchell, and Blackader, and Earlston lang had lain; Four lads alone, ’gainst a garrison, but Glory crowns their names, For they brought it to pass that they took the Bass, and they held it for King James! "
32,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"It isna by preaching half the night, ye’ll burst a dungeon door, It wasna by dint o’ psalmody they broke the hold, they four, For lang years three that rock in the sea bade Wullie Wanbeard gae swing, And England and Scotland fause may be, but the Bass Rock stands for the King! "
33,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"There’s but ae pass gangs up the Bass, it’s guarded wi’ strong gates four, And still as the soldiers went to the sea, they steikit them, door by door, And this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their coals on shore. Thither all had gone, save three men alone: then Middleton gripped his man, Halyburton felled the sergeant lad, Dunbar seized the gunner, Swan; Roy bound their hands, in hempen bands, and the Cavaliers were free. And they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down wi’ the boat by the sea! Then Middleton cried frae the high cliff-side, and his voice garr’d the auld rocks ring, ‘Will ye stand or flee by the land or sea, for I hold the Bass for the King?’ "
34,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"They had nae desire to face the fire; it was mair than men might do, So they e’en sailed back in the auld coal-smack, a sorry and shame-faced crew, And they hirpled doun to Edinburgh toun, wi’ the story of their shames, How the prisoners bold had broken hold, and kept the Bass for King James. "
35,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"King James he has sent them guns and men, and the Whigs they guard the Bass, But they never could catch the Cavaliers, who took toll of ships that pass, They fared wild and free as the birds o’ the sea, and at night they went on the wing, And they lifted the kye o’ Whigs far and nigh, and they revelled and drank to the King. "
36,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"Then Wullie Wanbeard sends his ships to siege the Bass in form, And first shall they break the fortress down, and syne the Rock they’ll storm. After twa days’ fight they fled in the night, and glad eneuch to go, With their rigging rent, and their powder spent, and many a man laid low. "
37,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"So for lang years three did they sweep the sea, but a closer watch was set, Till nae food had they, but twa ounce a day o’ meal was the maist they’d get. And men fight but tame on an empty wame, so they sent a flag o’ truce, And blithe were the Privy Council then, when the Whigs had heard that news. Twa Lords they sent wi’ a strang intent to be dour on each Cavalier, But wi’ French cakes fine, and his last drap o’ wine, did Middleton make them cheer, On the muzzles o’ guns he put coats and caps, and he set them aboot the wa’s, And the Whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the Rightfu’ Cause. So he got a’ he craved, and his men were saved, and nane might say them nay, Wi’ sword by side, and flag o’ pride, free men might they gang their way, They might fare to France, they might bide at hame, and the better their grace to buy, Wullie Wanbeard’s purse maun pay the keep o’ the men that did him defy! "
38,HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES—1691–1693,"Men never hae gotten sic terms o’ peace since first men went to war, As got Halyburton, and Middleton, and Roy, and the young Dunbar. Sae I drink to ye here, _To the Young Chevalier_!  I hae said ye an auld man’s say, And there may hae been mightier deeds of arms, but there never was nane sae gay! "

41,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,"BEAUTIFUL face of a child, Lighted with laughter and glee, Mirthful, and tender, and wild, My heart is heavy for thee! "
42,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,1744 
43,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,"Beautiful face of a youth, As an eagle poised to fly forth, To the old land loyal of truth, To the hills and the sounds of the North: Fair face, daring and proud, Lo! the shadow of doom, even now, The fate of thy line, like a cloud, Rests on the grace of thy brow! "
44,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,1773 
45,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,"Cruel and angry face, Hateful and heavy with wine, Where are the gladness, the grace, The beauty, the mirth that were thine? "
46,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,"Ah, my Prince, it were well,— Hadst thou to the gods been dear,— To have fallen where Keppoch fell, With the war-pipe loud in thine ear! To have died with never a stain On the fair White Rose of Renown, To have fallen, fighting in vain, For thy father, thy faith, and thy crown! More than thy marble pile, With its women weeping for thee, Were to dream in thine ancient isle, To the endless dirge of the sea! But the Fates deemed otherwise, Far thou sleepest from home, From the tears of the Northern skies, In the secular dust of Rome. "
47,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,* * * 
48,THREE PORTRAITS OF PRINCE CHARLES,"A city of death and the dead, But thither a pilgrim came, Wearing on weary head The crowns of years and fame: Little the Lucrine lake Or Tivoli said to him, Scarce did the memories wake Of the far-off years and dim. For he stood by Avernus’ shore, But he dreamed of a Northern glen And he murmured, over and o’er, ‘_For Charlie and his men_:’ And his feet, to death that went, Crept forth to St. Peter’s shrine, And the latest Minstrel bent O’er the last of the Stuart line. "

51,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"THE Paradise they bid us fast to win Hath Wine and Women; is it then a sin To live as we shall live in Paradise, And make a Heaven of Earth, ere Heaven begin? "
52,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"The wise may search the world from end to end, From dusty nook to dusty nook, my friend, And nothing better find than girls and wine, Of all the things they neither make nor mend. "
53,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"Nay, listen thou who, walking on Life’s way, Hast seen no lovelock of thy love’s grow grey Listen, and love thy life, and let the Wheel Of Heaven go spinning its own wilful way. "
54,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"Man is a flagon, and his soul the wine, Man is a lamp, wherein the Soul doth shine, Man is a shaken reed, wherein that wind, The Soul, doth ever rustle and repine. "
55,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"Each morn I say, to-night I will repent, Repent! and each night go the way I went— The way of Wine; but now that reigns the rose, Lord of Repentance, rage not, but relent. "
56,MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY M‘CARTHY,"I wish to drink of wine—so deep, so deep— The scent of wine my sepulchre shall steep, And they, the revellers by Omar’s tomb, Shall breathe it, and in Wine shall fall asleep. "

60,ÆSOP,"And in the lion or the frog— In all the life of moor and fen, In ass and peacock, stork and dog, He read similitudes of men. "
61,ÆSOP,"‘Of these, from those,’ he cried, ‘we come, Our hearts, our brains descend from these.’ And lo! the Beasts no more were dumb, But answered out of brakes and trees: "
62,ÆSOP,"‘Not ours,’ they cried; ‘Degenerate, If ours at all,’ they cried again, ‘Ye fools, who war with God and Fate, Who strive and toil: strange race of men. "
63,ÆSOP,"‘For _we_ are neither bond nor free, For _we_ have neither slaves nor kings, But near to Nature’s heart are we, And conscious of her secret things. "
64,ÆSOP,"‘Content are we to fall asleep, And well content to wake no more, We do not laugh, we do not weep, Nor look behind us and before; "

69,LES ROSES DE SÂDI,"THIS morning I vowed I would bring thee my Roses, They were thrust in the band that my bodice encloses, But the breast-knots were broken, the Roses went free. The breast-knots were broken; the Roses together Floated forth on the wings of the wind and the weather, And they drifted afar down the streams of the sea. "
70,LES ROSES DE SÂDI,"And the sea was as red as when sunset uncloses, But my raiment is sweet from the scent of the Roses, Thou shalt know, Love, how fragrant a memory can be. "

72,SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER,SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER 
73,SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER,"IN front he saw the donjon tall Deep in the woods, and stayed to scan The guards that slept along the wall, Or dozed upon the bartizan. He marked the drowsy flag that hung Unwaved by wind, unfrayed by shower, He listened to the birds that sung _Go forth and win the haunted tower_! The tangled brake made way for him, The twisted brambles bent aside; And lo, he pierced the forest dim, And lo, he won the fairy bride! For _he_ was young, but ah! we find, All we, whose beards are flecked with grey, Our fairy castle’s far behind, We watch it from the darkling way: ’Twas ours, that palace, in our youth, We revelled there in happy cheer: Who scarce dare visit now in sooth, Le Vieux Château de Souvenir! For not the boughs of forest green Begird that castle far away, There is a mist where we have been That weeps about it, cold and grey. And if we seek to travel back ’Tis through a thicket dim and sere, With many a grave beside the track, And many a haunting form of fear. Dead leaves are wet among the moss, With weed and thistle overgrown— A ruined barge within the fosse, A castle built of crumbling stone! The drawbridge drops from rusty chains, There comes no challenge from the hold; No squire, nor dame, nor knight remains, Of all who dwelt with us of old. And there is silence in the hall No sound of songs, no ray of fire; But gloom where all was glad, and all Is darkened with a vain desire. And every picture’s fading fast, Of fair Jehanne, or Cydalise. Lo, the white shadows hurrying past, Below the boughs of dripping trees! "
74,SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER,* * * 
75,SUGGESTED BY A POEM OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER,"Ah rise, and march, and look not back, Now the long way has brought us here; We may not turn and seek the track To the old Château de Souvenir! "
76,BOAT-SONG,BOAT-SONG 
77,BOAT-SONG,"ADRIFT, with starlit skies above, With starlit seas below, We move with all the suns that move, With all the seas that flow: For, bond or free, earth, sky, and sea, Wheel with one central will, And thy heart drifteth on to me, And only Time stands still. "
78,BOAT-SONG,"Between two shores of death we drift, Behind are things forgot, Before, the tide is racing swift To shores man knoweth not. Above, the sky is far and cold, Below, the moaning sea Sweeps o’er the loves that were of old, But thou, Love, love thou me. "
79,BOAT-SONG,"Ah, lonely are the ocean ways, And dangerous the deep, And frail the fairy barque that strays Above the seas asleep. Ah, toil no more with helm or oar, We drift, or bond or free, On yon far shore the breakers roar, But thou, Love, love thou me! "
80,LOST LOVE,LOST LOVE 
81,LOST LOVE,"WHO wins his Love shall lose her, Who loses her shall gain, For still the spirit woos her, A soul without a stain; And Memory still pursues her With longings not in vain! "
82,LOST LOVE,"He loses her who gains her, Who watches day by day The dust of time that stains her, The griefs that leave her grey, The flesh that yet enchains her Whose grace hath passed away! "
83,LOST LOVE,"Oh, happier he who gains not The Love some seem to gain: The joy that custom stains not Shall still with him remain, The loveliness that wanes not, The Love that ne’er can wane. "
84,LOST LOVE,"In dreams she grows not older The lands of Dream among, Though all the world wax colder, Though all the songs be sung, In dreams doth he behold her Still fair and kind and young. "

87,THE PROMISE OF HELEN,She that another wed Breaks from her vow; She that hath long been dead Wakes for thee now. 
88,THE PROMISE OF HELEN,"Dreams haunt the hapless bed, Ghosts haunt the night, Life crowns her living head, Love and Delight. "

"
120,BALLADE OF YULE,"Amid the snow the birds are fed, The snow lies deep on lawn and lea, The skies are shining overhead, The robin’s tame that was so free.

He heard, he saw, he knew too well The secrets of your fairy clan; You stole him from the haunted dell, Who never more was seen of man. Now far from heaven, and safe from hell, Unknown of earth, he wanders free. Would that he might return and tell Of his mysterious Company! For we have tired the Folk of Peace; No more they tax our corn and oil; Their dances on the moorland cease, The Brownie stints his wonted toil. No more shall any shepherd meet The ladies of the fairy clan, Nor are their deathly kisses sweet On lips of any earthly man. And half I envy him who now, Clothed in her Court’s enchanted green, By moonlit loch or mountain’s brow Is Chaplain to the Fairy Queen. "

"
176,MIST,"Much do I bar the matron, man, or lass Who cries ‘How lovely!’ and who does not spare When light and shadow on the mountain pass,— Shadow and light, and gleams exceeding fair, O’er rock, and glade, and glen,—to shout, the Ass, To me, to me the Poet, ‘Oh, look there!’ "

"
179,LINES,"HOW solemn is the front of this Hotel, When now the hills are swathed in modest mist, And none can speak of scenery, nor tell Of ‘tints of amber,’ or of ‘amethyst.’ Here once thy daughters, young Romance, did dwell, Here _Sara_ flirted with whoever list, _Belinda_ loved not wisely but too well, And _Mr. Ford_ played the Philologist! Haunted the house is, and the balcony Where that fond Matron knew her Lover near, And here we sit, and wait for tea, and sigh, While the sad rain sobs in the sullen mere, And all our hearts go forth into the cry, Would that the teller of the tale were here!

When arm was freely linked with arm Beneath the College limes, When Sunday grinds possessed a charm Denied to _College Rhymes_: When ices were in much request Beside the April fire, When men were very strangely dressed By Standen or by Prior.

241,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"The tenants next were chiefly vexed By spectres grim and grey. A Headless Ghost annoyed them most, And so they did not stay. The next in turn saw corpse lights burn, And also a Banshie, A spectral Hand they could not stand, And left the House to me. "
242,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Then came my friends for divers ends, Some curious, some afraid; No direr pest disturbed their rest Than a neat chambermaid. The grisly halls were gay with balls, One melancholy nook Where ghosts _galore_ were seen before Now yielded ne’er a spook. "
243,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When man and maid, all unafraid, ‘Sat out’ upon the stairs, No spectre dread, with feet of lead, Came past them unawares. I know not why, but alway I Have found that it is so, That when the glum Researchers come The brutes of bogeys—go! "
244,TO THE GENTLE READER,TO THE GENTLE READER 
245,TO THE GENTLE READER,"‘A French writer (whom I love well) speaks of three kinds of companions,—men, women, and books.’ "
246,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,SIR JOHN DAVYS. 
247,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"THREE kinds of companions, men, women, and books, Were enough, said the elderly Sage, for his ends. And the women we deem that he chose for their looks, And the men for their cellars: the books were his friends: ‘Man delights me not,’ often, ‘nor woman,’ but books Are the best of good comrades in loneliest nooks. "
248,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"For man will be wrangling—for woman will fret About anything infinitesimal small: Like the Sage in our Plato, I’m ‘anxious to get On the side’—on the sunnier side—‘of a wall.’ Let the wind of the world toss the nations like rooks, If only you’ll leave me at peace with my Books. "
249,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"And which are my books? why, ’tis much as you please, For, given ’tis a book, it can hardly be wrong, And Bradshaw himself I can study with ease, Though for choice I might call for a Sermon or Song; And Locker on London, and Sala on Cooks, ‘Tom Brown,’ and Plotinus, they’re all of them Books. "
250,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"There’s Fielding to lap one in currents of mirth; There’s Herrick to sing of a flower or a fay; Or good Maître Françoys to bring one to earth, If Shelley or Coleridge have snatched one away: There’s Müller on Speech, there is Gurney on Spooks, There is Tylor on Totems, there’s all sorts of Books. "
251,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"There’s roaming in regions where every one’s been, Encounters where no one was ever before, There’s ‘Leaves’ from the Highlands we owe to the Queen, There’s Holly’s and Leo’s adventures in Kôr: There’s Tanner who dwelt with Pawnees and Chinooks, You can cover a great deal of country in Books. "
252,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"There are books, highly thought of, that nobody reads, There is Geusius’ dearly delectable tome Of the Cannibal—he on his neighbour who feeds— And in blood-red morocco ’tis bound, by Derome; There’s Montaigne here (a Foppens), there’s Roberts (on Flukes), There’s Elzevirs, Aldines, and Gryphius’ Books. "
253,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"There’s Bunyan, there’s Walton, in early editions, There’s many a quarto uncommonly rare; There’s quaint old Quevedo adream with his visions, There’s Johnson the portly, and Burton the spare; There’s Boston of Ettrick, who preached of the ‘Crooks In the Lots’ of us mortals, who bargain for Books. "
254,SIR JOHN DAVYS.,"There’s Ruskin to keep one exclaiming ‘What next?’ There’s Browning to puzzle, and Gilbert to chaff, And Marcus Aurelius to soothe one if vexed, And good MARCUS TVAINUS to lend you a laugh; There be capital tomes that are filled with fly-hooks, And I’ve frequently found them the best kind of Books. "
255,THE SONNET,THE SONNET 
256,THE SONNET,"POET, beware!  The sonnet’s primrose path Is all too tempting for thy feet to tread. Not on this journey shalt thou earn thy bread, Because the sated reader roars in wrath: ‘Little indeed to say the singer hath, And little sense in all that he hath said; Such rhymes are lightly writ but hardly read, And naught but stubble is his aftermath!’ "
257,THE SONNET,"Then shall he cast that bonny book of thine Where the extreme waste-paper basket gapes, There shall thy futile fancies peak and pine, With other minor poets, pallid shapes, Who come a long way short of the divine, Tormented souls of imitative apes. "
258,THE TOURNAY OF THE HEROES,THE TOURNAY OF THE HEROES 
259,THE TOURNAY OF THE HEROES,"HO, warders, cry a tournay! ho, heralds, call the knights! What gallant lance for old Romance ’gainst modern fiction fights? The lists are set, the Knights are met, I ween, a dread array, St. Chad to shield, a stricken field shall we behold to-day! First to the Northern barriers pricks Roland of Roncesvaux, And by his side, in knightly pride, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, The Templar rideth by his rein, two gallant foes were they; And proud to see, _le brave Bussy_ his colours doth display. "
260,THE TOURNAY OF THE HEROES,"Ready at need he comes with speed, William of Deloraine, And Hereward the Wake himself is pricking o’er the plain. The good knight of La Mancha’s here, here is Sir Amyas Leigh, And Eric of the gold hair, pride of Northern chivalry. There shines the steel of Alan Breck, the sword of Athos shines, Dalgetty on Gustavus rides along the marshalled lines, With many a knight of sunny France the Cid has marched from Spain, And Götz the Iron-handed leads the lances of Almain. "
261,THE TOURNAY OF THE HEROES,"But who upon the Modern side are champions?  With the sleeve Adorned of his false lady-love, rides glorious David Grieve, A bookseller sometime was he, in a provincial town, But now before his iron mace go horse and rider down. Ho, Robert Elsmere! count thy beads; lo, champion of the fray, With brandished colt, comes Felix Holt, all of the Modern day. And Silas Lapham’s six-shooter is cocked: the Colonel’s spry! There spurs the wary Egoist, defiance in his eye; There Zola’s ragged regiment comes, with dynamite in hand, And Flaubert’s crew of country doctors devastate the land. On Robert Elsmere Friar Tuck falls with his quarter-staff, _Nom Dé_! to see the clerics fight might make the sourest laugh! They meet, they shock, full many a knight is smitten on the crown, So keep us good St. Geneviève, Umslopogaas is down! About the mace of David Grieve his blood is flowing red, Alas for ancient chivalry, _le brave Bussy_ is sped! Yet where the sombre Templar rides the Modern caitiffs fly, The Mummer (of _The Mummer’s Wife_) has got it in the eye, From Felix Holt his patent Colt hath not averted fate, And Silas Lapham’s smitten fair, right through his gallant pate. There Dan Deronda reels and falls, a hero sore surprised; _Ha_, _Beauséant_! still may such fate befall the Circumcised! The Egoist is flying fast from him of Ivanhoe: Beneath the axe of Skalagrim fall prigs at every blow: The ragged Zolaists have fled, screaming ‘_We are betrayed_,’ But loyal Alan Breck is shent, stabbed through the Stuart plaid; In sooth it is a grimly sight, so fast the heroes fall, Three volumes fell could scarcely tell the fortunes of them all. At length but two are left on ground, and David Grieve is one. _Ma foy_, what deeds of derring-do that bookseller hath done! The other, mark the giant frame, the great portentous fist! ’Tis Porthos!  David Grieve may call on Kuenen an he list. The swords are crossed; _Doublez_, _dégagez_, _vite_! great Porthos calls, And David drops, that secret _botte_ hath pierced his overalls! And goodly Porthos, as of old the famed Orthryades, Raises the trophy of the fight, then falling on his knees, He writes in gore upon his shield, ‘Romance, Romance, has won!’ And blood-red on that stricken field goes down the angry sun. Night falls upon the field of death, night on the darkling lea: Oh send us such a tournay soon, and send me there to see! "
262,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST 
263,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"POMONA Road and Gardens, N., Were pure as they were fair— In other districts much I fear, That vulgar language shocks the ear, But brawling wives or noisy men Were never heard of _there_. "
264,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"No burglar fixed his dread abode In that secure retreat, There were no public-houses nigh, But chapels low and churches high, You might have thought Pomona Road A quite ideal beat! "
265,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"Yet that was not at all the view Taken by B. 13. That active and intelligent Policeman deemed that he was meant Profound detective deeds to do, And that repose was mean. "
266,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"Now there was nothing to detect Pomona Road along— None faked a cly, nor cracked a crib, Nor prigged a wipe, nor told a fib,— Minds cultivated and select Slip rarely into wrong! "
267,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"Thus bored to desolation went The Peeler on his beat; He know not Love, he did not care, If Love be born on mountains bare; Nay, crime to punish, or prevent, Was more than dalliance sweet! "
268,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"The weary wanderer, day by day, Was marked by Howard Fry— A neighbouring philanthropist, Who saw what that Policeman missed— A sympathetic ‘Well-a-day’ He’d moan, and pipe his eye. "
269,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"‘What _can_ I do,’ asked Howard Fry, ‘To soothe that brother’s pain? His glance when first we met was keen, Most martial and erect his mien’ (What mien may mean, I know not I) ‘But _he_ must joy again.’ "
270,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"‘I’ll start on a career of crime, I will,’ said Howard Fry— He spake and acted!  Deeds of bale (With which I do not stain my tale) He wrought like mad time after time, Yet wrought them blushfully. "
271,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"And now when ’buses night by night Were stopped, conductors slain, When youths and men, and maids unwed, Were stabbed or knocked upon the head, Then B. 13 grew sternly bright, And was himself again! "
272,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"Pomona Road and Gardens, N., Are now a name of fear. Commercial travellers flee in haste, Revolvers girt about the waist Are worn by city gentlemen Who have their mansions near. "
273,BALLAD OF THE PHILANTHROPIST,"But B. 13 elated goes, Detection in his eye; While Howard Fry does deeds of bale (With which I do not stain my tale) To lighten that Policeman’s woes, But does them blushfully. "

278,IN ERCILDOUNE,"IN light of sunrise and sunsetting, The long days lingered, in forgetting That ever passion, keen to hold What may not tarry, was of old Beyond the doubtful stream whose flood Runs red waist-high with slain men’s blood. "
279,IN ERCILDOUNE,"Was beauty once a thing that died? Was pleasure never satisfied? Was rest still broken by the vain Desire of action, bringing pain, To die in vapid rest again? All this was quite forgotten, there No winter brought us cold and care, Nor spring gave promise unfulfilled, Nor, with the heavy summer killed, The languid days droop autumnwards. So magical a season guards The constant prime of a green June. So slumbrous is the river’s tune, That knows no thunder of rushing rains, Nor ever in the summer wanes, Like waters of the summer-time In lands far from the fairy clime. "
280,IN ERCILDOUNE,"Alas! no words can bring the bloom Of Fairyland, the lost perfume. The sweet low light, the magic air, To minds of who have not been there: Alas! no words, nor any spell Can lull the heart that knows too well The towers that by the river stand, The lost fair world of Fairyland. "
281,IN ERCILDOUNE,"Ah, would that I had never been The lover of the Fairy Queen. Or would that I again might be Asleep below the Eildon Tree, And see her ride the forest way As on that morning of the May! "
282,IN ERCILDOUNE,"Or would that through the little town, The grey old place of Ercildoune, And all along the sleepy street The soft fall of the white deer’s feet Came, with the mystical command, That I must back to Fairy Land! "

"
311,FROM RONSARD,"Thou know’st, O Moon, the bitter power of Love. ’Tis told how shepherd Pan found ways to move With a small gift thy heart; and of your grace, Sweet stars, be kind to this not alien fire, Because on earth ye did not scorn desire, Bethink ye, now ye hold your heavenly place. "

315,FROM RONSARD,"So this, the perfect beauty of our days, When heaven and earth were vocal of her praise, The fates have slain, and her sweet soul reposes: And tears I bring, and sighs, and on her tomb Pour milk, and scatter buds of many a bloom, That, dead as living, Rose may be with roses. "

318,THE POET’S APOLOGY,"Any one who takes her in May observe she’s rather thin; Little more than bone and skin Is the Muse; Scanty sacrifice she won When her very best she’d done, And at her they poked their fun, In Reviews. "
319,THE POET’S APOLOGY,"‘Rhymes,’ in truth, ‘are stubborn things.’ And to Rhyme she clung, and clings, But whatever song she sings Scarcely sells. If her tone be grave, they say ‘Give us something rather gay.’ If she’s skittish, then they pray ‘Something else!’ "
320,THE POET’S APOLOGY,"Much she loved, for wading shod, To go forth with line and rod, Loved the heather, and the sod, Loved to rest On the crystal river’s brim Where she saw the fishes swim, And she heard the thrushes’ hymn, By the Test! "
321,THE POET’S APOLOGY,"She, whatever way she went, Friendly was and innocent, Little need the Bard repent Of her lay. Of the babble and the rhyme, And the imitative chime That amused him on a time,— Now he’s grey. "

324,NOTES,"Jeanne d’Arc is said to have led a Scottish force at Lagny, when she defeated the Burgundian, Franquet d’Arras.  A Scottish artist painted her banner; he was a James Polwarth, or a Hume of Polwarth, according to a conjecture of Mr. Hill Burton’s.  A monk of Dunfermline, who continued Fordun’s Chronicle, avers that he was with the Maiden in her campaigns, and at her martyrdom.  He calls her _Puella a spiritu sancto excitata_. Unluckily his manuscript breaks off in the middle of a sentence.  At her trial, Jeanne said that she had only once seen her own portrait: it was in the hands of a Scottish archer.  The story of the white dove which passed from her lips as they opened to her last cry of _Jesus_! was reported at the trial for her Rehabilitation (1450–56). "

327,NOTES,_Thy Church unto the Maid Denies_. 
328,NOTES,"These verses were written, curiously enough, the day before the Maiden was raised to the rank of ‘Venerable,’ a step towards her canonisation, which, we trust, will not be long delayed.  It is not easy for any one to understand the whole miracle of the life and death of Jeanne d’Arc, and the absolutely unparalleled grandeur and charm of her character, without studying the full records of both her trials, as collected and published by M. Quicherat, for the Société de l’Histoire de France. "
329,NOTES,Page 4. _How they held the Bass_. 
330,NOTES,"This story is versified from the account in _Memoirs of the Rev. John Blackader_, by Andrew Crichton, Minister of the Gospel.  Second Edition. Edinburgh, 1826.  Dunbar was retained as a prisoner, when negotiations for surrender, in 1691, were broken off by Middleton’s return with supplies.  Halyburton was, it seems, captured later, and only escaped hanging by virtue of the terms extorted by Middleton.  Patrick Walker tells the tale of Peden and the girl.  Wodrow, in his _Analecta_, has the story of the Angel, or other shining spiritual presence, which is removed from its context in the ballad.  The sufferings from weak beer are quoted in Mr. Blackader’s Memoirs.  Mitchell was the undeniably brave Covenanter who shot at Sharp, and hit the Bishop of the Orkneys.  He was tortured, and, by an act of perjury (probably unconscious) on the part of Lauderdale, was hanged.  The sentiments of the poem are such as an old cavalier, surviving to 1743, might perhaps have entertained.  ‘Wullie Wanbeard’ is a Jacobite name for the Prince of Orange, perhaps invented only by the post-Jacobite sentiment of the early nineteenth century.
