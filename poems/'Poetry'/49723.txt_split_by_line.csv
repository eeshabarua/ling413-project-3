71,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
72,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
73,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Oliver Goldsmith, the fifth child of Charles and Ann Goldsmith,"
74,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"was born at Pallas, a hamlet of the parish of Forney, county of"
75,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Longford, Ireland, November 10th, 1728. His father, the “Preacher”"
76,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of the “Deserted Village,” having been presented to the Rectory of"
77,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Kilkenny-West, about the year 1730, removed his family to Lissoy, the"
78,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“Auburn” of the Poet. The “modest mansion” is a ruin, or, by this time,"
79,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"has quite disappeared. His first schoolmaster is described, by one"
80,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"who remembered him, as a man “stern to view,” in whose “morning face”"
81,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],the disasters of the day might be easily read. Goldsmith made small
82,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"progress under the ferule of Paddy Burns, and, after being for some"
83,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"time a pupil in the diocesan school of Elphin, he was placed with a"
84,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"competent teacher at Athlone, where he remained two years. He was then"
85,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"transferred to the care of Mr. Hughes, vicar of Shruel, who treated him"
86,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"with kindness, and whom he always mentioned with respect and gratitude."
87,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],His eldest sister has given a specimen of her brother’s early and ready
88,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],humour. A large company of young people had assembled in his uncle’s
89,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"house, at Elphin, and Oliver, then nine years old, was desired to dance"
90,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"a hornpipe, under very unfavourable circumstances, for his figure"
91,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"was short and thick, and the marks of recent small-pox were still"
92,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"conspicuous. A young man, who played the violin, compared him to Æsop"
93,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"dancing; but Oliver, stopping short in the performance, immediately"
94,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],disabled his satirist with a sharp epigram:--
95,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
96,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“Our herald hath proclaim’d this saying,"
97,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"See Æsop dancing, and his monkey playing.”"
98,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
99,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"On the 11th of June, 1745, he was admitted a Sizar of Trinity College,"
100,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],Dublin--a fact which denoted a considerable proficiency in classical
101,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"learning; but he was unfortunate in his tutor, who deserved, and has"
102,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"won, the title of “Savage;” and, perhaps, the promise of Oliver was"
103,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"blighted by his severity. He neglected his studies, and was seen"
104,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“perpetually lounging about the college gates.” We find him elected,"
105,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"June 15th, 1747, to an Exhibition, on the foundation of Erasmus Smith,"
106,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"obtaining a premium at the Christmas examination, and, after a delay"
107,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of two years, taking his Bachelor’s degree, February 27th, 1750. His"
108,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"father died in 1747, but he found a second parent in the Rev Thomas"
109,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Contarine, who was descended from a noble ancestry in Venice, and had"
110,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],been a contemporary and friend of Berkeley. The relatives of the poet
111,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"now advised him to “go into orders,” and yielding to the persuasion"
112,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of Mr. Contarine, he presented himself before the Bishop of Elphin,"
113,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],and was rejected. Tradition ascribes the failure to his uncanonical
114,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"costume, and the episcopal dislike of scarlet breeches."
115,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
116,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"His kind friends might now, as he afterwards wrote, be perfectly"
117,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],satisfied that he was undone; but they did not abandon him. He was
118,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"enabled to proceed to Edinburgh, towards the end of 1752, where he"
119,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],attended the lectures of Monro and the other Medical Professors.
120,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Scotland did not please him. “Shall I tire you,” he wrote to a friend,"
121,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“with a description of this unfruitful country, where I must lead you"
122,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"over their hills all brown with heath, or their valleys scarcely able"
123,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],to feed a rabbit? Man alone seems to be the only creature who has
124,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],arrived to the natural size in this poor soil.”
125,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
126,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],His design of completing his studies at Leyden was nearly frustrated
127,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"by an act of generous imprudence, from which two college friends set"
128,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"him free. From Leyden, in the April or May of 1754, he sent a letter"
129,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"to Mr. Contarine, containing an account of his journey, and some"
130,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"lively sketches of the “downright Hollander,” with lank hair, laced"
131,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"hat, no coat, and seven waistcoats, the lady with her portable stove,"
132,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"the lugubrious Harlequin, and the domestic interior, which reminded"
133,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],him of a magnificent Egyptian temple dedicated to an ox. He remained
134,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"in Leyden nearly a year, deriving small benefit from the instruction"
135,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of the Professors, who, with the exception of Gaubius, the teacher of"
136,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Chemistry, were as indolent as himself. Meanwhile, the necessaries of"
137,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"life were costly, and the attractions of the gaming-table proved to"
138,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"be overpowering and ruinous. At length, having emptied his purse, and"
139,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"reduced his wardrobe to a single shirt, he boldly resolved to make the"
140,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],tour of Europe. This characteristic chapter of the Poet’s history is
141,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"yet to be written, if his lost letters should ever be recovered. The"
142,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],interesting and copious narrative which he communicated to Dr. Radcliff
143,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],is known to have been destroyed by fire.
144,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
145,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"He commenced his travels about February, 1755. “A good voice,” adopting"
146,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his own account of an earlier adventurer, “and a trifling skill"
147,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"in music, were the only finances he had to support an undertaking"
148,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"so extensive.” Thus he journeyed, and at night sang at the doors"
149,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of peasants’ houses, to get himself a lodging. Once or twice, he"
150,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“attempted to play to people of fashion,” but they despised his"
151,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"performance, and never rewarded him even with a trifle. We are told"
152,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"by Bishop Percy, that he reached Padua, and visited all the northern"
153,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"parts of Italy, returning, on foot, through France, and landing at"
154,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Dover, about the beginning of the war, in 1756. We may believe his own"
155,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"assurance, that he fought his way homewards, examining mankind with"
156,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"near eyes, and seeing both sides of the picture."
157,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
158,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"He appeared in London, without means or interest. England, he"
159,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"complained, was a country, where being born an Irishman was sufficient"
160,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],to keep a man unemployed. With much difficulty he obtained the
161,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],situation of usher at a school. Johnson did not remember the occupation
162,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"with a fiercer disgust; and the redolent French teacher, papering his"
163,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"curls at night, was a frequent spectre of his memory. A migration from"
164,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],the school-room to the chemist’s shop slightly improved his condition.
165,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Better days were coming. By the aid of an Edinburgh acquaintance,"
166,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Dr. Sleigh, and other friends, he was “set up” as a practitioner at"
167,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Bankside, Southwark, where, in his pleasant confession, he got plenty"
168,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of patients, but no fees. A physician, Dr. Farr, who had known him"
169,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"in Scotland, thus describes his appearance:--“He called upon me one"
170,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"morning, before I was up, and, on entering the room, I recognized my"
171,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"old acquaintance, dressed in a rusty, full-trimmed black suit, with"
172,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his pockets full of papers, which instantly reminded me of the poet"
173,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],in Garrick’s farce of ‘Lethe.’ On this occasion he read portions of
174,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"a ‘Tragedy,’ and talked of a journey to decipher the inscriptions on"
175,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"the Written Mountains.” In later days, when writing an “Essay on the"
176,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"advantages to be derived from sending a judicious traveller into Asia,”"
177,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],Goldsmith professed to feel the difficulty of choosing a proper person
178,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"for such an enterprise, and indicated the qualifications demanded:--“He"
179,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"should be a man of a philosophical turn, one apt to deduce consequences"
180,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],of general utility from particular occurrences--neither swollen with
181,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"pride, nor hardened by prejudice--neither wedded to one particular"
182,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"system, nor instructed only in one particular science--neither wholly a"
183,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"botanist, nor wholly an antiquarian; his mind should be tinctured with"
184,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse"
185,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"with men. He should be, in some measure, an enthusiast to the design;"
186,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination and an innate love of"
187,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"change; furnished with a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and"
188,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],a heart not easily terrified at danger.”
189,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
190,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"With the year 1757, the prospects of Goldsmith brightened, and the"
191,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],papers which filled the pockets of the rusty black coat began to
192,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"get abroad. He wrote several articles for the “Monthly Review,”"
193,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"translated the “Mémoires d’un Protestant,” and composed his “Enquiry"
194,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe.” The object of
195,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],the work was special. He had obtained the appointment of physician to
196,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"a factory on the coast of Coromandel, and was providing funds for the"
197,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],voyage. A considerable sum was needed. The Company’s warrant cost ten
198,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"pounds, and the passage and equipment required one hundred and thirty"
199,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],pounds in addition; but the emoluments were expected to be large. The
200,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],salary was one hundred pounds; the average returns of the general
201,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],practice amounted to a thousand; there was an opening for commercial
202,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"enterprise, and invested money brought twenty per cent. These were"
203,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"flattering inducements; but time deadened their charm, and he shrank"
204,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"from so distant a banishment, and beginning life again at the age of"
205,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],thirty-one. Eight years of anxiety and trial had done their work on his
206,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],face and temper. His picture of himself was most discouraging. He had
207,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“contracted a hesitating, disagreeable manner of speaking, and a visage"
208,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"that looked ill-nature itself.” Home news deepened his melancholy, for"
209,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],his mother was almost blind.
210,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
211,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"The “Enquiry” appeared, without the Author’s name, April, 1759--a"
212,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"small volume, price half-a-crown; and in the autumn of the same year,"
213,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"the commencement of a weekly paper, called “The Bee,” afforded him an"
214,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],opportunity of showing his skill as an Editor. His plan was to “rove
215,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"from flower to flower, with seeming inattention, but concealed choice,"
216,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"expatiate over all the beauties of the season, and make his industry"
217,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his amusement.” The “Bee” expired with its eighth number, but he"
218,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"was more successful in his next enterprise. To the “Public Ledger,”"
219,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of which the first number appeared January 12th, 1760, Goldsmith"
220,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"contributed one hundred and twenty-three letters, which were afterwards"
221,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],collected as the “Citizen of the World.”
222,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
223,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"The last day of May, 1761, was memorable in his life, as witnessing"
224,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],the commencement of his intimacy with Johnson. His miscellaneous
225,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"productions in 1762-4 included a “Life of Richard Nash, of Bath,” an"
226,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“Introduction to Natural History,” an “Abridgment of Plutarch,” a"
227,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“History of England,” and the “Traveller.” For the poem he received"
228,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"only twenty guineas, but the applause of its readers was loud and"
229,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"unanimous. “I was glad,” said Sir Joshua, “to hear Sir Charles Fox"
230,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],say it was one of the finest poems in the English language.” A fourth
231,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"edition was required within eight months, and the Author lived to see"
232,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"the ninth. In 1764, he wrote the “Captivity,” for which the sum of ten"
233,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],guineas was paid by Dodsley.
234,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
235,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Poetry kept him poor, and we still see him writing for bread in a"
236,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"garret, and expecting to be “dunned for a milk score.” However, he"
237,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],cleared and warmed the future with the hopefulness of his genial
238,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"nature, and comforted himself by the recollection that while Addison"
239,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"wrote the “Campaign” in a third storey, he had only got to the second."
240,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],Reckless improvidence multiplied his difficulties. “Those who knew
241,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"him,” he told a correspondent, “knew his principles to differ from"
242,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"those of the rest of mankind, and while none regarded the interest of"
243,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his friend more, none regarded his own less.”"
244,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
245,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Among his disappointments, at this period, are to be numbered an"
246,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"unsuccessful application for a Gresham Lectureship, and Garrick’s"
247,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],refusal of the “Good-Natured Man.” But Colman put the drama on the
248,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"stage, January 29th, 1768, and the Professorship of Ancient History"
249,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"in the Royal Academy was agreeably bestowed. His “Roman History,”"
250,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"published in 1769, was received with favour; and in the May of 1770,"
251,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],the “Deserted Village” appeared.
252,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
253,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"In that year, Gray travelled through a part of England and South Wales,"
254,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],and Mr. Norton Nichols was with him at Malvern when he received the
255,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"new poem, which he desired his friend to read to him. He listened with"
256,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"fixed attention, and soon exclaimed, “This man is a Poet.” In twelve"
257,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"days the poem was reprinted, and before the 5th of August the public"
258,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"admiration exhausted a fifth impression. His comedy, the “Mistakes of"
259,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"a Night” (represented March 15th, 1773), obtained a success, of its"
260,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"kind, not inferior. Johnson said that it answered the great end of a"
261,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],comedy--“making an audience merry.” For an impertinent letter in the
262,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“London Packet,” Goldsmith caned the editor; having found, was the"
263,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"remark of a friend, a new pleasure, for he believed that it was the"
264,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“first time he had beat,” though “he may have been beaten before.”"
265,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
266,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"I may add, that the Ballad of “Edwin and Angelina,” having been"
267,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"privately printed for the amusement of the Countess of Northumberland,"
268,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"was inserted in the “Vicar of Wakefield,” when that charming fiction"
269,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"first came out, March 27th, 1766, to delight the young by its"
270,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"adventures, and the old by its wisdom. For two years the manuscript had"
271,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"lain in the desk of the Publisher, until the fame of the “Traveller”"
272,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],encouraged him to send it to the press.
273,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
274,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],He was now engaged in the compilation of the “History of the Earth and
275,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Animated Nature,” for which he was to receive eight hundred guineas;"
276,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"and about this time, according to Percy, he wrote “the ‘Haunch of"
277,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Venison,’ ‘Retaliation,’ and some other little sportive sallies, which"
278,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"were not printed until after his death.” Mr. Peter Cunningham[1] has,"
279,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"for the first time, related the true story of “Retaliation,” in the"
280,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"original words of Garrick:--A party of friends, at the St. James’s"
281,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Coffee House, were diverting themselves with the peculiar oddities"
282,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of Goldsmith, who insisted upon trying his epigrammatic powers with"
283,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],Garrick. Each was to write the other’s epitaph. Garrick immediately
284,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],spoke the following lines:--
285,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
286,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"“Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness call’d Noll,"
287,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"Who wrote like an angel, and talk’d like poor Poll.”"
288,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
289,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"The company laughed, and Goldsmith grew serious; he went to work, and"
290,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"some weeks after produced “Retaliation,” which was not written in"
291,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"anger, but with the utmost good humour."
292,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
293,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],His path seemed now to be winding out of gloom into the full
294,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"sunlight,--but, of a sudden, there rose up in it the “Shadow feared"
295,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"of man.” He was busy with projects, and had prepared a “Prospectus of"
296,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Science,” when a complaint, from"
297,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"which he had previously suffered, returned with extreme severity. His"
298,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],unskilful treatment of the disorder was aggravated by the agitation of
299,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his mind, and he gradually sank, until Monday, April 4th, 1774, when"
300,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"death released him, in the forty-sixth year of his age. His remains"
301,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],were interred in the burial-ground of the Temple; Nollekens carved
302,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"his profile in marble, and Johnson wrote a Latin inscription for the"
303,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],"monument, which was erected in the south transept of Westminster"
304,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],Abbey. The epitaph is thus given in English:--
305,ENGRAVER & PRINTER],
306,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--
307,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"Poet, Naturalist, and Historian,"
308,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,who left scarcely any style of writing
309,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"untouched,"
310,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,and touched nothing that he did not adorn;
311,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"of all the passions,"
312,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"whether smiles were to be moved,"
313,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"or tears,"
314,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,a powerful yet gentle master;
315,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"in genius, sublime, lively, versatile;"
316,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"in style, elevated, clear, elegant--"
317,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"the love of companions,"
318,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"the fidelity of friends,"
319,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"and the veneration of readers,"
320,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,have by this monument honoured the memory.
321,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"He was born in Ireland,"
322,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"at a place called Pallas,"

328,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,
329,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"Goldsmith, in the judgment of a friendly, but severe observer, always"
330,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,seemed to do best that which he was doing. Does he write History? He
331,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"tells shortly, and with a pleasing simplicity of narrative, all that we"
332,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,want to know. Does he write Essays? He clothes familiar wisdom with an
333,OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH--,"easy and elegant diction, of which the real difficulty is only known"

587,"DEAR SIR,","DEAR SIR,"
588,"DEAR SIR,",
589,"DEAR SIR,",I am sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no new force
590,"DEAR SIR,",from the ceremonies of a dedication; and perhaps it demands an excuse
591,"DEAR SIR,","thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with"
592,"DEAR SIR,",your own. But as a part of this poem was formerly written to you from
593,"DEAR SIR,","Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inscribed to"
594,"DEAR SIR,","you. It will also throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader"
595,"DEAR SIR,","understands that it is addressed to a man who, despising fame and"
596,"DEAR SIR,","fortune, has retired early to happiness and obscurity with an income of"
597,"DEAR SIR,",forty pounds a year.
598,"DEAR SIR,",
599,"DEAR SIR,","I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice. You"
600,"DEAR SIR,","have entered upon a sacred office, where the harvest is great, and the"
601,"DEAR SIR,","labourers are but few; while you have left the field of ambition, where"
602,"DEAR SIR,","the labourers are many, and the harvest not worth carrying away. But"
603,"DEAR SIR,","of all kinds of ambition--what from the refinement of the times, from"
604,"DEAR SIR,","different systems of criticism, and from the divisions of party--that"
605,"DEAR SIR,",which pursues poetical fame is the wildest.
606,"DEAR SIR,",
607,"DEAR SIR,",Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations; but in
608,"DEAR SIR,","a country verging to the extremes of refinement, Painting and Music"
609,"DEAR SIR,",come in for a share. As these offer the feeble mind a less laborious
610,"DEAR SIR,","entertainment, they at first rival Poetry, and at length supplant her:"
611,"DEAR SIR,","they engross all that favour once shown to her; and, though but younger"
612,"DEAR SIR,","sisters, seize upon the elder’s birthright."
613,"DEAR SIR,",
614,"DEAR SIR,","Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is still in"
615,"DEAR SIR,",greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it.
616,"DEAR SIR,",What criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse and
617,"DEAR SIR,","pindaric odes, choruses, anapests, and iambics, alliterative care and"
618,"DEAR SIR,",happy negligence! Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it; and
619,"DEAR SIR,","as he is generally much in the wrong, so he has always much to say--for"
620,"DEAR SIR,",error is ever talkative.
621,"DEAR SIR,",
622,"DEAR SIR,",But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous; I mean party.
623,"DEAR SIR,",Party entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste. When the
624,"DEAR SIR,","mind is once infected with this disease, it can only find pleasure in"
625,"DEAR SIR,","what contributes to increase the distemper. Like the tiger, that seldom"
626,"DEAR SIR,","desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh,"
627,"DEAR SIR,","the reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes ever"
628,"DEAR SIR,",after the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation. Such readers
629,"DEAR SIR,","generally admire some half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold"
630,"DEAR SIR,","man, having lost the character of a wise one. Him they dignify with the"
631,"DEAR SIR,",name of poet: his tawdry lampoons are called satires; his turbulence is
632,"DEAR SIR,","said to be force, and his frenzy fire."
633,"DEAR SIR,",
634,"DEAR SIR,","What reception a poem may find, which has neither abuse, party, nor"
635,"DEAR SIR,","blank verse to support it, I cannot tell; nor am I solicitous to know."
636,"DEAR SIR,","My aims are right. Without espousing the cause of any party, I have"
637,"DEAR SIR,",attempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to show that
638,"DEAR SIR,",there may be equal happiness in states that are differently governed
639,"DEAR SIR,",from our own; that every state has a particular principle of happiness;
640,"DEAR SIR,",and that this principle in each may be carried to a mischievous excess.
641,"DEAR SIR,",There are few can judge better than yourself how far these positions
642,"DEAR SIR,",are illustrated in this poem.
643,"DEAR SIR,",
644,"DEAR SIR,","I am, dear Sir,"
645,"DEAR SIR,","Your most affectionate brother,"

793,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"These, here disporting, own the kindred soil,"

803,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Man seems the only growth that dwindles here!
804,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Contrasted faults through all his manners reign;
805,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Though poor, luxurious; though submissive, vain"
806,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Though grave, yet trifling; zealous, yet untrue--"
807,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And even in penance planning sins anew.
808,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"All evils here contaminate the mind,"
809,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,That opulence departed leaves behind;
810,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,For wealth was theirs--nor far remov’d the date
811,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"When commerce proudly flourish’d through the state,"
812,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"At her command the palace learn’d to rise,"
813,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Again the long-fall’n column sought the skies,"
814,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The canvas glow’d beyond even nature warm,"
815,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,The pregnant quarry teem’d with human form;
816,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Till, more unsteady than the southern gale,"
817,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Commerce on other shores display’d her sail,"
818,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"While nought remain’d of all that riches gave,"
819,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But towns unmann’d, and lords without a slave--"
820,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,"
821,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Its former strength was but plethoric ill.

825,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Yet, still the loss of wealth is here supplied"

827,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,From these the feeble heart and long-fall’n mind
828,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,An easy compensation seem to find.
829,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array’d,"
830,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade;
831,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Processions form’d for piety and love--
832,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,A mistress or a saint in every grove:
833,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,By sports like these are all their cares beguil’d;
834,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,The sports of children satisfy the child.
835,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Each nobler aim, repress’d by long control,"
836,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;"
837,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"While low delights, succeeding fast behind,"
838,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,In happier meanness occupy the mind.
839,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"As in those domes, where Cæsars once bore sway,"
840,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Defac’d by time and tottering in decay,"
841,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,"
842,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed;

851,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And force a churlish soil for scanty bread.
852,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"No product here the barren hills afford,"
853,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But man and steel, the soldier and his sword;"

858,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
859,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,"
860,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm."
861,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Though poor the peasant’s hut, his feasts though small,"
862,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,He sees his little lot the lot of all;
863,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Sees no contiguous palace rear its head,"
864,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,To shame the meanness of his humble shed--
865,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal,"
866,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,To make him loathe his vegetable meal--

869,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Cheerful at morn, he wakes from short repose,"
870,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes;"
871,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,With patient angle trolls the finny deep;
872,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Or drives his venturous ploughshare to the steep;
873,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,"
874,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And drags the struggling savage into day.
875,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"At night returning, every labour sped,"
876,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,He sits him down the monarch of a shed;
877,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys"
878,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"His children’s looks, that brighten at the blaze--"
879,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"While his lov’d partner, boastful of her hoard,"
880,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Displays her cleanly platter on the board:
881,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,"
882,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,With many a tale repays the nightly bed.
883,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
884,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,[Illustration]
885,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
886,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Thus every good his native wilds impart
887,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Imprints the patriot passion on his heart;
888,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And even those ills, that round his mansion rise,"
889,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies:
890,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,"
891,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms;
892,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,"
893,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast--
894,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,So the loud torrent and the whirlwind’s roar
895,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,But bind him to his native mountains more.

899,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Such are the charms to barren states assign’d--

901,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Yet let them only share the praises due,"
902,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;"
903,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,For every want that stimulates the breast
904,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Becomes a source of pleasure when redress’d.
905,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies,"
906,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"That first excites desire, and then supplies;"
907,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,"
908,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,To fill the languid pause with finer joy;
909,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame,"
910,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame:"
911,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Their level life is but a smouldering fire,"
912,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Unquench’d by want, unfann’d by strong desire;"
913,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer,"
914,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"On some high festival of once a year,"
915,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,"
916,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire."
917,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
918,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow--
919,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low;"
920,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"For, as refinement stops, from sire to son"
921,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Unalter’d, unimprov’d, the manners run--"
922,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And love’s and friendship’s finely pointed dart
923,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Fall blunted from each indurated heart.
924,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Some sterner virtues o’er the mountain’s breast
925,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"May sit, like falcons cowering on the nest;"
926,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But all the gentler morals, such as play"
927,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Through life’s more cultur’d walks, and charm the way--"
928,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"These, far dispers’d, on timorous pinions fly,"
929,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.
930,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
931,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,"
932,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,I turn; and France displays her bright domain.
933,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease,"
934,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Pleas’d with thyself, whom all the world can please--"
935,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"How often have I led thy sportive choir,"
936,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire,"
937,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Where shading elms along the margin grew,"
938,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And, freshen’d from the wave, the zephyr flew!"
939,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And haply, though my harsh touch, faltering still,"
940,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But mock’d all tune, and marr’d the dancers’ skill--"
941,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,"
942,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And dance, forgetful of the noontide hour."
943,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Alike all ages: dames of ancient days
944,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Have led their children through the mirthful maze;
945,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And the gay grandsire, skill’d in gestic lore,"
946,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Has frisk’d beneath the burden of threescore.
947,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
948,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,So bless’d a life these thoughtless realms display;
949,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Thus idly busy rolls their world away.
950,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,"
951,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,For honour forms the social temper here:
952,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Honour, that praise which real merit gains,"
953,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Or even imaginary worth obtains,"
954,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Here passes current--paid from hand to hand,"
955,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"It shifts, in splendid traffic, round the land;"
956,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"From courts to camps, to cottages it strays,"
957,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And all are taught an avarice of praise--
958,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"They please, are pleas’d, they give to get esteem,"
959,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Till, seeming bless’d, they grow to what they seem."
960,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
961,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But while this softer art their bliss supplies,"
962,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,It gives their follies also room to rise;
963,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"For praise too dearly lov’d, or warmly sought,"
964,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Enfeebles all internal strength of thought--
965,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And the weak soul, within itself unbless’d,"
966,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Leans for all pleasure on another’s breast.
967,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,"
968,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;
969,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,"
970,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace;
971,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,"
972,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,To boast one splendid banquet once a year:
973,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,"
974,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause.

984,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Onward, methinks, and diligently slow,"
985,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The firm connected bulwark seems to grow,"
986,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Spreads its long arms amidst the watery roar,"
987,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore--"
988,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"While the pent ocean, rising o’er the pile,"
989,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile;
990,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The slow canal, the yellow-blossom’d vale,"
991,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,"
992,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The crowded mart, the cultivated plain--"
993,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,A new creation rescued from his reign.
994,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
995,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil"
996,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Impels the native to repeated toil,"
997,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Industrious habits in each bosom reign,"
998,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And industry begets a love of gain.
999,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Hence all the good from opulence that springs,"
1000,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,"
1001,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Are here display’d. Their much-lov’d wealth imparts
1002,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;"
1003,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But view them closer, craft and fraud appear--"
1004,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Even liberty itself is barter’d here.
1005,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,At gold’s superior charms all freedom flies;
1006,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"The needy sell it, and the rich man buys:"
1007,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,"
1008,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Here wretches seek dishonourable graves;
1009,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And, calmly bent, to servitude conform,"
1010,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.
1011,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
1012,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old--
1013,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold,"
1014,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"War in each breast, and freedom on each brow;"
1015,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,How much unlike the sons of Britain now!
1016,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,
1017,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,"
1018,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And flies where Britain courts the western spring;

1020,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And brighter streams than fam’d Hydaspes glide.
1021,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"There, all around, the gentlest breezes stray;"
1022,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,There gentle music melts on every spray;
1023,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Creation’s mildest charms are there combin’d;
1024,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Extremes are only in the master’s mind.
1025,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Stern o’er each bosom reason holds her state,"
1026,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,With daring aims irregularly great.
1027,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,"
1028,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"I see the lords of human kind pass by,"
1029,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Intent on high designs--a thoughtful band,"

1031,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,"
1032,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"True to imagin’d right, above control;"
1033,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"While even the peasant boasts these rights to scan,"
1034,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And learns to venerate himself as man.

1036,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Thine, freedom, thine the blessings pictur’d here;"
1037,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;
1038,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Too bless’d indeed were such without alloy,"
1039,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"But, foster’d even by freedom, ills annoy."
1040,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,That independence Britons prize too high
1041,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie:"
1042,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,The self-dependent lordlings stand alone--
1043,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown.
1044,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Here, by the bonds of nature feebly held,"
1045,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Minds combat minds, repelling and repell’d;"
1046,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Ferments arise, imprison’d factions roar,"
1047,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Repress’d ambition struggles round her shore--

1075,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,I only would repress them to secure;
1076,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"For just experience tells, in every soil,"
1077,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,That those who think must govern those that toil--
1078,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,And all that freedom’s highest aims can reach
1079,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,Is but to lay proportion’d loads on each:
1080,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Hence, should one order disproportion’d grow,"

1088,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"Contracting regal power, to stretch their own--"
1089,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,When I behold a factious band agree

1185,TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.,
1186,"DEAR SIR,","DEAR SIR,"
1187,"DEAR SIR,",
1188,"DEAR SIR,","I can have no expectation, in an address of this kind, either to add"
1189,"DEAR SIR,",to your reputation or to establish my own. You can gain nothing from
1190,"DEAR SIR,","my admiration, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are said to"
1191,"DEAR SIR,","excel; and I may lose much by the severity of your judgment, as few"
1192,"DEAR SIR,",have a juster taste in poetry than you. Setting interest therefore
1193,"DEAR SIR,","aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at"
1194,"DEAR SIR,",present in following my affections. The only dedication I ever made was
1195,"DEAR SIR,","to my brother, because I loved him better than most other men. He is"
1196,"DEAR SIR,",since dead. Permit me to inscribe this poem to you.
1197,"DEAR SIR,",
1198,"DEAR SIR,",How far you may be pleased with the versification and mere mechanical
1199,"DEAR SIR,","parts of this attempt, I do not pretend to inquire: but I know you will"
1200,"DEAR SIR,",object--and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur in
1201,"DEAR SIR,","the opinion--that the depopulation it deplores is nowhere to be seen,"
1202,"DEAR SIR,",and the disorders it laments are only to be found in the poet’s own
1203,"DEAR SIR,","imagination. To this I can scarce make any other answer, than that I"
1204,"DEAR SIR,",sincerely believe what I have written; that I have taken all possible
1205,"DEAR SIR,","pains in my country excursions, for these four or five years past, to"
1206,"DEAR SIR,",be certain of what I allege; and that all my views and inquiries have
1207,"DEAR SIR,","led me to believe those miseries real, which I here attempt to display."
1208,"DEAR SIR,","But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the country"
1209,"DEAR SIR,","be depopulating or not; the discussion would take up much room, and I"
1210,"DEAR SIR,","should prove myself, at best, but an indifferent politician to tire the"
1211,"DEAR SIR,","reader with a long preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a"
1212,"DEAR SIR,",long poem.
1213,"DEAR SIR,",
1214,"DEAR SIR,","In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh against the"
1215,"DEAR SIR,",increase of our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern
1216,"DEAR SIR,","politicians against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it has"
1217,"DEAR SIR,",been the fashion to consider luxury as one of the greatest national
1218,"DEAR SIR,","advantages, and all the wisdom of antiquity, in that particular, as"
1219,"DEAR SIR,","erroneous. Still, however, I must remain a professed ancient on that"
1220,"DEAR SIR,","head, and continue to think those luxuries prejudicial to states, by"
1221,"DEAR SIR,","which so many vices are introduced, and so many kingdoms have been"
1222,"DEAR SIR,","undone. Indeed, so much has been poured out of late on the other side"
1223,"DEAR SIR,","of the question, that, merely for the sake of novelty and variety, one"
1224,"DEAR SIR,",would sometimes wish to be in the right.
1225,"DEAR SIR,",
1226,"DEAR SIR,","I am, dear Sir,"

1250,OLIVER GOLDSMITH.,"And all the village train, from labour free,"

2572,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;

2610,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,"
2611,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],And “nobody with me at sea but myself;”[11]
2612,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,"
2613,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,"

2615,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Though clogg’d with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife;"

2617,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.

2619,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"When come to the place where we all were to dine,"

2621,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb"
2622,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come;
2623,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“For I knew it,” he cried, “both eternally fail,"

2625,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"But no matter, I’ll warrant we’ll make up the party"

2628,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"They ’re both of them merry, and authors, like you;"
2629,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"The one writes the _Snarler_, the other the _Scourge_;"
2630,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],Some think he writes _Cinna_--he owns to _Panurge_.”
2631,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"While thus he describ’d them by trade and by name,"

2633,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],
2634,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen,"
2635,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"At the bottom was tripe, in a swinging tureen;"
2636,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot;
2637,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],In the middle a place where the pasty--was not.
2638,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Now, my lord, as for tripe, it’s my utter aversion,"
2639,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;
2640,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"So there I sat stuck like a horse in a pound,"
2641,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],While the bacon and liver went merrily round.
2642,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"But what vex’d me most was that d--d Scottish rogue,"
2643,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"With his long-winded speeches, his smiles, and his brogue;"
2644,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"And, “Madam,” quoth he, “may this bit be my poison,"
2645,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],A prettier dinner I never set eyes on:
2646,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Pray a slice of your liver, though may I be curst,"
2647,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],But I’ve eat of your tripe till I’m ready to burst.”
2648,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“The tripe,” quoth the Jew, “if the truth I may speak,"
2649,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],I could dine on this tripe seven days in a week;
2650,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],I like these here dinners so pretty and small--
2651,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"But your friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.”"
2652,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“Oh, oh!” quoth my friend, “he’ll come on in a trice--"
2653,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],He’s keeping a corner for something that’s nice.
2654,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],There’s a Pasty”--“A Pasty!” repeated the Jew;
2655,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],“I don’t care if I keep a corner for ’t too.”
2656,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“What the De’il, mon, a Pasty!” re-echoed the Scot;"
2657,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“Though splitting, I’ll still keep a corner for that.”"
2658,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“We’ll all keep a corner,” the lady cried out;"
2659,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"“We’ll all keep a corner,” was echo’d about."
2660,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"While thus we resolv’d, and the Pasty delay’d,"
2661,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"With looks that quite petrified, enter’d the maid;"
2662,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,"
2663,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],"Wak’d Priam, in drawing his curtains by night."
2664,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],But we quickly found out--for who could mistake her?--
2665,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],That she came with some terrible news from the baker:
2666,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],And so it fell out; for that negligent sloven
2667,AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.],Had shut out the Pasty on shutting his oven.
