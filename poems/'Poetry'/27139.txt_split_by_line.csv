387,KING NIMAERA.,King Nimaera on his throne sat

394,KING NIMAERA.,"They were counted by the thousands,"
395,KING NIMAERA.,By the hundreds and the thousands.
396,KING NIMAERA.,Sage-like was this King Nimaera;
397,KING NIMAERA.,Furrowed was his brow with seasons;
398,KING NIMAERA.,"Hoary were his locks and silvery,"
399,KING NIMAERA.,"Ran the sportive breezes through them,"
400,KING NIMAERA.,Tossed them up in endless frolic.
401,KING NIMAERA.,Mutely sat the aged monarch
402,KING NIMAERA.,"Mid the many lights and shadows,"
403,KING NIMAERA.,Mid the many scenes and changes
404,KING NIMAERA.,"Which for ever came around him,"
405,KING NIMAERA.,"Casting cursive glances on them,"
406,KING NIMAERA.,"Smiling now at some adroitness,"
407,KING NIMAERA.,Frowning then at deeds of folly;
408,KING NIMAERA.,"And a mystic manner had he,"

411,KING NIMAERA.,What he purposed for the future;
412,KING NIMAERA.,"Yet he loved this people fondly,"

414,KING NIMAERA.,"In their sorrow he beheld them,"
415,KING NIMAERA.,"And would comfort sometimes offer,"
416,KING NIMAERA.,"As, in joy and mirth elated,"
417,KING NIMAERA.,He would sometimes bring them sadness.
418,KING NIMAERA.,"These were dealings mystic to them,"
419,KING NIMAERA.,Yet they were for good intended.
420,KING NIMAERA.,"Springtime saw him calm and gentle,"
421,KING NIMAERA.,Sweet and pleasing in his manner;
422,KING NIMAERA.,"In the Summer he was joyful,"
423,KING NIMAERA.,Light and gay as some fair maiden
424,KING NIMAERA.,In the time she seeks a wooer.
425,KING NIMAERA.,"These were seasons of rejoicing,"
426,KING NIMAERA.,"And he called musicians forward,"
427,KING NIMAERA.,"Skilled in every art of music,"
428,KING NIMAERA.,"That the songs of night and morning,"
429,KING NIMAERA.,"And the blooming of the daytime,"
430,KING NIMAERA.,Came from every hill and valley;
431,KING NIMAERA.,Every wind and zephyr laden
432,KING NIMAERA.,With melodious floods of music.
433,KING NIMAERA.,"And in Autumn he came freely,"
434,KING NIMAERA.,"With a hand in bounty flowing,"
435,KING NIMAERA.,Filling all the stores and garners
436,KING NIMAERA.,"With rich heaps of fruit the choicest,"

440,KING NIMAERA.,"But in Winter he was gloomy,"
441,KING NIMAERA.,"Dark, and dismal, and uncheerful,"

450,KING NIMAERA.,Casting charms around profusely
451,KING NIMAERA.,"By the lanes, and woods, and waters,"
452,KING NIMAERA.,"And brought music, mirth, and gladness,"
453,KING NIMAERA.,"That the monarch heard the gay notes,"
454,KING NIMAERA.,"And removed his sombre garments,"
455,KING NIMAERA.,"And his frowns and dismal broodings,"

458,KING NIMAERA.,And his manner bright and cheerful.

460,KING NIMAERA.,Who held each a post of honor

469,KING NIMAERA.,"Who in pow'r set King Nimaera,"
470,KING NIMAERA.,And who watched for ever on it
471,KING NIMAERA.,"With an eye of keen discerning,"
472,KING NIMAERA.,To behold if Justice guarded
473,KING NIMAERA.,Every action of the rulers.
474,KING NIMAERA.,"Kalim was a prince the foremost,"
475,KING NIMAERA.,"Who brought people to the kingdom,"
476,KING NIMAERA.,"Made them of a wondrous matter,"
477,KING NIMAERA.,"Moulded, fashioned, and designed them,"
478,KING NIMAERA.,"Limbs and bodies full of senses,"

480,KING NIMAERA.,"Comely in their forms and graces,"
481,KING NIMAERA.,"Others wanting and imperfect,"
482,KING NIMAERA.,And repulsive in appearance.
483,KING NIMAERA.,"He conveyed them unto Weemus,"
484,KING NIMAERA.,"Left them in his care for training,"
485,KING NIMAERA.,"Heeding not how that was ordered,"
486,KING NIMAERA.,"But returned without delaying,"
487,KING NIMAERA.,"Backward to his own seclusion,"
488,KING NIMAERA.,Homeward to his mystic working;
489,KING NIMAERA.,"For his only thoughts resided,"
490,KING NIMAERA.,"And his only glory rested,"
491,KING NIMAERA.,"In the numbers he created,"
492,KING NIMAERA.,"In their beauty of formation,"
493,KING NIMAERA.,Which in secret depths he fashioned.
494,KING NIMAERA.,"Weemus was a prince the second,"
495,KING NIMAERA.,Great among the princely chieftains;
496,KING NIMAERA.,"He was keeper of the subjects,"
497,KING NIMAERA.,Took them from the hands of Kalim
498,KING NIMAERA.,"Young and tender as a blossom,"
499,KING NIMAERA.,"Fed the spirit in their bosom,"
500,KING NIMAERA.,"Cared and kept them out of danger,"
501,KING NIMAERA.,"Framed them unto firmer being,"
502,KING NIMAERA.,"Led them unto good or evil,"
503,KING NIMAERA.,"Led them on to pomp and glory,"
504,KING NIMAERA.,"Rising out of great achievements,"
505,KING NIMAERA.,"By these ways to wealth and grandeur,"
506,KING NIMAERA.,Scattered on their footpaths wisdom--
507,KING NIMAERA.,"Wisdom, knowledge, and discretion,"
508,KING NIMAERA.,"Evils, vices, lust, and anger,"
509,KING NIMAERA.,As a sower scatters corn-seed;
510,KING NIMAERA.,Let them gather as they listed
511,KING NIMAERA.,Of the good or of the evil.
512,KING NIMAERA.,"They had powers of true discernment,"
513,KING NIMAERA.,To direct them as they gathered
514,KING NIMAERA.,"Which were good and which were evil,"
515,KING NIMAERA.,"Written and engraved on records,"
516,KING NIMAERA.,Words of endless power and meaning;
517,KING NIMAERA.,"And a few the good selected,"
518,KING NIMAERA.,Gathered from a wise discretion;
519,KING NIMAERA.,"But the crowds were blind and heedless,"
520,KING NIMAERA.,"Minded not the laws and records,"
521,KING NIMAERA.,"Gathered freely of the evil,"
522,KING NIMAERA.,"Wandered on in lusts and vices,"
523,KING NIMAERA.,"Wandered on to spoil and plunder,"
524,KING NIMAERA.,"Wandered on to want and sorrow,"
525,KING NIMAERA.,"Misery, and pain, and anguish."
526,KING NIMAERA.,Strange his dealings were and hidden;
527,KING NIMAERA.,"Oft would take the greatest boaster,"
528,KING NIMAERA.,"Mighty in his own beholding,"
529,KING NIMAERA.,"Who in pomp and riches loitered,"
530,KING NIMAERA.,"In high seats of veneration,"
531,KING NIMAERA.,"And would draw him downward, downward,"
532,KING NIMAERA.,"Rob him of his pomp and splendor,"
533,KING NIMAERA.,"Of his riches and his glory,"
534,KING NIMAERA.,"Set him by the homeless beggar,"
535,KING NIMAERA.,"Holden in the pangs of hunger,"
536,KING NIMAERA.,Gladly feeding on the morsels
537,KING NIMAERA.,"Given by the poor and humble,"
538,KING NIMAERA.,Who were once by him despised.
539,KING NIMAERA.,"Lone, and destitute, and humbled,"
540,KING NIMAERA.,"Soon he learns his frail condition,"
541,KING NIMAERA.,And that he is only mortal.
542,KING NIMAERA.,"Or the unpretending stranger,"
543,KING NIMAERA.,"From a poor and humble dwelling,"
544,KING NIMAERA.,"And unknown among the people,"
545,KING NIMAERA.,Weemus oft would take and guide him
546,KING NIMAERA.,"High unto a seat of honor,"
547,KING NIMAERA.,"To reside in noble mansions,"
548,KING NIMAERA.,Fame and praise for ever by him.
549,KING NIMAERA.,"Thuswise Weemus often acted,"
550,KING NIMAERA.,"Fearless of rebuke or censure,"
551,KING NIMAERA.,"And accounted not his reasons,"
552,KING NIMAERA.,Dealing ever as he listed.
553,KING NIMAERA.,Sero was the third prince called;
554,KING NIMAERA.,"He was stern, and fierce, and warlike;"
555,KING NIMAERA.,Fear and terror walked before him
556,KING NIMAERA.,"In the sight of all the people,"
557,KING NIMAERA.,And his bearing was majestic;
558,KING NIMAERA.,"Quick and keen his glances darted,"
559,KING NIMAERA.,Like a strong man's arrow flying;
560,KING NIMAERA.,"And the people tried to shun him,"
561,KING NIMAERA.,To avoid the ways he haunted;
562,KING NIMAERA.,"And they trembled sadly, sorely,"
563,KING NIMAERA.,If he ever ventured near them.
564,KING NIMAERA.,Yet beneath his hardened manner
565,KING NIMAERA.,Dwelt a gentle spirit calmly;
566,KING NIMAERA.,"It was only to the wicked,"
567,KING NIMAERA.,"To the evil and the sinful,"
568,KING NIMAERA.,That his terror was revealed.
569,KING NIMAERA.,Sero from the hands of Weemus
570,KING NIMAERA.,"Took the people rudely, boldly,"
571,KING NIMAERA.,As directed by the spirit
572,KING NIMAERA.,Which for ever ruled his actions.
573,KING NIMAERA.,"Old, and young, and middle-aged,"
574,KING NIMAERA.,"Heedless of their years he took them,"
575,KING NIMAERA.,"Heedless of their power or greatness,"
576,KING NIMAERA.,"Heedless of their worth or beauty,"
577,KING NIMAERA.,Or of want or low attainments;
578,KING NIMAERA.,"Pious-minded, vain, and sinful,"
579,KING NIMAERA.,Fell alike to be removed.
580,KING NIMAERA.,There were some who longed his coming
581,KING NIMAERA.,"To relieve them of their burden,"
582,KING NIMAERA.,And admit them to the bright realms
583,KING NIMAERA.,"Which he watched, and kept, and guarded,"
584,KING NIMAERA.,"There to rest in peace and tranquil,"
585,KING NIMAERA.,"Sheltered from the wars and tumults,"
586,KING NIMAERA.,"From the storms, and fears, and terrors"
587,KING NIMAERA.,Which were ever raging freely
588,KING NIMAERA.,Throughout all the lands of Weemus.
589,KING NIMAERA.,They had seen in feeble vision--
590,KING NIMAERA.,"Seen a ray of future glory,"
591,KING NIMAERA.,Of the sweet and happy pleasures
592,KING NIMAERA.,In this kingdom Sero guarded;
593,KING NIMAERA.,"Longed and panted for admission,"
594,KING NIMAERA.,"Toiled and labored for a passport,"
595,KING NIMAERA.,Fought and battled for a title
596,KING NIMAERA.,"To this realm where trouble is not,"
597,KING NIMAERA.,"Till they had become the victors,"
598,KING NIMAERA.,And were waiting now to enter.
599,KING NIMAERA.,Throughout all Nimaera's kingdom
600,KING NIMAERA.,Warning heralds Sero sent out
601,KING NIMAERA.,"To implore the heedless people,"
602,KING NIMAERA.,Raising thus their warning voices:
603,KING NIMAERA.,"""Turn, ye people, turn from evil,"
604,KING NIMAERA.,Know ye that the day is nearing
605,KING NIMAERA.,For the long and weary journey
606,KING NIMAERA.,Through dark valleys and wild passes
607,KING NIMAERA.,To the lands of the hereafter.
608,KING NIMAERA.,"Be ye ready for departure,"
609,KING NIMAERA.,Robed and girded for the journey;
610,KING NIMAERA.,"For our guide, the princely Sero,"
611,KING NIMAERA.,Cometh; he is soon before you.
612,KING NIMAERA.,"If you are not waiting ready,"
613,KING NIMAERA.,"He will not delay the journey,"
614,KING NIMAERA.,"But will in the darkness leave you,"
615,KING NIMAERA.,"Which ye cannot wander out of,"
616,KING NIMAERA.,"From its terrors or its dangers,"
617,KING NIMAERA.,"Till it take you to destruction,"
618,KING NIMAERA.,"To an everlasting torment."""
619,KING NIMAERA.,"Thus the warning heralds wandered,"
620,KING NIMAERA.,"Oft complaining, oft imploring"
621,KING NIMAERA.,"Unto all the erring people,"
622,KING NIMAERA.,Unto all the slothful numbers;
623,KING NIMAERA.,"But they were so bound in pleasures,"
624,KING NIMAERA.,"Were in sin and lust so tangled,"
625,KING NIMAERA.,That they heeded not the warning--
626,KING NIMAERA.,The kind words of warning spoken;
627,KING NIMAERA.,"Which were lost and vainly wasted,"
628,KING NIMAERA.,"Were as mists upon a bulwark,"
629,KING NIMAERA.,"Bearing with them no impression,"
630,KING NIMAERA.,Save unto a sorry number--
631,KING NIMAERA.,"But a few who heard and listened,"
632,KING NIMAERA.,And returned from evil doing
633,KING NIMAERA.,Unto ways of truth and knowledge.
634,KING NIMAERA.,And of Sero let me tell you.
635,KING NIMAERA.,He was keeper of the passes
636,KING NIMAERA.,Leading to the land of Wisdom--
637,KING NIMAERA.,"Wisdom, clothed in radiant glory;"
638,KING NIMAERA.,And unto the lands of Darkness--
639,KING NIMAERA.,"Darkness, clothed in every horror."
640,KING NIMAERA.,"With bewailing he was girded,"
641,KING NIMAERA.,To that band a key suspended;
642,KING NIMAERA.,"He was girded with rejoicing,"
643,KING NIMAERA.,To that band a key suspended.
644,KING NIMAERA.,"These were keys wherewith he opened,"
645,KING NIMAERA.,"Opened he therewith the wickets,"
646,KING NIMAERA.,To allow the people entrance
647,KING NIMAERA.,As the passport they presented.
648,KING NIMAERA.,"Just between the wickets sat he,"
649,KING NIMAERA.,"Wide his dusky pinions spreading,"
650,KING NIMAERA.,One upon each entrance holding;
651,KING NIMAERA.,"And above him waved a banner,"
652,KING NIMAERA.,In its colors dull and dismal;
653,KING NIMAERA.,"Deep and solemn was the motto,"
654,KING NIMAERA.,Was the warning written on it;
655,KING NIMAERA.,Thus it was in bold description--
656,KING NIMAERA.,"""Woe is for the evildoer;"
657,KING NIMAERA.,"For the upright, joy and gladness."""
658,KING NIMAERA.,"And a voice beside him echoed,"
659,KING NIMAERA.,"In sonorous sounds and loudly,"
660,KING NIMAERA.,"Tones of gladness, tones of sadness,"
661,KING NIMAERA.,"""Hark ye, hark ye, all who wander,"
662,KING NIMAERA.,Woe is for the evildoer;
663,KING NIMAERA.,"For the upright, joy and gladness."""
664,KING NIMAERA.,"In his right hand Sero wielded,--"
665,KING NIMAERA.,"Brandished a terrific weapon,"
666,KING NIMAERA.,And it was a sword of terror;
667,KING NIMAERA.,"For the evil, but beholding,"
668,KING NIMAERA.,"Trembled as an aspen leaflet,"
669,KING NIMAERA.,Shuddered as the ruined shudder.
670,KING NIMAERA.,Wonder moved all the people
671,KING NIMAERA.,"While they listened to the sayings,"
672,KING NIMAERA.,To the wonders he unfolded
673,KING NIMAERA.,Of the regions which he guarded.
674,KING NIMAERA.,Thus he made his mystic sayings:
675,KING NIMAERA.,"""Through this wicket on my right hand"
676,KING NIMAERA.,"Is a vale of noble grandeur,"
677,KING NIMAERA.,"Placid and surpassing lovely,"
678,KING NIMAERA.,"Which the pilgrim, as he enters,"
679,KING NIMAERA.,Hails with overflowing gladness.
680,KING NIMAERA.,Seraphs from the holy regions--
681,KING NIMAERA.,"Oh, so sweet, and so inviting!--"
682,KING NIMAERA.,Meet him as he enters therein;
683,KING NIMAERA.,"Through the pleasant passes guide him,"
684,KING NIMAERA.,"By the banks of streamlets gliding,"
685,KING NIMAERA.,With a constant music laden;
686,KING NIMAERA.,"Mellow light-beams on them dancing,"
687,KING NIMAERA.,Waltzing to the streamlet's music;
688,KING NIMAERA.,Music soft and so melodious
689,KING NIMAERA.,Rising from the groves around them;
690,KING NIMAERA.,Groves of myrtle and of woodbine
691,KING NIMAERA.,"Full of odors rich and soothing,"
692,KING NIMAERA.,Rising from the flowery vials;
693,KING NIMAERA.,"Flowers which clothe the banks, adorning,"
694,KING NIMAERA.,Till the breezes hail their essence;
695,KING NIMAERA.,"Zephyrs soft, and fair, and gentle,"
696,KING NIMAERA.,"Take these balmy odors with them,"
697,KING NIMAERA.,Throughout all the holy regions.
698,KING NIMAERA.,"Thus he wanders onward, onward,"
699,KING NIMAERA.,"With his angel guides advancing,"
700,KING NIMAERA.,"Wrapt in wonder and adorement,"
701,KING NIMAERA.,"Raptured with the matchless beauty,"
702,KING NIMAERA.,"Till a softer music cometh,"
703,KING NIMAERA.,"Sweeter than the notes around him,"
704,KING NIMAERA.,On the distance flowing sweetly.
705,KING NIMAERA.,"Soon the strains come nearer, clearer,"
706,KING NIMAERA.,And he wonders why the music.
707,KING NIMAERA.,'Whence these songs of mirth and gladness?'
708,KING NIMAERA.,Asketh thus his angel escort.
709,KING NIMAERA.,'Where and whence these sounds melodious?
710,KING NIMAERA.,Whose are all these festive voices?
711,KING NIMAERA.,What the cause of such rejoicing?'
712,KING NIMAERA.,And the spirits answer thuswise:
713,KING NIMAERA.,'These are bands of angels singing
714,KING NIMAERA.,"In the happy land of Blessing,"
715,KING NIMAERA.,In the lofty halls of gladness.
716,KING NIMAERA.,Seraphs from their golden harps draw
717,KING NIMAERA.,Notes to swell the songs of gladness.
718,KING NIMAERA.,These are songs of glad rejoicings
719,KING NIMAERA.,"For another pilgrim nearing,--"
720,KING NIMAERA.,One escaped the land of bondage.
721,KING NIMAERA.,This the source of these rejoicings.'
722,KING NIMAERA.,"Ere this answer hath been spoken,"
723,KING NIMAERA.,Lo! before them rise the portals
724,KING NIMAERA.,Of the holy land of Blessing.
725,KING NIMAERA.,This the city he hath heard of
726,KING NIMAERA.,"In such sweet and wondrous stories,"
727,KING NIMAERA.,Whence he longed in patient waiting
728,KING NIMAERA.,"To arrive at, now before him."
729,KING NIMAERA.,How enraptured he beholdeth
730,KING NIMAERA.,"All its dazzling brightness spreading,"
731,KING NIMAERA.,As he nearer comes and nearer
732,KING NIMAERA.,"To the haven of his journey,"
733,KING NIMAERA.,Thousand times ten thousands grander
734,KING NIMAERA.,Than his brightest fancies thought of.
735,KING NIMAERA.,"Sparkling, bounding in its brightness,"
736,KING NIMAERA.,"Comes the soft and cheering fair light,"
737,KING NIMAERA.,"Rolling o'er the diamond bulwarks,"
738,KING NIMAERA.,"Flowing through the golden portals,"
739,KING NIMAERA.,Like ten thousand fairy sunbeams.
740,KING NIMAERA.,"All the bulwarks are of diamond,"
741,KING NIMAERA.,And of purest gold the portals;
742,KING NIMAERA.,Paved of brightest gems the courts are;
743,KING NIMAERA.,"Blended in a noble grandeur,"
744,KING NIMAERA.,"Sapphire blocks and blocks of ruby,"
745,KING NIMAERA.,"Emerald bars and bars of opal,"
746,KING NIMAERA.,"Rows of amethyst and topaz,"
747,KING NIMAERA.,Sparkling in their golden framework.
748,KING NIMAERA.,"Lofty are the walls and mighty,"
749,KING NIMAERA.,"Rising unto heights unmeasured,"
750,KING NIMAERA.,"Mighty, strong beyond conception."
751,KING NIMAERA.,Round the outer palisading
752,KING NIMAERA.,Of the diamond walls are watching
753,KING NIMAERA.,Many hosts from the Sabaoth
754,KING NIMAERA.,Of the King of all these bright realms.
755,KING NIMAERA.,"Sleepless are their eyes and piercing,"
756,KING NIMAERA.,Terrible they are in battle;
757,KING NIMAERA.,Nothing can uphold against them.
758,KING NIMAERA.,"They are clad in mail of pure white,"
759,KING NIMAERA.,Brilliant and of dazzling splendor;
760,KING NIMAERA.,"Helmets have they, white and burnished,"
761,KING NIMAERA.,Feathery white plumes in them waving;
762,KING NIMAERA.,"Brilliant also are their breastplates,"
763,KING NIMAERA.,"And their shields, with 'Love' engraven"
764,KING NIMAERA.,"On the front in golden letters,"
765,KING NIMAERA.,Are most gorgeous in beholding
766,KING NIMAERA.,When the light streams full upon them;
767,KING NIMAERA.,And destruction is the weapon
768,KING NIMAERA.,They employ to guard the city;
769,KING NIMAERA.,Awful is the havoc thereby
770,KING NIMAERA.,To the foe who dares approach them.
771,KING NIMAERA.,"Now before the golden gateway,"
772,KING NIMAERA.,"Which with massive bars is builded,"
773,KING NIMAERA.,Stands the pilgrim with his escort;
774,KING NIMAERA.,"And they sound a mighty trumpet,"
775,KING NIMAERA.,That the strains in thrilling grandeur
776,KING NIMAERA.,Flow sonorous through the kingdom.
777,KING NIMAERA.,"Then behold the keeper cometh,"
778,KING NIMAERA.,"Who the gateway ever keepeth,"
779,KING NIMAERA.,To unfold the golden barrings;
780,KING NIMAERA.,"And he throws the gate wide open,"
781,KING NIMAERA.,And the pilgrim enters therein
782,KING NIMAERA.,Now into the holy regions.
783,KING NIMAERA.,"There a band of seraphs meet him,"
784,KING NIMAERA.,"Chosen from the ranks around them,"
785,KING NIMAERA.,"Guide him to the shining white throne,"
786,KING NIMAERA.,Where the King in glory sitteth.
787,KING NIMAERA.,"And the holy King says, 'Welcome,"
788,KING NIMAERA.,"Welcome to you, pilgrim, brother!'"
789,KING NIMAERA.,And he bids an angel bring him--
790,KING NIMAERA.,"Bring him royal robes and robe him,"
791,KING NIMAERA.,"Garments rich, and white, and lovely,"
792,KING NIMAERA.,And a golden crown to crown him.
793,KING NIMAERA.,"While the empyrean minstrels rising,"
794,KING NIMAERA.,"All in flowing garments vested,"
795,KING NIMAERA.,"Some with harps and some with timbrels,"
796,KING NIMAERA.,"Some with lutes and some with trumpets,"
797,KING NIMAERA.,"All in goodly order mingled,"
798,KING NIMAERA.,In the skill of gay perfection;
799,KING NIMAERA.,Far the minstrel band extendeth
800,KING NIMAERA.,Like a wilderness of grandeur.
801,KING NIMAERA.,As a sea of flowing white waves
802,KING NIMAERA.,Mingled up with diamond ripples;
803,KING NIMAERA.,"As the moon on sparkling waters,"
804,KING NIMAERA.,"Comes the light from glowing beacons,"
805,KING NIMAERA.,"Dancing on their crowns of glory,"
806,KING NIMAERA.,"Far and near redounding, flowing"
807,KING NIMAERA.,"In a thousand dazzling colors,"
808,KING NIMAERA.,Like unto a flood of crystal.
809,KING NIMAERA.,Silent are they all and heedful
810,KING NIMAERA.,"While the leader on his tower stands,"
811,KING NIMAERA.,"High amid the radiant brightness,"
812,KING NIMAERA.,Till his silver wand is raised;
813,KING NIMAERA.,"Then for music every trumpet,"
814,KING NIMAERA.,"Every lute, and every timbrel,"
815,KING NIMAERA.,"Every harp is strung and ready,"
816,KING NIMAERA.,And for songs wait all the voices.
817,KING NIMAERA.,"Lo! it falls, and floods melodious"
818,KING NIMAERA.,"Flow from every voice united,"
819,KING NIMAERA.,"Rise from every lute and timbrel,"
820,KING NIMAERA.,Stream from every harp and trumpet.
821,KING NIMAERA.,"Noble and majestic cadence,"
822,KING NIMAERA.,Full of might and full of sweetness;
823,KING NIMAERA.,"Like tremendous thunders rolling,"
824,KING NIMAERA.,Rumbling in their strength and grandeur;
825,KING NIMAERA.,"Sweet as nectar, which is poured"
826,KING NIMAERA.,From the cup which Juno holdeth.
827,KING NIMAERA.,"Far and near the echoes answer,"
828,KING NIMAERA.,"From the vaults and arches flying,"
829,KING NIMAERA.,In the distant spaces rising
830,KING NIMAERA.,"Over thrones, and crowns, and mansions,"
831,KING NIMAERA.,Breaking o'er the vitreous white throne;
832,KING NIMAERA.,"Like a music-meteor falling,"
833,KING NIMAERA.,"Casting down its charms around it,"
834,KING NIMAERA.,"Ever softest, sweetest, fairest;"
835,KING NIMAERA.,"Softly as the summer showereth,"
836,KING NIMAERA.,"From its fragrant bosom, largely,"
837,KING NIMAERA.,Dews upon the sleeping meadow.
838,KING NIMAERA.,"This is honor to the pilgrim,"
839,KING NIMAERA.,Welcome to his seat of glory;
840,KING NIMAERA.,Songs of joy that he is landed
841,KING NIMAERA.,From the perils of the journey
842,KING NIMAERA.,To be one for ever with them.
843,KING NIMAERA.,"Now beside the throne he standeth,"
844,KING NIMAERA.,In his bosom gladness flowing.
845,KING NIMAERA.,He hath now been crowned and vested;
846,KING NIMAERA.,"And the King, arising, speaketh:"
847,KING NIMAERA.,"'Guide him to his seat of glory,"
848,KING NIMAERA.,To the mansion he hath gained.'
849,KING NIMAERA.,"Then, as magic fell amid them,"
850,KING NIMAERA.,"Every voice is mute and silent,"
851,KING NIMAERA.,"Every sound subdued resideth,"
852,KING NIMAERA.,Every strain on faltering pinion
853,KING NIMAERA.,From its gaysome course alighteth;
854,KING NIMAERA.,"Still and peaceful is the white throng,"
855,KING NIMAERA.,"Calmness, as in death, prevaileth."
856,KING NIMAERA.,"Now he sits enthroned amid them,"
857,KING NIMAERA.,"And again the strains are wakened,"
858,KING NIMAERA.,Mighty as to storms of thunder
859,KING NIMAERA.,"Born as from the womb of calmness,"
860,KING NIMAERA.,Rising as from death released.
861,KING NIMAERA.,Now his voice is with them mingled
862,KING NIMAERA.,"In the songs, and hymns, and anthems,"
863,KING NIMAERA.,Which shall evermore continue
864,KING NIMAERA.,"Throughout all this land of Blisses,"
865,KING NIMAERA.,"Where is love the only bondage,"
866,KING NIMAERA.,"Love the mighty power which holds them."""
867,KING NIMAERA.,"Thuswise speaketh Sero, telling"
868,KING NIMAERA.,Of the land whereto the wicket
869,KING NIMAERA.,On his right hand gives admission.
870,KING NIMAERA.,But far different is the story
871,KING NIMAERA.,"Which he giveth of the regions,"
872,KING NIMAERA.,Whence the wicket on his left hand
873,KING NIMAERA.,To the wanderer gives admission.
874,KING NIMAERA.,Spoken thus his vivid brief is:
875,KING NIMAERA.,"""He, who by this wicket enters,"
876,KING NIMAERA.,"Loseth hope and loseth courage,"
877,KING NIMAERA.,"Meeteth gloomy fears and terrors,"
878,KING NIMAERA.,Misery and anguish rising
879,KING NIMAERA.,In their wildest forms about him;
880,KING NIMAERA.,And upon the distance looming
881,KING NIMAERA.,"Awful terrors, monsters hideous,"
882,KING NIMAERA.,Scenes and shadows dark and dreary.
883,KING NIMAERA.,"Now the stifled groan of murder,--"
884,KING NIMAERA.,"Now the seething moan of anguish,--"
885,KING NIMAERA.,"Now bewailings in bereavement,"
886,KING NIMAERA.,"And lamentings of the ruined,"
887,KING NIMAERA.,"Loud, and painful, and laborious,"
888,KING NIMAERA.,"In an awful concert mingled,"
889,KING NIMAERA.,"Flow upon his ear bewildered,"
890,KING NIMAERA.,As in toil he wanders weary
891,KING NIMAERA.,"In the crowd, yet lost and lonely,"
892,KING NIMAERA.,"To the dreaded pit of terrors,"
893,KING NIMAERA.,"And its dismal dens and dungeons,"
894,KING NIMAERA.,"Damp, and stifled, and obnoxious,"
895,KING NIMAERA.,Burning with eternal anger
896,KING NIMAERA.,And with lurid flames of vengeance.
897,KING NIMAERA.,"Lo! aghast, he starts in terror,"
898,KING NIMAERA.,"And anon doth sink in anguish,"
899,KING NIMAERA.,"Weeping for the talents wasted,"
900,KING NIMAERA.,And the warnings he despised;
901,KING NIMAERA.,And for hope he looks and longeth
902,KING NIMAERA.,"In a deep and fervent longing,"
903,KING NIMAERA.,But it is a vain desire;
904,KING NIMAERA.,Nothing but an awful doom sits
905,KING NIMAERA.,Frowning on his pains and terrors.
906,KING NIMAERA.,"Onward, on he fast is driven,"
907,KING NIMAERA.,Through a rugged path and perilous;
908,KING NIMAERA.,"Rising on the hills above him,"
909,KING NIMAERA.,"Roaring thunders roll and rumble,"
910,KING NIMAERA.,With a mighty noise and terror;
911,KING NIMAERA.,All things at their greatness tremble.
912,KING NIMAERA.,"Sheets of flame, in livid fierceness,"
913,KING NIMAERA.,Sweep and fly in wildest swiftness;
914,KING NIMAERA.,"O'er the rugged heights ascending,"
915,KING NIMAERA.,"Cast their lurid glares upon them,"
916,KING NIMAERA.,In their course revealing further
917,KING NIMAERA.,Of the dangers hid in darkness.
918,KING NIMAERA.,"And beneath him gulphs are yawning,"
919,KING NIMAERA.,"Greedy to devour, are gaping;"
920,KING NIMAERA.,"Torrents deep within them roaring,"
921,KING NIMAERA.,Lashing up their foamy billows;
922,KING NIMAERA.,With the laving of their forces
923,KING NIMAERA.,All the pathway shakes and trembles.
924,KING NIMAERA.,"Brutes, in hungry anger raving,"
925,KING NIMAERA.,"Prowl from dens, and caves, and caverns,"
926,KING NIMAERA.,"Mingle with the ghosts and spectres,"
927,KING NIMAERA.,Lusting for a bloody surfeit.
928,KING NIMAERA.,"Reptiles, subtle and obnoxious,"
929,KING NIMAERA.,"Crawl, and welter, and recoil them"
930,KING NIMAERA.,"On the path in slimy matters,"
931,KING NIMAERA.,"Reeking with a poisoned odor,"
932,KING NIMAERA.,Darting poisons to molest him.
933,KING NIMAERA.,"Arrows from the towers are flying,"
934,KING NIMAERA.,"Shafts of flame and showers of fire,"
935,KING NIMAERA.,"Sweeping on through clouds and vapors,"
936,KING NIMAERA.,Like unto a storm of hailstones
937,KING NIMAERA.,Driven by a mighty tempest.
938,KING NIMAERA.,"Sadder and more bitter feelings,"
939,KING NIMAERA.,"Deeper, darker fears betake him,"
940,KING NIMAERA.,"As, above the groans around him,"
941,KING NIMAERA.,"Coming from the pit of terrors,"
942,KING NIMAERA.,"Bitter wailings, mournful cryings,"
943,KING NIMAERA.,Rise and fill the air with anguish.
944,KING NIMAERA.,"Now in view the dingy walls stand,"
945,KING NIMAERA.,"In their black and dismal bearing,"
946,KING NIMAERA.,Of the gloomy pit of terrors;
947,KING NIMAERA.,"Gloomy, like a loathsome dungeon."
948,KING NIMAERA.,"Now before the gate he standeth,"
949,KING NIMAERA.,"Worn, and weary, and dejected;"
950,KING NIMAERA.,And the lurid glares break through it
951,KING NIMAERA.,Of the flames for ever burning;
952,KING NIMAERA.,"And he sees the shames, the tortures,"
953,KING NIMAERA.,"And the writhing objects in them,"
954,KING NIMAERA.,Suffering and enduring anguish.
955,KING NIMAERA.,"They who once on bounty feasted,"
956,KING NIMAERA.,Now enclosed in pangs of hunger;
957,KING NIMAERA.,"They who were the poor's oppressors,"
958,KING NIMAERA.,Now oppressed and trodden under.
959,KING NIMAERA.,"Now destroyers are destroyed,"
960,KING NIMAERA.,"Scoffers are with scoff betaken,"
961,KING NIMAERA.,And the lofty are made humble;
962,KING NIMAERA.,And he shudders to behold them.
963,KING NIMAERA.,"Then an awful oath is spoken,"
964,KING NIMAERA.,Bidding to unbar the passage;
965,KING NIMAERA.,And the burdened words are answered
966,KING NIMAERA.,With another oath as fearful
967,KING NIMAERA.,From the fierce and sullen keeper;
968,KING NIMAERA.,And the creaking bars fly backward
969,KING NIMAERA.,With a mighty clash of vengeance.
970,KING NIMAERA.,"Then the brazen gate is opened,"
971,KING NIMAERA.,And the poor deluded victim
972,KING NIMAERA.,"Thrust into the pit of horrors,"
973,KING NIMAERA.,All amid the foulsome vapors.
974,KING NIMAERA.,"Flies the postern close behind him,"
975,KING NIMAERA.,"Back the bolts and bars are driven,"
976,KING NIMAERA.,Creaking with their heavy burden;
977,KING NIMAERA.,"And a motley throng surround him,"
978,KING NIMAERA.,"Railing, scoffing, and abusing;"
979,KING NIMAERA.,Each devising of some evil
980,KING NIMAERA.,"To annoy, or taunt, or torture."
981,KING NIMAERA.,"Vengeance burneth black within him,"
982,KING NIMAERA.,And infernal wars are raging
983,KING NIMAERA.,"In him and in all the dwellers,"
984,KING NIMAERA.,"One and one against another,"
985,KING NIMAERA.,Who are doomed through time eternal
986,KING NIMAERA.,To this awful pit of terrors;
987,KING NIMAERA.,"Where the evil spirits harbour,"
988,KING NIMAERA.,"Keep, and count their spoil and plunder,"
989,KING NIMAERA.,"Gathered from among the people,"
990,KING NIMAERA.,"Brought from many ruined cities,"
991,KING NIMAERA.,"Gained in many depredations,"
992,KING NIMAERA.,"By the hand of havoc aided."""
993,KING NIMAERA.,These are stories Sero telleth
994,KING NIMAERA.,"Of the happy land of Blisses,"
995,KING NIMAERA.,"Of the dreaded pit of terrors,"
996,KING NIMAERA.,"To the people of the kingdom,"
997,KING NIMAERA.,If perchance he may allure them
998,KING NIMAERA.,By the wonders he revealeth
999,KING NIMAERA.,"Of the blisses of the former,"
1000,KING NIMAERA.,Of the terrors of the latter.
1001,KING NIMAERA.,But through all Nimaera's kingdom
1002,KING NIMAERA.,"Went a band of evil spirits,"
1003,KING NIMAERA.,"Tribunes of the Prince of Darkness,"
1004,KING NIMAERA.,Went to aid his evil purpose;
1005,KING NIMAERA.,"Pried and scouted every corner,"
1006,KING NIMAERA.,"Entered into all the dwellings,"
1007,KING NIMAERA.,"Came to tempt and to misguide them,"
1008,KING NIMAERA.,"Came to tempt Nimaera's people,"
1009,KING NIMAERA.,"Lead them on to lust and evil,"
1010,KING NIMAERA.,"Taught them how to rob and plunder,"
1011,KING NIMAERA.,"Taught them how to kill and murder,"
1012,KING NIMAERA.,"Put corruption in their wishes,"
1013,KING NIMAERA.,"Poisoned all their thoughts and reasons,"
1014,KING NIMAERA.,"Mingled madness in their pleasures,"
1015,KING NIMAERA.,"Blinded them with show and grandeur,"
1016,KING NIMAERA.,"Gave them longings and ambitions,"
1017,KING NIMAERA.,"That they lost their true discernment,"
1018,KING NIMAERA.,As a man with wines confused
1019,KING NIMAERA.,Loses proper sense and caution.
1020,KING NIMAERA.,"And they gave such sumptuous meetings,"
1021,KING NIMAERA.,And they said such wondrous fair things--
1022,KING NIMAERA.,"Things that ne'er before were heard of,"
1023,KING NIMAERA.,That the dazzled people followed;
1024,KING NIMAERA.,"And they reaped a mighty harvest,"
1025,KING NIMAERA.,"Leading, drawing as they listed;"
1026,KING NIMAERA.,"For this was a simple people,"
1027,KING NIMAERA.,"Credulous, and blind, and simple."
1028,KING NIMAERA.,"Now the Maker of the kingdom,"
1029,KING NIMAERA.,"From his pure and dazzling white throne,"
1030,KING NIMAERA.,Looked and saw the dreadful havoc
1031,KING NIMAERA.,"Raging mid Nimaera's people,"
1032,KING NIMAERA.,And it vexed him very sorely;
1033,KING NIMAERA.,For he loved the people fondly
1034,KING NIMAERA.,Who were wisely formed by Kalim:
1035,KING NIMAERA.,"Bones, with matter moulded on them,"
1036,KING NIMAERA.,"Fraught with channels, watercourses,"
1037,KING NIMAERA.,"And red rivers running through them,"
1038,KING NIMAERA.,"From a mystic fountain rising,"
1039,KING NIMAERA.,"Flowing ever fast and constant,"
1040,KING NIMAERA.,Giving and diffusing vigor
1041,KING NIMAERA.,Through the many wondrous members.
1042,KING NIMAERA.,Counsel took He to restore them
1043,KING NIMAERA.,"From destruction's ruthless havoc,"
1044,KING NIMAERA.,In an earnest consultation
1045,KING NIMAERA.,"Saying ever and repeating,"
1046,KING NIMAERA.,"""We must save this ruined people;"
1047,KING NIMAERA.,We must give them light and caution:
1048,KING NIMAERA.,"Light, to shew their wayward goings;"
1049,KING NIMAERA.,"Caution, to direct them rightly."""
1050,KING NIMAERA.,"So a band of spirits went out,"
1051,KING NIMAERA.,"Builded with a holy ardour,"
1052,KING NIMAERA.,Sped athrough the heights and spaces
1053,KING NIMAERA.,"To Nimaera's kingdom, saying:"
1054,KING NIMAERA.,"""We will reason with this people;"
1055,KING NIMAERA.,"Reason boldly, turn and change them,"
1056,KING NIMAERA.,"Warn them of the evil spirits,"
1057,KING NIMAERA.,"Shew them thrones, and crowns, and mansions,"
1058,KING NIMAERA.,"As a trophy of repentance,"
1059,KING NIMAERA.,"Till they cannot fail but hear us,"
1060,KING NIMAERA.,"Till they turn in great rejoicing."""
1061,KING NIMAERA.,"Thus the spirits went and wandered,"
1062,KING NIMAERA.,"Talked and reasoned with the people,"
1063,KING NIMAERA.,"Shewing thrones, and crowns, and mansions,"
1064,KING NIMAERA.,Using every power and effort
1065,KING NIMAERA.,"To persuade them of the folly,"
1066,KING NIMAERA.,Of the dangers they were choosing.
1067,KING NIMAERA.,They who heard the deep entreaties
1068,KING NIMAERA.,For a minute turned to listen;
1069,KING NIMAERA.,Felt the powers within them moving
1070,KING NIMAERA.,Striving to believe and follow.
1071,KING NIMAERA.,"But, a little season longer,"
1072,KING NIMAERA.,"When the spirits passed from them,"
1073,KING NIMAERA.,"They returned unto the rapids,"
1074,KING NIMAERA.,To the mighty stream of ruin
1075,KING NIMAERA.,Rolling onward to destruction;
1076,KING NIMAERA.,For they were so much enamoured
1077,KING NIMAERA.,By the cunning fascinations
1078,KING NIMAERA.,Which the evil spirits gave them
1079,KING NIMAERA.,"That they lacked strength and courage,"
1080,KING NIMAERA.,"And they failed to turn and follow,"
1081,KING NIMAERA.,"Save a very little number,"
1082,KING NIMAERA.,"Who restrained their lusts and wishes,"
1083,KING NIMAERA.,And gave heed unto the sayings
1084,KING NIMAERA.,"Which the kindly spirits bore them,"
1085,KING NIMAERA.,"Gaining power, the more they harken'd,"
1086,KING NIMAERA.,"To withstand the evil spirits,"
1087,KING NIMAERA.,And to baffle their endeavours.
1088,KING NIMAERA.,These went to the land of Blisses;
1089,KING NIMAERA.,But for one who Sero passed
1090,KING NIMAERA.,"Through the wicket on his right hand,"
1091,KING NIMAERA.,"Going to the holy regions,"
1092,KING NIMAERA.,"Seven passed on his left hand,"
1093,KING NIMAERA.,Going to the pit of terrors.
1094,KING NIMAERA.,"Now that I have told you fairly,"
1095,KING NIMAERA.,Shewing as is due to render
1096,KING NIMAERA.,Of the powers of King Nimaera
1097,KING NIMAERA.,"And his three most favored princes,"
1098,KING NIMAERA.,Giving Sero's own description
1099,KING NIMAERA.,Of the wonders of the regions
1100,KING NIMAERA.,Which lie hid within the wickets
1101,KING NIMAERA.,"Which he ever proudly guardeth,"
1102,KING NIMAERA.,"Will you listen when I tell you,--"
1103,KING NIMAERA.,Will you hearken to the stories
1104,KING NIMAERA.,"I can give you of Nimaera,"
1105,KING NIMAERA.,"And his three most powerful princes,"
1106,KING NIMAERA.,And their dealings with the people?
1107,KING NIMAERA.,I shall do my best to render
1108,KING NIMAERA.,Stories such as will entice you;
1109,KING NIMAERA.,"Though my voice is low and feeble,"
1110,KING NIMAERA.,"Though my pen is slow and wayward,"
1111,KING NIMAERA.,"Never moving fair and fluent,"
1112,KING NIMAERA.,As the spirit which directs it
1113,KING NIMAERA.,Would that it should move and tell you.
1114,KING NIMAERA.,"They shall but be little stories,"
1115,KING NIMAERA.,Gathered from the many records
1116,KING NIMAERA.,Which the people kept and courted
1117,KING NIMAERA.,"In their halls, and towns, and cities."
1118,KING NIMAERA.,
1119,KING NIMAERA.,
1120,I.,I.
1121,I.,
1122,I.,
1123,I.,"Sailing o'er the sparkling waters,"
1124,I.,"With accordant breezes favoured,"
1125,I.,"Came a vessel homeward bearing,"
1126,I.,And a gladsome people on it.
1127,I.,"Sang they songs, and danced, and sported;"
1128,I.,Sadness was unknown amid them;
1129,I.,"Old, and young, and middle-aged"
1130,I.,"Were they, and of divers stations."
1131,I.,"While their pleasures were the fullest,"
1132,I.,"Sero saw their joys and pondered,--"
1133,I.,Pondered with his inward spirit:
1134,I.,"""Lo! they have an idle fancy,"
1135,I.,"All their thoughts are gay and heedless,"
1136,I.,"And they dream not of destruction,"
1137,I.,"Think not of a danger nearing,"
1138,I.,Nor will hearken to the warnings
1139,I.,Which are ever spoken to them.
1140,I.,Ere another morn has wakened
1141,I.,Shall their joys be turned to mourning.
1142,I.,"I will send, and turn, and change them."""
1143,I.,"Said he to retainers by him,"
1144,I.,"""Seest thou that fair-like vessel,"
1145,I.,And the mirthful crew upon it?
1146,I.,"Go, and captive make the number,"
1147,I.,And their spirits hither bring me;
1148,I.,But their bodies can be portioned
1149,I.,To the monsters of the ocean.
1150,I.,Neptune I shall call and waken;
1151,I.,"He will lend me storms and tempests,"
1152,I.,"Lightnings and mighty thunders,"
1153,I.,"Which shall in the mission aid thee,"
1154,I.,Give an awful grandeur to it;
1155,I.,"Like the flowing of great banners,"
1156,I.,"And as many torches blazing,"
1157,I.,"And the sounds of drums and trumpets,"
1158,I.,"Shall be storms, and flames, and thunder."""
1159,I.,So the mission goeth forthwith
1160,I.,O'er the still and tranquil waters;
1161,I.,"And they waken slumbering Neptune,"
1162,I.,Who advanceth storms and tempests;
1163,I.,"And the waves rise up in anger,"
1164,I.,Foam and hiss in reckless fury;
1165,I.,Thunders bellow martial music;
1166,I.,Lightnings flash their vivid torchlight.
1167,I.,Grand and mighty the procession!
1168,I.,"Neptune, in majestic pomp, came"
1169,I.,"In his chariot, attended"
1170,I.,"By a myriad mystic beings,"
1171,I.,"To direct the storms and thunders,"
1172,I.,And to rule the foaming billows.
1173,I.,Spake he thus unto the waters:
1174,I.,"""Ope your gates, ye billows, open,"
1175,I.,That great Sero's host may enter
1176,I.,"With the booty they have taken,"
1177,I.,"And the bodies of their captives,"
1178,I.,"Which shall in my caverns slumber,"
1179,I.,"In my rocky halls and grottos."""
1180,I.,Then the mighty gates were opened;
1181,I.,"And they all went downward, down,"
1182,I.,"Down into the dark, cold waters,"
1183,I.,"With their cries and earnest prayers,"
1184,I.,Wailings bitter and lamentings.
1185,I.,Woeful was the scene to witness:
1186,I.,"Children clinging to their mothers,"
1187,I.,"Husbands in their wives' embraces,"
1188,I.,"Brothers by their sisters holding,"
1189,I.,"Others running wild and madly,"
1190,I.,Crying to their gods for succour;
1191,I.,Every heart in very terror
1192,I.,Quailing at the rising future.
1193,I.,But these cries cannot be answered;
1194,I.,They have sought too late for succour;
1195,I.,"For the gates are closed upon them,"
1196,I.,"And the victors have their spirits,"
1197,I.,"Bearing to their princely Sero,"
1198,I.,And their bodies are consigned
1199,I.,To the halls of mighty Neptune.
1200,I.,Then did Sero take the spirits
1201,I.,As the mission brought them to him;
1202,I.,And for every one which entered
1203,I.,"By the wicket on his right hand,"
1204,I.,"Leading to the land of gladness,"
1205,I.,"Seven by the other entered,"
1206,I.,Down into the pit of terrors.
1207,I.,
1208,I.,
1209,II.,II.
1210,II.,
1211,II.,
1212,II.,Stood a fair and stately dwelling
1213,II.,"In the concourse of the people,"
1214,II.,Of the lofty of the people;
1215,II.,Looked it on the smaller buildings
1216,II.,Downward in a scornful manner;
1217,II.,"Proud was it of fine appearance,"
1218,II.,Proud the people who dwelt in it.
1219,II.,There the arts of every nation
1220,II.,Met with the united purpose
1221,II.,To adorn and to give splendor
1222,II.,"To the chambers of this mansion,"
1223,II.,To its corridors and landings.
1224,II.,Ottomans of downy velvet
1225,II.,"In the looms of Utrecht woven,"
1226,II.,"Vases of Chinese production,"
1227,II.,"Crystals, bright and burnished figures,"
1228,II.,"Models made of gold and silver,"
1229,II.,"Tapestry, and lace, and network,"
1230,II.,"Carpets from the looms of Brussels,"
1231,II.,Woven into gaudy figures.
1232,II.,"In a certain gorgeous chamber,"
1233,II.,"In apparel likewise gorgeous,"
1234,II.,"Sat a mighty, pompous woman."
1235,II.,Very high were her ideas
1236,II.,"Of her own expanded person,"
1237,II.,And her own unmeasured value;
1238,II.,"All the world would not contain them,"
1239,II.,They were so elate and soaring.
1240,II.,"Luxury and ease were round her,"
1241,II.,As she fancied to receive them;
1242,II.,And a host of powdered servants
1243,II.,Waited idly for her orders.
1244,II.,"Now she calls for an attendant,"
1245,II.,And doth give him orders thuswise:
1246,II.,"""'Not at home' shall be the answer"
1247,II.,"Unto all who this day seek me,"
1248,II.,Save unto his highness Fashion;
1249,II.,"Ye shall give to him admission."""
1250,II.,"State obeisance marks his exit,"
1251,II.,"Ready for a plumper falsehood,"
1252,II.,Spoken to his lady's order.
1253,II.,"Soon a knock, which sounds familiar."
1254,II.,"Lo! it is the dunning trader,"
1255,II.,Who is sorely run to hold him
1256,II.,From the stream of dangerous rumours;
1257,II.,But the answer thus is told him--
1258,II.,"""Not at home, my lady is not."""
1259,II.,"So the tradesman from her doorway,"
1260,II.,"Empty-handed, homeward turns,"
1261,II.,Thinks not such a ready answer
1262,II.,Is an utter fabrication.
1263,II.,"Sero, from his seat beholding,"
1264,II.,"Saw this lounging lump of matter,"
1265,II.,Puffed up in pomp and splendor.
1266,II.,"He was moved to indignation,"
1267,II.,"And said, in a scornful manner,"
1268,II.,"""O blinded fool!  O filthy pomp!"
1269,II.,Glory ye in dust and shadows?
1270,II.,"See ye not the wild delusions,"
1271,II.,"Which ye cherish so and fondle,"
1272,II.,"Through the darkness they are set in?"""
1273,II.,"Said he to attendants by him,"
1274,II.,"""Go ye to that stately chamber"
1275,II.,Where this pompous woman sitteth;
1276,II.,Pass the trader in the doorway
1277,II.,"And the ready story-teller,"
1278,II.,Enter and lay hold upon her;
1279,II.,"Take the lusty look she weareth,"
1280,II.,"Cast it to the winds that ramble,"
1281,II.,Racing through the hills and mountains;
1282,II.,"Take her great imaginations,"
1283,II.,Sift them in the seive of honor--
1284,II.,"Lo! they are as dross and ashes,"
1285,II.,And her pomps and giddy grandeur
1286,II.,"Scatter and disperse them likewise."""
1287,II.,"So went Sero's servants forward,"
1288,II.,"Did as had their chief commanded,"
1289,II.,Smote this pompous woman sorely--
1290,II.,With the rod of sickness smote her;
1291,II.,"And the ruddy color left her,"
1292,II.,And those lofty airs and manners;
1293,II.,Sickness and a ghastly pallor
1294,II.,"Came upon her limbs and forehead,"
1295,II.,And she hourly sank and wasted
1296,II.,Till a spectre she resembled.
1297,II.,"Then the spirit fled the body,"
1298,II.,And was carried unto Sero;
1299,II.,Sero through the wicket passed it
1300,II.,To the pit of Long Damnation.
1301,II.,"What is now this pompous woman,"
1302,II.,And her great imagination?
1303,II.,"These have vanished like a shadow,"
1304,II.,As a myth or phantom figure;
1305,II.,"And that body, once so lusty,"
1306,II.,"Is a mouldering lump of matter,"
1307,II.,"Corruptible, and vile, and filthy."
1308,II.,
1309,II.,
1310,III.,III.
1311,III.,
1312,III.,
1313,III.,In a miserable dwelling
1314,III.,Sat a miserable old man
1315,III.,"Mid a heap of hoarded treasures,"
1316,III.,Buried in the walls and burrows;
1317,III.,"And it was his constant idol,"
1318,III.,And his brain was ever scheming
1319,III.,How he might augment the numbers.
1320,III.,"Oft he turned the treasure over,"
1321,III.,Counting fondly and recounting;
1322,III.,And he joyed to hear the jingle
1323,III.,Of the yellow coins he counted.
1324,III.,"Threescore years had been devoted,"
1325,III.,Scraping of this gain together.
1326,III.,"He had fed on scanty portion,"
1327,III.,Grudging sorely every morsel;
1328,III.,And had clothed himself in raiments
1329,III.,Which a beggar scarce would stand in.
1330,III.,"He had never fed the hungry,"
1331,III.,"And had never clothed the naked,"
1332,III.,That he might increase his riches.
1333,III.,Sero in this hovel saw him
1334,III.,Bending o'er his golden treasures;
1335,III.,"And he laughed derisive laughter,"
1336,III.,"And sarcastic was his manner,"
1337,III.,As his servants he commanded
1338,III.,"To the miser's presence, saying,"
1339,III.,"""Lo! our princely Sero wisteth"
1340,III.,"Whence are all these hoarded riches,--"
1341,III.,If in scruple they were gathered.
1342,III.,If ye long to take them with you
1343,III.,When you leave this land of Weemus
1344,III.,For the lands of the hereafter;
1345,III.,If ye think to buy a passport
1346,III.,"To the land of Blisses with them,"
1347,III.,Ye are sadly much mistaken.
1348,III.,This we deem as dross and worthless.
1349,III.,Ye can never enter thereto
1350,III.,Bearing such a burden with you.
1351,III.,"Ye must feed the hungry with it,"
1352,III.,"And must clothe the naked wanderer,"
1353,III.,And employ it as a talent
1354,III.,To be used for wiser purpose
1355,III.,"Than to hoard in walls and burrows,"
1356,III.,If ye long to be admitted
1357,III.,"To the tranquil land of Blisses."""
1358,III.,But the old man would not listen
1359,III.,To the words of wisdom spoken;
1360,III.,"He was so engrossed in counting,"
1361,III.,And in adding to his riches.
1362,III.,"So the servant raised his weapon,"
1363,III.,"Sorely therewith smote the miser,--"
1364,III.,"With destruction did he smite him,--"
1365,III.,That he fell a lifeless clay-heap
1366,III.,Down among the hoarded moneys;
1367,III.,And his spirit was removed
1368,III.,"Unto Sero, and he opened"
1369,III.,"Wide the wicket on his left hand,"
1370,III.,"And it passed into the darkness,"
1371,III.,To the pit of gloom and terrors.
1372,III.,Then the door was rudely opened
1373,III.,Of this miserable dwelling
1374,III.,By the people claiming kinship;
1375,III.,"And they scrambled for the riches,"
1376,III.,"And in many quarrels sought them,"
1377,III.,Tending to the disuniting
1378,III.,Of the sacred bonds of friendship;
1379,III.,"Brother against brother rising,"
1380,III.,Raging in a bitter conflict.
1381,III.,"Many, who received a portion,"
1382,III.,Went and squandered to his ruin
1383,III.,"All he had in lust and gambling,"
1384,III.,Till his life was sorely broken.
1385,III.,"When his riches had been pillaged,"
1386,III.,Then the body of the miser
1387,III.,"Was removed quick and coldly,"
1388,III.,Lowered in the grave and covered;
1389,III.,"But of they who followed with it,"
1390,III.,"No one wept a tear of sorrow,"
1391,III.,No one mourned for his departure;
1392,III.,"But they gave attendance only,--"
1393,III.,"That, stern duty had commanded."
1394,III.,"Thus the end was of the old man,"
1395,III.,Of the miserable miser.
1396,III.,
1397,III.,
1398,IV.,IV.
1399,IV.,
1400,IV.,
1401,IV.,In a wilderness of houses
1402,IV.,"In the heart of a great city,"
1403,IV.,"Full of riches, full of plenty,"
1404,IV.,"And of people high and prosperous,"
1405,IV.,"Of its ancient greatness boasting,"
1406,IV.,And its modern princely splendors;
1407,IV.,"In a loathsome and a dark street,"
1408,IV.,"Foulsome odors rising from it,"
1409,IV.,"Rife and pregnant with diseases,"
1410,IV.,"Stood a hovel, foul and filthy;"
1411,IV.,"Lay a being, wane and wasted,"
1412,IV.,On a straw heap in a corner;
1413,IV.,"Scarce a rag to hide her person,"
1414,IV.,Lice and vermin creeping on her;
1415,IV.,"And beside her stood distraction,"
1416,IV.,"Woe, and want, and piercing hunger;"
1417,IV.,"And her look was wild and vacant,"
1418,IV.,"Like a spectre's, wandering madly."
1419,IV.,"When the night came, it was laden"
1420,IV.,"Much with gloomy fear and sadness,"
1421,IV.,And a trembling apprehension
1422,IV.,That the dawn would not approach her;
1423,IV.,And the morning was attended
1424,IV.,With but little hope or succour.
1425,IV.,"Charity, in cold attendance,"
1426,IV.,Came with many words and wishes;
1427,IV.,"And, in fair and full pretending,"
1428,IV.,"Stood, and pitied, and regretted;"
1429,IV.,But it gave a meagre pittance
1430,IV.,"Or of comfort or appeasing,"
1431,IV.,"To withdraw the pangs of hunger,"
1432,IV.,Or relieve her sunken spirit.
1433,IV.,But good Sero saw in pity.
1434,IV.,He beheld her calm endurance
1435,IV.,Of the anguish bearing on her;
1436,IV.,And he sent and took her spirit--
1437,IV.,"Took it gently from the ruin,"
1438,IV.,From the filth and the pollution;
1439,IV.,And he opened wide the wicket
1440,IV.,"By his right hand, and conveyed it"
1441,IV.,From the misery and anguish
1442,IV.,"To the happy land of Blisses,"
1443,IV.,To the land of peace and plenty.
1444,IV.,
1445,IV.,With the burden of my stories
1446,IV.,"I shall not detain you further,"
1447,IV.,Lest ye weary to pursue them
1448,IV.,Through the dreary way they lead you.
1449,IV.,"Let me further only mention,"
1450,IV.,Sero's servants were engaged
1451,IV.,Ever seeking and conveying
1452,IV.,Subjects from the hands of Weemus
1453,IV.,To the watch-ward of their chieftain.
1454,IV.,Mute and mystic were their movements;
1455,IV.,"Softly, and without observance,"
1456,IV.,"Passed they to the secret chamber,--"
1457,IV.,Took from thence the hidden subject;
1458,IV.,From the lover's fond embraces
1459,IV.,Tore away his dearest treasure--
1460,IV.,"She, to whom his life was wedded,"
1461,IV.,Was for ever sworn betrothed;
1462,IV.,"Went into the stately dwelling,"
1463,IV.,"And the lowly and the humble,"
1464,IV.,Heedless of position took them;
1465,IV.,"To the sacred courts of prayer,"
1466,IV.,Where the Maker of the kingdoms
1467,IV.,Held communion with the people;
1468,IV.,"And into the gay assemblies,"
1469,IV.,"To the scenes of mirth and gladness,"
1470,IV.,"Where were songs and revel dances,"
1471,IV.,In a maddened fulness rising.
1472,IV.,Many widows left they mourning--
1473,IV.,"Widows wailing, orphans weeping,"
1474,IV.,"In unmitigated sorrow,"
1475,IV.,For the loss of near and dear ones.
1476,IV.,Hard and cruel seemed their dealings
1477,IV.,In the sight of all the people;
1478,IV.,For they could not learn the purpose
1479,IV.,"Which, in all their acts, directed."
1480,IV.,Yet these were most wisely ordered;
1481,IV.,"For the Maker of the kingdom,"
1482,IV.,"Of Nimaera's kingdom,--moved them--"
1483,IV.,"Moved, and guided, and informed them."
1484,IV.,Sero to the land of Blisses
1485,IV.,Passed all the just and lowly;
1486,IV.,They whose lives had been preserved
1487,IV.,From the soiling stains of evil;
1488,IV.,"Who had lived in single purpose,"
1489,IV.,Holy and uprightly always;
1490,IV.,"Who had made oblations fitting,"
1491,IV.,Praise and honor to the Founder
1492,IV.,Of Nimaera and his kingdom;
1493,IV.,And had made a full endeavour
1494,IV.,In obeying the commandments
1495,IV.,Which were written for their guidance;
1496,IV.,Who of charity gave freely
1497,IV.,"Unto all the poor and needy,"
1498,IV.,"And, in giving, had no purpose"
1499,IV.,Selfishly to further thereby.
1500,IV.,But unto the pit of terrors
1501,IV.,"Evil and unrighteous people,"
1502,IV.,All the lukewarm and the heedless
1503,IV.,"Of the order of the statutes,"
1504,IV.,"All blasphemers and revilers,"
1505,IV.,"And all foul and filthy talkers,"
1506,IV.,"Liars, brawlers, and adulterers,"
1507,IV.,"They whose hands are stained in murder,"
1508,IV.,"All the proud and haughty boasters,"
1509,IV.,"All licentious and deceivers,"
1510,IV.,"They who are the poor's oppressors,"
1511,IV.,"Robbers and unjust receivers,--"
1512,IV.,These for ever had their portion
1513,IV.,In the pit of gloom and terrors.
1514,IV.,
1515,IV.,If ye wonder at its greatness
1516,IV.,And the grand and deep foundation
1517,IV.,"Of the kingdom of Nimaera,"
1518,IV.,"We will take a tour and see it,"
1519,IV.,Going unto every limit
1520,IV.,"Where Nimaera great in power is,"
1521,IV.,"Where he holds his goodly council,"
1522,IV.,Chief of all the powers beside him.
1523,IV.,"From the womb of words it came forth,"
1524,IV.,"Out of chaos and of darkness,"
1525,IV.,"First in rude and wild confusion,"
1526,IV.,Then arranged in goodly order;
1527,IV.,"Lands and waters, woods and pastures,"
1528,IV.,And with moving creatures peopled.
1529,IV.,"First, behold the orbs above us,"
1530,IV.,Which are ever sparkling brightly;
1531,IV.,Let us upward rise and see them--
1532,IV.,"See their great and many wonders,"
1533,IV.,With a wonder rising mountains
1534,IV.,Through the circuit they are set in.
1535,IV.,"These are worlds like our own one,"
1536,IV.,"And have each their separate people,"
1537,IV.,"Laws, and customs, and strange dealings;"
1538,IV.,"And these worlds are ever turning,"
1539,IV.,"Moving round the orbs of splendor,"
1540,IV.,"Fixed, in the height of spaces,"
1541,IV.,For a light and heat unto them.
1542,IV.,Now we wonder if these people
1543,IV.,"Are by evil spirits haunted,"
1544,IV.,"Which incite them to rebellion,"
1545,IV.,And destroy their God-like image;
1546,IV.,"But we cannot solve the wonder,"
1547,IV.,And must choose to sit in darkness.
1548,IV.,Then I guide you hence awayward
1549,IV.,"From the sparkling of this system,"
1550,IV.,"From the sun's rebounding brightness,"
1551,IV.,"And the pale moon's ever-fair light,"
1552,IV.,"And the many colored star lights,"
1553,IV.,"Blended in a great profusion,"
1554,IV.,"To the limits of our world,"
1555,IV.,Which we best can know and search in.
1556,IV.,"First, unto the boundless ocean,"
1557,IV.,By the billow which returneth
1558,IV.,"Echo to great Neptune's call,"
1559,IV.,Where the mermaid host sojourneth
1560,IV.,In his ancient rocky hall;
1561,IV.,"Where Leviathan, the mighty"
1562,IV.,"Keeper of all Neptune's treasure,"
1563,IV.,Roams around the rocky caverns
1564,IV.,"In majestic state, exploring."
1565,IV.,Let us see these mighty waters
1566,IV.,"When they rise in foaming billows,"
1567,IV.,"Swallowing towns, and ships, and people,"
1568,IV.,Roaring like a mighty thunder;
1569,IV.,"And, when they are still and peaceful,"
1570,IV.,"Like a plain of pasture spreading,"
1571,IV.,Sleeping as a virgin sleepeth
1572,IV.,Ere vain love-dreams fill her bosom.
1573,IV.,"Both these aspects are majestic,"
1574,IV.,"Grand, and pleasing, and inspiring."
1575,IV.,On a bark we will convey us
1576,IV.,"Through the peering rocks and islands,"
1577,IV.,"Where the Summer brings its sunshine,"
1578,IV.,"And the Winter frost and snow-storms,"
1579,IV.,For a season to the lone isles.
1580,IV.,"Then unto the tropic regions,"
1581,IV.,Where the proud sun pours its glory
1582,IV.,On the burning sandy deserts;
1583,IV.,"Streams of brightness everlasting,"
1584,IV.,Like ten thousand mountains blazing;
1585,IV.,And the khamsheens wild and fiercely
1586,IV.,"Sweep in burning flakes along them,"
1587,IV.,And torment the weary traveller
1588,IV.,"Who is slowly wading through them,"
1589,IV.,Thirsting for a cooling river.
1590,IV.,And 'tis there the wild tornado
1591,IV.,"Riseth in its frame of terror,"
1592,IV.,"Wild, and fierce, and unrelenting."
1593,IV.,To the spreading woods and forests
1594,IV.,"Of the black pine and the myrtle,"
1595,IV.,"Of the cedar and the red birch,"
1596,IV.,"Of the oak tree and the walnut,"
1597,IV.,"Of the tulip and mahogany,"
1598,IV.,"All in branchy webwork blended,"
1599,IV.,That the light can hardly enter
1600,IV.,To remove the clouds of darkness
1601,IV.,In the vast and deep recesses;
1602,IV.,"Where the lion and the tiger,"
1603,IV.,"Where the panther and the leopard,"
1604,IV.,"And the jaguar and hyaena,"
1605,IV.,"And the tan wolf and the ocelot,"
1606,IV.,"In the daytime hold their parley,"
1607,IV.,"And resort for wakeful slumbers,"
1608,IV.,Till the dusky hand of black night
1609,IV.,Draweth down her curtain on them;
1610,IV.,Then they leave the sylvan passes
1611,IV.,"To traverse the open valley,"
1612,IV.,"Prowling after luckless surfeit,"
1613,IV.,Lurking by the lakes and rivers
1614,IV.,For the panting prey which cometh
1615,IV.,To allay its thirsty feelings
1616,IV.,At their sweet and cooling waters.
1617,IV.,"There the owl at midnight whoopeth,"
1618,IV.,"And the lions roar majestic,"
1619,IV.,And the many prowling wild brutes
1620,IV.,"Raise such divers sounds and noises,"
1621,IV.,That it gives a fearful grandeur
1622,IV.,To the scene at hours of midnight.
1623,IV.,To the rocky hills and mountains
1624,IV.,"We will next direct our journey,"
1625,IV.,"Which with heathy robes are mantled,"
1626,IV.,And whose heads are ever wearing
1627,IV.,Caps of snow of many ages.
1628,IV.,"These are in adorning climates,"
1629,IV.,"Where the seasons bring their changes,"
1630,IV.,"Where comes hoary-headed white frost,"
1631,IV.,"And the plumy flakes of white snow,"
1632,IV.,"Showered around in bounty's largess,"
1633,IV.,"Lend the plains a pure white carpet,"
1634,IV.,"And the hills a dazzling wrapper,"
1635,IV.,"Which they don in princely grandeur,"
1636,IV.,Till the herald voice resoundeth
1637,IV.,"O'er the mountains, hills, and valleys,"
1638,IV.,From the orient regions coming:
1639,IV.,"""Haste ye, Winter, your departure,"
1640,IV.,"And remove those chill adornments,"
1641,IV.,"Fold those dreary garments quickly,"
1642,IV.,And begone unto your own land;
1643,IV.,"For our fairy queen approacheth,"
1644,IV.,Comes our gentle queen to claim her
1645,IV.,Now the rule of this dominion.
1646,IV.,Hark how sweet the songs she bringeth!
1647,IV.,"We shall give her welcome greetings."""
1648,IV.,Now the peaceful vales and pastures
1649,IV.,All in beauty spread before us;
1650,IV.,"And the fragrant kine are grazing,"
1651,IV.,And the merry lambs run frisking
1652,IV.,"Mid the perfumes of the meadow,"
1653,IV.,From the odors of the Spring flowers;
1654,IV.,And the Cashet dove is cooing
1655,IV.,Love songs to its cherished mate;
1656,IV.,And the shepherd boy is wooing
1657,IV.,By the rustic cottage gate.
1658,IV.,"There the swains, in nature's freedom,"
1659,IV.,Pour their mirth around profusely;
1660,IV.,And the aged people fondly
1661,IV.,See the mirth they once partook of.
1662,IV.,"Now, from scenes so sweet and pleasant,"
1663,IV.,We must turn and journey onward;
1664,IV.,"From the mountains' rugged grandeur,"
1665,IV.,Where the chamois and the wild deer
1666,IV.,Roam in constant freedom over;
1667,IV.,"Where the eagle soaring flyeth,"
1668,IV.,Scouting with a keen beholding;
1669,IV.,"And with thunders rolling by us,"
1670,IV.,"And with lightnings trouling round us,"
1671,IV.,Seek for other scenes and fancies.
1672,IV.,"Thence away unto the regions,"
1673,IV.,"Gliding o'er the restless billows,"
1674,IV.,"Through the howling storms and tempests,"
1675,IV.,"Unto scenes of snow and icelands,"
1676,IV.,Where the blocks of ice are dancing
1677,IV.,"Like huge hills amid the billows,"
1678,IV.,"And the snows are ever sleeping,"
1679,IV.,And the frosts are ever biting;
1680,IV.,"Where the bears go prowling wildly,"
1681,IV.,Creeping from their icy caverns.
1682,IV.,"There we find a nature also,"
1683,IV.,And a people who enjoy it.
1684,IV.,But that we have made a survey
1685,IV.,"Rudely of the different regions,"
1686,IV.,And in visits on our journey
1687,IV.,Have discerned the varying customs
1688,IV.,Of the many different people
1689,IV.,"Who take glory in their white skins,"
1690,IV.,"Or of others who, alikewise,"
1691,IV.,Build their pride in skins of copper;
1692,IV.,Let us notice more minutely
1693,IV.,"Scenes, and wonders, and behaviours"
1694,IV.,"On this kingdom of Nimaera,"
1695,IV.,As they often come before us.
1696,IV.,"So the little stream we follow,"
1697,IV.,"Rising from a rocky mountain,"
1698,IV.,"See it moving onward, onward,"
1699,IV.,"Gathering force, and power, and beauty,"
1700,IV.,"Till it gets a rolling river,"
1701,IV.,"Sweeping onward to the ocean,"
1702,IV.,"Watering many pleasant valleys,"
1703,IV.,Cheering many a thirsty traveller.
1704,IV.,This is like a man who riseth
1705,IV.,From a humble life and hidden
1706,IV.,"Unto power, and wealth, and wisdom,"
1707,IV.,"Gaining large and goodly influence,"
1708,IV.,"Giving, as he upward rises,"
1709,IV.,"Courage unto needy pilgrims,"
1710,IV.,Help unto the homeless wanderer.
1711,IV.,These are of Nimaera's kingdom.
1712,IV.,"But, as we have traced the river"
1713,IV.,"From its wild and rustic birthplace,"
1714,IV.,Let us see the scenes beside it;
1715,IV.,And in wonder deep we ponder
1716,IV.,"How all these things were created,"
1717,IV.,And of the unbounded knowledge
1718,IV.,Of the Being great who made them.
1719,IV.,First we pass the lake which spreadeth
1720,IV.,"Wide its bosom to the sunshine,"
1721,IV.,Or unto the winds and tempests;
1722,IV.,"By its mountain bulwarks guarded,"
1723,IV.,Which for everlasting passion
1724,IV.,Keep the couch whereon it sleepeth.
1725,IV.,"Then the sweet and happy village,"
1726,IV.,"Standing in the peaceful valley,"
1727,IV.,Fraught of fondest recollections
1728,IV.,Of the happy days of childhood
1729,IV.,"Unto many far departed,"
1730,IV.,Toiling through the world's courses.
1731,IV.,"There is simple joy and humble,"
1732,IV.,And in unity the daytime
1733,IV.,And the tranquil of the night time
1734,IV.,Keep harmonious pleasures by it.
1735,IV.,"Stand around it woods and pastures,"
1736,IV.,"Full of song, and peace, and plenty;"
1737,IV.,"O'er them softest winds are wafted,"
1738,IV.,"Sporting gently with the leaflets,"
1739,IV.,"Which unite in murmurs often,"
1740,IV.,Seeming to reproach them thuswise:
1741,IV.,"""Why came ye so near our pillows,"
1742,IV.,To disturb the peaceful order
1743,IV.,"Of our slumbers sweet and soothing?"""
1744,IV.,In the east behold the gay orb
1745,IV.,Leave its cradle for rejoicing
1746,IV.,O'er its course in might and grandeur.
1747,IV.,On the west behold the pillow
1748,IV.,Where it lieth down to slumber.
1749,IV.,"Next, as we go wandering onward"
1750,IV.,"From these rustic scenes and pleasing,"
1751,IV.,"Comes the city, overflowing"
1752,IV.,With a motley population.
1753,IV.,There oft pestilence and sickness
1754,IV.,"Pay each other salutation,"
1755,IV.,And unite their fatal efforts
1756,IV.,"To destroy in deadly numbers,"
1757,IV.,"Raging through the streets in darkness,"
1758,IV.,And disguised in the daytime
1759,IV.,To betray the one who thinks not
1760,IV.,That his doom is yet so near him.
1761,IV.,There the harlot of the midnight
1762,IV.,Holdeth forth her deadly charmings
1763,IV.,To entice the blind and simple.
1764,IV.,He is simple who doth lend her
1765,IV.,Such a glance that lusts go after;
1766,IV.,He defiled that partaketh
1767,IV.,Of the couch she sheweth to him.
1768,IV.,"Seek of wisdom, and refrain thee"
1769,IV.,From the path whereon she lurketh;
1770,IV.,"She will draw thy vigor from thee,"
1771,IV.,And thy spirit to destruction.
1772,IV.,"There is sin, in all its blackness,"
1773,IV.,Spreading wide its vile infection.
1774,IV.,Like unto a thief it stealeth
1775,IV.,Through the crowded lanes and alleys;
1776,IV.,"And appeareth, robed more gaily,"
1777,IV.,"Yet as hideous in its purpose,"
1778,IV.,"In the dwellings of the lofty,"
1779,IV.,On their walks and promenadings.
1780,IV.,Here the young are led from virtue
1781,IV.,Unto every ill devising;
1782,IV.,"As the lad who, in his anger,"
1783,IV.,Curseth a reproving parent
1784,IV.,"Daily wanders unto evil,"
1785,IV.,"Till his hand is raised to murder,"
1786,IV.,Reeking in a brother's life-blood.
1787,IV.,"Then of fear he is betaken,"
1788,IV.,"And a bloody spirit haunts him,"
1789,IV.,Till his days are sadly ended
1790,IV.,Hanging on the loathsome gallows.
1791,IV.,"Here is revel mirth and gladness,"
1792,IV.,"And gay scenes, where flock the simple."
1793,IV.,"They are simple who, allured,"
1794,IV.,Follow Pleasure's fleeting phantom.
1795,IV.,"They are led deluded onward,"
1796,IV.,"Till it is a curse unto them,"
1797,IV.,And they have not power to leave it.
1798,IV.,"They are led to low desires,"
1799,IV.,Craving unto lust and evil;
1800,IV.,"As the drunkard and profaner,"
1801,IV.,As the vile and the licentious
1802,IV.,"Glory in plebian language,"
1803,IV.,"With their sharp tongues dipt in slander,"
1804,IV.,"And their words in curses flowing,"
1805,IV.,Think not of their awful ending
1806,IV.,Till destruction comes upon them.
1807,IV.,Thus the gorgeous devil hieth
1808,IV.,"To the grand and gay assemblies,"
1809,IV.,And attend him many pages
1810,IV.,In their many-colored costumes;
1811,IV.,"They are eager at enlisting,--"
1812,IV.,Luring numbers to his bondage.
1813,IV.,Have you taken his temptation?
1814,IV.,Are you too an eager worker
1815,IV.,To allure the simple to him?
1816,IV.,Say how many souls are writhing
1817,IV.,"In a long and sad destruction,"
1818,IV.,Who pursued a better pathway
1819,IV.,Till you lured them to forego it.
1820,IV.,But I must not wander thuswise.
1821,IV.,"We are now in the great city,"
1822,IV.,"Where the lofty and the lowly,"
1823,IV.,"And the sumptuous and the starving,"
1824,IV.,Are within each other's shadows.
1825,IV.,There the merchant and the trader
1826,IV.,Tendeth each his own transactions;
1827,IV.,"Some deal fairly, some deal falsely."
1828,IV.,And the judges sit dispensing
1829,IV.,Seeming justice to the people;
1830,IV.,"But their judgments are corrupted,"
1831,IV.,And they rule in wrong or favor.
1832,IV.,There is constant din and bustle;
1833,IV.,And the weary shopman standeth
1834,IV.,Day to day in close confinement;
1835,IV.,And the pallid seamstress sitteth
1836,IV.,For a long and tedious twelve hours
1837,IV.,"Stitching, while her life is ebbing"
1838,IV.,In a rapid current from her.
1839,IV.,"Now awhile we see the playhouse,"
1840,IV.,"And the giddy hall of music,"
1841,IV.,"And the scenes exposed therein,"
1842,IV.,Oft immodest and immoral.
1843,IV.,"Next the nest of thieves and robbers,"
1844,IV.,"With their heaps of spoil and plunder,"
1845,IV.,And their hidden laws and customs.
1846,IV.,"Then we seek the house of prayer,"
1847,IV.,"Which is only weekly opened,"
1848,IV.,Or which day to day inviteth
1849,IV.,"Weary souls into its shadow,"
1850,IV.,There to hold a sweet communion
1851,IV.,"With the God who made and keeps them,"
1852,IV.,Or the silent hours of midnight
1853,IV.,To employ in watchful prayer.
1854,IV.,As we come unto His presence
1855,IV.,"Let us bow in holy reverence,"
1856,IV.,"As is ever due and fitting,"
1857,IV.,To the God who there descendeth.
1858,IV.,Now behold the people gathered;
1859,IV.,"They are all as one together,"
1860,IV.,But their thoughts are widely parted.
1861,IV.,"Some are earnest, true, and godly,"
1862,IV.,Others wicked and regardless;
1863,IV.,"Some are semi-sanctimonious,"
1864,IV.,(Most obnoxious of deceivers.)
1865,IV.,Let us see their inward purpose.
1866,IV.,One doth offer true oblation--
1867,IV.,"Praise and worship, as he seemeth;"
1868,IV.,While the thoughts of one near by him
1869,IV.,Are among the world's pleasures;
1870,IV.,And another has come hither
1871,IV.,"To give homage, style, and fashion;"
1872,IV.,And another thinks of feasting
1873,IV.,(His great god is in his belly.)
1874,IV.,Suchlike is the varied purpose
1875,IV.,"Of the lofty and the humble,"
1876,IV.,Met together and commingled
1877,IV.,In this sacred house of prayer.
1878,IV.,"Now we leave this hallowed building,"
1879,IV.,And again the street we enter.
1880,IV.,"There we meet a mournful number,"
1881,IV.,"In a mournful measuring treading,"
1882,IV.,All in sombre garments vested;
1883,IV.,And in reverent awe we follow
1884,IV.,To the place where sculls of dead men
1885,IV.,And the framework of the body
1886,IV.,"In the grave's deep stillness slumber,--"
1887,IV.,Where the worms are ever feeding
1888,IV.,On the bodies fast decaying.
1889,IV.,There the mourners lay their burden
1890,IV.,"In the cold grave, weeping on it"
1891,IV.,Tears of anguish deep and bitter;
1892,IV.,"And they heap the mould upon it,"
1893,IV.,"And return a little season,"
1894,IV.,Till the time for their departure:
1895,IV.,Soon in death they also slumber.
1896,IV.,Let us always keep as sacred
1897,IV.,"This still dwelling of our fathers,"
1898,IV.,"Whereto oft the lonely mourner,"
1899,IV.,"Oft the orphan and the widow,"
1900,IV.,Come to weep a tear of sorrow
1901,IV.,On the cold ground which enshrineth
1902,IV.,The remains of dear ones parted
1903,IV.,Ever from their earthly presence.
1904,IV.,"Now we leave the crowded city,"
1905,IV.,"With its mingled good and evil,"
1906,IV.,"With its noise, and din, and bustle,"
1907,IV.,"And the roll of laden waggon,"
1908,IV.,"And the mail cart, and the black van;"
1909,IV.,"And we pass a little onward,"
1910,IV.,"Down beside the pleasant river,"
1911,IV.,"To the fields of war and bloodshed,"
1912,IV.,"Where destruction's storm is raging,"
1913,IV.,Where the valiant and the brave men
1914,IV.,All around are thickly falling--
1915,IV.,"Falling as the leaves of Autumn,"
1916,IV.,"Trampled in the dust around them,"
1917,IV.,"Where they soon will be forgotten,"
1918,IV.,Sleeping in the depth of ages.
1919,IV.,"Gory red the river runneth,"
1920,IV.,And the plains with blood are steaming--
1921,IV.,"Boiling blood, which from the wounded"
1922,IV.,"Floweth, gushing fast and freely."
1923,IV.,"Why is all this ruthless ravage,"
1924,IV.,And this people fiercely warring?
1925,IV.,"It is for a vain ambition,"
1926,IV.,Or a little earthly matter
1927,IV.,Which they cannot settle better
1928,IV.,"Than in war and deadly bloodshed,"
1929,IV.,Or to gain an angry vengeance
1930,IV.,For some insult which appeareth
1931,IV.,To imagination hideous.
1932,IV.,Now we leave the sterner presence
1933,IV.,"Of the earth and all its changes,"
1934,IV.,"And we take the wings of fancy,"
1935,IV.,"(Which is sister to poesy),"
1936,IV.,Guided by the light of record
1937,IV.,"Thereon mount, and fly, surveying,"
1938,IV.,Far above the heights of knowledge.
1939,IV.,And we take a retrospective
1940,IV.,"Of the ancient times and people,"
1941,IV.,"When was nature young and blooming,"
1942,IV.,"When our fathers were created,"
1943,IV.,And within the blessed Eden
1944,IV.,Set to tend and to adorn it.
1945,IV.,"Adam with his Eve beloved,"
1946,IV.,"Happy in their single nature,"
1947,IV.,"Thus brought forth to joy and pleasure,"
1948,IV.,"Innocent and sweet amusement,"
1949,IV.,In attending on the fair wants
1950,IV.,"Of the creatures set around them,"
1951,IV.,"Over which, in kingly greatness,"
1952,IV.,"They were made the head, the purpose"
1953,IV.,"Of these others in creation,"
1954,IV.,From the unexplored chaos.
1955,IV.,Thence we come into the present.
1956,IV.,Age to age doth bring us onward
1957,IV.,Through the fickle term of nations
1958,IV.,"And the changes of the people,"
1959,IV.,"Mid their tumults and their tranquils,"
1960,IV.,"As they stand in pomp and glory,"
1961,IV.,"Firm and faithful in their own strength,"
1962,IV.,Till its frailty cometh on them
1963,IV.,"And they are completely conquered,--"
1964,IV.,Broken down in great destruction.
1965,IV.,O'er the waters of the deluge
1966,IV.,"We come sailing onward, onward;"
1967,IV.,And arrive with many records
1968,IV.,"From the many downcast nations,"
1969,IV.,"From the people of all ages,"
1970,IV.,"First, and last, and intervening."
1971,IV.,And we pass the time allotted
1972,IV.,"To the gods of superstition,"
1973,IV.,"When the world was set in darkness,"
1974,IV.,"In the fear of gods of fancy,"
1975,IV.,Who held counsel on Olympus.
1976,IV.,"There sat Jupiter, the greatest,"
1977,IV.,"On his ivory and gold throne,"
1978,IV.,"And communed with his advisers,"
1979,IV.,"Who were Juno, his betrothed,"
1980,IV.,"Fairest goddess of the council,"
1981,IV.,Who gave from her depths of knowledge
1982,IV.,Good advisings to her chieftain.
1983,IV.,"Then were Mars, the fierce and warlike,"
1984,IV.,"And Apollo, for the poets,"
1985,IV.,"With Diana, his twin sister,"
1986,IV.,"Who sat on the silent moonbeam,"
1987,IV.,"Chaste, enchanting in her meekness."
1988,IV.,"Then stood Venus, rich in charmings,"
1989,IV.,Goddess sole of love and beauty;
1990,IV.,"And stood Mercury, the swiftest"
1991,IV.,Bearer of the council's tidings.
1992,IV.,"Then came Neptune, strong and mighty,"
1993,IV.,Ruler of the storms and tempests;
1994,IV.,"And the god of fire near him,"
1995,IV.,"Who was Vulcan, rude and ready."
1996,IV.,"And to Vesta, Saturn's daughter,"
1997,IV.,"Were entrusted fires also,"
1998,IV.,More refined and more celestial;
1999,IV.,While the number was completed
2000,IV.,"By good Ceres, full of bounty,"
2001,IV.,Keeper of the corns and harvests.
2002,IV.,"Thus in council sat the great gods,"
2003,IV.,Dealing fates unto the nations;
2004,IV.,So the simple people fancied.
2005,IV.,"Now the flight of fancy over,"
2006,IV.,"She hath brought us safely homeward,"
2007,IV.,To the spot we love the fondest.
2008,IV.,There we lay the many tokens
2009,IV.,"Of the wondrous journey by us,"
2010,IV.,"And reflect now quaintly, calmly"
2011,IV.,On the great things we have witnessed
2012,IV.,In this kingdom of Nimaera;
2013,IV.,"And, before our thoughts are settled,"
2014,IV.,We by votaries are surrounded
2015,IV.,"From the courts of every people,"
2016,IV.,"From the throne of every nation,"
2017,IV.,"Who, in tongues that widely vary,"
2018,IV.,"And in words that sound so strangely,"
2019,IV.,"Give their mission, bear their record"
2020,IV.,"Of the throne of King Nimaera,"
2021,IV.,"Of his ancient power and greatness,"
2022,IV.,"Of his presence with the modern,"
2023,IV.,With their people of the present.
2024,IV.,And to give its own conviction
2025,IV.,"Shall the voice of every creature,"
2026,IV.,"Of the nobles of creation,"
2027,IV.,"All in one together mingle,"
2028,IV.,From the feeble voice of old age
2029,IV.,To the lisping tongue of childhood.
2030,IV.,"Grand shall be their mingled accents,"
2031,IV.,"Which in verity are rising,"
2032,IV.,"Telling likewise of Nimaera,"
2033,IV.,"Who their every purpose ruleth,"
2034,IV.,"Tends it in its first conception,"
2035,IV.,"Baffles wholly and destroys it,"
2036,IV.,"Or unto completion brings it,"
2037,IV.,"Bringeth out its faults or virtues,"
2038,IV.,Shewing where its merit lieth.
2039,IV.,"Then shall every beast that liveth,"
2040,IV.,"Every bird and every reptile,"
2041,IV.,"Every fish and every insect,"
2042,IV.,Raise their own peculiar voices--
2043,IV.,"(Terrible, or sweet, or puny);"
2044,IV.,And will testify their own way
2045,IV.,"Of the powers of King Nimaera,"
2046,IV.,"Who their being's fire feedeth,"
2047,IV.,"Gives them space for life and glory,"
2048,IV.,With that limit ends their being;
2049,IV.,For no hidden spirit have they
2050,IV.,Image to the holy Maker.
2051,IV.,"Now the grave shall yield its token,"
2052,IV.,"And the battle-field its relic,"
2053,IV.,Stained in gore and kept in glory;
2054,IV.,And the caverns of the ocean
2055,IV.,"Shall advance a token likewise,"
2056,IV.,"Opening wide their watery great doors,"
2057,IV.,Shew the works of many ages
2058,IV.,"By the hand of King Nimaera,"
2059,IV.,"With the wonders stored among them,"
2060,IV.,"Worked, and fashioned, and performed."
2061,IV.,"Then the voice of stormy Winter,"
2062,IV.,And the soft and pleasing fair notes
2063,IV.,"Of the Springtime and the Summer,"
2064,IV.,"And the richly-laden Autumn,"
2065,IV.,Shall a ready answer make us.
2066,IV.,"And the mighty wind that bloweth,"
2067,IV.,And the soothing and the soft breeze
2068,IV.,With a pensive murmur cometh--
2069,IV.,Cometh laden with responses
2070,IV.,From the trees of every forest
2071,IV.,"(Every leaflet's tiny voice joined),"
2072,IV.,"From the fair and fertile valleys,"
2073,IV.,"From among the hills and mountains,"
2074,IV.,With advisings to speak boldly
2075,IV.,Of the powers of King Nimaera;
2076,IV.,That in every race or ramble
2077,IV.,"Has his throne been set around them,"
2078,IV.,Built of wonders and composed
2079,IV.,Far amid the wilds and fertiles.
2080,IV.,Here and hence these heralds answer;
2081,IV.,"Then they take their pinions swiftly,"
2082,IV.,"And are vanished ere we know them,"
2083,IV.,"Still to roam, and race, and ramble."
2084,IV.,Next the voices shall be blended
2085,IV.,"Of the brooklets and great rivers,"
2086,IV.,"Of the ever-murmuring ocean,"
2087,IV.,"Of the wild and roaring thunders,"
2088,IV.,"Of the tempest howling terrors,"
2089,IV.,"Hailstones heavy and great snow-storms,"
2090,IV.,And the flames of fire roaring;
2091,IV.,"These shall boldly say their saying,"
2092,IV.,"That he is among them alway,"
2093,IV.,"That they have for ever known him,"
2094,IV.,And their strength dependeth on him.
2095,IV.,Then the rocks in echoes answer--
2096,IV.,"Answer to the roll of thunders,"
2097,IV.,"And the roaring of the ocean,"
2098,IV.,"In a myriad sounds replying,"
2099,IV.,Own the powers of King Nimaera.
2100,IV.,"Then the stars shall twinkle signs forth,"
2101,IV.,Like the language of the speechless;
2102,IV.,"And the sun in dazzling bright rays,"
2103,IV.,"And the moon with mellow fair beams,"
2104,IV.,"And the evening and the morning,"
2105,IV.,"And the noonday and the midnight,"
2106,IV.,"And the dew which gently falleth,"
2107,IV.,"And the raindrops and the vapors,"
2108,IV.,"And the mists on all the rivers,"
2109,IV.,And the fleecy and the black clouds
2110,IV.,"Shall inscribe their ready answers,"
2111,IV.,And with mystic fingers write thus:
2112,IV.,"""When our buoyant pinions take us"
2113,IV.,"High unto the outer heavens,"
2114,IV.,"Far beyond the eagle's soarings,"
2115,IV.,Then we see Nimaera's wonders
2116,IV.,In all spaces that we visit
2117,IV.,"On the earth or in the heavens,"
2118,IV.,"And, in every form that nears us,"
2119,IV.,See his wondrous power and greatness;
2120,IV.,"For his throne is firmly builded,"
2121,IV.,"Rising unto all the world."""
2122,IV.,And they further shall inform us
2123,IV.,That some strange and mystic stories
2124,IV.,Have been spoken of Nimaera
2125,IV.,"And his dealings with the people,"
2126,IV.,"Counted in the ancient numbers,"
2127,IV.,Reckoned in the current courses.
2128,IV.,Now that we are well informed
2129,IV.,"Of his throne, and power, and dealings,"
2130,IV.,"Let us hear the voice of Reason,"
2131,IV.,"Speaking lastly, yet abounding"
2132,IV.,"Much of wisdom and of foresight,"
2133,IV.,"Seeing, as a prophet, matters"
2134,IV.,Hidden yet upon the future;
2135,IV.,"And he tells us, ""Yet a short time"
2136,IV.,Stands the throne of King Nimaera;
2137,IV.,"He but reigns a season longer,"
2138,IV.,Then yields up his power and kingdom--
2139,IV.,Yields it to the hand which gave it;
2140,IV.,"And he well hath filled his mission,--"
2141,IV.,"Ever faithful, ever constant."
2142,IV.,"Now he steppeth from his high throne,"
2143,IV.,"Builded to the gates eternal,"
2144,IV.,"Which are quickly opened to him,"
2145,IV.,And he joins the never ending.
2146,IV.,"Then his kingdom is forgotten,"
2147,IV.,"And in flames as chaff consumed,"
2148,IV.,Rolled away as clouds of vapor;
2149,IV.,"Clouds of smoke and clouds of vapor,"
2150,IV.,"Flying with the roar of thunders,"
2151,IV.,"Terrible, and loud, and mighty,"
2152,IV.,And with lurid lights illuming
2153,IV.,All the vast unfathomed chaos.
2154,IV.,"Then comes gloom and dismal darkness,"
2155,IV.,"Falling over all the spaces,"
2156,IV.,When the flames forget their burning.
2157,IV.,"Now his people come for judgment,"
2158,IV.,"And they are in substance spirits,"
2159,IV.,Born to everlasting being.
2160,IV.,"Mighty is the Judge who sitteth,"
2161,IV.,And His throne a sea of splendor.
2162,IV.,He gives justice without favor.
2163,IV.,"He is good, and kind, and gentle."
2164,IV.,They whose lives have been directed
2165,IV.,"Just, and upright, and unswerving"
2166,IV.,"From the ways of truth, shall see Him"
2167,IV.,With a joy of sweetest measure.
2168,IV.,He is stern and firm in purpose.
2169,IV.,They whose lives have been of evil
2170,IV.,Tremble in His awful presence;
2171,IV.,"For they see their doom engraven,--"
2172,IV.,"'To the pit of Long Damnation,'"
2173,IV.,"Awful gloom and awful terrors."""

2267,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"To tell the mind that life remaineth near,"
2268,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Are the soft murmurings of the silvery stream,"
2269,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,The gentle winds which whisper to the trees
2270,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"As they go wandering in the border woods,"
2271,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Or now and then the screeching of an owl,"
2272,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The bleeting lamb, or distant watch-dog's howl."
2273,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,
2274,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,* * * * *
2275,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,
2276,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,'Twas on this scene Lord Henry loved to dwell--
2277,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,A noble bearer of a noble name--
2278,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Lured by the tranquil of a country home
2279,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,To muse upon the beauties of the land.
2280,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,'Twas here the castle of his fathers stood--
2281,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Time honored and of pleasing memories,"
2282,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Adorned of nature and of every art
2283,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which the devising of the mind can give
2284,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,To feed the fancy of admiring man.
2285,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,But in these pleasants soon there came a time
2286,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"When he got weary of the lonesome life,"
2287,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Which led him, day by day, in the same scenes,"
2288,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And did not still the longings of his soul.
2289,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,For now he felt the presence of a power
2290,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Which all men feel, that moves the will at ease"
2291,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Unto a bondage which they fain would shun,"
2292,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Yet loving well the while the gentle guile
2293,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which bids the soul unto the presence sweet
2294,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of some fair maid, whose winning charms had wrought"
2295,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Well on the strongholds of a purposed heart,"
2296,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Until the entrance hath been fully made,"
2297,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And it is captive to her choosing will,"
2298,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And all the forms to wedlock which pertain.
2299,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"This mystic power incited on him more,"
2300,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Till he resolved to seek a maiden fair,"
2301,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And share with her the blessings of his home,"
2302,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And mete with her the measure of his life.
2303,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Thus said the voice which whispered to his soul:
2304,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"""And she shall cheer me in the heavy hours,"
2305,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And give a spirit to my lonesome life;
2306,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And she shall be a maiden, young, and fair,"
2307,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And gentle, and be termed the sweetest flower"
2308,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Of all the land for many measures round;
2309,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And such a maiden I shall love, and serve,"
2310,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And honor, and revere, with all the love"
2311,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which an admiring soul can give to one
2312,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Who is the perfect image of his heart."""
2313,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And, ere a while, Lord Henry loved, and wooed,"
2314,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And wed a maiden of a worthy line,"
2315,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And led her gently to his country home,"
2316,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And used every power to make her glad,"
2317,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And loved and served her with a constant love,"
2318,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And had no mind to other than to her.
2319,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"For she was sweet, and fair, and gentle (more"
2320,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Than the bright picture he had fancied of);
2321,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And they were happy in such tranquil joys,"
2322,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"As day by day went fleeting on its course,"
2323,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And saw them still in one united love,"
2324,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And one to one the source of sweetest joy.
2325,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,These bore their record ere they passed away
2326,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Of some distinguished pleasure to imply--
2327,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,A sweetness to the retrospective thought.
2328,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,She was his sole companion day and night.
2329,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Oft he would lead her to the flowery lawn,"
2330,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And in the rosy bowers bedeck her hair,"
2331,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And watch the image of his soul repose
2332,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In all her beauty 'neath a rosy crown;
2333,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Amid the fragrance of the blooming eve,"
2334,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And the soft cadence from the sylvan towers,"
2335,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Beheld the heaving of her gentle breast,"
2336,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Moved by the passing of a peaceful breath,"
2337,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Until of love his soul would overflow;
2338,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then he would bend and lay his lips to hers,"
2339,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And pour a shower of mellow kisses there.
2340,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Then he loved well to hear the harp reply--
2341,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The silvery harp--unto her nimble touch,"
2342,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And shower its floods of melody away,"
2343,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,To mingle with the songs of nature by;
2344,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"For it knew well the softness of her touch,"
2345,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And gladly gave its music in return.
2346,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"But more he loved than music of the harp,"
2347,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Or songs of many valleys in the Spring,"
2348,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,When every fragment of the air is full
2349,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of song and all the arts of melody,"
2350,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"To hear the sweetness of her full-tuned voice,"
2351,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Raised to the measure of some favored song;
2352,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"A life-like presence lending to the theme,"
2353,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Until the soul is fervent in return
2354,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Of they who listen to its thrilling power.
2355,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then they would wander to the village oft,"
2356,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Now by the path along the bridge, and then"
2357,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Across the water by the ferry-boat;
2358,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"For the coy village is across the stream,"
2359,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Near on a line from where the castle stands,"
2360,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And nigh it well, that when the breeze accords,"
2361,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Or calm prevails, the sounds come floating o'er"
2362,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of mirthful lads in gambol on the green,"
2363,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Or the part song of buxom damsel raised,"
2364,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Who lightly busies at her noonday task;
2365,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Anon the chime of the church clock, which tells"
2366,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Another hour departed of the year.
2367,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And all these sounds familiar to them come,"
2368,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And all the village holds them in respect,"
2369,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which as they near the rustic boys will doff
2370,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Their brown worn caps in manner rustic like,"
2371,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,While dame and damsel pay a reverence meet
2372,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Unto the lady they have learnt to love;
2373,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"For she is loved by all the people well,"
2374,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And held in honor as a God-sent friend,--"
2375,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Kind-hearted to the poor, and to the sick"
2376,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,A double help and kindly comforter.
2377,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"In manner thus the seasons quickly pass,"
2378,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"One after one,--the flowery Summer and"
2379,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The golden Autumn, with her bounty hand;"
2380,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then, in the background, Winter, and again,"
2381,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"When Spring, the early Summer; it was then,"
2382,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Her full time having come, the lady went"
2383,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Unto her chamber, and brought forth a child."
2384,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And it was robed, and brought, and put into"
2385,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The father's hand, and he was very glad"
2386,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"With the full joy which fills a father's heart,"
2387,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And went and kissed his wife, and bade"
2388,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Her speedy well, and all things seemed good;"
2389,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And in his ear a sweet, soft voice foretold:"
2390,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"""Thine is a happy lot of years to come,"
2391,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,All full of tranquil and domestic bliss;
2392,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Thy paths are by the ways of harmony,"
2393,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And a fair train of love shall ever tend,"
2394,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"With all her blessings largely to bestow,"
2395,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Upon thy head as dew in Summer night."""
2396,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Again he went unto his wife, to see"
2397,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,How quickly she got well and how she fared
2398,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"For he was weary to be wanting her,"
2399,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And longed to see her graceful form again
2400,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Come quickly here and there about his home.
2401,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,But lo! he saw the hand of sickness had
2402,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Upon his loved one laid a ruthless hold,"
2403,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And that the lustre of her eye had gone,"
2404,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And that her voice had lost its brightest chords.
2405,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then day and night he watched her, and bestowed"
2406,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of every tendence he could think to give,"
2407,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Which would allay the fever, or imply"
2408,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Relief awhile unto her aching head.
2409,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"But day and night he saw her further wane,"
2410,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Her life-stream ebbing every hour away;
2411,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Until at last he saw her wane and die,"
2412,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Beheld her sink into the arms of death.
2413,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then woeful was the scene, to see him bend"
2414,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Upon the lifeless form in floods of woe,"
2415,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Whose bitter torrents overwhelmed long;
2416,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And much he wept in full and heavy tears,"
2417,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Till they who saw it thought his heart would break;
2418,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And for long hours he gazed upon her form,"
2419,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Nor could conceive that she was truly dead.
2420,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And all the household wept, and many came"
2421,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"To give him comfort, but he turned away,"
2422,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And could not hearken to their kindly words,"
2423,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And rose and left the house to wander out,"
2424,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And passed the old domestic at the door,"
2425,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Who dare not question where his master went.
2426,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And to the woods he wandered.  It was night,"
2427,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And long the warblers of the dale had sung
2428,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Their last glad anthem to the dying day,"
2429,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And gone to slumber in the sylvan bowers
2430,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Until the dawning of another morn.
2431,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And on he wandered, but he knew not whence,"
2432,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,For all his thoughts were maddened and confused.
2433,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then to the bower he came, where oft in time"
2434,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"But lately gone he had his loved one led,"
2435,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And with the fairest flowers bedecked her hair.
2436,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"He paused awhile, and, with a heavy sigh,"
2437,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Spake to the flowers, ""O ye fair flowers, receive"
2438,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,The lamentations of a widowed heart.
2439,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Thy gay perfections have no further charms;
2440,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And those sweet odors are diffused now
2441,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"As fragrance is unto a wasted land,"
2442,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Since she who loved them has for ever gone."""
2443,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Then on he pressed into the deepest depths
2444,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of the still woods, his mournful story told"
2445,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In tears and sighs unto the woods and wilds;
2446,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And they made answer in a murmur deep,"
2447,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which ran from tree to tree adown the break;
2448,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"While from the stream a low lamenting came,"
2449,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And the clear heavens wept gentle tear-drops down,"
2450,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And every star seemed as a pitying eye--
2451,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,An eye of love with sparkling tear-drops full.
2452,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And all around was mute, and the pale moon"
2453,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Came forth to take a survey of her realm,"
2454,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Parading in a calm majestic air
2455,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"From end to end, and casting here and there,"
2456,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Through the condenseness of the sylvan boughs,"
2457,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Her sidelong glances, which intrude the depths,"
2458,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And lay strange shadows wrangling on the ground.
2459,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Then for a while he stood amazed amid
2460,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The awful tremor of this death-like calm,"
2461,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And for a time his grief forgot its depth;
2462,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,For a calm wonder sat enthroned instead
2463,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Upon his soul, which shewed the great, and good,"
2464,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And grand conception of the God who made
2465,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,The earth and heavens in order so profound.
2466,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And, growing weary, there he sat him down"
2467,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Beneath the cover of a spreading tree;
2468,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,For it was many days since he had slept
2469,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Or rested for his earnest watchfulness.
2470,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,He breathed a silent prayer that God would send
2471,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Him comfort in and strength to bear the grief,"
2472,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then drew his mantle o'er him, and remained"
2473,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Wrapt in the sadness of his mournful thoughts,"
2474,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Until the gentle arms of slumber closed
2475,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Around him, and he slept a deep, soft sleep."
2476,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And in the watches of the night there came
2477,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,A bright and wondrous vision on his mind.
2478,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,He dreamt that on a lovely eve he sat
2479,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Beneath the shadow of a spreading tree,"
2480,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In adoration of the beauties round
2481,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,But heartsore with the burden of his woe;
2482,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,When the sweet fragments of a heavenly song
2483,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Broke on his ear.  He raised his eyes, and lo!"
2484,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Amid the tranquil heights above he saw
2485,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Forth from the portals of the eternal gates
2486,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Two angel forms descending unto him.
2487,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Their garments were as white as Winter snow,"
2488,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And on their brows were sparkling crowns of gold,"
2489,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And they had wings as angels, and each held"
2490,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"A banner in her hand, on which these words"
2491,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In golden letters were so strangely wrought:
2492,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"""'Tis peace, and love, and joy eternally"
2493,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Adorns the precincts of our blessed home."""
2494,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And bright their presence was as dazzling suns,"
2495,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which send a radiance through the heavens wide.
2496,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"They now before him stood, and she who spake"
2497,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Was lovely to behold; her perfect form
2498,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Was as the form of his departed one,"
2499,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Yet lovelier far; and the sweet voice did seem
2500,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,The same sweet voice he had been wont to hear.
2501,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"In fervent power, yet softly, thus she spake:"
2502,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"""Dear Henry, rise and mourn no more for me,"
2503,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Since I am in a sweet eternity,"
2504,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And dwell in peace, and joy, and love, and songs,"
2505,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Which are for ever gladly rising there.
2506,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Sweet were our days together spent below,"
2507,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,But sweeter far they shall be when above
2508,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,We are united through unending days
2509,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"With her, an angel too, who was our babe,"
2510,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And who hath come to bear me presence here."""
2511,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then by the hand she took him, and thus spake"
2512,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"In kind and pleading words: ""The laws of man"
2513,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Would hold and deem it just that, if a man"
2514,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In time of his prosperity forget
2515,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,To render to his God a full return
2516,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of thankfulness and praise, then he shall be"
2517,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,In time of his adversity forgot.
2518,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"But God is more compassionate, and says"
2519,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"That if a man turn from his heedless ways,"
2520,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And bear a true repentance, he shall live."
2521,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then I, the spirit of your once fond wife,"
2522,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Come from the realms of bliss, do thee adjure;"
2523,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Turn to thy God, and give Him worship due,"
2524,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And mourn not with a needless sorrow more.
2525,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then, but a season longer, ye shall come"
2526,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And join me in this never-ending bliss."""
2527,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Awe-struck and dumb the wondering Henry stood,"
2528,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And took communion from the Holy One;
2529,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"In adoration bound, he knew not whence"
2530,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"To make an answer fit, and would have knelt,"
2531,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Like as before a God, to worship them."
2532,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"But, ere he knew, they had on pinions bright"
2533,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Resumed their course unto the regions whence
2534,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"He saw them come; and, with a wondering look,"
2535,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"He watched them still ascend, until the gates"
2536,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of heaven opened, and they entered in."
2537,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then it was morn, and Henry woke from sleep,"
2538,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And looked in wonder on the things around,"
2539,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And felt bewildered for a time to know
2540,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"How hither he had come, and whence the cause."
2541,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Then fragments of the dream broke on his mind,"
2542,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And yet awhile the joys, the cares, the woes"
2543,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Came clear in their intensity, as when"
2544,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,He had endured them in the days just gone.
2545,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"The chilly numbness from his limbs removed,"
2546,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"He turned to wander homeward, being now"
2547,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Refreshed by sleep and more in spirit soothed,"
2548,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Reflecting long and deep on the stern truths
2549,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And troubles tending on the lives of men.
2550,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Then came the vision of the night before
2551,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Clear as the waters of a Summer stream,"
2552,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And bore its beauties to his soul anew,"
2553,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Wherefrom he saw a lucent line ascend,"
2554,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Of comfort and of warning to his life,"
2555,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Bidding his soul to higher things ascend,"
2556,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,As vapors rise--as vapors rise and flow--
2557,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"To seek the presence of the sunny heights,"
2558,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Sore of their sojourn in the sphere below;
2559,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And thus reflected on his bygone days:
2560,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"""Ah me! ah me! my latter life hath been"
2561,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"A sorry semblance of the lives of men,"
2562,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Who seek for pleasures in a barren land,"
2563,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"And look for comfort in an empty urn,"
2564,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,And lose the aim wherefore they live and die
2565,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,Amid the luring of deluding joys.
2566,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,O error bold! ye now thyself reveal
2567,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Within the chaos of departed time,"
2568,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"That she, my wife, received the honor due"
2569,LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.,"Unto my God, for she was as my God,--"

3215,THE SABBATH DAY.,The morning of the Sabbath day--in dight
3216,THE SABBATH DAY.,Of many a hallowed strain it comes.  The bell
3217,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Of every village o'er the plain doth tell,"
3218,THE SABBATH DAY.,"From its high seat, within the sacred tower"
3219,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Above the house of God, from hour to hour,"
3220,THE SABBATH DAY.,A joyous song; and in cathedral town
3221,THE SABBATH DAY.,The gladsome peals break forth and warble down;
3222,THE SABBATH DAY.,While through the city every belfrey gives
3223,THE SABBATH DAY.,"A glad reply, which seems to say, ""He lives!"
3224,THE SABBATH DAY.,"He lives!""  The song of praise is heard ascend,"
3225,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Raised to the heavenly throne, in one to blend"
3226,THE SABBATH DAY.,"With angels' song, from many a cottage rung,"
3227,THE SABBATH DAY.,Where on this day the father with his young
3228,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Sits down in peace; while, in the pine grove down"
3229,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The rural glen, a myriad voices crown"
3230,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The clear-tuned solo of the warbling thrush,"
3231,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Or oft in chorus to a duet flush,"
3232,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Sung with the full-piped blackbird of the wood,"
3233,THE SABBATH DAY.,Their notes are joined.  The aspect and the mood
3234,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Of everything is changed, as wont on day"
3235,THE SABBATH DAY.,Of toil the crowded city moves to lay
3236,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The bands of slumber for a time away,"
3237,THE SABBATH DAY.,But brings not out the bustle and the din
3238,THE SABBATH DAY.,Which is her weekday aspect; and within
3239,THE SABBATH DAY.,Her walls a stilly peace prevails; the roar
3240,THE SABBATH DAY.,And noise of lumbering waggon comes no more
3241,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Along the well-worn street, nor busy tread"
3242,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Of envoy, hurrying on, by duty led,"
3243,THE SABBATH DAY.,"To bank, or warehouse, or to court of law."
3244,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The myriad sounds have ceased, which nature saw"
3245,THE SABBATH DAY.,Were fit to wait upon the day of toil;
3246,THE SABBATH DAY.,Nor mendicant nor ballad beggar foil
3247,THE SABBATH DAY.,The sacred rest with their assiduous song.
3248,THE SABBATH DAY.,And round the factory door the noisy throng
3249,THE SABBATH DAY.,Forgets to come as on the other days;
3250,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Aside her task the weary seamstress lays,"
3251,THE SABBATH DAY.,Now from the close and foul-aired workroom free.
3252,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The toilsome shop is closed, and also he"
3253,THE SABBATH DAY.,Who for the week stood there doth taste the sweets
3254,THE SABBATH DAY.,Of liberty awhile; the penman meets
3255,THE SABBATH DAY.,No more the tiring scroll; and now in chain
3256,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The prisoner sits within his dungeon, wan"
3257,THE SABBATH DAY.,And weary; but he hears some soothing strain
3258,THE SABBATH DAY.,Break through the thick and iron-girded wall;
3259,THE SABBATH DAY.,And then the heavy shackles seem to fall
3260,THE SABBATH DAY.,From off his feet; a strange emotion fills
3261,THE SABBATH DAY.,"His soul, and through his wasted body thrills,"
3262,THE SABBATH DAY.,When of the bygone days he thinks in sweet
3263,THE SABBATH DAY.,And lingering thought; and then his eyes to meet
3264,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The scanty rays are turned, and on his mind"
3265,THE SABBATH DAY.,Awhile the captive fate forgets to find
3266,THE SABBATH DAY.,Its deepest force or weary sigh to send.
3267,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Turn from the city, and to country lend"
3268,THE SABBATH DAY.,A passing thought.  All labor is at rest.
3269,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The plough lies set, point in the mottled breast"
3270,THE SABBATH DAY.,Of half-tilled field; the flail is laid above
3271,THE SABBATH DAY.,The barn's brown wall; the shining sickles move
3272,THE SABBATH DAY.,Not from their keep; the woodman's axe is still;
3273,THE SABBATH DAY.,The golden sheaf doth not the feeder fill;
3274,THE SABBATH DAY.,The huntsman's horn is hung behind the door;
3275,THE SABBATH DAY.,The delver's spade stands idle on the floor;
3276,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The horse and oxen run the open field,"
3277,THE SABBATH DAY.,Set free to graze; the holloaing drivers wield
3278,THE SABBATH DAY.,"No whip or goad, and all the swain is free;"
3279,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The laborer walks abroad, and turns to see,"
3280,THE SABBATH DAY.,"With favoring look, the toilings of his hand,"
3281,THE SABBATH DAY.,And fruits of labor rising from the land;
3282,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The rustic lovers saunter in the fields,"
3283,THE SABBATH DAY.,To talk of love and reap the joy it yields.
3284,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The tower-clock now the worship-hour relates,"
3285,THE SABBATH DAY.,And every church the worshipper awaits.
3286,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Then thither come the cottar and his wife,"
3287,THE SABBATH DAY.,"(Once fair, now furrowed with the cares of life,)"
3288,THE SABBATH DAY.,"With sons and daughters; and, behind them near,"
3289,THE SABBATH DAY.,The jovial farmer and his wife appear.
3290,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Then comes the county squire; till the seats,"
3291,THE SABBATH DAY.,"One after one, are full.  Then shortly meets"
3292,THE SABBATH DAY.,The people's eager eye the tranquil face
3293,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Of their beloved pastor, in his place."
3294,THE SABBATH DAY.,"He kneels to God, and in deep fervour prays"
3295,THE SABBATH DAY.,A sweet and powerful prayer; then he lays
3296,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The open Bible down, and well expounds"
3297,THE SABBATH DAY.,"The message of the Saviour's love, till bounds,"
3298,THE SABBATH DAY.,"For truths so hallowed, every tending heart"
3299,THE SABBATH DAY.,In joy.  Then praise is sung; a ready part
3300,THE SABBATH DAY.,"Takes every voice to raise a worthy song,"
3301,THE SABBATH DAY.,Which breaks from seat to seat the aisle along.
3302,THE SABBATH DAY.,Then kneel the people by the throne of grace
3303,THE SABBATH DAY.,"To take the blessing, ere they part to pace"
3304,THE SABBATH DAY.,Again the world's besetting path.  It falls
3305,THE SABBATH DAY.,Among them like as dew upon the palls

3394,BEAUTY ADORNED.,A charm more sweet than all the rest to see.
3395,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"In short, she was perfection's perfect choice,"
3396,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And Beauty's fairest child of all the group
3397,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Of Eve's unnumbered daughters, who abide,"
3398,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Or have abode, amid these mingled scenes."
3399,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"'Twas now the season of her noonday prime,"
3400,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Wherein she might have gloried if she would;
3401,BEAUTY ADORNED.,But the calm spirit which within her moved
3402,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Would not allow like vanities to rise.
3403,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Amid the lucent streams of mellow light,"
3404,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Which showered its fullest softness down on her,"
3405,BEAUTY ADORNED.,She stood--the beauteous maiden stood adored.
3406,BEAUTY ADORNED.,To see the gay perfection of her charms
3407,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Came wonder, peering forth; for he was lured"
3408,BEAUTY ADORNED.,With an intense delight to see a form
3409,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Clothed and adorned in such simplicity,"
3410,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Yet of unbounded elegance the while.
3411,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And far her fame had spread throughout the land.
3412,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Then soon from town and city numbers came,"
3413,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And from the quiet of their country homes,"
3414,BEAUTY ADORNED.,To cast their admiration at her feet;
3415,BEAUTY ADORNED.,For they had longed with their own eyes to see
3416,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her nymph-like form, and with their ears to hear"
3417,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"The music of her voice, and for themselves"
3418,BEAUTY ADORNED.,To read the language of her sparkling eye.
3419,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And many sought to win her as his own;
3420,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And to her shrine they brought rich offerings all,"
3421,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Each of the best and choicest of his stores.
3422,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And she beheld the riches which they brought,"
3423,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And heard the words of flattery which they bore,"
3424,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And marked the attentions lavished unto her,"
3425,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"But gave no heed to these, and deemed them all"
3426,BEAUTY ADORNED.,As idle and deluding vanities;
3427,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"For she beheld they sought the outward charms,"
3428,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"But minded not the treasures of the heart,"
3429,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Which are more precious than all other gain.
3430,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"So she did make, in firm yet kindly words,"
3431,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"An answer of refusal unto each,"
3432,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And held her from them in discreet reserve.
3433,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Erewhile another came, whom she beheld"
3434,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Sought more the secret worth than outward charms,"
3435,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And that he was in every purpose fair,"
3436,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And just and honorable, true and good,"
3437,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And that he brought no dazzling gifts to tempt
3438,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her with, that he might win her heart and hand."
3439,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And he in silent heed did note awhile
3440,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her nature and the ordering of her ways,"
3441,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And was much pleased to see them ordered well,"
3442,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And that the beauties of a virtuous mind
3443,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Were not extinguished by her outward charms,"
3444,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"As is, alas! the case too frequently."
3445,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Then from this admiration yet awhile
3446,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Did rise a love fair and reciprocal;
3447,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And in due course he sought her heart and hand,"
3448,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And she did yield them gladly unto him.
3449,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Thus they were in the bonds of wedlock joined,"
3450,BEAUTY ADORNED.,To mete the measure of their lives in one;
3451,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And in their home was harmony and peace,"
3452,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And in all things they were together true.
3453,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Time stood, and from his hand the hours, and days,"
3454,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Anon, and years dealt listlessly away;"
3455,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And, ere a while, she merged on ripened years,"
3456,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"With many honors rising from her path,"
3457,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Had sons and daughters, and had trained them well,"
3458,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"As it is fitting that a mother should,"
3459,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And had her mission filled in every way.
3460,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Then was her act concluded, and she left"
3461,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"The scenes of life and all the changes there,"
3462,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And came in gladness to a higher realm,"
3463,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And there abode together with the just,"
3464,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Who to their Maker give the glory due,"
3465,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And who in the affairs of life forget
3466,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Not to ascribe Him praise and worship most.
3467,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"The curtain fell, and, lo! a clear, strange voice"
3468,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Broke from the hidden scenes, declaring thus,"
3469,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And with the words a thrilling power was borne,"
3470,BEAUTY ADORNED.,That every passer in amazement turned:
3471,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"""Blessed are they who walk in virtue's way!"
3472,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"A maid of virtue is a precious gem,"
3473,BEAUTY ADORNED.,More priceless than the pearl of many seas.
3474,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her mind is pure as snow which Winter breathes,"
3475,BEAUTY ADORNED.,White and unspotted with the stains of time.
3476,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her memory is like the gorgeous sun,"
3477,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Which hath gone down behind the distant hills,"
3478,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Yet sends a stream of glory from its seat
3479,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Upon the firmament where once it rode,"
3480,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Diffusing there a sweet and golden light.
3481,BEAUTY ADORNED.,So shall the recollections of her shine
3482,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Upon the hearts of men, who in her time"
3483,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Did know her worth and the fair fruits thereof."""
3484,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Scarce had these words been uttered, when again."
3485,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"The curtain rose, which hid the stage of life;"
3486,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And, lo! I saw the like fair scenes were there,"
3487,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Which in the former act had been displayed;
3488,BEAUTY ADORNED.,But she who stood the foremost in the act
3489,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Was other maiden, yet as sweet and fair."
3490,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her every limb of beauty was adorned,"
3491,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And in her face did winning brightness shine.
3492,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"A manner gay she had, which unto men"
3493,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Was sweet and charmful, that whoe'er beheld"
3494,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Was at the sight of thrilling rapture filled;
3495,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And all her mirth was gay and ever full,"
3496,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And all her laughter fraught of dancing fun.
3497,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"A roguish eye she had, from which went forth"
3498,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Glances askance, to plunder, as they wot,"
3499,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"From simple hearts, which could not turn away"
3500,BEAUTY ADORNED.,The wily darts which she cast unto them.
3501,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her cheek was bright, and of a rosy hue,"
3502,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And wondrous was the fashion of her lips,"
3503,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And they did seem to speak soft tales of love
3504,BEAUTY ADORNED.,In every motion which pervaded them.
3505,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Which turned to rapture all who gazed thereon,"
3506,BEAUTY ADORNED.,So deep the passion which they pouted forth.
3507,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her locks were golden, and with braids entwined"
3508,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"In such a magic manner, and they waved"
3509,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Upon the breezes in a sportive way.
3510,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her raiment was of Fashion's last design,"
3511,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And so arranged to shew her perfect form
3512,BEAUTY ADORNED.,In all the fine proportions it displayed.
3513,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her soft white arms were bared unto the view,"
3514,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And scarce she needed other charm to hold,"
3515,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Than did the vesture sideward drawn reveal
3516,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Of beauty lying in a tranquil sleep
3517,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Upon a pillow of the sweetest form.
3518,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And she was proud of graces like to these;
3519,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And sadly well she did her beauty know.
3520,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Forth from the ranks of town and city came
3521,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"A host of pert admirers, to gaze"
3522,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Upon her sweet and all-bewitching charms,"
3523,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And cull a little frolic from her hand.
3524,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And she was free and open unto all,"
3525,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And held to each full gaiety and wit,"
3526,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And on her manner kept no check at all,"
3527,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And strove to seem more pleasing every hour,"
3528,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And loved the admiration which they gave.
3529,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Time stood, and from his hand the hours, and days,"
3530,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Anon, and years dealt listlessly away;"
3531,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And one by one her charms were seen to go;
3532,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"For every year, as it sped on its course,"
3533,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Plucked from the flower of purity a leaf,"
3534,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And from her beauty took the brightest gem,"
3535,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Until all virtue had been torn away,"
3536,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And beauty shorn of every single germ.
3537,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Thus was her ruin sealed, and day by day"
3538,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"She sank into more hopeless depths of sin,"
3539,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And was more hardened unto evil ways.
3540,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her form grew haggard and uncouth to see,"
3541,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And in her eye a dark defiance frowned.
3542,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Her soul turned black unto its very core,"
3543,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And was polluted as a mountain stream
3544,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Drugged with the fluid from a bloody war.
3545,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Her brow was stamped with hatred and revenge.
3546,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Woe and distraction, from these loathsome fonts,"
3547,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Fierce as hell-torrents, burst upon her path;"
3548,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And she did spurn repentance.  And I saw
3549,BEAUTY ADORNED.,The Evil One from depths of darkness come;
3550,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And in her way he set a fearful pit,"
3551,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And death appeared the entrance thereunto.
3552,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Then it was opened wider in her way;
3553,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"I heard an awful shriek, and, lo! beheld"
3554,BEAUTY ADORNED.,That she was swallowed in its boundless depths.
3555,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Thus was the act concluded, and again"
3556,BEAUTY ADORNED.,The curtain fell upon the stage of life;
3557,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And all who saw it trembled at the scene,"
3558,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And deathlike was the calm which stood around,"
3559,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And every breath was held for very fear.
3560,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Then the same voice was heard again which spoke
3561,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Such words of wisdom in the former scene.
3562,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And now the curtain was again withdrawn,"
3563,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And every form had vanished from the view,"
3564,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Save he who spake and hoary-headed Time;
3565,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And Time still stood and dealt the hours away.
3566,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And over all a mighty change had come;
3567,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Old things had gone, and others held their place;"
3568,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And he who was the speaker stood upright,"
3569,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And was adorned with raiment pure and white.
3570,BEAUTY ADORNED.,He stood surrounded by a dazzling light;
3571,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"More bright his presence was than gorgeous suns,"
3572,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Whereas he had an eye of wondrous power.
3573,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Imposing was his presence to behold,"
3574,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And these the words in stirring force he spake:
3575,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"""Pause, all ye young, ye thoughtless ones who run"
3576,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"In wild delight among the gay-borne paths,"
3577,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Which pleasure spreads enticingly around.
3578,BEAUTY ADORNED.,O youth deluded! dwell not in the thought
3579,BEAUTY ADORNED.,That they shall prosper for eternal years.
3580,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Truth is profound, and this more deep than all--"
3581,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"That beauty is but like a passing charm,"
3582,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And youth a landmark by the way of Time--
3583,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"A stage which soon his chariot rolls by,"
3584,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And leaves in dark obscurity behind,"
3585,BEAUTY ADORNED.,As it drives on to the eternal gates.
3586,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Then pause, and be not blinded by the show"
3587,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Of such an idle vanity.  Ye know
3588,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"An end awaits the sojourn here below."""
3589,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"These were his warnings.  Then methought I saw,"
3590,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"One on each hand, the two eternal gates;"
3591,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Whereto he turned, and, opening one, disclosed"
3592,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Realms of most wondrous beauty, and therein"
3593,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Were beings of a loveliness untold;
3594,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And all around appeared to give them joy,"
3595,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And in their midst dwelt unity and love,"
3596,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And they were clothed in raiments purely grand,"
3597,BEAUTY ADORNED.,With diadems of honor on their brows;
3598,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And sweet the music was which hovered round,"
3599,BEAUTY ADORNED.,And this appeared an everlasting feast.
3600,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Then he did close, without a word or sign,"
3601,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"This gate, and to the other mutely went,"
3602,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And, opening which, disclosed to the view"
3603,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Such ghastly scenes of torture, and therein"
3604,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Were creatures seething in eternal flame;
3605,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And loathsome was their presence to behold,"
3606,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And woe and agony were ever in their midst,"
3607,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And bitter were the strifes, in which they bore"
3608,BEAUTY ADORNED.,An angry hate to other wretches doomed
3609,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Alike with them to welter in its toil.
3610,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"These were the scenes.  Then, mutely as before,"
3611,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"He closed the gate, and vanished from the view."
3612,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And every gazer stood in wonder bound,"
3613,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Until upon the distance came the sound
3614,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Of chariots and horsemen; and, erewhile,"
3615,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Came rolling up the chariots of Time
3616,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"In quick succession; and I saw therein,"
3617,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Beings conveyed to the eternal gates;
3618,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Some unto that o'er which these golden words
3619,BEAUTY ADORNED.,Were traced in figures ever bold and bright:
3620,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"""Enter, ye blessed, to eternal joy;"""
3621,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"And others unto that o'er which I saw,"
3622,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"""Enter, ye cursed, to eternal doom."""
3623,BEAUTY ADORNED.,"Then fell the curtain on the scene, and, lo!"

4635,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Mark well, and do not pass in heedless haste,"
4636,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Nor all your time in needless folly waste;
4637,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"But, if with you a solemn thought doth dwell,"
4638,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Pray lend it here, and think it may be well"
4639,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Awhile to set aside the world's stern care,"
4640,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"And for a true, though passing, glance prepare"
4641,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Upon a theme which is too often hid
4642,THE AIM OF LIFE.,By pleasure's streams and vanities which thread
4643,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"The onward path which through the wide world wends,"

4647,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Where man appears, and in a season dies,"
4648,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Forgotten soon in mouldering dust he lies,"
4649,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"That he has strayed from the good purpose far,"
4650,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"That all his joys are vain, and such as mar"
4651,THE AIM OF LIFE.,His hope to an unmitigated peace.
4652,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"The bonds grow stronger, and his lusts increase"
4653,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"The while his chances are for ever lost,"
4654,THE AIM OF LIFE.,And he is now before the tempest toss'd.
4655,THE AIM OF LIFE.,A thoughtful mind in question thus may dwell;
4656,THE AIM OF LIFE.,And who is found an answer fit to tell?
4657,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"When man was formed, what aim was held in view"
4658,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"By the Creator, ever just and true,"
4659,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Who all things made but for a purpose wise?
4660,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Behold, his work an ample proof supplies"

4662,THE AIM OF LIFE.,And all creation to him subject laid.
4663,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Discretion lent to shew the ill from good,"
4664,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Portrayed in him the Maker's image stood;
4665,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Nor was it meant that he should time employ
4666,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"In foolish pleasure and licentious joy,"
4667,THE AIM OF LIFE.,Less far that self should be his only theme;
4668,THE AIM OF LIFE.,A fallen state soon had he to redeem.
4669,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"More thus the purpose, and the Maker's law"
4670,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Held it as good, and man the duty saw--"
4671,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"That God, the Maker, should true worship have,"
4672,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"And reverence and love; and, as to prove"
4673,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Obeyance, it was held that he should love"
4674,THE AIM OF LIFE.,His neighbour as himself.  This from above
4675,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Bestowed, and from conditions free, save one,"
4676,THE AIM OF LIFE.,And which was sweet and pleasing to be done
4677,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"In the true spirit of a perfect life,"
4678,THE AIM OF LIFE.,"Where no fear came, or jealousy, or strife--"
4679,THE AIM OF LIFE.,No earthly thing should have the honor due

4698,THE PRIMROSE.,
4699,THE PRIMROSE.,"It sported with the breeze,"

4702,THE PRIMROSE.,With all its puny fun.
4703,THE PRIMROSE.,
4704,THE PRIMROSE.,"It flirted with the moon,"
4705,THE PRIMROSE.,And kissed the early dew;
