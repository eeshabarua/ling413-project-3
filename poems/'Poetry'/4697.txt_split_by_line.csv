32,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F."
33,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
34,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",DEAR TOM--Allow me to request you to introduce Mr. Peter Bell to the
35,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",respectable family of the Fudges. Although he may fall short of those
36,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",very considerable personages in the more active properties which
37,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","characterize the Rat and the Apostate, I suspect that even you, their"
38,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","historian, will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly"
39,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness.
40,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
41,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",You know Mr. Examiner Hunt; well--it was he who presented me to two of
42,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",the Mr. Bells. My intimacy with the younger Mr. Bell naturally sprung
43,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","from this introduction to his brothers. And in presenting him to you, I"
44,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is
45,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",considerably the dullest of the three.
46,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
47,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",There is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of
48,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","the Peter Bells, that if you know one Peter Bell, you know three Peter"
49,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","Bells; they are not one, but three; not three, but one. An awful"
50,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","mystery, which, after having caused torrents of blood, and having been"
51,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres, is at length"
52,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world,"
53,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",by the nature of Mr. Peter Bell.
54,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
55,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","Peter is a polyhedric Peter, or a Peter with many sides. He changes"
56,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","colours like a chameleon, and his coat like a snake. He is a Proteus of"
57,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","a Peter. He was at first sublime, pathetic, impressive, profound; then"
58,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",dull; then prosy and dull; and now dull--oh so very dull! it is an
59,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",ultra-legitimate dulness.
60,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
61,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",You will perceive that it is not necessary to consider Hell and the
62,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",Devil as supernatural machinery. The whole scene of my epic is in 'this
63,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","world which is'--so Peter informed us before his conversion to ""White"
64,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","Obi""--"
65,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.",
66,"TO THOMAS BROWN, ESQ., THE YOUNGER, H.F.","'The world of all of us, AND WHERE"
67,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'"
68,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",
69,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",Let me observe that I have spent six or seven days in composing this
70,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",sublime piece; the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of
71,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit, driving you mad,"
72,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","while it has retained its calmness and its splendour, and I have been"
73,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",fitting this its last phase 'to occupy a permanent station in the
74,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",literature of my country.'
75,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",
76,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","Your works, indeed, dear Tom, sell better; but mine are far superior."
77,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",The public is no judge; posterity sets all to rights.
78,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",
79,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","Allow me to observe that so much has been written of Peter Bell, that"
80,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","the present history can be considered only, like the Iliad, as a"
81,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","continuation of that series of cyclic poems, which have already been"
82,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","candidates for bestowing immortality upon, at the same time that they"
83,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","receive it from, his character and adventures. In this point of view I"
84,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a
85,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","conjunction; the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being,"
86,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","like the full stops at the end of the Iliad and Odyssey, a full stop of"
87,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",a very qualified import.
88,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",
89,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","Hoping that the immortality which you have given to the Fudges, you will"
90,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","receive from them; and in the firm expectation, that when London shall"
91,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",be an habitation of bitterns; when St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey
92,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","shall stand, shapeless and nameless ruins, in the midst of an unpeopled"
93,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",marsh; when the piers of Waterloo Bridge shall become the nuclei of
94,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","islets of reeds and osiers, and cast the jagged shadows of their broken"
95,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","arches on the solitary stream, some transatlantic commentator will be"
96,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of
97,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","criticism, the respective merits of the Bells and the Fudges, and their"
98,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'","historians. I remain, dear Tom, yours sincerely,"
99,"WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'",

112,PROLOGUE.,
113,PROLOGUE.,"Peter Bells, one, two and three,"
114,PROLOGUE.,O'er the wide world wandering be.--
115,PROLOGUE.,"First, the antenatal Peter,"
116,PROLOGUE.,"Wrapped in weeds of the same metre,"
117,PROLOGUE.,The so-long-predestined raiment                                 5
118,PROLOGUE.,Clothed in which to walk his way meant
119,PROLOGUE.,The second Peter; whose ambition
120,PROLOGUE.,"Is to link the proposition,"
121,PROLOGUE.,As the mean of two extremes--
122,PROLOGUE.,(This was learned from Aldric's themes)                         10
123,PROLOGUE.,Shielding from the guilt of schism
124,PROLOGUE.,The orthodoxal syllogism;
125,PROLOGUE.,The First Peter--he who was
126,PROLOGUE.,Like the shadow in the glass
127,PROLOGUE.,"Of the second, yet unripe,                                      15"
128,PROLOGUE.,His substantial antitype.--
129,PROLOGUE.,
130,PROLOGUE.,"Then came Peter Bell the Second,"
131,PROLOGUE.,Who henceforward must be reckoned
132,PROLOGUE.,"The body of a double soul,"
133,PROLOGUE.,And that portion of the whole                                   20
134,PROLOGUE.,Without which the rest would seem
135,PROLOGUE.,Ends of a disjointed dream.--
136,PROLOGUE.,And the Third is he who has
137,PROLOGUE.,O'er the grave been forced to pass
138,PROLOGUE.,"To the other side, which is,--                                  25"
139,PROLOGUE.,"Go and try else,--just like this."
140,PROLOGUE.,
141,PROLOGUE.,Peter Bell the First was Peter
142,PROLOGUE.,"Smugger, milder, softer, neater,"
143,PROLOGUE.,Like the soul before it is
144,PROLOGUE.,Born from THAT world into THIS.                                 30
145,PROLOGUE.,"The next Peter Bell was he,"
146,PROLOGUE.,"Predevote, like you and me,"
147,PROLOGUE.,To good or evil as may come;
148,PROLOGUE.,"His was the severer doom,--"
149,PROLOGUE.,"For he was an evil Cotter,                                      35"
150,PROLOGUE.,And a polygamic Potter.
151,PROLOGUE.,"And the last is Peter Bell,"
152,PROLOGUE.,"Damned since our first parents fell,"
153,PROLOGUE.,Damned eternally to Hell--
154,PROLOGUE.,Surely he deserves it well!                                     40

161,PART 1. DEATH.,1.
162,PART 1. DEATH.,"And Peter Bell, when he had been"
163,PART 1. DEATH.,"With fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed,"
164,PART 1. DEATH.,Grew serious--from his dress and mien
165,PART 1. DEATH.,'Twas very plainly to be seen
166,PART 1. DEATH.,Peter was quite reformed.                                       5
167,PART 1. DEATH.,
168,PART 1. DEATH.,2.
169,PART 1. DEATH.,"His eyes turned up, his mouth turned down;"
170,PART 1. DEATH.,His accent caught a nasal twang;
171,PART 1. DEATH.,He oiled his hair; there might be heard
172,PART 1. DEATH.,The grace of God in every word
173,PART 1. DEATH.,Which Peter said or sang.                                       10
174,PART 1. DEATH.,
175,PART 1. DEATH.,3.
176,PART 1. DEATH.,"But Peter now grew old, and had"
177,PART 1. DEATH.,An ill no doctor could unravel:
178,PART 1. DEATH.,His torments almost drove him mad;--
179,PART 1. DEATH.,Some said it was a fever bad--
180,PART 1. DEATH.,Some swore it was the gravel.                                   15
181,PART 1. DEATH.,
182,PART 1. DEATH.,4.
183,PART 1. DEATH.,"His holy friends then came about,"
184,PART 1. DEATH.,And with long preaching and persuasion
185,PART 1. DEATH.,"Convinced the patient that, without"
186,PART 1. DEATH.,"The smallest shadow of a doubt,"
187,PART 1. DEATH.,He was predestined to damnation.                                20
188,PART 1. DEATH.,
189,PART 1. DEATH.,5.
190,PART 1. DEATH.,They said--'Thy name is Peter Bell;
191,PART 1. DEATH.,Thy skin is of a brimstone hue;
192,PART 1. DEATH.,"Alive or dead--ay, sick or well--"
193,PART 1. DEATH.,The one God made to rhyme with hell;
194,PART 1. DEATH.,"The other, I think, rhymes with you.                            25"
195,PART 1. DEATH.,
196,PART 1. DEATH.,6.
197,PART 1. DEATH.,Then Peter set up such a yell!--
198,PART 1. DEATH.,"The nurse, who with some water gruel"
199,PART 1. DEATH.,"Was climbing up the stairs, as well"
200,PART 1. DEATH.,"As her old legs could climb them--fell,"
201,PART 1. DEATH.,And broke them both--the fall was cruel.                        30
202,PART 1. DEATH.,
203,PART 1. DEATH.,7.
204,PART 1. DEATH.,The Parson from the casement lept
205,PART 1. DEATH.,Into the lake of Windermere--
206,PART 1. DEATH.,And many an eel--though no adept
207,PART 1. DEATH.,In God's right reason for it--kept
208,PART 1. DEATH.,Gnawing his kidneys half a year.                                35
209,PART 1. DEATH.,
210,PART 1. DEATH.,8.
211,PART 1. DEATH.,And all the rest rushed through the door
212,PART 1. DEATH.,"And tumbled over one another,"
213,PART 1. DEATH.,And broke their skulls.--Upon the floor
214,PART 1. DEATH.,"Meanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,"
215,PART 1. DEATH.,And cursed his father and his mother;                           40
216,PART 1. DEATH.,
217,PART 1. DEATH.,9.
218,PART 1. DEATH.,"And raved of God, and sin, and death,"
219,PART 1. DEATH.,Blaspheming like an infidel;
220,PART 1. DEATH.,"And said, that with his clenched teeth"
221,PART 1. DEATH.,"He'd seize the earth from underneath,"
222,PART 1. DEATH.,And drag it with him down to hell.                              45
223,PART 1. DEATH.,
224,PART 1. DEATH.,10.
225,PART 1. DEATH.,"As he was speaking came a spasm,"
226,PART 1. DEATH.,And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder;
227,PART 1. DEATH.,Like one who sees a strange phantasm
228,PART 1. DEATH.,"He lay,--there was a silent chasm"
229,PART 1. DEATH.,Between his upper jaw and under.                                50
230,PART 1. DEATH.,
231,PART 1. DEATH.,11.
232,PART 1. DEATH.,And yellow death lay on his face;
233,PART 1. DEATH.,And a fixed smile that was not human
234,PART 1. DEATH.,"Told, as I understand the case,"
235,PART 1. DEATH.,That he was gone to the wrong place:--
236,PART 1. DEATH.,I heard all this from the old woman.                            55
237,PART 1. DEATH.,
238,PART 1. DEATH.,12.
239,PART 1. DEATH.,Then there came down from Langdale Pike
240,PART 1. DEATH.,"A cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;"
241,PART 1. DEATH.,It swept over the mountains like
242,PART 1. DEATH.,"An ocean,--and I heard it strike"
243,PART 1. DEATH.,The woods and crags of Grasmere vale.                           60
244,PART 1. DEATH.,
245,PART 1. DEATH.,13.
246,PART 1. DEATH.,And I saw the black storm come
247,PART 1. DEATH.,"Nearer, minute after minute;"
248,PART 1. DEATH.,Its thunder made the cataracts dumb;
249,PART 1. DEATH.,"With hiss, and clash, and hollow hum,"
250,PART 1. DEATH.,It neared as if the Devil was in it.                            65
251,PART 1. DEATH.,
252,PART 1. DEATH.,14.
253,PART 1. DEATH.,The Devil WAS in it:--he had bought
254,PART 1. DEATH.,Peter for half-a-crown; and when
255,PART 1. DEATH.,"The storm which bore him vanished, nought"
256,PART 1. DEATH.,That in the house that storm had caught
257,PART 1. DEATH.,Was ever seen again.                                            70
258,PART 1. DEATH.,
259,PART 1. DEATH.,15.
260,PART 1. DEATH.,The gaping neighbours came next day--
261,PART 1. DEATH.,They found all vanished from the shore:
262,PART 1. DEATH.,"The Bible, whence he used to pray,"
263,PART 1. DEATH.,Half scorched under a hen-coop lay;
264,PART 1. DEATH.,Smashed glass--and nothing more!                                75

271,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,1.
272,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"The Devil, I safely can aver,"
273,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Has neither hoof, nor tail, nor sting;"
274,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Nor is he, as some sages swear,"
275,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"A spirit, neither here nor there,"
276,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,In nothing--yet in everything.                                  80
277,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
278,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,2.
279,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,He is--what we are; for sometimes
280,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,The Devil is a gentleman;
281,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,At others a bard bartering rhymes
282,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,For sack; a statesman spinning crimes;
283,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"A swindler, living as he can;                                   85"
284,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
285,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,3.
286,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"A thief, who cometh in the night,"
287,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"With whole boots and net pantaloons,"
288,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Like some one whom it were not right
289,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,To mention;--or the luckless wight
290,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,From whom he steals nine silver spoons.                         90
291,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
292,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,4.
293,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,But in this case he did appear
294,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Like a slop-merchant from Wapping,"
295,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"And with smug face, and eye severe,"
296,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,On every side did perk and peer
297,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Till he saw Peter dead or napping.                              95
298,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
299,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,5.
300,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,He had on an upper Benjamin
301,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,(For he was of the driving schism)
302,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,In the which he wrapped his skin
303,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"From the storm he travelled in,"
304,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,For fear of rheumatism.                                         100
305,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
306,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,6.
307,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,He called the ghost out of the corse;--
308,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"It was exceedingly like Peter,--"
309,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Only its voice was hollow and hoarse--
310,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,It had a queerish look of course--
311,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Its dress too was a little neater.                              105
312,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
313,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,7.
314,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,The Devil knew not his name and lot;
315,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Peter knew not that he was Bell:
316,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Each had an upper stream of thought,"
317,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Which made all seem as it was not;
318,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Fitting itself to all things well.                              110
319,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,
320,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,8.
321,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Peter thought he had parents dear,"
322,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"Brothers, sisters, cousins, cronies,"
323,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,In the fens of Lincolnshire;

327,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,9.
328,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,Solemn phiz in his own village;

330,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,He'd clomb the orchard walls to pillage
331,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,"The produce of his neighbour's tillage,"
332,PART 2. THE DEVIL.,With marvellous pride and joy.                                  120

1010,PART 6. DAMNATION.,So in his Country's dying face
1011,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"He looked--and, lovely as she lay,                              590"
1012,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Seeking in vain his last embrace,"
1013,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Wailing her own abandoned case,"
1014,PART 6. DAMNATION.,With hardened sneer he turned away:
1015,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1016,PART 6. DAMNATION.,28.
1017,PART 6. DAMNATION.,And coolly to his own soul said;--
1018,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'Do you not think that we might make                            595
1019,PART 6. DAMNATION.,A poem on her when she's dead:--
1020,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Or, no--a thought is in my head--"

1024,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'My wife wants one.--Let who will bury

1026,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"My dearest Soul, will then make merry,"
1027,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"As the Prince Regent did with Sherry,--'"
1028,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'Ay--and at last desert me too.'
1029,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1030,PART 6. DAMNATION.,30.
1031,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"And so his Soul would not be gay,"
1032,PART 6. DAMNATION.,But moaned within him; like a fawn                              605
1033,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Moaning within a cave, it lay"
1034,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Wounded and wasting, day by day,"
1035,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Till all its life of life was gone.
1036,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1037,PART 6. DAMNATION.,31.
1038,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"As troubled skies stain waters clear,"
1039,PART 6. DAMNATION.,The storm in Peter's heart and mind                             610
1040,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Now made his verses dark and queer:
1041,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"They were the ghosts of what they were,"
1042,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.
1043,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1044,PART 6. DAMNATION.,32.
1045,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"For he now raved enormous folly,"

1047,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'Twould make George Colman melancholy

1050,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1051,PART 6. DAMNATION.,33.
1052,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuse"
1053,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"On Peter while he wrote for freedom,                            620"
1054,PART 6. DAMNATION.,So soon as in his song they spy
1055,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"The folly which soothes tyranny,"
1056,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Praise him, for those who feed 'em."
1057,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1058,PART 6. DAMNATION.,34.
1059,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"'He was a man, too great to scan;--"
1060,PART 6. DAMNATION.,A planet lost in truth's keen rays:--                           625
1061,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"His virtue, awful and prodigious;--"
1062,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"He was the most sublime, religious,"

1064,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1065,PART 6. DAMNATION.,35.
1066,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"As soon as he read that, cried Peter,"
1067,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'Eureka! I have found the way                                   630
1068,PART 6. DAMNATION.,To make a better thing of metre
1069,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Than e'er was made by living creature

1071,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1072,PART 6. DAMNATION.,36.
1073,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;--
1074,PART 6. DAMNATION.,In one of which he meekly said:                                 635
1075,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"'May Carnage and Slaughter,"
1076,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Thy niece and thy daughter,"

1085,PART 6. DAMNATION.,"Slash them at Manchester,"

1087,PART 6. DAMNATION.,Drench all with blood from Avon to Trent.
1088,PART 6. DAMNATION.,
1089,PART 6. DAMNATION.,38.
1090,PART 6. DAMNATION.,'Let thy body-guard yeomen

1106,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"A man of interest in both houses,"
1107,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"And said:--'For money or for love,"

1120,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Like one who rubs out an account,"
1121,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Smoothing away the unmeaning furrows:

1123,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,4.
1124,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"'It happens fortunately, dear Sir,"

1127,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,In our affairs;--like Oliver.

1129,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1130,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,5.
1131,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"These words exchanged, the news sent off"
1132,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"To Peter, home the Devil hied,--"
1133,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Took to his bed; he had no cough,                               675"
1134,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"No doctor,--meat and drink enough.--"
1135,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Yet that same night he died.
1136,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1137,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,6.
1138,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,The Devil's corpse was leaded down;
1139,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"His decent heirs enjoyed his pelf,"
1140,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Mourning-coaches, many a one,                                   680"
1141,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Followed his hearse along the town:--
1142,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Where was the Devil himself?
1143,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1144,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,7.
1145,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"When Peter heard of his promotion,"
1146,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,His eyes grew like two stars for bliss:
1147,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,There was a bow of sleek devotion                               685
1148,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Engendering in his back; each motion
1149,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Seemed a Lord's shoe to kiss.
1150,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1151,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,8.
1152,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"He hired a house, bought plate, and made"
1153,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"A genteel drive up to his door,"
1154,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"With sifted gravel neatly laid,--                               690"
1155,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"As if defying all who said,"
1156,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Peter was ever poor.
1157,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1158,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,9.
1159,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,But a disease soon struck into
1160,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,The very life and soul of Peter--
1161,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,He walked about--slept--had the hue                             695
1162,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Of health upon his cheeks--and few
1163,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Dug better--none a heartier eater.
1164,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1165,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,10.
1166,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,And yet a strange and horrid curse
1167,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Clung upon Peter, night and day;"
1168,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Month after month the thing grew worse,                         700"
1169,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,And deadlier than in this my verse
1170,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,I can find strength to say.
1171,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1172,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,11.
1173,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Peter was dull--he was at first
1174,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Dull--oh, so dull--so very dull!"
1175,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Whether he talked, wrote, or rehearsed--                        705"
1176,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Still with this dulness was he cursed--
1177,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Dull--beyond all conception--dull.
1178,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1179,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,12.
1180,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"No one could read his books--no mortal,"
1181,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"But a few natural friends, would hear him;"
1182,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,The parson came not near his portal;                            710
1183,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,His state was like that of the immortal
1184,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Described by Swift--no man could bear him.

1186,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,13.
1187,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"His sister, wife, and children yawned,"
1188,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"With a long, slow, and drear ennui,"

1190,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Their hopes of Heaven each would have pawned,"

1192,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1193,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,14.
1194,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"But in his verse, and in his prose,"
1195,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,The essence of his dulness was
1196,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Concentred and compressed so close,                             720"
1197,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,'Twould have made Guatimozin doze

1209,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"To do the work of his reviewing,"
1210,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"With adamantine nerves, grew tired;--                           730"
1211,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Gaping and torpid they retired,"
1212,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,To dream of what they should be doing.
1213,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1214,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,17.
1215,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"And worse and worse, the drowsy curse"
1216,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"Yawned in him, till it grew a pest--"
1217,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"A wide contagious atmosphere,                                   735"
1218,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Creeping like cold through all things near;
1219,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,A power to infect and to infest.
1220,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
1221,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,18.
1222,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,His servant-maids and dogs grew dull;

1224,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"The woods and lakes, so beautiful,                              740"
1225,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Of dim stupidity were full.
1226,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,All grew dull as Peter's self.

1228,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,19.
1229,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"The earth under his feet--the springs,"

1242,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,21.
1243,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,And every neighbouring cottager
1244,PART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Stupidly yawned upon the other:
