33,INTRODUCTION.,
34,INTRODUCTION.,"In this day when the world is fairly teeming with books,--good books,"
35,INTRODUCTION.,"books written with a motive, books inculcating morals, books teaching"
36,INTRODUCTION.,"lessons,--it seems almost a piece of presumption too great for endurance"
37,INTRODUCTION.,to foist another upon the market. There is scarcely room in the literary
38,INTRODUCTION.,world for amateurs and maiden efforts; the very worthiest are sometimes
39,INTRODUCTION.,"poorly repaid for their best efforts. Yet, another one is offered the"
40,INTRODUCTION.,"public, a maiden effort,--a little thing with absolutely nothing to"
41,INTRODUCTION.,"commend it, that seeks to do nothing more than amuse."
42,INTRODUCTION.,
43,INTRODUCTION.,"Many of these sketches and verses have appeared in print before, in"
44,INTRODUCTION.,newspapers and a magazine or two; many are seeing the light of day for
45,INTRODUCTION.,the first time. If perchance this collection of idle thoughts may serve
46,INTRODUCTION.,"to while away an hour or two, or lift for a brief space the load of care"
47,INTRODUCTION.,"from someone's mind, their purpose has been served--the author is"
48,INTRODUCTION.,satisfied.

117,PREFACE.,
118,PREFACE.,
119,PREFACE.,These fugitive pieces are launched upon the tide of public opinion to
120,PREFACE.,"sink or swim upon their merit. They will float for a while, but whether"
121,PREFACE.,they will reach the haven of popularity depends upon their enduring
122,PREFACE.,"qualities. Some will surely perish, many will reach some port, but time"
123,PREFACE.,alone will tell if any shall successfully breast the ocean of thought
124,PREFACE.,and plant its standard upon the summit of fame.
125,PREFACE.,
126,PREFACE.,"When one enters the domain of authorship, she places herself at the"
127,PREFACE.,mercy of critics. Were she as sure of being commended by the best and
128,PREFACE.,"most intelligent of her readers, as she is sure of being condemned by"
129,PREFACE.,"the worst and most ignorant, there would still be a thrill of pleasure"
130,PREFACE.,"in all criticism, for the satisfaction of having received the praise of"
131,PREFACE.,the first would compensate for the harshness of the latter. Just
132,PREFACE.,criticism is wholesome and never wounds the sensibilities of the true
133,PREFACE.,"author, for it saves her from the danger of an excess of pride which is"
134,PREFACE.,"the greatest foe to individual progress, while it spurs her on to"
135,PREFACE.,"loftier flights and nobler deeds. A poor writer is bad, but a poor"
136,PREFACE.,"critic is worse, therefore, unjust criticism should never ruffle the"
137,PREFACE.,temper of its victim. The author of these pages belongs to that type of
138,PREFACE.,"the ""brave new woman who scorns to sigh,"" but feels that she has"
139,PREFACE.,"something to say, and says it to the best of her ability, and leaves the"
140,PREFACE.,verdict in the hands of the public. She gives to the reader her best
141,PREFACE.,thoughts and leaves him to accept or reject as merit may manifest
142,PREFACE.,"itself. No author is under contract to please her readers at all times,"
143,PREFACE.,"nor can she hope to control the sentiments of all of them at any time,"
144,PREFACE.,"therefore, the obligation is reciprocal, for the fame she receives is"
145,PREFACE.,due to the pleasure she affords.
146,PREFACE.,
147,PREFACE.,"The author of these fugitive pieces is young, just on the threshold of"
148,PREFACE.,"life, and with the daring audacity of youth makes assertions and gives"
149,PREFACE.,"decisions which she may reverse as time mellows her opinions, and the"
150,PREFACE.,"realities of life force aside the theories of youth, and prosy facts"
151,PREFACE.,obscure the memory of that happy time when the heart overflowing
152,PREFACE.,with----
153,PREFACE.,
154,PREFACE.,"""The joy"
155,PREFACE.,"Of young ideas painted on the mind,"
156,PREFACE.,In the warm glowing colors Fancy spreads
157,PREFACE.,"On objects, not yet known, when all is new,"
158,PREFACE.,"And all is lovely."""
159,PREFACE.,
160,PREFACE.,There is much in this book that is good; much that is crude; some that
161,PREFACE.,is poor: but all give that assurance of something great and noble when
162,PREFACE.,"the bud of promise, now unfolding its petals in the morning glow of"
163,PREFACE.,"light, will have matured into that fuller growth of blossoming flower"
164,PREFACE.,ere the noonday sun passes its zenith. May the hope thus engendered by
165,PREFACE.,"this first attempt reach its fruition, and may the energy displayed by"
166,PREFACE.,one so young meet the reward it merits from an approving public.

183,I.,"which had pervaded it all day. For in the dawn of the perfect morn, it"
184,I.,"had arisen, stretched out its arms in glorious happiness to greet the"
185,I.,"Saviour and said its hallelujahs, merrily trilling out carols of bird,"
186,I.,"and organ and flower-song. But the evening had come, and rest."

192,I.,"Violets, you know, are my favorite flowers. Dear, little, human-faced"
193,I.,things! They seem always as if about to whisper a love-word; and then
194,I.,they signify that thought which passes always between you and me. The
195,I.,orange blossoms--you know their meaning; the little pinks are the
196,I.,flowers you love; the evergreen leaf is the symbol of the endurance of
197,I.,"our affection; the tube-roses I put in, because once when you kissed and"
198,I.,"pressed me close in your arms, I had a bunch of tube-roses on my bosom,"
199,I.,and the heavy fragrance of their crushed loveliness has always lived in
200,I.,"my memory. The violets and pinks are from a bunch I wore to-day, and"
201,I.,"when kneeling at the altar, during communion, did I sin, dear, when I"
202,I.,thought of you? The tube-roses and orange-blossoms I wore Friday night;
203,I.,"you always wished for a lock of my hair, so I'll tie these flowers with"
204,I.,"them--but there, it is not stable enough; let me wrap them with a bit of"
205,I.,"ribbon, pale blue, from that little dress I wore last winter to the"
206,I.,"dance, when we had such a long, sweet talk in that forgotten nook. You"
207,I.,"always loved that dress, it fell in such soft ruffles away from the"
208,I.,"throat and bosom,--you called me your little forget-me-not, that night."
209,I.,"I laid the flowers away for awhile in our favorite book,--Byron--just at"
210,I.,"the poem we loved best, and now I send them to you. Keep them always in"
211,I.,"remembrance of me, and if aught should occur to separate us, press these"
212,I.,"flowers to your lips, and I will be with you in spirit, permeating your"
213,I.,"heart with unutterable love and happiness."""

218,II.,"It is Easter again. As of old, the joyous bells clang out the glad news"
219,II.,"of the resurrection. The giddy, dancing sunbeams laugh riotously in"
220,II.,"field and street; birds carol their sweet twitterings everywhere, and"
221,II.,the heavy perfume of flowers scents the golden atmosphere with inspiring
222,II.,"fragrance. One long, golden sunbeam steals silently into the"
223,II.,"white-curtained window of a quiet room, and lay athwart a sleeping face."
224,II.,"Cold, pale, still, its fair, young face pressed against the satin-lined"
225,II.,"casket. Slender, white fingers, idle now, they that had never known"
226,II.,rest; locked softly over a bunch of violets; violets and tube-roses in
227,II.,"her soft, brown hair, violets in the bosom of her long, white gown;"
228,II.,"violets and tube-roses and orange-blossoms banked everywhere, until the"
229,II.,air was filled with the ascending souls of the human flowers. Some
230,II.,"whispered that a broken heart had ceased to flutter in that still, young"
231,II.,"form, and that it was a mercy for the soul to ascend on the slender"
232,II.,"sunbeam. To-day she kneels at the throne of heaven, where one year ago"

241,III.,"regal-looking woman lounging before the fire, he asked:"

243,III.,"""Wife, did you ever send me these?"""

336,THE WOMAN.,"fidgeted, pulled himself together with a violent jerk, and finally spoke"
337,THE WOMAN.,"his mind. Someone else did likewise, also someone else, then the women"
338,THE WOMAN.,"interposed, and jumped on the men, the men retaliated, a wordy war"
339,THE WOMAN.,"ensued, and the whole matter ended by nothing being decided, pro or"

342,THE WOMAN.,"won't say forming, it was there already. It was this, _Why should"
343,THE WOMAN.,well-salaried women marry?_ Take the average working-woman of to-day.
344,THE WOMAN.,"She works from five to ten hours a day, doing extra night work,"
345,THE WOMAN.,"sometimes, of course. Her work over, she goes home or to her"
346,THE WOMAN.,"boarding-house, as the case may be. Her meals are prepared for her, she"
347,THE WOMAN.,"has no household cares upon her shoulders, no troublesome dinners to"
348,THE WOMAN.,"prepare for a fault-finding husband, no fretful children to try her"
349,THE WOMAN.,"patience, no petty bread and meat economies to adjust. She has her"
350,THE WOMAN.,"cares, her money-troubles, her debts, and her scrimpings, it is true,"
351,THE WOMAN.,"but they only make her independent, instead of reducing her to a dead"
352,THE WOMAN.,"level of despair. Her day's work ends at the office, school, factory or"
353,THE WOMAN.,"store; the rest of the time is hers, undisturbed by the restless going"
354,THE WOMAN.,"to and fro of housewifely cares, and she can employ it in mental or"
355,THE WOMAN.,social diversions. She does not incessantly rely upon the whims of a
356,THE WOMAN.,cross man to take her to such amusements as she desires. In this
357,THE WOMAN.,nineteenth century she is free to go where she pleases--provided it be
358,THE WOMAN.,"in a moral atmosphere--without comment. Theatres, concerts, lectures,"
359,THE WOMAN.,"and the lighter amusements of social affairs among her associates, are"
360,THE WOMAN.,"open to her, and there she can go, see, and be seen, admire and be"
361,THE WOMAN.,"admired, enjoy and be enjoyed, without a single harrowing thought of the"
362,THE WOMAN.,baby's milk or the husband's coffee.
363,THE WOMAN.,
364,THE WOMAN.,"Her earnings are her own, indisputably, unreservedly, undividedly. She"
365,THE WOMAN.,"knows to a certainty just how much she can spend, how well she can"
366,THE WOMAN.,"dress, how far her earnings will go. If there is a dress, a book, a bit"
367,THE WOMAN.,"of music, a bunch of flowers, or a bit of furniture that she wants, she"
368,THE WOMAN.,"can get it, and there is no need of asking anyone's advice, or gently"
369,THE WOMAN.,"hinting to John that Mrs. So and So has a lovely new hat, and there is"
370,THE WOMAN.,one ever so much prettier and cheaper down at Thus & Co.'s. To an
371,THE WOMAN.,independent spirit there is a certain sense of humiliation and wounded
372,THE WOMAN.,"pride in asking for money, be it five cents or five hundred dollars. The"
373,THE WOMAN.,working woman knows no such pang; she has but to question her account
374,THE WOMAN.,"and all is over. In the summer she takes her savings of the winter,"
375,THE WOMAN.,"packs her trunk and takes a trip more or less extensive, and there is"
376,THE WOMAN.,"none to say her nay,--nothing to bother her save the accumulation of her"
377,THE WOMAN.,"own baggage. There is an independent, happy, free-and-easy swing about"
378,THE WOMAN.,the motion of her life. Her mind is constantly being broadened by
379,THE WOMAN.,contact with the world in its working clothes; in her leisure moments by
380,THE WOMAN.,the better thoughts of dead and living men which she meets in her
381,THE WOMAN.,"applications to books and periodicals; in her vacations, by her studies"
382,THE WOMAN.,"of nature, or it may be other communities than her own. The freedom"
383,THE WOMAN.,"which she enjoys she does not trespass upon, for if she did not learn at"
384,THE WOMAN.,"school she has acquired since habits of strong self-reliance,"
385,THE WOMAN.,"self-support, earnest thinking, deep discriminations, and firmly"
386,THE WOMAN.,believes that the most perfect liberty is that state in which humanity
387,THE WOMAN.,"conforms itself to and obeys strictly, without deviation, those laws"
388,THE WOMAN.,which are best fitted for their mutual self-advancement.
389,THE WOMAN.,
390,THE WOMAN.,And so your independent working woman of to day comes as near being
391,THE WOMAN.,ideal in her equable self poise as can be imagined. So why should she
392,THE WOMAN.,"hasten to give this liberty up in exchange for a serfdom, sweet"
393,THE WOMAN.,"sometimes, it is true, but which too often becomes galling and"
394,THE WOMAN.,unendurable.
395,THE WOMAN.,
396,THE WOMAN.,"It is not marriage that I decry, for I don't think any really sane"
397,THE WOMAN.,"person would do this, but it is this wholesale marrying of girls in"
398,THE WOMAN.,"their teens, this rushing into an unknown plane of life to avoid work."
399,THE WOMAN.,Avoid work! What housewife dares call a moment her own?
400,THE WOMAN.,
401,THE WOMAN.,"Marriages might be made in Heaven, but too often they are consummated"
402,THE WOMAN.,"right here on earth, based on a desire to possess the physical"
403,THE WOMAN.,"attractions of the woman by the man, pretty much as a child desires a"
404,THE WOMAN.,"toy, and an innate love of man, a wild desire not to be ridiculed by the"
405,THE WOMAN.,"foolish as an ""old maid,"" and a certain delicate shrinking from the work"
406,THE WOMAN.,of the world--laziness is a good name for it--by the woman. The
407,THE WOMAN.,"attraction of mind to mind, the ability of one to compliment the lights"
408,THE WOMAN.,"and shadows in the other, the capacity of either to fulfil the duties of"
409,THE WOMAN.,wife or husband--these do not enter into the contract. That is why we
410,THE WOMAN.,have divorce courts.
411,THE WOMAN.,
412,THE WOMAN.,"And so our independent woman in every year of her full, rich,"
413,THE WOMAN.,"well-rounded life, gaining fresh knowledge and experience, learning"
414,THE WOMAN.,"humanity, and particularly that portion of it which is the other gender,"
415,THE WOMAN.,"so well as to avoid clay-footed idols, and finally when she does consent"
416,THE WOMAN.,"to bear the yoke upon her shoulders, does so with perhaps less romance"
417,THE WOMAN.,"and glamor than her younger scoffing sisters, but with an assurance of"
418,THE WOMAN.,solid and more lasting happiness. Why should she have hastened this;
419,THE WOMAN.,was aught lost by the delay?
420,THE WOMAN.,
421,THE WOMAN.,"""They say"" that men don't admire this type of woman, that they prefer"
422,THE WOMAN.,"the soft, dainty, winning, mindless creature who cuddles into men's"
423,THE WOMAN.,"arms, agrees to everything they say, and looks upon them as a race of"
424,THE WOMAN.,gods turned loose upon this earth for the edification of womankind.
425,THE WOMAN.,"Well, may be so, but there is one thing positive, they certainly respect"
426,THE WOMAN.,"the independent one, and admire her, too, even if it is at a distance,"
427,THE WOMAN.,"and that in itself is something. As to the other part, no matter how"
428,THE WOMAN.,"sensible a woman is on other questions, when she falls in love she is"
429,THE WOMAN.,fool enough to believe her adored one a veritable Solomon. Cuddling?
430,THE WOMAN.,"Well, she may preside over conventions, brandish her umbrella at board"
431,THE WOMAN.,"meetings, tramp the streets soliciting subscriptions, wield the blue"
432,THE WOMAN.,"pencil in an editorial sanctum, hammer a type-writer, smear her nose"
433,THE WOMAN.,"with ink from a galley full of pied type, lead infant ideas through the"
434,THE WOMAN.,"tortuous mazes of c-a-t and r-a-t, plead at the bar, or wield the"
435,THE WOMAN.,"scalpel in a dissecting room, yet when the right moment comes, she will"
436,THE WOMAN.,"sink as gracefully into his manly embrace, throw her arms as lovingly"
437,THE WOMAN.,"around his neck, and cuddle as warmly and sweetly to his bosom as her"

445,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
446,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
447,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,There was a terrible noise in the school-yard at intermission; peeping
448,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"out the windows the boys could be seen huddled in an immense bunch, in"
449,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"the middle of the yard. It looked like a fight, a mob, a"
450,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"knock-down,--anything, so we rushed out to the door hastily, fearfully,"
451,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"ready to scold, punish, console, frown, bind up broken heads or drag"
452,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,wounded forms from the melee as the case might be. Nearly every boy in
453,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"the school was in that seething, swarming mass, and those who weren't"
454,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"were standing around on the edges, screaming and throwing up their hats"
455,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"in hilarious excitement. It was a mob, a fearful mob, but a mob"
456,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,apparently with a vigorous and well-defined purpose. It was a mob that
457,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"screamed and howled, and kicked, and yelled, and shouted, and perspired,"
458,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"and squirmed, and wriggled, and pushed, and threatened, and poured"
459,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,itself all seemingly upon some central object. It was a mob that had an
460,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"aim, that was determined to accomplish that aim, even though the whole"
461,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"azure expanse of sky fell upon them. It was a mob with set muscles,"
462,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"straining like whip-cords, eyes on that central object and with heads"
463,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"inward and sturdy legs outward, like prairie horses reversed in a"
464,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"battle. The cheerers and hat throwers on the outside were mirthful, but"
465,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"the mob was not; it howled, but howled without any cachinnation; it"
466,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"struggled for mastery. Some fell and were trampled over, some weaker"
467,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"ones were even tossed in the air, but the mob never deigned to trouble"
468,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"itself about such trivialities. It was an interesting, nervous whole,"
469,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,with divers parts of separate vitality.
470,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
471,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,In alarm I looked about for the principal. He was standing at a safe
472,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,distance with his hands in his pockets watching the seething mass with a
473,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,broad smile. At sight of my perplexed expression some one was about to
474,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"venture an explanation, when there was a wild yell, a sudden vehement"
475,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"disintegration of the mass, a mighty rush and clutch at a dark object"
476,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,bobbing in the air--and the mist cleared from my intellect--as I
477,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,realized it all--football.
478,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
479,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,Did you ever stop to see the analogy between a game of football and the
480,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,interesting little game called life which we play every day? There is
481,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"one, far-fetched as it may seem, though, for that matter, life's game,"
482,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"being one of desperate chances and strategic moves, is analogous to"
483,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,anything.
484,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
485,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"But, if we could get out of ourselves and soar above the world, far"
486,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"enough to view the mass beneath in its daily struggles, and near enough"
487,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,the hearts of the people to feel the throbs beneath their boldly
488,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"carried exteriors, the whole would seem naught but such a maddening rush"
489,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"and senseless-looking crushing. ""We are but children of a larger growth"""
490,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"after all, and our ceaseless pursuing after the baubles of this earth"
491,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,are but the struggles for precedence in the business play-ground.
492,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
493,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,The football is money. See how the mass rushes after it! Everyone so
494,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,intent upon his pursuit until all else dwindles into a ridiculous
495,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"nonentity. The weaker ones go down in the mad pursuit, and are"
496,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"unmercifully trampled upon, but no matter, what is the difference if the"
497,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,foremost win the coveted prize and carry it off. See the big boy in
498,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"front, he with iron grip, and determined, compressed lips? That boy is a"
499,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"type of the big, merciless man, the Gradgrind of the latter century. His"
500,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"face is set towards the ball, and even though he may crush a dozen small"
501,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"boys, he'll make his way through the mob and come out triumphant. And"
502,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"he'll be the victor longer than anyone else, in spite of the envy and"
503,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,fighting and pushing about him.
504,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
505,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"To an observer, alike unintelligent about the rules of a football game,"
506,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,and the conditions which govern the barter and exchange and fluctuations
507,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"of the world's money market, there is as much difference between the"
508,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,sight of a mass of boys on a play-ground losing their equilibrium over a
509,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,spheroid of rubber and a mass of men losing their coolness and temper
510,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,and mental and nervous balance on change as there is between a pine
511,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,sapling and a mighty forest king--merely a difference of age. The
512,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"mighty, seething, intensely concentrated mass in its emphatic tendency"
513,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"to one point is the same, in the utter disregard of mental and physical"
514,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,welfare. The momentary triumphs of transitory possessions impress a
515,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"casual looker-on with the same fearful idea--that the human race, after"
516,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"all, is savage to the core, and cultivates its savagery in an inflated"
517,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,happiness at own nearness to perfection.
518,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,
519,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"But the bell clangs sharply, the overheated, nervous, tingling boys"
520,TEN MINUTES' MUSING.,"fall into line, and the sudden transition from massing disorder to"

563,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Now I lay floating, arms outstretched, on an illimitable waste of calm"
564,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"tranquil waters. Far away as eye could reach, there was naught but the"
565,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"pale, white-flecked, green waters of this ocean of eternity, and above"
566,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"the tender blue sky arched down in perfect love of its mistress,"
567,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"the ocean. Sky and sea, sea and sky, blue, calm, infinite, perfect sea,"
568,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,heaving its womanly bosom to the passionate kisses of its ardent
569,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,sun-lover. Away into infinity stretched this perfectibility of love;
570,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"into eternity, I was drifting, alone, silent, yet burdened still with"
571,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,the remembrance of the sadness of the bells.
572,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
573,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Far away, they tolled out the incessant dirge, grown resignedly sweet"
574,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"now; so intense in its infinite peace, that a calm of love, beyond all"
575,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"human understanding and above all earthly passions, sank deep into my"
576,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"soul, and so permeated my whole being with rest and peace, that my lips"
577,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,smiled and my eyes drooped in access of fulsome joy. Into the
578,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"illimitable space of infinity we drifted, my soul and I, borne along"
579,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,only by the network of auburn hair that floated about me in the green
580,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,waters.
581,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
582,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,*       *       *       *       *
583,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
584,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"But now, a rude grasp from somewhere is laid upon me, pressing upon my"
585,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"face. Instantly the air grows gloomy, gray, and the ocean rocks"
586,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"menacingly, while the great bells grow harsh and strident, as they hint"
587,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,of a dark fate. I clasp my hands appealingly to the heavens; I moan and
588,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,struggle with the unknown grasp; then there is peace and the sweet
589,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,content of the infinite Nirvana.
590,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
591,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Then slowly, softly, the net of auburn hair begins to drag me down below"
592,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"the surface of the sea. Oh! the skies are so sweet, and now that the"
593,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"tender stars are looking upon us, how fair to stay and sway upon the"
594,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"breast of eternity! But the net is inexorable, and gently, slowly pulls"
595,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"me down. Now we sink straight, now we whirl in slow, eddying circles,"
596,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,spiral-like; while at each turn those bells ring out clanging now in
597,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"wild crescendo, then whispering dread secrets of the ocean's depths. Oh,"
598,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"ye mighty bells, tell me from your learned lore of the hopes of mankind!"
599,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,Tell me what fruit he beareth from his strivings and yearnings; know not
600,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"ye? Why ring ye now so joyful, so hopeful; then toll your dismal"
601,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,prophecies of o'er-cast skies?
602,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
603,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Years have passed, and now centuries, too, are swallowed in the gulf of"
604,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"eternity, yet the auburn net still whirls me in eddying circles, down,"
605,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,down to the very womb of time; to the innermost recesses of the mighty
606,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,ocean.
607,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
608,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,*       *       *       *       *
609,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
610,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"And now, peace, perfect, unconditioned, sublime peace, and rest, and"
611,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,silence. For to the great depths of the mighty ocean the solemn bells
612,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"cannot penetrate, and no sound, not even the beatings of one's own"
613,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"heart, is heard. In the heart of eternity there can be nothing to break"
614,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"the calm of frozen æons. In the great white hall I lay, silent,"
615,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"unexpectant, calm, and smiled in perfect content at the web of auburn"
616,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,hair which trailed across my couch. No passionate longing for life or
617,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"love, no doubting question of heaven or hell, no strife for carnal"
618,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"needs,--only rest, content, peace--happiness, perfect, whole, complete,"
619,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,sublime.
620,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
621,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"And thus passed ages and ages, æons and æons. The great earth there in"
622,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"the dim distance above the ocean has toiled wearily about the sun, until"
623,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"its mechanism was failing, and the warm ardor of the lover's eye was"
624,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"becoming pale and cold from age, while the air all about the fast"
625,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,dwindling sphere was heavy and thick with the sorrows and heartaches and
626,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,woes of the humans upon its face. Heavy with the screams and roar of
627,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,war; with the curses of the deceived of traitors; with the passionate
628,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,sighs of unlawful love; with the crushing unrest of blighted hopes.
629,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,Knowledge and contempt of all these things permeated even to the inmost
630,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"depths of time, as I lay in the halls of rest and smiled at the web"
631,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,floating through my white fingers.
632,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
633,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,*       *       *       *       *
634,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
635,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,But hark! discord begins. There is a vague fear which springs from an
636,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"unknown source and drifts into the depths of rest; fear, indefinable,"
637,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"unaccountable, unknowable, shuddering. Pain begins, for the heart"
638,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"springs into life, and fills the silence with the terror of its"
639,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"beatings, thick, knifing, frightful in its intense longing. Power of"
640,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"mind over soul, power of calm over fear avail nothing; suspense and"
641,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"misery, locked arm in arm, pervade æonic stillness, till all things else"
642,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"become subordinate, unnoticed."
643,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
644,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Centuries drift away, and the giddy, old reprobate--earth, dying a"
645,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"hideous, ghastly death, with but one solitary human to shudder in unison"
646,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"with its last throes, to bask in the last pale rays of a cold sun, to"
647,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"inhale the last breath of a metallic atmosphere; totters, reels, falls"
648,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"into space, and is no more. Peal out, ye brazen bells, peal out the"
649,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,requiem of the sinner! Roll your mournful tones into the ears of the
650,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"saddened angels, weeping with wing-covered eyes! Toll the requiem of the"
651,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"sinner, sinking swiftly, sobbingly into the depths of time's ocean."
652,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Down, down, until the great groans which arose from the domes and Ionic"
653,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"roofs about me told that the sad old earth sought rest in eternity,"
654,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,while the universe shrugged its shoulders over the loss of another star.
655,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
656,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"And now, the great invisible fear became apparent, tangible, for all the"
657,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"sins, the woes, the miseries, the dreads, the dismal achings and"
658,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"throbbings, the dreariness and gloom of the lost star came together and"
659,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,like a huge geni took form and hideous shape--octopus-like--which slowly
660,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"approached me, erstwhile happy--and hovered about my couch in fearful"
661,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,menace.
662,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
663,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,*       *       *       *       *

665,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"Oh, shining web of hair, burst loose your bonds and bid me move! Oh,"
666,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"time, cease not your calculations, but speed me on to deliverance! Oh,"
667,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"silence, vast, immense, infuse into your soul some sound other than the"
668,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"heavy throbbing of this fast disintegrating heart! Oh, pitiless stone"
669,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"arches, let fall your crushing weight upon this Stygian monster!"
670,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
671,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"I pray to time, to eternity, to the frozen æons of the past. Useless. I"
672,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"am seized, forced to open my cold lips; there is agony,--supreme, mortal"
673,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"agony of nerve tension, and wrenching of vitality. I struggle, scream,"
674,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"and clutching the monster with superhuman strength, fling him aside, and"
675,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"rise, bleeding, screaming--but triumphant, and keenly mortal in every"
676,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"vein, alive and throbbing with consciousness and pain."
677,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
678,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,*       *       *       *       *
679,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
680,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"No, it was not opium, nor night-mare, but chloroform, a dentist, three"
681,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,"obstinate molars, a pair of forceps, and a lively set of nerves."
682,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
683,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
684,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
685,IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS.,
686,TITEE.,TITEE.
687,TITEE.,
688,TITEE.,
689,TITEE.,It was cold that day; the great sharp north wind swept out Elysian
690,TITEE.,"Fields Street in blasts that made men shiver, and bent everything in its"
691,TITEE.,track. The skies hung lowering and gloomy; the usually quiet street was
692,TITEE.,"more than deserted, it was dismal."
693,TITEE.,
694,TITEE.,Titee leaned against one of the brown freight cars for protection
695,TITEE.,"against the shrill norther, and warmed his little chapped hands at a"
696,TITEE.,"blaze of chips and dry grass. ""May be it'll snow,"" he muttered, casting"
697,TITEE.,a glance at the sky that would have done credit to a practised seaman.
698,TITEE.,"""Then _won't_ I have fun! Ugh, but the wind blows!"""
699,TITEE.,
700,TITEE.,"It was Saturday, or Titee would have been in school--the big yellow"
701,TITEE.,"school on Marigny Street, where he went every day when its bell boomed"
702,TITEE.,"nine o'clock. Went with a run and a joyous whoop,--presumably to"
703,TITEE.,"imbibe knowledge, ostensibly to make his teacher's life a burden."
704,TITEE.,
705,TITEE.,"Idle, lazy, dirty, troublesome boy, she called him, to herself, as day"
706,TITEE.,"by day wore on, and Titee improved not, but let his whole class pass him"
707,TITEE.,on its way to a higher grade. A practical joke he relished infinitely
708,TITEE.,"more than a practical problem, and a good game at pinsticking was far"
709,TITEE.,"more entertaining than a language lesson. Moreover, he was always"
710,TITEE.,"hungry, and _would_ eat in school before the half-past ten intermission,"
711,TITEE.,thereby losing much good play-time for his voracious appetite.
712,TITEE.,
713,TITEE.,But there was nothing in natural history that Titee didn't know. He
714,TITEE.,could dissect a butterfly or a mosquito-hawk and describe their parts as
715,TITEE.,accurately as a spectacled student with a scalpel and microscope could
716,TITEE.,"talk about a cadaver. The entire Third District, with its swamps and"
717,TITEE.,"canals and commons and railroad sections, and its wondrous, crooked,"
718,TITEE.,tortuous streets was as an open book to Titee. There was not a nook or
719,TITEE.,corner that he did not know or could tell of. There was not a bit of
720,TITEE.,"gossip among the gamins, little Creole and Spanish fellows, with dark"
721,TITEE.,"skins and lovely eyes like Spaniels, that Titee could not tell of. He"
722,TITEE.,knew just exactly when it was time for crawfish to be plentiful down in
723,TITEE.,"the Claiborne and Marigny canals; just when a poor, breadless fellow"
724,TITEE.,might get a job in the big bone-yard and fertilizing factory out on the
725,TITEE.,"railroad track; and as for the levee, with its ships and schooners and"
726,TITEE.,"sailors--Oh, how he could revel among them! The wondrous ships, the"
727,TITEE.,"pretty little schooners, where the foreign-looking sailors lay on long"
728,TITEE.,"moon-lit nights, singing gay bar carols to the tinkle of a guitar and"
729,TITEE.,"mandolin. All these things, and more, could Titee tell of. He had been"
730,TITEE.,"down to the Gulf, and out on its treacherous waters through Eads Jetties"
731,TITEE.,"on a fishing smack, with some jolly, brown sailors, and could interest"
732,TITEE.,"the whole school-room in the ""talk lessons,"" if he chose."
733,TITEE.,
734,TITEE.,Titee shivered as the wind swept round the freight cars. There isn't
735,TITEE.,much warmth in a bit of a jersey coat.
736,TITEE.,
737,TITEE.,"""Wish 'twas summer,"" he murmured, casting another sailor's glance at the"
738,TITEE.,"sky. ""Don't believe I like snow, it's too wet and cold."" And, with a"
739,TITEE.,last parting caress at the little fire he had builded for a minute's
740,TITEE.,"warmth, he plunged his hands in his pockets, shut his teeth, and started"
741,TITEE.,manfully on his mission out the railroad track towards the swamps.
742,TITEE.,
743,TITEE.,"It was late when Titee came home, to such a home as it was, and he had"
744,TITEE.,"but illy performed his errand, so his mother beat him, and sent him to"
745,TITEE.,"bed supperless. A sharp strap stings in cold weather, and long walks in"
746,TITEE.,the teeth of a biting wind creates a keen appetite. But if Titee cried
747,TITEE.,"himself to sleep that night, he was up bright and early next morning,"
748,TITEE.,"and had been to early mass, devoutly kneeling on the cold floor,"
749,TITEE.,"blowing his fingers to keep them warm, and was home almost before the"
750,TITEE.,rest of the family was awake.
751,TITEE.,
752,TITEE.,There was evidently some great matter of business in this young man's
753,TITEE.,"mind, for he scarcely ate his breakfast, and had left the table, eagerly"
754,TITEE.,cramming the remainder of his meal in his pockets.
755,TITEE.,
756,TITEE.,"""I wonder what he's up to now?"" mused his mother as she watched his"
757,TITEE.,"little form sturdily trudging the track in the face of the wind, his"
758,TITEE.,"head, with the rimless cap thrust close on the shock of black hair, bent"
759,TITEE.,"low, his hands thrust deep in the bulging pockets."
760,TITEE.,
761,TITEE.,"""A new snake, perhaps,"" ventured the father; ""he's a queer child."""
762,TITEE.,
763,TITEE.,"But the next day Titee was late for school. It was something unusual,"
764,TITEE.,for he was always the first on hand to fix some plan of mechanism to
765,TITEE.,"make the teacher miserable. She looked reprovingly at him this morning,"
766,TITEE.,"when he came in during the arithmetic class, his hair all wind-blown,"
767,TITEE.,cheeks rosy from a hard fight with the sharp blasts. But he made up for
768,TITEE.,"his tardiness by his extreme goodness all day; just think, Titee didn't"
769,TITEE.,even eat in school. A something unparalleled in the entire history of
770,TITEE.,his school-life.
771,TITEE.,
772,TITEE.,"When the lunch-hour came, and all the yard was a scene of feast and fun,"
773,TITEE.,"one of the boys found him standing by one of the posts, disconsolately"
774,TITEE.,watching a ham sandwich as it rapidly disappeared down the throat of a
775,TITEE.,"sturdy, square-headed little fellow."
776,TITEE.,
777,TITEE.,"""Hello, Edgar,"" he said, ""What yer got fer lunch?"""
778,TITEE.,
779,TITEE.,"""Nothin',"" was the mournful reply."
780,TITEE.,
781,TITEE.,"""Ah, why don't yer stop eatin' in school fer a change? Yer don't ever"
782,TITEE.,"have nothin' to eat."""
783,TITEE.,
784,TITEE.,"""I didn't eat to-day,"" said Titee, blazing up."
785,TITEE.,
786,TITEE.,"""Yer did!"""
787,TITEE.,
788,TITEE.,"""I tell you I didn't!"" and Titee's hard little fist planted a"
789,TITEE.,punctuation mark on his comrade's eye.
790,TITEE.,
791,TITEE.,A fight in the school-yard! Poor Titee in disgrace again. But in spite
792,TITEE.,"of his battered appearance, a severe scolding from the principal, lines"
793,TITEE.,"to write, and a further punishment from his mother, Titee scarcely"
794,TITEE.,"remained for his dinner, but was off, down the railroad track, with his"
795,TITEE.,pockets partly stuffed with the remnants of his scanty meal.
796,TITEE.,
797,TITEE.,"And the next day Titee was tardy again, and lunchless, too, and the"
798,TITEE.,"next, and the next, until the teacher in despair sent a nicely printed"
799,TITEE.,"note to his mother about him, which might have done some good, had not"
800,TITEE.,Titee taken great pains to tear it up on his way home.
801,TITEE.,
802,TITEE.,"But one day it rained, whole bucketfuls of water, that poured in"
803,TITEE.,torrents from a miserable angry sky. Too wet a day for bits of boys to
804,TITEE.,"be trudging to school, so Titee's mother thought, so kept him home to"
805,TITEE.,"watch the weather through the window, fretting and fuming, like a"
806,TITEE.,"regular storm-cloud in miniature. As the day wore on, and the storm did"
807,TITEE.,"not abate, his mother had to keep a strong watch upon him, or he would"
808,TITEE.,have slipped away.
809,TITEE.,
810,TITEE.,"At last dinner came and went, and the gray soddenness of the skies"
811,TITEE.,deepened into the blackness of coming night. Someone called Titee to go
812,TITEE.,to bed--and Titee was nowhere to be found.
813,TITEE.,
814,TITEE.,"Under the beds, in corners and closets, through the yard, and in such"
815,TITEE.,impossible places as the soap-dish and the water-pitcher even; but he
816,TITEE.,had gone as completely as if he had been spirited away. It was of no use
817,TITEE.,"to call up the neighbors; he had never been near their houses, they"
818,TITEE.,"affirmed, so there was nothing to do but to go to the railroad track,"
819,TITEE.,where little Titee had been seen so often trudging in the shrill north
820,TITEE.,wind.
821,TITEE.,
822,TITEE.,"So with lantern and sticks, and his little yellow dog, the rescuing"
823,TITEE.,"party started out the track. The rain had ceased falling, but the wind"
824,TITEE.,"blew a tremendous gale, scurrying great, gray clouds over a fierce sky."
825,TITEE.,"It was not exactly dark, though in this part of the city, there was"
826,TITEE.,"neither gas nor electricity, and surely on such a night as this, neither"
827,TITEE.,moon nor stars dared show their faces in such a grayness of sky; but a
828,TITEE.,"sort of all-diffused luminosity was in the air, as though the sea of"
829,TITEE.,atmosphere was charged with an ethereal phosphorescence.
830,TITEE.,
831,TITEE.,"Search as they would, there were no signs of poor little Titee. The soft"
832,TITEE.,earth between the railroad ties crumbled beneath their feet without
833,TITEE.,showing any small tracks or foot-prints.
834,TITEE.,
835,TITEE.,"""Let us return,"" said the big brother, ""he can't be here anyway."""
836,TITEE.,
837,TITEE.,"""No, no,"" urged the mother, ""I feel that he is; let's go on."""
838,TITEE.,
839,TITEE.,"So on they went, slipping on the wet earth, stumbling over the loose"
840,TITEE.,"rocks, until a sudden wild yelp from Tiger brought them to a standstill."
841,TITEE.,"He had rushed ahead of them, and his voice could be heard in the"
842,TITEE.,"distance, howling piteously."
843,TITEE.,
844,TITEE.,With a fresh impetus the little muddy party hurried forward. Tiger's
845,TITEE.,"yelps could be heard plainer and plainer, mingled now with a muffled"
846,TITEE.,"wail, as of some one in pain."
847,TITEE.,
848,TITEE.,"And then, after awhile they found a pitiful little heap of wet and"
849,TITEE.,"sodden rags, lying at the foot of a mound of earth and stones thrown"
850,TITEE.,"upon the side of the track. It was little Titee with a broken leg, all"
851,TITEE.,"wet and miserable, and moaning."
852,TITEE.,
853,TITEE.,"They picked him up tenderly, and started to carry him home. But he cried"
854,TITEE.,"and clung to his mother, and begged not to go."
855,TITEE.,
856,TITEE.,"""He's got fever,"" wailed his mother."
857,TITEE.,
858,TITEE.,"""No, no, it's my old man. He's hungry, sobbed Titee, holding out a"
859,TITEE.,"little package. It was the remnants of his dinner, wet and rain washed."
860,TITEE.,
861,TITEE.,"""What old man?"" asked the big brother."
862,TITEE.,
863,TITEE.,"""My old man, oh, please, please don't go home until I see him, I'm not"
864,TITEE.,"hurting much, I can go."""
865,TITEE.,
866,TITEE.,"So yielding to his whim, they carried him further away, down the sides"
867,TITEE.,of the track up to an embankment or levee by the sides of the Marigny
868,TITEE.,"canal. Then Titee's brother, suddenly stopping, exclaimed:"
869,TITEE.,
870,TITEE.,"""Why, here's a cave, a regular Robinson Cruso affair."""
871,TITEE.,
872,TITEE.,"""It's my old man's cave,"" cried Titee; ""oh, please go in, maybe he's"
873,TITEE.,"dead."""
874,TITEE.,
875,TITEE.,"There can't be much ceremony in entering a cave, there is but one thing"
876,TITEE.,"to do, walk in. This they did, and holding high the lantern, beheld a"
877,TITEE.,"strange sight. On a bed of straw and paper in one corner lay a withered,"
878,TITEE.,"wizened, white-bearded old man, with wide eyes staring at the"
879,TITEE.,unaccustomed sight. In the corner lay a cow.
880,TITEE.,
881,TITEE.,"""It's my old man!"" cried Titee, joyfully. ""Oh, please, grandpa, I"
882,TITEE.,"couldn't get here to-day, it rained all morning, and when I ran away"
883,TITEE.,"this evening, I slipped down and broke something, and oh, grandpa, I'm"
884,TITEE.,"so tired and hurty, and I'm so afraid you're hungry."""
885,TITEE.,
886,TITEE.,So the secret of Titee's jaunts out the railroad was out. In one of his
887,TITEE.,"trips around the swamp-land, he had discovered the old man dying from"
888,TITEE.,"cold and hunger in the fields. Together they had found this cave, and"
889,TITEE.,Titee had gathered the straw and brush that scattered itself over the
890,TITEE.,ground and made the bed. A poor old cow turned adrift by an ungrateful
891,TITEE.,"master, had crept in and shared the damp dwelling. And thither Titee had"
892,TITEE.,"trudged twice a day, carrying his luncheon in the morning, and his"
893,TITEE.,"dinner in the evening, the sole support of a half-dead cripple."
894,TITEE.,
895,TITEE.,"""There's a crown in Heaven for that child,"" said the officer to whom the"
896,TITEE.,case was referred.

908,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"To the casual observer, the quaint, narrow, little alley that lies in"
909,ANARCHY ALLEY.,the heart of the city is no more than any other of the numerous
910,ANARCHY ALLEY.,divisions of streets in which New Orleans delights. But to the idle
911,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"wanderer, or he whose mission down its four squares of much trodden"
912,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"stones, is an aimless one,--whose eyes unforced to bend to the ground in"
913,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"thought of sordid ways and means, can peer at will into its quaint"
914,ANARCHY ALLEY.,corners. Exchange Alley presents all the phases of a Latinized portion
915,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"of America, a bit of Europe, perhaps, the restless, chafing, anarchistic"
916,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Europe of to-day, in the midst of the quieter democratic institution of"
917,ANARCHY ALLEY.,our republic.
918,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
919,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"It is Bohemia, pure and simple, Bohemia, in all its stages, from the"
920,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"beer saloon and the cheap book-store, to the cheaper cook shop and"
921,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"uncertain lodging house. There the great American institution, the"
922,ANARCHY ALLEY.,wondrous monarch whom the country supports--the tramp--basks in superior
923,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"comfort and contented, unmolested indolence. Idleness and labor, poverty"
924,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"and opulence, the honest, law-abiding workingman, and the reckless,"
925,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"restless anarchist, jostle side by side, and brush each other's elbows"
926,ANARCHY ALLEY.,in terms of equality as they do nowhere else.
927,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
928,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"On the busiest thoroughfares in the city, just in the busiest part,"
929,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"between two of the most crowded and conservative of cross-streets, lies"
930,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"this alley of Latinism. One might almost pass it hurriedly, avoiding the"
931,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"crowds that cluster at this section of the streets, but upon turning"
932,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"into a narrow section, stone-paved, the place is entered, appearing to"
933,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"end one square distant, seeming to bar itself from the larger buildings"
934,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"by an aimless sort of iron affair, part railing, part posts. There is a"
935,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"conservative book-store at the entrance on one side, and an even more"
936,ANARCHY ALLEY.,harmless clothing store on the other; then comes a saloon with many
937,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"blind doors, behind which are vistas of tables, crowded and crowded with"
938,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"men drinking beer out of ""globes,"" large, round, moony, common affairs."
939,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"There is a dingy, pension-claim office, with cripples and"
940,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"sorrowful-looking women in black, sitting about on rickety chairs."
941,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Somehow, there is always an impression with me that the mourning dress"
942,ANARCHY ALLEY.,and mournful looks are put on to impress the dispenser and adjuster. It
943,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"is wicked, but what can one do if impressions come?"
944,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
945,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"There are more little cuddies of places, dye-shops, tailors, and"
946,ANARCHY ALLEY.,nondescript corners that seem to have no possible mission on earth and
947,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"are sadly conscious of their aimlessness. Then the railing is reached,"
948,ANARCHY ALLEY.,and the alley instead of ending has merely given itself an angular twist
949,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"to the right, and extends three squares further, to a great, pale green"
950,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"dome, and stately entrance."
951,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
952,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"The calmly-thinking, quietly-laboring, cool and conservative world is"
953,ANARCHY ALLEY.,for the nonce left behind. With the first stepping across Customhouse
954,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"street, the place widens architecturally, and the atmosphere, too, seems"
955,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"impregnated with a sort of mental freedom, conducive to dangerous"
956,ANARCHY ALLEY.,theorizing and broody reflections on the inequality of the classes. The
957,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"sun shines in a strip in the centre, yellow and elusive, like gold;"
958,ANARCHY ALLEY.,someone is rattling a gay galop on a piano somewhere; there is a sound
959,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"of mens' voices in a heated discussion, a long whiff of pipe-smoke"
960,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"trails through the sunlight from the bar-room; the clink of glasses, the"
961,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"chink of silver, and the high treble of a woman's voice scolding a"
962,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"refractory child, mingle in incongruous melody."
963,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
964,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Two-story houses all along; the first floor divided into cuddies, here a"
965,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"paper store, displaying ten-cent novels of detective stories with"
966,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"impossible cuts, illustrating impossible situations of the plot;"
967,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"dye-shops, jewelers, tailors, tin-smiths, cook-shops, intelligence"
968,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"offices--many of these, and some newspaper offices. On the second floor,"
969,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"balconies, dingy, iron-railed, with sickly box-plants, and decrepit"
970,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"garments airing and being turned and tended by dishevelled, slip-shod"
971,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"women. Lodging-houses these, some of them, but one is forced to wonder"
972,ANARCHY ALLEY.,why do the tenants sun their clothes so often? The lines stretched from
973,ANARCHY ALLEY.,posts to posts seem always filled with airing garments. Is it economy?
974,ANARCHY ALLEY.,And do the owners of the faded vests and patched coats hide in dusky
975,ANARCHY ALLEY.,corners while their only garments are receiving the benefit of Old Sol's
976,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"cleansing rays? And are the women with the indiscriminate tresses, near"
977,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"relatives, or only the landladies? It would be something worth knowing"
978,ANARCHY ALLEY.,if one could.
979,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
980,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Plenty of saloons--great, gorgeous, gaudy places, with pianos and"
981,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"swift-footed waiters, tables and cards, and men, men, men. The famous"
982,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Three Brothers' Saloon occupies a position about midway the alley, and"
983,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"at its doors, the acme, the culminating point, the superlative degree of"
984,ANARCHY ALLEY.,unquietude and discontent is reached. It is the headquarters of nearly
985,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"all the great labor organizations in the city. Behind its doors,"
986,ANARCHY ALLEY.,swinging as easily between the street and the liquor-fumed halls as the
987,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"soul swings between right and wrong, the disturbed minds of the"
988,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"working-men become clouded, heated, and wrothily ready for deeds of"
989,ANARCHY ALLEY.,violence.
990,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
991,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"Outside on the pavements with hundreds of like-excited men, with angry"
992,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"discussions and bitter recitals of complaints, the seeds of discord sown"
993,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"some time since, perhaps, sprout afresh, blossom and bear fruits. Is"
994,ANARCHY ALLEY.,there a strike? Then special minions of the law are detailed to this
995,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"place, for violence and hatred of employers, insurrection and socialism"
996,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"find here ready followers. Impromptu mass meetings are common, and"
997,ANARCHY ALLEY.,law-breaking schemes find their cradle beneath its glittering lights. It
998,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"is always thronged within and without, a veritable nursery of riot and"
999,ANARCHY ALLEY.,disorder.
1000,ANARCHY ALLEY.,
1001,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"And oh, Bohemia, pipes, indolence and beer! The atmosphere is"
1002,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"impregnated with it, the dust sifts it into your clothes and hair, the"
1003,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"sunlight filters it through your brain, the stray snatches of music now"
1004,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"and then beat it rhythmically into your mind. There are some who work,"
1005,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"yes, and a few places outside of the saloons that seem to be animated"
1006,ANARCHY ALLEY.,with a business motive. There are even some who push their way briskly
1007,ANARCHY ALLEY.,"through the aimless bodies of men,--but then there must be an"

1074,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1075,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Like unto the barbaric splendor, the clashing of arms, the flashing of"
1076,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"jewels, so is this book, full of brightness that dazzles, yet does not"
1077,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"weary, of rich mosaic beauty of sensuous softness. Yet, with it all,"
1078,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,there is a singular lack of elevation of thought and expression;
1079,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"everything tends to degrade, to drag the mind to a worse than earthly"
1080,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"level. The crudity of the warriors, the minute description of the"
1081,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"battles, the leper, Hann; even the sensual love-scene of Salammbo and"
1082,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Matho, and the rites of Taint and Moloch. Possibly this is due to the"
1083,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"peculiar shortness and crispness of the sentences, and the painstaking"
1084,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,attention to details. Nothing is left for the imagination to complete.
1085,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"The slightest turn of the hand, the smallest bit of tapestry and"
1086,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"armor,--all, all is described until one's brain becomes weary with the"
1087,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,scintillating flash of minutia. Such careful attention wearies and
1088,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"disappoints, and sometimes, instead of photographing the scenes"
1089,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"indelibly upon the mental vision, there ensues only a confused mass of"
1090,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"armor and soldiers, plains and horses."
1091,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1092,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"But the description of action and movement are incomparable, resembling"
1093,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"somewhat, in the rush and flow of words, the style of Victor Hugo; the"
1094,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"breathless rush and fire, the restrained passion and fury of a"
1095,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,master-hand.
1096,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1097,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,Throughout the whole book this peculiarity is noticeable--there are no
1098,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"dissertations, no pauses for the author to express his opinions, no"
1099,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"stoppages to reflect,--we are rushed onward with almost breathless"
1100,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"haste, and many times are fain to pause and re-read a sentence, a"
1101,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"paragraph, sometimes a whole page. Like the unceasing motion of a column"
1102,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"of artillery in battle, like the roar and fury of the Carthaginian's"
1103,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"elephant, so is the torrent of Flanbert's eloquence--majestic, grand,"
1104,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"intense, with nobility, sensuous, but never sublime, never elevating,"
1105,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,never delicate.
1106,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1107,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"As an historian, Flanbert would have ranked high--at least in"
1108,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"impartiality. Not once in the whole volume does he allow his prejudices,"
1109,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"his opinions, his sentiments to crop out. We lose complete sight of the"
1110,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"author in his work. With marvellous fidelity he explains the movements,"
1111,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"the vices and the virtues of each party, and with Shakespearean tact, he"
1112,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"conceals his identity, so that we are troubled with none of that Byronic"
1113,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,vice of 'dipping one's pen into one's self.'
1114,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1115,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Still, for all the historian's impartiality, he is just a trifle"
1116,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"incorrect, here and there--the ancients mention no aqueduct in or near"
1117,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,Carthage. Hann was not crucified outside of Tunis. The incident of the
1118,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,Carthaginian women cutting off their tresses to furnish strings for bows
1119,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,and catapults is generally conceded to have occurred during the latter
1120,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,portion of the third Punic War. And still another difficulty presents
1121,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,itself--Salammbo was supposed to have been the only daughter of
1122,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Hamilcar; according to Flanbert she dies unmarried, or rather on her"
1123,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"wedding day, and yet historians tell us that after the death of the"
1124,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"elder Barca, Hannibal was brought up and watched over by Hamilcar's"
1125,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"son-in-law, Hasdrubal. Can it be possible that the crafty Numidian King,"
1126,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Nari Havas, is the intrepid, fearless and whole-souled Hasdrubal? Or is"
1127,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,it only another deviation from the beaten track of history? In a
1128,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"historical novel, however, and one so evidently arranged for dramatic"
1129,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"effects, such lapses from the truth only heighten the interest and"
1130,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,kindle the imagination to a brighter flame.
1131,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,
1132,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"The school of realism of which Zola, Tolstoi, De Maupassant, and others"
1133,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"of that ilk are followers, claims its descent from the author of"
1134,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Salammbo. Perhaps their claim is well-founded, perhaps not; we are"
1135,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"inclined to believe that it is, for every page in this novel is crowded"
1136,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"with details, often disgusting, which are generally left out in ordinary"
1137,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"works. The hideous deformity, the rottenness and repulsiveness of the"
1138,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,leper Hann is brought out in such vivid detail that we sicken and fain
1139,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"would turn aside in disgust. But go where one will, the ghastly,"
1140,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"quivering, wretched picture is always before us in all its filth and"
1141,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"splendid misery. The reeking horrors of the battle-fields, the"
1142,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,disgusting details of the army imprisoned in the defile of the
1143,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"battle-axe, the grimness of the sacrifices to the blood-thirsty god,"
1144,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Moloch, the wretchedness of Hamilcar's slaves are presented with every"
1145,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"ghastly detail, with every degrading trick of expression. Picture after"
1146,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,picture of misery and foulness arises and pursues us as the grim witches
1147,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"pursued the hapless Tam O'Shanter, clutching us in ghastly arms,"
1148,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,clinging to us with grim and ghoulish tenacity.

1150,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,Viewing the character through the genteel crystal of nineteenth century
1151,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"civilization, they are all barbarous, unnatural, intensified; but"
1152,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"considering the age in which they lived--the tendencies of that age, the"
1153,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"gods they worshipped, the practices in which they indulged,--they are"
1154,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"all true to life, perfect in the depiction of their natures. Spendius is"
1155,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"a true Greek, crafty, lying, deceitful, ungrateful. Hamilcar needs no"
1156,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"novelist to crystallize his character in words, he always remains the"
1157,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"same Hamilcar of history, so it is with Hann; but to Flanbert alone are"
1158,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,we indebted for the hideous realism of his external aspect. Matho is a
1159,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"dusky son of Libya,--fierce, passionate, resentful, unbridled in his"
1160,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"speech and action, swept by the hot breath of furious love as his native"
1161,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"sands are swept by the burning simoon. Salammbo, cold and strange"
1162,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"delving deep in the mysticism of the Carthaginian gods, living apart"
1163,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"from human passions in her intense love for the goddess, Tanit;"
1164,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Salammbo, in the earnest excess of her religious fervor, eagerly"
1165,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"accepting the mission given her by the puzzled Saracharabim; Salammbo,"
1166,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,twining the gloomy folds of the python about her perfumed limbs;
1167,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Salammbo, resisting, then yielding to the fierce love of Matho;"
1168,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"Salammbo, dying when her erstwhile lover expires; Salammbo, in all her"
1169,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"many phases reminds us of some early Christian martyr or saint, though"
1170,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,the sweet spirit of the Great Teacher is hidden in the punctual devotion
1171,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,to the mysterious rites of Tanit. She is an inexplicable mixture of the
1172,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"tropical exotic and the frigid snow-flower,--a rich and rare growth that"
1173,BY GUSTAVE FLANBERT.,"attracts and repulses, that interests and absorbs, that we"

1276,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1277,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1278,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"There is a merry jangle of bells in the air, an all-pervading sense of"
1279,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"jester's noise, and the flaunting vividness of royal colors; the streets"
1280,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"swarm with humanity,--humanity in all shapes, manners, forms,--laughing,"
1281,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"pushing, jostling, crowding, a mass of men and women and children, as"
1282,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,varied and as assorted in their several individual peculiarities as ever
1283,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,a crowd that gathered in one locality since the days of Babel.
1284,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1285,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"It is Carnival in New Orleans; a brilliant Tuesday in February, when the"
1286,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,very air effervesces an ozone intensely exhilarating--of a nature half
1287,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"spring, half winter--to make one long to cut capers. The buildings are a"
1288,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"blazing mass of royal purple and golden yellow, and national flags,"
1289,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,bunting and decorations that laugh in the glint of the Midas sun. The
1290,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"streets a crush of jesters and maskers, Jim Crows and clowns, ballet"
1291,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"girls and Mephistos, Indians and monkeys; of wild and sudden flashes of"
1292,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"music, of glittering pageants and comic ones, of befeathered and belled"
1293,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,horses. A madding dream of color and melody and fantasy gone wild in an
1294,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,effervescent bubble of beauty that shifts and changes and passes
1295,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,kaleidoscope-like before the bewildered eye.
1296,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1297,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,A bevy of bright-eyed girls and boys of that uncertainty of age that
1298,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"hovers between childhood and maturity, were moving down Canal Street"
1299,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,when there was a sudden jostle with another crowd meeting them. For a
1300,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"minute there was a deafening clamor of laughter, cracking of whips,"
1301,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"which all maskers carry, jingle and clatter of carnival bells, and the"
1302,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,masked and unmasked extricated themselves and moved from each other's
1303,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,paths. But in the confusion a tall Prince of Darkness had whispered to
1304,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"one of the girls in the unmasked crowd: ""You'd better come with us, Flo,"
1305,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"you're wasting time in that tame gang. Slip off, they'll never miss"
1306,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"you; we'll get you a rig, and show you what life is."""
1307,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1308,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"And so it happened that when a half hour passed, and the bright-eyed"
1309,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"bevy missed Flo and couldn't find her, wisely giving up the search at"
1310,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"last, that she, the quietest and most bashful of the lot, was being"
1311,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"initiated into the mysteries of ""what life is."""
1312,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1313,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,Down Bourbon Street and on Toulouse and St. Peter Streets there are
1314,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"quaint little old-world places, where one may be disguised effectually"
1315,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"for a tiny consideration. Thither guided by the shapely Mephisto, and"
1316,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"guarded by the team of jockeys and ballet girls, tripped Flo. Into one"
1317,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"of the lowest-ceiled, dingiest and most ancient-looking of these"
1318,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,disguise shops they stopped.
1319,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1320,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""A disguise for this demoiselle,"" announced Mephisto to the woman who"
1321,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"met them. She was small and wizened and old, with yellow, flabby jaws"
1322,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"and neck like the throat of an alligator, and straight, white hair that"
1323,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,stood from her head uncannily stiff.
1324,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1325,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""But the demoiselle wishes to appear a boy, _un petit garcon_?"" she"
1326,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"inquired, gazing eagerly at Flo's long, slender frame. Her voice was old"
1327,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"and thin, like the high quavering of an imperfect tuning fork, and her"
1328,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,eyes were sharp as talons in their grasping glance.
1329,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1330,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""Mademoiselle does not wish such a costume,"" gruffly responded Mephisto."
1331,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1332,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""_Ma foi_, there is no other,"" said the ancient, shrugging her"
1333,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"shoulders. ""But one is left now, mademoiselle would make a fine"
1334,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"troubadour."""
1335,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1336,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""Flo,"" said Mephisto, ""it's a dare-devil scheme, try it; no one will"
1337,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"ever know it but us, and we'll die before we tell. Besides, we must;"
1338,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"it's late, and you couldn't find your crowd."""
1339,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1340,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,And that was why you might have seen a Mephisto and a slender troubadour
1341,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"of lovely form, with mandolin flung across his shoulder, followed by a"
1342,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"bevy of jockeys and ballet girls, laughing and singing as they swept"
1343,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,down Rampart Street.
1344,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1345,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,When the flash and glare and brilliancy of Canal Street have palled upon
1346,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"the tired eye, and it is yet too soon to go home, and to such a prosaic"
1347,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"thing as dinner, and one still wishes for novelty, then it is wise to go"
1348,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,in the lower districts. Fantasy and fancy and grotesqueness in the
1349,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,costuming and behavior of the maskers run wild. Such dances and whoops
1350,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,and leaps as these hideous Indians and devils do indulge in; such wild
1351,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"curvetings and great walks. And in the open squares, where whole groups"
1352,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"do congregate, it is wonderfully amusing. Then, too, there is a ball in"
1353,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"every available hall, a delirious ball, where one may dance all day for"
1354,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"ten cents; dance and grow mad for joy, and never know who were your"
1355,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"companions, and be yourself unknown. And in the exhilaration of the day,"
1356,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"one walks miles and miles, and dances and curvets, and the fatigue is"
1357,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,never felt.
1358,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1359,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"In Washington Square, away down where Royal Street empties its stream"
1360,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"of children and men into the broad channel of Elysian Fields Avenue,"
1361,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,there was a perfect Indian dance. With a little imagination one might
1362,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,have willed away the vision of the surrounding houses and fancied one's
1363,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"self again in the forest, where the natives were holding a sacred riot."
1364,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"The square was filled with spectators, masked and unmasked. It was"
1365,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"amusing to watch these mimic Red-men, they seemed so fierce and earnest."
1366,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1367,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"Suddenly one chief touched another on the elbow. ""See that Mephisto and"
1368,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"troubadour over there?"" he whispered huskily."
1369,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1370,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""Yes, who are they?"""
1371,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1372,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""I don't know the devil,"" responded the other quietly, ""but I'd know"
1373,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"that other form anywhere. It's Leon, see? I know those white hands like"
1374,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,a woman's and that restless head. Ha!
1375,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1376,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""But there may be a mistake."""
1377,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1378,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"""No. I'd know that one anywhere; I feel it's him. I'll pay him now. Ah,"
1379,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"sweetheart, you've waited long, but you shall feast now!"" He was"
1380,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"caressing something long, and lithe, and glittering beneath his blanket."
1381,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1382,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,In a masked dance it is easy to give a death-blow between the shoulders.
1383,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"Two crowds meet and laugh and shout and mingle almost inextricably, and"
1384,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"if a shriek of pain should arise, it is not noticed in the din, and when"
1385,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"they part, if one should stagger and fall bleeding to the ground, who"
1386,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,can tell who has given the blow? There is naught but an unknown stiletto
1387,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"on the ground, the crowd has dispersed, and masks tell no tales anyway."
1388,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"There is murder, but by whom? for what? _Quien sabe?_"
1389,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,
1390,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"And that is how it happened on Carnival night, in the last mad moments"
1391,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"of Rex's reign, a broken-hearted woman sat gazing wide-eyed and mute at"
1392,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,a horrible something that lay across the bed. Outside the long sweet
1393,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"march music of many bands floated in in mockery, and the flash of"
1394,A CARNIVAL JANGLE.,"rockets and Bengal lights illumined the dead, white face of the girl"

1449,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"which steeps the senses, and benumbs the faculties of the lotus-eaters,"
1450,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"enveloped her brain, and she lay as one in a trance,--awake, yet"

1452,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,
1453,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"And there stole into her consciousness, words, thoughts, not of her own,"

1484,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"from the south whispered faintly through the tall, slender palms and"
1485,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"sent a thrill of joy through the frisky lambkins, who capered by the"
1486,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,sides of their graver dams. And there among the riches of the flock
1487,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"stood Laban, haughty, stern, yet withal a kindly gleam in the glance"
1488,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,which rested upon the group about him. Hoary the beard that rested upon
1489,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"his breast, but steady the hand that stretched in blessing. Leah, the"
1490,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"tender-eyed, the slighted, is there; and Rachel, young and beautiful and"
1491,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"blushing beneath the ardent gaze of her handsome lover. ""And Jacob loved"

1494,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,
1495,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,How different the next scene! Heaven's wrath burst loose upon a single
1496,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"community. Fire, the red-winged demon with brazen throat wide opened,"
1497,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,hangs his brooding wings upon an erstwhile happy city. Hades has climbed
1498,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"through the crater of Vesuvius, and leaps in fiendish waves along the"
1499,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"land. Few the souls escaping, and God have mercy upon those who stumble"
1500,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"through the blinding darkness, made more torturingly hideous by the"
1501,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"intermittent flashes of lurid light. And yet there come three, whom the"
1502,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"darkness seems not to deter, nor obstacles impede. Only a blind person,"
1503,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"accustomed to constant darkness, and familiarized with these streets"
1504,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"could walk that way. Nearer they come, a burst of flames thrown into the"
1505,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"inky firmament by impish hands, reveals Glaucus, supporting the"
1506,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"half-fainting Ione, following Nydia, frail, blind, flower-loving Nydia,"
1507,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,sacrificing life for her unloving beloved.

1509,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,And then the burning southern sun shone bright and golden o'er the

1514,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"unborn hang, as the sword of Damocles hung, upon the tiny thread of"
1515,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"destiny. Egypt herself, her splendid barbaric beauty acting like an"
1516,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"inspiration upon the craven followers, leads on, foremost in this fierce"
1517,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"struggle. Then, the tide turns, and overpowered, they fly before"
1518,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"disgrace and defeat. Antony is there, the traitor, dishonored, false to"
1519,THE MAIDEN'S DREAM.,"his country, yet true to his love; Antony, whom ambition could not lure"

1696,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,with such crumbs.
1697,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1698,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,We had five months of happiness. I tamed down beautifully in that
1699,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"time,--even consented to adopt the peerless Blanche as a model. I gave"
1700,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"up all my most ambitious plans and cherished schemes, because he"

1702,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"In fact, I became quiet, sedate, dignified, renounced too some of my"

1705,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"for all the suffering I've experienced, I'd be willing to go through it"
1706,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"all again just to go over those five months. Every day together, at"
1707,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,nights on the lake-shore listening to the soft lap of the waters as the
1708,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,silver sheen of the moon spread over the dainty curled waves; sometimes
1709,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,in a hammock swinging among the trees talking of love and reading
1710,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,poetry. Talk about Heaven! I just think there can't he a better time
1711,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,among the angels.
1712,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1713,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"But there is an end to all things. A violent illness, and his father"

1715,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"but he was eager to get home to his mother, and anxious to view Blanche"
1716,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,in the light of their new relationship. We had a whole series of parting
1717,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"scenes,--tears and vows and kisses exchanged. We clung to each other"
1718,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"after the regulation fashion, and swore never to forget, and to write"
1719,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,every day. Then there was a final wrench. I went back to my old
1720,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"life--he, away home."
1721,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1722,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"For a while I was content, there were daily letters from him to read;"
1723,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,his constant admonitions to practice; his many little tokens to
1724,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"adore--until there came a change,--letters less frequent, more mention"
1725,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"of Blanche and her love for him, less of his love for me, until the"
1726,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"truth was forced upon me. Then I grew cold and proud, and with an iron"

1730,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"Yes, quite melo-dramatic, wasn't it? It is a dramatic tale, though."
1731,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1732,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,So I threw off my habits of seclusion and mingled again with men and
1733,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"women, and took up all my long-forgotten plans. It's no use telling you"
1734,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"how I succeeded. It was really wonderful, wasn't it? It seems as though"
1735,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"that fickle goddess, Fortune, showered every blessing, save one, on my"
1736,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"path. Success followed success, triumph succeeded triumph. I was"
1737,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"lionized, feted, petted, caressed by the social and literary world. You"
1738,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,often used to wonder how I stood it in all those years. God knows; with
1739,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"the heart-sick weariness and the fierce loathing that possessed me, I"

1741,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1742,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"But, mind you, Eleanor, I schemed well. I had everything seemingly that"

1744,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,he should suffer too. Blanche turned against him and married his
1745,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,brother. An unfortunate chain of circumstances drove him from his
1746,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"father's home branded as a forger. Strange, wasn't it? But money is a"
1747,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"strong weapon, and its long arm reaches over leagues and leagues of land"

1749,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1750,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"One day he found me in a distant city, and begged for my love again, and"
1751,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"for mercy and pity. Blanche was only a mistake, he said, and he loved me"
1752,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"alone, and so on. I remembered all his thrilling tones and tender"
1753,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"glances, but they might have moved granite now sooner than me. He knelt"
1754,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,at my feet and pleaded like a criminal suing for life. I laughed at him
1755,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"and sneered at his misery, and told him what he had done for my"
1756,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"happiness, and what I in turn had done for his."
1757,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1758,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"Eleanor, to my dying day, I shall never forget his face as he rose from"
1759,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"his knees, and with one awful, indescribable look of hate, anguish and"

1761,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"rose in me like a flood, drowning the sorrows of past years, and"
1762,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"overwhelming me in a deluge of pity. Strive as I did, I could not"
1763,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,repress it; a woman's love is too mighty to be put down with little
1764,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"reasonings. I called to him in terror, ""Bernard, Bernard!"" He did not"

1766,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,
1767,A STORY OF VENGEANCE.,"""Bernard, come back; I didn't mean it!"""

1885,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"The first three chapters of this history, contain a brief epitome of the"
1886,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Pentatouch of Moses. Though contrary to the teachings of tradition,"
1887,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Moses is said not to have written these books himself, but that they"
1888,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"were transcribed generations after his time. According to this theory,"
1889,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"then, the seeming imperfections and inconsistencies and tautological"
1890,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"errors of the Old Testament as compared with the brief, clear, concise,"
1891,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,logical statement of the Buddhists may readily be explained by the
1892,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"frailty of human memory, and the vividness of Oriental imagination."
1893,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1894,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Prince Mossa of the Buddhists, otherwise Moses of the Jews, was not, as"
1895,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"is popularly supposed, a foundling of the Jews, or a protege of the"
1896,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Egyptian princess, but a full fledged prince, son of Pharaoh the mighty."
1897,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,This abrupt over-throw of the tradition of ages is like all
1898,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"disillusions, distasteful, but even the most superficial study of"
1899,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,Egyptian customs and laws of that time will serve to impress us with the
1900,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,verity of this opinion. The law of caste was most rigidly and cruelly
1901,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"adhered to, and though all the pleadings and threatenings and weepings"
1902,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,of the starry-eyed favorite of the harem may have been brought to bear
1903,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"upon this descendant of Rameses, yet is it probable that a descendant of"
1904,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,an outcast race should receive the care and learning and advantages of
1905,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,a legally born prince? Hardly.
1906,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1907,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,The condition of the ancient Israelites in the Christian Scriptures and
1908,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"in the Buddhist parchment are the same, yet there is reason to believe"
1909,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,that the former was transcribed many centuries after the hieroglyphics
1910,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"of the latter became faded with age, hence, perhaps, the difference in"
1911,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,the parentage of Moses.
1912,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1913,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"""And Mossa was beloved throughout the land of Egypt for the goodness and"
1914,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"compassion he displayed for them that suffered, pleaded with his father"
1915,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"to soften the lot of these unhappy people, but Pharaoh became angry with"
1916,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"him, and only imposed more hardships upon his slaves."""
1917,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1918,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"At this period in our Scriptures, the Lord communicates with Moses, and"
1919,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"inflicts the plagues upon the nation, while in the manuscript of the"
1920,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Himis monks, the annual plague brought on by natural causes falls upon"
1921,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Egypt, and decimates the community. Here is a strange reversal of the"
1922,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"order of things. In India, for ages the home of superstition and idol"
1923,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"worship, that which has always been regarded by the Christians, the"
1924,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"sworn enemies of the supernatural, as an inexplicable mystery, is"
1925,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,accounted for by perfectly natural causes.
1926,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1927,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"From that time, the fourth chapter of the chronicle of St. Issa"
1928,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,corresponds exactly in its condensed form to the most prominent
1929,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"chronology of the Old Testament. With the beginning of the next chapter,"
1930,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"the Divine Infant, through whom the salvation of the world was to come,"
1931,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"appears upon the scene, as the first born of a poor but highly connected"
1932,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"family, referring, presumably, to the ancestry of Joseph and Mary."
1933,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1934,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,The remarkable wisdom of the child in earlier years is chronicled in our
1935,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,ancient parchment with as much care as in the vellum-bound volume of our
1936,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"church scriptures. At the age of twelve, the last glimpse we have of"
1937,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Jesus in the New Testament, is as a precocious boy, seated in the"
1938,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Temple, expounding the Scriptures to the learned members of the"
1939,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Sanhedrin. After that, we have no further sight of him, until sixteen"
1940,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"years later, he re-appears at the marriage in Cana, a grown and serious"
1941,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"man, already with well-formulated plans for the furtherance of his"
1942,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,father's kingdom. This broad lapse in the Scriptures is filled by one
1943,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"simple sentence in the gospel of St. Luke. ""And he was in the desert"
1944,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"till the day of his showing into Israel."" Where he was, why he had gone,"
1945,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,and what he was doing are left to the imagination of the scholar and
1946,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,commentator.
1947,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1948,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Many theories have been advanced, and the one most accepted, was that he"
1949,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"had followed the trade of his terrestrial father, Joseph, and was near"
1950,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Jerusalem among the tools of carpentry, helping his parents to feed the"
1951,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,hungry mouths of his brothers and sisters.
1952,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1953,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,But there appears another plausible theory advanced by the Buddhist
1954,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"historians, and sustained by the Buddhist traditions, that as Moses had"
1955,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,fled into the wilderness to spend forty years in fasting and preparation
1956,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"for his life work, so Jesus had fled, not to the wilderness, but to the"
1957,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,ancient culture and learning and the wisdom of centuries to prepare
1958,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"himself, by a knowledge of all religions for the day of the redemption."
1959,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1960,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Among the Jews of that day, and even among the more conservative"
1961,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"descendants of Abraham yet, there existed, and exists a law which"
1962,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"accustoms the marrying of the sons, especially the oldest son, at the"
1963,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"age of thirteen. It is supposed that Issa, resisting the thraldom and"
1964,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"carnal temptation of the marital state, fled from the importunities of"
1965,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"the wise men, who would fain unite their offspring with such a wise and"
1966,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,serious youth.
1967,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1968,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"""It was then that Issa clandestinely left his father's house, went out"
1969,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"of Jerusalem, and in company with some merchants, travelled toward"
1970,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Sinai."""
1971,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1972,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"""That he might perfect himself in the divine word and study the laws of"
1973,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"the Great Buddha."""
1974,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1975,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,For six years he kept all India stirred to its utmost depths as he
1976,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"afterward kept all Palestine stirred by the purity of his doctrines, and"
1977,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,the direct simplicity of his teachings. The white priests of Bramah gave
1978,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"him all their law, teaching him the language and religion of the"
1979,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"dwellers of the five rivers. In Juggernaut, Rajegrilia, Benares, and"
1980,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"other holy cities he was beloved by all. For true, here, as elsewhere,"
1981,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"to his theory of the universal brotherhood of man, not only did he move"
1982,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"among the upper classes, but also with the wretched Vaisyas and Soudras,"
1983,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"the lowest of low castes who even were forbidden to hear the Vedas read,"
1984,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"save only on feast days. Just as among the Jews, he was tolerant,"
1985,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"merciful and kindly disposed towards the Samaritans, the Magdalens, the"
1986,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,Lazaruses as to the haughty rabbis.
1987,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1988,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,His impress upon the home of Buddha and Brahma was manifested by the
1989,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"hitherto unknown theory of monotheism, established by him, but"
1990,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"gradually permitted to fall into desuetude, and become confounded with"
1991,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,the polytheistic hierarchy of the confusing religion. Just as the grand
1992,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,oneness and simplicity of the Christian religion has been permitted to
1993,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"deteriorate into many petty sects, each with its absurd limitations, and"
1994,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,its particular little method of worshipping the Great Father.
1995,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
1996,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,The teachings of Issa in India bear close relation in the general trend
1997,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,of thought to the teachings of Jesus among the multitudes about
1998,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,Jerusalem. There is the same universal simplicity of man's brotherhood;
1999,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,the complete self-abnegation of the flesh to the mind; the charitable
2000,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"impulses of a kind heart, and the utter disregard of caste, whether of"
2001,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"birth, or breeding, or riches."
2002,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2003,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Of miracles in India, Issa says, ""The miracles of our God began when the"
2004,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"universe was created, they occur each day, each instant; whosoever does"
2005,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"not see them, is deprived of one of the most beautiful gifts of life."""
2006,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2007,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"At last, according to the chronicles of the Buddhists, Issa was recalled"
2008,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"from his labors in India to the land of Israel, where the people"
2009,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"oppressed as of old by the Pharaohs, and now by the mighty men from the"
2010,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"country of the Ramones, otherwise the Romans."
2011,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2012,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,Here Pilate appears in a new light. Heretofore he has always been a
2013,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,passive figure in the story of the crucifixion. Indeed he is entirely
2014,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,exonerated from all blame by some of our religious bibliographers and
2015,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"made to appear in a philanthropic light, but the priests of Egypt,"
2016,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,undeceived by the treacherous memories and careless chronicling on the
2017,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"disciples of old, place Pilate before us as a thorough Roman, greedy,"
2018,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"crafty, cruel, unscrupulous. According to them he places a spy upon the"
2019,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"actions of Jesus in the beginning of his three years teachings, who"
2020,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"follows him in all his journeys, and in the end betrays him to the"
2021,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Romans. This person can be no other than Judas, the betrayer. And here"
2022,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,we are permitted to view his seemingly inexplicable actions in a new
2023,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"light, and from being Judas, a sorrowing misanthrope, the erstwhile"
2024,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"friend of Christ, he becomes merely a common enemy, the tool of the"
2025,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,Romans.
2026,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2027,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Then we have the trial and death of Issa, strongly similar to our"
2028,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"accepted version, and the chronicle briefly ends with the statement of"
2029,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,the subsequent work of the disciples. The story of the Buddhist was
2030,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,written very shortly after the Passion of the Cross; the New Testament
2031,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,was transcribed years after the chief actors were dust.
2032,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2033,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"We are so steeped in tradition, and so conservative on any subject that"
2034,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,touches our religious beliefs that it is somewhat difficult to reconcile
2035,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,ourselves to another addition to our Scriptures. But if we should look
2036,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"at the matter earnestly, and give deep thought to the relative"
2037,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"positions, lives, and endings of these two noble men, Issa and Christ,"
2038,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"we could scarcely doubt that they are one. Without trying, as does the"
2039,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"author, to break down with one fell swoop, the entire structure of the"
2040,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Bible, we cannot but admit the probability of the new theory."
2041,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2042,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,It may be claimed that the remarkable personality of Christ would have
2043,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"left more of an impress upon India than it did, and that Christianity"
2044,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"there and in India would have been synchronous, but we must remember,"
2045,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"that there among the idols of Bramah and Vishnu, the way was not"
2046,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"prepared, the people unexpectant of a new prophet, unwarned of him and"
2047,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,unheeded. There he seems to have had no close personal followers to take
2048,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"up the work just where he left it, and continue. The dwellers of India"
2049,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"were more happy in their entirety and more comfortable than the Jews,"
2050,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,hence there was no Deliverer to impress them forever with the gigantic
2051,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,sacrifice of human frame and Divine soul.
2052,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,
2053,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"St. Issa, one of the most revered prophets of the Buddhists, Jesus"
2054,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"Christ, the Man and God of all other men, the divine incarnation of the"
2055,THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.,"ideal, are they the same? Why not?"

2065,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"neighborhood by continually falling in the gutter on special occasions,"
2066,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"had mentioned this fact to anyone, but all the interested denizens of"
2067,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,that particular square could tell by the unusual air of bustle and
2068,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"activity which pervaded the Hart domicile. Lillian, the æsthetic, who"
2069,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"furnished theme for many spirited discussions, leaned airily out of the"
2070,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"window; her auburn (red) tresses carefully done in curl papers. Martha,"
2071,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"the practical, flourished the broom and duster with unwonted activity,"

2073,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"shutters of the front door, duly reported to their mammas, busily"

2119,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2120,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Mrs. Tuckley tossed her head and sniffed contemptuously, Mrs. Luke began"
2121,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"to rehearse a time worn tale, how once a carriage had driven up to the"
2122,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Hart house at nine o'clock at night, and a distinguished looking man"
2123,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"alighted, went in, stayed about ten minutes and finally drove off with a"
2124,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,great clatter. Heads that had shaken ominously over this story before
2125,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"began to shake again, and tongues that had wagged themselves tired with"
2126,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,conjectures started now with some brand new ideas and theories. The
2127,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"children of the square, tired of fishing for minnows in the ditches, and"
2128,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"making mud-pies in the street, clustered about their mother's skirts"
2129,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"receiving occasional slaps, when their attempts at taking part in the"
2130,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,conversation became too pronounced.
2131,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2132,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Meanwhile, in the Hart household, all was bustle and preparation. To and"
2133,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"fro the members of the house flitted, arranging chairs, putting little"
2134,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"touches here and there, washing saucers and glasses, chasing the Hart"
2135,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Juniors about, losing things and calling frantically for each other's"
2136,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"assistance to find them. Mama Hart, big, plump and perspiring, puffed"
2137,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"here and there like a large, rosy engine, giving impossible orders, and"
2138,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"receiving sharp answers to foolish questions. Lillian, the æsthetic,"
2139,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,practiced her most graceful poses before the large mirror in the
2140,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"parlor; Martha rushed about, changing the order of the furniture, and"
2141,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Papa Hart, just come in from work, paced the rooms disconsolately,"
2142,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,asking for dinner.
2143,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,

2147,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2148,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Eight o'clock finally arrived, and with it, the music and some"

2150,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"out into the murky atmosphere, the smaller portion of the neighborhood"

2153,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,exclamations of approval or disapprobation concerning the state of
2154,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,affairs behind the green shutters. It was a warm night and the big round
2155,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"moon sailed serenely in a cloudless, blue sky. Mrs. Tuckley had put on a"

2185,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2186,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Nice crowd, eh?"" remarked Papa Hart. He was brimful of joy and"
2187,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"second-class whiskey, so no one paid any attention to him."
2188,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2189,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""But did you see how shamefully Maude flirted with Willie Howard?"" said"
2190,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,Lillian. Martha tossed her head in disdain; Mr. Howard she had always
2191,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"considered her especial property, so Lillian's observation had a rather"
2192,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,disturbing effect.
2193,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2194,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""I'm so warm and tired,"" cried Mama Hart, plaintively, ""children how are"
2195,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"we going to sleep to-night?"""
2196,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2197,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,Thereupon the whole family arose to devise ways and means for wooing the
2198,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,drowsy god. As for the Hart Juniors they had long since solved the
2199,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,problem by falling asleep with sticky hands and faces upon a pile of
2200,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,bed-clothing behind the kitchen door.

2204,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,It was late in the next day before the house had begun to resume
2205,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,anything like its former appearance. The little Harts were kept busy all
2206,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"morning returning chairs and dishes, and distributing the remnants of"
2207,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"the feast to the vicinity. The ice-cream had melted into a warm custard,"
2208,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"and the cakes had a rather worse for wear appearance, but they were"
2209,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,appreciated as much as though just from the confectioner. No one was
2210,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"forgotten, even Mrs. Tuckley, busily stitching on a muslin garment on"
2211,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"the steps, and unctuously rolling the latest morsel of scandal under her"
2212,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"tongue, was obliged to confess that ""them Hartses wasn't such bad people"
2213,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"after all, just a bit queer at times."""
2214,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2215,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"About two o'clock, just as Lillian was re-draping the tidies on the"
2216,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"stiff, common plush chairs in the parlor, some one pulled the bell"
2217,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"violently. The visitor, a rather good-looking young fellow, with a"
2218,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,worried expression smiled somewhat sarcastically as he heard a sound of
2219,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,scuffling and running within the house.

2223,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Presently Mrs. Hart opened the door wiping her hand, red and smoking"
2224,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"with dish-water, upon her apron. The worried expression deepened on the"
2225,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,visitor's face as he addressed the woman with visible embarrassment.
2226,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2227,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Er--I--I--suppose you are Mrs. Hart?"" he inquired awkwardly."
2228,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2229,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""That's my name, sir,"" replied she with pretentious dignity."
2230,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2231,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Er--your-er--may I come in madam?"
2232,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2233,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Certainly,"" and she opened the door to admit him, and offered a chair."
2234,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2235,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Your husband is an employee in the Fisher Oil Mills, is he not?"""
2236,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2237,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,Mrs. Hart straightened herself with pride as she replied in the
2238,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,affirmative. She had always been proud of Mr. Hart's position as foreman
2239,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"of the big oil mills, and was never so happy as when he was expounding"
2240,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"to some one in her presence, the difficulties and intricacies of"
2241,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,machine-work.
2242,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2243,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Well you see my dear Mrs. Hart,"" continued the visitor. ""Now pray don't"
2244,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"get excited--there has been an accident, and your husband--has--er--been"
2245,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"hurt, you know."""
2246,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2247,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"But for a painful whitening in her usually rosy face, and a quick"
2248,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"compression of her lips, the wife made no sign."
2249,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2250,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""What was the accident?"" she queried, leaning her elbows on her knees."
2251,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2252,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Well, you see, I don't understand machinery and the like, but there was"
2253,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"something about a wheel out of gear, and a band bursted, or something,"
2254,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"anyhow a big wheel flew to pieces, and as he was standing near, he was"
2255,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"hit."""
2256,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2257,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Where?"""
2258,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2259,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"""Well--well, I may as well tell you the truth, madam; a large piece of"

2261,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2262,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"She did not faint, nor make any outcry, nor tear her hair as he had"
2263,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"partly expected, but sat still staring at him, with a sort of helpless,"
2264,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"dumb horror shining out her eyes, then with a low moan, bowed her head"
2265,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"on her knees and shuddered, just as Lillian came in, curious to know"
2266,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,what the handsome stranger had to say to her mother.

2270,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"The poor mutilated body came home at last, and was laid in a stiff,"
2271,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"silver-decorated, black coffin in the middle of the sitting-room, which"
2272,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,had been made to look as uncomfortable and unnatural as mirrors and
2273,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,furniture shrouded in sheets and mantel and tables divested of ornaments
2274,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,would permit.
2275,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2276,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"There was a wake that night to the unconfined joy of the neighbors, who"
2277,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,would rather a burial than a wedding. The friends of the family sat
2278,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"about the coffin, and through the house with long pulled faces. Mrs."
2279,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"Tuckley officiated in the kitchen, making coffee and dispensing cheese"
2280,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"and crackers to those who were hungry. As the night wore on, and the"
2281,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"first restraint disappeared, jokes were cracked, and quiet laughter"
2282,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"indulged in, while the young folks congregated in the kitchen, were"
2283,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"hilariously happy, until some member of the family would appear, when"
2284,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,every face would sober down.
2285,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2286,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,The older persons contented themselves with recounting the virtues of
2287,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"the deceased, and telling anecdotes wherein he figured largely. It was"
2288,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,astonishing how many intimate friends of his had suddenly come to
2289,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"light. Every other man present had either attended school with him, or"
2290,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,was a close companion until he died. Proverbs and tales and witty
2291,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"sayings were palmed off as having emanated from his lips. In fact, the"
2292,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"dead man would have been surprised himself, had he suddenly come to life"
2293,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"and discovered what an important, what a modern solomon he had become."
2294,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2295,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"The long night dragged on, and the people departed in groups of twos and"
2296,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"threes, until when the gray dawn crept slowly over the blackness of"
2297,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"night shrouding the electric lights in mists of cloudy blue, and sending"
2298,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"cold chills of dampness through the house, but a few of the great crowd"
2299,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,remained.
2300,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,
2301,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,The day seemed so gray in contrast to the softening influence of the
2302,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"night, the grief which could be hidden then, must now come forth and"
2303,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,parade itself before all eyes. There was the funeral to prepare for; the
2304,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,dismal black dresses and bonnets with their long crape veils to don;
2305,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,there were the condolences of sorrowing friends to receive; the floral
2306,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,offerings to be looked at. The little Harts strutted about resplendent
2307,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"in stiff black cravats, and high crape bands about their hats. They were"
2308,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,divided between two conflicting emotions--joy at belonging to a family
2309,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"so noteworthy and important, and sorrow at the death. As the time for"
2310,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"the funeral approached, and Lillian began to indulge in a series of"
2311,IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.,"fainting fits, the latter feeling predominated."

2393,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"When Miss Sophie knew consciousness again, the long, faint, swelling"
2394,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,notes of the organ were dying away in distant echoes through the great
2395,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"arches of the silent church, and she was alone, crouching in a little,"
2396,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"forsaken, black heap at the altar of the Virgin. The twinkling tapers"
2397,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"seemed to smile pityingly upon her, the beneficent smile of the"
2398,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,white-robed Madonna seemed to whisper comfort. A long gust of chill air
2399,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"swept up the aisles, and Miss Sophie shivered, not from cold, but from"
2400,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,nervousness.
2401,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2402,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"But darkness was falling, and soon the lights would be lowered, and the"
2403,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"great, massive doors would be closed, so gathering her thin little cape"
2404,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"about her frail shoulders, Miss Sophie hurried out, and along the"
2405,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,brilliant noisy streets home.
2406,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2407,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"It was a wretched, lonely little room, where the cracks let the"
2408,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"boisterous wind whistle through, and the smoky, grimy walls looked"
2409,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,cheerless and unhomelike. A miserable little room in a miserable little
2410,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,cottage in one of the squalid streets of the Third District that nature
2411,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,and the city fathers seemed to have forgotten.
2412,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2413,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"As bare and comfortless the room, so was Miss Sophie's lonely life. She"
2414,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"rented these four walls from an unkempt little Creole woman, whose"
2415,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"progeny seemed like the promised offspring of Abraham,--multitudinous."
2416,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,The flickering life in the pale little body she scarcely kept there by
2417,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"the unceasing toil of a pair of bony hands, stitching, stitching,"
2418,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"ceaselessly, wearingly on the bands and pockets of pants. It was her"
2419,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"bread, this monotonous, unending work, and though while days and nights"
2420,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"constant labor brought but the most meagre recompense, it was her only"
2421,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,hope of life.
2422,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2423,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"She sat before the little charcoal brazier and warmed her transparent,"
2424,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"needle-pricked fingers, thinking meanwhile of the strange events of the"
2425,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"day. She had been up town to carry the great, black bundle of pants and"
2426,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"vests to the factory and receive her small pittance, and on the way home"
2427,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,stopped in at the Jesuit Church to say her little prayer at the altar of
2428,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"the calm, white Virgin. There had been a wondrous burst of music from"
2429,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"the great organ as she knelt there, an over-powering perfume of many"
2430,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"flowers, the glittering dazzle of many lights, and the dainty frou-frou"
2431,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,of silken skirts of wedding guests filing and tripping. So Miss Sophie
2432,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"stayed to the wedding, for what feminine heart, be it ever so old and"
2433,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"seared, does not delight in one? And why shouldn't a poor little Creole"
2434,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,old maid be interested too?
2435,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2436,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"When the wedding party had filed in solemnly, to the rolling, swelling,"
2437,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"pealing tones of the organ. Important-looking groomsmen, dainty, fluffy,"
2438,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"white-robed maids, stately, satin-robed, illusion-veiled bride, and"
2439,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,happy groom. She leaned forward to catch a better glimpse of their
2440,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,faces. Ah!--
2441,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2442,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,Those near the Virgin's altar who heard a faint sigh and rustle on the
2443,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"steps glanced curiously as they saw a slight, black-robed figure clutch"
2444,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,the railing and lean her head against it. Miss Sophie had fainted.
2445,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2446,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""I must have been hungry,"" she mused over the charcoal fire in her"
2447,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"little room, ""I must have been hungry,"" and she smiled a wan smile, and"
2448,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,busied herself getting her evening meal of coffee and bread and ham.
2449,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2450,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"If one were given to pity, the first thought that would rush to one's"
2451,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,lips at sight of Miss Sophie would have been: Poor little Miss Sophie!
2452,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,She had come among the bareness and sordidness of this neighborhood five
2453,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"years ago, robed in crepe, and crying with great sobs that seemed to"
2454,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"fairly shake the vitality out of her. Perfectly silent, too, about her"
2455,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"former life, but for all that, Michel, the quarter grocer at the corner,"
2456,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"and Mme. Laurent, who kept the rabbe shop opposite, had fixed it all up"
2457,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"between them, of her sad history and past glories. Not that they knew,"
2458,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"but then Michel must invent something when the neighbors came to him,"
2459,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,their fountain head of wisdom.
2460,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2461,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,One morning little Miss Sophie opened wide her dingy windows to catch
2462,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,the early freshness of the autumn wind as it whistled through the
2463,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"yellow-leafed trees. It was one of those calm, blue-misted, balmy,"
2464,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,November days that New Orleans can have when all the rest of the country
2465,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"is fur-wrapped. Miss Sophie pulled her machine to the window, where the"
2466,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"sweet, damp wind could whisk among her black locks."
2467,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2468,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Whirr, whirr, went the machine, ticking fast and lightly over the belts"
2469,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"of the rough jean pants. Whirr, whirr, yes, and Miss Sophie was actually"
2470,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,humming a tune! She felt strangely light to-day.
2471,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2472,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""_Ma foi_,"" muttered Michel, strolling across the street to where Mme."
2473,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Laurent sat sewing behind the counter on blue and brown-checked aprons,"
2474,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""but the little ma'amselle sings. Perhaps she recollects."""
2475,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2476,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Perhaps,"" muttered the rabbe woman."
2477,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2478,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,But little Miss Sophie felt restless. A strange impulse seemed drawing
2479,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"her up town, and the machine seemed to run slow, slow, before it would"
2480,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,stitch the endless number of jean belts. Her fingers trembled with
2481,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,nervous haste as she pinned up the unwieldy black bundle of the finished
2482,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"work, and her feet fairly tripped over each other in their eagerness to"
2483,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"get to Claiborne Street, where she could board the up-town car. There"
2484,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"was a feverish desire to go somewhere, a sense of elation,--foolish"
2485,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,happiness that brought a faint echo of color into her pinched cheeks.
2486,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,She wondered why.
2487,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2488,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,No one noticed her in the car. Passengers on the Claiborne line are too
2489,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"much accustomed to frail, little black-robed women with big, black"
2490,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,bundles; it is one of the city's most pitiful sights. She leaned her
2491,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,head out of the window to catch a glimpse of the oleanders on Bayou
2492,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Road, when her attention was caught by a conversation in the car."
2493,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2494,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Yes, it's too bad for Neale, and lately married too,"" said the elder"
2495,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"man, ""I can't see what he is to do."""
2496,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2497,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,Neale! she pricked up her ears. That was the name of the groom in the

2499,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2500,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""How did it happen?"" languidly inquired the younger. He was a stranger,"

2502,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"attire, too."
2503,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2504,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Well, the firm failed first; he didn't mind that much, he was so sure"
2505,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"of his uncle's inheritance repairing his lost fortunes, but suddenly"
2506,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"this difficulty of identification springs up, and he is literally on the"
2507,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"verge of ruin."""
2508,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2509,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Won't some of you fellows who've known him all your lives do to"

2512,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Gracious man, we've tried, but the absurd old will expressly stipulates"

2516,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2517,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Well, you're all chumps. Why doesn't he get the ring from the owner?"""
2518,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2519,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Easily said--but--It seems that Neale had some little Creole"
2520,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,love-affair some years ago and gave this ring to his dusky-eyed fiancee.
2521,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"But you know how Neale is with his love-affairs, went off and forgot the"
2522,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"girl in a month. It seems, however, she took it to heart,--so much so"
2523,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"until he's ashamed to try to find her or the ring."""
2524,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2525,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,Miss Sophie heard no more as she gazed out into the dusty grass. There
2526,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"were tears in her eyes, hot blinding ones that wouldn't drop for pride,"
2527,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,but stayed and scalded. She knew the story with all its embellishments
2528,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"of heartaches. The ring, too; she remembered the day she had kissed and"
2529,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"wept and fondled it, until it seemed her heart must burst under its load"
2530,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,of grief before she took it to the pawn broker's that another might be
2531,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"eased before the end came,--that other, her father. The ""little Creole"
2532,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"love affair"" of Neale's had not always been poor and old and"
2533,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"jaded-looking; but reverses must come, even Neale knew that--so the ring"
2534,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,was at the _Mont de Piete_.
2535,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2536,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Still he must have it, it was his; it would save him from disgrace and"
2537,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"suffering, and from trailing the proud head of the white-gowned bride"
2538,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"into sorrow. He must have it,--but how?"
2539,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2540,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"There it was still at the pawn-broker's, no one would have such a jewel,"
2541,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"and the ticket was home in the bureau drawer. Well, he must have it; she"
2542,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,might starve in the attempt. Such a thing as going to him and telling
2543,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"him that he might redeem it was an impossibility. That good,"
2544,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"straight-backed, stiff-necked Creole blood would have risen in all its"
2545,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,strength and choked her. No; as a present had the quaint Roman circlet
2546,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"been placed upon her finger,--as a present should it be returned."
2547,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2548,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"The bumping car rode heavily, and the hot thoughts beat heavily in her"
2549,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,poor little head. He must have the ring--but how--the ring--the Roman
2550,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"ring--the white-robed bride starving--she was going mad--ah yes,--the"
2551,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,church.
2552,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2553,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Right in the busiest, most bustling part of the town, its fresco and"
2554,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"bronze and iron quaintly suggestive of mediæval times. Within, all cool"
2555,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"and dim and restful, with the faintest whiff of lingering incense rising"
2556,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"and pervading the gray arches. Yes, the Virgin would know and have pity;"
2557,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"the sweet, white-robed Virgin at the pretty flower-decked altar, or the"
2558,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"one away up in the niche, far above the golden dome where the Host was."
2559,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Holy Mary, Mother of God. Poor little Miss Sophie."
2560,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2561,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Titiche, the busy-body of the house, noticed that Miss Sophie's bundle"
2562,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"was larger than usual that afternoon. ""Ah, poor woman!"" sighed Titiche's"
2563,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"mother, ""she would be rich for Christmas."""
2564,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2565,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"The bundle grew larger each day, and Miss Sophie grew smaller. The"
2566,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"damp, cold rain and mist closed the white-curtained window, but always"
2567,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,there behind the sewing machine drooped and bobbed the little
2568,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"black-robed figure. Whirr, whirr went the wheels, and the coarse jean"
2569,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,pants piled in great heaps at her side. The Claiborne street car saw her
2570,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"oftener than before, and the sweet, white Virgin in the flowered niche"
2571,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,above the gold-domed altar smiled at the little penitent almost every
2572,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,day.
2573,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2574,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""_Ma foi_,"" said the slatternly landlady to Madame Laurent and Michel one"
2575,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"day, ""I no see how she live! Eat? Nothing, nothing, almost, and las'"
2576,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"night when it was so cold and foggy, eh? I hav' to mek him build fire."
2577,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"She mos' freeze."""
2578,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2579,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,Whereupon the rumor spread that Miss Sophie was starving herself to
2580,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"death to get some luckless relative out of jail for Christmas,--a rumor"
2581,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,which enveloped her scraggy little figure with a kind of halo to the
2582,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,neighbors when she appeared on the streets.
2583,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2584,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,November had verged into December and the little pile of coins were yet
2585,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,far from the sum needed. Dear God! how the money did have to go. The
2586,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"rent, and the groceries and the coal,--though, to be sure, she used a"
2587,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"precious bit of that. All the work and saving and skimping,--maybe, yes,"
2588,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,maybe by Christmas. What a gift!
2589,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2590,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Christmas Eve night on Royal Street is no place for a weakling, for the"
2591,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,shouts and carousals of the roisterers will strike fear into the brave.
2592,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Yet amid the cries and yells, the deafening blow of horns and tin"
2593,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"whistles and the really dangerous fusillade of fireworks, the little"
2594,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"figure hurried along, one hand clutching tight the battered hat that the"
2595,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"rude merry-makers would have torn off, the other grasping under the"
2596,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"thin, black cape a worn little pocketbook."
2597,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2598,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Into the _Mont de Piete_, breathless, eager. The ticket? Here, worn,"
2599,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"crumpled. The ring? It was not gone? No, thank Heaven! It was really a"
2600,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"joy well worth her toil, she thought, to have it again."
2601,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2602,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,Had Titiche not been shooting crackers on the banquette instead of
2603,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"peering into the crack, as was his wont, his big, round, black eyes"
2604,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,would have grown saucer-wide to see little Miss Sophie kiss and fondle a
2605,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"ring, an ugly clumsy band of gold."
2606,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2607,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Ah, dear ring,"" she murmured, once you were his, and you shall be his"
2608,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"again. You shall be on his finger, and perhaps touch his heart. Dear"
2609,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"ring, _ma chere petite, de ma coeur, cheri, de ma coeur. Je t'aime, je"
2610,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"t'aime, oui, oui._ You are his, you were mine once too. To-night, just"
2611,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"one night, I'll keep you--then--tomorrow, where you can save him."
2612,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2613,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Ah, the Virgin--she smiles at me because I did right, did I not sweet"
2614,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"mother? She smiles--and--I grow--faint--"""
2615,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2616,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,The loud whistles and horns of the little ones rose on the balmy air
2617,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"next morning. No one would doubt it was Christmas Day, even if doors"
2618,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,and windows are open wide to let in cool air.
2619,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2620,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Why, there was Christmas even in the very look of the mules on the poky"
2621,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"cars; there was Christmas noise in the streets, and Christmas toys and"
2622,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"Christmas odors, savory ones that made the nose wrinkle approvingly,"
2623,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,issuing from the kitchen. Michel and Mme. Laurent smiled greetings
2624,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"across the street at each other, and the salutation from a passer-by"
2625,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,recalled the many progenied landlady to herself.
2626,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2627,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Miss Sophie, well, poor soul, not very much Christmas for her. _Mais_,"
2628,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"I'll just call her in to spend the day with me. It'll cheer her a bit."""
2629,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2630,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,So clean and orderly within the poor little room. Not a speck of dust or
2631,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"a litter of any kind on the quaint little old-time high bureau, unless"
2632,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,you might except a sheet of paper lying loose with something written on
2633,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,it. Titiche had evidently inherited his prying propensities for the
2634,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,landlady turned it over and read:
2635,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2636,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""Louis. Here is the ring. I return it to you. I heard you needed it, I"
2637,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"hope it comes not too late. Sophie."""
2638,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,
2639,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"""The ring, where?"" muttered the landlady. There it was, clasped between"
2640,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,"her fingers on her bosom. A bosom, white and cold, under a cold, happy"
2641,LITTLE MISS SOPHIE.,face. Christmas had indeed dawned for Miss Sophie--the eternal

2750,AT EVENTIDE.,
2751,AT EVENTIDE.,
2752,AT EVENTIDE.,"All day had she watched and waited for his coming, and still her"
2753,AT EVENTIDE.,strained ears caught no sounds of the footsteps she loved and longed to
2754,AT EVENTIDE.,hear. All day while the great sun panted on his way around the brazen
2755,AT EVENTIDE.,skies; all day while the busy world throbbed its mighty engines of
2756,AT EVENTIDE.,"labor, nor witted of the breaking hearts in its midst. And now when the"
2757,AT EVENTIDE.,"eve had come, and the sun sank slowly to rest, casting his red rays over"
2758,AT EVENTIDE.,"the earth he loved, and bidding tired nature a gentle radiant"
2759,AT EVENTIDE.,"good-night, she still watched and waited. Waited while the young moon"
2760,AT EVENTIDE.,"shone silvery in the crimson flush of the eastern sky, while the one"
2761,AT EVENTIDE.,bright star trembled as he strove to near his love; waited while the hum
2762,AT EVENTIDE.,"of soul-wearing traffic died in the distant streets, and the merry"
2763,AT EVENTIDE.,voices of happy children floated to her ears.
2764,AT EVENTIDE.,
2765,AT EVENTIDE.,And still he came not. What kept him from her side? Had he learned the
2766,AT EVENTIDE.,"cold lesson of self-control, or found one other thing more potent than"
2767,AT EVENTIDE.,love? Had some cruel chain of circumstances forced him to disobey her
2768,AT EVENTIDE.,"bidding--or--did he love another? But no, she smiles triumphantly, he"
2769,AT EVENTIDE.,could not having known and loved her.
2770,AT EVENTIDE.,
2771,AT EVENTIDE.,Sitting in the deep imbrasure of the window through which the distant
2772,AT EVENTIDE.,"wave sounds of city life floated to her, the pages of her life seemed to"
2773,AT EVENTIDE.,"turn back, and she read the almost forgotten tale of long ago, the story"
2774,AT EVENTIDE.,of their love. In those days his wish had been her law; his smile her
2775,AT EVENTIDE.,"sun; his frown her wretchedness. Within his arms, earth seemed a"
2776,AT EVENTIDE.,"far-away dream of empty nothingness, and when his lips touched and clung"
2777,AT EVENTIDE.,"to hers, sweet with the perfume of the South they floated away into a"
2778,AT EVENTIDE.,"Paradise of enfolding space, where Time and Death and the woes of this"
2779,AT EVENTIDE.,"great earth are naught, only these two--and love, the almighty."
2780,AT EVENTIDE.,
2781,AT EVENTIDE.,And so their happiness drifted slowly across the sea of Time until it
2782,AT EVENTIDE.,"struck a cruel rock, whose sharp teeth showed not above the dimpled"
2783,AT EVENTIDE.,"waves; and where once had been a craft of strength and beauty, now was"
2784,AT EVENTIDE.,"only a hideous wreck. For the Tempter had come into this Eden, and soon"
2785,AT EVENTIDE.,his foul whisper found place in her heart.
2786,AT EVENTIDE.,
2787,AT EVENTIDE.,And the Tempter's name was Ambition.
2788,AT EVENTIDE.,
2789,AT EVENTIDE.,Often had the praises and plaudits of men rang in her ears when her
2790,AT EVENTIDE.,"sweet voice sang to her chosen friends, often had the tears evoked by"
2791,AT EVENTIDE.,"her songs of love and hope and trust, thrilled her breast faintly, as"
2792,AT EVENTIDE.,"the young bird stirs in its nest under the loving mother's wing, but he"
2793,AT EVENTIDE.,"had clasped his arms around her, and that was enough. But one day the"
2794,AT EVENTIDE.,"Tempter whispered, ""Why waste such talent; bring that beauty of voice"
2795,AT EVENTIDE.,"before the world and see men bow in homage, and women envy and praise."
2796,AT EVENTIDE.,"Come forth and follow me."""
2797,AT EVENTIDE.,
2798,AT EVENTIDE.,"But she put him fiercely aside, and cried, ""I want no homage but his, I"
2799,AT EVENTIDE.,"want no envy from any one."""
2800,AT EVENTIDE.,
2801,AT EVENTIDE.,"Still the whisper stayed in her heart, nor would the honeyed words of"
2802,AT EVENTIDE.,"praise be gone, even when he kissed her, and thanked the gods for this"
2803,AT EVENTIDE.,pearl of great price.
2804,AT EVENTIDE.,
2805,AT EVENTIDE.,"Then as time fled on, the tiny whisper grew into a great roar, and all"
2806,AT EVENTIDE.,"the praise of men, and the sweet words of women, filled her brain, and"
2807,AT EVENTIDE.,"what had once been her aversion became a great desire, and caused her"
2808,AT EVENTIDE.,"brow to grow thoughtful, and her eyes moody."
2809,AT EVENTIDE.,
2810,AT EVENTIDE.,"But when she spoke to him of this new love, he smiled and said, ""My wife"
2811,AT EVENTIDE.,"must be mine, and mine alone. I want not a woman whom the world claims,"
2812,AT EVENTIDE.,"and shouts her name abroad. My wife and my home must be inviolate."" And"
2813,AT EVENTIDE.,"again as of yore, his wish controlled her--but only for a while."
2814,AT EVENTIDE.,
2815,AT EVENTIDE.,"Then the tiny whisper grown into the great roar urging her on, became a"
2816,AT EVENTIDE.,"mighty wind which drove her before it, nor could she turn aside from the"
2817,AT EVENTIDE.,"path of ambition, but swept on, and conquered."
2818,AT EVENTIDE.,
2819,AT EVENTIDE.,"Ah, sweet, sweet the exultation of the victor! Dear the plaudits of the"
2820,AT EVENTIDE.,"admiring world; wild the joy, when queen of song, admired of men, she"
2821,AT EVENTIDE.,"stood upon the pinnacle of fame! And he? True to his old convictions,"
2822,AT EVENTIDE.,turned sadly from the woman who placed the admiration of the world
2823,AT EVENTIDE.,before his love and the happiness of his home--and went out from her
2824,AT EVENTIDE.,"life broken-hearted, disappointed, miserable."
2825,AT EVENTIDE.,
2826,AT EVENTIDE.,"All these things, and more, she thought upon in the first flush of"
2827,AT EVENTIDE.,"eventide, as the bold, young star climbed toward his lady-love, the"
2828,AT EVENTIDE.,"moon, all these things, and what had come to pass after the victory."
2829,AT EVENTIDE.,
2830,AT EVENTIDE.,"For there came a day when the world wearied of its toy, and turned with"
2831,AT EVENTIDE.,"shouts of joy, and wreaths of fresh laurels for the new star. Then came"
2832,AT EVENTIDE.,disappointments and miseries crowding fast upon her; the sorrows which
2833,AT EVENTIDE.,a loving heart knows when it finds its idols faithless. Then the love
2834,AT EVENTIDE.,for him which she had once repressed arose in all its strength which had
2835,AT EVENTIDE.,"gained during the long struggle with the world, arose and overwhelmed"
2836,AT EVENTIDE.,"her with its might, and filled her soul with an unutterable longing for"
2837,AT EVENTIDE.,peace and rest and him.
2838,AT EVENTIDE.,
2839,AT EVENTIDE.,"She wrote to him and told him all her heart, and begged of him to come"
2840,AT EVENTIDE.,"back to her, for Fame was but an empty bubble while love was supreme and"
2841,AT EVENTIDE.,"the only happiness, after all. And now she waited while the crimson and"
2842,AT EVENTIDE.,"gold of the west grew dark, and gray and lowering."
2843,AT EVENTIDE.,
2844,AT EVENTIDE.,"Hark! She hears his loved step. He comes, ah, joy of heaven he comes!"
2845,AT EVENTIDE.,"Soon will he clasp her in his arms, and there on his bosom shall she"
2846,AT EVENTIDE.,know peace and rest and love.
2847,AT EVENTIDE.,
2848,AT EVENTIDE.,"As he enters the door she hastens to meet him, the love-light shining in"
2849,AT EVENTIDE.,"her tired eyes, her soft rounded arms outstretched to meet him. But he"
2850,AT EVENTIDE.,"folds her not in his embrace, nor yet does he look with love into her"
2851,AT EVENTIDE.,"upturned eyes; the voice she loves, ah so well, breaks upon the dusky"
2852,AT EVENTIDE.,"silence, pitiless, stern."
2853,AT EVENTIDE.,
2854,AT EVENTIDE.,"""Most faithless of faithless women, think you that like the toy of a"

2932,THE BEE-MAN.,
2933,THE BEE-MAN.,
2934,THE BEE-MAN.,"We were glancing over the mental photograph album, and commenting on the"
2935,THE BEE-MAN.,great lack of dissimilarity in tastes. Nearly every one preferred spring
2936,THE BEE-MAN.,"to any other season, with a very few exceptions in favor of autumn. The"
2937,THE BEE-MAN.,women loved Mrs. Browning and Longfellow; the men showed decided
2938,THE BEE-MAN.,preferences after Emerson and Macauley. Conceit stuck out when the
2939,THE BEE-MAN.,"majority wanted to be themselves and none other, and only two did not"
2940,THE BEE-MAN.,"want to live in the 19th century. But in one place, in answer to the"
2941,THE BEE-MAN.,"question, ""Whom would you rather be, if not yourself?"" the answer was,"
2942,THE BEE-MAN.,
2943,THE BEE-MAN.,"""A baby!"""
2944,THE BEE-MAN.,
2945,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Why would you rather be a baby than any other personage?"" queried"
2946,THE BEE-MAN.,"someone glancing at the writer, who blushed as she replied."
2947,THE BEE-MAN.,
2948,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Because then I might be able to live a better life, I might have better"
2949,THE BEE-MAN.,"opportunities and better chances for improving them, and it would bring"
2950,THE BEE-MAN.,"me nearer the 20th century."""
2951,THE BEE-MAN.,
2952,THE BEE-MAN.,"""About eight or nine years ago,"" said the first speaker, ""I remember"
2953,THE BEE-MAN.,reading a story in a magazine for young folks. It was merely a fairy
2954,THE BEE-MAN.,"story, and perhaps was not intended to point a moral, but only to amuse"
2955,THE BEE-MAN.,"the little ones. It was something on this order:--"""
2956,THE BEE-MAN.,
2957,THE BEE-MAN.,"Once upon a time, there lived in an out of the way spot an ancient"
2958,THE BEE-MAN.,"decrepit Bee-man. How old he was no one knew; whence he came, no one"
2959,THE BEE-MAN.,could tell: to the memory of the oldest inhabitant he had always lived
2960,THE BEE-MAN.,"in his dirty hut, surrounded by myriads of hives, attended always by a"
2961,THE BEE-MAN.,"swarm of bees. He was good to the bits of children, and always ready"
2962,THE BEE-MAN.,"with a sweet morsel of honeycomb for them. All his ambitions,"
2963,THE BEE-MAN.,sympathies and hopes were centered in his hives; until one day a fairy
2964,THE BEE-MAN.,crept into his hut and whispered:
2965,THE BEE-MAN.,
2966,THE BEE-MAN.,"""You have not always been a common bee-man. Once you were something"
2967,THE BEE-MAN.,"else."""
2968,THE BEE-MAN.,
2969,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Tell me what I was,"" he asked eagerly."
2970,THE BEE-MAN.,
2971,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Nay, that I cannot do,"" replied the fairy, ""our queen sent me to tell"
2972,THE BEE-MAN.,"you this, and if you wished to search for your former self, I am to"
2973,THE BEE-MAN.,"assist you. You must search the entire valley, and the first thing you"
2974,THE BEE-MAN.,"meet to which you become violently attached, that is what you formerly"
2975,THE BEE-MAN.,"were, and I shall give you back your correct form."""
2976,THE BEE-MAN.,
2977,THE BEE-MAN.,"So the next morning the Bee-man, strapping his usual hive upon his back,"
2978,THE BEE-MAN.,"and accompanied by the fairy in the form of a queen bee, set out upon"
2979,THE BEE-MAN.,his search throughout the valley. At first he became violently attached
2980,THE BEE-MAN.,"to the handsome person and fine castle of the Lord of the Realm, but on"
2981,THE BEE-MAN.,"being kicked out of the lord's domains, his love turned to dislike."
2982,THE BEE-MAN.,
2983,THE BEE-MAN.,The Bee-man and the fairy travelled far and wide and carefully inspected
2984,THE BEE-MAN.,"every thing they met. The very Imp, the Languid young man, the"
2985,THE BEE-MAN.,"Hippogriffith, the Thousand Tailed Hippopotamus, and many other types,"
2986,THE BEE-MAN.,until the Bee-man grew weary and was about to give up the search in
2987,THE BEE-MAN.,disgust.
2988,THE BEE-MAN.,
2989,THE BEE-MAN.,But suddenly amid all the vast halls of the enchanted domains through
2990,THE BEE-MAN.,"which they were wandering, there sounded shrieks and wails, and the"
2991,THE BEE-MAN.,inmates were thrown into the greatest confusion by the sight of the
2992,THE BEE-MAN.,"hideous hippogriffith dashing through, a million sparks emanating from"
2993,THE BEE-MAN.,"his great eyes, his barbed tail waving high in the air, and holding in"
2994,THE BEE-MAN.,his talons a tiny infant.
2995,THE BEE-MAN.,
2996,THE BEE-MAN.,"Now, as soon as the Bee-man saw this, a great wave of sorrow and pity"
2997,THE BEE-MAN.,"filled his breast, and he hastily followed the monster, arriving at his"
2998,THE BEE-MAN.,cave just in time to see him preparing to devour his prey. Madly dashing
2999,THE BEE-MAN.,"his hive of bees into the hippogriffith's face, and seizing the infant"
3000,THE BEE-MAN.,"while the disturbed and angry bees stung and swarmed, the Bee-man rushed"
3001,THE BEE-MAN.,"out followed by the Very Imp, the Languid young man and the fairy, and"
3002,THE BEE-MAN.,made his way to the child's mother. Just as soon as the baby was safely
3003,THE BEE-MAN.,"restored, the Bee-man ruminated thoughtfully awhile and finally remarked"
3004,THE BEE-MAN.,to the fairy:
3005,THE BEE-MAN.,
3006,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Do you know of all the things I have met so far, I liked the baby best"
3007,THE BEE-MAN.,"of all, so I think I must have been a baby once!"""
3008,THE BEE-MAN.,
3009,THE BEE-MAN.,"""Right you are,"" assented the fairy, ""I knew it before, but, of course,"
3010,THE BEE-MAN.,"I couldn't tell. Now I shall change you into your former shape, but"
3011,THE BEE-MAN.,"remember, you must try to be something better than a Bee-man."""
3012,THE BEE-MAN.,
3013,THE BEE-MAN.,The Bee-man promised and was instantly changed into a baby. The fairy
3014,THE BEE-MAN.,"inoculated him from harm with a bee-sting, and gave him to the rescued"
3015,THE BEE-MAN.,infant's mother.
3016,THE BEE-MAN.,
3017,THE BEE-MAN.,"Nearly a cycle passed by, and one day the fairy having business in the"
3018,THE BEE-MAN.,"valley, thought she would make inquiries concerning her protege. In her"
3019,THE BEE-MAN.,"way she happened to pass a little, low, curious hut, with many bee hives"
3020,THE BEE-MAN.,"about it, and swarms of bees flying in and out. The fairy, tired as"
3021,THE BEE-MAN.,"well as curious, peeped in and discovered an ancient man attending to"
3022,THE BEE-MAN.,"the wants of his pets. Upon a closer inspection, she recognized her"
3023,THE BEE-MAN.,infant of years ago. He had become a bee-man again!
3024,THE BEE-MAN.,
3025,THE BEE-MAN.,*       *       *       *       *
3026,THE BEE-MAN.,
3027,THE BEE-MAN.,"""It points a pretty little moral,"" said the Fatalist, ""for it certainly"
3028,THE BEE-MAN.,"proves that do what we will, we cannot get away from our natures. It was"
3029,THE BEE-MAN.,inherent in that man's nature to tend bees. Bee-ing was the occupation
3030,THE BEE-MAN.,"chosen for him by Fate, and had the beneficent Fairy changed him a dozen"
3031,THE BEE-MAN.,"times, he would ultimately have gone to bee-ing in some form or other."""
3032,THE BEE-MAN.,
3033,THE BEE-MAN.,"The Fatalist was doubtless right, for it seems as though the inherent"
3034,THE BEE-MAN.,things in our nature must come out. But if we want to dig deep into the
3035,THE BEE-MAN.,"child's story for metaphysical morals, does it not also uphold the"
3036,THE BEE-MAN.,"theory of re-incarnation? the ancient bee-man, perhaps is but a type of"
3037,THE BEE-MAN.,"humanity growing old, and settled in its mode of living, while the fairy"
3038,THE BEE-MAN.,"is but thought, whispering into our souls things half dread half"
3039,THE BEE-MAN.,pleasant.
3040,THE BEE-MAN.,
3041,THE BEE-MAN.,There are moments when the consciousness of a former life comes sharply
3042,THE BEE-MAN.,"upon us, in swift, lightning flashes, too sudden to be tangible, too"
3043,THE BEE-MAN.,"dazzling to leave an impress, or mayhap, in troubled dreams that"
3044,THE BEE-MAN.,bewilder and confuse with vague remembrances. If only a burst of memory
3045,THE BEE-MAN.,"would come upon some mortal, that the tale might be fully told, and"
3046,THE BEE-MAN.,these theories established as facts. It would unfold great possibilities
3047,THE BEE-MAN.,of historical lore; of literary life; of religious speculation.
