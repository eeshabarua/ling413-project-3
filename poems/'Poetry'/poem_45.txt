                            II


_He._ Dear my love, and O my love,
        And O my love so lately!
      Did we wander yonder grove
        And sit awhile sedately?
      For either you did there conclude
        To do at length as I did,
      Or passion's fashion's turn'd a prude,
        And troth's an oath derided.

_She._ Yea, my love--and nay, my love--
         And ask me not to tell, love,
       While I delay'd an idle day
         What 'twixt us there befell, love.
       Yet either I did sit beside
         And do at length as you did,
       Or my delight is lightly by
         An idle lie deluded!
