133,SEA ROSE,"meagre flower, thin,"
134,SEA ROSE,"sparse of leaf,"
135,SEA ROSE,
136,SEA ROSE,more precious
137,SEA ROSE,than a wet rose
138,SEA ROSE,single on a stem--
139,SEA ROSE,you are caught in the drift.
140,SEA ROSE,
141,SEA ROSE,"Stunted, with small leaf,"
142,SEA ROSE,"you are flung on the sand,"
143,SEA ROSE,you are lifted
144,SEA ROSE,in the crisp sand
145,SEA ROSE,that drives in the wind.
146,SEA ROSE,
147,SEA ROSE,Can the spice-rose
148,SEA ROSE,drip such acrid fragrance

155,THE HELMSMAN,
156,THE HELMSMAN,
157,THE HELMSMAN,O be swift--
158,THE HELMSMAN,we have always known you wanted us.
159,THE HELMSMAN,
160,THE HELMSMAN,"We fled inland with our flocks,"
161,THE HELMSMAN,"we pastured them in hollows,"
162,THE HELMSMAN,cut off from the wind
163,THE HELMSMAN,and the salt track of the marsh.
164,THE HELMSMAN,
165,THE HELMSMAN,We worshipped inland--
166,THE HELMSMAN,"we stepped past wood-flowers,"
167,THE HELMSMAN,"we forgot your tang,"
168,THE HELMSMAN,we brushed wood-grass.
169,THE HELMSMAN,
170,THE HELMSMAN,We wandered from pine-hills
171,THE HELMSMAN,"through oak and scrub-oak tangles,"
172,THE HELMSMAN,"we broke hyssop and bramble,"
173,THE HELMSMAN,we caught flower and new bramble-fruit
174,THE HELMSMAN,in our hair: we laughed
175,THE HELMSMAN,"as each branch whipped back,"
176,THE HELMSMAN,we tore our feet in half buried rocks
177,THE HELMSMAN,and knotted roots and acorn-cups.
178,THE HELMSMAN,
179,THE HELMSMAN,"We forgot--we worshipped,"
180,THE HELMSMAN,"we parted green from green,"
181,THE HELMSMAN,"we sought further thickets,"
182,THE HELMSMAN,we dipped our ankles
183,THE HELMSMAN,"through leaf-mould and earth,"
184,THE HELMSMAN,and wood and wood-bank enchanted us--
185,THE HELMSMAN,
186,THE HELMSMAN,"and the feel of the clefts in the bark,"
187,THE HELMSMAN,and the slope between tree and tree--
188,THE HELMSMAN,and a slender path strung field to field
189,THE HELMSMAN,and wood to wood
190,THE HELMSMAN,and hill to hill
191,THE HELMSMAN,and the forest after it.
192,THE HELMSMAN,
193,THE HELMSMAN,We forgot--for a moment
194,THE HELMSMAN,"tree-resin, tree-bark,"
195,THE HELMSMAN,sweat of a torn branch
196,THE HELMSMAN,were sweet to the taste.
197,THE HELMSMAN,
198,THE HELMSMAN,"We were enchanted with the fields,"
199,THE HELMSMAN,the tufts of coarse grass
200,THE HELMSMAN,in the shorter grass--
201,THE HELMSMAN,we loved all this.
202,THE HELMSMAN,
203,THE HELMSMAN,"But now, our boat climbs--hesitates--drops--"
204,THE HELMSMAN,climbs--hesitates--crawls back--
205,THE HELMSMAN,climbs--hesitates--
206,THE HELMSMAN,O be swift--
207,THE HELMSMAN,we have always known you wanted us.

217,I,I
218,I,
219,I,Are your rocks shelter for ships--
220,I,"have you sent galleys from your beach,"
221,I,are you graded--a safe crescent--
222,I,where the tide lifts them back to port--
223,I,"are you full and sweet,"
224,I,tempting the quiet
225,I,to depart in their trading ships?
226,I,
227,I,"Nay, you are great, fierce, evil--"
228,I,you are the land-blight--
229,I,you have tempted men
230,I,but they perished on your cliffs.
231,I,
232,I,"Your lights are but dank shoals,"
233,I,slate and pebble and wet shells
234,I,and seaweed fastened to the rocks.
235,I,
236,I,It was evil--evil
237,I,"when they found you,"
238,I,when the quiet men looked at you--
239,I,they sought a headland
240,I,shaded with ledge of cliff
241,I,from the wind-blast.
242,I,
243,I,"But you--you are unsheltered,"
244,I,cut with the weight of wind--
245,I,"you shudder when it strikes,"
246,I,"then lift, swelled with the blast--"
247,I,"you sink as the tide sinks,"
248,I,"you shrill under hail, and sound"
249,I,thunder when thunder sounds.
250,I,You are useless--
251,I,when the tides swirl
252,I,your boulders cut and wreck
253,I,the staggering ships.
254,I,

256,II,II
257,II,
258,II,"You are useless,"
259,II,"O grave, O beautiful,"
260,II,the landsmen tell it--I have heard--
261,II,you are useless.
262,II,
263,II,And the wind sounds with this
264,II,and the sea
265,II,where rollers shot with blue
266,II,cut under deeper blue.
267,II,
268,II,"O but stay tender, enchanted"
269,II,where wave-lengths cut you
270,II,apart from all the rest--
271,II,"for we have found you,"
272,II,"we watch the splendour of you,"
273,II,we thread throat on throat of freesia
274,II,for your shelf.
275,II,
276,II,"You are not forgot,"
277,II,"O plunder of lilies,"
278,II,honey is not more sweet
279,II,than the salt stretch of your beach.

281,II,
282,III,III
283,III,
284,III,Stay--stay--
285,III,"but terror has caught us now,"
286,III,"we passed the men in ships,"
287,III,we dared deeper than the fisher-folk
288,III,and you strike us with terror
289,III,O bright shaft.
290,III,
291,III,Flame passes under us
292,III,"and sparks that unknot the flesh,"
293,III,"sorrow, splitting bone from bone,"
294,III,splendour athwart our eyes
295,III,"and rifts in the splendour,"
296,III,sparks and scattered light.
297,III,
298,III,"Many warned of this,"
299,III,men said:
300,III,"there are wrecks on the fore-beach,"
301,III,"wind will beat your ship,"
302,III,"there is no shelter in that headland,"
303,III,"it is useless waste, that edge,"
304,III,that front of rock--
305,III,"sea-gulls clang beyond the breakers,"
306,III,none venture to that spot.
307,III,
308,III,
309,IV,IV
310,IV,
311,IV,But hail--
312,IV,"as the tide slackens,"
313,IV,"as the wind beats out,"
314,IV,we hail this shore--
315,IV,"we sing to you,"
316,IV,spirit between the headlands
317,IV,and the further rocks.
318,IV,
319,IV,"Though oak-beams split,"
320,IV,"though boats and sea-men flounder,"
321,IV,and the strait grind sand with sand
322,IV,and cut boulders to sand and drift--
323,IV,
324,IV,"your eyes have pardoned our faults,"
325,IV,your hands have touched us--
326,IV,you have leaned forward a little
327,IV,and the waves can never thrust us back
328,IV,from the splendour of your ragged coast.

334,MID-DAY,
335,MID-DAY,
336,MID-DAY,The light beats upon me.
337,MID-DAY,I am startled--
338,MID-DAY,a split leaf crackles on the paved floor--
339,MID-DAY,I am anguished--defeated.
340,MID-DAY,
341,MID-DAY,A slight wind shakes the seed-pods--
342,MID-DAY,my thoughts are spent
343,MID-DAY,as the black seeds.
344,MID-DAY,"My thoughts tear me,"
345,MID-DAY,I dread their fever.
346,MID-DAY,I am scattered in its whirl.
347,MID-DAY,I am scattered like
348,MID-DAY,the hot shrivelled seeds.
349,MID-DAY,
350,MID-DAY,The shrivelled seeds
351,MID-DAY,are spilt on the path--
352,MID-DAY,"the grass bends with dust,"
353,MID-DAY,the grape slips
354,MID-DAY,under its crackled leaf:
355,MID-DAY,"yet far beyond the spent seed-pods,"
356,MID-DAY,"and the blackened stalks of mint,"
357,MID-DAY,"the poplar is bright on the hill,"
358,MID-DAY,"the poplar spreads out,"
359,MID-DAY,deep-rooted among trees.
360,MID-DAY,
361,MID-DAY,"O poplar, you are great"
362,MID-DAY,"among the hill-stones,"
363,MID-DAY,while I perish on the path
364,MID-DAY,among the crevices of the rocks.

370,PURSUIT,
371,PURSUIT,
372,PURSUIT,What do I care
373,PURSUIT,"that the stream is trampled,"
374,PURSUIT,the sand on the stream-bank
375,PURSUIT,still holds the print of your foot:
376,PURSUIT,the heel is cut deep.
377,PURSUIT,I see another mark
378,PURSUIT,on the grass ridge of the bank--
379,PURSUIT,it points toward the wood-path.
380,PURSUIT,I have lost the third
381,PURSUIT,in the packed earth.
382,PURSUIT,
383,PURSUIT,But here
384,PURSUIT,a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped:
385,PURSUIT,the purple buds--half ripe--
386,PURSUIT,show deep purple
387,PURSUIT,where your heel pressed.
388,PURSUIT,
389,PURSUIT,"A patch of flowering grass,"
390,PURSUIT,"low, trailing--"
391,PURSUIT,you brushed this:
392,PURSUIT,the green stems show yellow-green
393,PURSUIT,where you lifted--turned the earth-side
394,PURSUIT,to the light:
395,PURSUIT,"this and a dead leaf-spine,"
396,PURSUIT,"split across,"
397,PURSUIT,show where you passed.
398,PURSUIT,
399,PURSUIT,"You were swift, swift!"
400,PURSUIT,here the forest ledge slopes--
401,PURSUIT,rain has furrowed the roots.
402,PURSUIT,Your hand caught at this;
403,PURSUIT,the root snapped under your weight.
404,PURSUIT,
405,PURSUIT,I can almost follow the note
406,PURSUIT,where it touched this slender tree
407,PURSUIT,and the next answered--
408,PURSUIT,and the next.
409,PURSUIT,
410,PURSUIT,And you climbed yet further!
411,PURSUIT,you stopped by the dwarf-cornel--
412,PURSUIT,"whirled on your heels,"
413,PURSUIT,doubled on your track.
414,PURSUIT,
415,PURSUIT,This is clear--
416,PURSUIT,"you fell on the downward slope,"
417,PURSUIT,you dragged a bruised thigh--you limped--
418,PURSUIT,you clutched this larch.
419,PURSUIT,
420,PURSUIT,"Did your head, bent back,"
421,PURSUIT,search further--

443,I,
444,I,Your stature is modelled
445,I,with straight tool-edge:
446,I,you are chiselled like rocks
447,I,that are eaten into by the sea.
448,I,
449,I,With the turn and grasp of your wrist
450,I,"and the chords' stretch,"
451,I,there is a glint like worn brass.
452,I,
453,I,"The ridge of your breast is taut,"
454,I,"and under each the shadow is sharp,"
455,I,and between the clenched muscles
456,I,of your slender hips.
457,I,
458,I,From the circle of your cropped hair
459,I,"there is light,"
460,I,and about your male torse
461,I,and the foot-arch and the straight ankle.

463,I,
464,II,II
465,II,
466,II,You stand rigid and mighty--
467,II,granite and the ore in rocks;
468,II,a great band clasps your forehead
469,II,and its heavy twists of gold.
470,II,
471,II,You are white--a limb of cypress
472,II,bent under a weight of snow.
473,II,
474,II,"You are splendid,"
475,II,your arms are fire;
476,II,you have entered the hill-straits--
477,II,a sea treads upon the hill-slopes.

480,III,III
481,III,
482,III,"Myrtle is about your head,"
483,III,you have bent and caught the spray:

485,III,against the lift and furrow
486,III,of your bound hair.
487,III,
488,III,The narcissus has copied the arch
489,III,of your slight breast:
490,III,"your feet are citron-flowers,"
491,III,"your knees, cut from white-ash,"
492,III,your thighs are rock-cistus.
493,III,
494,III,Your chin lifts straight
495,III,from the hollow of your curved throat.
496,III,Your shoulders are level--
497,III,they have melted rare silver
498,III,for their breadth.

577,THE GIFT,"what is left, what phrase"
578,THE GIFT,after last night? This:
579,THE GIFT,
580,THE GIFT,"The world is yet unspoiled for you,"
581,THE GIFT,"you wait, expectant--"
582,THE GIFT,you are like the children
583,THE GIFT,who haunt your own steps
584,THE GIFT,for chance bits--a comb
585,THE GIFT,"that may have slipped,"
586,THE GIFT,"a gold tassel, unravelled,"
587,THE GIFT,"plucked from your scarf,"
588,THE GIFT,twirled by your slight fingers
589,THE GIFT,into the street--
590,THE GIFT,a flower dropped.
591,THE GIFT,
592,THE GIFT,"Do not think me unaware,"
593,THE GIFT,I who have snatched at you
594,THE GIFT,as the street-child clutched
595,THE GIFT,at the seed-pearls you spilt
596,THE GIFT,that hot day
597,THE GIFT,when your necklace snapped.

599,THE GIFT,Do not dream that I speak
600,THE GIFT,"as one defrauded of delight,"
601,THE GIFT,"sick, shaken by each heart-beat"
602,THE GIFT,"or paralyzed, stretched at length,"
603,THE GIFT,who gasps:
604,THE GIFT,these ripe pears
605,THE GIFT,"are bitter to the taste,"
606,THE GIFT,"this spiced wine, poison, corrupt."
607,THE GIFT,I cannot walk--
608,THE GIFT,who would walk?
609,THE GIFT,Life is a scavenger's pit--I escape--
610,THE GIFT,"I only, rejecting it,"
611,THE GIFT,lying here on this couch.
612,THE GIFT,
613,THE GIFT,"Your garden sloped to the beach,"
614,THE GIFT,"myrtle overran the paths,"
615,THE GIFT,"honey and amber flecked each leaf,"
616,THE GIFT,the citron-lily head--
617,THE GIFT,one among many--
618,THE GIFT,"weighed there, over-sweet."

621,THE GIFT,"spread across low slopes,"

629,THE GIFT,"Sleepless nights,"
630,THE GIFT,"I remember the initiates,"
631,THE GIFT,"their gesture, their calm glance."
632,THE GIFT,"I have heard how in rapt thought,"
633,THE GIFT,"in vision, they speak"
634,THE GIFT,"with another race,"
635,THE GIFT,"more beautiful, more intense than this."
636,THE GIFT,I could laugh--
637,THE GIFT,"more beautiful, more intense?"
638,THE GIFT,
639,THE GIFT,Perhaps that other life
640,THE GIFT,is contrast always to this.
641,THE GIFT,I reason:
642,THE GIFT,I have lived as they
643,THE GIFT,in their inmost rites--
644,THE GIFT,they endure the tense nerves
645,THE GIFT,through the moment of ritual.
646,THE GIFT,I endure from moment to moment--
647,THE GIFT,"days pass all alike,"
648,THE GIFT,"tortured, intense."
649,THE GIFT,
650,THE GIFT,This I forgot last night:
651,THE GIFT,"you must not be blamed,"
652,THE GIFT,it is not your fault;
653,THE GIFT,"as a child, a flower--any flower"
654,THE GIFT,tore my breast--
655,THE GIFT,"meadow-chicory, a common grass-tip,"
656,THE GIFT,"a leaf shadow, a flower tint"
657,THE GIFT,unexpected on a winter-branch.
658,THE GIFT,
659,THE GIFT,I reason:
660,THE GIFT,"another life holds what this lacks,"
661,THE GIFT,"a sea, unmoving, quiet--"
662,THE GIFT,not forcing our strength
663,THE GIFT,"to rise to it, beat on beat--"
664,THE GIFT,"stretch of sand,"
665,THE GIFT,"no garden beyond, strangling"
666,THE GIFT,with its myrrh-lilies--
667,THE GIFT,"a hill, not set with black violets"
668,THE GIFT,"but stones, stones, bare rocks,"
669,THE GIFT,"dwarf-trees, twisted, no beauty"
670,THE GIFT,to distract--to crowd
671,THE GIFT,madness upon madness.
672,THE GIFT,
673,THE GIFT,Only a still place
674,THE GIFT,and perhaps some outer horror
675,THE GIFT,"some hideousness to stamp beauty,"
676,THE GIFT,a mark--no changing it now--
677,THE GIFT,on our hearts.
678,THE GIFT,
679,THE GIFT,"I send no string of pearls,"
680,THE GIFT,no bracelet--accept this.

692,EVENING,under the light
693,EVENING,grow faint--

695,EVENING,the blue tips bend
696,EVENING,toward the bluer heart
697,EVENING,and the flowers are lost.
698,EVENING,
699,EVENING,"The cornel-buds are still white,"

703,EVENING,each leaf

722,SHELTERED GARDEN,"or find the same slope on the other side,"
723,SHELTERED GARDEN,precipitate.
724,SHELTERED GARDEN,

735,SHELTERED GARDEN,
736,SHELTERED GARDEN,Have you seen fruit under cover
737,SHELTERED GARDEN,that wanted light--
738,SHELTERED GARDEN,"pears wadded in cloth,"
739,SHELTERED GARDEN,"protected from the frost,"
740,SHELTERED GARDEN,"melons, almost ripe,"
741,SHELTERED GARDEN,smothered in straw?
742,SHELTERED GARDEN,

750,SHELTERED GARDEN,to fall at last but fair

752,SHELTERED GARDEN,

1555,CITIES,Can we believe--by an effort
1556,CITIES,comfort our hearts:
1557,CITIES,"it is not waste all this,"
1558,CITIES,"not placed here in disgust,"
1559,CITIES,"street after street,"
1560,CITIES,"each patterned alike,"
1561,CITIES,no grace to lighten
1562,CITIES,a single house of the hundred

1564,CITIES,
1565,CITIES,"Crowded--can we believe,"
1566,CITIES,"not in utter disgust,"
1567,CITIES,in ironical play--
1568,CITIES,but the maker of cities grew faint
1569,CITIES,with the beauty of temple
1570,CITIES,"and space before temple,"
1571,CITIES,"arch upon perfect arch,"

1577,CITIES,
1578,CITIES,That the maker of cities grew faint

1593,CITIES,
1594,CITIES,"So he built a new city,"
1595,CITIES,"ah can we believe, not ironically"
1596,CITIES,but for new splendour
1597,CITIES,constructed new people
1598,CITIES,to lift through slow growth
1599,CITIES,to a beauty unrivalled yet--
1600,CITIES,"and created new cells,"

1624,CITIES,We are spread through this earth.
1625,CITIES,We protect our strong race.
1626,CITIES,You are useless.
1627,CITIES,Your cell takes the place
1628,CITIES,of our young future strength.
1629,CITIES,
1630,CITIES,Though they sleep or wake to torment
1631,CITIES,and wish to displace our old cells--
1632,CITIES,thin rare gold--

1635,CITIES,
