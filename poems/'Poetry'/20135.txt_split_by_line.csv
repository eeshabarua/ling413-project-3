53,PREFACE.,
54,PREFACE.,"The original, of which this is a translation, is universally considered"
55,PREFACE.,one of the very best among many beautiful poems written by the same
56,PREFACE.,"illustrious author. The sublime didactic thoughts therein expressed, in"
57,PREFACE.,"language majestic and yet so simple, have won for it a constantly"
58,PREFACE.,"increasing popularity; and, during half a century, in a language so rich"
59,PREFACE.,"in literary beauties as the Swedish, have maintained it among the"
60,PREFACE.,foremost of poetical productions of its kind.
61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,"A correct English translation, therefore, is fraught with difficulties"
63,PREFACE.,which but few persons can appreciate. It has been my aim to reproduce
64,PREFACE.,"the poem in the original meter, with the rhymes in their proper places."
65,PREFACE.,"Of course, care has been taken to preserve the sense, and even the"
66,PREFACE.,_idioms_ of the original. How far I have been successful it is hardly
67,PREFACE.,"for me to say. As it is, I give it to the reading public."
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,The poem has undoubted merits in the original. If the merits are
70,PREFACE.,"concealed in the translation, the fault is mine."

80,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Sweden.
81,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
82,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
83,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Johan Olof Wallin, (pronounced Valleen), the author of the ""ANGEL OF"
84,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"DEATH,"" was a native of Sweden, and was born in the parish of Stora"
85,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Tuna, in the province of Dalarne (Dalecarlia), October 15, 1779. His"
86,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"father was a military man, and some time after Johan's birth became"
87,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,captain of the Dalecarlia regiment. The future poet and preacher was one
88,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"of a large family, much larger than accorded well with the somewhat"
89,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,restricted means of the captain of a regiment.
90,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
91,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"At a very early age, young Johan evinced a taste for books, and for"
92,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,study generally; but the circumstances of his family were not such as to
93,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,encourage the hope of an academic career. As has often happened in such
94,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"circumstances, the talents of the boy commanded attention; and he was"
95,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,not left without a good primary education. At the early age of thirteen
96,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"he began to help himself; and, by taking part in the education of"
97,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"others, he contrived to prolong his own studies, and acquired great"
98,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"proficiency in the classics, especially in Latin. When only seventeen"
99,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"years of age, he made his first public appearance at the Gymnasium of"
100,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Westerås, and by the delivery of a poetical speech in Latin--a speech"
101,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,which is still preserved and which is remarkable for its literary
102,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,merits--he astonished all his seniors. Henceforth Johan Olof Wallin was
103,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,a marked man among his contemporaries.
104,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
105,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"It was not long after this triumph at the Gymnasium, that young Wallin"
106,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,felt discouraged for the want of funds. It was now desirable that he
107,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,should give himself to the higher department of study under competent
108,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"teachers; but money was needed, and he knew not where to find it. In his"
109,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"difficulty he felt strongly tempted to give up his studies, and to give"
110,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"himself to his father's profession. His delicate health, however, stood"
111,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"in the way; and, happily, a serviceable situation as teacher having"
112,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"offered itself, he was saved to literature. In the fall of 1799, after a"
113,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"most creditable examination, he was entered as student at the Upsala"
114,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Academy. His career as a student was marked by great success, especially"
115,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"in literature and philosophy; and, in 1803, he took his Doctor's degree."
116,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"In the same year, he obtained a prize from the Swedish Academy,[A] for"
117,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,poetical translations of four of the Odes of Horace. Wallin was now in
118,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,his twenty-fourth year.
119,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
120,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Encouraged by success, Johan tried the Academy again, and was successful"
121,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"in carrying off, in one session, three prizes, the largest number ever"
122,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"before awarded to one person, at one anniversary. One of them was the"
123,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"""Grand Prize,"" and was awarded to a poem, called ""The Educator."" Some of"
124,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,the lines give promise of the temple-orator that was to be:
125,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
126,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"""Thou sentinel on high! Will night not vanish soon?"
127,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,We doubt the sheen of stars and quiet path of moon;
128,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,We placed our trust in Thee. Enlight the races striving!
129,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Will night yet long endure? Is morning's watch arriving.""[B]"
130,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
131,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Other poems followed. By this time, Johan, who had, from an early"
132,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"period, shown a liking for the clerical profession, had passed all his"
133,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"preliminary examinations with honors, and been ordained to the pastoral"
134,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"office. He commanded attention, at once, as a preacher. But he clung to"
135,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"the muses, or the muses clung to him; and his lyre, having been tuned in"
136,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"harmony with his sacred calling, he soon began to distinguish himself as"
137,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,a writer of hymns. Some of the finest hymns of which the Swedish
138,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"language can boast, are from the pen of Johan Olof Wallin. Nor were"
139,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"secular themes wholly neglected. On January 20, 1808, on the occasion of"
140,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"the unveiling of the statue of King Gustavus Third, he produced the"
141,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"famous Dithyramb, a song which has taken a permanent and honored place"
142,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,in Swedish literature. The same year he presented a similar poem to the
143,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Swedish Academy, and was rewarded with a prize of two hundred ducats,"
144,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,the highest prize ever given by the Academy.
145,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
146,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"In all great questions of a national or international character, Wallin"
147,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"took a deep and lively interest; and the powerful influence, which he"
148,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"exerted with tongue and pen, was always wielded in favor of the right."
149,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,How well he knew how to seize upon and turn to account existing
150,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"circumstances and passing events, is strikingly illustrated by his poem"
151,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,on George Washington; his Dithyramb celebrating the union of Sweden and
152,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Norway, and his splendid ode on the victories of the allies at Leipzig,"
153,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Dennewitz and Grossbeeren. The last named composition had an immense
154,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,success; and it was circulated by thousands among the soldiers of the
155,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Swedish army abroad.
156,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
157,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Wallin was at home in the region of sublime and lofty thought; but his
158,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"muse was not one-sided, or in any sense monotonous. Poems of a calm,"
159,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"reflective character flowed gracefully from his pen; and, when occasion"
160,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"called for the one or the other, he revealed rich veins of satire and"
161,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"humor. One great secret of his literary success, both as a poet and"
162,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"preacher, lay in the simplicity of his style. With him there was never"
163,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"any striving after effect. His thoughts, whether of a lofty or"
164,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"commonplace character, whether hortatory or didactic, whether satirical"
165,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"or humorous, always found natural and easy expression in language which"
166,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,was as direct as it was graceful and easily understood.
167,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
168,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"At the comparatively early age of thirty years, Wallin had taken his"
169,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,place in the front rank of the scholars and public men of his day; and
170,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"whatever honors were in the gift of his admiring countrymen, were freely"
171,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,showered upon him. Of these honors we mention only a few.
172,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
173,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"In 1810, he was elected a member of the Swedish Academy; and on several"
174,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,occasions he was raised by acclamation to the proud position of chairman
175,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"and orator of that learned body. In 1815, he was made Knight of the"
176,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Royal Order of the North Star; and in the same year he became Dom-prost,"
177,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"an office next in order to the Bishop's, and was honored with a seat in"
178,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Parliament. In 1818, he was made Pastor Primarius, and President of the"
179,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Consistory of Stockholm; and about this time he became an active and
180,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"useful member of the Royal Musical Academy. In 1824, he was raised to"
181,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"the dignity of Bishop of the Church, and became commander of the Royal"
182,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Order of the North Star and honorary member of the Royal Academy of
183,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Literature, History and Antiquities. Of this high body he was four times"
184,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"elected Chairman. In 1828, he was elected member of the Royal Academy of"
185,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Sciences; ten years later he was made Praeses. In 1830, he was elected"
186,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Court Preacher, and Praeses or President of the Royal Consistory. In"
187,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"1837, his honors culminated. He was elected a member of the Upsala"
188,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,association for the promotion of Science; also member of the Serafimer
189,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Order, a distinction rarely conferred except on royal persons and"
190,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"princes of the blood, when he adopted as his motto, ""In Omnipotenti"
191,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Vinces."" In the same year, he became archbishop of Sweden and"
192,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,pro-chancellor of the University of Upsala.
193,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
194,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"The ""ANGEL OF DEATH,"" singularly characteristic of the author,"
195,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,immediately after its publication took its place in the front rank of
196,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,the poetic productions of the language. The poem has never ceased to be
197,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"popular. It is issued each successive year in thousands, and in all"
198,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"sorts of editions,--some of the recent _editions de luxe_ are marvels of"
199,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"costly taste and typographic skill. His poetic productions are numerous,"
200,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"and they are all of a high order of merit. The ""ANGEL OF DEATH,"""
201,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"however, partly on account of the undying interest of the subject, and"
202,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"partly, also, because of its bold and daring thought and vigorous"
203,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"expression, is that by which he is best known, and with which his name"
204,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,is destined to be indissolubly linked.
205,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
206,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Wallin is remembered as a great churchman, as well as scholar and poet."
207,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"As a preacher, he had few if any equals. Of dignified aspect, gifted"
208,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"with a rich sonorous voice, and visibly impressed at all times with the"
209,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"solemn character of his mission, he presented the very ideal of the"
210,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"pulpiteer; and, whenever and wherever he appeared, he was attended by"
211,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,admiring crowds composed of all ranks and classes of the people.[C] As
212,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"a hymn-writer he had also great success; and to his taste and skill, the"
213,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Swedish Church is indebted for its finest collection of sacred songs.[D]
214,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"How gracefully Tegner refers to him in his poem, ""The Children of the"
215,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Lord's Supper,"" every reader of Longfellow is well aware:"
216,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
217,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"""Hark! then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ,"
218,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Hover like voices from God, aloft like invisible spirits;"
219,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Like as Elias in heaven, when he cast from off him his mantle,"
220,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"So cast off the soul its garment of earth, and with one voice,"
221,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Chimed in the congregation, and sang _an anthem immortal"
222,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Of the sublime Wallin, of David's Harp in the North-land_."""
223,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
224,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"For thirty-one years, Wallin occupied a place, prouder, in many"
225,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"respects, than the Swedish throne itself,--recognized and honored by his"
226,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"countrymen as their greatest scholar, their greatest preacher, and one"
227,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"of their greatest poets. In June, 1839, in his sixtieth year, the angel"
228,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"of death, of whom he had written so well, approached him with his sad"
229,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"summons; and, amid the regrets and sorrows of a whole nation, his lofty"
230,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"spirit took its flight to those purer regions, in which, in imagination,"
231,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,it already long had dwelt. He was buried in the new cemetery in
232,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Stockholm, which he himself had consecrated; and his grave is adorned"
233,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,with a large and appropriate monument.
234,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
235,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"At the first anniversary meeting of the Swedish Academy, after his"
236,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"death, Bishop Tegner read a memorial poem highly eulogistic of the"
237,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"deceased, and which ended as follows:"
238,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
239,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"""And, tire, as it speeds along,"
240,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,The lightly flying Swedish song;
241,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Then let its weary wings be rested,"
242,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,Against thy grave--and soar anew
243,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"To starry realms again, to you,"
244,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"With prestige by the Learned Circle vested,"
245,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"Thou bard like few! Prime speaker uncontested!""[E]"
246,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
247,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"[Footnote A: The Swedish Academy is composed of eighteen men, selected"
248,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"from among the most learned and literary men of the country, and is the"
249,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,highest tribunal to pass upon the merits of poetical essays and works of
250,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"literature in general; and the very fact, that a person has been awarded"
251,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"a prize by this Academy, is alone sufficient to insure for him an"
252,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,imperishable name in the annals of Swedish literature.]

261,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
262,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,[Footnote C: His great popularity with the masses naturally caused them
263,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"to apply to him for all sorts of information and advice, with full"
264,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,confidence that he knew how to assist and advise in all matters. As an
265,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"example of his oft peculiar way of treating queer questions, and yet"
266,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"satisfying the questioner, the following may be related: For about"
267,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,twenty years a number of writs and fore-tellings had frightened
268,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,credulous people with the prediction that the world would perish on a
269,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,certain given date. As the time drew near that date Wallin was besieged
270,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,for information as to the validity of the said prediction. To the
271,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"constantly repeated question, ""Is it true, Bishop, that the world shall"
272,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"perish on Thursday?"" Wallin had always the same answer: ""Please call"
273,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"again on Friday, and I will let you know."" The questioner withdrew"
274,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,consoled.]
275,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,
276,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,[Footnote D: Wallin not only revised completely the old hymn-book of the
277,BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.,"church, but composed a very large number of the divinely beautiful and"
