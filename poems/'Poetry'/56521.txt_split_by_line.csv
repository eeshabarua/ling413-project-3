794,THE BARMECIDES.,"And making a low tinkling sound,"
795,THE BARMECIDES.,"As sliding down from mound to mound,"
796,THE BARMECIDES.,They did at last their courses take
797,THE BARMECIDES.,"Down to a calm and lucid lake,"
798,THE BARMECIDES.,"By which, on gently sloping height,"
799,THE BARMECIDES.,There stood a palace of delight;
800,THE BARMECIDES.,"And many slaves, but all of rare"
801,THE BARMECIDES.,"And perfect beauty, marshalled there,"

810,THE BARMECIDES.,"I falling, thanks would render meet."
811,THE BARMECIDES.,"He, scarcely listening, turned his head,"

815,THE BARMECIDES.,"That he should call them his;—my son,"

823,THE BARMECIDES.,"What shall there, the meanwhile, be done?’"
824,THE BARMECIDES.,"He turned unto his younger son,"

830,THE BARMECIDES.,"And done, anon they took their leave,"

832,THE BARMECIDES.,The wonders of my novel state.
833,THE BARMECIDES.,
834,THE BARMECIDES.,"“Prince of the faithful, mighty King,"

2703,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,"patience to finish this “narrische Talmudische Fabel,” as he styles"
2704,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,"it. It reappears, slightly modified, in the Persian tradition, according"
2705,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,"to which Alexander, having conquered the world, determined"
2706,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,to seek out the fountain of life. See the following note. In
2707,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,"like manner, in the Christian poems of the middle ages, Alexander"
2708,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,is made to recognise at last the vanity and emptiness of all the

2712,ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.,"notable is this making of Alexander, and no other—the man from"

2726,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"Of Chidher’s Well, the Eastern λουτρον παλιγγενεσιας, Von"
2727,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"Hammer, in his very interesting introduction to his “History of"
2728,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"Persian Poetry,” gives a good account. Among other things"
2729,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"he says, “Cotemporary with Moses lived the Prophet Chiser, of"
2730,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"whom some hold that he is the same with Elias, while others"
2731,CHIDHER’S WELL.,altogether distinguish them. He is one of the chief personages of
2732,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"Eastern Mythology, the ever-ready helper of the oppressed, the"
2733,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"Genius of spring, the deliverer in peril, the admonisher of princes,"
2734,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"the avenger of unrighteousness, the guide through the wilderness"
2735,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"of the world, and, finally, the ever-youthful guardian of the fountain"
2736,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"of life. As such he revives the youth of men, and beasts,"
2737,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"and plants, gives back lost beauty, and in spring arrays the dead"
2738,CHIDHER’S WELL.,earth with its fresh garments of green. His fountain bestows on
2739,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"whosoever drinks it eternal beauty, youth, and wisdom. What"
2740,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"wonder then that all mortals with burning desire seek it, though"
2741,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"as yet not one, not even Alexander, the conqueror of the world,"
2742,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"who, in quest of it, undertook an expedition into the land of darkness,"
2743,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"has found it!” Probably this, his journey through the land"
2744,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"of darkness, is but a mythic form of his expedition through the"
2745,CHIDHER’S WELL.,Libyan desert to the temple of Jupiter Ammon.
2746,CHIDHER’S WELL.,
2747,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"On this poem I may observe, that it is the first of several in"

2749,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"to the English reader, which yet is that of a great part, as I"
2750,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"believe, of the lyric poetry of the East, and which may not, perhaps,"
2751,CHIDHER’S WELL.,be unworthy of a place among us. According to the laws
2752,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"of the Ghazel,—for poems in this metre are so entitled,—the two"
2753,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"first lines must rhyme, and then this rhyme repeats itself in the"
2754,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"second line of each succeeding couplet, which is, in fact, a new"
2755,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"stanza, till the end of the poem,—the termination of the first line"
2756,CHIDHER’S WELL.,in each of these following couplets being left free. This single
2757,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"rule of the one repeated rhyme being observed, the Ghazel admits"
2758,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"otherwise of the greatest possible variety; it may be composed, as"
2759,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"is this present, in short trochaics, in longer or shorter iambics, or,"
2760,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"in fact, in lines of whatsoever length or arrangement of syllables"
2761,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"the poet will. In Germany, the Ghazel has been perfectly"
2762,CHIDHER’S WELL.,"domesticated. Rückert and Count Platen are, I believe, considered"
2763,CHIDHER’S WELL.,to have cultivated it with the greatest success.

2819,THE EASTERN NARCISSUS.,account of the manner in which he was converted to the life of
2820,THE EASTERN NARCISSUS.,contemplative piety is remarkable. He was originally a rich merchant
2821,THE EASTERN NARCISSUS.,of spices. A pious dervisch entered his warehouse and craved

5825,THE OIL OF MERCY.,They constitute indeed one of the richest portions of what may
5826,THE OIL OF MERCY.,without offence be termed the Mythology of the Christian Church.
5827,THE OIL OF MERCY.,That which I have followed here is given in the “Evangelium
5828,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"Nicodemi,” c. 19. See Thilo’s “Codex Apocryphus,” v. i. p. 684."
5829,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"In the “Recognitions” of Clement, l. 1, c. 45, an Ebionite book,"
5830,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"and therefore only acknowledging the humanity of Christ, he is,"
5831,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"consistently with this view, said, not himself to anoint, but to"
5832,THE OIL OF MERCY.,have been anointed with the oil from the Tree of Life. The
5833,THE OIL OF MERCY.,connexion between the Tree of Life and the Cross of Christ has
5834,THE OIL OF MERCY.,been twice wrought up into sublime dramatic poems by Calderon;
5835,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"once in his Auto, entitled “El Arbor del mejor Fruto;” and"
5836,THE OIL OF MERCY.,again in that which is indeed only the same poem in a later and
5837,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"more perfect form, “La Sibila del Oriente.” We have the same"
5838,THE OIL OF MERCY.,tradition of Seth going to the gates of Paradise in the fine old
5839,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"Cornish Mystery of “The Creation of the World,” which was"
5840,THE OIL OF MERCY.,lately published with an English translation; and allusions to it
5841,THE OIL OF MERCY.,are frequent in all the popular literature of the Middle Ages;
5842,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"see, for instance, Göthe’s recension of the “Reineke Fuchs,”"
5843,THE OIL OF MERCY.,near the beginning of the tenth book; and I remember a curious
5844,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"passage about it in Mandeville’s “Travels.” Rückert, in the"
5845,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"following poem, has given the tradition in somewhat a different"
5846,THE OIL OF MERCY.,shape.
5847,THE OIL OF MERCY.,
5848,THE OIL OF MERCY.,I may just observe that this poem is an attempt—I will confess
5849,THE OIL OF MERCY.,a most unsuccessful one—to write English verse in the Spanish
5850,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"assonant rhyme, of which the principle is, that words are considered"
5851,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"to rhyme which have the same vowel-sounds, though the"
5852,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"consonants are different: thus, _angel_ and _raiment_ having the"
5853,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"same vowel-sounds, _a—e_, are perfect assonant rhymes. As in"
5854,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"the Persian Ghazel, there is but one rhyme running through the"
5855,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"whole poem, and in this all the alternate lines, beginning with"
5856,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"the second, terminate: and of course the rhythmical effect of the"
5857,THE OIL OF MERCY.,"poem is to be judged, not by any half-dozen lines apart, but by"
5858,THE OIL OF MERCY.,the total impression which the whole Poem continuously read
5859,THE OIL OF MERCY.,leaves on the ear.
