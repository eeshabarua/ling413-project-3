13,VOLUME TWO,Passage Of His Reign : 
14,VOLUME TWO,Supple youth gambols with fresh breeze. Fledgling seeds sprout first roots. First light flickers from the horizon. Winds  blow with a shrill. His reign is ascending. 
15,VOLUME TWO,Seasoned vigour reads the seasons. Roots rush to claim its share of the earth. Torch of day hangs midway at meridian's hour. Winds howl deeply. His reign at its apex. 
16,VOLUME TWO,What was once a peak is now a plain. The next crest yields a basin of troughs. Howling winds bewray cracks. 
17,VOLUME TWO,Ripe form moves with care. Old roots are gnarled. Light of day  is a humble blend of glow and grey. Winds howl at slurred pace. His reign at its ebb. 8>) 
18,VOLUME TWO,No. 14 : 
19,VOLUME TWO,He's been up and over the hill He's lost the horizon He can't see the end to his plateau limbo 
20,VOLUME TWO,The parade of younger generations excite him they do not he knows the game the tools have long changed he a hapless victim of the course of regulations which write off able bodied people on set biological years not on account of physical decline 
21,VOLUME TWO,He wastes away He's been up and over the hill Bereft of direction He's lost the horizon which guided previous phases of his life 
22,VOLUME TWO,A man in retirement without lifelong passion outside the sphere of his career hastens his own decline He can't see the end to his plateau limbo 8>) 
23,VOLUME TWO,Worth Of Say : 
24,VOLUME TWO,"Everybody's worth of say heard in haunts you roam Someone else's worth of say overheard as you flit by It's not your worth of say while you stand, watch and wait You want your worth of say before pale flag's hoisted the towel thrown "
25,VOLUME TWO,Everybody's worth of say in each twist of rhetoric Someone else's worth of say you cannot see your name It's not your worth of say you haven't spoken yet You want your worth of say before the heart's lost the daredevils retire 
26,VOLUME TWO,Everybody's worth of say as you glean the scene Someone else's worth of say while you keep your peace It's not your worth of say when others speak their mind You want your worth of say before the flames flake the embers melt 8>) 
27,VOLUME TWO,Illustration Of Melancholy: 
28,VOLUME TWO,"'I saw your face , It was clouded by smoke I grasped the smoke, and inhaled despair Was I too late ? Am I just in time for one last remorse and to scream myself hoarse robbed of the thrill of a dare The wheels turn with a broken spoke ' 8>) "
29,VOLUME TWO,For A Friend's Recovery : 
30,VOLUME TWO,My heart leaps at your recovery Peaks and troughs you did scale Ease towards hearty and hale Soon you'll return to normalcy 8>) 
31,VOLUME TWO,Progeny : 
32,VOLUME TWO,Flesh of one's flesh Blood of one's blood nature and learning mesh where two create a third 8>) 
33,VOLUME TWO,I'm Leaving : 
34,VOLUME TWO,Goodbye there's a pensive stillness A short while to reflect the jolt There's a blithe smile of carelessness A short pause to fasten the bolt 8>) 
35,VOLUME TWO,Action Required : 
36,VOLUME TWO,Thoughts that lodge in me should I bolt them and forget ? should I say them and release ? this quandary baits me with a jerk of regret 
37,VOLUME TWO,Questions play within me should I price their logic ? should I leave them be ? this quandary baits me with care I am to pick 
38,VOLUME TWO,Resolve swells in me I should heed apprehension ! I should calm uncertainty ! the last stroke awaits me with an expectation 8>) 
39,VOLUME TWO,Little One's Hope : 
40,VOLUME TWO,Your tiny feet stumble and knees buckle yet you walk with outstretched arms Your hands grapple at awkward angles yet you come with curious arms Child of hope and child of trust Shape your future with our past 8>) 
41,VOLUME TWO,A Toast To Thee : 
42,VOLUME TWO,"though the distance for miles swell much from Fortune we can't tell savour rewards and joys we had while sweat and toil made us prepared your quests ahead, I wish you well 8>) "
43,VOLUME TWO,Whimsical Verse : 
44,VOLUME TWO,There was a lady of wavy long tresses who pined for short locks of hair so to her wish she one day addresses and was delighted by a sight so fair! 8>)

49,VOLUME TWO,The World Turns : 
50,VOLUME TWO,for as long as the world turns there'll be cause to go on along its twists and turns from night to new morn sparks alight where fire burns warm embraces and cold spurns events that press us upon when cause and effect churns while hopes and chances spawn sadness and joy have their turns there'll be cause to go on for as long as the world turns 8>) 
51,VOLUME TWO,Pricey Temptation : 
52,VOLUME TWO,Sell us your finest finery To cheer up lively livery the earthly passing passions tempt with comely compulsions 8>) 
53,VOLUME TWO,Your Move : 
54,VOLUME TWO,where does your heart lie ? when it must be true ? the hard questions they pry and they are now due ! 
55,VOLUME TWO,to salvation where you're cleansed ? or reap damnation of recompense ? judge and make fateful choice foolish plunge or righteous poise ! 8>) 
56,VOLUME TWO,Restless Reckless : 
57,VOLUME TWO,Mesh of contradictions with likely predilections flirting with chance in a worldly prance 
58,VOLUME TWO,Providence queried with questions varied in a rush hurried of temper unburied 
59,VOLUME TWO,Toasts to eventuality with a toss of probability come fame or infamy taunts decreed mortality 8>) 
60,VOLUME TWO,Three Thoughts at Three Paces : 
61,VOLUME TWO,1 For what is a lavish bauble but sight to behold and marvel ? It cares not how you fare merely a trinket to compare ? 
62,VOLUME TWO,"2 Mock not the spartan or ornate swiftly in haste or in debate With stealth change alters priorities makes necessary, luxuries makes luxuries, necessities A restless evolving state fills or wipes a slate "
63,VOLUME TWO,3 Spare traders of things necessary for their lack of tasteful grace Their use and place have longevity with wares to ease passing days 8>) 
64,VOLUME TWO,Some Questions(while Hope still waits) : 1 Will sworn foes swear anew be seated on common pew ? though far easier to renounce strangers bad blood among same blood breeds dangers 
65,VOLUME TWO,2 Will sworn foes swear anew be seated on common pew ? or will peace be only enforced when each choose a separate course ? 
66,VOLUME TWO,3 Will sworn foes swear anew be seated on common pew ? or must ill churn till last breath with no certainty but death ? 
67,VOLUME TWO,"4 By own accord, jettison pride Courage on a limb, bare one's hide If sincerity resides on each side... "
68,VOLUME TWO,5 Will sworn foes swear anew be seated on common pew ? if oaths can be retaken can they embrace as brethren ? 8>) 
69,VOLUME TWO,Passing Days : 
70,VOLUME TWO,Cry for joy and sorrow Yet lay hope for morrow Lift that blanket over you Till grass is wet with dew Lift your head to a new morn you'll be long way from forlorn greet sunrise with relish bid sunset with a wish 8>) 
71,VOLUME TWO,A Year Of Changes : 
72,VOLUME TWO,A year of welcomes and partings short jaunts and long meanderings of prosaic and verse wanderings sustained efforts and constant dartings 
73,VOLUME TWO,A year of comings and goings sure-footed steps and trippings swift stirrings and quiet mullings along known paths and new turnings 8>) 
74,VOLUME TWO,Another Round(for my friends) : 
75,VOLUME TWO,Wishing you joys plenty and setbacks few Like the seasonal changes right on cue Friendship true cloys not but breathes anew Bursting with good faith and goodness due 8>) 
76,VOLUME TWO,Eight Lines : 
77,VOLUME TWO,Things said are said fully Deeds done are done truly There shan't be lies to grieve If truth is like a sieve 
78,VOLUME TWO,When wits are matched Our minds are lighted When sins are hatched Our joys are blighted 8>) 
79,VOLUME TWO,Dose Of Happiness : 
80,VOLUME TWO,Feast on meals healthy and hearty moods brightened by fair company amidst weather fine and agreeable chosen activities are feasible with pleasant and peaceful repose awashed with life's joyful dose 8>) 
81,VOLUME TWO,Under The Influence : 
82,VOLUME TWO,Resolute we are to mark treasures with length and breadth of finite measures as if their expanse explains indulgence where passion and devotion fuse at confluence 8>) 
83,VOLUME TWO,Grant Me A Moment : 
84,VOLUME TWO,Grant me a moment its tarrying worth so I may savour my own lingering that later at length I could with mirth dub it a spell apt for remembering 8>) 
85,VOLUME TWO,The Best Seat : 
86,VOLUME TWO,Seated amongst fondest of friends I took my place with much relish there's truth that happiness depends on presence of those we cherish 8>) 
87,VOLUME TWO,Simple Worship : 
88,VOLUME TWO,"Elaborate rituals and traditions serve to lengthen the divide between what believers wish to state and supposed obligations that come with prayers.More often than not, such rituals are man-made rules meant to lend mystical, mysterious air to worship. In fact how we worship is as bare knuckles as simple sincerity. "
89,VOLUME TWO,Rituals and traditions do not enhance spiritual health of the faithful.They prolong the physical manifestation of worshipping taken to (at times)zealous and elitist degree. It bewilders those who approach religion with the aim of simple worship and sincere intimations. The imposition of man-made strictures and selfish interpretations magnifies the measure of spiritual desolation and logical confusion when welcome and solace are sought. 
90,VOLUME TWO,"It is hurtful and spiritually repulsive to have a monk, priest or medium severely chastise a worshipper for menial violations, made out of ignorance, for the common people are not as well schooled in so-called religious conventions. It is their duty to guide and courtesy to instruct. No believer and worshipper comes with willful intent to cause sacrilege. That goes against the purpose and effort of one's presence. Again, it is caused by the imposition of rituals and ceremony which causes the divide. "
91,VOLUME TWO,"A believer comes, settles in a prayerful pose and speaks one's heart, spills worries, mentions cares and wishes hopes for the numerous tomorrows ahead. It is a simple affirmation of faith and a private conversation with the Maker. What transpires in every session is a mutual secret between believer and Divine. A simple act that can be replicated at home in the confines of the room. 8>) "
92,VOLUME TWO,Savage Civilization : 
93,VOLUME TWO,"Known civilization was once overrun by wild tribes. Humanity once again threatens itself; by overrunning itself from within. When decency becomes an underground outlawed movement, if civilization glorifies its own demise and luxuriates in the stream of crumbling plaster and concrete, that is when the very term 'civilization' becomes a meaningless warble of groans. "
94,VOLUME TWO,"Before this desperate nightmare transmutes into hopeless reality, we need to pinch ourselves and come to our senses by putting our chaotic house in order. We are our own worst enemy and our likeliest saviour. 8>) "
95,VOLUME TWO,Raindrops : 
96,VOLUME TWO,"Those who plan to go on foot bide time till lashing water slackens its vehemence upon the earth. Overfed sod forms mud puddles. Drenched concrete turn shades darker. Windows and screens are glazed with hazy film. Droplets streak randomly along crooked paths, from the steepest incline to the base. Trails of clear watery streaks slice through round and oval drops , speedily and decisively, like drunken comets. 8>) "
97,VOLUME TWO,Circumstantial Standpoint : 
98,VOLUME TWO,"It's nothing but circumstances between us. Circumstances determine who orders the charge and who charges, who lords over all and who the servants are, who rests atop pedestals and who shoulder their weight, who stands on the rostrum and who stand on the plains. "
99,VOLUME TWO,"Mere circumstances divide us. They determine who bears the moral responsibility, who does or refrain from the deed, those who are garbed and crowned with honour , those besmirched with infamy. "
100,VOLUME TWO,"It's nothing but circumstances between us. Their plot is such that there are those who are heralds, those who are heralded and those who are unheralded masses. Mere circumstances stretch and fill possibilities within the circumstantial spectrum. 8>) "
101,VOLUME TWO,Just Passing By : 
102,VOLUME TWO,"Questions and reality of mortality meet us head on. They are inescapable in this mortal sphere. With each experience we grow towards maturity and acceptance of the frailties of the flesh in Life's autumn. Mortality steps on our plate. It comes with mounting frequency. Rising generations. Receding elders. They meet , then one of them become recollection. 8>) "
103,VOLUME TWO,Workers Of The Land : 
104,VOLUME TWO,"Let's turn our plaudits from urbane beings to workers of the land. Ever so often overlooked in this age of metropolis. Their handiwork beget sustenance which we require to sustain life and maintain our well being. The country's produce douses bothers of hunger, satiates palates. Their bread and butter , our bread and butter. Workers of the land, at times contemned, dismissed as simpletons. Give them their due. Short change them not with regard. The earth had been generous to them when our tongues were miserly. Workers of the land, nurtured by the earth and they nurture the earth in return for its gifts. 8>) "
105,VOLUME TWO,Rest : 
106,VOLUME TWO,"Sleep is relief between exertions and effort we demand from ourselves. Much as we crave to eject all stops , the flesh craves due rest. The sword misses its scabbard. It returns to its housing when warlike vigilance is out of place. Take rest when your being needs its nourishment. Resume your affairs when refreshed. Thoughts dart. Senses sharpened. Limbs have their nimbleness returned. Go fly into the arena. Spend strength inside. When weariness gives the cue, come right back to the lull of repose. 8>) "
107,VOLUME TWO,Good Times : 
108,VOLUME TWO,"The time we had. Life's delights shared. Repartees. Jousting with and jocular bandying. They take stage and fill gaps during bouts of excruciating inactivity. Scene, scents and discerned details. Moments of climax. Instances at the apex of tension which left all ahanging on every second of charged anticipation relieved by laughter when the punch line was delivered. Unexpected turns, surprise when it caught us at the tender flank, we were stupefied. Then senses roused us to cheer the deftness of the deed. 8>) "
