19,HEALTH.,
20,HEALTH.,
21,HEALTH.,"When warm'd with zeal, my rustic Muse"
22,HEALTH.,"Feels fluttering fain to tell her news,"
23,HEALTH.,"And paint her simple, lowly views"
24,HEALTH.,"With all her art,"
25,HEALTH.,"And, though in genius but obtuse,"
26,HEALTH.,May touch the heart.
27,HEALTH.,
28,HEALTH.,Of palaces and courts of kings
29,HEALTH.,"She thinks but little, never sings,"
30,HEALTH.,But wildly strikes her uncouth strings
31,HEALTH.,"In some pool cot,"
32,HEALTH.,"Spreads o'er the poor hen fostering wings,"
33,HEALTH.,And soothes their lot.
34,HEALTH.,
35,HEALTH.,"Well pleased is she to see them smile,"
36,HEALTH.,And uses every honest wile
37,HEALTH.,"To mend then hearts, their cares beguile,"
38,HEALTH.,"With rhyming story,"
39,HEALTH.,"And lend them to then God the while,"
40,HEALTH.,And endless glory.
41,HEALTH.,
42,HEALTH.,"Perchance, my poor neglected Muse"
43,HEALTH.,"Unfit to harass or amuse,"
44,HEALTH.,"Escaping praise and loud abuse,"
45,HEALTH.,"Unheard, unknown,"
46,HEALTH.,"May feed the moths and wasting dews,"
47,HEALTH.,As some have done.
48,HEALTH.,
49,HEALTH.,"Her aims are good, howe'er they end--"
50,HEALTH.,"Here comes a foe, and there a friend,"
51,HEALTH.,"These point the dart and those defend,"
52,HEALTH.,Whilst some deride her;
53,HEALTH.,"But God will sweetest comforts blend,"
54,HEALTH.,Whate'er betide her.
55,HEALTH.,
56,HEALTH.,"Thus heaven-supported, forth she goes"
57,HEALTH.,"Midst flatterers, critics, friends, and foes;"
58,HEALTH.,"Secure, since He who all things knows"
59,HEALTH.,"Approves her aim,"
60,HEALTH.,"And kindly fans, or fostering blows"
61,HEALTH.,Her sinking flame.
62,HEALTH.,
63,HEALTH.,"Hence, when she shows her honest face,"
64,HEALTH.,"And tells her tale with awkward grace,"
65,HEALTH.,Importunate to gain a place
66,HEALTH.,"Amongst your friends,"
67,HEALTH.,"To ruthless critics leave her case,"
68,HEALTH.,And hail her ends.
69,HEALTH.,
70,HEALTH.,"To all my heart is kind and true,"
71,HEALTH.,But glows with ardent love for you;
72,HEALTH.,"Though absent, still you rise in view,"
73,HEALTH.,"And talk and smile,"
74,HEALTH.,"Whilst heavenly themes, for ever new,"
75,HEALTH.,Our cares beguile.
76,HEALTH.,
77,HEALTH.,"The happy seasons oft return,"
78,HEALTH.,"When love our melting hearts did burn,"
79,HEALTH.,As we through heavenly themes were borne
80,HEALTH.,"With heavenward eyes,"
81,HEALTH.,"And Faith this empty globe would spurn,"
82,HEALTH.,And sail the skies.
83,HEALTH.,
84,HEALTH.,"Or, when the rising sun shines bright,"
85,HEALTH.,"Or, setting, leaves the world in night,"
86,HEALTH.,"Or, dazzling, sheds his noon-day light,"
87,HEALTH.,"Or, cloudy, hides,"
88,HEALTH.,"My fancy, in her airy flight,"
89,HEALTH.,With you resides.
90,HEALTH.,
91,HEALTH.,"Where far you wander down the vale,"
92,HEALTH.,"When balmy scents perfume the gale,"
93,HEALTH.,And purling rills and linnets hail
94,HEALTH.,"The King of kings,"
95,HEALTH.,"To muse with you I never fail,"
96,HEALTH.,On heavenly things.
97,HEALTH.,
98,HEALTH.,"Where dashing cataracts astound,"
99,HEALTH.,"And foaming shake the neighbouring ground,"
100,HEALTH.,"And spread a hoary mist around,"
101,HEALTH.,With you I gaze!--
102,HEALTH.,"And think, amid'st the deaf'ning sound,"
103,HEALTH.,On wisdom's ways.
104,HEALTH.,
105,HEALTH.,"Where rocky mountains prop the skies,"
106,HEALTH.,"And round the smiling landscape lies,"
107,HEALTH.,Whilst you look down with tearful eyes
108,HEALTH.,"On grovelling man,"
109,HEALTH.,"My sympathetic fancy flies,"
110,HEALTH.,The scene to scan.
111,HEALTH.,
112,HEALTH.,From Pisgah's top we then survey
113,HEALTH.,"The blissful realms of endless day,"
114,HEALTH.,And all the short but narrow way
115,HEALTH.,"That lies between,"
116,HEALTH.,"Whilst Faith emits a heavenly ray,"
117,HEALTH.,And cheers the scene.
118,HEALTH.,
119,HEALTH.,With you I wander on the shore
120,HEALTH.,"To hear the angry surges roar,"
121,HEALTH.,Whilst foaming through the sands they pour
122,HEALTH.,"With constant roll,"
123,HEALTH.,"And meditations heavenward soar,"
124,HEALTH.,And charm the soul.
125,HEALTH.,
126,HEALTH.,On life's rough sea we're tempest-driven
127,HEALTH.,"In crazy barks, our canvas riven!"
128,HEALTH.,Such is the lot to mortals given
129,HEALTH.,Where sins resort:
130,HEALTH.,But he whose anchor's fixed in heaven
131,HEALTH.,Shall gain the port.
132,HEALTH.,
133,HEALTH.,"Though swelling waves oft beat him back,"
134,HEALTH.,"And tempests make him half a wreck,"
135,HEALTH.,"And passions strong, with dangerous tack,"
136,HEALTH.,"Retard his course,"
137,HEALTH.,"Yet Christ the pilot all will check,"
138,HEALTH.,And quell their force.
139,HEALTH.,
140,HEALTH.,So talk we as we thoughtful stray
141,HEALTH.,"Along the coast, where dashing spray"
142,HEALTH.,"With rising mist o'erhangs the day,"
143,HEALTH.,"And wets the shore,"
144,HEALTH.,And thick the vivid flashes play
145,HEALTH.,And thunders roar!
146,HEALTH.,
147,HEALTH.,"Whilst passing o'er this giddy stage,"
148,HEALTH.,A pious and a learned sage
149,HEALTH.,Resolved eternal war to wage
150,HEALTH.,With passions fell;
151,HEALTH.,How oft you view with holy rage
152,HEALTH.,These imps of hell!
153,HEALTH.,
154,HEALTH.,See! with what madd'ning force they sway
155,HEALTH.,"The human breast and lead astray,"
156,HEALTH.,"Down the steep, broad, destructive way,"
157,HEALTH.,The giddy throng;
158,HEALTH.,Till grisly death sweeps all away
159,HEALTH.,The fiends among!
160,HEALTH.,
161,HEALTH.,"As when the mad tornado flies,"
162,HEALTH.,"And sounding mingles earth and skies,"
163,HEALTH.,And wild confusion 'fore the eyes
164,HEALTH.,In terrors dressed.
165,HEALTH.,"So passions fell in whirlwinds rise,"
166,HEALTH.,And rend the breast!
167,HEALTH.,
168,HEALTH.,"But whilst this direful tempest raves,"
169,HEALTH.,"And many barks are dashed to staves,"
170,HEALTH.,I see you tower above the waves
171,HEALTH.,"Like some tall rock,"
172,HEALTH.,Whose base the harmless ocean laves
173,HEALTH.,Without a shock!
174,HEALTH.,
175,HEALTH.,"'Tis He who calmed the raging sea,"
176,HEALTH.,"Who bids the waves be still in thee,"
177,HEALTH.,And keeps you from all dangers free
178,HEALTH.,Amidst the wreck;
179,HEALTH.,"All sin, and care, and dangers flee"
180,HEALTH.,E'en at His beck.
181,HEALTH.,
182,HEALTH.,And on that great and dreadful day
183,HEALTH.,"When heaven and earth shall pass away,"
184,HEALTH.,"Each soul to bliss He will convey,"
185,HEALTH.,That knows His name;
186,HEALTH.,And give the giddy world a prey
187,HEALTH.,To quenchless flame.
188,HEALTH.,
189,HEALTH.,"So oft when Sabbaths bade us rest,"
190,HEALTH.,"And heavenly zeal inspired your breast,"
191,HEALTH.,Obedient to the high behest
192,HEALTH.,"You preached to all,"
193,HEALTH.,"Whilst God your zealous efforts blessed,"
194,HEALTH.,And owned your call.
195,HEALTH.,
196,HEALTH.,"The very thought my soul inspires,"
197,HEALTH.,And kindles bright her latent fires;
198,HEALTH.,"My Muse feels heart-warm fond desires,"
199,HEALTH.,"And spreads her wing,"
200,HEALTH.,"And aims to join th' angelic choirs,"
201,HEALTH.,And sweetly sing.
202,HEALTH.,
203,HEALTH.,"May rosy Health with speed return,"
204,HEALTH.,"And all your wonted ardour burn,"
205,HEALTH.,"And sickness buried in his urn,"
206,HEALTH.,Sleep many years!
207,HEALTH.,"So, countless friends who loudly mourn,"
208,HEALTH.,Shall dry their tears!
209,HEALTH.,
210,HEALTH.,Your wailing flock will all rejoice
211,HEALTH.,"To hear their much-loved shepherd's voice,"
212,HEALTH.,And long will bless the happy choice
213,HEALTH.,"Their hearts have made,"
214,HEALTH.,And tuneful mirth will swell the noise
215,HEALTH.,Through grove and glade.
216,HEALTH.,
217,HEALTH.,Your dearer half will join with me
218,HEALTH.,"To celebrate the jubilee,"
219,HEALTH.,And praise the Great Eternal Three
220,HEALTH.,"With throbbing joy,"
221,HEALTH.,And taste those pleasures pure and free
222,HEALTH.,Which never cloy.
223,HEALTH.,
224,HEALTH.,

227,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.
228,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
229,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
230,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"One sunny morn of May,"
231,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,When dressed in flowery green
232,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The dewy landscape, charmed"
233,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"With Nature's fairest scene,"
234,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In thoughtful mood
235,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,I slowly strayed
236,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"O'er hill and dale,"
237,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Through bush and glade.
238,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
239,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Throughout the cloudless sky
240,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Of light unsullied blue,"
241,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The larks their matins raised,"
242,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Whilst on my dizzy view,"
243,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Like dusky motes,"
244,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,They winged their way
245,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Till vanished in
246,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The blaze of day.
247,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
248,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The linnets sweetly sang
249,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"On every fragrant thorn,"
250,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Whilst from the tangled wood
251,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The blackbirds hailed the morn;
252,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And through the dew
253,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Ran here and there,"
254,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"But half afraid,"
255,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The startled hare.
256,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
257,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The balmy breeze just kissed
258,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The countless dewy gems
259,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Which decked the yielding blade
260,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Or gilt the sturdy stems,"
261,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And gently o'er
262,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The charmed sight
263,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A deluge shed
264,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Of trembling light.
265,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
266,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A sympathetic glow
267,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Ran through my melting soul,"
268,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And calm and sweet delight
269,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,O'er all my senses stole;
270,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And through my heart
271,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A grateful flood
272,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Of joy rolled on
273,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To Nature's God.
274,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
275,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Time flew unheeded by,"
276,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Till wearied and oppressed,"
277,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Upon a flowery bank
278,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,I laid me down to rest;
279,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Beneath my feet
280,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A purling stream
281,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Ran glittering in
282,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The noontide beam.
283,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
284,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,I turned me round to view
285,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The lovely rural scene;
286,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And, just at hand, I spied"
287,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A cottage on the green;
288,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The street was clean,"
289,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The walls were white,"
290,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The thatch was neat,"
291,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The window bright.
292,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
293,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Bold chanticleer, arrayed"
294,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"In velvet plumage gay,"
295,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"With many an amorous dame,"
296,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Fierce strutted o'er the way;
297,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And motley ducks
298,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Were waddling seen,"
299,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And drake with neck
300,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Of glossy green.
301,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
302,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The latch I gently raised,"
303,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And oped the humble door;
304,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,An oaken stool was placed
305,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,On the neat sanded floor;
306,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,An aged man
307,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Said with a smile,"
308,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"""You're welcome, sir:"
309,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Come rest a while."""
310,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
311,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"His coarse attire was clean,"
312,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,His manner rude yet kind:
313,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"His air, his words, and looks"
314,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Showed a contented mind;
315,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Though mean and poor,"
316,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Thrice happy he,"
317,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,As by our tale
318,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,You soon shall see.
319,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
320,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,But don't expect to hear
321,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Of deeds of martial fame,"
322,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Or that our peasant mean
323,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Was born of rank or name,"
324,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And soon will strut,"
325,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"As in romance,"
326,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A knight and all
327,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In armour glance.
328,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
329,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,I sing of real life;
330,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,All else is empty show--
331,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To those who read a source
332,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Of much unreal woe:
333,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Pollution, too,"
334,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Through novel-veins,"
335,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Oft fills the mind
336,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,With guilty stains.
337,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
338,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Our peasant long was bred
339,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Affliction's meagre child,"
340,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Yet gratefully resigned,"
341,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Loud hymning praises, smiled,"
342,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And like a tower
343,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"He stood unmoved,"
344,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Supported by
345,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The God he loved.
346,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
347,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,His loving wife long since
348,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Was numbered with the dead
349,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"His son, a martial youth,"
350,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Had for his country bled;
351,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And now remained
352,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"One daughter fair,"
353,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And only she,"
354,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To soothe his care.
355,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
356,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The aged man with tears
357,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Spoke of the lovely maid;
358,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,How earnestly she strove
359,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"To lend her father aid,"
360,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And as he ran
361,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Her praises o'er,"
362,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,She gently oped
363,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The cottage-door.
364,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
365,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,With vegetable store
366,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The table soon she spread,"
367,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And pressed me to partake;
368,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Whilst blushes rosy-red
369,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Suffused her face--
370,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The old man smiled,"
371,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Well pleased to see
372,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,His darling child.
373,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
374,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,With venerable air
375,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"He then looked up to God,"
376,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"A blessing craved on all,"
377,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And on our daily food;
378,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Then kindly begged
379,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,I would excuse
380,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Their humble fair,"
381,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And not refuse.--
382,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
383,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The tablecloth, though coarse,"
384,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Was of a snowy white,"
385,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The vessels, spoons, and knives"
386,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Were clean and dazzling bright;
387,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,So down we sat
388,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Devoid of care,"
389,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Nor envied kings
390,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Their dainty fare.
391,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
392,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"When nature was refreshed,"
393,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And we familiar grown;
394,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The good old man exclaimed,"
395,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"""Around Jehovah's throne,"
396,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Come, let us all"
397,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Our voices raise,"
398,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And sing our great
399,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Redeemer's praise!"""
400,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
401,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Their artless notes were sweet,"
402,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Grace ran through every line;
403,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Their breasts with rapture swelled,"
404,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Their looks were all divine:
405,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Delight o'er all
406,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"My senses stole,"
407,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And heaven's pure joy
408,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,O'erwhelmed my soul.
409,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
410,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"When we had praised our God,"
411,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And knelt around His throne,"
412,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The aged man began
413,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"In deep and zealous tone,"
414,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,With hands upraised
415,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And heavenward eye,"
416,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And prayed loud
417,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And fervently:
418,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
419,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"He prayed that for His sake,"
420,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Whose guiltless blood was shed
421,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"For guilty ruined man,"
422,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,We might that day be fed
423,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,With that pure bread
424,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Which cheers the soul,"
425,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And living stream,"
426,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Where pleasures roll.
427,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
428,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"He prayed long for all,"
429,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And for his daughter dear,"
430,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"That she, preserved from ill,"
431,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Might lead for many a year
432,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A spotless life
433,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,When he's no more;
434,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Then follow him
435,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To Canaan's shore.
436,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
437,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"His faltering voice then fell,"
438,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"His tears were dropping fast,"
439,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And muttering praise to God
440,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"For all His mercies past,"
441,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,He closed his prayer
442,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Midst heavenly joys,"
443,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And tasted bliss
444,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Which never cloys.
445,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
446,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In sweet discourse we spent
447,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The fast declining day:
448,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"We spoke of Jesus' love,"
449,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And of that narrow way
450,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Which leads, through care"
451,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"And toil below,"
452,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To streams where joys
453,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Eternal flow.
454,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
455,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The wondrous plan of Grace,"
456,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Adoring, we surveyed,"
457,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The birth of heavenly skill--
458,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In Love Eternal laid--
459,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Too deep for clear
460,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Angelic ken,"
461,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And far beyond
462,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Dim-sighted men.
463,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
464,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To tell you all that passed
465,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Would far exceed my power;
466,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Suffice it, then, to say,"
467,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Joy winged the passing hour,"
468,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Till, ere we knew,"
469,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The setting day
470,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Had clad the world
471,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In silver grey.
472,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
473,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"I kindly took my leave,"
474,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And blessed the happy lot
475,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Of those I left behind
476,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Lodged in their humble cot;
477,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And pitied some
478,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"In palace walls,"
479,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Where pride torments,"
480,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And pleasure palls.
481,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
482,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,The silver moon now shed
483,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,A flood of trembling light
484,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"On tower, and tree, and stream;"
485,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"The twinkling stars shone bright,"
486,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Nor misty stain
487,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Nor cloud was seen
488,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,O'er all the deep
489,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Celestial green.
490,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
491,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Mild was the lovely night,"
492,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Nor stirred a whispering breeze.
493,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Smooth was the glassy lake,"
494,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And still the leafy trees;
495,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,No sound in air
496,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"Was heard afloat,"
497,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Save Philomel's
498,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,Sweet warbling note.
499,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,
500,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"My thoughts were on the wing,"
501,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,And back my fancy fled
502,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To where contentment dwelt
503,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,In the neat humble shed;
504,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,To shining courts
505,THE HAPPY COTTAGERS.,"From thence it ran,"

544,THE RAINBOW.,"Save where a few drops from on high,"
545,THE RAINBOW.,"Like gems, twinkle over the green:"
546,THE RAINBOW.,"And glowing fair, in the black north,"
547,THE RAINBOW.,The rainbow o'erarches the cloud;
548,THE RAINBOW.,"The sun in his glory comes forth,"
549,THE RAINBOW.,And larks sweetly warble aloud.
550,THE RAINBOW.,
551,THE RAINBOW.,That dismally grim northern sky
552,THE RAINBOW.,"Says God in His vengeance once frowned,"
553,THE RAINBOW.,"And opened His flood-gates on high,"
554,THE RAINBOW.,Till obstinate sinners were drowned:
555,THE RAINBOW.,"The lively bright south, and that bow,"
556,THE RAINBOW.,Say all this dread vengeance is o'er;
557,THE RAINBOW.,These colours that smilingly glow
558,THE RAINBOW.,Say we shall be deluged no more.
559,THE RAINBOW.,
560,THE RAINBOW.,"Ever blessed be those innocent days,"
561,THE RAINBOW.,Ever sweet their remembrance to me;
562,THE RAINBOW.,"When often, in silent amaze,"
563,THE RAINBOW.,"Enraptured, I'd gaze upon thee!"
564,THE RAINBOW.,Whilst arching adown the black sky
565,THE RAINBOW.,"Thy colours glowed on the green hill,"
566,THE RAINBOW.,"To catch thee as lightning I'd fly,"
567,THE RAINBOW.,But aye you eluded my skill.
568,THE RAINBOW.,
569,THE RAINBOW.,From hill unto hill your gay scene
570,THE RAINBOW.,"You shifted--whilst crying aloud,"
571,THE RAINBOW.,"I ran, till at length from the green,"
572,THE RAINBOW.,"You shifted, at once to the cloud!"
573,THE RAINBOW.,"So, vain worldly phantoms betray"
574,THE RAINBOW.,"The youths who too eager pursue,"
575,THE RAINBOW.,"When ruined and far led astray,"
576,THE RAINBOW.,Th' illusion escapes from their view.
577,THE RAINBOW.,
578,THE RAINBOW.,"Those peaceable days knew no care,"
579,THE RAINBOW.,"Except what arose from my play,"
580,THE RAINBOW.,"My favourite lambkin and hare,"
581,THE RAINBOW.,And cabin I built o'er the way.
582,THE RAINBOW.,No cares did I say?  Ah!  I'm wrong:
583,THE RAINBOW.,Even childhood from cares is not free:
584,THE RAINBOW.,Far distant I see a grim throng
585,THE RAINBOW.,Shake horrible lances at me!
586,THE RAINBOW.,
587,THE RAINBOW.,One day--I remember it still--
588,THE RAINBOW.,For pranks I had played on the clown
589,THE RAINBOW.,"Who lived on the neighbouring hill,"
590,THE RAINBOW.,My cabin was trod to the ground.
591,THE RAINBOW.,Who ever felt grief such as I
592,THE RAINBOW.,When crashed by this terrible blow?
593,THE RAINBOW.,"Not Priam, the monarch of Troy,"
594,THE RAINBOW.,When all his proud towers lay low.
595,THE RAINBOW.,
596,THE RAINBOW.,And grief upon grief was my lot:
597,THE RAINBOW.,"Soon after, my lambkin was slain;"
598,THE RAINBOW.,"My hare, having strayed from its cot,"
599,THE RAINBOW.,Was chased by the hounds o'er the plain.
600,THE RAINBOW.,What countless calamities teem
601,THE RAINBOW.,From memory's page on my view!--
602,THE RAINBOW.,"How trifling soever you seem,"
603,THE RAINBOW.,Yet once I have wept over you.
604,THE RAINBOW.,
605,THE RAINBOW.,"Then cease, foolish heart, to repine;"
606,THE RAINBOW.,No stage is exempted from care:
607,THE RAINBOW.,"If you would true happiness find,"
608,THE RAINBOW.,Come follow! and I'll show you where.
609,THE RAINBOW.,"But, first, let us take for our guide"
610,THE RAINBOW.,The Word which Jehovah has penned;
611,THE RAINBOW.,By this the true path is descried
612,THE RAINBOW.,Which leads to a glorious end.
613,THE RAINBOW.,
614,THE RAINBOW.,How narrow this path to our view!
615,THE RAINBOW.,How steep an ascent lies before!
616,THE RAINBOW.,"Whilst, foolish fond heart, laid for you"
617,THE RAINBOW.,Are dazzling temptations all o'er.
618,THE RAINBOW.,What bye-ways with easy descent
619,THE RAINBOW.,Invite us through pleasures to stray!
620,THE RAINBOW.,"Whilst Satan, with hellish intent,"
621,THE RAINBOW.,Suggests that we ought to obey.
622,THE RAINBOW.,
623,THE RAINBOW.,"But trust not the father of lies,"
624,THE RAINBOW.,He tempts you with vanity's dream;
625,THE RAINBOW.,"His pleasure, when touched, quickly dies,"
626,THE RAINBOW.,Like bubbles that dance on the stream.
627,THE RAINBOW.,Look not on the wine when it glows
628,THE RAINBOW.,"All ruddy, in vessels of gold;"
629,THE RAINBOW.,"At last it will sting your repose,"
630,THE RAINBOW.,And death at the bottom unfold. {208}
631,THE RAINBOW.,
632,THE RAINBOW.,But lo! an unnatural night
633,THE RAINBOW.,Pours suddenly down on the eye;
634,THE RAINBOW.,"The sun has withdrawn all his light,"
635,THE RAINBOW.,And rolls a black globe o'er the sky!
636,THE RAINBOW.,And hark! what a cry rent the air!
637,THE RAINBOW.,Immortal the terrible sound!--
638,THE RAINBOW.,"The rocks split with honible tear,"
639,THE RAINBOW.,And fearfully shakes all the ground!
640,THE RAINBOW.,
641,THE RAINBOW.,"The dead from their slumbers awake,"
642,THE RAINBOW.,"And, leaving their mouldy domain,"
643,THE RAINBOW.,Make poor guilty mortals to quake
644,THE RAINBOW.,As pallid they glide o'er the plain!
645,THE RAINBOW.,"Sure, Nature's own God is oppressed,"
646,THE RAINBOW.,And Nature in agony cries;--
647,THE RAINBOW.,"The sun in his mourning is dressed,"
648,THE RAINBOW.,To tell the sad news through the skies!
649,THE RAINBOW.,
650,THE RAINBOW.,"Yet surely some victory's gained,"
651,THE RAINBOW.,"Important, and novel, and great,"
652,THE RAINBOW.,"Since Death has his captives unchained,"
653,THE RAINBOW.,And widely thrown open his gate!
654,THE RAINBOW.,"Yes, victory great as a God"
655,THE RAINBOW.,"Could gain over hell, death, and sin,"
656,THE RAINBOW.,This moment's achieved by the blood
657,THE RAINBOW.,"Of Jesus, our crucified King."
658,THE RAINBOW.,
659,THE RAINBOW.,But all the dread conflict is o'er;
660,THE RAINBOW.,Lo! cloud after cloud rolls away;
661,THE RAINBOW.,"And heaven, serene as before,"
662,THE RAINBOW.,Breaks forth in the splendour of day!
663,THE RAINBOW.,"And all the sweet landscape around,"
664,THE RAINBOW.,"Emerged from the ocean of night,"
665,THE RAINBOW.,"With groves, woods, and villages crowned,"
666,THE RAINBOW.,Astonish and fill with delight!
667,THE RAINBOW.,
668,THE RAINBOW.,"But see! where that crowd melts away,"
669,THE RAINBOW.,Three crosses sad spectacles show!
670,THE RAINBOW.,Our Guide has not led us astray;
671,THE RAINBOW.,Heart! this is the secret you'd know--
672,THE RAINBOW.,"Two thieves, and a crucified God"
673,THE RAINBOW.,Hangs awfully mangled between!
674,THE RAINBOW.,Whilst fast from His veins spouting blood
675,THE RAINBOW.,"Runs, dyeing with purple the green!"
676,THE RAINBOW.,
677,THE RAINBOW.,"Behold! the red flood rolls along,"
678,THE RAINBOW.,"And forming a bason below,"
679,THE RAINBOW.,Is termed in Emanuel's song
680,THE RAINBOW.,The fount for uncleanness and woe.
681,THE RAINBOW.,"Immerged in that precious tide,"
682,THE RAINBOW.,"The soul quickly loses its stains,"
683,THE RAINBOW.,"Though deeper than crimson they're dyed,"
684,THE RAINBOW.,And 'scapes from its sorrows and pains.
685,THE RAINBOW.,
686,THE RAINBOW.,This fountain is opened for you:
687,THE RAINBOW.,"Go, wash, without money or price;"
688,THE RAINBOW.,"And instantly formed anew,"
689,THE RAINBOW.,You'll lose all your woes in a trice.
690,THE RAINBOW.,"Then cease, foolish heart, to repine,"
691,THE RAINBOW.,No stage is exempted from care;

693,THE RAINBOW.,'Tis on Calvary--seek for it there.

708,WINTER-NIGHT MEDITATIONS.,"The drifting snow across the floor,"

886,WINTER-NIGHT MEDITATIONS.,"Or by the fierce, incessant waves"
887,WINTER-NIGHT MEDITATIONS.,Is beaten to a thousand staves;
888,WINTER-NIGHT MEDITATIONS.,"Or bilging at her crazy side,"

1077,THE IRISH CABIN.,"One day, when December's keen breath"
1078,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Arrested the sweet running rill,"
1079,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And Nature seemed frozen in death,"

1081,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The mustering clouds wore a frown,"
1082,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The mountains were covered with snow,"
1083,THE IRISH CABIN.,And Winter his mantle of brown
1084,THE IRISH CABIN.,Had spread o'er the landscape below.
1085,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1086,THE IRISH CABIN.,Thick rattling the footsteps were heard
1087,THE IRISH CABIN.,Of peasants far down in the vale;

1098,THE IRISH CABIN.,Sat pensively mute in the bush:
1099,THE IRISH CABIN.,The leaves that once wove a green shade
1100,THE IRISH CABIN.,Lay withered in heaps on the ground:
1101,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Chill Winter through grove, wood, and glade"
1102,THE IRISH CABIN.,Spread sad desolation around.
1103,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1104,THE IRISH CABIN.,"But now the keen north wind 'gan whistle,"

1107,THE IRISH CABIN.,And night thickened fast on the eye.
1108,THE IRISH CABIN.,In swift-wheeling eddies the snow
1109,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Fell, mingling and drifting amain,"
1110,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And soon all distinction laid low,"
1111,THE IRISH CABIN.,As whitening it covered the plain.
1112,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1113,THE IRISH CABIN.,A light its pale ray faintly shot
1114,THE IRISH CABIN.,"(The snow-flakes its splendour had shorn),"
1115,THE IRISH CABIN.,"It came from a neighbouring cot,"
1116,THE IRISH CABIN.,Some called it the Cabin of Mourne: {221}
1117,THE IRISH CABIN.,"A neat Irish Cabin, snow-proof,"
1118,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Well thatched, had a good earthen floor,"
1119,THE IRISH CABIN.,"One chimney in midst of the roof,"
1120,THE IRISH CABIN.,"One window, and one latched door."
1121,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1122,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Escaped from the pitiless storm,"
1123,THE IRISH CABIN.,I entered the humble retreat;
1124,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Compact was the building, and warm,"
1125,THE IRISH CABIN.,Its furniture simple and neat.
1126,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And now, gentle reader, approve"
1127,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The ardour that glowed in each breast,"
1128,THE IRISH CABIN.,As kindly our cottagers strove
1129,THE IRISH CABIN.,To cherish and welcome their guest.
1130,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1131,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The dame nimbly rose from her wheel,"
1132,THE IRISH CABIN.,And brushed off the powdery snow:
1133,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Her daughter, forsaking the reel,"
1134,THE IRISH CABIN.,Ran briskly the cinders to blow:
1135,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The children, who sat on the hearth,"
1136,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Leaped up without murmur or frown,"
1137,THE IRISH CABIN.,"An oaken stool quickly brought forth,"
1138,THE IRISH CABIN.,And smilingly bade me sit down.
1139,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1140,THE IRISH CABIN.,Whilst grateful sensations of joy
1141,THE IRISH CABIN.,"O'er all my fond bosom were poured,"
1142,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Resumed was each former employ,"
1143,THE IRISH CABIN.,And gay thrifty order restored:
1144,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The blaze flickered up to the crook,"
1145,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The reel clicked again by the door,"
1146,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The dame turned her wheel in the nook,"
1147,THE IRISH CABIN.,And frisked the sweet babes round the floor.
1148,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1149,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Released from the toils of the barn,"
1150,THE IRISH CABIN.,"His thrifty, blithe wife hailed the sire,"
1151,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And hanging his flail by her yarn,"
1152,THE IRISH CABIN.,He drew up his stool to the fire;
1153,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Then smoothing his brow with his hand,"
1154,THE IRISH CABIN.,"As if he would sweep away sorrow,"
1155,THE IRISH CABIN.,"He says, ""Let us keep God's command,"
1156,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And never take thought for the morrow."""
1157,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1158,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Brisk turning him round with a smile,"

1160,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And affable manners and style,"
1161,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Though simple, that reached to my heart,"
1162,THE IRISH CABIN.,"He said (whilst with ardour he glowed),"
1163,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""Kind sir, we are poor, yet we're blest:"
1164,THE IRISH CABIN.,"We're all in the steep, narrow road"
1165,THE IRISH CABIN.,That leads to the city of rest.

1167,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""'Tis true, I must toil all the day,"
1168,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And oft suffer cold through the night,"

1170,THE IRISH CABIN.,And dimly declining my sight:
1171,THE IRISH CABIN.,And sometimes our raiment and food
1172,THE IRISH CABIN.,Are scanty--ah! scanty indeed:
1173,THE IRISH CABIN.,"But all work together for good,"
1174,THE IRISH CABIN.,So in my blest Bible I read.
1175,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1176,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""I also have seen in that Book"
1177,THE IRISH CABIN.,(Perhaps you can tell me the place?)
1178,THE IRISH CABIN.,How God on poor sinners does look
1179,THE IRISH CABIN.,"In pity, and gives them His grace--"
1180,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Yea, gives them His grace in vast store,"
1181,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Sufficient to help them quite through,"
1182,THE IRISH CABIN.,Though troubles should whelm them all o'er;
1183,THE IRISH CABIN.,And sure this sweet promise is true!
1184,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1185,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""Yes, true as the snow blows without,"
1186,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And winds whistle keen through the air,"
1187,THE IRISH CABIN.,"His grace can remove every doubt,"
1188,THE IRISH CABIN.,And chase the black gloom of despair:
1189,THE IRISH CABIN.,"It often supports my weak mind,"
1190,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And wipes the salt tear from my eye,"
1191,THE IRISH CABIN.,"It tells me that Jesus is kind,"
1192,THE IRISH CABIN.,And died for such sinners as I.
1193,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1194,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""I once rolled in wealth, without grace,"
1195,THE IRISH CABIN.,"But happiness ne'er was my lot,"
1196,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Till Christ freely pitied my case,"
1197,THE IRISH CABIN.,And now I am blest in a cot:
1198,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Well knowing things earthly are vain,"
1199,THE IRISH CABIN.,Their troubles ne'er puzzle my head;
1200,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Convinced that to die will be gain,"
1201,THE IRISH CABIN.,I look on the grave as my bed.
1202,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1203,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""I look on the grave as my bed,"
1204,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Where I'll sleep the swift hours away,"
1205,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Till waked from their slumbers, the dead"
1206,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Shall rise, never more to decay:"
1207,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Then I, with my children and wife,"
1208,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Shall get a bright palace above,"
1209,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And endlessly clothed with life,"
1210,THE IRISH CABIN.,Shall dwell in the Eden of love.
1211,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1212,THE IRISH CABIN.,"""Then know, gentle stranger, though poor,"
1213,THE IRISH CABIN.,"We're cheerful, contented, and blest;"
1214,THE IRISH CABIN.,Though princes should pass by our door
1215,THE IRISH CABIN.,King Jesus is ever our guest;
1216,THE IRISH CABIN.,"We feel, and we taste, and we see"
1217,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The pleasures which flow from our Lord,"
1218,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And fearless, and wealthy, and free,"
1219,THE IRISH CABIN.,"We live on the joys of His word."""
1220,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1221,THE IRISH CABIN.,He ceased: and a big tear of joy
1222,THE IRISH CABIN.,Rolled glittering down to the ground;
1223,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Whilst all, having dropped their employ,"
1224,THE IRISH CABIN.,Were buried in silence profound;
1225,THE IRISH CABIN.,"A sweet, solemn pause long ensued--"
1226,THE IRISH CABIN.,Each bosom o'erflowed with delight;
1227,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Then heavenly converse renewed,"
1228,THE IRISH CABIN.,Beguiled the dull season of night.
1229,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1230,THE IRISH CABIN.,We talked of the rough narrow way
1231,THE IRISH CABIN.,That leads to the kingdom of rest;
1232,THE IRISH CABIN.,On Pisgah we stood to survey
1233,THE IRISH CABIN.,The King in His holiness dressed--
1234,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Even Jesus, the crucified King,"
1235,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Whose blood in rich crimson does flow,"
1236,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Clean washing the crimson of sin,"
1237,THE IRISH CABIN.,And rinsing it whiter that snow. {225}
1238,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1239,THE IRISH CABIN.,"But later and later it's wearing,"
1240,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And supper they cheerfully bring,"
1241,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The mealy potato and herring,"
1242,THE IRISH CABIN.,And water just fresh from the spring.
1243,THE IRISH CABIN.,"They press, and they smile: we sit down;"
1244,THE IRISH CABIN.,First praying the Father of Love
1245,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Our table with blessings to crown,"
1246,THE IRISH CABIN.,And feed us with bread from above.
1247,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1248,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The wealthy and bloated may sneer,"
1249,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And sicken o'er luxury's dishes,"
1250,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And loathe the poor cottager's cheer,"
1251,THE IRISH CABIN.,And melt in the heat of their wishes:
1252,THE IRISH CABIN.,"But luxury's sons are unblest,"
1253,THE IRISH CABIN.,"A prey to each giddy desire,"
1254,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And hence, where they never know rest,"
1255,THE IRISH CABIN.,They sink in unquenchable fire.
1256,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1257,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Not so, the poor cottager's lot,"
1258,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Who travels the Zion-ward road,"
1259,THE IRISH CABIN.,"He's blest in his neat little cot,"
1260,THE IRISH CABIN.,He's rich in the favour of God;
1261,THE IRISH CABIN.,By faith he surmounts every wave
1262,THE IRISH CABIN.,That rolls on this sea of distress:
1263,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Triumphant, he dives in the grave,"
1264,THE IRISH CABIN.,To rise on the ocean of bliss.
1265,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1266,THE IRISH CABIN.,Now supper is o'er and we raise
1267,THE IRISH CABIN.,Our prayers to the Father of light
1268,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And joyfully hymning His praise,"
1269,THE IRISH CABIN.,We lovingly bid a good-night.--
1270,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The ground's white, the sky's cloudless blue,"
1271,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The breeze flutters keen through the air,"
1272,THE IRISH CABIN.,"The stars twinkle bright on my view,"

1278,THE IRISH CABIN.,Shall hear of the Cabin of Mourne;
1279,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And had I but musical strains,"
1280,THE IRISH CABIN.,Though humble and mean in your station
1281,THE IRISH CABIN.,"You should smile whilst the world remains,"
1282,THE IRISH CABIN.,The pride of the fair Irish Nation.
1283,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1284,THE IRISH CABIN.,"In friendship, fair Erin, you glow;"
1285,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Offended, you quickly forgive;"
1286,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Your courage is known to each foe,"
1287,THE IRISH CABIN.,Yet foes on your bounty might live.
1288,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Some faults you, however, must own;"
1289,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Dissensions, impetuous zeal,"
1290,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And wild prodigality, grown"
1291,THE IRISH CABIN.,Too big for your income and weal.
1292,THE IRISH CABIN.,
1293,THE IRISH CABIN.,"Ah!  Erin, if you would be great,"
1294,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And happy, and wealthy, and wise,"
1295,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And trample your sorrows, elate,"
1296,THE IRISH CABIN.,Contend for our cottager's prize;
1297,THE IRISH CABIN.,"So error and vice shall decay,"
1298,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And concord add bliss to renown,"
1299,THE IRISH CABIN.,"And you shall gleam brighter than day,"
