1103,,Dame Sapyence sayd I do procede

1106,,God and lorde of myghtys moost
1107,,Whose infynall power was neuer lost

1111,,Where that dame hardynes in her pledynge
1112,,Made her selfe to knyghtes moost necessary

1119,,The fyrst is prudence that is the chefe
1120,,That hym doth rule and is his gyde

1124,,By his wit to withstand the deuyll
1125,,That he consent not to do euyll
1126,,
1127,,The seconde is that he sholde be true

1129,,And all treason for euer to eschewe
1130,,In whiche grete shame often remayneth
1131,,And by whiche he hiz k[yn]ge dysteyneth
1132,,So a crysten man sholde be true euer
1133,,To Ihesu Cryst that was his redemer
1134,,
1135,,The thyrde is that he sholde be lyberall
1136,,Amonge his c[om]mons withouten lette
1137,,That is the cause euer in generall
1138,,That he the loue of theym doth gette
1139,,For it causeth theyr hertes on hym be sette
1140,,So euery true crysten man sholde be
1141,,To god intended with lyberalyte
1142,,
1143,,The fourth is that he sholde be stronge

1146,,But wronges for to dyrecte and amende
1147,,As ferre as his power wyll extende
1148,,So a true crysten man sholde exclude

1151,,The fyfth is [that] he sholde be mercyable

1236,,So hardynesse and prudence in no wyse
1237,,Without good fortune may well suffyse
1238,,
1239,,Though that a man were but a fole
1240,,Yf I consent that he be fortunate
1241,,He nedyth not to make no grete dole

1251,,Whan she doth take theyr hertes in cure
1252,,Yf fortune be awaye she may not auayle
1253,,For they by reason must lose the batayle

1255,,Yet forthermore as I do well consyder
1256,,How dame hardynes dyd expresse
1257,,Sythens the tyme that I came hyder
1258,,That she promoted had to worthynes
1259,,Hector dauid and the noble hercules
1260,,With many other wherof she fayleth

1287,,That nature gyueth by her power
1288,,Wysedome nor hardynes may not defete

1293,,In sondery wyse my dedes are so wrought

1298,,Yet shulde he lyue and neuer perysshe
1299,,Tyll that my power of hym doth fynysshe
1300,,Whiche fayle must ones it is my proprete

2678,,_Transposed Text_
2679,,
2680,,Two groups of pages appear to have been printed out of sequence. Each
2681,,"involves pages from the later part of a signature, so visible page"
2682,,numbering is absent. It is not known whether the error is from the
2683,,original printing or from the facsimile reprint.
2684,,
2685,,Pages 9-11 = aa.v.(recto) - aa.vi.(recto)  [unnumbered]
2686,,Pages 69-71 = ff.iii.(recto) - ff.iiii.(recto)  [unnumbered]

2702,,
2703,,_Numbers_
2704,,
2705,,Numbers such as .x. were usually printed without spaces.
2706,,
2707,,Chapter headings for .vi. and .vii. were printed near the bottom of
2708,,"the page-- as main text, not catchwords-- and again at the top of the"
2709,,following page. This pattern was not consistently followed for all
2710,,chapters that began at the top of a page.
