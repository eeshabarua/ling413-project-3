135,PREFACE,PREFACE 
136,TO THE,TO THE 
137,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS. 
138,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"THE poems contained in the following pages must be taken as parts of a whole, being intended to be distinct only in their subjects. This will account for the same measure being used throughout. "
139,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of these pieces, the only one which has been previously published is that addressed ""To a Wild Flower."" My reason for inserting it here is, that it harmonizes with the other poems; and, having been already favourably spoken of by competent judges, I must confess it is one which I should ""not willingly let die."" "
140,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"In the first poem on ""Autumn,"" I have introduced what has always appeared to me a beautiful incident in nature; namely, the singing of the missel-thrush during a thunder-storm. The louder the thunder roars, the shriller and sweeter becomes its voice. This interesting little bird is popularly known by the name of the storm-cock, because he is supposed to sing boldest immediately previous to a storm; but that he also sends forth his ""native wood notes wild,"" during its continuance, is a fact which has been satisfactorily ascertained. Undismayed by the tempest's fury, or, rather rejoicing in its violence, the small but spirited songster warbles on unceasingly, as if desirous of emulating the loudness of the thunder-tone, or of making his song be heard above the noise of the raging elements. "
141,FIRST EDITION OF LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The poetry of nature, particularly at this joyous season, is in its landscapes; and if these unpretending ""Lyrics"" should lead any one to a healthy contemplation of natural objects, or impart, to refined minds, any pleasure in the perusal, the time which has been bestowed upon them will not have been idly or unprofitably employed. "

143,POEMS.,POEMS. 
144,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,LANDSCAPE LYRICS. 
145,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,No. I.--SUNRISE. 
146,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"SPREAD are dawn's radiant wings, Its dazzling feet pursue their silent way, Leaving no shadow, for each coming ray A general brightness brings. "
147,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The vapour from the brow Of the old mountain crests, begins to part, Like care from off the forehead, and the heart-- And all is cloudless now! "
148,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The universal air, The smiling sky, and the far-stretching mead-- All nature, in its varied forms agreed, Mingle their beauties there! "
149,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The ripple of the wave, Beachward returning to the distant shore, Like a lone pilgrim to the cottage door, That once a welcome gave: "
150,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The new-waked laureat bee, On the flower-blossom, breathing in its mirth, Its conch-like matin song, to greet the earth, With ever grateful glee! "
151,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The landscape's free expanse, And all the harmonies that, spread around, Combine the joys of hearing, sight, and sound, Are gathered at a glance; "
152,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And powerfully they tell, With deeper eloquence than notes divine, Of many things that round our heart-strings twine, And in our fancies dwell; "
153,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Of boyhood's sportive days, The thymy glade, the daisy blooming there, The vale remote, or lake secluded, where The smiling sunbeam plays; "
154,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The gay flowers on the plain, Gemming the mead, perfuming all the wood; As if each Summer morn was Spring renew'd, Or May-day come again! "
155,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The music of the birds, Telling all sleepers of the birth of day, And, with reviving Nature, haste to pay Their homage, not in words! "
156,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The dreamy waterfall, Babbling and bubbling from the upland spring; The soaring crag where eaglets rest their wing, Listening the eagle's call: "
157,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The minstrel streamlet near, The zephyr's breath, too languid for a breeze, That stirs, yet scarcely moves, the gentle trees, Touching the waters clear. "
158,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sunrays, as they pass Into broad sunshine, throw their light on all, With bloom and blossom, whereso'er they fall; On mount, or meadow-grass. "
159,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And something more than light Sleeps on the verdant hill-side; dreams of love, And glimpses of the happier state above, Burst on the mental sight. "
160,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,No. II.--MORNING FURTHER ADVANCED. 
161,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"MEET 'tis to watch and spy, The laughing Orient, like a chubby child, Bringing new joyousness to wood and wild, To ocean, earth, and sky. "
162,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The groups of early flowers To th' enamoured sun their bosoms ope,-- Apt emblems of the welcome birth of Hope, In life's oft darkened bowers. "
163,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Pass to the green hill-side, And let us wander where the wild flowers grow, Gaze on the sedgy stream's calm depths below, Where gentle minnows glide. "
164,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sheltered cuckoo's notes, In the young sunshine, echo on the ear-- A moving voice, from all around, is here!-- Hymns from a thousand throats:-- "
165,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The spirit grows the more Refined and holy, as we stand and gaze Upon the landscape, brightening in the blaze That gilds both land and shore. "
166,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"All objects, far and near, The light of morn illumines; it is now That man can walk erect with glowing brow, And heart devoid of fear. "
167,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And, lo! there is a stir In yonder village, bosomed in the dell, Like a meek babe, loved by its mother well, And loving nought but her! "
168,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Where claims the eye to rest? Earth has a balmy look, and so has Heaven; And thoughts, like mazy clouds through ether driven, Float in th' enraptured breast. "
169,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The sylvan haunts, where youth Roams, fancy led, all glorious in their hue; The quaint sequestered spots and paths we view, Where Age consorts with Truth. "
170,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Read we of aught that wakes High inspiration in the soul, in scenes like these? The tufted trees' fantastic tapestries-- Romantic knolls and brakes; "
171,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The hill-enskirted glen, Where bound the wild deer; and the huntsman's horn Sounds from afar, a welcome to the morn, Till Echo sounds again! "
172,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"And more than all, the old And pyramidal mountains, that with time Have stood, defying change, and storm, and clime, As none else of earth's mould "
173,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Hath done: the sun embrowns, But does not scorch them; rain, and wind, and snow, Renew them, not destroy; no waste they know, But lasting glory crowns. "
174,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,Still to the heart endeared Are sights like this we gaze on. Do we deem That they are other than a privileged dream?-- One that the mind has reared! 
175,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,No. III.--NOONDAY. 
176,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"LO! like an eastern king, Forth marches Sunshine gorgeously through earth, By health attended, and life-giving mirth, And heralded by Spring. "
177,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"Light through the untrack'd air, Pursues its course authentic; hill and dale Rejoice, and Nature cries, ""All hail!"" As if a king were there. "
178,LANDSCAPE LYRICS.,"The elevated lawns, Where first the day comes, and where last retires, Rejoicing seem; their light the mind inspires, And thought, like morning, dawns. "

369,POETICAL ASPIRATIONS.,"A SMALL volume of poems, entitled ""POETICAL ASPIRATIONS,"" was published by me, my first adventure, in 1830, and was favourably received. That volume was dedicated to MRS ROBERTSON of EDNAM HOUSE, Kelso, a lady whose many virtues are universally acknowledged wherever she is known, and whose kindness to me it will always be my pride to remember. A second edition, with additional poems, appeared in 1833. From the latter volume I have selected the following pieces, the remainder, bearing evident marks of inexperience and juvenility of taste, not being deemed worthy of further reprint. "

371,THE ALPINE HORN. (1),THE ALPINE HORN. (1) 
372,THE ALPINE HORN. (1),"SUNSET is streaming o'er the snow-clad crown Of the high Alps, while darkness settles down Through all their countless valleys and defiles, Mixing with shade, where sunlight never smiles: Ere from the topmost peak, its latest ray Has, with its wing of glory, sped away, The mountain shepherd's horn has sounded there, Like the Muezzin's evening call to prayer; ""Praise God the Lord!"" and hark! from all around A thousand voices answer to the sound: From every clift, and crag, and ledge, and linn, The notes of worship and of praise begin. ""Praise God the Lord!"" the echoes catch the strain, And far and near repeat the sound again; They wake it in the wild and in the wood, Through all the shades of that far solitude: Bearing it on, o'er valley and ravine, Where, till this hour, such sound has never been; Then, in the distance, fainter grown the lay, The lingering notes at length dissolve away. "
373,THE ALPINE HORN. (1),"When all is silent, on the mountain sod The humble shepherds bend the knee to God; They kneel in darkness and in peace, to share The sweet and social intercourse of prayer: With gleams of manly thought, their prayers arise, Like incense from the altar, to the skies. Their temple is the mountain and the mist, And theirs the shrine where minister the blest; They kneel before the Spirit of the world, He who this universe of mountains hurled Together with a word, and chaos spread Mid majesty and grandeur, dark and dread. Prostrate in presence of the Great First Cause, They own his power, while they obey his laws: Their thoughts are deeper than th' abyss beneath, Yet while their humble orisons they breathe, Their souls are soaring far beyond each height On which the stars are clustering, with the night; And while they view, with soul-admiring glance, The world of fancy, nature, and romance, That circles round their native rocks, they deem The glories of the earth an empty dream. "
374,THE ALPINE HORN. (1),"But hark! that horn again resounds aloud, Like sudden music bursting from a cloud: ""Good night!"" ""Good night!"" along the mountain breaks, ""Good night!"" ""Good night!"" again each echo wakes; And all the scene, below, around, above, Teems with ""Good night!"" the evening pledge of love. The eagle, soaring, waits upon the wing, Charmed with the notes the syren echoes sing; The startled chamois bounds along the hill, Yet, half-enraptured, turns to listen still; From mount to valley, and from wold to wild, The sounds are borne along, till, faint and mild, ""Good night,"" shall linger in the echoes' song, When all to silence and to sleep belong. "
375,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH. 
376,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"ONE day--the sunbeams danced along the glade As lovers dance upon their bridal eve-- I wandered to the wood, where all was bloom; The earth breathed fresh with fragrance, and the trees Dropped, as it were, the dew of silent joy. I loved to listen to the song of birds, Whose music wild, yet sweet, came o'er the ear, Telling of ecstasy; and, more than all, I loved to view the flowers, those stars of earth, As stars are flowers of heaven, those glimpses bright Of a far higher, purer, lovelier world; Those day dreams of Creation, blooming wild, Scattered on earth, like angel-smiles in heaven. Oh! I was happy then, for all above, And all below, was fair, and pure, and bright; And then I thought that happier still I'd be If my freed soul could fleet, as dew from grass, When the glad morning sun is shining forth, Passing so silently away from earth; If that were all--if death itself were _death_-- But after death comes life, more true than this. "
377,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"I lay and listened to a wild bird's song, A little shining, singing, flutt'ring thing: Its song was full of sweetness and of love: When, lo! it fell before me on the ground, And found its grave among a bank of flowers-- Who would not die, to find a grave so sweet? I ran and lifted it--'twas cold and stiff, And in its little heart an arrow sought Unsanctified admittance, quivering there, Like an unwelcome messenger of fate. The spoiler came--I drew his arrow out, And threw it on the earth--he trod it down, As he passed onward in his careless path. "
378,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"And this is death! How sudden, and how strong! His harvest ne'er begins nor ends, for still His scythe is ready ere the corn is ripe, We cannot shun the stroke; but if prepared To meet it when it falls, its sting is gone! "
379,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"Yet death itself is never terrible, But 'tis the thought of what comes after death That wakes the coward in the soul of man-- Of man carnal and unregenerate. In the lone grave the body soon is clothed In vileness, and this most delicate frame Becomes the food of worms, the gorging feast Of those vile particles of putresence We loathe in life to look at--which we spurn And trample on with horror. =Pride=, bend low! And meditate on this, that slimy worms, Gnome-like and insatiate epicures, Must feed on us to fulness, as on dainties, When we, like they themselves, become corruption! This is the pang, the poison, that makes dark The brightest joys, and chills the warmest hopes Of all who look no farther than the grave,-- That calms the laughing thought within the heart: This is the weapon that affrights the bold, Makes foolishness of wisdom, and creates The fear of death, because it terminates But in corruption and the feast of worms. "
380,REFLECTIONS ON DEATH.,"To go into the grave--if that were all, No one would shrink from it; but that the thought That this fair form should formless be, the shape Be shapeless, decomposed, and fall to nought, Preys on the mind, and hinders it from rest. And few there are who seek the saving peace That here can reconcile us to our doom. The soul remains entire, though in the grave The body lies, and slowly wastes away. Then let us strive to find, through God's good grace, That faith by which alone the soul becomes ""One perfect Chrysolite,"" and in Christ's blood, Relieved from stain of guilt, is rendered fit To stand, approved, before a holy God.

395,TO FAME.,"IN the seclusion of my solitude, Thy echo reached me, and awoke a brood Of slumbering fancies into life and light; A spell seemed thrown around me, and my mind Was full of unfixed images; the bright And ready impulses of thought, confined And struggling to be free; a light had dawned Across my path, as if by Heaven's command. "
396,TO FAME.,"A lofty and immeasurable longing Sprung up within my breast, beyond control, A throbbing multitude of fancies thronging Strove to o'ermaster and o'ermatch the whole: Creation rose from chaos, as at first, A water in the wilderness to quench my thirst. The complicated elements of Mind, No longer dim, confused, and undefined, Rolled into order, and the springs of thought Became then less obscure, and less remote. My mind, not yet in union with its thoughts, Seemed sad and solitary; o'er it swept A calmness like the soft sun-breeze that floats Above the wave, that light and languid leapt: Then high imaginations, restless, past Into being--various, vivid, vast-- And thought, admixing with the mind's emotion, Assumed a depth and fervour of devotion, The semblance and the hope, if not the true Sole inspiration of poetic lore; Then truth, at times, like light, came struggling through, And I was sad and heart-forgone no more. "
397,TO FAME.,"For thou became my mistress--I have thrown My heart and hope on thee--I cannot bear That, with my life, my name should pass away, And be forgot, when I am dead and gone; And in the grave, when mouldering in decay, That my remembrance should be buried there. I care not for the world, or the world's ways, I scorn alike its censure and its praise; But from the mental few, by heaven designed To rate and recognise a kindred mind, A sure approval I will strive to gain, For this is fame indeed,--all other is but vain.

To every flower o'erhung with dew, Whose leaves are blossoming for you; To the wild flowers far away, Bright and beautiful as they; From each blooming one to sip Sweets, like those of woman's lip, Oh! happy, happy, happy bee, Would it were as free to me! Away! away! for ever thus Your airy flight has past from us; And you are gone where flowers invite, A pilgrimage of rich delight. "
400,TO A BEE.,"But come not near the hollyhock, (2) Let not its blooms your fancy mock; Shun its nectaries so fair, Death is ever lurking there; On its petals if you light, You'll be seized with instant blight. Shun it as you onward fly! Sip its poison and you die! But hie thee to the lavender, Pretty little pilferer! Or the limetree, in whose breast You oft have sipped yourself to rest. Go, wanderer, to the healthful wild, By the heath-flower's bloom beguiled, Where sunshine, like a robe of gold, Flings its fond light o'er wood and wold; There, in the calyx of the flower, You love the best at noontide hour, Prepare the mead, whose luscious draught, The best of former nations quaff'd. Little rambler, do you know Why it is we love you so? It is for the ceaseless hymn, That you warble, as you swim Through the odoriferous air, Light as fairy gossamer-- 'Tis, for you are always gay, Making life a holiday, Flying leisurely o'er earth, A wingëd messenger of mirth. "
401,TO A BEE.,"When you meet the butterfly, 'Neath the lovely summer sky, Do you show to her the bower, That contains the sweetest flower? Or do you take herself to be, While thus wandering so free, A floweret floating on the air, Making all delightful there? "
402,TO A BEE.,"When the moon bursts forth above, Tinging all with light and love, When with soft and silky trace, Slumber finds a resting place On the eyes of bees and men; Snug within some floweret then You have made your bed, till day Shows the sweets your dreams pourtray. "

"
405,THE STORM.,"The clouds move like the billows o'er the ocean, Clashing in fury as they hurry by; They mingle fiercely, and in rude commotion, As if a hurricane swept o'er the sky. Now, let the soul rely on her devotion, Now, let the prayer to HIM be lifted high, Who stills the storm, and calms the mighty wave, ""And strong to smite, is also strong to save."" "
406,THE STORM.,"See! yon poor wretch dashed from the vessel's prow-- He catches at the spar that hurries past, 'Tis vain! the waves are mightier still--and now, Beneath their force his strength gives way at last: Onward we drift--but, lo! o'er heaven's brow The moon her welcome light, at length, has cast, Like hope o'er madness, but it tends to show The life that smiles above, the death that yawns below.

Stranger! so bright, so innocent, so fair, We give thee welcome to our world of care; Come to partake our sorrow--thou hast known The pang already, by that stifled moan-- When rosy pleasure shall her smiles renew, Come with thy kindred heart, and share them too.

The village song, the village dance is o'er: Why is the tabor silent on the plain? Why does the mountain-pipe refuse its strain? Where is the lover fond, the trusting maid? They shun each other, and desert the shade. Is _this_ Italia's sky, so calm, so fair? Where are its joyous sons, its laughing daughters where? · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · "
450,THE WOLF. (4),"Hark! 'tis a wild, a solitary cry, Unheard till now beneath Italia's sky; And well Italia's sons may shrink to hear A cry, that fills all who have heard with fear,-- It is the Alpine wolf's terrific bay, Roaming abroad ferocious for its prey: Soon as the sun of earth its farewell takes, The Alpine wolf his solitude forsakes, And, like a demon, rushing to the plain, Scatters the flock, and panic-strikes the swain. "
451,THE WOLF. (4),"One summer eve, a monster of the kind, Hungry for prey, had left his troop behind; Ranging alone, he spread dismay where'er His bay was heard, as if a host were there: Beneath his tusk of steel, his breath of flame, Italia's bowers a wilderness became: Grain for a while and sheep he stole away, But, quitting these, he sought a nobler prey,-- The tender babe, even in its mother's view, He bore to crags, where no one dared pursue: Until the province, late the happiest one That brightens 'neath Italia's gorgeous sun, Became, throughout, all desolate and lone, For there the fell destroyer forth had gone. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · "
452,THE WOLF. (4),"Lo! like a pageant, slowly up the vale, A band advances, clad in glittering mail; While, in the front, a knight of noble mien, And lofty plume, above the rest is seen: The peasants from their huts look forth with fear, But dare not quit them, lest the wolf be near; And then the chief, advancing from the rest, At sound of trump, the peasants thus addressed,-- ""A purse of gold, and his own diamond ring, As a reward, are offered by the king, To him who slays the wolf!"" The trumpet's blast Re-echoed loud, as that gay pageant passed. "
453,THE WOLF. (4),"Meanwhile, each swain, in hope to gain the prize, Shouldering his gun, to kill the monster tries; But home returning oft without his prey, All left the task to Giulio to essay,-- For Giulio was the best, the bravest youth Within the province, or the realm, in sooth: Kind to his mates, and to his mistress true, Foremost in pastime and in peril too; Whene'er the river overflowed its bounds, And the wild flood o'erswept the pleasant grounds, Bearing away, in its retiring course, The helpless flocks, too feeble for its force, Giulio was first among the village brave, To stretch the hand to succour and to save; He was a marksman too, and well could hit The target's eye, when all fell wide of it: Him, therefore, did they fix upon to be Their champion--their meadows rich to free From the destroyer--each resigned his claim To the reward,--Let Giulio win the same! "
454,THE WOLF. (4),"And Giulio ranged afar from morn till eve, But still no wolf could Giulio perceive; He searched each wood, explored each copse and cave, As a fierce gnome invades the quiet grave; Still did he hear his roar, his ravage see. But, still unseen himself, the wolf continued free. "

(4),"Three days had sped, and Giulio had not traced The monster out, although he tracked his waste; And standing on a mountain's rugged brow, Giulio, despairing, breathed to Heaven a vow, That he would bring the wolf in triumph slain, Or never see his native home again, And Giulio's vow was kept--the monster fell, But not by him--a sadder tale I tell! "
456,THE WOLF. (4),"One eve--it was the fourth--he threw him down, Fatigued and foot-sore, on the mountain brown; No wolf as yet had crossed his anxious way, Although, where'er he roamed, he heard his bay; Loth to return until the wolf he slew, Yet, ah! his heart, to love, to feeling, true, Led him to where his lover's hut arose, As if her vicinage could soothe his woes. There for awhile he lingered, and he wept The tear of fond remembrance--slumber crept Upon his eyes, for he was overspent, Wasted for want of needful nourishment: Before him in the moonlight rolled a stream, Whose murmur lulled him to a blissful dream: A dream of love, of happiness and pride,-- He thought he slew the wolf, and won his blushing bride. "
457,THE WOLF. (4),"Beyond the river, to its very edge Along the bank, there grew a bushy hedge, Where oft alone, beneath the twilight dim, The lovely maid would steal to think of him;-- A stir!--a motion!--it was not the breeze That shook the hedge,--for why waved not the trees? He started and awoke--again it shook,-- His gun was in his hand--one hurried look, One rapid touch--the fatal ball was sped,-- A long wild shriek was heard, and Giulio's dream was read. "
458,THE WOLF. (4),"In triumph now, he thought of home again,-- The prize was his, the wolf at length was slain-- Swift as the ball that from his rifle flew, He reached the river, and swam gaily through: The corpse lay there before him in the light!-- Why breaks that mournful shriek upon the night? Why motionless stands Giulio gazing there, A form of stone, a statue of despair? At length he spoke--""Is _this_ the wolf I've sought In glen, and mount, and precipice remote? Its skin is soft, its eyes are bright and fair, And still they smile on me,--the wolf's should glare; But sweet though sad, still do they charm my view, Like my fair bride's, the beautiful, the blue-- The wolf!--ah, horror! 'tis herself I've slain! I feel it, like a fire within my brain, And on my heart--no tear is in mine eye-- For her alone I lived,--with her I die."" The stream is near, he lifts her as a child, While from his o'erpressed heart there bursts a wild And fiendish laugh,--the peasants wondering hear, And in a crowd assemble, half in fear: In the broad moonlight then, as in a dream, A figure rushed before them to the stream; That form did bear another--on the brink He pauses not--one plunge--they sink! they sink! 'Twas Giulio and his bride!--they rise no more,-- And onward rolls the stream as smoothly as before. "
459,THE APRIL CLOUD.,THE APRIL CLOUD. 
460,THE APRIL CLOUD.,"FAIR as the feather of a dove That has in gloom been dipt; Like to a smile, that, flung from love, Its banishment hath wept; See yonder little cloud swims by, As if it sprung to birth, Mid summer sunshine of the sky, And winter storms of earth. "
461,THE APRIL CLOUD.,"Alas! there ne'er was angel yet Who from her heaven took wing, But when the air of earth she met Became a fallen thing: And thus yon cloud, that seems so dim, When near our earth 'tis driven, Would look all light, if it would skim Far upward nearer Heaven. "
462,SPRING.,SPRING. 
463,SPRING.,"CAN aught be more magnificent than Spring? Mountain and mead, and foliage and flower, Assume a bridal look, as if the Sun Had solemnized his nuptials with the Earth. A green and growing grandeur consecrates The general land, like an anointed Queen; The soil begins to quicken with the birth, And bounteously proseminates its gifts; A glory reigns supreme o'er all, a Balm That moves, like Inspiration, in the soul, And gives a motive to each quiet thought, Stirring, in transport, like a little bird. Creation seems a path to brighter worlds-- A track to better homes. A permeant good Pervades the Universe, and all is joy. The river runs, like one of nimble foot, And smiling aspect, to embrace the sea, Henceforth incorporate; even as the youth, Of fervent spirit and of sanguine hope, Comes from his home obscure, and wanders forth To mingle with the world, and there is lost. The ruminating Ocean is at peace, And its faint murmur--for its voice is ne'er All silent--like a half forgotten tone Seems but the echo of a broken chime, As if a part of memory, pilgrim-like, Had gone in quest of all, and died away Amid the distant traces of the past. The gentle breeze comes from its groves of spice, And fragrance bears throughout the Virgin air; And hark! the woodland music--warblings soft Steal on the gladdened ear--from every hedge, From every forest dim, a voice proceeds Of deep-felt rapture, praise and gratitude. The swan disports upon the quiet lake, And shares the cheerfulness that all enjoy; While thoughts, without a voice, of Heaven remote In the still waters mirrored, stir its breast.-- All circumstance of language is too faint The beautiful of Nature to pourtray; The eloquent sense, the feeling sensitive, Alone holds free communion with her charms: While thought awakes, like day-dawn, and goes forth To gather stores of knowledge;--like a draught Of the pure fountain to the unrefreshed, The bloom of Spring exhilarates the mind, And gives a tone to virtue--its approach Is as the coming of sweet health to one Long time afflicted, for its bloom is blest. "
464,POESY.,POESY. 
465,POESY.,"ITS sweetest song the cygnet sings As a soft prelude to its death, And in that song expends its breath;-- What boots it that the Poet flings His wildest notes on high, Or strikes with truest hand the strings, If all his strains must die? And why should he his notes prolong, If no one listens to his song? "
466,POESY.,"Yet can the Poet ne'er resign The lyre he loves, for it alone Consoles him, when all else is gone; Its spirit, like the breath divine, That stirred the water's face, Pervades ev'n to the farthest line Of universal space; And music through the whole is flung, As when the morning angels sung. "
467,POESY.,"An echo lingers on each peak, In every vale, on every hill-- Should men not listen, angels will; For Poesy shall never speak, Shall never sing in vain; In solitude the breeze shall seek And still repeat her strain, Where'er, like an aërial tone, Her spirit and her voice have gone. "
468,POESY.,"She moves o'er flowers--her handmaid fair, Bright Summer, in a joyous dance Doth still before her path advance, Sweet blossoms strewing every where, Which, falling, grow divine; Fresh incense crowds upon the air, And floats above her shrine, Like beauty, when her welcome voice Makes the whole universe rejoice. "
469,POESY.,"Why then should her adorer fear, Or why her votary despond?-- Partaker of a bliss beyond All feelings, all enjoyments here, His impulses sublime Soar, ev'n in this contracted sphere, O'er nature and o'er time; And her undying triumphs spread A glow like glory round his head. "

Would I could roam down where the Mermaid laves Her half-formed limbs!--for Envy comes not there, Nor Pride nor Hatred, nor is Malice sent, Nor the deep sullenness of dark Despair. Would I were not of earth--but of the sea! And held communion with its creatures fair: Gentle in its gentleness, but whene'er A tempest shook it, and the winds were free, My bounding spirit would delight to soar, Float in its foam, and revel in its roar!

"
491,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Thrice Sacred Mount! how oft hast thou, (Though none but pilgrims tread thee now,) Been hallowed as the blest abode Of the Most High! Jehovah! God! Whene'er in furthering his plan Of mercy and of love to man, He deigned to touch our earth, to hold Communion with his Seers of old, His presence consecrated thee, His temple and his throne to be. 'Twas on thy Mount that God, concealed Within the burning bush, revealed To Moses his command, to free His people from their slavery. There, from the midst of fire and flame, He did his perfect law proclaim: Then seemed God's presence in their sight, A great, a mighty burst of light Upon thy topmost mount, a fire Devouring, brighter, deeper, higher, Than e'er their eyes beheld, a crown Of glory on thy head, that down Through all the desert brightness past, Like wild flame from a holocaust: And gazing on thy glorious height,  } Israel was dazzled by the sight     } Of that intolerable light.          } "
492,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Pursued by persecution's flame, Elijah to the desert came; And as he rested in thy cave, Which shelter and concealment gave, God spoke! he lay entranced in fear, ""Elijah! speak! what dost thou here?"" He answered,--""Jezabel abhorred Hath put the prophets to the sword, And I alone escaped, to be A prophet and a priest to thee."" Then the Almighty gave command, ""Go forth, and on the mountain stand!"" But ere Elijah could reply, A great and mighty wind passed by, Which rent the mountains and the rocks In pieces, by resistless shocks: The desert sands uprose afar, Moving like giant forms in war; But, when the tempest ceased to rave, Elijah still within the cave, Remained unhurt, unmoved, alone-- A mighty earthquake's shock anon Shook to its base the Sacred Mount, And soon a fire, like a small fount, Came bursting from the highest spot, Increasing, but consuming not. The earthquake vanished as it came, And after it that holy flame; And hark! a still small voice was heard, Like sweetest music from a bird; A still small voice! that speaks to youth Of wisdom, piety, and truth: Elijah heard--with solemn pace, (His mantle covering his face,) He rose and stood without the cave, Relying on God's power to save: The hurricane had past away, And calm and bright the prospect lay; Far up the double mountain stood, Varied by water and by wood; He saw the herbage thickly grow, The bubbling springs, and far below He saw the semicircular fount, That like a bent bow skirts the mount; He saw the desert spread beneath, Like an extended vale of death; He saw the blue sky far above, Light up in one bright blaze of love; A burst, of sunshine fell on him, To which all other light was dim; He heard again that still small voice, Which made his inmost heart rejoice: It was the Lord! and power he gave Elijah, to anoint and save. "
493,MOUNT HOREB. (5),"Thrice Blessed Mount! thou art a sign, A type of penitence divine; Whene'er in darkness and in fear, We wander in the desert drear Of sin, and doubt, the welcome light Of truth breaks sudden on our sight; The heart becomes a hallowed dome, Where holy feelings find a home; For there the law of God secure, Makes every thought and impulse pure: Repentance may be slow to bring Comfort and healing on its wing; The doubting sinner in despair, Asks, trembling, in a hurried prayer, If guilt like his, of foulest trace, Can hope for pardon and for grace: But, when such doubts are swept away, The still small voice of truth bears sway: For Jesus died and rose again, To free the world from guilt and pain: Jesus, the only Son of God, Like Moses, takes the gospel rod, And strikes the barren rock within, Hardened by wickedness and sin-- Whence springs a living well, to free The thirsty soul from misery. He, like Elijah from his cave, Came to the world with power to save; And Israel, trusting to his aid, Shall innocent and pure be made; Redeemed, shall reach the heavenly land, Supported by his mighty hand.

570,TRUTH.,"Yet as within the desert far, There are reflections given Of light, so in the heart there are Remembrances of Heaven. "
571,SABBATH MORN.,SABBATH MORN. 
572,SABBATH MORN.,"ON Sabbath morn, one feels Exalted 'bove the world, and longs to go Forth to the house of God; and, as the slow And solemn church-chime on him steals, "
573,SABBATH MORN.,"He seems to tread the height Of Heaven, rise with his risen Lord, and there Pour out his soul in never-ceasing prayer, And worship with the saints in light. "
574,SABBATH MORN.,"And peace, and joy, and faith Are his, and all things that the earth contains, And all above, through the Redeemer's pains, And groans, and victory o'er death! "
575,SABBATH MORN.,"Glory to Him who willed That man should live, not die! to Him who made The Sabbath for our comfort, and who said The soul on Christ its hopes should build! "
576,SABBATH EVE.,SABBATH EVE. 
577,SABBATH EVE.,"ON Sabbath eve, how sad, Yet sweet, the thoughts that come into the mind, Unbid, but not unwelcome, and which find Communion there, and to its solace add. "
578,SABBATH EVE.,"The world seems bright no more; Its witching charms are gone, its voice is dumb: Vainly its pleasures to the soul say ""Come!"" The wish for their enjoyment now is o'er. "
579,SABBATH EVE.,"Thoughts of the dead are they Which then we feel, low whispering to the heart, Telling that we, like them, must soon depart, And, with them, go to dull and cold decay. "
580,SABBATH EVE.,"How strange it is, in sooth, That Sabbath morn and eve should, to the breast, Weary with cares of life, bring thoughts of REST-- Strong proof of its great purpose and its truth! "
581,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,DREAMS OF THE LIVING. 
582,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"NO golden dreams, near quiet streams, On swelling slopes, no high-reached hopes; These of themselves are mute: The spirit wakes, the fancies shoot Where Nature points, but she Thought curbs, not renders free, Unless her portals wide she opes, And gives of Truth the fruit. "
583,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"And man, a dreamer from his youth, Ne'er knoweth, nor can know, the truth, Save when Religion with its light Shines on his mind, to guide his sight. From every day that dawns, he claims New thoughts, new fancies, and new aims, That lead to nothing, nothing leave, But vague ideas that deceive! "
584,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"Boyhood is dreaming, when it quits Substantial joys for counterfeits; Courts pleasure as a lasting thing, Nor deems it bears a hidden sting; And yields all feeling and all sense, For hopes that bring no recompense. Well, when its follies it forsakes, And from its feverish dreams awakes! "
585,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"The loveliness of woman gives More cause for dreams than aught that lives; And youth, when it aspires to find Gladness in beauty, wanting mind, Like guileless child, is ever dreaming Of joy and brightness only seeming; And knows not, till the dream is past, What spells around the heart are cast. "
586,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"And manhood dreams,--when o'er the soul Ambition has secured control,-- Of power, and wealth, and worldly state, And all the splendours of the great: Builds monuments, to which decay Clings as a resting-place and prey, Nor thinks how weak are all his pains, When nothing at the last remains. "
587,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"And age, that ought to know the best, Is but a dreamer like the rest; O'erlooking, in its downward pace, The landmarks of its upward race; No wisdom from the past it earns, And from the present only learns To dread the future; and its staff Writes its own weary epitaph. "
588,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"What dream they of? Earth, with its feelings cold, Its passions withered, tales that have been told, And generations dead--the same dull tone That from the chambers of the past hath gone, Is echoed now; but, as before, its strain, For warning, or for teaching, is in vain! "
589,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"And hearts on which has come the early blight, And hopes that never knew aught here but slight, And scattered flowers, and blossoms tossed and shaken, And promises foregone, and trusts forsaken, Still show men's visions false, but still they cherish Dreams of the earth, which only lure to perish. "
590,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"No glow of life, no ante-taste of heaven, From sordid earth-born thoughts like theirs is given; But disappointment, with its lagging train Of blighted prospects, tells that all is vain; Yet to this earth's allurements fixed, the heart, Like a wrecked vessel, drifts, without a chart. Truth teaches higher hopes, and better things, And o'er the mind a lasting solace brings. "
591,DREAMS OF THE LIVING.,"Oh! that the soul on Heaven were ever bent, And all its feelings thitherward were sent! Then would our visions from the world arise, Clear as the sun, and radiant as the skies: Visions of light and love that ne'er decay, No strifes to scare, no terrors to dismay; But peace, unchanging as the Christian's faith-- Peace in our life, untroubled hope in death! "
592,LINES.,LINES. 
593,LINES.,"MAN knows he is immortal: there's within A principle that tells him that his soul, Which in himself exists, shall never die, Although his outward tenement becomes, By the slow-wasting chemistry of death, Forgotten, undistinguishable dust. His mind, his heart, his impulses, are all Subservient to his soul, his noblest part, That came from God, returns to God again. If he his passions could o'ercome and sway, Place Prudence as a wary sentinel On all his words and purposes, that trip He might in neither, he were great indeed! But sense and selfishness his judgment warp, And so debase his nature, that, having not Of his own mind the moral mastery, His thoughts, affections, powers, and faculties, Are under the dominion of a yoke More galling than a tyrant's. Slave of Sin! "

595,SONNETS.,"_Written on viewing the Picture of ""The Deluge,"" painted by F. Danby, Esq., A.R.A._ "
596,SONNETS.,"WE gaze in awe upon the solemn scene, With sense and soul absorbed, as if the sight Were tranced in that o'erpowering vengeful light Which shrouds the setting sun; and what has been A world is now a waste of waters, higher And darker swells the flood, like one vast pall Thrown o'er the guilty ones of earth, Heaven's ire Who braved ere-while.--How fearful, how sublime, How terrible the sight!--widely they climb, To rock and mountain top to 'scape their doom, While rushing torrents, dome and palace hall, The work of man with man himself, consume; Nor these alone! Rock, cliff, and mountain grey, God's handiwork, become with man, their prey! "
597,SONNETS.,"How vast the guilt that thus could doom a world So beautiful as ours was ere man sinned,-- The waters sweeping, like a mighty wind, To whelm the earth, from its foundations hurled; All nature stood aghast, its course was changed-- A comet threw afar its lurid gleam, Up-broke the fountains of the ocean stream, While a fierce earthquake thro' the centre ranged, Shattering the mountains in its might.--How vain Was then the strength of man, as poor his pride, To stem the onsweep of that ceaseless tide, Which desolation spread o'er mount and plain! Anguish and terror, madness and despair, Took hold on all, before they perished there! "
598,SONNETS.,"A towering rock, whose shadow in past days Was hailed by weary ones a place of rest, Affords brief shelter on its shelving breast To struggling sufferers crowding from all ways, Trampling their fellows down for life, sweet life! Alas! the JUDGMENT'S on them, they as well Might build their hopes on sand, as stay the swell Of the full flood and elemental strife. Yet has not God forgotten all his love To sinful men, the ARM they madly brave ""Though strong to smite is also strong to save""-- The ark floats high a buried world above! While o'er a lifeless pair, to Heaven still dear, A kneeling Angel drops a pitying tear! (7) "
599,THOUGHT.,THOUGHT. 
600,THOUGHT.,"LIKE one who on a mountain stands, When morning into day expands, And, as a glory, views from Heaven The plenteousness of brightness given; Even so is he, who marks remote The early cheering dawn of thought Advancing o'er th' awakened mind, Till truth, within the soul defined, Spreads light and knowledge in the breast, And sets all doubts and fears at rest.

603,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,_20th July 1840._ 
604,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"FAIR as the summer in its joyous prime, Free from all thoughts of guile, all dread of ill, Unconscious that a traitor could exist Within her wide dominions, forth she came, Young, happy, unattended, save by him, The husband she had chosen from the world; All hearts her own--no other guard she wished-- When ambushed treason aimed its coward blow, Which Heaven ordained should harmless pass her by, In mercy to the realms that own her sway. "
605,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"Ah! had the public foe, in hostile league, Come openly against her life and crown, The chivalry of England, not yet dead, Had promptly flown to arms, and formed Around her then a shield impenetrable, Her sacred person to defend, or die. From out of England's millions, only one Was found, so void of all the feelings of a man, As point a deadly weapon at the breast Of England's pride--a woman and a Queen! Then the high bravery of her race was shown; She blenched not, quivered not, but sat erect; While, with the lion courage of the Saxon, Which both their hearts inspired, her consort threw Himself at once between her and the danger, To shield the life so dear to him and us. "
606,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"The loyal heart of Britain beat with joy At their escape--the young, the loved, the true! Many and fervent were the prayers breathed To Heaven, that they might live extended years, And each year, as it came, their happiness Increase, and ours! Thus let the traitor's hopes For ever end, thus fruitless be his aims-- His snares recoil upon himself alone! "
607,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"How beautiful the trait of filial love, Of reverence daughterly, was then evinced, When, freed from danger from th' assassin's arm, She promptly to her mother hastes, herself To be the foremost bearer of the tidings, And, in her own particular person, bring The proof and the assurance of her safety, Ere Rumour's tongue had magnified details! Ah! worthy of her people's love, is she Who thus could show the veneration due, At such a time, to her who gave her being! "
608,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"The ways of men are in the hands of One Who cannot err; the destinies of all On earth, peasants as well as potentates, Are under His sole guardianship and guidance. A truism this; yet there are men who doubt, Nay, worse, deny it; even though instances, Occurring daily, show the constant care Of Providence o'er thoughtless, sinful men. "
609,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"How oft does evil o'er our head impend, And we not know it, till the danger's past! How oft, when evil comes, provided is A remedy, we know not how or whence! Ah! blind, and worse than blind, are they who doubt. The brutish beasts that roam the fields and woods, And never heard of God, or gospel truth, Of Christ and his salvation, better are, And wiser, than the Atheist and Sceptic. "
610,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"High is the sovereign's power, and great the sway Which kings possess; but, higher, greater still Is His, the King of Kings, who overrules All things for good to them who love his laws. "
611,WRITTEN ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN.,"Tyrants have had avengers, but the good Need fear no peril, dread no coming ill; Their trust in One who fails not, cannot fail; In whose hand is the breath of princes held, As much as meaner men's. To Him thy way commit. "

It long has the bulwark been of our rights, Of our freedom still the stay; Then give to the brave old British ship, Three British cheers--hurrah! "
630,THE STOUT OLD BRITISH SHIP.,"When Nelson trode its quarter-deck, Its glory was in its prime; Victory he had at his finger-beck, As proved in every clime: Then England was honoured and feared by all, And nations sung her praise; But that is a tale we may not recall In these degenerate days: For the stout old ship lies idly ashore, Laid up like a useless tree; Its battles and cruises now are o'er, Though it still is fit for sea! "
631,THE STOUT OLD BRITISH SHIP.,"The vaunting foreigner long has felt Its thunders on the main, And he smiles when he thinks the blows it dealt Shall ne'er be dealt again. But the spirit of Nelson is not dead, It bounds in a hundred hearts, And his story of fame is remembered and read, And studied with our charts! For cherished with care is the glory it won, The meed of a thousand years; And its foes will fly as they often have done, When the stout old ship appears! "
632,THE STOUT OLD BRITISH SHIP.,"When the brave old ship, as bright as morn, Hoists high its well-known flag; The flag that has still been unsullied borne, Since the days of Drake and Sprague. Let's see who'll dare dispute its right, To the empire of the main, 'Twill prove its title clear and bright, Against the world again! Then give to the stout old British ship, Of our freedom still the stay, That long has the bulwark been of our rights, Three British cheers--hurrah! "

643,THE MARTYRS.,"Calmly the martyr Guthrie met his fate, A victim to oppression's cruel laws, Nor would, for proudest prelate's form and state, A traitor turn to his dear Master's cause; With him no joy on earth so great could be, As thus to die for Christ's supremacy. "

674,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Grace Adam was a farmer's daughter,-- Her father had approved her choice; For duty and her feelings taught her 'Twere best to have her parents' voice. "
675,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Oft as the summer sunset glowing Came down in splendour o'er the west, The lovers forth together going, Would wander to the eagle's nest. "

697,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Bent near the Doctor then, and laid he His hand upon her wasted breast, And with low cheerful whisper said he No more words than ""the eagle's nest!"" "
698,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"The change was sudden and amazing,-- Opened her eyes and closed again, And like the keel of vessel grazing The ground, grated her teeth in twain. "
699,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Gasped a long breath, as if a struggle Were going on, as night with morn, No sound made but a low faint guggle, Like cry of infant newly born. "
700,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"A smile passed o'er her features sunken, Grasped she the hand beside her then, Remembrance, just as one half-drunken, Strove to retrace its course again. "
701,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Ah! then came back the well-known faces Of her young days upon her mind, The scenes of long ago, in traces All clear and full and well defined. "
702,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"She saw her father as he taught her Her youthful lessons at his knee, Where Mississippi's mighty water Rolls like a full flood to the sea. "
703,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"She saw her mother too beside her Long, long since taken to her rest, And then, as opened Memory wider, She stood beneath the eagle's nest, "
704,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"With him she loved, in courtship prudent, And of love's sweetest cup she drank, She saw again the youthful student,-- All that came after was a blank. "
705,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Thus ever Memory touched can bring time, With its past feelings into light, And thus the sweet joys of her spring-time Came rushing thickly on her sight. "
706,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Thus, too, doth roused Imagination Vibrate the tender chords that bind The wide links of Association Within the chambers of the mind. "
707,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"Then turned the fever, as the meeting Of the free air upon her brain, Her pulse resumed a quickened beating, Revolved the wheels of life again. "
708,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"And day by day she gained new strength then Beneath the Doctor's care and skill, Able to quit her bed at length then, 'Twas this she loved to talk of still, "
709,THE EAGLE'S NEST.,"That when Death's dart did o'er her hover, And she could find no sleep or rest, 'Twas this that made her to recover, The simple words, ""the eagle's nest!"" (9) "

713,THE ADVENT OF TRUTH.,"As sunshine comes with healing on its wing, After long nights of sorrow and unrest, Solace and peace, and sympathy to bring To the grieved spirit and unquiet breast. "
714,THE ADVENT OF TRUTH.,"No more shall then be heard the slave's deep groan, Nor man man's inhumanity deplore, All strife shall cease and war shall be unknown, And the world's golden age return once more. "

721,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"BALMY as the dew from its own blossoms, And soothing as the fragrance it creates, Comes the sweet influence of this summer eve To my o'erchargëd heart--there is a breeze Moving amid the foliage, soft and low, As cradled murmur from a babe asleep. It is a time for holy thoughts to spring, And contemplation fill the awakened mind. "
722,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"Lo! a bright sunbeam stands 'tween heaven and earth, Taking its farewell look ere day departs, And seeking still to light the gloom below, As Hope,--even when the darkness comes, and Joy Hath fled,--to cheer the heart, still lingering, smiles: And when it goes,--ah! no, it ne'er all goes:-- The sunbeam fades, a moment, and its light, All shed, dies still-born, swiftly shone and o'er; But Hope, blest Hope, ev'n when it seems away, Is near, evermore near, it cannot live Apart, 'tis wedded to the soul for aye,-- God joined them twain, and nought can sunder them,-- Near, ever near, and ever bringing peace, Groping among the dark things of man's spirit, And shedding o'er the troubled mind its light, As a stray ray of sunshine wanders 'mong The shattered arches of a fallen ruin. "
723,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"Ere sunset leaves the world, and sinks behind The illumined ocean, let me muse awhile. "
724,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"'Twas in a garden that that hideous thing, Sin, first was born accurst, and now all through The wide wide universe it ranges fierce. Where man has placed his foot its trace is seen. The serpent's slimy trail is everywhere, Disfiguring, polluting, and destroying, Death following in its track inseparably. "
725,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"But oh! my soul be humbled, yet rejoice;-- It was, too, in a garden that the great, The only all-sufficient, all-atoning Propitiatory sacrifice for sin Commenced its consummation, when the Man Christ Jesus swat for thee great drops of blood, (Even he, the Second Person of the Godhead,) And prayed in agony that the cup might pass, If so his Father willed; but none on earth Or yet in Heaven could drink it, none save Him; And when the sacrifice was all complete On Calvary, and satisfied was Justice, Mercy and Hope held out their hands to man, And, in Christ's name, showed him redemption's way. The shame and misery that Adam felt In Eden's garden, when the first great sin Was challenged, was as nothing to compare With the deep agony which on that night,-- That dreadful night in which he was betrayed,-- Our Surety felt, when in Gethsemane He took upon himself to pay the full Ransom and penalty of that first sin Which Adam sinned, and all his race in him. "
726,SUGGESTED BY A WALK IN A GARDEN.,"Of that first sin did Adam put the blame On Eve, ""the woman whom thou gavest me."" Eve on the serpent shifted it, and proud Was he that he had circumvented both, Doomed on his womb to crawl in dust, and bruised His head by woman's seed, short-lived his pride.-- Christ took upon Himself the sin and all Its anguish, nor like Adam vainly strove To shift it to another, knowing well No other could redeem it but Himself. Sinless, a sacrifice for sin, that sin Might from the souls of men be washed away. 'Twas for that sin, and its infeftments wide That Jesus died, that its entail cut off Might be from Adam and his lineage, far As generations yet to come extend, And man restored to his lost paradise. No flaming sword waves at its portals now, Entrance to bar to the redeemed on earth; No angels guard the gates to keep them shut, But open ever are they to the elect, And there bright angels stand, with joy To welcome all who come in Christ's name in.

Oh! on our pathway thus may sunshine fall, And like the little flowers, our hopes still bloom,-- A share of it at least, if not it all,-- To light the darkness and to cheer the gloom. "

749,WINTER.,"COME! we will wander to the lone hill-side, And, awe-struck, view the winter in its pride;-- Crispy the grass and scant; The little flowers have vanished, not a trace Is left of blossom on pale Nature's face:-- Restraint lies mighty on the stream--it sings No more--dead, dead now,--like all other things; The trees, as spectres gaunt, Or churchyard monuments, all scattered stand, As if they mourned the bareness of the land,-- Meagre as pallid want. Where be the fairies now, the little fays, That dance in buttercups in summer days, Though only Poets view Their gambols in the flowers and in the rays Of noonday, which the common sight gainsays, To Fancy ever new! "
750,WINTER.,"The grasshopper is gone. Ah, me! can death Have will to stop _its_ modicum of breath? Swift fly the clouds, why should they fly so swift? Come they like Angel-spirits, with a gift Of mercy to mankind? In this drear time, the heart asks where are they That tell of sunshine being on the way? The harbingers of light and genial heat, That make the meadows and the valleys sweet When softly sighs the wind: Make rich the upland grass to mountain goat, When balm and beauty through the ether float, Like gossamer reclined. Oh! for a cheerful note from blackbird--gone, All gone, the songster and his song are flown; There's nought to cheer the ear. Oh! now to list the mavis in the wood,-- The psalms of Nature's singers, always good, Bring solace to the year. "

754,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Like skittish horse, or stubborn pig, Or other self-willed creature, That in the public highways shows Its vile and perverse nature. "
755,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"There's many a lesson taught to man, But little does he mind them, Many's the warning given to him,-- He throws them all behind him. "
756,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But let me a short tale relate Instead of moralising, You'll prize it more, I dare to say, Than any such premising. "
757,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The sun was shining on the hills, The countryside looked sweeter, And brighter and more beautiful Than I can tell in metre. "
758,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"It was the spring-time of the year, That pleasant balmy season, When freshness passes o'er the earth, And come the buds the trees on. "
759,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"When Nature young looks, and is young, But though she dresses gaily, The time grows old, for Time, like man, Grows older daily, daily! "
760,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Ah me! that men should be so weak As not to read the lesson,-- Ripe fruits are offered them, but they The garbage love to mess on. "
761,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"One day along a country road With hedge and hawthorn bristling, A country lad was passing, and In merry mood was whistling. "
762,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Stout was he and his joints well knit, And firm as time-tried timber, But light withal and agile too, No sapling yet was limber. "
763,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Anon a horseman came that way Who sat on horseback rarely, This the horse knew as well as he, And so had bolted fairly. "
764,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The young man eyed him as he came And was by no means idle, For as he passed he leapt in front, And caught him by the bridle. "
765,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The horse reared back, and with the shock His rider fell right over Among the mud, and well for him The place was soft as clover. "
766,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Brought to his feet, without a hurt, But all o'er very muddy, He thanked the lad, well-pleased to find He sound was and unbloody. "
767,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He was a thin spare man, and past Mid-life, and looking sickly; Not that his health was touched at all, Or that his limbs were weakly; "
768,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But he had been for many years In towns a constant dweller, Confined to business close, and this On health is oft a teller. "
769,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He had an eye for bales and goods, And turnings of the market; But for the country's picturesque, His shadow rare did dark it. "
770,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He rode out had to breathe the air, And give his nerves a bracing, His steed unruly had become, His horsemanship disgracing. "
771,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The countryman pulled up some grass, No readier thing appearing, And rubbed him down in ostler style, The mud from off him clearing. "
772,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And then for having saved his life,-- To cut my tale the shorter,-- He offered him, as a reward, To take him as his porter; "
773,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And if he showed capacity, To give him education, To make him fit in course of time, To fill a higher station. "
774,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The youth agreed to't, for he thought, (While handing back the bridle) He'd like the change, besides just then He happened to be idle. "
775,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"In Glasgow busy city now, Behold this country clown bred, First porter and then junior clerk, And learning to be town bred. "
776,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Years passed, the sun shines once a day, But days make years, and every Sun that rises counts one, thus time Flows on, as water rivery. "
777,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Through all gradations of the desk The youth, still true and steady, Had risen till, from senior clerk, He partner was already. "
778,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The merchant now, as commerce had To counting-house long held him, Resolved to take his ease at last, And came to business seldom: "
779,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The junior partner and head-clerk Care of the cash-box keeping, While he himself had chosen to be What's called the partner sleeping. "
780,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The countryman, no longer young, Had toiled both late and early, And gained some wealth, and 'twas his boast That he had won it fairly. "
781,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But with it he had learnt betimes And aye the more the faster, Some of the city's ways that were Not pleasing to his master. "
782,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He ne'er had married, and was fond Of being hospitable; For 'twas his pride always to have His friends around his table: "
783,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And so extravagant became, To feasting much addicted, And rich wines drinking, which of course His income much restricted. "
784,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"One night his master was in town And heard he had a party, An old man now, not wanting sense, But humorous and hearty; "
785,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"Yet this he to himself oft thought, He thought that 'twas a pity, His clerk should spend his money in Thus feasting all the city. "
786,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"And so resolved to call on him And bring him to his senses, Not by a lecture commonplace Of prudence and expenses: "
787,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"But by a something which he had, A sort of old memento, That in his judgment was well worth Of lectures grave a cento. "
788,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"It was a frosty night, and there Had been a fall of snow on, The slippery streets required great skill And caution them to go on. "
789,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"With but one fall, he reached the house, The entrance well he knew there, Sudden and unexpected burst Amidst the jovial crew there. "
790,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The gas burnt clear, the host looked blue, And not the lights, as use is When one particular guest appears That no one introduces. "
791,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He said, ""Lies the skeleton frost On one street and another, ""I tripped and fell, and where I lay One skeleton hugged his brother. "
792,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""His breath is on each pane congealed, Cold enters through each portal, ""How my teeth chatter with the cold, A sign that we are mortal. "
793,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"""What's this, a banquet spread and rich, The wines all bright and glowing, ""No thought of this when you I met Along the road-side going."" "
794,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"He then produced a bundle which He opened with derision, And singly held up the contents To their astonished vision. "
795,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"There was the wellworn hairy cap, The corderoys to back it, His host had owned, and there too was His former fustian jacket. "
796,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"These were the clothes the country lad Had on at their first meeting, And these he now brought forth to be To him his present greeting; "
797,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"That he might pause in his career Of jollity and revel, Lest in his age, reduced he should Be to his former level. "
798,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"'Tis strange that human conduct oft So reckless is and hollow, That when the right path reason shows, It seeks the wrong to follow. "
799,HUMAN CONDUCT.,"The master having said and done, Quick vanished from them after: The host attempted at the time To turn it off with laughter. Next morn reflection made him take The hint,--and to be brief then,-- Though roughly put, 'twas kindly meant,-- He turned o'er a new leaf then. "

He had a good black coat upon his back, And deemed himself respectable,--he said, too, That he who verses writes will never do Well in the world, that his character is gone, And he himself no better than a drone. So having said he walked away well pleased;-- Now that's a man, I say, whose mind's diseased. Has he in summer ever watched a rose Burst into blossoming, and as it grows More and more beautiful, sweeten all the air With its rich perfume,--poetry was there. "
826,THE POET.,"A sunbeam thrown across The clouds, that makes them glow With light ineffable To eyes from earth below; A small wave of the sea When the vast ocean waits The coming of the storm, That slightly agitates Its surface passing,--as When of danger near First made aware, the roused Lion, though not in fear Looks up, the watchfire then Kindling in his eye, His mane scarcely as yet Moved, nor erected high His head, but his proud glance Circling keen, rapid, stern,-- There poetry is seen By one that can discern. A priest of Nature's own, One she herself ordains, The poet walks in brightness, And still new blessings gains. The sky above hath in it More beauty to his sight, Than to the world it shines In its canopy of light. "

The ocean in its vastness, He loves, too, as he sees It driven by the tempest, Or slumbering in the breeze. It brings into his vision The coming of that day, When Time within Eternity Shall merge itself away. "
829,THE POET.,"The forest trees antique Are his familiar friends, With the spirit of the woods His own for ever blends: And voices of the past, With fancies of old times, Do their murmurings recall Which he fondly puts in rhymes. "
830,THE POET.,"Echoes of distant lands Beyond the western sea, Or in the burning east, Where'er they chance to be, Are brought to him at night And cheer his spirit then, When sleep forsakes the eyes Of care-worn worldly men. And ever for his kind Doth his spirit warmly yearn, And his verses speak of things Which only he can learn. "

833,THE POET.,"Such, yea and more, the poet is, Had he had a choice Of destinies, if in his fate Had been heard his voice; It might have been so that he had Been a worldling born, And looked solemn like his scorners, And had gravely worn A black coat too, of fashion's cut, And smoothed trim his beard, And shook his head wisely, and been Sententious, and feared The world's opinion, and condemned Poetry as idle, But in his vocation he can Ne'er his feelings bridle. His thoughts are in a stronger hand Than his own, his mind Has thinks passing in it still, that Cannot be confined: Like the birds flying as they list Through the summer air, Or the clouds driven by the breeze Floating everywhere.

876,THE GAME OF LIFE.,THE GAME OF LIFE. 
877,THE GAME OF LIFE.,"WATCHING the game of life as daily played, One marvels at the blunders that are made; Few trust to chance alone to gain their aim, But with the means they use 'tis just the same. Low cunning some employ, and call it skill, Or substitute for Reason headstrong Will; And when they win the prize for which they strive, To their own genius they the credit give; But when they lose, the blame on fate is thrown; They never think the fault may be their own. Others who boast that cunning they disdain, Affect by Pride their purposes to gain; High-reaching objects do their minds devise, By which they blind their own and neighbours' eyes; Aiming at lofty things, they highly rate Their own designings, but they find too late That for success mere unassisted Pride Does not all necessary means provide; So thinking surely to promote their aim, And win the stake of their ambition's game, But not particular as to how 'tis played, They call, Pride's contrast, meanness to their aid: Yet ev'n though Fortune should their hopes attend, It does not change the matter in the end; Meanness and Pride may climb the highest hill, But Pride and meanness they continue still. "
878,THE GAME OF LIFE.,"Since Life's a game where all their part must play, Reason and Truth should in it have the sway, Or wanting these, as is too oft the case, Folly and Passion will usurp their place. "
879,THE GAME OF LIFE.,"When this weak body dwindles into dust, And man becomes the nothing that he must, How puny then will to the soul appear All that man toils and struggles for when here! Bound to the narrow aims and views of Earth, At death his spirit finds that all is dearth That to this world relates, and well that he Makes Time provide still for Eternity. "

Upon her brow, o'er which the tresses wave, The cold dew gathers, dankly, of the grave, And in her pale mild eyes a lustre shines, As if her spirit, as she wastes, refines; While ever and anon her sunken cheek, Life's fading beauties delicately streak; As the departing sun from ocean's brinks Sheds out its glories brightly ere it sinks!

885,CHANGE.,"On the bud and on the flower, On the child and man grown grey, Change is passing every hour, Death has set his snare to slay. "
886,CHANGE.,"And the feelings when they glow With a taste of joy intense, Soon a tinge of sadness know, Dimming quickly all the sense. "
887,CHANGE.,"Vainly do we strive to keep Such scant solace as we feel, Blight unseen on all doth creep, Pleasures hidden stings conceal. "

906,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,THE VALLEY OF LIFE. 
907,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,"IN the still midnight hour I sat alone Within my chamber, sunk in reverie, No sound disturbed my musings, all was hushed In silence and in sleep, the light near done, A dim uncertain flickering threw around. The waning fire was but a heap of ashes, While there and there a feeble red remained, That now and then threw out a fitful gleam. Something like slumber fell upon my eyes, And a dream passed o'er my spirit stealthily, As, in the early grey of morn, the mists, Gathered in masses, up the hill-sides creep, Ere they dissolve before the sun away. Remembrance cannot all its features tell, Though vivid and particular they seemed When that dread vision on my senses came, And I could trace the shadowy details, As one might mark a phantom army march O'er its last field of battle, ere it passed, Into obscurity,--could note it then,-- But afterwards cannot recall the place, Order and rank, of each brigade and file. "
908,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,"Methought I stood upon a bare hill-top, And overlooked a vast and fertile plain Peopled with many multitudes,--there met Men of all tribes and nations that the globe Holds in its wide extent, of every kind, The Mongol, the Malayan, and the Negro, The red American and Caucasian fair. Among them Evil strode ubiquitous, And threw its shadow wheresoe'er it came. Its Jackal, lewd Temptation, went before, With angel face and soft alluring eyes, While close behind Guilt, Anguish, Care, and Pain Followed incessantly, and left on all Their mark impressed as with hot iron seared. As then I looked upon the scene below, Meseemed that wheresoe'er Temptation came, And she came everywhere,--no spot escaped,-- That many, most indeed of these vast crowds, Themselves threw madly in her way, and sought To win her smiles, nor deemed them poisonous; And once within her meshes, few had will To fly them, or to manfully resist, As a strong man confronts his enemy, And strives to overthrow him where they meet;-- And she the while assumed all shapes and moods That suited were to their intents and aims, For, with a penetrating eye precise, Intuitively still their minds she knew, Tendencies and dispositions, and wore,-- As snares in readiness she had for all,-- The very guise adapted for their lure, But carefully concealed the stings they bore. "
909,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,"Disease and sorrow on her victims fell, Too late they felt the curse that is entailed On all who to the Tempter yield, and thus Become an early prey to Evil, whose Inheritance is misery and woe. "
910,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,"And I beheld some 'mongst the various crowds Who stood aloof from her, and would not be Entangled with her witcheries or wiles. These with a resolute will refused to come Within her reach, and so escaped the first Of Evil's followers, Guilt, though more or less, They had their share of what the others left Behind,--Care, Pain, and Anguish,--for the doom Pronounced on Man was on them, but they knew That these, to all who hold out to the end, With a pure conscience and unspotted mind, To their endurance will be tempered still, And, in due season, turn to lasting good, Which to their spirits consolation brought. "
911,THE VALLEY OF LIFE.,"The valley watered was with goodly rivers, Upon the banks of which were many met. Prudence was one, and on its grassy sides Sat some who, calculating every chance, A deaf ear to Temptation, when she came, Turned, unseduced from their proprieties. Repentance was another, near it lay Those who Remorse felt and a wounded spirit, Seeking relief from agonising thought And racking self-reproach. Beyond these two Was Perseverance, where returning health Was found by all who there due time remained. And farther still, with borders ever green, And fresh flowers ever springing, ever new, Were two sweet rills, Virtue and Faith their names, Where peace of mind was known and purity: And those who sought their banks,--they were not few, Though, midst the mighty myriads around, They seemed but small in number and select,-- Remained unshaken in their constancy, Resisting all enticements of the Tempter, And gladly following the path of duty, Which brought to them a sure and high reward. On these, whate'er their griefs and trials were, And they had many, to refine their souls, And make them nobler after victory, Enduring hope and perfect peace abode. But whereso'er I looked besides, was seen The power of Ill, shedding on all who bore The fated impress of humanity, Torment and fear, and bitter agony, And pain intolerable,--At the sight My spirit shrank, and, starting, I awoke!

937,BYRON.,BYRON. 
938,BYRON.,"According to the Guide Books, Loch Awe and its vicinity, more perhaps than any other district in the Highlands, abound with memorials of former ages. The lake is thirty miles in extent, and of the average breadth of one, although in some places it does not exceed half a mile. It is surrounded by mountains finely wooded, and like many of the Scottish lakes, its surface is studded over with small islands, beautifully tufted with trees, and some of them large enough to admit of being pastured. Upon the island of Innis-Hail are the remains of a convent; and on a rocky promontory at the eastern extremity of the lake stand the magnificent ruins of Kilchurn Castle. This structure, which still exhibits the vestiges of a castellated square tower, was built in 1440, by Sir John Campbell, (second son of Argyle,) Knight of Rhodes, and ancestor of the Breadalbane family, and in later times it became, from the extensive view it commanded of the lake, the favourite residence of the chiefs of the family. In 1745 it was garrisoned by the king's troops, in order to defend the pass into the Highlands, and secure the tranquillity of the country. Emerging from the ocean, and rising on the north-east bank of Loch Awe, soars Ben Cruachan, the largest mountain in Argyleshire. Its perpendicular height is 3,390 feet above the level of the sea, and its circumference at the base is upwards of twenty miles. On the south, the ascent is gentle nearly to the summit, where it rises abrupt, and divides into two points, each having the form of a sugar-loaf. Before the storm, ""the spirit of the mountain shrieks"" from Ben Cruachan, Ben Doran, and some other Highland mountains. When Burke made his tour in Scotland, he declared that Loch Awe was the most picturesque lake he had ever seen. It was in a narrow pass in the vicinity of this lake that King Robert Bruce defeated the Macdougals of Lorn, in 1308. In Loch Awe are found salmon, trout, eels, and other fresh water fish. The lake discharges itself by the river Awe into Loch Etive at Bunawe Ferry. "

The Poem is founded on an incident which occurred some years ago in Picardy--the details of which were similar, with the exception that the peasant shot his mother instead of his sweetheart, in mistake for the wolf of which he was in pursuit. The last of these ferocious animals seen in the neighbourhood of Guisne was shot by a woman named Louise Vernette, nearly fifty years ago. During a severe winter, when the whole country was covered with snow, a she-wolf, urged to desperation by hunger, had entered her cottage at an early hour of the morning, and carried off her infant, as it lay in the cradle. The mother, on returning from the labours of the field, with frantic lamentations searched the neighbourhood for her child. During her wanderings she encountered a peasant, breathless from a long and unavailing pursuit of the savage beast, which he had seen entering a wood about three leagues distant with the child in its jaws. The whole village immediately renewed the chase; the mother, arming herself with a gun, was, as might have been expected, the most indefatigable, and, penetrating into the recesses of the forest, encountered the monster, which she shot dead. No traces of the miserable infant were ever discovered. "

The mountain is of no great extent, but extremely high, and has two tops; the western of which is called Horeb, and the eastern, which is about a third higher, Sinai. There are several springs and fruit-trees on Horeb, but nothing except rainwater on the top of Sinai. The ascent of both is very steep, and can only be effected by steps, now much effaced, which the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, caused to be cut in the marble rock. At the foot of Mount Sinai, on the north, and near to the ascent of Mount Horeb, there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Catherine, but now in ruins, not far distant from which there stands a fountain of very clear water, formed like a bow or arch. A little above which is to be seen the Cave where Elijah rested when God spoke unto him, 1 Kings xix. From the top of Sinai, God proclaimed his law to the Hebrews amid devouring flames of fire, Exod. xxiv. The Rock Rephidim, which seems to have been a clift fallen off from the side of Sinai, and lies like a large loose stone in the midst of the valley, gives name to that part of the desert nearest the mountain. There are twelve openings in it, whence, on being struck by Moses, the waters gushed out for the supply of the Israelites, during the forty years they tarried in the desert, Exod. xvii. "

947,"NOTE 6, PAGE 116.","The ruins of Dryburgh Abbey are surpassingly interesting, from their antiquity, history, picturesque appearance, and more than all, from the GREAT MINSTREL being buried there. The grave of Sir Walter Scott is in St. Mary's Aisle of the Abbey Church of Dryburgh, which is in the form of a cross, and the Poet lies in the left transept of the Cross, part of which is still standing, and close to where the high altar formerly stood. This transept is divided into three burial-places; that of Sir Walter Scott, Baronet, in right of his grandmother, Lady Haliburton's family; that of James Erskine, Esq. of Shieldhall and Melrose; and that of James G. Haig, Esq. of the ancient family of Bemersyde. These, with the tomb-house of the Earl of Buchan, in St. Moden's Chapel, and that of James Anderson, Esq. of Gledswood, form, I believe, the only cemeteries in Dryburgh. These venerable ruins stand on a romantic peninsula, formed by one of the great windings of the Tweed, commonly called the crescent of that river, in the south-west nook of Berwickshire, where the river divides that county from Roxburghshire. The land rises in a sloping bank from the margin of the Tweed to the top of Dryburgh Hill, about 800 feet high, on which stands the colossal statue of _Wallace_, erected by the late revered Earl of Buchan. The trees in the neighbourhood of Dryburgh have a very luxuriant appearance, and some of them are rather remarkable. There are many vestiges of old oaks to be found, and the ash and the yew have grown to a surprising height and circumference; and there is still, in the cemetery of the Abbey, a yew-tree of uncommon beauty, which is upwards of ten feet in circumference, at six feet from the ground. In the grounds opposite the mansion house of Dryburgh, there are also some fine trees, particularly a noble cedar, which has been much admired. Many interesting remains of antiquity have been dug up in Dryburgh Abbey and places adjacent. "

The daughter of the farmer in whose field the tree stood, and with whom I became acquainted, married, and settled in this place about forty years ago. In our occasional interviews, we now and then spoke of the innocent pursuits and rural pleasures of our youth, and, among other things, of the eagle's nest in her father's field. A few years ago I was called to visit this woman, when she was in the lowest stage of a typhus fever. Upon entering her room, I caught her eye, and, with a cheerful tone of voice, said only--'The eagle's nest!' She seized my hand, without being able to speak, and discovered strong emotions of pleasure in her countenance, probably from a sudden association of all her early domestic connexions and enjoyments with the words I had uttered.
