1740,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"But I saw they were not as was thought,"
1741,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,"
1742,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,"
1743,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,"

1752,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,"
1753,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,"
1754,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"flooding the night,"
1755,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again"

1769,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,"
1770,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,"
1771,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D,"With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,"
