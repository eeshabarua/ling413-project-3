121,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST
122,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
123,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
124,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Gold light across the golden coomb;
125,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sun went west with horns of fire;
126,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Athwart the sweet, sea-breathing room"
127,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The swallows swooped; the village spire
128,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Glowed red against a gleam of broom;
129,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"While earth its scented secrets told,"
130,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"There, silent, sunset-aureoled,"
131,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sat Ioläus, mild and old."
132,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
133,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In distance large the moving ships
134,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sailed on into the evening skies.
135,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"He gazed, and saw not. In eclipse"
136,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"He tensely sat, like one who grips"
137,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Some semblance that his dream descries,"
138,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With such a look of far surprise
139,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That half-uncanny seemed the man,"
140,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"So warped with age, so weirdly wan:"
141,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,He had such ghostly eyes.
142,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
143,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Then half to self, and half to me,"
144,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Aloof in passion and lone despair,"
145,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,He spoke like one whose secrets flee
146,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,From silence unaware:
147,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Now plaintively from a grief gone blind,"
148,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Heavy with cumbering care,"
149,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Now, thrilling thought like a white sea-wind,"
150,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"His words, the echoes of his mind,"
151,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Haunted the air:
152,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
153,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,... 'Tis gone like the roses of long ago:
154,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Yet a dawn's impassioned thrill
155,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Makes blush the blossom's virgin snow
156,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Far on in a faery hill.
157,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Two faces there in the glamour glow
158,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In a place that is strangely still.
159,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
160,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On the rim of the world is a ruined tower
161,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sky-poised above wide sea-foam,"
162,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where a beautiful spirit waits hour by hour,"
163,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Far-eyed 'gainst a dawn like a phantom flower,"
164,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Till a ghostly lover comes home....
165,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
166,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To leeward spread the freshening deep
167,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Purple beneath a rosy gleam.
168,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"From a high, mist-engirdled steep"
169,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Thin anthems to the orient beam
170,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Came faint as languid waves of sleep
171,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That lap the lonely strands of dream.
172,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
173,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We sank our anchor solemnly
174,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Into that lustrous, splendid sea;"
175,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"For we, that chased the summer's smile"
176,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Across the world a wondering while,"
177,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Hailed at the heart the Happy Isle,"
178,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The haunted shores of Faëry!
179,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
180,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beyond a gently-heaving brine
181,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We broke with oars a trembling bay.
182,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The swerving water, like rare wine,"
183,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Slid iridescent from our way.
184,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A lovely hand was laid on mine
185,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Pensively as to say:
186,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""Life is divine!"""
187,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
188,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The drifting, witching wonder grew."
189,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,From out the burgeoning bounds of space
190,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,It seemed some morn unearthly drew
191,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To that grave glamourous place,"
192,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where, fearful of some far adieu,"
193,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I talked with one who never knew
194,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The peril of her face.
195,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
196,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The joy that lives is mightier far
197,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Than foretaste of all grief unborn.
198,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The earth to youth is a silver star
199,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That glitters on the edge of morn,"
200,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A star! a star! a dancing star.
201,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
202,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The fair, the mystic, happy morn!"
203,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Dawn glimmered on the gladdening sea;
204,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Each zephyr blew an elfin horn
205,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To echoes in felicity.
206,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,All sounds to silver rhythm ran:
207,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Came flutings as from piping Pan
208,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In purpled hills of Arcady!
209,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
210,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Seaward we heard the breakers roar;
211,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And the belated nightingales
212,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sang all their moonlight raptures o'er,"
213,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Enchanted still in echoing vales.
214,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We lingered by the brightening shore;
215,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We leapt upon the roseate strand:
216,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The joy that in our hearts we bore
217,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We loved, nor longed to understand."
218,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Soft siren voices evermore
219,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Chanted to chimes in Faeryland.
220,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
221,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"O, life was like a bird that sings"
222,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,At morning on a vernal bough!
223,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The springtide at the heart of things
224,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sang as the spring knows how.
225,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And fair was she, and both were young;"
226,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We knew not what made time so good;
227,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Nature with glamour-tutored tongue
228,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Spread glory in the blood.
229,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
230,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We climbed the dim and dreaming streets:
231,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We reached a plateau crowned with pine:
232,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The leaning roses breathed their sweets
233,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,'Mid many a subtle-scented vine.
234,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We wreathed our brows with ivy-twine.
235,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
236,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"In mouldering majesty sublime,"
237,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Misty with eld, the mute of time,"
238,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A castle, dawn-enchanted, there"
239,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Above th' abyss sheer, shimmering fair,"
240,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Hung like a perilous dream in air.
241,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Poised on a dizzy turret high,"
242,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Enfolded with the gorgeous sky,"
243,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We listened, she and I,"
244,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"In wonder, 'mazed. Without a word"
245,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A soul had spoken, soul had heard."
246,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"All suddenly came, charged with tears,"
247,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sweetness of the human years.
248,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
249,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We saw deep forests far away
250,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Kindle to meet the kiss of day;
251,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And mists with morn's delight uprise
252,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Like love thoughts in a maiden's eyes.
253,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We shared the dream that never dies.
254,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
255,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Our hearts were hushed with vague desire;
256,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We breathed in kingdoms wildly new,"
257,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Enthralled by Memnon's mystic lyre
258,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In regions whence the Ph[oe]nix flew;
259,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Dumb splendour round us blown, and higher"
260,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"On heaven's deep dome--the peacock's hue,"
261,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Bright flakes of crimsoning fire!
262,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
263,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Dew-fresh was all the wavering air.
264,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We heard the reef's far rollers croon
265,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"About the ocean's margent, where"
266,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Loitered the waning moon ...
267,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,So fond the hour; the scene so fair;
268,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And fate came home so soon ...
269,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Some sorrow wept,--I knew not where."
270,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Some sudden presence made the air
271,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Chill as the breathless moon.
272,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
273,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Silent, upon a lonelier steep,"
274,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I gazed across a deeper deep,"
275,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Where the pale mists pass from the isles of sleep.--
276,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
277,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Lost voices called in other years:
278,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Old sweetness like a breaking grief
279,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Rose in the heart and stung to tears:
280,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In that clear moment brief
281,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Life's dearest, dead so long before,"
282,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Returned to bless and die once more.
283,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
284,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The faintly crooning sabbath bells
285,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,At evening in the golden fells
286,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I heard; the tinkle of the rills
287,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In haunts where childish fancy fed;
288,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw the orchard daffodils
289,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,About the calm homestead;
290,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Ah, saddest thought that ever fills"
291,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"An errant heart that memory thrills,"
292,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The heath-smell of his homeland hills
293,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To one whose loves are dead ...
294,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
295,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,What yearnings burn the human breast;
296,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,What wild desires like prisoned birds
297,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Impel the heart from east to west;
298,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,What urgings baffling words
299,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beat up from nature unexpressed
300,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Till soul distinct stands manifest,"
301,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"On guard for heaven, or, wanton, hurled"
302,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Toward judgment through the world.
303,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
304,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Long following beauty's floating flame
305,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beneath the sky from sea to sea
306,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"No isle of rest, no haven could claim"
307,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The lonely, homeless heart in me."
308,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sick loneliness no more should be
309,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Companion to my soul, for She"
310,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To fill the questing vision came,"
311,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Came down the breadths of blossoming foam
312,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To give to loveliness a name,"
313,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To happiness a home!
314,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
315,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Yet thought toward passion moved with dread,"
316,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Like one who, hurrying to be wed,"
317,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Steps, darkling, on the dead."
318,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
319,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Far down we saw mute wavelets leap
320,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Feebly as though remembering sleep;
321,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The wheeling sea-birds proudly sway
322,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In glory o'er the opal bay;--
323,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But at the heart the world grew grey;
324,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Some joy had perished from the day;
325,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Some love was grieving far away.
326,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
327,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,No voice stirred through the haunted hill
328,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Touched with the morn's inviolate gleam.
329,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,All fearfully wild heart and will
330,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Drank rapture in the face of ill!
331,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Our spirits thrilled to answer thrill,"
332,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And trembled in their dream.
333,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
334,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Truth comes, and tears, and glamour goes."
335,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,There's speech within the blood
336,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"More eloquent than language knows,"
337,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And woes make signal unto woes
338,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,While pity breathes and passion blows:
339,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We looked:----we understood.
340,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On summer's heart fell winter's snows ...
341,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The death that dissipates the rose
342,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Was busy in the bud ...
343,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
344,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The spectre beckoned: none could save ...
345,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sundering grave ... The sundering grave! ...
346,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Our lonely love in time could be
347,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But whisper of a broken wave
348,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Lost in a boundless sea ...
349,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"She spoke, so fair, so pale, so brave,----"
350,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Across infinity!
351,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
352,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah meekness mute with tragedy!...
353,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My body stirred as in a grave,"
354,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And looked forth wonderingly ...
355,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The everlasting sea serene
356,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,'Neath everlasting sky
357,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Shone, and across the morning sheen"
358,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The deathless winds went by.
359,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And a face was there that I never had seen;
360,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And a shadow stood where a glory had been;
361,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The beauty hung at my heart like pain;
362,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And love was lovely, but life was bane,"
363,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"For all should die,--but the wonder remain,"
364,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And the earth, and the sea, and the sky ..."
365,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
366,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The hills have winds, the fields have flowers;"
367,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Not all alone is the wintry tree;
368,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The stars that gleam in cloudy bowers
369,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Have stars for company;
370,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The waste hath peace of the drifting hours;
371,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And night brings joy to the hoary sea:
372,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
373,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But the heart of man is a lonely thing;
374,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And lone the soul of the secret vows,"
375,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With its wasted love and its wounded wing,"
376,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"In a withered world that hath no spring,"
377,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,No burgeoning boughs:
378,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The soul of man is the loneliest thing
379,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In life's eternal wandering
380,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That God allows ...
381,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
382,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"O, isle of dreams, and orient shore!"
383,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah miracle in sea and sky!
384,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah youth that fleeting love made soar
385,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To heaven! The glory upon high
386,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To dusk hath waned, yet comes once more"
387,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A wonder and a cry!...
388,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
389,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The ship's bell tolled off that fair land;
390,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sails bulged buoyantly:
391,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The sun rose mute, and large, and bland;"
392,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The favouring wind swung free.
393,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We stood from that enchanted strand
394,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Into the morning sea.
395,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
396,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We rode down swinging winds away,"
397,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Far o'er the moving waters wan,"
398,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Seen low at pale meridan,"
399,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The land was grey.
400,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
401,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The dusk came down; and like a ghost
402,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Rose the sad moon; the waves 'gan moan:
403,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"There on the deep no kindly coast,--"
404,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The dark alone.
405,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
406,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And in two faces stared, and stared"
407,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The being without blood or breath,"
408,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The stilly spectre, horror-haired,"
409,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That haunteth all he murdereth;
410,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"At noon, at midnight stared, and stared"
411,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"When sunrise flashed, when sunset flared,"
412,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The grizzly phantom horror-haired:--
413,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
414,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Stalking frail beauty to her grave
415,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw him moving evermore
416,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A stealthy wanderer on the wave,"
417,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A shrouded shadow on the shore,"
418,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The worm his bondsman, and the brave"
419,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,His victims evermore ...
420,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
421,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The Power that drives all mortal things,"
422,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Upbuoys all being's wanderings,"
423,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Moved in the void his urgent wings ...
424,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
425,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On down the weltering world we sped;
426,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Across the lonely, drifting noon;"
427,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Along the wreathëd tides we fled
428,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beneath the memoried moon.
429,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sad love pursued where sorrow led;
430,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And beauty, waiting to be dead,"
431,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Kissed under the dead moon.
432,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
433,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Love, speechless, yearned in hopeless eyes;"
434,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And hearts that hungered craved in vain.
435,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Dumb pity heard sad pity's sighs;
436,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And grief soothed grief again.
437,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Fond smile to smile sent faint replies,"
438,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And faded back to pain.
439,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
440,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Entangled in the toils of fate,"
441,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Two stood at Eden's open gate--
442,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Banned, in a world found desolate ..."
443,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And love made league with hate ...
444,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,All time's long woe since man's wet eyes
445,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Peered toward a promised paradise
446,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Pressed home,--the weight of smothered cries,"
447,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Dead dreams, and hopeless pain"
448,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of souls in silence slain.
449,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
450,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We saw the loathsome waste of death;
451,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sad soul at war with sense;
452,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And suffering doomed to lingering breath;
453,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And slandered innocence;
454,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And beauty ravished at the bloom;
455,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Saw strength flung prostrate; fall
456,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The brave, life-worsted from the womb;"
457,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,White truth made criminal:
458,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Impotent, passionate, counting all,"
459,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We kissed----across a tomb ...
460,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
461,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The lustrous clouds trailed proudly by:
462,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And through a rift of dazzling sky
463,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I cursed God with a dreary cry ...
464,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
465,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The silence of the starry night;
466,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The silver of the moonlit sea;
467,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And loud in secret, stern, and trite,"
468,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The pulse of destiny.
469,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah sadness scourged with doomed delight!
470,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah wondrous misery!
471,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
472,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Pale topsails in the offing shone,"
473,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And faded into foam:
474,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And down the noontide, one by one,"
475,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The pale, proud ships would roam;"
476,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Each sailor to his love went on;
477,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Each wanderer to his home.
478,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
479,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, ceasing not, death's nearing knell"
480,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Tolled in a heart that dreamed no more.
481,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Our lips shook, sad as lips in hell;"
482,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"But, fearful of the rending shore,"
483,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To fill all time with sad farewell
484,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We would have sailed for evermore!
485,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
486,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"For pleasantly a song she'd croon,"
487,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And feign the world a kindly place;
488,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And tender was the haunting tune
489,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To match her haunting grace;
490,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And tenderly the witching moon
491,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Toyed with her feeling face ...
492,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
493,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Our love was like the scent of flowers
494,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To her who watches by the bed
495,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Of one that dies in the dark hours,"
496,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The one her youth had wed:
497,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"At dawn she scares her tears away,"
498,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And through the cloud-enamelled day
499,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Jests bravely for their bread.
500,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
501,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,She shared with all the brighter part;
502,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The witching sallies lightly flew;
503,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Her thoughts seemed, spilt by subtle art,"
504,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Half tear-drops and half dew.
505,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"They loved her for her gracious heart,"
506,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And the glad winds blew.
507,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
508,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sunbeam of her fleeting life
509,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Gladdened the unsuspecting days;
510,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And all the dusky imps of strife
511,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Paled in her wisdom's lambent rays.
512,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Her laugh to _one_ was as a knife:
513,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But she had pleasure's praise.
514,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
515,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And I who loved that conquering smile,"
516,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And felt the tears in secret shed,"
517,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Who watched her life with kindly guile
518,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Veiling its darlings dead,"
519,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Held in a choking hush the while
520,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A heart that feigned--and bled ...
521,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
522,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Onward with blind rebellious breast
523,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I ranged, with love, with bale opprest,"
524,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Piteous, passionate, all unblest,"
525,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The dispossessëd,--God-possest ..."
526,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
527,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,More lonely grew the leaden wave
528,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That broke against the leaning sky;
529,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The melancholy winds 'gan rave
530,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Among the whimpering shrouds on high:
531,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Most lonely up the leaden wave
532,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Two climbed toward yet a lonelier grave--
533,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Where only one should lie.
534,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
535,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We neared a grey and grievous land
536,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That thundered by a wintry sea;
537,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I touched the sorrow of her hand,"
538,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But nothing sad said she:
539,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,She turned from love at death's command
540,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To death eternally.
541,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
542,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,We passed the numbly moaning bar;
543,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We heard the harbour bell,"
544,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Its dull fog-muffled clang from far
545,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Came like a lorn death-knell.
546,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The quay-lights pushed a livid flare
547,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Through shrouding mist; and all things there
548,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Moved like grim shades in hell.
549,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
550,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The hammer's clamp on resonant steel;
551,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The siren's shriek; the scream and whirr
552,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Reverberant from forge and wheel;
553,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The fury and the clangorous stir
554,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And plunge of traffic; Vulcan's heel
555,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Crashing on iron,--and the reel"
556,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of sense at loss of _her_.--
557,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
558,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"None guessed when, playfully, she said,"
559,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With smile that brightened toward her dead,"
560,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""To-day across the world I ride"
561,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To meet a bridegroom, I the bride."""
562,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,They thought her mischief lied.
563,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
564,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Around us was the deafening roar,"
565,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A void, a wild and drear eclipse."
566,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A sadder sweetness than before
567,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Shook her pale, smiling lips;"
568,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"She waved adieu through vapours hoar,"
569,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And vanished in the shadows frore
570,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Among the heedless ships ...
571,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In that dread lapse of all farewell
572,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The spirit, listening, plain could tell"
573,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That devils laughed in drifting hell
574,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With guile upon their lips ...
575,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
576,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The world seemed all a hollow ghost
577,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That would dissolve away;
578,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And life itself a random boast
579,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of elements at play;
580,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And time a swift elusive gleam,"
581,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And man the mockery of a dream,"
582,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A foam-bell to a moment's beam
583,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Flung from the spray.
584,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
585,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I had worshipped her with sacred sighs,"
586,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Loved with the love that wondereth;
587,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My life had found her maiden-wise,"
588,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And sweeter than the rose's breath;
589,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Lit by a soul in paradise
590,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The lights within her holy eyes,"
591,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The lady loved of death ...
592,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
593,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Bereft, forlorn, by passion driven,"
594,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And blanched with loss, by suffering riven,"
595,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With impious heart I fled from Heaven ...
596,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
597,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Thought like a frost gripped all the brain:
598,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With frozen tears opprest,"
599,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The conscious blood with sullen pain
600,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Lunged at the callous breast,"
601,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where hope and love, a pallid twain,"
602,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Sat with a ghoul for guest.
603,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
604,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Over the watery wastes I fled
605,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Where'er dim desolation led
606,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beneath sad sun and moon!
607,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"For faith was dead, and joy was dead,"
608,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And love was where the phantoms tread,"
609,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And bitterness was passion's bread:
610,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""Grant, jester Death,"" I, laughing, said,"
611,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""Thy haggard fool a boon!"" ..."
612,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
613,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And unforgiving, unforgiven,"
614,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A derelict, by tempest driven,"
615,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I drave beneath the breadth of heaven ...
616,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
617,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Grim sorrow fell on all things fair;
618,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To dust was turned the lover's breath.
619,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Ah longing, like a pariah bare,"
620,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And passion, led by lewd despair"
621,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To kiss the smelling jowl of death!
622,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
623,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"As in a sunless cavern cold,"
624,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Like one who flies a crime,"
625,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Fearful, and old as God is old,"
626,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The spirit shrank from time;
627,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,For a stifled scream was the angry gold
628,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Of the weird sunset, and the noonday bold"
629,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Was the stare on the face of a crime.
630,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
631,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw as brain-blurred drunkards see;
632,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I felt, yet could not feel;"
633,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I seemed in moving time to be
634,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In nerveless immobility
635,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,As dust upon a wheel.
636,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
637,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Some world material moved around,"
638,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Mazed breadths of spume and brine;
639,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Strange voices spake as from a bound
640,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Far off, I answered with a sound,"
641,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Nor knew the answer mine;
642,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And sometimes like a weary hound
643,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I heard the darkness whine.
644,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
645,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In throbbing night 'twixt sleep and sleep
646,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,My tortured spirit heard
647,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A wail that wandered down the deep,"
648,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A sorrow on the windy deep
649,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Wail like a wounded bird;
650,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And I wept as a haunted man doth weep
651,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Who dare not speak a word.
652,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
653,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sometimes I sensed heaven's bellied gloom,"
654,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Storm like dumb and pregnant doom
655,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Scowl on the waters wild;
656,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Or tempest 'neath a plunging sky
657,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Down crashing waves with haunting cry
658,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Scream like a tortured child;
659,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
660,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A blind thing staggering in the night
661,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Strained, groaning, 'gainst a pervious power"
662,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That flashed and eddied, wild and white,"
663,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That wheeled and wailed from hour to hour;
664,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, somewhere, strangely burned to sight"
665,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Dawn like a doom a-flower ...
666,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
667,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"On ever onward, darkly driven,"
668,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A soul, unsheltered, and unshriven,"
669,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With lodestar gone, with raiment riven,"
670,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Drove in the gale of the wrath of Heaven ...
671,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
672,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The monsoon blew; the changing stars
673,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Rode by in deeper skies.
674,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,At times between the raking spars
675,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I felt the blank moon rise;
676,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Or heard the chanties of the tars
677,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With a sad, sick surprise."
678,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
679,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And once a heaven, the sapphire's hue,"
680,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Flashed o'er the freshening wave;
681,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,They hurt the heart as laughers do
682,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,When love stands by a grave.
683,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
684,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And now a level ocean grey
685,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Would lie along a level day,"
686,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Unwhipt of wing or wind;
687,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Or sunset make a carmine stain
688,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That sucked like sadness at the brain,"
689,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And sank into the mind,"
690,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And touched me with some wandering pain,"
691,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Some sentience of mankind again.
692,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
693,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,... And where was _she_?... Could sorrow fail
694,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In aching time ... Ah voice in vain
695,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That called for ever ... fading sail
696,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On seas forlorn; sad wind and rain
697,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Whispering ... all-wandering pain ...
698,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And in the heart the wail--
699,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Never again on earth--never again.
700,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
701,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,So dimly to a beauteous ghost
702,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My being bowed a subject knee,"
703,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And lived, with love's sad sunset lost,"
704,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Alone 'mid all the sea.
705,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A leper to a lonely coast,"
706,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I fled from all I cherished most;
707,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And wildly, with a bleeding boast,"
708,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I clasped my agony ...
709,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
710,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sad nature strained the leash in vain,"
711,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And flying, fled not; ever the chain"
712,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of the Fear that followed; ever again
713,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Relentless pity; guardian pain ...
714,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
715,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Like torturing dreams the days went by,"
716,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With all save self denied;
717,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And Godward went man's desolate cry,"
718,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That Christ Himself had cried:
719,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Alone each soul upon its tree
720,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Cried to its kin,--but over me"
721,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The darkness that crushed Calvary
722,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,When God was crucified.
723,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
724,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The present lost, I found, aghast,"
725,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A dying heart, a deathless past;"
726,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, ever nigh, and mocking me,"
727,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A madness, or a mystery ..."
728,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And hour by hour, in peril, passed"
729,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A soul toward judgment through the vast ...
730,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
731,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Life, a vague tumult in the blood,"
732,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beat on 'gainst flesh and bone;
733,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And in its echoing solitude
734,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The heart tapped like a stone;
735,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Till like some child at dark I stood
736,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That stands fear-frozen in a wood,--"
737,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Alone--yet not _alone_.--
738,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
739,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,For mine was ghostly company:
740,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Chilled, in the eerie air"
741,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I felt _myself_ bend over me,"
742,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And point as with despair;
743,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, horror-thrilled, I turned to see"
744,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My body selfless there,"
745,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
746,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And separate,--a house of clay"
747,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That mourned its tenant gone;
748,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Its vacant eyes would fain delay,"
749,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Its piteous hands implored to stay
750,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The soul that in it shone.
751,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where one had been, in mute dismay"
752,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Two, merged in mystery, went away--"
753,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I and that other One ...
754,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
755,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With vision blurred, and bearings lost,"
756,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Streamed on amid a phantom host
757,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The man that was a ghost ...
758,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
759,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Apart from human years I stood
760,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A naked, probing mind."
761,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Aloof I heard the beating blood,"
762,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The far-brought voices of the blood,"
763,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Flow round me like a wind;
764,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In an abysmal solitude
765,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I staggered like one blind.--
766,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
767,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"In wastes uncharted, far from bliss,"
768,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I heard a writhing chaos hiss;
769,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And thought, that moved in time no more,"
770,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Wept on some wild, pre-natal shore.--"
771,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
772,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Appalled, the boundless vision burst"
773,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Through yawning gulfs of gloom;
774,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To human hunger, human thirst"
775,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Infinite hell did loom;
776,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Infinite bale to vision burst
777,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In tracts of nebulous bloom;
778,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And life through peril, lorn, accurst,"
779,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Passed on from doom to doom.
780,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
781,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The depths were full of throes unknown,"
782,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Weird wastes of vomited fire;
783,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Wild mists of thunderous flame were blown
784,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Athwart eclipse; I heard the groan
785,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of travailing worlds stupendous thrown
786,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Through chaos to expire:
787,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My spirit, cowed with vastness dire,"
788,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Gazed, poised in space,--alone,--"
789,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Alone as a haunted life that lies
790,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"On the death-brink when a dread past cries,"
791,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And the live dark burns with eternal eyes.
792,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
793,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Rang, terror-wrung from shrivelled pride:"
794,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""Oh loneliest of the dead,"
795,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Thou with the deeply riven side,"
796,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And with the branded head,"
797,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Lo, I, in blasphemy that died,"
798,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Do envy all the dead,"
799,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
800,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"""And, fleeing self-hood, fain would die--"
801,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But this can never be!
802,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,This mortal nevermore can lie
803,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To immortality.--
804,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Oh! hearken to my ghostly cry,"
805,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Lone ghost of Calvary!""--"
806,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I was my own infinity;
807,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The cry, the echo I ..."
808,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
809,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Oh brother, with the bone-sealed breast;"
810,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Brother in hope, in shame,"
811,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"In joy, in sorrow, east and west"
812,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"We know, but man, earth's awful guest,"
813,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Is vastness with a name,--"
814,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Is spirit, hungry in the quest"
815,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of spirit whence he came ...
816,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
817,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"On through the void I shuddering fled,"
818,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Immortal, seeking to be dead,"
819,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With God behind me, God ahead,"
820,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Pursued, encompassed, lost,--and led ..."
821,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
822,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,God's outcasts only have their ease:
823,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,But I was not as these.
824,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,From deep to deep my soul was blown
825,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Like sin toward judgment, ever alone"
826,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With the Eye unseen, and the Hand unknown."
827,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
828,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sad nature strained the leash in vain,"
829,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, flying, fled not; ever the chain"
830,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Of the Fear that followed; ever again
831,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Relentless pity, guardian pain ..."
832,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
833,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Slow time a sad nepenthe brought,"
834,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Numb poignance with no sigh,"
835,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"When body, dim with sorrow, sought"
836,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Day with a dead man's eye.--
837,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
838,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,As from far off I darkly saw:
839,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I lay as doomed men lie:
840,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"A lamb beneath a lion's paw,"
841,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Mute-meek, that lamb was I;"
842,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"My soul I felt the monster gnaw,"
843,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I heard my body die.
844,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
845,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, dumbly, 'thwart a dreader deep"
846,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I drifted, as on awful sleep,"
847,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where sorrows burn, and never weep ..."
848,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
849,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Delirium reigned. Fell darkness dire,"
850,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Vague terror, shapeless dole."
851,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Forever climbing ghâts of fire
852,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I struggled to a goal
853,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where, lone upon the suttee pyre,"
854,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw my life's long-lost desire--
855,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The widow of my soul!
856,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
857,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Far and far through smoke-red light
858,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw her beckoning stand;
859,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Anon, like a burning bird in fright,"
860,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"She fled with a shriek through the lurid night,"
861,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And I wailed like a lost soul banned;
862,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And an echo flew like an anguished sprite
863,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And wailed in a hollow land.
864,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
865,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Then utter loss: and there was nought.
866,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,My sentience wholly sped:
867,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"No sound, no feeling, sight, or thought:"
868,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Yet I knew with a vacuous dread
869,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I lay a thing by God unsought,--"
870,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Dead, dead,--for ever dead ..."
871,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
872,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Slow ages seemed to have their will:
873,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, moving toward the prime,"
874,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Th' Eternal Immanency still
875,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Breathed in the senseless lime,"
876,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Till a dead thing felt the procreant thrill,"
877,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And shuddered back to time.
878,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
879,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,It might have been ten thousand years
880,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That over me had run;
881,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,It might have been ten thousand years
882,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I had not sensed the sun.--
883,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Oh God, how much of sin that sears,"
884,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"How many, many bitter years"
885,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Till soul from dust be won?
886,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Oh Lord of Light, make sweet their tears"
887,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Who never see the sun!-- ...
888,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
889,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Mean as the dust, through the volant vast"
890,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Flung like chaff, as ashes cast"
891,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"To the nether storms, I sank, pride past,"
892,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On the waiting wings of the First and Last ...
893,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
894,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Slowly, slowly came the grey"
895,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Where all was dark before.
896,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Some monster left its mangled prey
897,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Because the night was o'er:
898,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, sick beside an Indian shore,"
899,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I knew that it was day--
900,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
901,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And strangely cared. Some cloudy pain
902,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Seemed from my being rolled.
903,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Afar upon a misty plain
904,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The grey was turning gold.
905,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"I slept, and dreamt of rustling rain"
906,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On leaves in summers old.
907,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
908,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And faintly in my dream the corn
909,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Shook under English skies;
910,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To wreathe with silvery song the morn
911,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw the laverock rise;
912,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And I saw the Dead by a snow-white thorn,"
913,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Touched with the blush of a mounting morn,"
914,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Singing in paradise;
915,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And a seraph blew on a golden horn;
916,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And I saw with a mild surmise
917,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
918,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,White shapes pass panoplied from war
919,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In fields to sense unknown;
920,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And over them a targe-like star
921,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Blazed in its heaven alone;
922,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And a chant of joy was blown afar;
923,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And a soul-name rang 'neath that blinding star,"
924,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Which deep in a world crepuscular
925,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,My spirit knew for its own.
926,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Then I turned, for the star-gleam dazzled my eyes,"
927,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And woke with a glad surprise!--
928,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
929,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Woke with the earth-breath on my face.
930,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The sunbeams filtered through
931,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A tamarind in a stilly place;
932,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I saw the brazen blue:
933,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And suddenly Christ's healing grace
934,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Fell round like holy dew.
935,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
936,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And kindly faces passed and smiled;
937,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And gentle voices spoke;
938,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And, wondering like a waking child,"
939,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The night within me broke,"
940,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And from a heart grown reconciled
941,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Went heavenward like thin smoke.
942,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
943,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On all the bounds of ranging sight
944,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The lifting gloom was riven.
945,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The terrors of abysmal night
946,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Fled like hushed horrors fly from light
947,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,By dawn's winged horsemen driven.
948,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On the drifting hills of morn shone bright
949,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The gonfalons of heaven.
950,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
951,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Warm winds from palm-hung pleasances
952,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Came through the lattice bars
953,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With scents and murmurous harmonies;
954,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Like splintered scimitars
955,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The moonbeams through the banyan trees
956,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Gleamed under Indian stars.
957,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
958,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And far away, and far away"
959,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,My heart went out forlorn;
960,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,'Mid benizons from far away
961,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,I felt my soul reborn;
962,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And man from every palm-fringed bay
963,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And mountain town where sunsets stay,"
964,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,From sounding cities smoking grey
965,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Called, called me down the morn ..."
966,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
967,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,O magic of the morning sky!
968,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,O wonder of the moonlit sea!
969,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,O life--the vision and the cry
970,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Into eternity!--
971,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Eternity beneath, on high,"
972,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Veiled within cloud and clod,"
973,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That life in folly would vainly fly
974,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Through the nethermost deep, through the uttermost high,--"
975,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Life that is God-doomed never to die
976,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To the agony of God.
977,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
978,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Too long to self my life had given
979,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,What was for soul alone;
980,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To rob the sanctuaries had striven
981,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To build a lone love's throne.
982,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,In vain we prop each little heaven
983,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,While men's souls turn to stone.
984,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
985,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The good in ill let no man scorn;
986,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The ill in good let all men find.
987,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Our knowledge is the lesser morn;
988,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Large night with stars behind
989,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Shews most. Of spirit still is born
990,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"All life, all wonder; it shall bind"
991,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,All hearts in wisdom. Unforlorn
992,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"He lives in deserts, though he mourn,"
993,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Who loveth all the Kind ...
994,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
995,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With storm gone by, from jeopardy,"
996,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With loss for gain, and blindness past,"
997,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Home to divine reality
998,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"The tides have borne me,--home at last."
999,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Time like a silver flower doth blow
1000,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And blossom o'er a subtler sod,"
1001,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And through the meads of light I go
1002,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Beneath the golden boughs of God ...
1003,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
1004,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,My soul hath won to the city of love
1005,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,With the burnished walls of the dreams' desires;
1006,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And my life is glad as a glittering dove
1007,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That coos in the sun upon golden spires;
1008,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And I welcome the winds of the world, and move"
1009,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,To the music of unseen choirs.
1010,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
1011,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Great powers are for us; mighty wings
1012,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Toward man's proud peril speed.
1013,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Life nourished at eternal springs,"
1014,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Beats up through star and creed,"
1015,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Till soul, ascendant, fetter-freed,"
1016,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,A soaring seraph sings!...
1017,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
1018,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,On the rim of the world is a rosy tower
1019,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Sky-poised above wide sea-foam,"
1020,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Where a beautiful spirit waits hour by hour,"
1021,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Far-eyed 'gainst a dawn like a phantom flower,"
1022,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Till a ghostly lover comes home ...
1023,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
1024,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Ah! love is as lust till it count love lost;
1025,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,The soul is as sin till it weep sin's cost;
1026,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"O, happy is he, though he suffer most,"
1027,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Who wins to the Holy Ghost!
1028,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,
1029,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,So spake old Ioläus. There
1030,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"That drifting, chant-like monody,"
1031,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Its eerie passion, weird despair,"
1032,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Had wrought on me like wizardry;--
1033,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,Withál he moved through strange eclipse
1034,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With God's faint finger at his lips,"
1035,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"And with such tense and far surprise,"
1036,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,That half uncanny seemed the man
1037,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"With cloudy hair, in human guise,"
1038,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"So warped with age, so weirdly wan,"
1039,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,"Whose dry flesh into spirit ran,"
1040,THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST,And saw with ghostly eyes.
