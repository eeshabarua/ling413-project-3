72,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
73,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"UNDERNEATH protected branches, from the highway just aloof;"
74,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Stands the house of Grand'ther Baldwin, with its gently sloping roof."
75,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
76,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Square of shape and solid-timbered, it was standing, I have heard,"
77,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"In the days of Whig and Tory, under royal George the Third."
78,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
79,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Many a time, I well remember, I have gazed with Childish awe"
80,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"At the bullet-hole remaining in the sturdy oaken door,"
81,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
82,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Turning round half-apprehensive (recking not how time had fled)
83,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Of the lurking, savage foeman from whose musket it was sped.."
84,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
85,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Not far off, the barn, plethoric with the autumn's harvest spoils,"
86,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Holds the farmer's well-earned trophies--the guerdon of his toils;
87,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
88,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Filled the lofts with hay, sweet-scented, ravished from the meadows green,"
89,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"While beneath are stalled the cattle, with their quiet, drowsy mien."
90,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
91,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Deep and spacious are the grain-bins, brimming o'er with nature's gold;"
92,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barn-floor loosely rolled.
93,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
94,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Just below in deep recesses, safe from wintry frost chill,"
95,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard the hill.
96,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
97,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Many a year has Grand'ther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace,"
98,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"As his hair each year grew whiter, he has seen his herds increase."
99,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
100,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Sturdy sons and comely daughters, growing up from childish plays,"
101,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"One by one have met life's duties, and gone forth their several ways."
102,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
103,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
104,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Hushed the voice of childish laughter, hushed is childhood's merry tone,"
105,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,the fireside Grand'ther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone.
106,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
107,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Turning round half-apprehensive (recking not how time had fled)
108,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Of the lurking savage foeman from whose musket it was sped.
109,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
110,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Not far off, the barn, plethoric with the autumn harvest spoils,"
111,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Holds the farmer's well-earned trophies--the guerdon of his toils;
112,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
113,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Filled the lofts with hay, sweet-scented, ravished from the meadows green,"
114,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"While beneath are stalled the cattle, with their quiet drowsy mien."
115,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
116,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Deep and spacious are the grain-bins, brimming o'er with nature's gold;"
117,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barn-floor loosely rolled.
118,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
119,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Just below in deep recesses, safe from wintry frost and chill,"
120,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard on the hill.
121,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
122,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Many a year has Grand'ther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace,"
123,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"As his hair each year grew whiter, he has seen his herds increase."
124,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
125,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Sturdy sons and comely daughters, growing up from childish plays,"
126,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"One by one have met life's duties, and gone forth their several ways."
127,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
128,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Hushed the voice of childish laughter, hushed is childhood's merry tone,"
129,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,By the fireside Grand'ther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone.
130,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
131,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
132,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Yet once within the twelvemonth, when the days are short and drear,"
133,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"And chill winds chant the requiem of the slowly fading year,"
134,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
135,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"When the autumn work is over, and the harvest gathered in,"
136,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Once again the old house echoes to a long unwonted din.
137,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
138,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Logs of hickory blaze and crackle in the fireplace huge anti high,"
139,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,Curling wreaths of smoke mount upward to the gray November sky.
140,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
141,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Ruddy lads and smiling lasses, just let loose from schooldom's cares,"
142,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Patter, patter, race and clatter, up and down the great hall stairs."
143,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
144,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"All the boys shall hold high revel; all the girls shall have their way,--"
145,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,That's the law at Grand'ther Baldwin's upon each Thanksgiving Day.
146,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
147,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"From from the parlor's sacred precincts, hark! a madder uproar yet;"
148,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Roguish Charlie's playing stage-coach, and the stage-coach has upset!"
149,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
150,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Joe, black-eyed and laughter-loving, Grand'ther's specs his nose across,"
151,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Gravely winks at brother Willie, who is gayly playing horse."
152,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
153,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Grandma's face is fairly radiant; Grand'ther knows not how to frown,"
154,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"though the children, in their frolic, turn the old house upside down."
155,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
156,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
157,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"For the boys may hold high revel, and the girls must have their way;"
158,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,That's the law at Grand'ther Baldwin's upon each Thanksgiving Day.
159,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
160,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,But the dinner--ah! the dinner--words are feeble to portray
161,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,What a culinary triumph is achieved Thanksgiving Day!
162,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
163,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Fairly groans the board with dainties, but the turkey rules the roast,"
164,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Aldermanic at the outset, at the last a fleshless ghost."
165,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
166,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Then the richness of the pudding, and the flavor of the pie,"
167,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,When you've dined at Grandma Baldwin's you will know as well as I.
168,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
169,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"When, at length, the feast was ended, Grand'ther Baldwin bent his head,"
170,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"And, amid the solemn silence, with a reverent voice, he said:--"
171,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
172,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"""Now unto God, the Gracious One, we thanks and homage pay,"
173,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"Who guardeth us, and guideth us, and loveth us always!"
174,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
175,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"""He scatters blessings in our paths, He giveth us increase,"
176,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"He crowns us with His kindnesses, and granteth us His peace."
177,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
178,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"""Unto himself, our wandering feet, we pray that He may draw,"
179,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,"And may we strive, with faithful hearts, to keep His holy law!"""
180,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
181,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
182,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,His simple words in silence died: a moment's hush. And then
183,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,From all the listening hearts there rose a solemn-voiced Amen!
184,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
185,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
186,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
187,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
188,GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING,
189,ST. NICHOLAS.,ST. NICHOLAS.
190,ST. NICHOLAS.,
191,ST. NICHOLAS.,"In the far-off Polar seas,"
192,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Far beyond the Hebrides,"
193,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Where the icebergs, towering high,"
194,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Seem to pierce the wintry sky,"
195,ST. NICHOLAS.,And the fur-clad Esquimaux
196,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Glides in sledges o'er the snow,"
197,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Dwells St. Nick, the merry wight,"
198,ST. NICHOLAS.,Patron saint of Christmas night.
199,ST. NICHOLAS.,
200,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Solid walls of massive ice,"
201,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Bearing many a quaint device,"
202,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Flanked by graceful turrets twain,"
203,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Clear as clearest porcelain,"
204,ST. NICHOLAS.,Bearing at a lofty height
205,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Christ's pure cross in simple white,"
206,ST. NICHOLAS.,Carven with surpassing art
207,ST. NICHOLAS.,From an iceberg's crystal heart.
208,ST. NICHOLAS.,
209,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Here St. Nick, in royal state,"
210,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Dwells, until December late"
211,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Clips the days at either end,"
212,ST. NICHOLAS.,And the nights at each extend;
213,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Then, with his attendant sprites,"
214,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Scours the earth on wintry nights,"
215,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Bringing home, in well-filled hands,"
216,ST. NICHOLAS.,Children's gifts from many lands.
217,ST. NICHOLAS.,
218,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Here are whistles, tops and toys,"
219,ST. NICHOLAS.,Meant to gladden little boys;
220,ST. NICHOLAS.,Skates and sleds that soon will glide
221,ST. NICHOLAS.,O'er the ice or steep hill-side.
222,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Here are dolls with flaxen curls,"
223,ST. NICHOLAS.,Sure to charm the little girls;
224,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Christmas books, with pictures gay,"
225,ST. NICHOLAS.,For this welcome holiday.
226,ST. NICHOLAS.,
227,ST. NICHOLAS.,In the court the reindeer wait;
228,ST. NICHOLAS.,Filled the sledge with costly freight.
229,ST. NICHOLAS.,"As the first faint shadow falls,"
230,ST. NICHOLAS.,Promptly from his icy halls
231,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Steps St. Nick, and grasps the rein:"
232,ST. NICHOLAS.,"And afar, in measured time,"
233,ST. NICHOLAS.,Sounds the sleigh-bells' silver chime.
234,ST. NICHOLAS.,
235,ST. NICHOLAS.,Like an arrow from the bow
236,ST. NICHOLAS.,Speed the reindeer o'er the snow.
237,ST. NICHOLAS.,Onward! Now the loaded sleigh
238,ST. NICHOLAS.,Skirts the shores of Hudson's Bay.
239,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Onward, till the stunted tree"
240,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Gains a loftier majesty,"
241,ST. NICHOLAS.,And the curling smoke-wreaths rise
242,ST. NICHOLAS.,Under less inclement skies.
243,ST. NICHOLAS.,
244,ST. NICHOLAS.,Built upon a hill-side steep
245,ST. NICHOLAS.,Lies a city wrapt in sleep.
246,ST. NICHOLAS.,Up and down the lonely street
247,ST. NICHOLAS.,Sleepy watchmen pace their beat.
248,ST. NICHOLAS.,Little heeds them Santa Claus;
249,ST. NICHOLAS.,Not for him are human laws.
250,ST. NICHOLAS.,"With a leap he leaves the ground,"
251,ST. NICHOLAS.,Scales the chimney at a bound.
252,ST. NICHOLAS.,
253,ST. NICHOLAS.,Five small stockings hang below;
254,ST. NICHOLAS.,Five small stockings in a row.
255,ST. NICHOLAS.,From his pocket blithe St. Nick
256,ST. NICHOLAS.,Fills the waiting stockings quick;
257,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Some with sweetmeats, some with toys,"
258,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Gifts for girls, and gifts for boys,"
259,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Mounts the chimney like a bird,"
260,ST. NICHOLAS.,And the bells are once more heard.
261,ST. NICHOLAS.,
262,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Santa Claus! Good Christmas saint,"
263,ST. NICHOLAS.,In whose heart no selfish taint
264,ST. NICHOLAS.,
265,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Findeth place, some homes there be"
266,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Where no stockings wait for thee,"
267,ST. NICHOLAS.,Homes where sad young faces wear
268,ST. NICHOLAS.,"Painful marks of Want and Care,"
269,ST. NICHOLAS.,And the Christmas morning brings
270,ST. NICHOLAS.,No fair hope of better things.
271,ST. NICHOLAS.,
272,ST. NICHOLAS.,Can you not some crumbs bestow
273,ST. NICHOLAS.,On these Children steeped in woe;
274,ST. NICHOLAS.,Steal a single look of care
275,ST. NICHOLAS.,Which their sad young faces wear;
276,ST. NICHOLAS.,From your overflowing store
277,ST. NICHOLAS.,Give to them whose hearts are sore?
278,ST. NICHOLAS.,No sad eyes should greet the morn
279,ST. NICHOLAS.,When the infant Christ was born.

283,ST. NICHOLAS.,
284,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.
285,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
286,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"'Tis just three months and eke a day,"
287,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Since in the meadows, raking hay,"
288,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,On looking up I chanced to see
289,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"The manor's lord, young Arnold Lee,"
290,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"With a loose hand on the rein,"
291,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Riding slowly down the lane.
292,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,As I gazed with earnest look
293,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"On his face as on a book,"
294,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"As if conscious of the gaze,"
295,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Suddenly he turned the rays
296,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Of his brilliant eyes on me.
297,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Then I looked down hastily,"
298,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"While my heart, like caged bird,"
299,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Fluttered till it might be heard.
300,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Foolish, foolish Barbara!"
301,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
302,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"We had never met before,"
303,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"He had been so long away,"
304,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Visiting some foreign shore,"
305,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,I have heard my father say.
306,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"What in truth was he to me,"
307,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Rich and handsome Arnold Lee?
308,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Fate had placed us far apart;
309,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Why, then, did my restless heart"
310,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Flutter when his careless glance
311,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Fell on me by merest chance?
312,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Foolish, foolish Barbara!"
313,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
314,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,There are faces--are there not?--
315,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,That can never be forgot.
316,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Looks that seen but once impress
317,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,With peculiar vividness.
318,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,So it was with Arnold Lee.
319,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Why it was I cannot say
320,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"That, through all the livelong day"
321,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,He seemed ever near to me.
322,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"While I raked, as in a dream,"
323,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Now the same place o'er and o'er,"
324,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Till my little sister chid,"
325,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"And with full eyes opened wide,"
326,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Much in wonder, gently cried,"
327,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"""Why, what ails thee, Barbara?"""
328,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
329,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,I am in the fields again;
330,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"'Tis a pleasant day in June,"
331,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"All the songsters are in tune,"
332,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Pouring out their matin hymn.
333,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,All at once a conscious thrill
334,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Led me, half against my will,"
335,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,To look up. Abashed I see
336,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,His dark eyes full fixed on me.
337,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"What he said I do not know,"
338,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"But his voice was soft and low,"
339,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"As he spoke in careless chat,"
340,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Now of this and now of that,"
341,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,While the murmurous waves of sound
342,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Wafted me a bliss profound.
343,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Foolish, foolish Barbara!"
344,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
345,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Am I waking? Scarce I know
346,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"If I wake or if I dream,"
347,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,So unreal all things seem;
348,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Yet I could not well forego
349,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"This sweet dream, if dream it be,"
350,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,That has brought such joy to me.
351,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"He has told me that he loves me,--"
352,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,He in rank so far above me;
353,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"And when I, with cheeks aglow,"
354,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,Told him that it was not meet
355,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"He should wed with one so low,"
356,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"He should wed with one so low,"
357,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Then he said, in accents sweet,"
358,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"""Far be thoughts of rank or pelf;"
359,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Dear, I love thee for thyself!"""
360,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,"Happy, happy Barbara!"
361,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,

363,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
364,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
365,BARBARA'S COURTSHIP.,
366,THE CONFESSION.,THE CONFESSION.
367,THE CONFESSION.,
368,THE CONFESSION.,"I am glad that you have come,"
369,THE CONFESSION.,"Arthur, from the dusty town;"
370,THE CONFESSION.,"You must throw aside your cares,"
371,THE CONFESSION.,And relax your legal frown.
372,THE CONFESSION.,"Coke and Littleton, avaunt!"
373,THE CONFESSION.,You have ruled him through the day;
374,THE CONFESSION.,"In this quiet, sylvan haunt,"
375,THE CONFESSION.,Be content to yield your sway.
376,THE CONFESSION.,
377,THE CONFESSION.,"It is pleasant, is it not,"
378,THE CONFESSION.,"Sitting here beneath the trees,"
379,THE CONFESSION.,While the restless wind above
380,THE CONFESSION.,Ripples over leafy seas?
381,THE CONFESSION.,
382,THE CONFESSION.,"Often, when the twilight falls,"
383,THE CONFESSION.,"In the shadow, quite alone,"
384,THE CONFESSION.,"I have sat till starlight came,"
385,THE CONFESSION.,Listening to its monotone.
386,THE CONFESSION.,"Yet not always quite alone,--"
387,THE CONFESSION.,"Brother, let me take the place"
388,THE CONFESSION.,Just behind you now the moon
389,THE CONFESSION.,Shines no longer in my face.
390,THE CONFESSION.,
391,THE CONFESSION.,It is near two months ago
392,THE CONFESSION.,"Since I met him, as I think,"
393,THE CONFESSION.,"By God's mercy, when my horse"
394,THE CONFESSION.,Trembled on the river's brink.
395,THE CONFESSION.,"I had fallen, but his arm"
396,THE CONFESSION.,"Firmly seized the bridle-rein,"
397,THE CONFESSION.,"And, with one decided grasp,"
398,THE CONFESSION.,Drew me back to life again.
399,THE CONFESSION.,I was grateful and essayed
400,THE CONFESSION.,Fitting words my thanks to speak.
401,THE CONFESSION.,"Arthur, when the heart feels most,"
402,THE CONFESSION.,"Words, I think, are oftenest weak."
403,THE CONFESSION.,
404,THE CONFESSION.,
405,THE CONFESSION.,"So I stammered and I fear,"
406,THE CONFESSION.,What I said had little grace
407,THE CONFESSION.,"But I knew he understood,"
408,THE CONFESSION.,By the smile upon his face.
409,THE CONFESSION.,There are faces--his was such--
410,THE CONFESSION.,That are sealed when in repose;
411,THE CONFESSION.,"Only when a smile floods out,"
412,THE CONFESSION.,All the soul in beauty glows.
413,THE CONFESSION.,"With that smile I grew content,"
414,THE CONFESSION.,"And my heart grew strangely calm,"
415,THE CONFESSION.,"As with trustful step I walked,"
416,THE CONFESSION.,My arm resting on his arm.
417,THE CONFESSION.,
418,THE CONFESSION.,"Brother, turn your face away,"
419,THE CONFESSION.,"So, dear, I can tell you best"
420,THE CONFESSION.,All that followed; but be sure
421,THE CONFESSION.,You are looking to the west.
422,THE CONFESSION.,"Arthur, I have seen him since,"
423,THE CONFESSION.,"Nearly every day, until"
424,THE CONFESSION.,"If I lose him, all my life"
425,THE CONFESSION.,"Would grow wan, and dark, and chill."
426,THE CONFESSION.,"Brother, this my love impute"
427,THE CONFESSION.,Not to me for maiden-shame;
428,THE CONFESSION.,"He has sought me for his wife,"
429,THE CONFESSION.,He would crown me with his name.
430,THE CONFESSION.,Only yesterday he said
431,THE CONFESSION.,That my love his life would bless:
432,THE CONFESSION.,"Would I grant it? Arthur, dear,"
433,THE CONFESSION.,"Was I wrong in saying ""Yes""?"

445,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
446,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"Mine! Do you hear it, silver moon,"
447,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Flooding my heart with your mellow shine?

461,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,I can hear her sweet voice even now--
462,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,It makes my pulses leap and thrill--
463,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""I owe you more than I well can pay;"
464,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"You may take me, Robert, if you will!"""
465,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
466,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"One pleasant summer night,"

471,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"Till, from a leafy arbor near,"

473,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Who can be with Rose to night?
474,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Let me hide me under the beach.
475,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
476,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"It must be one of her female friends,"
477,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Talking with her in the gloaming gray;
478,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Perchance--I thought--they may speak of me;
479,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Let me listen to what they say.
480,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
481,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"This I said with a careless smile,"
482,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,And a joyous heart that was free from fears;
483,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Little I dreamed that the words I heard
484,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Would weigh on my heavy heart for years.
485,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
486,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""Rose, my Rose! for your heart is mine,"""
487,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"I heard in a low voice, passion-fraught,"
488,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""In the sight of Heaven we are truly one;"

491,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""Will you give your hand where your heart goes not"
492,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,To a man who is grave and stern and old;
493,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"And whose love compared with my passion-heat,"
494,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"As the snow of the frozen North, is cold?"""
495,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
496,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,And Rose--I could feel her cheek grow pale--
497,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"Her voice was tremulous, then grew strong--"
498,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""Richard,"" she said, ""your words are wild,"

502,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,She spoke in a tremulous undertone--
503,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""Bereft of friends, o'er the world's highways,"
504,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,I wandered forth as a child alone?
505,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
506,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""He opened to me his home and heart--"

518,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"Her voice was broken; she only said,"
519,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""Have pity, Richard, and let me go!"""
520,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
521,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"And then--Heaven gave me strength, I think--"
522,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,I stood before them calm and still;
523,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,You might have thought my tranquil breast
524,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,Had never known one passion-thrill.
525,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
526,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,And they alternate flushed and paled;
527,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"Rose tottered, and I feared would fall;"
528,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"I caught her in supporting arms,"

531,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,"""I had a dream, but it is passed,"

540,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,
541,ROSE IN THE GARDEN.,I placed her passive hand in his--

554,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Child, you're running a long account"
555,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Up, to be squared on Judgment-day."
556,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
557,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""Where have you been? and what have you there?"""
558,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""To the pasture for buttercups wet with dew."""
559,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""My patience! I think you are out of your wits;"
560,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,I wonder what good will buttercups do?

562,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""There's pennyroyal you might have got,--"
563,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"It might have been useful to you or me,"
564,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"But I never heard, in all my life,"
565,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,Of buttercup cordial or buttercup tea.
566,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
567,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""I want you to stay and mind the bread,"
568,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,I've just put two loaves in the oven to bake;
569,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"When they are clone take them carefully out,"
570,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And put in their place this loaf of cake,"

577,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""It was very different when I was young;"
578,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Young men were prudent, and girls were wise;"
579,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,You wouldn't catch them gadding about
580,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Like so many idle butterflies."""
581,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
582,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"So bustled and scolded the worthy dame,"
583,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Until she had passed the outer sill,"
584,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"To do her justice, it seldom chanced"
585,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"That her hands were idle, or tongue was still."
586,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
587,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
588,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"So Phoebe gathered her knitting up,"
589,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And sat her down in the chimney niche;
590,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"But her mind was on other thoughts intent,"
591,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And here and there she dropped a stitch.
592,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
593,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"The yellow kitten purred on the hearth,"
594,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"While the kitchen clock, with its frame of oak,"
595,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"In the corner stood, like a sentinel,"
596,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And challenged time with its measured stroke.
597,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
598,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,But Phoebe's mind was on none of these:
599,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"The bread in the oven, her good aunt's frown,"
600,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And the scene before her faded away,"
601,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And blended with thoughts of Reuben Brown:
602,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
603,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"How they walked together on summer days,"
604,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Or bravely faced the winter's chill,"
605,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And chatted merrily all the way
606,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,To the little school-house on Sligo Hill.
607,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
608,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"How both grew older, and school-days passed,"
609,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"When he was a youth, and a maiden she;"
610,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,How often she went with Reuben Brown
611,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,To the rustic dance or the social bee.
612,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
613,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"The warm flush deepened on Phoebe's cheek,"
614,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And she breathed a low, half-conscious sigh;"
615,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""Ah, well-a-day! they were happy times,"
616,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"But he has forgotten, and so must I."""
617,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
618,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"So Phoebe gathered her knitting up,"
619,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Which, while she was thinking, had fallen down,"
620,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"When her quick ear caught a strange footfall,"
621,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And there in the doorway stood Reuben Brown,"
622,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
623,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"With the same frank, handsome face she knew,"
624,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"A smile as bright, and an eye as black--"
625,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""Phoebe,"" he said, ""I have wandered far;"
626,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Are you glad to see your playmate back?"""
627,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
628,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"The kitten still purred on the kitchen hearth,"
629,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And the ancient clock, with its frame of oak,"
630,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"In the corner stood, like a sentinel,"
631,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And challenged time with its measured stroke.
632,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
633,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,A pleased light shone in the maiden's eyes;
634,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Ah, love, young love, it is very sweet!"
635,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Reuben had gone, but she sat quite still,"
636,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And the knitting lay untouched at her feet.
637,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
638,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Just then the dame came bustling in,"
639,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,And went to the oven without ado.
640,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"""Why, Phoebe, child, what have you done?"
641,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"The bread is baked as black as my shoe!"""
642,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
643,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And Phoebe started, and blushed for shame,"
644,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,Took up her knitting and dropped it down;
645,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"And when her aunt said, ""What ails you, child?"""
646,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"She hastily answered, ""Reuben Brown."""
647,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,
648,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"Ah, love! young love! it is very sweet,"
649,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"In field, or hamlet, or crowded mart;"
650,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,"But it burns with the brightest, purest flame"
651,PHOEBE'S WOOING.,In the hidden depths of a young maid's heart.

661,THE LOST HEART.,
662,THE LOST HEART.,His locks with careless grace
663,THE LOST HEART.,Rimmed round his handsome face
664,THE LOST HEART.,And drifted outward on the airy surge.
665,THE LOST HEART.,
666,THE LOST HEART.,"So blithe of heart was he,"
667,THE LOST HEART.,"He hummed a melody,"
668,THE LOST HEART.,And all the birds were hushed to hear him sing.
669,THE LOST HEART.,
670,THE LOST HEART.,Across his shoulders flung
671,THE LOST HEART.,His bow and baldric hung:
672,THE LOST HEART.,"So, in true huntsman's guise, he threads the wood."
673,THE LOST HEART.,
674,THE LOST HEART.,"The sun mounts up the sky,"
675,THE LOST HEART.,"The air moves sluggishly,"
676,THE LOST HEART.,And reeks with summer heat in every pore.
677,THE LOST HEART.,
678,THE LOST HEART.,"His limbs begin to tire,"
679,THE LOST HEART.,Slumbers his youthful fire;
680,THE LOST HEART.,He sinks upon a violet-bed to rest.
681,THE LOST HEART.,
682,THE LOST HEART.,The soft winds go and come
683,THE LOST HEART.,"With low and drowsy hum,"
684,THE LOST HEART.,And ope for him the ivory gate of dreams.
685,THE LOST HEART.,
686,THE LOST HEART.,Beneath the forest-shade
687,THE LOST HEART.,"There trips a woodland maid,"
688,THE LOST HEART.,And marks with startled eye the sleeping youth.
689,THE LOST HEART.,
690,THE LOST HEART.,"At first she thought to fly,"
691,THE LOST HEART.,"Then, timid, drawing nigh,"
692,THE LOST HEART.,She gazed in wonder on his fair young face.
693,THE LOST HEART.,
694,THE LOST HEART.,When swiftly stooping down
695,THE LOST HEART.,Upon his locks so brown
696,THE LOST HEART.,"She lightly pressed her lips, and blushing fled."
697,THE LOST HEART.,
698,THE LOST HEART.,"When Colin woke from sleep,"
699,THE LOST HEART.,"From slumbers calm and deep,"
700,THE LOST HEART.,He felt--he knew not how--his heart had flown.
701,THE LOST HEART.,
702,THE LOST HEART.,"And so, with anxious care,"
703,THE LOST HEART.,"He wandered here and there,"
704,THE LOST HEART.,But could not find his lost heart anywhere.
705,THE LOST HEART.,
706,THE LOST HEART.,"Then he, with air distraught,"
707,THE LOST HEART.,"And brow of anxious thought,"
708,THE LOST HEART.,Went out into the world beyond the wood.
709,THE LOST HEART.,
710,THE LOST HEART.,"Of each that passed him by,"
711,THE LOST HEART.,"He queried anxiously,"
712,THE LOST HEART.,"""I prithee, hast thou seen a heart astray?"""
713,THE LOST HEART.,
714,THE LOST HEART.,"Some stared and hurried on,"
715,THE LOST HEART.,While others said in scorn.

717,THE LOST HEART.,
718,THE LOST HEART.,"The day is wearing fast,"
719,THE LOST HEART.,Young Colin comes at last
720,THE LOST HEART.,To where a cottage stood embowered in trees.
721,THE LOST HEART.,
722,THE LOST HEART.,"He looks within, and there"

725,THE LOST HEART.,
726,THE LOST HEART.,"""I prithee, maiden bright,""--"
727,THE LOST HEART.,"She turns as quick as light,"
728,THE LOST HEART.,And straight a warm flush crimsons all her face.
729,THE LOST HEART.,
730,THE LOST HEART.,"She, much abashed, looks down,"
731,THE LOST HEART.,For on his locks so brown
732,THE LOST HEART.,She seems to see the marks her lips have made.

757,JOHN MAYNARD.,
758,JOHN MAYNARD.,"Ah, who beneath that cloudless sky,"

771,JOHN MAYNARD.,"Alas, too late! Though quick, and sharp,"
772,JOHN MAYNARD.,"And clear his orders came,"
773,JOHN MAYNARD.,No human efforts could avail
774,JOHN MAYNARD.,To quench the insidious flame.
775,JOHN MAYNARD.,
776,JOHN MAYNARD.,"The bad news quickly reached the deck,"

789,JOHN MAYNARD.,"""Head her south-east!"" the captain shouts,"
790,JOHN MAYNARD.,"Above the smothered roar,--"
