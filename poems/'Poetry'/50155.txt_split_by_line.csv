28,MCMXV,Rihaku flourished in the eighth century of our era. The
29,MCMXV,Anglo-Saxon Seafarer is of about this period. The other

34,MCMXV,Song of the Bowmen of Shu
35,MCMXV,
36,MCMXV,"Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots"
37,MCMXV,And saying: When shall we get back to our country?
38,MCMXV,Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our
39,MCMXV,"foemen,"
40,MCMXV,We have no comfort because of these Mongols.
41,MCMXV,"We grub the soft fern-shoots,"
42,MCMXV,"When anyone says ""Return,"" the others are full of"
43,MCMXV,sorrow.
44,MCMXV,"Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry"
45,MCMXV,and thirsty.
46,MCMXV,"Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let"
47,MCMXV,his friend return.
48,MCMXV,We grub the old fern-stalks.
49,MCMXV,We say: Will we be let to go back in October?
50,MCMXV,"There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort."
51,MCMXV,"Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our"
52,MCMXV,country.
53,MCMXV,What flower has come into blossom?
54,MCMXV,Whose chariot? The General's.
55,MCMXV,"Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong."
56,MCMXV,"We have no rest, three battles a month."
57,MCMXV,"By heaven, his horses are tired."
58,MCMXV,"The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them"
59,MCMXV,"The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory"
60,MCMXV,arrows and quivers ornamented with fish-skin.
61,MCMXV,"The enemy is swift, we must be careful."
62,MCMXV,"When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,"
63,MCMXV,"We come back in the snow,"
64,MCMXV,"We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,"
65,MCMXV,"Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?"

73,MCMXV,
74,MCMXV,"Blue, blue is the grass about the river"
75,MCMXV,And the willows have overfilled the close garden.
76,MCMXV,"And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth,"
77,MCMXV,"White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door."
78,MCMXV,"Slender, she puts forth a slender hand,"
79,MCMXV,
80,MCMXV,"And she was a courtezan in the old days,"
81,MCMXV,"And she has married a sot,"
82,MCMXV,Who now goes drunkenly out
83,MCMXV,And leaves her too much alone.

99,_B.C. 140._,"We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water,"

101,_B.C. 140._,"A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen"
102,_B.C. 140._,Would follow the white gulls or ride them.
103,_B.C. 140._,Kutsu's prose song

106,_B.C. 140._,King So's terraced palace
107,_B.C. 140._,"is now but a barren hill,"
108,_B.C. 140._,But I draw pen on this barge
109,_B.C. 140._,"Causing the five peaks to tremble,"
110,_B.C. 140._,And I have joy in these words
111,_B.C. 140._,like the joy of blue islands.
112,_B.C. 140._,(If glory could last forever
113,_B.C. 140._,Then the waters of Han would flow northward.)
114,_B.C. 140._,
115,_B.C. 140._,"And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting"
116,_B.C. 140._,an order-to-write!
117,_B.C. 140._,"I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured"
118,_B.C. 140._,water
119,_B.C. 140._,"Just reflecting the sky's tinge,"
120,_B.C. 140._,And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing.
121,_B.C. 140._,
122,_B.C. 140._,The eastern wind brings the green colour into the island
123,_B.C. 140._,"grasses at Yei-shu,"

130,_B.C. 140._,Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from carved
131,_B.C. 140._,"railings,"
132,_B.C. 140._,"And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each"
133,_B.C. 140._,"other, and listen,"
134,_B.C. 140._,"Crying--""Kwan, Kuan,"" for the early wind, and the feel"

139,_B.C. 140._,And the Emperor is at Ko.
140,_B.C. 140._,"Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky,"
141,_B.C. 140._,The imperial guards come forth from the golden house with
142,_B.C. 140._,their armour a-gleaming.
143,_B.C. 140._,The emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his
144,_B.C. 140._,"flowers,"
145,_B.C. 140._,"He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks,"
146,_B.C. 140._,"He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new nightingales,"

158,_B.C. 140._,
159,_B.C. 140._,While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
160,_B.C. 140._,"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers."
161,_B.C. 140._,"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,"
162,_B.C. 140._,"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums."
163,_B.C. 140._,And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
164,_B.C. 140._,"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion."
165,_B.C. 140._,
166,_B.C. 140._,At fourteen I married My Lord you.

170,_B.C. 140._,
171,_B.C. 140._,"At fifteen I stopped scowling,"
172,_B.C. 140._,I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
173,_B.C. 140._,"Forever and forever, and forever."
174,_B.C. 140._,Why should I climb the look out?
175,_B.C. 140._,
176,_B.C. 140._,"At sixteen you departed,"
177,_B.C. 140._,"You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies,"
178,_B.C. 140._,And you have been gone five months.
179,_B.C. 140._,The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.
180,_B.C. 140._,You dragged your feet when you went out.
181,_B.C. 140._,"By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,"
182,_B.C. 140._,Too deep to clear them away!
183,_B.C. 140._,"The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind."
184,_B.C. 140._,The paired butterflies are already yellow with August

186,_B.C. 140._,"They hurt me,"
187,_B.C. 140._,"I grow older,"
188,_B.C. 140._,"If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,"

201,_B.C. 140._,"The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,"
202,_B.C. 140._,"It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,"
203,_B.C. 140._,And I let down the crystal curtain
204,_B.C. 140._,And watch the moon through the clear autumn.

211,_B.C. 140._,"therefore there is something to complain, of. Gauze"
212,_B.C. 140._,"stockings, therefore a court lady, not a servant who"
213,_B.C. 140._,"complains. Clear autumn, therefore he has no excuse on"
214,_B.C. 140._,"account of weather. Also she has come early, for the dew"
215,_B.C. 140._,"has not merely whitened the stairs, but has soaked her"
216,_B.C. 140._,stockings. The poem is especially prized because she utters
217,_B.C. 140._,no direct reproach.

227,_B.C. 140._,"At morning there are flowers to cut the heart,"
228,_B.C. 140._,And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing waters.
229,_B.C. 140._,"Petals are on the gone waters and on the going,"
230,_B.C. 140._,"And on the back-swirling eddies,"
231,_B.C. 140._,"But to-days men are not the men of the old days,"
232,_B.C. 140._,Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.
233,_B.C. 140._,
234,_B.C. 140._,The sea's colour moves at the dawn
235,_B.C. 140._,"And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne,"
236,_B.C. 140._,"And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo,"
237,_B.C. 140._,And clings to the walls and the gate-top.
238,_B.C. 140._,"With head-gear glittering against the cloud and sun,"
239,_B.C. 140._,"The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders."
240,_B.C. 140._,"They ride upon dragon-like horses,"
241,_B.C. 140._,"Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow-metal,"
242,_B.C. 140._,And the streets make way for their passage.
243,_B.C. 140._,"Haughty their passing,"
244,_B.C. 140._,"Haughty their steps as they go into great banquets,"
245,_B.C. 140._,"To high halls and curious food,"
246,_B.C. 140._,"To the perfumed air and girls dancing,"
247,_B.C. 140._,To clear flutes and clear singing;
248,_B.C. 140._,To the dance of the seventy couples;
249,_B.C. 140._,To the mad chase through the gardens.
250,_B.C. 140._,Night and day are given over to pleasure
251,_B.C. 140._,"And they think it will last a thousand autumns,"
252,_B.C. 140._,Unwearying autumns.
253,_B.C. 140._,"For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain,"
254,_B.C. 140._,"And what are they compared to the lady Riokushu,"
255,_B.C. 140._,That was cause of hate!

270,_B.C. 140._,"Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn."
271,_B.C. 140._,I climb the towers and towers
272,_B.C. 140._,to watch out the barbarous land:
273,_B.C. 140._,"Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert."
274,_B.C. 140._,There is no wall left to this village.
275,_B.C. 140._,"Bones white with a thousand frosts,"
276,_B.C. 140._,"High heaps, covered with trees and grass;"
277,_B.C. 140._,Who brought this to pass?
278,_B.C. 140._,Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?
279,_B.C. 140._,Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?
280,_B.C. 140._,Barbarous kings.
281,_B.C. 140._,"A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,"
282,_B.C. 140._,"A turmoil of wars-men, spread over the middle kingdom,"
283,_B.C. 140._,"Three hundred and sixty thousand,"
284,_B.C. 140._,"And sorrow, sorrow like rain."
285,_B.C. 140._,"Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning,"
286,_B.C. 140._,"Desolate, desolate fields,"
287,_B.C. 140._,"And no children of warfare upon them,"
288,_B.C. 140._,No longer the men for offence and defence.
289,_B.C. 140._,"Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate,"
290,_B.C. 140._,"With Rihoku's name forgotten,"

301,_B.C. 140._,"To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of Gen."
302,_B.C. 140._,Now I remember that you built me a special tavern
303,_B.C. 140._,By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.
304,_B.C. 140._,"With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs"
305,_B.C. 140._,and laughter
306,_B.C. 140._,"And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the"

308,_B.C. 140._,Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from
309,_B.C. 140._,"the west border,"
310,_B.C. 140._,"And with them, and with you especially"
311,_B.C. 140._,"There was nothing at cross purpose,"
312,_B.C. 140._,And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain
313,_B.C. 140._,"crossing,"
314,_B.C. 140._,"If only they could be of that fellowship,"
315,_B.C. 140._,"And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without"

317,_B.C. 140._,
318,_B.C. 140._,"And then I was sent off to South Wei,"
319,_B.C. 140._,"smothered in laurel groves,"
320,_B.C. 140._,"And you to the north of Raku-hoku,"
321,_B.C. 140._,Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.

323,_B.C. 140._,"And then, when separation had come to its worst,"
324,_B.C. 140._,"We met, and travelled into Sen-Go,"

326,_B.C. 140._,"twisting waters,"
327,_B.C. 140._,"Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers,"
328,_B.C. 140._,That was the first valley;
329,_B.C. 140._,And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and
330,_B.C. 140._,pine-winds.
331,_B.C. 140._,"And with silver harness and reins of gold,"
332,_B.C. 140._,Out come the East of Kan foreman and his company.
333,_B.C. 140._,"And there came also the ""True man"" of Shi-yo to meet me,"
334,_B.C. 140._,Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.
335,_B.C. 140._,In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more Sennin
336,_B.C. 140._,"music,"
337,_B.C. 140._,"Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix broods."
338,_B.C. 140._,"The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced"
339,_B.C. 140._,because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still
340,_B.C. 140._,With that music-playing.
341,_B.C. 140._,"And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on"
342,_B.C. 140._,"his lap,"
343,_B.C. 140._,"And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,"
344,_B.C. 140._,"And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars,"
345,_B.C. 140._,or rain.
346,_B.C. 140._,"I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,"
347,_B.C. 140._,You back to your river-bridge.
348,_B.C. 140._,
349,_B.C. 140._,"And your father, who was brave as a leopard,"
350,_B.C. 140._,"Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian rabble."
351,_B.C. 140._,"And one May he had you send for me,"

353,_B.C. 140._,"And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't"
354,_B.C. 140._,"hard going,"
355,_B.C. 140._,Over roads twisted like sheeps' guts.
356,_B.C. 140._,"And I was still going, late in the year,"
357,_B.C. 140._,"in the cutting wind from the North,"
358,_B.C. 140._,"And thinking how little you cared for the cost,"
359,_B.C. 140._,and you caring enough to pay it.
360,_B.C. 140._,And what a reception:
361,_B.C. 140._,"Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,"
362,_B.C. 140._,"And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning."
363,_B.C. 140._,And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the
364,_B.C. 140._,"castle,"
