178,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
179,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The old log house where Margaret lived, whose roof had mossy grown,"
180,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"Reposed amid its clump of trees, a queen upon her throne."
181,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The landscape round smiled proudly and the flowers shed sweet perfume,"
182,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,When Margaret plied the shuttle of the rude old-fashioned loom.
183,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
184,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,The world has grown fastidious--demands things ever new--
185,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,But we could once see beauties in the rainbow's every hue;
186,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The bee could then find nectar in a common clover bloom,"
187,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,And simple hearts hear music in the shuttle of the loom.
188,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
189,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,The picture that my memory paints is never seen to-day--
190,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,The April sun of by-gone years has lost its brightest ray:
191,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"A fancy-wrought piano in a quaint, antique old room,"
192,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,But Margaret sang her sweetest to the music of the loom.
193,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
194,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"She wore a simple home-spun dress, for Margaret's taste was plain,"
195,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"Yet life was like a song to her, with work a sweet refrain."
196,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The sunshine filled her days with joy, night's shadows brought"
197,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,no gloom.
198,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,When Margaret plied the shuttle of the old old-fashioned loom.
199,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
200,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"Her warp of life was toiling hard, but love its beauteous woof."
201,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The web she wove, a character beyond the world's reproof."
202,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"O girls of wealth and beauty vain, who dress in rich costume,"
203,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,How sweet the shuttle's music of this rare old-fashioned loom.
204,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,
205,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"The world may grow fastidious in art and nature too,"
206,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,And say there is no beauty in the rainbow's every hue;
207,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,"And yet the bee finds nectar in a common clover bloom,"
208,THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM,And I still love the music of the old old-fashioned loom.

216,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Dear old Old Clock, thy grave tick tock"
217,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"I heard in my childhood days,"
218,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"In the solemn night, when the fire burned bright,"
219,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,And the lamp cast feeble rays;
220,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"When grandmother close by the mantelpiece,"
221,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Sat dozing or knitting, or carding fleece,"
222,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Or watching the dying blaze;
223,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,When mother was young and her beautiful hair
224,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Had never a silver thread;
225,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"When her life was fair as her love was rare,"
226,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,In the years that have swiftly sped.
227,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,
228,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Thy grave tick tock, dear old Old Clock,"
229,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Unchanged through the changing years,"
230,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Still beating time in a ceaseless rhyme
231,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"To the dirge of the rolling spheres,--"
232,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Unmindful that she by the mantelpiece
233,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Is gone with her knitting and carding fleece,--"
234,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Unmoved by our sorrowing tears--
235,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,Brings back the days when mother's hair
236,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,"Had never a silver thread,"
237,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,And the life still fair in its beauty rare
238,THE OLD OLD CLOCK,When the snows had crowned her head.

243,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL
244,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
245,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
246,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,A cabin! It nestled amid the green hills
247,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"Where grew no bramble or thistle,--"
248,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Mid meadows melodious with music and trills
249,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,And song that the wild-throated mocking bird spills
250,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,On the air from his marvelous whistle.
251,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"No carpets were seen on the broad puncheon floors,"
252,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,No paintings that wealth would reveal;
253,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"But a statue was there that Art can not know,"
254,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"That filled the rude room with a musical glow,--"
255,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,'Twas Ruth at the Old Spinning Wheel!
256,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
257,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Long years have passed by; its music was stilled
258,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,At rattle and whirr of machinery.
259,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"And the pea-fowl now screams where the mocking bird trilled,"
260,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,And the landscape is dead where once the heart thrilled
261,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,At wildwood and picturesque scenery.
262,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"The opera may boast the diva of song,"
263,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,To me she makes no appeal;
264,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"To flute obligato my heart is still dumb,"
265,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,But oh! for the song and musical hum
266,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Of Ruth and the Old Spinning Wheel!
267,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
268,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"She lived but a simple, plain rustic life,"
269,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Yet charming in sooth was her beauty.
270,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"In her untutored heart was love ever rife,"
271,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"The seat of no conflict, no struggle or strife"
272,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,'Twixt a selfish will and duty.
273,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"I bow at her altar of beauty and truth,"
274,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"At the shrine of her heart do I kneel,"
275,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"With a prayer no mortal ever lifted above,"
276,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Till my soul is atune with the music of love
277,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,She sings to the Old Spinning Wheel!
278,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
279,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"This unlettered maiden was poor, but high-bred,"
280,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"Oh, women of fashion far above you!"
281,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,And I thrilled at the graceful poise of her head
282,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"And the radiant smile of my love when she said,"
283,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"""Why James, you know that I love you."""
284,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"Nymph-like her lithe form swayed as in dance,"
285,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,I awkwardly sat at the reel--
286,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"A moment's surcease of monotonous thrum,--"
287,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Melodious the lull in the song and the hum
288,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Of Ruth and the Old Spinning Wheel!
289,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,
290,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,The glow of the incandescent light
291,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Has banished the tallow candle;
292,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"And the ox-cart is gone at steam's rapid flight,"
293,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"But Love is too subtle, is too recondite"
294,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,For Learning or Genius to handle.
295,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,"All honor to Science, let her keep her mad pace,"
296,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,I abate not a tittle her zeal;
297,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,But the splendors of life can never efface
298,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,The picture of Ruth in plain rustic grace
299,THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL,Who wrought at the Old Spinning Wheel!

304,THE OLD WATER MILL,THE OLD WATER MILL
305,THE OLD WATER MILL,
306,THE OLD WATER MILL,
307,THE OLD WATER MILL,"'Twas grinding day at the Old Water Mill,"
308,THE OLD WATER MILL,"But holiday with me,"
309,THE OLD WATER MILL,For I knew ere I reached the foot of the hill
310,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And heard the voice of the happy rill,"
311,THE OLD WATER MILL,The miller's beautiful child was there
312,THE OLD WATER MILL,That wore the tresses of sun-lit hair
313,THE OLD WATER MILL,And smile of witchery;
314,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And the twittering swallows awhirl in the air,"
315,THE OLD WATER MILL,Told in their ecstacy
316,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That Rachel, the Golden Daffodil,"
317,THE OLD WATER MILL,Was blooming again by the Old Water Mill.
318,THE OLD WATER MILL,
319,THE OLD WATER MILL,Together we cross the moss-covered log
320,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That spans the old mill race,"
321,THE OLD WATER MILL,And we hear through the mists and rising fog
322,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The boom of the dam, the croak of the frog,"
323,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That wakes, on the banks of the glinting stream,"
324,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The violet tranced in her winter dream,"
325,THE OLD WATER MILL,Where lights and shadows lace;
326,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And the cowslip, like the meteor's gleam,"
327,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Darts from her hiding-place,"
328,THE OLD WATER MILL,While the cataracts leap in their haste to fill
329,THE OLD WATER MILL,The floats of the wheel at the Old Water Mill.
330,THE OLD WATER MILL,
331,THE OLD WATER MILL,We sit by the dam of the placid stream
332,THE OLD WATER MILL,And watch the whirl and churn
333,THE OLD WATER MILL,Of the pouring floods that bubble and steam
334,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And glitter and flash in the bright sunbeam,"
335,THE OLD WATER MILL,While steadily rolls the dripping wheel
336,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That slowly grinds the farmers' meal,"
337,THE OLD WATER MILL,Who restless wait their turn;
338,THE OLD WATER MILL,But the lights in the miller's face reveal
339,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Never the least concern,"
340,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Who takes his toll, and whistles until"
341,THE OLD WATER MILL,The hopper is drained at the Old Water Mill.
342,THE OLD WATER MILL,
343,THE OLD WATER MILL,To-day we passed where the Old Water Mill
344,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Had stood in the long ago,"
345,THE OLD WATER MILL,"But the cataracts leap no more on the hill,"
346,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And the boom of the roaring dam is still,"
347,THE OLD WATER MILL,"For the gleaming stream in its grief went dry,"
348,THE OLD WATER MILL,When the ruthless hand of Art passed by
349,THE OLD WATER MILL,And laid the Old Mill low;
350,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And the violets, cold in death, now lie"
351,THE OLD WATER MILL,Wrapped in the glistening snow;
352,THE OLD WATER MILL,And the biting air is crisp and chill
353,THE OLD WATER MILL,Around the ruins of the Old Water Mill.
354,THE OLD WATER MILL,
355,THE OLD WATER MILL,And now we sit by the River of Time
356,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And gaze at the waves below,"
357,THE OLD WATER MILL,"But its brink is covered by frost and rime,"
358,THE OLD WATER MILL,And we hear on the wind a muffled chime
359,THE OLD WATER MILL,Proclaiming the end of a brief sojourn:
360,THE OLD WATER MILL,Yet the floods of life still whirl and churn
361,THE OLD WATER MILL,As the currents ebb and flow:--
362,THE OLD WATER MILL,By the rolling wheel we wait our turn
363,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Calm, but ready to go!"
364,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The hopper is drained, but unmoved still,"
365,THE OLD WATER MILL,The Miller who grinds in Time's Water Mill.

371,WATERLOO,
372,WATERLOO,
373,WATERLOO,"A meeting-house, no church at all,"
374,WATERLOO,"With stained cathedral glass,"
375,WATERLOO,"With lofty spire and arching hall,"
376,WATERLOO,And terraced lawns of grass:
377,WATERLOO,"No organ peals, no chanting choir,"
378,WATERLOO,No frescoed walls that men admire
379,WATERLOO,Had this old meeting-house;
380,WATERLOO,But roses wild their petals piled
381,WATERLOO,"About its sacred door,"
382,WATERLOO,"And locust bloom shed rich perfume,"
383,WATERLOO,"Upon the air, galore,"
384,WATERLOO,Around the meeting-house.
385,WATERLOO,
386,WATERLOO,It stood upon a limpid stream
387,WATERLOO,"My childhood thought divine,"
388,WATERLOO,Whose waters pure did ever gleam
389,WATERLOO,Like shimmering shine of wine;
390,WATERLOO,"It stood, alas! but stands no more"
391,WATERLOO,Upon the bank or pebbly shore
392,WATERLOO,Of sunny Pleasant Run;
393,WATERLOO,"Yet in my dreams, it often seems"
394,WATERLOO,"I see thee, Waterloo,"
395,WATERLOO,And see the flash of beaded splash
396,WATERLOO,"Upon the waters too,"
397,WATERLOO,While crossing Pleasant Run.
398,WATERLOO,
399,WATERLOO,"Yes, in my dreams, I often hear"
400,WATERLOO,The songs they used to sing--
401,WATERLOO,"Those solemn lays of reverent fear,"
402,WATERLOO,When Christ indeed was King:
403,WATERLOO,Then sinners bowed when prayer was led
404,WATERLOO,By some poor saint the ravens fed
405,WATERLOO,At holy Waterloo.
406,WATERLOO,"How free from lust, the simple trust"
407,WATERLOO,Of soul that worshipped there;
408,WATERLOO,How free from guile were men erstwhile
409,WATERLOO,"Whose creed was song and prayer,"
410,WATERLOO,The creed of Waterloo.
411,WATERLOO,
412,WATERLOO,The meeting days were always fair--
413,WATERLOO,God smiled on Waterloo!
414,WATERLOO,"And mother rode the dark brown mare,"
415,WATERLOO,"And took the mule colt, too;"
416,WATERLOO,For fashion then did not beguile
417,WATERLOO,"A mother's heart with worldly wile,"
418,WATERLOO,Ah! happy days agone!
419,WATERLOO,Oh! days no more when mothers wore
420,WATERLOO,"Sunhood and riding skirt,"
421,WATERLOO,"And fathers dressed their Sunday best,"
422,WATERLOO,"A plain check-cotton-shirt,--"
423,WATERLOO,Ah! happy days agone!
424,WATERLOO,
425,WATERLOO,The sunlight dances on the hills
426,WATERLOO,That shelter Waterloo;
427,WATERLOO,I see the gold of daffodils
428,WATERLOO,That bloom the meadow through--
429,WATERLOO,"The hour has come, for meeting's broke,"
430,WATERLOO,And now the simple country folk
431,WATERLOO,Are leaving Waterloo!
432,WATERLOO,"The horses neigh; away, away!"
433,WATERLOO,"Away, but not for home;"
434,WATERLOO,"Grandma to-day will laugh and say,"
435,WATERLOO,"""My boy, my boy has come."""
436,WATERLOO,"Oh, blessed Waterloo!"

487,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"Enfashioned wreathes of green festoon,"
488,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"Where through the long, long afternoon"
489,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,No ray of summer's sultry shine
490,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,E'er kissed the rustic grape-vine swing:
491,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,High up the purpling muscadine
492,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"Clung close to where the waters poured,"
493,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,And he saw the glint of the redbird's wing
494,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"In the crystal wave of the mossy spring,"
495,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,As she stooped for the Old Drinking Gourd.
496,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,
497,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,The odor tint of elder bloom
498,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,The zephyrs wafted through the spray

500,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"Caught in the geometric loom,"
501,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,Arachne plies with subtle hand:
502,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,"A pigeon bathed his snowy plume,"
503,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,A fading speck the vulture soared;
504,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,And a tide swept in across the sand
505,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,As they stood on the brink of the golden strand
506,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,And drank from the Old Drinking Gourd.

514,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,And liquid music softer blows
515,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,Than Hymen's mellow golden chime:
516,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,They plighted troth beneath the sword
517,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,Of the knight that wore the blood red rose;
518,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,But they drank of the cup that never flows
519,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,From the bowl of the Old Drinking Gourd.
520,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,
521,THE OLD DRINKING GOURD,Now sunset spills his scarlet dyes

1538,NATURA,A dream of beauty thy enchanting love
1539,NATURA,"On hill or stream or sheltered cove,"
1540,NATURA,Or on the open leas
1541,NATURA,
1542,NATURA,"Has not supplied; and thou, sweet maid,"
1543,NATURA,"Dost never weary, but from day to day,"
1544,NATURA,"And season unto season, every shade"
1545,NATURA,In sky or cloud is new inlaid
1546,NATURA,With colors soft or gay.
1547,NATURA,
1548,NATURA,Yon mountain late enrobed in snow
1549,NATURA,Thou clothest now in dress of shimmering green;
1550,NATURA,Ere long another garb wilt thou bestow
1551,NATURA,"Upon her, lest thy lover grow"
1552,NATURA,Aweary of the scene.
1553,NATURA,
1554,NATURA,And when the sheen of summer sky
1555,NATURA,"Shall fade into October's sombre gray,"
1556,NATURA,"And Autumn's gayest flowers a-withered lie,"
1557,NATURA,For me yon mountain thou will tie
1558,NATURA,Into a rare bouquet.

1567,HER EYES,In those vast depths of infinite blue

1569,HER EYES,As ever haunted a poet's ken.
1570,HER EYES,This sordid earth's my lot;

1584,THE ROSE OF LOVE,THE ROSE OF LOVE
1585,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1586,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1587,THE ROSE OF LOVE,The flowers closed their autumn bloom
1588,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"Awhile the bleak winds blew,"
1589,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And meekly bowing to their doom
1590,THE ROSE OF LOVE,They lay in shroud of frozen gloom
1591,THE ROSE OF LOVE,The whole long winter through.
1592,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1593,THE ROSE OF LOVE,There's ever been the same sad tale
1594,THE ROSE OF LOVE,To tell of Nature's loves;
1595,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Her artful methods never fail
1596,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"To win the hearts they once assail,"
1597,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Though she inconstant proves.
1598,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1599,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Last spring I heard the whisperings low
1600,THE ROSE OF LOVE,To modest Daffodil
1601,THE ROSE OF LOVE,That won her smile ere yet the snow
1602,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Had melted and begun its flow
1603,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Adown the little rill.
1604,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1605,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And soon her soft caresses proved
1606,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Too much for Meadow Rue;
1607,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And next Anemone was moved;
1608,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Spring Beauty whom the nymphs had loved
1609,THE ROSE OF LOVE,In shady woods to woo.
1610,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1611,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"But some less trustful, still were slow"
1612,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"To yield their loves' perfume,"
1613,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"Till, melted by the summer's glow,"
1614,THE ROSE OF LOVE,They let their pent-up passions flow
1615,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Through many colored bloom.
1616,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1617,THE ROSE OF LOVE,But Nature soon withdrew her smile;
1618,THE ROSE OF LOVE,I saw their petals pale
1619,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"And droop, now conscious of the guile"
1620,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Their fickle lover used the while
1621,THE ROSE OF LOVE,She wooed them in the vale.
1622,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1623,THE ROSE OF LOVE,*       *       *       *       *
1624,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1625,THE ROSE OF LOVE,All winter I had breathed upon
1626,THE ROSE OF LOVE,The clos-ed bud of love;
1627,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"Its milk-white petals, one by one"
1628,THE ROSE OF LOVE,At last unfolded in the sun
1629,THE ROSE OF LOVE,My heart had longed to prove.
1630,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1631,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And when it reached its full broad blow
1632,THE ROSE OF LOVE,It shed a fragrance sweet
1633,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"From out its bosom lilied snow,--"
1634,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And incense that the gods I know
1635,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Had smiled with joy to greet.
1636,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1637,THE ROSE OF LOVE,*       *       *       *       *
1638,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1639,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And Nature now begins again
1640,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Her courtship with the flowers;
1641,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"She chants in groves her minstrel strain,"
1642,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"She smiles, and frowns, and weeps in rain"
1643,THE ROSE OF LOVE,Of gentle April showers.
1644,THE ROSE OF LOVE,
1645,THE ROSE OF LOVE,And while she tries with song of thrush
1646,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"Once more those hearts to move,"
1647,THE ROSE OF LOVE,"I've seen her oft relentless crush,--"
1648,THE ROSE OF LOVE,My bud still blooms forever fresh--
1649,THE ROSE OF LOVE,It is the _Rose_ of _Love_!
1650,THE ROSE OF LOVE,

1662,MY JEWELS,Hidden from all but the eyes of love.
1663,MY JEWELS,
1664,MY JEWELS,I watched him oft with a mother's heart
1665,MY JEWELS,As he played with his dear little toys;
1666,MY JEWELS,"But now he is gone, and I sit apart"
1667,MY JEWELS,And muse of those vanished joys;--
1668,MY JEWELS,"Dream of his eyes and his beautiful hair,"
1669,MY JEWELS,And thrill with the love of a sweet despair.
1670,MY JEWELS,
1671,MY JEWELS,The gaze of the vulgar world today
1672,MY JEWELS,Would only my jewels abuse;
1673,MY JEWELS,"And this is the reason I hid them away,--"
1674,MY JEWELS,The little Blue Dress and the Shoes:
1675,MY JEWELS,And I pray that in death my eyes may caress
1676,MY JEWELS,The dear little Shoes and the little Blue Dress.

1713,THE MOONSHINERS,THE MOONSHINERS
1714,THE MOONSHINERS,
1715,THE MOONSHINERS,
1716,THE MOONSHINERS,Where the trailing arbutus filled the cove
1717,THE MOONSHINERS,"With a perfume as sweet as the breath of love,"
1718,THE MOONSHINERS,And the mountain ivy's astral bloom
1719,THE MOONSHINERS,"Made radiant light of the darkest gloom,"
1720,THE MOONSHINERS,A maiden dwelt as stainless the while
1721,THE MOONSHINERS,As the baytree's bloom in the steep defile;
1722,THE MOONSHINERS,And she loved a youth with a heart as true
1723,THE MOONSHINERS,As ever has beaten for me or you.
1724,THE MOONSHINERS,
1725,THE MOONSHINERS,Soon summer passed and the autumn came
1726,THE MOONSHINERS,"With its goldenrod and its sumac flame,"
1727,THE MOONSHINERS,With its tinge of frost and its blood-red blush
1728,THE MOONSHINERS,That made every shrub a burning bush.
1729,THE MOONSHINERS,Then love became passion for maiden and youth;
1730,THE MOONSHINERS,All vision had vanished and life was now truth;
1731,THE MOONSHINERS,And they heard a voice in the flaming tree
1732,THE MOONSHINERS,Which told them that marriage was nature's decree.
1733,THE MOONSHINERS,
1734,THE MOONSHINERS,When the spring beauties came and winter had fled
1735,THE MOONSHINERS,Sue Winn and Josh Bell were happily wed;
1736,THE MOONSHINERS,And the cowslips that bloomed in the side of the glen
1737,THE MOONSHINERS,Were fragrant as roses in the gardens of men.
1738,THE MOONSHINERS,"Their home was a cabin, the mountain above"
1739,THE MOONSHINERS,"Was rugged and rough, and their fortune was love:"
1740,THE MOONSHINERS,But a cabin with love and vigor and health
1741,THE MOONSHINERS,Is better than sin and a palace of wealth.
1742,THE MOONSHINERS,
1743,THE MOONSHINERS,The seasons passed by and a few brief years
1744,THE MOONSHINERS,Brought bountiful crops to these mountaineers;
1745,THE MOONSHINERS,And their children that played round the great hollyhocks
1746,THE MOONSHINERS,Wore the sunniest curls and the cleanest of frocks;
1747,THE MOONSHINERS,And old-fashioned sunflowers smiled at their door
1748,THE MOONSHINERS,Midst beautiful pinks and pansies galore;
1749,THE MOONSHINERS,And the mountain redbirds flashed and flew
1750,THE MOONSHINERS,Around the rude cabin of Josh and Sue.
1751,THE MOONSHINERS,
1752,THE MOONSHINERS,"Ah, little you know, ye daughters of Jove,"
1753,THE MOONSHINERS,The sweetness of poverty wedded to love;
1754,THE MOONSHINERS,"Untrammeled by fashion, unsated by sin,"
1755,THE MOONSHINERS,With the feeling that life and the dewdrop are kin.
1756,THE MOONSHINERS,"Ah, little you know who dwell among men"
1757,THE MOONSHINERS,"The freedom and freshness of mountain and glen,"
1758,THE MOONSHINERS,Where the Diva of Nature gives her grand matinee
1759,THE MOONSHINERS,In the opera of Love from a rich elder spray!
1760,THE MOONSHINERS,
1761,THE MOONSHINERS,"Yet the earth holds few spots where the winds never blow,"
1762,THE MOONSHINERS,And summer's not followed by the bleak winter snow:
1763,THE MOONSHINERS,But the harvest will fail both the rich and the poor
1764,THE MOONSHINERS,"In the deep fertile valley, on the thin healthy moor,"
1765,THE MOONSHINERS,Thus Susan grew ill and Joshua found
1766,THE MOONSHINERS,"His corn crop was short, his wheat was unsound,"
1767,THE MOONSHINERS,That drouth and disease had stricken his home
1768,THE MOONSHINERS,With a hand that poverty couldn't overcome.
1769,THE MOONSHINERS,
1770,THE MOONSHINERS,"Ah, little you care who dwell high above"
1771,THE MOONSHINERS,For the hardships of poverty wedded to love;
1772,THE MOONSHINERS,"Whose awful temptations you never can know,"
1773,THE MOONSHINERS,When the unfeeling winds of adversity blow;
1774,THE MOONSHINERS,"When the loved one is lying all helpless abed,"
1775,THE MOONSHINERS,And children are crying and begging for bread.
1776,THE MOONSHINERS,"Yes, little you dream, ye rich sons of Jove"
1777,THE MOONSHINERS,Of the trials of love in a rough mountain cove.
1778,THE MOONSHINERS,
1779,THE MOONSHINERS,"Josh Bell battled bravely, and fought sin and wrong"
1780,THE MOONSHINERS,And the mighty temptation with a heart true and strong;
1781,THE MOONSHINERS,"But Susan grew weaker, till bright bloomed the rose"
1782,THE MOONSHINERS,That ever the blanched cheek of consumption shows.
1783,THE MOONSHINERS,"""I must save her,"" he cried, ""Oh, God, let the cost"
1784,THE MOONSHINERS,"Be my life; if she dies, I am lost, I am lost!"""
1785,THE MOONSHINERS,And Joshua Bell smote his breast with a blow
1786,THE MOONSHINERS,That only the frenzy of a lover can know.
1787,THE MOONSHINERS,At a deep hour of night when the hoot of the owl
1788,THE MOONSHINERS,"Made the dark glen as lonesome as haunt of a cowl,"
1789,THE MOONSHINERS,"Josh Bell left his cabin for a cave in the hill,"
1790,THE MOONSHINERS,And began the erection of a small mountain still.
1791,THE MOONSHINERS,"For weeks here he labored at midnight alone,"
1792,THE MOONSHINERS,With a firm resolution and a heart like a stone:
1793,THE MOONSHINERS,"Then his own golden corn he had gathered in sheaf,"
1794,THE MOONSHINERS,He now husked in darkness and stole like a thief.
1795,THE MOONSHINERS,
1796,THE MOONSHINERS,"Ah, Joshua Bell, the world does not know"
1797,THE MOONSHINERS,"The depth of thy grief, the weight of thy woe,--"
1798,THE MOONSHINERS,"The conflict of conscience and love in thy breast,"
1799,THE MOONSHINERS,The struggle of duty and shame unconfessed.
1800,THE MOONSHINERS,"Thy act is a crime in the eyes of the law,"
1801,THE MOONSHINERS,"No matter the motive, it weighs not a straw;"
1802,THE MOONSHINERS,No matter the liquid distilled be as dew
1803,THE MOONSHINERS,That drips from the stem and chalice of rue.
1804,THE MOONSHINERS,
1805,THE MOONSHINERS,But the comforts of life that lessen the pain
1806,THE MOONSHINERS,"Of those whom we love, ease conscience and brain;"
1807,THE MOONSHINERS,"And Josh half forgot the cave in the hill,"
1808,THE MOONSHINERS,"And the white sparkling liquor that flowed from the still,"
1809,THE MOONSHINERS,"When Sue smiled and said, ""By thy great sacrifice"
1810,THE MOONSHINERS,"Of unceasing toil and love without price,"
1811,THE MOONSHINERS,I am better to-day; with return of the spring
1812,THE MOONSHINERS,"We can labor together where the brown thrushes sing."""
1813,THE MOONSHINERS,
1814,THE MOONSHINERS,"Thus Josh kept his secret, and the daffodils came"
1815,THE MOONSHINERS,That bloom but for those unworthy of blame;
1816,THE MOONSHINERS,And Sue never knew that the gold and the gain
1817,THE MOONSHINERS,Was purchased with liquor distilled from their grain.
1818,THE MOONSHINERS,But the sleuth-hounds of law found the cave in the hill
1819,THE MOONSHINERS,At a late hour of night and raided the still;
1820,THE MOONSHINERS,"Then surrounded the cabin, and woke Josh and Sue"
1821,THE MOONSHINERS,"And demanded surrender of the moonshiners, too."
1822,THE MOONSHINERS,
1823,THE MOONSHINERS,"With Winchester rifle Josh leaped from his couch,"
1824,THE MOONSHINERS,"""I'll never surrender, nor cower, nor crouch"
1825,THE MOONSHINERS,"To cowardly villains that plunder the poor,"
1826,THE MOONSHINERS,"In the guise of the law; who crosses my door,"
1827,THE MOONSHINERS,Had best make his peace with the angels above;
1828,THE MOONSHINERS,"By my life I'll protect the darlings I love."""
1829,THE MOONSHINERS,"Like a lion at bay, the flash of his eye,"
1830,THE MOONSHINERS,Told the brave mountaineer would shield them or die.
1831,THE MOONSHINERS,
1832,THE MOONSHINERS,But the torch of the raiders lit a red flame that stung
1833,THE MOONSHINERS,"The stouted hearted Josh like a vile adder's tongue,"
1834,THE MOONSHINERS,Till he rushed from his cabin in madness and swore
1835,THE MOONSHINERS,He would save Sue and children or sleep nevermore.
1836,THE MOONSHINERS,"But a flash from a rifle sent a ball through his brain,"
1837,THE MOONSHINERS,And Joshua Bell never breathed once again.
1838,THE MOONSHINERS,And his loved ones perished in the flame and the smoke
1839,THE MOONSHINERS,Of his own little cabin he had hewn from the oak.
1840,THE MOONSHINERS,
1841,THE MOONSHINERS,When the morning has climbed up the high eastern hill
1842,THE MOONSHINERS,"And the sunlight is dancing on ripple of rill,"
1843,THE MOONSHINERS,The coroner summons a jury and feigns
1844,THE MOONSHINERS,An inquest of law o'er the ghastly remains.
1845,THE MOONSHINERS,The verdict is heard with whoop and hurrah:
1846,THE MOONSHINERS,"""These moonshiners died at the hands of the law;"
1847,THE MOONSHINERS,"Let all men beware,"" the coroner cried,"
1848,THE MOONSHINERS,"""The murder of outlaws is just homicide."""

1856,SILHOUETTES,The flickering carbon threw a stream

1858,SILHOUETTES,"Men and women everywhere were hurrying homeward,"
1859,SILHOUETTES,Shivering for the comfort that was gleaming
1860,SILHOUETTES,Through many a window from blazing hearths within.
1861,SILHOUETTES,The freezing rain was biting like an adder.
1862,SILHOUETTES,"Down the icy thoroughfare,"
1863,SILHOUETTES,"Muffled deep in furs and ulster,"
1864,SILHOUETTES,"Madly rushed the Wall-street banker,"
1865,SILHOUETTES,"Plunging through the storm and shadow,"
1866,SILHOUETTES,Impatient for the shelter of his mansion.
1867,SILHOUETTES,No wonder that he heeded not the darkling figure
1868,SILHOUETTES,Of a little homeless waif that crouched
1869,SILHOUETTES,Beneath the jutting frieze and cornice
1870,SILHOUETTES,Of a rich Corinthian window;--
1871,SILHOUETTES,"No wonder, for the night was bitter,"
1872,SILHOUETTES,And his mansion yet two blocks away!
1873,SILHOUETTES,No wonder either that the wanderer
1874,SILHOUETTES,"Neither saw nor heard the banker,"
1875,SILHOUETTES,"Though his tread was swift and heavy,"
1876,SILHOUETTES,For a mighty storm was raging!
1877,SILHOUETTES,Yet above the noise and howling
1878,SILHOUETTES,"Of the wind and rain and tempest,"
1879,SILHOUETTES,The outcast heard the shoeless footfall
1880,SILHOUETTES,"Of a little homeless brother,"
1881,SILHOUETTES,Lost amid the blinding shadows.
1882,SILHOUETTES,"And soon they slept, secure and thankful,"
1883,SILHOUETTES,"Though the maddening storm grew fiercer,--"
1884,SILHOUETTES,"Slept, but dreamed:"
1885,SILHOUETTES,The window rose a richer mansion
1886,SILHOUETTES,Than ever sheltered Wall-street banker--
1887,SILHOUETTES,"A castle wrought of childish fancy,"
1888,SILHOUETTES,More beauteous than the pen of romance
1889,SILHOUETTES,Has pictured of the days of chivalry.
1890,SILHOUETTES,"But their little dreaming childhood,"
1891,SILHOUETTES,Painted no baronial robber.
1892,SILHOUETTES,"Saw no haughty plumed tiara,"
1893,SILHOUETTES,Heard no clank in Norman donjon.
1894,SILHOUETTES,"In the palace, dream-constructed,"
1895,SILHOUETTES,Where the little waifs lay nestled
1896,SILHOUETTES,"In each other's arms fraternal,"
1897,SILHOUETTES,"Love had built a shining altar,"
1898,SILHOUETTES,"War had laid aside his armor,"
1899,SILHOUETTES,And the knights that there assembled

2044,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,
2045,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,Have you never heard the story of the good old country school
2046,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,With its rude split-bottomed benches and its ancient _dunce's stool_?
2047,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"Where Webster's Blue-back Speller was the only standard text,"
2048,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,And supplied the place of grammar that our late forefathers vexed;
2049,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"Where they never heard of Latin or the Greek subjunctive mode,"
2050,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,But sang their mult-plication like a patriotic ode?
2051,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,
2052,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"The Master, he was skinny, with a lean and hungry look;"
2053,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,And a countenance as placid as a frozen winter brook;
2054,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"His brow was broad and Grecian, and his eye was snell and keen,"
2055,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And his head was stuffed with knowledge of a dozen books, I ween;"
2056,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And they say his nose was Roman as the bill of any hawk,"
2057,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And his boys were all perfection, for they had to walk the chalk."
2058,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,
2059,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And yet I've often wondered if they really always walked,"
2060,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And sat upright like statues, and never laughed or talked,"
2061,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,For I've often heard my father say the model of the school
2062,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"Got licked at least three times a day as a pretty general rule,"
2063,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And lament the good old method, as a lost, forgotten art,"
2064,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,Of imparting knowledge in a way that made a fellow _smart_.
2065,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,
2066,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,I wish we had the secret now of making boys walk
2067,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,Instead of always watching for a chance to throw some chalk;
2068,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"But the art, I think, was buried with the Blue-back Spelling Book,"
2069,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"And the piercing eye of Skinny, that no mortal boy could brook;"
2070,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,'Twas buried with the benches and the ancient dunce's stool
2071,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,And the grease-glazed paper windows of the good old country school.
2072,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,
2073,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"It may be through psychology and molly-coddle stuff,"
2074,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"We often talk in institutes, we've lost the power to bluff;"
2075,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"Perhaps 'twas Pestalozzi, Froebel and John Herbart"
2076,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,Who robbed the wand of Skinny of its pedagogic art;
2077,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,"We'll not discuss philosophy, but we know about the chalk,"
2078,THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY,That no theoretic dream of man can make a boy walk.
