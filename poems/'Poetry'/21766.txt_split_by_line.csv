35,NOTE,"William Johnson published in 1858 a slender volume bound in green cloth,"
36,NOTE,"(Smith, Elder & Co.) which was entitled ""Ionica,"" and which comprised"
37,NOTE,forty-eight poems.
38,NOTE,
39,NOTE,In 1877 he printed privately a little paper-covered book (Cambridge
40,NOTE,"University Press), entitled ""Ionica II,"" containing twenty-five poems."
41,NOTE,This book is a rare bibliographical curiosity. It has neither titlepage
42,NOTE,nor index; it bears no author's name; and it is printed without
43,NOTE,"punctuation, on a theory of the author's, spaces being left, instead of"
44,NOTE,"stops, to indicate pauses."
45,NOTE,
46,NOTE,"In 1891 he published a book, ""Ionica"" (George Allen), which contained"
47,NOTE,"most of the contents of the two previous volumes, together with some"
48,NOTE,pieces not previously published--eighty-five poems in all.
49,NOTE,
50,NOTE,The present volume is a reprint of the 1891 volume; but it has been
51,NOTE,"thought well to include, in an appendix, certain of the poems which"
52,NOTE,"appeared in one or other of the first two issues, but were omitted from"
53,NOTE,"the 1891 issue, together with a little Greek lyric, with its English"
54,NOTE,"equivalent, from the ""Letters and Journals."""
55,NOTE,
56,NOTE,"The poems from page 1 to page 104, Desiderato to All that was possible,"
57,NOTE,"appeared in the 1858 volume, together with those on pages 211 to 216, To"
58,NOTE,"the Infallible, The Swimmer's Wish, and An Apology. The poems from page"
59,NOTE,"105 to page 162, Scheveningen Avenue to L'Oiseau Bleu, appeared in the"
60,NOTE,"1877 volume, together with those on pages 217 and 218, Notre Dame and"
61,NOTE,"In Honour of Matthew Prior. The remainder of the poems, from page 163"
62,NOTE,"to page 210, appeared in the 1891 volume for the first time. The dates"
63,NOTE,"subjoined to the poems are those which he himself added, and indicate"

70,INTRODUCTION,
71,INTRODUCTION,"WILLIAM CORY (Johnson) was born at Torrington in Devonshire, on January"
72,INTRODUCTION,"9, 1823. He was the son of Charles William Johnson, a merchant, who"
73,INTRODUCTION,"retired at the early age of thirty, with a modest competence, and"
74,INTRODUCTION,"married his cousin, Theresa Furse, of Halsdon, near Torrington, to whom"
75,INTRODUCTION,"he had long been attached. He lived a quiet, upright, peaceable life"
76,INTRODUCTION,"at Torrington, content with little, and discharging simple, kindly,"
77,INTRODUCTION,"neighbourly duties, alike removed from ambition and indolence. William"
78,INTRODUCTION,"Cory had always a deep love of his old home, a strong sense of local"
79,INTRODUCTION,"sanctities and tender associations. ""I hope you will always feel,"" his"
80,INTRODUCTION,"mother used to say, ""wherever you live, that Torrington belongs to"
81,INTRODUCTION,"you."" He said himself, in later years, ""I want to be a Devon man and a"
82,INTRODUCTION,"Torrington man."" His memory lingered over the vine-shaded verandah, the"
83,INTRODUCTION,"jessamine that grew by the balustrade of the steps, the broad-leaved"
84,INTRODUCTION,myrtle that covered the wall of the little yard.
85,INTRODUCTION,
86,INTRODUCTION,"The boy was elected on the foundation at Eton in 1832, little guessing"
87,INTRODUCTION,"that it was to be his home for forty years. He worked hard at school,"
88,INTRODUCTION,"became a first-rate classical scholar, winning the Newcastle Scholarship"
89,INTRODUCTION,"in 1841, and being elected Scholar of King's in 1842. He seems to have"
90,INTRODUCTION,"been a quiet, retiring boy, with few intimate friends, respected for"
91,INTRODUCTION,"his ability and his courtesy, living a self-contained, bookish life,"
92,INTRODUCTION,yet with a keen sense of school patriotism--though he had few pleasant
93,INTRODUCTION,memories of his boyhood.
94,INTRODUCTION,
95,INTRODUCTION,Honours came to him fast at Cambridge. He won the Chancellor's English
96,INTRODUCTION,"Medal with a poem on Plato in 1843, the Craven Scholarship in 1844. In"
97,INTRODUCTION,"those days Kingsmen did not enter for the Tripos, but received a degree,"
98,INTRODUCTION,"without examination, by ancient privilege. He succeeded to a Fellowship"
99,INTRODUCTION,"in 1845, and in the same year was appointed to a Mastership at Eton by"
100,INTRODUCTION,"Dr. Hawtrey. At Cambridge he seems to have read widely, to have thought"
101,INTRODUCTION,"much, and to have been interested in social questions. Till that time"
102,INTRODUCTION,"he had been an unreflecting Tory and a strong High Churchman, but he"
103,INTRODUCTION,"now adopted more Liberal principles, and for the rest of his life was a"
104,INTRODUCTION,"convinced Whig. The underlying principle of Whiggism, as he understood"
105,INTRODUCTION,"it, was a firm faith in human reason. Thus, in a letter of 1875, he"
106,INTRODUCTION,"represents the Whigs as saying to their adversaries, ""You are in a"
107,INTRODUCTION,"majority now: if I were an ultra-democrat or counter of noses, I"
108,INTRODUCTION,should submit to you as having a transcendental --sometimes called
109,INTRODUCTION,"divine--right; if I were a redcap, I should buy dynamite and blow you"
110,INTRODUCTION,"up; if I were a Tory, I should go to church or to bed; as it is, I go to"
111,INTRODUCTION,work to turn your majority into a minority. I shall do it by reasoning
112,INTRODUCTION,"and by attractive virtue."" He intended in his university days, and"
113,INTRODUCTION,"for some time after, to take Anglican Orders, though he had also some"
114,INTRODUCTION,thought of going to the Bar; but he accepted a Mastership with much
115,INTRODUCTION,"relief, with the hope, as he wrote in an early letter, ""that before my"
116,INTRODUCTION,"time is out, I may rejoice in having turned out of my pupil-room perhaps"
117,INTRODUCTION,"one brave soldier, or one wise historian, or one generous legislator, or"
118,INTRODUCTION,"one patient missionary."" The whole of his professional life, a period of"
119,INTRODUCTION,"twenty-seven years, was to be spent at Eton."
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,No one who knew William Cory will think it an exaggeration to say that
122,INTRODUCTION,his mind was probably one of the most vigorous and commanding minds
123,INTRODUCTION,"of the century. He had a mental equipment of the foremost order, great"
124,INTRODUCTION,"intellectual curiosity, immense vigour and many-sidedness, combined with"
125,INTRODUCTION,"a firm grasp of a subject, perfect clearness of thought, and absolute"
126,INTRODUCTION,lucidity of expression.
127,INTRODUCTION,
128,INTRODUCTION,He never lost sight of principles among a crowd of details; and though
129,INTRODUCTION,"he had a strong bias in certain directions, he had a just and catholic"
130,INTRODUCTION,appreciation even of facts which told against his case. Yet his
131,INTRODUCTION,knowledge was never dry or cold; it was full to the brim of deep
132,INTRODUCTION,sentiment and natural feeling.
133,INTRODUCTION,
134,INTRODUCTION,"He had a wide knowledge of history, of politics, both home and foreign,"
135,INTRODUCTION,"of political economy, of moral science. Indeed, he examined more than"
136,INTRODUCTION,once in the Moral Science Tripos at Cambridge.
137,INTRODUCTION,
138,INTRODUCTION,He had a thorough acquaintance with and a deep love of literature; and
139,INTRODUCTION,all this in spite of the fact that he lived a very laborious and wearing
140,INTRODUCTION,"life as a school-teacher, with impossibly large classes, and devoted"
141,INTRODUCTION,himself with whole-hearted enthusiasm to his profession. His knowledge
142,INTRODUCTION,"was, moreover, not mere erudition and patient accumulation. It was all"
143,INTRODUCTION,"ready for use, and at his fingers' ends. Moreover, he combined with"
144,INTRODUCTION,"this a quality, which is not generally found in combination with the"
145,INTRODUCTION,"highly-developed faculties of the doctrinaire, namely an intense and"
146,INTRODUCTION,"fervent emotion. He was a lover of political and social liberty,"
147,INTRODUCTION,a patriot to the marrow of his bones; he loved his country with a
148,INTRODUCTION,"passionate devotion, and worshipped the heroes of his native land,"
149,INTRODUCTION,"statesmen, soldiers, sailors, poets, with an ardent adoration; the glory"
150,INTRODUCTION,"and honour of England were the breath of his nostrils. Deeds of heroism,"
151,INTRODUCTION,"examples of high courage and noble self-sacrifice, were the memories"
152,INTRODUCTION,that thrilled his heart. As a man of fifty he wept over Lanfrey's
153,INTRODUCTION,account of Nelson's death; he felt our defeat at Majuba Hill like a keen
154,INTRODUCTION,personal humiliation; his letter on the subject is as the words of one
155,INTRODUCTION,mourning for his mother.
156,INTRODUCTION,
157,INTRODUCTION,"But his was not a mere poetical emotion, supplying him with"
158,INTRODUCTION,"highly-coloured rhetoric, or sentimental panegyric. He had a technical"
159,INTRODUCTION,"and minute acquaintance with the detailed movement of wars, the precise"
160,INTRODUCTION,"ships and regiments engaged, the personalities and characters of"
161,INTRODUCTION,"commanders and officers, the conduct of the rank and file."
162,INTRODUCTION,
163,INTRODUCTION,Many delightful stories remain in the memories of his friends and
164,INTRODUCTION,"hearers to attest this. His pupil-room at Eton, in what was formerly"
165,INTRODUCTION,"the old Christopher Inn, was close to the street, and the passage of the"
166,INTRODUCTION,"Guards through Eton, to and from their Windsor quarters, is an incident"
167,INTRODUCTION,of constant occurrence. When the stately military music was heard far
168,INTRODUCTION,"off, in gusty splendour, in the little town, or the fifes and drums of"
169,INTRODUCTION,"some detachment swept blithely past, he would throw down his pen and"
170,INTRODUCTION,"go down the little staircase to the road, the boys crowding round"
171,INTRODUCTION,"him. ""Brats, the British army!"" he would say, and stand, looking and"
172,INTRODUCTION,"listening, his eyes filled with gathering tears, and his heart full of"
173,INTRODUCTION,"proud memories, while the rhythmical beat of the footsteps went briskly"
174,INTRODUCTION,echoing by.
175,INTRODUCTION,
176,INTRODUCTION,"Again, he went down to Portsmouth to see a friend who was in command of"
177,INTRODUCTION,a man-of-war; he was rowed about among the hulks; the sailors in the gig
178,INTRODUCTION,"looked half contemptuously at the sturdy landsman, huddled in a cloak,"
179,INTRODUCTION,"hunched up in the stem-sheets, peering about through his spectacles. But"
180,INTRODUCTION,"contempt became first astonishment, and then bewildered admiration, when"
181,INTRODUCTION,"they found that he knew the position of every ship, and the engagements"
182,INTRODUCTION,in which each had fought.
183,INTRODUCTION,
184,INTRODUCTION,He was of course a man of strong preferences and prejudices; he thought
185,INTRODUCTION,"of statesmen and patriots, such as Pitt, Nelson, Castlereagh, Melbourne,"
186,INTRODUCTION,"and Wellington, with an almost personal affection. The one title to his"
187,INTRODUCTION,"vehement love was that a man should have served his country, striven to"
188,INTRODUCTION,"enhance her greatness, extended her empire, and safeguarded her liberty."
189,INTRODUCTION,
190,INTRODUCTION,It was the same with his feeling for authors. He loved Virgil as a
191,INTRODUCTION,friend; he almost worshipped Charlotte Brontë. He spoke of Tennyson
192,INTRODUCTION,"as ""the light and joy of my poor life."" In 1868 he saw Sir W. Scott's"
193,INTRODUCTION,"portrait in London, and wrote: ""Sir Walter Scott, shrewd yet wistful,"
194,INTRODUCTION,"boyish yet dry, looking as if he would ask and answer questions of the"
195,INTRODUCTION,"fairies--him I saw through a mist of weeping. He is my lost childhood,"
196,INTRODUCTION,"he is my first great friend. I long for him, and hate the death that"
197,INTRODUCTION,"parts us."""
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,"In literature, the first claim on his regard was that a writer should"
200,INTRODUCTION,"have looked on life with a high-hearted, generous gaze, should have"
201,INTRODUCTION,"cared intensely for humanity, should have hoped, loved, suffered, not"
202,INTRODUCTION,"in selfish isolation, but with eager affection. Thus he was not only a"
203,INTRODUCTION,"philosophical historian, nor a mere technical critic; he was for ever"
204,INTRODUCTION,dominated by an intense personal fervour. He cared little for the manner
205,INTRODUCTION,"of saying a thing, so long as the heart spoke out frankly and freely;"
206,INTRODUCTION,he strove to discern the energy of the soul in all men; he could forgive
207,INTRODUCTION,"everything except meanness, cowardice, egotism and conceit; there was no"
208,INTRODUCTION,fault of a generous and impulsive nature that he could not condone.
209,INTRODUCTION,
210,INTRODUCTION,Thus he was for many boys a deeply inspiring teacher; he had the art
211,INTRODUCTION,"of awakening enthusiasm, of investing all he touched with a mysterious"
212,INTRODUCTION,"charm, the charm of wide and accurate knowledge illuminated by feeling"
213,INTRODUCTION,and emotion. He rebuked ignorance in a way which communicated the desire
214,INTRODUCTION,to know. There are many men alive who trace the fruit and flower of
215,INTRODUCTION,their intellectual life to his generous and free-handed sowing. But
216,INTRODUCTION,in spite of the fact that the work of a teacher of boys was intensely
217,INTRODUCTION,"congenial to him, that he loved generous boyhood, and tender souls, and"
218,INTRODUCTION,"awakening minds with all his heart, he was not wholly in the right place"
219,INTRODUCTION,as an instructor of youth. With all his sympathy for what was weak and
220,INTRODUCTION,"immature, he was yet impatient of dullness, of stupidity, of caution;"
221,INTRODUCTION,"much that he said was too mature, too exalted for the cramped and"
222,INTRODUCTION,"limited minds of boyhood. He was sensitive to the charm of eager,"
223,INTRODUCTION,"high-spirited, and affectionate natures, but he had also the equable,"
224,INTRODUCTION,"just, paternal interest in boys which is an essential quality in a wise"
225,INTRODUCTION,schoolmaster. Yet he was apt to make favourites; and though he demanded
226,INTRODUCTION,"of his chosen pupils and friends a high intellectual zeal, though he"
227,INTRODUCTION,"was merciless to all sloppiness and lack of interest, yet he forfeited"
228,INTRODUCTION,"a wider influence by his reputation for partiality, and by an obvious"
229,INTRODUCTION,susceptibility to grace of manner and unaffected courtesy. Boys who
230,INTRODUCTION,"did not understand him, and whom he did not care to try to understand,"
231,INTRODUCTION,thought him simply fanciful and eccentric. It is perhaps to be regretted
232,INTRODUCTION,that unforeseen difficulties prevented his being elected Tutor of his
233,INTRODUCTION,"old College, and still more that in 1860 he was passed over in favour of"
234,INTRODUCTION,"Kingsley, when the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, submitted his name"
235,INTRODUCTION,to the Queen for the Professorship of Modern History at Cambridge. Four
236,INTRODUCTION,"men were suggested, of whom Blakesley and Venables refused the post. Sir"
237,INTRODUCTION,"Arthur Helps was set aside, and it would have been offered to Johnson,"
238,INTRODUCTION,if the Prince Consort had not suggested Kingsley. Yet Johnson would
239,INTRODUCTION,hardly have been in his right place as a teacher of young men. He would
240,INTRODUCTION,"have been, on the one hand, brought into contact with more vigorous and"
241,INTRODUCTION,"independent minds, capable of appreciating the force and width of"
242,INTRODUCTION,"his teaching, and of comprehending the quality and beauty of his"
243,INTRODUCTION,"enthusiasms. But, on the other hand, he was too impatient of any"
244,INTRODUCTION,"difference of opinion, and, though he loved equal talk, he hated"
245,INTRODUCTION,"argument. And after all, he did a great work at Eton; for nearly a"
246,INTRODUCTION,quarter of a century he sent out boys who cared eagerly and generously
247,INTRODUCTION,for the things of the mind.
248,INTRODUCTION,
249,INTRODUCTION,"A second attempt was made, in 1869, to get him appointed to the history"
250,INTRODUCTION,"professorship, but Seeley was considered to have a better claim. Writing"
251,INTRODUCTION,"to a friend on the subject, Johnson said: ""I am not learned. I don't"
252,INTRODUCTION,"care about history in the common meaning of the word."""
253,INTRODUCTION,
254,INTRODUCTION,It is astonishing to see in his Diaries the immense trouble he took to
255,INTRODUCTION,awaken interest among his pupils. He was for ever trying experiments;
256,INTRODUCTION,he would read a dozen books to enable him to give a little scientific
257,INTRODUCTION,"lecture, for he was one of the first to appreciate the educational value"
258,INTRODUCTION,"of science; he spent money on chemical apparatus, and tried to interest"
259,INTRODUCTION,the boys by simple demonstrations. His educational ideals can best
260,INTRODUCTION,"be seen in an essay full of poetical genius, on the education of the"
261,INTRODUCTION,"reasoning faculties, which he contributed to the ""Essays on a Liberal"
262,INTRODUCTION,"Education,"" edited in 1867 by F. W. Farrar. Any one who wishes to"
263,INTRODUCTION,"understand Johnson's point of view, should study this brilliant"
264,INTRODUCTION,"and beautiful discourse. It is not only wise and liberal, but it is"
265,INTRODUCTION,"intensely practical, besides containing a number of suggestive and"
266,INTRODUCTION,poetical thoughts.
267,INTRODUCTION,
268,INTRODUCTION,He loved his Eton life more and more every year. As with Eumelus of
269,INTRODUCTION,"Corinth, ""dear to his heart was the muse that has the simple lyre and"
270,INTRODUCTION,"the sandals of freedom."" He took refuge, as it became clear to him that"
271,INTRODUCTION,"his wider ambitions could not be realised, that he would not set the"
272,INTRODUCTION,"mark he might have set upon the age, in a ""proud unworldliness,"" in"
273,INTRODUCTION,"heightened and intensified emotion. He made many friendships. He taught,"
274,INTRODUCTION,"as the years went on, as well or better than ever; he took great delight"
275,INTRODUCTION,in the society of a few pupils and younger colleagues; but a shadow fell
276,INTRODUCTION,on him; he began to feel his strength unequal to the demands upon it;
277,INTRODUCTION,and he made a sudden resolution to retire from his Eton work.
278,INTRODUCTION,
279,INTRODUCTION,"He had taken some years before, as a house for his holidays, Halsdon, a"
280,INTRODUCTION,"country place near his native Torrington, which belonged to his brother,"
281,INTRODUCTION,"Archdeacon Wellington Furse of Westminster, who had changed his name"
282,INTRODUCTION,"from Johnson to Furse, on succeeding to the property of an uncle."
283,INTRODUCTION,"Here he retired, and strove to live an active and philosophical life,"
284,INTRODUCTION,"fighting bravely with regret, and feeling with sensitive sorrow the"
285,INTRODUCTION,"turning of the sweet page. He tried, too, to serve and help his simple"
286,INTRODUCTION,"country neighbours, as indeed he had desired to do even at Eton, by"
287,INTRODUCTION,"showing them many small, thoughtful, and unobtrusive kindnesses, just"
288,INTRODUCTION,"as his father had done. But he lived much, like all poetical natures, in"
289,INTRODUCTION,tender retrospect; and the ending of the bright days brought with it
290,INTRODUCTION,"a heartache that even nature, which he worshipped like a poet, was"
291,INTRODUCTION,"powerless to console. But he loved his woods and sloping fields, and the"
292,INTRODUCTION,clear river passing under its high banks through deep pools. It served
293,INTRODUCTION,"to remind him sadly of his beloved Thames, the green banks fringed with"
294,INTRODUCTION,"comfrey and loosestrife, the drooping willows, the cool smell of"
295,INTRODUCTION,the weedy weir; of glad hours of light-hearted enjoyment with his
296,INTRODUCTION,"boy-companions, full of blithe gaiety and laughter."
297,INTRODUCTION,
298,INTRODUCTION,"After a few years, he went out to Madeira, where he married a wife"
299,INTRODUCTION,"much younger than himself, Miss Rosa Caroline Guille, daughter of a"
300,INTRODUCTION,"Devonshire clergyman; and at Madeira his only son was born, whom he"
301,INTRODUCTION,"named Andrew, because it was a name never borne by a Pope, or, as he"
302,INTRODUCTION,"sometimes said, ""by a sneak."" He devoted himself at this time to the"
303,INTRODUCTION,"composition of two volumes of a ""Guide to Modern English History."" But"
304,INTRODUCTION,"his want of practice in historical writing is here revealed, though it"
305,INTRODUCTION,must be borne in mind that it was originally drawn up for the use of a
306,INTRODUCTION,"Japanese student. The book is full of acute perceptions, fine judgments,"
307,INTRODUCTION,"felicitous epigrams--but it is too allusive, too fantastic; neither has"
308,INTRODUCTION,it the balance and justice required for so serious and comprehensive a
309,INTRODUCTION,task. At the same time the learning it displays is extraordinary. It was
310,INTRODUCTION,"written almost without books of reference, and out of the recollections"
311,INTRODUCTION,"of a man of genius, who remembered all that he read, and considered"
312,INTRODUCTION,reading the newspaper to be one of the first duties of life.
313,INTRODUCTION,
314,INTRODUCTION,Cory's other writings are few. Two little educational books are worth
315,INTRODUCTION,"mentioning: a book of Latin prose exercises, called _Nuces_, the"
316,INTRODUCTION,"sentences of which are full of recondite allusions, curious humour, and"
317,INTRODUCTION,"epigrammatic expression; and a slender volume for teaching Latin lyrics,"
318,INTRODUCTION,"called _Lucretilis_, the exercises being literally translated from the"
319,INTRODUCTION,"Latin originals which he first composed. _Lucretilis_ is not only, as"
320,INTRODUCTION,"Munro said, the most Horatian verse ever written since Horace, but full"
321,INTRODUCTION,"of deep and pathetic poetry. Such a poem as No. xxvii., recording the"
322,INTRODUCTION,"abandoning of Hercules by the Argonauts, is intensely autobiographical."
323,INTRODUCTION,"He speaks, in a parable, of the life of Eton going on without him, and"
324,INTRODUCTION,of his faith in her great future:
325,INTRODUCTION,
326,INTRODUCTION,"""sed Argo"
327,INTRODUCTION,"Vela facit tamen, aureumque"
328,INTRODUCTION,
329,INTRODUCTION,"""Vellus petendum est. Tiphys ad hoc tenet"
330,INTRODUCTION,"Clavum magister; stat Telamon vigil,"
331,INTRODUCTION,"Stat Castor in prora, paratus"
332,INTRODUCTION,"Ferre maris salientis ictus."""
333,INTRODUCTION,
334,INTRODUCTION,"After some years in Madeira, he came back to England and settled in"
335,INTRODUCTION,Hampstead; his later days were clouded with anxieties and illness. But
336,INTRODUCTION,"he took great delight in the teaching of Greek to a class of girls, and"
337,INTRODUCTION,"his attitude of noble resignation, tender dignity, and resolute interest"
338,INTRODUCTION,in the growing history of his race and nation is deeply impressive. He
339,INTRODUCTION,"died in 1892, on June II, of a heart-complaint to which he had long been"
340,INTRODUCTION,subject.
341,INTRODUCTION,
342,INTRODUCTION,In person William Cory was short and sturdy; he was strong and vigorous;
343,INTRODUCTION,"he was like the leader whom Archilochus desired, ""one who is compact of"
344,INTRODUCTION,"frame, showing legs that bend outward, standing firm upon his feet, full"
345,INTRODUCTION,"of courage."" He had a vigorous, massive head, with aquiline nose,"
346,INTRODUCTION,"and mobile lips. He was extraordinarily near-sighted, and used strong"
347,INTRODUCTION,"glasses, holding his book close to his eyes. He was accustomed to bewail"
348,INTRODUCTION,"his limited vision, as hiding from him much natural beauty, much human"
349,INTRODUCTION,drama; but he observed more closely than many men of greater clearness
350,INTRODUCTION,"of sight, making the most of his limited resources. He depended much"
351,INTRODUCTION,"upon a hearing which was preternaturally acute and sensitive, and was"
352,INTRODUCTION,"guided as much by the voice and manner, as by the aspect of those among"
353,INTRODUCTION,"whom he lived. He had a brisk, peremptory mode of address, full"
354,INTRODUCTION,of humorous mannerisms of speech. He spoke and taught crisply and
355,INTRODUCTION,"decisively, and uttered fine and feeling thoughts with a telling"
356,INTRODUCTION,"brevity. He had strong common sense, and much practical judgment."
357,INTRODUCTION,
358,INTRODUCTION,"He was intensely loyal both to institutions and friends, but never"
359,INTRODUCTION,"spared trenchant and luminous criticisms, and had a keen eye for"
360,INTRODUCTION,"weakness in any shape. He was formidable in a sense, though truly"
361,INTRODUCTION,"lovable; he had neither time nor inclination to make enemies, and had a"
362,INTRODUCTION,"generous perception of nobility of character, and of enthusiasms however"
363,INTRODUCTION,dissimilar to his own. He hankered often for the wider world; he would
364,INTRODUCTION,"have liked to have a hand in politics, and to have helped to make"
365,INTRODUCTION,history. He often desired to play a larger part; but the very stirrings
366,INTRODUCTION,of regret only made him throw himself with intensified energy into the
367,INTRODUCTION,"work of his life. He lived habitually on a higher plane than others,"
368,INTRODUCTION,"among the memories of great events, with a consciousness of high"
369,INTRODUCTION,"impersonal forces, great issues, big affairs; and yet he held on with"
370,INTRODUCTION,both hands to life; he loved all that was tender and beautiful. He never
371,INTRODUCTION,lost himself in ambitious dreams or abstract speculations. He was a
372,INTRODUCTION,"psychologist rather than a philosopher, and his interest and zest"
373,INTRODUCTION,"in life, in the relationships of simple people, the intermingling of"
374,INTRODUCTION,"personal emotions and happy comradeships, kept him from ever forming"
375,INTRODUCTION,cynical or merely spectatorial views of humanity. He would have been far
376,INTRODUCTION,"happier, indeed, if he could have practised a greater detachment; but,"
377,INTRODUCTION,"as it was, he gathered in, like the old warrior, a hundred spears; like"
378,INTRODUCTION,Shelley he might have said--

381,INTRODUCTION,
382,INTRODUCTION,"His is thus a unique personality, in its blending of intense mental"
383,INTRODUCTION,energy with almost passionate emotions. Few natures can stand the strain
384,INTRODUCTION,of the excessive development of even a single faculty; and with William
385,INTRODUCTION,Cory the qualities of both heart and head were over-developed. There
386,INTRODUCTION,"resulted a want of balance, of moral force; he was impetuous where he"
387,INTRODUCTION,"should have been calm, impulsive where he should have been discreet."
388,INTRODUCTION,But on the other hand he was possessed of an almost Spartan courage;
389,INTRODUCTION,"and through sorrow and suffering, through disappointment and failure,"
390,INTRODUCTION,"he bore himself with a high and stately tenderness, without a touch of"
391,INTRODUCTION,acrimony or peevishness. He never questioned the love or justice of God;
392,INTRODUCTION,"he never raged against fate, or railed at circumstance. He gathered up"
393,INTRODUCTION,the fragments with a quiet hand; he never betrayed envy or jealousy; he
394,INTRODUCTION,never deplored the fact that he had not realised his own possibilities;
395,INTRODUCTION,"he suffered silently, he endured patiently."
396,INTRODUCTION,
397,INTRODUCTION,"And thus he is a deeply pathetic figure, because his great gifts and"
398,INTRODUCTION,high qualities never had full scope. He might have been a great
399,INTRODUCTION,"jurist, a great lawyer, a great professor, a great writer, a great"
400,INTRODUCTION,"administrator; and he ended as a man of erratic genius, as a teacher in"
401,INTRODUCTION,"a restricted sphere, though sowing, generously and prodigally, rich and"
402,INTRODUCTION,"fruitful seed. With great poetical force of conception, and a style"
403,INTRODUCTION,"both resonant and suggestive, he left a single essay of high genius, a"
404,INTRODUCTION,"fantastic historical work, a few books of school exercises. A privately"
405,INTRODUCTION,printed volume of Letters and Journals reveals the extraordinary quality
406,INTRODUCTION,"of his mind, its delicacy, its beauty, its wistfulness, its charm. There"
407,INTRODUCTION,"remains but the little volume of verse which is here presented, which"
408,INTRODUCTION,stands apart from the poetical literature of the age. We see in these
409,INTRODUCTION,poems a singular and original contribution to the poetry of the century.
410,INTRODUCTION,"The verse is in its general characteristics of the school of Tennyson,"
411,INTRODUCTION,"with its equable progression, its honied epithets, its soft cadences,"
412,INTRODUCTION,"its gentle melody. But the poems are deeply original, because they,"
413,INTRODUCTION,"combine a peculiar classical quality, with a frank delight in the spirit"
414,INTRODUCTION,"of generous boyhood. For all their wealth of idealised sentiment, they"
415,INTRODUCTION,never lose sight of the fuller life of the world that waits beyond the
416,INTRODUCTION,"threshold of youth, the wider issues, the glory of the battle, the hopes"
417,INTRODUCTION,"of the patriot, the generous visions of manhood. They are full of the"
418,INTRODUCTION,"romance of boyish friendships, the echoes of the river and the cricket"
419,INTRODUCTION,"field, the ingenuous ambitions, the chivalry, the courage of youth and"
420,INTRODUCTION,"health, the brilliant charm of the opening world. These things are but"
421,INTRODUCTION,"the prelude to, the presage of, the energies of the larger stage; his"
422,INTRODUCTION,"young heroes are to learn the lessons of patriotism, of manliness, of"
423,INTRODUCTION,"activity, of generosity, that they may display them in a wider field."
424,INTRODUCTION,"Thus he wrote in ""A Retrospect of School Life"":--"
425,INTRODUCTION,
426,INTRODUCTION,"""Much lost I; something stayed behind,"
427,INTRODUCTION,"A snatch, maybe, of ancient song."
428,INTRODUCTION,"Some breathings of a deathless mind,"
429,INTRODUCTION,"Some love of truth, some hate of wrong."
430,INTRODUCTION,
431,INTRODUCTION,"And to myself in games I said,"
432,INTRODUCTION,'What mean the books? can I win fame
433,INTRODUCTION,"I would be like the faithful dead,"
434,INTRODUCTION,"A fearless man, and pure of blame.'"""
435,INTRODUCTION,
436,INTRODUCTION,"Then, too, there are poems of a sombre yet tender philosophy, of an"
437,INTRODUCTION,"Epicureanism that is seldom languid, of a Stoicism that is never hard."
438,INTRODUCTION,"In this world, where so much is dark, he seems to say, we must all clasp"
439,INTRODUCTION,"hands and move forwards, shoulder to shoulder, never forgetting the"
440,INTRODUCTION,warm companionship in the presence of the blind chaotic forces that wave
441,INTRODUCTION,"their shadowy wings about us. We must love what is near and dear, we"
442,INTRODUCTION,must be courageous and tender-hearted in the difficult valley. The book
443,INTRODUCTION,is full of the passionate sadness of one who feels alike the intensity
444,INTRODUCTION,"and the brevity of life, and who cannot conjecture why fair things must"
445,INTRODUCTION,fade as surely as they bloom.
446,INTRODUCTION,
447,INTRODUCTION,The poems then reflect a kind of Platonic agnosticism; they offer no
448,INTRODUCTION,solution of the formless mystery; but they seem rather to indicate the
449,INTRODUCTION,"hope that, in the multiplying of human relationship, in devotion to all"
450,INTRODUCTION,"we hold dear, in the enkindling of the soul by all that is generous and"
451,INTRODUCTION,"noble and unselfish, lies the best hope of the individual and of the"
452,INTRODUCTION,"race. Uncheered by Christian hopefulness, and yet strong in their belief"
453,INTRODUCTION,"in the ardours and passions of humanity, these poems may help us to"
454,INTRODUCTION,"remember and love the best of life, its days of sunshine and youth, its"
455,INTRODUCTION,"generous companionships, its sweet ties of loyalty and love, its brave"
456,INTRODUCTION,"hopes and ardent impulses, which may be ours, if we are only loving and"
457,INTRODUCTION,"generous and high-hearted, to the threshold of the dark, and perhaps"
458,INTRODUCTION,beyond.

1645,A BIRTHDAY,A troop then bound in slumber-charms;
1646,A BIRTHDAY,Such notes they gave the magic shell.

1659,A BIRTHDAY,"A sickly student at his books,"
1660,A BIRTHDAY,Who having basked in loving looks
1661,A BIRTHDAY,Was freezing into barren pride.
1662,A BIRTHDAY,
1663,A BIRTHDAY,"His squalid discontent they saw,"
1664,A BIRTHDAY,"And, for that he had worshipped them"
1665,A BIRTHDAY,"With incense and with anadem,"
1666,A BIRTHDAY,They willed his wintry world should thaw;
1667,A BIRTHDAY,
1668,A BIRTHDAY,And at thy cradle did decree

1681,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,And Hebe bloom on thine:
1682,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,Our sun with his encircling spheres
1683,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,Around the central sun careers;

1686,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,
1687,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,'Twere sweet for me to keep thee still
1688,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,Reclining halfway up the hill;
1689,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,"But time will not obey the will,"
1690,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,And onward thou must climb:
1691,A NEW YEAR'S DAY,"'Twere sweet to pause on this descent,"

1709,A CRUISE,
1710,A CRUISE,Your princely progress is begun;
1711,A CRUISE,And pillowed on the bounding deck
1712,A CRUISE,You break with dark brown hair a sun
1713,A CRUISE,That falls transfigured on your neck.
1714,A CRUISE,"Sail on, and charm sun, wind, and sea."
1715,A CRUISE,Oh! might that love-light rest on me!
1716,A CRUISE,
1717,A CRUISE,"Vacantly lingering with the hours,"
1718,A CRUISE,The sacred hours that still remain
1719,A CRUISE,From that rich month of fruits and flowers
1720,A CRUISE,"Which brought you near me once again,"
1721,A CRUISE,"By thoughts of you, though roses die,"
1722,A CRUISE,I strive to make it still July.
1723,A CRUISE,
1724,A CRUISE,"Soft waves are strown beneath your prow,"
1725,A CRUISE,Like carpets for a victor's feet;
1726,A CRUISE,"You call slow zephyrs to your brow,"
1727,A CRUISE,In listless luxury complete:
1728,A CRUISE,"Love, the true Halcyon, guides your ship;"
1729,A CRUISE,"Oh, might his pinion touch my lip!"
1730,A CRUISE,
1731,A CRUISE,I by the shrunken river stroll;
1732,A CRUISE,"And changed, since I was left alone,"
1733,A CRUISE,"With tangled weed and rising shoal,"
1734,A CRUISE,The loss I mourn he seems to own:
1735,A CRUISE,"This is, how base soe'er his sloth,"
1736,A CRUISE,This is the stream that bore us both.
1737,A CRUISE,
1738,A CRUISE,For you shall granite peaks uprise
1739,A CRUISE,"As old and scornful as your race,"
1740,A CRUISE,And fringed with firths of lucent dyes
1741,A CRUISE,The jewelled beach your limbs embrace.
1742,A CRUISE,"Oh bather, may those Western gems"
1743,A CRUISE,Remind you of my lilied Thames.
1744,A CRUISE,
1745,A CRUISE,"I too have seen the castled West,"
1746,A CRUISE,"Her Cornish creeks, her Breton ports,"
1747,A CRUISE,"Her caves by knees of hermits pressed,"
1748,A CRUISE,Her fairy islets bright with quartz:
1749,A CRUISE,"And dearer now each well-known scene,"
1750,A CRUISE,For what shall be than what hath been.
1751,A CRUISE,
1752,A CRUISE,"Obeisance of kind strangers' eyes,"
1753,A CRUISE,"Triumphant cannons' measured roar,"
1754,A CRUISE,"Doffed plumes, and martial courtesies,"
1755,A CRUISE,Shall greet you on the Norman shore.
1756,A CRUISE,"Oh, that I were a stranger too,"
1757,A CRUISE,To win that first sweet glance from you.
1758,A CRUISE,
1759,A CRUISE,I was a stranger once: and soon
1760,A CRUISE,"Beyond desire, above belief,"
1761,A CRUISE,"Thy soul was as a crescent moon,"
1762,A CRUISE,A bud expanding leaf by leaf.
1763,A CRUISE,"I'd pray thee now to close, to wane,"
1764,A CRUISE,So that 'twere all to do again.

1770,A SEPARATION,
1771,A SEPARATION,I may not touch the hand I saw
1772,A SEPARATION,So nimbly weave the violet chain;
1773,A SEPARATION,I may not see my artist draw
1774,A SEPARATION,That southward-sloping lawn again.
1775,A SEPARATION,"But joy brimmed over when we met,"
1776,A SEPARATION,Nor can I mourn our parting yet.
1777,A SEPARATION,
1778,A SEPARATION,"Though he lies sick and far away,"
1779,A SEPARATION,"I play with those that still are here,"
1780,A SEPARATION,"Not honouring him the less, for they"
1781,A SEPARATION,To me by loving him are dear:
1782,A SEPARATION,"They share, they soothe my fond regret,"
1783,A SEPARATION,Since neither they nor I forget.
1784,A SEPARATION,
1785,A SEPARATION,His sweet strong heart so nobly beat
1786,A SEPARATION,"With scorn and pity, mirth and zeal,"
1787,A SEPARATION,That vibrant hearts of ours repeat
1788,A SEPARATION,What they with him were wont to feel;
1789,A SEPARATION,"Still quiring in that higher key,"
1790,A SEPARATION,Till he take up the melody.
1791,A SEPARATION,
1792,A SEPARATION,"If there be any music here,"
1793,A SEPARATION,"I trust it will not fail, like notes"
1794,A SEPARATION,"Of May-birds, when the warning year"
1795,A SEPARATION,Abates their summer-wearied throats.
1796,A SEPARATION,"Shame on us, if we drudge once more"
1797,A SEPARATION,As dull and tuneless as before.
1798,A SEPARATION,
1799,A SEPARATION,"Without him I was weak and coarse,"
1800,A SEPARATION,"My soul went droning through the hours,"
1801,A SEPARATION,His goodness stirred a latent force
1802,A SEPARATION,That drew from others kindred powers.
1803,A SEPARATION,"Nor they nor I could think me base,"
1804,A SEPARATION,When with their prince I had found grace.
1805,A SEPARATION,
1806,A SEPARATION,"His influence crowns me, like a cloud"
1807,A SEPARATION,Steeped in the light of a lost sun:
1808,A SEPARATION,"I reign, for willing knees are bowed"
1809,A SEPARATION,And light behests are gladly done:
1810,A SEPARATION,"So Rome obeyed the lover-king,"
1811,A SEPARATION,Who drank at pure Egeria's spring.
1812,A SEPARATION,
1813,A SEPARATION,Such honour doth my mind perplex:
1814,A SEPARATION,"For, who is this, I ask, that dares"
1815,A SEPARATION,"With manhood's wounds, and virtue's wrecks,"
1816,A SEPARATION,"And tangled creeds, and subtle cares,"
1817,A SEPARATION,"Affront the look, or speak the name"
1818,A SEPARATION,Of one who from Elysium came.
1819,A SEPARATION,
1820,A SEPARATION,"And yet, though withered and forlorn,"
1821,A SEPARATION,"I had renounced what man desires,"
1822,A SEPARATION,I'd thought some poet might be born
1823,A SEPARATION,To string my lute with silver wires;
1824,A SEPARATION,At least in brighter days to come
1825,A SEPARATION,Such men as I would not lie dumb.
1826,A SEPARATION,
1827,A SEPARATION,I saw the Sibyl's finger rest
1828,A SEPARATION,"On fate's unturned imagined page,"
1829,A SEPARATION,"Believed her promise, and was blest"
1830,A SEPARATION,With dreams of that heroic age.
1831,A SEPARATION,"She sent me, ere my hope was cold,"
1832,A SEPARATION,One of the race that she foretold.
1833,A SEPARATION,
1834,A SEPARATION,"His fellows time will bring, and they,"
1835,A SEPARATION,"In manifold affections free,"
1836,A SEPARATION,Shall scatter pleasures day by day
1837,A SEPARATION,Like blossoms rained from windy tree.
1838,A SEPARATION,"So let that garden bloom; and I,"
1839,A SEPARATION,"Content with one such flower, will die."

1855,A NEW MICHONNET,
1856,A NEW MICHONNET,"It is her pride to see the hand,"
1857,A NEW MICHONNET,Which wont so wantonly to tear
1858,A NEW MICHONNET,"Her unblanched curls, control the band,"
1859,A NEW MICHONNET,"And change the tune, with such an air."
1860,A NEW MICHONNET,
1861,A NEW MICHONNET,"And who so good? she thinks, or who"
1862,A NEW MICHONNET,So fit for partners rich and tall?
1863,A NEW MICHONNET,"Indeed she's looked the ball-room through,"
1864,A NEW MICHONNET,And he's the loveliest lad of all.
1865,A NEW MICHONNET,
1866,A NEW MICHONNET,"So to her lonesome bed: and there,"
1867,A NEW MICHONNET,"If any wandering notes she hear,"
1868,A NEW MICHONNET,"She'll say in pauses of her prayer,"
1869,A NEW MICHONNET,"""He dancing still, my child! my dear!"""
1870,A NEW MICHONNET,
1871,A NEW MICHONNET,"His gladness doth on her redound,"

1873,A NEW MICHONNET,At every waif of broken sound

1877,A NEW MICHONNET,Through regions echoing thy name;
1878,A NEW MICHONNET,"And even on me, thy friend, shall flow"
1879,A NEW MICHONNET,Some streamlet from thy river of fame.
1880,A NEW MICHONNET,
1881,A NEW MICHONNET,Thou to the gilded youth be kind;
1882,A NEW MICHONNET,Shed all thy genius-rays on them;
1883,A NEW MICHONNET,An ancient comrade stands behind
1884,A NEW MICHONNET,"To touch, unseen, thy mantle's hem."
1885,A NEW MICHONNET,
1886,A NEW MICHONNET,"A stranger to thy peers am I,"

1892,A NEW MICHONNET,"From lips of happy lookers-on,"

1931,A FABLE,"Alone she lifts the latch, and glides"
1932,A FABLE,"Through many a sadly curtained room,"
