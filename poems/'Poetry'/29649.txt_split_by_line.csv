260,THE TREACHEROUS MERMAN,"one which appeared under the title _The Merman_ only, in the _Romantic"
261,THE TREACHEROUS MERMAN,Ballads_ of 1826.  The introduction of the incident of the changing by

412,THE STALWART MONK,The monks should have for fare.
413,THE STALWART MONK,
414,THE STALWART MONK,"The monk he out of the window looked,"
415,THE STALWART MONK,Then shook both beam and wall:
416,THE STALWART MONK,"""And be the Kemps no more than twelve,"
417,THE STALWART MONK,"I'll easily tame them all."""
418,THE STALWART MONK,
419,THE STALWART MONK,The monk he called to his serving lad:
420,THE STALWART MONK,"""My club go fetch me in,"
421,THE STALWART MONK,For I will out to the forest straight
422,THE STALWART MONK,"And make them cease their din."""
423,THE STALWART MONK,
424,THE STALWART MONK,"It took fifteen to bring the club,"
425,THE STALWART MONK,And they strain'd all their might;
426,THE STALWART MONK,The monk took it up with fingers two
427,THE STALWART MONK,And swung it round so light.
428,THE STALWART MONK,
429,THE STALWART MONK,He takes the club upon his back
430,THE STALWART MONK,"And into the wood he's gone,"
431,THE STALWART MONK,And there met him the Kempions twelve
432,THE STALWART MONK,Would fain set him upon.
433,THE STALWART MONK,
434,THE STALWART MONK,"They drew a circle on the ground,"
435,THE STALWART MONK,And each one troll'd a song;
436,THE STALWART MONK,I tell to ye for verity
437,THE STALWART MONK,He silenced them all ere long.
438,THE STALWART MONK,
439,THE STALWART MONK,"First slew he four, then slew he five,"
440,THE STALWART MONK,At length he all has slain;
441,THE STALWART MONK,It was the monk of the shaven crown
442,THE STALWART MONK,Would gladly fight again.
443,THE STALWART MONK,
444,THE STALWART MONK,It was the monk of the shaven crown
445,THE STALWART MONK,"Would seek for another fray,"
446,THE STALWART MONK,So out of the wood across the wold
447,THE STALWART MONK,He blythely took his way.
448,THE STALWART MONK,
449,THE STALWART MONK,So blythely out of the good green wood
450,THE STALWART MONK,"He sped across the hill,"
451,THE STALWART MONK,And there met him a hoary Trold
452,THE STALWART MONK,Whose name was Sivord Gill.
453,THE STALWART MONK,
454,THE STALWART MONK,"""If thou art the monk of the shaven crown"
455,THE STALWART MONK,"Who scath'd the warrior band,"
456,THE STALWART MONK,Thou either from me shalt shamefully flee
457,THE STALWART MONK,"Or manfully 'gainst me stand."""
458,THE STALWART MONK,
459,THE STALWART MONK,"""I am the monk of the shaven crown"
460,THE STALWART MONK,"Who slew the warrior band,"
461,THE STALWART MONK,And never from thee will I shamefully flee
462,THE STALWART MONK,"But like a man will stand."""
463,THE STALWART MONK,
464,THE STALWART MONK,"The first blow gave the Trold, it fell"
465,THE STALWART MONK,"Upon the monk's shoulder down,"
466,THE STALWART MONK,"'Midst of his shoulder broke the skin,"
467,THE STALWART MONK,Bebloodied was his gown.
468,THE STALWART MONK,
469,THE STALWART MONK,"The next blow gave the monk, it struck"
470,THE STALWART MONK,The Trold to the verdant sward:
471,THE STALWART MONK,"""Now shame befall thee, shaven Monk,"
472,THE STALWART MONK,The blows of thy club are hard.
473,THE STALWART MONK,
474,THE STALWART MONK,"""Now hold thy hand, thou shaven Monk,"
475,THE STALWART MONK,"And do not strike me more,"
476,THE STALWART MONK,"And I will give thee silver and gold,"
477,THE STALWART MONK,"And of coin a plenteous store."""
478,THE STALWART MONK,
479,THE STALWART MONK,"The Monk he ran, the Trold he crept,"
480,THE STALWART MONK,Still equal was their height;
481,THE STALWART MONK,Then shewed he him a little house
482,THE STALWART MONK,With doors of gold so bright.
483,THE STALWART MONK,
484,THE STALWART MONK,Then shewed he him a little house
485,THE STALWART MONK,With golden doors fifteen;
486,THE STALWART MONK,There got the Monk of silver and gold
487,THE STALWART MONK,All he could wish I ween.
488,THE STALWART MONK,
489,THE STALWART MONK,"Seven lasts of silver, seven of gold,"
490,THE STALWART MONK,To the cloisters he caus'd convey;
491,THE STALWART MONK,He bade them find a monk could wield
492,THE STALWART MONK,A club in as brave a way.
493,THE STALWART MONK,
494,THE STALWART MONK,'Twas drawing fast to an evening hour
495,THE STALWART MONK,"And the sun went down to rest,"
496,THE STALWART MONK,Still fifteen Roman miles the monk
497,THE STALWART MONK,To the cloister had at least.
498,THE STALWART MONK,
499,THE STALWART MONK,'Twas tending fast to the evening tide
500,THE STALWART MONK,"And the sun to the earth did haste,"
501,THE STALWART MONK,Yet he seized the first dish at the supper board
502,THE STALWART MONK,Ere the Abbot could get a taste.
503,THE STALWART MONK,
504,THE STALWART MONK,Full fifteen monks he knock'd down when
505,THE STALWART MONK,"No pottage he espied,"
506,THE STALWART MONK,And up he hung fifteen because
507,THE STALWART MONK,The herrings were not fried.
508,THE STALWART MONK,
509,THE STALWART MONK,Then out and spoke the little boy
510,THE STALWART MONK,Who waited at the meal:
511,THE STALWART MONK,"""Each time the monk to the cloister comes"
512,THE STALWART MONK,"He thus with us will deal."""
513,THE STALWART MONK,
514,THE STALWART MONK,And it was getting late at night
515,THE STALWART MONK,"And folks to bed should hie,"
516,THE STALWART MONK,Then because the Abbot sat too long
517,THE STALWART MONK,He struck him out an eye.
518,THE STALWART MONK,
519,THE STALWART MONK,"The Abbot hurried off to bed,"
520,THE STALWART MONK,No longer dared remain;
521,THE STALWART MONK,I say to ye for verity
522,THE STALWART MONK,He felt both shame and pain.
523,THE STALWART MONK,
524,THE STALWART MONK,"'Twas early in the morning tide,"
525,THE STALWART MONK,The bells began to ring;
526,THE STALWART MONK,It was the monk of the shaven crown
527,THE STALWART MONK,Would neither read nor sing.
528,THE STALWART MONK,
529,THE STALWART MONK,So stately strode he up the choir
530,THE STALWART MONK,"Where the monks and nuns they stand,"
531,THE STALWART MONK,Not one of them dared read or sing
532,THE STALWART MONK,For fear of his stalwart hand.
533,THE STALWART MONK,
534,THE STALWART MONK,So they the Abbot pious and good
535,THE STALWART MONK,"To a simple monk debased,"
536,THE STALWART MONK,And they the Monk of the shaven crown
537,THE STALWART MONK,As Abbot o'er them placed.
538,THE STALWART MONK,
539,THE STALWART MONK,And he the cloister held with might
540,THE STALWART MONK,Till thirty years were flown;
541,THE STALWART MONK,"Then died as Abbot in mighty fame,"
542,THE STALWART MONK,The Monk of the shaven crown.

549,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
550,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"My father up of the country rode,"
551,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,He thought to wed a lovely rose;
552,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"And there he met a laidly wife,"
553,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,The source was she of all my woes.
554,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
555,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,The first night they together slept
556,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"She seemed to me a mother mild,"
557,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,But ere a second night was past
558,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,She prov'd a step-dame fierce and wild.
559,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
560,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"I sat beside my father's board,"
561,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"I sported there with hound and pup,"
562,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And then to blast my blissful lot
563,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,My step-dame wild came striding up.
564,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
565,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,That God should make my lot so blest
566,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,My wicked step-dame could not bear;
567,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"She changed me to a sword so keen,"
568,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And bade me far and wide to fare.
569,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
570,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"By day I grac'd the side of the knight,"
571,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,I hung the hero's heart so near;
572,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"At night I lay beneath his head,"
573,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,For his good sword he loved so dear.
574,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
575,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,That God had made my lot so blest
576,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,My wicked step-dame could not bear;
577,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"She changed me to a little knife,"
578,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And bade me far and wide to fare.
579,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
580,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"By day I was in the Lady's hand,"
581,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,The linen white with me she cut;
582,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"At night within her bower I slept,"
583,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,All in her golden casket put.
584,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
585,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"That God had made my lot so blest,"
586,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,My wicked step-dame could not bear;
587,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"She changed me to a little hind,"
588,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And bade me wander far and near.
589,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
590,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"She changed me to a little hind,"
591,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And bade me wander far and near;
592,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"My seven maids to wolves she changed,"
593,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And fiercely urged them me to tear.
594,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
595,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"My seven maidens were so kind,"
596,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,They all refus'd the hind to tear;
597,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Then vexed was my step-mother wild
598,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,That God had made my lot so fair.
599,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
600,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"The young Sir Henrik serves at court,"
601,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,He is a knight of handsome mien;
602,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"For me he sorrowed day and night,"
603,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,But would not let his grief be seen.
604,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
605,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Sir Henrik roves with bow in hand
606,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,The good green wood at morning tide;
607,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"Then up there came a little hind,"
608,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And fondly she the warrior eyed.
609,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
610,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Then up there came a little hind
611,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Before the young knight as he rang'd;
612,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"Then off she cast her bestial shape,"
613,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,And to a lovely damsel changed.
614,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
615,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"He took her tenderly in his arm,"
616,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,He called her oft his bosom's dear:
617,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"""Thrice praised be God in heav'n that dwells"
618,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,That I have found my damsel here.
619,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
620,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"""I have not any servant, love,"
621,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"Nor hast thou any maid, my fair,"
622,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"So we'll pull down the linden leaves,"
623,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"And thus our bridal bed prepare."""
624,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
625,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"It was then the damsel fair,"
626,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Within the bed herself she placed;
627,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,It was the brave Sir Henrik then
628,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,Sweet sank to sleep by her embraced.
629,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,
630,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"Full sorely wept the damsel fair,"
631,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,As sleep began his eyes to find;
632,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,"Assuming then her bestial shape,"
633,THE CRUEL STEP-DAME,She went away--a hapless hind.
