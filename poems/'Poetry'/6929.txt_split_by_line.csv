871,ELEGY V.,How oft she cries--Ah Phoebus! why repair
872,ELEGY V.,"Thy wasted force, why seek refreshment there?"

3082,VI.1,1 It has ever been thought difficult for an author to speak
3083,VI.1,"gracefully of himself, especially in commendation; but Milton,"
3084,VI.1,"who was gifted with powers to overcome difficulties, of every"
3085,VI.1,"kind, is eminently happy in this particular. He has spoken"
3086,VI.1,"frequently of himself both in verse and prose, and he continually"
3087,VI.1,shows that he thought highly of his own endowments; but if he
3088,VI.1,"praises himself, he does it with that dignified frankness and"
3089,VI.1,"simplicity of conscious truth, which renders even egotism"
3090,VI.1,respectable and delightful: whether he describes the fervent and
3091,VI.1,"tender emotions of his juvenile fancy, or delineates his situation"
3092,VI.1,"in the decline of life, when he had to struggle with calamity"
3093,VI.1,"and peril, the more insight he affords us into his own sentiments"
3094,VI.1,"and feelings, the more reason we find both to love, and revere"
3095,VI.1,him.--W.C.

3179,VI.1,
3180,VI.1,"Though I had determined, my excellent tutor, to write you an"
3181,VI.1,"epistle in verse, yet I could not satisfy myself without"
3182,VI.1,"sending also another in prose, for the emotions of my"
3183,VI.1,"gratitude, which your services so justly inspire, are too"
3184,VI.1,expansive and too warm to be expressed in the confined limits
3185,VI.1,of poetical metre; they demand the unconstrained freedom of
3186,VI.1,"prose, or rather the exuberant richness of Asiatic"
3187,VI.1,phraseology: thought it would far exceed my power accurately
3188,VI.1,"to describe how much I am obliged to you, even if I could"
3189,VI.1,"drain dry all the sources of eloquence, or exhaust all the"
3190,VI.1,topics of discourse which Aristotle or the famed Parisian
3191,VI.1,logician has collected. You complain with truth that my
3192,VI.1,letters have been very few and very short; but I do not
3193,VI.1,"grieve at the omission of so pleasurable a duty, so much as I"
3194,VI.1,rejoice at having such a place in your regard as makes you
3195,VI.1,anxious often to hear from me. I beseech you not to take it
3196,VI.1,"amiss, that I have not now written to you for more than three"
3197,VI.1,years; but with you usual benignity to impute it rather to
3198,VI.1,circumstances than to inclination. For Heaven knows that I
3199,VI.1,"regard you as a parent, that I have always treated you with"
3200,VI.1,"the utmost respect, and that I was unwilling to tease you"
3201,VI.1,with my compositions. And I was anxious that if my letters
3202,VI.1,"had nothing else to recommend them, they might be recommended"
3203,VI.1,"by their rarity. And lastly, since the ardour of my regard"
3204,VI.1,"makes me imagine that you are always present, that I hear"
3205,VI.1,your voice and contemplate your looks; and as thus... I charm
3206,VI.1,"away my grief by the illusion of your presence, I was afraid"
3207,VI.1,when I wrote to you the idea of your distant separation
3208,VI.1,should forcibly rush upon my mind; and that the pain of your
3209,VI.1,"absence, which was almost soothed into quiescence, should"
3210,VI.1,revive and disperse the pleasurable dream. I long since
3211,VI.1,received your desirable present of the Hebrew Bible. I wrote
3212,VI.1,"this at my lodgings in the city, not, as usual, surrounded by"
3213,VI.1,"my books. If, therefore, there be anything in this letter"
3214,VI.1,"which either fails to give pleasure, or which frustrates"
3215,VI.1,"expectation, it shall be compensated by a more elaborate"
3216,VI.1,composition as soon as I return to the dwelling of the muses.1

3250,II.,"Of a strange speech to wake new flower and blade,"
3251,II.,"While I of thee, in scorn so debonair,"

3290,IV.,A mien where high-souled modesty I hail;
3291,IV.,Eyes softly splendent with a darkness dear;
3292,IV.,A speech that more than one tongue vassal hath;   10
