11,,________________________________________________________________________
12,,"This quite short book contains eight sections, of which the last three"
13,,"are collections of verse written by Kingston, including one collection"
14,,"of verse written when he was still at school.  Not bad, either."
15,,
16,,"Of the other five sections, three are nautical short stories by"
17,,"Kingston, while the other two are excellent stories by lady-writers, not"
18,,all that usual at the date of publication.  Of these we would
19,,"particularly commend ""An Adventure on the Black Mountain"", by Frances"
20,,"Wilbraham.  The Black Mountain is Montenegro, a Balkan country, and this"
21,,is the first time your reviewer has been offered any insight into that
22,,"country.  Well worth reading--a must, in fact, in the light of recent"
23,,"events (Chapter Four, in the book)."
24,,
25,,"The dates of the stories are roughly the end of the eighteenth century,"
26,,"but, though dated, they are nevertheless interesting to read or listen"
27,,to.

67,II.,II.
68,II.,
69,II.,"There are different tribes.  Some are called Crees, others Ojibways or"
70,II.,"Salteaux, and these are constantly at war with the Sioux to the south,"
71,II.,chiefly found across the United States boundary.  There are also found
72,II.,"on the prairies Assiniboines, Blackfeet, Bloodies, and others with"
73,II.,scarcely more attractive names.  All these people were at that time sunk
74,II.,"in the most abject state of heathenism, and were constantly at war with"
75,II.,"each other.  They were clothed chiefly in skins made into leather,"
76,II.,ornamented with feathers and stained grass and beads.  The tents of the
77,II.,"prairie Indians were of skins, and those of the Indians who inhabit the"
78,II.,"woods of birch bark.  Many had rifles, but others were armed only with"
79,II.,"bows and spears, and the dreadful scalping-knife.  Of these people the"
80,II.,"Sioux bore the worst character, and were the great enemies of the"
81,II.,"half-bred population of the settlements.  These halfbreds, as they are"
82,II.,"called, are descended from white fathers and Indian mothers.  There are"
83,II.,"some thousands of them in the settlements, and they live chiefly by"
84,II.,"hunting and fishing, and retain many Indian customs and habits of life."
85,II.,Such was the strangely mixed community among whom we found ourselves.
86,II.,
87,II.,"The autumn was coming on, and the days were shortening, but the weather"
88,II.,"was very fine--sharp frosts at night, though warm enough, yet bracing,"
89,II.,with a bright sky and pure atmosphere during the day.  Sometimes a light
90,II.,silvery mist or haze hung over the landscape.  Such is the Indian
91,II.,"summer, the most delightful period of the year in North America."
92,II.,
93,II.,"The day's work was over, and while my brother and I were preparing the"
94,II.,"table, and Sam Dawes was cooking the supper, we were startled by a loud"
95,II.,"and peculiar shout, or rather shriek.  Our father, who had been sitting"
96,II.,"reading, started up, and taking his rifle from the wall, turned to the"
97,II.,"door.  Sam, quitting his frying-pan, also took down his rifle and"
98,II.,followed with us.  In the distance was an Indian decked with war paint
99,II.,"and feathers bounding over the ground towards us, while further off were"
100,II.,"five or six more, as if in hot pursuit of the first."
101,II.,
102,II.,"""That first fellow is an Ojibway by his adornments, and a young man by"
103,II.,"the way he runs,"" observed Sam.  ""He's seeking protection here, that's"
104,II.,"poz."""
105,II.,
106,II.,"""And he shall enjoy it, though we should have to fight for him,"""
107,II.,"observed my father warmly.  ""We must teach the Red men that we always"
108,II.,"protect those in distress."""
109,II.,
110,II.,The fugitive came on at great speed.  He was flying for his life.  His
111,II.,"pursuers, however, were gaining on him.  They had fire-arms in their"
112,II.,"hands, but did not use them."
113,II.,
114,II.,"""They have exhausted their powder,"" observed my father.  ""That is"
115,II.,"fortunate."""
116,II.,
117,II.,The young Indian was within fifty yards of us.  We could see the gleam
118,II.,"of the scalping knives which his foes had drawn, thirsting for his"
119,II.,blood.  He bounded on up to the door of the hut and fell exhausted
120,II.,within.  Then for the first time his pursuers perceived that we stood
121,II.,armed at the entrance.  Guessing truly that we possessed plenty of
122,II.,"ammunition, and two or more of their number might fall if they attempted"
123,II.,"to advance, they paused, casting glances of disappointed vengeance"
124,II.,"towards their victim, who lay unconscious behind us.  Our father told"
125,II.,"Malcolm and me to take him in and to try and revive him.  We did so, and"
126,II.,when we had moistened his lips with water he quickly revived.  Springing
127,II.,up he seized Malcolm's gun and hurried to the door.  The other Indians
128,II.,"had not moved.  On seeing him, however, they instantly darted behind"
129,II.,"some trunks of trees for shelter, and then we saw them darting away till"
130,II.,they got beyond range of our fire-arms.  The young Indian would have
131,II.,"followed, but my father restrained him, and gave him to understand that"
132,II.,though he had saved his life he had no intention of allowing him to take
133,II.,"the lives of others.  Darkness was coming on, and we soon lost sight of"
134,II.,"the band.  Having closed our door with more than usual care, we placed"
135,II.,"food before our guest, of which he eagerly partook, and then told us"
136,II.,that his name was Sigenok; that he with others of his tribe had been out
137,II.,"hunting, and had been surprised by a war party of Sioux, who had taken"
138,II.,the scalps of all the rest.  He had wandered away unarmed from the camp
139,II.,"when he saw all his companions killed.  To revenge them, which the"
140,II.,"Indian thought was his first duty, was then impossible, so he took to"
141,II.,"flight, hoping to retaliate on another occasion.  His wary foes,"
142,II.,"however, discovered his trail and followed.  He had caught sight of them"
143,II.,"when they were not aware of it, and redoubled his speed, making for the"
144,II.,settlements.  He gave us to understand that he could not have continued
145,II.,"his flight many more hours, and that he was very grateful to us for"
146,II.,"preserving his life.  We had brought a dog from England, and we had"
147,II.,"lately got another, both very sagacious animals, and so we stationed"
148,II.,them outside the hut at a little distance to give us due notice should
149,II.,the Sioux return.
150,II.,
151,II.,"Sigenok, as soon as he had satisfied his hunger, proving his confidence"
152,II.,"in us, laid himself down in a corner of the room and was immediately"
153,II.,"fast asleep.  He spent two days with, us to recover his strength, which"
154,II.,"had been greatly tried, and then set off to carry to his tribe the sad"
155,II.,"tidings of the loss of their friends.  For an Indian, he was a"
156,II.,"good-looking young man, and decked with his war paint and feathers he"
157,II.,had a picturesquely savage appearance.
158,II.,
159,III.,III.
160,III.,
161,III.,The winter came--we did not feel the cold so much as we expected--it
162,III.,passed on and spring approached.  We were looking forward to the
163,III.,pleasures of summer and to a buffalo hunt which we had promised
164,III.,"ourselves, when, after finding the heat unusually great at night, on"
165,III.,"rising in the morning, loud cracks in the ice were heard, and we"
166,III.,discovered that a thaw had commenced.  We were surprised at the rapidity
167,III.,"with which the snow melted, and the low shrubs and the green grass"
168,III.,"appeared, and long dormant Nature seemed to be waking up to life."
169,III.,
170,III.,"""How jolly,"" exclaimed Malcolm; ""we shall soon be able to paddle about"
171,III.,in our canoe; we may as well have look at her to see that she is in
172,III.,"order."""
173,III.,
174,III.,We had a supply of gum with which to cover up the seams as the Indians
175,III.,"do, and our canoe was soon fit for launching."
176,III.,
177,III.,"""We must look to the plough and our spades,"" remarked our father; ""we"
178,III.,"shall speedily be able to get in our seeds."""
179,III.,
180,III.,Perhaps Sam Dawes thought more of his fishing lines and nets and guns.
181,III.,
182,III.,The next day an Indian coming up from the lake told us that there was an
183,III.,"extraordinary accumulation of ice at the mouth of the river, which had"
184,III.,"begun to swell, with an impetuous torrent, carrying vast masses along"
185,III.,"with it.  Speedily it rose higher and higher, the waters came up the"
186,III.,bank and then filled the narrow gully which usually discharged water
187,III.,"into it after rain, but now carried its waters backward into the plain."
188,III.,
189,III.,"""It will soon subside,"" observed our father.  ""That current will soon"
190,III.,"carry away the barriers at the month.""  So we all went as usual to bed."
191,III.,
192,III.,The next morning when we looked out we were on an island.  The water
193,III.,covered our field and the greater part of the garden round the house.
194,III.,Between us and the house of the nearest settler to the south was one
195,III.,"sheet of water, while to the north not an habitation was visible.  We"
196,III.,made out at the distance of a mile our neighbour and his family crossing
197,III.,"in a large boat to the hills on the east.  ""We may possibly have to"
198,III.,"follow his example,"" observed our father; ""but I hope that the waters"
199,III.,"may decrease before that becomes necessary."""
200,III.,
201,III.,The sheep and cows were now collecting of their own accord in the
202,III.,"garden, and we had to drive up the pigs, whose stye was threatened with"
203,III.,submersion.  The scene was truly one of desolation as we looked beyond
204,III.,"our own homestead; trunks of trees and palings, and now and then a"
205,III.,"haystack, and barns, and parts of houses, and occasionally whole"
206,III.,"dwellings came floating by, showing what ravages the flood must have"
207,III.,committed above us.  Malcolm and I agreed that it was fortunate we had
208,III.,"repaired our canoe.  As the waters extended, the current in the river"
209,III.,"was less strong.  Our father observed this.  ""My sons,"" he said,"
210,III.,"""freight your canoe with the tent and some provisions, and take this"
211,III.,"case of books, and go off to the hills.  Should the waters increase"
212,III.,return for Sam and me; we must remain to look after the cattle.  Mounted
213,III.,on our horses we shall be able to drive them to yonder rising ground on
214,III.,"the south-west."""
215,III.,
216,III.,"He pointed to a slight elevation, between which and us he considered"
217,III.,that the water was not more than one foot and a-half deep.  Accustomed
218,III.,"to obey without question, Malcolm and I, having loaded our canoe with as"
219,III.,"many valuables as she could possibly carry, prepared to cross to the"
220,III.,"eastern hills, hoping that our father and Sam would start at once with"
221,III.,the cattle towards the more remote but seemingly more accessible ground
222,III.,to the west.  Just as we were shoving off he remarked--
223,III.,
224,III.,"""The water has not risen lately; we may still avoid a remove.  Heaven"
225,III.,"prosper you, my dear boys."""
226,III.,
227,III.,"We hoped that his words would prove true--the sky was bright, the water"
228,III.,"smooth, and it was difficult to believe that there was any danger."
229,III.,"Malcolm and I were expert with the use of the paddle, but in crossing"
230,III.,"the river we were swept down some way, and narrowly escaped staving in"
231,III.,the canoe against stumps of trees or palings and remnants of buildings.
232,III.,"We persevered, however, and at length reached the eastern hills, or the"
233,III.,mountains as they were called.  Here we found our neighbour and several
234,III.,other families encamped.  He told us that he had driven his cattle off
235,III.,"on the first day, and wished that we had done the same.  The waters did"
236,III.,"not appear to be rising, though we looked with anxiety towards our home;"
237,III.,but it was too small a speck to be visible among the wide expanse of
238,III.,waters at the distance we were from it.  We had put up our tent and were
239,III.,"intending to occupy it, when we recollected that there were several of"
240,III.,"the other settlers' wives and daughters without so good a covering, so"
241,III.,"we went and begged them to occupy it, while we slept under our canoe."
242,III.,
243,III.,"The night was bright and starlight, but we could not sleep much for"
244,III.,thinking of our father and Sam Dawes.  We resolved as early as we could
245,III.,see in the morning to go back to them.  We were awoke early in the
246,III.,morning by a peculiar murmuring and hollow sound.  As soon as it was
247,III.,daylight we looked out over the flooded country.  We asked others if
248,III.,"they had heard the noise.  They replied that they had, and that it was"
249,III.,"caused by the water rushing over the land.  ""Then the flood must have"
250,III.,"increased,"" exclaimed Malcolm and I with anxiety."
251,III.,
252,III.,"""No doubt about it, boys,"" was the unsatisfactory reply."
253,III.,
254,III.,"We were for starting off immediately, but one of the farmer's wives, to"
255,III.,"whom we had given up our tent, insisted on preparing some breakfast for"
256,III.,"us, and in putting a supply of food into our canoe."
257,III.,
258,III.,"""It is a long voyage, my boys, and you do not know what you may require"
259,III.,"before you return,"" she observed."
260,III.,
261,III.,We paddled on very anxiously.  We had only the line of eastern hills we
262,III.,"were leaving and some high land to the south to guide us, but we thought"
263,III.,that we could not help hitting upon the spot where our abode stood.  For
264,III.,"a long way we paddled on easily enough, only taking care not to run"
265,III.,"against stumps of trees, and as we got nearer the settlement, stakes or"
266,III.,ruined buildings were our chief danger.  Too many evidences met us on
267,III.,either side that the water had increased considerably since the previous
268,III.,"day.  In vain our eyes ranged around, in no direction was our cottage"
269,III.,visible.  We must have mistaken the locality.  The current was here very
270,III.,"strong, we thought that we might have drifted down further than we had"
271,III.,"calculated on doing.  We went further west, and then steered south,"
272,III.,"where the current was less strong.  After going some way, Malcolm"
273,III.,"stopped paddling suddenly, and exclaimed--"
274,III.,
275,III.,"""Look, Harry! look there!  Do you know that tree?"""
276,III.,
277,III.,"""Its head is very like one that grows close to the house,"" I answered."
278,III.,
279,III.,We had both mechanically turned the head of the canoe in the direction
280,III.,in which he pointed.  We had been engaged in fastening a flag-staff to
281,III.,the tree near our house.  A minute would decide whether this was it.
282,III.,"Our hearts sank within us, our paddles almost dropped from our hands,"
283,III.,when we perceived among the bare branches the rope and the pole which we
284,III.,had been about to erect.  Where was our cottage? where our kind father
285,III.,"and the faithful Sam?  Not a vestige of the cottage remained, it had too"
286,III.,evidently been carried away by the flood.
287,III.,
288,III.,"""Had they been able to escape with the cattle?"" was the question we"
289,III.,asked each other.  We hoped they might; but still it was too possible
290,III.,"that our father would have persisted in remaining in the house, as a"
291,III.,"sailor will by his ship, to the last, and Sam, we knew, would never have"
292,III.,deserted him.  We could just distinguish the heads of some strong
293,III.,"palings above the water, marking the position of our cottage.  We made"
294,III.,"fast to the tree for a few minutes to rest and recover ourselves, and to"
295,III.,consider what course to pursue.  We naturally turned our eyes towards
296,III.,"the rising ground in the south-west, to which our father intended to"
297,III.,"drive the cattle.  It seemed a long, long way off, still we determined"
298,III.,to attempt to reach it.  We felt thankful that the farmer's wife had
299,III.,"supplied us with provisions, though we were too anxious just then to be"
300,III.,"hungry.  We left the tree and paddled on, but it was very hard work, for"
301,III.,there was a current against us setting towards Lake Winnipeg; but the
302,III.,"canoe was light, and as there was no wind we managed to stem it."
303,III.,"Hitherto the sky had been bright, and there had been a perfect calm, but"
304,III.,as we paddled on we saw clouds rising above the high ground for which we
305,III.,"were steering.  They rose, and rose, and then rushed across the sky with"
306,III.,"fearful rapidity, and the water ahead of us, hitherto bright and clear,"
307,III.,"seemed turned into a mass of foam, which came sweeping up towards us."
308,III.,
309,III.,"""We cannot face it,"" exclaimed Malcolm.  ""Quick, quick, about with the"
310,III.,"canoe, we must run before it."""
311,III.,
312,III.,"We were hardly in time.  The blast very nearly upset the canoe, and we"
313,III.,"had to throw our whole weight over on the side the wind struck her, to"
314,III.,"prevent this, as she spun round like a top, and away we flew before it."
315,III.,"All we could do was to keep the canoe before the wind, and to steer her"
316,III.,"clear of logs of wood or stumps of trees, against which she might have"
317,III.,been cast and knocked to pieces.
318,III.,
319,III.,"""But where are we going?"" we asked ourselves.  ""If we continue thus, we"
320,III.,"may be driven into Lake Winnipeg, and hurled among the masses of ice"
321,III.,"which are dashing about on its waters."""
322,III.,
323,III.,We thought still more about our father and Sam.  How disappointed they
324,III.,"would be, should they have reached the dry land when the storm came on,"
325,III.,"and they knew that we could not get to them.  But our attention, I must"
326,III.,"own, was soon concentrated on our own situation.  The rain fell in"
327,III.,"torrents, sufficient of itself almost to swamp our light canoe, while"
328,III.,"the thunder roared and the lightning darted from the sky, filling my"
329,III.,"heart, at all events, with terror.  I felt both awe-struck and alarmed,"
330,III.,and could scarcely recover myself sufficiently to help Malcolm.  He was
331,III.,"far less moved, and continued guiding the canoe with his former"
332,III.,calmness.  At last I could not help crying out--
333,III.,
334,III.,"""Oh, Malcolm, how is it that you cannot see our danger?"""
335,III.,
336,III.,"""I do, Harry, clearly,"" he answered gravely; ""but we are in the"
337,III.,"performance of our duty, and God will take care of us."""
338,III.,
339,III.,His words and tone made an impression on me which I have never
340,III.,"forgotten.  When dangers have surrounded me, I have asked myself, ""Am I"
341,III.,"engaged in the performance of my duty? then why need I fear, God will"
342,III.,"protect me.  He always has protected me.""  The grandest receipt for"
343,III.,"enabling a person to be truly brave, is that he must ever walk on in the"
344,III.,strict line of duty.
345,III.,
346,III.,"We were driving northward at a fearful rate, for the rapidity of the"
347,III.,current was greatly increased by the wind.  We wished that we could get
348,III.,"back to our oak tree, as we might make fast to its branches, but it was"
349,III.,nowhere visible.  To have paddled against the gale would have only
350,III.,exhausted our strength to no purpose.  As Malcolm found that he could
351,III.,"guide the canoe without me, he told me to bail out the water.  As I"
352,III.,"turned round to do so, I shouted with joy, for I thought I saw a large"
353,III.,"boat under full sail coming down towards us.  On it came, much faster"
354,III.,"than we were driving; but as it drew near, it looked less and less like"
355,III.,"a boat, till to my bitter disappointment I discovered that it was a"
356,III.,large haystack which had been floated bodily away.  At length just
357,III.,"before us appeared a clump of trees, and we, hoped that the ground on"
358,III.,which they stood might be out of water.  Malcolm steered towards the
359,III.,spot.  We might remain there till the storm was over.  The trees bent
360,III.,"with the wind, and it appeared as if they could not possibly stand.  We"
361,III.,approached the spot perhaps with less caution than we had before
362,III.,"employed.  Suddenly the canoe spun round, a large rent appeared in her"
363,III.,"bows, over she went, and we were thrown struggling into the water."
364,III.,"Before we could regain the canoe she had floated far away, and not"
365,III.,without a severe struggle did we succeed in reaching the land.  We
366,III.,"climbed up by some bushes, and found ourselves on the summit of a little"
367,III.,"knoll rising out of the water, and not comprising more than fifty square"
368,III.,yards.  Our first impulse was to look out to see what had become of our
369,III.,"canoe, and we stood watching it with a bewildered gaze as it floated"
370,III.,away half filled with water.  It was not till it had disappeared in the
371,III.,distance that we remembered it had contained all our provisions.  That
372,III.,"was bad enough, but we had never experienced hunger, and did not know"
373,III.,"how long we might exist without food.  What appeared then worse was,"
374,III.,"that the waters were rising round our island, and we might soon have no"
375,III.,"dry spot on which to rest our feet.  We might climb up into the trees,"
376,III.,"but we had seen other trees washed away, and such might be the fate of"
377,III.,"these our last refuge.  The day wore on, the storm ceased, and the"
378,III.,"weather again became calm and beautiful.  I now grew excessively hungry,"
379,III.,"and cried very much, and felt more wretched than I had ever done before."
380,III.,"Malcolm, who bore up wonderfully, tried to comfort me, and suggested"
381,III.,that we should hunt about foe roots or underground nuts such as we had
382,III.,"seen the Indians eat.  We fortunately had our pocket knives, and with"
383,III.,"these we dug in all directions, till we came upon some roots which"
384,III.,"looked tempting, but then we remembered that we had no means of kindling"
385,III.,"a fire to cook them, nor could we tell whether they were poisonous or"
386,III.,"not.  The hunt had given us occupation, and prevented us for a time from"
387,III.,dwelling on our misfortunes.
388,III.,
389,III.,"We then tried every device we could think of to kindle a fire, for we"
390,III.,"wished to dry our clothes, if we could not cook our roots.  None of our"
391,III.,"attempts succeeded, and Malcolm suggested that we should run round and"
392,III.,round our island to try and warm ourselves before night came on.  At
393,III.,"last I felt very sleepy, and so did Malcolm, but he said that he would"
394,III.,"let me sleep first while he watched, lest the waters should rise and"
395,III.,carry us away before we had time to climb up a tree.
396,III.,
397,III.,"I lay down and was asleep in a minute, and when I awoke the stars were"
398,III.,"shining out brightly through the branches of the trees, the young grass"
399,III.,"blades reflecting them on their shining surfaces, while I saw my good"
400,III.,brother still walking up and down keeping guard over me.  The noise of
401,III.,the rushing waters sounded in my ears and made me desire to go to sleep
402,III.,"again, but I aroused myself, ashamed that I had slept so long, and urged"
403,III.,my brother to lie down.
404,III.,
405,III.,"""No, Harry,"" he answered, ""I wished you to get as much rest as possible;"
406,III.,"but look there, we shall soon be obliged to climb a tree for refuge."""
407,III.,
408,III.,"Walking a few paces, I found that the water had greatly encroached on"
409,III.,"our island; a southerly wind had begun to blow, which sent large waves"
410,III.,rolling in on us.
411,III.,
412,III.,"""Should the wind increase, they will completely sweep over where we"
413,III.,"stand,"" I exclaimed.  ""Oh, Malcolm, what shall we do?"""
414,III.,
415,III.,"""Trust in God,"" he replied calmly.  ""From how many dangers has He not"
416,III.,"already preserved us.  But remember, our father has often told us that"
417,III.,"it is our business while praying to God for help, to exert ourselves,"
418,III.,and so let us at once try and find a tree we can climb quickly in case
419,III.,"of necessity, and whose boughs will afford us a resting-place."""
420,III.,
421,III.,"I loved Malcolm dearly.  I admired him now more than ever, and was ready"
422,III.,to do whatever he wished.  We soon found a tree up which we could help
423,III.,"each other.  The wind howled and whistled through the trees, the waves"
424,III.,"lashed the shore furiously, and Malcolm had just time to shove me up the"
425,III.,"tree, when one larger than the rest swept completely over the ground on"
426,III.,"which we had been standing, with a force sufficient to have carried us"
427,III.,"off with it.  We had seated ourselves among the branches, which waved to"
428,III.,"and fro in the wind, and as we looked down, we saw the water foaming"
429,III.,"round the trunk, and often it seemed as if it must be uprooted and sent"
430,III.,drifting down with the current.
431,III.,
432,III.,"Malcolm said that he felt very sleepy, and told me that if I would"
433,III.,"undertake to hold him on, he would rest for a few minutes.  I gladly"
434,III.,"promised that I would do as he wished, but asked him how he could think"
435,III.,of sleeping while the tempest was raging round us.
436,III.,
437,III.,"""Why, Harry, we are as safe up here as on the ground,"" he answered, in"
438,III.,"his usual sweet tone of voice, ""God is still watching over us!"""
439,III.,
440,III.,"I need scarcely say how tightly I held on to his clothes, trembling lest"
441,III.,"he should fall.  I felt no inclination to go to sleep, indeed I soon"
442,III.,"found that I must have slept the greater part of the night, for before"
443,III.,"Malcolm again opened his eyes, I observed the bright streaks of dawn"
444,III.,appearing over the distant hills in the east.  Daylight quickly came on.
445,III.,"It was again perfectly calm, and on looking down, we could see the"
446,III.,"blades of grass rising above the water.  Malcolm woke up, saying that he"
447,III.,"felt much better.  Looking down below us, he said that he thought the"
448,III.,"water had decreased since he went to sleep.  He might have been right, I"
449,III.,"could not tell.  At that moment there was only one thing I thought of,"
450,III.,"the pain I was suffering from hunger.  ""I shall die!  I shall die!""  I"
451,III.,exclaimed.  Malcolm cheered me up.
452,III.,
453,III.,"""Help will come though we cannot now see how,"" he observed; ""God will"
454,III.,"protect us.  Trust in Him."""
455,III.,
456,III.,Still I felt that I should die.  It is very difficult to sustain gnawing
457,III.,"hunger, such as I then felt for the first time.  I have no doubt that"
458,III.,"Malcolm felt the same, but he was too brave to show it.  Hour after hour"
459,III.,passed by; the water did not appear to be rising; the blades of grass
460,III.,were still seen below us round the tree.  I however felt that I could
461,III.,"not endure many more hours of suffering.  ""I must fall, indeed I must,"""
462,III.,"I cried out over and over again.  I should indeed have let go my hold,"
463,III.,had not my brave brother kept me up.  Even he at last showed signs of
464,III.,"giving way, and spoke less encouragingly than before.  He was silent for"
465,III.,"some time.  I saw him looking out eagerly, when he exclaimed--"
466,III.,
467,III.,"""Cheer up, Harry, there is a canoe approaching; it will bring us help."""
468,III.,
469,III.,I gazed in the direction towards which he pointed.  At first I could
470,III.,"only see a speck on the water.  It grew larger and more distinct, till I"
471,III.,could see that it was certainly a canoe.  Then we discovered that there
472,III.,"were two Indians in it.  We shouted, but our voices sounded shrill and"
473,III.,"weak.  The Indians heard us, for they waved their paddles and turned the"
474,III.,head of the canoe towards the clump of trees.  The canoe could not get
475,III.,"under the tree, but one of the Indians jumped out, and Malcolm told me"
476,III.,to slide down.  The Indian caught me and carried me in his arms to the
477,III.,"canoe, for I was too weak to walk.  Malcolm followed, and the Indian"
478,III.,helped him along also.  It was not till we had been placed in the canoe
479,III.,"that we recognised in our preserver the young Indian, Sigenok, whose"
480,III.,life we had saved.  We pronounced his name.  He gave a well-satisfied
481,III.,smile.
482,III.,
483,III.,"""Ah, you have not forgotten me, nor I you,"" he said in his own language."
484,III.,"""Favours conferred bind generous hearts together.  Sigenok guessed that"
485,III.,you were in distress.  Your elder brother has long been looking for
486,III.,"you."""
487,III.,
488,III.,It appeared that Sigenok had been at a distance hunting when the flood
489,III.,"commenced; that he had hastened back, and soon perceiving from the"
490,III.,"height the water had attained that our house was in danger, had embarked"
491,III.,"in his canoe and hastened toward it, but on his nearing the spot found"
492,III.,that it had been swept away.  Guessing that we had escaped to the
493,III.,"eastern hills, he paddled there, when our friends told him that we had"
494,III.,proceeded in search of our father and servant.  Having ascertained the
495,III.,"exact time of our departure, with the wonderful powers of calculation"
496,III.,"possessed by Red men, he had decided the events which had occurred and"
497,III.,"the course we had pursued, and was thus able to look for us in the right"
498,III.,"direction.  Had he not found us there, he would have visited other"
499,III.,"places which he mentioned, where we might have taken refuge.  As he was"
500,III.,leaving the hills the farmer's wife had given him a supply of food for
501,III.,"us, and on his producing it our hunger was soon satisfied.  We now told"
502,III.,him of our anxiety about our father and Sam Dawes.  He listened
503,III.,"attentively, and then shook his head."
504,III.,
505,III.,"""They and the cattle never reached the hills,"" he observed.  ""We will"
506,III.,search for them.  There are still some hours of daylight.  If the house
507,III.,"has held together, they will be found much further down than this."""
508,III.,
509,III.,I fancied by the Indian's manner that his hopes were slight.  We now
510,III.,shoved off from the little island which had afforded us so valuable a
511,III.,"refuge, and Sigenok and his companion paddled off at a rapid rate to the"
512,III.,"north.  Anxious as I was, I soon fell asleep, and so I believe did"
513,III.,Malcolm for a short time.  I was aroused by a shout from Sigenok.  I
514,III.,lifted up my head and saw a dark object in the distance rising above the
515,III.,water.
516,III.,
517,III.,"""It is our house!"" exclaimed Malcolm, ""Sigenok says so.  Oh, that our"
518,III.,"father may be there!"""
519,III.,
520,III.,We kept our eyes anxiously fixed on the distant object.  It was growing
521,III.,dusk.  Malcolm said that he saw something moving on it.
522,III.,
523,III.,"""Man there, alive!"" observed Sigenok."
524,III.,
525,III.,Our hopes were raised; but he spoke only of one man.  How long the time
526,III.,appeared occupied in reaching the spot!  Even through the gloom we could
527,III.,"now distinguish the outline of our log hut, which had grounded on a bank"
528,III.,"among some strong fences and brushwood, and was now fixed securely,"
529,III.,partly tilted over.
530,III.,
531,III.,"""Who is there? who is there?"" we shouted.  ""Father, father! we are"
532,III.,"Malcolm and Harry!"""
533,III.,
534,III.,"""Woe's me, young masters, your father is not here,"" said a voice which,"
535,III.,"hollow and husky as it was, we recognised as that of Sam Dawes.  We were"
536,III.,"soon up to our hut, to the roof of which Sam was clinging.  The Indians"
537,III.,"lifted him into the canoe, for he had scarcely strength to help himself."
538,III.,
539,III.,"""But our father, Sam! our father!"" we exclaimed.  ""Where is he? what has"
540,III.,"happened?"""
541,III.,
542,III.,"""He no speak till he eat,"" observed Sigenok, after he had secured the"
543,III.,canoe to the hut.
544,III.,
545,III.,"We took the hint, and gave him some food.  In a short time he revived,"
546,III.,"and told us that our father, after we went away, would not believe that"
547,III.,"the water would rise higher, and that they had retired to rest as usual,"
548,III.,when they were awoken by the sound of the water rushing round the house;
549,III.,"that they both ran out and mounted their horses to drive off the cattle,"
550,III.,"as had been arranged.  Our father took the lead, urging on before him"
551,III.,"the cows and horses, while he followed with the sheep, when his horse"
552,III.,"fell and he was thrown into a deep hole.  As he scrambled out, the"
553,III.,"current took him off his legs.  He was nearly drowned, but after"
554,III.,"floundering about for some time, he found himself carried up against the"
555,III.,hut.  He immediately climbed to the roof and shouted as loud as he could
556,III.,"in the hopes of recalling our father, but there was no answer.  Again"
557,III.,and again he shouted.  He tried to pierce the gloom which still hung
558,III.,"over the land, though it was nearly morning.  He felt a wish to leap off"
559,III.,"and try and follow his master, but what had become of his horse he could"
560,III.,not ascertain.  The waters were increasing round the cottage.  He felt
561,III.,"it shake violently, when, to his horror, it lifted and floated bodily"
562,III.,"away.  The logs had been put together in a peculiar manner, dove-tailed"
563,III.,"into each other, which accounted for this.  He told us how forlorn and"
564,III.,"miserable he felt, without another human being in sight, believing that"
565,III.,"his master was lost, uncertain as to our fate, and that he himself was"
566,III.,hurrying to destruction.  More than once he felt inclined to drop off
567,III.,"the roof, but love of life, or rather a sense of the wickedness of so"
568,III.,"doing, prevailed, and he clung on till the hut grounded where we found"
569,III.,it.
570,III.,
571,III.,We were now in as secure a place as any we could find in the
572,III.,"neighbourhood, and so Sigenok proposed seeking some necessary rest"
573,III.,before continuing our search.  We proposed going into the house to
574,III.,"sleep, but we found that our bed-places had been carried away, and so,"
575,III.,"of course, had every particle of furniture, as the bottom of the hut had"
576,III.,literally come out.  We therefore returned to the canoe to sleep.  At
577,III.,early dawn we once more paddled south.  There was little current and a
578,III.,"perfect calm.  The waters, too, were subsiding, for several slight"
579,III.,"elevations, before submerged, were now visible.  After paddling for many"
580,III.,"hours, we reached the south-western hills I have before described."
581,III.,"Several settlers were there, but no one had seen our father.  We crossed"
582,III.,back to the eastern hills before nightfall.  There were no tidings of
583,III.,"him there.  The flood subsided, and we, like others, set off to return"
584,III.,to the now desolate site of our former abode.  Sigenok conveyed us in
585,III.,"his canoe, and we pitched our tent on the very spot our hut had"
586,III.,"occupied.  In vain we searched for our father, in vain we made inquiries"
587,III.,"of other settlers, no one had seen him.  Day after day we waited,"
588,III.,thinking that he might have been swept downward with the flood clinging
589,III.,"to a piece of timber or some other floating body, and that he might as"
590,III.,yet be unable to return.  Sam Dawes looked more and more sad when we
591,III.,"spoke of his return.  Sigenok, who had remained by us, shook his head."
592,III.,"""He gone, no come back,"" he observed.  Our hearts sank within us as the"
593,III.,sad truth forced itself on our minds that we were orphans.
594,III.,
595,IV.,IV.
596,IV.,
597,IV.,"Long we continued to hope against hope.  Neither was our father's body,"
598,IV.,nor were any of the cattle he was driving off ever discovered.  The
599,IV.,current must have swept them down into Lake Winnipeg.
600,IV.,
601,IV.,"""I ain't much of a person for it, young masters,"" said Sam Dawes, taking"
602,IV.,"a hand of each of us and looking at us affectionately, ""but I loves ye"
603,IV.,"as sons, and I'll be in the place of a father, that I will."""
604,IV.,
605,IV.,Faithfully did Sam Dawes keep his word.
606,IV.,
607,IV.,"""Grief is right and does us good in the end, depend on't, or it wouldn't"
608,IV.,be sent; but it mustn't make us forget duty.  Now you see it is our duty
609,IV.,"to live, and we can't live without food, and we can't get food without"
610,IV.,"we work, so let's turn to and plough and sow the ground."""
611,IV.,
612,IV.,"This proposal may seem like mockery, but among the valuables placed by"
613,IV.,"our father in the canoe was a good supply of seed corn and other seeds,"
614,IV.,and we had discovered our plough driven deep into the ground.  Sigenok
615,IV.,"disappeared the moment he understood our intentions, and Sam looked very"
616,IV.,"blank, and said that he feared he did not like work and had gone off."
617,IV.,
618,IV.,"""I think not,"" observed Malcolm; and he was right.  In a few hours"
619,IV.,"Sigenok returned with two horses and several hides well tanned, and"
620,IV.,"needles, and fibre for thread.  I thought Sam would have hugged him, he"
621,IV.,was so delighted.  Without loss of time they set to work and cut out a
622,IV.,"set of harness, and, lighting a lamp, seated at the entrance to our"
623,IV.,"tent, laboured at it the greater part of the night, Malcolm and I"
624,IV.,"helping as far as we could.  Sam made us go to sleep, but as I looked up"
625,IV.,"they were still at work, and when I awoke in the morning it was"
626,IV.,"finished.  The horses were a little restive, evidently not being"
627,IV.,"accustomed to ploughing, but they obeyed Sigenok's voice in a wonderful"
628,IV.,"way, though it was necessary in the first place to teach him what ought"
629,IV.,to be done.  It is said by some that Indians will not labour.  I have
630,IV.,reason to know that they will when they have a sufficient motive.
631,IV.,"Sigenok showed this.  His motive was gratitude to us, and affection"
632,IV.,excited by compassion.  No white man would have laboured harder.  When
633,IV.,"the wheat and Indian corn was in the ground, he with his horses helped"
634,IV.,Sam and us to bring in stuff for fencing and to put it up.  All this
635,IV.,"time he slept outside our tent, under shelter of a simple lean-to of"
636,IV.,"birch bark.  Another day he disappeared, and we saw him in the evening"
637,IV.,coming up the river towing some timber.  He brought a heavy log up on
638,IV.,"his shoulders.  ""There is part of your house,"" he observed, ""we can get"
639,IV.,"the rest in time."""
640,IV.,
641,IV.,"So we did; we borrowed a large boat, and taking advantage of a northerly"
642,IV.,"wind, we brought up, piece by piece, the whole of our hut, which had"
643,IV.,"grounded near the banks of the river.  Our neighbours, in spite of the"
644,IV.,"value of their time to themselves, came and helped us, and we very soon"
645,IV.,"had our hut over our heads, though, excepting the articles we had saved"
646,IV.,"in the canoe, we had no furniture remaining."
647,IV.,
648,IV.,"""Sigenok live here with you,"" observed our Indian friend."
649,IV.,
650,IV.,"""Of course; very glad,"" we answered, thinking he intended to take up his"
651,IV.,abode in our hut.
652,IV.,
653,IV.,"We had arranged that morning to go to the Port [Fort Garry, belonging to"
654,IV.,the Hudson's Bay Company.] to obtain flour and other articles.  We were
655,IV.,"not without money, for our father had put his desk in the canoe, and in"
656,IV.,"it we found a sum of money, considerable for our wants.  On our return"
657,IV.,"from the Port, we found that Sigenok had erected close to our door an"
658,IV.,Indian wigwam.  It was very simple of construction.  It consisted of
659,IV.,"about a dozen long poles stuck in the ground in a circle, and fastened"
660,IV.,together at the top so as to make the figure of a cone.  Against these
661,IV.,poles were placed large slabs of birch bask.  It comes off the tree in
662,IV.,"layers, which, having a tendency to regain their circular form, cling"
663,IV.,"round the cone, and are further secured with bands of fibre.  In the"
664,IV.,"centre is the fire, while the smoke escapes through an opening left in"
665,IV.,"the top; some mats on the ground, and some lines stretched across on"
666,IV.,"which clothes or other articles can be hung up, form the chief furniture"
667,IV.,"of these wigwams.  To these may be added a bundle of hides or mats, and"
668,IV.,an iron pot.
669,IV.,
670,IV.,"We had purchased some bedding at the Fort, and Sam and Malcolm soon"
671,IV.,"knocked up some rough furniture, which served our purpose.  We should"
672,IV.,often have been on short commons had not Sam and Sigenok been expert
673,IV.,"fishermen, so that we were never without an ample supply of white-fish,"
674,IV.,"or gold-eyes, or sturgeon."
675,IV.,
676,IV.,"""This very well,"" observed Sigenok.  ""Fish very good, but in winter"
677,IV.,"buffalo better."""
678,IV.,
679,IV.,"""Will you help us to go and hunt the buffalo, then?"" we both exclaimed."
680,IV.,
681,IV.,Sigenok nodded; it was what he had proposed to himself that we should
682,IV.,"do.  Although a wood Indian, he had connections among the prairie"
683,IV.,"Indians, and from living with them had become a good rider and expert"
684,IV.,hunter.  Sam did not like our going; he was afraid some accident might
685,IV.,"happen to us, but he had not the heart to tell us so.  He was to remain"
686,IV.,"at home to take care of the farm.  Sigenok procured two other horses,"
687,IV.,"one for himself, and another to drag a light cart which we bought, made"
688,IV.,"entirely of wood.  It was laden with our tent and provisions, and our"
689,IV.,rifles and powder and shot.  We felt in high spirits when we were ready
690,IV.,"to start, and wishing Sam an affectionate farewell, set off to join a"
691,IV.,large band of hunters proceeding to the plains.  There were nearly three
692,IV.,"hundred men, besides their wives and children.  The greater number were"
693,IV.,"half-breeds, but there were also a large body of Indians, among whom we"
694,IV.,"found Sigenok's relatives, who received as in the most cordial manner,"
695,IV.,"and told us that we should be their brothers, that our friends should be"
696,IV.,"their friends, and our foes their foes.  The half-breeds had nearly five"
697,IV.,"hundred carts, each with a distinguishing flag; and there must have been"
698,IV.,"even a larger number of hunters, all mounted.  Their tents, or lodges,"
699,IV.,are formed of dressed buffalo-skins.  They are pitched in a large
700,IV.,"circle, with the carts outside; and when in a hostile country, with the"
701,IV.,"animals in the centre, otherwise they feed outside the circle.  They"
702,IV.,"have a captain, and regular officers under him; and a flag hoisted on a"
703,IV.,"pole in the centre serves as a signal.  When hauled down, it is a sign"
704,IV.,"that the march is to be continued.  When the whole body was on the move,"
705,IV.,"it reminded us of a caravan in the East, with the long line of carts"
706,IV.,"winding along over the plain, and the horsemen galloping about on either"
707,IV.,"side.  For several days we travelled on without seeing any buffalo, till"
708,IV.,"one day, soon after we had camped, notice was brought by the scouts that"
709,IV.,a large herd were in the neighbourhood.  All was now excitement and
710,IV.,"preparation in the camp.  Sigenok called us early in the morning, and,"
711,IV.,"after a hasty breakfast, in high spirits we mounted our horses, and"
712,IV.,"accompanied the band of hunters.  We made a wide circuit, so as to let"
713,IV.,the wind blow from the buffaloes towards us.  I should tell you that the
714,IV.,animal denominated the buffalo by the North Americans is what is
715,IV.,properly called the bison by naturalists.  They roam in vast herds over
716,IV.,"the interior of North America, from Mexico as far north as the large"
717,IV.,"river Saskatchewan and Lake Winnipeg.  We rode on, drawing nearer and"
718,IV.,"nearer, till, as we ascended a slight elevation, we saw over it on the"
719,IV.,"plain on the other side a vast herd of big-headed, dark, hairy monsters,"
720,IV.,more buffaloes than I supposed existed on the whole continent.  They
721,IV.,"were feeding quietly, as if not aware of the approach of foes.  Our"
722,IV.,"captain, an experienced hunter, rode along the ranks commanding silence,"
723,IV.,"directing every man to look to his arms, and exhorting the novices not"
724,IV.,"to shoot each other, a danger which might justly be apprehended.  Each"
725,IV.,"hunter now ascertained that his rifle was loaded, and then filled his"
726,IV.,"mouth with bullets--a ready-at-hand pouch, that he might the more"
727,IV.,quickly drop them into his piece.  I was afraid of following this
728,IV.,"example, for fear of the bullets dropping down my throat or of my gun"
729,IV.,bursting.  Malcolm and I kept close to Sigenok.  He told us to do what
730,IV.,"he did, not to lose sight of him, assuring us that our horses understood"
731,IV.,hunting perfectly.  Our hearts beat with eagerness.  We had now got near
732,IV.,"enough, in the opinion of our leader, to charge.  The signal was given,"
733,IV.,and at headlong speed the band of huntsmen dashed in among the
734,IV.,"astonished animals.  The buffaloes fled in all directions, the horsemen"
735,IV.,"following, firing right and left, and loading again with extraordinary"
736,IV.,"rapidity, seldom missing; and as each animal fell, the hunter who had"
737,IV.,"killed it dropped some article of his dress, or other mark, by which he"
738,IV.,might distinguish it.  It was the most exciting scene in which I was
739,IV.,"ever engaged--the hunters, so lately a dense and orderly body, were now"
740,IV.,"scattered far and wide over the plain, many miles apart, in pursuit of"
741,IV.,"the buffaloes; some terror-stricken, others infuriated to madness."
742,IV.,"Sigenok had killed five or six, and Malcolm had also, much to our"
743,IV.,"gratification, killed one, though I had not been so successful, from"
744,IV.,"nervousness, I fancy; when the Indian being at some distance, as we were"
745,IV.,"in full chase of another buffalo, a huge bull started out from behind a"
746,IV.,"knoll, and rushed towards us.  My brother's horse started at the"
747,IV.,"unexpected sight, and putting his foot into a badger hole, stumbled, and"
748,IV.,"threw him over his head.  The faithful animal stood stock still, but on"
749,IV.,"came the bull.  I shrieked out to Malcolm to leap on his horse and fly,"
750,IV.,"but he was stunned, and did not hear me.  The bull was not twenty paces"
751,IV.,from him; in another instant he would have been gored to death.  I felt
752,IV.,"thankful that I had not before fired.  Raising my rifle to my shoulder,"
753,IV.,"I pulled the trigger, the huge animal was within ten paces of him; over"
754,IV.,"it went, then rose on its knees, and struggled forward.  I galloped up"
755,IV.,"to Malcolm, who was beginning to recover his senses.  With a strength I"
756,IV.,"did not fancy I possessed I dragged him up, and helped him on his horse"
757,IV.,"just before the monster fell over the spot where he had lain, and would"
758,IV.,"have crushed him with his weight.  By the time Sigenok returned, the"
759,IV.,"buffalo was dead.  He highly praised me when he heard what had occurred,"
760,IV.,"but said that we had had hunting enough that day, and that he would now"
761,IV.,summon his people to take possession of the animals we had killed.  The
762,IV.,"skins are called robes, and are valued as articles of trade, being taken"
763,IV.,"by the far traders and sent to Canada, England, Russia, and other parts"
764,IV.,of the world.  Parts of the flesh of the slain animals was carried into
765,IV.,"the camp for immediate consumption, but the larger portion was prepared"
766,IV.,forthwith in a curious way for keeping.  The meat is first cut into thin
767,IV.,"slices and dried in the sun, and these slices are then pounded between"
768,IV.,two stones till the fibres separate.  This pounded meat is then mixed
769,IV.,"with melted fat, about fifty pounds of the first to forty pounds of the"
770,IV.,"latter, and while hot is pressed into buffalo-skin bags, when it forms a"
771,IV.,"hard, compact mass.  It is now called pemmikon, from _pemmi_, meat, and"
772,IV.,"_kon_, fat, in the Cree language.  One pound of this mixture is"
773,IV.,"considered as nutritious as two of ordinary meat, and it has the"
774,IV.,advantage of keeping for years through all temperatures.
775,IV.,
776,V.,V.
777,V.,
778,V.,"Soon after the grand hunting-day I have described, our scout brought"
779,V.,word that a party of Sioux were in the neighbourhood.  Our fighting-men
780,V.,"attacked them and killed several.  A scalp-dance took place, and other"
781,V.,"orgies which I will not describe.  I was so horrified with what I saw,"
782,V.,that I agreed with Malcolm that we would get back to the settlements as
783,V.,"soon as we could.  We expressed our wish to Sigenok, and he promised to"
784,V.,return with us on the following day.  Malcolm's great wish was to
785,V.,"withdraw Sigenok from his savage companions, and to induce him to settle"
786,V.,down as a civilised man and a Christian.  We talked to him on the
787,V.,"subject, but he replied, that he had been all his life accustomed to"
788,V.,"hunting, and fighting, and that he could not abandon them.  The next day"
789,V.,"we set out, leaving the larger body of Indians still encamped."
790,V.,
791,V.,"We had travelled on for two days, when the belief being entertained that"
792,V.,"we had no enemies to fear, there was less than the usual caution"
793,V.,observed by the natives in our march.  We were passing through a
794,V.,"sparsely wooded country, I was in advance with Sigenok, while Malcolm"
795,V.,"and several young Indians, whose interest he wished to excite by"
796,V.,"descriptions of England and the wonders of the civilised world, brought"
797,V.,"up the rear, at a considerable distance.  Suddenly Sigenok stopped, the"
798,V.,"crack of a rifle was heard, several others followed.  ""The Sioux!"" he"
799,V.,"exclaimed, turning round his horse.  ""Quick! quick! our friends are"
800,V.,"attacked.""  No other order was required; keeping close to him we all"
801,V.,"galloped back the way we had come, getting our rifles ready for action"
802,V.,as we proceeded.  A terrible anticipation of misfortune seized me as I
803,V.,"thought of Malcolm, and the fate which might have overtaken him.  Still"
804,V.,"he and his companions might be defending themselves, and we should be in"
805,V.,time to rescue them.  My heart sunk when the firing ceased.  I knew that
806,V.,the Sioux would not have attacked the party unless greatly superior in
807,V.,"numbers, and I dreaded that all was over, and that having slaughtered"
808,V.,their victims they had retired victorious.  Sigenok might have thought
809,V.,"the same, for he sent out scouts on either side, and advanced with"
810,V.,"greater caution than before, though still at a rapid pace.  We pulled up"
811,V.,at an open glade.  Sad was the sight which met our eyes.  On every side
812,V.,"were strewed the bodies of our companions, all denuded of their scalps."
813,V.,I almost fell fainting from my horse.  I dreaded to find the body of my
814,V.,dear brother among them; still I eagerly hurried on to ascertain his
815,V.,fate.  He was not to be found among the slain.  My hopes slightly
816,V.,"revived.  He might have escaped and be concealed somewhere near, or he"
817,V.,might have been carried off as a prisoner.  My blood ran cold when I
818,V.,"thought of this latter possibility, for I had heard of the horrible mode"
819,V.,"in which the Red men tortured their prisoners, and I dreaded lest such"
820,V.,should be the lot of my poor brother.  The rage and fury of the Indians
821,V.,"at finding that their friends had thus been cut off was terrific, and"
822,V.,"their threats of vengeance terrible.  I had hitherto, till this"
823,V.,"expedition, seen the Red men only under more favourable aspects.  I now"
824,V.,perceived what they could become when excited by passion.  Still the
825,V.,loss of my brother made me anxious that they should immediately
826,V.,undertake an expedition which might result in his recovery.  I saw the
827,V.,"Indians examining the ground round on every side, and they soon"
828,V.,pronounced an opinion that the party who had attacked their friends did
829,V.,"not equal them in numbers, and would not have succeeded had they not"
830,V.,lain in ambush and taken them by surprise.  We must have passed close to
831,V.,"the Sioux, but in consequence of the superiority of our numbers they"
832,V.,were afraid to attack us.  A council was immediately held; the principal
833,V.,"men spoke, and various plans were suggested.  The result of them was,"
834,V.,"that it was determined to form a camp on the spot, while twenty"
835,V.,well-mounted warriors should go in pursuit of the Sioux.  I entreated
836,V.,"Sigenok to allow me to accompany him.  ""You are young for warfare, but"
837,V.,"your heart is strong--you shall go,"" he answered.  No time was to be"
838,V.,lost.  It was of great consequence to follow up the foe so rapidly that
839,V.,"they might not be prepared for our approach.  A hurried meal was taken,"
840,V.,and each warrior furnishing himself with a supply of pemmikon for
841,V.,"several days, we immediately set off.  Three men, on foot, always kept"
842,V.,"ahead to act as scouts and to feel the way, while their horses were led"
843,V.,"by the rest, and when the first were tired others took their places."
844,V.,"The Sioux must have retreated very rapidly, for two whole days passed,"
845,V.,"and though my friends assured me we were on the right trail, we had not"
846,V.,"overtaken them.  I was almost in despair, and began to doubt that, even"
847,V.,"if Malcolm was alive, he could be with them.  I had just expressed my"
848,V.,fears to Sigenok when one of the scouts came hurrying back and exhibited
849,V.,"a tag--the end of a boot-lace, such as my brother had worn.  This"
850,V.,Sigenok considered a sure sign that Malcolm was with them.  My
851,V.,"eagerness, therefore, increased to overtake them, but the Indians"
852,V.,"assured me that great caution was requisite, and that instead of going"
853,V.,"faster, it might be necessary to go slower.  This is often the case I"
854,V.,have since found in other affairs of life.  More scouts were now sent
855,V.,out and still greater caution used.  It was the intention of my
856,V.,"companions, if possible, to make the onslaught on the camp of their foes"
857,V.,"at night.  All depended, however, on our approach not being suspected."
858,V.,"The Sioux, of course, would have scouts out, and the difficulty was to"
859,V.,"avoid their meeting ours, or discovering any traces.  At last, just"
860,V.,"before dusk, one of our scouts brought in word that they had encamped,"
861,V.,"and that we were about two miles from them.  It was suspected, from the"
862,V.,"way in which they had formed their camp, they must have thought that"
863,V.,they had distanced us.  We had now no longer any doubt about overtaking
864,V.,"them, but the question was as to the best means of making the attack."
865,V.,The Indians' chief thought was of revenging themselves for the loss of
866,V.,"their relatives, my only desire was to recover my brother should he"
867,V.,still be alive.  We continued to advance till we got within about half a
868,V.,mile of the Sioux camp--the hilly nature of the ground and the woods
869,V.,"concealing our approach.  Beyond that we dared not proceed, as the"
870,V.,country was so open that we might easily have been seen had we made the
871,V.,"attempt.  The band, accordingly, here left their horses under charge of"
872,V.,"five of their number, and as soon as it was dusk they commenced their"
873,V.,stealthy approach to the camp.  Sigenok and another young and active
874,V.,Indian undertook to look after me.  Not a word was spoken after we set
875,V.,"out--not a leaf was moved, scarcely a blade of grass was uselessly"
876,V.,"pressed down.  On they crept slowly, and so gently that I could scarcely"
877,V.,hear the footfalls even of my two companions.  I imitated their way of
878,V.,"walking, and as I had on mocassins I also was able to avoid making the"
879,V.,slightest noise.  We had got within a thousand yards of the camp when we
880,V.,"all stopped to listen.  The camp was still astir, and there were sounds"
881,V.,of feasting and revelry.  The Indians with me ground their teeth--their
882,V.,"enemies, fancying themselves secure, were about to indulge in a"
883,V.,scalp-dance over the scalps they had taken in the morning.  As yet the
884,V.,scouts had not got near enough to ascertain if my brother was with them.
885,V.,"I entreated Sigenok to let me go and ascertain.  ""Not without me,"" was"
886,V.,"his answer.  ""Bah, we will go.""  I eagerly and fearlessly pressed on."
887,V.,"We had to crawl along the ground lest our figures might be perceived, by"
888,V.,"the sharp eyes of the Sioux, against the sky.  We reached a small"
889,V.,stream.  The camp was formed a little way beyond it.  We waded across
890,V.,"it, and creeping up, looked over the bank.  In the centre was a fire"
891,V.,"which, as it blazed up, threw a strange light on the groups of fierce"
892,V.,savages clustering round it.  At a little distance was a figure which
893,V.,attracted all my attention--it was that of my brother.  He was seated on
894,V.,"a log of wood, close to which a stake was driven in, and to this his"
895,V.,"wrists were tightly secured, though his feet were free.  His head was"
896,V.,"bent down; he sat perfectly quiet, as if resigned to his fate.  By the"
897,V.,"gestures of his captors I thought that they were talking about him, and"
898,V.,I feared that they were proposing forthwith to put him to death.  I
899,V.,dared not ask Sigenok what he thought; the slightest sound might have
900,V.,"betrayed us.  Oh how I longed to rush forward and join his fate,"
901,V.,whatever that might be.  I believe that I should have done so when I saw
902,V.,"him lift up his pale countenance, so expressive of grief and pain, had"
903,V.,"not Sigenok held me back.  He was, I was sure, thinking of me, and how"
904,V.,"miserable I should be when he was taken from me, and I was left alone in"
905,V.,the world.  Sigenok now made a sign to me to retreat; keeping close to
906,V.,"him as before, I unwillingly left the spot.  We crawled on till we"
907,V.,rejoined our companions.  It may seem surprising that the Sioux should
908,V.,have been so completely off their guard; but this arose from their
909,V.,"despising their foes, the fact being that the Ojibways are generally"
910,V.,"very unwarlike, and they, therefore, believed that they would not"
911,V.,venture to follow them.  My companions' plans were soon formed.  It was
912,V.,"arranged that the whole party should creep forward as we had done, and"
913,V.,that each man should single out one of the enemy according to his
914,V.,"position, and that at a signal from Sigenok, the low croak of a frog,"
915,V.,all should fire at the same moment.  With the sound of the first shot
916,V.,"the men with the horses were to come galloping on, as if a fresh party"
917,V.,"were approaching the scene of conflict.  As, undoubtedly, all the Sioux"
918,V.,"would not be killed, some might, otherwise, attempt to rush on their"
919,V.,"concealed foes, but, with the fear of falling into the hands of their"
920,V.,"enemies, they would now take to flight.  My heart beat quick as we now"
921,V.,moved on towards the camp of our treacherous foes.  The night was very
922,V.,"dark, and so noiseless were the movements of the Indians that, till I"
923,V.,"actually touched Sigenok's heel, I fancied at one time that I must be"
924,V.,alone.  The shouting and shrieking of the Sioux as they sang their songs
925,V.,of triumph yet farther assisted us to approach.  In another moment the
926,V.,"death volley would be given, and most of those fierce savages would be"
927,V.,laid low.  My only wish all the time was to rush forward and to release
928,V.,my beloved brother.  How breathlessly I waited for the signal!  The
929,V.,"warriors were moving about, and Sigenok was not yet satisfied,"
930,V.,"apparently, with the positions which they had taken up.  Little did they"
931,V.,dream of the danger which threatened them.  Sigenok's object was to wait
932,V.,"till the Sioux were separated as much as possible, so that there should"
933,V.,be no mistake as to which of them should be aimed at by the warriors of
934,V.,"our party.  After sitting down for some time, they all arose with eager"
935,V.,and violent gestures; some went in the direction of the temporary
936,V.,"wigwams they had formed, and others advanced towards Malcolm.  By their"
937,V.,looks and gesticulations I had little doubt that it was with the
938,V.,intention of torturing him.  Poor Malcolm lifted up his countenance and
939,V.,gazed with calm resignation at his approaching tormentors.  My knees
940,V.,"trembled for very anxiety.  Just then I heard a low ""croak! croak!"""
941,V.,"Though warned, I believed that it was really a frog close to me.  It was"
942,V.,followed by a click as if caused by the cocking of the rifles.  The
943,V.,Sioux one and all started and looked round.  Their quick ears had
944,V.,"detected the sound.  There was another low croak, and at the same"
945,V.,"instant a rattling volley, and fourteen savages lay stretched on the"
946,V.,"grass.  The rest rushed in all directions seeking for shelter, but in"
947,V.,"their alarm, scarcely perceiving whence the volley had proceeded, some"
948,V.,"darted towards the bank of the stream, where my friends still lay"
949,V.,concealed rapidly reloading their rifles.  Scarcely had the smoke
950,V.,cleared off than I saw through it a savage darting towards Malcolm with
951,V.,"uplifted knife, resolved apparently, before he died, to plunge it in his"
952,V.,"bosom.  I shrieked out, and sprang forward to throw myself between them."
953,V.,"The savage saw me, and was about to vent his rage on my head, but at"
954,V.,"the moment his gleaming knife was uplifted to strike, a bullet struck"
955,V.,"him, fired from Sigenok's rifle, and he fell within a foot of me, in"
956,V.,vain endeavouring to reach me with his weapon.  I sprang to my brother's
957,V.,"side, he was unhurt, my knife was busily employed in cutting through the"
958,V.,thongs which bound him.  More shots were heard as my Ojibway friends
959,V.,caught sight of their Sioux foes endeavouring to escape.  A few of the
960,V.,"latter had, however, got to some distance and were trying to catch their"
961,V.,"horses, on which their only hope of safety now depended.  The object of"
962,V.,"the Ojibways was, of course, to prevent them, lest they should carry the"
963,V.,"news of what had happened to their tribe, who would, in their turn, send"
964,V.,off another war party in pursuit of us.
965,V.,
966,V.,The approach of our horses was now heard.  Sigenok with a dozen other
967,V.,"men threw themselves on their backs almost without stopping them, and"
968,V.,galloped off in hot pursuit of their flying enemies.  I stood by the
969,V.,"side of my brother, who was too much bewildered to understand what had"
970,V.,"happened.  His first words were, ""Harry, dear Harry, tell me is it a"
971,V.,"dream or a reality.  Am I really free?"""
972,V.,
973,V.,"""Free, Malcolm, I trust,"" I answered; ""though I might almost ask you the"
974,V.,"same question; I can scarcely believe my happiness."""
975,V.,
976,V.,"""Now I take your hand and hear your voice, I know that it is true,"" he"
977,V.,"said eagerly.  ""And that poor savage who lies so helpless there, I"
978,V.,thought he was going to kill me; but I have been mercifully protected; I
979,V.,will tell you all about it by and by.  Oh what a dreadful state of
980,V.,"existence is this wild life; we will quit it, and return to our quiet"
981,V.,"home and never leave that.  I had often read about savages, and thought"
982,V.,"them very fine fellows, but little knew what they really are--how"
983,V.,"bloodthirsty, cruel, murderous.  Let us fly, Harry, let us fly at once."
984,V.,"Do not stay here."""
985,V.,
986,V.,"I pacified him after a little time, and persuaded him to remain till"
987,V.,"Sigenok returned.  ""He, though still a savage, is, at all events,"
988,V.,"faithful,"" I observed; ""he will not desert us till he has seen us home"
989,V.,and safe again with Sam Dawes.  I wish that we could wean him altogether
990,V.,"from his mode of life, and induce him to become a civilised man."""
991,V.,
992,V.,"While Malcolm and I were talking, the rest of the Ojibways had"
993,V.,"collected, with the exception of those who had gone in pursuit of the"
994,V.,"Sioux.  The fire had sunk low, and I was thankful that the darkness"
995,V.,prevented us from watching the horrid task in which they were engaged--
996,V.,that of scalping their fallen foes.  The exclamations they uttered while
997,V.,"thus employed, showed the delight they took in the dreadful work.  ""Our"
998,V.,"brothers are avenged! our brothers are avenged!"" they kept shouting."
999,V.,"""Their mothers, and wives, and children will not mourn alone; there will"
1000,V.,be grief and wailing also in the lodges of the Sioux.  They will no
1001,V.,longer be able to boast that they are the great warriors of the plains.
1002,V.,We have conquered them; we have slain them; we have their scalps to
1003,V.,"show.""  Nearly an hour thus passed; so greatly excited all the time were"
1004,V.,the savages that they took little notice of us.
1005,V.,
1006,V.,"At last we heard shouts in the distance, which became louder and louder,"
1007,V.,"till by the light of the fire, which had been renewed, we saw Sigenok"
1008,V.,and his companions ride into the camp flourishing at the end of their
1009,V.,spears the dreadful trophies of their success.  But I should not have
1010,V.,"described those scenes at all, were it not to afford you a true picture"
1011,V.,"of savage life, not as it is painted by romance writers, but as it"
1012,V.,"really is, debased, and wretched, and hopeless.  We soon reached the"
1013,V.,camp and recommenced our return to the settlements as rapidly as we
1014,V.,could push on.
1015,V.,
1016,V.,"Sigenok told us that the Sioux of whom they had gone in chase, had"
1017,V.,"nearly effected their escape, but that he had come up with them as they"
1018,V.,"were attempting to pass a broad river, and where, from being in the"
1019,V.,"water, not hearing the approach of their foes, he and his companions had"
1020,V.,"shot them all down, so that he believed not one had got off.  Still, had"
1021,V.,"one escaped he might prove as dangerous as many, and therefore it might"
1022,V.,"be safer to proceed homeward at once.  We urged him to do so, and"
1023,V.,"accordingly without even resting, we at once set out to return to the"
1024,V.,camp.  We reached it in safety; but I will not attempt to describe the
1025,V.,"scenes which took place, and the savage triumph even of the women; how"
1026,V.,"they shrieked, and shouted, and danced, and clapped their hands till"
1027,V.,they appeared like so many furies rather than human beings.  As a war
1028,V.,"party of the Sioux would be able to travel much faster than we could,"
1029,V.,"the household goods were at once packed, and we set out on our return"
1030,V.,"homeward.  We travelled rapidly, and to guard against surprise we had"
1031,V.,scouts in the rear constantly on the watch for the approach of a foe.
1032,V.,The conversation of the men all the way related to the events of the
1033,V.,"expedition, and they evidently gloated over the way in which they had"
1034,V.,put their enemies to death.
1035,V.,
1036,V.,"As we proceeded I often turned my head when I heard any noise behind me,"
1037,V.,"expecting to see the enemy darting out of a wood, or scouring over the"
1038,V.,"prairie in chase of us, and at night, while we were encamped, I"
1039,V.,frequently started up under the belief that the Sioux were upon us.
1040,V.,
1041,V.,"""All our sufferings, and the dangers we have gone through, and the"
1042,V.,"horrors we have witnessed, have been owing to our folly,"" observed"
1043,V.,"Malcolm; ""had we remained at home, steadily assisting Sam Dawes to"
1044,V.,"cultivate the farm, we should have escaped them all.  We will be wiser"
1045,V.,"in future."""
1046,V.,
1047,VI.,VI.
1048,VI.,
1049,VI.,"With great satisfaction, and gratitude for the dangers we had escaped,"
1050,VI.,"our eyes once more rested on the silvery waters of the Red River, as it"
1051,VI.,"wound its way through the rich plains of the settlement, towards the"
1052,VI.,"lengthened expanse of Lake Winnipeg.  Malcolm and I, putting our spurs"
1053,VI.,"into our mustangs' flanks, galloped on eager to announce our arrival to"
1054,VI.,"Sam Dawes.  He was labouring by himself, putting up a fence to a new"
1055,VI.,"field.  He saw us coming, and, throwing down his axe, hurried forward to"
1056,VI.,meet us.  Never was there a more happy meeting.  He had a great deal to
1057,VI.,"tell us, as we had to tell him.  Gathering up his tools, he walked by"
1058,VI.,"our sides to the hut; a hut though it was no longer, for by his"
1059,VI.,persevering industry he had converted it into a very comfortable
1060,VI.,"residence; while he had replaced, though in a somewhat rough fashion,"
1061,VI.,nearly all the furniture we had lost.  My brother and I felt ashamed at
1062,VI.,"having deserted him for so long, while he was labouring for our benefit."
1063,VI.,
1064,VI.,"""Well, dear masters, I did ofttimes feel sad and lonely like while you"
1065,VI.,"were away, but now I've got you back safe all that seems as light as a"
1066,VI.,"feather,"" he exclaimed, pressing our hands and looking into our faces"
1067,VI.,with the affection of a parent.  He told us that great changes had taken
1068,VI.,"place in the settlement during our absence, that a clergyman had settled"
1069,VI.,"near us, that a church was built and a school established, and that many"
1070,VI.,new colonists had bought land along the banks of the river for many
1071,VI.,miles towards the south as well as to the north of us.  The good
1072,VI.,clergyman had also induced several families of Indians to settle in the
1073,VI.,"neighbourhood, and that they seemed to have accepted with joy the glad"
1074,VI.,tidings of salvation which he had been the means of offering them.
1075,VI.,
1076,VI.,"""I wish that Sigenok would come and join them then,"" exclaimed Malcolm"
1077,VI.,"warmly; ""so brave and energetic a man would bring many others over to"
1078,VI.,"the truth."""
1079,VI.,
1080,VI.,The next day Sigenok himself came in to see us.  Malcolm opened the
1081,VI.,"subject of which he had been speaking.  Sigenok listened attentively,"
1082,VI.,and said that he would go and hear what the missionary had to say.  He
1083,VI.,did so.
1084,VI.,
1085,VI.,"The winter set in, and the river and lake were frozen over, and the"
1086,VI.,"ground was covered with snow, and sleighs had taken the place of carts,"
1087,VI.,"and thick buffalo-skin coats of light dress, and stoves were lighted and"
1088,VI.,"windows closed, and the whole face of Nature seemed changed.  Sigenok"
1089,VI.,"came to us.  ""Ah!"" he exclaimed, ""when I knew you first my heart was"
1090,VI.,"like the great prairie when the fire has passed over it, all black and"
1091,VI.,foul; now it is white like that field of glittering snow on which we
1092,VI.,"gaze.  I am a Christian; I look with horror on my past life, and things"
1093,VI.,"which I considered before praiseworthy and noble, I now see to be"
1094,VI.,"abominable and vile."""
1095,VI.,
1096,VI.,"Day after day, in spite of cold and wind and snow, did Sigenok come up"
1097,VI.,to the missionary's house to receive instruction in the new faith which
1098,VI.,"had brought such joy to his heart.  Many followed in his footsteps, and"
1099,VI.,there now exists a whole village of Christian Indians in the settlement
1100,VI.,"who have put away and for ever their medicine men and their charms, and"
1101,VI.,"their false Manitou, and their cruelties and bloodthirstiness, and are"
1102,VI.,worshippers of the true God in sincerity and simplicity of faith.
1103,VI.,Several of the Indian boys brought up at the school have obtained a
1104,VI.,"considerable amount of learning, and some are ordained ministers of the"
1105,VI.,"gospel, and others catechists and schoolmasters at various missionary"
1106,VI.,stations scattered throughout the wide extent of Rupert's Land.
1107,VI.,
1108,VI.,"You may like to hear something more about that wonderful land, that"
1109,VI.,_terra ignota_ of British Central America.  At the time of which I have
1110,VI.,been speaking it was supposed that the only fertile land was to be found
1111,VI.,"on the banks of the Red River, but it is now ascertained that an"
1112,VI.,extremely rich and fertile belt extends from the Red River right across
1113,VI.,"the continent, for eight hundred miles or more, to the base of the Rocky"
1114,VI.,"Mountains, where it unites with the new province of Columbia.  This"
1115,VI.,"fertile belt is capable of supporting innumerable herds of cattle,"
1116,VI.,"flocks of sheep, and droves of horses, and of giving employment and"
1117,VI.,happy homes to millions of the human race.  It produces wheat and
1118,VI.,"barley, and oats, and Indian corn, or maize, in great perfection, and"
1119,VI.,"potatoes and a variety of other roots and vegetables of all sorts, and"
1120,VI.,"the finest grass for hay, and hemp and tobacco, and many other plants"
1121,VI.,"with difficulty grown in England.  The rivers are full of fish, and game"
1122,VI.,"of all sorts abound.  The climate is very uniform throughout, like that"
1123,VI.,"of Upper Canada--warm in summer and very cold in winter, but dry and"
1124,VI.,healthy in the extreme.
1125,VI.,
1126,VI.,"When, as I hope the case may be before long, those lakes and rivers"
1127,VI.,along which we travelled on our journey from Lake Superior to the Red
1128,VI.,"River are made navigable for steamers, this country will become the"
1129,VI.,"great highway to British Columbia, to China, Japan, and the"
1130,VI.,wide-spreading shores and isles of the Pacific.  With a line of
1131,VI.,"settlements established across it, the journey may easily be performed,"
1132,VI.,"and some day, Harry, you and I will run over, and we will pay a visit to"
1133,VI.,the very scenes which I have been describing to you; but instead of
1134,VI.,"roving savages, murdering and scalping in every direction, living by"
1135,VI.,"hunting and fishing, I hope that we may find the Indians settled down as"
1136,VI.,"Christian men, and persevering cultivators of the soil which Providence"
1137,VI.,will compel to yield a rich return for their labour.  You will wish to
1138,VI.,know more of your uncle Malcolm's and my proceedings.  We soon became
1139,VI.,"acquainted with the good clergyman I have mentioned, and after a time he"
1140,VI.,"suggested to us that, as our education was far from perfect, it would be"
1141,VI.,"wise if we recommenced our studies.  This we did, and though we"
1142,VI.,continued to help Sam Dawes in his farm labours even more efficiently
1143,VI.,"than before, so steady was our application when engaged with our books"
1144,VI.,"under our kind tutor, that we made considerable progress in our studies."
1145,VI.,"For three years or more we lived on very happily, with nothing to"
1146,VI.,"change our course of life, when we received notice from England that a"
1147,VI.,relation of our father's especially wished us to return.  On consulting
1148,VI.,"our friend the clergyman, he strongly recommended us to accept the"
1149,VI.,invitation offered us.  As we expected speedily to return we left Sam
1150,VI.,"Dawes in charge of the farm, though he was almost heart-broken at"
1151,VI.,"parting from us.  He would, indeed, never have consented to remain had"
1152,VI.,he not believed that it was for our interest to do so.  On reaching
1153,VI.,England great was our surprise to find that our relative intended to
1154,VI.,"leave us his property.  On ascertaining our attainments in knowledge, he"
1155,VI.,insisted on our both going to the university.  Your uncle Malcolm took
1156,VI.,"high honours, and entered into holy orders.  I became, as was our"
1157,VI.,"relative, a merchant, and without allowing business to absorb me, I have"
1158,VI.,considerably increased the small portion he left me.  Your uncle Malcolm
1159,VI.,"and I have constantly talked of going over to visit Sam Dawes, but"
1160,VI.,"circumstances have prevented us.  We long ago made over the farm to him,"
1161,VI.,"and he has greatly increased and improved it.  He is, we hear, a hale"
1162,VI.,"old man.  And now, Harry, I have told you a long story enough for"
1163,VI.,to-day.  Some other time I will tell you more about the wonders of
1164,VI.,Rupert's Land.

1171,ETCETERA.,ETCETERA.
1172,ETCETERA.,
1173,ETCETERA.,It is now about four hundred years since a great feast was held at
1174,ETCETERA.,"Skipton Castle, to celebrate the birth of a son and heir to the noble"
1175,ETCETERA.,house of De Clifford.  The young lord of the domain had just succeeded
1176,ETCETERA.,"to the title and vast possessions of his father, Thomas Lord Clifford,"
1177,ETCETERA.,"who was killed in the battle of Saint Albans, at the beginning of the"
1178,ETCETERA.,"civil wars between the rival houses of York and Lancaster, and, by his"
1179,ETCETERA.,"death, his only son John, then not much more than twenty years of age,"
1180,ETCETERA.,"became lord of the great manor of Skipton in Yorkshire, and of Brougham"
1181,ETCETERA.,"Castle, with its wide lands, in Westmoreland, besides other castles and"
1182,ETCETERA.,estates in different parts of the Northern Counties.  A rich and
1183,ETCETERA.,"powerful family were the De Cliffords, descended from Richard of"
1184,ETCETERA.,"Normandy, the uncle of William the Conqueror, and the first Lord"
1185,ETCETERA.,"Clifford was the father of the lady called Fair Rosamond, who lived in"
1186,ETCETERA.,"the reign of King Henry the Second, and was so beautiful that it is said"
1187,ETCETERA.,"in some histories of England that the queen was jealous of her, and"
1188,ETCETERA.,"obliged her to take poison; but this story is now supposed to be untrue,"
1189,ETCETERA.,as there is reason to believe that Fair Rosamond became a nun and died
1190,ETCETERA.,in a convent.  The De Cliffords held the Barony of Clifford in
1191,ETCETERA.,"Herefordshire, and the extensive manor of Skipton in Yorkshire, when the"
1192,ETCETERA.,"grandson of Rosamond's father married a rich heiress, who brought him"
1193,ETCETERA.,"the Barony of Westmoreland, to which Brougham Castle belonged, and after"
1194,ETCETERA.,"that other lords of the race acquired estates by their marriages, so"
1195,ETCETERA.,that the wealth and grandeur of the family had been continually
1196,ETCETERA.,"increasing.  The wife of the present Lord Clifford, the beautiful and"
1197,ETCETERA.,"accomplished Lady Margaret, was the only child, consequently the heiress"
1198,ETCETERA.,"of Henry Bromflete Lord de Vesci, who was also possessed of large"
1199,ETCETERA.,"estates, one of which was Londesborough in Yorkshire, so that Henry, the"
1200,ETCETERA.,"hero of this tale, was born heir to great riches and honours, and in his"
1201,ETCETERA.,"childhood was surrounded with all the magnificence of a royal prince,"
1202,ETCETERA.,"for his father lived in kingly state, and his mother had her maids of"
1203,ETCETERA.,"honour, her squires and pages, just like a queen.  It was not long after"
1204,ETCETERA.,young Henry's birth that Lord Clifford removed his family from Skipton
1205,ETCETERA.,"to Brougham Castle, where two more children were born, a boy who was"
1206,ETCETERA.,"named Richard, and a girl named Elizabeth.  These children had their"
1207,ETCETERA.,"separate nurses and attendants, as was befitting their high station, and"
1208,ETCETERA.,"Henry's chief nurse, whose name was Maud, was as fond of him as if he"
1209,ETCETERA.,"had been her own child, for he was a very sweet-tempered, affectionate"
1210,ETCETERA.,"boy, and he loved her better than any one else in the world, except his"
1211,ETCETERA.,parents and his little brother and sister.
1212,ETCETERA.,
1213,ETCETERA.,"Lord Clifford was now very seldom at home, being deeply engaged in the"
1214,ETCETERA.,"wars, but he came sometimes and stayed for a few days or weeks, as it"
1215,ETCETERA.,"might be, and on these occasions Henry, as soon as he was old enough,"
1216,ETCETERA.,"used to dine in the Castle hall, where not less than a hundred knights"
1217,ETCETERA.,"and gentlemen, besides a great number of pages and domestics of all"
1218,ETCETERA.,"kinds, sat down to dinner all together every day, for such was the"
1219,ETCETERA.,custom of those times in great families.  The dinner hour was about
1220,ETCETERA.,"noon, or even earlier, when everybody belonging to the establishment"
1221,ETCETERA.,"assembled in the hall, where they took their places at the board"
1222,ETCETERA.,according to their rank.  At the upper end was a table raised above the
1223,ETCETERA.,"rest on a dais, for the lord of the castle and his family, with any"
1224,ETCETERA.,"guests of distinction that might happen to be present, and below this"
1225,ETCETERA.,was a long oak table extending from it lengthways down the centre of the
1226,ETCETERA.,"hall, in the middle of which stood an enormous salt-cellar, as a sort of"
1227,ETCETERA.,"boundary between such as were of gentle birth, and those of lower"
1228,ETCETERA.,"degree; the former sitting above, the latter below the salt.  The style"
1229,ETCETERA.,of living in those days would appear very uncivilised to us in this more
1230,ETCETERA.,"refined age, for the dishes were set on the board without any cloth, and"
1231,ETCETERA.,"the people ate off wooden or pewter plates, and used their fingers"
1232,ETCETERA.,"instead of forks, while many of the nobles would have their favourite"
1233,ETCETERA.,"hounds beside them, and feed them from the table; for, as the floor was"
1234,ETCETERA.,"always thickly strewed with rushes, they did not mind throwing down"
1235,ETCETERA.,"pieces of meat to their dogs.  However there was always great plenty,"
1236,ETCETERA.,and such a banquet was thought very grand then; and the young Henry de
1237,ETCETERA.,"Clifford, as being the eldest son, was treated with great homage by all"
1238,ETCETERA.,"his father's dependents.  Often, too, chiefly for his amusement,"
1239,ETCETERA.,"mummers, jugglers, and tumblers were allowed to exhibit their"
1240,ETCETERA.,"performances in the hall, for he took great delight in such"
1241,ETCETERA.,"entertainments, and no indulgence, however costly, was thought too great"
1242,ETCETERA.,"for De Clifford's heir, whose pleasure was studied by every member of"
1243,ETCETERA.,the numerous household.  It was well for him that his wise and excellent
1244,ETCETERA.,"mother taught him not to be too proud of his exalted rank, or haughty in"
1245,ETCETERA.,"his manners to those of humbler grade, but to be courteous and kind to"
1246,ETCETERA.,"every one, even to the lowest menial, so as to gain the good-will of"
1247,ETCETERA.,"all; and, as he was a very docile boy, and moreover believed that nobody"
1248,ETCETERA.,"in the world was so good or so beautiful as his own dear mother, he did"
1249,ETCETERA.,"not fail to profit by her gentle precepts, and become all that she could"
1250,ETCETERA.,wish.  Poor boy! he little dreamed then how greatly he would stand in
1251,ETCETERA.,"need of a humble spirit, or what a sad reverse of fortune he was"
1252,ETCETERA.,destined soon to experience.
1253,ETCETERA.,
1254,ETCETERA.,"His good nurse Maud had left to go to her own home at Skipton, where she"
1255,ETCETERA.,"married a shepherd belonging to the estate, and after her departure"
1256,ETCETERA.,"Henry was much more with his mother, who had begun to instruct him in"
1257,ETCETERA.,such branches of learning as were considered essential to the education
1258,ETCETERA.,of the young nobility.  She taught him to play on the harp and other
1259,ETCETERA.,"stringed instruments, to recite verses, sing many of the songs she had"
1260,ETCETERA.,"herself learned from the minstrels in her father's halls, and, what was"
1261,ETCETERA.,"of still more importance, she was about to teach him to read, which was"
1262,ETCETERA.,"not a common accomplishment in those days, for there were no printed"
1263,ETCETERA.,books in England till some time afterwards.  Printing was then a new
1264,ETCETERA.,"invention, and only practised in Germany at one or two of the principal"
1265,ETCETERA.,"towns, so that the only means of learning to read was from manuscripts"
1266,ETCETERA.,"written by the monks, generally on parchment or vellum, and beautifully"
1267,ETCETERA.,"illuminated with a border round every page, in brilliant colours"
1268,ETCETERA.,intermixed with gold.  In every monastery some of the monks were always
1269,ETCETERA.,"employed in making copies of the manuscripts their libraries contained,"
1270,ETCETERA.,and others in illuminating them; but these written books were so
1271,ETCETERA.,expensive that none but very rich people could afford to buy them.  Lady
1272,ETCETERA.,"Clifford, however, possessed a few of these valuable works, and was"
1273,ETCETERA.,"intending that her son, who was now in his seventh year, should begin to"
1274,ETCETERA.,"study them, when a heavy blow fell upon the house of De Clifford; and"
1275,ETCETERA.,"the noble youth, who was born to be a great and wealthy lord, was"
1276,ETCETERA.,reduced to the humble condition of a shepherd's boy.
1277,ETCETERA.,
1278,ETCETERA.,Henry was very desirous to know something about the war that kept his
1279,ETCETERA.,"father so much from home, and Lady Margaret took great pains to explain"
1280,ETCETERA.,"to him how it had been occasioned, and why the English people should all"
1281,ETCETERA.,be fighting against each other.  She told him it was the opinion of many
1282,ETCETERA.,"persons that the king, Henry the Sixth, who was then reigning, had no"
1283,ETCETERA.,"right to the crown, which belonged properly to the Duke of York, who had"
1284,ETCETERA.,come over from Ireland and raised an army for the purpose of dethroning
1285,ETCETERA.,"the sovereign, and getting himself made king in his stead.  She also"
1286,ETCETERA.,"told him that King Henry, though a very good man, was neither very brave"
1287,ETCETERA.,"nor very clever, so that he did not take an active part in the war"
1288,ETCETERA.,"himself, but trusted everything to his queen, Margaret of Anjou, a"
1289,ETCETERA.,"Frenchwoman, whose bold and daring spirit enabled her to support her"
1290,ETCETERA.,husband's cause.
1291,ETCETERA.,
1292,ETCETERA.,"""But which do you think is right, mother?"" said Henry."
1293,ETCETERA.,
1294,ETCETERA.,"""It is a difficult question to answer, my child; your father takes the"
1295,ETCETERA.,"part of the king, or rather of the queen, for the king is now a prisoner"
1296,ETCETERA.,in the hands of his enemies.  But the claim of the Duke of York is not
1297,ETCETERA.,"without foundation, and those who take his part of course believe him to"
1298,ETCETERA.,"be in the right.  But it is a sad thing, my Henry, that a dispute"
1299,ETCETERA.,between two princes should cause so much misery and bloodshed as has
1300,ETCETERA.,"already been occasioned by this unhappy quarrel, and it may be a long"
1301,ETCETERA.,"time yet before peace is restored."""
1302,ETCETERA.,
1303,ETCETERA.,"""Why do they say my father is for Lancaster and the Red Rose?"""
1304,ETCETERA.,
1305,ETCETERA.,"""Because our king's grandfather, Henry the Fourth, was Duke of Lancaster"
1306,ETCETERA.,before he became king.  He gained the crown by force from his cousin
1307,ETCETERA.,"Richard the Second, and although the people consented to have him for"
1308,ETCETERA.,"their king, and his son Henry the Fifth after him, and now his grandson"
1309,ETCETERA.,"Henry the Sixth, it does not prove that he had a right to take the crown"
1310,ETCETERA.,"from Richard."""
1311,ETCETERA.,
1312,ETCETERA.,"""And who is this Duke of York, mother?  Why do they think he ought to be"
1313,ETCETERA.,"the king?"""
1314,ETCETERA.,
1315,ETCETERA.,"""To make you understand that, Henry, I must go back a little further to"
1316,ETCETERA.,"the reign of Edward the Third.  He, you know, was the father of that"
1317,ETCETERA.,"good and brave prince Edward, whom we call the Black Prince, and who"
1318,ETCETERA.,would have been king if he had not died before his father.  The Black
1319,ETCETERA.,"Prince had four younger brothers, but he had a son also, who succeeded"
1320,ETCETERA.,to the throne at the death of his grandfather.  He was the Richard the
1321,ETCETERA.,"Second whose crown was taken from him by the Duke of Lancaster, his"
1322,ETCETERA.,"cousin, who is, therefore, considered a usurper.  This Duke of Lancaster"
1323,ETCETERA.,"was also a grandson of Edward the Third, but his father was one of the"
1324,ETCETERA.,"younger sons of that king; and the Duke of York, who has now come"
1325,ETCETERA.,"forward to claim the crown, and stirred up all this terrible strife, is"
1326,ETCETERA.,a descendant of one of King Edward's elder sons.  Do you understand all
1327,ETCETERA.,"this?"""
1328,ETCETERA.,
1329,ETCETERA.,"""Yes, I think I do; but I cannot tell which is in the right after all."""
1330,ETCETERA.,
1331,ETCETERA.,"""No, my dear boy, I dare say you cannot, neither can I inform you, for"
1332,ETCETERA.,there is much to be said on both sides.  I do not pretend to judge
1333,ETCETERA.,"between them, I can only be grieved to see how much sorrow is caused by"
1334,ETCETERA.,"the war, and wish that it was ended."""
1335,ETCETERA.,
1336,ETCETERA.,"""But you have not told me now, mother, why they say my father is for the"
1337,ETCETERA.,"Red Rose."""
1338,ETCETERA.,
1339,ETCETERA.,"""The Red Rose, Henry, is a badge to distinguish the king's party.  The"
1340,ETCETERA.,crimson rosette they all wear is meant to represent a red rose.  The
1341,ETCETERA.,"friends of the Duke of York wear a white one, and from these party signs"
1342,ETCETERA.,"the war has come to be called the `War of the Roses.'"""
1343,ETCETERA.,
1344,ETCETERA.,"One day, soon after this conversation, it was just before Christmas, the"
1345,ETCETERA.,"Lady Margaret, who often entered into the diversions of her children,"
1346,ETCETERA.,was teaching her two boys to shoot at a target in the gallery above the
1347,ETCETERA.,"hall, with a miniature bow and arrows.  Some of her maidens were present"
1348,ETCETERA.,"looking on at the sport, and when either of the boys shot near the mark"
1349,ETCETERA.,"they clapped their hands in applause, and exclaimed, ""In good truth,"
1350,ETCETERA.,"that was well aimed, my Lord Henry!"" or ""Bravely done, my Lord Richard!"
1351,ETCETERA.,"It went within a hair's breadth.""  And so they went on laughing and"
1352,ETCETERA.,"playing for a long while, one or other of the damsels, and sometimes the"
1353,ETCETERA.,"lady herself, trying their skill, the two boys being highly delighted"
1354,ETCETERA.,"with the sport, when they were suddenly interrupted by the sound of the"
1355,ETCETERA.,"warder's horn, and in another moment the loud, heavy tramp of many"
1356,ETCETERA.,horses was heard.
1357,ETCETERA.,
1358,ETCETERA.,"""It is my lord returned!"" cried Lady Margaret.  ""Now, heaven be praised."
1359,ETCETERA.,"Come with me, Henry, to the gate to meet your father; and you, Cicely,"
1360,ETCETERA.,"bring down Richard.  He must not say we are slow to bid him welcome."""
1361,ETCETERA.,
1362,ETCETERA.,"The drawbridge had been let down, the castle-gates flung wide open, and"
1363,ETCETERA.,in a few minutes the hall was filled with a host of soldiers who had
1364,ETCETERA.,returned with their lord from the wars.  The noble chief responded
1365,ETCETERA.,"lovingly to the affectionate greetings of his lady and his boys, then"
1366,ETCETERA.,"left the hall with them, whilst the seneschal collected all the chief"
1367,ETCETERA.,domestics and their servitors to make ready a banquet for the unexpected
1368,ETCETERA.,"guests.  A sumptuous feast was speedily prepared, and Lord Clifford,"
1369,ETCETERA.,"with the Lady Margaret and his son Henry, dined in state that day--it"
1370,ETCETERA.,was for the last time--in Brougham Castle.
1371,ETCETERA.,
1372,ETCETERA.,"The joy occasioned by his return was but short-lived, for it was quickly"
1373,ETCETERA.,"known that he was to depart again on the morrow, and much news was told"
1374,ETCETERA.,to the inmates of the castle by those who had newly arrived.  It
1375,ETCETERA.,appeared that the whole country was in a dreadful state.  The king had
1376,ETCETERA.,"been made prisoner at the last battle, and the queen was now in the"
1377,ETCETERA.,"northern counties with her son, the young prince Edward, endeavouring to"
1378,ETCETERA.,"raise fresh forces.  These were hard times for the poor country-people,"
1379,ETCETERA.,"who suffered greatly from famine, as the soldiers were marching about in"
1380,ETCETERA.,"all directions, pillaging and destroying wherever they came.  Almost"
1381,ETCETERA.,"every nobleman in England had joined either one side or the other, and"
1382,ETCETERA.,"many men, who would much rather have stayed at home in peace with their"
1383,ETCETERA.,"families, to work in the fields, or tend their flocks and herds, were"
1384,ETCETERA.,compelled to take up arms at the bidding of their lords; but the
1385,ETCETERA.,peasantry in those days were so dependent on the nobles that every man
1386,ETCETERA.,was obliged to obey the commands of the lord of the land whereon he
1387,ETCETERA.,"dwelt, for although the lower orders were not vassals and serfs as they"
1388,ETCETERA.,"used to be in earlier times, still they were not so free as they are"
1389,ETCETERA.,now.  Lord Clifford had come home chiefly for the purpose of leaving
1390,ETCETERA.,some of his trusty followers to defend the castle in case it should be
1391,ETCETERA.,"attacked, which he thought probable, and as he had taken away all the"
1392,ETCETERA.,"fighting-men, there had latterly been none left in the castle but such"
1393,ETCETERA.,as were too old or infirm to do much service.  He therefore appointed a
1394,ETCETERA.,"sufficient number to remain as a guard, then prepared to bid adieu once"
1395,ETCETERA.,more to his wife and children.  Lord Clifford was fierce and cruel in
1396,ETCETERA.,"the wars, but he was fondly attached to his own family, and it was"
1397,ETCETERA.,perhaps in some measure owing to his strong feelings with regard to
1398,ETCETERA.,"domestic ties, united with a natural ferocity of disposition, that made"
1399,ETCETERA.,"him so unsparing towards his enemies as to obtain the name of ""the"
1400,ETCETERA.,"butcher,"" by which he is distinguished in history to this very day; for"
1401,ETCETERA.,"when his father fell at the battle of Saint Albans, he made a vow that"
1402,ETCETERA.,he would revenge his death by never showing mercy to a partisan of the
1403,ETCETERA.,"house of York, and he kept that vow but too well, as you will presently"
1404,ETCETERA.,hear.
1405,ETCETERA.,
1406,ETCETERA.,"The gentle Lady Margaret watched, with a saddened heart and tearful"
1407,ETCETERA.,"eyes, the hurried preparations for her husband's departure, while Henry"
1408,ETCETERA.,"and Richard stood near him, gazing with childish admiration on his"
1409,ETCETERA.,"stately form arrayed in armour of polished steel, over which he wore a"
1410,ETCETERA.,"tabard, or short coat of crimson velvet, richly embroidered with gold,"
1411,ETCETERA.,and under its wide open sleeves the shining armour looked very splendid.
1412,ETCETERA.,"His helmet was adorned with a plume of feathers, and as he was a tall,"
1413,ETCETERA.,"handsome man, no doubt he looked very magnificent in the eyes of his"
1414,ETCETERA.,children.  It was the last time they ever saw him.
1415,ETCETERA.,
1416,ETCETERA.,"Brougham Castle stood on the bank of a narrow river, and its principal"
1417,ETCETERA.,entrance was an arched gateway opening to the riverside.  The drawbridge
1418,ETCETERA.,"had been let down, and some of the horsemen had already passed over, and"
1419,ETCETERA.,"were waiting on the opposite bank for their leader, who still lingered"
1420,ETCETERA.,to say a few more parting words to the beloved ones he was leaving
1421,ETCETERA.,"behind.  The little baby girl was brought to him for a last kiss, then"
1422,ETCETERA.,"he took Richard in his arms, and kissed him too, and stroking the glossy"
1423,ETCETERA.,"curls of Henry's light brown hair, he said--"
1424,ETCETERA.,
1425,ETCETERA.,"""I wish you were a few years older, my son, that you might go with me to"
1426,ETCETERA.,"fight for your king and queen."""
1427,ETCETERA.,
1428,ETCETERA.,"""I thank God that he is not old enough,"" returned Lady Margaret; ""it is"
1429,ETCETERA.,grief enough for me to part with my husband.  Oh! that these cruel wars
1430,ETCETERA.,"were over, for they bring nothing but sorrow to the land!"""
1431,ETCETERA.,
1432,ETCETERA.,"""Thou hast but a faint heart, my Margaret.  Our queen is a lioness"
1433,ETCETERA.,"compared with thee!"""
1434,ETCETERA.,
1435,ETCETERA.,"""I would not wish to resemble her then,"" said the lady."
1436,ETCETERA.,
1437,ETCETERA.,"""Nor would I desire that thou shouldst,"" replied her husband.  ""But keep"
1438,ETCETERA.,"up a brave spirit, for thou mayest need it."""
1439,ETCETERA.,
1440,ETCETERA.,"Again he embraced her lovingly, and mounting his gallant charger he rode"
1441,ETCETERA.,"from the castle-gate, with about fifty knights and esquires in his"
1442,ETCETERA.,"train, all well armed and mounted."
1443,ETCETERA.,
1444,ETCETERA.,"The first news that reached Brougham, was a cause of the deepest sorrow"
1445,ETCETERA.,"to Lady Margaret, although it told of a great battle that had been won"
1446,ETCETERA.,"by her husband's party at Wakefield, and also of the death of Richard,"
1447,ETCETERA.,"Duke of York, who had fallen on the field.  But it also told of a"
1448,ETCETERA.,"barbarous deed done by Lord Clifford, which she was sure would turn all"
1449,ETCETERA.,"hearts against him; and so it did, for it shocked both friends and foes,"
1450,ETCETERA.,and has left a blot on his name that will never be effaced.
1451,ETCETERA.,
1452,ETCETERA.,"It was after the battle was over, as he was riding towards the town to"
1453,ETCETERA.,"rejoin the queen, that he overtook the young Earl of Rutland, second son"
1454,ETCETERA.,"of the unfortunate Duke of York, a youth about fourteen years of age,"
1455,ETCETERA.,"who had just heard of his father's fate, and, overwhelmed with grief,"
1456,ETCETERA.,"was being hurried away by his tutor, Sir Robert Aspall, who had been"
1457,ETCETERA.,"left in charge of him near the field of battle, to seek refuge in a"
1458,ETCETERA.,"neighbouring convent.  Clifford seized the affrighted boy, who fell on"
1459,ETCETERA.,his knees and begged for mercy.
1460,ETCETERA.,
1461,ETCETERA.,"""Who is he?"" demanded the fierce nobleman in a thundering tone."
1462,ETCETERA.,
1463,ETCETERA.,"""He is the son of a prince who is now beyond thy power,"" answered the"
1464,ETCETERA.,"venerable tutor.  ""But I pray you to spare him, for he is too young to"
1465,ETCETERA.,"do hurt to thee or thy cause."""
1466,ETCETERA.,
1467,ETCETERA.,"""He is a son of York, and he shall die!"" exclaimed Lord Clifford,"
1468,ETCETERA.,"plunging his dagger into the heart of the hapless boy, who fell dead at"
1469,ETCETERA.,his feet.
1470,ETCETERA.,
1471,ETCETERA.,"It was in consequence of this wanton act of cruelty, and of the numbers"
1472,ETCETERA.,"he slew at the battle of Wakefield with his own hand, that he was"
1473,ETCETERA.,"thenceforth called ""the butcher,"" a terrible distinction, which will"
1474,ETCETERA.,cling to his memory for ever.
1475,ETCETERA.,
1476,ETCETERA.,"Lady Clifford lamented sadly over the fate of poor Rutland, for she"
1477,ETCETERA.,"would have given all the wealth she had in the world, rather than her"
1478,ETCETERA.,lord should have been guilty of such a wicked deed; and when she looked
1479,ETCETERA.,"at her dear boy Henry, she wondered that the thought of his own son"
1480,ETCETERA.,"should not have softened a father's heart, and prevented him from"
1481,ETCETERA.,"destroying an innocent youth, even though he was the son of an enemy."
1482,ETCETERA.,
1483,ETCETERA.,"One day, soon after this news was brought, there came to the castle one"
1484,ETCETERA.,of those wandering minstrels who were in the habit of going about the
1485,ETCETERA.,"country with their harps, and were sure to find a welcome at the"
1486,ETCETERA.,"mansions of the great, where, in return for a night's lodging and"
1487,ETCETERA.,"entertainment, they would amuse the company with their songs and music."
1488,ETCETERA.,"Lady Clifford never went down to the great hall when her lord was away,"
1489,ETCETERA.,but confined herself to her own private apartments with her female
1490,ETCETERA.,"attendants and her children, but she readily gave permission for the"
1491,ETCETERA.,"domestics to admit the minstrel for their own amusement, and right glad"
1492,ETCETERA.,"they were of this indulgence, as they had spent but a dull Christmas."
1493,ETCETERA.,
1494,ETCETERA.,"""May we not go down, dear mother, to hear the minstrel play and sing?"""
1495,ETCETERA.,said Henry.
1496,ETCETERA.,
1497,ETCETERA.,"""Yes, you and Richard may go for awhile if you wish it,"" replied Lady"
1498,ETCETERA.,"Margaret; and, sending for the old seneschal or steward of the castle,"
1499,ETCETERA.,she bade him take charge of the boys while they listened to the harper's
1500,ETCETERA.,"songs.  There were not many people in the castle now, but all that were"
1501,ETCETERA.,"there assembled in the hall to make merry with the new comer, except"
1502,ETCETERA.,"Lady Clifford herself, and the little Lady Elizabeth.  The minstrel sang"
1503,ETCETERA.,a long ballad all about the warlike achievements of the De Cliffords in
1504,ETCETERA.,"former times, filling up the pauses with the animated strains of his"
1505,ETCETERA.,"harp, and when the song was done, and the servants were preparing to"
1506,ETCETERA.,"dance, the boys returned to their mother, highly delighted with what"
1507,ETCETERA.,they had heard.
1508,ETCETERA.,
1509,ETCETERA.,The next morning the seneschal came to his mistress and told her that
1510,ETCETERA.,"the minstrel begged for a private audience, as he had something of"
1511,ETCETERA.,"importance to communicate, ""And I think, my lady,"" said the old man, ""it"
1512,ETCETERA.,"is about our lord that he wishes to speak, for he has just come from"
1513,ETCETERA.,"Wakefield."""
1514,ETCETERA.,
1515,ETCETERA.,"""Then bring him hither, Hubert,"" said the lady, ""I will hear what he has"
1516,ETCETERA.,"to say."""
1517,ETCETERA.,
1518,ETCETERA.,"Hubert bowed respectfully and withdrew, but soon returned with the"
1519,ETCETERA.,"minstrel, who was instantly recognised by Lady Margaret as a faithful"
1520,ETCETERA.,"retainer of Lord de Vesci, her father; and seeing by his looks that what"
1521,ETCETERA.,he had to communicate was for her ear only; she dismissed all who were
1522,ETCETERA.,"present, and remained alone with him."
1523,ETCETERA.,
1524,ETCETERA.,"""What is it, Rolf,"" she asked in alarm.  ""Why do you come here in"
1525,ETCETERA.,"disguise? what of my father? is he well?"""
1526,ETCETERA.,
1527,ETCETERA.,"""He is well, dear lady.  It is not of him I came to speak.  I am just"
1528,ETCETERA.,"from Wakefield, and I come to warn you to watch well over your sons, for"
1529,ETCETERA.,"the friends of York have sworn, one and all, to take revenge for the"
1530,ETCETERA.,death of young Rutland; and I fear me the threat points towards Lord
1531,ETCETERA.,"Clifford's children.  You must not trust them out of the castle, where"
1532,ETCETERA.,for the present they are safe; but if Edward of York should be made
1533,ETCETERA.,"king, and he is more likely to succeed than his father was, I am afraid"
1534,ETCETERA.,there will be no safety for them even here.  I assumed this disguise
1535,ETCETERA.,because if it became known amongst your enemies that one of your
1536,ETCETERA.,"father's people had come from Wakefield here, they would suspect it was"
1537,ETCETERA.,"to put you on your guard."""
1538,ETCETERA.,
1539,ETCETERA.,"""Now heaven help me!"" said the lady, ""how am I to ward off this"
1540,ETCETERA.,"misfortune?  I must depend on you, my good and faithful Rolf, to keep"
1541,ETCETERA.,"watch, and let me know should any immediate danger threaten us; and, in"
1542,ETCETERA.,"the meanwhile, I will concert some plan for removing my children in case"
1543,ETCETERA.,"of need."""
1544,ETCETERA.,
1545,ETCETERA.,"""This I will do, lady, and as much more as may lie within my power.  In"
1546,ETCETERA.,this minstrel's guise I can visit the camp of the Yorkists from time to
1547,ETCETERA.,"time, and bring you intelligence of what is passing there.  They will"
1548,ETCETERA.,"not know that I am one of your house, and I shall pass free."""
1549,ETCETERA.,
1550,ETCETERA.,"Lady Margaret was truly grateful to the trusty Rolf, who departed from"
1551,ETCETERA.,"the castle that same day; but she confided to none, except the good old"
1552,ETCETERA.,"seneschal, what had been the purport of their conference.  Day after day"
1553,ETCETERA.,"she waited with ill-concealed dread for further tidings, and at length a"
1554,ETCETERA.,"messenger came from her lord, from whom she learned that more battles"
1555,ETCETERA.,"had been fought, that the king was released from prison, but that the"
1556,ETCETERA.,"young Duke of York had been proclaimed king in London, by the title of"
1557,ETCETERA.,Edward the Fourth.  Soon afterwards another messenger arrived with news
1558,ETCETERA.,that King Henry and the queen were again in Yorkshire collecting more
1559,ETCETERA.,"forces, and that King Edward (for there were now two kings) was"
1560,ETCETERA.,advancing northward with a large army to oppose them.  The poor women
1561,ETCETERA.,and children from the neighbouring villages now came flocking for refuge
1562,ETCETERA.,"to Brougham Castle, which was put into a state of defence, for it was"
1563,ETCETERA.,"quite certain there would soon be a great battle, and, if King Edward"
1564,ETCETERA.,"should gain the day, there was but little doubt that the castle would be"
1565,ETCETERA.,besieged.
1566,ETCETERA.,
1567,ETCETERA.,Lord Clifford was now with the king and queen in the city of York.
1568,ETCETERA.,Their army amounted to sixty thousand men; and King Edward was coming
1569,ETCETERA.,"with about fifty thousand, so that the conflict was certain to be a very"
1570,ETCETERA.,"great and terrible one.  It took place at Towton, on Palm Sunday, just"
1571,ETCETERA.,"four months after the battle of Wakefield, and amongst the many"
1572,ETCETERA.,"thousands slain on that dreadful day was Lord Clifford, who was then"
1573,ETCETERA.,scarcely twenty-six years of age.  It is needless to dwell on the grief
1574,ETCETERA.,occasioned by these fatal tidings; it was sad to hear and sad to see.
1575,ETCETERA.,The unhappy lady had now to think of providing for the safety of her
1576,ETCETERA.,"fatherless children, for although Rolf had promised to bring her word if"
1577,ETCETERA.,"he saw they were in danger, there was no certainty of his being able to"
1578,ETCETERA.,"do so, as it was possible he might have been killed himself, for she had"
1579,ETCETERA.,"not heard of him.  At last he came, but it was again in his adopted"
1580,ETCETERA.,"character of a minstrel, and he would have had some difficulty in"
1581,ETCETERA.,"gaining admittance, had it not been for the old seneschal, who guessed"
1582,ETCETERA.,"his errand, and saw that he was allowed to enter, saying that, dismal as"
1583,ETCETERA.,"the times were, it could be no harm to listen to a minstrel's lay."
1584,ETCETERA.,
1585,ETCETERA.,With much caution he conducted him secretly to Lady Clifford's private
1586,ETCETERA.,"apartments, for he thought there might be some hazard in letting it"
1587,ETCETERA.,"become known who he was or why he came, as among the many who were now"
1588,ETCETERA.,"within the castle walls, who could say that all were true."
1589,ETCETERA.,
1590,ETCETERA.,"From Rolf's account it appeared that, after the defeat at Towton, the"
1591,ETCETERA.,"queen had placed her husband, who was half imbecile, in a monastery at"
1592,ETCETERA.,"Edinburgh, and fled with her son, Prince Edward, to France; while the"
1593,ETCETERA.,"new king, Edward the Fourth, had taken full possession of the throne,"
1594,ETCETERA.,and was publicly acknowledged as sovereign of England.  He had declared
1595,ETCETERA.,his intention of seizing the estates of all those nobles who had fought
1596,ETCETERA.,against him; and it was reported that he had said he would revenge the
1597,ETCETERA.,"murder of his brother, young Rutland, on Clifford's heir.  Henry's life"
1598,ETCETERA.,"was therefore now in danger, and Rolf had come to assist in saving him."
1599,ETCETERA.,
1600,ETCETERA.,"""Have you devised any plan, lady,"" said the faithful servant, ""in case"
1601,ETCETERA.,"of this extremity?"""
1602,ETCETERA.,
1603,ETCETERA.,"""Yes, my good Rolf, I have thought of it day and night, ever since that"
1604,ETCETERA.,fatal battle.  I must part from my boy.  I must trust him to you.  Do
1605,ETCETERA.,"you think you can convey him, without suspicion, to his nurse Maud, at"
1606,ETCETERA.,"Skipton?  I can depend on her to be careful of my child, and on her"
1607,ETCETERA.,"husband also; but they must not remain there, they must remove to"
1608,ETCETERA.,"Londesborough, and you must go yourself to my father, who is now there,"
1609,ETCETERA.,"and tell him from me to provide them with a dwelling, but not to notice"
1610,ETCETERA.,"the boy as his grandson, for Henry must pass for Maud's own child."
1611,ETCETERA.,"Think you, Rolf, that you can accomplish all this?"""
1612,ETCETERA.,
1613,ETCETERA.,"""I will try, my lady; but we must speak of it to Lord Henry, that he may"
1614,ETCETERA.,understand his life depends on its not being known that he is Lord
1615,ETCETERA.,"Clifford's son."""
1616,ETCETERA.,
1617,ETCETERA.,"""My Henry is wise beyond his years,"" replied the lady, ""and I fear me"
1618,ETCETERA.,"not that he will submit to this necessity without a murmur."""
1619,ETCETERA.,
1620,ETCETERA.,"""No doubt, no doubt, dear lady; and you had better prepare him at once,"
1621,ETCETERA.,"for we know not how soon the blow may come."""
1622,ETCETERA.,
1623,ETCETERA.,"""My Henry,"" said Lady Margaret, ""you are going to Skipton, to your good"
1624,ETCETERA.,"nurse Maud, who will take you to Londesborough, where you must live with"
1625,ETCETERA.,"her and her husband till there is peace again in the land, which we will"
1626,ETCETERA.,"both earnestly pray for.  And you must remember, my child, that you are"
1627,ETCETERA.,"to pass for Maud's own son, and that you are to call her mother, and her"
1628,ETCETERA.,"husband, Robin, the shepherd, father.  I have already explained to you"
1629,ETCETERA.,"what would be the terrible consequences should you ever forget this."""
1630,ETCETERA.,
1631,ETCETERA.,"""I will not forget, mother; but shall I never see you there?  I love"
1632,ETCETERA.,"Maud very much, but not as I love you, my own dear mother!"""
1633,ETCETERA.,
1634,ETCETERA.,"And the noble boy threw himself into his mother's arms, laid his head"
1635,ETCETERA.,"upon her bosom, and burst into tears.  She kissed him tenderly, and"
1636,ETCETERA.,endeavoured to speak cheerfully.
1637,ETCETERA.,
1638,ETCETERA.,"""My darling boy, this separation is only for the present, and I hope I"
1639,ETCETERA.,"shall be able to see you sometimes, for I intend, after awhile, to live"
1640,ETCETERA.,"at Londesborough, which is mine, and may some day be yours; but not yet,"
1641,ETCETERA.,not till our enemies believe that you and your brother are far away
1642,ETCETERA.,"beyond the seas; and even then, when I come to visit you, Henry, no one"
1643,ETCETERA.,must know it except ourselves and nurse; for if it came to be known that
1644,ETCETERA.,"I felt any interest about the shepherd's boy, the people might suspect"
1645,ETCETERA.,"who you are, and that is what we have to guard against."""
1646,ETCETERA.,
1647,ETCETERA.,"""And Richard, mother--is he to go away too?"""
1648,ETCETERA.,
1649,ETCETERA.,"""Yes, Henry, I must part with you both--but your little sister I may"
1650,ETCETERA.,"keep with me; it is not her life they seek.  And now, my beloved child,"
1651,ETCETERA.,you understand what it is you have to do--keep up a brave heart and
1652,ETCETERA.,"endeavour not to repine at your lot, but be thankful you have not fallen"
1653,ETCETERA.,"into the hands of those who would show you no mercy.  But above all, my"
1654,ETCETERA.,"son, put your trust in God, and pray to him that happier days may come,"
1655,ETCETERA.,"when we can be together again without fear or concealment."""
1656,ETCETERA.,
1657,ETCETERA.,"The next day after this conversation, Lady Clifford left Brougham"
1658,ETCETERA.,"Castle, with her three children, her maid Cicely, old Hubert, and a few"
1659,ETCETERA.,"trusty attendants on whose fidelity she could rely, but not even to them"
1660,ETCETERA.,"did she reveal her son's destination, which was only known to her"
1661,ETCETERA.,"faithful seneschal.  The lady, with her maid and the children, travelled"
1662,ETCETERA.,"in a litter, a sort of light van shut in with curtains, which, at that"
1663,ETCETERA.,"period, when coaches were unknown, was often used by invalids and those"
1664,ETCETERA.,who did not want to travel on horseback.  The litter for one person was
1665,ETCETERA.,"sometimes slung on poles and carried by men, but a large one, containing"
1666,ETCETERA.,"more than one traveller, was usually mounted on wheels and drawn by"
1667,ETCETERA.,horses.  It had been arranged that Rolf should meet Lady Clifford's
1668,ETCETERA.,"party in a forest, between Brougham Castle and York, and that he should"
1669,ETCETERA.,"bring with him a peasant boy's coarse woollen dress, to disguise Henry"
1670,ETCETERA.,"for his flight; and oh, how sad were the hearts of the mother and son"
1671,ETCETERA.,when they came in sight of the tall trees of that forest where they were
1672,ETCETERA.,to part for they knew not how long!  The path was wide enough to admit
1673,ETCETERA.,"of the vehicle, and they had not gone far when Rolf met them.  He was"
1674,ETCETERA.,"not in his minstrel's dress, so that the people did not know him.  He"
1675,ETCETERA.,"came to the side of the litter, and spoke in a low tone to the lady, who"
1676,ETCETERA.,"called one of her attendants, and said to him--"
1677,ETCETERA.,
1678,ETCETERA.,"""This good man brings me word that it will not be safe for us to go to"
1679,ETCETERA.,"York, therefore I shall alter my course and proceed at once to the"
1680,ETCETERA.,"sea-coast, and take ship for the Netherlands.  He also thinks that it"
1681,ETCETERA.,"would be better we should not all travel together, therefore I shall"
1682,ETCETERA.,send on my eldest son with him and Hubert.  He has a conveyance waiting
1683,ETCETERA.,"close by in the forest, and when I have seen them off, I will return"
1684,ETCETERA.,"here.  You can, meanwhile, rest and refresh yourselves, for we have a"
1685,ETCETERA.,"long day's journey yet before us."""
1686,ETCETERA.,
1687,ETCETERA.,"The men, who were glad of this respite, dismounted, and began to unpack"
1688,ETCETERA.,"the provisions with which they were plentifully provided, whilst the"
1689,ETCETERA.,"sorrowful lady, leading her son by the hand, accompanied by Hubert,"
1690,ETCETERA.,"followed Rolf, who led them to a spot quite hidden from the view of the"
1691,ETCETERA.,"rest of the party, where a small cart, such as was used by the villagers"
1692,ETCETERA.,"in their rural occupations, was really in waiting."
1693,ETCETERA.,
1694,ETCETERA.,This was indeed a trying moment.  The young lord was now to be
1695,ETCETERA.,"transformed into the peasant boy--his long bright curls were cut off,"
1696,ETCETERA.,his face and hands were stained with a brown liquid to make him look
1697,ETCETERA.,"sunburnt, as if he was used to work in the fields, and his rich velvet"
1698,ETCETERA.,apparel was changed for coarse homespun woollen cloth.  But he cared not
1699,ETCETERA.,what they put him on--his only thought was that he was going away from
1700,ETCETERA.,"his beloved mother, perhaps never to see her more.  He clasped his arms"
1701,ETCETERA.,"round her neck and clung to her sobbing, as if his heart would break,"
1702,ETCETERA.,"and the tears were streaming down her cheeks too, as she fell on her"
1703,ETCETERA.,knees and murmured a prayer that heaven would watch over and protect her
1704,ETCETERA.,fatherless boy.
1705,ETCETERA.,
1706,ETCETERA.,"""My lady--my dear lady,"" said old Hubert; ""you must not stay here"
1707,ETCETERA.,longer--the sooner this parting is over the better it will be for you
1708,ETCETERA.,"both.  Come, my Lord Henry, it is time we were moving."""
1709,ETCETERA.,
1710,ETCETERA.,So saying he gently disengaged the boy from his mother's encircling arms
1711,ETCETERA.,"and lifted him into the cart, making a private signal to Rolf to drive"
1712,ETCETERA.,away as fast as he could.  He then respectfully entreated his unhappy
1713,ETCETERA.,"lady to return to her party, and she, scarcely conscious of what she was"
1714,ETCETERA.,"doing, suffered him to lead her back, and as soon as he had seen her"
1715,ETCETERA.,"safely placed in the litter with Cicely and the two children, he mounted"
1716,ETCETERA.,"his horse and galloped off as if to join Rolf and his young charge, but"
1717,ETCETERA.,"in reality to take quite another route, for Henry was to pass, during"
1718,ETCETERA.,"this journey, for a poor boy whom Rolf was taking home to his native"
1719,ETCETERA.,"village, and it would not have done for him to be attended by Lady"
1720,ETCETERA.,Clifford's seneschal.
1721,ETCETERA.,
1722,ETCETERA.,"It was well he had been sent away, for just about this time King Edward"
1723,ETCETERA.,caused an act of attainder to be passed against all the noblemen who had
1724,ETCETERA.,"fought for the cause of Henry the Seventh, that is, they were deprived"
1725,ETCETERA.,"of their titles, and their estates were declared forfeited to the crown;"
1726,ETCETERA.,he also issued a command that the children of the attainted nobles
1727,ETCETERA.,"should be sent to London to be disposed of, as he, the king, should"
1728,ETCETERA.,think fit; and this was probably done for the very purpose of getting
1729,ETCETERA.,Clifford's children into his power; for no sooner had Lady Clifford
1730,ETCETERA.,"taken up her abode with her father, the aged Lord de Vesci, than she was"
1731,ETCETERA.,"summoned to London, and closely questioned as to what had become of her"
1732,ETCETERA.,"boys.  She said she had sent them out of the country, but as she had"
1733,ETCETERA.,"heard nothing of them since, she did not know whether they were alive or"
1734,ETCETERA.,"dead, and so the retreat of the high-born shepherd boy remained unknown."
1735,ETCETERA.,But all the castles and broad lands that were his by right of
1736,ETCETERA.,inheritance were given to the enemies of his family.  The Barony of
1737,ETCETERA.,"Westmoreland, with Brougham Castle, was bestowed by Edward on his"
1738,ETCETERA.,"brother Richard Duke of York, afterwards Richard the Third; and the"
1739,ETCETERA.,"great manor of Shipton was conferred on Sir William Stanley, who, at a"
1740,ETCETERA.,"later period, went over to the Lancasterian party himself, and you may"
1741,ETCETERA.,"read in Shakespeare's play of ""Richard the Third,"" that it was he who,"
1742,ETCETERA.,"after the battle of Bosworth, where Richard was killed, picked up the"
1743,ETCETERA.,"crown and placed it on the victor's head, saying, ""Long live Henry the"
1744,ETCETERA.,"Seventh!""  We shall presently see what this event had to do with our"
1745,ETCETERA.,"hero, Henry de Clifford."
1746,ETCETERA.,
1747,II.,II.
1748,II.,
1749,II.,"Londesborough was a beautiful place in the county of York, about sixteen"
1750,II.,"miles from York city.  Lord de Vesci had other and larger estates, but"
1751,II.,"as his dignity of baron was limited to male heirs, his daughter could"
1752,II.,"only inherit two of his possessions, and Londesborough was one of them,"
1753,II.,consequently young Henry de Clifford was its next heir in right of his
1754,II.,"mother.  He knew this, yet so well had his mind been trained by that"
1755,II.,"excellent parent, that he was content to live in a shepherd's cot"
1756,II.,"outside its gates with Robin and Maud, whom he soon became accustomed to"
1757,II.,"call father and mother.  As they had come from Skipton, and brought with"
1758,II.,"them two little children of their own, the people of the hamlet where"
1759,II.,"they were now settled, did not know but that Henry was their eldest son,"
1760,II.,and the little ones were so young that they were easily taught to
1761,II.,"believe he was their brother.  He wore a shepherd's frock of grey serge,"
1762,II.,"fastened round the waist by a leather belt, with half-boots made of"
1763,II.,untanned deer-skin; and every morning he went out with his foster-father
1764,II.,"to mind the flocks, taking with him, in a little wallet slung over his"
1765,II.,"shoulder, his mid-day meal, which he would eat as he sat on some grassy"
1766,II.,"mound, or by the side of a rivulet, from which he could fill his horn"
1767,II.,cup with water.  How different was this from the costly banquet in his
1768,II.,"father's hall, where he had servants to attend upon him, and drank out"
1769,II.,"of a goblet of gold or silver.  Yet he did not repine, but performed his"
1770,II.,"duties with a willing spirit, and instead of thinking his lot was a hard"
1771,II.,"one, he often reflected how much worse it would have been if he had"
1772,II.,fallen into the hands of his father's foes; still he could not help
1773,II.,"feeling melancholy at times, for he longed to see his dear mother again,"
1774,II.,"and more than two months had passed, yet she came not.  There was no"
1775,II.,"occasion now to stain his hands and face, for the sun had embrowned them"
1776,II.,"quite enough, and his long curls had been suffered to grow again, for"
1777,II.,"Maud said it was a great pity to cut them off, and she was proud of"
1778,II.,"hearing her neighbours say what nice hair her boy had got, and she would"
1779,II.,answer--
1780,II.,
1781,II.,"""Ay, my goodman tells me I take over much pride in Henry's curly locks,"
1782,II.,"but he is my eldest, and sure it is natural for a mother to take"
1783,II.,"pleasure in the beauty of her child, and, though I say it, he is as"
1784,II.,"pretty a boy, and as good too, as any in the village."""
1785,II.,
1786,II.,"One evening Henry had brought home the sheep, and having seen them safe"
1787,II.,"in the fold, was sitting on the ground outside the cottage door eating"
1788,II.,"his supper.  One arm rested on the neck of a large dog, that was idly"
1789,II.,"reposing by his side, as if tired with the toils of the day, for it was"
1790,II.,"the shepherd's dog, and its duty was to guard the flocks as they were"
1791,II.,"feeding in the fields, and warn his master if any danger seemed near"
1792,II.,them.  At length the boy arose and walked slowly towards the entrance of
1793,II.,"a fair domain, where he stood gazing with tearful eyes through a long"
1794,II.,"vista of tall oaks, on a noble mansion standing on the summit of a"
1795,II.,"verdant slope, and his young heart was oppressed with unusual sadness as"
1796,II.,he looked wistfully on this his rightful home.  He had stood there for
1797,II.,some time when his foster-father came up and laid his hand kindly on his
1798,II.,shoulder.
1799,II.,
1800,II.,"""Come, my boy, you are giving way to idle regrets.  I do not like to see"
1801,II.,"you here, Henry, for I know your thoughts are not what they should be."""
1802,II.,
1803,II.,"""I know it is wrong, father, but I cannot help it sometimes."""
1804,II.,
1805,II.,"""Whenever this feeling comes over you, Henry, try to drive it from you,"
1806,II.,"and think of the past as if it had been but a dream.  A dark prison, my"
1807,II.,"boy, would have been a worse dwelling-place than a thatched cottage."
1808,II.,"Think of that, and be content."""
1809,II.,
1810,II.,"""Indeed I am content, father, for you are very kind to me.  But when, oh"
1811,II.,"when, do you think my own dear mother will come?"""
1812,II.,
1813,II.,"""Nay, I cannot tell; but let us hope it will not be, long first.  And"
1814,II.,"now, Henry, come home and go to your bed, for the sun is set, and you"
1815,II.,"must be up betimes.  See, here is Lion coming to meet us.  Poor Lion! he"
1816,II.,"does not like to lose sight of his master."""
1817,II.,
1818,II.,"Henry, who had dried his tears and was smiling again, sprang forward to"
1819,II.,"caress the faithful dog, who frolicked round him as if he thought he had"
1820,II.,"been long away, and was rejoiced at his return.  Maud had put aside her"
1821,II.,"spinning-wheel, for it was nearly dark; the two younger children were"
1822,II.,"already asleep, and Henry was about to retire to rest, when the door was"
1823,II.,"opened softly, and there entered one whose form was muffled in a long"
1824,II.,"dark cloak, the hood of which was drawn over the head to conceal the"
1825,II.,face from view.  Robin and Maud trembled with fear as the idea struck
1826,II.,"them both that the boy's retreat had been discovered; but Henry, with"
1827,II.,"the true instinct of affection, uttered the word ""mother!"" and rushed"
1828,II.,"into the arms of the mysterious visitant, who threw off her disguise,"
1829,II.,and clasped her boy fondly to her bosom.
1830,II.,
1831,II.,"""My honoured lady!"" exclaimed Maud, as she recognised the beautiful, but"
1832,II.,pale and careworn countenance of her mistress.
1833,II.,
1834,II.,"""Hush!  Maud, hush!"" said the lady; ""are you sure we are quite safe?"""
1835,II.,
1836,II.,"""Yes, madam, we are safe,"" answered Robin, ""there is no one within"
1837,II.,"hearing, and I will fasten the door, so that none shall enter without"
1838,II.,"giving notice."""
1839,II.,
1840,II.,"And so saying he proceeded to make all secure, whilst Henry laughed and"
1841,II.,"wept by turns in the excess of his joy, and, amidst kisses and embraces,"
1842,II.,asked many questions about his brother and sister.
1843,II.,
1844,II.,"""I hope they are both well, my darling.  Elizabeth I have seen lately,"
1845,II.,but I have not heard of Richard since his arrival in the Low Countries.
1846,II.,"Nevertheless, I trust he is safe and well.  But how fares it with you,"
1847,II.,"my best and dearest?  Can you make yourself happy in this new life?"""
1848,II.,
1849,II.,"""As happy as I can be away from you, dear mother.  I do not mind the"
1850,II.,sort of life I lead so much as I thought I should; for I am getting used
1851,II.,"to it now."""
1852,II.,
1853,II.,"""In truth he takes to it bravely, my lady,"" said Robin.  ""I only hope my"
1854,II.,"own lad will be as good a shepherd as Henry, when he is as old."""
1855,II.,
1856,II.,"Lady Margaret sighed deeply, for although the worthy man did not mean to"
1857,II.,"give her pain, but rather pleasure, by this rough applause, she could"
1858,II.,not help feeling how very low the fortunes of De Clifford's son had
1859,II.,"fallen.  But she did not make this thought apparent, she folded him"
1860,II.,"closer to her heart, and whispered words of encouragement and praise."
1861,II.,
1862,II.,"""You have shown yourself a true hero, Henry, for nothing is more noble"
1863,II.,"than to bear misfortune nobly, and this you have done.  I am proud of my"
1864,II.,"son, and should you ever be permitted by Providence to take your own"
1865,II.,"name again, you will be doubly worthy of it."""
1866,II.,
1867,II.,"""And that time will come, my lady,"" said Maud, fervently, ""as sure as"
1868,II.,"there are stars in yonder heavens!"""
1869,II.,
1870,II.,"""We will hope so, Maud.  And how shall I thank you for the care you have"
1871,II.,taken of my treasure? he looks well; the bloom of health is on his
1872,II.,"cheek.  I would fain give you some token of my gratitude, if I durst do"
1873,II.,"so."""
1874,II.,
1875,II.,"""Better not, my lady,"" said Robin in his blunt way.  ""Besides it is for"
1876,II.,"us, not you, lady, to talk of gratitude, since we owe all that we"
1877,II.,"possess to your goodness.  Even this cottage we live in, was it not your"
1878,II.,"gift?  It would be hard, then, if your child should meet with aught but"
1879,II.,"kindness beneath its roof."""
1880,II.,
1881,II.,"Lady Clifford did not stay long, fearing that her absence from her own"
1882,II.,"abode might be discovered, and lead to suspicion; but she said she was"
1883,II.,"going to stay some time at Londesborough, and should pay a visit to the"
1884,II.,cottage whenever she saw an opportunity of doing so without risk.  For a
1885,II.,few weeks she often came at nightfall without attracting the notice of
1886,II.,"the villagers; but at length she was obliged to leave Londesborough, and"
1887,II.,"Henry saw her no more for a very long while.  By degrees, however, he"
1888,II.,"grew reconciled to her absence, and, as time wore on, the events of his"
1889,II.,"early life were less distinctly remembered, until he could almost"
1890,II.,believe that his former grandeur had never been a reality.  He often
1891,II.,"thought of his brother, and wondered where he was, and whether he was"
1892,II.,"living like a peasant too, for he did not know till long afterwards that"
1893,II.,poor little Richard died soon after he was sent out of England.
1894,II.,
1895,II.,"When Henry was about fourteen, the death of his grandfather, Lord de"
1896,II.,"Vesci, brought new dangers upon him, for a rumour got spread abroad that"
1897,II.,"he was still live and in England, and, as he was the rightful heir to"
1898,II.,"all the estates as well as the honours of the Bromfletes, the king's"
1899,II.,"emissaries began to inquire into the matter, and make search in"
1900,II.,"different parts of the country, where it was supposed he might be"
1901,II.,concealed.  This alarming intelligence was first conveyed to his mother
1902,II.,"by the faithful Rolf, who, you remember, was one of the old Lord de"
1903,II.,"Vesci's people, and devotedly attached to Lady Clifford.  But she was"
1904,II.,"not Lady Clifford now, for she was married to a noble knight named Sir"
1905,II.,"Lancelot Threlkeld, whose domain was in the mountainous part of"
1906,II.,"Cumberland, and was called Threlkeld.  He was a kind-hearted, noble"
1907,II.,"gentleman, and, as he had not taken an active part in the wars, he had"
1908,II.,"been left in possession of his lands and dignities, and was living"
1909,II.,"quietly on his own estate, when he offered his hand to the widowed Lady"
1910,II.,"Clifford, who consented to become his wife because she knew he would be"
1911,II.,"a friend to her dear boy, and they were married soon after the lady went"
1912,II.,away from Londesborough.
1913,II.,
1914,II.,As soon as they heard that King Edward had instituted a search for the
1915,II.,"young heir, Sir Lancelot proposed to his lady to remove Robin the"
1916,II.,"shepherd, with all his family, including Henry, from Londesborough to"
1917,II.,"the hills of Cumberland, and settle them as near as possible to"
1918,II.,Threlkeld.
1919,II.,
1920,II.,"Robin and Maud had now five children of their own, who all looked up to"
1921,II.,"Henry as their elder brother, and, as he was always kind and"
1922,II.,"good-natured amongst them, treating them exactly as if they had been his"
1923,II.,"brothers and sisters, they were very fond of him, nor did they ever"
1924,II.,suppose he was not the child of their parents.  It was the beautiful
1925,II.,"summer-time when Sir Lancelot Threlkeld paid a visit to Londesborough,"
1926,II.,"and sent for Robin, to whom he told what had happened, and explained his"
1927,II.,designs.
1928,II.,
1929,II.,"""The boy is no longer safe here,"" he said; ""his life may depend on his"
1930,II.,"immediate removal, but it must be very cautiously done.  I shall tell"
1931,II.,the people here that we have increased our flocks at Threlkeld so that
1932,II.,"we want more shepherds there, and have fixed on Robin, whose three sons,"
1933,II.,"being active lads, will be very useful.  What think you of this plan?"""
1934,II.,
1935,II.,"""It is good,"" replied the shepherd.  ""But you will see Henry yourself,"
1936,II.,"my noble lord?""  (It was thus he styled his lady's husband, whose"
1937,II.,servant he now deemed himself to be.)
1938,II.,
1939,II.,"""No, I think not,"" returned the knight; ""it would please me much, but it"
1940,II.,will be better for him that I should not seem to think about him at all.
1941,II.,"There may be spies on the watch to take note of my movements, and if"
1942,II.,"only the shadow of a suspicion should be awakened, all would be lost."
1943,II.,We should have no power to save him then.  How soon can you be ready to
1944,II.,"commence the journey?"""
1945,II.,
1946,II.,"""To-morrow if you will, my lord."""
1947,II.,
1948,II.,"""To-morrow let it be then, and may heaven send us a safe deliverance"
1949,II.,"from this peril!"""
1950,II.,
1951,II.,"""Amen!"" responded the peasant, devoutly crossing himself.  ""It will be a"
1952,II.,"happy day for me, and my dame too, should we live to see our Henry"
1953,II.,"restored to his rights."""
1954,II.,
1955,II.,"The worthy knight shook his head as he replied, ""I fear me there is but"
1956,II.,"small chance of that.  The king is a young man; he is popular, and has"
1957,II.,"sons to succeed him, and so long as there is one of the line of York to"
1958,II.,"hold the sceptre of England, the house of De Clifford will be under a"
1959,II.,"ban."""
1960,II.,
1961,II.,"""Time, with the aid of Providence, works wonders, my lord."""
1962,II.,
1963,II.,"""True, good Robin, true; but there is not much at present to encourage"
1964,II.,"such hopes, and I would not have you speak thus to Henry."""
1965,II.,
1966,II.,"""There would be little wisdom, indeed, in that,"" replied Robin smiling."
1967,II.,"""Shall I tell him I have seen you, my lord?"""
1968,II.,
1969,II.,"""Yes, surely--and you can tell him, also, why I thought it prudent to"
1970,II.,"depart without seeing him, for I would not have him think me careless or"
1971,II.,"unkind."""
1972,II.,
1973,II.,"He then gave Robin money for his journey, and when all was arranged the"
1974,II.,"good man took his leave, and Sir Lancelot Threlkeld departed from"
1975,II.,Londesborough that same day.
1976,II.,
1977,II.,It was joyful news for Henry to hear that he was going to live so near
1978,II.,to his own dear mother again.  In the gladness of his heart he was
1979,II.,"almost inclined to regard his enemies in the light of friends, since"
1980,II.,"they had been the cause of this happy change.  Maud was very glad too,"
1981,II.,"for anything that gave pleasure to Henry was always pleasing to her,"
1982,II.,"besides which she was devotedly attached to Lady Margaret, and rejoiced"
1983,II.,in the thought of being settled in a place where she would see her more
1984,II.,"frequently than she had done of late, and as for the children, they were"
1985,II.,"almost out of their wits with delight, for young folks were quite as"
1986,II.,fond of novelty four hundred years ago as they are now.
1987,II.,
1988,II.,"The journey was a long and a rough one, as travellers of a humble class"
1989,II.,"could not get on very fast in those days when there were no roads, and"
1990,II.,"it was often a difficult matter to make their way through forests, or"
1991,II.,"over wide tracts of waste land where the ground was rugged, uneven, and"
1992,II.,covered with brushwood.  The vast forests which then existed in the
1993,II.,"north of England, have long since been cleared away, and wild trackless"
1994,II.,"heaths have been converted into parks, meadows, and corn-fields.  Maud"
1995,II.,and the two girls rode in a waggon wherein they had placed some wooden
1996,II.,"stools, several baskets of provision, and all their clothing, with such"
1997,II.,"other things as they wished to take with them.  Robin drove, while Henry"
1998,II.,"and the other boys took it in turns to ride one at a time, the rest"
1999,II.,"walking by the side of the clumsy vehicle, which could only proceed at a"
2000,II.,"foot pace, so that their progress was but slow.  They had taken care to"
2001,II.,"put plenty of rushes in the waggon, so that some of them might sleep"
2002,II.,"comfortably in it at night, while Robin and the elder lads, as it was"
2003,II.,"summer-time, and warm, dry weather, could rest under the trees, wrapped"
2004,II.,"in their shepherd's cloaks.  In this manner they proceeded, sometimes"
2005,II.,"halting at the villages to get a fresh supply of food and water, until"
2006,II.,"at length they reached their destination, a small farm in a beautiful"
2007,II.,"and romantic part of Cumberland, close to the borders of Scotland, but"
2008,II.,"still within the domain of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, which extended far"
2009,II.,and wide.  You may be sure it was not long before our hero was again
2010,II.,"clasped to the heart of his fond mother, who, however, as before, only"
2011,II.,visited him in secret and under cover of the night.  She was sometimes
2012,II.,"accompanied by Sir Lancelot, who was a kind-hearted man, and had always"
2013,II.,been well disposed towards the noble youth whom he delighted to call his
2014,II.,"son when they were alone, but at all other times he only noticed him as"
2015,II.,one of his shepherds.
2016,II.,
2017,II.,"Much of Henry's time was spent in solitude, as he watched his flocks"
2018,II.,"feeding on the mountains, and being of a meditative disposition, he"
2019,II.,thought much and deeply of the beautiful works of the Great Creator that
2020,II.,"he beheld around him.  Though wholly unlettered, though he could neither"
2021,II.,"read nor write, he possessed a native nobleness of mind that raised him"
2022,II.,far above the class to which he seemingly belonged; yet his manners were
2023,II.,"plain and simple, nor did the knowledge of his high birth ever lead him"
2024,II.,to assume an air of superiority over the peasants with whom he was
2025,II.,associated.  In his solitary musings he thought so much about the
2026,II.,"wonders of the earth, the sea, and the skies, that he became quite a"
2027,II.,natural philosopher; but his chief delight was in the contemplation of
2028,II.,"the heavenly bodies, and he would watch the moon in her course, or gaze"
2029,II.,for hours on the myriads of stars that shone in the blue vault above
2030,II.,"him, until he acquired an ardent taste for the sublime study of"
2031,II.,"astronomy, in which he indulged to the full at a later period of his"
2032,II.,existence.
2033,II.,
2034,II.,"And so the time passed on, bringing no change to Henry de Clifford, save"
2035,II.,"the gradual increase of years, that transformed the slight delicate"
2036,II.,"youth into the well-grown, powerful man, whose fine form, handsome face,"
2037,II.,"and gentle manners won the hearts of the rustic maidens, and matrons"
2038,II.,"too, of Threlkeld."
2039,II.,
2040,II.,"His foster-brothers and sisters, one by one, married amongst the"
2041,II.,"villagers belonging to Sir Lancelot's estate, so that, at last, Henry"
2042,II.,was left alone with the worthy pair he called his father and mother.
2043,II.,
2044,II.,"In the meanwhile many stirring events were passing in England, though"
2045,II.,little was heard about them in the remote and quiet regions of
2046,II.,Threlkeld.  The wars of the Roses had never wholly ceased.  There had
2047,II.,"been some peaceful intervals, but they had not lasted for long together,"
2048,II.,"as Queen Margaret, assisted by the great Earl of Warwick, the most"
2049,II.,"powerful baron in the kingdom, had resolved never to give up the cause"
2050,II.,so long as the least chance remained of replacing her husband on the
2051,II.,"throne, and securing the right of succession to her son.  The Earl of"
2052,II.,"Warwick had at first fought for the Duke of York, and it was through his"
2053,II.,"power and influence that Edward the Fourth was made king, for he had"
2054,II.,more men and more money at his command than any other nobleman in the
2055,II.,"country.  However, King Edward was unwise enough to quarrel with this"
2056,II.,"high and mighty earl, who thereupon went over to the queen's party, and"
2057,II.,"actually restored the poor, weak-minded King Henry the Sixth to the"
2058,II.,throne; on which Edward went over to Holland to get assistance of the
2059,II.,"Duke of Burgundy, his brother-in-law, who placed an army of foreigners"
2060,II.,"at his command, with which he came back to England, and being joined by"
2061,II.,"many of his partisans, a great battle was fought, in which the Earl of"
2062,II.,Warwick was slain.  This event took place exactly ten years after the
2063,II.,"battle of Towton, where Lord Clifford fell.  King Henry was then sent"
2064,II.,"back a prisoner to the Tower, where he soon died; but Queen Margaret,"
2065,II.,"who had just arrived from France, with Prince Edward, her son, who was"
2066,II.,"then seventeen years old, resolved for his sake to make one more effort;"
2067,II.,"but it would have been better for him and for her too, if they had given"
2068,II.,"up this hopeless cause, and gone back to the court of her father, who"
2069,II.,"was King of Anjou in France, for the battle was lost, the young prince"
2070,II.,"was made prisoner, and being taken into the royal tent, the king spoke"
2071,II.,to him so rudely that he was provoked to answer with more spirit than he
2072,II.,"had been expected, on which some of the nobles who were standing by"
2073,II.,fiercely drew their daggers and killed him on the spot.
2074,II.,
2075,II.,"The unhappy queen having no one to care for, gave up the contest, and"
2076,II.,"went to end her days in France, and for thirteen years afterwards there"
2077,II.,"was no more open warfare in England; but there were still two parties,"
2078,II.,"so that the White and the Red Rose were badges of enmity as before, for"
2079,II.,"it was natural enough that all who, like the De Cliffords, had suffered"
2080,II.,"from the success of the Yorkists, should wish to see the line of"
2081,II.,"Lancaster restored.  The existing heir of that family was Henry, Earl of"
2082,II.,"Richmond, who was an exile in France, when Edward the Fourth died,"
2083,II.,"leaving two sons, the eldest only eleven years of age.  These were the"
2084,II.,"two little princes that were sent to the Tower by their cruel, ambitious"
2085,II.,"uncle, Richard the Third, who contrived that they should both die there,"
2086,II.,that he might wear the crown himself; but he had reigned very little
2087,II.,"more than two years when some of the great nobles, disgusted by his"
2088,II.,"tyranny, sent word to the Earl of Richmond that, if he came to England,"
2089,II.,"with a view to dethrone the usurper, he would find plenty of friends"
2090,II.,ready to assist him.  The earl was soon here at the head of a large
2091,II.,"army, and met King Richard at Bosworth in Leicestershire, where the"
2092,II.,great battle was fought that put an end to the War of the Roses and to
2093,II.,the life of Richard the Third.
2094,II.,
2095,II.,You remember that when Edward the Fourth deprived the Cliffords of their
2096,II.,"lands and honours, the great manor of Skipton, with its fine old castle,"
2097,II.,was given to Sir William Stanley.  This brave knight had remained
2098,II.,"faithful to King Edward, but he was amongst those who turned against"
2099,II.,"Richard; and it was he who, when the fight was over and the victory won,"
2100,II.,"took up the crown, which it appears, Richard had worn on the field, and"
2101,II.,"placed it on Richmond's head, calling out aloud, ""Long live King Henry"
2102,II.,"the Seventh!""  And this cry passed from one to another till the air"
2103,II.,"resounded with the shouts of the victors, who thus proclaimed the new"
2104,II.,sovereign on the battle plain.  When this momentous event took place
2105,II.,Henry de Clifford was about thirty years of age.  He had now dwelt for
2106,II.,"sixteen years amongst the mountains of Cumberland, and one thing only"
2107,II.,had occurred to disturb the even tenor of his peaceful life.
2108,II.,
2109,II.,"A gentleman of noble family and good estate, Sir John Saint John, of"
2110,II.,"Bletso, in Bedfordshire, came on a visit to Threlkeld with his daughter"
2111,II.,"Anne, a fair girl in the bloom of youth and beauty.  Henry, who had seen"
2112,II.,"her riding out over the hills with her father and Sir Lancelot, thought"
2113,II.,"he had never beheld so lovely a maiden; and he was right, for in all"
2114,II.,England there were few to compare with Anne of Bletso.  She had seen him
2115,II.,"too, and had observed how far superior he was in appearance to other"
2116,II.,"rustic swains, for the shepherd's frock of homely grey could not conceal"
2117,II.,"the graces of his person, which also attracted the notice of the worthy"
2118,II.,"knight, her father, who, on one occasion, said to Sir Lancelot--"
2119,II.,
2120,II.,"""That is a well-favoured youth of yours; I have seen a face like his"
2121,II.,"before, but I cannot bethink me where or when, yet it is no common face"
2122,II.,"either."""
2123,II.,
2124,II.,"""He is the son of my chief shepherd,"" replied Sir Lancelot; ""he was"
2125,II.,"always a good-looking lad, and is an excellent servant."""
2126,II.,
2127,II.,"Then, anxious to divert Sir John's attention from Henry, whose handsome"
2128,II.,"features he feared might remind the knight of the late Lord Clifford,"
2129,II.,"whom his son strongly resembled, he began to talk of other things.  But"
2130,II.,"Henry did not forget the sweet face of the young lady, or the beautiful"
2131,II.,"eyes he had seen fixed intently upon him, eyes as bright as the stars he"
2132,II.,"was so fond of gazing upon, and he could not help feeling sad to think"
2133,II.,the fates had placed him in a sphere so much beneath her.
2134,II.,
2135,II.,"It chanced one day as he watched his flocks feeding on the mountains, he"
2136,II.,"saw the damsel on her white palfrey, attended by a single page, riding"
2137,II.,"direct towards the spot where he was reclining in profound meditation,"
2138,II.,"beneath the spreading branches of a luxuriant oak, that shielded him"
2139,II.,"from the noonday sun.  He rose at her approach, and took off his cap,"
2140,II.,displaying a rich profusion of nut-brown hair as he gracefully made his
2141,II.,"obeisance, supposing she would pass by with merely a slight notice,"
2142,II.,therefore he blushed with surprise and pleasure when she stopped her
2143,II.,"horse, and said in the sweetest tone imaginable--"
2144,II.,
2145,II.,"""Good day, shepherd Henry; I come to ask a service of you."""
2146,II.,
2147,II.,"""If I can render you service, lady, you may command me, even to the"
2148,II.,"peril of my life."""
2149,II.,
2150,II.,"""Nay, I would not have you peril your life for my behoof,"" she replied,"
2151,II.,with a smile.
2152,II.,
2153,II.,"""In riding over the hills this morning, I have lost a golden clasp, with"
2154,II.,"three diamonds, that fastened my gorget, and I would ask you, should you"
2155,II.,"meet with such a bauble in your ramblings, to carry it to the Lady"
2156,II.,"Margaret of Threlkeld, who will see that it is restored to me."""
2157,II.,
2158,II.,"""Lady I will not fail to do your bidding.  Few persons traverse those"
2159,II.,"hills, and I doubt not the jewel may be recovered."""
2160,II.,
2161,II.,"""Thanks, gentle shepherd.  We leave Threlkeld this day; so farewell, and"
2162,II.,"be assured your courtesy will not be forgotten by Anne of Bletso."""
2163,II.,
2164,II.,"That night, by moonlight, Henry wandered over the hills in search of the"
2165,II.,"lost treasure, and for many hours he sought in vain; but at length, oh"
2166,II.,"joyful sight! he saw the diamonds glittering in the moonbeams, at the"
2167,II.,"bottom of a deep ravine, and without a moment's hesitation he commenced"
2168,II.,the dangerous descent.  A single false step and he would have been
2169,II.,"dashed to pieces against the sharp points of the craggy rock, but with a"
2170,II.,"steady hand and firm foot he gained the depth in safety, seized the"
2171,II.,"prize; then, with great difficulty, and not without a few wounds and"
2172,II.,"bruises, he climbed up again, and stood triumphant on the brink of a"
2173,II.,really frightful precipice.  If the young lady had known where her clasp
2174,II.,"was to be found, she certainly would not have asked him to look for it;"
2175,II.,but he was himself well pleased to have encountered any danger for her
2176,II.,"sake, and in thoughtful mood he returned to the cottage, and repaired to"
2177,II.,his humble couch to dream of Anne Saint John.
2178,II.,
2179,II.,"""Why, Henry, what hast thee been doing to face and hands, boy?"" said"
2180,II.,Robin the next morning.
2181,II.,
2182,II.,"""I stumbled into a brake, father,"" replied Henry, laughing, ""and got a"
2183,II.,"few scratches, that's all."""
2184,II.,
2185,II.,"""Dear heart, but they are grievous hurts!"" exclaimed Maud, ""you must let"
2186,II.,"me put a balsam to them, Henry."""
2187,II.,
2188,II.,"""As you will, mother, but it is hardly worth while for so light a"
2189,II.,"matter."""
2190,II.,
2191,II.,"The balsam, however, was applied, and the wounds were speedily healed,"
2192,II.,but Henry did not recover his wonted peace of mind.  As Lord Clifford he
2193,II.,might have won the hand of the high-born maiden on whom his thoughts now
2194,II.,"constantly dwelt; but, as Henry the Shepherd, even to speak to her was"
2195,II.,presumption.  Never had he lamented over his fallen fortunes as he did
2196,II.,"now; but he buried his regrets in his own bosom, nor did he let it"
2197,II.,"appear, either by word or look, that he was less contented than he was"
2198,II.,before.
2199,II.,
2200,II.,"Lady Margaret had taken care of the clasp, but she told him the country"
2201,II.,"was again threatened with warfare, so that it would not be safe to"
2202,II.,entrust anything of value to the hands of a messenger; therefore she
2203,II.,"would keep it till Sir Lancelot went to Bletso, which he intended to do"
2204,II.,ere long.  She did not tell him that Sir John Saint John had come to
2205,II.,Threlkeld to give secret information to herself and her husband of the
2206,II.,"project contemplated by the chief nobles, to depose King Richard and"
2207,II.,place the Earl of Richmond on the throne.  She was afraid of exciting
2208,II.,"hopes that might end in disappointment, yet she was herself sanguine as"
2209,II.,to the possibility of De Clifford being restored to his rights if the
2210,II.,crown should be won by a prince of the House of Lancaster.  Sir John
2211,II.,"took great interest in the cause, being himself related in a distant"
2212,II.,degree to Henry Earl of Richmond; therefore the Saint John's of Bletso
2213,II.,had royal blood in their veins.
2214,II.,
2215,II.,"It was the close of the autumn, in the year 1485, when Lady Margaret"
2216,II.,"came one evening to Robin's cottage, not secretly as heretofore, not in"
2217,II.,fear and trembling lest it should be known for whom her visit was
2218,II.,"intended, but openly to greet her son as De Clifford's heir.  Little did"
2219,II.,"he guess the purport of her coming as he returned her fond embrace, but"
2220,II.,"he saw that her countenance was radiant with happiness, and he asked if"
2221,II.,Sir Lancelot had returned.
2222,II.,
2223,II.,"""No, my son, he is in London; and, Henry, I have important news to tell."
2224,II.,"Have you courage to hear it?"""
2225,II.,
2226,II.,"""Why should I need courage, dear mother?  You do not look as if you had"
2227,II.,"evil tidings to communicate."""
2228,II.,
2229,II.,"""The tidings I bring are not evil; but it requires fortitude to bear a"
2230,II.,"great joy as well as a great sorrow, when it comes upon us"
2231,II.,"unexpectedly."""
2232,II.,
2233,II.,"Henry's heart began to beat more quickly, his face flushed, and his"
2234,II.,voice trembled as he asked--
2235,II.,
2236,II.,"""Mother, what has happened?  Tell me at once, I beseech you."""
2237,II.,
2238,II.,"""I told you, Henry, that we were looking for a renewal of the war."""
2239,II.,
2240,II.,"""Yes, you told me so.  Has it begun again?"""
2241,II.,
2242,II.,"""It has begun and ended, I hope, for ever.  There has been a battle;"
2243,II.,"King Richard is killed, and a prince of the House of Lancaster now sits"
2244,II.,"on the throne."""
2245,II.,
2246,II.,"Henry started up from his seat, his eyes fixed on Lady Margaret's face"
2247,II.,in an agony of suspense.
2248,II.,
2249,II.,"""And I, mother, what have I to do with this?"""
2250,II.,
2251,II.,"""Much, my beloved son.  Henry the Seventh is a just and noble prince,"
2252,II.,"and your father, my husband, is at his court even now."""
2253,II.,
2254,II.,"""Then, am I--am I--"" he could not give utterance to what he wished to"
2255,II.,"say, but Lady Margaret knew what he would ask, and replied--"
2256,II.,
2257,II.,"""Yes, my Henry, it is even so.  You are now Lord Clifford before all the"
2258,II.,"world, and I, your mother, may once more fearlessly acknowledge my son."""
2259,II.,
2260,II.,"Henry fell on his knees, and raised his clasped hands and streaming eyes"
2261,II.,"in gratitude to heaven.  He could scarcely realise this great, this"
2262,II.,"overwhelming happiness.  Again and again he embraced that tender mother,"
2263,II.,"who, for so many years had watched over him like a guardian angel, and"
2264,II.,smoothed the rugged path he had been forced to tread.
2265,II.,
2266,II.,"When the first emotions of joy had in some degree subsided, and he was"
2267,II.,calm enough to listen to the account of how this happy change had been
2268,II.,"brought about, Lady Margaret told him that the new sovereign,"
2269,II.,"immediately on his accession, had declared his intention of restoring to"
2270,II.,their rights all those nobles who had been dispossessed of their lands
2271,II.,"and titles by Edward the Fourth; and that Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, on"
2272,II.,"hearing this, had proceeded to the court, with Sir John Saint John of"
2273,II.,"Bletso, in order to make known to the king that the heir of the late"
2274,II.,Lord Clifford was still in existence.  She said she had that morning
2275,II.,received intelligence from Sir Lancelot that the royal decree was
2276,II.,already passed for the restoration of Clifford's son to all his father's
2277,II.,"lands and dignities, and it was with the utmost surprise Henry now"
2278,II.,"learned, for the first time, how immense were the possessions to which"
2279,II.,"he was entitled; for, besides the great estates of Skipton and Brougham,"
2280,II.,"his inheritance comprised the castles, manors, and lordships of Appleby,"
2281,II.,"Pendragon, Brough, and Mallerstane Chase in Westmoreland; Barden Tower,"
2282,II.,"Copley Feld, and other manors in Yorkshire; with lands and castles in"
2283,II.,"Cumberland, Northumberland, Derbyshire, Worcestershire and Surrey."
2284,II.,"Clifford's Inn, which is now used as law offices and chambers, in Fleet"
2285,II.,"Street, was then a nobleman's mansion with beautiful gardens; and this"
2286,II.,was Lord Clifford's residence in London.
2287,II.,
2288,II.,No wonder the humble shepherd should be dazzled and astonished to find
2289,II.,"himself all at once the lord of those vast domains; and not only these,"
2290,II.,"but all the Bromflete estates, that had belonged to Lord de Vesci, his"
2291,II.,"grandfather, were now his by right of inheritance.  It would be"
2292,II.,impossible to describe the joy of the worthy couple who had so long
2293,II.,"performed the part of parents to the shepherd lord, at the wondrous turn"
2294,II.,of fortune that had raised him once more to the elevated sphere that was
2295,II.,his birthright.
2296,II.,
2297,II.,"""We have lost a son,"" said old Robin, ""but we have found a noble master;"
2298,II.,"and may heaven grant him a long life to enjoy his own."""
2299,II.,
2300,II.,"""Think not, my father, that you have lost a son,"" said Henry, pressing"
2301,II.,"the old man's hand with affectionate warmth.  ""I shall be ever a son to"
2302,II.,"you."""
2303,II.,
2304,II.,"""And to me also, my Lord Henry,"" said Maud, ""for it would break my heart"
2305,II.,now if you should bear yourself towards me proudly in your own grand
2306,II.,"castle."""
2307,II.,
2308,II.,"""I should ill deserve my good fortune, dear Maud, if it made me so"
2309,II.,ungrateful as to bear myself proudly towards you.  Though I may be the
2310,II.,"lord of fifty castles, you will always be to me a second mother."""
2311,II.,
2312,II.,The next day Henry took his place in the house of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld
2313,II.,as Lord Clifford.  He laid aside the peasant's suit of homely grey for a
2314,II.,"dress befitting his rank, which Lady Margaret furnished him with from"
2315,II.,her husband's wardrobe; and very handsome he looked in a mulberry
2316,II.,"coloured vest richly embroidered with gold, a short cloak of blue satin"
2317,II.,"falling over one shoulder, and a diamond hilted sword by his side, for"
2318,II.,such was the fashion of the age.
2319,II.,
2320,II.,The faithful Rolf was despatched to Brougham Castle to see that all was
2321,II.,prepared for the reception of its lord; and right well did he execute
2322,II.,"the commission.  A sumptuous feast was provided, and a grand pageant"
2323,II.,prepared to meet him at the castle-gate.  All the ancient banners that
2324,II.,"had been taken down and thrown aside, were now displayed again in the"
2325,II.,"hall, and, under the superintendence of Rolf, everything was made to"
2326,II.,look just as it did before the banishment of the family.
2327,II.,
2328,II.,At length the bright day dawned that was to see Henry de Clifford
2329,II.,"restored to the beloved home of his childhood, and the people had"
2330,II.,flocked from far and near to hail the return of Brougham's rightful
2331,II.,lord.  It was nearly noon when the cavalcade was seen approaching.  Then
2332,II.,"loud acclamations rent the air, and, as Henry lifted his plumed and"
2333,II.,"jewelled cap to acknowledge the greeting of the joyous multitude, his"
2334,II.,"heart was overflowing with gratitude to the Father of all mercies, and"
2335,II.,he could scarcely restrain the tears that were ready to gush from his
2336,II.,"eyes.  He was mounted on a fine grey horse, and on one side of him rode"
2337,II.,"his lady mother, on the other Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, while behind him"
2338,II.,"came a fair lady, escorted by a gentleman of noble mien.  This was his"
2339,II.,"sister Elizabeth, who had lived for many years in the Netherlands, and"
2340,II.,"was married to Sir Robert Aske, a wealthy knight, who was now with her."
2341,II.,They were followed; by a long train of knights and gentlemen and their
2342,II.,"attendants, forming a retinue that might have graced a prince, and so"
2343,II.,"they came onward towards the castle-gate, where a triumphal arch was"
2344,II.,"erected, on the top of which were two figures clothed in white, with"
2345,II.,"outspread wings, and golden crowns, intended, perhaps, to represent"
2346,II.,"angels; and as Clifford passed under the arch, they chanted these"
2347,II.,lines--
2348,II.,
2349,II.,"""Now the Red Rose blooms again,"
2350,II.,Clifford o'er his own shall reign.
2351,II.,"Fill the cup, and sheath the sword,"
2352,II.,"To welcome back our noble lord."""
2353,II.,
2354,II.,And now the shepherd lord stood once more in his father's bannered hall.
2355,II.,"Silently he gazed around him on the well-known scene, too powerfully"
2356,II.,"affected to give utterance to his feelings; and, as his mother clasped"
2357,II.,"his hand, she felt that it trembled even more than her own."
2358,II.,
2359,II.,"""Let us pass on, my Henry,"" she whispered softly, ""we must hold"
2360,II.,"communion alone."""
2361,II.,
2362,II.,"Henry could not speak, but he pressed her hand assentingly, and they"
2363,II.,"left the hall together, amid the congratulations and good wishes of all"
2364,II.,therein assembled.
2365,II.,
2366,II.,"The mother and son were absent for the space of an hour, engaged, no"
2367,II.,"doubt, in prayer and thanksgiving, for when they returned to the hall"
2368,II.,"Henry had recovered his composure, and took the highest seat at the"
2369,II.,sumptuous banquet with all the dignity of his noble race.
2370,II.,
2371,II.,Gladsome was the feast that day at Brougham Castle; joyous were the
2372,II.,"songs of the minstrel bards as they celebrated, in extempore verse, the"
2373,II.,exile's restoration to his long lost home.

2378,II.,themselves addressed by the noble host as father and mother.
2379,II.,
2380,II.,It was not long after that another grand feast was held at Brougham
2381,II.,"Castle in honour of the marriage of its lord, which had been celebrated"
2382,II.,"at Bletso, where the beautiful daughter of Sir John Saint John willingly"
2383,II.,"bestowed her hand on him who, as a simple shepherd, had won a place in"
2384,II.,her heart.

2386,II.,The only drawback to the happiness of our hero was the consciousness of
2387,II.,"his neglected education.  Unable to read or write, he cared not to mix"
2388,II.,"with the nobles of the court, but preferred living in retirement, and"
2389,II.,"with great simplicity.  His grand object was to repair all his castles,"
2390,II.,"which had been much injured daring the wars, and he expended vast sums"
2391,II.,of money in fitting up some of them with princely magnificence; but his
2392,II.,"own favourite residence was a quiet retreat called Barden Tower, near"
2393,II.,"Bolton Priory, in Yorkshire.  He chose this for his chief abode because"
2394,II.,it afforded him the opportunity of spending much of his time at the
2395,II.,"Priory with the monks, who assisted him in the delightful study of"
2396,II.,"astronomy, which he was passionately fond of; but he beautified the"
2397,II.,"place, and kept up a noble establishment there, worthy of his own"
2398,II.,"exulted station, and of the lady he had made his bride."

2698,II.,
2699,II.,"""You have heard speak of the `Agamemnon' of 64 guns.  I was one of the"
2700,II.,"old Agamemnons, as we called ourselves.  We, all her crew, were proud of"
2701,II.,"her, and good reason we had to be so.  Captain Nelson commissioned her"
2702,II.,"on the 26th of January, 1793, and it wasn't many days after this that I"
2703,II.,joined her.  You see I kept my eye on him.  When a man has found a good
2704,II.,"captain, if he's wise he will follow him whenever he can."
2705,II.,
2706,II.,"""I can't now remember all the places we went to.  First, we were one of"
2707,II.,"the Channel fleet.  Then we were sent out to the Mediterranean, where"
2708,II.,"our captain astonished the admirals, and made the soldier-generals"
2709,II.,almost tear their eyes out by the way he did things.  He took care that
2710,II.,the weeds should not grow to the bottom of the ship he commanded.  First
2711,II.,we had to conquer the island of Corsica [Note 1].  We drove the French
2712,II.,"out of every place but the strong fort of Bastia, so we landed, and"
2713,II.,"hauled our guns up the heights, and kept up such a hot fire on the place"
2714,II.,"that it gave up, and then the soldiers marched in and gained the glory."
2715,II.,"Then we took a place called Calvi.  Here it was that a shot, striking"
2716,II.,"the ground, threw up some sand in the captain's eye, and though we"
2717,II.,"thought but little of it at the time, he never saw again with that eye."
2718,II.,"It was very hard work, and the country was unhealthy, and many of us"
2719,II.,"grew sick, so that we were heartily glad when it was over.  There was"
2720,II.,something better in store for us too.  News was brought us that the
2721,II.,"French fleet, nearly twice as strong as ours, was on the look-out for"
2722,II.,us.  Our fleet was under the command of Admiral Hotham.  You may be sure
2723,II.,that we kept a bright look-out for the enemy.  At last they hove in
2724,II.,"sight, and one of our frigates, the `Inconstant,' got so close that she"
2725,II.,"brought to action the `Ca Ira,' a French eighty-four, which had carried"
2726,II.,"away her main and foretop masts.  The `Inconstant,' however, was obliged"
2727,II.,"to bear away, and a French frigate came up and took the line-of-battle"
2728,II.,"ship in tow, while two other line-of-battle ships guarded her on her"
2729,II.,weather bow.
2730,II.,
2731,II.,"""Our captain had been watching all that took place, and, though we had"
2732,II.,"no line-of-battle ship to support us, we made all sail in chase.  There"
2733,II.,was not a man on board whose heart didn't beat high with pride at the
2734,II.,way we went into action against odds so great; but we Agamemnons knew
2735,II.,well enough what our captain could do and would do.  As soon as the
2736,II.,"enemy could bring their guns to bear, they kept firing away their"
2737,II.,"stern-chasers at us.  We stood on, without answering a shot, till we"
2738,II.,were within a hundred yards of them.  `Starboard the helm!' cried the
2739,II.,"captain.  The after-sails were brailed up, and the ship falling off, our"
2740,II.,broadside was brought to bear on the retreating enemy.  Now we opened a
2741,II.,"tremendous fire on them, every gun telling.  Then the helm was put"
2742,II.,"a-port, the after-yards braced up, and again we were after them."
2743,II.,
2744,II.,"""Again and again we practised the same manoeuvre, never allowing the `Ca"
2745,II.,"Ira' to get a shot at us with one of her broadside guns.  The enemy,"
2746,II.,"however, were not idle with their after-guns, though it was not till we"
2747,II.,had torn her sails almost to ribbons that the French frigates began to
2748,II.,open their fire upon us.  Then down came more of the enemy's ships
2749,II.,"towards us.  The captain seemed only the better pleased at seeing this,"
2750,II.,"and it's my opinion he would have hove to to meet them, and still"
2751,II.,"managed to come off victorious by some means or other, even if the"
2752,II.,admiral had not made the signal of recall.  Though our sails and rigging
2753,II.,"were much cut up, we had only seven men wounded, while the `Ca Ira' lost"
2754,II.,one hundred and ten that day.
2755,II.,
2756,II.,"""The next day we were again at it, for we managed to cut off the `Ca"
2757,II.,"Ira,' and the `Censeur,' which had her in tow.  This time we got one on"
2758,II.,"each side of us, and both of them fought well; but we fought better, and"
2759,II.,"at length both struck, and our boats were sent on board to take"
2760,II.,possession.  I never before had witnessed such a scene as that I saw on
2761,II.,"board the `Ca Ira.'  On her decks lay three hundred brave fellows, dead"
2762,II.,"or dying, or badly wounded, besides those she had lost the day before,"
2763,II.,while the `Censeur' had lost three hundred and fifty.  Our captain
2764,II.,"wanted to follow up the enemy, and it's my belief, if we had, we should"
2765,II.,"have taken every one of them; but the admiral would not let him, and"
2766,II.,"said we had done very well as it was.  So we had; but, you see, our"
2767,II.,captain was the man who always wanted to do something better than well.
2768,II.,_Do well_ sits on the main-top--_Do better_ climbs to the truck.
2769,II.,
2770,II.,"""The `Agamemnon' had been so knocked about, that the captain now shifted"
2771,II.,"his flag into the `Minerva' frigate, and took me and many other men with"
2772,II.,him.  One of our first duties was to carry off the English garrison and
2773,II.,"privateers and merchantmen from Corsica, which had declared for the"
2774,II.,"French.  We soon afterwards fought several actions with the enemy, and"
2775,II.,"then war broke out between England and Spain, and we had a narrow escape"
2776,II.,from an overwhelming force of Spanish ships.  We had just sailed from
2777,II.,"Gibraltar, when two Spanish line-of-battle ships followed us.  We were"
2778,II.,keeping pretty well ahead when a man fell overboard.  To let a man drown
2779,II.,without trying to help him was against our captain's nature.  A
2780,II.,"jolly-boat, commanded by Lieutenant Hardy, was lowered, and away she"
2781,II.,pulled to try and pick up the poor fellow.  The boat was within range of
2782,II.,the enemy's guns: the man was not to be seen.  The captain had been
2783,II.,"anxiously watching all that took place.  `I'll not lose Hardy,' he"
2784,II.,exclaimed.  `Back the main-topsail!'  No order was ever obeyed more
2785,II.,"readily, and soon we were dropping back towards our boat, and towards"
2786,II.,"the enemy.  We fully expected to be brought to action, but we did not"
2787,II.,"care for that; we got back Mr Hardy and our boat, when what was our"
2788,II.,astonishment to see the headmost Spaniard shorten sail to wait for his
2789,II.,consort.  There can be no doubt he thought we had assistance not far
2790,II.,off.  The Spaniards were very timid of us in those days--they had good
2791,II.,"reason to be so.  With flying colours we sailed out of the Straits,"
2792,II.,laughing at our enemy.
2793,II.,
2794,II.,"""Both officers and men were constantly being shifted from ship to ship"
2795,II.,"in those days; and, as soon as we reached Cadiz we found ourselves"
2796,II.,"transferred to the `Captain,' a fine seventy-four.  Captain Nelson"
2797,II.,"hoisted his pennant, as commodore, on board of her, with Captain Miller"
2798,II.,under him.  You have heard speak of the battle of Saint Vincent.  Sir
2799,II.,"John Jervis, who was made Earl Saint Vincent, was our admiral, and"
2800,II.,Commodore Nelson was second in command.  He was now going to show all
2801,II.,the world what he really was.  The Spaniards had twice as many ships as
2802,II.,"we had.  They were much bigger, and carried heavier guns; but what did"
2803,II.,"Nelson or we care for that.  It is the men who fight the battles, and"
2804,II.,Nelson knew the stuff British seamen are made of.
2805,II.,
2806,II.,"""Early in the morning of the 14th of February, the Spanish fleet hove in"
2807,II.,"sight, and we bore down on them.  They were in line, that is, one"
2808,II.,"following the other.  We managed to break that line, and cut off one"
2809,II.,"part from the other, just as you cut a snake in two.  We followed the"
2810,II.,"head, the biggest part.  That part bore away before the wind to join the"
2811,II.,"tail.  The `Captain' was instantly wore round, instead of tacking,"
2812,II.,"according to a signal just then made by the admiral, and away, after"
2813,II.,"them we went, followed by the `Culloden,' `Blenheim,' and `Diadem.'  The"
2814,II.,`Captain' was in the rear of the British line; but by the manoeuvre just
2815,II.,"performed, we came up with the Spaniards, and in a short time we and the"
2816,II.,`Blenheim' were tooth and nail with no less than seven Spanish
2817,II.,"line-of-battle ships--one, the `Santissima Trinidade,' of 130 guns, and"
2818,II.,"the `San Josef' and `Salvador del Mundo' of 112, the others being of 80"
2819,II.,"and 74 guns.  For nearly an hour we pounded away at them, till Captain"
2820,II.,"Collingwood, in the `Excellent,' came up, and gave us a helping hand by"
2821,II.,pouring a tremendous broadside into the `San Nicolas.'
2822,II.,
2823,II.,"""Our captain now let us fall close alongside that ship, and then he"
2824,II.,"called for boarders, and away we dashed into her.  Right through her we"
2825,II.,"went; her flag was hauled down, and then, more boarders coming up, on we"
2826,II.,"dashed aboard the big `San Joseph,' and in a little time we had her"
2827,II.,"also.  We followed our captain to the quarterdeck, and then the Spanish"
2828,II.,"officers assembled, and their captain and all of them presented their"
2829,II.,swords to Commodore Nelson.  As he received them he gave them to one of
2830,II.,"his bargemen, William Fearney, who, with no little pleasure, tucked them"
2831,II.,"under his arm, just as you see in the picture in the Painted Hall"
2832,II.,"yonder.  All the seven ships were taken, and if the Spaniards had had"
2833,II.,"any pluck we should have taken the remainder; but they hadn't, and made"
2834,II.,off while we were unable to follow.  That is the worst of fighting with
2835,II.,"cowards.  If they had been brave men they would have stopped to fight,"
2836,II.,and we should have captured every one of their ships.  That was the
2837,II.,battle of Saint Vincent.
2838,II.,
2839,II.,"""The commodore was made an admiral and a knight, and now everybody in"
2840,II.,"England, high and low, rich and poor, had heard of him, and sung his"
2841,II.,praises.
2842,II.,
2843,II.,"""You've seen a picture of Sir Horatio Nelson, as he was then, in a boat"
2844,II.,"attacked by Spaniards, and his coxswain, John Sykes, defending him, and"
2845,II.,receiving on his own head the blow made at him by one of the enemy.
2846,II.,I'll tell you how it was:--
2847,II.,
2848,II.,"""His flag was flying on board the `Theseus,' and he had command of the"
2849,II.,"inner squadron blockading Cadiz.  The Spanish gunboats had annoyed us,"
2850,II.,and he resolved to attack them with the boats at night.  In we pulled.
2851,II.,In the admiral's barge there were only his ten bargemen--I was one of
2852,II.,"them--Captain Freemantle, and his coxswain, John Sykes, when suddenly we"
2853,II.,found ourselves close up with a Spanish launch carrying twenty-six men
2854,II.,"or more.  To run was not in our nature, so we tackled to with the"
2855,II.,"launch.  It was desperate work, and the Spaniards fought well.  Sir"
2856,II.,Horatio was foremost in the fight; but the enemy seemed to know who he
2857,II.,"was, and aimed many a blow at his head.  Sykes, not thinking of himself,"
2858,II.,"defended him as a bear does her whelps.  Blow after blow he warded off,"
2859,II.,"till at last his own arm was disabled.  Still, instead of getting over"
2860,II.,"to the other side of the boat, he stood by the admiral.  Down came"
2861,II.,"another Spaniard's sword which Sir Horatio could not ward off, but Sykes"
2862,II.,"sprung forward and received the blow on his own head, which it laid"
2863,II.,open.  This did not make us less determined to beat the enemy.  One
2864,II.,"after the other we cut them down till we killed eighteen, wounded the"
2865,II.,"rest, and towed their launch off in triumph.  It will just show you how"
2866,II.,the men who served with him loved the admiral.  That was a desperate
2867,II.,"fight in a small way, let me tell you; but before long we had still"
2868,II.,worse work to go through.
2869,II.,
2870,II.,"""Many men are thought a great deal of if they gain one victory.  Nelson"
2871,II.,never but once suffered a defeat.  It was at the island of Teneriffe.
2872,II.,"He was sent there, by Sir John Jervis, with a squadron to cut out a rich"
2873,II.,"Manilla ship returning to Spain, which lay in the harbour of Santa Cruz."
2874,II.,"Our squadron consisted of four ships of the line, three frigates, and"
2875,II.,"the `Fox' cutter.  Our first attempt at landing failed, and then the"
2876,II.,"admiral, who never would be beaten, against the orders of Sir John"
2877,II.,"himself, determined to take command of the expedition on shore."
2878,II.,"Midnight was the time chosen for the attack.  The orders were, that all"
2879,II.,the boats should land at a big mole which runs out from the town.  Away
2880,II.,"we pulled; the night was very dark, the boats got separated, and when we"
2881,II.,reached the mole there were only four or five boats there.  A heavy fire
2882,II.,"was at once opened on us, but the admiral would not be turned back."
2883,II.,"Drawing his sword, he was springing on shore, but the same moment he was"
2884,II.,"struck by a musket ball, and fell back into the arms of his step-son,"
2885,II.,"Lieutenant Nisbet.  The lieutenant and one of our men bound up his arm,"
2886,II.,while all those who could be collected jumped into the boat to shove her
2887,II.,"off.  It was difficult work, for she had grounded.  We pulled close"
2888,II.,"under the battery to avoid the heavy fire from it.  As we moved on, all"
2889,II.,we could see was the bright flashes from the guns extending in a long
2890,II.,"line in front of us.  On again pulling out, a fearful cry was raised."
2891,II.,It came from the `Fox' cutter.  A shot had struck her between wind and
2892,II.,"water, and down she went, leaving her crew struggling in the waves.  The"
2893,II.,admiral had just before been lifted up in the stern-sheets by Mr Nisbet
2894,II.,to look about him.
2895,II.,
2896,II.,"""`Give way, lads--give way,' he shouted, forgetting his own desperate"
2897,II.,wound.  `We must save them.'
2898,II.,
2899,II.,"""Soon we were in among the struggling men, and hauling them into the"
2900,II.,"boats as fast as we could, the shot all the time rattling about us.  The"
2901,II.,"admiral seemed to have recovered his strength, and worked away with his"
2902,II.,"left arm, assisting in saving a great many.  Eighty men were saved, but"
2903,II.,more than half the crew were lost.  The first ship we came to was the
2904,II.,"`Seahorse.'  Her captain's wife, Mrs Freemantle, was on board, but he"
2905,II.,"was with the boats, and no one could tell whether he was alive or dead."
2906,II.,
2907,II.,"""`No, no,' exclaimed the admiral; `I can give the poor lady no tidings"
2908,II.,of her husband; she shall not see me in this state.  Pull to another
2909,II.,ship.'
2910,II.,
2911,II.,"""We managed to reach the `Theseus.'  When a rope was lowered, he sprung"
2912,II.,"up the side, and would have no help.  We could scarcely believe our"
2913,II.,"eyes, for we thought he was half dead.  His was a wonderful spirit."
2914,II.,Then he sent us off to try and save a few more of the poor fellows from
2915,II.,the `Fox.'  When we got back we found that he had made the surgeon at
2916,II.,"once cut off his arm.  We brought him the news that Captain Freemantle,"
2917,II.,"though badly wounded, had got off in safety to his ship.  You may be"
2918,II.,sure that both he and all of us were very anxious to know what was going
2919,II.,forward on shore.  At length we heard that Captain Troubridge had
2920,II.,managed to collect two or three hundred men--all who were not drowned or
2921,II.,"killed by shot--and having marched into the square, had taken the town."
2922,II.,"Of course, he could do nothing against the citadel.  Some eight thousand"
2923,II.,"Spanish troops were collecting about the place, but he was not a man to"
2924,II.,be daunted; telling them that he would burn the town if they molested
2925,II.,"him, he was able to draw off all his men in safety.  During that"
2926,II.,business we lost two hundred and fifty men and officers.  It was a sad
2927,II.,"affair, but though it was a failure every man engaged in it did his duty"
2928,II.,"bravely, and no one could blame the admiral for what had happened.  We"
2929,II.,heard that the Spaniards treated our wounded men who were left on shore
2930,II.,with the greatest kindness and care.  No one among the wounded suffered
2931,II.,"more than the admiral, and it was some months, I've heard say, before"
2932,II.,the pain left his arm.
2933,II.,
2934,II.,"""Once more we returned to old England, and the admiral went up to London"
2935,II.,to try and get cured of his wound.  Since he left home he had lost an
2936,II.,"eye and an arm, and had been terribly knocked about besides; but people"
2937,II.,"thought of what he had done, not of how he looked, and he was received"
2938,II.,with honour wherever he went.
2939,II.,
2940,II.,"""I and a few others of his old hands lived on shore, keeping a look-out"
2941,II.,for when he should get another command.  We were afraid of being
2942,II.,"pressed, and made to serve somewhere away from him.  One and all of us"
2943,II.,"were ready enough to fight for our king and our country, provided we"
2944,II.,could fight under him.  We had not long to wait.  We soon got news that
2945,II.,the `Vanguard' was to be commissioned to carry Sir Horatio Nelson's flag
2946,II.,to join the Mediterranean fleet under Earl Saint Vincent.  That was in
2947,II.,the year 1798.
2948,II.,
2949,II.,"""We sailed from Gibraltar on the 9th of May with three line-of-battle"
2950,II.,"ships, four frigates, and a sloop of war, to look after the French"
2951,II.,"fleet, which consisted of thirteen ships of the line, seven frigates,"
2952,II.,"twenty-four smaller ships of war, and a fleet of transports, bound, as"
2953,II.,"we afterwards learned, for Egypt.  If the French had conquered that"
2954,II.,"country, they would have gone on, there is no doubt of it, to attack our"
2955,II.,"possessions in India.  The admiral, I dare say, knew the importance of"
2956,II.,stopping that French fleet.  In spite of their numbers we did not fear
2957,II.,"them.  Proud we were of our ship, and prouder still was our admiral of"
2958,II.,her and her crew and the fleet he commanded.  While we were in the Gulf
2959,II.,"of Lyons, after it had been blowing hard all day, it came on one dark"
2960,II.,"night to blow harder still, and, without warning, first our main and"
2961,II.,"then our mizen-topmast went over the side, and lastly the foremast went"
2962,II.,"altogether, so that we no longer could carry sail on it.  What a"
2963,II.,crippled wreck we looked in the morning!  There was a thick fog: not one
2964,II.,of the squadron could be seen.  We were boasting the day before that we
2965,II.,were ready to meet more than an equal number of the finest ships the
2966,II.,"French could bring against us; and now we lay docked of our wings, and"
2967,II.,scarcely able to contend with the smallest frigate.  Providence was
2968,II.,"watching over us, and we had good reason to believe this when some time"
2969,II.,afterwards we learned that that very day the French fleet sailed from
2970,II.,"Toulon, and passed within a few miles of us, while we were hid from them"
2971,II.,"by the fog.  At last Captain Ball, in the `Alexander,' came up, and"
2972,II.,"towed us into the harbour of San Pietro in Sardinia, where in four days,"
2973,II.,"with the aid of his and other two ships' companies, we got completely"
2974,II.,"refitted and ready for sea.  Away we went in search of the French fleet,"
2975,II.,with General Bonaparte himself on board.  We heard of the French at
2976,II.,"Gozo, and our admiral would have attacked them there, but they had gone;"
2977,II.,"then on we railed for Egypt, hoping to find them off Alexandria, but not"
2978,II.,"a sign of them could we discover.  If we had had our frigates, we should"
2979,II.,"have found them out fast enough.  Leaving Alexandria, we steered for"
2980,II.,"Syracuse, where we provisioned and watered; we visited the Morea; we"
2981,II.,"hunted along the Greek coast.  At last we entered the Gulf of Coron,"
2982,II.,where Captain Troubridge brought us the news that the French fleet had
2983,II.,been seen steering from Candia for Egypt four weeks before.  Instantly
2984,II.,all sail was made for Alexandria.  Still we scarcely expected to find
2985,II.,the French fleet there.  Great then was our joy when the signal was seen
2986,II.,"flying from the masthead of the `Zealous,' Captain Hood, that the"
2987,II.,enemy's fleet were moored in Aboukir Bay.  Not a moment was lost in
2988,II.,clearing the ships for action.  We all knew that we had hot work before
2989,II.,"us.  We found the French fleet moored in a sort of curve in the bay, but"
2990,II.,far enough from the shore to let some of our ships get inside of them;
2991,II.,"that is, between them and the land.  This the French little expected,"
2992,II.,and many hadn't even their guns loaded on that side.
2993,II.,
2994,II.,"""Oh! it was a magnificent sight, as on we sailed, receiving a hot fire"
2995,II.,"from the shore batteries, but not answering a shot, while silently we"
2996,II.,"furled our sails, and got ready for anchoring.  I believe that silence"
2997,II.,made the hearts of the Frenchmen quake more than our loudest hurrahs
2998,II.,would have done.  It was evening; the sun was just sinking into the
2999,II.,"ocean as we entered the bay.  The `Goliath' led the way, followed by the"
3000,II.,"`Zealous,' and then came the `Orion,' all anchoring inside the enemy's"
3001,II.,"line.  The `Vanguard' (our ship) was the first which anchored outside,"
3002,II.,"within half pistol-shot of the `Spartiate.'  We had six colours flying,"
3003,II.,just us a sign to the Frenchmen that come what might we were not likely
3004,II.,to strike to them; and now there was very little to be seen but the
3005,II.,flashes and thick smoke from the guns.  Other ships followed us outside
3006,II.,"the French line, but the greater number were inside.  No sooner were our"
3007,II.,"anchors dropped than we opened fire, our example being followed by the"
3008,II.,other ships as they brought up.  We blazed away in right earnest; there
3009,II.,was no flinching from our guns.  What the Frenchmen were about I cannot
3010,II.,"tell, but we seemed to fire two shots to their one; but then their guns"
3011,II.,"carried heavier metal than ours, and they had many more of them.  It was"
3012,II.,so dark that we had to get our fighting-lanterns hung up along the
3013,II.,"decks.  Just fancy us then stripped to the waist, with handkerchiefs"
3014,II.,"bound round our heads, and straining every nerve as we ran in and out,"
3015,II.,"and cleaned and loaded our heavy guns, and blazed away as fast as we"
3016,II.,"could.  We were covered, too, with smoke and powder, and before long"
3017,II.,most of us were sprinkled pretty thickly with our own or our shipmates'
3018,II.,blood.  Such was the sight you would have seen between decks on board
3019,II.,every ship in the action.
3020,II.,
3021,II.,"""I must tell you what happened in other parts.  There was a shoal we had"
3022,II.,"to pass on our starboard hand.  The `Culloden,' the ship of the brave"
3023,II.,"Captain Troubridge, struck on it when standing in, for by that time the"
3024,II.,darkness of night had come on.  He instantly made signals which
3025,II.,"prevented the other ships, the `Alexander,' `Swiftsure,' and `Leander,'"
3026,II.,"following, and getting on shore.  They did their best to help off the"
3027,II.,"`Culloden,' but could not get her off, so stood on into the battle."
3028,II.,"Before even they opened their fire, five of the enemy's ships had"
3029,II.,"struck.  On standing on, Captain Hollowell fell in with the old"
3030,II.,"`Billyruffian' (`Bellerophon'), with already two hundred dead and"
3031,II.,"wounded, and almost a wreck from the tremendous fire of `L'Orient' of"
3032,II.,"120 guns.  The `Swiftsure' took her place, and soon made the Frenchman"
3033,II.,pay dear for what she had done.  I heard of this afterwards.  A seaman
3034,II.,at his gun can know little more of an action than what he sees before
3035,II.,"his nose, and that is chiefly smoke and fire, and part of the hull and"
3036,II.,"rigging of one ship, and men struck down, and timbers and splinters"
3037,II.,"flying about, and yards and blocks rattling down, while he hears alone"
3038,II.,"the roar of the guns, the shouts, and shrieks, and groans of those"
3039,II.,"around him.  This sort of terrible work was going on for some time, when"
3040,II.,the word got about that the admiral himself was desperately wounded in
3041,II.,"the head.  It made our hearts sink within us with sorrow, but it did not"
3042,II.,"cause us to fight less fiercely, or be less determined to gain the"
3043,II.,victory.  How anxiously we waited to hear what the surgeons would say
3044,II.,about the wound of our noble chief! and when we were told that it was
3045,II.,"merely the skin of his head which was hurt, and which had almost blinded"
3046,II.,"him, how hearty the cheer we gave.  It must have astonished the"
3047,II.,"Frenchmen, who could not tell the cause.  Then at it again we went"
3048,II.,"blazing away like fury, the round-shot and chain-shot and bullets"
3049,II.,"whizzing and tearing along our decks, making the white splinters fly,"
3050,II.,"and sending many a poor fellow out of the world, when suddenly the"
3051,II.,"darkness, which had till now surrounded us, was lighted up by the bright"
3052,II.,flames which darted out of every port and twisted round the masts of a
3053,II.,"burning ship.  We soon learned that she was a French ship, the big"
3054,II.,"`L'Orient,' with which the `Billyruffian' had been engaged.  Never did I"
3055,II.,"see such a sight; in a few minutes she was just one mass of flame, from"
3056,II.,"her truck to the water's edge.  Her miserable crew, from one end of her"
3057,II.,"to the other, were leaping into the water to avoid the scorching heat."
3058,II.,"`Out boats!' was the order, and each of our ships near at hand sent as"
3059,II.,many boats as could be manned to the rescue of our unfortunate enemies.
3060,II.,"Had they been our own shipmates, we could not have exerted ourselves"
3061,II.,more.  Still the battle raged from one end of the line to the other.
3062,II.,Suddenly there was a sound as if the earth were rent asunder.  In one
3063,II.,"pointed mass of flame up went the tall masts, and spars, and the decks"
3064,II.,"of the huge `L'Orient.'  They seemed, in one body of fire, to rise above"
3065,II.,"our mastheads, and then down they came, spreading far and wide, hissing"
3066,II.,into the water among the boats and the hundreds of poor wretches
3067,II.,struggling for their lives.  Among them was the French commodore.
3068,II.,"Captain Casabianca, I heard, was his name.  He was a brave man.  He had"
3069,II.,"his son with him, a little fellow only ten years old, as gallant, those"
3070,II.,"we rescued told us, as his father.  They were blown up together.  We saw"
3071,II.,"the two, the father holding on his son clinging to a spar.  We pulled"
3072,II.,"towards them, but just then a bit of the burning wreck must have struck"
3073,II.,"them and carried them down, for when we got up to the spot they were"
3074,II.,nowhere to be seen.  That's the worst of a battle; there are so many
3075,II.,"young boys on board who often get as cruelly hurt as the men, and"
3076,II.,"haven't the strength to bear up against their sufferings.  Well, as I"
3077,II.,"was saying, we pulled about, picking up the half-burnt struggling"
3078,II.,wretches wherever we could find them among the bits of floating wreck.
3079,II.,Only seventy were saved out of many more than a thousand men on board.
3080,II.,That was about ten o'clock.  For some time not a shot was fired.  Every
3081,II.,"man felt that something awful had happened, but still many of the"
3082,II.,"Frenchmen hadn't given in.  So at it again we went, and blazed away at"
3083,II.,"each other till three in the morning.  When daylight returned, only two"
3084,II.,"of the enemy's ships of the line had their colours flying, and they had"
3085,II.,"not been engaged.  They, with two frigates, cut their cables in the"
3086,II.,"forenoon, and stood out to sea, we having no ships in a fit state to"
3087,II.,follow them.  There were thirteen French line-of-battle ships when the
3088,II.,"action began; we took nine, two were burned, and two escaped; and of the"
3089,II.,four frigates one was sunk and another burned; while the enemy lost
3090,II.,three thousand one hundred and five men in killed and wounded.  Captain
3091,II.,"Westcott was the only captain killed, but we lost in all nearly nine"
3092,II.,"hundred other officers and men.  As soon as the battle was over, an"
3093,II.,order was issued that all on board every ship should return thanks to
3094,II.,"Almighty God, who had given us the victory.  Many a hearty thanksgiving"
3095,II.,was offered up that day.  It was a solemn ceremony; not a word was
3096,II.,spoken fore and aft till the chaplain began the prayers.  A dead silence
3097,II.,reigned throughout the fleet.  The Egyptians and Arabs on shore could
3098,II.,"not make it out, I've heard say; and even the French officers, prisoners"
3099,II.,"on board, infidels as they were, listened with respect, and could not"
3100,II.,help believing that there must be a God who had given us the victory.
3101,II.,Hard work we had to get our ships and prizes fit for sea again after the
3102,II.,"battering they had got; as it was, we had to burn four of our prizes, as"
3103,II.,it would have taken too long to refit them; and then at last away we
3104,II.,sailed with the larger part of the fleet for Naples.
3105,II.,
3106,II.,"""The battle I've been telling you about was called the battle of the"
3107,II.,"Nile.  It was, I've heard say, one of the most glorious and important"
3108,II.,"ever fought on the sea."""
3109,II.,
3110,III.,III.
3111,III.,
3112,III.,"""After lying at Naples for a long time, Lord Keith came out and took the"
3113,III.,"chief command, and we sailed with a squadron for Malta.  On our way we"
3114,III.,"fell in with a French fleet, the biggest ship of which was the"
3115,III.,"`Genereux,' one of the line-of-battle ships which had escaped from the"
3116,III.,"Nile.  We captured her and a frigate, and not long afterwards the"
3117,III.,"`Guillaume Tell,' the other line-of-battle ship, after in vain"
3118,III.,"attempting to escape from Valetta harbour, surrendered to us; and thus"
3119,III.,every ship of the fleet which had escorted Bonaparte to Egypt was
3120,III.,"captured, except, I fancy, one frigate."
3121,III.,
3122,III.,"""At last we went into Leghorn Roads, and after some time Lord Nelson and"
3123,III.,"Sir William and Lady Hamilton, and other people who had been on board,"
3124,III.,"landed, and travelled through Germany towards England.  I have heard say"
3125,III.,that he was more than once very nearly caught by the French during the
3126,III.,journey through Italy.  What a prize he would have been to them.  I
3127,III.,"remained in the `Foudroyant' for some time.  We all missed the admiral,"
3128,III.,"and hoped that he would come out again, and hoist his flag on board his"
3129,III.,"old ship.  Whatever ship he went to it was the same, the men loved him,"
3130,III.,and would have done anything for him.  At last I was sent home in a
3131,III.,"prize, and was paid off.  As the admiral was taking a spell on shore, I"
3132,III.,"thought I would take one too, and enjoy myself.  I spent some time with"
3133,III.,"my old mother; but one night, going down to see an old shipmate who was"
3134,III.,"ill at a public-house near Deal, I found myself in the hands of a"
3135,III.,"press-gang, and carried aboard the `Elephant,' Captain Foley.  I had"
3136,III.,"made up my mind to belong to the flag-ship of Admiral Nelson, whatever"
3137,III.,"she might be.  Still, it couldn't be helped, and, of course, I"
3138,III.,determined to do my duty.  I there learned that Captain Hardy had
3139,III.,"commissioned the `Saint George,' of 98 guns, and that it was supposed"
3140,III.,Lord Nelson would hoist his flag on board her.  This he shortly
3141,III.,"afterwards did, and it was some consolation, when we sailed for Yarmouth"
3142,III.,"Roads, off the Norfolk coast, to join him.  It was soon whispered about"
3143,III.,"that there was work for us to do, and we guessed that there was truth in"
3144,III.,the report when the fleet was ordered away up the Baltic.  This was in
3145,III.,"1801; a long time ago it seems.  You see that Russia, and Sweden, and"
3146,III.,Denmark were all going to join against us to help the French; and as the
3147,III.,"Danes had a fine fleet, it was necessary to destroy or capture it, to"
3148,III.,prevent it doing us mischief.  We therefore sent to tell the Danes that
3149,III.,"they must give it up and be friends, or that we would knock their city"
3150,III.,"about their ears, and sink their ships.  They dared us do our worst."
3151,III.,They ought to have known what Lord Nelson was likely to do; but you must
3152,III.,understand that Sir Hyde Parker was commander-in-chief--he was only
3153,III.,"second in command.  A great deal of time was lost in diplomatising, and"
3154,III.,all that time the Danes were preparing their ships and batteries to
3155,III.,"receive us.  If you take a look at a chart of the mouth of the Baltic,"
3156,III.,"you will see what numbers of shoals, and small islands, and narrow"
3157,III.,"channels there are about Copenhagen.  Fortunately one of our captains,"
3158,III.,"Captain Dommet, knew the coast, and he persuaded Sir Hyde Parker only to"
3159,III.,let the lighter ships go up to the attack.  The `Saint George' drew too
3160,III.,"much water, and, fortunately for us, Lord Nelson chose our ship to hoist"
3161,III.,his flag on board.  Didn't we cheer him as he came alongside.
3162,III.,Copenhagen stands on a dead flat facing the sea; it is defended by a
3163,III.,"large fort and two heavy batteries, thrown up on rocks or sandbanks."
3164,III.,Besides these there was the Danish fleet drawn up in a long line before
3165,III.,"the city, and eighteen floating batteries, mounting no less than 690"
3166,III.,"guns.  Some way off, in front of the city, is a shoal called the Middle"
3167,III.,"Ground, and then another channel, and then comes the long island of"
3168,III.,Saltholm.  On the last day of March we entered the channel between the
3169,III.,"Swedish and Danish coasts, having the castle of Helsingburg on one side"
3170,III.,"and that of Elsinore on the other, and on we sailed in front of the city"
3171,III.,till we came to an anchor off the island of Arnak.  Sir Hyde Parker
3172,III.,"remained near the mouth of the channel with the heavier ships, so that"
3173,III.,"Lord Nelson had the lighter ones all to himself, while the brave Captain"
3174,III.,Riou commanded the frigates.  All the night was spent in preparing for
3175,III.,"battle, and Captain Hardy was employed in sounding the channel, through"
3176,III.,which we were to pass to the attack.  He even reached in the darkness
3177,III.,"close up to one of the Danish ships, and sounded round her.  There was"
3178,III.,"the whole squadron anchored so close in with the Danish shore, that had"
3179,III.,our enemies known the range they might have done us much mischief.  Lord
3180,III.,"Nelson spent the chief part of the night dictating orders to his clerks,"
3181,III.,to send round to his captains to tell them what to do.  At last the
3182,III.,"morning broke, and, with a fair wind, the `Edgar' leading under a press"
3183,III.,"of sail, the fleet stood down the Danish line, and took up their"
3184,III.,"positions as arranged, the brave Captain Riou and his frigates being"
3185,III.,"opposed to the Crown Battery, at the further end.  With a groan, we who"
3186,III.,once belonged to her saw the old `Agamemnon' take the ground on the
3187,III.,"shoal I have spoken of; the `Bellona' and `Russel' touched also, but"
3188,III.,sufficiently within range to take part in the battle.  Soon after ten
3189,III.,"the `Edgar' began the action, and one, by one, as the other ships"
3190,III.,"slipped from their anchors, and following at intervals, took up their"
3191,III.,"position, they also commenced firing.  The commander-in-chief, Sir Hyde"
3192,III.,"Parker, was away on our right, you'll understand, with the bigger ships,"
3193,III.,and from the way the wind was he could not have come up to help us.
3194,III.,"Now, along the whole line the action became general.  Opposed to us"
3195,III.,"there were the forts and the floating batteries, and the Danish ships of"
3196,III.,"war, all blazing away together; and many of them had furnaces for"
3197,III.,"heating red-hot shot, which several times nearly set our ships on fire."
3198,III.,"No men ever fought better than the Danes, and several times when we had"
3199,III.,"killed or wounded all the defenders of a battery, their places were"
3200,III.,"supplied by fresh hands from the shore, who worked away at their guns as"
3201,III.,"bravely as the first, till they, poor fellows, were shot down.  More"
3202,III.,"than once the ships of the enemy had hauled down their flags, and when"
3203,III.,we were going to take possession again opened fire on us.  This enraged
3204,III.,"us, as you may suppose; but we cut them up terribly, and many of their"
3205,III.,ships and floating batteries were sinking or on fire.  For three hours
3206,III.,"or more we were at it, pounding away without being able to silence them."
3207,III.,"They were cutting us up too, let me tell you, riddling our hull, and"
3208,III.,"round-shot, and red-hot shot, and chain-shot, and bar shot flying"
3209,III.,"around, about, and through us.  It seemed a wonder that a man was left"
3210,III.,"alive on our decks.  Lord Nelson kept pacing the quarterdeck, watching"
3211,III.,everything that was going on.  A young Danish officer had got a big
3212,III.,"raft, with a breastwork mounting some twenty guns, and in spite of our"
3213,III.,"marines, who kept up a sharp fire on him, he held his post till the"
3214,III.,"battle was over.  The admiral praised him for his gallantry, and, I"
3215,III.,"believe, would have been very sorry if he had been killed, much as he"
3216,III.,"was annoying us.  A shot now struck our mainmast, sending the splinters"
3217,III.,"flying on every side.  I saw the admiral smile.  `This is hot work,' he"
3218,III.,observed to one of the officers; `in another moment not one of as may be
3219,III.,"alive, but, mark you, I would not be anywhere else for thousands.'  It's"
3220,III.,my opinion that most men would have thought we were getting the worst of
3221,III.,"it; and if we hadn't had Lord Nelson for our chief, we should have"
3222,III.,thought so likewise.
3223,III.,
3224,III.,"""Sir Hyde Parker's flag-ship was near enough for us to make out his"
3225,III.,signals.  It was reported that the signal for discontinuing the action
3226,III.,had been made.  `Acknowledge it!' cried Lord Nelson.  `Is our signal for
3227,III.,"close action still hoisted?'  `Yes, sir,' was the answer.  `Then keep it"
3228,III.,"so,' he replied.  Soon afterwards he put his glass up to his blind eye,"
3229,III.,"and turning to Captain Foley, he exclaimed, `I have a right to be blind"
3230,III.,"sometimes, and really I don't see the signal.  Never mind it, I say,"
3231,III.,nail mine to the mast.'  Admiral Graves in like manner disobeyed the
3232,III.,"order, and the rest of the squadron, looking only to Lord Nelson,"
3233,III.,continued the action.
3234,III.,
3235,III.,"""I was telling you about the brave Captain Riou and his frigates.  The"
3236,III.,"`Amazon,' his ship, had suffered much, and was so surrounded by smoke"
3237,III.,that he could see nothing of the batteries to which he was opposed.  He
3238,III.,"ordered, therefore, his men to cease firing to let the smoke clear off,"
3239,III.,that they might see what they were about.  This allowed the Danes to
3240,III.,"take better aim at them, and so tremendous was the fire opened on them"
3241,III.,that there seemed every chance of the frigates being sent to the bottom.
3242,III.,"Just then, Sir Hyde Parker's signal was seen flying.  Captain Riou"
3243,III.,judged that he ought to obey it.  He had already been badly wounded in
3244,III.,"the head by a splinter.  `What will Nelson think of us?' he exclaimed,"
3245,III.,"mournfully, as the frigate wore round.  Just then his clerk was killed"
3246,III.,"by his side, and directly afterwards another shot struck down some"
3247,III.,marines who were hauling in the main-brace.  It seemed as if not a man
3248,III.,"on board could escape, `Come, then, my boys,' exclaimed their brave"
3249,III.,"Captain Riou, `let us all die together!'  They were the last words he"
3250,III.,ever spoke.  The next moment a shot cut him in two.  There was not a
3251,III.,"more gallant officer, or one the men loved better, in the service."
3252,III.,
3253,III.,"""Well, as I was saying, on we went at it for four long hours.  In spite"
3254,III.,"of the shot, and bullets, and splinters flying about on every side, I"
3255,III.,had not had a scratch.  Several poor fellows had been struck down close
3256,III.,"to me.  I cannot say that I thought that I should not be hit, because"
3257,III.,the truth is I did not think about the matter.  I went on working at my
3258,III.,"gun like the rest, only just trying how fast we could fire, and how we"
3259,III.,could do most damage to the enemy.  That's the way to gain the victory;
3260,III.,it does not do to think of anything else.  At last I felt a blow as if
3261,III.,"some one had struck me on the side, and down I went.  My trousers and"
3262,III.,"belt were singed and torn, and the blood started from my side; but I"
3263,III.,"bound my handkerchief over the wound, and in a little time got up and"
3264,III.,"went back to my gun, and there I stayed till the fighting was done, and"
3265,III.,"then I let them carry me below to the cockpit, for walk by myself I"
3266,III.,could not.
3267,III.,
3268,III.,"""Some of our ships suffered dreadfully.  The `Monarch' lost two hundred"
3269,III.,"and ten men, the `Isis' a hundred and ten, and the `Bellona'"
3270,III.,"seventy-five, and all the other ships great numbers.  At last, however,"
3271,III.,"the Danes could stand it no longer, and ship after ship struck; but"
3272,III.,"still the shore batteries kept firing on, and killed great numbers of"
3273,III.,"men on board the prizes.  One of their ships, the `Danbrog,' after she"
3274,III.,"had struck and was in flames, fired on our boats.  Notwithstanding this,"
3275,III.,"when she was seen drifting away before the wind, the fire gaining on"
3276,III.,"her, Captain Bertie, of the `Ardent,' sent his boats to the assistance"
3277,III.,of the poor fellows as they leaped out of the ports to escape the
3278,III.,"flames.  At last Lord Nelson, wishing to put a stop to the carnage,"
3279,III.,"wrote to the Crown Prince, the Danish commander, saying if he did not"
3280,III.,cease firing he must burn the prizes.  A wafer was brought him.  `That
3281,III.,"will not do,' said he, `we must not appear in a hurry; bring a candle"
3282,III.,"and sealing-wax.'  Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger, with a flag of truce,"
3283,III.,"took the letter, and after some time the Danes sent one in return to"
3284,III.,"arrange what was to be done, and the battle of Copenhagen, for so it was"
3285,III.,"called, was over."
3286,III.,
3287,III.,"""While negotiations were going on, Lord Nelson ordered the ships to take"
3288,III.,"advantage of a fair wind, and to start out of the narrow channels.  As"
3289,III.,"we in the `Elephant' were going out we grounded, as did the `Defiance,'"
3290,III.,"about a mile from the Trekroner battery, and there we remained for many"
3291,III.,"hours.  At last, however, we got off.  We had to burn all our prizes"
3292,III.,"except one ship, the `Holstein,' 64, which was sent home.  The next day"
3293,III.,"Lord Nelson went on shore to visit the prince, and settle matters.  He"
3294,III.,"was received with great respect, and he told the Danes that he had never"
3295,III.,"had a braver enemy, or known men fight better than they had done, and"
3296,III.,that now he hoped that they would all be friends again for ever after.
3297,III.,"Lord Nelson now returned to the `Saint George,' and the fleet sailed to"
3298,III.,"the eastward to look after the Swedes.  We were off Bornholm, but the"
3299,III.,`Saint George' could not get through a shallow channel which had to be
3300,III.,"passed, and was some twelve leagues astern of us.  Every minute we"
3301,III.,"expected to be engaged with the enemy.  At midnight, who should step on"
3302,III.,"board the `Elephant' but Lord Nelson himself.  The night was very cold,"
3303,III.,"but he had come all that distance in an open boat without even a cloak,"
3304,III.,"so eager was he to be present at the expected battle.  None took place,"
3305,III.,"and after a little time I was sent home invalided."""
3306,III.,
3307,IV.,IV.
3308,IV.,
3309,IV.,"""When I came home from the Baltic, I and others were landed at Yarmouth,"
3310,IV.,and sent to the hospital.  I was some time in getting well.  I'll tell
3311,IV.,you what set me on my legs again.  One day as I was lying on my bed in
3312,IV.,"the crowded ward, thinking if I should ever recover, and be fit for sea"
3313,IV.,"again, the news came that a brig of war had entered the harbour with"
3314,IV.,"Lord Nelson on board.  Would you believe it, I was thanking Heaven that"
3315,IV.,"our brave admiral had come back safe, and was in a half dreamy, dozing"
3316,IV.,"state, when I heard a cheer, and opening my eyes there he was himself"
3317,IV.,"going round from bed to bed, and talking to each of the men.  He knew me"
3318,IV.,"at once, and told me that I must make haste and get well and join his"
3319,IV.,"ship, as it wouldn't be long probably before he again hoisted his flag."
3320,IV.,
3321,IV.,"""`You shall have any rating you like, remember that,' said he, taking my"
3322,IV.,hand.  `We must have medals and prize-money for you; you have gallantly
3323,IV.,"won them, all of you.'"
3324,IV.,
3325,IV.,"""He passed on, for he had a kind word to say to many hundred poor"
3326,IV.,fellows that day.  When I got well I went home for a spell; but before
3327,IV.,long I heard that Lord Nelson had hoisted his flag as commander-in-chief
3328,IV.,"of the channel squadron on hoard the `Medusa' frigate.  I went on board,"
3329,IV.,and the admiral instantly rated me as quartermaster.  We had plenty of
3330,IV.,"work before us, for General Bonaparte, who was now Emperor of France,"
3331,IV.,wanted to come and invade England.  He had got a flotilla of gunboats
3332,IV.,"all ready to carry over his army, and he had a large fleet besides."
3333,IV.,Many people thought he would succeed.  We knew that the wooden walls of
3334,IV.,"old England were her best defence, and so we afloat never believed that"
3335,IV.,a French soldier would ever set foot on our shores.
3336,IV.,
3337,IV.,"""They had, however, a large flotilla in Boulogne harbour, and it was"
3338,IV.,determined to destroy it with the boats of the squadron.  I volunteered
3339,IV.,for one of out boats.  The boats were in three divisions.  We left the
3340,IV.,"ships a little before midnight.  It was very dark, and the divisions got"
3341,IV.,separated.  We knew that it was desperate work we were on.  Ours was the
3342,IV.,only division which reached the harbour.  There were batteries defending
3343,IV.,"the place, and troops on the shore, and soldiers on board the flotilla,"
3344,IV.,"and the outer vessels were guarded with iron spikes, and had boarding"
3345,IV.,"nets triced up, and were lashed together.  In we darted.  It was"
3346,IV.,"desperate work, and the fire of the great guns and musketry soon showed"
3347,IV.,"our enemies to us, and us to them."
3348,IV.,
3349,IV.,"""`Just keep off, you brave Englishmen, you can do nothing here,' sung"
3350,IV.,out a French officer in very plain English.
3351,IV.,
3352,IV.,"""`We'll try that!' was our reply, as we dashed on board, in spite of"
3353,IV.,iron spikes and boarding nettings.  On we went; we cut out several of
3354,IV.,"the vessels, and were making off with them with loads of Frenchmen on"
3355,IV.,"board, when, would you believe it, if the enemy didn't open their fire"
3356,IV.,"on the boats, killing their own people as well as us.  To my mind, those"
3357,IV.,"French, in war, are as bad as cannibals--that's what Lord Nelson always"
3358,IV.,said of them.  If it hadn't been for this we should have burned or
3359,IV.,captured most of them.  While I was just springing on board another
3360,IV.,"vessel, among the flashes from the guns, the flames and smoke, the"
3361,IV.,"hissing and rattling shot, I got a knock on my head which sent me back"
3362,IV.,into the bottom of the boat.  I knew nothing more till I found myself on
3363,IV.,"board my own ship, and heard that we had lost some hundred and seventy"
3364,IV.,"poor fellows.  I was sent to the hospital, where one of our gallant"
3365,IV.,"leaders, Captain Parker, died of his wounds."
3366,IV.,
3367,IV.,"""The next ship I found myself on board was the `Victory.'  There wasn't"
3368,IV.,"a finer ship in the navy, more weatherly or more handy--steered like a"
3369,IV.,"duck, and worked like a top.  Lord Nelson himself got me appointed to"
3370,IV.,her.  Away we sailed for the Mediterranean.  While Admiral Cornwallis
3371,IV.,"watched the French fleet at Brest, we kept a look-out over that at"
3372,IV.,"Toulon under the command of Admiral La Touche Treville, who had"
3373,IV.,"commanded at Boulogne, and boasted that he had beat off Lord Nelson from"
3374,IV.,"that port.  He could not boast, though, that he beat him off from"
3375,IV.,"Toulon; for, for eighteen long months, from the 1st of July, 1803, to"
3376,IV.,"the 11th of January, 1805, did we keep watch off that harbour's mouth."
3377,IV.,"If such a gale sprung up as would prevent the French getting out, we"
3378,IV.,"went away, only leaving a frigate or so to watch what took place; but we"
3379,IV.,"were soon to be back again.  Thus the time passed on.  We saw the shore,"
3380,IV.,"but were not the better for it; for few of us, from the admiral"
3381,IV.,"downwards, ever set foot on it.  At last the French admiral, La Touche"
3382,IV.,"Treville, died, and a new one, Admiral Villeneuve, was appointed.  We"
3383,IV.,now began to hope that the French would come out and fight us; for you
3384,IV.,see Lord Nelson did not want to keep them in--only to get at them when
3385,IV.,"they came out.  If it hadn't been for the batteries on shore, we should"
3386,IV.,have gone in and brought them out.  We had gone away to the coast of
3387,IV.,"Sardinia, when news was brought that the French fleet was at sea."
3388,IV.,"Instantly we got under weigh, passing at night through a passage so"
3389,IV.,"narrow that only one ship could pass at a time, and fully expecting the"
3390,IV.,next morning to be engaged with the enemy.  First we looked for them
3391,IV.,"about Sicily; then after them we ran towards Egypt, and then back to"
3392,IV.,"Malta, where we heard that they had put into Toulon.  Now, we kept"
3393,IV.,"stricter watch than ever, without a bulkhead up, and all ready for"
3394,IV.,battle.
3395,IV.,
3396,IV.,"""It was on the 4th of April, that the `Phoebe' brought us news that"
3397,IV.,"Admiral Villeneuve, with his squadron, had again slipped out of Toulon,"
3398,IV.,and was steering for the coast of Africa.  Frigates were sent out in
3399,IV.,"every direction, to make sure that he had not gone eastward; and then"
3400,IV.,"after him we stood, towards the Straits of Gibraltar, but the wind was"
3401,IV.,"dead against us, and we had hard work to get there.  I had never seen"
3402,IV.,the admiral in such a taking before.  We beat backwards and forwards
3403,IV.,"against the head-wind, but all to no purpose--out of the Gut we could"
3404,IV.,"not get without a leading-wind, and so we had to anchor off the Barbary"
3405,IV.,coast; there we got supplies.
3406,IV.,
3407,IV.,"""At last, on the 5th of May, an easterly breeze sprung up, and away we"
3408,IV.,"went, with a flowing sheet, through the Straits.  We called off Cadiz,"
3409,IV.,"and the coast of Portugal, and then bore away for the West Indies, where"
3410,IV.,"we heard the French had gone.  We sighted Madeira, and made Barbadoes,"
3411,IV.,"then sailed for Tobago; and next we were off for the Gulf of Paria, all"
3412,IV.,"cleared for action, making sure that we should find the enemy there.  We"
3413,IV.,thought it would have killed the admiral when he found that he had been
3414,IV.,"deceived.  Back we sailed, and heard that the French had captured the"
3415,IV.,"Diamond Rock.  You've heard about it.  It's a curious place, and was"
3416,IV.,commissioned like a man-of-war.  If it hadn't been for false
3417,IV.,"information, and if Lord Nelson had stuck to his own intentions, we"
3418,IV.,"should have caught the French up off Port Royal, and thrashed them just"
3419,IV.,at the spot Lord Rodney thrashed Admiral de Grasse--so I've heard say.
3420,IV.,"Well, at last, we found that the French had left the West Indies for"
3421,IV.,"Europe, so back across the Atlantic we steered, but though we knew we"
3422,IV.,"were close astern of them, they kept ahead of us, and at last we sighted"
3423,IV.,"Cape Spartel, and anchored the next day at Gibraltar."
3424,IV.,
3425,IV.,"""I know it for a fact, that it only wanted ten days of two years since"
3426,IV.,Lord Nelson himself had last set his foot on shore.  It was much longer
3427,IV.,than that since I and most on board had trod dry ground.  That was
3428,IV.,"serving our country, you'll allow--most of the time, too, under weigh,"
3429,IV.,"battling with tempests, and broiling under the sun of the tropics."
3430,IV.,
3431,IV.,"""We victualled and watered at Tetuan, then once more stood to the"
3432,IV.,"west'ard--then back to Cadiz, and once more crossed the Bay of Biscay,"
3433,IV.,thinking the enemy were bound for Ireland.  Foul winds made the passage
3434,IV.,"long.  Once more the enemy had baffled us, and at last, when off Ushant,"
3435,IV.,we received orders to return to Portsmouth to refit.
3436,IV.,
3437,IV.,"""That very fleet Sir Robert Calder fell in with on the 22nd of July,"
3438,IV.,"just thirty leagues westward of Cape Finisterre, and, although his force"
3439,IV.,"was much smaller, he captured two of their line-of-battle ships.  It was"
3440,IV.,"a very gallant affair; but people asked, `What would Nelson have done?'"
3441,IV.,While the admiral was on shore we were busily employed in refitting the
3442,IV.,"`Victory,' while a number of other ships he had wished to have with him"
3443,IV.,were got ready for sea.  On the 14th of September he once more came
3444,IV.,"aboard the `Victory,' and hoisted his flag.  The next day, we sailed for"
3445,IV.,"Cadiz.  We arrived off that place on the 29th, where we found the"
3446,IV.,squadron of Admiral Collingwood blockading the French and Spanish fleets
3447,IV.,under Admiral Villeneuve.
3448,IV.,
3449,IV.,"""What Lord Nelson wanted, you see, was to get the enemy out to fight"
3450,IV.,"him.  He wanted also, not only to win a victory, but to knock the"
3451,IV.,"enemy's ships to pieces, so that they could do no more harm.  To get"
3452,IV.,them out we had to cut off their supplies; so we had to capture all the
3453,IV.,neutral vessels which were carrying them in.  You must understand we in
3454,IV.,"the `Victory' with the fleet did not go close into Cadiz, but kept some"
3455,IV.,"fifty or sixty miles off, so that the enemy might not know our strength."
3456,IV.,"We had some time to wait, however.  Lord Nelson had already given the"
3457,IV.,"French and Spaniards such a taste of his way of going to work, that they"
3458,IV.,were in no hurry to try it again.  You'll understand that there was a
3459,IV.,"line of frigates, extending, like signal-posts, all the way from the"
3460,IV.,fleet to the frigate cruising just off the mouth of the harbour--that is
3461,IV.,"to say, near enough to watch what was going on there."
3462,IV.,
3463,IV.,"""Early in the morning on the 19th of October, the `Mars,' the ship"
3464,IV.,"nearest the chain of frigates, repeated the signal that the enemy were"
3465,IV.,"leaving port, and, at two p.m., that they were steering south-east.  On"
3466,IV.,"this Lord Nelson gave orders for the fleet to chase in that direction,"
3467,IV.,"but to keep out of sight of the enemy, fearful of frightening them back"
3468,IV.,"into port.  Still, you'll understand, the frigates kept in sight of"
3469,IV.,"them, and gave notice to the admiral of all their movements.  The enemy"
3470,IV.,"had thirty-three sail of the line, and seven frigates, with above 4000"
3471,IV.,riflemen on board.  Our fleet numbered only twenty-seven sail of the
3472,IV.,"line, and four frigates.  We were formed in two lines.  Admiral"
3473,IV.,"Collingwood, in the `Royal Sovereign,' led fourteen ships, and Lord"
3474,IV.,"Nelson, in the `Victory,' eleven."
3475,IV.,
3476,IV.,"""On the morning of the 21st of October, 1805--you'll not forget that"
3477,IV.,"day, it was a glorious one for England, let me tell you--we sighted the"
3478,IV.,French and Spanish fleet from the deck of the `Victory' off Cape
3479,IV.,"Trafalgar.  They were formed in a double line in a curve, one ship in"
3480,IV.,the further line filling up the space left between the ships of the
3481,IV.,nearest line.  They also were trying to keep the port of Cadiz under
3482,IV.,"their lee, that they might escape to it.  Lord Nelson determined to"
3483,IV.,break the line in two places.  We led the northern line with a light
3484,IV.,"wind from the south-west.  Admiral Collingwood led the southern, and got"
3485,IV.,"into action first, just astern of the `Santa Anna.'  We steered so as to"
3486,IV.,pass between the `Bucentaur' and the `Santissima Trinidade.'
3487,IV.,
3488,IV.,"""`Well, there are a lot of the enemy,' exclaimed Tom Collins to me, as I"
3489,IV.,was standing near the gun he served.
3490,IV.,
3491,IV.,"""`Yes, mate,' said I; `and a pretty spectacle they will make at Spithead"
3492,IV.,when we carry them there.'
3493,IV.,
3494,IV.,"""`Ay, that they will,' cried all who heard me, and I believe every man"
3495,IV.,in the fleet felt as we did.
3496,IV.,
3497,IV.,"""We were watching all this time the magnificent way in which the brave"
3498,IV.,and good Admiral Collingwood stood into action and opened his fire.
3499,IV.,That was about noon.  There was a general cheer on board our ship and
3500,IV.,all the ships of the fleet.  At our masthead flew a signal.  We soon
3501,IV.,knew what it meant.  It was--`England expects that every man will do his
3502,IV.,duty.'  For nearly half an hour the noble Collingwood was alone among
3503,IV.,"the ships of the enemy before any of his followers could come up.  We,"
3504,IV.,"at the same time, had got within long range of the enemy.  On we floated"
3505,IV.,"slowly, for the wind was very light, till at last our mainyard-arm was"
3506,IV.,"touching the gaff of the `Bucentaur,' which ship bore the flag of"
3507,IV.,Admiral Villeneuve; and though our guns were raking her and tearing her
3508,IV.,"stern to pieces, we had ahead of us in the second line the `Neptune,'"
3509,IV.,"which poured a heavy fire into our bows.  Our helm was then put up, and"
3510,IV.,"we fell aboard the `Redoubtable,' while the `Temeraire,' Captain"
3511,IV.,"Blackwood, ranged up on the other side of her, and another French ship"
3512,IV.,"got alongside the `Temeraire.'  There we were all four locked together,"
3513,IV.,"pounding away at each other, while with our larboard guns we were"
3514,IV.,"engaging the `Bucentaur,' and now and then getting a shot at the big"
3515,IV.,"Spaniard, the `Santissima Trinidade'.  Meantime our other ships had each"
3516,IV.,"picked out one or more of the enemy, and were hotly engaged with them."
3517,IV.,At the tops of all the enemy's ships marksmen were stationed.  The
3518,IV.,skylight of the admiral's cabin had been boarded over.  Here Lord Nelson
3519,IV.,and Captain Hardy were walking.  More than one man had fallen near them.
3520,IV.,"Mr Scott, the admiral's secretary, had been struck down after we had"
3521,IV.,been in action little more than an hour.  Suddenly as I turned my head I
3522,IV.,saw a sight which I would rather have died than have seen.  Lord Nelson
3523,IV.,"was just falling.  He went on his knees, then rested on his arm for a"
3524,IV.,"moment, and it, too, giving way, he rolled over on his left side, before"
3525,IV.,even Captain Hardy could run to save him.  Captain Hardy had to remain
3526,IV.,"on deck.  I, with a sergeant of marines and another seaman, carried him"
3527,IV.,"below, covering his face with a handkerchief.  We placed him in one of"
3528,IV.,the midshipmen's berths.  Then the surgeons came to him.  We feared the
3529,IV.,"worst, but it was not generally known what had happened.  I can tell you"
3530,IV.,I was glad enough to get on deck again.  It was bad enough there to see
3531,IV.,"poor fellows struck down alongside one, but the sights and sounds in the"
3532,IV.,cockpit were enough to overcome the stoutest heart--to see fine strong
3533,IV.,"fellows mangled and torn, struggling in their agony--to watch limb after"
3534,IV.,"limb cut off--to hear their groans and shrieks, and often worse, the"
3535,IV.,oaths and imprecations of the poor fellows maddened by the terrible
3536,IV.,"pain; and there lay our beloved chief mortally wounded in the spine,"
3537,IV.,"parched with thirst and heat, crying out for air and drink to cool the"
3538,IV.,fever raging within.  For two hours and a half there he lay suffering
3539,IV.,"dreadful pain, yet eagerly inquiring how the battle was going.  Twice"
3540,IV.,"Captain Hardy went below to see him; the first time, to tell him that"
3541,IV.,twelve of the enemy had struck; the last time that still more had given
3542,IV.,"in, and that a few were in full flight, after whom our guns were still"
3543,IV.,sending their shot.  Thus Lord Nelson died at the moment the
3544,IV.,ever-to-be-remembered battle of Trafalgar was won.
3545,IV.,
3546,IV.,"""It was a sad voyage we had home, and great was the sorrow felt by all,"
3547,IV.,"from the highest to the lowest in the land, for the death of our beloved"
3548,IV.,"leader.  I will not describe his funeral.  It was very grand, that I"
3549,IV.,know.  Many of the old `Victory's' attended his coffin to his grave in
3550,IV.,Saint Paul's Cathedral.  When they were lowering his flag into the
3551,IV.,tomb--that flag which had truly so long and so gloriously waved in the
3552,IV.,"battle and the breeze--we seized on it and tearing it in pieces, vowed"
3553,IV.,"to keep it as long as we lived, in remembrance of our noble chief.  Here"
3554,IV.,"is my bit--see, I keep it safe in this case near my heart."""
3555,IV.,
3556,IV.,England's greatest military chief now lies by the side of one who had no
3557,IV.,"equal on the ocean, in the heart of her metropolis.  Within the walls of"
3558,IV.,"her finest cathedral, what more appropriate mausoleum could be found for"
3559,IV.,"Britain's two most valiant defenders, Heaven-sent surely in the time of"
3560,IV.,her greatest need to defend her from the hosts of her vaunting foes.

3567,IV.,"France, then ruled by the tyrannical and cruel Convention.  The story of"

3855,"AN ADVENTURE ON THE BLACK MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES M. WILBRAHAM.",
3856,"AN ADVENTURE ON THE BLACK MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES M. WILBRAHAM.",To be brief.  We insisted on keeping Spira and the child with us till

3933,II.,"had Mr Popham been a less conscientious guardian, I might have been"
3934,II.,"exposed to many privations, ay, and temptations too.  As it was, he"
3935,II.,"nursed my little inheritance carefully, put me to a good though strict"
3936,II.,"school, and arranged that I should spend my holidays at his house.  Mrs"
3937,II.,"Popham (the mother of Francis, now head of our firm) was a mother to me"
3938,II.,"also, and her early death was my first keen and lasting grief.  It made"
3939,II.,"Francis and me cling closely to one another, the more so because"
3940,II.,bereavement added much to the natural sternness of Mr Popham's
3941,II.,character.  Our holidays for the next three years were seasons rather of
3942,II.,"restraint than of enjoyment, but bright days returned when he married"
3943,II.,"the second Mrs Popham, a young Greek of extraordinary beauty and"

3947,II.,"quite formed at that time, and his habits of business and order were"

3952,II.,"the service of the house abroad, but I think our friendship is such as"
3953,II.,"to stand the test of absence, ay, and of calumny too.  I do not, cannot,"

3986,II.,"his real age, twenty-two; his delicate features, glowing with"
3987,II.,"excitement; and his deep, blue eyes, with tears gathering on their long"
3988,II.,"lashes, I no longer marvelled at the tenderness with which my husband"
3989,II.,"had always spoken of him; my recent dislike quickly melted away, and"
3990,II.,kind feelings sprang up in its place.  These feelings speedily took the
3991,II.,"practical shape of providing dry clothes, supper and bed for our guest,"
3992,II.,who seemed really distressed at giving me any trouble.  He positively
3993,II.,"declined supper, saying, ""he had dined late on the steamer.""  As for"
3994,II.,"bed, why it was hardly worth while preparing that, for he must be up and"
3995,II.,"away by daybreak.  ""He should go with a lighter heart now Laurie had"
3996,II.,"forgiven him."""
3997,II.,
3998,II.,"""Go, and whither?"" inquired your uncle who out or delicacy had"
3999,II.,restrained his eager longing to learn how the affairs of the house
4000,II.,stood.
4001,II.,
4002,II.,"""I hardly know,"" answered Mr Popham; ""that's the point I want to"
4003,II.,"discuss with you, Englefield.  I think I must go to Scutari, as that"
4004,II.,rascal Orlando Jones appears to have crossed the Turkish frontier in
4005,II.,"that direction.  I must, at any rate, track and secure those diamonds."
4006,II.,I can never face Francis otherwise; you know they were entrusted to our
4007,II.,"care so specially."""
4008,II.,
4009,II.,"My husband had listened in speechless astonishment to these disclosures,"
4010,II.,and I saw him turn pale.  Mr Popham saw it too.
4011,II.,
4012,II.,"""Is it possible, my dear Laurence,"" he said, ""that you had not heard of"
4013,II.,"Jones's having absconded?  Why, I wrote you five days ago a penitential"
4014,II.,"letter, and a full, true, and particular account of the rascal's"
4015,II.,"moonlight flitting; if, as it seems, you had never received my apology,"
4016,II.,I wonder you didn't shut your door in my face; but you _are_ the best
4017,II.,"fellow in the world."""
4018,II.,
4019,II.,"""Nonsense,"" was the blunt reply; ""drink that glass of mulled wine, John,"
4020,II.,"I insist upon it, and then come with me.  I must know all, that we may"
4021,II.,"see what's to be done, and do it at once."""
4022,II.,
4023,II.,I saw little more of Laurie that evening; their voices might be heard
4024,II.,through the thin wall in earnest talk.  Then he went out into the town
4025,II.,with a brow full of care and thought.  He would not let young Popham go
4026,II.,"with him, but ordered him off to bed, observing."
4027,II.,
4028,II.,"""We will start early if I can obtain to-night from the authorities a"
4029,II.,"pass into the Turkish dominions.  My Cattarese servant, a sharp fellow,"
4030,II.,"will soon find us horses and a guide for the journey."""
4031,II.,
4032,II.,"""Then you are going with me?  God bless you, Laurie,"" said John Popham,"
4033,II.,earnestly.
4034,II.,
4035,II.,"""Of course I am,"" growled your uncle."
4036,II.,
4037,II.,"With an aching heart, I put the finishing touches to Laurie's travelling"
4038,II.,"gear, then went to bed, but not to quiet or refreshing sleep.  There is"
4039,II.,"generally something depressing, I think, in a very early setting out; my"
4040,II.,"heart sinks now as I recall the breakfast by lamplight; faint, bluish"
4041,II.,"dawn just marking the square outline of the window; the horses' tread,"
4042,II.,as our man servant walked them up and down before the doors--the last
4043,II.,words and directions hastily given by the travellers.  Laurie found a
4044,II.,"moment to take me aside and say: ""Cattie, I think we shall be back very"
4045,II.,"shortly; Scutari, whither we can trace Jones, is but a few miles distant"
4046,II.,"and our journey attended with little or no risk, as we are well armed,"
4047,II.,"fairly mounted, and provided with a passport in due form.  I have"
4048,II.,letters too to the Pasha which _may_ induce him to assist us in our
4049,II.,"search after that rascal."""
4050,II.,
4051,II.,"""Have you much hope of catching him?""  I asked."
4052,II.,
4053,II.,"Laurie shook his head.  ""I confess I have very little,"" he said; ""yet it"
4054,II.,"seems worth the attempt at all events; Johnnie is bent on making it, and"
4055,II.,"I can't let him go alone, poor boy!  Ah, had his letter reached me four"
4056,II.,"days ago, as it would have done had he trusted it to fitting hands, we"
4057,II.,"should have had a much better chance;"" and he fairly stamped his foot"
4058,II.,with vexation.
4059,II.,
4060,II.,"Well, they started; it was a Tuesday, and several days dragged their"
4061,II.,"slow length along, without any tidings of the absentees.  Saturday"
4062,II.,"morning came, and brought a throng of mountain women to market,"
4063,II.,"unaccompanied, for the first time, by their husbands.  Spira was there,"
4064,II.,"and delighted to see me, but even to her I could not hint my troubles,"
4065,II.,as the good understanding then existing between Austria and England and
4066,II.,"the Turks, was a very sore subject to a Montenegrin.  So I replied but"
4067,II.,"vaguely to her inquiries after my lord and master, and begged to know"
4068,II.,why _hers_ had not made his appearance as usual.
4069,II.,
4070,II.,"""Oh, your Excellency, he is much better employed,"" she replied, ""than"
4071,II.,coming down here to buy salt; have you not heard? has nobody told you
4072,II.,"the new outrage committed by those Turkish dogs? our deadly foe, the"
4073,II.,"Pasha of Scutari, without notice or warning, has attacked our Bishop's"
4074,II.,"island fort of Lessandro, at the head of the Scutari lake, and taken it;"
4075,II.,"ten of our men have been killed, my father's brother's son amongst them,"
4076,II.,"and ten taken prisoners.  The Bishop is mad about it, and Basil and all"
4077,II.,"the picked men are flocking to him.  The Pasha himself is at Lessandro,"""
4078,II.,"added Spira, ""may a bullet from our Vladika's rifle whiz through his"
4079,II.,brain shortly!  But what ails your Excellency? you shiver like our
4080,II.,"silver aspen leaves."""
4081,II.,
4082,II.,I did indeed feel great disquiet at the thought of the wild work my
4083,II.,"husband might be witnessing, and finding Spira's conversation too"
4084,II.,"warlike to suit my taste, walked homewards slowly, bidding her follow"
4085,II.,with the marketings.  In our sitting-room I found Mr Popham!
4086,II.,
4087,II.,"He came up and took my two hands in his, as if he had been the friend of"
4088,II.,"a lifetime, instead of the acquaintance of an evening."
4089,II.,
4090,II.,"""I think, I hope he is safe,"" he said, looking very white."
4091,II.,
4092,II.,"""How safe?""  I asked; ""tell me _all_, Mr Popham, if you please."""
4093,II.,
4094,II.,"""I will,"" he answered; ""it is a flesh-wound in the shoulder, nothing of"
4095,II.,"consequence, on my honour; he bade me tell you so, with his love."""
4096,II.,
4097,II.,"""Am I to understand that you have left Mr Englefield wounded?""  I"
4098,II.,"asked; it never struck me, in my consternation, that I had worded the"
4099,II.,"question harshly, till I saw Mr Popham's look of deep distress.  There"
4100,II.,"was not the least anger in the crimson glow that suffused his face, nor"
4101,II.,"in his voice as he huskily answered: ""I deserve this for my cruel"
4102,II.,"ingratitude towards him at Ragusa, but, on my honour, Mrs Englefield, I"
4103,II.,"am not to blame for leaving him now, nor shall I know rest till I am"
4104,II.,"again at his side."""
4105,II.,
4106,II.,"""Thank you, thank you,"" I answered; ""we will lose no time in going to"
4107,II.,"him; and now, let me hear some particulars."""
4108,II.,
4109,II.,"""We reached Scutari all right,"" said Mr Popham; ""the Pasha had just"
4110,II.,left it to attack a fort belonging to the Prince of the Black Mountain;
4111,II.,"so we followed, and reached the camp just as the fort was being stormed."
4112,II.,"That evening we had an audience of the Pasha, in which Englefield laid"
4113,II.,"the whole matter before him; he spoke us fair, and promised help, but it"
4114,II.,"was all a sham, a regular sham; you will not wonder this when I tell you"
4115,II.,"that Orlando Jones, unseen by us was at the Pasha's elbow, bribing,"
4116,II.,"cringing, and sticking at nothing to gain his ends!  It seems the"
4117,II.,"wretched man has long been in communication with the Turks, and has now"
4118,II.,"adopted the Mussulman creed and dress.  In requital, a lucrative post"
4119,II.,"has been conferred on him."""
4120,II.,
4121,II.,"""But to return to Laurie: on Thursday night, finding the Pasha still"
4122,II.,"impracticable, he advised our return to Cattaro next morning; we took"
4123,II.,our leave of that dignitary and retired to the hut assigned us by the
4124,II.,"Turkish quartermaster, in a wretched village near the head of the lake."
4125,II.,"A force of some two hundred Turks guarded the place, but so negligently"
4126,II.,that before daybreak they were surprised and overpowered by a daring
4127,II.,band of Black Mountaineers.  Our share in this transaction was rather
4128,II.,passive than active; in fact I was dead asleep till the door of the hut
4129,II.,"was burst in; I then saw Englefield, who had been vainly trying to shake"
4130,II.,"me into consciousness, deliberately place himself between me and the"
4131,II.,"intruders.  That was a perilous moment; several swords were aimed at us,"
4132,II.,"and one came down on Laurie's shoulder, inflicting the wound I have"
4133,II.,mentioned.  I must confess that its effect would have been far more
4134,II.,"serious, but for a most strange and providential circumstance.  A"
4135,II.,stalwart young mountaineer no sooner caught a glimpse of your husband's
4136,II.,"face, than he rushed forward, grasped his comrade's arm, so as to weaken"
4137,II.,"the blow he could not quite avert, then threw himself on Laurie's neck"
4138,II.,"with wild yells of delight.  A few words from this `Basil,' as they"
4139,II.,"called him, to his companions, changed their murderous fury into"
4140,II.,"enthusiasm.  Laurie was hoisted on their shoulders, and carried at a"
4141,II.,"sort of shuffling trot a little way up the mountain, just within the"
4142,II.,"frontier of Montenegro; I followed close at their heels, and saw him"
4143,II.,"deposited in a hut, and his wound dressed by one of these gigantic"
4144,II.,"highlanders.  I watched by him for several hours afterwards."""
4145,II.,
4146,II.,"""And how did he seem?""  I asked anxiously, for I well remembered"
4147,II.,Laurie's telling me before we left England that he was of a feverish
4148,II.,"temperament, and that hurts which others would recover from quickly,"
4149,II.,became from that cause serious matters with him.  The answer rather
4150,II.,"increased my fears.  He had fallen into a doze, but wakened within an"
4151,II.,hour a good deal excited.  Perhaps the extreme roughness of the bed they
4152,II.,"had laid him in, contributed to his unrest, also the heavy anxiety on"
4153,II.,"his mind.  He had talked confusedly of Orlando Jones, then he almost"
4154,II.,"raved about me, first begging I might not be told of his state, then"
4155,II.,"changing his mind suddenly, and entreating them to bring me to him.  You"
4156,II.,will easily believe that I did not require such a summons to make me
4157,II.,hasten to his side.
4158,II.,
4159,II.,"An old mountaineer, past fighting, who had guided Mr Popham to Cattaro,"
4160,II.,"offered me his escort, and Spira, who was at the door with her mule,"
4161,II.,went into an ecstasy of delight at the prospect of showing her dear
4162,II.,"native crags to ""our lady,"" as she called me.  I hastily put together"
4163,II.,"needful clothes for myself and Laurie, old linen, a change of sheets for"
4164,II.,"my dear patient, tea, arrow-root, and other provisions, and a selection"
4165,II.,from the precious medicine-chest.  These were packed on one side of the
4166,II.,"stout mule, and a seat for me was devised on the other side.  Happily"
4167,II.,"for the animal, I was as light as a feather in those days.  Seeing Mr"
4168,II.,"Popham pale and fatigued, I urged him to remain at our house till his"
4169,II.,"strength was recruited, and rejoin us the next Tuesday, when he would"
4170,II.,easily find a competent guide in the market-place; but he rejected this
4171,II.,"advice with vehemence, and after swallowing some refreshment and writing"
4172,II.,"several letters to Ragusa and England, declared himself quite ready for"
4173,II.,a start.  My heart warmed to him for his love of Laurie.
4174,II.,
4175,II.,"Up, up the zigzag path I had so long panted to explore; up, up, we"
4176,II.,"climbed, but under circumstances how different from those I had pictured"
4177,II.,"to myself!  No Laurie at my side, enjoying every beautiful thing in"
4178,II.,"earth, air, or sky, showing me what to sketch and how to sketch it; but"
4179,II.,"vague, uneasy thoughts of him on his feverish couch and among half"
4180,II.,"savage people.  The channel of Cattaro lay below us, its jagged shores,"
4181,II.,"studded with pretty villages; on all sides were craggy grey peaks,"
4182,II.,"rising one behind the other, a sky of hazy blue arching over all.  My"
4183,II.,guide Giuro was full of apologies for the roughness of the track we rode
4184,II.,"upon, telling me the old Montenegrin legend ""that at the Creation, the"
4185,II.,"bag which held the stones to be distributed over the earth, burst, and"
4186,II.,"let them all fall on the Black Mountain."""
4187,II.,
4188,II.,The road certainly was as bad as possible; but my mule advanced
4189,II.,"sturdily, by jumps and jerks, till we reached the top of the pass."
4190,II.,"There we were, I am afraid to pay how many hundred feet above the sea,"
4191,II.,but overhanging it so completely that a pebble dropped from one's hand
4192,II.,fell into the waves.  The Ragusan steamer looked like a nutshell from
4193,II.,our eminence.
4194,II.,
4195,II.,The ascent had occupied two hours and a half; it took us three more to
4196,II.,"reach our halting-place, Cetigna, Spira's home.  A gentle descent led to"
4197,II.,"the village, and in the distance shimmered a white shroud-like mist,"
4198,II.,which Spira told me covered the lake of Scutari.  Somewhere in that
4199,II.,"direction Laurie must be lying, I knew; and the certainty doubled my"
4200,II.,impatience to get to him.  Old Giuro now raised his voice to the
4201,II.,"shrillest key imaginable, and, in a way peculiar to these mountaineers,"
4202,II.,"who talk to each other from hill tops half a mile asunder, announced"
4203,II.,"that ""our lady"" was approaching.  Whereupon a great hubbub arose; dogs"
4204,II.,"barked, and feminine voices responded eagerly.  Two or three muskets"
4205,II.,"were presently discharged, and the twang of the balls as they passed"
4206,II.,near gave my nerves rather an unpleasant shock.  I did not then know
4207,II.,that the Black Mountaineers always receive their friends thus; in this
4208,II.,"instance female hands had loaded and fired, the men being almost all"
4209,II.,"away fighting.  A band of brightly-clad women, not less than forty in"
4210,II.,"number, now came to meet me, their children frolicking round them, and"
4211,II.,"some boys playing, not very discordantly, the one-stringed fiddle of the"
4212,II.,"country.  At their head walked a grey-haired matron, whom Spira pointed"
4213,II.,"out as her grandmother, and who carried on her shoulder Nilo, looking"
4214,II.,"lovely in a ""strucca"" striped olive-green and mulberry-red.  The dear"
4215,II.,"little fellow knew me at once, and almost sprang to my arms, whereupon"
4216,II.,"the good housewives of Cetigna uttered a screech of delight, closed"
4217,II.,"round me and kissed my cloak, hands, and even lips with a fervour I"
4218,II.,could have dispensed with.
4219,II.,
4220,II.,"Mr Popham, much amused with these greetings, pushed forward to the"
4221,II.,little inn of the place to order supper.  I meanwhile yielded to Spira's
4222,II.,"urgent wish, and turned into her cottage to be introduced to the"
4223,II.,"remaining members of her family.  You will smile, children, when you"
4224,II.,hear that I found squatting round the hearth a great-grandfather of a
4225,II.,"hundred years old, and a grandfather of eighty-two; her mother, a"
4226,II.,handsome woman with scarlet vest and girdle encrusted with cornelians
4227,II.,"was there also, and these, with Spira and her boy, made up five"
4228,II.,"generations.  Such patriarchal families, they say, are not uncommon on"
4229,II.,the Black Mountain.  The fire-place was merely a raised hearth in one
4230,II.,"corner of the room, with a cauldron hanging over it.  A lump of dough"
4231,II.,"was baking on the ashes; chimney there was none, so the smoke eddied"
4232,II.,"slowly round, a portion of it making its way into my throat and eyes; at"
4233,II.,"least one pig reposed on the floor of the hut, and I heard a faint"
4234,II.,clucking of poultry roosting in some remote and dusky corner of the
4235,II.,"chamber.  It really was a relief to get away from the motley group, and"
4236,II.,under Spira's guidance I soon reached the clean little inn of Cetigna.
4237,II.,"Here, in the bright, low kitchen, I found Mr Popham on his knees,"
4238,II.,"toasting bread, and at the same time giving our Cattarese landlady"
4239,II.,useful hints as to the grilling of some fine trout her boy had just
4240,II.,"caught.  A quaintly-carved chair had been dragged to the fireside, and"
4241,II.,stuffed with cloaks to supply the want of cushions.  Tea was set forth;
4242,II.,"also a flask of the famous Ragusa Malmesey; a red-legged partridge,"
4243,II.,"intended by the hostess for her own supper, had been carried off for"
4244,II.,"mine, she smiling complacently at the theft, and confiding to Spira that"
4245,II.,"so pleasant a gentleman had never visited the mountain before!  In fact,"
4246,II.,"Mr Popham was now quite in his glory, and as I lazily leaned back in my"
4247,II.,"chair and watched him (for he would not allow me to make myself of use),"
4248,II.,his ingenuity and overflowing good-nature amused and cheered me.  After
4249,II.,"supper we held a little council as to next day's movements, and my"
4250,II.,spirits were further raised by Mr Popham's proposing that we should
4251,II.,"start at five in the morning, so as to get to Laurie by noon.  The"
4252,II.,"indefatigable Spira begged to be our guide; all was settled, and I went"
4253,II.,"to bed in a small adjoining room, feeling almost happy.  It was an"
4254,II.,"untold comfort when alone to pull out my little Bible and Prayer-book,"
4255,II.,"and in that wild region to be able to commend Laurie, myself, and all we"
4256,II.,"loved to _His_ fatherly care ""in whose hand are all the corners of the"
4257,II.,"earth."""

4265,III.,
4266,III.,"If I went to sleep with a cheerful impression of the Black Mountain, my"
4267,III.,"first glance next morning dispelled it.  I woke at four, dressed, and"
4268,III.,"then put my head out of the one small window, from which I could see the"
4269,III.,"village of Cetigna, bathed in white moonlight.  This village, which, by"
4270,III.,"the way, is the capital of Montenegro, seemed to consist of scarcely"
4271,III.,"twenty hovels or houses, scattered about; a corner of a larger building"
4272,III.,"was visible, which I found afterwards was the Prince-bishop's palace.  A"
4273,III.,"crag rose opposite my window, on the top of which stood a low round"
4274,III.,"tower, crowned with at least twenty Turkish skulls, fixed to tall"
4275,III.,stakes.  Strange trophies those Turkish heads were for the residence of
4276,III.,a Christian bishop!  Spira's entrance diverted my eyes and thoughts from
4277,III.,these horrible proofs of Montenegrin ferocity; and after partaking of an
4278,III.,"inviting little breakfast of Mr Popham'a arranging I mounted my mule,"
4279,III.,"and we set out.  He rode also, and Spira and Giuro trudged alongside."
4280,III.,"Leaving Cetigna and its grassy plain behind, we rode down a rough and"
4281,III.,"dangerous ascent.  We saw not a human being till, on turning a sharp"
4282,III.,"corner, we suddenly came on a party of Black Mountaineers--"
4283,III.,"active-looking fellows, coming up from the Turkish frontier, and singing"
4284,III.,snatches of wild songs as they went.  They were going to their homes to
4285,III.,"celebrate some feast, and meant to be back again under their Bishop's"
4286,III.,"standard before night.  As usual with these highland soldiers, they had"
4287,III.,asked nobody's leave but their own for this freak.  They looked hard at
4288,III.,"me and then at Mr Popham, and pointed out to one another, well pleased,"
4289,III.,the Fez cap which he wore and politely took off to them.  Hats and
4290,III.,"European caps of all sorts, you must know, they have a special dislike"
4291,III.,"to.  Spira and some of them exchanged greetings, and in reply to her"
4292,III.,"questions one of them said:--""Basil Basilovich was well at sunset; I saw"
4293,III.,"him with a fresh head at his girdle, guarding the hut of the wounded"
4294,III.,"stranger from the west.""  There was nothing to be gleaned from them"
4295,III.,"respecting Mr Englefield's state, so we pushed on once more, my eyes"
4296,III.,"fixed on the brightening east, where presently the sun came up like a"
4297,III.,"torch.  We now came down on a rapid, clear, green stream, which hurries"
4298,III.,to the Lake of Scutari.
4299,III.,
4300,III.,"The stream widened into a little river, and we suddenly turned to the"
4301,III.,"right, and went down to its bank through a patch of Indian corn seven"
4302,III.,"feet high.  A number of wild ducks flew out of the reeds, startled"
4303,III.,"partly by our approach, partly by that of a boat, in which sat a"
4304,III.,"solitary figure rowing vigorously.  ""It is Basil!"" cried Spira,"
4305,III.,"joyfully.  He heard the voice, looked up, saw her, recognised me with a"
4306,III.,"start of glad surprise, and at once ran his boat ashore, and joined us."
4307,III.,"Spira, after four days' separation, did not know how to make enough of"
4308,III.,"him.  He seemed in his lordly manner truly glad to see her again, and"
4309,III.,asked with much earnestness after his boy.  To me his manner was one of
4310,III.,almost reverential courtesy; scarcely durst I ask him how he had left
4311,III.,"Laurie, but while the question was faltering on my tongue, Spira came"
4312,III.,"out with it in round, unvarnished terms, saying, ""Is our good Englishman"
4313,III.,"alive?--is he better?"""
4314,III.,
4315,III.,"""Alive, but not better,"" answered Basil bluffly; ""a hurt which I should"
4316,III.,have forgotten in three days has eaten into his very flesh and bone;
4317,III.,"there must be devilry in it, and I am on my way to fetch priest Jovan"
4318,III.,"from Nariako to exorcise him."""
4319,III.,
4320,III.,"""Take me to him first, kind Basil,"" said I anxiously; ""I too have"
4321,III.,"soothing spells here,"" pointing to the valise which held my remedies,"
4322,III.,"""nor shall prayers be wanting to aid them.""  I wept as I spoke; Basil,"
4323,III.,"with some odd contortions of feature, meant, I believe, to drive back"
4324,III.,"sympathetic tears, beckoned us to get into the boat.  Spira and he"
4325,III.,"followed with my light baggage, and Giuro remained behind in charge of"
4326,III.,"the animals.  Softly and swiftly we glided along, the green waters"
4327,III.,rippling and gurgling round our boat.  The river gradually widened till
4328,III.,"it grew into a lake, the lovely Lake of Scutari.  Of its beauties I can"
4329,III.,"say little, for, indeed, they fell on a heedless eye; but I remember"
4330,III.,"well the deeply indented shore to our left, under which we stole along,"
4331,III.,"the flocks of ducks and cormorants, and the noble milk-white herons that"
4332,III.,rose up screaming at our approach.
4333,III.,
4334,III.,"""Your husband lies yonder, near the crest of this next hill,"" said Basil"
4335,III.,"to me, indicating by a jerk of his chin a craggy height almost"
4336,III.,"overhanging the water; ""your excellency would see the roof of the hut,"
4337,III.,"but a wild cherry tree hides it.""  Then he explained to me (Mr Popham"
4338,III.,not understanding his dialect) that we had but to double one more
4339,III.,"headland, and we should come to a creek, and a landing-place, and a path"
4340,III.,leading straight to the hut.  You may think how my heart bounded to be
4341,III.,there!
4342,III.,
4343,III.,But we were reckoning without our host.  On rounding the headland there
4344,III.,"was the path indeed, like a white thread on the green height, but it was"
4345,III.,beset by foes.  Several shots fired from that direction showed this too
4346,III.,plainly; and I saw Basil's eyes dilate with wonder and wrath as he
4347,III.,"marked the quick flashes, the smoke, the sharp report of fire-arms in"
4348,III.,"the tall thicket.  The fact was, the enemy had within the last quarter"
4349,III.,"of an hour stolen on a party of mountaineers set to guard that point,"
4350,III.,and surprised them.  Our friends were fighting with their usual
4351,III.,"desperate bravery, but they seemed likely to be worsted.  Basil now"
4352,III.,"signed to Mr Popham that we must turn back, and effect a landing on the"
4353,III.,other side of the headland; and accordingly ten minutes' rowing brought
4354,III.,"us back to that point.  Meanwhile, Mr Popham drew closer to me, and"
4355,III.,"said, with a grave solicitude scarcely natural to him, ""You see the plan"
4356,III.,"is that we should scale the hill on this side, which the enemy has not"
4357,III.,reached--possibly may not attempt to reach.  Once at the top--where
4358,III.,"Laurie is, I mean--you are safe enough, for a strong body of the black"
4359,III.,highlanders is posted there; and the Turks would have no object that I
4360,III.,"could see in attacking them.  But, dear Mrs Englefield, there _is_ a"
4361,III.,certain amount of risk in the ascent.  I ought not to disguise this from
4362,III.,"you.  If it--the ascent, I mean--should occupy much time (and it is so"
4363,III.,steep and tangled that it might prove tedious); and if our friends
4364,III.,"should be driven back speedily, the Turks might be upon us before we"
4365,III.,"reached the crest.  Mind, I don't say it is probable, but it is"
4366,III.,"possible.  For a man the risk is a trifle, not worth thinking twice"
4367,III.,"about; but for a woman!--Good heavens!--that's quite another thing."""
4368,III.,
4369,III.,"He paused, then added, ""The sum of all this is, that I want you to turn"
4370,III.,"back with Spira, and stay at the next hamlet till this alarm is over."
4371,III.,"Basil will guide me back to Laurie, and we will cheer him with the hope"
4372,III.,"of your coming.  I am a poor nurse compared with you, but I'll do my"
4373,III.,"best."""
4374,III.,
4375,III.,"He was so kind, so in earnest, poor fellow!  I wrung his hand, and said,"
4376,III.,"""Thank you again and again.  You are a true friend, and Laurie knows it."
4377,III.,"But if you won't think me obstinate, I would rather go on; Laurie may"
4378,III.,"be very ill, very wretched; and the wild people about him may not know"
4379,III.,"how to treat him.  You would hardly know, perhaps, for you can't be used"
4380,III.,"to sick-room ways, and Laurie's ways in particular.  From what you say,"
4381,III.,"the risk is small, almost nothing; and I was brought up at the foot of"
4382,III.,"Skiddaw, and can climb like a cat, so I should not delay you; and--"""
4383,III.,
4384,III.,"""Enough!"" he said, resuming his offhand manner.  ""Such an array of"
4385,III.,"reasons cannot be gainsaid; and, indeed, I shouldn't feel comfortable in"
4386,III.,"leaving you down here with no champion but little Spira, so let us be"
4387,III.,"off at once.  Head the van, you see, by crossing this Slough of Despond"
4388,III.,"on friend Basil's back!"""
4389,III.,
4390,III.,"Danger always sharpens my sense of the ridiculous, and the sight of"
4391,III.,"Basil steadying himself with a pole, and striding through the mire with"
4392,III.,"the long-legged Englishman on his back, fairly upset my gravity.  He"
4393,III.,"soon landed him, and came back for me; lifting me on one arm, and"
4394,III.,carrying me as easily and tenderly as if I had been little Nilo.
4395,III.,
4396,III.,"Well! we scrambled up the pathless steep, through oaks and ashes of"
4397,III.,mushroom growth to a height of perhaps two hundred feet.  It was
4398,III.,"troublesome climbing, for there was an undergrowth of brier and bramble"
4399,III.,"which tore my clothes, and the sharp crags which jutted in all"
4400,III.,"directions out of the ground cut my feet; nevertheless, I progressed"
4401,III.,"rapidly, outstripping Spira and Mr Popham, and keeping alongside of"
4402,III.,"Basil, who now and then stretched out a helping hand to me and nodded"
4403,III.,grim approval.
4404,III.,
4405,III.,"No one uttered a word, and a sign from Basil made us understand that we"
4406,III.,"were to keep in the shade, lest, perchance, some of the enemy might be"
4407,III.,"straggling in our direction.  I was growing tired and breathless, when"
4408,III.,our herculean guide signed to me to look upwards.  My eye following the
4409,III.,"lead of his finger, travelled across a curtain of foliage--the delicate"
4410,III.,"ash leaf, faded and ready to drop away; the sturdier oak, brown, yellow,"
4411,III.,"dull green, or blotted with crimson.  At the top of all was a hut"
4412,III.,"perched on the edge of the cliff; that was Laurie's hut, Basil"
4413,III.,"whispered.  I could see the wall, built of rough stones, and a miserable"
4414,III.,"little hole meant for a window, and a bright patch of red, probably a"
4415,III.,"""strucca,"" stuffed into it to keep out the cold.  At that sight I forgot"
4416,III.,"my fatigue, and Mr Popham grew excited, and waved his cap over his"
4417,III.,"head, crying, ""Hurrah!  Now go ahead, Mrs Englefield!"" for which piece"
4418,III.,"of boyish folly he received a frown from Basil, the darkest I ever saw"
4419,III.,on human face.
4420,III.,
4421,III.,We were brought here to a standstill by a smooth wall of rock about ten
4422,III.,"feet high.  In order to get round it, we had to crawl some yards to our"
4423,III.,"right, that is nearer to the scene of conflict.  There were voices,"
4424,III.,"trampling of feet, and the report of fire-arms, close by, as it seemed,"
4425,III.,"but really on the shoulder of the hill, a quarter of a mile off.  ""More"
4426,III.,"foes climbing the hill!""  Basil muttered; ""I know their tread.  Why do"
4427,III.,"not our men come down, and give them the meeting?  Ah, they _are_"
4428,III.,"coming! praise to Saint Basil!  I hear them--I see them;"" and he lifted"
4429,III.,"his head cautiously, and fixed his lynx eyes on a point where the"
4430,III.,"hillside met the pale blue sky.  ""They are pouring down--twenty, thirty"
4431,III.,"of them!  Not one would stay behind, I warrant!  Ah, why must I?"""
4432,III.,
4433,III.,"""Why must you, husband?"" responded Spira, but in a submissive tone."
4434,III.,"""Go, and trust me to guide our lady to her husband.  I will die sooner"
4435,III.,"than any harm should befall her."""
4436,III.,
4437,III.,"It was a tempting offer, but the noble fellow resisted it.  ""Go to,"" he"
4438,III.,"said, still in the same low voice.  ""What! leave our Nilo's preserver to"
4439,III.,"the care of a woman, and of a prating boy that knows not how to take"
4440,III.,"care of himself?  Peace, woman! not another word!"""
4441,III.,
4442,III.,"We climbed the rock at the first practicable place, Basil mounting"
4443,III.,"first, and lowering one end of his ""strucca"" for me to hold by.  Mr"
4444,III.,"Popham followed, saying, playfully, in my ear, ""Ticklish work, ain't it;"
4445,III.,"this holding on by one's nails and eyebrows?"""
4446,III.,
4447,III.,"Poor, poor John! yet why should I say so?  No doubt, Providence ordered"
4448,III.,"all that should befall him, and ordered it in mercy.  He was of too"
4449,III.,"yielding a nature, perhaps, to fight the battle of life, yet too"
4450,III.,"tender-hearted and right-minded to err without anguish of spirit.  Yes,"
4451,III.,"I see now, and Laurie sees, that all was ordered for the best!  But to"
4452,III.,proceed.
4453,III.,
4454,III.,"We now crept towards the left, on a narrow ledge surmounted by a natural"
4455,III.,"wall, similar to that we had scaled.  This wall and the shelf beneath"
4456,III.,"it, jutted out at one point so as to conceal all beyond it; when Basil"
4457,III.,"reached the spot, he looked stealthily round the angle of the rock, drew"
4458,III.,"back sharply, shouldered his gun, and signed to Mr Popham to do the"
4459,III.,"same.  At that instant, two shots were fired by the unseen foes, but"
4460,III.,"fell harmless.  Basil advanced, partially screened by the rock, took aim"
4461,III.,and fired; then I heard branches crashing.  Certainly the enemy had been
4462,III.,"struck or fled; but there were more behind,--three, four, turbaned Turks"
4463,III.,"pressing round the corner!  Basil, seeing them, flung down his gun and"
4464,III.,threw himself upon the foremost.  The Turk seemed not much behind him in
4465,III.,"strength, and for several terrible minutes they wrestled together, John"
4466,III.,"Popham's threatening attitude as he stood ready to fire, keeping the"
4467,III.,"others at bay.  The struggle ended by Basil's enemy slipping his foot,"
4468,III.,and being flung down the steep.  I know not whether he was badly hurt or
4469,III.,"not, but he gave us no more trouble, vanishing amid the brushwood with"
4470,III.,magic speed.  His three comrades now showed some disposition to do the
4471,III.,"same, but Basil would not let them; he snatched, with a fierce smile,"
4472,III.,"the gun I had reloaded (yes, I _could_ load a gun, your uncle had taught"
4473,III.,"me to do that early in our married life), and fired it at the foremost"
4474,III.,"man, but to my infinite relief, with no deadly effect.  The poor fellow,"
4475,III.,"though slightly wounded, summoned strength to dash over the precipice"
4476,III.,"and make his escape.  The third followed unhurt; only one remained, an"
4477,III.,"elderly wrinkled man, who, it seemed, knew something of Christian and"
4478,III.,"civilised usages; he threw down his gun, cast himself at John Popham's"
4479,III.,"feet, and in an abject, yet piteous tone, exclaimed, ""Quarter, quarter,"
4480,III.,"noble sir; you are no Montenegrin to slay a helpless old man."""
4481,III.,
4482,III.,"Poor John could not make out a word of this appeal, but the cry for"
4483,III.,"mercy could not be mistaken, and it found an instant response in his"
4484,III.,"gentle heart.  He gave the suppliant a re-assuring nod, and signed to"
4485,III.,"the astounded Basil that he would not permit him to be touched.  Alas,"
4486,III.,what availed his kind intentions?  I have been told there is no instance
4487,III.,"on record of a Black Mountaineer giving quarter to a Mussulman, to such"
4488,III.,lengths have ages of oppression goaded a generous people!  Seeing the
4489,III.,"deadly fire in Basil's eye, I flew to him and plied him with prayers and"
4490,III.,angry expostulations.  All in vain; he beckoned Spira to lead me away as
4491,III.,"one should give over a petted but troublesome child to its nurse, and"
4492,III.,"deliberately put a pistol to the old man's head.  ""Now, if this is not"
4493,III.,"butchery, I don't know what is!""  I heard John exclaim; and without a"
4494,III.,"moment's hesitation, he snatched at the pistol and tried to wrest it"
4495,III.,"from Basil's grasp.  I could not see exactly what passed, but there was"
4496,III.,"a moment's struggle, then a report, and the ball lodged in John's"
4497,III.,"breast.  Oh, the agony of that moment! words cannot paint, nor thought"
4498,III.,"realise it!  With a loud cry, Basil rushed forward to support Mr"
4499,III.,"Popham, but I bade him stand back, and he at once obeyed.  I contrived"
4500,III.,"to catch poor John as he fell, and laying his head on my left arm tried"
4501,III.,my utmost with the other hand to stanch the blood that flowed from the
4502,III.,"wound.  It was right to try, but I knew all the while it was perfectly"
4503,III.,"useless.  He sighed once or twice, then opened his large blue eyes, and"
4504,III.,"looked fixedly on me; oh, with such a beautiful soft expression.  I am"
4505,III.,"sure he felt no pain, he seemed perfectly easy in body and mind; it was"
4506,III.,"a comfort even then, to be sure of this.  ""It's no use, Mrs"
4507,III.,"Englefield,"" he murmured, bringing out each word very slowly; ""No use,"
4508,III.,thank you; I'm going--best I should go--I should have done no credit to
4509,III.,"the house--tell Laurie, with my love--now farewell--God bless you--and"
4510,III.,"me too--and I think He will.""  His head dropped on my arm at that last"
4511,III.,"word, and he added no more; I believe the angels were coming for him"
4512,III.,then.
4513,III.,
4514,III.,"Don't cry, my dear children; perhaps had John lived to grow grey, there"
4515,III.,might have been greater and truer cause to weep for him.
4516,III.,
4517,III.,"I did not speak or move for some time, for life seemed still flickering"
4518,III.,"about the parted lips.  At length the stillness could not be mistaken,"
4519,III.,"and I laid his head softly on a mossy stone, and closed his eyes; then I"
4520,III.,"looked round and saw Basil leaning against the rock, watching me with an"
4521,III.,"expression of sullen misery in his face.  My heart smote me, for after"
4522,III.,"all he had never intended to hurt John, and it had been partly the poor"
4523,III.,fellow's reckless way of snatching his weapon that had caused this
4524,III.,"calamity; still, I felt too much revolted by the cold-blooded attempt on"
4525,III.,"the Turk's life, to speak to him with calmness, so we remained aloof and"
4526,III.,silent.
4527,III.,
4528,III.,"A great stir now arose on the hillside, and I saw a large party of the"
4529,III.,mountaineers returning from their raid against the Turks with every mark
4530,III.,"of triumph.  Presently, a number of them turned in our direction.  Many"
4531,III.,"glittering dark eyes rested on our mournful group with curiosity,"
4532,III.,"wonder, or pity.  I felt abashed at first, and was considering how I"
4533,III.,could enlist their help in carrying the body to a place of shelter near
4534,III.,"Laurie's hut, when I saw the crowd open.  To my great joy, an officer in"
4535,III.,"European dress came forward, exclaiming ""Is it possible? you, Mrs"
4536,III.,"Englefield, here?"" then, seeing my bloodstained hands and cloak, he"
4537,III.,"added, ""and hurt, I fear?"" and he was at my side in a moment.  With"
4538,III.,"unspeakable comfort, I recognised Captain Blundel, an Englishman, in the"
4539,III.,"Austrian engineer service, who had dined with us several times at"
4540,III.,"Cattaro.  My husband liked him particularly, and their acquaintance"
4541,III.,"seemed in the way to become a friendship, when Captain Blundel had been"
4542,III.,ordered up the country in order to survey some part of it for a
4543,III.,government map.  I soon relieved his mind of the fear that I was
4544,III.,"wounded, and told my story in the fewest words possible.  Oh, the relief"
4545,III.,of having a strong mind to lean upon once more!  Not till then did I
4546,III.,know how utterly exhausted I was.  Captain Blundel seemed quite at home
4547,III.,"with the mountaineers, selected some to carry the body up the hill, sent"
4548,III.,"a couple to guard the door of Mr Englefield's hut, lest the tidings"
4549,III.,"should be carried to him hastily, and, lastly, to my great delight, took"
4550,III.,measures to procure surgical help for him as quickly as possible.
4551,III.,
4552,III.,"""That is a blessing I dared not hope for,"" I exclaimed; ""they told me"
4553,III.,"there was no surgeon to be found in Montenegro."""
4554,III.,
4555,III.,"""And they told you right;"" he answered, ""but happily at this moment, it"
4556,III.,"is otherwise.  The Prince-bishop, who was brought up, you know, in"
4557,III.,"Russia, has a clever medical man from Saint Petersburgh on a visit to"
4558,III.,"him just now; his highness is about to pass this way, on his march from"
4559,III.,"the Lake of Scutari back to Cetigna; he knows me well, and is besides"
4560,III.,too kind-hearted not readily to lend us Dr Goloff's services for a
4561,III.,"short time."""
4562,III.,
4563,III.,"We walked slowly up the hill, Captain Blundel and myself keeping near"
4564,III.,the party that bore poor John's body.  The other mountaineers hurried
4565,III.,forward with such shouts of glee and exultation that I could not help
4566,III.,"asking what it all meant.  ""It means,"" replied my companion, ""that the"
4567,III.,"gallant fellows have made a successful raid over the Turkish border, and"
4568,III.,"surprised an underling of the Pasha of Scutari, laden with money and"
4569,III.,jewels of his master's and his own.  I was surveying near the spot where
4570,III.,"he was captured.  I never saw a fellow so terrified, and not without"
4571,III.,"reason, for they would have beheaded him there and then, had he not"
4572,III.,declared himself a British subject and no Turk; they carried him to
4573,III.,"their Prince, in whose custody he remains."""
4574,III.,
4575,III.,"It flashed at once across my mind that this description agreed, in many"
4576,III.,"points, with that of Orlando Jones.  I determined, without delay, to"
4577,III.,"hint these suspicions to Captain Blundel, and gave him, in the strictest"
4578,III.,"confidence, an outline of that villain's history.  He listened gravely,"
4579,III.,"asked several questions much to the point, and ended by begging me to"
4580,III.,trust the matter in his hands.
4581,III.,
4582,III.,"We were now at our journey's end, and I begged for some water, and"
4583,III.,"hastily washed my bloodstained hands and cloak, lest they should"
4584,III.,"frighten your uncle.  Captain Blundel, meanwhile, saw the body laid in a"
4585,III.,"sheltered place, and appointed two mountaineers to watch by it.  But"
4586,III.,"Basil, he afterwards told me, now came forward, and insisted on that"
4587,III.,"duty being left to him; he would take no refusal, and more than once,"
4588,III.,"when Captain Blundel looked in, he found him on his knees at the head of"
4589,III.,"the rude bier, praying devoutly.  ""No people,"" added Captain Blundel,"
4590,III.,"""make longer prayers than the Black Mountaineers, nor, I believe, more"
4591,III.,"devout ones."""
4592,III.,
4593,III.,I entered alone the hovel where my husband lay; what a place it was!
4594,III.,"The floor was unpaved, and positively alive with mice and fleas; the"
4595,III.,"walls were of stones loosely heaped together, and little bright flecks"
4596,III.,of light peeped through the crevices.  Wood smoke curled up from the
4597,III.,hearth and so dimmed the air that I could not at once distinguish the
4598,III.,"dear object of my search.  Two women were there, kind though rough"
4599,III.,"nurses; one was baking cakes on the hearth for him, the other was"
4600,III.,holding to his lips a cup of sour milk.  He was propped up against a
4601,III.,"pile of blankets, and his features looked wan and sunk.  He caught sight"
4602,III.,"of me at once, and snatched me to his breast with a vehemence so unlike"
4603,III.,his calm self that it almost startled me.  So did his rapid utterance
4604,III.,"and feverish rather unconnected questions, ending with, ""Where's John?"
4605,III.,"isn't he with you?"""
4606,III.,
4607,III.,"""No,"" I tremblingly answered, neither daring to tell the truth nor to"
4608,III.,withhold it from him in his critical state.
4609,III.,
4610,III.,"""Then, my dear, where is he?"" he rejoined quickly."
4611,III.,
4612,III.,"""He is--he has been called home,"" I said, not knowing what else to say."
4613,III.,
4614,III.,"""Very extraordinary,"" I heard him mutter, as he sank back on his pallet,"
4615,III.,"""but they were right; John has no head for business; when did he go"
4616,III.,"home, my dear?"""
4617,III.,
4618,III.,I could not help bursting into tears at this reiterated inquiry; your
4619,III.,"uncle raised himself on his elbow and gazed in my face, and as he did"
4620,III.,"so, a sudden light seemed to break in upon him.  I knew suspense would"
4621,III.,"be torture, and added, ""Yes, dear Laurie, he was called home this"
4622,III.,"morning; his death was by a pistol-shot, purely accidental,--no pain, no"
4623,III.,"distress, conscious to the last, and quite satisfied to go; he desired"
4624,III.,"me to give you his love, Laurie; now you know the truth, and you shall"
4625,III.,"hear every particular as soon as you are strong enough to bear it."""
4626,III.,
4627,III.,"Your uncle heard these tidings in perfect silence; he was calm, but too"
4628,III.,"deeply heart-stricken to speak; next to me, I think he loved John better"
4629,III.,"than any one in the world; often, very often, when I go into his"
4630,III.,"dressing-room, I find him gazing on the sketch of him in crayons, that"
4631,III.,"hangs over his chimney-piece.  I will show it you when, you come to stay"
4632,III.,with us.
4633,III.,
4634,III.,It was a sense of thankfulness for my preservation from danger that made
4635,III.,your uncle bear up as he did.  When I came to examine his wound I was
4636,III.,shocked at the state it was in.  A sword-cut extended from the neck over
4637,III.,"the shoulder to the arm, not only unhealed, but to the highest degree"
4638,III.,"inflamed.  No wonder his whole frame was fevered, for the suffering must"
4639,III.,have been severe indeed.  The kind but rough treatment of his highland
4640,III.,nurses was not calculated to promote a speedy cure; the food they
4641,III.,brought him was not such as a sick man could eat; nor could they
4642,III.,understand his English prejudice in favour of cleanliness.  With great
4643,III.,difficulty (he afterwards told me) he had the night of his arrival
4644,III.,"obtained a poultice, the application of which had given him such relief"
4645,III.,"that he had dropped asleep.  Presently, however, he was wakened by two"
4646,III.,or more rats tugging at it with all their might.  He had tried to drive
4647,III.,"the intruders away, but was fairly obliged to give in, and fling the"
4648,III.,poultice to the farthest corner of the room.
4649,III.,
4650,III.,I was bathing the shoulder with warm water when a stranger in the
4651,III.,"uniform of a Russian colonel appeared, and introduced himself as Dr"
4652,III.,"Goloff.  He went to business at once, inspected the wound, felt the"
4653,III.,"pulse, then said there was no chance of his patient's improving until he"
4654,III.,was removed from that unwholesome place.  The irritative fever which
4655,III.,"accompanies such a wound had been much aggravated, he said, by bad air"
4656,III.,"and improper dressings.  He was commissioned, he added, by his friend"
4657,III.,Captain Blundel to see Mr Englefield removed at once to Captain
4658,III.,"Blundel's tent, which was pitched for surveying purposes near the foot"
4659,III.,of this hill.  No sooner said than done.  A kind of litter was
4660,III.,"constructed, and your uncle placed upon it.  We were about to set out"
4661,III.,"when I saw Basil eyeing us from afar, sadly and gloomily.  The"
4662,III.,remembrance of a shade of injustice towards him came across me
4663,III.,"painfully, so I went to him and asked him to be one of Laurie's bearers;"
4664,III.,poor Basil! he sprang to execute my bidding with a look of impassioned
4665,III.,gratitude that was most touching.  With his powerful help the short
4666,III.,"journey was soon accomplished, and the litter safely set down in the"
4667,III.,"large, watertight, and cheerful tent."
4668,III.,
4669,III.,A painful process was needed in order to bring the wound into a right
4670,III.,"state for healing, and when it was over, Dr Goloff administered to your"
4671,III.,"uncle a composing draught, adding, cheerily, ""You, monsieur, will do"
4672,III.,"well to sleep, while I give madame instructions for your future"
4673,III.,"treatment.""  He then drew me aside, and after relieving my mind by"
4674,III.,giving a favourable opinion of the case added a strong caution against
4675,III.,"suffering Laurie's mind to dwell on painful subjects.  By so doing, he"
4676,III.,"said, not only would the patient's recovery be rendered tedious, but his"
4677,III.,nerves might be shaken for life.  He could see that some anxiety weighed
4678,III.,heavily on his mind; it should at all costs be removed.
4679,III.,
4680,III.,"""It should indeed, but how?"" thought I, with a despairing sigh."
4681,III.,
4682,III.,The sorrowful question was about to be answered through the mercy of
4683,III.,that good Providence which helps even the faithless and undeserving.  I
4684,III.,was musing dolefully at the tent door when a large party appeared in the
4685,III.,"distance, and one of them spurred forward, and came up to me at full"
4686,III.,"gallop.  It was Captain Blundel.  He dismounted, and with a beaming face"
4687,III.,"said--""Good news, Mrs Englefield; I think I have brought your patient a"
4688,III.,tonic more effectual than even Dr Goloff could prescribe.  When I left
4689,III.,"you an hour and a half ago, I went to the Prince-Bishop, and imparted to"
4690,III.,"him our suspicions as to the true name and history of his prisoner,"
4691,III.,begging his permission to sift the matter.  With his usual gentlemanlike
4692,III.,feeling he at once granted it.  I then hastened to the hut where the
4693,III.,"prisoner lay guarded by unfriendly Montenegrins.  Without preamble, I"
4694,III.,"said, `I have the honour of speaking to Mr Orlando Jones, I believe?'"
4695,III.,"`Who told you my name, sir?' he exclaimed, starting to his feet in great"
4696,III.,"alarm: then, perceiving the mistake he had made in thus proving his own"
4697,III.,"identity, he tried to retract, but stammered and broke down.  I"
4698,III.,"proceeded quietly to demand the restoration of the papers and jewels,"
4699,III.,fraudulently carried off by him from Mr Popham's office at Ragusa.  He
4700,III.,"tried to shuffle off the charge.  `Very well,' said I, `do as you"
4701,III.,"please, but mark me, I am empowered by his highness to say that only by"
4702,III.,full restitution can you hope for a continuance of his protection; if
4703,III.,"that is withdrawn, your life is scarcely worth a pin's purchase.'  The"
4704,III.,"poor wretch turned pale and shook in every joint.  Feeling, doubtless,"
4705,III.,"the truth of this last remark he surrendered at discretion, entreating"
4706,III.,"me to stand his friend, and confessing the whole extent of his frauds."
4707,III.,"His property, he said, was all in the hands of his captors, but it was"
4708,III.,possible they might not have discovered the jewels as they were
4709,III.,"cunningly secreted within his saddle.  To be brief, I got the Vladika's"
4710,III.,"leave to examine the saddle, and found within it this packet, which I"
4711,III.,"have every reason to believe is the object of your husband's search."""
4712,III.,
4713,III.,Tremblingly I carried the precious packet to your dear uncle.  Never
4714,III.,"shall I forget his look of relief on opening it, and finding the lost"
4715,III.,"jewels safe.  Some important papers were also there--everything, in"
4716,III.,"fact, that was missing; for the most valuable documents of all, Laurie"
4717,III.,had had the precaution to transfer to his office at Cattaro when his
4718,III.,suspicions of Jones had ripened into certainty.
4719,III.,
4720,III.,"After warmly thanking Captain Blundel for his invaluable help, your"
4721,III.,"uncle said, ""Let me ask of you, my dear friend, two more proofs of"
4722,III.,"kindness.  In the first place, will you undertake the safe transport of"
4723,III.,"this precious packet to Cattaro, whither you say you are shortly to"
4724,III.,"return; in the next, will you convey the expressions of my sincere"
4725,III.,"gratitude to the Prince-Bishop in the fittest terms?"""
4726,III.,
4727,III.,"""Your first request is easily granted,"" replied Captain Blundel; ""your"
4728,III.,"last it would be superfluous in me to undertake, as the Vladika has"
4729,III.,"expressed his intention of inquiring after you in person, and here he"
4730,III.,"comes."""
4731,III.,
4732,III.,"I turned and saw Basil, holding up the tent curtain while his highness"
4733,III.,entered.  The prince did indeed appear a Saul amongst his people.
4734,III.,"Taller than the tallest Black Highlander from the shoulders upwards, his"
4735,III.,"figure was finely modelled, his movements were free and active, his eyes"
4736,III.,"dark and brilliant.  Nothing about him except his long beard, which was"
4737,III.,"black and glossy, reminded one of his sacred office; he wore a scarlet"
4738,III.,"pelisse, fur cap, blue wide trousers, and in his belt a pair of plain"
4739,III.,"pistols.  He advanced towards Laurie's bed, replying with peculiar grace"
4740,III.,"to my silent courtesy, then in a voice of almost languid gentleness"
4741,III.,inquiring of me after my husband's wound.  He spoke in French.  I took
4742,III.,"courage to reply in the same language, offering our heartfelt thanks for"
4743,III.,"his intervention in our favour, and for Dr Goloff's timely aid.  Laurie"
4744,III.,"raised himself on one arm and joined in these acknowledgments, but the"
4745,III.,Vladika kindly bade him lie down.  He remained but a few minutes with
4746,III.,"us, being in haste to resume his journey, and at his departure he"
4747,III.,frankly and cordially invited us to return his visit at Cetigna.  Basil
4748,III.,"attended him back to his charger, then returned full of pride and"
4749,III.,delight to congratulate us on this honour.
4750,III.,
4751,III.,"We saw the kind and noble Prince-Prelate no more, as a Turkish invasion"
4752,III.,of his northern frontier hurried him away from his little capital before
4753,III.,Laurie was well enough to be moved there.  We remained ten days under
4754,III.,"Captain Blundel's canvas roof, he most kindly undertaking to superintend"
4755,III.,"the removal of poor John's body to Cattaro, and its respectful interment"
4756,III.,there.  Meanwhile Basil was my unwearied helper in the task of nursing
4757,III.,"Laurie--a happy task, as the beloved invalid gained strength each day."
4758,III.,"The faithful fellow escorted us to cetigna, then flow back to his"
4759,III.,"prince's side for some weeks, but managed to return to Cetigna in time"
4760,III.,to be our guide to Cattaro.  How thankful I felt when I saw your dear
4761,III.,"uncle once more installed in his home! and to complete my satisfaction,"
4762,III.,"his dear and early friend, Francis Popham, joined us there almost"
4763,III.,"immediately, having left England on receiving from Captain Blundel the"
4764,III.,"mournful tidings of his brother's death.  Under his able management,"
4765,III.,affairs were soon restored to perfect order.  I scarcely need to tell
4766,III.,_you_ how it has pleased Heaven to prosper your uncle's and his joint
4767,III.,"exertions since that time, and how a few months ago your uncle became a"
4768,III.,partner in that house and we returned to live in dear old England.
4769,III.,
4770,III.,"Basil and Spira are still alive.  ""Little Nilo"" is grown a noble-looking"
4771,III.,"youth as gallant as his father, and far better taught, having received a"
4772,III.,good education in one of the excellent schools founded by our friend
4773,III.,Bishop Danilo.
4774,III.,
4775,III.,"Thus ends our adventure on the Black Mountain; so now to bed, all of"
4776,III.,"you, and I wish you a good night and happy dreams."

4814,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",little damage in return.  An officer and two or three men sprang into
4815,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","the ""Marlborough's"" mizen rigging to secure the bowsprit to it.  The"
4816,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","French small-arm men rushed forward to prevent this being done, by"

4821,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",was watching the proceeding.  Seizing a rope he sprang into the ringing

4885,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","Pearce Ripley was a fine-looking lad of about fourteen, with an"
4886,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","ingenuous countenance and frank manner, which spoke of an honest, brave"
4887,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",heart.  With the ship's company he had been a general favourite; it was
4888,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",to be proved how far he would recommend himself to the officers.
4889,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",
4890,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","In the afternoon the young gentlemen, as all the members of the"
4891,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","midshipmen's mess were called, were summoned on the quarterdeck, and"
4892,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","briefly addressed by Mr Monckton, the first lieutenant.  Pearce Ripley"
4893,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","was then sent for, and the boatswain's son had no cause to complain of"
4894,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","his reception by those whose messmate he was about to become.  They,"
4895,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","with one exception, came forward and cordially shook him by the hand,"
4896,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",and when he entered the berth they all seemed to vie who should pay him
4897,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",the most unobtrusive attention as forthwith to place him at his ease.
4898,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",So surely will true bravery and worth be rightly esteemed by the
4899,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",generous-hearted officers of the British Navy.  Pearce had gained the
4900,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",respect of his messmates; he soon won their regard by his readiness to
4901,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","oblige, his good temper, his evident determination not to give or take"
4902,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","offence, and his general kind bearing towards all.  On duty he showed"
4903,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",that he was resolved to merit the good opinion which had been formed of
4904,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","him.  The only person who differed from the majority was Harry Verner, a"
4905,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",midshipman of about his own age.  Though Verner had shaken hands with
4906,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","him, it had been with reluctance and marked coldness.  His manner was"
4907,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","now haughty and supercilious in the extreme, and he took every"
4908,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",opportunity of making sneering remarks about men who had risen from the
4909,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","lower orders always being out of place and never doing any good.  ""If"
4910,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","such were to become customary in the service, it would drive all the"
4911,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","gentlemen out of it,"" he remarked one day in Pearce's hearing.  ""Not if"
4912,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","those who entered it knew how to behave as gentlemen,"" Pearce replied,"
4913,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","quietly.  Verner said nothing in return, but he gave a look to show his"
4914,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",intense displeasure.  Generally Pearce walked away when Verner spoke in
4915,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","that style, or when at table, and he could not move, pretended not to"
4916,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",hear what was said.
4917,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",
4918,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",The fleet reached Portsmouth.  Great was the satisfaction of the British
4919,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",nation at the victory won.  The good King George the Third and the kind
4920,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",Queen Charlotte went on board all the ships and visited the wounded;
4921,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","honours were awarded to the chiefs, and those officers who had"
4922,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",especially distinguished themselves were presented to their Sovereigns.
4923,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","Among others was Pearce Ripley, as the midshipman who had helped to take"
4924,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","the ""Impetueux.""  The ""Marlborough's"" crew declared on this that he was"
4925,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",a marked man and must get on in the service.  The remark greatly excited
4926,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","Harry Verner's indignation and wrath.  ""It is high time for me to quit"
4927,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","the service after this,"" he remarked, when the King patted Pearce on the"
4928,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","head, but did not even glance towards him.  Of memorable days in English"
4929,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.","history, the 1st of June, 1794, stands justly prominent."
4930,"THE BOATSWAIN'S SON: A TALE OF THE SEA, BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON.",
4931,II.,II.
4932,II.,
4933,II.,"The ""Marlborough,"" though victorious, had received so tremendous a"
4934,II.,"battering from her numerous opponents, that it was very clear the stout"
4935,II.,craft could not again go to sea without a thorough repair.  Her officers
4936,II.,"and crew were therefore distributed among other ships then fitting out,"
4937,II.,"and thus Pearce, for the first time in his life, was separated from his"
4938,II.,"father, to whom he had always been accustomed to look up for guidance"
4939,II.,and advice.  In some respects this might have been an advantage to the
4940,II.,"young midshipman, but the parting cost both more pains than either"
4941,II.,"confessed.  ""I am no great preacher, my boy, but remember there's One"
4942,II.,"ever watching over you, and He'll be true to you if you try honestly to"
4943,II.,"be true to Him,"" said the boatswain, as he wrung his son's hand, and"
4944,II.,stepped down the side of the fine frigate to which Pearce through the
4945,II.,interest of his late captain had been appointed.  The crew went tramping
4946,II.,"round the capstan to the sound of the merry fife, the anchor was away,"
4947,II.,"and under a wide spread of snowy canvas the dashing ""Blanche"" of"
4948,II.,"thirty-two guns, commanded by the gallant Captain Faulkner, stood"
4949,II.,"through the Needle passage between the Isle of Wight and the main, on"
4950,II.,"her way down channel, bound out to the West Indies.  It was a station"
4951,II.,"where hurricanes, yellow fever, and sicknesses, and dangers of all sorts"
4952,II.,"were to be encountered, but it was also one where enemies were to be met"
4953,II.,"with, battles to be fought, prizes to be captured, and prize-money to be"
4954,II.,"made, glory, honour, and promotion to be obtained, and who on board for"
4955,II.,a moment balanced one against the other?
4956,II.,
4957,II.,"Several of Pearce's old shipmates were on board the ""Blanche,"" and two"
4958,II.,"of his messmates, from one of whom, Harry Verner, he would rather have"
4959,II.,"been separated; the other, David Bonham, he was very glad to see."
4960,II.,"Between Bonham and Verner the contrast was very great; for the former,"
4961,II.,"though of excellent family, was the most unpretending fellow possible,"
4962,II.,"free from pride, vanity, and selfishness, and kind-hearted, generous,"
4963,II.,"good-tempered, and the merriest of the merry.  The first A.B. who"
4964,II.,"volunteered for the ""Blanche,"" when he knew Mr Pearce had been"
4965,II.,"appointed to her, was Dick Rogers, an old friend of his father's, with"
4966,II.,whom he had served man and boy the best part of his life; and if there
4967,II.,"was one thing more strongly impressed on Dick's mind than another, it"
4968,II.,"was that John Ripley, the boatswain, ought to have been a post-captain."
4969,II.,"For his father's sake Dick had at first loved Pearce, and now loved him"
4970,II.,"for his own.  ""Though his father isn't what he should be, he shall be,"
4971,II.,"that he shall, or it won't be my fault,"" he said to himself.  Dick was"
4972,II.,"no scholar, and had not many ideas beyond those connected with his"
4973,II.,"profession, except that particular one in favour of Pearce which might"
4974,II.,"or might not be of any service to him, and yet let us never despise a"
4975,II.,"friend, however humble.  Pearce did not, though he possibly had not read"
4976,II.,the fable of the lion and the mouse.
4977,II.,
4978,II.,"Dick Rogers was short and broad in the shoulders, though not fat, with a"
4979,II.,"huge, sandy beard, a clear blue eye, and an honest smile on his lips,"
4980,II.,"and saying that he was a seaman every inch of him, he needs no further"
4981,II.,"description.  Verner let it be known, among their new messmates, that"
4982,II.,"Pearce Ripley was only the boatswain's son; and hearing this, Bonham"
4983,II.,"took great care to recount to them his gallant act on the 1st of June,"
4984,II.,and to speak otherwise in his praise.  Dick forward did not fail to make
4985,II.,"the young midshipman his theme, and there the fact of his parentage was"
4986,II.,"undoubtedly in his favour.  ""We shall be, no doubt, alongside an enemy"
4987,II.,"some day soon, and then will be seen what stuff the youngsters are made"
4988,II.,"of,"" was the remark of several on board.  They were not wrong in their"
4989,II.,"prognostications.  The Island of Desiderade, near Guadeloupe, was in"
4990,II.,"sight to windward.  ""A sail on the weather bow!"" was shouted by the"
4991,II.,"look-out at the mast's head, always the keenest sighted of the seamen on"
4992,II.,board in those days.
4993,II.,
4994,II.,"The frigate made all sail in pursuit of the stranger, a large schooner"
4995,II.,"under French colours.  The chase stood into a bay defended by a fort,"
4996,II.,where she was seen to anchor with springs to her cables.  Along the
4997,II.,shore a body of troops were also observed to be posted.  The drum beat
4998,II.,"to quarters as the ""Blanche"" worked up towards the fort, when, the water"
4999,II.,"shoaling, she anchored and opened her fire in return for that which the"
5000,II.,"fort, the schooner, and the soldiers were pouring in on her.  Captain"
5001,II.,Faulkner's first object was to silence the fort.  This was soon done.
5002,II.,"The schooner, which it was clear was heavily armed, must be brought out."
5003,II.,"The boats were called away, under command of the second lieutenant."
5004,II.,"Pearce leaped into the one to which he belonged.  A master's mate,"
5005,II.,"Fitzgibbon, had charge of her, and Dick Rogers formed one of her crew."
5006,II.,"Harry Verner was in another.  Away the boats dashed, at a rate boats"
5007,II.,always do move pulled by British seamen when a prize is to be taken.
5008,II.,The Frenchmen worked their guns bravely.  A shot disabled the leading
5009,II.,"boat.  Pearce, sitting by Fitzgibbon's side, heard a deep groan, and"
5010,II.,"before he could even look up the master's mate fell forward, shot"
5011,II.,"through the head.  His boat took the lead.  ""Now's your time,"" cried"
5012,II.,"Dick Rogers; ""we'll be the first aboard, lads.""  The crew were not slack"
5013,II.,to follow the suggestion.  In another moment they were up to the
5014,II.,"schooner, and, leaping on her deck, led by Pearce, laid on them so"
5015,II.,"fiercely with their cutlasses that the Frenchmen, deserting their guns,"
5016,II.,sprang over the bulwarks into their boats on the other side nearest the
5017,II.,"shore, and, before another boat reached the vessel, pulled away towards"
5018,II.,where the troops were marching down to their support.  The cables were
5019,II.,"quickly cut, and amid a shower of ballets sail was made, and the prize"
5020,II.,"carried out.  ""I said as how he'd do it--I said he wouldn't be wanting,"""
5021,II.,"exclaimed Dick Rogers, as he gave his account of the cutting out"
5022,II.,"expedition to his chums on board.  ""He'll do more too come another"
5023,II.,"occasion.""  That occasion did occur before many days were over.  Two"
5024,II.,"days afterwards the ""Blanche"" was joined by the ""Quebec"" frigate, and"
5025,II.,"together, when sailing by Guadeloupe, they discovered the French"
5026,II.,"thirty-six-gun frigate ""Pique"" lying at anchor in the harbour of"
5027,II.,"Pointe-a-Pitre, ready for sea.  Not to deprive his brother captain of"
5028,II.,"the honour he might obtain by engaging an antagonist so worthy of him,"
5029,II.,"Captain Carpenter parted company, and the ""Quebec,"" steering westward,"
5030,II.,was soon out of sight.  The next thing to be done was to get the French
5031,II.,frigate to come out from under her protecting batteries to fight.  This
5032,II.,"seemed no easy matter, for prizes were captured and sent away under her"
5033,II.,"very nose, and still she did not venture forth.  At length, however, on"
5034,II.,"the memorable evening of the 4th of January, the ""Blanche,"" towing off"
5035,II.,"another prize in triumph, the ""Pique"" was seen to follow.  The sun went"
5036,II.,down.  It was the last many a brave man was destined to see.  Darkness
5037,II.,"had come on, when the French frigate was observed through the gloom"
5038,II.,"astern.  The ""Blanche"" tacked in chase."
5039,II.,
5040,II.,"In the solemn hour of midnight, while darkness covered the face of the"
5041,II.,"deep, the two vessels approached each other, their relative positions"
5042,II.,clearly distinguished by the light from the fighting-lanterns which
5043,II.,"streamed from their ports.  The British crew, mostly stripped to the"
5044,II.,"waist, stood at their quarters, grim and determined, with the"
5045,II.,"gun-tackles in hand, eager for the moment to open fire.  Pearce was on"
5046,II.,"the quarterdeck.  Young as he was, the whizzing of shots and the"
5047,II.,"whistling of bullets scarcely made his heart beat quicker than usual,"
5048,II.,"and yet, as in gloom and silence he waited for the signal when the"
5049,II.,"bloody strife must commence, he felt an awe creep over him he had never"
5050,II.,before experienced.  Nearer and nearer the combatants drew to each
5051,II.,"other.  The ""Pique"" commenced the fight.  The ""Blanche"" returned her"
5052,II.,"distant fire; and, after various manoeuvres, the two frigates ranged up"
5053,II.,"alongside each other and hotly engaged, broadside to broadside, in the"
5054,II.,fashion in which British tars have ever delighted.  Fiercely the two
5055,II.,"crews fought; the French, once having began, proved themselves no"
5056,II.,"unworthy antagonists.  The main and mizen-masts of the ""Blanche"" fell,"
5057,II.,"and the French, seizing the moment, ran alongside and attempted to"
5058,II.,board.  The British crew sprang up to repel them.  Among the foremost
5059,II.,"was Pearce, with Dick Rogers by his side.  With their sharp cutlasses"
5060,II.,they drove the Frenchmen back.  Again the guns roared as before.  Once
5061,II.,"more the French ship fell aboard the ""Blanche,"" her bowsprit touching"
5062,II.,"the latter's capstan.  Captain Faulkner hurried to secure it there, for"
5063,II.,"the ""Pique,"" thus held, was exposed to the raking fire of his frigate."
5064,II.,"Among those who flew to assist him were Pearce Ripley and Dick Rogers,"
5065,II.,"the Frenchman's musketry playing hotly on them.  ""This is something like"
5066,II.,"what you did in the old `Marlborough,' sir,"" said Dick to Pearce, so"
5067,II.,"loud that all might hear him--so many did, and noted the words.  Death"
5068,II.,was busy around them.  While he was passing the lashing the young and
5069,II.,gallant Captain Faulkner fell to the deck--a musket ball had pierced his
5070,II.,"heart.  That was no time for grieving, even for one well-beloved as the"
5071,II.,captain.  A hawser was being got up from below to secure the enemy's
5072,II.,"ship; but before it could be used she broke adrift, to the"
5073,II.,"disappointment of the British tars.  A cheer, however, burst from their"
5074,II.,"throats as, directly afterwards, the ""Blanche,"" paying off for want of"
5075,II.,"after-sail, the ""Pique,"" while attempting to cross her stern, fell once"
5076,II.,more aboard her.  This time they took good care to secure the bowsprit
5077,II.,"to the stump of their mainmast; and now, running before the wind, the"
5078,II.,"""Blanche"" towing her opponent, the fight was continued with greater fury"
5079,II.,than ever.  In vain the Frenchmen strove to free themselves by cutting
5080,II.,the lashings--each time they made the attempt the marines drove them
5081,II.,back with their musketry.  Still it seemed doubtful with whom victory
5082,II.,"would side.  The ""Blanche"" had no stern ports through which guns could"
5083,II.,be fought; the carpenters were unable to aid them.  A bold expedient was
5084,II.,proposed.  The guns must make ports for themselves through the transom.
5085,II.,Firemen with buckets were stationed ready to extinguish the fire which
5086,II.,the discharge would create.  With a thundering roar the guns sent their
5087,II.,"shot through the stem, and, the fire being extinguished, they began to"
5088,II.,play with terrific effect into the bows of the French frigate.  Her
5089,II.,foremast was immediately shot away; her mizen-mast was seen to fall.
5090,II.,"Still her crew, getting their quarter-dock guns trained aft, fought on;"
5091,II.,"but what were they to the ""Blanche's"" heavy guns, which mercilessly"
5092,II.,"raked her, the shot entering her bow and tearing up her deck fore and"
5093,II.,"aft, sweeping away numbers of her crew at each discharge.  ""If those"
5094,II.,"Mounseers are not made of iron, they'll not stand this battering much"
5095,II.,"longer,"" cried Dick Rogers, who was working one of the after-guns."
5096,II.,Pearce was standing near him.  The space between the decks was filled
5097,II.,"with smoke, through which the twinkling light of the lanterns could"
5098,II.,"scarcely penetrate, the flashes at each, discharge showing the men,"
5099,II.,"begrimed with powder, with sponge and rammers ready to load, or with"
5100,II.,their tackles to run in their guns.  A cheer from the deck told them
5101,II.,"that the Frenchman's remaining mast had fallen, and now another and"
5102,II.,"another that the foe had struck.  The ""Pique"" was totally dismasted; the"
5103,II.,"""Blanche"" had but her foremast standing.  Every boat was knocked to"
5104,II.,"pieces, and how to get on board the prize, still towed by the hawser,"
5105,II.,"was the question.  ""The hawser must form our bridge,"" cried Mr Milne,"
5106,II.,"the second lieutenant of the ship, springing on to it, followed by"
5107,II.,"Pearce, Rogers, and several men.  Their weight brought the rope down"
5108,II.,into the water.  For some distance they had to swim till they could
5109,II.,climb up by it on board.  What havoc and destruction a few short hours
5110,II.,"had wrought.  Of a crew not far short of three hundred men, one-third"
5111,II.,"lay dead or wounded, the deck covered with gore and the wrecks of the"
5112,II.,"masts and spars; guns lay dismounted, bulwarks knocked away, all telling"
5113,II.,the tale of the bravery and hardihood of both the combatants.  When the
5114,II.,sun arose there lay the victor and the conquered almost equally
5115,II.,helpless.  Such was one of the scenes through which young Ripley fought
5116,II.,"his way upwards, and gained a name and fame."
5117,II.,
5118,III.,III.
5119,III.,
5120,III.,The person who is constantly keeping his eye on the reward he aims at is
5121,III.,"very likely to stumble and fall, and never to reach it.  He, on the"
5122,III.,"contrary, who thinks only how he can best perform his duty will be"
5123,III.,"upheld and encouraged, and very probably obtain a higher reward than any"
5124,III.,at which he might have aspired.  Pearce Ripley found this to be true in
5125,III.,"his case.  Duty was his leading star.  It never occurred to him to say,"
5126,III.,"""Will this please my captain?""  ""Will this advance me in the service?"""
5127,III.,"The ""Blanche"" was soon refitted and at sea again.  Several prizes were"
5128,III.,"made, and, greatly to his satisfaction, he was appointed to the command"
5129,III.,"of one of them, with Bonham as his mate, and Dick Rogers as boatswain."
5130,III.,"She was a richly-laden West Indiaman, recaptured from the enemy.  He was"
5131,III.,"ordered to take her to England, where, on his arrival, he found his"
5132,III.,commission waiting for him.
5133,III.,
5134,III.,"Pearce received a right hearty welcome from his father, and intense was"
5135,III.,the satisfaction of the brave seaman when his son showed him his
5136,III.,"commission and appointment as second lieutenant to the ""Vestal,"" an"
5137,III.,"eighteen gun sloop of war, commanded by Captain Gale, and destined for"
5138,III.,the North American station.
5139,III.,
5140,III.,"""You have got your first step up the ratlins, Pearce.  Go on as you have"
5141,III.,"begun, and Heaven preserving your life, there is no reason why you"
5142,III.,"shouldn't reach the highest,"" said the proud father, as he once more"
5143,III.,parted from his son.
5144,III.,
5145,III.,"Those were days of pressgangs, and Dick Rogers took good care to hide"
5146,III.,"away till he ascertained the craft Pearce was to join, when he at once"
5147,III.,"volunteered for her.  Bonham, who had still a year to serve, was"
5148,III.,"appointed to the same ship.  The ""Vestal"" had a quick run across the"
5149,III.,"Atlantic till within about five days' sail of Halifax, Nova Scotia, when"
5150,III.,"a heavy gale sprang up, which tried to the utmost her seaworthy"
5151,III.,"qualities.  The sloop behaved beautifully, hove to, and rode buoyantly"
5152,III.,over the raging seas.  Well indeed was it for her that she was properly
5153,III.,"handled, for the gale went on increasing till the oldest seamen on board"
5154,III.,declared that they had never met with such another.  It continued for a
5155,III.,"week, each day the wind blowing harder and harder, or if there was a"
5156,III.,lull it seemed to come only that the gale might gain greater strength.
5157,III.,"For days not a glimpse of sun, or moon, or stars had been obtained.  It"
5158,III.,was the morning watch; the grey cold dawn had just broke.  Pearce was on
5159,III.,"deck, when sweeping his eye round the horizon as the sloop rose to the"
5160,III.,"summit of a sea he perceived on the lee beam the hull of a ship, rising"
5161,III.,and sinking amid the tumultuous waters.  At first he thought she was
5162,III.,"keel up, but as the light increased he saw that she was a large ship"
5163,III.,with the stump of the foremast alone remaining.  That she was in a bad
5164,III.,"plight was very clear.  She was remarkably low in the water he fancied,"
5165,III.,and who could say how long even she might keep afloat.
5166,III.,
5167,III.,"The captain, being summoned, soon came on deck.  To bear sway for the"
5168,III.,"stranger would be a work of danger to the ""Vestal.""  Still who could"
5169,III.,tell how many human beings might be on board that sinking ship!  With
5170,III.,"hatches battened down and men lashed to the helm, the captain resolved"
5171,III.,to go to the rescue.
5172,III.,
5173,III.,"The seas came roaring up with furious rage, as the sloop flew before"
5174,III.,"them, some breaking aboard; and rounding to under the stern of the ship,"
5175,III.,she again hove to.  Many people appeared on the deck of the stranger
5176,III.,"who, stretching out their arms, implored assistance.  How was it to be"
5177,III.,afforded?  Would a boat live in such a sea?  Such appeals to British
5178,III.,seamen are never made in vain.  Pearce Ripley offered to make the
5179,III.,experiment if men were found ready to go with him.  There was no want of
5180,III.,volunteers.  A boat was lowered.  It seemed as if she must be engulfed
5181,III.,before she left the sloop's side.  Ripley's progress was watched by
5182,III.,"eager eyes from both ships.  Now he is in the trough of the sea, a"
5183,III.,watery mountain about to overwhelm him; now he is on the summit
5184,III.,surrounded by driving foam.  A shout is raised as he neared the sinking
5185,III.,"ship, but to get alongside was even more dangerous than the passage from"
5186,III.,"one to the other.  As the ship rolled and her deck was exposed to view,"
5187,III.,"he saw that there were women on board, and other people besides the"
5188,III.,"crew.  Ropes were hove to him.  He seized one, and sprang up the side."
5189,III.,A few hurried words told him what had occurred.  The ship was conveying
5190,III.,"troops and stores to Halifax, the master and first mate had been washed"
5191,III.,"overboard, the second lay wounded by the falling of a spar.  Many of the"
5192,III.,crew had been lost with the captain.  There was no sea officer who could
5193,III.,enforce orders; the men were mutinous.  Ripley instantly assumed the
5194,III.,"command.  There were several ladies.  ""They must first be placed in"
5195,III.,"safety before a man enters the boat,"" he cried out, presenting a pistol"
5196,III.,at some seamen who showed an intention of leaping into her.
5197,III.,
5198,III.,"Some entreated that their husbands might accompany them.  ""Oh, father,"
5199,III.,"father, come with me,"" exclaimed a fair girl, who was being conveyed to"
5200,III.,"the side to be lowered into the boat; ""I cannot, I will not leave you."""
5201,III.,"She looked towards a fine, soldier-like man, who stood with several"
5202,III.,"officers around him.  ""Impossible!  Heaven protect you, dearest.  Even"
5203,III.,"for your sake I cannot desert my post.  It is here with my men,"" was the"
5204,III.,answer.  The boat had already nearly as many persons in her as it would
5205,III.,be safe to carry.  This was no time for delay.  Pearce lifted the young
5206,III.,"lady in his arms, and lowered himself with her into the boat.  The boat"
5207,III.,"returned to the ""Vestal,"" and all those who had been rescued were put on"
5208,III.,"board.  The young lady again and again entreated him to save her father,"
5209,III.,"Pearce promised to make every effort to bring off the colonel.  ""But"
5210,III.,"unless his men are rescued, I doubt that he will leave the ship,"" he"
5211,III.,"added, as he returned to his boat."
5212,III.,
5213,III.,"Two other boats were now lowered, but it was too evident that they could"
5214,III.,only save a part of the people from the foundering ship.  Those on her
5215,III.,deck were now seen forming a raft.  It was their last hope of life
5216,III.,should the boats not take them off.  Though several of the people made a
5217,III.,"rush to the side, they were driven back by the officers and soldiers who"
5218,III.,"remained firm, and the men were told off in order to allow of them to"
5219,III.,embark as arranged by Pearce.  Twice the boat returned without an
5220,III.,"accident to the ""Vestal.""  The young lady cast a reproachful look at"
5221,III.,"Ripley, when she saw that her father was not among the saved.  ""He would"
5222,III.,"not come, lady, but I will make another effort,"" he exclaimed, as he"
5223,III.,prepared once more to leave the corvette's side.  Just then arose the
5224,III.,"fearful cry, ""She is sinking! she is sinking!"""
5225,III.,
5226,III.,"""Oh, save him! save him!"" shrieked the poor girl in an agony of terror,"
5227,III.,stretching out her hands towards the spot where she fancied that she saw
5228,III.,her beloved father struggling in the waves.  Pearce and his brave
5229,III.,companions needed not such an appeal to make them use every effort to
5230,III.,reach their drowning fellow-creatures.  Some had leaped on the
5231,III.,"half-finished raft as the ship sunk beneath them, but many of these were"
5232,III.,"speedily washed off.  Others were clinging to spars, and oars, and"
5233,III.,"gratings, Pearce was soon in the midst of the hapless beings, many with"
5234,III.,"despair on their countenances, unable to reach the boat, sinking as he"
5235,III.,neared them.  He looked round for the colonel.  He could not distinguish
5236,III.,"him among the rest.  Three people had been hauled in, when as the boat"
5237,III.,rose to the summit of a sea he saw below him a person clinging to a
5238,III.,"grating.  A hand was waved towards him.  ""Give way, lads,"" he shouted,"
5239,III.,and in another minute he had the satisfaction of hauling on board the
5240,III.,brave officer for whom he was searching.
5241,III.,
5242,III.,The other boats took off the people from the raft.  He picked up several
5243,III.,"more, and returned in safety on board.  The meeting of the father and"
5244,III.,"his daughter need not be described.  They were, he found, a colonel and"
5245,III.,Miss Verner.  He was struck by the name as that of his former unamiable
5246,III.,"messmate.  When the weather moderated, and the colonel was sufficiently"
5247,III.,"recovered to appear on deck, he warmly expressed his gratitude to"
5248,III.,"Pearce, and his admiration of the gallantry he had displayed.  His"
5249,III.,"daughter Alice was not less grateful.  A calm succeeded the gale, and"
5250,III.,Pearce had frequent opportunities of seeing her.  He did not mention
5251,III.,"Harry Verner to her, and indeed so great was the contrast he perceived"
5252,III.,"between the two in manners and behaviour, that he could not suppose they"
5253,III.,were nearly related.  Still there was at times an expression in Colonel
5254,III.,Verner's countenance when he was annoyed which reminded him strongly of
5255,III.,Harry.
5256,III.,
5257,III.,There was a frank heartiness and sincerity about the young lieutenant
5258,III.,which at once gained Miss Verner's regard.  It was very different to
5259,III.,"what she had been accustomed, still his manner towards her was gentle"
5260,III.,"and deferential, as if he in no way presumed on the service he had"
5261,III.,"rendered her.  Indeed, it never entered his head that he had rendered"
5262,III.,"her any especial service, or that he had the slightest claim on her"
5263,III.,"regard.  He felt, as he wrote to his father, ""that he had had the good"
5264,III.,fortune to command the boat which saved a colonel and Miss Verner; that
5265,III.,they were very nice people; that the colonel was to be stationed at
5266,III.,"Halifax, and had invited him to his house whenever he could get leave on"
5267,III.,"shore.""  He added, ""That will not be very often during these stirring"
5268,III.,"times, but I shall thoroughly enjoy it when I do go, for Miss Alice"
5269,III.,Verner is the most beautiful and amiable girl I have ever seen or expect
5270,III.,"to meet; without a bit of pride about her, and she talks to me as if I"
5271,III.,"were an old friend."""
5272,III.,
5273,III.,"At length the ""Vestal"" dropped her anchor in the fine harbour of"
5274,III.,"Halifax, and with a regret which surprised him, Pearce saw the"
5275,III.,passengers depart for the shore.
5276,III.,
5277,III.,"""Remember, my dear Mr Ripley, Miss Verner and I shall at all times be"
5278,III.,"glad to see you,"" said Colonel Verner as he was about to leave the ship."
5279,III.,"Alice did not say as much as her father, but Pearce believed from the"
5280,III.,expression of her countenance that she willingly seconded her father's
5281,III.,invitation.  Still he knew that the familiar intercourse which had been
5282,III.,"so delightful to him on board must come to an end.  ""What can she ever"
5283,III.,"be to me more than she is at present?"" he exclaimed to himself.  ""She"
5284,III.,says that I saved her life and her father's life; but then I saved the
5285,III.,lives of many other people.  To be sure I have got one step up the
5286,III.,"ratlins, but it may be very long before I get another.  No, no, I'll not"
5287,III.,"think about it."""
5288,III.,
5289,III.,"The next day a special invitation to the governor's table, where he met"
5290,III.,"Colonel and Miss Verner, and where all the gentlemen from the governor"
5291,III.,"downwards drank wine with him, considerably altered his feelings.  This"
5292,III.,was the first of many attentions which he received from the military
5293,III.,officers and the principal inhabitants of Halifax.  His time on shore
5294,III.,was indeed fully occupied in making morning calls and in attending the
5295,III.,parties to which he was invited.  A portion of every morning he spent in
5296,III.,"the society of Miss Verner.  It was very delightful, and he felt sure"
5297,III.,that he was welcome.
5298,III.,
5299,III.,"At length the ""Vestal"" was suddenly ordered to sea.  Pearce had the"
5300,III.,greatest difficulty in getting on shore to wish his friends good-bye.
5301,III.,Alice turned pale when he told her that the ship was to sail that
5302,III.,"evening.  ""You will come back here surely, Mr Ripley,"" she said, in a"
5303,III.,"trembling voice; ""you have been every thing to us since that awful day"
5304,III.,"when you saved our lives from the sinking ship; we shall miss you,"
5305,III.,"indeed we shall, very much."""
5306,III.,
5307,III.,"Pearce could not frame a reply, at least, satisfactory to himself.  He"
5308,III.,"scarcely knew what he said, as he hurried away.  The words might have"
5309,III.,made a vainer man than he was much happier than they did him.
5310,III.,
5311,III.,"The ""Vestal"" was bound for the West Indies.  She cruised for some time,"
5312,III.,"making several rich prizes, which she sent into Port Royal, Jamaica, and"
5313,III.,which filled the purses of her officers and men in a very satisfactory
5314,III.,"manner.  Still, no honour or promotion was to be obtained by the capture"
5315,III.,"of honest merchantmen.  At length, however, there appeared a chance of"
5316,III.,falling in with an antagonist worthy of her.  One morning at dawn a
5317,III.,"stranger was discovered on the lee beam.  The ""Vestal"" was kept away,"
5318,III.,"and all sail made in chase.  As the ""Vestal"" gained on the chase, she"
5319,III.,"was discovered to be a large ship, and pronounced to be flush-decked."
5320,III.,
5321,III.,"""Then we'll tackle her; never mind how many guns she carries,"" exclaimed"
5322,III.,the captain--a sentiment to which his officers and men responded
5323,III.,heartily.
5324,III.,
5325,III.,"The chase was accordingly continued, and as the vessel came up with her"
5326,III.,"on the weather quarter, it was seen that she was a large flush-decked"
5327,III.,"ship, carrying twenty-two guns.  The ensign of France flew out from the"
5328,III.,"stranger's peak, and was saluted by a shot from one of the corvette's"
5329,III.,"bow guns.  The battle thus begun, the ""Vestal"" keeping the weather"
5330,III.,"gauge, was continued for half-an-hour with great fury, till the"
5331,III.,Frenchman's foremast went by the board.  The enemy's guns were well
5332,III.,"handled, and the corvette began to suffer accordingly.  The first"
5333,III.,"lieutenant and five men were killed, and the captain, a midshipman, and"
5334,III.,"several men wounded.  The captain was carried below, and the command"
5335,III.,"devolved on Pearce.  The young lieutenant's heart beat high.  ""Bonham,"""
5336,III.,"he said, addressing his friend who was standing near him, ""we'll take"
5337,III.,"that ship, or go down with our colours flying.""  The breeze which had"
5338,III.,"fallen returned, and as the corvette was still under perfect command, he"
5339,III.,was able at length to obtain a position by which he could pour several
5340,III.,raking broadsides into the bows of the enemy.  Her main-top mast was
5341,III.,shot away; her mizen-mast followed.  The ensign of France was again
5342,III.,"hoisted, but did not long remain flying.  Pearce poured in another"
5343,III.,"broadside, and down it came, the cheers of the British crew giving"
5344,III.,notice of what had occurred to their wounded shipmates below.  The
5345,III.,"prize, which proved to be the ""Desiree,"" had lost a considerable number"
5346,III.,"of her crew, most of them killed during the latter part of the action."
5347,III.,"Bonham was sent on board to take command, and in two days the ""Vestal"""
5348,III.,and her prize entered in triumph the harbour of Port Royal.  Here the
5349,III.,admiral with part of the fleet were at anchor.  Pearce went on board the
5350,III.,"flag-ship to make his report.  He was warmly received, and highly"
5351,III.,complimented on his conduct.  The next day he found that he was to be
5352,III.,"first lieutenant of the corvette, and Bonham received an acting order as"
5353,III.,"second lieutenant.  The ""Vestal"" had received so much damage, that she"
5354,III.,"was obliged to refit at Port Royal.  This took several weeks, and"
5355,III.,"Captain Gale considered himself sufficiently recovered, when she was"
5356,III.,"ready, to go to sea in her.  Pearce had, however, virtually the command."
5357,III.,"Several more prizes were taken.  ""That's young Ripley's doing,"""
5358,III.,"exclaimed the admiral, ""he deserves his promotion, and he shall have"
5359,III.,"it."""
5360,III.,
5361,IV.,IV.
5362,IV.,
5363,IV.,"Once more the ""Vestal"" was at anchor in Port Royal harbour.  In vain her"
5364,IV.,brave captain had striven against the effects of his wounds.  He must
5365,IV.,"return home if he would save his life, he was told, so he applied to be"
5366,IV.,"superseded.  The admiral came on board the ""Vestal"" to inspect her.  The"
5367,IV.,"next day he sent for Ripley, and put a paper into his hand.  Pearce's"
5368,IV.,heart beat quick with proud satisfaction.  The document was an order to
5369,IV.,"take the acting command of the corvette.  ""I have written home by this"
5370,IV.,"post to ask for your commission, and to recommend that you should be"
5371,IV.,"confirmed in the command of the `Vestal,'"" added the admiral.  ""I am"
5372,IV.,sure that you will take care she does as good service as she performed
5373,IV.,"under Captain Gale.""  Bonham, who had received his commission a few"
5374,IV.,"months before, became first lieutenant, and a young _protege_ of the"
5375,IV.,admiral's received an acting order as second; so that the united ages of
5376,IV.,the three principal officers of the ship amounted to little more than
5377,IV.,fifty-five years.  Old heads were worn then on young shoulders.  Many
5378,IV.,"prizes had been taken, and the time approached for their return to Port"
5379,IV.,"Royal.  The corvette lay becalmed.  A French store-ship was expected,"
5380,IV.,"which had been separated from her convoy.  The ""Vestal"" lay disguised,"
5381,IV.,"as was usual in those days, looking very unlike the smart sloop she was."
5382,IV.,"A blue line was seen in the horizon, the sign of an approaching breeze,"
5383,IV.,"and in the midst of it a sail.  The breeze brought up the stranger, a"
5384,IV.,"fine brig, to within about a mile, when it died away.  She was an armed"
5385,IV.,"vessel, and showed by her colours that she was French.  Before long, two"
5386,IV.,boats were seen to put off from her.  Three boats were instantly lowered
5387,IV.,"from the opposite side of the ""Vestal,"" and manned.  The Frenchmen"
5388,IV.,"pulled rapidly on, expecting to make an easy prize of the ""Vestal."""
5389,IV.,Their look of consternation was very great when they first perceived the
5390,IV.,painted canvas which concealed the corvette's guns.  Pearce had
5391,IV.,"carefully watched for the first sign of their wavering, and now ordered"
5392,IV.,"the three boats to make chase.  The Frenchmen, taken by surprise, made"
5393,IV.,"but a slight show of resistance, and in ten minutes the whole party"
5394,IV.,"found themselves prisoners on the deck of the corvette.  The ""Vestal"""
5395,IV.,"was now towed up towards the brig, which opened her fire at the boats,"
5396,IV.,"but this did not deter them from placing the corvette on her quarter,"
5397,IV.,when a few rapidly delivered and almost raking broadsides compelled her
5398,IV.,"to haul down her colours, having had the chief officers left on board"
5399,IV.,"and ten of her crew killed or wounded.  The privateer, which mounted"
5400,IV.,"fourteen guns, was on her way to France, having a large amount of specie"
5401,IV.,"and valuable goods on board, the result of a successful cruise."
5402,IV.,
5403,IV.,It was with no little pride that Captain Ripley returned to Port Royal
5404,IV.,"from his first cruise, with the fine brig in company, the British ensign"
5405,IV.,flying over that of France.  The admiral congratulated him on his
5406,IV.,"success, and at the same time put his commission and appointment into"
5407,IV.,his hand.
5408,IV.,
5409,IV.,"""You must be ready for sea again very soon though,"" said the admiral; ""I"
5410,IV.,"have dispatches to send to Halifax, and unless another cruiser comes in,"
5411,IV.,"I must send you."""
5412,IV.,
5413,IV.,"Pearce, rather to the admiral's surprise, replied with animation, that"
5414,IV.,"he should be ready to sail that evening if required, provided he could"
5415,IV.,"get water, fuel, and fresh provisions on board.  The admiral gave him"
5416,IV.,permission to make everybody exert themselves.
5417,IV.,
5418,IV.,"By noon the next day the young commander had got his ship ready for sea,"
5419,IV.,"and receiving his dispatches with a joyous heart, he shaped a course for"
5420,IV.,"Halifax.  A bright look-out was kept, but on this occasion it was to"
5421,IV.,avoid strange sails.  He was only to fight for the purpose of escaping
5422,IV.,"capture.  Halifax was reached, and Pearce having delivered his"
5423,IV.,"dispatches, hurried up to Colonel Verner's house."
5424,IV.,
5425,IV.,"Miss Verner was at home.  She started, and the colour rose to her cheeks"
5426,IV.,"when Captain Ripley was announced.  She put out her hand, and did not"
5427,IV.,"withdraw it, for Pearce forgot to let it go."
5428,IV.,
5429,IV.,"""Are you really a captain already?"" she asked."
5430,IV.,
5431,IV.,"""Yes; that is, a commander.  I am captain of the `Vestal,'"" he answered,"
5432,IV.,"and he told her how Captain Gale had been compelled to go home, and that"
5433,IV.,he had been appointed in his stead.  He mentioned also the number of
5434,IV.,prizes he had taken--a matter which interested Colonel Verner more than
5435,IV.,it did her.
5436,IV.,
5437,IV.,"""That young Ripley is a very fine fellow,"" observed the colonel to a"
5438,IV.,"brother officer.  ""Why, in one cruise he must have made not far short of"
5439,IV.,ten thousand pounds as his own share of prize-money.  A capital haul for
5440,IV.,the admiral.  Those naval men have better chances than we have of
5441,IV.,"filling their purses."""
5442,IV.,
5443,IV.,"If Pearce had received attentions when only a young lieutenant, he was"
5444,IV.,"doubly courted now that he was a commander, with an established name for"
5445,IV.,gallantry and energy.  Alice Verner no longer hesitated acknowledging to
5446,IV.,herself that she had given him her entire heart.  She felt honoured by
5447,IV.,"his preference, and proud of it among so many others who seemed anxious"
5448,IV.,to obtain it.  Halifax was always a lively place.  There were a great
5449,IV.,"number of resident families with young people, and dances were therefore"
5450,IV.,"much in vogue.  Consequently naval officers were always welcome,"
5451,IV.,"lieutenants and passed midshipmen were acceptable, but young commanders"
5452,IV.,were treated with especial favour.  A more experienced man than Pearce
5453,IV.,"might have had his head turned with the attentions he received.  While,"
5454,IV.,"however, he was grateful for them, he enjoyed to the full the society in"
5455,IV.,"which he found himself, and became neither conceited nor vain.  He had"
5456,IV.,"also the opportunity of comparing Alice Verner with other girls, and he"
5457,IV.,became more than ever convinced of her superiority to them all.  His
5458,IV.,stay at Halifax was likely to be short.  He naturally wished to spend as
5459,IV.,much of his time as possible in her society.  She invariably received
5460,IV.,him so frankly and cordially that all restraint was thrown aside.  He
5461,IV.,felt almost sure that she loved him; so he took her hand and told her
5462,IV.,"how much he loved her, and that he believed he had made enough"
5463,IV.,prize-money already to enable her to live as she had been accustomed to;
5464,IV.,"that he hoped to make more, and that he had good reason to believe he"
5465,IV.,"should before long be a post-captain, when he should be her father's"
5466,IV.,"equal in rank.  Alice was not very much surprised nor agitated, because"
5467,IV.,she was before sure that he loved her.  Still it was very pleasant to
5468,IV.,"hear him say so.  Pearce also felt supremely happy, and did not for a"
5469,IV.,moment contemplate the clouds and storms which might be ahead.  Alice
5470,IV.,herself might possibly have seen difficulties which he did not.  She
5471,IV.,"loved her father, but she knew that he was a proud man and weak on"
5472,IV.,"certain points, and that few men thought more of family and connections."
5473,IV.,It had always surprised her that he had not inquired more particularly
5474,IV.,"about Pearce's parentage, but she concluded that he was acquainted with"
5475,IV.,"the circumstances of the case, and was satisfied.  It was, at all"
5476,IV.,"events, her duty to tell her father that Captain Ripley had declared"
5477,IV.,himself.  Pearce was to dine with them that day.  In the meantime he had
5478,IV.,to go on board.  He returned some time before the dinner hour.  Colonel
5479,IV.,"Verner had not come in, so that Alice had not had an opportunity of"
5480,IV.,speaking to her father.  Pearce told her that a frigate had arrived that
5481,IV.,morning direct from England.  Everybody was eager to hear the news she
5482,IV.,brought.  Probably that kept the colonel from home.  While seated
5483,IV.,"together, and interested more in themselves than in the world at large,"
5484,IV.,"the door was suddenly opened, and Lieutenant Harry Verner was announced."
5485,IV.,
5486,IV.,"""Why, Cousin Harry, where have you dropped from?"" said Alice, rising to"
5487,IV.,"welcome him, ""I did not even know that you were a lieutenant.  You have"
5488,IV.,"grown up out of a little midshipman since I saw you last."""
5489,IV.,
5490,IV.,"""I've dropped from His Britannic Majesty's Frigate `Hecate,' of which I"
5491,IV.,"have the honour of being third lieutenant,"" announced the young man."
5492,IV.,"""And as for changes, though you are lovely as ever, I shall not know"
5493,IV.,"soon whether I am standing on my head or my feet;"" he looked fixedly at"
5494,IV.,Pearce as he spoke.
5495,IV.,
5496,IV.,"""I beg your pardon, Captain Ripley,"" said Alice, recovering herself from"
5497,IV.,"the slight confusion into which she had been thrown; ""I should have"
5498,IV.,"introduced my cousin to you."""
5499,IV.,
5500,IV.,"""Harry Verner and I are old shipmates I suspect, unless there are two of"
5501,IV.,"the name very much like each other,"" said Pearce, rising and putting out"
5502,IV.,his hand.
5503,IV.,
5504,IV.,"""Yes, as midshipmen we were together, I believe,"" answered Harry,"
5505,IV.,"superciliously; ""but really it is difficult to remember all one's old"
5506,IV.,"shipmates."""
5507,IV.,
5508,IV.,Pearce under some circumstances would have been inclined to laugh at
5509,IV.,"Harry Verner's impudence, but it was very evident that the lieutenant"
5510,IV.,"wished to pick a quarrel with him, which was by all means to be avoided."
5511,IV.,Alice had thought her cousin a tiresome boy; he now appeared to have
5512,IV.,grown more disagreeable than before.  Colonel Verner came in and
5513,IV.,"welcomed his nephew, who was the only son of his elder brother; other"
5514,IV.,"guests arrived, and the conversation became general.  Hairy at once"
5515,IV.,"assumed to be the person of most importance in the house, and though he"
5516,IV.,"was laughing and talking with every one, Alice discovered that he was"
5517,IV.,constantly watching her and Captain Ripley whenever they spoke.  Captain
5518,IV.,Ripley had to return on board.  He never slept out of his ship if he
5519,IV.,could avoid it.
5520,IV.,
5521,IV.,"""I suppose, colonel, that you can give me a shake down,"" said Harry; ""I"
5522,IV.,"have got leave to remain on shore."""
5523,IV.,
5524,IV.,Her cousin's remaining prevented Alice from speaking to her father that
5525,IV.,night.  Harry showed no intention of going to bed till Pearce had taken
5526,IV.,"his leave, and Alice had retired.  He then, jumping up from the sofa on"
5527,IV.,"which he had thrown himself, exclaimed, ""My dear uncle, where did you"
5528,IV.,"pick up that man?"""
5529,IV.,
5530,IV.,"""Whom do you mean, Harry?"" asked the colonel, rather astonished at his"
5531,IV.,nephew's somewhat impertinent manner.
5532,IV.,
5533,IV.,"""Why, Captain Ripley, who has just left this,"" answered the lieutenant."
5534,IV.,"""He seems as much at home with Alice as if he were engaged to her."
5535,IV.,"Indeed, I am half expecting you to tell me that he is."""
5536,IV.,
5537,IV.,"""Really, Harry, you are speaking too fast,"" said the colonel; ""Captain"
5538,IV.,"Ripley is one of the finest officers in the navy, and having rendered"
5539,IV.,"the greatest possible service to my daughter and me, I feel bound to"
5540,IV.,"treat him with every consideration and kindness."""
5541,IV.,
5542,IV.,"""Which he repays by aspiring to my cousin's hand,"" answered Harry."
5543,IV.,"""Were he a man of family I should say nothing, of course; but he is,"
5544,IV.,"sir, a mere adventurer.  His father is a common boatswain--a warrant"
5545,IV.,"officer--not a gentleman even by courtesy, and his mother, for what I"
5546,IV.,"know to the contrary, might have been a bum-boat woman, and his"
5547,IV.,"relations, if he had any, are probably all of the lowest order."""
5548,IV.,
5549,IV.,"The colonel walked up and down the room very much annoyed.  ""Though what"
5550,IV.,"you say may be true, Harry, that cannot detract from Captain Ripley's"
5551,IV.,"fine qualities nor relieve me of the obligations I owe him,"" he observed"
5552,IV.,"after a time.  ""Of course, were he to dream of marrying Alice, that"
5553,IV.,"would alter the case, and I should be compelled to put a stop to our"
5554,IV.,present friendly intercourse; but I do not believe that such an idea
5555,IV.,"enters his head.  He is like you sailors generally, here to-day and gone"
5556,IV.,to-morrow.  Probably when he leaves this we may not see him again for
5557,IV.,"years to come."""
5558,IV.,
5559,IV.,"""Not so sure of that,"" said Harry; ""Ripley was always very determined"
5560,IV.,"when he made up his mind to do a thing, and you will pardon me, uncle,"
5561,IV.,but the way in which he was speaking to her when I came into the room
5562,IV.,"was anything but that of an ordinary acquaintance."""
5563,IV.,
5564,IV.,"""I'll see about it, I'll see about it,"" exclaimed the colonel, now more"
5565,IV.,"than ever annoyed.  ""It is impossible that a man of such low extraction"
5566,IV.,"should aspire to the hand of my daughter.  The idea is too absurd!"""
5567,IV.,
5568,IV.,Harry Verner retired to rest that night under the comfortable belief
5569,IV.,"that he had revenged himself on the man whom he had always disliked, and"
5570,IV.,"now envied, for his rapid promotion and success."
5571,IV.,
5572,V.,V.
5573,V.,
5574,V.,"The arrival of the ""Hecate"" relieved the ""Vestal,"" which was ordered to"
5575,V.,proceed at once to sea.  Poor Alice received Captain Ripley with marks
5576,V.,"of sorrow in her countenance which alarmed him.  ""My father will not"
5577,V.,"hear of it,"" she exclaimed, giving way to a burst of grief; ""but I told"
5578,V.,"him, and I promise you, that I will marry no one else."""
5579,V.,
5580,V.,"""I know, I feel, and I am sure you will not, dearest,"" said Pearce,"
5581,V.,"tenderly gazing at her.  ""And be of good courage, I trust yet to do"
5582,V.,deeds and to gain a name to which those who now scorn me for my humble
5583,V.,"birth may be proud to ally themselves."""
5584,V.,
5585,V.,"Pearce had never before uttered anything like a boast, but his swelling"
5586,V.,"heart assured him of what he could do, and his indignation at the"
5587,V.,contempt in which his father was held made him speak in a vaunting tone
5588,V.,"so different to his nature.  The moment of parting arrived; Alice,"
5589,V.,"unasked, renewed her promise, and Pearce hurried on board unwilling to"
5590,V.,encounter any of his ordinary acquaintances in the town.  It was well
5591,V.,for Harry Verner that he did not fall in with him.  Before night the
5592,V.,"corvette was far away from Halifax.  Pearce was not exactly unhappy, but"
5593,V.,he was in an excellent mood for undertaking any daring act which might
5594,V.,"present itself.  Once more he returned to Jamaica, picking up a few"
5595,V.,"prizes on the way.  ""Always welcome, Captain Ripley,"" said the admiral,"
5596,V.,cordially greeting Pearce when he appeared at the Penn to report
5597,V.,"himself.  ""You've done so well in the sloop that we must get you into a"
5598,V.,"smart frigate; you'll not have to wait long for a vacancy, I dare say."""
5599,V.,This commendation was sufficient to restore Pearce's spirits.  He hoped
5600,V.,to do something before the corvette had to return home.  There are two
5601,V.,classes of people who hope to do something--one waits for the
5602,V.,"opportunity to occur, the other goes in search of it and seldom fails in"
5603,V.,the search.  Pearce Ripley belonged to the latter class.  Several more
5604,V.,"prizes were taken, and a considerable amount of damage done to the"
5605,V.,"commerce of the enemy; but still the ""Vestal"" had not fallen in with an"
5606,V.,enemy the conquest of whom would bring glory as well as profit.  Week
5607,V.,after week passed away.  It had been blowing hard.  The wind dropped at
5608,V.,"sunset; the night was very dark and thick, an object could scarcely have"
5609,V.,"been discerned beyond the bowsprit end.  The island of Deserade,"
5610,V.,"belonging to France, bore south-east by south, six or seven leagues,"
5611,V.,"when, as day broke and the light increased, a ship was perceived close"
5612,V.,"on the weather-beam, which in a short time was made out to be an enemy's"
5613,V.,frigate.  The breeze had by this time sprung up again and was blowing
5614,V.,fresh.
5615,V.,
5616,V.,"""We may fight her or try to escape,"" said the captain to Bonham, eyeing"
5617,V.,the frigate as if he would rather try fighting first.
5618,V.,
5619,V.,"""I should say that the odds being so greatly against us we ought to try"
5620,V.,"to escape,"" answered the first lieutenant; ""but I speak my own"
5621,V.,"sentiments, and I am sure that of all on board, if fight we must, we"
5622,V.,will all be ready to stand by you to the last.  Victory does not always
5623,V.,"side with the biggest."""
5624,V.,
5625,V.,"Sail was accordingly made to the north-west, but no sooner had she"
5626,V.,shaped a course than the frigate under a cloud of canvas came tearing
5627,V.,"after her at a rate which proved that the ""Vestal"" had not a chance of"
5628,V.,escaping.  The crew showed by unmistakeable signs that they expected to
5629,V.,"be captured, by going below and putting on their best clothes.  Pearce"
5630,V.,"called them aft, ""Lads, we have served together for three years, and"
5631,V.,done many a deed to be proud of.  Do not let the Frenchmen boast that
5632,V.,they took us without our having done our best to prevent them.  I
5633,V.,"purpose to fight that frigate if you will stand by me, and that I am"
5634,V.,"sure you will."""
5635,V.,
5636,V.,"""Ay, ay, that we will, and would if she were twice as big, and sink at"
5637,V.,"our guns before we strike,"" shouted Dick Rogers, and their loud cheers"
5638,V.,expressed the sentiments of the rest.  The corvette at once prepared for
5639,V.,"action, and as soon as all was ready she shortened sail to allow the"
5640,V.,"frigate to come up, greatly to the Frenchmen's surprise probably.  The"
5641,V.,"latter began firing as soon as her guns could reach the corvette.  ""Let"
5642,V.,"not a shot be returned till I give the order, lads,"" cried Ripley; ""we"
5643,V.,"must throw none away.""  He waited till his carronades would tell with"
5644,V.,"effect.  ""Now give it them, lads,"" he shouted."
5645,V.,
5646,V.,The heavy shot crashed against the side of the frigate in a way which
5647,V.,"astonished the Frenchmen.  With wonderful rapidity the guns were run in,"
5648,V.,"loaded, and again sent forth their death-dealing shower of iron, this"
5649,V.,"time tearing through the frigate's upper bulwarks, sweeping across her"
5650,V.,"quarterdeck and wounding her masts.  ""Hurrah! we have knocked away her"
5651,V.,"wheel,"" cried Bonham, who had sprung into the mizen rigging to ascertain"
5652,V.,"the effect of the last broadside; ""she's ours, if we are smart with our"
5653,V.,"guns."""
5654,V.,
5655,V.,The Frenchmen had just fired a broadside which had killed three of the
5656,V.,"""Vestal's"" crew, knocked one of her boats to pieces, and done other"
5657,V.,"damage, but had not materially injured her running rigging.  Firing"
5658,V.,"another broadside in return, Pearce saw that by wearing sharp round he"
5659,V.,"could pass under the stem of the frigate, and at the same time bring a"
5660,V.,"fresh broadside to bear on her.  The manoeuvre was rapidly executed, the"
5661,V.,effect was very great on board the enemy.  The crew were seen to be
5662,V.,hurrying to and fro as if in dread of some event about to occur.  It was
5663,V.,next seen that all sail was being made on the frigate.  The men had
5664,V.,deserted their guns.  The British seamen plied the enemy with their
5665,V.,carronades with still greater energy.  The great masses of iron were
5666,V.,hauled in and out as if they had been made of wood.  Their only fear was
5667,V.,that their antagonist would escape them.  More sail was made on the
5668,V.,"corvette to keep up with him.  To prevent the corvette from following,"
5669,V.,"the Frenchmen again returned to their guns, and the frigate suddenly"
5670,V.,hauling up let fly her broadside.  Pearce saw the manoeuvre about to be
5671,V.,"executed, and was just in time to haul up also to save the ""Vestal"" from"
5672,V.,"being raked.  The frigate's shot, accompanied by a shower of musketry,"
5673,V.,came tearing on board.  Hitherto one officer and four men had been
5674,V.,"killed on board the ""Vestal,"" and six wounded, including the master"
5675,V.,"slightly--a heavy loss out of a sloop's complement, but Pearce saw"
5676,V.,"victory within his grasp, and resolved to persevere.  The last broadside"
5677,V.,from the frigate told with fearful effect on the corvette.  Her spars
5678,V.,"and rigging were much cut about; three more men wore struck, and the"
5679,V.,brave captain was seen to stagger back.  Had not Rogers sprang forward
5680,V.,and caught him in his arms he would have fallen to the deck.  He was
5681,V.,"speechless, but he motioned to Bonham, who ran up to continue the fight."
5682,V.,"When an attempt was made to carry him below, he signified that he would"
5683,V.,remain on deck till the battle was won.  The surgeon came up and
5684,V.,stanched the blood flowing from his shoulder.  The nervous system had
5685,V.,"received a violent shock, but he could not tell whether the mound would"
5686,V.,"prove mortal, the surgeon reported.  Still the battle raged.  The French"
5687,V.,were again seen to quit their guns.  The corvette followed up her
5688,V.,success.  It was observed that buckets were being hauled up through the
5689,V.,"ports, the frigate must be on fire; her foremast fell, the corvette"
5690,V.,"ranged up alongside, the French ensign was still flying.  Bonham was"
5691,V.,"ordering another broadside to be poured in, when down came the enemy's"
5692,V.,"flag, and at that moment, Pearce recovering, joined in the cheer which"
5693,V.,burst from the lips of the British crew.
5694,V.,
5695,V.,"""Go and help the poor fellows,"" were the first words the young captain"
5696,V.,spoke.  The corvette's boats which could swim were lowered and armed
5697,V.,"with buckets, the English seamen hurried up the sides of their late"
5698,V.,"opponent.  Her deck presented everywhere signs of their prowess, covered"
5699,V.,"with the bodies of the slain, and the wreck of the foremast and rigging;"
5700,V.,the wheel had been shot away and three men killed at it.  As a security
5701,V.,"Bonham, who had gone on board and received the commanding officer's"
5702,V.,"sword, the captain having been killed, sent him and three others on"
5703,V.,"board the corvette, while he and his men set to work to extinguish the"
5704,V.,"flames.  The magazine was happily drowned, which was of itself a"
5705,V.,"sufficient reason for the frigate to have struck, though the state of"
5706,V.,"her masts and spars, and the number of her killed and wounded showed the"
5707,V.,skill and courage of her comparatively tiny opponent.  The fire was at
5708,V.,"length got under, very much by the efforts of the Englishmen, who had to"
5709,V.,hint to the French that if they did not exert themselves they would be
5710,V.,"left to perish, as it would be impossible to get them all on board the"
5711,V.,corvette before the frigate would become untenable.  The corvette and
5712,V.,"her prize having been put somewhat to rights, made sail for Jamaica."
5713,V.,"They had a long passage up, and the greatest vigilance was necessary to"
5714,V.,keep the prisoners in order.  A plot was discovered for retaking the
5715,V.,"frigate, and Bonham had to threaten the French officers with severe"
5716,V.,punishment should anything of the sort be again attempted.
5717,V.,
5718,V.,Pearce Ripley lay in his cabin unable to move.  The hearts of the
5719,V.,"officers and men were deeply grieved, for the surgeon would not"
5720,V.,"pronounce a favourable opinion.  He was young, and had a good"
5721,V.,constitution.  He might recover.  The corvette succeeded in carrying her
5722,V.,prize to Jamaica.  The admiral himself came on board to see Ripley and
5723,V.,"to congratulate him on his achievement.  ""Your promotion is certain,"
5724,V.,"Captain Ripley,"" he said kindly; ""and I should think his Majesty, when"
5725,V.,"he hears of your gallantry, won't forget to give a touch on your"
5726,V.,"shoulder with the flat of his sword, eh.  You will find a handle to your"
5727,V.,"name convenient, and you deserve it, that you do, my lad."""
5728,V.,
5729,V.,The admiral's kindness contributed much to restore Pearce to health.
5730,V.,While he remained on shore Bonham received an acting order to take
5731,V.,"command of the ""Vestal.""  Before Pearce had totally recovered he"
5732,V.,received his post rank with a complimentary letter on his gallantry.
5733,V.,"Bonham, at the same time, found that he was made a commander; the"
5734,V.,"""Vestal,"" having been upwards of four years in commission, was ordered"
5735,V.,home.  Captain Ripley taking a passage in her.  She escaped all the
5736,V.,"enemy's cruisers, and arrived safely in Portsmouth harbour.  She was,"
5737,V.,"however, considered fit to go to sea again after an ordinary repair, and"
5738,V.,was recommissioned by Captain Bonham.  Pearce was sent for by the First
5739,V.,Lord of the Admiralty to attend the King's levee.  He was presented to
5740,V.,"his Majesty, that good old king who truly loved a sailor, and knew how"
5741,V.,to appreciate honour and valour.  On kneeling to kiss his sovereign's
5742,V.,"hand he felt a touch on his shoulder, and with astonishment, gratitude,"
5743,V.,"and delight, heard the King say, ""Rise, Sir Pearce Ripley; you are well"
5744,V.,"deserving of knighthood."""
5745,V.,
5746,V.,"Pearce felt very much inclined to shake the King cordially by the hand,"
5747,V.,and to assure his Majesty that no reward could be more satisfactory.  He
5748,V.,"did not, however, nor did he say why he was so pleased with the rank"
5749,V.,"bestowed on him, but made the usual bow, and moved off to allow others"
5750,V.,"to present themselves.  There was one, however, waiting for him outside"
5751,V.,"the palace, as fine and officer-like looking man as any of those present"
5752,V.,"in admirals' or post-captains' uniforms--his father, and the knowledge"
5753,V.,"of the intense delight his promotion gave him, greatly added to the"
5754,V.,satisfaction Pearce felt on the occasion.  Sir Pearce Ripley was
5755,V.,"gazetted the next day to the command of a fine frigate, the name of"
5756,V.,which he soon made well-known by the gallant exploits he performed in
5757,V.,her.
5758,V.,
5759,VI.,VI.
5760,VI.,
5761,VI.,"Two years had passed by.  Colonel Verner, now a general, with his"
5762,VI.,"daughter, had returned to England, and they were spending some weeks"
5763,VI.,"during the summer at the house of a friend, Admiral Sir J. B--, in the"
5764,VI.,"Isle of Wight, in the neighbourhood of the then pretty little village of"
5765,VI.,"Ryde.  Alice looked thinner and paler than formerly, but her beauty was"
5766,VI.,"in no way impaired, and the sweet smile which lit up her countenance--"
5767,VI.,"one of its chief charms when she spoke, was still there.  She had"
5768,VI.,accompanied her father and the admiral on a walk into Ryde.  When some
5769,VI.,"little distance from the village, they met a fine dignified-looking man,"
5770,VI.,his silvery hair showing that his age was greater than would have been
5771,VI.,"supposed from his florid, clear complexion.  An undress naval uniform"
5772,VI.,set off his fine figure to advantage.  The admiral looked at him for a
5773,VI.,"Element, and then shaking him cordially by the hand, inquired what"
5774,VI.,brought him to Ryde.
5775,VI.,
5776,VI.,"""I have taken a cottage in the neighbourhood for my son's sake when he"
5777,VI.,"comes home, for as I have quitted the service I shall always be ready to"
5778,VI.,"receive him,"" was the answer."
5779,VI.,
5780,VI.,"""Oh, then we are near neighbours.  Come over and dine with me to-day.  I"
5781,VI.,"like to talk over by-gone days with an old shipmate,"" said the admiral."
5782,VI.,
5783,VI.,"The stranger accepted the invitation, and after a little more"
5784,VI.,"conversation, he walked on."
5785,VI.,
5786,VI.,"""A distinguished man,"" observed General Verner, when the admiral"
5787,VI.,rejoined him.
5788,VI.,
5789,VI.,"""A right noble and brave man,"" said the admiral, but made no further"
5790,VI.,remark.
5791,VI.,
5792,VI.,"The stranger was in the drawing-room when Miss Verner entered, and was"
5793,VI.,soon engaged in an animated conversation with her.  She thought him
5794,VI.,"somewhat old-fashioned in his phraseology, perhaps, and mode of"
5795,VI.,"pronunciation, but she had so frequently heard officers of high rank"
5796,VI.,"speak in the same way, that she was not surprised, and as he had seen a"
5797,VI.,"great deal of the world, and described well what he had seen, she was"
5798,VI.,"much interested.  As she listened, she felt her interest increase, and"
5799,VI.,became insensibly drawn towards the old gentleman.  As there were many
5800,VI.,"married ladies present, she was led out among the first, and so she did"
5801,VI.,"not see when he left the room, which might have given her an idea as to"
5802,VI.,"his rank, but she found herself sitting next to him at dinner.  Her"
5803,VI.,"father was opposite, and appeared to be much interested in his"
5804,VI.,"conversation.  According to the good old custom, the admiral drank wine"
5805,VI.,"round with all his guests.  ""Mr Ripley, will you take wine?"" he said,"
5806,VI.,"addressing her companion in his kind friendly tone.  She started, and"
5807,VI.,she felt the blood rush to her cheeks.  She had not recovered from her
5808,VI.,"confusion before the ceremony of wine-taking was over, and the old"
5809,VI.,gentleman again addressed her.  Could he be the father of Pearce?  She
5810,VI.,"had always understood that his father was a boatswain, and this old"
5811,VI.,"gentleman could not be that, or he would scarcely have been dining at"
5812,VI.,the admiral's table.  Her father would make the inquiry probably of the
5813,VI.,"admiral; if not, she must try to muster courage to do so.  In the mean"
5814,VI.,time she would ask her companion if he knew Sir Pearce Ripley.  In a low
5815,VI.,and somewhat trembling voice she put the question.
5816,VI.,
5817,VI.,"""Indeed I do, young lady, and am proud to own him as my son,"" answered"
5818,VI.,"the old seaman, fixing his clear grey eyes on her, as if he would read"
5819,VI.,"her heart.  ""I have a hope that you know him too, and that no two people"
5820,VI.,"love him better in the world,"" he added in a whisper."
5821,VI.,
5822,VI.,"Alice felt her cheeks glow, and yet she was not annoyed.  ""Indeed you"
5823,VI.,"are right,"" she said, in a low tone, which she hoped no one else would"
5824,VI.,"hear, for several people were speaking loudly, and there was a clatter"
5825,VI.,of knives and forks.
5826,VI.,
5827,VI.,"""He will be in England again soon to refit, for he has allowed his"
5828,VI.,"frigate very little rest since he commanded her,"" observed the old"
5829,VI.,"gentleman.  ""He, I hope too, will then get a spell at home, for since he"
5830,VI.,"went to sea at ten years of age, he has never once been ten days on"
5831,VI.,"shore at a time, ay, I may say, not a month altogether."""
5832,VI.,
5833,VI.,Alice whispered her hope that he would remain on shore.  After retiring
5834,VI.,to the drawing-room she looked anxiously for the arrival of the
5835,VI.,gentlemen.  Her father and Mr Ripley entered together.  The general
5836,VI.,soon came and sat down by her.
5837,VI.,
5838,VI.,"""A very agreeable old naval officer that is we've been talking to,"" he"
5839,VI.,"remarked; ""I did not catch his name, but the admiral tells me that he is"
5840,VI.,"a master in the service."""
5841,VI.,
5842,VI.,"Alice was pleased to hear this, but much puzzled.  She managed to speak"
5843,VI.,"to the admiral when no one was near.  He put on a quizzical look.  ""Now,"
5844,VI.,"young lady, if you had been inquiring about Sir Pearce Ripley, his son,"
5845,VI.,"I should not have been surprised,"" he answered.  ""The fact is, my friend"
5846,VI.,Ripley became a master late in life.  He had served in the lower grades
5847,VI.,"of the profession, and if the rules of the service had allowed it, he"
5848,VI.,should have been made a post-captain.  I cannot tell you all the brave
5849,VI.,"things he has done.  When in charge of a prize, he fought a most gallant"
5850,VI.,action; he prevented his ship's company from joining the mutineers at
5851,VI.,"the Nore.  On two several occasions, he saved the ship from being"
5852,VI.,"wrecked, not to mention his conduct on the first of June, and on"
5853,VI.,"numerous previous occasions.  I placed his son on the quarterdeck,"
5854,VI.,"predicting that he would be an honour to the service, and so he is, and"
5855,VI.,"I am proud of him."""
5856,VI.,
5857,VI.,"While the admiral was speaking, Alice was considering whether she should"
5858,VI.,"confide her case to him, and beg him to intercede with her father, or"
5859,VI.,rather to speak to him of Mr Ripley in a way which might overcome his
5860,VI.,"prejudices.  She almost gasped for breath in her agitation, but her"
5861,VI.,"resolution was taken, and without loss of time she hurriedly told him of"
5862,VI.,her engagement to Sir Pearce Ripley.
5863,VI.,
5864,VI.,"""I am heartily glad to hear of it, my dear young lady,"" exclaimed the"
5865,VI.,"admiral warmly; ""he is worthy of you and you are of him, and that is"
5866,VI.,saying a great deal for you.  Hoity toity!  I wonder my friend General
5867,VI.,Verner has not more sense; the idea of dismissing one of the finest
5868,VI.,officers in the service because he hasn't a rent-roll and cannot show a
5869,VI.,"pedigree as many do a yard long, and without a word of truth from"
5870,VI.,beginning to end.  If a man is noble in himself what does it matter who
5871,VI.,"his father was?  The best pedigree, in my opinion, is that which a man's"
5872,VI.,grandson will have to show.  Better to have one noble fellow like old
5873,VI.,"Ripley there for a father, than a line of twenty indifferent"
5874,VI.,"progenitors, such as nine-tenths of those who set such store by their"
5875,VI.,"ancestry can boast of."""
5876,VI.,
5877,VI.,"Alice very naturally agreed with the admiral, who was himself a man of"
5878,VI.,much older family than her father.  He attacked the general the next
5879,VI.,"morning.  He hated circumlocution and went directly to the point.  ""You"
5880,VI.,object to your daughter marrying Sir Pearce Ripley because his father
5881,VI.,was a boatswain.  I tell you I was for many years of inferior rank to a
5882,VI.,boatswain.  I entered the navy as captain's servant.  What do you say to
5883,VI.,"that?  It does not signify what a man has been, it is what he is should"
5884,VI.,"be considered.  Now, my dear general, just clap all such nonsense under"
5885,VI.,"hatches, and the next time young Ripley asks your daughter to marry him,"
5886,VI.,"let her, and be thankful that you have secured so fine a son-in-law and"
5887,VI.,"so excellent a husband for the girl."""
5888,VI.,
5889,VI.,General Verner had not a word of reply to his friend's remonstrance.
5890,VI.,"The admiral, when he met Alice, exclaimed, ""I've been pouring my"
5891,VI.,broadsides into your father till I left him without a stick standing and
5892,VI.,every gun dismounted; if you give him a shot depend on't he'll strike
5893,VI.,"his flag."""
5894,VI.,
5895,VII.,VII.
5896,VII.,
5897,VII.,"The admiral's house commanded an extensive view of the Solent, looking"
5898,VII.,"across to Portsmouth, down the channel towards Cowes and up over"
5899,VII.,"Spithead.  One bright morning after breakfast, the admiral, as usual,"
5900,VII.,"with his eye at the telescope, was watching the ever-varying scene on"
5901,VII.,"the waters before him, when he exclaimed, ""Two frigates standing in, and"
5902,VII.,"one is French, a prize to the other.  To my eye the Frenchman seems the"
5903,VII.,"biggest of the two; I must send over and learn all about it.""  He rang"
5904,VII.,"the bell, his old coxswain appeared.  ""Judson, take the wherry and board"
5905,VII.,"that frigate, and give my compliments and learn the particulars of the"
5906,VII.,"action, and if her captain can spare time I shall be very glad to see"
5907,VII.,"him.  Here, give this note if--"" The admiral spoke a few words in an"
5908,VII.,under tone heard by no one else.
5909,VII.,
5910,VII.,"Judson hurried off.  There was a fair breeze to Spithead, and back--a"
5911,VII.,soldier's wind.  Alice watched the progress of the boat with great
5912,VII.,"interest.  She reached the English frigate, remained a short time, and"
5913,VII.,was speedily on her way back.  Before she had long left the frigate she
5914,VII.,was followed by another boat which overtook her as she reached the
5915,VII.,shore.
5916,VII.,
5917,VII.,"A short time afterwards, Judson appeared, and put a card into his"
5918,VII.,"master's hand, ""Say that I shall be delighted to see him when he can"
5919,VII.,"come up."""
5920,VII.,
5921,VII.,"""What about the action, Judson?"" asked the admiral."
5922,VII.,
5923,VII.,"""Just the finest, sir, that has been fought during the war,"" answered"
5924,VII.,"Judson.  ""He'll be up here presently, and tell you more about it than I"
5925,VII.,"can."""
5926,VII.,
5927,VII.,"Scarcely ten minutes had passed by, when Judson announced ""Captain Sir"
5928,VII.,"Pearce Ripley!""  The admiral received the young captain with every mark"
5929,VII.,"of regard.  ""And now let me introduce you to my guests, General and Miss"
5930,VII.,"Verner; but, by the by, you know them, I think."""
5931,VII.,
5932,VII.,"Alice, lost to all sense of decorum, sprang forward to receive him.  The"
5933,VII.,"general put out his hand in a cordial manner, and with many compliments"
5934,VII.,congratulated him on his success.  The admiral having listened to an
5935,VII.,"account of the action, dragged off the general to see some improvements"
5936,VII.,"on the farm; the Indies of the family left the room, and Pearce Ripley"
5937,VII.,heard from Alice's own lips that her father fully sanctioned their
5938,VII.,"union.  He claimed a sailor's privilege, and before a month had passed"
5939,VII.,their marriage took place.
5940,VII.,
5941,VII.,"Bonham obtained his post rank, and though he had not the talent of his"
5942,VII.,"friend, he ever proved himself an active efficient officer.  Harry"
5943,VII.,"Verner quitted the service, finding that, notwithstanding his"
5944,VII.,"connections, his merits were not appreciated, and that he was not likely"
5945,VII.,to obtain his promotion.  He soon afterwards broke his neck out hunting.
5946,VII.,"Sir Pearce Ripley commanded several line of battle ships, and took an"
5947,VII.,active part in three of England's greatest naval victories.  He in due
5948,VII.,"course became an admiral, and was created a baronet, and his sons"
5949,VII.,entering the navy rose to the highest rank in their noble profession.
