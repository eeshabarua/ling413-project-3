96,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"All those bright natures which adorned its prime,"
97,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And left us nothing to believe in, worth"

99,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A lady-witch there lived on Atlas' mountain                   _55
100,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Within a cavern, by a secret fountain."
101,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,

105,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In his wide voyage o'er continents and seas
106,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"So fair a creature, as she lay enfolden                       _60"
107,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In the warm shadow of her loveliness;--
108,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"He kissed her with his beams, and made all golden"

119,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Then, into one of those mysterious stars"

121,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
122,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,4.

131,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
132,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,5.
133,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A lovely lady garmented in light
134,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"From her own beauty--deep her eyes, as are"

136,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Seen through a Temple's cloven roof--her hair
137,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Dark--the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight.                _85
138,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Picturing her form; her soft smiles shone afar,"
139,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And her low voice was heard like love, and drew"
140,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,All living things towards this wonder new.
141,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
142,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,6.
143,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And first the spotted cameleopard came,"
144,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And then the wise and fearless elephant;                      _90
145,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame"
146,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt
147,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.
148,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,They drank before her at her sacred fount;

150,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Such gentleness and power even to behold.
151,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
152,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,7.
153,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The brinded lioness led forth her young,"
154,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,That she might teach them how they should forego

161,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
162,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,8.
163,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And old Silenus, shaking a green stick                        _105"
164,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew"
165,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick"
166,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:"
167,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,"
168,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Teasing the God to sing them something new;                   _110
169,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Till in this cave they found the lady lone,"
170,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.
171,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
172,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,9.
173,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,"
174,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And though none saw him,--through the adamant"
175,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115"
176,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And through those living spirits, like a want,"
177,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,He passed out of his everlasting lair
178,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,"
179,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--"

181,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
182,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,10.
183,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,"
184,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,"
185,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Who drives her white waves over the green sea,"
186,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,"
187,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125"
188,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks"
189,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--
190,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.
191,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
192,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,11.
193,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,"
194,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130
195,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Their spirits shook within them, as a flame"
196,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:
197,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,"
198,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt"
199,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135"
200,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed."
201,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
202,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,12.
203,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,For she was beautiful--her beauty made
204,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The bright world dim, and everything beside"
205,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:
206,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140"
207,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,"
208,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"On any object in the world so wide,"
209,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"On any hope within the circling skies,"
210,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"But on her form, and in her inmost eyes."
211,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
212,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,13.
213,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145"
214,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three"
215,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle"
216,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she
217,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle"
218,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150"
219,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--
220,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A shadow for the splendour of her love.
221,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
222,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,14.
223,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling
224,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,"
225,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155"
226,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Folded in cells of crystal silence there;
227,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling"
228,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Will never die--yet ere we are aware,"
229,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,"
230,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160
231,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
232,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,15.
233,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,"
234,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,"
235,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint"
236,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.
237,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165
238,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,"
239,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,"
240,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.
241,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
242,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,16.
243,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And odours in a kind of aviary
244,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170"
245,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy"
246,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;
247,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"As bats at the wired window of a dairy,"
248,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"They beat their vans; and each was an adept,"
249,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175"
250,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds."
251,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
252,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,17.
253,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might"
254,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,"
255,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And change eternal death into a night
256,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180"
257,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Could make their tears all wonder and delight,"
258,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She in her crystal vials did closely keep:
259,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said"
260,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The living were not envied of the dead.
261,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
262,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,18.
263,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185"
264,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The works of some Saturnian Archimage,"
265,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Which taught the expiations at whose price
266,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Men from the Gods might win that happy age
267,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;"
268,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190
269,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of gold and blood--till men should live and move
270,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Harmonious as the sacred stars above;
271,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
272,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,19.
273,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And how all things that seem untameable,"
274,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Not to be checked and not to be confined,"

276,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,"
277,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;
278,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And other scrolls whose writings did unbind
279,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The inmost lore of Love--let the profane
280,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200
281,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
282,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,20.
283,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And wondrous works of substances unknown,"
284,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To which the enchantment of her father's power
285,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,"
286,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;
287,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205"
288,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In their own golden beams--each like a flower,"
289,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light
290,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Under a cypress in a starless night.
291,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
292,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,21.
293,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"At first she lived alone in this wild home,"
294,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210"
295,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,"
296,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,"
297,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To work whatever purposes might come

300,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Through all the regions which he shines upon.
301,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
302,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,22.
303,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,"
304,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,"
305,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Offered to do her bidding through the seas,"
306,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220"
307,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And far beneath the matted roots of trees,"
308,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,"

310,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.
311,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
312,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,23.
313,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225"
314,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,'The fountains where the Naiades bedew
315,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;"
316,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew"
317,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;
318,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230

321,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
322,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,24.
323,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--"

331,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
332,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,25.
333,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well
334,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,"
335,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And every little circlet where they fell
336,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres
337,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245
338,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of sobbing voices came upon her ears
339,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"From those departing Forms, o'er the serene"

343,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"All day the wizard lady sate aloof,"
344,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250"
345,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;
346,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Or broidering the pictured poesy
347,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of some high tale upon her growing woof,"
348,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye
349,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255
350,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Added some grace to the wrought poesy.
351,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
352,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,27.
353,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece
354,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;"
355,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--
356,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260
357,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this"
358,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.
359,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand"
360,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.
361,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
362,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,28.
363,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265"
364,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,All night within the fountain--as in sleep.
365,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;
366,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Through the green splendour of the water deep
367,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She saw the constellations reel and dance
368,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270
369,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The tenour of her contemplations calm,"
370,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm."
371,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
372,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,29.
373,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended
374,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,"
375,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275"
376,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel
377,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,"
378,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,There yawned an inextinguishable well
379,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,"
380,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280
381,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
382,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,30.
383,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Within the which she lay when the fierce war
384,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor
385,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In many a mimic moon and bearded star
386,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker
387,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285"
388,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And when the windless snow descended thicker
389,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came"
390,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Melt on the surface of the level flame.
391,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
392,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,31.
393,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought"
394,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290"
395,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,But it was found too feeble to be fraught
396,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"With all the ardours in that sphere which are,"
397,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And so she sold it, and Apollo bought"
398,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And gave it to this daughter: from a car

402,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,32.
403,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And others say, that, when but three hours old,"
404,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,"
405,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,"

407,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,"
408,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept"

410,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And with his wings fanning it as it grew.
411,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
412,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,33.
413,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305"
414,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began"
415,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To turn the light and dew by inward power
416,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To its own substance; woven tracery ran
417,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er"
418,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310"
419,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion
420,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.
421,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
422,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,34.
423,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit"
424,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"A living spirit within all its frame,"
425,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315
426,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,"

430,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320
431,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
432,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,35.
433,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow
434,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Together, tempering the repugnant mass"
435,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,With liquid love--all things together grow
436,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Through which the harmony of love can pass;
437,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325
438,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"A living Image, which did far surpass"
439,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In beauty that bright shape of vital stone

441,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
442,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,36.
443,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"A sexless thing it was, and in its growth"

445,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--"
446,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;
447,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,"
448,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The countenance was such as might select
449,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335"

482,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,40.
483,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And ever as she went, the Image lay"

510,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Lighting it far upon its lampless way.
511,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
512,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,43.

522,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,44.
523,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,"
524,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,With stars of fire spotting the stream below;

573,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A haven beneath whose translucent floor
574,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,"

605,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The armies of her ministering spirits--
606,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460"
607,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"They came, each troop emblazoning its merits"

609,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of the intertexture of the atmosphere
610,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.
611,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
612,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,53.
613,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465

619,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,"

631,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
632,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,55.
633,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,These were tame pleasures; she would often climb
634,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The steepest ladder of the crudded rack
635,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,"

667,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes
668,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510
669,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,"
670,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.
671,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
672,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,59.
673,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And where within the surface of the river
674,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The shadows of the massy temples lie,"
675,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515
676,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Like things which every cloud can doom to die,"
677,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever"
678,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The works of man pierced that serenest sky
679,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight"
680,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520
681,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
682,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,60.
683,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,With motion like the spirit of that wind
684,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet"
685,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.
686,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,"
687,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525"
688,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,With many a dark and subterranean street
689,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep"
690,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"She passed, observing mortals in their sleep."
691,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
692,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,61.
693,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see
694,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530
695,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Here lay two sister twins in infancy;
696,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;"
697,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Within, two lovers linked innocently"
698,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,In their loose locks which over both did creep
699,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535
700,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.
701,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
702,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,62.
703,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,"
704,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Not to be mirrored in a holy song--
705,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Distortions foul of supernatural awe,"
706,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540
707,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And all the code of Custom's lawless law
708,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Written upon the brows of old and young:
709,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife"
710,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'
711,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
712,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,63.
713,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545
714,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"We, the weak mariners of that wide lake"
715,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,"
716,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Our course unpiloted and starless make
717,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--
718,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550"
719,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide
720,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.
721,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
722,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,64.
723,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And she saw princes couched under the glow
724,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court
725,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555"
726,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--
727,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,For all were educated to be so.--
728,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The peasants in their huts, and in the port"
729,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,"
730,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560
731,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
732,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,65.
733,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And all the forms in which those spirits lay
734,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Were to her sight like the diaphanous
735,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array"
736,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us"
737,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565
738,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Move in the light of their own beauty thus.
739,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,"
740,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And little thought a Witch was looking on them.
741,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
742,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,66.
743,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"She, all those human figures breathing there,"
744,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570
745,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,"
746,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And often through a rude and worn disguise
747,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She saw the inner form most bright and fair--
748,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And then she had a charm of strange device,"
749,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575"
750,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Could make that spirit mingle with her own.
751,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
752,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,67.
753,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given"
754,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,For such a charm when Tithon became gray?
755,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven"
756,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580"
757,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven
758,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,"
759,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To any witch who would have taught you it?
760,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The Heliad doth not know its value yet.
761,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
762,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,68.
763,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585
764,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--"
765,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,But holy Dian could not chaster be
766,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,"
767,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Than now this lady--like a sexless bee
768,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590"
769,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden"
770,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.
771,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
772,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,69.
773,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"To those she saw most beautiful, she gave"
774,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--
775,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595"
776,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And lived thenceforward as if some control,"
777,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave"
778,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,"
779,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Was as a green and overarching bower
780,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600
781,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
782,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,70.
783,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"For on the night when they were buried, she"
784,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook"
785,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The light out of the funeral lamps, to be"
786,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A mimic day within that deathy nook;
787,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605
788,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took"
789,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,"
790,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And threw it with contempt into a ditch.
791,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
792,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,71.
793,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And there the body lay, age after age."
794,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610"
795,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Like one asleep in a green hermitage,"
796,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,"
797,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And living in its dreams beyond the rage
798,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of death or life; while they were still arraying
799,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615"
800,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And fleeting generations of mankind.
801,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
802,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,72.
803,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And she would write strange dreams upon the brain
804,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of those who were less beautiful, and make"
805,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,All harsh and crooked purposes more vain
806,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620
807,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Which the sand covers--all his evil gain
808,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The miser in such dreams would rise and shake
809,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe
810,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Would his own lies betray without a bribe.
811,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
812,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,73.
813,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625"
814,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,"
815,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"How the God Apis really was a bull,"
816,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And nothing more; and bid the herald stick
817,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The same against the temple doors, and pull"
818,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630
819,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,"
820,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,By pastoral letters to each diocese.
821,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
822,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,74.
823,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The king would dress an ape up in his crown
824,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,"
825,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635
826,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat
827,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one
828,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet
829,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,"
830,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!                     _640"
831,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
832,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,75.
833,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and"
834,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;
835,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Round the red anvils you might see them stand
836,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,"
837,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Beating their swords to ploughshares;--in a band              _645
838,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The gaolers sent those of the liberal schism
839,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Free through the streets of Memphis, much, I wis,"
840,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To the annoyance of king Amasis.
841,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
842,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,76.
843,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And timid lovers who had been so coy,"
844,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"They hardly knew whether they loved or not,                   _650"
845,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,"
846,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;
847,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And when next day the maiden and the boy
848,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Met one another, both, like sinners caught,"
849,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Blushed at the thing which each believed was done             _655
850,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Only in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;
851,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
852,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,77.
853,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And then the Witch would let them take no ill:
854,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,"
855,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill"
856,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.                       _660
857,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,"
858,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Were torn apart--a wide wound, mind from mind!--"
859,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,She did unite again with visions clear
860,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Of deep affection and of truth sincere.
861,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
862,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,80.
863,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,These were the pranks she played among the cities             _665

867,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,I will declare another time; for it is
868,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   _670
