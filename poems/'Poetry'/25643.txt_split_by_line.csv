50,THE SLEEP,THE SLEEP
51,THE SLEEP,
52,THE SLEEP,OF all the thoughts of God that are
53,THE SLEEP,"Borne inward unto souls afar,"
54,THE SLEEP,"Along the Psalmist's music deep,"
55,THE SLEEP,"Now tell me if that any is,"
56,THE SLEEP,"For gift or grace, surpassing this--"
57,THE SLEEP,"'He giveth His beloved, sleep'!"
58,THE SLEEP,
59,THE SLEEP,What would we give to our beloved?
60,THE SLEEP,"The hero's heart to be unmoved,"
61,THE SLEEP,"The poet's star-tuned harp, to sweep,"
62,THE SLEEP,"The patriot's voice, to teach and rouse,"
63,THE SLEEP,"The monarch's crown, to light the brows?"
64,THE SLEEP,'He giveth His beloved sleep.'
65,THE SLEEP,
66,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Along the Psalmist's music deep]
67,THE SLEEP,
68,THE SLEEP,What do we give to our beloved?
69,THE SLEEP,"A little faith all undisproved,"
70,THE SLEEP,"A little dust to overweep,"
71,THE SLEEP,And bitter memories to make
72,THE SLEEP,The whole earth blasted for our sake.
73,THE SLEEP,He giveth His beloved sleep.

75,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: A little dust to overweep]
76,THE SLEEP,
77,THE SLEEP,"""Sleep soft, beloved!"" we sometimes say,"
78,THE SLEEP,But have no tune to charm away
79,THE SLEEP,Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep.
80,THE SLEEP,But never doleful dream again
81,THE SLEEP,Shall break the happy slumber when
82,THE SLEEP,He giveth His beloved sleep.
83,THE SLEEP,
84,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep
85,THE SLEEP,But never doleful dream agains
86,THE SLEEP,Shall break the happy slumber]
87,THE SLEEP,
88,THE SLEEP,"O earth, so full of dreary noises!"
89,THE SLEEP,"O men, with wailing in your voices!"
90,THE SLEEP,"O delv√®d gold, the wailers heap!"
91,THE SLEEP,"O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall!"
92,THE SLEEP,"God strikes a silence through you all,"
93,THE SLEEP,He giveth His beloved sleep.
94,THE SLEEP,
95,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Oh men with wailing in your voices]
96,THE SLEEP,
97,THE SLEEP,His dews drop mutely on the hill;
98,THE SLEEP,"His cloud above it saileth still,"
99,THE SLEEP,Though on its slope men sow and reap.
100,THE SLEEP,"More softly than the dew is shed,"
101,THE SLEEP,"Or cloud is floated overhead,"
102,THE SLEEP,He giveth His beloved sleep.
103,THE SLEEP,
104,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Though on its slope men sow and reap]
105,THE SLEEP,
106,THE SLEEP,"Ay, men may wonder while they scan"
107,THE SLEEP,"A living, thinking, feeling man,"
108,THE SLEEP,Confirmed in such a rest to keep;
109,THE SLEEP,"But angels say, and through the word"
110,THE SLEEP,"I think their happy smile is _heard_,--"
111,THE SLEEP,'He giveth His beloved sleep.'
112,THE SLEEP,
113,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: And through the word
114,THE SLEEP,I think their happy smile is heard]
115,THE SLEEP,
116,THE SLEEP,"For me, my heart that erst did go"
117,THE SLEEP,"Most like a tired child at a show,"
118,THE SLEEP,"That sees through tears the mummers leap,"
119,THE SLEEP,"Would now its wearied vision close,"
120,THE SLEEP,"Would childlike on His love repose,"
121,THE SLEEP,Who giveth His beloved sleep.
122,THE SLEEP,
123,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Like a tired child at a show]
124,THE SLEEP,
125,THE SLEEP,"And, friends, dear friends,--when it shall be"
126,THE SLEEP,"That this low breath is gone from me,"
127,THE SLEEP,"And round my bier ye come to weep,"
128,THE SLEEP,"Let one, most loving of you all,"
129,THE SLEEP,"Say, ""Not a tear must o'er her fall--"
130,THE SLEEP,"'He giveth His beloved sleep.'"""
