337,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"The Geraldine tossed on his bed that night,"
338,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And never asleep went he
339,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"For the crowing of his little red cock,"
340,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,That did crow most woefully.
341,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
342,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"For the howling of his own wolf-hound,"
343,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,That cried at the gate all night.
344,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,He rose and went to the banquet hall
345,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,At the first of morning light.
346,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
347,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He looked to the right, he looked to the left,"
348,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,At the rug where the dog lay on;
349,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"But the reindeer skin was burnt in two,"
350,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And the little black hound was gone.
351,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
352,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And, traced in the ashes, these words he read:"
353,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""For the soul of your firstborn son,"
354,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,I will make you rich as you once were rich
355,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Ere the glass of your luck was run."""
356,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
357,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"The Geraldine went to the west window,"
358,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And then he went to the east,"
359,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And saw his desolate pasture fields,"
360,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And the stables without a beast.
361,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
362,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""So be it, as I love no woman,"
363,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,No son shall ever be mine;
364,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"I would that my stables were full of steeds,"
365,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And my cellars were full of wine."""
366,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
367,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""I swear it, as I love no woman,"
368,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And never a son have I,"
369,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,I would that my sheep and their little lambs
370,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Should flourish and multiply.
371,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
372,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""So yours be the soul of my firstborn son."""
373,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Here the Geraldine slyly smiled,"
374,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,But from the dark of the lonely room
375,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Came the cry of a little child.
376,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
377,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"The Geraldine went to the west window,"
378,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He opened, and out did lean,"
379,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And lo! the pastures were full of kine,"
380,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,All chewing the grass so green.
381,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
382,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And quickly he went to the east window,"
383,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And his face was pale to see,"
384,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,For lo! he saw to the empty stalls
385,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Brave steeds go three by three.
386,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
387,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"The Geraldine went to the great hall door,"
388,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"In wonder at what had been,"
389,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And there he saw the prettiest maid
390,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,That ever his eyes had seen.
391,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
392,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And long he looked at the pretty young maid,"
393,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And swore there was none so fair;
394,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And his heart went out of him like a hound,"
395,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And hers like a timid hare.
396,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
397,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Each day he followed her up and down,"
398,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And each night he could not rest,"
399,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Until at last the pretty young maid
400,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Her love for him confessed.
401,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
402,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"They wooed and they wed, and the days went by"
403,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"As quick as such good days will,"
404,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And at last came the cry of his firstborn son
405,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,The cup of his joy to fill.
406,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
407,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And the summer passed, and the winter came;"
408,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Right fair was the child to see,"
409,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And he laughed at the shriek of a bitter storm
410,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,As he sat on his father's knee.
411,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
412,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Who rings so loud at the Geraldine's gate?
413,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Who knocks so loud at the door?
414,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""Now rise you up, my pretty young wife,"
415,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"For twice they have knocked before."""
416,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
417,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Quickly she opened the great hall door,"
418,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And ""Welcome you in,"" she cried,"
419,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"But there only entered a little black hound,"
420,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And he would not be denied.
421,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
422,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"When the Geraldine saw the little black dog,"
423,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He rose with a fearful cry,"
424,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"""I sold my child to the Devil's hound"
425,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"In forgotten days gone by."""
426,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
427,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He drew his sword on the little black hound,"
428,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"But it would not pierce its skin,"
429,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He tried to pray, but his lips were dumb"
430,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Because of his grievous sin.
431,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
432,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Then the fair young wife took the black hound's throat
433,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Both her small white hands between.
434,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,And he thought he saw one of God's angels
435,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Where his sweet young wife had been.
436,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
437,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Then he thought he saw from God's spirit
438,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"The hound go sore oppressed,"
439,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,But he woke to find his own dead wife
440,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,With her dead child on her breast.
441,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
442,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"Quickly he went to the west window,"
443,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Quickly he went to the east;
444,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"No help in the desolate pasture fields,"
445,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Or the stables that held no beast.
446,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,
447,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"He flung himself at his white wife's side,"
448,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,"And the dead lips moved and smiled,"
449,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,Then came somewhere from the lonely room
450,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,The laugh of a little child.
451,THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND,

1575,A VAGRANT HEART,"As she rises with the billows, nor shakes her dripping sail."
1576,A VAGRANT HEART,There is danger on the waters--there is joy where dangers be--
1577,A VAGRANT HEART,Alas! to be a woman and the nomad's heart in me.
1578,A VAGRANT HEART,
1579,A VAGRANT HEART,"Ochone! to be a woman, only sighing on the shore--"
1580,A VAGRANT HEART,"With a soul that finds a passion for each long breaker's roar,"
1581,A VAGRANT HEART,With a heart that beats as restless as all the winds that blow--
1582,A VAGRANT HEART,"Thrust a cloth between her fingers, and tell her she must sew;"
1583,A VAGRANT HEART,"Must join in empty chatter, and calculate with straws--"
1584,A VAGRANT HEART,For the weighing of our neighbour--for the sake of social laws.
1585,A VAGRANT HEART,"O chatter, chatter, chatter, when to speak is misery,"
1586,A VAGRANT HEART,When silence lies around your heart--and night is on the sea.
1587,A VAGRANT HEART,"So tired of little fashions that are root of all our strife,"
1588,A VAGRANT HEART,Of all the petty passions that upset the calm of life.
1589,A VAGRANT HEART,The law of God upon the land shines steady for all time;
1590,A VAGRANT HEART,"The laws confused that man has made, have reason not nor rhyme."
1591,A VAGRANT HEART,
1592,A VAGRANT HEART,"O bird that fights the heavens, and is blown beyond the shore,"
1593,A VAGRANT HEART,Would you leave your flight and danger for a cage to fight no more?
1594,A VAGRANT HEART,"No more the cold of winter, or the hunger of the snow,"
1595,A VAGRANT HEART,Nor the winds that blow you backward from the path you wish to go?
1596,A VAGRANT HEART,Would you leave your world of passion for a home that knows no riot?
1597,A VAGRANT HEART,Would I change my vagrant longings for a heart more full of quiet?
1598,A VAGRANT HEART,"No!--for all its dangers, there is joy in danger too:"
1599,A VAGRANT HEART,"On, bird, and fight your tempests, and this nomad heart with you!"
1600,A VAGRANT HEART,
1601,A VAGRANT HEART,"The seas that shake and thunder will close our mouths one day,"
1602,A VAGRANT HEART,The storms that shriek and whistle will blow our breaths away.
1603,A VAGRANT HEART,The dust that flies and whitens will mark not where we trod.
1604,A VAGRANT HEART,What matters then our judging? we are face to face with God.

1899,A LITTLE DOG,"All the great things that be,"
1900,A LITTLE DOG,"Man's pain and pleasure even,"
1901,A LITTLE DOG,I said though hard this weighing
1902,A LITTLE DOG,Of pains and tears and praying
1903,A LITTLE DOG,He will reward most just.
1904,A LITTLE DOG,
1905,A LITTLE DOG,"I said your bitter weeping man or maid,"

1911,A LITTLE DOG,Live for the great to-morrow.
1912,A LITTLE DOG,There passed me on the road
1913,A LITTLE DOG,
1914,A LITTLE DOG,"A little dog with hungry eyes, and sad"
1915,A LITTLE DOG,"Thin flesh all shivering,"
1916,A LITTLE DOG,"All sore and quivering,"
1917,A LITTLE DOG,Whining beneath the fell disease he had.
1918,A LITTLE DOG,I hurried home and praised God as before
1919,A LITTLE DOG,For thus affording
1920,A LITTLE DOG,"To man rewarding,"
1921,A LITTLE DOG,The dog was whining outside my door.
1922,A LITTLE DOG,
1923,A LITTLE DOG,"I flung it wide, and said, Come enter in,"

1933,A LITTLE DOG,Hurled into being
1934,A LITTLE DOG,Without hope of freeing

1940,A LITTLE DOG,

1964,A LITTLE DOG,"Which is His bidding,"
1965,A LITTLE DOG,Nor blame for ridding

2016,DISTANT VOICES,I left my home for travelling;
2017,DISTANT VOICES,Because I heard the strange birds sing
2018,DISTANT VOICES,"In foreign skies, and felt their wing"
2019,DISTANT VOICES,
2020,DISTANT VOICES,Brush past my soul impatiently;
2021,DISTANT VOICES,I saw the bloom on flower and tree
2022,DISTANT VOICES,That only grows beyond the sea.
2023,DISTANT VOICES,
2024,DISTANT VOICES,Methought the distant voices spake
2025,DISTANT VOICES,More wisdom than near tongues can make;
2026,DISTANT VOICES,I followed--lest my heart should break.
2027,DISTANT VOICES,
2028,DISTANT VOICES,And what is past is past and done.
2029,DISTANT VOICES,"I dreamt, and here the dream begun:"
2030,DISTANT VOICES,I saw a salmon in the sun

2032,DISTANT VOICES,Leap from the river to the shore--
2033,DISTANT VOICES,"Ah! strange mishap, so wounded sore,"
2034,DISTANT VOICES,To his sweet stream to turn no more.
2035,DISTANT VOICES,
2036,DISTANT VOICES,"A bird from 'neath his mother's breast,"
2037,DISTANT VOICES,Spread his weak wings in vain request;
2038,DISTANT VOICES,Never again to reach his nest.
2039,DISTANT VOICES,
2040,DISTANT VOICES,I saw a blossom bloom too soon
2041,DISTANT VOICES,Upon a summer's afternoon;
2042,DISTANT VOICES,'Twill breathe no more beneath the moon.
2043,DISTANT VOICES,
2044,DISTANT VOICES,"I woke, warmed 'neath a foreign sky"
2045,DISTANT VOICES,"Where locust blossoms bud and die,"
2046,DISTANT VOICES,Strange birds called to me flashing by.
2047,DISTANT VOICES,
2048,DISTANT VOICES,And dusky faces passed and woke
2049,DISTANT VOICES,The echoes with the words they spoke--
2050,DISTANT VOICES,--The same old tales as other folk.
2051,DISTANT VOICES,
2052,DISTANT VOICES,A truce to roaming!  Never more
2053,DISTANT VOICES,I'll leave the home I loved of yore.
2054,DISTANT VOICES,But strangers meet me at the door.

2293,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,'Neath the horrible countless eyes that you could not withstand?
2294,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"Or was it God looked from his throne in a moment's disdain,"

2308,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"Of the scented flowers, or lilt of a bird's gay tune."
2309,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"No sea there, or no cool of a wind's fresh breath,"

2311,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,
2312,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,Was there no life there that man's brain could understand?
2313,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"No past, no future, hopes to come, in that strange land?"
2314,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"No human love, no sleep, no day, no night,"
2315,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,But ever eternal living in eternal light?
2316,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,
2317,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"Perhaps the soul thus springing to fill its grave,"
2318,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,Found all the peace and happiness that it could crave;
2319,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,All it had lost alone was that poor body's part
2320,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,Which naught but grey corruption saw for its chart.
2321,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,
2322,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,Ah well! for us there ended all one man's life with this--
2323,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"A shot, a cry, a struggle, and a fainting woman's kiss;"
2324,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"Life's blood let 'mid the grasses--and all a world was lost,"
2325,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,And no one may ever know how he paid the cost.
2326,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,
2327,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"He is lost in the crowd of the dead, in the night-time of death,"
2328,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,A name on a stone left to tell that he ever drew breath.
2329,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,"So desperate body die there, with your soul's long release,"
2330,THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE,And unhappy spirit God grant you Eternity's peace!
