200,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"Under the breath of laughter, deep in the tide of tears,"
201,THE LOOM OF YEARS,I hear the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years.
202,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
203,THE LOOM OF YEARS,The leaves of the winter wither and sink in the forest mould
204,THE LOOM OF YEARS,To colour the flowers of April with purple and white and gold:
205,THE LOOM OF YEARS,Light and scent and music die and are born again
206,THE LOOM OF YEARS,In the heart of a grey-haired woman who wakes in a world of pain.
207,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
208,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"The hound, the fawn and the hawk, and the doves that croon and coo,"
209,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"We are all one woof of the weaving and the one warp threads us through,"
210,THE LOOM OF YEARS,One flying cloud on the shuttle that carries our hopes and fears
211,THE LOOM OF YEARS,As it goes thro' the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years.
212,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
213,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"The crosiers of the fern, and the crown, the crown of the rose,"

215,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"Pass and pass to the Timeless that never a moment mars,"
216,THE LOOM OF YEARS,Pass and pass to the Darkness that made the suns and stars.
217,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
218,THE LOOM OF YEARS,Has the soul gone out in the Darkness? Is the dust sealed from sight?
219,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"Ah, hush, for the woof of the ages returns thro' the warp of the night!"
220,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"Never that shuttle loses one thread of our hopes and fears,"
221,THE LOOM OF YEARS,As It comes thro' the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years.
222,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
223,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"O, woven in one wide Loom thro' the throbbing weft of the whole,"
224,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"One in spirit and flesh, one in body and soul,"
225,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"The leaf on the winds of autumn, the bird in its hour to die,"
226,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"The heart in its muffled anguish, the sea in its mournful cry,"
227,THE LOOM OF YEARS,
228,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"One with the flower of a day, one with the withered moon,"
229,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"One with the granite mountains that melt into the noon,"
230,THE LOOM OF YEARS,"One with the dream that triumphs beyond the light of the spheres,"

945,EMBARKATION,
946,EMBARKATION,"When the firelight, red and clear,"
947,EMBARKATION,"Flutters in the black wet pane,"
948,EMBARKATION,It is very good to hear
949,EMBARKATION,Howling winds and trotting rain:
950,EMBARKATION,"It is very good indeed,"
951,EMBARKATION,"When the nights are dark and cold,"
952,EMBARKATION,Near the friendly hearth to read
953,EMBARKATION,Tales of ghosts and buried gold.
954,EMBARKATION,
955,EMBARKATION,So with cozy toes and hands
956,EMBARKATION,"We were dreaming, just like you;"
957,EMBARKATION,Till we thought of palmy lands
958,EMBARKATION,Coloured like a cockatoo;
959,EMBARKATION,All in drowsy nursery nooks
960,EMBARKATION,"Near the clutching fire we sat,"
961,EMBARKATION,Searching quaint old story-books
962,EMBARKATION,Piled upon the furry mat.
963,EMBARKATION,
964,EMBARKATION,Something haunted us that night
965,EMBARKATION,Like a half-remembered name;
966,EMBARKATION,Worn old pages in that light
967,EMBARKATION,"Seemed the same, yet not the same:"
968,EMBARKATION,Curling in the pleasant heat
969,EMBARKATION,"Smoothly as a shell-shaped fan,"
970,EMBARKATION,"O, they breathed and smelt so sweet"
971,EMBARKATION,When we turned to Old Japan!
972,EMBARKATION,
973,EMBARKATION,Suddenly we thought we heard
974,EMBARKATION,"Someone tapping on the wall,"
975,EMBARKATION,"Tapping, tapping like a bird."
976,EMBARKATION,Then a panel seemed to fall
977,EMBARKATION,Quietly; and a tall thin man
978,EMBARKATION,"Stepped into the glimmering room,"
979,EMBARKATION,"And he held a little fan,"
980,EMBARKATION,And he waved it in the gloom.
981,EMBARKATION,
982,EMBARKATION,"Curious red, and golds, and greens"
983,EMBARKATION,"Danced before our startled eyes,"
984,EMBARKATION,"Birds from painted Indian screens,"
985,EMBARKATION,"Beads, and shells, and dragon-flies;"
986,EMBARKATION,"Wings, and flowers, and scent, and flame,"
987,EMBARKATION,Fans and fish and heliotrope;
988,EMBARKATION,Till the magic air became
989,EMBARKATION,Like a dream kaleidoscope.
990,EMBARKATION,
991,EMBARKATION,Then he told us of a land
992,EMBARKATION,Far across a fairy sea;
993,EMBARKATION,And he waved his thin white hand
994,EMBARKATION,"Like a flower, melodiously;"
995,EMBARKATION,While a red and blue macaw
996,EMBARKATION,"Perched upon his pointed head,"
997,EMBARKATION,"And as in a dream, we saw"
998,EMBARKATION,All the curious things he said.
999,EMBARKATION,
1000,EMBARKATION,"Tucked in tiny palanquins,"
1001,EMBARKATION,"Magically swinging there,"
1002,EMBARKATION,Flowery-kirtled mandarins
1003,EMBARKATION,Floated through the scented air;
1004,EMBARKATION,Wandering dogs and prowling cats
1005,EMBARKATION,Grinned at fish in painted lakes;
1006,EMBARKATION,Cross-legged conjurers on mats
1007,EMBARKATION,Fluted low to listening snakes.
1008,EMBARKATION,
1009,EMBARKATION,Fat black bonzes on the shore
1010,EMBARKATION,"Watched where singing, faint and far,"
1011,EMBARKATION,Boys in long blue garments bore
1012,EMBARKATION,Roses in a golden jar.
1013,EMBARKATION,While at carven dragon ships
1014,EMBARKATION,"Floating o'er that silent sea,"
1015,EMBARKATION,Squat-limbed gods with dreadful lips
1016,EMBARKATION,Leered and smiled mysteriously.
1017,EMBARKATION,
1018,EMBARKATION,"Like an idol, shrined alone,"
1019,EMBARKATION,"Watched by secret oval eyes,"
1020,EMBARKATION,Where the ruby wishing-stone
1021,EMBARKATION,"Smouldering in the darkness lies,"
1022,EMBARKATION,Anyone that wanted things
1023,EMBARKATION,Touched the jewel and they came;
1024,EMBARKATION,We were wealthier than kings
1025,EMBARKATION,Could we only do the same.
1026,EMBARKATION,
1027,EMBARKATION,Yes; we knew a hundred ways
1028,EMBARKATION,We might use it if we could;
1029,EMBARKATION,To be happy all our days
1030,EMBARKATION,As an Indian in a wood;
1031,EMBARKATION,"No more daily lesson task,"
1032,EMBARKATION,"No more sorrow, no more care;"
1033,EMBARKATION,So we thought that we would ask
1034,EMBARKATION,If he'd kindly lead us there.
1035,EMBARKATION,
1036,EMBARKATION,"Ah, but then he waved his fan,"
1037,EMBARKATION,Laughed and vanished through the wall;
1038,EMBARKATION,"Yet as in a dream, we ran"
1039,EMBARKATION,"Tumbling after, one and all;"
1040,EMBARKATION,"Never pausing once to think,"
1041,EMBARKATION,Panting after him we sped;
1042,EMBARKATION,Far away his robe of pink
1043,EMBARKATION,Floated backward as he fled.
1044,EMBARKATION,
1045,EMBARKATION,"Down a secret passage deep,"
1046,EMBARKATION,"Under roofs of spidery stairs,"
1047,EMBARKATION,"Where the bat-winged nightmares creep,"
1048,EMBARKATION,And a sheeted phantom glares
1049,EMBARKATION,"Rushed we; ah, how strange it was"
1050,EMBARKATION,Where no human watcher stood;
1051,EMBARKATION,Till we reached a gate of glass
1052,EMBARKATION,Opening on a flowery wood.
1053,EMBARKATION,
1054,EMBARKATION,"Where the rose-pink robe had flown,"
1055,EMBARKATION,"Borne by swifter feet than ours,"
1056,EMBARKATION,"On to Wonder-Wander town,"
1057,EMBARKATION,Through the wood of monstrous flowers;
1058,EMBARKATION,Mailed in monstrous gold and blue
1059,EMBARKATION,Dragon-flies like peacocks fled;
1060,EMBARKATION,"Butterflies like carpets, too,"
1061,EMBARKATION,Softly fluttered overhead.
1062,EMBARKATION,
1063,EMBARKATION,"Down the valley, tip-a-toe,"
1064,EMBARKATION,Where the broad-limbed giants lie
1065,EMBARKATION,"Snoring, as when long ago"
1066,EMBARKATION,Jack on a bean-stalk scaled the sky;
1067,EMBARKATION,On to Wonder-Wander town
1068,EMBARKATION,"Stole we past old dreams again,"
1069,EMBARKATION,"Castles long since battered down,"
1070,EMBARKATION,Dungeons of forgotten pain.
1071,EMBARKATION,
1072,EMBARKATION,"Noonday brooded on the wood,"
1073,EMBARKATION,Evening caught us ere we crept
1074,EMBARKATION,"Where a twisted pear-tree stood,"
1075,EMBARKATION,And a dwarf behind it slept;
1076,EMBARKATION,"Round his scraggy throat he wore,"
1077,EMBARKATION,"Knotted tight, a scarlet scarf;"
1078,EMBARKATION,"Timidly we watched him snore,"
1079,EMBARKATION,For he seemed a surly dwarf.
1080,EMBARKATION,
1081,EMBARKATION,"Yet, he looked so very small,"
1082,EMBARKATION,He could hardly hurt us much;
1083,EMBARKATION,"We were nearly twice as tall,"
1084,EMBARKATION,So we woke him with a touch
1085,EMBARKATION,"Gently, and in tones polite,"
1086,EMBARKATION,Asked him to direct our path;
1087,EMBARKATION,"O, his wrinkled eyes grew bright"
1088,EMBARKATION,Green with ugly gnomish wrath.
1089,EMBARKATION,
1090,EMBARKATION,"He seemed to choke,"
1091,EMBARKATION,"And gruffly spoke,"
1092,EMBARKATION,"""You're lost: deny it, if you can!"
1093,EMBARKATION,You want to know
1094,EMBARKATION,The way to go?
1095,EMBARKATION,There's no such place as Old Japan.
1096,EMBARKATION,
1097,EMBARKATION,"""You want to seek--"
1098,EMBARKATION,"No, no, don't speak!"
1099,EMBARKATION,You mean you want to steal a fan.
1100,EMBARKATION,You want to see
1101,EMBARKATION,The fields of tea?
1102,EMBARKATION,They don't grow tea in Old Japan.
1103,EMBARKATION,
1104,EMBARKATION,"""In China, well"
1105,EMBARKATION,Perhaps you'd smell
1106,EMBARKATION,The cherry bloom: that's if you ran
1107,EMBARKATION,A million miles
1108,EMBARKATION,"And jumped the stiles,"
1109,EMBARKATION,And never dreamed of Old Japan.
1110,EMBARKATION,
1111,EMBARKATION,"""What, palanquins,"
1112,EMBARKATION,And mandarins?
1113,EMBARKATION,"And, what d'you say, a blue divan?"
1114,EMBARKATION,And what? Hee! hee!
1115,EMBARKATION,You'll never see
1116,EMBARKATION,A pig-tailed head in Old Japan.
1117,EMBARKATION,
1118,EMBARKATION,"""You'd take away"
1119,EMBARKATION,"The ruby, hey?"
1120,EMBARKATION,I never heard of such a plan!
1121,EMBARKATION,Upon my word
1122,EMBARKATION,It's quite absurd
1123,EMBARKATION,There's not a gem in Old Japan!
1124,EMBARKATION,
1125,EMBARKATION,"""Oh, dear me, no!"
1126,EMBARKATION,You'd better go
1127,EMBARKATION,"Straight home again, my little man:"
1128,EMBARKATION,"Ah, well, you'll see"
1129,EMBARKATION,But don't blame me;
1130,EMBARKATION,"I don't believe in Old Japan."""
1131,EMBARKATION,
1132,EMBARKATION,"Then, before we could obey,"
1133,EMBARKATION,"O'er our startled heads he cast,"
1134,EMBARKATION,"Spider-like, a webby grey"
1135,EMBARKATION,Net that held us prisoned fast;
1136,EMBARKATION,"How we screamed, he only grinned,"
1137,EMBARKATION,It was such a lonely place;
1138,EMBARKATION,And he said we should be pinned
1139,EMBARKATION,Safely in his beetle-case.
1140,EMBARKATION,
1141,EMBARKATION,Out he dragged a monstrous box
1142,EMBARKATION,From a cave behind the tree!
1143,EMBARKATION,"It had four-and-twenty locks,"
1144,EMBARKATION,"But he could not find the key,"
1145,EMBARKATION,And his face grew very pale
1146,EMBARKATION,When a sudden voice began
1147,EMBARKATION,"Drawing nearer through the vale,"
1148,EMBARKATION,"Singing songs of Old Japan,"
1149,EMBARKATION,
1150,EMBARKATION,
1151,SONG,SONG
1152,SONG,
1153,SONG,_Satin sails in a crimson dawn
1154,SONG,Over the silky silver sea;
1155,SONG,Purple veils of the dark withdrawn;
1156,SONG,Heavens of pearl and porphyry;
1157,SONG,Purple and white in the morning light
1158,SONG,"Over the water the town we knew,"
1159,SONG,"In tiny state, like a willow-plate,"
1160,SONG,"Shone, and behind it the hills were blue._"
1161,SONG,
1162,SONG,"_There, we remembered, the shadows pass"
1163,SONG,All day long like dreams in the night;
1164,SONG,"There, in the meadows of dim blue grass,"
1165,SONG,Crimson daisies are ringed with white.
1166,SONG,"There the roses flutter their petals,"
1167,SONG,"Over the meadows they take their flight,"
1168,SONG,There the moth that sleepily settles
1169,SONG,Turns to a flower in the warm soft light._
1170,SONG,
1171,SONG,_There when the sunset colours the streets
1172,SONG,Everyone buys at wonderful stalls
1173,SONG,"Toys and chocolates, guns and sweets,"
1174,SONG,"Ivory pistols, and Persian shawls:"
1175,SONG,Everyone's pockets are crammed with gold;
1176,SONG,"Nobody's heart is worn with care,"
1177,SONG,"Nobody ever grows tired and old,"
1178,SONG,"And nobody calls you ""Baby"" there._"
1179,SONG,
1180,SONG,_There with a hat like a round white dish
1181,SONG,"Upside down on each pig-tailed head,"
1182,SONG,"Jugglers offer you snakes and fish,"
1183,SONG,Dreams and dragons and gingerbread;
1184,SONG,"Beautiful books with marvellous pictures,"
1185,SONG,"Painted pirates and streaming gore,"
1186,SONG,"And everyone reads, without any strictures,"
1187,SONG,Tales he remembers for evermore._
1188,SONG,
1189,SONG,_There when the dim blue daylight lingers
1190,SONG,"Listening, and the West grows holy,"
1191,SONG,Singers crouch with their long white fingers
1192,SONG,Floating over the zithern slowly:
1193,SONG,Paper lamps with a peachy bloom
1194,SONG,"Burn above on the dim blue bough,"
1195,SONG,While the zitherns gild the gloom
1196,SONG,With curious music! I hear it now!_
1197,SONG,
1198,SONG,_Now_: and at that mighty word
1199,SONG,"Holding out his magic fan,"
1200,SONG,"Through the waving flowers appeared,"
1201,SONG,"Suddenly, the tall thin man:"
1202,SONG,And we saw the crumpled dwarf
1203,SONG,"Trying to hide behind the tree,"
1204,SONG,But his knotted scarlet scarf
1205,SONG,Made him very plain to see.
1206,SONG,
1207,SONG,Like a soft and smoky cloud
1208,SONG,Passed the webby net away;
1209,SONG,While its owner squealing loud
1210,SONG,Down behind the pear-tree lay;
1211,SONG,"For the tall thin man came near,"
1212,SONG,"And his words were dark and gruff,"
1213,SONG,And he swung the dwarf in the air
1214,SONG,By his long and scraggy scruff.
1215,SONG,
1216,SONG,There he kickled whimpering.
1217,SONG,"But our rescuer touched the box,"
1218,SONG,Open with a sudden spring
1219,SONG,Clashed the four-and-twenty locks;
1220,SONG,"Then he crammed the dwarf inside,"
1221,SONG,And the locks all clattered tight:
1222,SONG,Four-and-twenty times he tried
1223,SONG,Whether they were fastened right.
1224,SONG,
1225,SONG,"Ah, he led us on our road,"
1226,SONG,Showed us Wonder-Wander town;
1227,SONG,Then he fled: behind him flowed
1228,SONG,Once again the rose-pink gown:
1229,SONG,"Down the long deserted street,"
1230,SONG,"All the windows winked like eyes,"
1231,SONG,And our little trotting feet
1232,SONG,Echoed to the starry skies.
1233,SONG,
1234,SONG,Low and long for evermore
1235,SONG,Where the Wonder-Wander sea
1236,SONG,Whispers to the wistful shore
1237,SONG,"Purple songs of mystery,"
1238,SONG,Down the shadowy quay we came--
1239,SONG,Though it hides behind the hill
1240,SONG,You will find it just the same
1241,SONG,And the seamen singing still.
1242,SONG,
1243,SONG,"There we chose a ship of pearl,"
1244,SONG,And her milky silken sail
1245,SONG,"Seemed by magic to unfurl,"
1246,SONG,Puffed before a fairy gale;
1247,SONG,"Shimmering o'er the purple deep,"
1248,SONG,"Out across the silvery bar,"
1249,SONG,Softly as the wings of sleep
1250,SONG,Sailed we towards the morning star.
1251,SONG,
1252,SONG,"Over us the skies were dark,"
1253,SONG,Yet we never needed light;
1254,SONG,Softly shone our tiny bark
1255,SONG,Gliding through the solemn night;
1256,SONG,"Softly bright our moony gleam,"
1257,SONG,"Glimmered o'er the glistening waves,"
1258,SONG,Like a cold sea-maiden's dream
1259,SONG,Globed in twilit ocean caves.
1260,SONG,
1261,SONG,So all night our shallop passed
1262,SONG,"Many a haunt of old desire,"
1263,SONG,Blurs of savage blossom massed
1264,SONG,Red above a pirate-fire;
1265,SONG,Huts that gloomed and glanced among
1266,SONG,Fruitage dipping in the blue;
1267,SONG,"Songs the sirens never sung,"
1268,SONG,Shores Ulysses never knew.
1269,SONG,
1270,SONG,All our fairy rigging shone
1271,SONG,Richly as a rainbow seen
1272,SONG,Where the moonlight floats upon
1273,SONG,Gossamers of gold and green:
1274,SONG,All the tiny spars were bright;
1275,SONG,Beaten gold the bowsprit was;
1276,SONG,"But our pilot was the night,"
1277,SONG,And our chart a looking-glass.

1282,THE ARRIVAL,THE ARRIVAL
1283,THE ARRIVAL,
1284,THE ARRIVAL,With rosy finger-tips the Dawn
1285,THE ARRIVAL,"Drew back the silver veils,"
1286,THE ARRIVAL,Till lilac shimmered into lawn
1287,THE ARRIVAL,Above the satin sails;
1288,THE ARRIVAL,"And o'er the waters, white and wan,"
1289,THE ARRIVAL,"In tiny patterned state,"
1290,THE ARRIVAL,We saw the streets of Old Japan
1291,THE ARRIVAL,"Shine, like a willow plate."
1292,THE ARRIVAL,
1293,THE ARRIVAL,"O, many a milk-white pigeon roams"
1294,THE ARRIVAL,"The purple cherry crops,"
1295,THE ARRIVAL,"The mottled miles of pearly domes,"
1296,THE ARRIVAL,"And blue pagoda tops,"
1297,THE ARRIVAL,The river with its golden canes
1298,THE ARRIVAL,"And dark piratic dhows,"
1299,THE ARRIVAL,To where beyond the twisting vanes
1300,THE ARRIVAL,The burning mountain glows.
1301,THE ARRIVAL,
1302,THE ARRIVAL,A snow-peak in the silver skies
1303,THE ARRIVAL,"Beyond that magic world,"
1304,THE ARRIVAL,We saw the great volcano rise
1305,THE ARRIVAL,"With incense o'er it curled,"
1306,THE ARRIVAL,Whose tiny thread of rose and blue
1307,THE ARRIVAL,"Has risen since time began,"
1308,THE ARRIVAL,Before the first enchanter knew
1309,THE ARRIVAL,The peak of Old Japan.
1310,THE ARRIVAL,
1311,THE ARRIVAL,Nobody watched us quietly steer
1312,THE ARRIVAL,"The pinnace to the painted pier,"
1313,THE ARRIVAL,"Except one pig-tailed mandarin,"
1314,THE ARRIVAL,Who sat upon a chest of tea
1315,THE ARRIVAL,Pretending not to hear or see!...
1316,THE ARRIVAL,"His hands were very long and thin,"
1317,THE ARRIVAL,His face was very broad and white;
1318,THE ARRIVAL,"And O, it was a fearful sight"
1319,THE ARRIVAL,To see him sit alone and grin!
1320,THE ARRIVAL,
1321,THE ARRIVAL,His grin was very sleek and sly:
1322,THE ARRIVAL,Timidly we passed him by.
1323,THE ARRIVAL,He did not seem at all to care:
1324,THE ARRIVAL,"So, thinking we were safely past,"
1325,THE ARRIVAL,We ventured to look back at last.
1326,THE ARRIVAL,"O, dreadful blank!--_He was not there!_"
1327,THE ARRIVAL,He must have hid behind his chest:
1328,THE ARRIVAL,We did not stay to see the rest.
1329,THE ARRIVAL,
1330,THE ARRIVAL,"But, as in reckless haste we ran,"
1331,THE ARRIVAL,"We came upon the tall thin man,"
1332,THE ARRIVAL,"Who called to us and waved his fan,"
1333,THE ARRIVAL,And offered us his palanquin:
1334,THE ARRIVAL,He said we must not go alone
1335,THE ARRIVAL,"To seek the ruby wishing-stone,"
1336,THE ARRIVAL,Because the white-faced mandarin
1337,THE ARRIVAL,"Would dog our steps for many a mile,"
1338,THE ARRIVAL,And sit upon each purple stile
1339,THE ARRIVAL,"Before we came to it, and smile"
1340,THE ARRIVAL,And smile; his name was Creeping Sin.
1341,THE ARRIVAL,
1342,THE ARRIVAL,"He played with children's beating hearts,"
1343,THE ARRIVAL,And stuck them full of poisoned darts
1344,THE ARRIVAL,And long green thorns that stabbed and stung:
1345,THE ARRIVAL,"He'd watch until we tried to speak,"
1346,THE ARRIVAL,Then thrust inside his pasty cheek
1347,THE ARRIVAL,"His long, white, slimy tongue:"
1348,THE ARRIVAL,And smile at everything we said;
1349,THE ARRIVAL,"And sometimes pat us on the head,"
1350,THE ARRIVAL,And say that we were very young:
1351,THE ARRIVAL,He was a cousin of the man
1352,THE ARRIVAL,Who said that there was no Japan.
1353,THE ARRIVAL,
1354,THE ARRIVAL,And night and day this Creeping Sin
1355,THE ARRIVAL,Would follow the path of the palanquin;
1356,THE ARRIVAL,Yet if we still were fain to touch
1357,THE ARRIVAL,"The ruby, we must have no fear,"
1358,THE ARRIVAL,"Whatever we might see or hear,"
1359,THE ARRIVAL,And the tall thin man would take us there;
1360,THE ARRIVAL,"He did not fear that Sly One much,"
1361,THE ARRIVAL,"Except perhaps on a moonless night,"
1362,THE ARRIVAL,Nor even then if the stars were bright.
1363,THE ARRIVAL,
1364,THE ARRIVAL,"So, in the yellow palankeen"
1365,THE ARRIVAL,We swung along in state between
1366,THE ARRIVAL,Twinkling domes of gold and green
1367,THE ARRIVAL,"Through the rich bazaar,"
1368,THE ARRIVAL,"Where the cross-legged merchants sat,"
1369,THE ARRIVAL,"Old and almond-eyed and fat,"
1370,THE ARRIVAL,"Each upon a gorgeous mat,"
1371,THE ARRIVAL,Each in a cymar;
1372,THE ARRIVAL,"Each in crimson samite breeches,"
1373,THE ARRIVAL,Watching his barbaric riches.
1374,THE ARRIVAL,
1375,THE ARRIVAL,Cherry blossom breathing sweet
1376,THE ARRIVAL,Whispered o'er the dim blue street
1377,THE ARRIVAL,Where with fierce uncertain feet
1378,THE ARRIVAL,Tawny pirates walk:
1379,THE ARRIVAL,"All in belts and baggy blouses,"
1380,THE ARRIVAL,"Out of dreadful opium houses,"
1381,THE ARRIVAL,"Out of dens where Death carouses,"
1382,THE ARRIVAL,Horribly they stalk;
1383,THE ARRIVAL,"Girt with ataghan and dagger,"
1384,THE ARRIVAL,Right across the road they swagger.
1385,THE ARRIVAL,
1386,THE ARRIVAL,"And where the cherry orchards blow,"
1387,THE ARRIVAL,"We saw the maids of Miyako,"
1388,THE ARRIVAL,Swaying softly to and fro
1389,THE ARRIVAL,Through the dimness of the dance:
1390,THE ARRIVAL,Like sweet thoughts that shine through dreams
1391,THE ARRIVAL,"They glided, wreathing rosy gleams,"
1392,THE ARRIVAL,"With stately sounds of silken streams,"
1393,THE ARRIVAL,And many a slim kohl-lidded glance;
1394,THE ARRIVAL,Then fluttered with tiny rose-bud feet
1395,THE ARRIVAL,To a soft _frou-frou_ and a rhythmic beat
1396,THE ARRIVAL,"As the music shimmered, pursuit, retreat,"
1397,THE ARRIVAL,"""Hands across, retire, advance!"""
1398,THE ARRIVAL,And again it changed and the glimmering throng
1399,THE ARRIVAL,Faded into a distant song.
1400,THE ARRIVAL,
1401,THE ARRIVAL,
1402,SONG,SONG
1403,SONG,
1404,SONG,_The maidens of Miyako
1405,SONG,"Dance in the sunset hours,"
1406,SONG,"Deep in the sunset glow,"
1407,SONG,Under the cherry flowers._
1408,SONG,
1409,SONG,_With dreamy hands of pearl
1410,SONG,"Floating like butterflies,"
1411,SONG,Dimly the dancers whirl
1412,SONG,As the rose-light dies;_
1413,SONG,
1414,SONG,"_And their floating gowns, their hair"
1415,SONG,"Upbound with curious pins,"
1416,SONG,Fade thro' the darkening air
1417,SONG,With the dancing mandarins._
1418,SONG,
1419,SONG,"And then, as we went, the tall thin man"
1420,SONG,Explained the manners of Old Japan;
1421,SONG,"If you pitied a thing, you pretended to sneer;"
1422,SONG,Yet if you were glad you ran to buy
1423,SONG,A captive pigeon and let it fly;
1424,SONG,"And, if you were sad, you took a spear"
1425,SONG,"To wound yourself, for fear your pain"
1426,SONG,Should quietly grow less again.
1427,SONG,
1428,SONG,"And, again he said, if we wished to find"
1429,SONG,The mystic City that enshrined
1430,SONG,"The stone so few on earth had found,"
1431,SONG,We must be very brave; it lay
1432,SONG,"A hundred haunted leagues away,"
1433,SONG,"Past many a griffon-guarded ground,"
1434,SONG,"In depths of dark and curious art,"
1435,SONG,Where passion-flowers enfold apart
1436,SONG,"The Temple of the Flaming Heart,"
1437,SONG,The City of the Secret Wound.
1438,SONG,
1439,SONG,About the fragrant fall of day
1440,SONG,We saw beside the twisted way
1441,SONG,"A blue-domed tea-house, bossed with gold;"
1442,SONG,"Hungry and thirsty we entered in,"
1443,SONG,How should we know what Creeping Sin
1444,SONG,Had breathed in that Emperor's ear who sold
1445,SONG,His own dumb soul for an evil jewel
1446,SONG,"To the earth-gods, blind and ugly and cruel?"
1447,SONG,"We drank sweet tea as his tale was told,"
1448,SONG,"In a garden of blue chrysanthemums,"
1449,SONG,While a drowsy swarming of gongs and drums
1450,SONG,Out of the sunset dreamily rolled.
1451,SONG,
1452,SONG,"But, as the murmur nearer drew,"
1453,SONG,"A fat black bonze, in a robe of blue,"
1454,SONG,Suddenly at the gate appeared;
1455,SONG,"And close behind, with that evil grin,"
1456,SONG,"_Was it Creeping Sin, was it Creeping Sin?_"
1457,SONG,The bonze looked quietly down and sneered.
1458,SONG,Our guide! Was he sleeping? We could not wake him.
1459,SONG,However we tried to pinch and shake him!
1460,SONG,
1461,SONG,"Nearer, nearer the tumult came,"
1462,SONG,"Till, as a glare of sound and flame,"
1463,SONG,Blind from a terrible furnace door
1464,SONG,"Blares, or the mouth of a dragon, blazed"
1465,SONG,The seething gateway: deaf and dazed
1466,SONG,With the clanging and the wild uproar
1467,SONG,We stood; while a thousand oval eyes
1468,SONG,Gapped our fear with a sick surmise.
1469,SONG,
1470,SONG,"Then, as the dead sea parted asunder,"
1471,SONG,The clamour clove with a sound of thunder
1472,SONG,In two great billows; and all was quiet.
1473,SONG,Gaunt and black was the palankeen
1474,SONG,That came in dreadful state between
1475,SONG,The frozen waves of the wild-eyed riot
1476,SONG,Curling back from the breathless track
1477,SONG,Of the Nameless One who is never seen:
1478,SONG,The close drawn curtains were thick and black;
1479,SONG,But wizen and white was the tall thin man
1480,SONG,As he rose in his sleep:
1481,SONG,"His eyes were closed, his lips were wan,"
1482,SONG,He crouched like a leopard that dares not leap.
1483,SONG,
1484,SONG,"The bearers halted: the tall thin man,"
1485,SONG,"Fearfully dreaming, waved his fan,"
1486,SONG,"With wizard fingers, to and fro;"
1487,SONG,"While, with a whimper of evil glee,"
1488,SONG,The Nameless Emperor's mad Moonshee
1489,SONG,Stepped in front of us: dark and slow
1490,SONG,Were the words of the doom that he dared not name;
1491,SONG,"But, over the ground, as he spoke there came"
1492,SONG,Tiny circles of soft blue flame;
1493,SONG,"Like ghosts of flowers they began to glow,"
1494,SONG,And flow like a moonlit brook between
1495,SONG,Our feet and the terrible palankeen.
1496,SONG,
1497,SONG,"But the Moonshee wrinkled his long thin eyes,"
1498,SONG,"And sneered, ""Have you stolen the strength of the skies?"
1499,SONG,Then pour before us a stream of pearl!
1500,SONG,"Give us the pearl and the gold we know,"
1501,SONG,And our hearts will be softened and let you go;
1502,SONG,But these are toys for a foolish girl--
1503,SONG,These vanishing blossoms--what are they worth?
1504,SONG,They are not so heavy as dust and earth:
1505,SONG,"Pour before us a stream of pearl!"""
1506,SONG,
1507,SONG,"Then, with a wild strange laugh, our guide"
1508,SONG,Stretched his arms to the West and cried
1509,SONG,"Once, and a song came over the sea;"
1510,SONG,And all the blossoms of moon-soft fire
1511,SONG,"Woke and breathed as a wind-swept lyre,"
1512,SONG,And the garden surged into harmony;
1513,SONG,"Till it seemed that the soul of the whole world sung,"
1514,SONG,And every petal became a tongue
1515,SONG,To tell the thoughts of Eternity.
1516,SONG,
1517,SONG,But the Moonshee lifted his painted brows
1518,SONG,And stared at the gold on the blue tea-house:
1519,SONG,"""Can you clothe your body with dreams?"" he sneered;"
1520,SONG,"""If you taught us the truths that we always know"
1521,SONG,Our heart might be softened and let you go:
1522,SONG,"Can you tell us the length of a monkey's beard,"
1523,SONG,"Or the weight of the gems on the Emperor's fan,"
1524,SONG,"Or the number of parrots in Old Japan?"""
1525,SONG,
1526,SONG,"And again, with a wild strange laugh, our guide"
1527,SONG,"Looked at him; and he shrunk aside,"
1528,SONG,Shrivelling like a flame-touched leaf;
1529,SONG,For the red-cross blossoms of soft blue fire
1530,SONG,"Were growing and fluttering higher and higher,"
1531,SONG,"Shaking their petals out, sheaf by sheaf,"
1532,SONG,Till with disks like shields and stems like towers
1533,SONG,Burned the host of the passion-flowers
1534,SONG,... Had the Moonshee flown like a midnight thief?
1535,SONG,"... Yet a thing like a monkey, shrivelled and black,"
1536,SONG,Chattered and danced as they forced him back.
1537,SONG,
1538,SONG,"As the coward chatters for empty pride,"
1539,SONG,"In the face of a foe that he cannot but fear,"
1540,SONG,"It chattered and leapt from side to side,"
1541,SONG,And its voice rang strangely upon the ear.
1542,SONG,As the cry of a wizard that dares not own
1543,SONG,Another's brighter and mightier throne;
1544,SONG,As the wrath of a fool that rails aloud
1545,SONG,On the fire that burnt him; the brazen bray
1546,SONG,"Clamoured and sang o'er the gaping crowd,"
1547,SONG,And flapped like a gabbling goose away.
1548,SONG,
1549,SONG,
1550,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE
1551,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1552,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"_If the blossoms were beans,"
1553,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,I should know what it means--
1554,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"This blaze, which I certainly cannot endure;"
1555,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"It is evil, too,"
1556,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"For its colour is blue,"
1557,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the sense of the matter is quite obscure.
1558,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Celestial truth
1559,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,_Is the food of youth;
1560,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,But the music was dark as a moonless night.
1561,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The facts in the song
1562,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Were all of them wrong,_"
1563,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1564,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,_And there was not a single sum done right;
1565,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Tho' a metaphysician amongst the crowd,"
1566,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"In a voice that was notably deep and loud,"
1567,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Repeated, as fast as he was able,"
1568,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The whole of the multiplication table._
1569,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1570,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"So the cry flapped off as a wild goose flies,"
1571,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the stars came out in the trembling skies,"
1572,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And ever the mystic glory grew
1573,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"In the garden of blue chrysanthemums,"
1574,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Till there came a rumble of distant drums;
1575,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the multitude suddenly turned and flew.
1576,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,... A dead ape lay where their feet had been ...
1577,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And we called for the yellow palankeen,"
1578,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the flowers divided and let us through.
1579,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1580,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The black-barred moon was large and low
1581,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,When we came to the Forest of Ancient Woe;
1582,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And over our heads the stars were bright.
1583,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,But through the forest the path we travelled
1584,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Its phosphorescent aisle unravelled
1585,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,In one thin ribbon of dwindling light:
1586,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And twice and thrice on the fainting track
1587,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"We paused to listen. The moon grew black,"
1588,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But the coolies' faces glimmered white,"
1589,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,As the wild woods echoed in dreadful chorus
1590,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,A laugh that came horribly hopping o'er us
1591,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Like monstrous frogs thro' the murky night.
1592,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1593,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Then the tall thin man as we swung along
1594,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Sang us an old enchanted song
1595,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,That lightened our hearts of their fearful load.
1596,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But, e'en as the moonlit air grew sweet,"
1597,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,We heard the pad of stealthy feet
1598,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Dogging us down the thin white road;
1599,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the song grew weary again and harsh,"
1600,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the black trees dripped like the fringe of a marsh,"
1601,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And a laugh crept out like a shadowy toad;
1602,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And we knew it was neither ghoul nor djinn:
1603,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,_It was Creeping Sin! It was Creeping Sin!_
1604,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1605,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But we came to a bend, and the white moon glowed"
1606,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Like a gate at the end of the narrowing road
1607,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Far away; and on either hand,"
1608,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"As guards of a path to the heart's desire,"
1609,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The strange tall blossoms of soft blue fire
1610,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Stretched away thro' that unknown land,"
1611,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,League on league with their dwindling lane
1612,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Down to the large low moon; and again
1613,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"There shimmered around us that mystical strain,"
1614,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,In a tongue that it seemed we could understand.
1615,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1616,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
1617,SONG,SONG
1618,SONG,
1619,SONG,_Hold by right and rule by fear
1620,SONG,Till the slowly broadening sphere
1621,SONG,Melting through the skies above
1622,SONG,Merge into the sphere of love._
1623,SONG,
1624,SONG,_Hold by might until you find
1625,SONG,Might is powerless o'er the mind:
1626,SONG,"Hold by Truth until you see,"
1627,SONG,"Though they bow before the wind,"
1628,SONG,Its towers can mock at liberty._
1629,SONG,
1630,SONG,"_Time, the seneschal, is blind;"
1631,SONG,Time is blind: and what are we?
1632,SONG,"Captives of Infinity,"
1633,SONG,Claiming through Truth's prison bars
1634,SONG,Kinship with the wandering stars._
1635,SONG,
1636,SONG,"O, who could tell the wild weird sights"
1637,SONG,We saw in all the days and nights
1638,SONG,We travelled through those forests old.
1639,SONG,"We saw the griffons on white cliffs,"
1640,SONG,"Among fantastic hieroglyphs,"
1641,SONG,Guarding enormous heaps of gold:
1642,SONG,
1643,SONG,We saw the Ghastroi--curious men
1644,SONG,"Who dwell, like tigers, in a den,"
1645,SONG,And howl whene'er the moon is cold;
1646,SONG,They stripe themselves with red and black
1647,SONG,And ride upon the yellow Yak.
1648,SONG,
1649,SONG,Their dens are always ankle-deep
1650,SONG,"With twisted knives, and in their sleep"
1651,SONG,They often cut themselves; they say
1652,SONG,That if you wish to live in peace
1653,SONG,The surest way is not to cease
1654,SONG,Collecting knives; and never a day
1655,SONG,"Can pass, unless they buy a few;"
1656,SONG,And as their enemies buy them too
1657,SONG,"They all avert the impending fray,"
1658,SONG,And starve their children and their wives
1659,SONG,To buy the necessary knives.
1660,SONG,
1661,SONG,*   *   *   *
1662,SONG,
1663,SONG,The forest leapt with shadowy shapes
1664,SONG,As we came to the great black Tower of Apes:
1665,SONG,But we gave them purple figs and grapes
1666,SONG,In alabaster amphoras:
1667,SONG,We gave them curious kinds of fruit
1668,SONG,"With betel nuts and orris-root,"
1669,SONG,And then they let us pass:
1670,SONG,And when we reached the Tower of Snakes
1671,SONG,"We gave them soft white honey-cakes,"
1672,SONG,And warm sweet milk in bowls of brass:
1673,SONG,And on the hundredth eve we found
1674,SONG,The City of the Secret Wound.
1675,SONG,
1676,SONG,We saw the mystic blossoms blow
1677,SONG,"Round the City, far below;"
1678,SONG,Faintly in the sunset glow
1679,SONG,We saw the soft blue glory flow
1680,SONG,O'er many a golden garden gate:
1681,SONG,And o'er the tiny dark green seas
1682,SONG,"Of tamarisks and tulip-trees,"
1683,SONG,Domes like golden oranges
1684,SONG,Dream aloft elate.
1685,SONG,
1686,SONG,"And clearer, clearer as we went,"
1687,SONG,We heard from tower and battlement
1688,SONG,"A whisper, like a warning, sent"
1689,SONG,From watchers out of sight;
1690,SONG,"And clearer, brighter, as we drew"
1691,SONG,"Close to the walls, we saw the blue"
1692,SONG,Flashing of plumes where peacocks flew
1693,SONG,Thro' zones of pearly light.
1694,SONG,
1695,SONG,"On either side, a fat black bonze"
1696,SONG,"Guarded the gates of red-wrought bronze,"
1697,SONG,Blazoned with blue sea-dragons
1698,SONG,And mouths of yawning flame;
1699,SONG,"Down the road of dusty red,"
1700,SONG,"Though their brown feet ached and bled,"
1701,SONG,Our coolies went with joyful tread:
1702,SONG,Like living fans the gates outspread
1703,SONG,And opened as we came.

1708,THE MYSTIC RUBY,THE MYSTIC RUBY
1709,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1710,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The white moon dawned; the sunset died;
1711,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stars were trembling when we spied
1712,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The rose-red temple of our dreams:
1713,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Its lamp-lit gardens glimmered cool
1714,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With many an onyx-paven pool,"
1715,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Amid soft sounds of flowing streams;
1716,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where star-shine shimmered through the white
1717,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tall fountain-shafts of crystal light
1718,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In ever changing rainbow-gleams.
1719,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1720,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Priests in flowing yellow robes
1721,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Glided under rosy globes
1722,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Through the green pomegranate boughs
1723,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Moonbeams poured their coloured rain;
1724,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Roofs of sea-green porcelain
1725,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Jutted o'er the rose-red house;
1726,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Bells were hung beneath its eaves;
1727,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Every wind that stirred the leaves
1728,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tinkled as tired water does.
1729,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1730,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The temple had a low broad base
1731,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of black bright marble; all its face
1732,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Was marble bright in rosy bloom;
1733,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where two sea-green pillars rose
1734,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Deep in the flower-soft eave-shadows
1735,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"We saw, thro' richly sparkling gloom,"
1736,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Wrought in marvellous years of old
1737,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With bulls and peacocks bossed in gold,"
1738,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The doors of powdered lacquer loom.
1739,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1740,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Quietly then the tall thin man,"
1741,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Holding his turquoise-tinted fan,"
1742,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Alighted from the palanquin;
1743,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We followed: never painter dreamed
1744,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of how that dark rich temple gleamed
1745,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With gules of jewelled gloom within;
1746,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And as we wondered near the door
1747,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A priest came o'er the polished floor
1748,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In sandals of soft serpent-skin;
1749,THE MYSTIC RUBY,His mitre shimmered bright and blue
1750,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With pigeon's breast-plumes. When he knew
1751,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Our quest he stroked his broad white chin,"
1752,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And looked at us with slanting eyes
1753,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And smiled; then through his deep disguise
1754,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_We knew him! It was Creeping Sin!_
1755,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1756,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But cunningly he bowed his head
1757,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Down on his gilded breast and said
1758,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_Come_: and he led us through the dusk
1759,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of passages whose painted walls
1760,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Gleamed with dark old festivals;
1761,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Till where the gloom grew sweet with musk
1762,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And incense, through a door of amber"
1763,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We came into a high-arched chamber.
1764,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1765,THE MYSTIC RUBY,There on a throne of jasper sat
1766,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A monstrous idol, black and fat;"
1767,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Thick rose-oil dropped upon its head:
1768,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Drop by drop, heavy and sweet,"
1769,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Trickled down to its ebon feet
1770,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Whereon the blood of goats was shed,"
1771,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And smeared around its perfumed knees
1772,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In savage midnight mysteries.
1773,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1774,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It wore about its bulging waist
1775,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A belt of dark green bronze enchased
1776,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With big, soft, cloudy pearls; its wrists"
1777,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Were clasped about with moony gems
1778,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Gathered from dead kings' diadems;
1779,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Its throat was ringed with amethysts,"
1780,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And in its awful hand it held
1781,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A softly smouldering emerald.
1782,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1783,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Silkily murmured Creeping Sin,"
1784,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"""This is the stone you wished to win!"""
1785,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"""White Snake,"" replied the tall thin man,"
1786,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"""Show us the Ruby Stone, or I"
1787,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Will slay thee with my hands."" The sly"
1788,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Long eyelids of the priest began
1789,THE MYSTIC RUBY,To slant aside; and then once more
1790,THE MYSTIC RUBY,He led us through the fragrant door.
1791,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1792,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And now along the passage walls
1793,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Were painted hideous animals,"
1794,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With hooded eyes and cloven stings:
1795,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In the incense that like shadowy hair
1796,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Streamed over them they seemed to stir
1797,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Their craggy claws and crooked wings.
1798,THE MYSTIC RUBY,At last we saw strange moon-wreaths curl
1799,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Around a deep, soft porch of pearl."
1800,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1801,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, what enchanter wove in dreams"
1802,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That chapel wild with shadowy gleams
1803,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And prismy colours of the moon?
1804,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Shrined like a rainbow in a mist
1805,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Of flowers, the fretted amethyst"
1806,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Arches rose to a mystic tune;
1807,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And never mortal art inlaid
1808,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Those cloudy floors of sea-soft jade.
1809,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1810,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"There, in the midst, an idol rose"
1811,THE MYSTIC RUBY,White as the silent starlit snows
1812,THE MYSTIC RUBY,On lonely Himalayan heights:
1813,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Over its head the spikenard spilled
1814,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Down to its feet, with myrrh distilled"
1815,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"In distant, odorous Indian nights:"
1816,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It held before its ivory face
1817,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A flaming yellow chrysoprase.
1818,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1819,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, silkily murmured Creeping Sin,"
1820,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"""This is the stone you wished to win."""
1821,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But in his ear the tall thin man
1822,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"_Whispered with slow, strange lips_--we knew"
1823,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Not what, but Creeping Sin went blue"
1824,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With fear; again his eyes began
1825,THE MYSTIC RUBY,To slant aside; then through the porch
1826,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"He passed, and lit a tall, brown torch."
1827,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1828,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Down a corridor dark as death,"
1829,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With beating hearts and bated breath
1830,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We hurried; far away we heard
1831,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A dreadful hissing, fierce as fire"
1832,THE MYSTIC RUBY,When rain begins to quench a pyre;
1833,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where the smoky torch-light flared
1834,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Strange vermin beat their bat-like wings,"
1835,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the wet walls dropped with slimy things.
1836,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1837,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And darker, darker, wound the way,"
1838,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Beyond all gleams of night and day,"
1839,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And still that hideous hissing grew
1840,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Louder and louder on our ears,"
1841,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And tortured us with eyeless fears;
1842,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Then suddenly the gloom turned blue,"
1843,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And, in the wall, a rough rock cave"
1844,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Gaped, like a phosphorescent grave."
1845,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1846,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And from the purple mist within
1847,THE MYSTIC RUBY,There came a wild tumultuous din
1848,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of snakes that reared their heads and hissed
1849,THE MYSTIC RUBY,As if a witch's cauldron boiled;
1850,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"All round the door great serpents coiled,"
1851,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With eyes of glowing amethyst,"
1852,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Whose fierce blue flames began to slide
1853,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like shooting stars from side to side.
1854,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1855,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Ah! with a sickly gasping grin
1856,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And quivering eyelids, Creeping Sin"
1857,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Stole to the cave; but, suddenly,"
1858,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"As through its glimmering mouth he passed,"
1859,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The serpents flashed and gripped him fast:
1860,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"He wriggled and gave one awful cry,"
1861,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Then all at once the cave was cleared;
1862,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The snakes with their victim had disappeared.
1863,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1864,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And fearlessly the tall thin man
1865,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Opened his turquoise-tinted fan
1866,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And entered; and the mists grew bright,"
1867,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And we saw that the cave was a diamond hall
1868,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Lit with lamps for a festival.
1869,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A myriad globes of coloured light
1870,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Went gliding deep in its massy sides,"
1871,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like the shimmering moons in the glassy tides
1872,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where a sea-king's palace enchants the night.
1873,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1874,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Gliding and flowing, a glory and wonder,"
1875,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Through each other, and over, and under,"
1876,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The lucent orbs of green and gold,"
1877,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Bright with sorrow or soft with sleep,"
1878,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"In music through the glimmering deep,"
1879,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Over their secret axles rolled,"
1880,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And circled by the murmuring spheres
1881,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We saw in a frame of frozen tears
1882,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A mirror that made the blood run cold.
1883,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1884,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"For, when we came to it, we found"
1885,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It imaged everything around
1886,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Except the face that gazed in it;
1887,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where the mirrored face should be
1888,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A heart-shaped Ruby fierily
1889,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Smouldered; and round the frame was writ,"
1890,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"_Mystery: Time and Tide shall pass,"
1891,THE MYSTIC RUBY,I am the Wisdom Looking-Glass._
1892,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1893,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_This is the Ruby none can touch:
1894,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Many have loved it overmuch;
1895,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Its fathomless fires flutter and sigh,"
1896,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Being as images of the flame
1897,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That shall make earth and heaven the same
1898,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"When the fire of the end reddens the sky,"
1899,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the world consumes like a burning pall,"
1900,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Till where there is nothing, there is all._"
1901,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1902,THE MYSTIC RUBY,So we looked up at the tall thin man
1903,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And we saw that his face grew sad and wan:
1904,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tears were glistening in his eyes:
1905,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"At last, with a breaking sob, he bent"
1906,THE MYSTIC RUBY,His head upon his breast and went
1907,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Swiftly away! With dreadful cries
1908,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We rushed to the softly glimmering door
1909,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stared at the hideous corridor.
1910,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But his robe was gone as a dream that flies:
1911,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Back to the glass in terror we came,"
1912,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stared at the writing round the frame.
1913,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1914,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We could not understand one word:
1915,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And suddenly we thought we heard
1916,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The hissing of the snakes again:
1917,THE MYSTIC RUBY,How could we front them all alone?
1918,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, madly we clutched at the mirrored stone"
1919,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And wished we were back on the flowery plain:
1920,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And swifter than thought and swift as fear
1921,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The whole world flashed, and behold we were there."
1922,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1923,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Yes; there was the port of Old Japan,"
1924,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With its twisted patterns, white and wan,"
1925,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Shining like a mottled fan
1926,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Spread by the blue sea, faint and far;"
1927,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And far away we heard once more
1928,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A sound of singing on the shore,"
1929,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where boys in blue kimonos bore
1930,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Roses in a golden jar:
1931,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And we heard, where the cherry orchards blow,"
1932,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The serpent-charmers fluting low,"
1933,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the song of the maidens of Miyako.
1934,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1935,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And at our feet unbroken lay
1936,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The glass that had whirled us thither away:
1937,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And in the grass, among the flowers"
1938,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We sat and wished all sorts of things:
1939,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, we were wealthier than kings!"
1940,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We ruled the world for several hours!
1941,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And then, it seemed, we knew not why,"
1942,THE MYSTIC RUBY,All the daisies began to die.
1943,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1944,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We wished them alive again; but soon
1945,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The trees all fled up towards the moon
1946,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like peacocks through the sunlit air:
1947,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the butterflies flapped into silver fish;
1948,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And each wish spoiled another wish;
1949,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Till we threw the glass down in despair;
1950,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"For, getting whatever you want to get,"
1951,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Is like drinking tea from a fishing net.
1952,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1953,THE MYSTIC RUBY,At last we thought we'd wish once more
1954,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That all should be as it was before;
1955,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And then we'd shatter the glass, if we could;"
1956,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"But just as the world grew right again,"
1957,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We heard a wanderer out on the plain
1958,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Singing what none of us understood;
1959,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Yet we thought that the world grew thrice more sweet
1960,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the meadows were blossoming under his feet.
1961,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1962,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And we felt a grand and beautiful fear,"
1963,THE MYSTIC RUBY,For we knew that a marvellous thought drew near;
1964,THE MYSTIC RUBY,So we kept the glass for a little while:
1965,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the skies grew deeper and twice as bright,"
1966,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the seas grew soft as a flower of light,"
1967,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the meadows rippled from stile to stile;
1968,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And memories danced in a musical throng
1969,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Thro' the blossom that scented the wonderful song.

1993,SONG,We wished with the magic glass again
1994,SONG,To go to the Flower of the song's desire:
1995,SONG,And o'er us the whole of the soft blue sky
1996,SONG,"Flashed like fire as the world went by,"
1997,SONG,And far beneath us the sea like fire
1998,SONG,"Flashed in one swift blue brilliant stream,"

2220,I,"Faintly, fondly it faltered nigh"
2221,I,"The throne of the Spring in the Southern sky,"

2229,II,When Spring comes back to England
2230,II,"And crowns her brows with May,"
2231,II,Round the merry moonlit world
2232,II,She goes the greenwood way:
2233,II,"She throws a rose to Italy,"
2234,II,A fleur-de-lys to France;
2235,II,But round her regal morris-ring
2236,II,The seas of England dance.
2237,II,
2238,II,When Spring comes back to England
2239,II,"And dons her robe of green,"

2266,III,
2267,III,There's many a wanderer far away

2330,PIRATES,Come from your grave in the darkness and let us be pirates again.
2331,PIRATES,
2332,PIRATES,"Let us be boys together to-night, and pretend as of old"

2334,PIRATES,"Red Spanish doubloons and great pieces of eight, and muskets"

2339,PIRATES,The old cave in the fir-wood that slopes down the hills to the sea
2340,PIRATES,"Still is haunted, perhaps, by young pirates as wicked as we:"
2341,PIRATES,Though the fir with the magpie's big mud-plastered nest used to hide
2342,PIRATES,"it so well,"
2343,PIRATES,And the boys in the gang had to swear that they never would tell.
2344,PIRATES,
2345,PIRATES,"Ah, that tree; I have sat in its boughs and looked seaward for hours."
2346,PIRATES,"I remember the creak of its branches, the scent of the flowers"

2348,PIRATES,"Those little things best, that I scarcely took heed of at all."
2349,PIRATES,
2350,PIRATES,I remember how brightly the brass on the butt of my spy-glass gleamed
2351,PIRATES,As I climbed through the purple heather and thyme to our eyrie
2352,PIRATES,and dreamed;
2353,PIRATES,I remember the smooth glossy sun-burn that darkened our faces

2355,PIRATES,As we gazed at the merchantmen sailing away to those wonderful lands.
2356,PIRATES,
2357,PIRATES,"I remember the long, slow sigh of the sea as we raced in the sun,"
2358,PIRATES,To dry ourselves after our swimming; and how we would run
2359,PIRATES,"With a cry and a crash through the foam as it creamed on the shore,"
2360,PIRATES,Then back to bask in the warm dry gold of the sand once more.
2361,PIRATES,
2362,PIRATES,"Come to me, you with the laughing face, in the gloom as I lie"

2370,PIRATES,"No; perhaps we _will_ quarrel, just once, or it scarcely will seem"
2371,PIRATES,So like the old days that have flown from us both like a dream.
2372,PIRATES,
2373,PIRATES,Still; you shall be chief in the end; and then we'll go home
2374,PIRATES,"To the hearth and the tea and the books that we loved: ah, but come,"

2483,THE OLD SCEPTIC,I will go back to the home where of old in my boyish pride
2484,THE OLD SCEPTIC,I pierced my father's heart with a murmur of unbelief.
2485,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"He only looked in my face as I spoke, but his mute eyes cried"
2486,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"Night after night in my dreams; and he died in grief, in grief."
2487,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2488,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"Books? I have read the books, the books that we write ourselves,"
2489,THE OLD SCEPTIC,Extolling our love of an abstract truth and our pride of debate:
2490,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"I will go back to the love of the cotter who sings as he delves,"
2491,THE OLD SCEPTIC,To that childish infinite love and the God above fact and date.
2492,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2493,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"To that ignorant infinite God who colours the meaningless flowers,"

2500,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"The shining mirrors of heaven, the shadowy mirrors of hell,"

2502,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2503,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"No faith I hurl against you, no fact to freeze your sneers."
2504,THE OLD SCEPTIC,Only the doubt you taught me to weld in the fires of youth
2505,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"Leaps to my hand like the flaming sword of nineteen hundred years,"
2506,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"The sword of the high God's answer, _O Pilate, what is truth?_"
2507,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2508,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"Your laughter has killed more hearts than ever were pierced with swords,"
2509,THE OLD SCEPTIC,Ever you daub new mirrors and turn the old to the wall;
2510,THE OLD SCEPTIC,And more than blood is lost in the weary battle of words;

2515,THE OLD SCEPTIC,But nothing is true or false in the infinite heart of the rose;
2516,THE OLD SCEPTIC,And the earth is a little dust that clings to our travelling feet.
2517,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2518,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"I will go back to my home and look at the wayside flowers,"

2521,THE OLD SCEPTIC,And the light of the chapel porches broods on the peaceful lane.
2522,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2523,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"And there I shall hear men praying the deep old foolish prayers,"
2524,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"And there I shall see, once more, the fond old faith confessed,"
2525,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"And the strange old light on their faces who hear as a blind man hears,--"
2526,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"_Come unto Me, ye weary, and I will give you rest._"
2527,THE OLD SCEPTIC,
2528,THE OLD SCEPTIC,"I will go back and believe in the deep old foolish tales,"

2615,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,
2616,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"She studied every sob she heard,"
2617,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,She watched each dying hope she found;
2618,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,And yet she understood not one
2619,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Poor sorrow there that like a wound
2620,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"Gaped, bleeding, pleading--for one word--"
2621,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,No? And the dream was done.
2622,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,
2623,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"For her--I am ""wrapped in incense gloom,"

2625,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Once I was shod with fire and trod
2626,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Beethoven's path through storm and night:
2627,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,It is too late now to resume
2628,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,My monologue with God.
2629,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,
2630,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"Well, my lost love, you were so kind"
2631,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"In those old days: ah, yes; you came"
2632,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,When I was ill! In dreams you still
2633,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Will come? (Do roses always flame
2634,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"By moonlight, thus?) I, too, grow blind"
2635,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,With wondering if she will.
2636,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,
2637,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"Yet, Floriani, what am I"
2638,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"To you, though love was life to me?"
2639,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,My life consumed like some perfumed
2640,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Pale altar-flame beside the sea:
2641,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,You stood and smiled and watched it die!
2642,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"You, you whom it illumed,"
2643,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Could you not feed it with your love?
2644,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,Am I not starving here and now?
2645,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,"Sing, sing! I'd miss no smile or kiss--"
2646,THE DEATH OF CHOPIN,No roses in Majorca glow

2829,(PORTSMOUTH 1805),But I knew no peace and I took no rest
2830,(PORTSMOUTH 1805),Though the roses nigh smothered my snug little nest;
2831,(PORTSMOUTH 1805),For the smell of the sea

3078,EARTH-BOUND,
3079,EARTH-BOUND,"Through dark abysms of Space,"
3080,EARTH-BOUND,From strange new spheres where Death has called them now
3081,EARTH-BOUND,"May they not, with a crown on every brow,"
3082,EARTH-BOUND,Still cry to the loved earth's lost familiar face?
3083,EARTH-BOUND,
3084,EARTH-BOUND,"We two, love, we should come"
3085,EARTH-BOUND,Seeking a little refuge from the light
3086,EARTH-BOUND,"Of the blinding terrible star-sown Infinite,"
3087,EARTH-BOUND,"Seeking some sheltering roof, some four-walled home,"
3088,EARTH-BOUND,

3090,EARTH-BOUND,"Communion with the universe and God,"
3091,EARTH-BOUND,How glad to creep back to some lane we trod

3094,EARTH-BOUND,"Fresh from death's boundless birth,"
3095,EARTH-BOUND,How fond the circled vision of the sea
3096,EARTH-BOUND,"Would seem to souls tired of Infinity,"
3097,EARTH-BOUND,"How kind the soft blue boundaries of earth,"
3098,EARTH-BOUND,
3099,EARTH-BOUND,How rich the nodding spray
3100,EARTH-BOUND,Of pale green leaves that made the sapphire deep
3101,EARTH-BOUND,A background to the dreams of that brief sleep
3102,EARTH-BOUND,We called our life when heaven was far away.
3103,EARTH-BOUND,
3104,EARTH-BOUND,How strange would be the sight
3105,EARTH-BOUND,"Of the little towns and twisted streets again,"
3106,EARTH-BOUND,Where all the hurrying works and ways of men
3107,EARTH-BOUND,Would seem a children's game for our delight.
3108,EARTH-BOUND,
3109,EARTH-BOUND,What boundless heaven could give
3110,EARTH-BOUND,"This joy in the strait austere restraints of earth,"
3111,EARTH-BOUND,Whereof the dead have felt the immortal dearth
3112,EARTH-BOUND,Who look upon God's face and cannot live?
3113,EARTH-BOUND,
3114,EARTH-BOUND,Our ghosts would clutch at flowers
3115,EARTH-BOUND,"As drowning men at straws, for fear the sea"
3116,EARTH-BOUND,"Should sweep them back to God's Eternity,"
3117,EARTH-BOUND,Still clinging to the day that once was ours.
3118,EARTH-BOUND,
3119,EARTH-BOUND,No more with fevered brain
3120,EARTH-BOUND,Plunging across the gulfs of Space and Time
3121,EARTH-BOUND,Would we revisit this our earthly clime
3122,EARTH-BOUND,"We two, if we could ever come again;"
3123,EARTH-BOUND,
3124,EARTH-BOUND,"Not as we came of old,"
3125,EARTH-BOUND,But reverencing the flesh we now despise
3126,EARTH-BOUND,"And gazing out with consecrated eyes,"
3127,EARTH-BOUND,Each of us glad of the other's hand to hold.
3128,EARTH-BOUND,
3129,EARTH-BOUND,So we should wander nigh
3130,EARTH-BOUND,"Our mortal home, and see its little roof"
3131,EARTH-BOUND,Keeping the deep eternal night aloof
3132,EARTH-BOUND,And yielding us a refuge from the sky.
3133,EARTH-BOUND,
3134,EARTH-BOUND,"We should steal in, once more,"
3135,EARTH-BOUND,"Under the cloudy lilac at the gate,"
3136,EARTH-BOUND,"Up the walled garden, then with hearts elate"
3137,EARTH-BOUND,Forget the stars and close our cottage door.
3138,EARTH-BOUND,
3139,EARTH-BOUND,"Oh then, as children use"
3140,EARTH-BOUND,"To make themselves a little hiding-place,"
3141,EARTH-BOUND,"We would rejoice in narrowness of space,"
3142,EARTH-BOUND,And God should give us nothing more to lose.
3143,EARTH-BOUND,
3144,EARTH-BOUND,How good it all would seem
3145,EARTH-BOUND,To souls that from the æonian ebb and flow
3146,EARTH-BOUND,Came down to hear once more the to and fro
3147,EARTH-BOUND,Swing o' the clock dictate its hourly theme.
3148,EARTH-BOUND,
3149,EARTH-BOUND,How dear the strange recall
3150,EARTH-BOUND,From vast antiphonies of joy and pain
3151,EARTH-BOUND,"Beyond the grave, to these old books again,"
3152,EARTH-BOUND,"That cosy lamp, those pictures on the wall."
3153,EARTH-BOUND,
3154,EARTH-BOUND,Home! Home! The old desire!
3155,EARTH-BOUND,"We would shut out the innumerable skies,"
3156,EARTH-BOUND,"Draw close the curtains, then with patient eyes"
3157,EARTH-BOUND,"Bend o'er the hearth; laugh at our memories,"
3158,EARTH-BOUND,Or watch them crumbling in the crimson fire.

3462,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"The linnet and the throstle, too, and after dark the long halloo"
3463,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And golden-eyed _tu-whit, tu-whoo_ of owls that ogle London."
3464,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3465,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For Noah hardly knew a bird of any kind that isn't heard
3466,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"At Kew, at Kew in lilac-time (and oh, so near to London!)"
3467,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And when the rose begins to pout and all the chestnut spires are out
3468,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"You'll hear the rest without a doubt, all chorussing for London:--"
3469,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3470,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"_Come down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time;"
3471,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Come down to Kew in lilac-time (it isn't far from London!)
3472,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer's wonderland;
3473,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Come down to Kew in lilac-time (it isn't far from London!)_
3474,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3475,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And then the troubadour begins to thrill the golden street,"
3476,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3477,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And in all the gaudy busses there are scores of weary feet
3478,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Marking time, sweet time, with a dull mechanic beat,"
3479,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And a thousand hearts are plunging to a love they'll never meet,"
3480,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Through the meadows of the sunset, through the poppies and the wheat,"
3481,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
3482,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3483,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Verdi, Verdi, when you wrote _Il Trovatore_ did you dream"
3484,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Of the City when the sun sinks low,"
3485,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Of the organ and the monkey and the many-coloured stream
3486,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"On the Piccadilly pavement, of the myriad eyes that seem"
3487,THE BARREL-ORGAN,To be litten for a moment with a wild Italian gleam
3488,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As _A che la morte_ parodies the world's eternal theme
3489,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And pulses with the sunset-glow.
3490,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3491,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's a thief, perhaps, that listens with a face of frozen stone"
3492,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3493,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's a portly man of business with a balance of his own,"
3494,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a clerk and there's a butcher of a soft reposeful tone.
3495,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And they're all of them returning to the heavens they have known:
3496,THE BARREL-ORGAN,They are crammed and jammed in busses and--they're each of them alone
3497,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
3498,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3499,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a very modish woman and her smile is very bland
3500,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3501,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And her hansom jingles onward, but her little jewelled hand"
3502,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Is clenched a little tighter and she cannot understand
3503,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"What she wants or why she wanders to that undiscovered land,"
3504,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"For the parties there are not at all the sort of thing she planned,"
3505,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
3506,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3507,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a rowing man that listens and his heart is crying out
3508,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3509,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"For the barge, the eight, the Isis, and the coach's whoop and shout,"
3510,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"For the minute-gun, the counting and the long dishevelled rout,"
3511,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"For the howl along the tow-path and a fate that's still in doubt,"
3512,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For a roughened oar to handle and a race to think about
3513,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
3514,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3515,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a labourer that listens to the voices of the dead
3516,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3517,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And his hand begins to tremble and his face to smoulder red
3518,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As he sees a loafer watching him and--there he turns his head
3519,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And stares into the sunset where his April love is fled,"
3520,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For he hears her softly singing and his lonely soul is led
3521,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Through the land where the dead dreams go.
3522,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3523,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's an old and haggard demi-rep, it's ringing in her ears,"
3524,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3525,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"With the wild and empty sorrow of the love that blights and sears,"
3526,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Oh, and if she hurries onward, then be sure, be sure she hears,"
3527,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Hears and bears the bitter burden of the unforgotten years,"
3528,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And her laugh's a little harsher and her eyes are brimmed with tears
3529,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For the land where the dead dreams go.
3530,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3531,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
3532,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
3533,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Though the music's only Verdi there's a world to make it sweet
3534,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Just as yonder yellow sunset where the earth and heaven meet
3535,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Mellows all the sooty City! Hark, a hundred thousand feet"
3536,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Are marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat
3537,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
3538,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3539,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"So it's Jeremiah, Jeremiah,"
3540,THE BARREL-ORGAN,What have you to say
3541,THE BARREL-ORGAN,When you meet the garland girls
3542,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Tripping on their way?
3543,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3544,THE BARREL-ORGAN,All around my gala hat
3545,THE BARREL-ORGAN,I wear a wreath of roses
3546,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(A long and lonely year it is
3547,THE BARREL-ORGAN,I've waited for the May!)
3548,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"If any one should ask you,"
3549,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The reason why I wear it is--
3550,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"My own love, my true love"
3551,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Is coming home to-day.
3552,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3553,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And it's buy a bunch of violets for the lady
3554,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(_It's lilac-time in London; it's lilac-time in London!_)
3555,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Buy a bunch of violets for the lady
3556,THE BARREL-ORGAN,While the sky burns blue above:
3557,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3558,THE BARREL-ORGAN,On the other side the street you'll find it shady
3559,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(_It's lilac-time in London; it's lilac-time in London!_)
3560,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"But buy a bunch of violets for the lady,"
3561,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And tell her she's your own true love.
3562,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3563,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
3564,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks glittering and slow;
3565,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And the music's not immortal; but the world has made it sweet
3566,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And enriched it with the harmonies that make a song complete
3567,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"In the deeper heavens of music where the night and morning meet,"
3568,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As it dies into the sunset-glow;
3569,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain
3570,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light,"
3571,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And they've given it a glory and a part to play again
3572,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the Symphony that rules the day and night.
3573,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3574,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And there, as the music changes,"
3575,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The song runs round again.
3576,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more it turns and ranges
3577,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Through all its joy and pain,"
3578,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Dissects the common carnival
3579,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Of passions and regrets;
3580,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And the wheeling world remembers all
3581,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The wheeling song forgets.
3582,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3583,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more _La Traviata_ sighs
3584,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Another sadder song:
3585,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more _Il Trovatore_ cries
3586,THE BARREL-ORGAN,A tale of deeper wrong;
3587,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more the knights to battle go
3588,THE BARREL-ORGAN,With sword and shield and lance
3589,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Till once, once more, the shattered foe"
3590,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Has whirled into--_a dance_!
3591,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
3592,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"_Come down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time;"
3593,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Come down to Kew in lilac-time (it isn't far from London!)
3594,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer's wonderland;

3859,IV,
3860,IV,
3861,V,V
3862,V,
3863,V,I am the End to which the whole world strives:
3864,V,Therefore are ye girdled with a wild desire and shod
3865,V,With sorrow; for among you all no soul
3866,V,Shall ever cease or sleep or reach its goal
3867,V,"Of union and communion with the Whole,"
3868,V,Or rest content with less than being God.
3869,V,"Still, as unending asymptotes, your lives"
3870,V,In all their myriad wandering ways
3871,V,Approach Me with the progress of the golden days;
3872,V,Approach Me; for my love contrives
3873,V,That ye should have the glory of this
3874,V,"For ever; yea, that life should blend"
3875,V,With life and only vanish away
3876,V,"From day to wider wealthier day,"
3877,V,Like still increasing spheres of light that melt and merge in
3878,V,wider spheres
3879,V,Even as the infinite years of the past melt in the infinite
3880,V,future years.
3881,V,"Each new delight of sense,"
3882,V,"Each hope, each love, each fear,"
3883,V,"Widens, relumes and recreates each sphere,"
3884,V,From a new ring and nimbus of pre-eminence.
3885,V,I am the Sphere without circumference:
3886,V,I only and for ever comprehend
3887,V,All others that within me meet and blend.
3888,V,Death is but the blinding kiss
3889,V,Of two finite infinities;
3890,V,Two finite infinite orbs
3891,V,The splendour of the greater of which absorbs
3892,V,"The less, though both like Love have no beginning and no end."
3893,V,
3894,V,
3895,VI,VI
3896,VI,
3897,VI,Therefore is Love's own breath
3898,VI,"Like Knowledge, a continual death;"
3899,VI,"And all his laughter and kisses and tears,"
3900,VI,"And woven wiles of peace and strife,"
3901,VI,"That ever widen thus your temporal spheres,"
3902,VI,Are making of the memory of your former years
3903,VI,A very death in life.
3904,VI,
3905,VI,
3906,VII,VII
3907,VII,
3908,VII,I am that I am;
3909,VII,Ye are evil and good;
3910,VII,With colour and glory and story and song ye are fed as with food:
3911,VII,"The cold and the heat,"
3912,VII,"The bitter and the sweet,"
3913,VII,The calm and the tempest fulfil my Word;
3914,VII,Yet will ye complain of my two-edged sword
3915,VII,That has fashioned the finite and mortal and given you the sweetness
3916,VII,"of strife,"
3917,VII,"The blackness and whiteness,"
3918,VII,"The darkness and brightness,"
3919,VII,Which sever your souls from the formless and void and hold you
3920,VII,fast-fettered to life?
3921,VII,
3922,VII,
3923,VIII,VIII
3924,VIII,
3925,VIII,"Behold now, is Life not good?"
3926,VIII,"Yea, is it not also much more than the food,"
3927,VIII,"More than the raiment, more than the breath?"
3928,VIII,Yet Strife is its name!
3929,VIII,"Say, which will ye cast out first from the furnace, the fuel or"
3930,VIII,the flame?
3931,VIII,Would ye all be as I am; and know neither evil nor good; neither
3932,VIII,life; neither death;
3933,VIII,Or mix with the void and the formless till all were as one and
3934,VIII,the same?
3935,VIII,
3936,VIII,
3937,IX,IX
3938,IX,
3939,IX,"I am that I am; the Container of all things: kneel, lift up your hands"
3940,IX,To the high Consummation of good and of evil which none understands;
3941,IX,"The divine Paradox, the ineffable Word, in whose light the poor souls"
3942,IX,that ye trod
3943,IX,Underfoot as too vile for their fellows are at terrible union with God!
3944,IX,"Am I not over both evil and good,"
3945,IX,The righteous man and the shedder of blood?
3946,IX,Shall I save or slay?
3947,IX,"I am neither the night nor the day,"
3948,IX,Saith the Lord.
3949,IX,"Judge not, oh ye that are round my footstool, judge not, ere the hour"
3950,IX,be born
3951,IX,That shall laugh you also to scorn.

3955,X,"Ah, yet I say unto all that have sinned,"

3958,X,To cover you all: they are free as the wings of the wind.
3959,X,
3960,X,
3961,XI,XI
3962,XI,
3963,XI,But one thing is needful; and ye shall be true
3964,XI,To yourselves and the goal and the God that ye seek;
3965,XI,"Yea, the day and the night shall requite it to you"
3966,XI,"If ye love one another, if your love be not weak."
3967,XI,
3968,XI,
3969,XII,XII
3970,XII,
3971,XII,Since I sent out my worlds in their battle-array
3972,XII,"To die and to live,"
3973,XII,"To give and to receive,"
3974,XII,"Not peace, not peace, I have brought among you but a sword,"
3975,XII,"To divide the night from the day,"
3976,XII,Saith the Lord;
3977,XII,"Yet all that is broken shall be mended,"
3978,XII,"And all that is lost shall be found,"
3979,XII,"I will bind up every wound,"
3980,XII,When that which is begun shall be ended.

4001,I,
4002,II,II
4003,II,
4004,II,And God sighed in the sunset; and the sea
4005,II,Chanted the soft recessional of Time
4006,II,Against the golden shores of mystery;
4007,II,
4008,II,And ever as that long low change and chime
4009,II,With one slow sob of molten music yearned
4010,II,"Westward, it seemed as if the Love sublime"
4011,II,
4012,II,"Almost uttered itself, where the waves burned"
4013,II,In little flower-soft flames of rose and green
4014,II,"That woke to seaward, while the tides returned"
4015,II,
4016,II,"Rising and falling, ruffled and serene,"
4017,II,With all the mirrored tints of heaven above
4018,II,Shimmering through their mystic myriad sheen.
4019,II,
4020,II,As a dove's burnished breast throbbing with love
4021,II,Swells and subsides to call her soft-eyed mate
4022,II,"Home through the rosy gloom of glen or grove,"
4023,II,
4024,II,So when the greenwood noon was growing late
4025,II,"The sea called softly through the waste of years,"
4026,II,Called to the star that still can consecrate
4027,II,
4028,II,The holy golden haze of human tears
4029,II,Which tinges every sunset with our grief
4030,II,Until the perfect Paraclete appears.
4031,II,
4032,II,"Ah, the long sigh that yields the world relief"
4033,II,"Rose and relapsed across Eternity,"
4034,II,"Making a joy of sorrows that are brief,"
4035,II,
4036,II,"As, o'er the bright enchantment of the sea,"
4037,II,Facing the towers of that old City of Pain
4038,II,Which stands upon the shores of mystery
4039,II,
4040,II,"And frowns across the immeasurable main,"
4041,II,Venus among her cloudy sunset flowers
4042,II,Woke; and earth melted into heaven again.
4043,II,
4044,II,For even the City's immemorial towers
4045,II,"Were tinted into secret tone and time,"
4046,II,Like old forgotten tombs that age embowers
4047,II,
4048,II,With muffling roses and with mossy rime
4049,II,"Until they seem no monument of ours,"
4050,II,But one more note in earth's accordant chime.
4051,II,
4052,II,"O Love, Love, Love, all dreams, desires and powers,"
4053,II,Were but as chords of that ineffable psalm;
4054,II,"And all the long blue lapse of summer hours,"
4055,II,
4056,II,And all the breathing sunset's golden balm
4057,II,By that æonian sorrow were resolved
4058,II,"As dew into the music's infinite calm,"
4059,II,
4060,II,Through which the suns and moons and stars revolved
4061,II,"According to the song's divine decree,"
4062,II,Till Time was but a tide of intervolved
4063,II,
4064,II,And interweaving worlds of melody;
4065,II,"_In other worlds I loved you, long ago_,--"
4066,II,The angelic citoles fainted o'er the sea;
4067,II,
4068,II,"And seraph citerns answered, sweet and low,"
4069,II,"From where the sunset and the moonrise blend,--"
4070,II,"_In other worlds I loved you, long ago_;"
4071,II,
4072,II,_Love that hath no beginning hath no end_;
4073,II,"O Love, Love, Love, the bitter City of Pain"
4074,II,"Bidding the golden echoes westward wend,"
4075,II,
4076,II,Chimed in accordant undertone again:
4077,II,Though every grey old tower rose like a tomb
4078,II,To mock the glory of the shoreless main
4079,II,
4080,II,They could but strike such discords as illume
4081,II,The music with strange gleams of utter light
4082,II,And hallow all the valley's rosy gloom.
4083,II,
4084,II,"And there, though greyly sinking out of sight"
4085,II,"Before the wonders of the sky and sea,"
4086,II,"Back through the valley, back into the night,"
4087,II,
4088,II,"While mystery melted into mystery,"
4089,II,The City still rebuffed the far sweet West
4090,II,That dimmed her sorrows with infinity;
4091,II,
4092,II,Yet sometimes yearning o'er the sea's bright breast
4093,II,To that remote Avilion would she gaze
4094,II,Where all lost loves and weary warriors rest.
4095,II,
4096,II,"Then she remembered, through that golden haze,"
4097,II,(Oh faint as flowers the rose-white waves resound)
4098,II,"Her Arthur whom she loved in the dead days,"
4099,II,
4100,II,"And how he sailed to heal him of his wound,"
4101,II,And how he lives and reigns eternally
4102,II,Where now that unknown love is throned and crowned
4103,II,
4104,II,Who laid his bleeding head against her knee
4105,II,And loosed the bitter breast-plate and unbound
4106,II,"His casque and brought him strangely o'er the sea,"
4107,II,
4108,II,And how she reigns beside him on that shore
4109,II,"For ever (Yrma, queen, bend down to me)"
4110,II,And they twain have no sorrow any more.
4111,II,
4112,II,
4113,III,III
4114,III,
4115,III,They have forgotten all that vanished away
4116,III,When life's dark night died into death's bright day
4117,III,They have forgotten all except the gleam
4118,III,Of light when once he kissed her in a dream
4119,III,Once on the lips and once upon the brow
4120,III,In the white orb of God's transcendent Now;
4121,III,"And even then he knew that, long before,"
4122,III,Their eyes had met upon some distant shore;
4123,III,Yea; that most lonely and immortal face
4124,III,Which dwells beyond the dreams of time and space
4125,III,Bowed down to him from out the happy place
4126,III,"And whispered to him, low and sweet and low"
4127,III,"_In other worlds I loved you, long ago_;"
4128,III,And then he knew his love could never die
4129,III,Because his queen was throned beyond the sky
4130,III,And called him to his own immortal sphere
4131,III,Forgetting Launcelot and Guinevere.
4132,III,
4133,III,"So Yrma reigns with Arthur, and they know"
4134,III,They loved on earth a million years ago;
4135,III,And watched the sea-waves wistfully westward wend;
4136,III,"And heard a voice whispering in their flow,"
4137,III,"And calling through the silent sunset-glow,"
4138,III,_Love that hath no beginning hath no end._
4139,III,
4140,III,
4141,IV,IV
4142,IV,
4143,IV,It was about the dawn of day
4144,IV,I heard Etain and Anwyl say
4145,IV,"The waving ferns are a fairy forest,"
4146,IV,"It is time, it is time to wander away;"
4147,IV,
4148,IV,"For the dew is bright on the heather bells,"
4149,IV,"And the breeze in the clover sways and swells,"
4150,IV,"As the waves on the blue sea wake and wander,"
4151,IV,Over and under the braes and dells.
4152,IV,
4153,IV,"She was eight years old that day,"
4154,IV,Full of laughter and play;
4155,IV,"Eight years old and Anwyl nine,--"
4156,IV,Two young lovers were they.
4157,IV,
4158,IV,"Two young lovers were they,"
4159,IV,Born in the City of Pain;
4160,IV,There was never a song in the world so gay
4161,IV,"As the song of the child, Etain;"
4162,IV,
4163,IV,There was never a laugh so sweet
4164,IV,"With the ripple of fairy bells,"
4165,IV,And never a fairy foot so fleet
4166,IV,Dancing down the woodland dells!
4167,IV,
4168,IV,"She was eight years old that day,"
4169,IV,Two young lovers were they.
4170,IV,
4171,IV,There was never a sea of mystical gleams
4172,IV,Glooming under enchanted skies
4173,IV,Deep as the dark miraculous dreams
4174,IV,In Anwyl's haunted eyes.
4175,IV,
4176,IV,There was never a glory of light
4177,IV,Around the carolling lark
4178,IV,As Etain's eyes were brave and bright
4179,IV,To daunt the coming dark.
4180,IV,
4181,IV,Two young lovers were they
4182,IV,Born in the City of Pain;
4183,IV,There was never a song in the world so gay
4184,IV,"As the song of the child, Etain;"
4185,IV,
4186,IV,"Blithe as the wind in the trees,"
4187,IV,"Blithe as the bird on the bough,"
4188,IV,Blithe as the bees in the sweet Heart's-ease
4189,IV,Where Love lies bleeding now.
4190,IV,
4191,IV,
4192,V,V
4193,V,
4194,V,And God sighed in the sunset; and the sea
4195,V,"Forgot her sorrow, and all the breathless West"
4196,V,Grew quiet as the blue tranquillity
4197,V,
4198,V,"That clad the broken mountain's brilliant breast,"
4199,V,"Over the City, with deep heather-bloom"
4200,V,"Heaving from crag to crag in sweet unrest,"
4201,V,
4202,V,A sea of dim rich colour and warm perfume
4203,V,Whose billows rocked the drowsy honey-bee
4204,V,Among the golden isles of gorse and broom
4205,V,
4206,V,Like some enchanted ancient argosy
4207,V,Drunkenly blundering over seas of dream
4208,V,"Past unimagined isles of mystery,"
4209,V,"Over whose yellow sands the soft waves cream,"
4210,V,And sunbeams float and toss across the bare
4211,V,Rose-white arms and perilous breasts that gleam
4212,V,
4213,V,Where sirens wind their glossy golden hair;
4214,V,"Oh, miles on miles, the honeyed heather-bloom"
4215,V,Heaving its purple through the high bright air
4216,V,
4217,V,Rolled a silent glory of gleam and gloom
4218,V,From mossy crag to crag and crest to crest
4219,V,Untroubled by the valley's depth of doom.
4220,V,
4221,V,The hawk dropped down into the pine-forest
4222,V,"And, far below, the lavrock ruffled her wings"
4223,V,Blossomwise over her winsome secret nest.
4224,V,
4225,V,"Then suddenly, softly, as when a fairy sings"
4226,V,"Out of the heart of a rose in the heart of the fern,"
4227,V,Or in the floating starlight faintly rings
4228,V,
4229,V,"The frail blue hare-bells--turn again, and turn,"
4230,V,"Under and over, the silvery crescents cry"
4231,V,To where the crimson fox-glove belfries burn
4232,V,
4233,V,"And with a deeper softer peal reply,"
4234,V,There came a ripple of music through the roses
4235,V,That rustled on the dimmest rim of sky
4236,V,
4237,V,Where many a frame of fretted leaves encloses
4238,V,For lovers wandering in the fern-wet wood
4239,V,An arch of summer sea that softly dozes
4240,V,
4241,V,As if all mysteries were understood:
4242,V,"Yrma, my queen, what love could understand"
4243,V,"That faint sweet music, _God saith all is good_,"
4244,V,
4245,V,"As those two children, hand in sunburnt hand,"
4246,V,Over the blithe blue hills and far away
4247,V,Wandered into their own green fairyland?
4248,V,
4249,V,
4250,VI,VI
4251,VI,
4252,VI,For the song is lost that shook the dew
4253,VI,"Where the wild musk-roses glisten,"
4254,VI,When the sunset dreamed that a dream was true
4255,VI,And the birds were hushed to listen.
4256,VI,
4257,VI,The song is lost that shook the night
4258,VI,"With wings of richer fire,"
4259,VI,Where the years had touched their eyes with light
4260,VI,And their souls with a new desire;
4261,VI,
4262,VI,And the new delight of the strange old story
4263,VI,"Burned in the flower-soft skies,"
4264,VI,And nine more years with a darker glory
4265,VI,Had deepened the light of her eyes;
4266,VI,
4267,VI,"But lost, oh more than lost the song"
4268,VI,"That shook the rose to tears,"
4269,VI,As hand in hand they danced along
4270,VI,Through childhood's everlasting years.
4271,VI,
4272,VI,"""Oh, Love has wings,"" the linnet sings;"
4273,VI,"But the dead return no more, no more;"
4274,VI,And the sea is breaking its old grey heart
4275,VI,Against the golden shore.
4276,VI,
4277,VI,"She was eight years old that day,"
4278,VI,Two young lovers were they.
4279,VI,
4280,VI,If every song as they danced along
4281,VI,Paused on the springing spray;
4282,VI,Is there never a bird in the wide greenwood
4283,VI,Will hush its heart to-day?
4284,VI,
4285,VI,There's never a leaf with dew impearled
4286,VI,"To make their pathway sweet,"
4287,VI,And never a blossom in all the world
4288,VI,That knows the kiss of their feet.
4289,VI,
4290,VI,No light to-night declares the word
4291,VI,"That thrilled the blossomed bough,"
4292,VI,And stilled the happy singing bird
4293,VI,That none can silence now.
4294,VI,
4295,VI,The weary nightingale may sob
4296,VI,"With her bleeding breast against a thorn,"
4297,VI,And the wild white rose with every throb
4298,VI,Grow red as the laugh of morn;
4299,VI,
4300,VI,With wings outspread she sinks her head
4301,VI,"But Love returns no more, no more;"
4302,VI,And the sea is breaking its old grey heart
4303,VI,Against the golden shore.
4304,VI,
4305,VI,Born in the City of Pain;
4306,VI,"Ah, who knows, who knows"
4307,VI,When Death shall turn to delight again
4308,VI,"Or a wound to a red, red rose?"
4309,VI,
4310,VI,"Eight years old that day,"
4311,VI,Full of laughter and play;
4312,VI,"Eight years old and Anwyl nine,--"
4313,VI,Two young lovers were they.
4314,VI,
4315,VI,
4316,VII,VII
4317,VII,
4318,VII,And down the scented heather-drowsy hills
4319,VII,"The barefoot children wandered, hand in hand,"
4320,VII,And paddled through the laughing silver rills
4321,VII,In quest of fairyland;
4322,VII,"And in each little sunburnt hand a spray,"
4323,VII,"A purple fox-glove bell-branch lightly swung,"
4324,VII,"And Anwyl told Etain how, far away,"
4325,VII,One day he wandered through the dreamland dells
4326,VII,And watched the moonlit fairies as they sung
4327,VII,And tolled the fox-glove bells;
4328,VII,"And oh, how sweetly, sweetly to and fro"
4329,VII,The fragrance of the music reeled and rung
4330,VII,Under the loaded boughs of starry May.
4331,VII,
4332,VII,"And God sighed in the sunset, and the sea"
4333,VII,Grew quieter than the hills: the mystery
4334,VII,"Of ocean, earth and sky was like a word"
4335,VII,"Uttered, but all unheard,"
4336,VII,Uttered by every wave and cloud and leaf
4337,VII,With all the immortal glory of mortal grief;
4338,VII,And every wave that broke its heart of gold
4339,VII,In music on the rainbow-dazzled shore
4340,VII,"Seemed telling, strangely telling, evermore"
4341,VII,A story that must still remain untold.
4342,VII,
4343,VII,"Oh, _Once upon a time_, and o'er and o'er"
4344,VII,As aye the _Happy ever after_ came
4345,VII,The enchanted waves lavished their faery lore
4346,VII,
4347,VII,And tossed a foam-bow and a rosy flame
4348,VII,"Around the whispers of the creaming foam,"
4349,VII,Till the old rapture with the new sweet name
4350,VII,
4351,VII,"Through all the old romance began to roam,"
4352,VII,"And Anwyl, gazing out across the sea,"
4353,VII,"Dreamed that he heard the distance whisper ""Come."""
4354,VII,
4355,VII,"""Etain,"" he murmured softly and wistfully,"
4356,VII,"With the soul's wakening wonder in his eyes,"
4357,VII,"""Is it not strange to think that there can be"
4358,VII,
4359,VII,"""No end for ever and ever to those skies,"
4360,VII,"No shore beyond, or if there be a shore"
4361,VII,Still without end the world beyond it lies;
4362,VII,
4363,VII,"""Think; think, Etain;"" and all his faery lore"
4364,VII,Mixed with the faith that brought all gods to birth
4365,VII,And sees new heavens transcend for evermore
4366,VII,
4367,VII,The poor impossibilities of earth;
4368,VII,But Etain only laughed: the world to her
4369,VII,Was one sweet smile of very present mirth;
4370,VII,
4371,VII,"Its flowers were only flowers, common or rare;"
4372,VII,Her soul was like a little garden closed
4373,VII,"By rose-clad walls, a place of southern air"
4374,VII,Islanded from the Mystery that reposed
4375,VII,Its vast and brooding wings on that abyss
4376,VII,Through which like little clouds that dreamed and dozed
4377,VII,
4378,VII,The thoughts of Anwyl wandered toward some bliss
4379,VII,"Unknown, unfathomed, far, how far away,"
4380,VII,Where God has gathered all the eternities
4381,VII,"Into strange heavens, beyond the night and day."
4382,VII,
4383,VII,
4384,VIII,VIII
4385,VIII,
4386,VIII,"And over the rolling golden bay,"
4387,VIII,"In the funeral pomp of the dying day,"
4388,VIII,The bell of Time was wistfully tolling
4389,VIII,A million million years away;
4390,VIII,
4391,VIII,And over the heather-drowsy hill
4392,VIII,"Where the burdened bees were buzzing still,"
4393,VIII,The two little sun-bright barefoot children
4394,VIII,Wandered down at the flowers' own will;
4395,VIII,
4396,VIII,"For still as the bell in the sunset tolled,"
4397,VIII,The meadow-sweet and the mary-gold
4398,VIII,And the purple orchis kissed their ankles
4399,VIII,And lured them over the listening wold.
4400,VIII,
4401,VIII,And the feathery billows of blue-gold grass
4402,VIII,"Bowed and murmured and bade them pass,"
4403,VIII,Where a sigh of the sea-wind softly told them
4404,VIII,_There is no Time--Time never was_.
4405,VIII,
4406,VIII,And what if a sorrow were tolled to rest
4407,VIII,"Where the rich light mellowed away in the West,"
4408,VIII,As a glory of fruit in an autumn orchard
4409,VIII,Heaped and asleep o'er the sea's ripe breast?
4410,VIII,
4411,VIII,"Why should they heed it, what should they know"
4412,VIII,"Of the years that come or the years that go,"
4413,VIII,With the warm blue sky around and above them
4414,VIII,And the wild thyme whispering to and fro?
4415,VIII,
4416,VIII,For they heard in the dreamy dawn of day
4417,VIII,"A fairy harper faintly play,"
4418,VIII,"Follow me, follow me, little children,"
4419,VIII,Over the hills and far away;
4420,VIII,
4421,VIII,"Where the dew is bright on the heather-bells,"
4422,VIII,"And the breeze in the clover sways and swells,"
4423,VIII,"As the waves on the blue sea wake and wander,"
4424,VIII,Over and under the braes and dells.
4425,VIII,
4426,VIII,And the hare-bells tinkled and rang Ding dong
4427,VIII,"Bell in the dell as they danced along,"
4428,VIII,"And their feet were stained on the hills with honey,"
4429,VIII,And crushing the clover till evensong.
4430,VIII,
4431,VIII,"And, oh the ripples that rolled in rhyme"
4432,VIII,"Under the wild blue banks of thyme,"
4433,VIII,To the answering rhyme of the rolling ocean's
4434,VIII,Golden glory of change and chime!
4435,VIII,
4436,VIII,For they came to a stream and her fairy lover
4437,VIII,"Caught at her hand and swung her over,"
4438,VIII,And the broad wet buttercups laughed and gilded
4439,VIII,Their golden knees in the deep sweet clover.
4440,VIII,
4441,VIII,There was never a lavrock up in the skies
4442,VIII,"Blithe as the laugh of their lips and eyes,"
4443,VIII,As they glanced and glittered across the meadows
4444,VIII,To waken the sleepy butterflies.
4445,VIII,
4446,VIII,There was never a wave on the sea so gay
4447,VIII,As the light that danced on their homeward way
4448,VIII,Where the waving ferns were a fairy forest
4449,VIII,And a thousand years as yesterday.
4450,VIII,
4451,VIII,"_She was eight years old that day,"
4452,VIII,Full of laughter and play;
4453,VIII,"Eight years old and Anwyl nine,--"
4454,VIII,Two young lovers were they._
4455,VIII,
4456,VIII,And when the clouds like folded sheep
4457,VIII,"Were drowsing over the drowsy deep,"
4458,VIII,And like a rose in a golden cradle
4459,VIII,"Anwyl breathed on the breast of sleep,"
4460,VIII,
4461,VIII,Or ever the petals and leaves were furled
4462,VIII,"At the vesper-song of the sunset-world,"
4463,VIII,The sleepy young rose of nine sweet summers
4464,VIII,Dreamed in his rose-bed cosily curled.
4465,VIII,
4466,VIII,And what if the light of his nine bright years
4467,VIII,"Glistened with laughter or glimmered with tears,"
4468,VIII,Or gleamed like a mystic globe around him
4469,VIII,White as the light of the sphere of spheres?
4470,VIII,
4471,VIII,"And what if a glory of angels there,"
4472,VIII,"Starring an orb of ineffable air,"
4473,VIII,Came floating down from the Gates of jasper
4474,VIII,That melt into flowers at a maiden's prayer?
4475,VIII,
4476,VIII,And what if he dreamed of a fairy face
4477,VIII,"Wondering out of some happy place,"
4478,VIII,Quietly as a star at sunset
4479,VIII,Shines in the rosy dreams of space?
4480,VIII,
4481,VIII,For only as far as the west wind blows
4482,VIII,"The sweets of a swinging full-blown rose,"
4483,VIII,Eight years old and queen of the lilies
4484,VIII,"Little Etain slept--ah, how close!"
4485,VIII,
4486,VIII,At a flower-cry over the moonlit lane
4487,VIII,"In a cottage of roses dreamed Etain,"
4488,VIII,And their purple shadows kissed at her lattice
4489,VIII,And dappled her sigh-soft counterpane;
4490,VIII,
4491,VIII,And or ever Etain with her golden head
4492,VIII,"Had nestled to sleep in her lily-white bed,"
4493,VIII,"She breathed a dream to her fairy lover,"
4494,VIII,"_Please, God, bless Anwyl and me_, she said."
4495,VIII,
4496,VIII,"And a song arose in the rose-white West,"
4497,VIII,"And a whisper of wings o'er the sea's bright breast,"
4498,VIII,And a cry where the moon's old miracle wakened
4499,VIII,A glory of pearl o'er the pine-forest.
4500,VIII,
4501,VIII,Why should they heed it? What should they know
4502,VIII,Of the years to come or the years to go?
4503,VIII,With the starry skies around and above them
4504,VIII,And the roses whispering to and fro.
4505,VIII,
4506,VIII,"Ah, was it a song of the mystic morn"
4507,VIII,When into their beating hearts the thorn
4508,VIII,Should pierce through the red wet crumpled roses
4509,VIII,And all the sorrow of love be born?
4510,VIII,
4511,VIII,"Ah, was it a cry of the wild wayside"
4512,VIII,"Whereby one day they must surely ride,"
4513,VIII,Out of the purple garden of passion
4514,VIII,"To Calvary, to be crucified?"
4515,VIII,
4516,VIII,Only the sound of the distant sea
4517,VIII,"Broke on the shores of Mystery,"
4518,VIII,And tolled as a bell might toll for sorrow
4519,VIII,Till Time be tombed in Eternity;
4520,VIII,
4521,VIII,And in their dreams they only heard
4522,VIII,"Far away, one secret bird"
4523,VIII,"Sing, till the passionate purple twilight"
4524,VIII,Throbbed with the wonder of one sweet word:
4525,VIII,
4526,VIII,"One sweet word and the wonder awoke,"
4527,VIII,And the leaves and the flowers and the starlight spoke
4528,VIII,In silent rapture the strange old secret
4529,VIII,That none e'er knew till the death-dawn broke;
4530,VIII,
4531,VIII,"One sweet whisper, and hand in hand"
4532,VIII,"They wandered in dreams through fairyland,"
4533,VIII,Rapt in the star-bright mystical music
4534,VIII,Which only a child can understand.
4535,VIII,
4536,VIII,But never a child in the world can tell
4537,VIII,"The wonderful tale he knows so well,"
4538,VIII,Though ever as old Time dies in the sunset
4539,VIII,It tolls and tolls like a distant bell.
4540,VIII,
4541,VIII,"_Love, love, love_; and they hardly knew"
4542,VIII,The sense of the glory that round them grew;
4543,VIII,But the world was a wide enchanted garden;
4544,VIII,"And the song, the song, the song rang true."
4545,VIII,
4546,VIII,And they danced with the fairies in emerald rings
4547,VIII,"Arched by the light of their rainbow wings,"
4548,VIII,And they heard the wild green Harper striking
4549,VIII,A starlight over the golden strings.
4550,VIII,
4551,VIII,"_Love, oh love_; and they roamed once more"
4552,VIII,"Through a forest of flowers on a fairy shore,"
4553,VIII,And the sky was a wild bright laugh of wonder
4554,VIII,And the West was a dream of the years of yore.
4555,VIII,
4556,VIII,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago:"
4557,VIII,Love that hath no beginning hath no end:
4558,VIII,"The heather whispers low and sweet and low,"
4559,VIII,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago;"
4560,VIII,The meadows murmur and the firwoods know
4561,VIII,The message that the kindling East shall send;
4562,VIII,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago:"
4563,VIII,Love that hath no beginning hath no end.
4564,VIII,
4565,VIII,
4566,IX,IX
4567,IX,
4568,IX,"Out of the deep, my dream, out of the deep,"
4569,IX,"Yrma, thy voice came to me in my sleep,"
4570,IX,And through a rainbow woven of human tears
4571,IX,I saw two lovers wandering down the years;
4572,IX,"Two children, first, that roamed a sunset land,"
4573,IX,"And then two lovers wandering hand in hand,"
4574,IX,"Forgetful of their childhood's Paradise,"
4575,IX,"For nine more years had darkened in their eyes,"
4576,IX,And heaven itself could hardly find again
4577,IX,"Anwyl, the star-child, or the flower, Etain."
4578,IX,
4579,IX,"For on a day in May, as through the wood"
4580,IX,With earth's new passion beating in his blood
4581,IX,"He went alone, an empty-hearted youth,"
4582,IX,Seeking he knew not what white flower of truth
4583,IX,"Or beauty, on all sides he seemed to see"
4584,IX,"Swift subtle hints of some new harmony,"
4585,IX,"Yet all unheard, ideal, and incomplete,"
4586,IX,"A silent song compact of hopes and fears,"
4587,IX,A music such as lights the wandering feet
4588,IX,Of Yrma when on earth she reappears.
4589,IX,"And he forgot that sad grey City of Pain,"
4590,IX,"For all earth's old romance returned again,"
4591,IX,"And as he went, his dreaming soul grew glad"
4592,IX,To think that he might meet with Galahad
4593,IX,"Or Parsifal in some green glade of fern,"
4594,IX,Or see between the boughs a helmet burn
4595,IX,And hear a joyous laugh kindle the sky
4596,IX,As through the wood Sir Launcelot rode by
4597,IX,With face upturned to take the sun like wine.
4598,IX,"Ah, was it love that made the whole world shine"
4599,IX,"Like some great angel's face, blinded with bliss,"
4600,IX,While Anwyl dreamed of bold Sir Amadis
4601,IX,"And Guinevere's white arms and Iseult's kiss,"
4602,IX,And that glad island in a golden sea
4603,IX,Where Arthur lives and reigns eternally?
4604,IX,Surely the heavens were one wide rose-white flame
4605,IX,As down the path to meet him Yrma came;
4606,IX,"Ah, was it Yrma, with those radiant eyes,"
4607,IX,"That came to greet and lead him through the skies,"
4608,IX,The skies that gloomed and gleamed so far above
4609,IX,The little wandering prayers of human love?...
4610,IX,He had forgotten all except the gleam
4611,IX,"Of light when once he kissed her in a dream, ..."
4612,IX,For surely then he knew that long before
4613,IX,Their eyes had met upon some distant shore....
4614,IX,"Ah, was it Yrma whose red lips he met"
4615,IX,"Between the branches, where the leaves were wet?"
4616,IX,"Etain or Yrma, for it seemed her face"
4617,IX,Bent down upon him from some happy place
4618,IX,"And whispered to him, low and sweet and low,"
4619,IX,"_In other worlds I loved you, long ago!_"
4620,IX,"And he, too, knew his love could never die,"
4621,IX,Because his queen was throned beyond the sky.
4622,IX,
4623,IX,Yet In sweet mortal eyes he met her now
4624,IX,"And kissed Etain beneath the hawthorn bough,"
4625,IX,And dared to dream his infinite dream was true
4626,IX,"On earth and reign with Etain, dream he knew"
4627,IX,Why leaves were green and sides were fresh and blue;
4628,IX,"Yea, dream he knew, as children dream they know"
4629,IX,"They knew all this a million years ago,"
4630,IX,And watched the sea-waves wistfully westward wend
4631,IX,And heard a voice whispering in their flow
4632,IX,And calling through the silent sunset-glow
4633,IX,_Love that hath no beginning hath no end._
4634,IX,
4635,IX,"Ah, could they see in the Valley of Gloom"
4636,IX,That clove the cliffs behind the City;
4637,IX,"Ah, could they hear in the forest of Doom"
4638,IX,The peril that neared without pause or pity?
4639,IX,"Behind the veils of ivy and vine,"
4640,IX,"Wild musk-roses and white woodbine,"
4641,IX,In glens that were wan as with moonlit tears
4642,IX,And rosy with ghosts of eglantine
4643,IX,"And pale as with lilies of long-past years,"
4644,IX,"Ah, could they see, could they hear, could they know"
4645,IX,"Behind that beautiful outward show,"
4646,IX,Behind the pomp and glory of life
4647,IX,That seething old anarchic strife?
4648,IX,For there in many a dim blue glade
4649,IX,"Where the rank red poppies burned,"
4650,IX,And if perchance some dreamer strayed
4651,IX,"He nevermore returned,"
4652,IX,Cold incarnate memories
4653,IX,"Of earth's retributory throes,"
4654,IX,Deadly desires and agonies
4655,IX,"Dark as the worm that never dies,"
4656,IX,"In the outer night arose,"
4657,IX,And waited under those wonderful skies
4658,IX,With Hydra heads and mocking eyes
4659,IX,That winked upon the waning West
4660,IX,"From out the gloom of the oak-forest,"
4661,IX,Till all the wild profound of wood
4662,IX,That o'er the haunted valley slept
4663,IX,Glowed with eyes like pools of blood
4664,IX,"As, lusting after a hideous food,"
4665,IX,Through the haggard vistas crept
4666,IX,"Without a cry, without a hiss,"
4667,IX,The serpent broods of the abyss.
4668,IX,Ancestral folds in darkness furled
4669,IX,Since the beginnings of the world.
4670,IX,Ring upon awful ring uprose
4671,IX,"That obscure heritage of foes,"
4672,IX,The exceeding bitter heritage
4673,IX,Which still a jealous God bestows
4674,IX,"From inappellable age to age,"
4675,IX,The ghostly worms that softly move
4676,IX,Through every grey old corse of love
4677,IX,And creep across the coffined years
4678,IX,To batten on our blood and tears;
4679,IX,And there were hooded shapes of death
4680,IX,"Gaunt and grey, cruel and blind,"
4681,IX,Stealing softly as a breath
4682,IX,Through the woods that loured behind
4683,IX,The City; hooded shapes of fear
4684,IX,"Slowly, slowly stealing near;"
4685,IX,While all the gloom that round them rolled
4686,IX,With intertwisting coils grew cold.
4687,IX,And there with leer and gap-toothed grin
4688,IX,Many a gaunt ancestral Sin
4689,IX,"With clutching fingers, white and thin,"
4690,IX,Strove to put the boughs aside;
4691,IX,And still before them all would glide
4692,IX,Down the wavering moon-white track
4693,IX,"One lissom figure, clad in black;"
4694,IX,Who wept at mirth and mocked at pain
4695,IX,And murmured a song of the wind and the rain;
4696,IX,His laugh was wild with a secret grief;
4697,IX,His eyes were deep like woodland pools;
4698,IX,"And, once and again, as his face drew near"
4699,IX,"In a rosy gloaming of eglantere,"
4700,IX,All the ghosts that gathered there
4701,IX,"Bowed together, naming his name:"
4702,IX,"Lead us, ah thou _Shadow of a Leaf_,"
4703,IX,"Child and master of all our shame,"
4704,IX,Fool of Doubt and King of Fools.
4705,IX,
4706,IX,"Now the linnet had ended his evensong,"
4707,IX,And the lark dropt down from his last wild ditty
4708,IX,And ruffled his wings and his speckled breast
4709,IX,Blossomwise over his June-sweet nest;
4710,IX,While winging wistfully into the West
4711,IX,As a fallen petal is wafted along
4712,IX,The last white sea-mew sought for rest;
4713,IX,"And, over the gleaming heave and swell"
4714,IX,"Of the swinging seas,"
4715,IX,Drowsily breathed the dreaming breeze.
4716,IX,"Then, suddenly, out of the Valley of Gloom"
4717,IX,"That clove the cliffs behind the City,"
4718,IX,Out of the silent forest of Doom
4719,IX,That clothed the valley with clouds of fear
4720,IX,Swelled the boom of a distant bell
4721,IX,"Once, and the towers of the City of Pain"
4722,IX,"Echoed it, without hope or pity."
4723,IX,The tale of that tolling who can tell?
4724,IX,That dark old music who shall declare?
4725,IX,Who shall interpret the song of the bell?
4726,IX,
4727,IX,"_Is it nothing to you, all ye that hear_,"
4728,IX,"Sorrowed the bell, _Is it nothing to you?"
4729,IX,"Is it nothing to you?_ the shore-wind cried,"
4730,IX,_Is it nothing to you?_ the cliffs replied.
4731,IX,"But the low light laughed and the skies were blue,"
4732,IX,And this was only the song of the bell.

4739,ANWYL,A darkened easement in a darker room
4740,ANWYL,"Was all his home, whence weary and bowed and white"
4741,ANWYL,He watched across the slowly gathering gloom
4742,ANWYL,The slowly westering light.
4743,ANWYL,
4744,ANWYL,"Bitterness in his heavy-clouded eyes,"
4745,ANWYL,Bitterness as of heaven's intestine wars
4746,ANWYL,Brooded; he looked upon the unfathomed skies
4747,ANWYL,And whispered--to the stars--
4748,ANWYL,
4749,ANWYL,"Some day, he said, she will forget all this"
4750,ANWYL,"That she calls life, and looking far above"
4751,ANWYL,See throned among the great eternities
4752,ANWYL,"This dream of mine, this love;"
4753,ANWYL,
4754,ANWYL,Love that has given my soul these wings of fire
4755,ANWYL,"To beat in glory above the sapphire sea,"
4756,ANWYL,Until the wings of the infinite desire
4757,ANWYL,Close in infinity;
4758,ANWYL,
4759,ANWYL,"Love that has taken the glory of hawthorn boughs,"
4760,ANWYL,"And all the dreaming beauty of hazel skies,"
4761,ANWYL,As ministers to the radiance of her brows
4762,ANWYL,And haunted April eyes;
4763,ANWYL,
4764,ANWYL,Love that is hidden so deep beneath the dust
4765,ANWYL,"Of little daily duties and delights,"
4766,ANWYL,Till that reproachful face of hers grows just
4767,ANWYL,And God at last requites
4768,ANWYL,
4769,ANWYL,"A soul whose dream was deeper than the skies,"
4770,ANWYL,"A heart whose hope was wider than the sea,"
4771,ANWYL,Yet could not enter through his true love's eyes
4772,ANWYL,Their grey infinity.
4773,ANWYL,
4774,ANWYL,And so I know I wound her all day long
4775,ANWYL,Because my heart must seem so far away;
4776,ANWYL,And even my love completes the silent wrong
4777,ANWYL,For all that it can say
4778,ANWYL,
4779,ANWYL,Seems vast and meaningless to mortal sense;
4780,ANWYL,Its vague desire can never reach its goal
4781,ANWYL,Till knowledge vanishes in omniscience
4782,ANWYL,"And God surrounds her soul,"
4783,ANWYL,Breaking its barriers down and flooding in
4784,ANWYL,"Through all her wounds in one almighty tide,"
4785,ANWYL,Mingling her soul with that great Love wherein
4786,ANWYL,"My soul waits, glorified."

4800,ETAIN,And Time that writes what Pity dares not speak
4801,ETAIN,Around the fading eyes.
4802,ETAIN,
4803,ETAIN,He dreams he loves; but only loves his dream;
4804,ETAIN,And in his dream he never can forget
4805,ETAIN,Abana seems a so much mightier stream
4806,ETAIN,And Pharpar wider yet;
4807,ETAIN,
4808,ETAIN,The little deeds of love that light the shrine
4809,ETAIN,Of common daily duties with such gleams
4810,ETAIN,"Of heaven, to me are scarcely less divine"
4811,ETAIN,Than those poor wandering dreams
4812,ETAIN,
4813,ETAIN,"Of deeds that never happen! I give him this,"
4814,ETAIN,This heart he cannot find in heaven above;
4815,ETAIN,"This heart, this heart of all the eternities,"
4816,ETAIN,"This life of mine, this love;"
4817,ETAIN,
4818,ETAIN,Love that is lord of all the world at once
4819,ETAIN,And never bade the encircled spirit roam
4820,ETAIN,"To the circle's bound, beyond the moons and suns,"
4821,ETAIN,"But makes each heart its home,"
4822,ETAIN,"And every home the heart of Space and Time,"
4823,ETAIN,And each and all a heaven if love could reign;
4824,ETAIN,One infinite untranscended heaven sublime
4825,ETAIN,With God's own joy and pain.
4826,ETAIN,
4827,ETAIN,"Why, that was what God meant, to set us here"
4828,ETAIN,"In Eden, when he saw that all was good;"
4829,ETAIN,"And we have made the sun black with despair,"
4830,ETAIN,And turned the moon to blood.
4831,ETAIN,
4832,ETAIN,"So has Love taught me that too learnèd tongue,"
4833,ETAIN,And in his poorer wisdom made me wise;
4834,ETAIN,I grew so proud of the red drops we wrung
4835,ETAIN,From all philosophies.
4836,ETAIN,
4837,ETAIN,"My heart is narrow, foolish, what you will;"
4838,ETAIN,"But this I know God meant who set us here,"
4839,ETAIN,And gave each soul the Infinities to fulfil
4840,ETAIN,From its own widening sphere.
4841,ETAIN,
4842,ETAIN,"To annex new regions to the soul's domain,"
4843,ETAIN,"To expand the circle of the golden hours,"
4844,ETAIN,Till it enfolds again and yet again
4845,ETAIN,"New heavens, new fields, new flowers,"
4846,ETAIN,
4847,ETAIN,"Oh, this is well; but still the central heart"
4848,ETAIN,"Is here at home, not wandering like the wind"
4849,ETAIN,"That gathers nothing, but must still depart"
4850,ETAIN,Leaving a waste behind.
4851,ETAIN,
4852,ETAIN,"Where is the song I sang that April morn,"
4853,ETAIN,When all the poet in his eyes awoke
4854,ETAIN,My sleeping heart to heaven; and love was born?
4855,ETAIN,For while the glad day broke
4856,ETAIN,
4857,ETAIN,We met; and as the softly kindling skies
4858,ETAIN,Thrilled through the scented vistas of the wood
4859,ETAIN,I felt the sudden love-light in his eyes
4860,ETAIN,Kindle my beating blood.
4861,ETAIN,
4862,ETAIN,"_Happy day, happy day,"
4863,ETAIN,Chasing the clouds of the night away
4864,ETAIN,And bidding the dreams of the dawn depart
4865,ETAIN,"Over the freshening April blue,"
4866,ETAIN,"Till the blossoms awake to welcome the May,"
4867,ETAIN,And the world is made anew;
4868,ETAIN,And the blackbird sings on the dancing spray
4869,ETAIN,With eyes of glistening dew;
4870,ETAIN,"""Happy, happy, happy day;"""
4871,ETAIN,For he knows that his love is true;
4872,ETAIN,"He knows that his love is true, my heart,"
4873,ETAIN,He knows that his love is true!_
4874,ETAIN,
4875,ETAIN,"I cannot sing it: these tears blind me: love,"
4876,ETAIN,"O love, come back before it is too late,"
4877,ETAIN,"Why, even Christ came down to us from above:"
4878,ETAIN,I think His love was great;
4879,ETAIN,
4880,ETAIN,"Yet he stood knocking, knocking at the door"
4881,ETAIN,Until his piteous hands were worn with scars;
4882,ETAIN,He did not hide that crown of love he wore
4883,ETAIN,Among the lonely stars.
4884,ETAIN,
4885,ETAIN,"This round of hours, the daily flowers I cull"
4886,ETAIN,"Are more to me than all the rolling spheres,"
4887,ETAIN,A wounded bird at hand more pitiful
4888,ETAIN,Than some great seraph's tears.
4889,ETAIN,
4890,ETAIN,How should I join the great wise choir above
4891,ETAIN,"With my starved spirit's pale inhuman dearth,"
4892,ETAIN,Who never heard the cry of heavenly love
4893,ETAIN,Rise from the sweet-souled earth?
4894,ETAIN,
4895,ETAIN,"Yet it is I he needs, and I for whom"
4896,ETAIN,"His greed exceeds, his dreams fly wide of the mark!"
4897,ETAIN,Is it all self? I wander in the gloom;
4898,ETAIN,The ways of God grow dark;
4899,ETAIN,"I watch the rose that withers in the cheek,"
4900,ETAIN,The leaden rings that mark us old and wise;
4901,ETAIN,And Time that writes what Pity dares not speak
4902,ETAIN,Around the fading eyes.

4905,XII,XII
4906,XII,
4907,XII,And ever as Anwyl went the unknown end
4908,XII,"Faded before him, back and back and back"
4909,XII,He saw new empty heavens for ever bend
4910,XII,Over his endless track;
4911,XII,
4912,XII,"And memory, burning with new hopeless fire,"
4913,XII,Showed him how every passing infinite hour
4914,XII,Made some new Crucifix for the World's Desire
4915,XII,Is some new wayside flower:
4916,XII,
4917,XII,He saw what joy and beauty owed to death;
4918,XII,How all the world was one great sacrifice
4919,XII,"Of Him, in whom all creatures that draw breath"
4920,XII,Share God's eternal skies;
4921,XII,
4922,XII,How Love is lord of all the world at once;
4923,XII,And never bids the encircled spirit roam
4924,XII,"To the circle's bound, beyond the moons and suns,"
4925,XII,"But makes each heart its home,"
4926,XII,
4927,XII,"And every home the heart of Space and Time,"
4928,XII,And each and all a heaven if love could reign
4929,XII,One infinite untranscended heaven sublime
4930,XII,With God's own joy and pain.

4932,XII,
4933,XIII,XIII
4934,XIII,
4935,XIII,"Out of the deep, my dream, out of the deep,"
4936,XIII,A little child came to him in his sleep
4937,XIII,And led him back to what was Paradise
4938,XIII,"Before the years had darkened in his eyes,"
4939,XIII,And showed him what he ne'er could lose again--
4940,XIII,The light that once enshrined the child Etain.
4941,XIII,
4942,XIII,"Ah, was it Yrma with those radiant eyes"
4943,XIII,That came to greet and lead him through the skies;
4944,XIII,"Ay; all the world was one wide rose-white flame,"
4945,XIII,As down the path to meet him Yrma came
4946,XIII,"And caught the child up in her arms and cried,"
4947,XIII,"This is my child that moved in Etain's side,"
4948,XIII,Thy child and Etain's: I the unknown ideal
4949,XIII,"And she the rich, the incarnate, breathing real"
4950,XIII,Are one; for me thou never canst attain
4951,XIII,But by the love I yield thee for Etain;
4952,XIII,"Even as through Christ thy soul allays its dearth,"
4953,XIII,Love's heaven is only compassed upon earth;
4954,XIII,"And by that love, in thine own Etain's eyes"
4955,XIII,Thou shalt find all God's untranscended skies.
4956,XIII,
4957,XIII,"As of old, as of old, with Etain that day,"
4958,XIII,"Over the hills, and far away,"
4959,XIII,He roamed thro' the fairy forests of fern:
4960,XIII,Two young lovers were they.
4961,XIII,
4962,XIII,"And God sighed in the sunset, and the sea"
4963,XIII,Grew quieter than the hills: the mystery
4964,XIII,"Of ocean, earth and sky was like a word"
4965,XIII,"Uttered, but all unheard,"
4966,XIII,Uttered by every wave and cloud and leaf
4967,XIII,With all the immortal glory of mortal grief;
4968,XIII,And every wave that broke its heart of gold
4969,XIII,In music on the rainbow-dazzled shore
4970,XIII,"Seemed telling, strangely telling, evermore"
4971,XIII,A story that must still remain untold.
4972,XIII,
4973,XIII,"Oh, _Once upon a time_, and o'er and o'er"
4974,XIII,As aye the _Happy ever after_ came
4975,XIII,The enchanted waves lavished their faery lore
4976,XIII,
4977,XIII,And tossed a foam-bow and a rosy flame
4978,XIII,"Around the whispers of the creaming foam,"
4979,XIII,Till the old rapture with the new sweet name
4980,XIII,Through all the old romance began to roam.
4981,XIII,
4982,XIII,
4983,XIV,XIV
4984,XIV,
4985,XIV,And those two lovers only heard
4986,XIV,"--Oh, love is a dream that knows no waking--"
4987,XIV,"Far away, one secret bird,"
4988,XIV,"Where all the roses breathed one word,"
4989,XIV,And every crispel on the beach--
4990,XIV,"Oh, love is a sea that is ever breaking!--"
4991,XIV,Lisped it in a sweeter speech;
4992,XIV,"As hand in hand, by the sunset sea"
4993,XIV,"That breaks on the shores of mystery,"
4994,XIV,They stood in the gates of the City of Pain
4995,XIV,To watch the wild waves flutter and beat
4996,XIV,"In roses of white soft light at their feet,"
4997,XIV,"Roses of delicate music and light,"
4998,XIV,Music and moonlight under their feet.
4999,XIV,Crumbling and flashing and softly crashing
5000,XIV,In rainbow colours that dazzle and wane
5001,XIV,"And wither and waken and, wild with delight,"
5002,XIV,Dance and dance to a mystic tune
5003,XIV,And scatter their leaves in a flower-soft rain
5004,XIV,Over the shimmering golden shore
5005,XIV,"Between the West and the waking moon,"
5006,XIV,Between the sunset and the night;
5007,XIV,And then they sigh for the years of yore
5008,XIV,"And gather their glory together again,"
5009,XIV,"Petal by petal and gleam by gleam,"
5010,XIV,"Till, all in one rushing rose-bright stream"
5011,XIV,"They dazzle back to the deep once more,"
5012,XIV,"For the dream of the sea is an endless dream,"
5013,XIV,"And love is a sea that hath no shore,"
5014,XIV,And the roses dance as they danced before.
5015,XIV,
5016,XIV,
5017,XV,XV
5018,XV,
5019,XV,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago:"
5020,XV,Love that hath no beginning hath no end:
5021,XV,"Low to her heart he breathed it, sweet and low;"
5022,XV,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago;"
5023,XV,This is a word that all the sea-waves know
5024,XV,"And whisper as through the shoreless West they wend,"
5025,XV,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago:"
5026,XV,Love that hath no beginning hath no end.
5027,XV,
5028,XV,
5029,XVI,XVI
5030,XVI,
5031,XVI,"""Yet love can die!"" she murmured once again;"
5032,XVI,"For this was in that City by the Sea,"
5033,XVI,"That old grey City of Pain,"
5034,XVI,Built on the shifting shores of Mystery
5035,XVI,And mocked by all the immeasurable main.
5036,XVI,"""Love lives to die!"""
5037,XVI,Under the deep eternal sky
5038,XVI,His deeper voice caught up that deep refrain;
5039,XVI,
5040,XVI,"""A year ago, and under yonder sun"
5041,XVI,Earth had no Heaven to hold our hearts in one!
5042,XVI,"For me there was no love, afar or nigh:"
5043,XVI,"And, O, if love were thus in time begun,"
5044,XVI,"Love, even our love, in time must surely die."""
5045,XVI,"Then memory murmured, ""No"";"
5046,XVI,"And he remembered, a million years ago,"
5047,XVI,He saw the sea-waves wistfully westward wend;
5048,XVI,And heard her voice whispering in their flow
5049,XVI,And calling through the silent sunset-glow.
5050,XVI,_Love that hath no beginning hath no end._
5051,XVI,
5052,XVI,"""Love dies to live!"" How wild, how deep the joy"
5053,XVI,That knows no death can e'er destroy
5054,XVI,What cannot bear destruction! By these eyes
5055,XVI,"I know that, ere the fashioning of the skies,"
5056,XVI,Or ever the sun and moon and stars were made
5057,XVI,"I loved you. Sweet, I am no more afraid."
5058,XVI,
5059,XVI,"""Love lives to die!"""
5060,XVI,Under the deep eternal sky
5061,XVI,Her wild sweet voice caught up that deep refrain:
5062,XVI,"There, in that silent City by the Sea,"
5063,XVI,"Listening the wild-wave music of Infinity,"
5064,XVI,"There, in that old grey City of mortal pain,"
5065,XVI,Their voices mingled in mystic unison
5066,XVI,With that immortal harmony
5067,XVI,Which holds the warring worlds in one.
5068,XVI,
5069,XVI,"Their Voice, one Voice, yet manifold,"
5070,XVI,"Possessed the seas, the fields, the sky,"
5071,XVI,With utterance of the dream that cannot die;
5072,XVI,"Possessed the West's wild rose and dappled gold,"
5073,XVI,And that old secret of the setting sun
5074,XVI,"Which, to the glory of Eternity,"
5075,XVI,"Time, tolling like a distant bell,"
5076,XVI,"Evermore faints to tell,"
5077,XVI,"And, ever telling, never yet has told."
5078,XVI,"One, and yet manifold"
5079,XVI,"Arose their Voice, oh strangely one again"
5080,XVI,With murmurs of the immeasurable main;
5081,XVI,"As, far beyond earth's cloudy bars,"
5082,XVI,"Their Soul surpassed the sunset and the stars,"
5083,XVI,"And all the heights and depths of temporal pain,"
5084,XVI,Till seas of seraph music round them rolled.
5085,XVI,
5086,XVI,And in that mystic plane
5087,XVI,They felt their mortal years
5088,XVI,Break away as a dream of pain
5089,XVI,Breaks in a stream of tears.
5090,XVI,
5091,XVI,"Love, of whom life had birth,"
5092,XVI,"See now, is death not sweet?"
5093,XVI,"Love, is this heaven or earth?"
5094,XVI,Both are beneath thy feet.
5095,XVI,
5096,XVI,"Nay, both within thy heart!"
5097,XVI,"O Love, the glory nears;"
5098,XVI,"The Gates of Pearl are flung apart,"
5099,XVI,The Rose of Heaven appears.
5100,XVI,
5101,XVI,"Across the deeps of change,"
5102,XVI,"Like pangs of visible song,"
5103,XVI,"What angel-spirits, remote and strange,"
5104,XVI,Thrill through the starry throng?
5105,XVI,
5106,XVI,"And oh, what wind that blows"
5107,XVI,"Over the mystic Tree,"
5108,XVI,"What whisper of the sacred Rose,"
5109,XVI,"What murmur of the sapphire Sea,"
5110,XVI,What dreams that faint and fail
5111,XVI,"From harps of burning gold,"
5112,XVI,But tell in heaven the sweet old tale
5113,XVI,An earthly sunset told?
5114,XVI,
5115,XVI,Hark! like a holy bell
5116,XVI,"Over that spirit Sea,"
5117,XVI,"Time, in the world it loves so well,"
5118,XVI,Tolls for Eternity.
5119,XVI,
5120,XVI,"Earth calls us once again,"
5121,XVI,"And, through the mystic Gleam,"
5122,XVI,The grey old City of mortal pain
5123,XVI,Dawns on the heavenly dream.
5124,XVI,
5125,XVI,Sweet as the voice of birds
5126,XVI,"At dawn, the years return,"
5127,XVI,With little songs and sacred words
5128,XVI,Of human hearts that yearn.
5129,XVI,
5130,XVI,The sweet same waves resound
5131,XVI,Along our earthly shore;
5132,XVI,But now this earth we lost and found
5133,XVI,Is heaven for evermore.
5134,XVI,
5135,XVI,"Hark! how the cosmic choir,"
5136,XVI,"In sea and flower and sun,"
5137,XVI,Recalls that triumph of desire
5138,XVI,Which made all music one:
5139,XVI,
5140,XVI,"One universal soul,"
5141,XVI,"Completing joy with pain,"
5142,XVI,And harmonising with the Whole
5143,XVI,"The temporal refrain,"
5144,XVI,
5145,XVI,"Until from hill and plain,"
5146,XVI,"From bud and blossom and tree,"
5147,XVI,"From shadow and shining after rain,"
5148,XVI,"From cloud and clovered bee,"
5149,XVI,"From earth and sea and sky,"
5150,XVI,"From laughter and from tears,"
5151,XVI,One molten golden harmony
5152,XVI,Fulfils the yearning years.
5153,XVI,
5154,XVI,"_Love, of whom death had birth,"
5155,XVI,"See now, is life not sweet?"
5156,XVI,"Love, is this heaven or earth?"
5157,XVI,Both are beneath thy feet._
5158,XVI,
5159,XVI,"_In other worlds I loved you, long ago;"
5160,XVI,Love that hath no beginning hath no end;
5161,XVI,"The sea-waves whisper, low and sweet and low,"
5162,XVI,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago;"
5163,XVI,The May-boughs murmur and the roses know
5164,XVI,The message that the dawning moon shall send;
5165,XVI,"In other worlds I loved you, long ago;"
5166,XVI,Love that hath no beginning hath no end._

5273,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Now father stood engaged in talk
5274,THE SPLENDID SECRET,With mother on that narrow walk
5275,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Between the laurels (where we play
5276,THE SPLENDID SECRET,At Red-skins lurking for their prey)
5277,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And the grey old wall of roses
5278,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Where the Persian kitten dozes
5279,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And the sunlight sleeps upon
5280,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Crannies of the crumbling stone
5281,THE SPLENDID SECRET,--So hot it is you scarce can bear
5282,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Your naked hand upon it there,"
5283,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Though there luxuriating in heat
5284,THE SPLENDID SECRET,With a slow and gorgeous beat
5285,THE SPLENDID SECRET,White-winged currant-moths display
5286,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Their spots of black and gold all day.--
5287,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5288,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Well, since we greatly wished to know"
5289,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Whether we too might some day go
5290,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Where little Peterkin had gone
5291,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Without one word and all alone,"
5292,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We crept up through the laurels there
5293,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Hoping that we might overhear
5294,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The splendid secret, darkly great,"
5295,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Of Peterkin's mysterious fate;
5296,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And on what high adventure bound
5297,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He left our pleasant garden-ground,"
5298,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Whether for old Japan once more
5299,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He voyaged from the dim blue shore,"
5300,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Or whether he set out to run
5301,THE SPLENDID SECRET,By candle-light to Babylon.
5302,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5303,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We just missed something father said
5304,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"About a young prince that was dead,"
5305,THE SPLENDID SECRET,A little warrior that had fought
5306,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And failed: how hopes were brought to nought
5307,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He said, and mortals made to bow"
5308,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Before the Juggernaut of Death,"
5309,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And all the world was darker now,"
5310,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For Time's grey lips and icy breath
5311,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Had blown out all the enchanted lights
5312,THE SPLENDID SECRET,That burned in Love's Arabian nights;
5313,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And now he could not understand
5314,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Mother's mystic fairy-land,"
5315,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"""Land of the dead, poor fairy-tale,"""
5316,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He murmured, and her face grew pale,"
5317,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And then with great soft shining eyes
5318,THE SPLENDID SECRET,She leant to him--she looked so wise--
5319,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And, with her cheek against his cheek,"
5320,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"We heard her, ah so softly, speak."
5321,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5322,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"""Husband, there was a happy day,"
5323,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Long ago, in love's young May,"
5324,THE SPLENDID SECRET,When with a wild-flower in your hand
5325,THE SPLENDID SECRET,You echoed that dead poet's cry--
5326,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"'_Little flower, but if I could understand!_'"
5327,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky,"
5328,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And there in that smallest bud lay furled
5329,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The secret and meaning of all the world."""
5330,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5331,THE SPLENDID SECRET,He shook his head and then he tried
5332,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"To kiss her, but she only cried"
5333,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And turned her face away and said,"
5334,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"""You come between me and my dead!"
5335,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"His soul is near me, night and day,"
5336,THE SPLENDID SECRET,But you would drive it far away;
5337,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And you shall never kiss me now
5338,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Until you lift that brave old brow
5339,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Of faith I know so well; or else
5340,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Refute the tale the skylark tells,"
5341,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Tarnish the glory of that May,"
5342,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Explain the Smallest Flower away."""
5343,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And still he said, ""Poor fairy-tales,"
5344,THE SPLENDID SECRET,How terribly their starlight pales
5345,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Before the solemn sun of truth
5346,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"That rises o'er the grave of youth!"""
5347,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5348,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"""Is heaven a fairy-tale?"" she said,--"
5349,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And once again he shook his head;
5350,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And yet we ne'er could understand
5351,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Why heaven should _not_ be fairy-land,"
5352,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"A part of heaven at least, and why"
5353,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The thought of it made mother cry,"
5354,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And why they went away so sad,"
5355,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And father still quite unforgiven,"
5356,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For what could children be but glad
5357,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To find a fairy-land in heaven?
5358,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
5359,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And as we talked it o'er we found
5360,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Our brains were really spinning round;
5361,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"But Dick, our eldest, late returned"
5362,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"From school, by all the lore he'd learned"
5363,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Declared that we should seek the lost
5364,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Smallest Flower at any cost.
5365,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"For, since within its leaves lay furled"
5366,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The secret of the whole wide world,"
5367,THE SPLENDID SECRET,He thought that we might learn therein
5368,THE SPLENDID SECRET,The whereabouts of Peterkin;
5369,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And, if we found the Flower, we knew"
5370,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Father would be forgiven, too;"
5371,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And mother's kiss atone for all
5372,THE SPLENDID SECRET,The quarrel by the rose-hung wall;
5373,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"We knew, not how we knew not why,"
5374,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"But Dick it was who bade us try,"
5375,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Dick made it all seem plain and clear,"
5376,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And Dick it is who helps us here
5377,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To tell this tale of fairy-land
5378,THE SPLENDID SECRET,In words we scarce can understand.
5379,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For ere another golden hour
5380,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Had passed, our anxious parents found"
5381,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We'd left the scented garden-ground
5382,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To seek--the Smallest Flower.

5389,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"O, grown-ups cannot understand"
5390,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And grown-ups never will,"
5391,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,How short's the way to fairy-land
5392,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Across the purple hill:
5393,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"They smile: their smile is very bland,"
5394,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Their eyes are wise and chill;
5395,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And yet--at just a child's command--
5396,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The world's an Eden still.
5397,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5398,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Under the cloudy lilac-tree,"
5399,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Out at the garden-gate,"
5400,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We stole, a little band of three,"
5401,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To tempt our fairy fate.
5402,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"There was no human eye to see,"
5403,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,No voice to bid us wait;
5404,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The gardener had gone home to tea,"
5405,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The hour was very late.
5406,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5407,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"I wonder if you've ever dreamed,"
5408,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In summer's noonday sleep,"
5409,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of what the thyme and heather seemed
5410,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To ladybirds that creep
5411,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like little crimson shimmering gems
5412,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Between the tiny twisted stems
5413,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of fairy forests deep;
5414,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And what it looks like as they pass
5415,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through jungles of the golden grass.
5416,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5417,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,If you could suddenly become
5418,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"As small a thing as they,"
5419,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A midget-child, a new Tom Thumb,"
5420,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A little gauze-winged fay,"
5421,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Oh then, as through the mighty shades"
5422,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of wild thyme woods and violet glades
5423,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"You groped your forest-way,"
5424,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,How fraught each fragrant bough would be
5425,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,With dark o'erhanging mystery.
5426,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5427,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"How high the forest aisles would loom,"
5428,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,What wondrous wings would beat
5429,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through gloamings loaded with perfume
5430,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In many a rich retreat,"
5431,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,While trees like purple censers bowed
5432,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And swung beneath a swooning cloud
5433,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Mysteriously sweet,"
5434,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where flowers that haunt no mortal clime
5435,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Burden the Forest of Wild Thyme.
5436,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5437,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We'd watched the bats and beetles flit
5438,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through sunset-coloured air
5439,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The night that we discovered it
5440,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And all the heavens were bare:
5441,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We'd seen the colours melt and pass
5442,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like silent ghosts across the grass
5443,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To sleep--our hearts knew where;
5444,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And so we rose, and hand in hand"
5445,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We sought the gates of fairy-land.
5446,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5447,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"For Peterkin, oh Peterkin,"
5448,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The cry was in our ears,"
5449,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A fairy clamour, clear and thin"
5450,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From lands beyond the years;
5451,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A wistful note, a dying fall"
5452,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,As of the fairy bugle-call
5453,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Some dreamful changeling hears,"
5454,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And pines within his mortal home
5455,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Once more through fairy-land to roam.
5456,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5457,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We left behind the pleasant row
5458,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of cottage window-panes,"
5459,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The village inn's red-curtained glow,"
5460,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The lovers in the lanes;
5461,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And stout of heart and strong of will
5462,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We climbed the purple perfumed hill,"
5463,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And hummed the sweet refrains
5464,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of fairy tunes the tall thin man
5465,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Taught us of old in Old Japan.
5466,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5467,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,So by the tall wide-barred church-gate
5468,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through which we all could pass
5469,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We came to where that curious plate,"
5470,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"That foolish plate of brass,"
5471,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Said Peterkin was fast asleep
5472,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Beneath a cold and ugly heap
5473,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of earth and stones and grass.
5474,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"It was a splendid place for play,"
5475,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"That churchyard, on a summer's day;"
5476,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5477,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A splendid place for hide-and-seek
5478,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Between the grey old stones;
5479,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where even grown-ups used to speak
5480,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In awestruck whispering tones;
5481,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And here and there the grass ran wild
5482,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In jungles for the creeping child,"
5483,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And there were elfin zones
5484,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of twisted flowers and words in rhyme
5485,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And great sweet cushions of wild thyme.
5486,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5487,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,So in a wild thyme snuggery there
5488,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We stayed awhile to rest;
5489,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A bell was calling folk to prayer:
5490,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,One star was in the West:
5491,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The cottage lights grew far away,"
5492,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The whole sky seemed to waver and sway
5493,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Above our fragrant nest;
5494,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And from a distant dreamland moon
5495,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Once more we heard that fairy tune:
5496,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5497,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Why, mother once had sung it us"
5498,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"When, ere we went to bed,"
5499,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"She told the tale of Pyramus,"
5500,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,How Thisbe found him dead
5501,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And mourned his eyes as green as leeks,"
5502,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"His cherry nose, his cowslip cheeks."
5503,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5504,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That tune would oft around us float
5505,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Since on a golden noon
5506,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We saw the play that Shakespeare wrote
5507,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of Lion, Wall, and Moon;"
5508,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Ah, hark--the ancient fairy theme--"
5509,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,_Following darkness like a dream!_
5510,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5511,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The very song Will Shakespeare sang,"
5512,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The music that through Sherwood rang
5513,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And Arden and that forest glade
5514,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Where Hermie and Lysander strayed,"
5515,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And Puck cried out with impish glee,"
5516,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"_Lord, what fools these mortals be!_"
5517,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Though the masquerade was mute
5518,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of Quince and Snout and Snug and Flute,"
5519,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And Bottom with his donkey's head
5520,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Decked with roses, white and red,"
5521,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Though the fairies had forsaken
5522,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Sherwood now and faintly shaken
5523,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The forest-scents from off their feet,"
5524,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Yet from some divine retreat
5525,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Came the music, sweet and clear,"
5526,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To hang upon the raptured ear
5527,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,With the free unfettered sway
5528,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of blossoms in the moon of May.
5529,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Hark! the luscious fluttering
5530,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of flower-soft words that kiss and cling,"
5531,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And part again with sweet farewells,"
5532,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And rhyme and chime like fairy-bells.
5533,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5534,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"""_I know a bank where the wild thyme blows"
5535,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,"
5536,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,"
5537,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine._"""
5538,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5539,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Out of the undiscovered land
5540,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"So sweetly rang the song,"
5541,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We dreamed we wandered, hand in hand,"
5542,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The fragrant aisles along,"
5543,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where long ago had gone to dwell
5544,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In some enchanted distant dell
5545,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The outlawed fairy throng
5546,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,When out of Sherwood's wildest glen
5547,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"They sank, forsaking mortal men."
5548,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5549,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And as we dreamed, the shadowy ground"
5550,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Seemed gradually to swell;
5551,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And a strange forest rose around,"
5552,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,But how--we could not tell--
5553,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Purple against a rose-red sky
5554,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The big boughs brooded silently:
5555,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Far off we heard a bell;
5556,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And, suddenly, a great red light"
5557,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Smouldered before our startled sight.
5558,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5559,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Then came a cry, a fiercer flash,"
5560,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And down between the trees
5561,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We saw great crimson figures crash,"
5562,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Wild-eyed monstrosities;
5563,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Great dragon-shapes that breathed a flame
5564,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From roaring nostrils as they came:
5565,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We sank upon our knees;
5566,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And looming o'er us, ten yards high,"
5567,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like battle-ships they thundered by.
5568,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5569,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And then, as down that mighty dell"
5570,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We followed, faint with fear,"
5571,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We understood the tolling bell
5572,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That called the monsters there;
5573,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,For right in front we saw a house
5574,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Woven of wild mysterious boughs
5575,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Bursting out everywhere
5576,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In crimson flames, and with a shout"
5577,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The monsters rushed to put it out.
5578,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5579,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And, in a flash, the truth was ours;"
5580,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And there we knew--we knew--
5581,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The meaning of those trees like flowers,"
5582,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Those boughs of rose and blue,"
5583,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And from the world we'd left above
5584,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A voice came crooning like a dove
5585,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To prove the dream was true:
5586,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And this--we knew it by the rhyme
5587,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Must be--the Forest of Wild Thyme.
5588,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5589,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,For out of the mystical rose-red dome
5590,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of heaven the voice came murmuring down:
5591,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"_Oh, Ladybird, Ladybird, fly away home;"
5592,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Your house is on fire and your children are gone._
5593,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5594,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We knew, we knew it by the rhyme,"
5595,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Though _we_ seemed, after all,"
5596,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"No tinier, yet the sweet wild thyme"
5597,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Towered like a forest tall
5598,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"All round us; oh, we knew not how."
5599,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And yet--we knew those monsters now:
5600,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Our dream's divine recall
5601,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Had dwarfed us, as with magic words;"
5602,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The dragons were but ladybirds!
5603,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5604,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And all around us as we gazed,"
5605,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Half glad, half frightened, all amazed,"
5606,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The scented clouds of purple smoke
5607,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In lurid gleams of crimson broke;
5608,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And o'er our heads the huge black trees
5609,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Obscured the sky's red mysteries;
5610,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,While here and there gigantic wings
5611,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Beat o'er us, and great scaly things"
5612,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Fold over monstrous leathern fold
5613,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Out of the smouldering copses rolled;
5614,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And eyes like blood-red pits of flame
5615,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From many a forest-cavern came
5616,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To glare across the blazing glade,"
5617,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Till, with the sudden thought dismayed,"
5618,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We wondered if we e'er should find
5619,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The mortal home we left behind:
5620,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Fear clutched us in a grisly grasp,"
5621,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We gave one wild and white-lipped gasp,"
5622,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Then turned and ran, with streaming hair,"
5623,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Away, away, and anywhere!"
5624,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5625,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And hurry-skurry, heart and heel and hand, we tore along,"
5626,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And still our flying feet kept time and pattered on for Peterkin,"
5627,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"For Peterkin, oh Peterkin, it made a kind of song"
5628,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To prove the road was right although it seemed so dark and wrong,"
5629,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,As through the desperate woods we plunged and ploughed for little
5630,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Peterkin,"
5631,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where many a hidden jungle-beast made noises like a gong
5632,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That rolled and roared and rumbled as we rushed along to Peterkin.
5633,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
5634,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Peterkin, Peterkin, if you could only hear"
5635,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And answer us, one little word from little lonely Peterkin"
5636,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To take and comfort father, he is sitting in his chair"
5637,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In the library: he's listening for your footstep on the stair
5638,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And your patter down the passage, he can only think of Peterkin:"
5639,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Come back, come back to father, for to-day he'd let us tear"
5640,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,His newest book to make a paper-boat for little Peterkin.

5644,PART III,
5645,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT
5646,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5647,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Ah, what wonders round us rose"
5648,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"When we dared to pause and look,"
5649,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Curious things that seemed all toes,"
5650,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Goblins from a picture-book;
5651,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Ants like witches, four feet high,"
5652,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Waving all their skinny arms,"
5653,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Glared at us and wandered by,"
5654,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Muttering their ancestral charms.
5655,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5656,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Stately forms in green and gold
5657,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Armour strutted through the glades,"
5658,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Just as Hamlet's ghost, we're told,"
5659,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Mooned among the midnight shades:
5660,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5661,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Once a sort of devil came
5662,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Scattering broken trees about,"
5663,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Winged with leather, eyed with flame,--"
5664,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"He was but a moth, no doubt."
5665,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5666,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Here and there, above us clomb"
5667,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Feathery clumps of palm on high:
5668,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Those were ferns, of course, but some"
5669,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Really seemed to touch the sky;
5670,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Yes; and down one fragrant glade,"
5671,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Listening as we onward stole,"
5672,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Half delighted, half afraid,"
5673,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Dong_, we heard the hare-bells toll!"
5674,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5675,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Something told us what that gleam
5676,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Down the glen was brooding o'er;
5677,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Something told us in a dream
5678,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,What the bells were tolling for!
5679,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Something told us there was fear,"
5680,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Horror, peril, on our way!"
5681,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Was it far or was it near?
5682,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Near_, we heard the night-wind say."
5683,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5684,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Toll_, the music reeled and pealed"
5685,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Through the vast and sombre trees,"
5686,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Where a rosy light revealed
5687,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Dimmer, sweeter mysteries;"
5688,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"And, like petals of the rose,"
5689,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Fairy fans in beauty beat,"
5690,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Light in light--ah, what were those"
5691,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Rhymes we heard the night repeat?
5692,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5693,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Toll_, a dream within a dream,"
5694,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Up an aisle of rose and blue,"
5695,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Up the music's perfumed stream
5696,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Came the words, and then we knew,"
5697,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
5698,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Knew that in that distant glen
5699,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Once again the case was tried,"
5700,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Hark!--_Who killed Cock Robin, then?_"
5701,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"And a tiny voice replied,"
5702,"""_I","""_I"
5703,"""_I",killed
5704,"""_I",Cock
5705,"""_I","Robin!_"""
5706,"""_I",
5707,"""_I","""_I!_ And who are _You_, sir, pray?"""
5708,"""_I",Growled a voice that froze our marrow:
5709,"""_I","""Who!"" we heard the murderer say,"
5710,"""_I","""Lord, sir, I'm the famous Sparrow,"
5711,"""_I",And this 'ere's my bow and arrow!
5712,_I,_I
5713,_I,killed
5714,_I,Cock
5715,_I,"Robin!_"""
5716,_I,
5717,_I,"Then, with one great indrawn breath,"
5718,_I,Such a sighin' and a sobbin'
5719,_I,Rose all round us for the death
5720,_I,"Of poor, poor Cock Robin,"
5721,_I,"Oh, we couldn't bear to wait"
5722,_I,"Even to hear the murderer's fate,"
5723,_I,Which we'd often wished to know
5724,_I,Sitting in the fireside glow
5725,_I,And with hot revengeful looks
5726,_I,Searched for in the nursery-books;
5727,_I,For the Robin and the Wren
5728,_I,"Are such friends to mortal men,"
5729,_I,Such dear friends to mortal men!
5730,_I,
5731,_I,_Toll_; and through the woods once more
5732,_I,"Stole we, drenched with fragrant dew:"
5733,_I,_Toll_; the hare-bell's burden bore
5734,_I,Deeper meanings than we knew:
5735,_I,"Still it told us there was fear,"
5736,_I,"Horror, peril on our way!"
5737,_I,Was it far or was it near?
5738,_I,"_Near_, we heard the night-wind say!"
5739,_I,
5740,_I,_Near_; and once or twice we saw
5741,_I,"Something like a monstrous eye,"
5742,_I,Something like a hideous claw
5743,_I,Steal between us and the sky:
5744,_I,Still we hummed a dauntless tune
5745,_I,Trying to think such things might be
5746,_I,Glimpses of the fairy moon
5747,_I,Hiding in some hairy tree.
5748,_I,
5749,_I,Yet around us as we went
5750,_I,Through the glades of rose and blue
5751,_I,Sweetness with the horror blent
5752,_I,Wonder-wild in scent and hue:
5753,_I,"Here Aladdin's cavern yawned,"
5754,_I,Jewelled thick with gorgeous dyes;
5755,_I,There a head of clover dawned
5756,_I,Like a cloud In eastern skies.
5757,_I,
5758,_I,"Hills of topaz, lakes of dew,"
5759,_I,Fairy cliffs of crystal sheen
5760,_I,Passed we; and the forest's blue
5761,_I,Sea of branches tossed between:
5762,_I,Once we saw a gryphon make
5763,_I,One soft iris as it passed
5764,_I,Like the curving meteor's wake
5765,_I,"O'er the forest, far and fast."
5766,_I,
5767,_I,"Winged with purple, breathing flame,"
5768,_I,"Crimson-eyed we saw him go,"
5769,_I,Where--ah! could it be the same
5770,_I,Cockchafer we used to know?--
5771,_I,"Valley-lilies overhead,"
5772,_I,"High aloof in clustered spray,"
5773,_I,"Far through heaven their splendour spread,"
5774,_I,Glimmering like the Milky Way.
5775,_I,
5776,_I,"Mammoths father calls ""extinct,"""
5777,_I,"Creatures that the cave-men feared,"
5778,_I,"Through that forest walked and blinked,"
5779,_I,Through that jungle crawled and leered;
5780,_I,"Beasts no Nimrod ever knew,"
5781,_I,Woolly bears black and red;
5782,_I,"Crocodiles, we wondered who"
5783,_I,"Ever dared to see _them_ fed,"
5784,_I,
5785,_I,"Were they lizards? If they were,"
5786,_I,They could swallow _us_ with ease;
5787,_I,But they slumbered quietly there
5788,_I,In among the mighty trees;
5789,_I,"Red and silver, blue and green,"
5790,_I,Played the moonlight on their scales;
5791,_I,"Golden eyes they had, and lean"
5792,_I,Crookèd legs with cruel nails.
5793,_I,
5794,_I,"Yet again, oh, faint and far,"
5795,_I,"Came the shadow of a cry,"
5796,_I,Like the calling of a star
5797,_I,To its brother in the sky;
5798,_I,Like an echo in a cave
5799,_I,"Where young mermen sound their shells,"
5800,_I,Like the wind across a grave
5801,_I,Bright with scent of lily-bells.
5802,_I,
5803,_I,Like a fairy hunter's horn
5804,_I,Sounding in some purple glen
5805,_I,Sweet revelly to the morn
5806,_I,And the fairy quest again:
5807,_I,"Then, all round it surged a song"
5808,_I,We could never understand
5809,_I,"Though it lingered with us long,"
5810,_I,And it seemed so sad and grand.
5811,_I,
5812,_I,
5813,SONG,SONG
5814,SONG,
5815,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn,"
5816,SONG,Summon the day of deliverance in:
5817,SONG,We are weary of bearing the burden of scorn
5818,SONG,As we yearn for the home that we never shall win;
5819,SONG,For here there is weeping and sorrow and sin.
5820,SONG,And the poor and the weak are a spoil for the strong!
5821,SONG,"Ah, when shall the song of the ransomed begin?"
5822,SONG,The world is grown weary with waiting so long._
5823,SONG,
5824,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, you are gallant and brave,"
5825,SONG,There was never a doubt in those clear bright eyes.
5826,SONG,"Come, challenge the grim dark Gates of the Grave"
5827,SONG,As the skylark sings to those infinite skies!
5828,SONG,"This world is a dream, say the old and the wise,"
5829,SONG,And its rainbows arise o'er the false and the true;
5830,SONG,"But the mists of the morning are made of our sighs,--"
5831,SONG,"Ah, shatter them, scatter them, Little Boy Blue!_"
5832,SONG,
5833,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, if the child-heart knows,"
5834,SONG,Sound but a note as a little one may;
5835,SONG,"And the thorns of the desert shall bloom with the rose,"
5836,SONG,And the Healer shall wipe all tears away;
5837,SONG,"Little Boy Blue, we are all astray,"
5838,SONG,"The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn,"
5839,SONG,"Ah, set the world right, as a little one may;"
5840,SONG,"Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn!_"
5841,SONG,
5842,SONG,Yes; and there between the trees
5843,SONG,Circled with a misty gleam
5844,SONG,Like the light a mourner sees
5845,SONG,Round an angel in a dream;
5846,SONG,"Was it he? oh, brave and slim,"
5847,SONG,"Straight and clad in æry blue,"
5848,SONG,Lifting to his lips the dim
5849,SONG,Golden horn? We never knew!
5850,SONG,
5851,SONG,Never; for a witch's hair
5852,SONG,"Flooded all the moonlit sky,"
5853,SONG,"And he vanished, then and there,"
5854,SONG,In the twinkling of an eye:
5855,SONG,Just as either boyish cheek
5856,SONG,"Puffed to set the world aright,"
5857,SONG,Ere the golden horn could speak
5858,SONG,Round him flowed the purple night.
5859,SONG,
5860,SONG,*   *   *   *
5861,SONG,
5862,SONG,At last we came to a round black road
5863,SONG,"That tunnelled through the woods and showed,"
5864,SONG,"Or so we thought, a good clear way"
5865,SONG,Back to the upper lands of day;
5866,SONG,Great silken cables overhead
5867,SONG,In many a mighty mesh were spread
5868,SONG,"Netting the rounded arch, no doubt"
5869,SONG,To keep the weight of leafage out.
5870,SONG,"And, as the tunnel narrowed down,"
5871,SONG,So thick and close the cords had grown
5872,SONG,"No leaf could through their meshes stray,"
5873,SONG,And the faint moonlight died away;
5874,SONG,Only a strange grey glimmer shone
5875,SONG,"To guide our weary footsteps on,"
5876,SONG,"Until, tired out, we stood before"
5877,SONG,"The end, a great grey silken door."
5878,SONG,
5879,SONG,"Then from out a weird old wicket, overgrown with shaggy hair"
5880,SONG,"Like a weird and wicked eyebrow round a weird and wicked eye,"
5881,SONG,Two great eyeballs and a beard
5882,SONG,For one ghastly moment peered
5883,SONG,At our faces with a sudden stealthy stare:
5884,SONG,"Then the door was open wide,"
5885,SONG,And a hideous hermit cried
5886,SONG,"With a shy and soothing smile from out his lair,"
5887,SONG,_Won't you walk into my parlour? I can make you cosy there!_
5888,SONG,
5889,SONG,"And we couldn't quite remember where we'd heard that phrase before,"
5890,SONG,As the great grey-bearded ogre stood beside his open door;
5891,SONG,But an echo seemed to answer from a land beyond the sky--
5892,SONG,_Won't you walk into my parlour? said the spider to the fly!_
5893,SONG,
5894,SONG,Then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood
5895,SONG,"With his great red eyeballs glowing like two torches in a wood,"
5896,SONG,And his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws
5897,SONG,"And his nose--a horny parrot's beak, his whiskers and his jaws;"
5898,SONG,"Yet he seemed so sympathetic, and we saw two tears descend,"
5899,SONG,"As he murmured, ""I'm so ugly, but I've lost my dearest friend!"
5900,SONG,"I tell you most lymphatic'ly, I've yearnings in my soul,""--"
5901,SONG,And right along his parrot's beak we saw the tear-drops roll;
5902,SONG,"_He's an arrant sentimentalist_, we heard a distant sigh,"
5903,SONG,_Won't you weep upon my bosom? said the spider to the fly._
5904,SONG,
5905,SONG,"""If you'd dreamed my dreams of beauty, if you'd seen my works of art,"
5906,SONG,"If you'd felt the cruel hunger that is gnawing at my heart,"
5907,SONG,"And the grief that never leaves me and the love I can't forget,"
5908,SONG,(For I loved with all the letters in the Chinese alphabet!)
5909,SONG,"Oh, you'd all come in to comfort me: you ought to help the weak;"
5910,SONG,"And I'm full of melting moments; and--I--know--the--thing--you--seek!"""
5911,SONG,"And the haunting echo answered, _Well, I'm sure you ought to try;"
5912,SONG,"There's a duty to one's neighbour, said the spider to the fly._"
5913,SONG,
5914,SONG,So we walked into his parlour
5915,SONG,Though a gleam was in his eye;
5916,SONG,And it _was_ the prettiest parlour
5917,SONG,That ever we did spy!
5918,SONG,
5919,SONG,But we saw by the uncertain
5920,SONG,"Misty light, shot through with gleams"
5921,SONG,Of many a silken curtain
5922,SONG,"Broidered o'er with dreadful dreams,"
5923,SONG,That he locked the door behind us! So we stood with bated breath
5924,SONG,In a silence deep as death.
5925,SONG,
5926,SONG,There were scarlet gleams and crimson
5927,SONG,"In the curious foggy grey,"
5928,SONG,Like the blood-red light that swims on
5929,SONG,"Old canals at fall of day,"
5930,SONG,Where the smoke of some great city loops and droops in gorgeous veils
5931,SONG,Round the heavy purple barges' tawny sails.
5932,SONG,
5933,SONG,"Were those creatures gagged and muffled,"
5934,SONG,See--there--by that severed head?
5935,SONG,Was it but a breeze that ruffled
5936,SONG,"Those dark curtains, splashed with red,"
5937,SONG,"Ruffled the dark figures on them, made them moan like things in pain?"
5938,SONG,How we wished that we were safe at home again.
5939,SONG,
5940,SONG,*   *   *   *
5941,SONG,
5942,SONG,"""Oh, we want to hear of Peterkin; good sir, you say you know;"
5943,SONG,"Won't you tell us, won't you put us in the way we want to go?"""
5944,SONG,"So we pleaded, for he seemed so very full of sighs and tears"
5945,SONG,"That we couldn't doubt his kindness, and we smothered all our fears;"
5946,SONG,"But he said, ""You must be crazy if you come to me for help;"
5947,SONG,"Why should I desire to send you to your horrid little whelp?"""
5948,SONG,"And again, the foolish echo made a far-away reply,"
5949,SONG,"_Oh, don't come to me for comfort,"
5950,SONG,"Pray don't look to me for comfort,"
5951,SONG,"Heavens! you mustn't be so selfish, said the spider to the fly._"
5952,SONG,
5953,SONG,"""Still, when the King of Scotland, so to speak, was in a hole,"
5954,SONG,He was aided by my brother; it's a story to console
5955,SONG,"The convict of the treadmill and the infant with a sum,"
5956,SONG,For it teaches you to try again until your kingdom's come!
5957,SONG,The monarch dawdled in that hole for centuries of time
5958,SONG,Until my own twin-brother rose and showed him how to climb:
5959,SONG,He showed him how to swing and sway upon a tiny thread
5960,SONG,"Across a mighty precipice, and light upon his head"
5961,SONG,Without a single fracture and without a single pain
5962,SONG,"If he only did it frequently and tried and tried again:"""
5963,SONG,"And once again the whisper like a moral wandered by,"
5964,SONG,"_Perseverance is a virtue, said the spider to the fly._"
5965,SONG,
5966,SONG,"Then he moaned, ""My heart is hungry; but I fear I cannot eat,"
5967,SONG,(Of course I speak entirely now of spiritual meat!)
5968,SONG,"For I only fed an hour ago, but if we calmly sat"
5969,SONG,While I told you all my troubles in a confidential chat
5970,SONG,"It would give me _such_ an appetite to hear you sympathise,"
5971,SONG,"And I should sleep the better--see, the tears are in my eyes!"
5972,SONG,"Dead yearnings are such dreadful things, let's keep 'em all alive,--"
5973,SONG,"Let's sit and talk awhile, my dears; we'll dine, I think, at five."""
5974,SONG,"And he brought his chair beside us in his most engaging style,"
5975,SONG,And began to tell his story with a melancholy smile.--
5976,SONG,
5977,SONG,"""You remember Miss Muffet"
5978,SONG,Who sat on a tuffet
5979,SONG,Partaking of curds and whey;
5980,SONG,"Well, _I_ am the spider"
5981,SONG,Who sat down beside her
5982,SONG,And frightened Miss Muffet away!
5983,SONG,
5984,SONG,"""There was nothing against her!"
5985,SONG,An elderly spinster
5986,SONG,Were such a grammatical mate
5987,SONG,"For a spider and spinner,"
5988,SONG,"I swore I would win her,"
5989,SONG,I knew I had met with my fate!
5990,SONG,
5991,SONG,"""That love was the purest"
5992,SONG,And strongest and surest
5993,SONG,I'd felt since my first thread was spun;
5994,SONG,"I know I'm a bogey,"
5995,SONG,"But _she's_ an old fogey,"
5996,SONG,So why in the world did she run?
5997,SONG,
5998,SONG,"""When Bruce was in trouble,"
5999,SONG,"A spider, my double,"
6000,SONG,"Encouraged him greatly, they say!"
6001,SONG,"Now, _why_ should the spider"
6002,SONG,Who sat down beside her
6003,SONG,"Have frightened Miss Muffet away?"""
6004,SONG,
6005,SONG,"He seemed to have much more to tell,"
6006,SONG,"But we could scarce be listening well,"
6007,SONG,Although we tried with all our might
6008,SONG,To look attentive and polite;
6009,SONG,For still afar we heard the thin
6010,SONG,Clear fairy-call to Peterkin;
6011,SONG,Clear as a skylark's mounting song
6012,SONG,It drew our wandering thoughts along.
6013,SONG,"Afar, it seemed, yet, ah, so nigh,"
6014,SONG,"Deep in our dreams it scaled the sky,"
6015,SONG,In captive dreams that brooked no bars
6016,SONG,"It touched the love that moves the stars,"
6017,SONG,And with sweet music's golden tether
6018,SONG,It bound our hearts and heaven together.
6019,SONG,
6020,SONG,
6021,SONG,SONG
6022,SONG,
6023,SONG,"_Wake, arise, the lake, the skies"
6024,SONG,Fade into the faery day;
6025,SONG,"Come and sing before our king,"
6026,SONG,"Heed not Time, the dotard grey;"
6027,SONG,Time has given his crown to heaven--
6028,SONG,"Ah, how long? Awake, away!_"
6029,SONG,
6030,SONG,"Then, as the Hermit rambled on"
6031,SONG,"In one long listless monotone,"
6032,SONG,We heard a wild and mournful groan
6033,SONG,Come rumbling down the tunnelled way;
6034,SONG,"A voice, an awful mournful bray,"
6035,SONG,Singing some old funereal lay;
6036,SONG,"Then solemn footsteps, muffled, dull,"
6037,SONG,"Approached as if they trod on wool,"
6038,SONG,"And as they nearer, nearer drew,"
6039,SONG,We saw our Host was listening too!
6040,SONG,
6041,SONG,His bulging eyes began to glow
6042,SONG,"Like great red match-heads rubbed at night,"
6043,SONG,"And then he stole with a grim ""O-ho!"""
6044,SONG,"To that grey old wicket where, out of sight,"
6045,SONG,"Blandly rubbing his hands and humming,"
6046,SONG,"He could see, at one glance, whatever was coming."
6047,SONG,
6048,SONG,"He had never been so jubilant or frolicsome before,"
6049,SONG,As he scurried on his cruel hairy crutches to the door;
6050,SONG,And flung it open wide
6051,SONG,"And most hospitably cried,"
6052,SONG,"""Won't you walk into my parlour? I've some little friends to tea,--"
6053,SONG,"They'll be highly entertaining to a man of sympathy,"
6054,SONG,"Such as you yourself must be!"""
6055,SONG,
6056,SONG,"Then the man, for so he seemed,"
6057,SONG,(Doubtless one who'd lost his way
6058,SONG,And was dwarfed as we had been!)
6059,SONG,"In his ancient suit of black,"
6060,SONG,"Black upon the verge of green,"
6061,SONG,Entered like a ghost that dreamed
6062,SONG,Sadly of some bygone day;
6063,SONG,And he never ceased to sing
6064,SONG,In that awful mournful bray.
6065,SONG,
6066,SONG,The door closed behind his back;
6067,SONG,"He walked round us in a ring,"
6068,SONG,"And we hoped that he might free us,"
6069,SONG,"But his tears appeared to blind him,"
6070,SONG,"For he didn't seem to see us,"
6071,SONG,And the Hermit crept behind him
6072,SONG,Like a cat about to spring.
6073,SONG,
6074,SONG,And the song he sang was this;
6075,SONG,And his nose looked very grand
6076,SONG,"As he sang it, with a bliss"
6077,SONG,Which we could not understand;
6078,SONG,"For his voice was very sad,"
6079,SONG,While his nose was proud and glad.
6080,SONG,
6081,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain, thy sunny, sunny tears!"
6082,SONG,"Through the black boughs the robe of Spring appears,"
6083,SONG,"Yet, for the ghosts of all the bygone years,"
6084,SONG,"Rain, April, rain._"
6085,SONG,
6086,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain; the rose will soon be glad;"
6087,SONG,"Spring will rejoice, a Spring I, too, have had;"
6088,SONG,"A little while, till I no more be sad,"
6089,SONG,"Rain, April, rain._"
6090,SONG,
6091,SONG,And then the spider sprang
6092,SONG,"Before we could breathe or speak,"
6093,SONG,And one great scream out-rang
6094,SONG,As the terrible horny beak
6095,SONG,"Crunched into the Sad Man's head,"
6096,SONG,And the terrible hairy claws
6097,SONG,Clutched him around his middle;
6098,SONG,"And he opened his lantern-jaws,"
6099,SONG,"And he gave one twist, one twiddle,"
6100,SONG,"One kick, and his sorrow was dead."
6101,SONG,
6102,SONG,"And there, as he sucked his bleeding prey,"
6103,SONG,"The spider leered at us--""You will do,"
6104,SONG,"My sweet little dears, for another day;"
6105,SONG,"But this is the sort I like; huh! huh!"""
6106,SONG,
6107,SONG,"And there we stood, in frozen fear,"
6108,SONG,"Whiter than death,"
6109,SONG,With bated breath;
6110,SONG,"And lo! as we thought of Peterkin,"
6111,SONG,"Father and home and Peterkin,"
6112,SONG,"Once more that music clear and thin,"
6113,SONG,"Clear as a skylark's mounting song,"
6114,SONG,"But nearer now, more sweet, more strong,"
6115,SONG,"Drew all our wandering thoughts along,"
6116,SONG,"Until it seemed, a mystic sea"
6117,SONG,Of hidden delight and harmony
6118,SONG,Began to ripple and rise all round
6119,SONG,The prison where our hearts lay bound;
6120,SONG,And from sweet heaven's most rosy rim
6121,SONG,There swelled a distant marching hymn
6122,SONG,Which made the hideous Hermit pause
6123,SONG,"And listen with lank down-dropt jaws,"
6124,SONG,"Till, with great bulging eyes of fear,"
6125,SONG,He sought the wicket again to peer
6126,SONG,"Along the tunnel, as like sweet rain"
6127,SONG,"We heard the still approaching strain,"
6128,SONG,"And, under it, the rhythmic beat"
6129,SONG,Of multitudinous marching feet.
6130,SONG,"Nearer, nearer, they rippled and rang,"
6131,SONG,And this was the marching song they sang:--
6132,SONG,
6133,SONG,
6134,SONG,SONG
6135,SONG,
6136,SONG,_A fairy band are we
6137,SONG,In fairy-land:
6138,SONG,"Singing march we, hand in hand;"
6139,SONG,"Singing, singing all day long:"
6140,SONG,(Some folk never heard a fairy-song!)_
6141,SONG,
6142,SONG,"_Singing, singing,"
6143,SONG,When the merry thrush is swinging
6144,SONG,On a springing spray;
6145,SONG,Or when the witch that lives in gloomy caves
6146,SONG,And creeps by night among the graves
6147,SONG,Calls a cloud across the day;
6148,SONG,"Cease we never our fairy song,"
6149,SONG,"March we ever, along, along,"
6150,SONG,"Down the dale, or up the hill,"
6151,SONG,"Singing, singing still._"
6152,SONG,
6153,SONG,And suddenly the Hermit turned and ran with all his might
6154,SONG,Through the back-door of his parlour as we thought of little Peterkin;
6155,SONG,"And the great grey roof was shattered by a shower of rosy light,"
6156,SONG,"And the spider-house went floating, torn and tattered through the night"
6157,SONG,"In a flight of prismy streamers, as a shout went up for Peterkin;"
6158,SONG,"And lo, the glistening fairy-host stood there arrayed for fight,"
6159,SONG,"In arms of rose and green and gold, to lead us on to Peterkin."
6160,SONG,
6161,SONG,"And all around us, rippling like a pearl and opal sea,"
6162,SONG,The host of fairy faces winked a kindly hint of Peterkin;
6163,SONG,And all around the rosy glade a laugh of fairy glee
6164,SONG,Watched spider-streamers floating up from fragrant tree to tree
6165,SONG,"Till the moonlight caught the gossamers and, oh we wished for Peterkin!"
6166,SONG,Each rope became a rainbow; but it made us ache to see
6167,SONG,Such a fairy forest-pomp without explaining it to Peterkin.
6168,SONG,
6169,SONG,Then all the glittering crowd
6170,SONG,With a courtly gesture bowed
6171,SONG,Like a rosy jewelled cloud
6172,SONG,"Round a flame,"
6173,SONG,"As the King of Fairy-land,"
6174,SONG,"Very dignified and grand,"
6175,SONG,Stepped forward to demand
6176,SONG,Whence we came.
6177,SONG,
6178,SONG,He'd a cloak of gold and green
6179,SONG,"Such as caterpillars spin,"
6180,SONG,"For the fairy ways, I ween,"
6181,SONG,Are very frugal;
6182,SONG,He'd a bow that he had borne
6183,SONG,"Since the crimson Eden morn,"
6184,SONG,And a honeysuckle horn
6185,SONG,For his bugle.
6186,SONG,
6187,SONG,"So we told our tale of faëry to the King of Fairy-land,"
6188,SONG,And asked if he could let us know the latest news of Peterkin;
6189,SONG,And he turned him with a courtly smile and waved his jewelled wand
6190,SONG,"And cried, _Pease-blossom, Mustard-seed! You know the old command;"
6191,SONG,Well; these are little children; you must lead them on to Peterkin._
6192,SONG,"Then he knelt, the King of Faëry knelt; his eyes were great and grand"
6193,SONG,"As he took our hands and kissed them, saying, _Father loves your"
6194,SONG,Peterkin!_
6195,SONG,
6196,SONG,"So out they sprang, on either side,"
6197,SONG,"A light fantastic fairy guide,"
6198,SONG,To lead us to the land unknown
6199,SONG,Where little Peterkin was gone;
6200,SONG,"And, as we went with timid pace,"
6201,SONG,We saw that every fairy face
6202,SONG,In all that moonlit host was wet
6203,SONG,With tears: we never shall forget
6204,SONG,The mystic hush that seemed to fade
6205,SONG,"Away like sound, as down the glade"
6206,SONG,We passed beyond their zone of light.
6207,SONG,Then through the forest's purple night
6208,SONG,"We trotted, at a pleasant speed,"
6209,SONG,With gay Pease-blossom and Mustard-seed.
6210,SONG,
6211,SONG,
6212,PART IV,PART IV
6213,PART IV,
6214,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED
6215,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6216,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Shyly we surveyed our guides
6217,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As through the gloomy woods we went
6218,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,In the light that the straggling moonbeams lent:
6219,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,We envied them their easy strides!
6220,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Pease-blossom in his crimson cap
6221,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And delicate suit of rose-leaf green,"
6222,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"His crimson sash and his jewelled dagger,"
6223,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Strutted along with an elegant swagger
6224,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Which showed that he didn't care one rap
6225,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For anything less than a Fairy Queen:
6226,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"His eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet,"
6227,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Although his crisp and curly hair
6228,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Certainly didn't seem to show it!
6229,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,While Mustard-seed was a devil-may-care
6230,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Epigrammatic and pungent fellow
6231,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Clad in a splendid suit of yellow,"
6232,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With emerald stars on his glittering breast
6233,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And eyes that shone with a diamond light:
6234,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,They made you feel sure it would always be best
6235,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,To tell him the truth: he was not perhaps _quite_
6236,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"So polite as Pease-blossom, but then who could be"
6237,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,_Quite_ such a debonair fairy as he?
6238,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6239,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,We never could tell you one-half that we heard
6240,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And saw on that journey. For instance, a bird"
6241,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Ten times as big as an elephant stood
6242,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,By the side of a nest like a great thick wood:
6243,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The clouds in glimmering wreaths were spread
6244,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Behind its vast and shadowy head
6245,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Which rolled at us trembling below. (Its eyes
6246,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Were like great black moons in those pearl-pale skies.)
6247,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And we feared he might take us, perhaps, for a worm."
6248,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6249,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"But he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm,"
6250,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And snuggled his head with a careless disdain
6251,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Under his huge hunched wing again;
6252,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And Mustard-seed said, as we stole thro' the dark,"
6253,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,There was nothing to fear: it was only a Lark!
6254,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6255,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And so he cheered the way along
6256,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"With many a neat little epigram,"
6257,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,While dear Pease-blossom before him swam
6258,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"On a billow of lovely moonlit song,"
6259,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Telling us why they had left their home
6260,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"In Sherwood, and had hither come"
6261,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"To dwell in this magical scented clime,"
6262,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"This dim old Forest of sweet Wild Thyme,"
6263,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6264,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"""Men toil,"" he said, ""from morn till night"
6265,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With bleeding hands and blinded sight
6266,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For gold, more gold! They have betrayed"
6267,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The trust that in their souls was laid;
6268,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Their fairy birthright they have sold
6269,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For little disks of mortal gold;
6270,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And now they cannot even see
6271,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"The gold upon the greenwood tree,"
6272,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The wealth of coloured lights that pass
6273,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"In soft gradations through the grass,"
6274,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The riches of the love untold
6275,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That wakes the day from grey to gold;
6276,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And howsoe'er the moonlight weaves
6277,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Magic webs among the leaves
6278,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Englishmen care little now
6279,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For elves beneath the hawthorn bough:
6280,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Nor if Robin should return
6281,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Dare they of an outlaw learn;
6282,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For them the Smallest Flower is furled,"
6283,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Mute is the music of the world;
6284,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And unbelief has driven away
6285,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Beauty from the blossomed spray."""
6286,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6287,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Then Mustard-seed with diamond eyes
6288,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Taught us to be laughter-wise,"
6289,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And he showed us how that Time
6290,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Is much less powerful than a rhyme;
6291,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And that Space is but a dream;
6292,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"""For look,"" he said, with eyes agleam,"
6293,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"""Now you are become so small"
6294,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You think the Thyme a forest tall;
6295,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,But underneath your feet you see
6296,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A world of wilder mystery
6297,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Where, if you were smaller yet,"
6298,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You would just as soon forget
6299,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"This forest, which you'd leave above"
6300,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As you have left the home you love!
6301,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For, since the Thyme you used to know"
6302,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Seems a forest here below,"
6303,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,What if you should sink again
6304,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And find there stretched a mighty plain
6305,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Between each grass-blade and the next?
6306,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You'd think till you were quite perplexed!
6307,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Especially if all the flowers
6308,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That lit the sweet Thyme-forest bowers
6309,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Were in that wild transcendent change
6310,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Turned to Temples, great and strange,"
6311,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With many a pillared portal high
6312,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And domes that swelled against the sky!
6313,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"How foolish, then, you will agree,"
6314,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Are those who think that all must see
6315,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"The world alike, or those who scorn"
6316,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Another who, perchance, was born"
6317,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Where--in a different dream from theirs--
6318,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,What they call sins to him are prayers!
6319,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6320,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"""We cannot judge; we cannot know;"
6321,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,All things mingle; all things flow;
6322,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,There's only one thing constant here--
6323,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Love--that untranscended sphere:
6324,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Love, that while all ages run"
6325,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Holds the wheeling worlds in one;
6326,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Love that, as your sages tell,"
6327,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Soars to heaven and sinks to hell."""
6328,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6329,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Even as he spoke, we seemed to grow"
6330,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Smaller, the Thyme trees seemed to go"
6331,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Farther away from us: new dreams
6332,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Flashed out on us with mystic gleams
6333,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Of mighty Temple-domes: deep awe
6334,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Held us all breathless as we saw
6335,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A carven portal glimmering out
6336,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Between new flowers that put to rout
6337,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Our other fancies: in sweet fear
6338,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"We tiptoed past, and seemed to hear"
6339,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A sound of singing from within
6340,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That told our souls of Peterkin:
6341,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Our thoughts of _him_ were still the same
6342,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Howe'er the shadows went and came,"
6343,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"So, on we wandered, hand in hand,"
6344,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And all the world was fairy-land.

6347,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
6348,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And as we went we seemed to hear
6349,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Surging up from distant dells
6350,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"A solemn music, soft and clear"
6351,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As if a field of lily-bells
6352,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Were tolling all together, sweet"
6353,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,But sad and low and keeping time
6354,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,To multitudinous marching feet
6355,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With a slow funereal beat
6356,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And a deep harmonious chime
6357,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That told us by its dark refrain
6358,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The reason fairies suffered pain.

6374,SONG,Men upon earth
6375,SONG,Bring us to birth
6376,SONG,Gently at even and morn!
6377,SONG,When as brother and brother
6378,SONG,They greet one another
6379,SONG,And smile--then a fairy is born!
6380,SONG,
6381,SONG,But at each cruel word
6382,SONG,"Upon earth that is heard,"
6383,SONG,"Each deed of unkindness or hate,"
6384,SONG,Some fairy must pass
6385,SONG,From the games in the grass
6386,SONG,And steal thro' the terrible Gate.
6387,SONG,
6388,SONG,_Passing away--flower from the spray! Colour and light from the leaf!

6393,SONG,All the wrong that ye do
6394,SONG,"By the thought that ye harbour alone,"
6395,SONG,How the face of some fairy
6396,SONG,Grows wistful and weary
6397,SONG,And the heart in her cold as a stone!
6398,SONG,"Ah, she was born"
6399,SONG,Blithe as the morn
6400,SONG,"Under an April sky,"
6401,SONG,Born of the greeting
6402,SONG,Of two lovers meeting.
6403,SONG,"They parted, and so she must die."
6404,SONG,
6405,SONG,_Passing away--flower from the spray! Colour and light from the leaf!

6408,SONG,
6409,SONG,"Cradled in blisses,"
6410,SONG,"Yea, born of your kisses,"
6411,SONG,"Oh, ye lovers that met by the moon,"
6412,SONG,She would not have cried
6413,SONG,In the darkness and died
6414,SONG,If ye had not forgotten so soon.
6415,SONG,
6416,SONG,"Cruel mortals, they say,"
6417,SONG,"Live for ever and aye,"
6418,SONG,And they pray in the dark on their knees.
6419,SONG,But the flowers that are fled
6420,SONG,"And the loves that are dead,"
6421,SONG,What heaven takes pity on these?
6422,SONG,
6423,SONG,_Bear her along--singing your song--tender and sweet and low!

6427,SONG,Flower from the spray!
6428,SONG,Colour and light from the leaf!
6429,SONG,"Soon, soon will the year"

6434,SONG,
6435,SONG,Then we came through a glittering crystal grot
6436,SONG,"By a path like, a pale moonbeam,"
6437,SONG,And a broad blue bridge of Forget-me-not
6438,SONG,"Over a shimmering stream,"
6439,SONG,"To where, through the deep blue dusk, a gleam"
6440,SONG,Rose like the soul of the setting sun;
6441,SONG,"A sunset breaking through the earth,"
6442,SONG,"A crimson sea of the poppies of dream,"
6443,SONG,Deep as the sleep that gave them birth
6444,SONG,In the night where all earthly dreams are done.
6445,SONG,
6446,SONG,"And then, like a pearl-pale porch of the moon,"
6447,SONG,"Faint and sweet as a starlit shrine,"
6448,SONG,Over the gloom
6449,SONG,Of the crimson bloom
6450,SONG,We saw the Gates of Ivory shine;
6451,SONG,"And, lulled and lured by the lullaby tune"
6452,SONG,Of the cradling airs that drowsily creep
6453,SONG,"From blossom to blossom, and lazily croon"
6454,SONG,"Through the heart of the midnight's mystic noon,"
6455,SONG,We came to the Gates of the City of Sleep.
6456,SONG,
6457,SONG,Faint and sweet as a lily's repose
6458,SONG,"On the broad black breast of a midnight lake,"
6459,SONG,The City delighted the cradling night:
6460,SONG,Like a straggling palace of cloud it rose;
6461,SONG,The towers were crowned with a crystal light
6462,SONG,Like the starry crown of a white snowflake
6463,SONG,"As they pierced in a wild white pinnacled crowd,"
6464,SONG,Through the dusky wreaths of enchanted cloud
6465,SONG,That swirled all round like a witch's hair.
6466,SONG,
6467,SONG,"And we heard, as the sound of a great sea sighing,"
6468,SONG,The sigh of the sleepless world of care;
6469,SONG,And we saw strange shadowy figures flying
6470,SONG,Up to the Ivory Gates and beating
6471,SONG,"With pale hands, long and famished and thin;"
6472,SONG,Like blinded birds we saw them dash
6473,SONG,Against the cruelly gleaming wall:
6474,SONG,We heard them wearily moan and call
6475,SONG,With sharp starved lips for ever entreating
6476,SONG,The pale doorkeeper to let them in.
6477,SONG,
6478,SONG,"And still, as they beat, again and again,"
6479,SONG,We saw on the moon-pale lintels a splash
6480,SONG,Of crimson blood like a poppy-stain
6481,SONG,Or a wild red rose from the gardens of pain
6482,SONG,That sigh all night like a ghostly sea
6483,SONG,From the City of Sleep to Gethsemane.
6484,SONG,
6485,SONG,"And lo, as we neared the mighty crowd"
6486,SONG,"An old blind man came, crying aloud"
6487,SONG,"To greet us, as once the blind man cried"
6488,SONG,In the Bible picture--you know we tried
6489,SONG,"To paint that print, with its Eastern sun;"
6490,SONG,"But the reds and the yellows _would_ mix and run,"
6491,SONG,And the blue of the sky made a horrible mess
6492,SONG,Right over the edge of the Lord's white dress.
6493,SONG,"And the old blind man, just as though he had eyes,"
6494,SONG,Came straight to meet us; and all the cries
6495,SONG,Of the crowd were hushed; and a strange sweet calm
6496,SONG,Stole through the air like a breath of the balm
6497,SONG,That was wafted abroad from the Forest of Thyme
6498,SONG,(For it rolled all round that curious clime
6499,SONG,With its magical clouds of perfumed trees.)
6500,SONG,"And the blind man cried, ""Our help is at hand,"
6501,SONG,"Oh, brothers, remember the old command,"
6502,SONG,"Remember the frankincense and myrrh,"
6503,SONG,"Make way, make way for those little ones there;"
6504,SONG,"Make way, make way, I have seen them afar"
6505,SONG,Under a great white Eastern star;
6506,SONG,"For I am the mad blind man who sees!"""
6507,SONG,"Then he whispered, softly--_Of such as these_;"
6508,SONG,And through the hush of the cloven crowd
6509,SONG,"We passed to the gates of the City, and there"
6510,SONG,Our fairy heralds cried aloud--
6511,SONG,_Open your Gates; don't stand and stare;
6512,SONG,These are the Children for whom our King
6513,SONG,Made all the star-worlds dance in a ring!_
6514,SONG,
6515,SONG,"And lo, like a sorrow that melts from the heart"
6516,SONG,"In tears, the slow gates melted apart;"
6517,SONG,And into the City we passed like a dream;
6518,SONG,"And then, in one splendid marching stream"
6519,SONG,The whole of that host came following through.
6520,SONG,"We were only children, just like you;"
6521,SONG,"Children, ah, but we felt so grand"
6522,SONG,As we led them--although we could understand
6523,SONG,Nothing at all of the wonderful song
6524,SONG,That rose all round as we marched along.
6525,SONG,
6526,SONG,
6527,SONG,SONG
6528,SONG,
6529,SONG,_You that have seen how the world and its glory
6530,SONG,Change and grow old like the love of a friend;
6531,SONG,"You that have come to the end of the story,"
6532,SONG,You that were tired ere you came to the end;
6533,SONG,"You that are weary of laughter and sorrow,"
6534,SONG,"Pain and pleasure, labour and sin,"
6535,SONG,"Sick of the midnight and dreading the morrow,"
6536,SONG,"Ah, come in; come in._"
6537,SONG,
6538,SONG,_You that are bearing the load of the ages;
6539,SONG,You that have loved overmuch and too late;
6540,SONG,You that confute all the saws of the sages;
6541,SONG,"You that served only because you must wait,"
6542,SONG,Knowing your work was a wasted endeavour;
6543,SONG,"You that have lost and yet triumphed therein,"
6544,SONG,Add loss to your losses and triumph for ever;
6545,SONG,"Ah, come in; come in._"
6546,SONG,
6547,SONG,"And we knew as we went up that twisted street,"
6548,SONG,"With its violet shadows and pearl-pale walls,"
6549,SONG,"We were coming to Something strange and sweet,"
6550,SONG,For the dim air echoed with elfin calls;
6551,SONG,"And, far away, in the heart of the City,"
6552,SONG,"A murmur of laughter and revelry rose,--"
6553,SONG,"A sound that was faint as the smile of Pity,"
6554,SONG,And sweet as a swan-song's golden close.
6555,SONG,
6556,SONG,"And then, once more, as we marched along,"
6557,SONG,There surged all round us that wonderful song;
6558,SONG,And it swung to the tramp of our marching feet
6559,SONG,"But ah, it was tenderer now and so sweet"
6560,SONG,"That it made our eyes grow wet and blind,"
6561,SONG,"And the whole wide-world seem mother-kind,"
6562,SONG,"Folding us round with a gentle embrace,"
6563,SONG,And pressing our souls to her soft sweet face.
6564,SONG,
6565,SONG,
6566,SONG,SONG
6567,SONG,
6568,SONG,"_Dreams; dreams; ah, the memory blinding us,"
6569,SONG,Blinding our eyes to the way that we go;
6570,SONG,"Till the new sorrow come, once more reminding us"
6571,SONG,"Blindly of kind hearts, ours long ago:"
6572,SONG,"Mother-mine, whisper we, yours was the love for me!"
6573,SONG,"Still, though our paths lie lone and apart,"
6574,SONG,"Yours is the true love, shining above for me,"
6575,SONG,"Yours are the kind eyes, hurting my heart._"
6576,SONG,
6577,SONG,"_Dreams; dreams; ah, how shall we sing of them,"
6578,SONG,Dreams that we loved with our head on her breast:
6579,SONG,Dreams; dreams; and the cradle-sweet swing of them;
6580,SONG,"Ay, for her voice was the sound we loved best:"
6581,SONG,"Can we remember at all or, forgetting it,"
6582,SONG,Can we recall for a moment the gleam
6583,SONG,"Of our childhood's delight and the wonder begetting it,"
6584,SONG,Wonder awakened in dreams of a dream?_
6585,SONG,
6586,SONG,"And once again, from the heart of the City"
6587,SONG,"A murmur of tenderer laughter rose,"
6588,SONG,"A sound that was faint as the smile of Pity,"
6589,SONG,And sweet as a swan-song's golden close;
6590,SONG,And it seemed as if some wonderful Fair
6591,SONG,"Were charming the night of the City of Dreams,"
6592,SONG,"For, over the mystical din out there,"
6593,SONG,"The clouds were litten with flickering gleams,"
6594,SONG,And a roseate light like the day's first flush
6595,SONG,"Quivered and beat on the towers above,"
6596,SONG,And we heard through the curious crooning hush
6597,SONG,An elfin song that we used to love.
6598,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn ..._"
6599,SONG,And the soft wind blew it the other way;
6600,SONG,So all that we heard was--_Cow's in the corn_;
6601,SONG,But we never heard anything half so gay!
6602,SONG,And ever we seemed to be drawing nearer
6603,SONG,"That mystical roseate smoke-wreathed glare,"
6604,SONG,"And the curious music grew louder and clearer,"
6605,SONG,"Till mustard-seed said, ""We are lucky, you see,"
6606,SONG,"We've arrived at a time of festivity!"""
6607,SONG,"And so to the end of the street we came,"
6608,SONG,"And turned a corner, and--there we were,"
6609,SONG,"In a place that glowed like the dawn of day,"
6610,SONG,A crowded clamouring City square
6611,SONG,"Like the cloudy heart of an opal, aflame"
6612,SONG,With the lights of a great Dream-Fair:
6613,SONG,"Thousands of children were gathered there,"
6614,SONG,"Thousands of old men, weary and grey,"
6615,SONG,And the shouts of the showmen filled the air--
6616,SONG,This way! This way! This way!
6617,SONG,
6618,SONG,"And _See-Saw_; _Margery Daw_; we heard a rollicking shout,"
6619,SONG,As the swing-boats hurtled over our heads to the tune of the roundabout;
6620,SONG,"And _Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn_, we heard the showmen cry,"
6621,SONG,"And _Dickory Dock, I'm as good as a clock_, we heard the swings reply."
6622,SONG,
6623,SONG,"This way, this way to your Heart's Desire;"
6624,SONG,"Come, cast your burdens down;"
6625,SONG,"And the pauper shall mount his throne in the skies,"
6626,SONG,And the king be rid of his crown:
6627,SONG,And souls that were dead shall be fed with fire
6628,SONG,"From the fount of their ancient pain,"
6629,SONG,And your lost love come with the light in her eyes
6630,SONG,Back to your heart again.
6631,SONG,
6632,SONG,"Ah, here be sure she shall never prove"
6633,SONG,Less kind than her eyes were bright;
6634,SONG,"This way, this way to your old lost love,"
6635,SONG,You shall kiss her lips to-night;
6636,SONG,This way for the smile of a dead man's face
6637,SONG,"And the grip of a brother's hand,"
6638,SONG,This way to your childhood's heart of grace
6639,SONG,And your home in Fairy-land.
6640,SONG,
6641,SONG,"_Dickory Dock, I'm as good as a clock_, d'you hear my swivels chime?"
6642,SONG,"To and fro as I come and go, I keep eternal time."
6643,SONG,"O, little Bo-peep, if you've lost your sheep and don't know where"
6644,SONG,"to find 'em,"
6645,SONG,"Leave 'em alone and they'll come home, and carry their tails behind 'em."
6646,SONG,
6647,SONG,"And _See-Saw; Margery Daw_; there came the chorussing shout,"
6648,SONG,As the swing-boats answered the roaring tune of the rollicking
6649,SONG,roundabout;
6650,SONG,"Dickory, dickory, dickory, dock, d'you hear my swivels chime?"
6651,SONG,Swing; swing; you're as good as a king if you keep eternal time.
6652,SONG,
6653,SONG,Then we saw that the tunes of the world were one;
6654,SONG,And the metre that guided the rhythmic sun
6655,SONG,"Was at one, like the ebb and the flow of the sea,"
6656,SONG,With the tunes that we learned at our mother's knee;
6657,SONG,The beat of the horse-hoofs that carried us down
6658,SONG,To see the fine Lady of Banbury Town;
6659,SONG,"And so, by the rhymes that we knew, we could tell"
6660,SONG,Without knowing the others--that all was well.
6661,SONG,
6662,SONG,"And then, our brains began to spin;"
6663,SONG,For it seemed as if that mighty din
6664,SONG,Were no less than the cries of the poets and sages
6665,SONG,Of all the nations in all the ages;
6666,SONG,"And, if they could only beat out the whole"
6667,SONG,"Of their music together, the guerdon and goal"
6668,SONG,"Of the world would be reached with one mighty shout,"
6669,SONG,And the dark dread secret of Time be out;
6670,SONG,"And nearer, nearer they seemed to climb,"
6671,SONG,"And madder and merrier rose the song,"
6672,SONG,And the swings and the see-saws marked the time;
6673,SONG,For this was the maddest and merriest throng
6674,SONG,That ever was met on a holy-day
6675,SONG,To dance the dust of the world away;
6676,SONG,"And madder and merrier, round and round"
6677,SONG,"The whirligigs whirled to the whirling sound,"
6678,SONG,Till it seemed that the mad song burst its bars
6679,SONG,"And mixed with the song of the whirling stars,"
6680,SONG,The song that the rhythmic Time-Tides tell
6681,SONG,To seraphs in Heaven and devils in Hell;
6682,SONG,Ay; Heaven and Hell in accordant chime
6683,SONG,With the universal rhythm and rhyme
6684,SONG,Were nearing the secret of Space and Time;
6685,SONG,The song of that ultimate mystery
6686,SONG,"Which only the mad blind men who see,"
6687,SONG,"Led by the laugh of a little child,"
6688,SONG,"Can utter; ay, wilder and yet more wild"
6689,SONG,"It maddened, till now--full song--it was out!"
6690,SONG,It roared from the starry roundabout--
6691,SONG,
6692,SONG,"_A child was born in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem,"
6693,SONG,"A child was born in Bethlehem; ah, hear my fairy fable;"
6694,SONG,"For I have seen the King of Kings, no longer thronged with angel wings,"
6695,SONG,"But crooning like a little babe, and cradled in a stable._"
6696,SONG,
6697,SONG,_The wise men came to greet him with their gifts of myrrh
6698,SONG,"and frankincense,--"
6699,SONG,Gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth;
6700,SONG,"And would you know the way to win to little brother Peterkin,"
6701,SONG,My childhood's heart shall guide you through the glories of
6702,SONG,the earth._
6703,SONG,
6704,SONG,"_A child was born in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem;"
6705,SONG,The wise men came to welcome him: a star stood o'er the gable;
6706,SONG,"And there they saw the King of Kings, no longer thronged with"
6707,SONG,"angel wings,"
6708,SONG,"But crooning like a little babe, and cradled in a stable._"
6709,SONG,
6710,SONG,And creeping through the music once again the fairy cry
6711,SONG,Came freezing o'er the snowy towers to lead us on to Peterkin:
6712,SONG,"Once more the fairy bugles blew from lands beyond the sky,"
6713,SONG,"And we all groped out together, dazed and blind, we knew not why;"
6714,SONG,Out through the City's farther gates we went to look for Peterkin;
6715,SONG,"Out, out into the dark Unknown, and heard the clamour die"
6716,SONG,"Far, far away behind us as we trotted on to Peterkin."
6717,SONG,
6718,SONG,Then once more along the rare
6719,SONG,Forest-paths we groped our way:
6720,SONG,Here the glow-worm's league-long glare
6721,SONG,Turned the Wild Thyme night to day:
6722,SONG,There we passed a sort of whale
6723,SONG,"Sixty feet in length or more,"
6724,SONG,But we knew it was a snail
6725,SONG,Even when we heard it snore.
6726,SONG,
6727,SONG,Often through the glamorous gloom
6728,SONG,Almost on the top of us
6729,SONG,We beheld a beetle loom
6730,SONG,Like a hippopotamus;
6731,SONG,Once or twice a spotted toad
6732,SONG,Like a mountain wobbled by
6733,SONG,With a rolling moon that glowed
6734,SONG,Through the skin-fringe of its eye.
6735,SONG,
6736,SONG,Once a caterpillar bowed
6737,SONG,Down a leaf of Ygdrasil
6738,SONG,Like a sunset-coloured cloud
6739,SONG,Sleeping on a quiet hill:
6740,SONG,Once we came upon a moth
6741,SONG,"Fast asleep with outspread wings,"
6742,SONG,Like a mighty tissued cloth
6743,SONG,Woven for the feet of kings.
6744,SONG,
6745,SONG,There above the woods in state
6746,SONG,Many a temple dome that glows
6747,SONG,Delicately like a great
6748,SONG,Rainbow-coloured bubble rose:
6749,SONG,"Though they were but flowers on earth,"
6750,SONG,"Oh, we dared not enter in;"
6751,SONG,For in that divine re-birth
6752,SONG,Less than awe were more than sin.
6753,SONG,
6754,SONG,Yet their mystic anthems came
6755,SONG,Sweetly to our listening ears;
6756,SONG,And their burden was the same--
6757,SONG,"""No more sorrow, no more tears!"
6758,SONG,Whither Peterkin has gone
6759,SONG,"You, assuredly, shall go:"
6760,SONG,"When your wanderings are done,"
6761,SONG,"All he knows you, too, shall know!"""
6762,SONG,
6763,SONG,So we thought we'd onward roam
6764,SONG,"Till earth's Smallest Flower appeared,"
6765,SONG,With a less tremendous dome
6766,SONG,Less divinely to be feared:
6767,SONG,"Then, perchance, if we should dare"
6768,SONG,"Timidly to enter in,"
6769,SONG,Might some kindly doorkeeper
6770,SONG,Give us news of Peterkin.
6771,SONG,
6772,SONG,At last we saw a crimson porch
6773,SONG,"Far away, like a dull red torch"
6774,SONG,Burning in the purple gloom;
6775,SONG,And a great ocean of perfume
6776,SONG,"Rolled round us as we drew anear,"
6777,SONG,And then we strangely seemed to hear
6778,SONG,"The shadow of a mighty psalm,"
6779,SONG,A sound as if a golden sea
6780,SONG,Of music swung in utter calm
6781,SONG,Against the shores of Eternity;
6782,SONG,And then we saw the mighty dome
6783,SONG,Of some mysterious Temple tower
6784,SONG,"On high; and knew that we had come,"
6785,SONG,"At last, to that sweet House of Grace"
6786,SONG,Which wise men find in every place--
6787,SONG,The Temple of the Smallest Flower.
6788,SONG,
6789,SONG,And there--alas--our fairy friends
6790,SONG,"Whispered, ""Here our kingdom ends:"
6791,SONG,"You must enter in alone,"
6792,SONG,But your souls will surely show
6793,SONG,Whither Peterkin is gone
6794,SONG,And the road that you must go:
6795,SONG,"We, poor fairies, have no souls!"
6796,SONG,"Hark, the warning hare-bell tolls;"""
6797,SONG,"So ""Good-bye, good-bye,"" they said,"
6798,SONG,"""Dear little seekers-for-the-dead."""
6799,SONG,"They vanished; ah, but as they went"
6800,SONG,We heard their voices softly blent
6801,SONG,In some mysterious fairy song
6802,SONG,That seemed to make us wise and strong;
6803,SONG,
6804,SONG,For it was like the holy calm
6805,SONG,"That fills the bosomed rose with balm,"
6806,SONG,Or blessings that the twilight breathes
6807,SONG,Where the honeysuckle wreathes
6808,SONG,Between young lovers and the sky
6809,SONG,As on banks of flowers they lie;
6810,SONG,And with wings of rose and green
6811,SONG,"Laughing fairies pass unseen,"
6812,SONG,"Singing their sweet lullaby,--"
6813,SONG,Lulla-lulla-lullaby!
6814,SONG,Lulla-lulla-lullaby!
6815,SONG,"Ah, good-night, with lullaby!"
6816,SONG,
6817,SONG,*   *   *   *
6818,SONG,
6819,SONG,"Only a flower? Those carven walls,"
6820,SONG,"Those cornices and coronals,"
6821,SONG,"The splendid crimson porch, the thin"
6822,SONG,Strange sounds of singing from within--
6823,SONG,"Through the scented arch we stept,"
6824,SONG,"Pushed back the soft petallic door,"
6825,SONG,And down the velvet aisles we crept;
6826,SONG,Was it a Flower--no more?
6827,SONG,
6828,SONG,"For one of the voices that we heard,"
6829,SONG,"A child's voice, clear as the voice of a bird,"
6830,SONG,"Was it not?--nay, it could not be!"
6831,SONG,And a woman's voice that tenderly
6832,SONG,"Answered him in fond refrain,"
6833,SONG,"And pierced our hearts with sweet sweet pain,"
6834,SONG,As if dear Mary-mother hung
6835,SONG,"Above some little child, and sung."
6836,SONG,Between the waves of that golden sea
6837,SONG,The cradle-songs of Eternity;
6838,SONG,"And, while in her deep smile he basked,"
6839,SONG,Answered whatsoe'er he asked.
6840,SONG,
6841,SONG,"_What is there hid in the heart of a rose,"
6842,SONG,Mother-mine?
6843,SONG,"Ah, who knows, who knows, who knows?"
6844,SONG,A man that died on a lonely hill
6845,SONG,"May tell you, perhaps, but none other will,"
6846,SONG,Little child._
6847,SONG,
6848,SONG,"_What does it take to make a rose,"
6849,SONG,Mother-mine?
6850,SONG,The God that died to make it knows
6851,SONG,"It takes the world's eternal wars,"
6852,SONG,"It takes the moon and all the stars,"
6853,SONG,It takes the might of heaven and hell
6854,SONG,"And the everlasting Love as well,"
6855,SONG,Little child._
6856,SONG,
6857,SONG,"But there, in one great shrine apart"
6858,SONG,"Within the Temple's holiest heart,"
6859,SONG,"We came upon a blinding light,"
6860,SONG,"Suddenly, and a burning throne"
6861,SONG,"Of pinnacled glory, wild and white;"
6862,SONG,We could not see Who reigned thereon;
6863,SONG,"For, all at once, as a wood-bird sings,"
6864,SONG,The aisles were full of great white wings
6865,SONG,Row above mystic burning row;
6866,SONG,And through the splendour and the glow
6867,SONG,"We saw four angels, great and sweet,"
6868,SONG,"With outspread wings and folded feet,"
6869,SONG,Come gliding down from a heaven within
6870,SONG,The golden heart of Paradise;
6871,SONG,"And in their hands, with laughing eyes,"
6872,SONG,Lay little brother Peterkin.
6873,SONG,
6874,SONG,And all around the Temple of the Smallest of the Flowers
6875,SONG,The glory of the angels made a star for little Peterkin;
6876,SONG,For all the Kings of Splendour and all the Heavenly Powers
6877,SONG,Were gathered there together in the fairy forest bowers
6878,SONG,"With all their globed and radiant wings to make a star for Peterkin,"
6879,SONG,"The star that shone upon the East, a star that still is ours,"
6880,SONG,"Whene'er we hang our stockings up, a star of wings for Peterkin."
6881,SONG,
6882,SONG,"Then all, in one great flash, was gone--"
6883,SONG,"A voice cried, ""Hush, all's well!"""
6884,SONG,"And we stood dreaming there alone,"
6885,SONG,In darkness. Who can tell
6886,SONG,"The mystic quiet that we felt,"
6887,SONG,As if the woods in worship knelt;
6888,SONG,Far off we heard a bell
6889,SONG,Tolling strange human folk to prayer
6890,SONG,Through fields of sunset-coloured air.
6891,SONG,
6892,SONG,"And then a voice, ""Why, here they are!"""
6893,SONG,And--as it seemed--we woke;
6894,SONG,"The sweet old skies, great star by star"
6895,SONG,Upon our vision broke;
6896,SONG,Field over field of heavenly blue
6897,SONG,Rose o'er us; then a voice we knew
6898,SONG,Softly and gently spoke--

6906,THE HAPPY ENDING,
6907,THE HAPPY ENDING,We told dear father all our tale
6908,THE HAPPY ENDING,"That night before we went to bed,"
6909,THE HAPPY ENDING,"And at the end his face grew pale,"
6910,THE HAPPY ENDING,And he bent over us and said
6911,THE HAPPY ENDING,"(Was it not strange?) he, too, was there,"
6912,THE HAPPY ENDING,"A weary, weary watch to keep"
6913,THE HAPPY ENDING,Before the gates of the City of Sleep;
6914,THE HAPPY ENDING,"But, ere we came, he did not dare"
6915,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Even to dream of entering in,"
6916,THE HAPPY ENDING,Or even to hope for Peterkin.
6917,THE HAPPY ENDING,"He was the poor blind man, he said,"
6918,THE HAPPY ENDING,And we--how low he bent his head!
6919,THE HAPPY ENDING,Then he called mother near; and low
6920,THE HAPPY ENDING,"He whispered to us--""Prompt me now;"
6921,THE HAPPY ENDING,"For I forget that song we heard,"
6922,THE HAPPY ENDING,"But you remember every word."""
6923,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Then memory came like a breaking morn,"
6924,THE HAPPY ENDING,And we breathed it to him--_A child was born!_
6925,THE HAPPY ENDING,And there he drew us to his breast
6926,THE HAPPY ENDING,And softly murmured all the rest.--
6927,THE HAPPY ENDING,
6928,THE HAPPY ENDING,_The wise men came to greet him with their gifts of myrrh
6929,THE HAPPY ENDING,"and frankincense,--"
6930,THE HAPPY ENDING,Gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth;
6931,THE HAPPY ENDING,"And would you know the way to win to little brother Peterkin,"
6932,THE HAPPY ENDING,My childhood's heart shall guide you through the glories of
6933,THE HAPPY ENDING,the earth._
6934,THE HAPPY ENDING,
6935,THE HAPPY ENDING,Then he looked up and mother knelt
6936,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Beside us, oh, her eyes were bright;"
6937,THE HAPPY ENDING,Her arms were like a lovely belt
6938,THE HAPPY ENDING,All round us as we said Good-night
6939,THE HAPPY ENDING,"To father: _he_ was crying now,"
6940,THE HAPPY ENDING,"But they were happy tears, somehow;"
6941,THE HAPPY ENDING,For there we saw dear mother lay
6942,THE HAPPY ENDING,Her cheek against his cheek and say--
6943,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Hush, let me kiss those tears away."

7032,I,"Across the seas of Wonderland to Mogadore we plodded,"
7033,I,"Forty singing seamen in an old black barque,"
7034,I,And we landed in the twilight where a Polyphemus nodded
7035,I,With his battered moon-eye winking red and yellow through the dark!
7036,I,"For his eye was growing mellow,"
7037,I,"Rich and ripe and red and yellow,"
7038,I,"As was time, since old Ulysses made him bellow in the dark!"
7039,I,_Cho._--Since Ulysses bunged his eye up with a pine-torch in the dark!

7042,II,II
7043,II,
7044,II,_Were_ they mountains in the gloaming or the giant's ugly shoulders
7045,II,"Just beneath the rolling eyeball, with its bleared and vinous glow,"
7046,II,Red and yellow o'er the purple of the pines among the boulders
7047,II,"And the shaggy horror brooding on the sullen slopes below,"
7048,II,_Were_ they pines among the boulders
7049,II,Or the hair upon his shoulders?
7050,II,"We were only simple seamen, so of course we didn't know."

7056,III,"But we crossed a plain of poppies, and we came upon a fountain"

7058,III,"And behind it, in an emerald glade, beneath a golden mountain"
7059,III,"There stood a crystal palace, for a sailor to admire;"
7060,III,"For a troop of ghosts came round us,"
7061,III,"Which with leaves of bay they crowned us,"
7062,III,"Then with grog they well nigh drowned us, to the depth of our desire!"
7063,III,"_Cho._--And 'twas very friendly of them, as a sailor can admire!"

7066,IV,IV
7067,IV,
7068,IV,"There was music all about us, we were growing quite forgetful"
7069,IV,"We were only singing seamen from the dirt of London-town,"
7070,IV,Though the nectar that we swallowed seemed to vanish half regretful
7071,IV,"As if we wasn't good enough to take such vittles down,"
7072,IV,"When we saw a sudden figure,"
7073,IV,"Tall and black as any nigger,"
7074,IV,Like the devil--only bigger--drawing near us with a frown!

7078,V,V
7079,V,

7082,V,"""What? Englishmen?"" he cries, ""Well, if ye don't mind being haunted,"
7083,V,Faith you're welcome to my palace; I'm the famous Prester John!
7084,V,Will ye walk into my palace?
7085,V,I don't bear 'ee any malice!

7091,VI,
7092,VI,Now the door was one great diamond and the hall a hollow ruby--
7093,VI,"Big as Beachy Head, my lads, nay bigger by a half!"
7094,VI,"And I sees the mate wi' mouth agape, a-staring like a booby,"
7095,VI,"And the skipper close behind him, with his tongue out like a calf!"
7096,VI,Now the way to take it rightly
7097,VI,Was to walk along politely
7098,VI,Just as if you didn't notice--so I couldn't help but laugh!
7099,VI,_Cho._--For they both forgot their manners and the crew was bound
7100,VI,to laugh!
7101,VI,
7102,VI,
7103,VII,VII
7104,VII,
7105,VII,"But he took us through his palace and, my lads, as I'm a sinner,"
7106,VII,We walked into an opal like a sunset-coloured cloud--
7107,VII,"""My dining-room,"" he says, and, quick as light we saw a dinner"
7108,VII,Spread before us by the fingers of a hidden fairy crowd;
7109,VII,"And the skipper, swaying gently"
7110,VII,"After dinner, murmurs faintly,"
7111,VII,"""I looks to-wards you, Prester John, you've done us very proud!"""
7112,VII,"_Cho._--And we drank his health with honours, for he _done_ us"
7113,VII,_very_ proud!
7114,VII,
7115,VII,
7116,VIII,VIII
7117,VIII,
7118,VIII,Then he walks us to his garden where we sees a feathered demon
7119,VIII,Very splendid and important on a sort of spicy tree!
7120,VIII,"""That's the Phoenix,"" whispers Prester, ""which all eddicated seamen"
7121,VIII,"Knows the only one existent, and _he's_ waiting for to flee!"
7122,VIII,When his hundred years expire
7123,VIII,Then he'll set hisself a-fire
7124,VIII,"And another from his ashes rise most beautiful to see!"""

7130,IX,"Then he says, ""In younder forest there's a little silver river,"
7131,IX,"And whosoever drinks of it, his youth shall never die!"
7132,IX,"The centuries go by, but Prester John endures for ever"
7133,IX,With his music in the mountains and his magic on the sky!
7134,IX,"While _your_ hearts are growing colder,"
7135,IX,"While your world is growing older,"
7136,IX,"There's a magic in the distance, where the sea-line meets the sky,"""
7137,IX,_Cho._--It shall call to singing seamen till the fount o' song is dry!
7138,IX,
7139,IX,
7140,X,X
7141,X,
7142,X,"So we thought we'd up and seek it, but that forest fair defied us,--"
7143,X,"First a crimson leopard laughs at us most horrible to see,"
7144,X,"Then a sea-green lion came and sniffed and licked his chops and eyed us,"
7145,X,While a red and yellow unicorn was dancing round a tree!
7146,X,"_We_ was trying to look thinner,"
7147,X,"Which was hard, because our dinner"
7148,X,Must ha' made us very tempting to a cat o' high degree!
7149,X,_Cho._--Must ha' made us very tempting to the whole menarjeree!
7150,X,
7151,X,
7152,XI,XI
7153,XI,
7154,XI,So we scuttled from that forest and across the poppy meadows
7155,XI,Where the awful shaggy horror brooded o'er us in the dark!
7156,XI,"And we pushes out from shore again a-jumping at our shadows,"
7157,XI,And pulls away most joyful to the old black barque!
7158,XI,And home again we plodded
7159,XI,While the Polyphemus nodded
7160,XI,With his battered moon-eye winking red and yellow through the dark.
7161,XI,"_Cho._--Oh, the moon above the mountains, red and yellow through"
7162,XI,the dark!
7163,XI,
7164,XI,
7165,XII,XII
7166,XII,
7167,XII,"Across the seas of Wonderland to London-town we blundered,"
7168,XII,Forty singing seamen as was puzzled for to know
7169,XII,If the visions that we saw was caused by--here again we pondered--
7170,XII,A tipple in a vision forty thousand years ago.
7171,XII,Could the grog we _dreamt_ we swallowed
7172,XII,Make us _dream_ of all that followed?
7173,XII,"We were only simple seamen, so of course we didn't know!"
7174,XII,"_Cho._--We were simple singing seamen, so of course we could not know!"

7338,VI,Oblivious of the heights we climb until the last be scaled;
7339,VI,Then with all the earth before us
7340,VI,And the great cross floating o'er us
7341,VI,"We shall break the sword we forged of old, so weak we were and blind;"
7342,VI,While the inviolate heaven discloses
7343,VI,England's Rose of all the roses

7353,VII,"One with the flow of life and death, the tides of night and day;"
7354,VII,"One with all dreams of beauty,"
7355,VII,One with all laws of duty;
7356,VII,One with the weak and helpless while the one sky burns above;
7357,VII,Till eyes by tears made glorious
7358,VII,"Look up at last victorious,"
7359,VII,And lips that starved break open in one song of life and love.

7368,VIII,Till all waste places burgeon and the wildernesses sing;
7369,VIII,Pour the glory of thy pity
7370,VIII,Through the dark and troubled city;
7371,VIII,Pour the splendour of thy beauty over wood and meadow fair;

7373,VIII,And the Christ-child walk beside thee
7374,VIII,With a word of peace for England in the dawn of Nelson's Year.

7382,I,I
7383,I,
7384,I,To-night o'er Bagshot heath the purple heather
7385,I,Rolls like dumb thunder to the splendid West;
7386,I,And mighty ragged clouds are massed together
7387,I,Above the scarred old common's broken breast;
7388,I,"And there are hints of blood between the boulders,"
7389,I,"Red glints of fiercer blossom, bright and bold;"
7390,I,And round the shaggy mounds and sullen shoulders
7391,I,The gorse repays the sun with savage gold.
7392,I,
7393,I,"And now, as in the West the light grows holy,"
7394,I,"And all the hollows of the heath grow dim,"
7395,I,"Far off, a sulky rumble rolls up slowly"
7396,I,Where guns at practice growl their evening hymn.
7397,I,
7398,I,And here and there in bare clean yellow spaces
7399,I,The print of horse-hoofs like an answering cry
7400,I,Strikes strangely on the sense from lonely places
7401,I,Where there is nought but empty heath and sky.
7402,I,
7403,I,"The print of warlike hoofs, where now no figure"
7404,I,Of horse or man along the sky's red rim
7405,I,Breaks on the low horizon's rough black rigour
7406,I,To make the gorgeous waste less wild and grim;
7407,I,
7408,I,"Strangely the hoof-prints strike, a Crusoe's wonder,"
7409,I,"Framed with sharp furze amongst the footless fells,"
7410,I,"A menace and a mystery, rapt asunder,"
7411,I,"As if the whole wide world contained nought else,--"
7412,I,
7413,I,Nought but the grand despair of desolation
7414,I,"Between us and that wild, how far, how near,"
7415,I,"Where, clothed with thunder, nation grapples nation,"
7416,I,And Slaughter grips the clay-cold hand of Fear.
7417,I,
7418,I,
7419,II,II
7420,II,
7421,II,"And far above the purple heath the sunset stars awaken,"
7422,II,"And ghostly hosts of cloud across the West begin to stream,"
7423,II,"And all the low soft winds with muffled cannonades are shaken,"
7424,II,And all the blood-red blossom draws aloof into a dream;
7425,II,A dream--no more--and round the dream the clouds are curled together;
7426,II,A dream of two great stormy hosts embattled in the sky;
7427,II,For there against the low red heavens each sombre ridge of heather
7428,II,Up-heaves a hedge of bayonets around a battle-cry;
7429,II,
7430,II,Melts in the distant battle-field or brings the dream so near it
7431,II,"That, almost, as the rifted clouds around them swim and reel,"
7432,II,"A thousand grey-lipped faces flash--ah, hark, the heart can hear it--"
7433,II,The sharp command that lifts as one the levelled lines of steel.
7434,II,
7435,II,And through the purple thunders there are silent shadows creeping
7436,II,"With murderous gleams of light, and then--a mighty leaping roar"
7437,II,Where foe and foe are met; and then--a long low sound of weeping
7438,II,"As Death laughs out from sea to sea, another fight is o'er."
7439,II,
7440,II,"Another fight--but ah, how much is over? Night descending"
7441,II,Draws o'er the scene her ghastly moon-shot veil with piteous hands;
7442,II,But all around the bivouac-glare the shadowy pickets wending
7443,II,"See sights, hear sounds that only war's own madness understands."
7444,II,
7445,II,"No circle of the accursed dead where dreaming Dante wandered,"
7446,II,No city of death's eternal dole could match this mortal world
7447,II,"Where men, before the living soul and quivering flesh are sundered,"
7448,II,Through all the bestial shapes of pain to one wide grave are hurled.
7449,II,
7450,II,But in the midst for those who dare beyond the fringe to enter
7451,II,"Be sure one kingly figure lies with pale and blood-soiled face,"
7452,II,And round his brows a ragged crown of thorns; and in the centre
7453,II,Of those pale folded hands and feet the sigil of his grace.
7454,II,
7455,II,"See, how the pale limbs, marred and scarred in love's lost battle,"
7456,II,languish;
7457,II,See how the splendid passion still smiles quietly from his eyes:
7458,II,"Come, come and see a king indeed, who triumphs in his anguish,"
7459,II,Who conquers here in utter loss beneath the eternal skies.
7460,II,
7461,II,For unto lips so deadly calm what answer shall be given?
7462,II,"Oh pale, pale king so deadly still beneath the unshaken stars,"
7463,II,"Who shall deny thy kingdom here, though heaven and earth were riven,"
7464,II,With the last roar of onset in the world's intestine wars?
7465,II,
7466,II,The laugh is Death's; he laughs as erst o'er hours that England
7467,II,"cherished,"
7468,II,"""Count up, count up the stricken homes that wail the first-born son,"
7469,II,Count by your starved and fatherless the tale of what hath perished;
7470,II,"Then gather with your foes and ask if you--or I--have won."""
7471,II,
7472,II,
7473,III,III
7474,III,
7475,III,The world rolls on; and love and peace are mated:
7476,III,"Still on the breast of England, like a star,"
7477,III,"The blood-red lonely heath blows, consecrated,"
7478,III,A brooding practice-ground for blood-red war.
7479,III,
7480,III,Yet is there nothing out of tune with Nature
7481,III,"There, where the skylark showers his earliest song,"
7482,III,"Where sun and wind have moulded every feature,"
7483,III,And one world-music bears each note along.
7484,III,
7485,III,There many a brown-winged kestrel swoops or hovers
7486,III,In poised and patient quest of his own prey;
7487,III,And there are fern-clad glens where happy lovers
7488,III,May kiss the murmuring summer noon away.
7489,III,
7490,III,"There, as the primal earth was--all is glorious"
7491,III,Perfect and wise and wonderful in view
7492,III,Of that great heaven through which we rise victorious
7493,III,O'er all that strife and change and death can do.
7494,III,
7495,III,No nation yet has risen o'er earth's first nature;
7496,III,"Though love illumed each individual mind,"
7497,III,"Like some half-blind, half-formed primeval creature"
7498,III,The State still crawled a thousand years behind.
7499,III,
7500,III,Still on the standards of the great World-Powers
7501,III,"Lion and bear and eagle sullenly brood,"
7502,III,Whether the slow folds flap o'er halcyon hours
7503,III,Or stream tempestuously o'er fields of blood.
7504,III,
7505,III,By war's red evolution we have risen
7506,III,"Far, since fierce Erda chose her conquering few,"
7507,III,And out of Death's red gates and Time's grey prison
7508,III,"They burst, elect from battle, tried and true."
7509,III,
7510,III,"But now Death mocks at youth and love and glory,"
7511,III,"Chivalry slinks behind his loaded mines,"
7512,III,"With meaner murderous lips War tells her story,"
7513,III,And round her cunning brows no laurel shines.
7514,III,
7515,III,And here to us the eternal charge is given
7516,III,To rise and make our low world touch God's high:
7517,III,"To hasten God's own kingdom, Man's own heaven,"
7518,III,And teach Love's grander army how to die.
7519,III,
7520,III,"No kingdom then, no long-continuing city"
7521,III,Shall e'er again be stablished by the sword;
7522,III,"No blood-bought throne defy the powers of pity,"
7523,III,No despot's crown outweigh one helot's word.
7524,III,
7525,III,"Imperial England, breathe thy marching orders:"
7526,III,"The great host waits; the end, the end is close,"
7527,III,"When earth shall know thy peace in all her borders,"
7528,III,And all her deserts blossom with thy Rose.
7529,III,
7530,III,Princedoms and peoples rise and flash and perish
7531,III,As the dew passes from the flowering thorn;
7532,III,Yet the one Kingdom that our dreams still cherish
7533,III,Lives in a light that blinds the world's red morn.
7534,III,
7535,III,"Hasten the Kingdom, England, the days darken;"
7536,III,"We would not have thee slacken watch or ward,"
7537,III,"Nor doff thine armour till the whole world hearken,"
7538,III,Nor till Time bid thee lay aside the sword.
7539,III,
7540,III,"Hasten the Kingdom; hamlet, heath, and city,"
7541,III,"We are all at war, one bleeding bulk of pain;"
7542,III,Little we know; but one thing--by God's pity--
7543,III,"We know, and know all else on earth is vain."
7544,III,
7545,III,"We know not yet how much we dare, how little;"
7546,III,"We dare not dream of peace; yet, as at need,"
7547,III,"England, God help thee, let no jot or tittle"
7548,III,Of Love's last law go past thee without heed.
7549,III,
7550,III,_Who saves his life shall lose it!_ The great ages
7551,III,Bear witness--Rome and Babylon and Tyre
7552,III,"Cry from the dust-stopped lips of all their sages,--"
7553,III,There is no hope if man can climb no higher.
7554,III,
7555,III,"England, by God's grace set apart to ponder"
7556,III,"A little while from battle, ah, take heed,"
7557,III,"Keep watch, keep watch, beside thy sleeping thunder;"
7558,III,Call down Christ's pity while those others bleed;
7559,III,
7560,III,"Waken the God within thee, while the sorrow"
7561,III,"Of battle surges round a distant shore,"
7562,III,"While Time is thine, lest on some deadly morrow"
7563,III,The moving finger write--_but thine no more_.
7564,III,
7565,III,Little we know--but though the advancing æons
7566,III,"Win every painful step by blood and fire,"
7567,III,"Though tortured mouths must chant the world's great pæans,"
7568,III,And martyred souls proclaim the world's desire;
7569,III,
7570,III,"Though war be nature's engine of rejection,"
7571,III,"Soon, soon, across her universal verge"
7572,III,The soul of man in sacred insurrection
7573,III,Shall into God's diviner light emerge.
7574,III,
7575,III,"Hasten the Kingdom, England, queen and mother;"
7576,III,Little we know of all Time's works and ways;
7577,III,"Yet this, this, this is sure: we need none other"
7578,III,"Knowledge or wisdom, hope or aim or praise,"
7579,III,
7580,III,But to keep this one stormy banner flying
7581,III,"In this one faith that none shall e'er disprove,"
7582,III,"Then drive the embattled world before thee, crying,"
7583,III,"There is one Emperor, whose name is Love."

8211,(AN ODE),"Wake, for in each soft porch of azure sky,"

8230,(AN ODE),"Where wastes that bear no harvest yield their bloom,"
8231,(AN ODE),"Rude crofts of flowering nettle, bents of yellow broom."
8232,(AN ODE),
8233,(AN ODE),The very reeds and sedges of the fen
8234,(AN ODE),Open their hearts and blossom to the sky;
8235,(AN ODE),The wild thyme on the mountain's knees
8236,(AN ODE),Unrolls its purple market to the bees;
8237,(AN ODE),Unharvested of men
8238,(AN ODE),The Traveller's Joy can only smile and die.
8239,(AN ODE),"Joy, joy alone the throbbing whitethroats bring,"
8240,(AN ODE),Joy to themselves and heaven! They were but born to sing!

8243,(AN ODE),The whole sweet summer sharpens to a glow!
8244,(AN ODE),"See, as the well-spring plashes cool"
8245,(AN ODE),Over a shadowy green fern-fretted pool
8246,(AN ODE),The mystic sunbeam shines
8247,(AN ODE),For one mad moment on a breast of snow
8248,(AN ODE),A warm white shoulder and a glowing arm
8249,(AN ODE),"Up-flung, where some swift Undine sinks in shy alarm."
8250,(AN ODE),
8251,(AN ODE),"And if she were not all a dream, and lent"
8252,(AN ODE),"Life for a little to your own desire,"

8255,(AN ODE),"The violet, spray-besprent"
8256,(AN ODE),"When from that plunge the rainbows flashed like fire,"
8257,(AN ODE),Will scarce more swiftly lose its happy dew
8258,(AN ODE),Than eyes which Undine haunts will cease to shine on you.
8259,(AN ODE),
8260,(AN ODE),"What though the throstle pour his heart away,"
8261,(AN ODE),"A happy spendthrift of uncounted gold,"
8262,(AN ODE),Swinging upon a blossomed briar
8263,(AN ODE),With soft throat lifted in a wild desire
8264,(AN ODE),To make the world his may.
8265,(AN ODE),Ever the pageant through the gates is rolled
8266,(AN ODE),Further away; in vain the rich notes throng
8267,(AN ODE),Flooding the mellow noon with wave on wave of song.
8268,(AN ODE),
8269,(AN ODE),"The feathery meadows like a lilac sea,"
8270,(AN ODE),"Knee-deep, with honeyed clover, red and white,"

8272,(AN ODE),Trailing their soft blue shadows o'er the grass;
8273,(AN ODE),"The skylark, mad with glee,"
8274,(AN ODE),"Quivers, up, up, to lose himself in light;"
8275,(AN ODE),"And, through the forest, like a fairy dream"
8276,(AN ODE),"Through some dark mind, the ferns in branching beauty stream."
8277,(AN ODE),
8278,(AN ODE),"Enough of joy! A little respite lend,"
8279,(AN ODE),"Summer, fair god that hast so little heed"
8280,(AN ODE),"Of these that serve thee but to die,"
8281,(AN ODE),Mere trappings of thy tragic pageantry!
8282,(AN ODE),"Show us the end, the end!"
8283,(AN ODE),"We too, with human hearts that break and bleed,"
8284,(AN ODE),"March to the night that rounds their fleeting hour,"
8285,(AN ODE),"And feel we, too, perchance but serve some loftier Power."
8286,(AN ODE),
8287,(AN ODE),"O that our hearts might pass away with thee,"
8288,(AN ODE),"Burning and pierced and full of thy sweet pain,"
8289,(AN ODE),"Burst through the gates with thy swift soul,"
8290,(AN ODE),"Hunt thy most white perfection to the goal,"
8291,(AN ODE),"Nor wait, once more to see"
8292,(AN ODE),"Thy chaliced lilies rotting in the rain,"
8293,(AN ODE),Thy ragged yellowing banners idly hung
8294,(AN ODE),In woods that have forgotten all the songs we sung!

8309,(AN ODE),Than e'er was born to die:
8310,(AN ODE),"Man only, of earth, throned on Eternity,"

8640,I,"Down to the valley she came, for far and far below in the"
8641,I,dreaming meadows
8642,I,"Pleaded ever the Voice of voices, calling his love by her"
8643,I,golden name;
8644,I,"So she arose from her home in the hills, and down through the blossoms"
8645,I,"that danced with their shadows,"
8646,I,"Out of the blue of the dreaming distance, down to the heart of her"
8647,I,lover she came.
8648,I,
8649,I,*   *   *   *
8650,I,
8651,I,Red were the lips that hovered above her lips in the flowery haze of the
8652,I,June-day:
8653,I,Red as a rose through the perfumed mist of passion that reeled before
8654,I,her eyes;
8655,I,Strong the smooth young sunburnt arms that folded her heart to his heart
8656,I,"in the noon-day,"
8657,I,Strong and supple with throbbing sunshine under the blinding
8658,I,southern skies.
8659,I,
8660,I,"Ah, the kisses, the little murmurs, mad with pain for their"
8661,I,"phantom fleetness,"
8662,I,"Mad with pain for the passing of love that lives, they"
8663,I,dreamed--as we dream--for an hour!
8664,I,"Ah, the sudden tempest of passion, mad with pain, for its"
8665,I,"over-sweetness,"
8666,I,As petal by petal and pang by pang their love broke out into
8667,I,perfect flower.
8668,I,
8669,I,"Ah, the wonder as once he wakened, out of a dream of remembered blisses,"
8670,I,"Couched in the meadows of dreaming blossom to feel, like the touch of"
8671,I,"a flower on his eyes,"
8672,I,Cool and fresh with the fragment dews of dawn the touch of her light
8673,I,"swift kisses,"
8674,I,Shed from the shadowy rose of her face between his face and the warm
8675,I,blue skies.
8676,I,
8677,I,
8678,II,II
8679,II,
8680,II,Lost in his new desire
8681,II,He dreamed away the hours;
8682,II,His lyre
8683,II,Lay buried in the flowers:
8684,II,
8685,II,"To whom the King of Heaven,"
8686,II,"Apollo, lord of light,"
8687,II,Had given
8688,II,Beauty and love and might:
8689,II,
8690,II,"Might, if he would, to slay"
8691,II,All evil dreams and pierce
8692,II,The grey
8693,II,Veil of the Universe;
8694,II,
8695,II,With Love that holds in one
8696,II,Sacred and ancient bond
8697,II,The sun
8698,II,"And all the vast beyond,"
8699,II,
8700,II,And Beauty to enthrall
8701,II,The soul of man to heaven:
8702,II,"Yea, all"
8703,II,These gifts to him were given.
8704,II,
8705,II,_Yet in his dream's desire
8706,II,He drowsed away the hours:
8707,II,His lyre
8708,II,Lay buried in the flowers._
8709,II,
8710,II,Then in his wrath arose
8711,II,"Apollo, lord of light,"
8712,II,That shows
8713,II,The wrong deed from the right;
8714,II,
8715,II,And by what radiant laws
8716,II,"O'erruling human needs,"
8717,II,The cause
8718,II,To consequence proceeds;
8719,II,
8720,II,How balanced is the sway
8721,II,He gives each mortal doom:
8722,II,How day
8723,II,Demands the atoning gloom:
8724,II,
8725,II,How all good things await
8726,II,The soul that pays the price
8727,II,To Fate
8728,II,By equal sacrifice;
8729,II,
8730,II,And how on him that sleeps
8731,II,For less than labour's sake
8732,II,There creeps
8733,II,"Uncharmed, the Pythian snake."
8734,II,
8735,II,
8736,III,III
8737,III,
8738,III,"Lulled by the wash of the feathery grasses, a sea with many a sun-swept"
8739,III,"billow,"
8740,III,"Heart to heart in the heart of the summer, lover by lover asleep"
8741,III,"they lay,"
8742,III,Hearing only the whirring cicala that chirruped awhile at their
8743,III,poppied pillow
8744,III,Faint and sweet as the murmur of men that laboured in villages far
8745,III,away.
8746,III,
8747,III,"Was not the menace indeed more silent? Ah, what care for labour and"
8748,III,sorrow?
8749,III,Gods in the meadows of moly and amaranth surely might envy their deep
8750,III,sweet bed
8751,III,"Here where the butterflies troubled the lilies of peace, and took no"
8752,III,"thought for the morrow,"
8753,III,And golden-girdled bees made feast as over the lotus the soft sun
8754,III,spread.
8755,III,
8756,III,"Nearer, nearer the menace glided, out of the gorgeous gloom around"
8757,III,"them,"
8758,III,Out of the poppy-haunted shadows deep in the heart of the purple
8759,III,brake;
8760,III,"Till through the hush and the heat as they lay, and their own sweet"
8761,III,"listless dreams enwound them,--"
8762,III,"Mailed and mottled with hues of the grape-bloom suddenly, quietly,"
8763,III,glided the snake.
8764,III,
8765,III,"Subtle as jealousy, supple as falsehood, diamond-headed and cruel as"
8766,III,"pleasure,"
8767,III,"Coil by coil he lengthened and glided, straight to the fragrant curve"
8768,III,of her throat:
8769,III,There in the print of the last of the kisses that still glowed red from
8770,III,"the sweet long pressure,"
8771,III,Fierce as famine and swift as lightning over the glittering lyre he
8772,III,smote.
8773,III,
8774,III,
8775,IV,IV
8776,IV,
8777,IV,And over the cold white body of love and delight
8778,IV,"Orpheus arose in the terrible storm of his grief,"
8779,IV,"With quivering up-clutched hands, deadly and white,"
8780,IV,And his whole soul wavered and shook like a wind-swept leaf:
8781,IV,
8782,IV,"As a leaf that beats on a mountain, his spirit in vain"
8783,IV,Assaulted his doom and beat on the Gates of Death:
8784,IV,"Then prone with his arms o'er the lyre he sobbed out his pain,"
8785,IV,And the tense chords faintly gave voice to the pulse of his breath.
8786,IV,
8787,IV,"And he heard it and rose, once again, with the lyre in his hand,"
8788,IV,And smote out the cry that his white-lipped sorrow denied:
8789,IV,"And the grief's mad ecstasy swept o'er the summer-sweet land,"
8790,IV,And gathered the tears of all Time in the rush of its tide.
8791,IV,
8792,IV,"There was never a love forsaken or faith forsworn,"
8793,IV,"There was never a cry for the living or moan for the slain,"
8794,IV,"But was voiced in that great consummation of song; ay, and borne"
8795,IV,To storm on the Gates of the land whence none cometh again.
8796,IV,
8797,IV,"Transcending the barriers of earth, comprehending them all"
8798,IV,He followed the soul of his loss with the night in his eyes;
8799,IV,And the portals lay bare to him there; and he heard the faint call
8800,IV,Of his love o'er the rabble that wails by the river of sighs.
8801,IV,
8802,IV,"Yea, there in the mountains before him, he knew it of old,"
8803,IV,"That portal enormous of gloom, he had seen it in dreams,"
8804,IV,When the secrets of Time and of Fate through his harmonies rolled;
8805,IV,And behind it he heard the dead moan by their desolate streams.
8806,IV,
8807,IV,And he passed through the Gates with the light and the cloud of his
8808,IV,"song,"
8809,IV,Dry-shod over Lethe he passed to the chasms of hell;
8810,IV,"And the hosts of the dead made mock at him, crying, _How long"
8811,IV,"Have we dwelt in the darkness, oh fool, and shall evermore dwell?_"
8812,IV,
8813,IV,_Did our lovers not love us?_ the grey skulls hissed in his face;
8814,IV,_Were our lips not red? Were these cavernous eyes not bright?
8815,IV,"Yet us, whom the soft flesh clothed with such roseate grace,"
8816,IV,Our lovers would loathe if we ever returned to their sight!_
8817,IV,
8818,IV,"Oh then, through the soul of the Singer, a pity so vast"
8819,IV,"Mixed with his anguish that, smiting anew on his lyre,"
8820,IV,"He caught up the sorrows of hell in his utterance at last,"
8821,IV,Comprehending the need of them all in his own great desire.
8822,IV,
8823,IV,
8824,V,V
8825,V,
8826,V,"And they that were dead, in his radiant music, remembered the"
8827,V,"dawn with its low deep crimson,"
8828,V,"Heard the murmur of doves in the pine-wood, heard the moan of the"
8829,V,"roaming sea,"
8830,V,"Heard and remembered the little kisses, in woods where the last of"
8831,V,the moon yet swims on
8832,V,"Fragrant, flower-strewn April nights of young-eyed lovers in Arcady;"
8833,V,
8834,V,Saw the soft blue veils of shadow floating over the billowy grasses
8835,V,Under the crisp white curling clouds that sailed and trailed through
8836,V,the melting blue;
8837,V,"Heard once more the quarrel of lovers above them pass, as a"
8838,V,"lark-song passes,"
8839,V,"Light and bright, till it vanished away in an eye-bright heaven of"
8840,V,silvery dew.
8841,V,
8842,V,"Out of the dark, ah, white as the Huntress, cold and sweet as the"
8843,V,"petals that crowned her,"
8844,V,Fair and fleet as a fawn that shakes the dew from the fern at break
8845,V,of day;
8846,V,Wreathed with the clouds of her dusky hair that swept in a sun-bright
8847,V,"glory around her,"
8848,V,"On through the deserts of hell she came, and the brown air bloomed"
8849,V,with the light of May.
8850,V,
8851,V,On through the deserts of hell she came; for over the fierce and frozen
8852,V,meadows
8853,V,"Pleaded ever the Voice of voices, calling his love by her golden name;"
8854,V,"So she arose from her grave in the darkness, and up through the wailing"
8855,V,"fires and shadows,"
8856,V,"On by chasm and cliff and cavern, out of the horrors of death she"
8857,V,came.
8858,V,
8859,V,"Then had she followed him, then had he won her, striking a chord that"
8860,V,"should echo for ever,"
8861,V,"Had he been steadfast only a little, nor paused in the great"
8862,V,transcendent song;
8863,V,"But ere they had won to the glory of day, he came to the brink of the"
8864,V,flaming river
8865,V,"And ceased, to look on his love a moment, a little moment, and"
8866,V,overlong.
8867,V,
8868,V,
8869,VI,VI
8870,VI,
8871,VI,O'er Phlegethon he stood:
8872,VI,Below him roared and flamed
8873,VI,The flood
8874,VI,For utmost anguish named.
8875,VI,
8876,VI,"And lo, across the night,"
8877,VI,The shining form he knew
8878,VI,With light
8879,VI,Swift footsteps upward drew.
8880,VI,
8881,VI,Up through the desolate lands
8882,VI,"She stole, a ghostly star,"
8883,VI,With hands
8884,VI,Outstretched to him afar.
8885,VI,
8886,VI,"With arms outstretched, she came"
8887,VI,"In yearning majesty,"
8888,VI,The same
8889,VI,Royal Eurydice.
8890,VI,
8891,VI,Up through the ghastly dead
8892,VI,"She came, with shining eyes"
8893,VI,And red
8894,VI,Sweet lips of child-surprise.
8895,VI,
8896,VI,Up through the wizened crowds
8897,VI,"She stole, as steals the moon"
8898,VI,Through clouds
8899,VI,Of flowery mist in June.
8900,VI,
8901,VI,He gazed: he ceased to smite
8902,VI,The golden-chorded lyre:
8903,VI,Delight
8904,VI,Consumed his heart with fire.
8905,VI,
8906,VI,Though in that deadly land
8907,VI,"His task was but half-done,"
8908,VI,His hand
8909,VI,"Drooped, and the fight half-won."
8910,VI,
8911,VI,"He saw the breasts that glowed,"
8912,VI,The fragrant clouds of hair:
8913,VI,They flowed
8914,VI,Around him like a snare.
8915,VI,
8916,VI,"_O'er Phlegethon he stood,"
8917,VI,For utmost anguish named:
8918,VI,The flood
8919,VI,Below him roared and flamed._
8920,VI,
8921,VI,Out of his hand the lyre
8922,VI,"Suddenly slipped and fell,"
8923,VI,The fire
8924,VI,Acclaimed it into hell.
8925,VI,
8926,VI,The night grew dark again:
8927,VI,There came a bitter cry
8928,VI,"Of pain,"
8929,VI,"_Oh Love, once more I die!_"
8930,VI,
8931,VI,"And lo, the earth-dawn broke,"
8932,VI,And like a wraith she fled:
8933,VI,He woke
8934,VI,Alone: his love was dead.
8935,VI,
8936,VI,He woke on earth: the day
8937,VI,Shone coldly: at his side
8938,VI,There lay
8939,VI,The body of his bride.
8940,VI,
8941,VI,
8942,VII,VII
8943,VII,
8944,VII,"Only now when the purple vintage bubbles and winks in the autumn glory,"
8945,VII,Only now when the great white oxen drag the weight of the harvest
8946,VII,"home,"
8947,VII,"Sunburnt labourers, under the star of the sunset, sing as an old-world"
8948,VII,story
8949,VII,How two pale and thwarted lovers ever through Arcady still must roam.
8950,VII,
8951,VII,Faint as the silvery mists of morning over the peaks that the
8952,VII,"noonday parches,"
8953,VII,"On through the haunts of the gloaming musk-rose, down to the rivers"
8954,VII,"that glisten below,"
8955,VII,"Ever they wander from meadow to pinewood, under the whispering"
8956,VII,"woodbine arches,"
8957,VII,Faint as the mists of the dews of the dusk when violets dream and
8958,VII,the moon-winds blow.
8959,VII,
8960,VII,Though the golden lute of Orpheus gathered the splendours of
8961,VII,"earth and heaven,"
8962,VII,"All the golden greenwood notes and all the chimes of the changing sea,"
8963,VII,Old men over the fires of winter murmur again that he was not given
8964,VII,The steadfast heart divine to rule that infinite freedom of harmony.
8965,VII,
8966,VII,"Therefore he failed, say they; but we, that have no wisdom, can"
8967,VII,only remember
8968,VII,How through the purple perfumed pinewoods white Eurydice roamed and
8969,VII,sung:
8970,VII,"How through the whispering gold of the wheat, where the poppy burned"
8971,VII,"like a crimson ember,"
8972,VII,"Down to the valley in beauty she came, and under her feet the flowers"
8973,VII,upsprung.
8974,VII,
8975,VII,"_Down to the valley she came, for far and far below in the dreaming"
8976,VII,meadows
8977,VII,"Pleaded ever the Voice of voices, calling his love by her golden name;"
8978,VII,"So she arose from her home in the hills, and down through the blossoms"
8979,VII,"that danced with their shadows,"
8980,VII,"Out of the blue of the dreaming distance, down to the heart of her"
8981,VII,lover she came._

9633,ENCELADUS,"Born of the lower earth, he knew not how,"

9635,ENCELADUS,"Brought forth in darkness, and he knew not why!"
9636,ENCELADUS,
9637,ENCELADUS,"Thus, like a wind, went by a thousand years."
9638,ENCELADUS,
9639,ENCELADUS,"Anhungered, yet no comrade of the wolf,"
9640,ENCELADUS,"And cold, but with no power upon the sun,"

9649,ENCELADUS,"And, like one wave, a thousand years went by."
9650,ENCELADUS,
9651,ENCELADUS,He raised his matted head and scanned the stars.
9652,ENCELADUS,He stood erect! He lifted his uncouth arms!
9653,ENCELADUS,With inarticulate sounds his uncouth lips
9654,ENCELADUS,"Wrestled and strove--_I am full-fed, and yet"
9655,ENCELADUS,I hunger!
9656,ENCELADUS,Who set this fiercer famine in my maw?_
9657,ENCELADUS,
9658,ENCELADUS,"_Can I eat moons, gorge on the Milky Way,"
9659,ENCELADUS,"Swill sunsets down, or sup the wash of the dawn"

9672,ENCELADUS,And the sleek gorged lioness

9674,ENCELADUS,"Redder her lolling tongue, whiter her fangs,"
9675,ENCELADUS,And gazed with ignorant eyes of golden flame.
9676,ENCELADUS,
9677,ENCELADUS,"""_I hunger!_"""
9678,ENCELADUS,Like a breaking sea his cry
9679,ENCELADUS,Swept through the night. Against his swarthy knees
9680,ENCELADUS,She rubbed the red wet velvet of her ears
9681,ENCELADUS,"With mellow thunders of unweeting bliss,"
9682,ENCELADUS,"Purring--_Ah, seek, and you shall find."
9683,ENCELADUS,"Ah, seek, and you shall slaughter, gorge, ah seek,"

9688,ENCELADUS,"A rosy City, opening in the clouds,"
9689,ENCELADUS,"The hunger-born mirage of his own heart,"
9690,ENCELADUS,"Far, far above the world, a home of gods,"
9691,ENCELADUS,"Where One, a goddess, veiled in the sleek waves"
9692,ENCELADUS,"Of her deep hair, yet glimmering golden through,"
9693,ENCELADUS,"Lifted, with radiant arms, ambrosial food"
9694,ENCELADUS,"For hunger such as this! Up the dark hills,"
9695,ENCELADUS,"He rushed, a thunder-cloud,"
9696,ENCELADUS,Urged by the famine of his heart. He stood
9697,ENCELADUS,"High on the topmost crags, he hailed the gods"
9698,ENCELADUS,"In thunder, and the clouds re-echoed it!"
9699,ENCELADUS,
9700,ENCELADUS,He hailed the gods!
9701,ENCELADUS,And like a sea of thunder round their thrones
9702,ENCELADUS,"Washing, a midnight sea, his earth-born voice"
9703,ENCELADUS,Besieged the halls of heaven! He hailed the gods!
9704,ENCELADUS,"They laughed, he heard them laugh!"
9705,ENCELADUS,"With echo and re-echo, far and wide,"
9706,ENCELADUS,"A golden sea of mockery, they laughed!"
9707,ENCELADUS,
9708,ENCELADUS,"Enceladus, earth-born Enceladus,"
9709,ENCELADUS,"Laid hold upon the rosy Gates of Heaven,"
9710,ENCELADUS,"And shook them with gigantic sooty hands,"
9711,ENCELADUS,"Asking he knew not what, but not for alms;"
9712,ENCELADUS,"And the Gates, opened as in jest;"
9713,ENCELADUS,"And, like a sooty jest, he stumbled in."
9714,ENCELADUS,
9715,ENCELADUS,"Round him the gods, the young and scornful gods,"
9716,ENCELADUS,"Clustered and laughed to mark the ravaged face,"
9717,ENCELADUS,"The brutal brows, the deep and dog-like eyes,"
9718,ENCELADUS,"The blunt black nails, and back with burdens bowed."
9719,ENCELADUS,"And, when they laughed, he snarled with uncouth lips"
9720,ENCELADUS,And made them laugh again.
9721,ENCELADUS,"""_Whence comest thou?_"""
9722,ENCELADUS,He could not speak!
9723,ENCELADUS,How should he speak whose heart within him heaved
9724,ENCELADUS,And burned like Etna? Through his mouth there came
9725,ENCELADUS,A sound of ice-bergs in a frozen sea
9726,ENCELADUS,"Of tears, a sullen region of black ice"
9727,ENCELADUS,"Rending and breaking, very far away."
9728,ENCELADUS,They laughed!
9729,ENCELADUS,"He stared at them, bewildered, and they laughed"
9730,ENCELADUS,"Again, ""_Whence comest thou?_"""
9731,ENCELADUS,
9732,ENCELADUS,He could not speak!
9733,ENCELADUS,"But through his mouth a moan of midnight woods,"
9734,ENCELADUS,"Where wild beasts lay in wait to slaughter and gorge,"
9735,ENCELADUS,A moan of forest-caverns where the wolf
9736,ENCELADUS,"Brought forth her litter, a moan of the wild earth"
9737,ENCELADUS,"In travail with strange shapes of mire and clay,"
9738,ENCELADUS,"Creatures of clay, clay images of the gods,"
9739,ENCELADUS,"That hungered like the gods, the most high gods,"
9740,ENCELADUS,"But found no food, and perished like the beasts."
9741,ENCELADUS,
9742,ENCELADUS,"And the gods laughed,--"
9743,ENCELADUS,"_Art thou, then, such a god?_ And, like a leaf"
9744,ENCELADUS,"Unfolding in dark woods, in his deep brain"
9745,ENCELADUS,A sudden memory woke; and like an ape
9746,ENCELADUS,"He nodded, and all heaven with laughter rocked,"
9747,ENCELADUS,"While Artemis cried out with scornful lips,--"
9748,ENCELADUS,_Perchance He is the Maker of you all!_
9749,ENCELADUS,
9750,ENCELADUS,"Then, piteously outstretching calloused hands,"
9751,ENCELADUS,"He sank upon his knees, his huge gnarled knees,"
9752,ENCELADUS,"And echoed, falteringly, with slow harsh tongue,--"
9753,ENCELADUS,"_Perchance, perchance, the Maker of you all._"
9754,ENCELADUS,
9755,ENCELADUS,"They wept with laughter! And Aphrodite, she,"
9756,ENCELADUS,With keener mockery than white Artemis
9757,ENCELADUS,"Who smiled aloof, drew nigh him unabashed"
9758,ENCELADUS,"In all her blinding beauty. Carelessly,"
9759,ENCELADUS,As o'er the brute brows of a stallèd ox
9760,ENCELADUS,"Across that sooty muzzle and brawny breast,"
9761,ENCELADUS,"Contemptuously, she swept her golden hair"
9762,ENCELADUS,"In one deep wave, a many-millioned scourge"
9763,ENCELADUS,Intolerable and beautiful as fire;
9764,ENCELADUS,"Then turned and left him, reeling, gasping, dumb,"
9765,ENCELADUS,"While heaven re-echoed and re-echoed, _See,"
9766,ENCELADUS,"Perchance, perchance, the Maker of us all!_"
9767,ENCELADUS,
9768,ENCELADUS,"Enceladus, earth-born Enceladus,"
9769,ENCELADUS,"Rose to his feet, and with one terrible cry"
9770,ENCELADUS,"""_I hunger_,"" rushed upon the scornful gods"
9771,ENCELADUS,"And strove to seize and hold them with his hands,"
9772,ENCELADUS,And still the laughter deepened as they rolled
9773,ENCELADUS,"Their clouds around them, baffling him. But once,"
9774,ENCELADUS,"Once with a shout, in his gigantic arms"
9775,ENCELADUS,He crushed a slippery splendour on his breast
9776,ENCELADUS,And felt on his harsh skin the cool smooth peaks
9777,ENCELADUS,Of Aphrodite's bosom. One black hand
9778,ENCELADUS,Slid down the naked snow of her long side
9779,ENCELADUS,"And bruised it where he held her. Then, like snow"
9780,ENCELADUS,"Vanishing in a furnace, out of his arms"
9781,ENCELADUS,"The splendour suddenly melted, and a roll"
9782,ENCELADUS,"Of thunder split the dream, and headlong down"
9783,ENCELADUS,"He fell, from heaven to earth; while, overhead"
9784,ENCELADUS,The young and scornful gods--he heard them laugh!--
9785,ENCELADUS,Toppled the crags down after him. He lay
9786,ENCELADUS,Supine. They plucked up Etna by the roots
9787,ENCELADUS,And buried him beneath it. His broad breast
9788,ENCELADUS,"Heaved, like that other giant in his heart,"
9789,ENCELADUS,"And through the crater burst his fiery breath,"
9790,ENCELADUS,But could not burst his bonds. And so he lay
9791,ENCELADUS,Breathing in agony thrice a thousand years.
9792,ENCELADUS,
9793,ENCELADUS,"Then came a Voice, he knew not whence, ""Arise,"
9794,ENCELADUS,"Enceladus!"" And from his heart a crag"
9795,ENCELADUS,"Fell, and one arm was free, and one thought free,"
9796,ENCELADUS,"And suddenly he awoke, and stood upright,"
9797,ENCELADUS,Shaking the mountains from him like a dream;
9798,ENCELADUS,And the tremendous light and awful truth
9799,ENCELADUS,"Smote, like the dawn, upon his blinded eyes,"
9800,ENCELADUS,"That out of his first wonder at the world,"
9801,ENCELADUS,"Out of his own heart's deep humility,"
9802,ENCELADUS,"And simple worship, he had fashioned gods"
9803,ENCELADUS,"Of cloud, and heaven out of a hollow shell."
9804,ENCELADUS,And groping now no more in the empty space
9805,ENCELADUS,"Outward, but inward in his own deep heart,"
9806,ENCELADUS,He suddenly felt the secret gates of heaven
9807,ENCELADUS,"Open, and from the infinite heavens of hope"
9808,ENCELADUS,"Inward, a voice, from the innermost courts of Love,"
9809,ENCELADUS,Rang--_Thou shall have none other gods but Me._
9810,ENCELADUS,
9811,ENCELADUS,"Enceladus, the foul Enceladus,"
9812,ENCELADUS,When the clear light out of that inward heaven
9813,ENCELADUS,"Whose gates are only inward in the soul,"
9814,ENCELADUS,"Showed him that one true Kingdom, said,"
9815,ENCELADUS,"""I will stretch"
9816,ENCELADUS,"My hands out once again. And, as the God"
9817,ENCELADUS,"That made me is the Heart within my heart,"
9818,ENCELADUS,So shall my heart be to this dust and earth
9819,ENCELADUS,A god and a creator. I will strive
9820,ENCELADUS,"With mountains, fires and seas, wrestle and strive,"
9821,ENCELADUS,"Fashion and make, and that which I have made"
9822,ENCELADUS,"In anguish I shall love as God loves me."""

9828,ENCELADUS,"The Shapings, the dim Sceptres of Creation,"
9829,ENCELADUS,The Shafts like columns of wan-hope arise
9830,ENCELADUS,"To waste, on the blear sky, their slow sad wreaths"
9831,ENCELADUS,"Of smoke, their infinitely sad slow prayers."
9832,ENCELADUS,"Then, as the dawn crimsoned, the sordid clouds,"
9833,ENCELADUS,"The puddling furnaces, the mounds of slag,"
9834,ENCELADUS,"The cinders, and the sand-beds and the rows"
9835,ENCELADUS,"Of wretched roofs, assumed a majesty"
9836,ENCELADUS,Beyond all majesties of earth or air;
9837,ENCELADUS,"Beauty beyond all beauty, as of a child"
9838,ENCELADUS,"In rags, upraised thro' the still gold of heaven,"
9839,ENCELADUS,"With wasted arms and hungering eyes, to bring"
9840,ENCELADUS,The armoured seraphim down upon their knees
9841,ENCELADUS,And teach eternal God humility;
9842,ENCELADUS,The solemn beauty of the unfulfilled
9843,ENCELADUS,Moving towards fulfilment on a height
9844,ENCELADUS,Beyond all heights; the dreadful beauty of hope;
9845,ENCELADUS,The naked wrestler struggling from the rock
9846,ENCELADUS,Under the sculptor's chisel; the rough mass
9847,ENCELADUS,Of clay more glorious for the poor blind face
9848,ENCELADUS,"And bosom that half emerge into the light,"
9849,ENCELADUS,"More glorious and august, even in defeat,"

9966,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","But, as ye praise them, your own cry"
9967,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Is fraught with deeper pain,"
9968,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",And the Compassionate ye deny
9969,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Returns, returns again."
9970,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",
9971,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","O, worshippers of the beautiful,"
9972,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Is this the end then, this,--"
9973,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",That ye can only see the skull
9974,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Beneath the face of bliss?
9975,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",No monk in the dark years ye scorn
9976,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",So barren a pathway trod
9977,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","As ye who, ceasing not to mourn,"
9978,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Deny the mourner's God.
9979,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",
9980,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","And, while ye scoff, on every side"
9981,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Great hints of Him go by,--"
9982,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Souls that are hourly crucified
9983,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",On some new Calvary!
9984,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","O, tortured faces, white and meek,"
9985,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Half seen amidst the crowd,"
9986,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Grey suffering lips that never speak,"
9987,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",The Glory in the Cloud!
9988,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",
9989,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","_In flower and dust, in chaff and grain,"
9990,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",He binds Himself and dies!
9991,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","We live by His eternal pain,"
9992,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",His hourly sacrifice;
9993,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",The limits of our mortal life
9994,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Are His._ The whisper thrills
9995,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Under the sea's perpetual strife,"
9996,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",And through the sunburnt hills.
9997,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",
9998,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","Darkly, as in a glass, our sight"
9999,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Still gropes thro' Time and Space:
10000,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",We cannot see the Light of Light
10001,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","With angels, face to face:"
10002,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Only the tale His martyrs tell
10003,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",Around the dark earth rings
10004,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",He died and He went down to hell
10005,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",And lives--the King of Kings!
10006,"VICISTI, GALILÆE",
10007,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","And, while ye scoff, from shore to shore,"
10008,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","From sea to moaning sea,"
10009,"VICISTI, GALILÆE","_Eloi_, _Eloi_, goes up once more"

10031,I,"England, my mother,"
10032,I,Lift to my western sweetheart
10033,I,"One full cup of English mead, breathing of the may!"
10034,I,"Pledge the may-flower in her face that you and ah, none other,"
10035,I,Sent her from the mother-land
10036,I,Across the dashing spray.
10037,I,
10038,I,
10039,II,II
10040,II,
10041,II,
10042,II,Hers and yours the story:
10043,II,"Think of it, oh, think of it--"
10044,II,That immortal dream when El Dorado flushed the skies!
10045,II,"Fill the beaker full and drink to Drake's undying glory,"
10046,II,"Yours and hers (Oh, drink of it!)"
10047,II,The dream that never dies.
10048,II,
10049,II,
10050,III,III
10051,III,
10052,III,Yours and hers the free-men
10053,III,Who scanned the stars and westward sung
10054,III,"When a king commanded and the Atlantic thundered ""Nay!"""
10055,III,"Hers as yours the pride is, for Drake our first of seamen"
10056,III,First upon his bow-sprit hung
10057,III,That bunch of English may.
10058,III,

10060,IV,IV
10061,IV,
10062,IV,"Pledge her deep, my mother;"
10063,IV,Through her veins thy life-stream runs!
10064,IV,"Spare a thought, too, sweetheart, for my mother o'er the sea!"
10065,IV,"Younger eyes are yours; but ah, those old eyes and none other"
10066,IV,"Once bedewed the may-flower; once,"
10067,IV,"As yours, were clear and free."
10068,IV,
10069,IV,
10070,V,V
10071,V,
10072,V,"Once! Nay, now as ever"
10073,V,Beats within her ancient heart
10074,V,All the faith that took you forth to seek your heaven alone:
10075,V,"Shadows come and go; but let no shade of doubt dissever,"
10076,V,"Cloak, or cloud, or keep apart"
10077,V,Two souls whose prayer is one.

10079,V,
10080,VI,VI
10081,VI,
10082,VI,"Sweetheart, ah, be tender--"
10083,VI,Tender with her prayer to-night!
10084,VI,"Such a goal might yet be ours!--the battle-flags be furled,"
10085,VI,"All the wars of earth be crushed, if only now your slender"
10086,VI,Hand should grasp her gnarled old hand
10087,VI,And federate the world.
10088,VI,
10089,VI,
10090,VII,VII
10091,VII,
10092,VII,"Foolish it may seem, sweet!"
10093,VII,Still the battle thunder lours:
10094,VII,Darker look the Dreadnoughts as old Europe goes her way!
10095,VII,"Yet your hand, your hand, has power to crush that evil dream, sweet;"
10096,VII,"You, with younger eyes than ours"
10097,VII,And brows of English may.

10102,VIII,If a singer cherishes
10103,VIII,"Idle dreams or idle words,"
10104,VIII,"You shall judge--and you'll forgive: for, far away or nigh,"
10105,VIII,Still abides that Vision without which a people perishes:
10106,VIII,Love will strike the atoning chords!
10107,VIII,Hark--there comes a cry!
10108,VIII,
10109,VIII,
10110,IX,IX
10111,IX,
10112,IX,"Over all this earth, sweet,"
10113,IX,The poor and weak look up to you--
10114,IX,"Lift their burdened shoulders, stretch their fettered hands in prayer:"
10115,IX,"You, with gentle hands, can bring the world-wide dream to birth, sweet,"
10116,IX,While I lift this cup to you
10117,IX,And wonder--will she care?
10118,IX,
10119,IX,
10120,X,X
10121,X,
10122,X,"Kindle, eyes, and beat, heart!"
10123,X,Hold the brimming breaker up!
10124,X,All the may is burgeoning from East to golden West!
10125,X,"England, my mother, greet America, my sweetheart:"
10126,X,"--Ah, but ere I drained the cup"
10127,X,I found her on your breast.

10132,EXORDIUM,EXORDIUM
10133,EXORDIUM,
10134,EXORDIUM,
10135,EXORDIUM,"When on the highest ridge of that strange land,"
10136,EXORDIUM,"Under the cloudless blinding tropic blue,"
10137,EXORDIUM,Drake and his band of swarthy seamen stood
10138,EXORDIUM,"With dazed eyes gazing round them, emerald fans"
10139,EXORDIUM,Of palm that fell like fountains over cliffs
10140,EXORDIUM,Of gorgeous red anana bloom obscured
10141,EXORDIUM,Their sight on every side. Illustrious gleams
10142,EXORDIUM,Of rose and green and gold streamed from the plumes
10143,EXORDIUM,That flashed like living rainbows through the glades.
10144,EXORDIUM,"Piratic glints of musketoon and sword,"
10145,EXORDIUM,"The scarlet scarves around the tawny throats,"
10146,EXORDIUM,"The bright gold ear-rings in the sun-black ears,"
10147,EXORDIUM,And the calm faces of the negro guides
10148,EXORDIUM,Opposed their barbarous bravery to the noon;
10149,EXORDIUM,Yet a deep silence dreadfully besieged
10150,EXORDIUM,Even those mighty hearts upon the verge
10151,EXORDIUM,Of the undiscovered world. Behind them lay
10152,EXORDIUM,The old earth they knew. In front they could not see
10153,EXORDIUM,What lay beyond the ridge. Only they heard
10154,EXORDIUM,Cries of the painted birds troubling the heat
10155,EXORDIUM,And shivering through the woods; till Francis Drake
10156,EXORDIUM,"Plunged through the hush, took hold upon a tree,"
10157,EXORDIUM,"The tallest near them, and clomb upward, branch"
10158,EXORDIUM,By branch.
10159,EXORDIUM,"And there, as he swung clear above"
10160,EXORDIUM,"The steep-down forest, on his wondering eyes,"
10161,EXORDIUM,"Mile upon mile of rugged shimmering gold,"
10162,EXORDIUM,Burst the unknown immeasurable sea.
10163,EXORDIUM,Then he descended; and with a new voice
10164,EXORDIUM,"Vowed that, God helping, he would one day plough"
10165,EXORDIUM,Those virgin waters with an English keel.
10166,EXORDIUM,
10167,EXORDIUM,"So here before the unattempted task,"
10168,EXORDIUM,Above the Golden Ocean of my dream
10169,EXORDIUM,I clomb and saw in splendid pageant pass
10170,EXORDIUM,The wild adventures and heroic deeds
10171,EXORDIUM,"Of England's epic age, a vision lit"
10172,EXORDIUM,"With mighty prophecies, fraught with a doom"
10173,EXORDIUM,"Worthy the great Homeric roll of song,"
10174,EXORDIUM,Yet all unsung and unrecorded quite
10175,EXORDIUM,By those who might have touched with Raphael's hand
10176,EXORDIUM,"The large imperial legend of our race,"
10177,EXORDIUM,"Ere it brought forth the braggarts of an hour,"
10178,EXORDIUM,"Self-worshippers who love their imaged strength,"
10179,EXORDIUM,And as a symbol for their own proud selves
10180,EXORDIUM,"Misuse the sacred name of this dear land,"
10181,EXORDIUM,While England to the Empire of her soul
10182,EXORDIUM,Like some great Prophet passes through the crowd
10183,EXORDIUM,That cannot understand; for he must climb
10184,EXORDIUM,Up to that sovran thunder-smitten peak
10185,EXORDIUM,Where he shall grave and trench on adamant
10186,EXORDIUM,The Law that God shall utter by the still
10187,EXORDIUM,"Small voice, not by the whirlwind or the fire."
10188,EXORDIUM,There labouring for the Highest in himself
10189,EXORDIUM,He shall achieve the good of all mankind;
10190,EXORDIUM,And from that lonely Sinai shall return
10191,EXORDIUM,Triumphant o'er the little gods of gold
10192,EXORDIUM,That rule their little hour upon the plain.
10193,EXORDIUM,
10194,EXORDIUM,"Oh, thou blind master of these opened eyes"
10195,EXORDIUM,"Be near me, therefore, now; for not in pride"
10196,EXORDIUM,I lift lame hands to this imperious theme;
10197,EXORDIUM,But yearning to a power above mine own
10198,EXORDIUM,Even as a man might lift his hands in prayer.
10199,EXORDIUM,"Or as a child, perchance, in those dark days"
10200,EXORDIUM,When London lay beleaguered and the axe
10201,EXORDIUM,Flashed out for a bigot empire; and the blood
10202,EXORDIUM,Of martyrs made a purple path for Spain
10203,EXORDIUM,Up to the throne of Mary; as a child
10204,EXORDIUM,Gathering with friends upon a winter's morn
10205,EXORDIUM,For some mock fight between the hateful prince
10206,EXORDIUM,"Philip and Thomas Wyatt, all at once"
10207,EXORDIUM,Might see in gorgeous ruffs embastioned
10208,EXORDIUM,"Popinjay plumes and slouching hats of Spain,"
10209,EXORDIUM,"Gay shimmering silks and rich encrusted gems,"
10210,EXORDIUM,"Gold collars, rare brocades, and sleek trunk-hose"
10211,EXORDIUM,The Ambassador and peacock courtiers come
10212,EXORDIUM,"Strutting along the white snow-strangled street,"
10213,EXORDIUM,"A walking plot of scarlet Spanish flowers,"
10214,EXORDIUM,And with one cry a hundred boyish hands
10215,EXORDIUM,"Put them to flight with snowballs, while the wind"
10216,EXORDIUM,All round their Spanish ears hissed like a flight
10217,EXORDIUM,Of white-winged geese; so may I wage perchance
10218,EXORDIUM,"A mimic war with all my heart in it,"
10219,EXORDIUM,Munitioned with mere perishable snow
10220,EXORDIUM,Which mightier hands one day will urge with steel.
10221,EXORDIUM,Yet may they still remember me as I
10222,EXORDIUM,"Remember, with one little laugh of love,"
10223,EXORDIUM,"That child's game, this were wealth enough for me."
10224,EXORDIUM,
10225,EXORDIUM,"Mother and love, fair England, hear my prayer;"
10226,EXORDIUM,Help me that I may tell the enduring tale
10227,EXORDIUM,"Of that great seaman, good at need, who first"
10228,EXORDIUM,"Sailed round this globe and made one little isle,"
10229,EXORDIUM,One little isle against that huge Empire
10230,EXORDIUM,"Of Spain whose might was paramount on earth,"
10231,EXORDIUM,"O'ertopping Babylon, Nineveh, Greece, and Rome,"
10232,EXORDIUM,"Carthage and all huge Empires of the past,"
10233,EXORDIUM,"He made this little isle, against the world,"
10234,EXORDIUM,Queen of the earth and sea. Nor this alone
10235,EXORDIUM,"The theme; for, in a mightier strife engaged"
10236,EXORDIUM,"Even than he knew, he fought for the new faiths,"
10237,EXORDIUM,Championing our manhood as it rose
10238,EXORDIUM,And cast its feudal chains before the seat
10239,EXORDIUM,"Of kings; nay, in a mightier battle yet"
10240,EXORDIUM,"He fought for the soul's freedom, fought the fight"
10241,EXORDIUM,"Which, though it still rings in our wondering ears,"
10242,EXORDIUM,"Was won then and for ever--that great war,"
10243,EXORDIUM,"That last Crusade of Christ against His priests,"
10244,EXORDIUM,Wherein Spain fell behind a thunderous roar
10245,EXORDIUM,Of ocean triumph over burning ships
10246,EXORDIUM,"And shattered fleets, while England, England rose,"
10247,EXORDIUM,"Her white cliffs laughing out across the waves,"
10248,EXORDIUM,Victorious over all her enemies.
10249,EXORDIUM,
10250,EXORDIUM,"And while he won the world for her domain,"
10251,EXORDIUM,"Her loins brought forth, her fostering bosom fed"
10252,EXORDIUM,Souls that have swept the spiritual seas
10253,EXORDIUM,"From heaven to hell, and justified her crown."
10254,EXORDIUM,For round the throne of great Elizabeth
10255,EXORDIUM,"Spenser and Burleigh, Sidney and Verulam,"
10256,EXORDIUM,"Clustered like stars, rare Jonson like the crown"
10257,EXORDIUM,"Of Cassiopeia, Marlowe ruddy as Mars,"
10258,EXORDIUM,And over all those mighty hearts arose
10259,EXORDIUM,The soul of Shakespeare brooding far and wide
10260,EXORDIUM,"Beyond our small horizons, like a light"
10261,EXORDIUM,Thrown from a vaster sun that still illumes
10262,EXORDIUM,Tracts which the arc of our increasing day
10263,EXORDIUM,"Must still leave undiscovered, unexplored."
10264,EXORDIUM,
10265,EXORDIUM,"Mother and love, fair England, hear my prayer,"
10266,EXORDIUM,As thou didst touch the heart and light the flame
10267,EXORDIUM,Of wonder in those eyes which first awoke
10268,EXORDIUM,To beauty and the sea's adventurous dream
10269,EXORDIUM,"Three hundred years ago, three hundred years,"
10270,EXORDIUM,"And five long decades, in the leafy lanes"
10271,EXORDIUM,"Of Devon, where the tallest trees that bore"
10272,EXORDIUM,The raven's matted nest had yielded up
10273,EXORDIUM,"Their booty, while the perilous branches swayed"
10274,EXORDIUM,"Beneath the boyish privateer, the king"
10275,EXORDIUM,"Of many young companions, Francis Drake;"
10276,EXORDIUM,"So hear me, and so help, for more than his"
10277,EXORDIUM,"My need is, even than when he first set sail"
10278,EXORDIUM,Upon that wild adventure with three ships
10279,EXORDIUM,"And three-score men from grey old Plymouth Sound,"
10280,EXORDIUM,"Not knowing if he went to life or death,"
10281,EXORDIUM,"Not caring greatly, so that he were true"
10282,EXORDIUM,To his own sleepless and unfaltering soul
10283,EXORDIUM,Which could not choose but hear the ringing call
10284,EXORDIUM,Across the splendours of the Spanish Main
10285,EXORDIUM,"From ever fading, ever new horizons,"
10286,EXORDIUM,And shores beyond the sunset and the sea.
10287,EXORDIUM,
10288,EXORDIUM,"Mother and sweetheart, England; from whose breast,"
10289,EXORDIUM,"With all the world before them, they went forth,"
10290,EXORDIUM,"Thy seamen, o'er the wide uncharted waste,"
10291,EXORDIUM,"Wider than that Ulysses roamed of old,"
10292,EXORDIUM,Even as the wine-dark Mediterranean
10293,EXORDIUM,Is wider than some wave-relinquished pool
10294,EXORDIUM,"Among its rocks, yet none the less explored"
10295,EXORDIUM,To greater ends than all the pride of Greece
10296,EXORDIUM,And pomp of Rome achieved; if my poor song
10297,EXORDIUM,"Now spread too wide a sail, forgive thy son"
10298,EXORDIUM,"And lover, for thy love was ever wont"
10299,EXORDIUM,To lift men up in pride above themselves
10300,EXORDIUM,To do great deeds which of themselves alone
10301,EXORDIUM,They could not; thou hast led the unfaltering feet
10302,EXORDIUM,"Of even thy meanest heroes down to death,"
10303,EXORDIUM,"Lifted poor knights to many a great emprise,"
10304,EXORDIUM,"Taught them high thoughts, and though they kept their souls"
10305,EXORDIUM,"Lowly as little children, bidden them lift"
10306,EXORDIUM,Eyes unappalled by all the myriad stars
10307,EXORDIUM,That wheel around the great white throne of God.
10308,EXORDIUM,
10309,EXORDIUM,
10310,BOOK I,BOOK I
10311,BOOK I,
10312,BOOK I,Now through the great doors of the Council-room
10313,BOOK I,Magnificently streamed in rich array
10314,BOOK I,"The peers of England, regal of aspèct"
10315,BOOK I,And grave. Their silence waited for the Queen:
10316,BOOK I,"And even now she came; and through their midst,"
10317,BOOK I,"Low as they bowed, she passed without a smile"
10318,BOOK I,And took her royal seat. A bodeful hush
10319,BOOK I,"Of huge anticipation gripped all hearts,"
10320,BOOK I,"Compressed all brows, and loaded the broad noon"
10321,BOOK I,With gathering thunder: none knew what the hour
10322,BOOK I,Might yet bring forth; but the dark fire of war
10323,BOOK I,Smouldered in every eye; for every day
10324,BOOK I,The Council met debating how to join
10325,BOOK I,"Honour with peace, and every day new tales"
10326,BOOK I,Of English wrongs received from the red hands
10327,BOOK I,"Of that gigantic Empire, insolent"
10328,BOOK I,"Spain, spurred fiercer resentments up like steeds"
10329,BOOK I,"Revolting, on the curb, foaming for battle,"
10330,BOOK I,"In all men's minds, against whatever odds."
10331,BOOK I,"On one side of the throne great Walsingham,"
10332,BOOK I,"A lion of England, couchant, watchful, calm,"
10333,BOOK I,Was now the master of opinion: all
10334,BOOK I,Drew to him. Even the hunchback Burleigh smiled
10335,BOOK I,"With half-ironic admiration now,"
10336,BOOK I,As in the presence of the Queen they met
10337,BOOK I,"Amid the sweeping splendours of her court,"
10338,BOOK I,"A cynic smile that seemed to say, ""I, too,"
10339,BOOK I,Would fain regain that forthright heart of fire;
10340,BOOK I,Yet statesmanship is but a smoother name
10341,BOOK I,For the superior cunning which ensures
10342,BOOK I,"Victory."" And the Queen, too, knowing her strength"
10343,BOOK I,"And weakness, though her woman's heart leaped out"
10344,BOOK I,"To courage, yet with woman's craft preferred"
10345,BOOK I,The subtler strength of Burleigh; for she knew
10346,BOOK I,Mary of Scotland waited for that war
10347,BOOK I,To strike her in the side for Rome; she knew
10348,BOOK I,How many thousands lurked in England still
10349,BOOK I,Remembering Rome and bloody Mary's reign.
10350,BOOK I,France o'er a wall of bleeding Huguenots
10351,BOOK I,Watched for an hour to strike. Against all these
10352,BOOK I,"What shield could England raise, this little isle,--"
10353,BOOK I,"Out-matched, outnumbered, perilously near"
10354,BOOK I,Utter destruction?
10355,BOOK I,
10356,BOOK I,So the long debate
10357,BOOK I,Proceeded.
10358,BOOK I,
10359,BOOK I,All at once there came a cry
10360,BOOK I,Along the streets and at the palace-gates
10361,BOOK I,And at the great doors of the Council-room!
10362,BOOK I,Then through the pikes and halberds a voice rose
10363,BOOK I,"Imperative for entrance, and the guards"
10364,BOOK I,"Made way, and a strange whisper surged around,"
10365,BOOK I,And through the peers of England thrilled the blood
10366,BOOK I,Of Agincourt as to the foot of the throne
10367,BOOK I,"Came Leicester, for behind him as he came"
10368,BOOK I,"A seaman stumbled, travel-stained and torn,"
10369,BOOK I,"Crying for justice, and gasped out his tale."
10370,BOOK I,"""The Spaniards,"" he moaned, ""the Inquisition!"
10371,BOOK I,"They have taken all my comrades, all our crew,"
10372,BOOK I,And flung them into dungeons: there they lie
10373,BOOK I,"Waiting for England, waiting for their Queen!"
10374,BOOK I,Will you not free them? I alone am left!
10375,BOOK I,"All London is afire with it, for this"
10376,BOOK I,Was one of your chief city merchant's ships--
10377,BOOK I,"The _Pride of London_, one of Osborne's ships!"
10378,BOOK I,But there is none to help them! I escaped
10379,BOOK I,"With shrieks of torment ringing in these ears,"
10380,BOOK I,The glare of torture-chambers in these eyes
10381,BOOK I,That see no faces anywhere but blind
10382,BOOK I,"Blind faces, each a bruise of white that smiles"
10383,BOOK I,"In idiot agony, washed with sweat and blood,"
10384,BOOK I,"The face of some strange thing that once was man,"
10385,BOOK I,And now can only turn from side to side
10386,BOOK I,"Babbling like a child, with mouth agape,"
10387,BOOK I,And crying for help where there is none to hear
10388,BOOK I,"Save those black vizards in the furnace-glow,"
10389,BOOK I,"Moving like devils at their hellish trade...."""
10390,BOOK I,"He paused; his memory sickened, his brain swooned"
10391,BOOK I,Back into that wild glare of obscene pain!
10392,BOOK I,Once more to his ears and nostrils horribly crept
10393,BOOK I,The hiss and smell of shrivelling human flesh!
10394,BOOK I,His dumb stare told the rest: his head sank down;
10395,BOOK I,He strove in agony
10396,BOOK I,With what all hideous words must leave untold;
10397,BOOK I,"While Leicester vouched him, ""This man's tale is true!"""
10398,BOOK I,But like a gathering storm a low deep moan
10399,BOOK I,"Of passion, like a tiger's, slowly crept"
10400,BOOK I,"From the grey lips of Walsingham. ""My Queen,"
10401,BOOK I,"Will you not free them?"""
10402,BOOK I,
10403,BOOK I,"Then Elizabeth,"
10404,BOOK I,Whose name is one for ever with the name
10405,BOOK I,"Of England, rose; and in her face the gleam"
10406,BOOK I,Of justice that makes anger terrible
10407,BOOK I,"Shone, and she stretched her glittering sceptre forth"
10408,BOOK I,"And spoke, with distant empires in her eyes."
10409,BOOK I,
10410,BOOK I,"""My lords, this is the last cry they shall wring"
10411,BOOK I,From English lips unheeded: we will have
10412,BOOK I,Such remedies for this as all the world
10413,BOOK I,"Shall tremble at!"""
10414,BOOK I,"And, on that night, while Drake"
10415,BOOK I,Close in his London lodging lay concealed
10416,BOOK I,Until he knew if it were peace or war
10417,BOOK I,With Spain (for he had struck on the high seas
10418,BOOK I,At Spain; and well he knew if it were peace
10419,BOOK I,"His blood would be made witness to that bond,"
10420,BOOK I,And he must die a pirate's death or fly
10421,BOOK I,"Westward once more), there all alone, he pored"
10422,BOOK I,By a struggling rushlight o'er a well-thumbed chart
10423,BOOK I,"Of magic islands in the enchanted seas,"
10424,BOOK I,"Dreaming, as boys and poets only dream"
10425,BOOK I,"With those that see God's wonders in the deep,"
10426,BOOK I,"Perilous visions of those palmy keys,"
10427,BOOK I,"Cocoa-nut islands, parrot-haunted woods,"
10428,BOOK I,Crisp coral reefs and blue shark-finned lagoons
10429,BOOK I,"Fringed with the creaming foam, mile upon mile"
10430,BOOK I,"Of mystery. Dream after dream went by,"
10431,BOOK I,Colouring the brown air of that London night
10432,BOOK I,With many a mad miraculous romance.
10433,BOOK I,
10434,BOOK I,"There, suddenly, some augury, some flash"
10435,BOOK I,"Showed him a coming promise, a strange hint,"
10436,BOOK I,"Which, though he played with it, he scarce believed;"
10437,BOOK I,Strange as in some dark cave the first fierce gleam
10438,BOOK I,Of pirate gold to some forlorn maroon
10439,BOOK I,Who tiptoes to the heap and glances round
10440,BOOK I,"Askance, and dreads to hear what erst he longed"
10441,BOOK I,To hear--some voice to break the hush; but bathes
10442,BOOK I,"Both hands with childish laughter in the gold,"
10443,BOOK I,"And lets it trickle through his fevered palms,"
10444,BOOK I,And begins counting half a hundred times
10445,BOOK I,And loses count each time for sheer delight
10446,BOOK I,"And wonder in it; meantime, if he knew,"
10447,BOOK I,"Passing the cave-mouth, far away, beyond"
10448,BOOK I,"The still lagoon, the coral reef, the foam"
10449,BOOK I,"And the white fluttering chatter of the birds,"
10450,BOOK I,A sail that might have saved him comes and goes
10451,BOOK I,Unseen across the blue Pacific sea.
10452,BOOK I,"So Drake, too, played with fancies; but that sail"
10453,BOOK I,"Passed not unseen, for suddenly there came"
10454,BOOK I,"A firm and heavy footstep to the door,"
10455,BOOK I,"Then a loud knocking: and, at first, he thought"
10456,BOOK I,"""I am a dead man: there is peace with Spain,"
10457,BOOK I,"And they are come to lead me to my doom."""
10458,BOOK I,"But, as he looked across one shoulder, pride"
10459,BOOK I,"Checking the fuller watch for what he feared,"
10460,BOOK I,The door opened; and cold as from the sea
10461,BOOK I,"The night rushed in, and there against the gloom,"
10462,BOOK I,"Clad, as it seemed, with wind and cloud and rain,"
10463,BOOK I,There loomed a stately form and high grim face
10464,BOOK I,Loaded with deadly thoughts of iron war--
10465,BOOK I,"Walsingham,--in one hand he held a map"
10466,BOOK I,Marked with red lines; the other hand held down
10467,BOOK I,The rich encrusted hilt of his great sword.
10468,BOOK I,"Then Drake rose, and the other cautiously"
10469,BOOK I,Closing the door drew near the flickering light
10470,BOOK I,"And spread his map out on the table, saying--"
10471,BOOK I,"""Mark for me here the points whereat the King"
10472,BOOK I,"Philip of Spain may best be wounded, mark"
10473,BOOK I,"The joints of his harness;"" and Drake looked at him"
10474,BOOK I,"Thinking, ""If he betray me, I am dead."""
10475,BOOK I,
10476,BOOK I,"But the soldier met his eyes and, with a laugh,"
10477,BOOK I,"Drake, quivering like a bloodhound in the leash,"
10478,BOOK I,"Stooped, with his finger pointing thus and thus--"
10479,BOOK I,"""Here would I guard, here would I lie in wait,"
10480,BOOK I,"Here would I strike him through the breast and throat."""
10481,BOOK I,"And as he spoke he kindled, and began"
10482,BOOK I,"To set forth his great dreams, and high romance"
10483,BOOK I,Rose like a moon reflecting the true sun
10484,BOOK I,Unseen; and as the full round moon indeed
10485,BOOK I,Rising behind a mighty mountain-chain
10486,BOOK I,Will shadow forth in outline grim and black
10487,BOOK I,"Its vast and ragged edges, so that moon"
10488,BOOK I,Of high romance rose greatly shadowing forth
10489,BOOK I,"The grandeur of his dreams, until their might"
10490,BOOK I,"Dawned upon Walsingham, and he, too, saw"
10491,BOOK I,For a moment of muffled moonlight and wild cloud
10492,BOOK I,The vision of the imperious years to be!
10493,BOOK I,But suddenly Drake paused as one who strays
10494,BOOK I,"Beyond the bounds of caution, paused and cursed"
10495,BOOK I,His tongue for prating like a moon-struck boy's.
10496,BOOK I,"""I am mad,"" he cried, ""I am mad to babble so!"""
10497,BOOK I,Then Walsingham drew near him with strange eyes
10498,BOOK I,"And muttered slowly, ""Write that madness down;"
10499,BOOK I,"Ay, write it down, that madman's plan of thine;"
10500,BOOK I,"Sign it, and let me take it to the Queen."""
10501,BOOK I,But the weather-wiser seaman warily
10502,BOOK I,"Answered him, ""If it please Almighty God"
10503,BOOK I,"To take away our Queen Elizabeth,"
10504,BOOK I,"Seeing that she is mortal as ourselves,"
10505,BOOK I,"England might then be leagued with Spain, and I"
10506,BOOK I,Should here have sealed my doom. I will not put
10507,BOOK I,"My pen to paper."""
10508,BOOK I,"So, across the charts"
10509,BOOK I,With that dim light on each grim countenance
10510,BOOK I,The seaman and the courtier subtly fenced
10511,BOOK I,"With words and thoughts, but neither would betray"
10512,BOOK I,His whole heart to the other. At the last
10513,BOOK I,Walsingham gripped the hand of Francis Drake
10514,BOOK I,And left him wondering.
10515,BOOK I,
10516,BOOK I,On the third night came
10517,BOOK I,A messenger from Walsingham who bade
10518,BOOK I,"Drake to the Palace where, without one word,"
10519,BOOK I,The statesman met him in an anteroom
10520,BOOK I,"And led him, with flushed cheek and beating heart,"
10521,BOOK I,Along a mighty gold-gloomed corridor
10522,BOOK I,"Into a high-arched chamber, hung with tall"
10523,BOOK I,Curtains of gold-fringed silk and tapestries
10524,BOOK I,"From Flanders looms, whereon were flowers and beasts"
10525,BOOK I,"And forest-work, great knights, with hawk on hand,"
10526,BOOK I,Riding for ever on their glimmering steeds
10527,BOOK I,Through bowery glades to some immortal face
10528,BOOK I,Beyond the fairy fringes of the world.
10529,BOOK I,"A silver lamp swung softly overhead,"
10530,BOOK I,Fed with some perfumed oil that shed abroad
10531,BOOK I,Delicious light and fragrances as rare
10532,BOOK I,As those that stirred faint wings at eventide
10533,BOOK I,Through the King's House in Lebanon of old.
10534,BOOK I,Into a quietness as of fallen bloom
10535,BOOK I,"Their feet sank in that chamber; and, all round,"
10536,BOOK I,Soft hills of Moorish cushions dimly drowsed
10537,BOOK I,On glimmering crimson couches. Near the lamp
10538,BOOK I,An ebony chess-board stood inlaid with squares
10539,BOOK I,"Of ruby and emerald, garnished with cinquefoils"
10540,BOOK I,"Of silver, bears and ragged staves; the men,"
10541,BOOK I,"Likewise of precious stones, were all arrayed--"
10542,BOOK I,Bishops and knights and elephants and pawns--
10543,BOOK I,As for a game. Sixteen of them were set
10544,BOOK I,"In silver white, the other sixteen gilt."
10545,BOOK I,"Now, as Drake gazed upon an arras, nigh"
10546,BOOK I,"The farther doors, whereon was richly wrought"
10547,BOOK I,The picture of that grave and lovely queen
10548,BOOK I,"Penelope, with cold hands weaving still"
10549,BOOK I,"The unending web, while in an outer court"
10550,BOOK I,The broad-limbed wooers basking in the sun
10551,BOOK I,"On purple fleeces took from white-armed girls,"
10552,BOOK I,"Up-kirtled to the knee, the crimson wine;"
10553,BOOK I,"There, as he gazed and thought, ""Is this not like"
10554,BOOK I,"Our Queen Elizabeth who waits and weaves,"
10555,BOOK I,"Penelope of England, her dark web"
10556,BOOK I,"Unendingly till England's Empire come;"""
10557,BOOK I,"There, as he gazed, for a moment, he could vow"
10558,BOOK I,The pictured arras moved. Well had it been
10559,BOOK I,Had he drawn sword and pierced it through and through;
10560,BOOK I,But he suspected nothing and said nought
10561,BOOK I,To Walsingham; for thereupon they heard
10562,BOOK I,The sound of a low lute and a sweet voice
10563,BOOK I,"Carolling like a gold-caged nightingale,"
10564,BOOK I,"Caught by the fowlers ere he found his mate,"
10565,BOOK I,And singing all his heart out evermore
10566,BOOK I,To the unknown forest-love he ne'er should see.
10567,BOOK I,"And Walsingham smiled sadly to himself,"
10568,BOOK I,Knowing the weary queen had bidden some maid
10569,BOOK I,"Sing to her, even as David sang to Saul;"
10570,BOOK I,Since all her heart was bitter with her love
10571,BOOK I,"Or so it was breathed (and there the chess-board stood,"
10572,BOOK I,"Her love's device upon it), though she still,"
10573,BOOK I,"For England's sake, must keep great foreign kings"
10574,BOOK I,"Her suitors, wedding no man till she died."
10575,BOOK I,"Nor did she know how, in her happiest hour"
10576,BOOK I,"Remembered now most sorrowfully, the moon,"
10577,BOOK I,"Vicegerent of the sky, through summer dews,"
10578,BOOK I,"As that sweet ballad tells in plaintive rhyme,"
10579,BOOK I,Silvering the grey old Cumnor towers and all
10580,BOOK I,"The hollow haunted oaks that grew thereby,"
10581,BOOK I,Gleamed on a casement whence the pure white face
10582,BOOK I,"Of Amy Robsart, wife of Leicester, wife"
10583,BOOK I,"Unknown of the Queen's lover, a frail bar"
10584,BOOK I,"To that proud Earl's ambition, quietly gazed"
10585,BOOK I,And heard the night-owl hoot a dark presage
10586,BOOK I,Of murder through her timid shuddering heart.
10587,BOOK I,But of that deed Elizabeth knew nought;
10588,BOOK I,"Nay, white as Amy Robsart in her dream"
10589,BOOK I,"Of love she listened to the sobbing lute,"
10590,BOOK I,"Bitterly happy, proudly desolate;"
10591,BOOK I,So heavy are all earth's crowns and sharp with thorns!
10592,BOOK I,But tenderly that high-born maiden sang.
10593,BOOK I,
10594,BOOK I,
10595,SONG,SONG
10596,SONG,
10597,SONG,"_Now the purple night is past,"
10598,SONG,"Now the moon more faintly glows,"
10599,SONG,Dawn has through thy casement cast

10612,SONG,"Beauties perish, one by one,"
10613,SONG,"Let not love go, too._"
10614,SONG,
10615,SONG,_Palaces and towers of pride
10616,SONG,Crumble year by year away;
10617,SONG,"Creeds like robes are laid aside,"
10618,SONG,Even our very tombs decay!
10619,SONG,When the all-conquering moth and rust
10620,SONG,"Gnaw the goodly garment through,"

10622,SONG,"Let not love go, too._"
10623,SONG,

10630,SONG,"Father, hear Thy children call,"
10631,SONG,"Let not love go, too._"
10632,SONG,
10633,SONG,The song ceased: all was still; and now it seemed
10634,SONG,"Power brooded on the silence, and Drake saw"
10635,SONG,"A woman come to meet him,--tall and pale"
10636,SONG,And proud she seemed: behind her head two wings
10637,SONG,As of some mighty phantom butterfly
10638,SONG,Glimmered with jewel-sparks in the gold gloom.
10639,SONG,"Her small, pure, grey-eyed face above her ruff"
10640,SONG,Was chiselled like an agate; and he knew
10641,SONG,It was the Queen. Low bent he o'er her hand;
10642,SONG,"And ""Ah,"" she said, ""Sir Francis Walsingham"
10643,SONG,Hath told me what an English heart beats here!
10644,SONG,Know you what injuries the King of Spain
10645,SONG,"Hath done us?"" Drake looked up at her: she smiled,"
10646,SONG,"""We find you apt! Will you not be our knight"
10647,SONG,"For we are helpless""--witchingly she smiled--"
10648,SONG,"""We are not ripe for war; our policy"
10649,SONG,Must still be to uphold the velvet cloak
10650,SONG,Of peace; but I would have it mask the hand
10651,SONG,That holds the dagger! Will you not unfold
10652,SONG,"Your scheme to us?"" And then with a low bow"
10653,SONG,"Walsingham, at a signal from the Queen,"
10654,SONG,Withdrew; and she looked down at Drake and smiled;
10655,SONG,And in his great simplicity the man
10656,SONG,Spake all his heart out like some youthful knight
10657,SONG,"Before his Gloriana: his heart burned,"
10658,SONG,"Knowing he talked with England, face to face;"
10659,SONG,"And suddenly the Queen bent down to him,"
10660,SONG,"England bent down to him, and his heart reeled"
10661,SONG,With the beauty of her presence--for indeed
10662,SONG,Women alone have royal power like this
10663,SONG,Within their very selves enthroned and shrined
10664,SONG,To draw men's hearts out! Royal she bent down
10665,SONG,"And touched his hand for a moment. ""Friend,"" she said,"
10666,SONG,"Looking into his face with subtle eyes,"
10667,SONG,"""I have searched thy soul to-night and know full well"
10668,SONG,"How I can trust thee! Canst thou think that I,"
10669,SONG,"The daughter of my royal father, lack"
10670,SONG,The fire which every boor in England feels
10671,SONG,Burning within him as the bloody score
10672,SONG,Which Spain writes on the flesh of Englishmen
10673,SONG,Mounts higher day by day? Am I not Tudor?
10674,SONG,I am not deaf or blind; nor yet a king!
10675,SONG,"I am a woman and a queen, and where"
10676,SONG,Kings would have plunged into their red revenge
10677,SONG,"Or set their throne up on this temporal shore,"
10678,SONG,"As flatterers bade that wiser king Canúte,"
10679,SONG,Thence to command the advancing tides of battle
10680,SONG,Till one ensanguined sea whelm throne and king
10681,SONG,"And kingdom, friend, I take my woman's way,"
10682,SONG,Smile in mine enemies' faces with a heart
10683,SONG,"All hell, and undermine them hour by hour!"
10684,SONG,"This island scarce can fend herself from France,"
10685,SONG,"And now Spain holds the keys of all the world,"
10686,SONG,"How should we fight her, save that my poor wit"
10687,SONG,"Hath won the key to Philip? Oh, I know"
10688,SONG,"His treacherous lecherous heart, and hour by hour"
10689,SONG,"My nets are drawing round him. I, that starve"
10690,SONG,"My public armies, feed his private foes,"
10691,SONG,"Nourish his rebels in the Netherlands,"
10692,SONG,"Nay, sacrifice mine own poor woman's heart"
10693,SONG,"To keep him mine, and surely now stands Fate"
10694,SONG,With hand uplifted by the doors of Spain
10695,SONG,Ready to knock: the time is close at hand
10696,SONG,"When I shall strike, once, and no second stroke."
10697,SONG,"Remember, friend, though kings have fought for her,"
10698,SONG,"This England, with the trident in her grasp,"
10699,SONG,Was ever woman; and she waits her throne;
10700,SONG,"And thou canst speed it. Furnish thee with ships,"
10701,SONG,"Gather thy gentleman adventurers,"
10702,SONG,And be assured thy parsimonious queen--
10703,SONG,"Oh ay, she knows that chattering of the world--"
10704,SONG,"Will find thee wealth enough. Then put to sea,"
10705,SONG,Fly the black flag of piracy awhile
10706,SONG,Against these blackest foes of all mankind.
10707,SONG,Nay; what hast thou to do with piracy?
10708,SONG,_Hostis humani generis_ indeed
10709,SONG,Is Spain: she dwells beyond the bounds of law;
10710,SONG,"Thine is no piracy, whate'er men say,"
10711,SONG,Thou art a knight on Gloriana's quest.
10712,SONG,"Oh, lay that golden unction to thy soul,"
10713,SONG,"This is no piracy, but glorious war,"
10714,SONG,"Waged for thy country and for all mankind,"
10715,SONG,"Therefore put out to sea without one fear,"
10716,SONG,"Ransack their El Dorados of the West,"
10717,SONG,"Pillage their golden galleons, sap their strength"
10718,SONG,Even at its utmost fountains; let them know
10719,SONG,"That there is blood, not water, in our veins."
10720,SONG,"Sail on, my captain, to the glorious end,"
10721,SONG,"And, though at first thou needs must sail alone"
10722,SONG,"And undefended, ere that end be reached,"
10723,SONG,"When I shall give the word, nay, but one word,"
10724,SONG,"All England shall be up and after thee,"
10725,SONG,"The sword of England shall shine over thee,"
10726,SONG,And round about thee like a guardian fire;
10727,SONG,All the great soul of England shall be there;
10728,SONG,Her mighty dead shall at that cry of doom
10729,SONG,Rise from their graves and in God's panoply
10730,SONG,Plunge with our standards through immortal storms
10731,SONG,When Drake rides out across the wreck of Rome.
10732,SONG,As yet we must be cautious; let no breath
10733,SONG,"Escape thee, save to thy most trusted friends;"
10734,SONG,"For now, if my lord Burleigh heard one word"
10735,SONG,"Of all thou hast in mind, he is so much"
10736,SONG,"The friend of caution and the beaten road,"
10737,SONG,He would not rest till he had spilled thy hopes
10738,SONG,"And sealed thy doom! Go now, fit out thy ships."
10739,SONG,Walsingham is empowered to give thee gold
10740,SONG,"Immediately, but look to him for more"
10741,SONG,"As thou shalt need it, gold and gold to spare,"
10742,SONG,My golden-hearted pilot to the shores
10743,SONG,"Of victory--so farewell;"" and through the gloom"
10744,SONG,"She vanished as she came; and Drake groped, dazed,"
10745,SONG,"Out through the doors, and found great Walsingham"
10746,SONG,Awaiting him with gold.
10747,SONG,But in the room
10748,SONG,Where Drake had held his converse with the Queen
10749,SONG,"The embroidered arras moved, and a lean face,"
10750,SONG,"White with its long eavesdropping upon death,"
10751,SONG,Crept out and peered as a venomous adder peers
10752,SONG,"From out dark ferns, then as the reptile flashes"
10753,SONG,Along a path between two banks of flowers
10754,SONG,"Almost too swift for sight, a stealthy form"
10755,SONG,--One of the fifty spies whom Burleigh paid--
10756,SONG,Passed down the gold-gloomed corridor to seek
10757,SONG,"His master, whom among great books he found,"
10758,SONG,"Calm, like a mountain brooding o'er the sea."
10759,SONG,Nor did he break that calm for all these winds
10760,SONG,Of rumour that now burst from out the sky.
10761,SONG,"His brow bent like a cliff over his thoughts,"
10762,SONG,"And the spy watched him half resentfully,"
10763,SONG,Thinking his news well worth a blacker frown.
10764,SONG,"At last the statesman smiled and answered, ""Go;"
10765,SONG,"Fetch Thomas Doughty, Leicester's secretary."""
10766,SONG,
10767,SONG,Few suns had risen and set ere Francis Drake
10768,SONG,"Had furnished forth his ships with guns and men,"
10769,SONG,"Tried seamen that he knew in storms of old,--"
10770,SONG,"Will Harvest, who could haul the ropes and fight"
10771,SONG,"All day, and sing a foc'sle song to cheer"
10772,SONG,Sea-weary hearts at night; brave old Tom Moone
10773,SONG,"The carpenter, whose faithful soul looked up"
10774,SONG,To Drake's large mastery with a mastiff's eyes;
10775,SONG,"And three-score trusty mariners, all scarred"
10776,SONG,And weather-beaten. After these there came
10777,SONG,"Some two-score gentleman adventurers,"
10778,SONG,Gay college lads or lawyers that had grown
10779,SONG,"Sick of the dusty Temple, and were fired"
10780,SONG,With tales of the rich Indies and those tall
10781,SONG,"Enchanted galleons drifting through the West,"
10782,SONG,Laden with ingots and broad bars of gold.
10783,SONG,Already some had bought at a great price
10784,SONG,"Green birds of Guatemala, which they wore"
10785,SONG,"On their slouched hats, tasting the high romance"
10786,SONG,And new-found colours of the world like wine.
10787,SONG,By night they gathered in a marvellous inn
10788,SONG,Beside the black and secret flowing Thames;
10789,SONG,And joyously they tossed the magic phrase
10790,SONG,"""Pieces of eight"" from mouth to mouth, and laughed"
10791,SONG,"And held the red wine up, night after night,"
10792,SONG,"Around their tables, toasting Francis Drake."
10793,SONG,"Among these came a courtier, and none knew"
10794,SONG,"Or asked by whose approval, for each thought"
10795,SONG,Some other brought him; yet he made his way
10796,SONG,"Cautiously, being a man with a smooth tongue,"
10797,SONG,The secretary of Leicester; and his name
10798,SONG,Was Thomas Doughty. Most of all with Drake
10799,SONG,"He won his way to friendship, till at last"
10800,SONG,There seemed one heart between them and one soul.

10804,BOOK II,
10805,BOOK II,So on a misty grey December morn
10806,BOOK II,Five ships put out from calm old Plymouth Sound;
10807,BOOK II,"Five little ships, the largest not so large"
10808,BOOK II,As many a coasting yacht or fishing-trawl
10809,BOOK II,To-day; yet these must brave uncharted seas
10810,BOOK II,"Of unimagined terrors, haunted glooms,"
10811,BOOK II,And shadowy horrors of an unknown world
10812,BOOK II,"Wild as primeval chaos. In the first,"
10813,BOOK II,"The _Golden Hynde_, a ship of eighteen guns,"
10814,BOOK II,"Drake sailed: John Wynter, a queen's captain, next"
10815,BOOK II,"Brought out the _Elizabeth_, a stout new ship"
10816,BOOK II,Of sixteen guns. The pinnace _Christopher_
10817,BOOK II,"Came next, in staunch command of old Tom Moone"
10818,BOOK II,"Who, five years back, with reeking powder grimed,"
10819,BOOK II,Off Cartagena fought against the stars
10820,BOOK II,"All night, and, as the sun arose in blood,"
10821,BOOK II,"Knee-deep in blood and brine, stood in the dark"
10822,BOOK II,Perilous hold and scuttled his own ship
10823,BOOK II,"The _Swan_, bidding her down to God's great deep"
10824,BOOK II,Rather than yield her up a prize to Spain.
10825,BOOK II,Lastly two gentleman-adventurers
10826,BOOK II,Brought out the new _Swan_ and the _Marygold_.
10827,BOOK II,"Their crews, all told, were eight score men and boys."
10828,BOOK II,"Not only terrors of the deep they braved,"
10829,BOOK II,"Bodiless witchcrafts of the black abyss,"
10830,BOOK II,Red gaping mouths of hell and gulfs of fire
10831,BOOK II,That yawned for all who passed the tropic line;
10832,BOOK II,But death lurked round them from their setting forth.
10833,BOOK II,"Mendoza, plenipotentiary of Spain,"
10834,BOOK II,"By spies informed, had swiftly warned his king,"
10835,BOOK II,Who sent out mandates through his huge empire
10836,BOOK II,From Gaudalchiber to the golden West
10837,BOOK II,For the instant sinking of all English ships
10838,BOOK II,And the instant execution of their crews
10839,BOOK II,Who durst appear in the Caribbean sea.
10840,BOOK II,"Moreover, in the pith of their emprise"
10841,BOOK II,"A peril lurked--Burleigh's emissaries,"
10842,BOOK II,"The smooth-tongued Thomas Doughty, who had brought"
10843,BOOK II,His brother--unacquitted of that charge
10844,BOOK II,"Of poisoning, raised against him by the friends"
10845,BOOK II,"Of Essex, but in luckless time released"
10846,BOOK II,"Lately for lack of proof, on no strong plea."
10847,BOOK II,These two wound through them like two snakes at ease
10848,BOOK II,"In Eden, waiting for their venomous hour."
10849,BOOK II,Especially did Thomas Doughty toil
10850,BOOK II,With soft and flowery tongue to win his way;
10851,BOOK II,"And Drake, whose rich imagination craved"
10852,BOOK II,"For something more than simple seaman's talk,"
10853,BOOK II,Was marvellously drawn to this new friend
10854,BOOK II,"Who with the scholar's mind, the courtier's gloss,"
10855,BOOK II,"The lawyer's wit, the adventurer's romance,"
10856,BOOK II,"Gold honey from the blooms of Euphues,"
10857,BOOK II,Rare flashes from the _Mermaid_ and sweet smiles
10858,BOOK II,"Copied from Sidney's self, even to the glance"
10859,BOOK II,"Of sudden, liquid sympathy, gave Drake"
10860,BOOK II,That banquet of the soul he ne'er had known
10861,BOOK II,"Nor needed till he knew, but needed now."
10862,BOOK II,So to the light of Doughty's answering eyes
10863,BOOK II,"He poured his inmost thoughts out, hour by hour;"
10864,BOOK II,And Doughty coiled up in the heart of Drake.
10865,BOOK II,
10866,BOOK II,Against such odds the tiny fleet set sail;
10867,BOOK II,"Yet gallantly and with heroic pride,"
10868,BOOK II,"Escutcheoned pavisades, emblazoned poops,"
10869,BOOK II,Banners and painted shields and close-fights hung
10870,BOOK II,With scarlet broideries. Every polished gun
10871,BOOK II,"Grinned through the jaws of some heraldic beast,"
10872,BOOK II,Gilded and carven and gleaming with all hues;
10873,BOOK II,While in the cabin of the _Golden Hynde_
10874,BOOK II,"Rich perfumes floated, given by the great Queen"
10875,BOOK II,Herself to Drake as Captain-General;
10876,BOOK II,"So that it seemed her soul was with the fleet,"
10877,BOOK II,"A presence to remind him, far away,"
10878,BOOK II,"Of how he talked with England, face to face,--"
10879,BOOK II,"No pirate he, but Gloriana's knight."
10880,BOOK II,"Silver and gold his table furniture,"
10881,BOOK II,"Engraved and richly chased, lavishly gleamed"
10882,BOOK II,"While, fanned by favouring airs, the ships advanced"
10883,BOOK II,With streaming flags and ensigns and sweet chords
10884,BOOK II,Of music struck by skilled musicians
10885,BOOK II,"Whom Drake brought with him, not from vanity,"
10886,BOOK II,But knowing how the pulse of men beats high
10887,BOOK II,To music; and the hearts of men like these
10888,BOOK II,"Were open to the high romance of earth,"
10889,BOOK II,And they that dwelt so near God's mystery
10890,BOOK II,Were proud of their own manhood. They went out
10891,BOOK II,"To danger, as to a sweetheart, far away."
10892,BOOK II,
10893,BOOK II,Light as the sea-birds dipping their white wings
10894,BOOK II,In foam before the gently heaving prows
10895,BOOK II,"Each heart beat, while the low soft lapping splash"
10896,BOOK II,Of water racing past them ripped and tore
10897,BOOK II,"Whiter and faster, and the bellying sails"
10898,BOOK II,"Filled out, and the chalk cliffs of England sank"
10899,BOOK II,Dwindling behind the broad grey plains of sea.
10900,BOOK II,Meekly content and tamely stay-at-home
10901,BOOK II,The sea-birds seemed that piped across the waves;
10902,BOOK II,"And Drake, be-mused, leaned smiling to his friend"
10903,BOOK II,"Doughty and said, ""Is it not strange to know"
10904,BOOK II,When we return yon speckled herring-gulls
10905,BOOK II,"Will still be wheeling, dipping, flashing there?"
10906,BOOK II,We shall not find a fairer land afar
10907,BOOK II,Than those thyme-scented hills we leave behind!
10908,BOOK II,"Soon the young lambs will bleat across the combes,"
10909,BOOK II,And breezes will bring puffs of hawthorn scent
10910,BOOK II,Down Devon lanes; over the purple moors
10911,BOOK II,Lavrocks will carol; and on the village greens
10912,BOOK II,"Around the May-pole, while the moon hangs low,"
10913,BOOK II,The boys and girls of England merrily swing
10914,BOOK II,In country footing through the morrice dance.
10915,BOOK II,"But many of us indeed shall not return."""
10916,BOOK II,"Then the other with a laugh, ""Nay, like the man"
10917,BOOK II,Who slept a hundred years we shall return
10918,BOOK II,And find our England strange: there are great storms
10919,BOOK II,Brewing; God only knows what we shall find--
10920,BOOK II,Perchance a Spanish king upon the throne!
10921,BOOK II,"What then?"" And Drake, ""I should put down my helm,"
10922,BOOK II,And out once more to the unknown golden West
10923,BOOK II,"To die, as I have lived, in a free land."""
10924,BOOK II,"So said he, while the white cliffs dwindled down,"
10925,BOOK II,"Faded, and vanished; but the prosperous wind"
10926,BOOK II,Carried the five ships onward over the swell
10927,BOOK II,"Of swinging, sweeping seas, till the sun sank,"
10928,BOOK II,And height o'er height the chaos of the skies
10929,BOOK II,Broke out into the miracle of the stars.
10930,BOOK II,"Frostily glittering, all the Milky Way"
10931,BOOK II,Lay bare like diamond-dust upon the robe
10932,BOOK II,Of some great king. Orion and the Plough
10933,BOOK II,"Glimmered through drifting gulfs of silver fleece,"
10934,BOOK II,"And, far away, in Italy, that night"
10935,BOOK II,"Young Galileo, looking upward, heard"
10936,BOOK II,The self-same whisper through that wild abyss
10937,BOOK II,Which now called Drake out to the unknown West.
10938,BOOK II,"But, after supper, Drake came up on deck"
10939,BOOK II,"With Doughty, and on the cold poop as they leaned"
10940,BOOK II,And gazed across the rolling gleam and gloom
10941,BOOK II,"Of mighty muffled seas, began to give"
10942,BOOK II,Voices to those lovely captives of the brain
10943,BOOK II,"Which, like princesses in some forest-tower,"
10944,BOOK II,"Still yearn for the delivering prince, the sweet"
10945,BOOK II,Far bugle-note that calls from answering minds.
10946,BOOK II,"He told him how, in those dark days which now"
10947,BOOK II,"Seemed like an evil dream, when the Princess"
10948,BOOK II,Elizabeth even trembled for her life
10949,BOOK II,"And read there, by the gleam of Smithfield fires,"
10950,BOOK II,Those cunning lessons of diplomacy
10951,BOOK II,"Which saved her then and now for England's sake,"
10952,BOOK II,He passed his youth. 'Twas when the power of Spain
10953,BOOK II,"Began to light the gloom, with that great glare"
10954,BOOK II,"Of martyrdom which, while the stars endure,"
10955,BOOK II,"Bears witness how men overcame the world,"
10956,BOOK II,"Trod the red flames beneath their feet like flowers,"
10957,BOOK II,"And cast aside the blackening robe of flesh,"
10958,BOOK II,"While with a crown of joy upon their heads,"
10959,BOOK II,"Even as into a palace, they passed through"
10960,BOOK II,The portals of the tomb to prove their love
10961,BOOK II,"Stronger at least than death: and, in those days"
10962,BOOK II,"A Puritan, with iron in his soul,"
10963,BOOK II,Having in earlier manhood occupied
10964,BOOK II,His business in great waters and beheld
10965,BOOK II,The bloody cowls of the Inquisition pass
10966,BOOK II,Before the midnight moon as he kept watch;
10967,BOOK II,And having then forsworn the steely sea
10968,BOOK II,To dwell at home in England with his love
10969,BOOK II,"At Tavistock in Devon, Edmund Drake"
10970,BOOK II,"Began, albeit too near the Abbey walls,"
10971,BOOK II,To speak too staunchly for his ancient faith;
10972,BOOK II,"And with his young child Francis, had to flee"
10973,BOOK II,By night at last for shelter to the coast.
10974,BOOK II,"Little the boy remembered of that flight,"
10975,BOOK II,"Pillioned behind his father, save the clang"
10976,BOOK II,And clatter of the hoofs on stony ground
10977,BOOK II,"Striking a sharp blue fire, while country tales"
10978,BOOK II,Of highwaymen kindled his reckless heart
10979,BOOK II,As the great steed went shouldering through the night.
10980,BOOK II,"There Francis, laying a little sunburnt hand"
10981,BOOK II,"On the big bolstered pistol at each side,"
10982,BOOK II,Dreamed with his wide grey eyes that he himself
10983,BOOK II,"Was riding out on some freebooting quest,"
10984,BOOK II,And felt himself heroic. League by league
10985,BOOK II,"The magic world rolled past him as they rode,"
10986,BOOK II,Leaving him nothing but a memory
10987,BOOK II,Of his own making. Vaguely he perceived
10988,BOOK II,A thousand meadows darkly streaming by
10989,BOOK II,"With clouds of perfume from their secret flowers,"
10990,BOOK II,A wayside cottage-window pointing out
10991,BOOK II,A golden finger o'er the purple road;
10992,BOOK II,A puff of garden roses or a waft
10993,BOOK II,"Of honeysuckle blown along a wood,"
10994,BOOK II,"While overhead that silver ship, the moon,"
10995,BOOK II,"Sailed slowly down the gulfs of glittering stars,"
10996,BOOK II,"Till, at the last, a buffet of fresh wind"
10997,BOOK II,Fierce with sharp savours of the stinging brine
10998,BOOK II,Against his dreaming face brought up a roar
10999,BOOK II,Of mystic welcome from the Channel seas.
11000,BOOK II,"And there Drake paused for a moment, as a song"
11001,BOOK II,Stole o'er the waters from the _Marygold_
11002,BOOK II,"Where some musician, striking luscious chords"
11003,BOOK II,"Of sweet-stringed music, freed his heart's desire"
11004,BOOK II,"In symbols of the moment, which the rest,"
11005,BOOK II,"And Doughty among them, scarce could understand."

11040,SONG,"Without belief, perchance, in Drake's own quest--"
11041,SONG,To Drake's own greater mind the eternal glory
11042,SONG,Seemed to transfigure his immediate hope.
11043,SONG,But Doughty only heard a sweet concourse
11044,SONG,Of sounds. They ceased. And Drake resumed his tale
11045,SONG,Of that strange flight in boyhood to the sea.
11046,SONG,"Next, the red-curtained inn and kindly hands"
11047,SONG,Of Protestant Plymouth held his memory long;
11048,SONG,Often in strange and distant dreams he saw
11049,SONG,That scene which now he tenderly portrayed
11050,SONG,"To Doughty's half-ironic smiling lips,"
11051,SONG,Half-sympathetic eyes; he saw again
11052,SONG,That small inn parlour with the homely fare
11053,SONG,"Set forth upon the table, saw the gang"
11054,SONG,"Of seamen dripping from the spray come in,"
11055,SONG,Like great new thoughts to some adventurous brain.
11056,SONG,Feeding his wide grey eyes he saw them stand
11057,SONG,Around the crimson fire and stamp their feet
11058,SONG,And scatter the salt drops from their big sea-boots;
11059,SONG,And all that night he lay awake and heard
11060,SONG,Mysterious thunderings of eternal tides
11061,SONG,Moaning out of a cold and houseless gloom
11062,SONG,"Beyond the world, that made it seem most sweet"
11063,SONG,To slumber in a little four-walled inn
11064,SONG,Immune from all that vastness. But at dawn
11065,SONG,"He woke, he leapt from bed, he ran and lookt,"
11066,SONG,"There, through the tiny high bright casement, there,--"
11067,SONG,"O, fairy vision of that small boy's face"
11068,SONG,Peeping at daybreak through the diamond pane!--
11069,SONG,"There first he saw the wondrous new-born world,"
11070,SONG,"And round its princely shoulders wildly flowing,"
11071,SONG,"Gemmed with a myriad clusters of the sun,"
11072,SONG,The magic azure mantle of the sea.
11073,SONG,
11074,SONG,"And, afterwards, there came those marvellous days"
11075,SONG,"When, on that battleship, a disused hulk"
11076,SONG,"Rotting to death in Chatham Reach, they found"
11077,SONG,Sanctuary and a dwelling-place at last.
11078,SONG,"For, Hawkins, that great ship-man, being their friend,"
11079,SONG,"A Protestant, with power on Plymouth town,"
11080,SONG,"Nigh half whereof he owned, made Edmund Drake"
11081,SONG,Reader of prayer to all the ships of war
11082,SONG,"That lay therein. So there the dreaming boy,"
11083,SONG,"Francis, grew up in that grim nursery"
11084,SONG,Among the ropes and masts and great dumb mouths
11085,SONG,Of idle ordnance. In that hulk he heard
11086,SONG,Many a time his father and his friends
11087,SONG,Over some wild-eyed troop of refugees
11088,SONG,"Thunder against the powers of Spain and Rome,"
11089,SONG,"""Idolaters who defiled the House of God"
11090,SONG,"In England;"" and all round them, as he heard,"
11091,SONG,"The clang and clatter of shipwright hammers rang,"
11092,SONG,"And hour by hour upon his vision rose,"
11093,SONG,"In solid oak reality, new ships,"
11094,SONG,"As Ilion rose to music, ships of war,"
11095,SONG,"The visible shapes and symbols of his dream,"
11096,SONG,"Unconscious yet, but growing as they grew,"
11097,SONG,"A wondrous incarnation, hour by hour,"
11098,SONG,"Till with their towering masts they stood complete,"
11099,SONG,"Embodied thoughts, in God's own dockyards built,"

11139,III,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11140,III,"--And on the May-wind droop and die,"
11141,III,"_Je vous en prie_, pity me;"
11142,III,"Your maidens choose their loves, but I--"
11143,III,"White as I came from the foam-white sea,"
11144,III,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel, mon bel,"
11145,III,"N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_--"
11146,III,
11147,III,
11148,IV,IV
11149,IV,
11150,IV,"The warm red-meal-winged butterfly,--"
11151,IV,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_--"
11152,IV,"Beat on her breast in the golden rye,--"
11153,IV,"_Je vous en prie_, pity me,--"
11154,IV,Stained her breast with a dusty dye
11155,IV,Red as the print of a kiss might be!
11156,IV,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel, mon bel,"
11157,IV,"N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11158,IV,
11159,IV,
11160,V,V
11161,V,
11162,V,"Is there no land, afar or nigh--"
11163,V,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_--"
11164,V,"But dreads the kiss o' the sea? Ah, why--"
11165,V,"_Je vous en prie_, pity me!--"
11166,V,Why will ye cling to the loves that die?
11167,V,Is earth all Adon to my plea?
11168,V,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel, mon bel,"
11169,V,"N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11170,V,
11171,V,
11172,VI,VI
11173,VI,
11174,VI,"Under the warm blue summer sky,--"
11175,VI,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11176,VI,"With outstretched arms and a low long sigh,--"
11177,VI,"_Je vous en prie_, pity me;--"
11178,VI,Over the Channel they saw her fly
11179,VI,"To the white-cliffed island that crowns the sea,"
11180,VI,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel, mon bel,"
11181,VI,"N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11182,VI,
11183,VI,
11184,VII,VII
11185,VII,
11186,VII,"England laughed as her queen drew nigh,--"
11187,VII,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11188,VII,"To the white-walled cottages gleaming high,"
11189,VII,"_Je vous en prie_, pity me!"
11190,VII,They drew her in with a joyful cry
11191,VII,"To the hearth where she sits with a babe on her knee,"
11192,VII,She has turned her moan to a lullaby.
11193,VII,"She is nursing a son to the kings of the sea,"
11194,VII,"_N'oserez vous, mon bel, mon bel,"
11195,VII,"N'oserez vous, mon bel ami?_"
11196,VII,
11197,VII,"Such memories, on the plunging _Golden Hynde_,"
11198,VII,"Under the stars, Drake drew before his friend,"
11199,VII,"Clomb for a moment to that peak of vision,"
11200,VII,"That purple peak of Darien, laughing aloud"
11201,VII,O'er those wild exploits down to Rio Grande
11202,VII,Which even now had made his fierce renown
11203,VII,Terrible to all lonely ships of Spain.
11204,VII,"E'en now, indeed, that poet of Portugal,"
11205,VII,"Lope de Vega, filled with this new fear"
11206,VII,Began to meditate his epic muse
11207,VII,"Till, like a cry of panic from his lips,"
11208,VII,"He shrilled the faint _Dragontea_ forth, wherein"
11209,VII,"Drake is that Dragon of the Apocalypse,"
11210,VII,The dread Antagonist of God and Man.
11211,VII,
11212,VII,Well had it been for Doughty on that night
11213,VII,"Had he not heard what followed; for, indeed,"
11214,VII,"When two minds clash, not often does the less"
11215,VII,"Conquer the greater; but, without one thought"
11216,VII,"Of evil, seeing they now were safe at sea,"
11217,VII,"Drake told him, only somewhat, yet too much,"
11218,VII,"Of that close conference with the Queen. And lo,"
11219,VII,The face of Doughty blanched with a slow thought
11220,VII,"That crept like a cold worm through all his brain,"
11221,VII,"""Thus much I knew, though secretly, before;"
11222,VII,But here he freely tells me as his friend;
11223,VII,"If I be false and he be what they say,"
11224,VII,"His knowledge of my knowledge will mean death."""
11225,VII,But Drake looked round at Doughty with a smile
11226,VII,"And said, ""Forgive me now: thou art not used"
11227,VII,"To these cold nights at sea! thou tremblest, friend;"
11228,VII,Let us go down and drink a cup of sack
11229,VII,"To our return!"" And at that kindly smile"
11230,VII,"Doughty shook off his nightmare mood, and thought,"
11231,VII,"""The yard-arm is for dogs, not gentlemen!"
11232,VII,"Even Drake would not misuse a man of birth!"""
11233,VII,And in the cabin of the _Golden Hynde_
11234,VII,Revolving subtle treacheries he sat.
11235,VII,There with the sugared phrases of the court
11236,VII,"Bartering beads for gold, he drew out all"
11237,VII,"The simple Devon seaman's inmost heart,"
11238,VII,And coiled up in the soul of Francis Drake.
11239,VII,There in the solemn night they interchanged
11240,VII,Lies for sweet confidences. From one wall
11241,VII,The picture of Drake's love looked down on him;
11242,VII,"And, like a bashful schoolboy's, that bronzed face"
11243,VII,Flushed as he blurted out with brightening eyes
11244,VII,"And quickening breath how he had seen her first,"
11245,VII,"Crowned on the village green, a Queen of May."
11246,VII,"Her name, too, was Elizabeth, he said,"
11247,VII,"As if it proved that she, too, was a queen,"
11248,VII,"Though crowned with milk-white Devon may alone,"
11249,VII,And queen but of one plot of meadow-sweet.
11250,VII,"As yet, he said, he had only kissed her hand,"
11251,VII,"Smiled in her eyes and--there Drake also flinched,"
11252,VII,"Thinking, ""I ne'er may see her face again."""
11253,VII,
11254,VII,And Doughty comforted his own dark heart
11255,VII,"Thinking, ""I need not fear so soft a soul"
11256,VII,"As this""; and yet, he wondered how the man,"
11257,VII,"Seeing his love so gripped him, none the less"
11258,VII,"Could leave her, thus to follow after dreams;"
11259,VII,"For faith to Doughty was an unknown word,"
11260,VII,And trustfulness the property of fools.
11261,VII,"At length they parted, each to his own couch,"
11262,VII,"Doughty with half a chuckle, Francis Drake"
11263,VII,With one old-fashioned richly grateful prayer
11264,VII,"Blessing all those he loved, as he had learnt"
11265,VII,Beside his mother's knee in Devon days.
11266,VII,
11267,VII,So all night long they sailed; but when a rift
11268,VII,Of orchard crimson broke the yellowing gloom
11269,VII,"And barred the closely clouded East with dawn,"
11270,VII,"Behold, a giant galleon, overhead,"
11271,VII,"Lifting its huge black shining sides on high,"
11272,VII,Loomed like some misty monster of the deep:
11273,VII,"And, sullenly rolling out great gorgeous folds,"
11274,VII,Over her rumbled like a thunder-cloud
11275,VII,"The heavy flag of Spain. The splendid poop,"
11276,VII,Mistily lustrous as a dragon's hoard
11277,VII,Seen in some magic cave-mouth o'er the sea
11278,VII,"Through shimmering April sunlight after rain,"
11279,VII,Blazed to the morning; and her port-holes grinned
11280,VII,With row on row of cannon. There at once
11281,VII,"One sharp shrill whistle sounded, and those five"
11282,VII,"Small ships, mere minnows clinging to the flanks"
11283,VII,"Of that Leviathan, unseen, unheard,"
11284,VII,"Undreamt of, grappled her. She seemed asleep,"
11285,VII,"Swinging at ease with great half-slackened sails,"
11286,VII,Majestically careless of the dawn.
11287,VII,"There in the very native seas of Spain,"
11288,VII,"There with the yeast and foam of her proud cliffs,"
11289,VII,"Her own blue coasts, in sight across the waves,"
11290,VII,Up her Titanic sides without a sound
11291,VII,The naked-footed British seamen swarmed
11292,VII,With knives between their teeth: then on her decks
11293,VII,"They dropped like panthers, and the softly fierce"
11294,VII,"Black-bearded watch, of Spaniards, all amazed,"
11295,VII,"Rubbing their eyes as if at a wild dream,"
11296,VII,"Upraised a sudden shout, _El Draque! El Draque!_"
11297,VII,"And flashed their weapons out, but all too late;"
11298,VII,"For, ere their sleeping comrades reached the deck,"
11299,VII,"The little watch, out-numbered and out-matched,"
11300,VII,"Lay bound, and o'er the hatches everywhere"
11301,VII,The points of naked cutlasses on guard
11302,VII,"Gleamed, and without a struggle those below"
11303,VII,"Gave up their arms, their poignards jewelled thick"
11304,VII,"With rubies, and their blades of Spanish steel."
11305,VII,
11306,VII,Then onward o'er the great grey gleaming sea
11307,VII,"They swept with their rich booty, night and day."
11308,VII,"Five other prizes, one for every ship,"
11309,VII,Out of the seas of Spain they suddenly caught
11310,VII,"And carried with them, laughing as they went--"
11311,VII,"""Now, now indeed the Rubicon is crossed;"
11312,VII,Now have we singed the eyelids and the beard
11313,VII,Of Spain; now have we roused the hornet's nest;
11314,VII,Now shall we sail against a world in arms;
11315,VII,Now we have nought between us and black death
11316,VII,"But our own hands, five ships, and three score guns."""
11317,VII,"So laughed they, plunging through the bay of storms,"
11318,VII,"Biscay, and past Gibraltar, not yet clothed"
11319,VII,"With British thunder, though, as one might dream,"
11320,VII,Gazing in dim prophetic grandeur out
11321,VII,"Across the waves while that small fleet went by,"
11322,VII,Or watching them with love's most wistful fear
11323,VII,As they plunged Southward to the lonely coasts
11324,VII,"Of Africa, till right in front up-soared,"
11325,VII,"Tremendous over ocean, Teneriffe,"
11326,VII,"Cloud-robed, but crowned with colours of the dawn."
11327,VII,
11328,VII,"Already those two traitors were at work,"
11329,VII,"Doughty and his false brother, among the crews,"
11330,VII,"Who knew not yet the vastness of their quest,"
11331,VII,Nor dreamed of aught beyond the accustomed world;
11332,VII,"For Drake had kept it secret, and the thoughts"
11333,VII,Of some that he had shipped before the mast
11334,VII,Set sail scarce farther than for Mogadore
11335,VII,"In West Morocco, or at the utmost mark"
11336,VII,"For northern Egypt, by the midnight woods"
11337,VII,And crystal palace roofed with chrysoprase
11338,VII,"Where Prester John had reigned five hundred years,"
11339,VII,"And Sydon, river of jewels, through the dark"
11340,VII,Enchanted gorges rolled its rays along!
11341,VII,Some thought of Rio Grande; but scarce to ten
11342,VII,The true intent was known; while to divert
11343,VII,The rest from care the skilled musicians played.
11344,VII,But those two Doughtys cunningly devised
11345,VII,By chance-dropt words to breathe a hint abroad;
11346,VII,And through the foc'sles crept a grisly fear
11347,VII,"Of things that lay beyond the bourne of earth,"
11348,VII,Till even those hardy seamen almost quailed;
11349,VII,"And now, at any whisper, they might turn"
11350,VII,With terror in their eyes. They might refuse
11351,VII,To sail into that fabled burning Void
11352,VII,Or brave that _primum mobile_ which drew
11353,VII,O'er-daring ships into the jaws of hell
11354,VII,"Beyond the Pole Antarticke, where the sea"
11355,VII,"Rushed down through fiery mountains, and no sail"
11356,VII,Could e'er return against its roaring stream.
11357,VII,
11358,VII,Now down the coast of Barbary they cruised
11359,VII,Till Christmas Eve embraced them in the heart
11360,VII,Of summer. In a bay of mellow calm
11361,VII,"They moored, and as the fragrant twilight brought"
11362,VII,"The stars, the sound of song and dance arose;"
11363,VII,"And down the shores in stealthy silence crept,"
11364,VII,"Out of the massy forest's emerald gloom,"
11365,VII,"The naked, dark-limbed children of the night,"
11366,VII,"Unseen, to gaze upon the floating glare"
11367,VII,"Of revelry; unheard, to hear that strange"
11368,VII,"New music of the gods, where o'er the soft"
11369,VII,Ripple and wash of the lanthorn-crimsoned tide
11370,VII,Will Harvest's voice above the chorus rang.
11371,VII,
11372,VII,
11373,SONG,SONG
11374,SONG,
11375,SONG,"_In Devonshire, now, the Christmas chime"
11376,SONG,Is carolling over the lea;
11377,SONG,And the sexton shovels away the snow
11378,SONG,"From the old church porch, maybe;"
11379,SONG,And the waifs with their lanthorns and noses a-glow
11380,SONG,Come round for their Christmas fee;
11381,SONG,"But, as in old England it's Christmas-time,"
11382,SONG,"Why, so is it here at sea,"
11383,SONG,"My lads,"
11384,SONG,"Why, so is it here at sea!_"
11385,SONG,
11386,SONG,"_When the ship comes home, from turret to poop"
11387,SONG,"Filled full with Spanish gold,"
11388,SONG,"There'll be many a country dance and joke,"
11389,SONG,And many a tale to be told;
11390,SONG,Every old woman shall have a red cloak
11391,SONG,To fend her against the cold;
11392,SONG,And every old man shall have a big round stoup
11393,SONG,"Of jolly good ale and old,"
11394,SONG,"My lads,"
11395,SONG,Jolly good ale and old!_
11396,SONG,
11397,SONG,But on the morrow came a prosperous wind
11398,SONG,"Whereof they took advantage, and shook out"
11399,SONG,"The flashing sails, and held their Christmas feast"
11400,SONG,Upon the swirling ridges of the sea:
11401,SONG,"And, sweeping Southward with full many a rouse"
11402,SONG,"And shout of laughter, at the fall of day,"
11403,SONG,"While the black prows drove, leapt, and plunged, and ploughed"
11404,SONG,"Through the broad dazzle of sunset-coloured tides,"
11405,SONG,"Outside the cabin of the _Golden Hynde_,"
11406,SONG,"Where Drake and his chief captains dined in state,"
11407,SONG,The skilled musicians made a great new song.
11408,SONG,
11409,SONG,
11410,SONG,SONG
11411,SONG,
11412,SONG,
11413,I,I
11414,I,
11415,I,"_Happy by the hearth sit the lasses and the lads, now,"
11416,I,"Roasting of their chestnuts, toasting of their toes!"
11417,I,"When the door is opened to a blithe new-comer,"
11418,I,Stamping like a ploughman to shuffle off the snows;
11419,I,Rosy flower-like faces through the soft red firelight
11420,I,"Float as if to greet us, far away at sea,"
11421,I,"Sigh as they remember, and turn the sigh to laughter,"
11422,I,Kiss beneath the mistletoe and wonder at their glee.
11423,I,"With their ""heigh ho, the holly!"
11424,I,"This life is most jolly!"""
11425,I,"Christmas-time is kissing-time,"
11426,I,Away with melancholy!_
11427,I,
11428,I,
11429,II,II
11430,II,
11431,II,"_Ah, the Yule of England, the happy Yule of England,"
11432,II,Yule of berried holly and the merry mistletoe;
11433,II,"The boar's head, the brown ale, the blue snapdragon,"
11434,II,Yule of groaning tables and the crimson log aglow!
11435,II,"Yule, the golden bugle to the scattered old companions,"
11436,II,"Ringing as with laughter, shining as through tears!"
11437,II,"Loved of little children, oh guard the holy Yuletide."
11438,II,"Guard it, men of England, for the child beyond the years."
11439,II,"With its ""heigh ho, the holly!"""
11440,II,Away with melancholy!
11441,II,"Christmas-time is kissing-time,"
11442,II,"""This life is most jolly!_"""
11443,II,
11444,II,Now to the Fortunate Islands of old time
11445,II,"They came, and found no glory as of old"
11446,II,"Encircling them, no red ineffable calm"
11447,II,Of sunset round crowned faces pale with bliss
11448,II,Like evening stars. Rugged and desolate
11449,II,"Those isles were when they neared them, though afar"
11450,II,They beautifully smouldered in the sun
11451,II,Like dusky purple jewels fringed and frayed
11452,II,With silver foam across that ancient sea.
11453,II,Of wonder. On the largest of the seven
11454,II,Drake landed Doughty with his musketeers
11455,II,To exercise their weapons and to seek
11456,II,Supplies among the matted uncouth huts
11457,II,"Which, as the ships drew round each ragged cliff,"
11458,II,Crept like remembered misery into sight;
11459,II,"Oh, like the strange dull waking from a dream"
11460,II,They blotted out the rosy courts and fair
11461,II,Imagined marble thresholds of the King
11462,II,Achilles and the heroes that were gone.
11463,II,But Drake cared nought for these things. Such a heart
11464,II,"He had, to make each utmost ancient bourne"
11465,II,Of man's imagination but a point
11466,II,Of new departure for his Golden Dream.
11467,II,"But Doughty with his men ashore, alone,"
11468,II,"Among the sparse wind-bitten groves of palm,"
11469,II,Kindled their fears of all they must endure
11470,II,"On that immense adventure. Nay, sometimes"
11471,II,He hinted of a voyage far beyond
11472,II,"All history and fable, far beyond"
11473,II,"Even that Void whence only two returned,--"
11474,II,"Columbus, with his men in mutiny;"
11475,II,"Magellan, who could only hound his crew"
11476,II,"Onward by threats of death, until they turned"
11477,II,"In horror from the Threat that lay before,"
11478,II,Preferring to be hanged as mutineers
11479,II,Rather than venture farther. Nor indeed
11480,II,Did even Magellan at the last return;
11481,II,"But, with all hell around him, in the clutch"
11482,II,Of devils died upon some savage isle
11483,II,By poisonous black enchantment. Not in vain
11484,II,Were Doughty's words on that volcanic shore
11485,II,"Among the stunted dark acacia trees,"
11486,II,"Whose heads, all bent one way by the trade-wind,"
11487,II,"Pointed North-east by North, South-west by West"
11488,II,Ambiguous sibyls that with wizened arms
11489,II,"Mysteriously declared a twofold path,"
11490,II,"Homeward or onward. But aboard the ships,"
11491,II,"Among the hardier seamen, old Tom Moone,"
11492,II,"With one or two stout comrades, overbore"
11493,II,All doubts and questionings with blither tales
11494,II,Of how they sailed to Darien and heard
11495,II,Nightingales in November all night long
11496,II,As down a coast like Paradise they cruised
11497,II,"Through seas of lasting summer, Eden isles,"
11498,II,"Where birds like rainbows, butterflies like gems,"
11499,II,And flowers like coloured fires o'er fairy creeks
11500,II,Floated and flashed beneath the shadowy palms;
11501,II,While ever and anon a bark canoe
11502,II,With naked Indian maidens flower-festooned
11503,II,"Put out from shadowy coves, laden with fruit"
11504,II,Ambrosial o'er the silken shimmering sea.
11505,II,And once a troop of nut-brown maidens came--
11506,II,"So said Tom Moone, a twinkle in his eye--"
11507,II,Swimming to meet them through the warm blue waves
11508,II,"And wantoned through the water, like those nymphs"
11509,II,Which one green April at the Mermaid Inn
11510,II,"Should hear Kit Marlowe mightily portray,"
11511,II,"Among his boon companions, in a song"
11512,II,Of Love that swam the sparkling Hellespont
11513,II,"Upheld by nymphs, not lovelier than these,--"
11514,II,Though whiter yet not lovelier than these--
11515,II,"For those like flowers, but these like rounded fruit"
11516,II,Rosily ripening through the clear tides tossed
11517,II,From nut-brown breast and arm all round the ship
11518,II,The thousand-coloured spray. Shapely of limb
11519,II,They were; but as they laid their small brown hands
11520,II,"Upon the ropes we cast them, Captain Drake"
11521,II,Suddenly thundered at them and bade them pack
11522,II,For a troop of naughty wenches! At that tale
11523,II,A tempest of fierce laughter rolled around
11524,II,"The foc'sle; but one boy from London town,"
11525,II,"A pale-faced prentice, run-away to sea,"
11526,II,"Asking why Drake had bidden them pack so soon,"
11527,II,"Tom Moone turned to him with his deep-sea growl,"
11528,II,"""Because our Captain is no pink-eyed boy"
11529,II,"Nor soft-limbed Spaniard, but a staunch-souled Man,"
11530,II,Full-blooded; nerved like iron; with a girl
11531,II,He loves at home in Devon; and a mind
11532,II,"For ever bent upon some mighty goal,"
11533,II,I know not what--but 'tis enough for me
11534,II,"To know my Captain knows."" And then he told"
11535,II,How sometimes o'er the gorgeous forest gloom
11536,II,"Some marble city, rich, mysterious, white,"
11537,II,"An ancient treasure-house of Aztec kings,"
11538,II,Or palace of forgotten Incas gleamed;
11539,II,"And in their dim rich lofty cellars gold,"
11540,II,"Beyond all wildest dreams, great bars of gold,"
11541,II,"Like pillars, tossed in mighty chaos, gold"
11542,II,"And precious stones, agate and emerald,"
11543,II,"Diamond, sapphire, ruby, and sardonyx."
11544,II,"So said he, as they waited the return"
11545,II,"Of Doughty, resting in the foc'sle gloom,"
11546,II,Or idly couched about the sun-swept decks
11547,II,"On sails or coils of rope, while overhead"
11548,II,"Some boy would climb the rigging and look out,"
11549,II,Arching his hand to see if Doughty came.
11550,II,"But when he came, he came with a strange face"
11551,II,Of feigned despair; and with a stammering tongue
11552,II,He vowed he could not find those poor supplies
11553,II,Which Drake himself in other days had found
11554,II,"Upon that self-same island. But, perchance,"
11555,II,"This was a barren year, he said. And Drake"
11556,II,"Looked at him, suddenly, and at the musketeers."
11557,II,Their eyes were strained; their faces wore a cloud.
11558,II,"That night he said no more; but on the morn,"
11559,II,"Mistrusting nothing, Drake with subtle sense"
11560,II,"Of weather-wisdom, through that little fleet"
11561,II,Distributed his crews anew. And all
11562,II,The prisoners and the prizes at those isles
11563,II,"They left behind them, taking what they would"
11564,II,"From out their carven cabins,--glimmering silks,"
11565,II,"Chiselled Toledo blades, and broad doubloons."
11566,II,"And lo, as they weighed anchor, far away"
11567,II,Behind them on the blue horizon line
11568,II,It seemed a city of towering masts arose;
11569,II,And from the crow's nest of the _Golden Hynde_
11570,II,"A seaman cried, ""By God; the hunt is up!"""
11571,II,And like a tide of triumph through their veins
11572,II,The red rejoicing blood began to race
11573,II,"As there they saw the avenging ships of Spain,"
11574,II,"Eight mighty galleons, nosing out their trail."
11575,II,"And Drake growled, ""Oh, my lads of Bideford,"
11576,II,It cuts my heart to show the hounds our heels;
11577,II,But we must not emperil our great quest!
11578,II,Such fights as that must wait--as our reward
11579,II,When we return. Yet I will not put on
11580,II,"One stitch of sail. So, lest they are not too slow"
11581,II,"To catch us, clear the decks. God, I would like"
11582,II,"To fight them!"" So the little fleet advanced"
11583,II,With decks all cleared and shotted guns and men
11584,II,"Bare-armed beside them, hungering to be caught,"
11585,II,And quite distracted from their former doubts;
11586,II,"For danger, in that kind, they never feared."
11587,II,But soon the heavy Spaniards dropped behind;
11588,II,And not in vain had Thomas Doughty sown
11589,II,The seeds of doubt; for many a brow grew black
11590,II,With sullen-seeming care that erst was gay.
11591,II,"But happily and in good time there came,"
11592,II,"Not from behind them now, but right in front,"
11593,II,"On the first sun-down of their quest renewed,"
11594,II,"Just as the sea grew dark around their ships,"
11595,II,A chance that loosed heart-gnawing doubt in deeds.
11596,II,For through a mighty zone of golden haze
11597,II,Blotting the purple of the gathering night
11598,II,A galleon like a floating mountain moved
11599,II,"To meet them, clad with sunset and with dreams."
11600,II,Her masts and spars immense in jewelled mist
11601,II,"Shimmered: her rigging, like an emerald web"
11602,II,"Of golden spiders, tangled half the stars!"
11603,II,"Embodied sunset, dragging the soft sky"
11604,II,"O'er dazzled ocean, through the night she drew"
11605,II,Out of the unknown lands; and round a prow
11606,II,That jutted like a moving promontory
11607,II,"Over a cloven wilderness of foam,"
11608,II,Upon a lofty blazoned scroll her name
11609,II,_San Salvador_ challenged obsequious isles
11610,II,Where'er she rode; who kneeling like dark slaves
11611,II,Before some great Sultàn must lavish forth
11612,II,"From golden cornucopias, East and West,"
11613,II,"Red streams of rubies, cataracts of pearl."
11614,II,"But, at a signal from their admiral, all"
11615,II,Those five small ships lay silent in the gloom
11616,II,"Which, just as if some god were on their side,"
11617,II,"Covered them in the dark troughs of the waves,"
11618,II,"Letting her pass to leeward. On she came,"
11619,II,"Blazing with lights, a City of the Sea,"
11620,II,"Belted with crowding towers and clouds of sail,"
11621,II,And round her bows a long-drawn thunder rolled
11622,II,Splendid with foam; but ere she passed them by
11623,II,"Drake gave the word, and with one crimson flash"
11624,II,Two hundred yards of black and hidden sea
11625,II,Leaped into sight between them as the roar
11626,II,Of twenty British cannon shattered the night.
11627,II,"Then after her they drove, like black sea-wolves"
11628,II,"Behind some royal high-branched stag of ten,"
11629,II,"Hanging upon those bleeding foam-flecked flanks,"
11630,II,"Leaping, snarling, worrying, as they went"
11631,II,In full flight down the wind; for those light ships
11632,II,"Much speedier than their huge antagonist,"
11633,II,"Keeping to windward, worked their will with her."
11634,II,In vain she burnt wild lights and strove to scan
11635,II,The darkening deep. Her musketeers in vain
11636,II,Provoked the crackling night with random fires:
11637,II,In vain her broadside bellowings burst at large
11638,II,As if the Gates of Erebus unrolled.
11639,II,For ever and anon the deep-sea gloom
11640,II,"From some new quarter, like a dragon's mouth"
11641,II,Opened and belched forth crimson flames and tore
11642,II,Her sides as if with iron claws unseen;
11643,II,"Till, all at once, rough voices close at hand"
11644,II,"Out of the darkness thundered, ""Grapple her!"""
11645,II,"And, falling on their knees, the Spaniards knew"
11646,II,The Dragon of that red Apocalypse.
11647,II,"There with one awful cry, _El Draque! El Draque_!"
11648,II,They cast their weapons from them; for the moon
11649,II,"Rose, eastward, and, against her rising, black"
11650,II,"Over the bloody bulwarks, Francis Drake,"
11651,II,"Grasping the great hilt of his naked sword,"
11652,II,Towered for a moment to their startled eyes
11653,II,Through all the zenith like the King of Hell.
11654,II,"Then he leaped down upon their shining decks,"
11655,II,And after him swarmed and towered and leapt in haste
11656,II,"A brawny band of three score Englishmen,"
11657,II,Gigantic as they loomed against the sky
11658,II,"And risen, it seemed, by miracle from the sea."
11659,II,So small were those five ships below the walls
11660,II,Of that huge floating mountain. Royally
11661,II,"Drake, from the swart commander's trembling hands"
11662,II,"Took the surrendered sword, and bade his men"
11663,II,"Gather the fallen weapons on an heap,"
11664,II,"And placed a guard about them, while the moon"
11665,II,Silvering the rolling seas for many a mile
11666,II,"Glanced on the huddled Spaniards' rich attire,"
11667,II,As like one picture of despair they grouped
11668,II,"Under the splintered main-mast's creaking shrouds,"
11669,II,And the great swinging shadows of the sails
11670,II,Mysteriously swept the gleaming decks;
11671,II,Where many a butt of useless cannon gloomed
11672,II,"Along the accoutred bulwarks or upturned,"
11673,II,"As the ship wallowed in the heaving deep,"
11674,II,Dumb mouths of empty menace to the stars.
11675,II,
11676,II,"Then Drake appointed Doughty, with a guard,"
11677,II,To sail the prize on to the next dim isle
11678,II,"Where they might leave her, taking aught they would"
11679,II,From out her carven cabins and rich holds.
11680,II,"And Doughty's heart leaped in him as he thought,"
11681,II,"""I have my chance at last""; but Drake, who still"
11682,II,"Trusted the man, made surety doubly sure,"
11683,II,And in his wary weather-wisdom sent
11684,II,"--Even as a breathing type of friendship, sent--"
11685,II,"His brother, Thomas Drake, aboard the prize;"
11686,II,"But set his brother, his own flesh and blood,"
11687,II,"Beneath the man, as if to say, ""I give"
11688,II,"My loyal friend dominion over me."""
11689,II,"So courteously he dealt with him; but he,"
11690,II,"Seeing his chance once more slipping away,"
11691,II,"Raged inwardly and, from his own false heart"
11692,II,"Imputing his own evil, he contrived"
11693,II,A cunning charge that night; and when they came
11694,II,"Next day, at noon, upon the destined isle,"
11695,II,"He suddenly spat the secret venom forth,"
11696,II,With such fierce wrath in his defeated soul
11697,II,That he himself almost believed the charge.
11698,II,For when Drake stepped on the _San Salvador_
11699,II,"To order all things duly about the prize,"
11700,II,"What booty they must keep and what let go,"
11701,II,Doughty received him with a blustering voice
11702,II,"Of red mock-righteous wrath, ""Is this the way"
11703,II,"Englishmen play the pirate, Francis Drake?"
11704,II,While thou wast dreaming of thy hero's crown--
11705,II,"God save the mark!--thy brother, nay, thy spy,"
11706,II,"Must play the common pilferer, must convert"
11707,II,"The cargo to his uses, rob us all"
11708,II,Of what we risked our necks to win: he wears
11709,II,The ransom of an emperor round his throat
11710,II,That might enrich us all. Who saw him wear
11711,II,"That chain of rubies ere last night?"""
11712,II,"And Drake,"
11713,II,"""Answer him, brother;"" and his brother smiled"
11714,II,"And answered, ""Nay, I never wore this chain"
11715,II,"Before last night; but Doughty knows, indeed,"
11716,II,For he was with me--and none else was there
11717,II,"But Doughty--'tis my word against his word,"
11718,II,That close on midnight we were summoned down
11719,II,To an English seaman who lay dying below
11720,II,"Unknown to any of us, a prisoner"
11721,II,"In chains, that had been captured none knew where,"
11722,II,"For all his mind was far from Darien,"
11723,II,And wandering evermore through Devon lanes
11724,II,At home; whom we released; and from his waist
11725,II,"He took this hidden chain and gave it me,"
11726,II,Begging me that if ever I returned
11727,II,To Bideford in Devon I would go
11728,II,With whatsoever wealth it might produce
11729,II,"To his old mother who, with wrinkled hands"
11730,II,"In some small white-washed cottage o'er the sea,"
11731,II,"Where wall-flowers bloom in April, even now"
11732,II,Is turning pages of the well-worn Book
11733,II,"And praying for her son's return, nor knows"
11734,II,That he lies cold upon the heaving main.
11735,II,But this he asked; and this in all good faith
11736,II,"I swore to do; and even now he died,"
11737,II,And hurrying hither from his side I clasped
11738,II,"His chain of rubies round my neck awhile,"
11739,II,In full sight of the sun. I have no more
11740,II,"To say."" Then up spoke Hatton's trumpeter:"
11741,II,"""But I have more to say. Last night I saw"
11742,II,"Doughty, but not in full sight of the sun,"
11743,II,"Nor once, nor twice, but three times at the least,"
11744,II,"Carrying chains of gold, clusters of gems,"
11745,II,And whatsoever wealth he could convey
11746,II,"Into his cabin and smuggle in smallest space."""
11747,II,"""Nay,"" Doughty stammered, mixing sneer and lie,"
11748,II,Yet bolstering up his courage with the thought
11749,II,That being what courtiers called a gentleman
11750,II,"He ranked above the rude sea-discipline,"
11751,II,"""Nay, they were free gifts from the Spanish crew"
11752,II,"Because I treated them with courtesy."""
11753,II,"Then bluff Will Harvest, ""That perchance were true,"
11754,II,For he hath been close closeted for hours
11755,II,"With their chief officers, drinking their health"
11756,II,"In our own war-bought wine, while down below"
11757,II,"Their captured English seaman groaned his last."""
11758,II,"Then Drake, whose utter silence, with a sense"
11759,II,"Of infinite power and justice, ruled their hearts,"
11760,II,Suddenly thundered--and the traitor blanched
11761,II,"And quailed before him. ""This my flesh and blood"
11762,II,I placed beneath thee as my dearer self!
11763,II,"But thou, in trampling on him, shalt not say"
11764,II,"I charged thy brother. Nay, thou chargest me!"
11765,II,Against me only hast thou stirred this strife;
11766,II,"And now, by God, shalt thou learn, once for all,"
11767,II,"That I, thy captain for this voyage, hold"
11768,II,The supreme power of judgment in my hands.
11769,II,Get thee aboard my flagship! When I come
11770,II,"I shall have more to say to thee; but thou,"
11771,II,"My brother, take this galleon in thy charge;"
11772,II,"For, as I see, she holdeth all the stores"
11773,II,Which Doughty failed to find. She shall return
11774,II,With us to that New World from which she came.
11775,II,But now let these our prisoners all embark
11776,II,In yonder pinnace; let them all go free.
11777,II,I care not to be cumbered on my way
11778,II,Through dead Magellan's unattempted dream
11779,II,With chains and prisoners. In that Golden World
11780,II,"Which means much more to me than I can speak,"
11781,II,"Much more, much more than I can speak or breathe,"
11782,II,"Being, behind whatever name it bears--"
11783,II,"Earthly Paradise, Island of the Saints,"
11784,II,"Cathay, or Zipangu, or Hy Brasil--"
11785,II,"The eternal symbol of my soul's desire,"
11786,II,"A sacred country shining on the sea,"
11787,II,"That Vision without which, the wise king said,"
11788,II,"A people perishes; in that place of hope,"
11789,II,"That Tirn'an Og, that land of lasting youth,"
11790,II,Where whosoever sails with me shall drink
11791,II,Fountains of immortality and dwell
11792,II,"Beyond the fear of death for evermore,"
11793,II,There shall we see the dust of battle dance
11794,II,Everywhere in the sunbeam of God's peace!
11795,II,"Oh, in the new Atlantis of my soul"
11796,II,There are no captives: there the wind blows free;
11797,II,"And, as in sleep, I have heard the marching song"
11798,II,"Of mighty peoples rising in the West,"
11799,II,Wonderful cities that shall set their foot
11800,II,Upon the throat of all old tyrannies;
11801,II,"And on the West wind I have heard a cry,"
11802,II,The shoreless cry of the prophetic sea
11803,II,Heralding through that golden wilderness
11804,II,"The Soul whose path our task is to make straight,"
11805,II,"Freedom, the last great Saviour of mankind."
11806,II,"I know not what I know: these are wild words,"
11807,II,"Which, as the sun draws out earth's morning mists"
11808,II,"Over dim fields where careless cattle sleep,"
11809,II,"Some visionary Light, unknown, afar,"
11810,II,Draws from my darkling soul. Why should we drag
11811,II,"Thither this Old-World weight of utter gloom,"
11812,II,Or with the ballast of these heavy hearts
11813,II,Make sail in sorrow for Pacific Seas?
11814,II,Let us leave chains and prisoners to Spain;
11815,II,"But set these free to make their own way home!"""
11816,II,"So said he, groping blindly towards the truth,"
11817,II,And heavy with the treason of his friend.
11818,II,"His face was like a king's face as he spake,"
11819,II,For sorrows that strike deep reveal the deep;
11820,II,And through the gateways of a raggèd wound
11821,II,Sometimes a god will drive his chariot wheels
11822,II,From some deep heaven within the hearts of men.
11823,II,"Nevertheless, the immediate seamen there"
11824,II,Knowing how great a ransom they might ask
11825,II,"For some among their prisoners, men of wealth"
11826,II,"And high degree, scarce liked to free them thus;"
11827,II,And only saw in Drake's conflicting moods
11828,II,"The moment's whim. ""For little will he care,"""
11829,II,"They muttered, ""when we reach those fabled shores,"
11830,II,"Whether his cannon break their golden peace."""
11831,II,Yet to his face they murmured not at all;
11832,II,Because his eyes compelled them like a law.
11833,II,So there they freed the prisoners and set sail
11834,II,Across the earth-shaking shoulders of the broad
11835,II,"Atlantic, and the great grey slumbrous waves"
11836,II,Triumphantly swelled up to meet the keels.
11837,II,
11838,II,
11839,BOOK III,BOOK III
11840,BOOK III,
11841,BOOK III,Now in the cabin of the _Golden Hynde_
11842,BOOK III,"At dusk, Drake sent for Doughty. From one wall"
11843,BOOK III,The picture of his love looked down on him;
11844,BOOK III,"And on the table lay the magic chart,"
11845,BOOK III,"Drawn on a buffalo horn, all small peaked isles,"
11846,BOOK III,"Dwarf promontories, tiny twisted creeks,"
11847,BOOK III,"And fairy harbours under elfin hills,"
11848,BOOK III,"With marvellous inscriptions lined in red,--"
11849,BOOK III,"As _Here is Gold_, or _Many Rubies Here_,"
11850,BOOK III,"Or _Ware Witch-crafte_, or _Here is Cannibals_."
11851,BOOK III,For in his great simplicity the man
11852,BOOK III,"Delighted in it, with the adventurous heart"
11853,BOOK III,Of boyhood poring o'er some well-thumbed tale
11854,BOOK III,On blue Twelfth Night beside the crimson fire;
11855,BOOK III,"And o'er him, like a vision of a boy"
11856,BOOK III,"In his first knighthood when, upon some hill"
11857,BOOK III,"Washed by the silver fringes of the sea,"
11858,BOOK III,Amidst the purple heather he lies and reads
11859,BOOK III,"Of Arthur and Avilion, like a star"
11860,BOOK III,"His love's pure face looked down. There Doughty came,"
11861,BOOK III,"Half fearful, half defiant, with a crowd"
11862,BOOK III,"Of jostling half-excuses on his lips,"
11863,BOOK III,And one dark swarm of adders in his heart.
11864,BOOK III,For now what light of chivalry remained
11865,BOOK III,"In Doughty's mind was thickening with a plot,"
11866,BOOK III,Subtler and deadlier than the serpent's first
11867,BOOK III,Attempt on our first sire in Eden bower.
11868,BOOK III,"Drake, with a countenance open as the sun,"
11869,BOOK III,"Received him, saying: ""Forgive me, friend, for I"
11870,BOOK III,Was hasty with thee. I well nigh forgot
11871,BOOK III,Those large and liberal nights we two have passed
11872,BOOK III,"In this old cabin, telling all our dreams"
11873,BOOK III,"And hopes, in friendship, o'er and o'er again."
11874,BOOK III,"But Vicary, thy friend hath talked with me,"
11875,BOOK III,And now--I understand. Thou shalt no more
11876,BOOK III,Be vexed with a divided mastership.
11877,BOOK III,"Indeed, I trust thee, Doughty. Wilt thou not"
11878,BOOK III,Be friends with me? For now in ample proof
11879,BOOK III,Thou shalt take charge of this my _Golden Hynde_
11880,BOOK III,"In all things, save of seamanship, which rests"
11881,BOOK III,With the ship's master under my command.
11882,BOOK III,"But I myself will sail upon the prize."""
11883,BOOK III,"And with the word he gathered up the chart,"
11884,BOOK III,"Took down his lady's picture with a smile,"
11885,BOOK III,"Gripped Doughty's hand and left him, staring, sheer"
11886,BOOK III,Bewildered with that magnanimity
11887,BOOK III,"Of faith, throughout all shadows, in some light"
11888,BOOK III,Unseen behind the shadows. Thus did Drake
11889,BOOK III,Give up his own fair cabin which he loved;
11890,BOOK III,"Being, it seemed, a little travelling home,"
11891,BOOK III,"Fragrant with memories,--gave it, as he thought,"
11892,BOOK III,In recompense to one whom he had wronged.
11893,BOOK III,For even as his mind must ever yearn
11894,BOOK III,"To shores beyond the sunset, even so"
11895,BOOK III,"He yearned through all dark shadows to his friend,"
11896,BOOK III,And with his greater nature striving still
11897,BOOK III,"To comprehend the lesser, as the sky"
11898,BOOK III,"Embraces our low earth, he would adduce"
11899,BOOK III,"Justifications, thus: ""These men of law"
11900,BOOK III,"Are trained to plead for any and every cause,"
11901,BOOK III,"To feign an indignation, or to prove"
11902,BOOK III,The worse is better and that black is white!
11903,BOOK III,Small wonder that their passion goes astray:
11904,BOOK III,"There is one prayer, one prayer for all of us--"
11905,BOOK III,"_Enter not into judgment with Thy servant!_"""
11906,BOOK III,
11907,BOOK III,Yet as his boat pulled tow'rd the Spanish prize
11908,BOOK III,"Leaving the _Golden Hynde_, far off he heard"
11909,BOOK III,"A voice that chilled him, as the voice of Fate"
11910,BOOK III,Crying like some old Bellman through the world.

11933,SONG,"And Doughty, though Drake's deed of kindness flashed"
11934,SONG,"A moment's kind contrition through his heart,"
11935,SONG,"Immediately, with all his lawyer's wit"
11936,SONG,"True to the cause that hired him, laughed it by,"
11937,SONG,And straight began to weave the treacherous web
11938,SONG,Of soft intrigue wherein he meant to snare
11939,SONG,"The passions of his comrades. Night and day,"
11940,SONG,"As that small fleet drove onward o'er the deep,"
11941,SONG,Cleaving the sunset with their bright black prows
11942,SONG,"Or hunted by the red pursuing Dawn,"
11943,SONG,He stirred between the high-born gentlemen
11944,SONG,"(Whose white and jewelled hands, gallant in fight,"
11945,SONG,"And hearts remembering Crécy and Poictiers,"
11946,SONG,"Were of scant use in common seamanship),"
11947,SONG,Between these and the men whose rough tarred arms
11948,SONG,Were good at equal need in storm or war
11949,SONG,"Yet took a poorer portion of the prize,"
11950,SONG,He stirred a subtle jealousy and fanned
11951,SONG,A fire that swiftly grew almost to hate.
11952,SONG,For when the seamen must take precedence
11953,SONG,"Of loiterers on the deck--through half a word,"
11954,SONG,"Small, with intense device, like some fierce lens,"
11955,SONG,He magnified their rude and blustering mode;
11956,SONG,"Or urged some scented fop, whose idle brain"
11957,SONG,"Busied itself with momentary whims,"
11958,SONG,"To bid the master alter here a sail,"
11959,SONG,"Or there a rope; and, if the man refused,"
11960,SONG,"Doughty, at night, across the wine-cups, raved"
11961,SONG,Against the rising insolence of the mob;
11962,SONG,"And hinted Drake himself was half to blame,"
11963,SONG,"In words that seemed to say, ""I am his friend,"
11964,SONG,"Or I should bid you think him all to blame."""
11965,SONG,"So fierce indeed the strife became that once,"
11966,SONG,"While Chester, Doughty's catspaw, played with fire,"
11967,SONG,"The grim ship-master growled between his teeth,"
11968,SONG,"""Remember, sir, remember, ere too late,"
11969,SONG,"Magellan's mutinous vice-admiral's end."""
11970,SONG,"And Doughty heard, and with a boisterous laugh"
11971,SONG,"Slapped the old sea-dog on the back and said,"
11972,SONG,"""The gallows are for dogs, not gentlemen!"""
11973,SONG,"Meanwhile his brother, sly John Doughty, sought"
11974,SONG,To fan the seamen's fear of the unknown world
11975,SONG,"With whispers and conjectures; and, at night,"
11976,SONG,He brought old books of Greek and Hebrew down
11977,SONG,"Into the foc'sle, claiming by their aid"
11978,SONG,"A knowledge of Black Art, and power to tell"
11979,SONG,"The future, which he dreadfully displayed"
11980,SONG,"There in the flickering light of the oily lamp,"
11981,SONG,Bending above their huge and swarthy palms
11982,SONG,And tracing them to many a grisly doom.
11983,SONG,So many a night and day westward they plunged.
11984,SONG,"The half-moon ripened to its mellow round,"
11985,SONG,"Dwindled again and ripened yet again,"
11986,SONG,And there was nought around them but the grey
11987,SONG,Ruin and roar of huge Atlantic seas.
11988,SONG,And only like a memory of the world
11989,SONG,"They left behind them rose the same great sun,"
11990,SONG,"And daily rolled his chariot through their sky,"
11991,SONG,Whereof the skilled musicians made a song.
11992,SONG,
11993,SONG,
11994,SONG,SONG
11995,SONG,
11996,SONG,"The same sun is o'er us,"
11997,SONG,"The same Love shall find us,"
11998,SONG,"The same and none other,"
11999,SONG,Wherever we be;
12000,SONG,"With the same goal before us,"
12001,SONG,"The same home behind us,"
12002,SONG,"England, our mother,"
12003,SONG,Ringed round with the sea.
12004,SONG,
12005,SONG,When the breakers charged thundering
12006,SONG,In thousands all round us
12007,SONG,With a lightning of lances
12008,SONG,"Uphurtled on high,"
12009,SONG,When the stout ships were sundering
12010,SONG,"A rapture hath crowned us,"
12011,SONG,Like the wild light that dances
12012,SONG,On the crests that flash by.
12013,SONG,
12014,SONG,When the waters lay breathless
12015,SONG,Gazing at Hesper
12016,SONG,Guarding the golden
12017,SONG,"Fruit of the tree,"
12018,SONG,Heard we the deathless
12019,SONG,Wonderful whisper
12020,SONG,Wafting the olden
12021,SONG,Dream of the sea.
12022,SONG,
12023,SONG,No land in the ring of it
12024,SONG,"Now, all around us"
12025,SONG,Only the splendid
12026,SONG,Resurging unknown!
12027,SONG,How should we sing of it?--
12028,SONG,This that hath found us
12029,SONG,By the great sun attended
12030,SONG,"In splendour, alone."
12031,SONG,
12032,SONG,"Ah! the broad miles of it,"
12033,SONG,White with the onset
12034,SONG,Of waves without number
12035,SONG,Warring for glee.
12036,SONG,Ah! the soft smiles of it
12037,SONG,"Down to the sunset,"
12038,SONG,"Holy for slumber,"
12039,SONG,The peace of the sea.
12040,SONG,
12041,SONG,"The wave's heart, exalted,"
12042,SONG,"Leaps forward to meet us,"
12043,SONG,The sun on the sea-wave
12044,SONG,Lies white as the moon:
12045,SONG,The soft sapphire-vaulted
12046,SONG,"Deep heaven smiles to greet us,"
12047,SONG,Free sons of the free-wave
12048,SONG,All singing one tune.
12049,SONG,
12050,SONG,"_The same sun is o'er us,"
12051,SONG,"The same Love shall find us,"
12052,SONG,"The same and none other,"
12053,SONG,Wherever we be;
12054,SONG,"With the same goal before us,"
12055,SONG,"The same home behind us,"
12056,SONG,"England, our mother,"
12057,SONG,Queen of the sea._
12058,SONG,
12059,SONG,At last a faint-flushed April Dawn arose
12060,SONG,With milk-white arms up-binding golden clouds
12061,SONG,Of fragrant hair behind her lovely head;
12062,SONG,"And lo, before the bright black plunging prows"
12063,SONG,The whole sea suddenly shattered into shoals
12064,SONG,Of rolling porpoises. Everywhere they tore
12065,SONG,The glittering water. Like a moving crowd
12066,SONG,"Of black bright rocks washed smooth by foaming tides,"
12067,SONG,They thrilled the unconscious fancy of the crews
12068,SONG,"With subtle, wild, and living hints of land."
12069,SONG,"And soon Columbus' happy signals came,"
12070,SONG,The signs that saved him when his mutineers
12071,SONG,"Despaired at last and clamoured to return,--"
12072,SONG,"And there, with awe triumphant in their eyes,"
12073,SONG,"They saw, lazily tossing on the tide,"
12074,SONG,"A drift of seaweed, and a berried branch,"
12075,SONG,Which silenced them as if they had seen a Hand
12076,SONG,"Writing with fiery letters on the deep,"
12077,SONG,"Then a black cormorant, vulture of the sea,"
12078,SONG,"With neck outstretched and one long ominous _honk_,"
12079,SONG,Went hurtling past them to its unknown bourne.
12080,SONG,A mighty white-winged albatross came next;
12081,SONG,Then flight on flight of clamorous clanging gulls;
12082,SONG,"And last, a wild and sudden shout of ""Land!"""
12083,SONG,Echoed from crew to crew across the waves.
12084,SONG,"Then, dumb upon the rigging as they hung"
12085,SONG,"Staring at it, a menace chilled their blood."
12086,SONG,"For like _Il Gran Nemico_ of Dante, dark,"
12087,SONG,"Ay, coloured like a thunder-cloud, from North"
12088,SONG,"To South, in front, there slowly rose to sight"
12089,SONG,A country like a dragon fast asleep
12090,SONG,"Along the West, with wrinkled, purple wings"
12091,SONG,Ending in ragged forests o'er its spine;
12092,SONG,"And with great craggy claws out-thrust, that turned"
12093,SONG,(As the dire distances dissolved their veils)
12094,SONG,To promontories bounding a huge bay.
12095,SONG,There o'er the hushed and ever shallower tide
12096,SONG,"The staring ships drew nigh and thought, ""Is this"
12097,SONG,"The Dragon of our Golden Apple Tree,"
12098,SONG,The guardian of the fruit of our desire
12099,SONG,Which grows in gardens of the Hesperides
12100,SONG,Where those three sisters weave a white-armed dance
12101,SONG,"Around it everlastingly, and sing"
12102,SONG,Strange songs in a strange tongue that still convey
12103,SONG,"Warning to heedful souls?"" Nearer they drew,"
12104,SONG,"And now, indeed, from out a soft blue-grey"
12105,SONG,Mingling of colours on that coast's deep flank
12106,SONG,"There crept a garden of enchantment, height"
12107,SONG,"O'er height, a garden sloping from the hills,"
12108,SONG,Wooded as with Aladdin's trees that bore
12109,SONG,All-coloured clustering gems instead of fruit;
12110,SONG,"Now vaster as it grew upon their eyes,"
12111,SONG,And like some Roman amphitheatre
12112,SONG,"Cirque above mighty cirque all round the bay,"
12113,SONG,With jewels and flowers ablaze on women's breasts
12114,SONG,Innumerably confounded and confused;
12115,SONG,"While lovely faces flushed with lust of blood,"
12116,SONG,Rank above rank upon their tawny thrones
12117,SONG,"In soft barbaric splendour lapped, and lulled"
12118,SONG,"By the low thunderings of a thousand lions,"
12119,SONG,Luxuriously smiled as they bent down
12120,SONG,Over the scarlet-splashed and steaming sands
12121,SONG,To watch the white-limbed gladiators die.
12122,SONG,
12123,SONG,"Such fears and dreams for Francis Drake, at least,"
12124,SONG,Rose and dissolved in his nigh fevered brain
12125,SONG,As they drew near that equatorial shore;
12126,SONG,For rumours had been borne to him; and now
12127,SONG,He knew not whether to impute the wrong
12128,SONG,To his untrustful mind or to believe
12129,SONG,Doughty a traitorous liar; yet there seemed
12130,SONG,Proof and to spare. A thousand shadows rose
12131,SONG,To mock him with their veiled indicative hands.
12132,SONG,And each alone he laid and exorcised
12133,SONG,"But for each doubt he banished, one returned"
12134,SONG,From darker depths to mock him o'er again.
12135,SONG,
12136,SONG,"So, in that bay, the little fleet sank sail"
12137,SONG,And anchored; and the wild reality
12138,SONG,"Behind those dreams towered round them on the hills,"
12139,SONG,"Or so it seemed. And Drake bade lower a boat,"
12140,SONG,And went ashore with sixteen men to seek
12141,SONG,"Water; and, as they neared the embowered beach,"
12142,SONG,"Over the green translucent tide there came,"
12143,SONG,"A hundred yards from land, a drowsy sound"
12144,SONG,"Immeasurably repeated and prolonged,"
12145,SONG,As of innumerable elfin drums
12146,SONG,Dreamily mustering in the tropic bloom.
12147,SONG,"This from without they heard, across the waves;"
12148,SONG,But when they glided into a flowery creek
12149,SONG,Under the sharp black shadows of the trees--
12150,SONG,Jaca and Mango and Palm and red festoons
12151,SONG,Of garlanded Liana wreaths--it ebbed
12152,SONG,"Into the murmur of the mighty fronds,"
12153,SONG,Prodigious leaves whose veinings bore the fresh
12154,SONG,Impression of the finger-prints of God.
12155,SONG,"There humming-birds, like flakes of purple fire"
12156,SONG,"Upon some passing seraph's plumage, beat"
12157,SONG,And quivered in blinding blots of golden light
12158,SONG,Between the embattled cactus and cardoon;
12159,SONG,While one huge whisper of primeval awe
12160,SONG,Seemed to await the cool green eventide
12161,SONG,When God should walk His Garden as of old.
12162,SONG,
12163,SONG,Now as the boats were plying to and fro
12164,SONG,"Between the ships and that enchanted shore,"
12165,SONG,Drake bade his comrades tarry a little and went
12166,SONG,"Apart, alone, into the trackless woods."
12167,SONG,"Tormented with his thoughts, he saw all round"
12168,SONG,"Once more the battling image of his mind,"
12169,SONG,"Where there was nought of man, only the vast"
12170,SONG,"Unending silent struggle of Titan trees,"
12171,SONG,"Large internecine twistings of the world,"
12172,SONG,The hushed death-grapple and the still intense
12173,SONG,Locked anguish of Laocoons that gripped
12174,SONG,"Death by the throat for thrice three hundred years,"
12175,SONG,"Once, like a subtle mockery overhead,"
12176,SONG,"Some black-armed chattering ape swung swiftly by,"
12177,SONG,"But he strode onward, thinking--""Was it false,"
12178,SONG,False all that kind outreaching of the hands?
12179,SONG,"False? Was there nothing certain, nothing sure"
12180,SONG,In those divinest aisles and towers of Time
12181,SONG,Wherein we took sweet counsel? Is there nought
12182,SONG,Sure but the solid dust beneath our feet?
12183,SONG,"Must all those lovelier fabrics of the soul,"
12184,SONG,"Being so divinely bright and delicate,"
12185,SONG,Waver and shine no longer than some poor
12186,SONG,"Prismatic aery bubble? Ay, they burst,"
12187,SONG,And all their glory shrinks into one tear
12188,SONG,No bitterer than some idle love-lorn maid
12189,SONG,"Sheds for her dead canary. God, it hurts,"
12190,SONG,"This, this hurts most, to think how we must miss"
12191,SONG,"What might have been, for nothing but a breath,"
12192,SONG,"A babbling of the tongue, an argument,"
12193,SONG,Or such a poor contention as involves
12194,SONG,"The thrones and dominations of this earth,--"
12195,SONG,"How many of us, like seed on barren ground,"
12196,SONG,"Must miss the flower and harvest of their prayers,"
12197,SONG,The living light of friendship and the grasp
12198,SONG,Which for its very meaning once implied
12199,SONG,Eternities of utterance and the life
12200,SONG,"Immortal of two souls beyond the grave?"""
12201,SONG,
12202,SONG,"Now, wandering upward ever, he reached and clomb"
12203,SONG,"The slope side of a fern-fringed precipice,"
12204,SONG,"And, at the summit, found an opening glade,"
12205,SONG,"Whence, looking o'er the forest, he beheld"
12206,SONG,"The sea; and, in the land-locked bay below,"
12207,SONG,"Far, far below, his elfin-tiny ships,"
12208,SONG,All six at anchor on the crawling tide!
12209,SONG,"Then onward, upward, through the woods once more"
12210,SONG,He plunged with bursting heart and burning brow;
12211,SONG,"And, once again, like madness, the black shapes"
12212,SONG,"Of doubt swung through his brain and chattered and laughed,"
12213,SONG,Till he upstretched his arms in agony
12214,SONG,"And cursed the name of Doughty, cursed the day"
12215,SONG,"They met, cursed his false face and courtier smiles,"
12216,SONG,"""For oh,"" he cried, ""how easy a thing it were"
12217,SONG,For truth to wear the garb of truth! This proves
12218,SONG,"His treachery!"" And there, at once, his thoughts"
12219,SONG,"Tore him another way, as thus, ""And yet"
12220,SONG,"If he were false, is he not subtle enough"
12221,SONG,"To hide it? Why, this proves his innocence--"
12222,SONG,"This very courtly carelessness which I,"
12223,SONG,"Black-hearted evil-thinker as I am,"
12224,SONG,In my own clumsier spirit so misjudge!
12225,SONG,These children of the court are butterflies
12226,SONG,"Fluttering hither and thither, and I--poor fool--"
12227,SONG,"Would fix them to a stem and call them flowers,"
12228,SONG,"Nay, bid them grasp the ground like towering oaks"
12229,SONG,"And shadow all the zenith;"" and yet again"
12230,SONG,The madness of distrustful friendship gleamed
12231,SONG,"From his fierce eyes, ""Oh villain, damnèd villain,"
12232,SONG,God's murrain on his heart! I know full well
12233,SONG,He hides what he can hide! He wears no fault
12234,SONG,Upon the gloss and frippery of his breast!
12235,SONG,"It is not that! It is the hidden things,"
12236,SONG,"Unseizable, the things I do not know,"
12237,SONG,"Ay, it is these, these, these and these alone"
12238,SONG,"That I mistrust."""
12239,SONG,"And, as he walked, the skies"
12240,SONG,"Grew full of threats, and now enormous clouds"
12241,SONG,"Rose mammoth-like above the ensanguined deep,"
12242,SONG,"Trampling the daylight out; and, with its death"
12243,SONG,"Dyed purple, rushed along as if they meant"
12244,SONG,To obliterate the world. He took no heed.
12245,SONG,Though that strange blackness brimmed the branching aisles
12246,SONG,"With horror, he strode on till in the gloom,"
12247,SONG,Just as his winding way came out once more
12248,SONG,"Over a precipice that o'erlooked the bay,"
12249,SONG,"There, as he went, not gazing down, but up,"
12250,SONG,"He saw what seemed a ponderous granite cliff,"
12251,SONG,A huge ribbed shell upon a lonely shore
12252,SONG,Left by forgotten mountains when they sank
12253,SONG,Back to earth's breast like billows on a sea.
12254,SONG,A tall and whispering crowd of tree-ferns waved
12255,SONG,Mysterious fringes round it. In their midst
12256,SONG,"He flung himself at its broad base, with one"
12257,SONG,"Sharp shivering cry of pain, ""Show me Thy ways,"
12258,SONG,"O God, teach me Thy paths! I am in the dark!"
12259,SONG,"Lighten my darkness!"""
12260,SONG,Almost as he spoke
12261,SONG,"There swept across the forest, far and wide,"
12262,SONG,"Gathering power and volume as it came,"
12263,SONG,A sound as of a rushing mighty wind;
12264,SONG,"And, overhead, like great black gouts of blood"
12265,SONG,Wrung from the awful forehead of the Night
12266,SONG,"The first drops fell and ceased. Then, suddenly,"
12267,SONG,"Out of the darkness, earth with all her seas,"
12268,SONG,Her little ships at anchor in the bay
12269,SONG,"(Five ebony ships upon a sheet of silver,"
12270,SONG,"Drake saw not that, indeed, Drake saw not that!),"
12271,SONG,"Her woods, her boughs, her leaves, her tiniest twigs."
12272,SONG,Leapt like a hunted stag through one immense
12273,SONG,Lightning of revelation into the murk
12274,SONG,Of Erebus: then heaven o'er rending heaven
12275,SONG,Shattered and crashed down ruin over the world.
12276,SONG,"But, in that deeper darkness, Francis Drake"
12277,SONG,"Stood upright now, and with blind outstretched arms"
12278,SONG,Groped at that strange forgotten cliff and shell
12279,SONG,Of mystery; for in that flash of light
12280,SONG,Æons had passed; and now the Thing in front
12281,SONG,Made his blood freeze with memories that lay
12282,SONG,"Behind his Memory. In the gloom he groped,"
12283,SONG,"And with dark hands that knew not what they knew,"
12284,SONG,"As one that shelters in the night, unknowing,"
12285,SONG,"Beneath a stranded shipwreck, with a cry"
12286,SONG,He touched the enormous rain-washed belted ribs
12287,SONG,And bones like battlements of some Mastodon
12288,SONG,Embedded there until the trump of doom.
12289,SONG,
12290,SONG,"After long years, long centuries, perchance,"
12291,SONG,Triumphantly some other pioneer
12292,SONG,Would stand where Drake now stood and read the tale
12293,SONG,Of ages where he only felt the cold
12294,SONG,Touch in the dark of some huge mystery;
12295,SONG,Yet Drake might still be nearer to the light
12296,SONG,"Who now was whispering from his great deep heart,"
12297,SONG,"""Show me Thy ways, O God, teach me Thy paths!"""
12298,SONG,"And there by some strange instinct, oh, he felt"
12299,SONG,"God's answer there, as if he grasped a hand"
12300,SONG,Across a gulf of twice ten thousand years;
12301,SONG,And he regained his lost magnificence
12302,SONG,Of faith in that great Harmony which resolves
12303,SONG,"Our discords, faith through all the ruthless laws"
12304,SONG,"Of nature in their lovely pitilessness,"
12305,SONG,"Faith in that Love which outwardly must wear,"
12306,SONG,"Through all the sorrows of eternal change,"
12307,SONG,The splendour of the indifference of God.
12308,SONG,All round him through the heavy purple gloom
12309,SONG,"Sloped the soft rush of silver-arrowed rain,"
12310,SONG,"Loosening the skies' hard anguish, as with tears."
12311,SONG,Once more he felt his unity with all
12312,SONG,"The vast composure of the universe,"
12313,SONG,And drank deep at the fountains of that peace
12314,SONG,Which comprehends the tumult of our days.
12315,SONG,But with that peace the power to act returned;
12316,SONG,"And, with his back against the Mastodon,"
12317,SONG,He stared through the great darkness tow'rds the sea.
12318,SONG,The rain ceased for a moment: only the slow
12319,SONG,Drip of the dim droop-feathered palms all round
12320,SONG,Deepened the hush.
12321,SONG,"Then, out of the gloom once more"
12322,SONG,"The whole earth leapt to sight with all her woods,"
12323,SONG,"Her boughs, her leaves, her tiniest twigs distinct"
12324,SONG,For one wild moment; but Drake only saw
12325,SONG,"The white flash of her seas and there, oh there"
12326,SONG,"That land-locked bay with those five elfin ships,"
12327,SONG,Five elfin ebony ships upon a sheet
12328,SONG,"Of wrinkled silver! Then, as the thunder followed,"
12329,SONG,One thought burst through his brain--
12330,SONG,_One ship was gone!_
12331,SONG,"Over the grim precipitous edge he hung,"
12332,SONG,An eagle waiting for the lightning now
12333,SONG,To swoop upon his prey. One iron hand
12334,SONG,Gripped a rough tree-root like a bunch of snakes;
12335,SONG,"And, as the rain rushed round him, far away"
12336,SONG,"He saw to northward yet another flash,"
12337,SONG,A scribble of God's finger in the sky
12338,SONG,Over a waste of white stampeding waves.
12339,SONG,"His eye flashed like a falchion as he saw it,"
12340,SONG,And from his lips there burst the sea-king's laugh;
12341,SONG,"For there, with a fierce joy he knew, he knew"
12342,SONG,"Doughty, at last--an open mutineer!"
12343,SONG,"An open foe to fight! Ay, there she went,--"
12344,SONG,"His _Golden Hynde_, his little _Golden Hynde_"
12345,SONG,A wild deserter scudding to the North.
12346,SONG,"And, almost ere the lightning, Drake had gone"
12347,SONG,"Crashing down the face of the precipice,"
12348,SONG,"By a narrow water-gully, and through the huge"
12349,SONG,Forest he tore the straight and perilous way
12350,SONG,"Down to the shore; while, three miles to the North,"
12351,SONG,Upon the wet poop of the _Golden Hynde_
12352,SONG,Doughty stood smiling. Scarce would he have smiled
12353,SONG,Knowing that Drake had seen him from that tower
12354,SONG,"Amidst the thunders; but, indeed, he thought"
12355,SONG,He had escaped unseen amidst the storm.
12356,SONG,"Many a day he had worked upon the crew,"
12357,SONG,Fanning their fears and doubts until he won
12358,SONG,The more part to his side. And when they reached
12359,SONG,"That coast, he showed them how Drake meant to sail"
12360,SONG,"Southward, into that unknown Void; but he"
12361,SONG,Would have them suddenly slip by stealth away
12362,SONG,"Northward to Darien, showing them what a life"
12363,SONG,"Of roystering glory waited for them there,"
12364,SONG,"If, laying aside this empty quest, they joined"
12365,SONG,The merry feasters round those island fires
12366,SONG,Which over many a dark-blue creek illumed
12367,SONG,"Buccaneer camps in scarlet logwood groves,"
12368,SONG,"Fringing the Gulf of Mexico, till dawn"
12369,SONG,Summoned the Black Flags out to sweep the sea.
12370,SONG,
12371,SONG,But when Drake reached the flower-embowered boat
12372,SONG,And found the men awaiting his return
12373,SONG,"There, in a sheltering grove of bread-fruit trees"
12374,SONG,Beneath great eaves of leafage that obscured
12375,SONG,"Their sight, but kept the storm out, as they tossed"
12376,SONG,"Pieces of eight or rattled the bone dice,"
12377,SONG,"His voice went through them like a thunderbolt,"
12378,SONG,For none of them had seen the _Golden Hynde_
12379,SONG,Steal from the bay; and now the billows burst
12380,SONG,Like cannon down the coast; and they had thought
12381,SONG,Their boat could not be launched until the storm
12382,SONG,"Abated. Under Drake's compelling eyes,"
12383,SONG,"Nevertheless, they poled her down the creek"
12384,SONG,"Without one word, waiting their chance. Then all"
12385,SONG,"Together with their brandished oars they thrust,"
12386,SONG,And on the fierce white out-draught of a wave
12387,SONG,"They shot up, up and over the toppling crest"
12388,SONG,"Of the next, and plunged crashing into the trough"
12389,SONG,"Behind it: then they settled at their thwarts,"
12390,SONG,And the fierce water boiled before their blades
12391,SONG,"As, with Drake's iron hand upon the helm,"
12392,SONG,They soared and crashed across the rolling seas.
12393,SONG,
12394,SONG,"Not for the Spanish prize did Drake now steer,"
12395,SONG,"But for that little ship the _Marygold_,"
12396,SONG,"Swiftest of sail, next to the _Golden Hynde_,"
12397,SONG,"And, in the hands of Francis Drake, indeed"
12398,SONG,Swiftest of all; and ere the seamen knew
12399,SONG,"What power, as of a wind, bore them along,"
12400,SONG,"Anchor was up, their hands were on the sheets,"
12401,SONG,"The sails were broken out, the _Marygold_"
12402,SONG,"Was flying like a storm-cloud to the North,"
12403,SONG,And on her poop an iron statue still
12404,SONG,As death stood Francis Drake.
12405,SONG,One hour they rushed
12406,SONG,"Northward, with green seas washing o'er the deck"
12407,SONG,And buffeted with splendour; then they saw
12408,SONG,The _Golden Hynde_ like some wing-broken gull
12409,SONG,With torn mismanaged plumes beating the air
12410,SONG,In peril of utter shipwreck; saw her fly
12411,SONG,"Half-mast, a feeble signal of distress"
12412,SONG,Despite all Doughty's curses; for her crew
12413,SONG,Wild with divisions torn amongst themselves
12414,SONG,"Most gladly now surrendered in their hearts,"
12415,SONG,As close alongside grandly onward swept
12416,SONG,"The _Marygold_, with canvas trim and taut"
12417,SONG,"Magnificently drawing the full wind,"
12418,SONG,Her gunners waiting at their loaded guns
12419,SONG,Bare-armed and silent; and that iron soul
12420,SONG,"Alone, upon her silent quarter-deck."
12421,SONG,There they hauled up into the wind and lay
12422,SONG,"Rocking, while Drake, alone, without a guard,"
12423,SONG,"Boarding the runaway, dismissed his boat"
12424,SONG,Back to the _Marygold_. Then his voice out-rang
12425,SONG,"Trumpet-like o'er the trembling mutineers,"
12426,SONG,"And clearly, as if they were but busied still"
12427,SONG,"About the day's routine. They hid their shame,"
12428,SONG,"As men that would propitiate a god,"
12429,SONG,By flying to fulfil his lightest word;
12430,SONG,"And ere they knew what power, as of a wind,"
12431,SONG,"Impelled them--that half wreck was trim and taut,"
12432,SONG,Her sails all drawing and her bows afoam;
12433,SONG,"And, creeping past the _Marygold_ once more,"
12434,SONG,She led their Southward way! And not till then
12435,SONG,Did Drake vouchsafe one word to the white face
12436,SONG,"Of Doughty, as he furtively slunk nigh"
12437,SONG,With some new lie upon his fear-parched lips
12438,SONG,Thirsting for utterance in his crackling laugh
12439,SONG,Of deprecation; and with one ruffling puff
12440,SONG,Of pigeon courage in his blinded soul--
12441,SONG,"""I am no sea-dog--even Francis Drake"
12442,SONG,"Would scarce misuse a gentleman."""
12443,SONG,Then Drake turned
12444,SONG,And summoned four swart seamen out by name.
12445,SONG,His words went like a cold wind through their flesh
12446,SONG,"As with a passionless voice he slowly said,"
12447,SONG,"""Take ye this fellow: bind him to the mast"
12448,SONG,"Until what time I shall decide his fate."""
12449,SONG,"And Doughty gasped as at the world's blank end,--"
12450,SONG,"""Nay, Francis,"" cried he, ""wilt thou thus misuse"
12451,SONG,"A gentleman?"" But as the seamen gripped"
12452,SONG,His arms he struggled vainly and furiously
12453,SONG,To throw them off; and in his impotence
12454,SONG,Let slip the whole of his treacherous cause and hope
12455,SONG,"In empty wrath,--""Fore God,"" he foamed and snarled,"
12456,SONG,"""Ye shall all smart for this when we return!"
12457,SONG,"Unhand me, dogs! I have Lord Burleigh's power"
12458,SONG,Behind me. There is nothing I have done
12459,SONG,Without his warrant! Ye shall smart for this!
12460,SONG,"Unhand me, I say, unhand me!"""
12461,SONG,And in one flash
12462,SONG,"Drake saw the truth, and Doughty saw his eyes"
12463,SONG,Lighten upon him; and his false heart quailed
12464,SONG,Once more; and he suddenly suffered himself
12465,SONG,"Quietly, strangely, to be led away"
12466,SONG,And bound without a murmur to the mast.
12467,SONG,"And strangely Drake remembered, as those words,"
12468,SONG,"""Ye shall all smart for this when we return,"""
12469,SONG,"Yelped at his faith, how while the Dover cliffs"
12470,SONG,Faded from sight he leaned to his new friend
12471,SONG,"Doughty and said: ""I blame them not who stay!"
12472,SONG,"I blame them not at all who cling to home,"
12473,SONG,"For many of us, indeed, shall not return,"
12474,SONG,"Nor ever know that sweetness any more."""
12475,SONG,
12476,SONG,"And when they had reached their anchorage anew,"
12477,SONG,"Drake, having now resolved to bring his fleet"
12478,SONG,"Beneath a more compact control, at once"
12479,SONG,Took all the men and the chief guns and stores
12480,SONG,From out the Spanish prize; and sent Tom Moone
12481,SONG,To set the hulk afire. Also he bade
12482,SONG,Unbind the traitor and ordered him aboard
12483,SONG,"The pinnace _Christopher_. John Doughty, too,"
12484,SONG,"He ordered thither, into the grim charge"
12485,SONG,"Of old Tom Moone, thinking it best to keep"
12486,SONG,The poisonous leaven carefully apart
12487,SONG,"Until they had won well Southward, to a place"
12488,SONG,"Where, finally committed to their quest,"
12489,SONG,They might arraign the traitor without fear
12490,SONG,"Or favour, and acquit him or condemn."
12491,SONG,"But those two brothers, doubting as the false"
12492,SONG,"Are damned to doubt, saw murder in his eyes,"
12493,SONG,"And thought ""He means to sink the smack one night."""
12494,SONG,"And they refused to go, till Drake abruptly"
12495,SONG,Ordered them straightway to be slung on board
12496,SONG,With ropes.
12497,SONG,The daylight waned; but ere the sun
12498,SONG,"Sank, the five ships were plunging to the South;"
12499,SONG,"For Drake would halt no longer, least the crows"
12500,SONG,Also should halt betwixt two purposes.
12501,SONG,He took the tide of fortune at the flood;
12502,SONG,"And onward through the now subsiding storm,"
12503,SONG,Ere they could think what power as of a wind
12504,SONG,"Impelled them, he had swept them on their way."
12505,SONG,"Far, far into the night they saw the blaze"
12506,SONG,That leapt in crimson o'er the abandoned hulk
12507,SONG,"Behind them, like a mighty hecatomb"
12508,SONG,Marking the path of some Titanic will.
12509,SONG,Many a night and day they Southward drove.
12510,SONG,Sometimes at midnight round them all the sea
12511,SONG,"Quivered with witches' oils and water snakes,"
12512,SONG,"Green, blue, and red, with lambent tongues of fire."
12513,SONG,Mile upon mile about the blurred black hulls
12514,SONG,A cauldron of tempestuous colour coiled.
12515,SONG,"On every mast mysterious meteors burned,"
12516,SONG,And from the shores a bellowing rose and fell
12517,SONG,As of great bestial gods that walked all night
12518,SONG,"Through some wild hell unknown, too vast for men;"
12519,SONG,But when the silver and crimson of the dawn
12520,SONG,"Broke out, they saw the tropic shores anew,"
12521,SONG,"The fair white foam, and, round about the rocks,"
12522,SONG,Weird troops of tusked sea-lions; and the world
12523,SONG,Mixed with their dreams and made them stranger still.
12524,SONG,"And, once, so fierce a tempest scattered the fleet"
12525,SONG,That even the hardiest souls began to think
12526,SONG,There was a Jonah with them; for the seas
12527,SONG,"Rose round them like green mountains, peaked and rigged"
12528,SONG,With heights of Alpine snow amongst the clouds;
12529,SONG,"And many a league to Southward, when the ships"
12530,SONG,Gathered again amidst the sinking waves
12531,SONG,Four only met. The ship of Thomas Drake
12532,SONG,Was missing; and some thought it had gone down
12533,SONG,With all hands in the storm. But Francis Drake
12534,SONG,"Held on his way, learning from hour to hour"
12535,SONG,To merge himself in immortality;
12536,SONG,Learning the secrets of those pitiless laws
12537,SONG,"Which dwarf all mortal grief, all human pain,"
12538,SONG,To something less than nothing by the side
12539,SONG,"Of that eternal travail dimly guessed,"
12540,SONG,Since first he felt in the miraculous dark
12541,SONG,"The great bones of the Mastodon, that hulk"
12542,SONG,Of immemorial death. He learned to judge
12543,SONG,The passing pageant of this outward world
12544,SONG,As by the touch-stone of that memory;
12545,SONG,Even as in that country which some said
12546,SONG,"Lay now not far, the great Tezcucan king,"
12547,SONG,"Resting his jewelled hand upon a skull,"
12548,SONG,And on a smouldering glory of jewels throned
12549,SONG,There in his temple of the Unknown God
12550,SONG,"Over the host of Aztec princes, clad"
12551,SONG,In golden hauberks gleaming under soft
12552,SONG,"Surcoats of green or scarlet feather-work,"
12553,SONG,Could in the presence of a mightier power
12554,SONG,"Than life or death, give up his guilty sons,"
12555,SONG,"His only sons, to the sacrificial sword."
12556,SONG,"And hour by hour the soul of Francis Drake,"
12557,SONG,"Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth,"
12558,SONG,Increased in strength and stature as he drew
12559,SONG,"Earth, heaven, and hell within him, more and more."
12560,SONG,"For as the dream we call our world, with all"
12561,SONG,"Its hues is but a picture in the brain,"
12562,SONG,So did his soul enfold the universe
12563,SONG,"With gradual sense of superhuman power,"
12564,SONG,While every visible shape within the vast
12565,SONG,"Horizon seemed the symbol of some, thought"
12566,SONG,Waiting for utterance. He had found indeed
12567,SONG,"God's own Nirvana, not of empty dream,"
12568,SONG,But of intensest life. Nor did he think
12569,SONG,"Aught of all this; but, as the rustic deems"
12570,SONG,The colours that he carries in his brain
12571,SONG,Are somehow all outside him while he peers
12572,SONG,"Unaltered through two windows in his face,"
12573,SONG,Drake only knew that as the four ships plunged
12574,SONG,"Southward, the world mysteriously grew"
12575,SONG,"More like a prophet's vision, hour by hour,"
12576,SONG,"Fraught with dark omens and significances,"
12577,SONG,A world of hieroglyphs and sacred signs
12578,SONG,Wherein he seemed to read the truth that lay
12579,SONG,Hid from the Roman augurs when of old
12580,SONG,They told the future from the flight of birds.
12581,SONG,How vivid with disaster seemed the flight
12582,SONG,Of those blood-red flamingoes o'er the dim
12583,SONG,"Blue steaming forest, like two terrible thoughts"
12584,SONG,"Flashing, unapprehended, through his brain!"
12585,SONG,
12586,SONG,"And now, as they drove Southward, day and night,"
12587,SONG,"Through storm and calm, the shores that fleeted by"
12588,SONG,"Grew wilder, grander, with his growing soul,"
12589,SONG,And pregnant with the approaching mystery.
12590,SONG,And now along the Patagonian coast
12591,SONG,"They cruised, and in the solemn midnight saw"
12592,SONG,"Wildernesses of shaggy barren marl,"
12593,SONG,"Petrified seas of lava, league on league,"
12594,SONG,Craters and bouldered slopes and granite cliffs
12595,SONG,"With ragged rents, grim gorges, deep ravines,"
12596,SONG,And precipice on precipice up-piled
12597,SONG,Innumerable to those dim distances
12598,SONG,"Where, over valleys hanging in the clouds,"
12599,SONG,Gigantic mountains and volcanic peaks
12600,SONG,Catching the wefts of cirrus fleece appeared
12601,SONG,"To smoke against the sky, though all was now"
12602,SONG,"Dead as that frozen chaos of the moon,"
12603,SONG,Or some huge passion of a slaughtered soul
12604,SONG,Prostrate under the marching of the stars.
12605,SONG,
12606,SONG,"At last, and in a silver dawn, they came"
12607,SONG,"Suddenly on a broad-winged estuary,"
12608,SONG,"And, in the midst of it, an island lay,"
12609,SONG,"There they found shelter, on its leeward side,"
12610,SONG,And Drake convened upon the _Golden Hynde_
12611,SONG,His dread court-martial. Two long hours he heard
12612,SONG,"Defence and accusation, then broke up"
12613,SONG,"The conclave, and, with burning heart and brain,"
12614,SONG,Feverishly seeking everywhere some sign
12615,SONG,"To guide him, went ashore upon that isle,"
12616,SONG,"And lo, turning a rugged point of rock,"
12617,SONG,"He rubbed his eyes to find out if he dreamed,"
12618,SONG,"For there--a Crusoe's wonder, a miracle,"
12619,SONG,A sign--before him stood on that lone strand
12620,SONG,"Stark, with a stern arm pointing out his way"
12621,SONG,"And jangling still one withered skeleton,"
12622,SONG,The grim black gallows where Magellan hanged
12623,SONG,His mutineers. Its base was white with bones
12624,SONG,"Picked by the gulls, and crumbling o'er the sand"
12625,SONG,"A dread sea-salt, dry from the tides of time."
12626,SONG,"There, on that lonely shore, Death's finger-post"
12627,SONG,Stood like some old forgotten truth made strange
12628,SONG,"By the long lapse of many memories,"
12629,SONG,All starting up in resurrection now
12630,SONG,"As at the trump of doom, heroic ghosts"
12631,SONG,Out of the cells and graves of his deep brain
12632,SONG,"Reproaching him. ""_Were this man not thy friend,"
12633,SONG,Ere now he should have died the traitor's death.
12634,SONG,"What wilt thou say to others if they, too,"
12635,SONG,Prove false? Or wilt thou slay the lesser and save
12636,SONG,"The greater sinner? Nay, if thy right hand"
12637,SONG,"Offend thee, cut it off!_"" And, in one flash,"
12638,SONG,Drake saw his path and chose it.
12639,SONG,With a voice
12640,SONG,Low as the passionless anguished voice of Fate
12641,SONG,"That comprehends all pain, but girds it round"
12642,SONG,"With iron, lest some random cry break out"
12643,SONG,"For man's misguidance, he drew all his men"
12644,SONG,"Around him, saying, ""Ye all know how I loved"
12645,SONG,"Doughty, who hath betrayed me twice and thrice,"
12646,SONG,For I still trusted him: he was no felon
12647,SONG,That I should turn my heart away from him.
12648,SONG,He is the type and image of man's laws;
12649,SONG,While I--am lawless as the soul that still
12650,SONG,"Must sail and seek a world beyond the worlds,"
12651,SONG,A law behind earth's laws. I dare not judge!
12652,SONG,"But ye--who know the mighty goal we seek,"
12653,SONG,"Who have seen him sap our courage, hour by hour,"
12654,SONG,Till God Himself almost appeared a dream
12655,SONG,Behind his technicalities and doubts
12656,SONG,Of aught he could not touch or handle: ye
12657,SONG,Who have seen him stir up jealousy and strife
12658,SONG,"Between our seamen and our gentlemen,"
12659,SONG,"Even as the world stirs up continual strife,"
12660,SONG,Bidding the man forget he is a man
12661,SONG,With God's own patent of nobility;
12662,SONG,Ye who have seen him strike this last sharp blow--
12663,SONG,"Sharper than any enemy hath struck,--"
12664,SONG,"He whom I trusted, he alone could strike--"
12665,SONG,"So sharply, for indeed I loved this man."
12666,SONG,"Judge ye--for see, I cannot. Do not doubt"
12667,SONG,I loved this man!
12668,SONG,"But now, if ye will let him have his life,"
12669,SONG,"Oh, speak! But, if ye think it must be death,"
12670,SONG,"Hold up your hands in silence!"" His voice dropped,"
12671,SONG,And eagerly he whispered forth one word
12672,SONG,Beyond the scope of Fate--
12673,SONG,"""I would not have him die!"" There was no sound"
12674,SONG,"Save the long thunder of eternal seas,--"
12675,SONG,Drake bowed his head and waited.
12676,SONG,"Suddenly,"
12677,SONG,"One man upheld his hand; then, all at once,"
12678,SONG,A brawny forest of brown arms arose
12679,SONG,"In silence, and the great sea whispered _Death_."
12680,SONG,
12681,SONG,*   *   *   *
12682,SONG,
12683,SONG,"There, with one big swift impulse, Francis Drake"
12684,SONG,Held out his right sun-blackened hand and gripped
12685,SONG,"The hand that Doughty proffered him; and lo,"
12686,SONG,"Doughty laughed out and said, ""Since I must die,"
12687,SONG,"Let us have one more hour of comradeship,"
12688,SONG,One hour as old companions. Let us make
12689,SONG,"A feast here, on this island, ere I go"
12690,SONG,"Where there is no more feasting."" So they made"
12691,SONG,A great and solemn banquet as the day
12692,SONG,Decreased; and Doughty bade them all unlock
12693,SONG,Their sea-chests and bring out their rich array.
12694,SONG,"There, by that wondering ocean of the West,"
12695,SONG,"In crimson doublets, lined and slashed with gold,"
12696,SONG,In broidered lace and double golden chains
12697,SONG,Embossed with rubies and great cloudy pearls
12698,SONG,"They feasted, gentlemen adventurers,"
12699,SONG,"Drinking old malmsey, as the sun sank down."
12700,SONG,
12701,SONG,"Now Doughty, fronting the rich death of day,"
12702,SONG,And flourishing a silver pouncet-box
12703,SONG,"With many a courtly jest and rare conceit,"
12704,SONG,"There as he sat in rich attire, out-braved"
12705,SONG,"The rest. Though darker-hued, yet richer far,"
12706,SONG,His murrey-coloured doublet double-piled
12707,SONG,"Of Genoa velvet, puffed with ciprus, shone;"
12708,SONG,For over its grave hues the gems that bossed
12709,SONG,"His golden collar, wondrously relieved,"
12710,SONG,Blazed lustrous to the West like stars. But Drake
12711,SONG,"Was clad in black, with midnight silver slashed,"
12712,SONG,"And, at his side, a great two-handed sword."
12713,SONG,"At last they rose, just as the sun's last rays"
12714,SONG,Rested upon the heaving molten gold
12715,SONG,Immeasurable. The long slow sigh of the waves
12716,SONG,That creamed across the lonely time-worn reef
12717,SONG,All round the island seemed the very voice
12718,SONG,Of the Everlasting: black against the sea
12719,SONG,The gallows of Magellan stretched its arm
12720,SONG,With the gaunt skeleton and its rusty chain
12721,SONG,Creaking and swinging in the solemn breath
12722,SONG,Of eventide like some strange pendulum
12723,SONG,Measuring out the moments that remained.
12724,SONG,There did they take the holy sacrament
12725,SONG,Of Jesus' body and blood. Then Doughty and Drake
12726,SONG,"Kissed each other, as brothers, on the cheek;"
12727,SONG,"And Doughty knelt. And Drake, without one word,"
12728,SONG,Leaning upon the two-edged naked sword
12729,SONG,"Stood at his side, with iron lips, and eyes"
12730,SONG,Full of the sunset; while the doomed man bowed
12731,SONG,His head upon a rock. The great sun dropped
12732,SONG,"Suddenly, and the land and sea were dark;"
12733,SONG,"And as it were a sign, Drake lifted up"
12734,SONG,The gleaming sword. It seemed to sweep the heavens
12735,SONG,"Down in its arc as he smote, once, and no more."
12736,SONG,
12737,SONG,"Then, for a moment, silence froze their veins,"
12738,SONG,Till one fierce seamen stooped with a hoarse cry;
12739,SONG,"And, like an eagle clutching up its prey,"
12740,SONG,"His arm swooped down and bore the head aloft,"
12741,SONG,"Gorily streaming, by the long dark hair;"
12742,SONG,"And a great shout went up, ""So perish all"
12743,SONG,"Traitors to God and England."" Then Drake turned"
12744,SONG,"And bade them to their ships; and, wondering,"
12745,SONG,They left him. As the boats thrust out from shore
12746,SONG,Brave old Tom Moone looked back with faithful eyes
12747,SONG,Like a great mastiff to his master's face.
12748,SONG,"He, looming larger from his loftier ground"
12749,SONG,Clad with the slowly gathering night of stars
12750,SONG,"And gazing seaward o'er his quiet dead,"
12751,SONG,Seemed like some Titan bronze in grandeur based
12752,SONG,Unshakeable until the crash of doom
12753,SONG,Shatter the black foundations of the world.

12758,BOOK IV,"Dawn, everlasting and almighty Dawn,"
12759,BOOK IV,"Hailed by ten thousand names of death and birth,"
12760,BOOK IV,"Who, chiefly by thy name of Sorrow, seem'st"
12761,BOOK IV,"To half the world a sunset, God's great Dawn,"
12762,BOOK IV,Fair light of all earth's partings till we meet
12763,BOOK IV,"Where dawn and sunset, mingling East and West,"
12764,BOOK IV,Shall make in some deep Orient of the soul
12765,BOOK IV,One radiant Rose of Love for evermore;
12766,BOOK IV,"Teach me, oh teach to bear thy broadening light,"
12767,BOOK IV,"Thy deepening wonder, lest as old dreams fade"
12768,BOOK IV,"With love's unfaith, like wasted hours of youth,"
12769,BOOK IV,"And dim illusions vanish in thy beam,"
12770,BOOK IV,Their rapture and their anguish break that heart
12771,BOOK IV,"Which loved them, and must love for ever now."
12772,BOOK IV,"Let thy great sphere of splendour, ring by ring"
12773,BOOK IV,"For ever widening, draw new seas, new skies,"
12774,BOOK IV,"Within my ken; yet, as I still must bear"
12775,BOOK IV,"This love, help me to grow in spirit with thee."
12776,BOOK IV,Dawn on my song which trembles like a cloud
12777,BOOK IV,"Pierced with thy beauty. Rise, shine, as of old"
12778,BOOK IV,Across the wondering ocean in the sight
12779,BOOK IV,"Of those world-wandering mariners, when earth"
12780,BOOK IV,"Rolled flat up to the Gates of Paradise,"
12781,BOOK IV,And each slow mist that curled its gold away
12782,BOOK IV,From each new sea they furrowed into pearl
12783,BOOK IV,Might bring before their blinded mortal eyes
12784,BOOK IV,God and the Glory. Lighten as on the soul
12785,BOOK IV,"Of him that all night long in torment dire,"
12786,BOOK IV,Anguish and thirst unceasing for thy ray
12787,BOOK IV,Upon that lonely Patagonian shore
12788,BOOK IV,Had lain as on the bitterest coasts of Hell.
12789,BOOK IV,"For all night long, mocked by the dreadful peace"
12790,BOOK IV,Of world-wide seas that darkly heaved and sank
12791,BOOK IV,"With cold recurrence, like the slow sad breath"
12792,BOOK IV,Of a fallen Titan dying all alone
12793,BOOK IV,"In lands beyond all human loneliness,"
12794,BOOK IV,While far and wide glimmers that broken targe
12795,BOOK IV,"Hurled from tremendous battle with the gods,"
12796,BOOK IV,"And, as he breathes in pain, the chain-mail rings"
12797,BOOK IV,Round his broad breast a muffled rattling make
12798,BOOK IV,"For many a league, so seemed the sound of waves"
12799,BOOK IV,"Upon those beaches--there, be-mocked all night,"
12800,BOOK IV,"Beneath Magellan's gallows, Drake had watched"
12801,BOOK IV,Beside his dead; and over him the stars
12802,BOOK IV,Paled as the silver chariot of the moon
12803,BOOK IV,"Drove, and her white steeds ramped in a fury of foam"
12804,BOOK IV,On splendid peaks of cloud. The _Golden Hynde_
12805,BOOK IV,Slept with those other shadows on the bay.
12806,BOOK IV,Between him and his home the Atlantic heaved;
12807,BOOK IV,"And, on the darker side, across the strait"
12808,BOOK IV,Of starry sheen that softly rippled and flowed
12809,BOOK IV,"Betwixt the mainland and his isle, it seemed"
12810,BOOK IV,Death's Gates indeed burst open. The night yawned
12811,BOOK IV,Like a foul wound. Black shapes of the outer dark
12812,BOOK IV,Poured out of forests older than the world;
12813,BOOK IV,"And, just as reptiles that take form and hue,"
12814,BOOK IV,"Speckle and blotch, in strange assimilation"
12815,BOOK IV,From thorn and scrub and stone and the waste earth
12816,BOOK IV,"Through which they crawl, so that almost they seem"
12817,BOOK IV,"The incarnate spirits of their wilderness,"
12818,BOOK IV,Were these most horrible kindred of the night.
12819,BOOK IV,"Æonian glooms unfathomable, grim aisles,"
12820,BOOK IV,"Grotesque, distorted boughs and dancing shades"
12821,BOOK IV,Out-belched their dusky brood on the dim shore;
12822,BOOK IV,"Monsters with sooty limbs, red-raddled eyes,"
12823,BOOK IV,"And faces painted yellow, women and men;"
12824,BOOK IV,"Fierce naked giants howling to the moon,"
12825,BOOK IV,And loathlier Gorgons with long snaky tresses
12826,BOOK IV,Pouring vile purple over pendulous breasts
12827,BOOK IV,Like wine-bags. On the mainland beach they lit
12828,BOOK IV,A brushwood fire that reddened creek and cove
12829,BOOK IV,And lapped their swarthy limbs with hideous tongues
12830,BOOK IV,Of flame; so near that by their light Drake saw
12831,BOOK IV,The blood upon the dead man's long black hair
12832,BOOK IV,Clotting corruption. The fierce funeral pyre
12833,BOOK IV,Of all things fair seemed rolling on that shore;
12834,BOOK IV,"And in that dull red battle of smoke and flame,"
12835,BOOK IV,"While the sea crunched the pebbles, and dark drums"
12836,BOOK IV,Rumbled out of the gloom as if this earth
12837,BOOK IV,Had some Titanic tigress for a soul
12838,BOOK IV,Purring in forests of Eternity
12839,BOOK IV,"Over her own grim dreams, his lonely spirit"
12840,BOOK IV,Passed through the circles of a world-wide waste
12841,BOOK IV,Darker than ever Dante roamed. No gulf
12842,BOOK IV,"Was this of fierce harmonious reward,"
12843,BOOK IV,"Where Evil moans in anguish after death,"
12844,BOOK IV,"Where all men reap as they have sown, where gluttons"
12845,BOOK IV,Gorge upon toads and usurers gulp hot streams
12846,BOOK IV,Of molten gold. This was that Malebolge
12847,BOOK IV,"Which hath no harmony to mortal ears,"
12848,BOOK IV,But seems the reeling and tremendous dream
12849,BOOK IV,Of some omnipotent madman. There he saw
12850,BOOK IV,The naked giants dragging to the flames
12851,BOOK IV,Young captives hideous with a new despair:
12852,BOOK IV,He saw great craggy blood-stained stones upheaved
12853,BOOK IV,"To slaughter, saw through mists of blood and fire"
12854,BOOK IV,"The cannibal feast prepared, saw filthy hands"
12855,BOOK IV,"Rend limb from limb, and almost dreamed he saw"
12856,BOOK IV,Foul mouths a-drip with quivering human flesh
12857,BOOK IV,And horrible laughter in the crimson storm
12858,BOOK IV,That clomb and leapt and stabbed at the high heaven
12859,BOOK IV,Till the whole night seemed saturate with red.
12860,BOOK IV,
12861,BOOK IV,"And all night long upon the _Golden Hynde_,"
12862,BOOK IV,"A cloud upon the waters, brave Tom Moone"
12863,BOOK IV,Watched o'er the bulwarks for some dusky plunge
12864,BOOK IV,To warn him if that savage crew should mark
12865,BOOK IV,His captain and swim over to his isle.
12866,BOOK IV,"Whistle in hand he watched, his boat well ready,"
12867,BOOK IV,"His men low-crouched around him, swarthy faces"
12868,BOOK IV,"Grim-chinned upon the taffrail, muttering oaths"
12869,BOOK IV,"That trampled down the fear i' their bristly throats,"
12870,BOOK IV,While at their sides a dreadful hint of steel
12871,BOOK IV,Sent stray gleams to the stars. But little heed
12872,BOOK IV,"Had Drake of all that menaced him, though oft"
12873,BOOK IV,"Some wandering giant, belching from the feast,"
12874,BOOK IV,"All blood-besmeared, would come so near he heard"
12875,BOOK IV,His heavy breathing o'er the narrow strait.
12876,BOOK IV,"Yet little care had Drake, for though he sat"
12877,BOOK IV,"Bowed in the body above his quiet dead,"
12878,BOOK IV,"His burning spirit wandered through the wastes,"
12879,BOOK IV,"Wandered through hells behind the apparent hell,"
12880,BOOK IV,"Horrors immeasurable, clutching at dreams"
12881,BOOK IV,"Found fair of old, but now most foul. The world"
12882,BOOK IV,Leered at him through its old remembered mask
12883,BOOK IV,Of beauty: the green grass that clothed the fields
12884,BOOK IV,"Of England (shallow, shallow fairy dream!)"
12885,BOOK IV,What was it but the hair of dead men's graves.
12886,BOOK IV,"Rooted in death, enriched with all decay?"
12887,BOOK IV,And like a leprosy the hawthorn bloom
12888,BOOK IV,Crawled o'er the whitening bosom of the spring;
12889,BOOK IV,"And bird and beast and insect, ay and man,"
12890,BOOK IV,How fat they fed on one another's blood!
12891,BOOK IV,"And Love, what faith in Love, when spirit and flesh"
12892,BOOK IV,Are found of such a filthy composition?
12893,BOOK IV,"And Knowledge, God, his mind went reeling back"
12894,BOOK IV,To that dark voyage on the deadly coast
12895,BOOK IV,"Of Panama, where one by one his men"
12896,BOOK IV,"Sickened and died of some unknown disease,"
12897,BOOK IV,"Till Joseph, his own brother, in his arms"
12898,BOOK IV,"Died; and Drake trampled down all tender thought,"
12899,BOOK IV,"All human grief, and sought to find the cause,"
12900,BOOK IV,"For his crew's sake, the ravenous unknown cause"
12901,BOOK IV,"Of that fell scourge. There, in his own dark cabin,"
12902,BOOK IV,"Lit by the wild light of the swinging lanthorn,"
12903,BOOK IV,He laid the naked body on that board
12904,BOOK IV,Where they had supped together. He took the knife
12905,BOOK IV,"From the ague-stricken surgeon's palsied hands,"
12906,BOOK IV,And while the ship rocked in the eternal seas
12907,BOOK IV,And dark waves lapped against the rolling hulk
12908,BOOK IV,"Making the silence terrible with voices,"
12909,BOOK IV,"He opened his own brother's cold white corse,"
12910,BOOK IV,"That pale deserted mansion of a soul,"
12911,BOOK IV,"Bidding the surgeon mark, with his own eyes,"
12912,BOOK IV,"While yet he had strength to use them, the foul spots,"
12913,BOOK IV,"The swollen liver, the strange sodden heart,"
12914,BOOK IV,"The yellow intestines. Yea, his dry lips hissed"
12915,BOOK IV,"There in the stark face of Eternity,"
12916,BOOK IV,"""Seëst thou? Seëst thou? Knowest thou what it means?"""
12917,BOOK IV,"Then, like a dream up-surged the belfried night"
12918,BOOK IV,"Of Saint Bartholomew, the scented palaces"
12919,BOOK IV,Whence harlots leered out on the twisted streets
12920,BOOK IV,"Of Paris, choked with slaughter! Europe flamed"
12921,BOOK IV,"With human torches, living altar candles,"
12922,BOOK IV,Lighted before the Cross where men had hanged
12923,BOOK IV,The Christ of little children. Cirque by cirque
12924,BOOK IV,"The world-wide hell reeled round him, East and West,"
12925,BOOK IV,To where the tortured Indians worked the will
12926,BOOK IV,Of lordly Spain in golden-famed Peru.
12927,BOOK IV,"""God, is thy world a madman's dream?"" he groaned:"
12928,BOOK IV,"And suddenly, the clamour on the shore"
12929,BOOK IV,Sank and that savage horde melted away
12930,BOOK IV,"Into the midnight forest as it came,"
12931,BOOK IV,"Leaving no sign, save where the brushwood fire"
12932,BOOK IV,Still smouldered like a ruby in the gloom;
12933,BOOK IV,And into the inmost caverns of his mind
12934,BOOK IV,"That other clamour sank, and there was peace."
12935,BOOK IV,"""A madman's dream,"" he whispered, ""Ay, to me"
12936,BOOK IV,"A madman's dream,"" but better, better far"
12937,BOOK IV,"Than that which bears upon its awful gates,"
12938,BOOK IV,"Gates of a hell defined, unalterable,"
12939,BOOK IV,_Abandon hope all ye who enter here!_
12940,BOOK IV,"Here, here at least the dawn hath power to bring"
12941,BOOK IV,"New light, new hope, new battles. Men may fight"
12942,BOOK IV,"And sweep away that evil, if no more,"
12943,BOOK IV,At least from the small circle of their swords;
12944,BOOK IV,"Then die, content if they have struck one stroke"
12945,BOOK IV,"For freedom, knowledge, brotherhood; one stroke"
12946,BOOK IV,To hasten that great kingdom God proclaims
12947,BOOK IV,Each morning through the trumpets of the Dawn.
12948,BOOK IV,
12949,BOOK IV,"And far away, in Italy, that night"
12950,BOOK IV,"Young Galileo, gazing upward, heard"
12951,BOOK IV,The self-same whisper from the abyss of stars
12952,BOOK IV,Which lured the soul of Shakespeare as he lay
12953,BOOK IV,"Dreaming in may-sweet England, even now,"
12954,BOOK IV,And with its infinite music called once more
12955,BOOK IV,The soul of Drake out to the unknown West.
12956,BOOK IV,
12957,BOOK IV,Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven
12958,BOOK IV,"Slipt forth the slender fingers of the Dawn,"
12959,BOOK IV,And drew the great grey Eastern curtains back
12960,BOOK IV,From the ivory saffroned couch. Rosily slid
12961,BOOK IV,One shining foot and one warm rounded knee
12962,BOOK IV,From silken coverlets of the tossed-back clouds.
12963,BOOK IV,"Then, like the meeting after desolate years,"
12964,BOOK IV,"Face to remembered face, Drake saw the Dawn"
12965,BOOK IV,Step forth in naked splendour o'er the sea;
12966,BOOK IV,"Dawn, bearing still her rich divine increase"
12967,BOOK IV,"Of beauty, love, and wisdom round the world;"
12968,BOOK IV,"The same, yet not the same. So strangely gleamed"
12969,BOOK IV,Her pearl and rose across the sapphire waves
12970,BOOK IV,That scarce he knew the dead man at his feet.
12971,BOOK IV,His world was made anew. Strangely his voice
12972,BOOK IV,Rang through that solemn Eden of the morn
12973,BOOK IV,"Calling his men, and stranger than a dream"
12974,BOOK IV,"Their boats black-blurred against the crimson East,"
12975,BOOK IV,Or flashing misty sheen where'er the light
12976,BOOK IV,"Smote on their smooth wet sides, like seraph ships"
12977,BOOK IV,Moved in a dewy glory towards the land;
12978,BOOK IV,Their oars of glittering diamond broke the sea
12979,BOOK IV,As by enchantment into burning jewels
12980,BOOK IV,And scattered rainbows from their flaming blades.
12981,BOOK IV,"The clear green water lapping round their prows,"
12982,BOOK IV,The words of sharp command as now the keels
12983,BOOK IV,"Crunched on his lonely shore, and the following wave"
12984,BOOK IV,"Leapt slapping o'er the sterns, in that new light"
12985,BOOK IV,Were more than any miracle. At last
12986,BOOK IV,"Drake, as they grouped a little way below"
12987,BOOK IV,"The crumbling sandy cliff whereon he stood,"
12988,BOOK IV,Seeming to overshadow them as he loomed
12989,BOOK IV,"A cloud of black against the crimson sky,"
12990,BOOK IV,"Spoke, as a man may hardly speak but once:"
12991,BOOK IV,"""My seamen, oh my friends, companions, kings;"
12992,BOOK IV,"For I am least among you, being your captain;"
12993,BOOK IV,"And ye are men, and all men born are kings,"
12994,BOOK IV,"By right divine, and I the least of these"
12995,BOOK IV,Because I must usurp the throne of God
12996,BOOK IV,"And sit in judgment, even till I have set"
12997,BOOK IV,"My seal upon the red wax of this blood,"
12998,BOOK IV,"This blood of my dead friend, ere it grow cold."
12999,BOOK IV,Not all the waters of that mighty sea
13000,BOOK IV,Could wash my hands of sin if I should now
13001,BOOK IV,"Falter upon my path. But look to it, you,"
13002,BOOK IV,Whose word was doom last night to this dead man;
13003,BOOK IV,"Look to it, I say, look to it! Brave men might shrink"
13004,BOOK IV,From this great voyage; but the heart of him
13005,BOOK IV,Who dares turn backward now must be so hardy
13006,BOOK IV,That God might make a thousand millstones of it
13007,BOOK IV,To hang about the necks of those that hurt
13008,BOOK IV,"Some little child, and cast them in the sea."
13009,BOOK IV,"Yet if ye will be found so more than bold,"
13010,BOOK IV,"Speak now, and I will hear you; God will judge."
13011,BOOK IV,"But ye shall take four ships of these my five,"
13012,BOOK IV,"Tear out the lions from their painted shields,"
13013,BOOK IV,"And speed you homeward. Leave me but one ship,"
13014,BOOK IV,"My _Golden Hynde_, and five good friends, nay one,"
13015,BOOK IV,"To watch when I must sleep, and I will prove"
13016,BOOK IV,This judgment just against all winds that blow.
13017,BOOK IV,"Now ye that will return, speak, let me know you,"
13018,BOOK IV,"Or be for ever silent, for I swear"
13019,BOOK IV,"Over this butchered body, if any swerve"
13020,BOOK IV,"Hereafter from the straight and perilous way,"
13021,BOOK IV,He shall not die alone. What? Will none speak?
13022,BOOK IV,"My comrades and my friends! Yet ye must learn,"
13023,BOOK IV,"Mark me, my friends, I'd have you all to know"
13024,BOOK IV,That ye are kings. I'll have no jealousies
13025,BOOK IV,Aboard my fleet. I'll have the gentleman
13026,BOOK IV,To pull and haul wi' the seaman. I'll not have
13027,BOOK IV,That canker of the Spaniards in my fleet.
13028,BOOK IV,"Ye that were captains, I cashier you all."
13029,BOOK IV,"I'll have no captains; I'll have nought but seamen,"
13030,BOOK IV,"Obedient to my will, because I serve"
13031,BOOK IV,"England. What, will ye murmur? Have a care,"
13032,BOOK IV,"Lest I should bid you homeward all alone,"
13033,BOOK IV,You whose white hands are found too delicate
13034,BOOK IV,For aught but dallying with your jewelled swords!
13035,BOOK IV,"And thou, too, master Fletcher, my ship's chaplain,"
13036,BOOK IV,"Mark me, I'll have no priest-craft. I have heard"
13037,BOOK IV,"Overmuch talk of judgment from thy lips,"
13038,BOOK IV,"God's judgment here, God's judgment there, upon us!"
13039,BOOK IV,"Whene'er the winds are contrary, thou takest"
13040,BOOK IV,Their powers upon thee for thy moment's end.
13041,BOOK IV,"Thou art God's minister, not God's oracle:"
13042,BOOK IV,"Chain up thy tongue a little, or, by His wounds,"
13043,BOOK IV,"If thou canst read this wide world like a book,"
13044,BOOK IV,"Thou hast so little to fear, I'll set thee adrift"
13045,BOOK IV,On God's great sea to find thine own way home.
13046,BOOK IV,"Why, 'tis these very tyrannies o' the soul"
13047,BOOK IV,We strike at when we strike at Spain for England;
13048,BOOK IV,"And shall we here, in this great wilderness,"
13049,BOOK IV,"Ungrappled and unchallenged, out of sight,"
13050,BOOK IV,"Alone, without one struggle, sink that flag"
13051,BOOK IV,"Which, when the cannon thundered, could but stream"
13052,BOOK IV,Triumphant over all the storms of death.
13053,BOOK IV,"Nay, master Wynter and my gallant captains,"
13054,BOOK IV,I see ye are tamed. Take up your ranks again
13055,BOOK IV,"In humbleness, remembering ye are kings,"
13056,BOOK IV,"Kings for the sake and by the will of England,"
13057,BOOK IV,Therefore her servants till your lives' last end.
13058,BOOK IV,"Comrades, mistake not this, our little fleet"
13059,BOOK IV,"Is freighted with the golden heart of England,"
13060,BOOK IV,"And, if we fail, that golden heart will break."
13061,BOOK IV,"The world's wide eyes are on us, and our souls"
13062,BOOK IV,Are woven together into one great flag
13063,BOOK IV,Of England. Shall we strike it? Shall it be rent
13064,BOOK IV,"Asunder with small discord, party strife,"
13065,BOOK IV,"Ephemeral conflict of contemptible tongues,"
13066,BOOK IV,"Or shall it be blazoned, blazoned evermore"
13067,BOOK IV,On the most heaven-wide page of history?
13068,BOOK IV,"This is that hour, I know it in my soul,"
13069,BOOK IV,"When we must choose for England. Ye are kings,"
13070,BOOK IV,"And sons of Vikings, exiled from your throne."
13071,BOOK IV,"Have ye forgotten? Nay, your blood remembers!"
13072,BOOK IV,"There is your kingdom, Vikings, that great ocean"
13073,BOOK IV,Whose tang is in your nostrils. Ye must choose
13074,BOOK IV,"Whether to re-assume it now for England,"
13075,BOOK IV,"To claim its thunders for her panoply,"
13076,BOOK IV,"To lay its lightnings in her sovereign hands,"
13077,BOOK IV,Win her the great commandment of the sea

13080,BOOK IV,"All evil deeds and dreams, or whether to yield"
13081,BOOK IV,For evermore that kinghood. Ye must learn
13082,BOOK IV,Here in this golden dawn our great emprise
13083,BOOK IV,"Is greater than we knew. Eye hath not seen,"
13084,BOOK IV,Ear hath not heard what came across the dark
13085,BOOK IV,"Last night, as there anointed with that blood"
13086,BOOK IV,I knelt and saw the wonder that should be.
13087,BOOK IV,"I saw new heavens of freedom, a new earth"
13088,BOOK IV,Released from all old tyrannies. I saw
13089,BOOK IV,"The brotherhood of man, for which we rode,"
13090,BOOK IV,"Most ignorant of the splendour of our spears,"
13091,BOOK IV,Against the crimson dynasties of Spain.
13092,BOOK IV,"Mother of freedom, home and hope and love,"
13093,BOOK IV,"Our little island, far, how far away,"
13094,BOOK IV,"I saw thee shatter the whole world of hate,"

13099,BOOK IV,And ere they knew
13100,BOOK IV,"What power impelled them, with one mighty cry"
13101,BOOK IV,They lifted up their hearts to the new dawn
13102,BOOK IV,"And hastened down the shores and launched the boats,"
13103,BOOK IV,And in the fierce white out-draught of the waves
13104,BOOK IV,Thrust with their brandished oars and the boats leapt
13105,BOOK IV,"Out, and they settled at the groaning thwarts,"
13106,BOOK IV,"And the white water boiled before their blades,"
13107,BOOK IV,"As, with Drake's iron hand upon the helm,"
13108,BOOK IV,His own boat led the way; and ere they knew
13109,BOOK IV,"What power as of a wind bore them along,"
13110,BOOK IV,"Anchor was up, their hands were on the sheets,"
13111,BOOK IV,The sails were broken out and that small squadron
13112,BOOK IV,Was flying like a sea-bird to the South.
13113,BOOK IV,"Now to the strait Magellanus they came,"
13114,BOOK IV,And entered in with ringing shouts of joy.
13115,BOOK IV,"Nor did they think there, was a fairer strait"
13116,BOOK IV,In all the world than this which lay so calm
13117,BOOK IV,"Between great silent mountains crowned with snow,"
13118,BOOK IV,Unutterably lonely. Marvellous
13119,BOOK IV,"The pomp of dawn and sunset on those heights,"
13120,BOOK IV,And like a strange new sacrilege the advance
13121,BOOK IV,Of prows that ploughed that time-forgotten tide.
13122,BOOK IV,"But soon rude flaws, cross currents, tortuous channels"
13123,BOOK IV,"Bewildered them, and many a league they drove"
13124,BOOK IV,"As down some vaster Acheron, while the coasts"
13125,BOOK IV,"With wailing voices cursed them all night long,"
13126,BOOK IV,And once again the hideous fires leapt red
13127,BOOK IV,By many a grim wrenched crag and gaunt ravine.
13128,BOOK IV,So for a hundred leagues of whirling spume
13129,BOOK IV,"They groped, till suddenly, far away, they saw"
13130,BOOK IV,"Full of the sunset, like a cup of gold,"
13131,BOOK IV,The purple Westward portals of the strait.
13132,BOOK IV,Onward o'er roughening waves they plunged and reached
13133,BOOK IV,"_Capo Desiderato_, where they saw"
13134,BOOK IV,"What seemed stupendous in that lonely place,--"
13135,BOOK IV,"Gaunt, black, and sharp as death against the sky"
13136,BOOK IV,"The Cross, the great black Cross on Cape Desire,"
13137,BOOK IV,Which dead Magellan raised upon the height
13138,BOOK IV,"To guide, or so he thought, his wandering ships,"
13139,BOOK IV,"Not knowing they had left him to his doom,"
13140,BOOK IV,"Not knowing how with tears, with tears of joy,"
13141,BOOK IV,"Rapture, and terrible triumph, and deep awe,"
13142,BOOK IV,Another should come voyaging and read
13143,BOOK IV,Unutterable glories in that sign;
13144,BOOK IV,While his rough seamen raised their mighty shout
13145,BOOK IV,"And, once again, before his wondering eyes,"
13146,BOOK IV,"League upon league of awful burnished gold,"
13147,BOOK IV,Rolled the unknown immeasurable sea.
13148,BOOK IV,
13149,BOOK IV,"Now, in those days, as even Magellan held,"
13150,BOOK IV,Men thought that Southward of the strait there swept
13151,BOOK IV,"Firm land up to the white Antarticke Pole,"
13152,BOOK IV,Which now not far they deemed. But when Drake passed
13153,BOOK IV,From out the strait to take his Northward way
13154,BOOK IV,"Up the Pacific coast, a great head-wind"
13155,BOOK IV,Suddenly smote them; and the heaving seas
13156,BOOK IV,"Bulged all around them into billowy hills,"
13157,BOOK IV,"Dark rolling mountains, whose majestic crests"
13158,BOOK IV,Like wild white flames far-blown and savagely flickering
13159,BOOK IV,Swept through the clouds; and on their sullen slopes
13160,BOOK IV,"Like wind-whipt withered leaves those little ships,"
13161,BOOK IV,Now hurtled to the Zenith and now plunged
13162,BOOK IV,"Down into bottomless gulfs, were suddenly scattered"
13163,BOOK IV,"And whirled away. Drake, on the _Golden Hynde_,"
13164,BOOK IV,"One moment saw them near him, soaring up"
13165,BOOK IV,Above him on the huge o'erhanging billows
13166,BOOK IV,"As if to crash down on his poop; the next,"
13167,BOOK IV,A mile of howling sea had swept between
13168,BOOK IV,"Each of those wind-whipt straws, and they were gone"
13169,BOOK IV,"Through roaring deserts of embattled death,"
13170,BOOK IV,"Where, like a hundred thousand chariots charged"
13171,BOOK IV,"With lightnings and with thunders, one great wave"
13172,BOOK IV,Leading the unleashed ocean down the storm
13173,BOOK IV,Hurled them away to Southward.
13174,BOOK IV,
13175,BOOK IV,One last glimpse
13176,BOOK IV,"Drake caught o' the _Marygold_, when some mighty vortex"
13177,BOOK IV,Wide as the circle of the wide sea-line
13178,BOOK IV,Swept them together again. He saw her staggering
13179,BOOK IV,With mast snapt short and wreckage-tangled deck
13180,BOOK IV,Where men like insects clung. He saw the waves
13181,BOOK IV,"Leap over her mangled hulk, like wild white wolves,"
13182,BOOK IV,Volleying out of the clouds down dismal steeps
13183,BOOK IV,Of green-black water. Like a wounded steed
13184,BOOK IV,"Quivering upon its haunches, up she heaved"
13185,BOOK IV,"Her head to throw them off. Then, in one mass"
13186,BOOK IV,"Of fury crashed the great deep over her,"
13187,BOOK IV,"Trampling her down, down into the nethermost pit,"
13188,BOOK IV,"As with a madman's wrath. She rose no more,"
13189,BOOK IV,And in the stream of the ocean's hurricane laughter
13190,BOOK IV,"The _Golden Hynde_ went hurtling to the South,"
13191,BOOK IV,With sails rent into ribbons and her mast
13192,BOOK IV,"Snapt like a twig. Yea, where Magellan thought"
13193,BOOK IV,"Firm land had been, the little _Golden Hynde_"
13194,BOOK IV,Whirled like an autumn leaf through league on league
13195,BOOK IV,"Of bursting seas, chaos on crashing chaos,"
13196,BOOK IV,A rolling wilderness of charging Alps
13197,BOOK IV,That shook the world with their tremendous war;
13198,BOOK IV,"Grim beetling cliffs that grappled with clamorous gulfs,"
13199,BOOK IV,Valleys that yawned to swallow the wide heaven;
13200,BOOK IV,"Immense white-flowering fluctuant precipices,"
13201,BOOK IV,And hills that swooped down at the throat of hell;
13202,BOOK IV,"From Pole to Pole, one blanching bursting storm"
13203,BOOK IV,"Of world-wide oceans, where the huge Pacific"
13204,BOOK IV,Roared greetings to the Atlantic and both swept
13205,BOOK IV,"In broad white cataracts, league on struggling league,"
13206,BOOK IV,"Pursuing and pursued, immeasurable,"
13207,BOOK IV,With Titan hands grasping the rent black sky
13208,BOOK IV,"East, West, North, South. Then, then was battle indeed"
13209,BOOK IV,Of midget men upon that wisp of grass
13210,BOOK IV,"The _Golden Hynde_, who, as her masts crashed, hung"
13211,BOOK IV,Clearing the tiny wreckage from small decks
13212,BOOK IV,With ant-like weapons. Not their captain's voice
13213,BOOK IV,Availed them now amidst the deafening thunder
13214,BOOK IV,"Of seas that felt the heavy hand of God,"
13215,BOOK IV,Only they saw across the blinding spume
13216,BOOK IV,"In steely flashes, grand and grim, a face,"
13217,BOOK IV,"Like the last glimmer of faith among mankind,"
13218,BOOK IV,"Calm in this warring universe, where Drake"
13219,BOOK IV,"Stood, lashed to his post, beside the helm. Black seas"
13220,BOOK IV,Buffeted him. Half-stunned he dashed away
13221,BOOK IV,The sharp brine from his eagle eyes and turned
13222,BOOK IV,To watch some mountain-range come rushing down
13223,BOOK IV,"As if to o'erwhelm them utterly. Once, indeed,"
13224,BOOK IV,"Welkin and sea were one black wave, white-fanged,"
13225,BOOK IV,"White-crested, and up-heaped so mightily"
13226,BOOK IV,"That, though it coursed more swiftly than a herd"
13227,BOOK IV,Of Titan steeds upon some terrible plain
13228,BOOK IV,"Nigh the huge City of Ombos, yet it seemed"
13229,BOOK IV,"Most strangely slow, with all those crumbling crests"
13230,BOOK IV,"Each like a cataract on a mountain-side,"
13231,BOOK IV,And moved with the steady majesty of doom
13232,BOOK IV,"High over him. One moment's flash of fear,"
13233,BOOK IV,"And yet not fear, but rather life's regret,"
13234,BOOK IV,"Felt Drake, then laughed a low deep laugh of joy"
13235,BOOK IV,"Such as men taste in battle; yea, 'twas good"
13236,BOOK IV,"To grapple thus with death; one low deep laugh,"
13237,BOOK IV,"One mutter as of a lion about to spring,"
13238,BOOK IV,Then burst that thunder o'er him. Height o'er height
13239,BOOK IV,"The heavens rolled down, and waves were all the world."
13240,BOOK IV,
13241,BOOK IV,"Meanwhile, in England, dreaming of her sailor,"
13242,BOOK IV,"Far off, his heart's bride waited, of a proud"
13243,BOOK IV,And stubborn house the bright and gracious flower.
13244,BOOK IV,Whom oft her father urged with scanty grace
13245,BOOK IV,That Drake was dead and she had best forget
13246,BOOK IV,"The fellow, he grunted. For her father's heart"
13247,BOOK IV,"Was fettered with small memories, mocked by all"
13248,BOOK IV,The greater world's traditions and the trace
13249,BOOK IV,"Of earth's low pedigree among the suns,"
13250,BOOK IV,"Ringed with the terrible twilight of the Gods,"
13251,BOOK IV,"Ringed with the blood-red dusk of dying nations,"
13252,BOOK IV,"His faith was in his grandam's mighty skirt,"
13253,BOOK IV,"And, in that awful consciousness of power,"
13254,BOOK IV,Had it not been that even in this he feared
13255,BOOK IV,To sully her silken flounce or farthingale
13256,BOOK IV,"Wi' the white dust on his hands, he would have chalked"
13257,BOOK IV,"To his own shame, thinking it shame, the word"
13258,BOOK IV,Nearest to God in its divine embrace
13259,BOOK IV,"Of agonies and glories, the dread word"
13260,BOOK IV,_Demos_ across that door in Nazareth
13261,BOOK IV,Whence came the prentice carpenter whose voice
13262,BOOK IV,"Hath shaken kingdoms down, whose menial gibbet"
13263,BOOK IV,Rises triumphant o'er the wreck of Empires
13264,BOOK IV,And stretches out its arms amongst the Stars.
13265,BOOK IV,"But she, his daughter, only let her heart"
13266,BOOK IV,"Loveably forge a charter for her love,"
13267,BOOK IV,Cheat her false creed with faithful faery dreams
13268,BOOK IV,"That wrapt her love in mystery; thought, perchance,"
13269,BOOK IV,He came of some unhappy noble race
13270,BOOK IV,Ruined in battle for some lost high cause.
13271,BOOK IV,"And, in the general mixture of men's blood,"
13272,BOOK IV,Her dream was truer than his whose bloodless pride
13273,BOOK IV,Urged her to wed the chinless moon-struck fool
13274,BOOK IV,Sprung from five hundred years of idiocy
13275,BOOK IV,Who now besought her hand; would force her bear
13276,BOOK IV,"Some heir to a calf's tongue and a coronet,"
13277,BOOK IV,Whose cherished taints of blood will please his friends
13278,BOOK IV,"With ""Yea, Sir William's first-born hath the freak,"
13279,BOOK IV,"The family freak, being embryonic. Yea,"
13280,BOOK IV,"And with a fine half-wittedness, forsooth."
13281,BOOK IV,"Praise God, our children's children yet shall see"
13282,BOOK IV,The lord o' the manor muttering to himself
13283,BOOK IV,"At midnight by the gryphon-guarded gates,"
13284,BOOK IV,"Or gnawing his nails in desolate corridors,"
13285,BOOK IV,"Or pacing moonlit halls, dagger in hand,"
13286,BOOK IV,"Waiting to stab his father's pitiless ghost."""
13287,BOOK IV,"So she--the girl--Sweet Bess of Sydenham,"
13288,BOOK IV,"Most innocently proud, was prouder yet"
13289,BOOK IV,Than thus to let her heart stoop to the lure
13290,BOOK IV,"Of lording lovers, though her unstained soul"
13291,BOOK IV,Slumbered amidst those dreams as in old tales
13292,BOOK IV,The princess in the enchanted forest sleeps
13293,BOOK IV,Till the prince wakes her with a kiss and draws
13294,BOOK IV,The far-flung hues o' the gleaming magic web
13295,BOOK IV,"Into one heart of flame. And now, for Drake,"
13296,BOOK IV,She slept like Brynhild in a ring of fire
13297,BOOK IV,Which he must pass to win her. For the wrath
13298,BOOK IV,"Of Spain now flamed, awaiting his return,"
13299,BOOK IV,All round the seas of home; and even the Queen
13300,BOOK IV,"Elizabeth flinched, as that tremendous Power"
13301,BOOK IV,"Menaced the heart of England, flinched and vowed"
13302,BOOK IV,"Drake's head to Spain's ambassadors, though still"
13303,BOOK IV,By subtlety she hoped to find some way
13304,BOOK IV,Later to save or warn him ere he came.
13305,BOOK IV,"Perchance too, nay, most like, he will be slain"
13306,BOOK IV,"Or even now lies dead, out in the West,"
13307,BOOK IV,"She thought, and then the promise works no harm."
13308,BOOK IV,"But, day by day, there came as on the wings"
13309,BOOK IV,"Of startled winds from o'er the Spanish Main,"
13310,BOOK IV,Strange echoes as of sacked and clamouring ports
13311,BOOK IV,"And battered gates of fabulous golden cities,"
13312,BOOK IV,"A murmur out of the sunset of Peru,"
13313,BOOK IV,A sea-bird's wail from Lima. While no less
13314,BOOK IV,The wrathful menace gathered up its might
13315,BOOK IV,All round our little isle; till now the King
13316,BOOK IV,Philip of Spain half secretly decreed
13317,BOOK IV,The building of huge docks from which to launch
13318,BOOK IV,A Fleet Invincible that should sweep the seas
13319,BOOK IV,"Of all the world, throttle with one broad grasp"
13320,BOOK IV,"All Protestant rebellion, having stablished"
13321,BOOK IV,"His red feet in the Netherlands, thence to hurl"
13322,BOOK IV,"His whole World-Empire at this little isle,"
13323,BOOK IV,"England, our mother, home and hope and love,"
13324,BOOK IV,And bend her neck beneath his yoke. For now
13325,BOOK IV,"No half surrender sought he. At his back,"
13326,BOOK IV,"Robed with the scarlet of a thousand martyrs,"
13327,BOOK IV,"Admonishing him, stood Rome, and, in her hand,"
13328,BOOK IV,"Grasping the Cross of Christ by its great hilt,"
13329,BOOK IV,"She pointed it, like a dagger, tow'rds the throat"
13330,BOOK IV,Of England.
13331,BOOK IV,
13332,BOOK IV,"One long year, two years had passed"
13333,BOOK IV,Since Drake set sail from grey old Plymouth Sound;
13334,BOOK IV,And in those woods of faery wonder still
13335,BOOK IV,Slumbered his love in steadfast faith. But now
13336,BOOK IV,"With louder lungs her father urged--""He is dead:"
13337,BOOK IV,"Forget him. There is one that loves you, seeks"
13338,BOOK IV,"Your hand in marriage, and he is a goodly match"
13339,BOOK IV,"E'en for my daughter. You shall wed him, Bess!"""
13340,BOOK IV,"But when the new-found lover came to woo,"
13341,BOOK IV,"Glancing in summer silks and radiant hose,"
13342,BOOK IV,"Whipt doublet and enormous pointed shoon,"
13343,BOOK IV,She played him like a fish and sent him home
13344,BOOK IV,"Spluttering with dismay, a stickleback"
13345,BOOK IV,"Discoloured, a male minnow of dimpled streams"
13346,BOOK IV,"With all his rainbows paling in the prime,"
13347,BOOK IV,"To hide amongst his lilies, while once more"
13348,BOOK IV,She took her casement seat that overlooked
13349,BOOK IV,"The sea and read in Master Spenser's book,"
13350,BOOK IV,"Which Francis gave ""To my dear lady and queen"
13351,BOOK IV,"Bess,"" that most rare processional of love--"
13352,BOOK IV,"""_Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song!_"""
13353,BOOK IV,"Yet did her father urge her day by day,"
13354,BOOK IV,And day by day her mother dinned her ears
13355,BOOK IV,"With petty saws, as--""When _I_ was a girl,"""
13356,BOOK IV,"And ""I remember what _my_ father said,"""
13357,BOOK IV,"And ""Love, oh feather-fancies plucked from geese"
13358,BOOK IV,"You call your poets!"" Yet she hardly meant"
13359,BOOK IV,"To slight true love, save in her daughter's heart;"
13360,BOOK IV,For the old folk ever find it hard to see
13361,BOOK IV,"The passion of their children. When it wakes,"
13362,BOOK IV,The child becomes a stranger. So with Bess;
13363,BOOK IV,"But since her soul still slumbered, and the moons"
13364,BOOK IV,Rolled on and blurred her soul's particular love
13365,BOOK IV,"With the vague unknown impulse of her youth,"
13366,BOOK IV,Her brave resistance often melted now
13367,BOOK IV,"In tears, and her will weakened day by day;"
13368,BOOK IV,"Till on a dreadful summer morn there came,"
13369,BOOK IV,"Borne by a wintry flaw, home to the Thames,"
13370,BOOK IV,"A bruised and battered ship, all that was left,"
13371,BOOK IV,"So said her crew, of Drake's ill-fated fleet."
13372,BOOK IV,"John Wynter, her commander, told the tale"
13373,BOOK IV,Of how the _Golden Hynde_ and _Marygold_
13374,BOOK IV,Had by the wind Euroclydon been driven
13375,BOOK IV,Sheer o'er the howling edges of the world;
13376,BOOK IV,Of how himself by God's good providence
13377,BOOK IV,Was hurled into the strait Magellanus;
13378,BOOK IV,Of how on the horrible frontiers of the Void
13379,BOOK IV,"He had watched in vain, lit red with beacon-fires"
13380,BOOK IV,"The desperate coasts o' the black abyss, whence none"
13381,BOOK IV,"Ever returned, though many a week he watched"
13382,BOOK IV,Beneath the Cross; and only saw God's wrath
13383,BOOK IV,"Burn through the heavens and devastate the mountains,"
13384,BOOK IV,And hurl unheard of oceans roaring down
13385,BOOK IV,After the lost ships in one cataract
13386,BOOK IV,Of thunder and splendour and fury and rolling doom.
13387,BOOK IV,
13388,BOOK IV,"Then, with a bitter triumph in his face,"
13389,BOOK IV,As if this were the natural end of all
13390,BOOK IV,"Such vile plebeians, as if he had foreseen it,"
13391,BOOK IV,As if himself had breathed a tactful hint
13392,BOOK IV,"Into the aristocratic ears of God,"
13393,BOOK IV,"Her father broke the last frail barriers down,"
13394,BOOK IV,"Broke the poor listless will o' the lonely girl,"
13395,BOOK IV,Who careless now of aught but misery
13396,BOOK IV,Promised to wed their lordling. Mighty speed
13397,BOOK IV,They made to press that loveless marriage on;
13398,BOOK IV,And ere the May had mellowed into June
13399,BOOK IV,Her marriage eve had come. Her cold hands held
13400,BOOK IV,"Drake's gift. She scarce could see her name, writ broad"
13401,BOOK IV,"By that strong hand as it was, _To my queen Bess_."
13402,BOOK IV,"She looked out through her casement o'er the sea,"
13403,BOOK IV,"Listening its old enchanted moan, which seemed"
13404,BOOK IV,"Striving to speak, she knew not what. Its breath"
13405,BOOK IV,"Fluttered the roses round the grey old walls,"
13406,BOOK IV,And shook the ghostly jasmine. A great moon
13407,BOOK IV,Hung like a red lamp in the sycamore.
13408,BOOK IV,A corn-crake in the hay-fields far away
13409,BOOK IV,"Chirped like a cricket, and the night-jar churred"
13410,BOOK IV,His passionate love-song. Soft-winged moths besieged
13411,BOOK IV,Her lantern. Under many a star-stabbed elm
13412,BOOK IV,"The nightingale began his golden song,"
13413,BOOK IV,Whose warm thick notes are each a drop of blood
13414,BOOK IV,From that small throbbing breast against the thorn
13415,BOOK IV,Pressed close to turn the white rose into red;
13416,BOOK IV,Even as her lawn-clad may-white bosom pressed
13417,BOOK IV,"Quivering against the bars, while her dark hair"
13418,BOOK IV,Streamed round her shoulders and her small bare feet
13419,BOOK IV,Gleamed in the dusk. Then spake she to her maid--
13420,BOOK IV,"""I cannot sleep, I cannot sleep to-night."
13421,BOOK IV,"Bring thy lute hither and sing. Alison, think you"
13422,BOOK IV,The dead can watch us from their distant world?
13423,BOOK IV,Can our dead friends be near us when we weep?
13424,BOOK IV,"I wish 'twere so! for then my love would come,"
13425,BOOK IV,"No matter then how far, my love would come,"
13426,BOOK IV,"And he'd forgive me."""
13427,BOOK IV,
13428,BOOK IV,Then Bess bowed down her lovely head: her breast
13429,BOOK IV,"Heaved with short sobs, sickening at the heart,"
13430,BOOK IV,"She grasped the casement moaning, ""Love, Love, Love,"
13431,BOOK IV,"Come quickly, come, before it is too late,"
13432,BOOK IV,"Come quickly, oh come quickly."""
13433,BOOK IV,Then her maid
13434,BOOK IV,Slipped a soft arm around her and gently drew
13435,BOOK IV,"The supple quivering body, shaken with sobs,"
13436,BOOK IV,"And all that firm young, sweetness to her breast,"
13437,BOOK IV,"And led her to her couch, and all night long"
13438,BOOK IV,"She watched beside her, till the marriage morn"
13439,BOOK IV,Blushed in the heartless East. Then swiftly flew
13440,BOOK IV,"The pitiless moments, till--as in a dream--"
13441,BOOK IV,"And borne along by dreams, or like a lily"
13442,BOOK IV,Cut from its anchorage in the stream to glide
13443,BOOK IV,Down the smooth bosom of an unknown world
13444,BOOK IV,"Through fields of unknown blossom, so moved Bess"
13445,BOOK IV,"Amongst her maids, as the procession passed"
13446,BOOK IV,"Forth to the little church upon the cliffs,"
13447,BOOK IV,"And, as in those days was the bridal mode,"
13448,BOOK IV,Her lustrous hair in billowing beauty streamed
13449,BOOK IV,"Dishevelled o'er her shoulders, while the sun"
13450,BOOK IV,"Caressed her bent and glossy head, and shone"
13451,BOOK IV,"Over the deep blue, white-flaked, wrinkled sea,"
13452,BOOK IV,On full-blown rosy-petalled sails that flashed
13453,BOOK IV,Like flying blossoms fallen from her crown.

13469,II,"_If we go as we came, by the Southward, we meet wi' the fleets of Spain!"
13470,II,'Tis a thousand to one against us: we'll turn to the West again!
13471,II,"We have captured a China pilot, his charts and his golden keys:"
13472,II,"We'll sail to the golden Gateway, over the golden seas._"
13473,II,
13474,II,Over the immeasurable molten gold
13475,II,"Wrapped in a golden haze, onward they drew;"
13476,II,And now they saw the tiny purple quay
13477,II,Grow larger and darker and brighten into brown
13478,II,Across the swelling sparkle of the waves.
13479,II,"Brown on the quay, a train of tethered mules"
13480,II,"Munched at the nose-bags, while a Spaniard drowsed"
13481,II,On guard beside what seemed at first a heap
13482,II,"Of fish, then slowly turned to silver bars"
13483,II,Up-piled and glistering in the enchanted sun.
13484,II,"Nor did that sentry wake as, like a dream,"
13485,II,The _Golden Hynde_ divided the soft sleep
13486,II,"Of warm green lapping water, sidled up,"
13487,II,"Sank sail, and moored beside the quay. But Drake,"
13488,II,"Lightly leaping ashore and stealing nigh,"
13489,II,Picked up the Spaniard's long gay-ribboned gun
13490,II,"Close to his ear. At once, without a sound,"
13491,II,The watchman opened his dark eyes and stared
13492,II,"As at strange men who suddenly had come,"
13493,II,"Borne by some magic carpet, from the stars;"
13494,II,"Then, with a courtly bow, his right hand thrust"
13495,II,Within the lace embroideries of his breast.
13496,II,"Politely Drake, with pained apologies"
13497,II,For this disturbance of a cavalier
13498,II,"Napping on guard, straightway resolved to make"
13499,II,"Complete amends, by now relieving him"
13500,II,Of these--which doubtless troubled his repose--
13501,II,These anxious bars of silver. With that word
13502,II,"Two seamen leaped ashore and, gathering up"
13503,II,"The bars in a stout old patch of tawny sail,"
13504,II,Slung them aboard. No sooner this was done
13505,II,"Than out o' the valley, like a foolish jest"
13506,II,"Out of the mouth of some great John-a-dreams,"
13507,II,In soft procession of buffoonery
13508,II,A woolly train of llamas proudly came
13509,II,"Stepping by two and two along the quay,"
13510,II,Laden with pack on pack of silver bars
13511,II,And driven by a Spaniard. His amaze
13512,II,The seamen greeted with profuser thanks
13513,II,For his most punctual thought and opportune
13514,II,Courtesy. None the less they must avouch
13515,II,It pained them much to see a cavalier
13516,II,"Turned carrier; and, at once, they must insist"
13517,II,On easing him of that too sordid care.
13518,II,
13519,II,*   *   *   *
13520,II,
13521,II,Then out from Tarapaca once again
13522,II,"They sailed, their hold a glimmering mine of wealth,"
13523,II,"Towards Arica and Lima, where they deemed"
13524,II,The prize of prizes waited unaware.
13525,II,For every year a gorgeous galleon sailed
13526,II,With all the harvest of Potosi's mines
13527,II,"And precious stones from dead king's diadems,"
13528,II,"Aztecs' and Incas' gem-encrusted crowns,"
13529,II,"Pearls from the glimmering Temples of the Moon,"
13530,II,"Rich opals with their milky rainbow-clouds,"
13531,II,"White diamonds from the Temples of the Sun,"
13532,II,"Carbuncles flaming scarlet, amethysts,"
13533,II,"Rubies, and sapphires; these to Spain she brought"
13534,II,To glut her priestly coffers. Now not far
13535,II,"Ahead they deemed she lay upon that coast,"
13536,II,"Crammed with the lustrous Indies, wrung with threat"
13537,II,And torture from the naked Indian slaves.
13538,II,To him that spied her top-sails first a prize
13539,II,Drake offered of the wondrous chain he wore;
13540,II,"And every seaman, every ship-boy, watched"
13541,II,"Not only for the prize, but for their friends,"
13542,II,If haply these had weathered through the storm.
13543,II,"Nor did they know their friends had homeward turned,"
13544,II,"Bearing to England and to England's Queen,"
13545,II,"And his heart's queen, the tale that Drake was dead."
13546,II,
13547,II,"Northward they cruised along a warm, wild coast"
13548,II,That like a most luxurious goddess drowsed
13549,II,"Supine to heaven, her arms behind her head,"
13550,II,"One knee up-thrust to make a mountain-peak,"
13551,II,Her rosy breasts up-heaving their soft snow
13552,II,"In distant Andes, and her naked side"
13553,II,With one rich curve for half a hundred leagues
13554,II,Bathed by the creaming foam; her heavy hair
13555,II,Fraught with the perfume of a thousand forests
13556,II,Tossed round about her beauty: and her mouth
13557,II,A scarlet mystery of distant flower
13558,II,Up-turned to take the kisses of the sun.
13559,II,But like a troop of boys let loose from school
13560,II,"The adventurers went by, startling the stillness"
13561,II,Of that voluptuous dream-encumbered shore
13562,II,With echoing shouts of laughter and alien song.
13563,II,
13564,II,"But as they came to Arica, from afar"
13565,II,"They heard the clash of bells upon the breeze,"
13566,II,And knew that Rumour with her thousand wings
13567,II,Had rushed before them. Horsemen in the night
13568,II,Had galloped through the white coast-villages
13569,II,"And spread the dreadful cry ""El Draque!"" abroad,"
13570,II,And when the gay adventurers drew nigh
13571,II,"They found the quays deserted, and the ships"
13572,II,"All flown, except one little fishing-boat"
13573,II,Wherein an old man like a tortoise moved
13574,II,A wrinkled head above the rusty net
13575,II,His crawling hands repaired. He seemed to dwell
13576,II,"Outside the world of war and peace, outside"
13577,II,"Everything save his daily task, and cared"
13578,II,No whit who else might win or lose; for all
13579,II,The pilot asked of him without demur
13580,II,"He answered, scarcely looking from his work."
13581,II,A galleon laden with eight hundred bars
13582,II,"Of silver, not three hours ago had flown"
13583,II,"Northward, he muttered. Ere the words were out,"
13584,II,The will of Drake thrilled through the _Golden Hynde_
13585,II,"Like one sharp trumpet-call, and ere they knew"
13586,II,"What power impelled them, crowding on all sail"
13587,II,"Northward they surged, and roaring down the wind"
13588,II,"At Chiuli, port of Arequipa, saw"
13589,II,The chase at anchor. Wondering they came
13590,II,With all the gunners waiting at their guns
13591,II,"Bare-armed and silent--nearer, nearer yet,--"
13592,II,Close to the enemy. But no sight or sound
13593,II,Of living creature stirred upon her decks.
13594,II,Only a great grey cat lay in the sun
13595,II,Upon a warm smooth cannon-butt. A chill
13596,II,Ran through the veins of even the boldest there
13597,II,At that too peaceful silence. Cautiously
13598,II,"Drake neared her in his pinnace: cautiously,"
13599,II,"Cutlass in hand, up that mysterious hull"
13600,II,"He clomb, and wondered, as he climbed, to breathe"
13601,II,The friendly smell o' the pitch and hear the waves
13602,II,With their incessant old familiar sound
13603,II,Crackling and slapping against her windward flank.
13604,II,A ship of dreams was that; for when they reached
13605,II,"The silent deck, they saw no crouching forms,"
13606,II,They heard no sound of life. Only the hot
13607,II,Creak of the cordage whispered in the sun.
13608,II,"The cat stood up and yawned, and slunk away"
13609,II,"Slowly, with furtive glances. The great hold"
13610,II,"Was empty, and the rich cabin stripped and bare."
13611,II,Suddenly one of the seamen with a cry
13612,II,"Pointed where, close inshore, a little boat"
13613,II,"Stole towards the town; and, with a louder cry,"
13614,II,Drake bade his men aboard the _Golden Hynde_.
13615,II,Scarce had they pulled two hundred yards away
13616,II,"When, with a roar that seemed to buffet the heavens"
13617,II,"And rip the heart of the sea out, one red flame"
13618,II,"Blackened with fragments, the great galleon burst"
13619,II,Asunder! All the startled waves were strewn
13620,II,With wreckage; and Drake laughed--
13621,II,"""My lads, we have diced"
13622,II,"With death to-day, and won! My merry lads,"
13623,II,It seems that Spain is bolting with the stakes!
13624,II,"Now, if I have to stretch the skies for sails"
13625,II,And summon the blasts of God up from the South
13626,II,"To fill my canvas, I will overhaul"
13627,II,Those dusky devils with the treasure-ship
13628,II,"That holds our hard-earned booty. Pull hard all,"
13629,II,"Hard for the _Golden Hynde_."""
13630,II,
13631,II,*   *   *   *
13632,II,
13633,II,And so they came
13634,II,At dead of night on Callao de Lima!
13635,II,They saw the harbour lights across the waves
13636,II,"Glittering, and the shadowy hulks of ships"
13637,II,Gathered together like a flock of sheep
13638,II,Within the port. With shouts and clink of chains
13639,II,"A shadowy ship was entering from the North,"
13640,II,And like the shadow of that shadow slipped
13641,II,The _Golden Hynde_ beside her thro' the gloom;
13642,II,And side by side they anchored in the port
13643,II,Amidst the shipping! Over the dark tide
13644,II,A small boat from the customs-house drew near.
13645,II,"A sleepy, yawning, gold-laced officer"
13646,II,"Boarded the _Golden Hynde_, and with a cry,"
13647,II,"Stumbling against a cannon-butt, he saw"
13648,II,The bare-armed British seamen in the gloom
13649,II,All waiting by their guns. Wildly he plunged
13650,II,"Over the side and urged his boat away,"
13651,II,"Crying, ""El Draque! El Draque!"" At that dread word"
13652,II,"The darkness filled with clamour, and the ships,"
13653,II,"Cutting their cables, drifted here and there"
13654,II,In mad attempts to seek the open sea.
13655,II,"Wild lights burnt hither and thither, and all the port,"
13656,II,"One furnace of confusion, heaved and seethed"
13657,II,"In terror; for each shadow of the night,"
13658,II,"Nay, the great night itself, was all _El Draque_."
13659,II,"The Dragon's wings were spread from quay to quay,"
13660,II,The very lights that burnt from mast to mast
13661,II,And flared across the tide kindled his breath
13662,II,To fire; while here and there a British pinnace
13663,II,"Slipped softly thro' the roaring gloom and glare,"
13664,II,Ransacking ship by ship; for each one thought
13665,II,A fleet had come upon them. Each gave up
13666,II,"The struggle as each was boarded; while, elsewhere,"
13667,II,"Cannon to cannon, friends bombarded friends."
13668,II,
13669,II,Yet not one ounce of treasure in Callao
13670,II,"They found; for, fourteen days before they came,"
13671,II,"That greatest treasure-ship of Spain, with all"
13672,II,"The gorgeous harvest of that year, had sailed"
13673,II,For Panama: her ballast--silver bars;
13674,II,"Her cargo--rubies, emeralds, and gold."
13675,II,
13676,II,"Out through the clamour and the darkness, out,"
13677,II,"Out to the harbour mouth, the _Golden Hynde_,"
13678,II,"Steered by the iron soul of Drake, returned:"
13679,II,"And where the way was blocked, her cannon clove"
13680,II,A crimson highway to the midnight sea.
13681,II,"Then Northward, Northward, o'er the jewelled main,"
13682,II,Under the white moon like a storm they drove
13683,II,In quest of the _Cacafuego_. Fourteen days
13684,II,"Her start was; and at dawn the fair wind sank,"
13685,II,"And chafing lay the _Golden Hynde_, becalmed;"
13686,II,"While, on the hills, the Viceroy of Peru"
13687,II,"Marched down from Lima with two thousand men,"
13688,II,And sent out four huge ships of war to sink
13689,II,Or capture the fierce Dragon. Loud laughed Drake
13690,II,"To see them creeping nigh, urged with great oars,"
13691,II,Then suddenly pause; for none would be the first
13692,II,"To close with him. And, ere they had steeled their hearts"
13693,II,"To battle, a fair breeze broke out anew,"
13694,II,And Northward sped the little _Golden Hynde_
13695,II,In quest of the lordliest treasure-ship of Spain.
13696,II,
13697,II,*   *   *   *
13698,II,
13699,II,Behind her lay a world in arms; for now
13700,II,Wrath and confusion clamoured for revenge
13701,II,From sea to sea. Spain claimed the pirate's head
13702,II,"From England, and awaited his return"
13703,II,With all her tortures. And where'er he passed
13704,II,"He sowed the dragon's teeth, and everywhere"
13705,II,Cadmean broods of armèd men arose
13706,II,"And followed, followed on his fiery trail."
13707,II,Men toiled at Lima to fit out a fleet
13708,II,Grim enough to destroy him. All night long
13709,II,The flare went up from cities on the coast
13710,II,Where men like naked devils toiled to cast
13711,II,Cannon that might have overwhelmed the powers
13712,II,Of Michael when he drave that hideous rout
13713,II,Through livid chaos to the black abyss.
13714,II,Small hope indeed there seemed of safe return;
13715,II,"But Northward sped the little _Golden Hynde_,"
13716,II,"The world-watched midget ship of eighteen guns,"
13717,II,Undaunted; and upon the second dawn
13718,II,"Sighted a galleon, not indeed the chase,"
13719,II,Yet worth a pause; for out of her they took--
13720,II,Embossed with emeralds large as pigeon's eggs--
13721,II,"A golden crucifix, with eighty pounds"
13722,II,In weight of gold. The rest they left behind;
13723,II,"And onward, onward, to the North they flew--"
13724,II,"A score of golden miles, a score of green,"
13725,II,"An hundred miles, eight hundred miles of foam,"
13726,II,"Rainbows and fire, ransacking as they went"
13727,II,Ship after ship for news o' the chase and gold;
13728,II,Learning from every capture that they drew
13729,II,"Nearer and nearer. At Truxillo, dim"
13730,II,"And dreaming city, a-drowse with purple flowers,"
13731,II,"She had paused, ay, paused to take a freight of gold!"
13732,II,"At Paita--she had passed two days in front,"
13733,II,"Only two days, two days ahead; nay, one!"
13734,II,"At Quito, close inshore, a youthful page,"
13735,II,"Bright-eyed, ran up the rigging and cried, ""A sail!"
13736,II,A sail! The _Cacafuego_! And the chain
13737,II,"Is mine!"" And by the strange cut of her sails,"
13738,II,"Whereof they had been told in Callao,"
13739,II,They knew her!
13740,II,"Heavily laden with her gems,"
13741,II,"Lazily drifting with her golden fruitage,"
13742,II,Over the magic seas they saw her hull
13743,II,"Loom as they onward drew; but Drake, for fear"
13744,II,"The prey might take alarm and run ashore,"
13745,II,"Trailed wine-skins, filled with water, over the side"
13746,II,"To hold his ship back, till the darkness fell,"
13747,II,And with the night the off-shore wind arose.
13748,II,"At last the sun sank down, the rosy light"
13749,II,Faded from Andes' peaked and bosomed snow:
13750,II,The night-wind rose: the wine-skins were up-hauled;
13751,II,"And, like a hound unleashed, the _Golden Hynde_"
13752,II,Leapt forward thro' the gloom.
13753,II,A cable's length
13754,II,Divided them. The _Cacafuego_ heard
13755,II,A rough voice in the darkness bidding her
13756,II,_Heave to!_ She held her course. Drake gave the word.
13757,II,"A broadside shattered the night, and over her side"
13758,II,Her main-yard clattered like a broken wing!
13759,II,"On to her decks the British sea-dogs swarmed,"
13760,II,Cutlass in hand: that fight was at an end.
13761,II,
13762,II,"The ship was cleared, a prize crew placed a-board,"
13763,II,Then both ships turned their heads to the open sea.
13764,II,"At dawn, being out of sight of land, they 'gan"
13765,II,Examine the great prize. None ever knew
13766,II,Save Drake and Gloriana what wild wealth
13767,II,They had captured there. Thus much at least was known:
13768,II,"An hundredweight of gold, and twenty tons"
13769,II,Of silver bullion; thirteen chests of coins;
13770,II,"Nuggets of gold unnumbered; countless pearls,"
13771,II,"Diamonds, emeralds; but the worth of these"
13772,II,"Was past all reckoning. In the crimson dawn,"
13773,II,"Ringed with the lonely pomp of sea and sky,"
13774,II,The naked-footed seamen bathed knee-deep
13775,II,In gold and gathered up Aladdin's fruit--
13776,II,All-colored gems--and tossed them in the sun.
13777,II,The hold like one great elfin orchard gleamed
13778,II,"With dusky globes and tawny glories piled,"
13779,II,"Hesperian apples, heap on mellow heap,"
13780,II,"Rich with the hues of sunset, rich and ripe"
13781,II,And ready for the enchanted cider-press;
13782,II,An Emperor's ransom in each burning orb;
13783,II,A kingdom's purchase in each clustered bough;
13784,II,The freedom of all slaves in every chain.
13785,II,
13786,II,
13787,BOOK VI,BOOK VI
13788,BOOK VI,
13789,BOOK VI,Now like the soul of Ophir on the sea
13790,BOOK VI,"Glittered the _Golden Hynde_, and all her heart"
13791,BOOK VI,Turned home to England. As a child that finds
13792,BOOK VI,"A ruby ring upon the highway, straight"
13793,BOOK VI,"Homeward desires to run with it, so she"
13794,BOOK VI,Yearned for her home and country. Yet the world
13795,BOOK VI,Was all in arms behind her. Fleet on fleet
13796,BOOK VI,Awaited her return. Along the coast
13797,BOOK VI,The very churches melted down their chimes
13798,BOOK VI,And cast them into cannon. To the South
13799,BOOK VI,"A thousand cannon watched Magellan's straits,"
13800,BOOK VI,"And fleets were scouring all the sea like hounds,"
13801,BOOK VI,"With orders that where'er they came on Drake,"
13802,BOOK VI,"Although he were the Dragon of their dreams,"
13803,BOOK VI,"They should out-blast his thunders and convey,"
13804,BOOK VI,"Dead or alive, his body back to Spain."
13805,BOOK VI,
13806,BOOK VI,"And Drake laughed out and said, ""My trusty lads"
13807,BOOK VI,"Of Devon, you have made the wide world ring"
13808,BOOK VI,With England's name; you have swept one half the seas
13809,BOOK VI,From sky to sky; and in our oaken hold
13810,BOOK VI,You have packed the gorgeous Indies. We shall sail
13811,BOOK VI,"But slowly with such wealth. If we return,"
13812,BOOK VI,We are one against ten thousand! We will seek
13813,BOOK VI,"The fabled Northern passage, take our gold"
13814,BOOK VI,Safe home; then out to sea again and try
13815,BOOK VI,"Our guns against their guns."""
13816,BOOK VI,
13817,BOOK VI,*   *   *   *
13818,BOOK VI,
13819,BOOK VI,And as they sailed
13820,BOOK VI,"Northward, they swooped on warm blue Guatulco"
13821,BOOK VI,For food and water. Nigh the dreaming port
13822,BOOK VI,"The grand alcaldes in high conclave sat,"
13823,BOOK VI,"Blazing with gold and scarlet, as they tried"
13824,BOOK VI,A batch of negro slaves upon the charge
13825,BOOK VI,"Of idleness in Spanish mines; dumb slaves,"
13826,BOOK VI,"With bare scarred backs and labour-broken knees,"
13827,BOOK VI,And sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine
13828,BOOK VI,Spent from the ploughing. Even as the judge
13829,BOOK VI,Rose to condemn them to the knotted lash
13830,BOOK VI,"The British boat's crew, quiet and compact,"
13831,BOOK VI,Entered the court. The grim judicial glare
13832,BOOK VI,"Grew wider with amazement, and the judge"
13833,BOOK VI,Staggered against his gilded throne.
13834,BOOK VI,"""I thank"
13835,BOOK VI,"Almighty God,"" cried Drake, ""who hath given me this"
13836,BOOK VI,"--That I who once, in ignorance, procured"
13837,BOOK VI,"Slaves for the golden bawdy-house of Spain,"
13838,BOOK VI,"May now, in England's name, help to requite"
13839,BOOK VI,"That wrong. For now I say in England's name,"
13840,BOOK VI,"Where'er her standard flies, the slave shall stand"
13841,BOOK VI,"Upright, the shackles fall from off his limbs."
13842,BOOK VI,Unyoke the prisoners: tell them they are men
13843,BOOK VI,"Once more, not beasts of burden. Set them free;"
13844,BOOK VI,But take these gold and scarlet popinjays
13845,BOOK VI,Aboard my _Golden Hynde_; and let them write
13846,BOOK VI,An order that their town shall now provide
13847,BOOK VI,"My boats with food and water."""
13848,BOOK VI,"This being done,"
13849,BOOK VI,"The slaves being placed in safety on the prize,"
13850,BOOK VI,The _Golden Hynde_ revictualled and the casks
13851,BOOK VI,"Replenished with fresh water, Drake set free"
13852,BOOK VI,The judges and swept Northward once again;
13853,BOOK VI,"And, off the coast of Nicaragua, found"
13854,BOOK VI,A sudden treasure better than all gold;
13855,BOOK VI,For on the track of the China trade they caught
13856,BOOK VI,"A ship whereon two China pilots sailed,"
13857,BOOK VI,"And in their cabin lay the secret charts,"
13858,BOOK VI,"Red hieroglyphs of Empire, unknown charts"
13859,BOOK VI,Of silken sea-roads down the golden West
13860,BOOK VI,Where all roads meet and East and West are one.
13861,BOOK VI,"And, with that mystery stirring in their hearts"
13862,BOOK VI,"Like a strange cry from home, Northward they swept"
13863,BOOK VI,"And Northward, till the soft luxurious coasts"
13864,BOOK VI,"Hardened, the winds grew bleak, the great green waves"
13865,BOOK VI,"Loomed high like mountains round them, and the spray"
13866,BOOK VI,Froze on their spars and yards. Fresh from the warmth
13867,BOOK VI,Of tropic seas the men could hardly brook
13868,BOOK VI,That cold; and when the floating hills of ice
13869,BOOK VI,Like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow
13870,BOOK VI,"Went past them with strange whispers in the gloom,"
13871,BOOK VI,"Or took mysterious colours in the dawn,"
13872,BOOK VI,"Their hearts misgave them, and they found no way;"
13873,BOOK VI,But all was iron shore and icy sea.
13874,BOOK VI,And one by one the crew fell sick to death
13875,BOOK VI,"In that fierce winter, and the land still ran"
13876,BOOK VI,"Westward and showed no passage. Tossed with storms,"
13877,BOOK VI,"Onward they plunged, or furrowed gentler tides"
13878,BOOK VI,Of ice-lit emerald that made the prow
13879,BOOK VI,A faery beak of some enchanted ship
13880,BOOK VI,Flinging wild rainbows round her as she drove
13881,BOOK VI,"Thro' seas unsailed by mortal mariners,"
13882,BOOK VI,"Past isles unhailed of any human voice,"
13883,BOOK VI,Where sound and silence mingled in one song
13884,BOOK VI,Of utter solitude. Ever as they went
13885,BOOK VI,"The flag of England blazoned the broad breeze,"
13886,BOOK VI,"Northward, where never ship had sailed before,"
13887,BOOK VI,"Northward, till lost in helpless wonderment,"
13888,BOOK VI,Dazed as a soul awakening from the dream
13889,BOOK VI,Of death to some wild dawn in Paradise
13890,BOOK VI,(Yet burnt with cold as they whose very tears
13891,BOOK VI,Freeze on their faces where Cocytus wails)
13892,BOOK VI,"All world-worn, bruised, wing-broken, wracked, and wrenched,"
13893,BOOK VI,"Blackened with lightning, scarred as with evil deeds,"
13894,BOOK VI,But all embalmed in beauty by that sun
13895,BOOK VI,"Which never sets, bosomed in peace at last"
13896,BOOK VI,The _Golden Hynde_ rocked on a glittering calm.
13897,BOOK VI,"Seas that no ship had ever sailed, from sky"
13898,BOOK VI,"To glistening sky, swept round them. Glory and gleam,"
13899,BOOK VI,Glamour and lucid rapture and diamond air
13900,BOOK VI,"Embraced her broken spars, begrimed with gold"
13901,BOOK VI,"Her gloomy hull, rocking upon a sphere"
13902,BOOK VI,"New made, it seemed, mysterious with the first"
13903,BOOK VI,"Mystery of the world, where holy sky"
13904,BOOK VI,And sacred sea shone like the primal Light
13905,BOOK VI,"Of God, a-stir with whispering sea-bird's wings"
13906,BOOK VI,"And glorious with clouds. Only, all day,"
13907,BOOK VI,"All night, the rhythmic utterance of His will"
13908,BOOK VI,"In the deep sigh of seas that washed His throne,"
13909,BOOK VI,"Rose and relapsed across Eternity,"
13910,BOOK VI,Timed to the pulse of æons. All their world
13911,BOOK VI,Seemed strange as unto us the great new heavens
13912,BOOK VI,"And glittering shores, if on some aery bark"
13913,BOOK VI,To Saturn's coasts we came and traced no more
13914,BOOK VI,The tiny gleam of our familiar earth
13915,BOOK VI,"Far off, but heard tremendous oceans roll"
13916,BOOK VI,"Round unimagined continents, and saw"
13917,BOOK VI,Terrible mountains unto which our Alps
13918,BOOK VI,"Were less than mole-hills, and such gaunt ravines"
13919,BOOK VI,Cleaving them and such cataracts roaring down
13920,BOOK VI,"As burst the gates of our earth-moulded senses,"
13921,BOOK VI,"Pour the eternal glory on our souls,"
13922,BOOK VI,"And, while ten thousand chariots bring the dawn,"
13923,BOOK VI,Hurl us poor midgets trembling to our knees.
13924,BOOK VI,"Glory and glamour and rapture of lucid air,"
13925,BOOK VI,"Ice cold, with subtle colours of the sky"
13926,BOOK VI,"Embraced her broken spars, belted her hulk"
13927,BOOK VI,"With brilliance, while she dipped her jacinth beak"
13928,BOOK VI,"In waves of mounded splendour, and sometimes"
13929,BOOK VI,A great ice-mountain flashed and floated by
13930,BOOK VI,"Throned on the waters, pinnacled and crowned"
13931,BOOK VI,With all the smouldering jewels in the world;
13932,BOOK VI,"Or in the darkness, glimmering berg on berg,"
13933,BOOK VI,"All emerald to the moon, went by like ghosts"
13934,BOOK VI,Whispering to the South.
13935,BOOK VI,"There, as they lay,"
13936,BOOK VI,"Waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails,"
13937,BOOK VI,Their hearts remembered that in England now
13938,BOOK VI,"The Spring was nigh, and in that lonely sea"
13939,BOOK VI,The skilled musicians filled their eyes with home.

14070,VII,A lonely natural harbour on the coast
14071,VII,"Near San Francisco, where the cliffs were white"
14072,VII,"Like those of England, and the soft soil teemed"
14073,VII,With gold. There they careened the _Golden Hynde_--
14074,VII,Her keel being thick with barnacles and weeds--
14075,VII,And built a fort and dockyard to refit
14076,VII,"Their little wandering home, not half so large"
14077,VII,As many a coasting barque to-day that scarce
14078,VII,"Would cross the Channel, yet she had swept the seas"

14082,VII,"The stillness of that shore, shy figures came,"
14083,VII,"Keen-faced and grave-eyed Indians, from the woods"
14084,VII,To bow before the strange white-faced newcomers
14085,VII,As gods. Whereat the chaplain all aghast
14086,VII,Persuaded them with signs and broken words

14088,VII,Whom none the less the savages would crown
14089,VII,With woven flowers and barbarous ritual
14090,VII,King of New Albion--so the seamen called
14091,VII,"That land, remembering the white cliffs of home."
14092,VII,"Much they implored, with many a sign and cry,"
14093,VII,Which by the rescued slaves upon the prize
14094,VII,"Were part interpreted, that Drake would stay"
14095,VII,And rule them; and the vision of the great
14096,VII,Empire of Englishmen arose and flashed
14097,VII,"A moment round them, on that lonely shore."
14098,VII,"A small and weather-beaten band they stood,"
14099,VII,"Bronzed seamen by the laughing rescued slaves,"
14100,VII,Ringed with gigantic loneliness and saw
14101,VII,An Empire that should liberate the world;
14102,VII,A Power before the lightning of whose arms
14103,VII,Darkness should die and all oppression cease;
14104,VII,"A Federation of the strong and weak,"
14105,VII,Whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong
14106,VII,Made stronger in the increasing good of all;
14107,VII,A gathering up of one another's loads;
14108,VII,A turning of the wasteful rage of war
14109,VII,"To accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace,"
14110,VII,Even as the strength of some great stream is turned
14111,VII,To grind the corn for bread. E'en thus on England
14112,VII,That splendour dawned which those in dreams foresaw
14113,VII,"And saw not with their living eyes, but thou,"
14114,VII,"England, mayst lift up eyes at last and see,"
14115,VII,"Who, like that angel of the Apocalypse"
14116,VII,"Hast set one foot upon thy sea-girt isle,"
14117,VII,"The other upon the waters, and canst raise"

14128,VII,Like men that for one moment in their lives
14129,VII,Have seen a mighty drama cross their path
14130,VII,And played upon the stage of vast events
14131,VII,"Knowing, henceforward, all their life is nought."
14132,VII,But Westward sped the little _Golden Hynde_
14133,VII,"Across the uncharted ocean, with no guide"
14134,VII,But that great homing cry of all their hearts.
14135,VII,"Far out of sight of land they steered, straight out"
14136,VII,"Across the great Pacific, in those days"
14137,VII,"When even the compass proved no trusty guide,"
14138,VII,"Straight out they struck in that small bark, straight out"
14139,VII,"Week after week, without one glimpse of aught"
14140,VII,"But heaving seas, across the uncharted waste"
14141,VII,"Straight to the sunset. Laughingly they sailed,"
14142,VII,"With all that gorgeous booty in their holds,"
14143,VII,"A splendour dragging deep through seas of doom,"
14144,VII,A prey to the first great hurricane that blew
14145,VII,Except their God averted it. And still
14146,VII,Their skilled musicians cheered the way along
14147,VII,To shores beyond the sunset and the sea.
14148,VII,"And oft at nights, the yellow fo'c'sle lanthorn"
14149,VII,Swung over swarthy singing faces grouped
14150,VII,Within the four small wooden walls that made
14151,VII,Their home and shut them from the unfathomable
14152,VII,Depths of mysterious gloom without that rolled
14153,VII,All around them; or Tom Moone would heartily troll

14283,BOOK VII,"Tossing their caps, the _Golden Hynde_ is come!"
14284,BOOK VII,"Fisherman, citizen, prentice, dame and maid,"
14285,BOOK VII,"Fat justice, floury baker, bloated butcher,"
14286,BOOK VII,"Fishwife, minister and apothecary,"
14287,BOOK VII,"Yea, even the driver of the death-cart, leaving"
14288,BOOK VII,"His ghastly load, using his dreary bell"
14289,BOOK VII,"To merrier purpose, down the seething streets,"
14290,BOOK VII,"Panting, tumbling, jostling, helter-skelter"
14291,BOOK VII,"To the water-side, to the water-side they rushed,"
14292,BOOK VII,"And some knee-deep beyond it, all one wild"
14293,BOOK VII,Welcome to Francis Drake!
14294,BOOK VII,"Wild kerchiefs fluttering, thunderous hurrahs"
14295,BOOK VII,"Rolling from quay to quay, a thousand arms"
14296,BOOK VII,Outstretched to that grey ghostly little ship
14297,BOOK VII,At whose masthead the British flag still flew;
14298,BOOK VII,"Then, over all, in one tumultuous tide"
14299,BOOK VII,"Of pealing joy, the Plymouth bells outclashed"
14300,BOOK VII,A nation's welcome home to Francis Drake.
14301,BOOK VII,
14302,BOOK VII,"The very _Golden Hynde_, no idle dream,"
14303,BOOK VII,"The little ship that swept the Spanish Main,"
14304,BOOK VII,"Carelessly lying there, in Plymouth Sound,"
14305,BOOK VII,"The _Golden Hynde_, the wonder of the world,"
14306,BOOK VII,"A glory wrapt her greyness, and no boat"
14307,BOOK VII,"Dared yet approach, save one, with Drake's close friends,"
14308,BOOK VII,"Who came to warn him: ""England stands alone"
14309,BOOK VII,And Drake is made the price of England's peace.
14310,BOOK VII,"The Queen, perforce, must temporise with Spain,"
14311,BOOK VII,The Invincible! She hath forfeited thy life
14312,BOOK VII,"To Spain, against her will. Only by this"
14313,BOOK VII,Rejection of thee as a privateer
14314,BOOK VII,She averted instant war; for now the menace
14315,BOOK VII,"Of Spain draws nigher, looms darker every hour."
14316,BOOK VII,"The world is made Spain's footstool. Philip, the King,"
14317,BOOK VII,E'en now hath added to her boundless power
14318,BOOK VII,"Without a blow, the vast domains and wealth"
14319,BOOK VII,"Of Portugal, and deadlier yet, a coast"
14320,BOOK VII,That crouches over against us. Cadiz holds
14321,BOOK VII,"A huge Armada, none knows where to strike;"
14322,BOOK VII,And even this day a flying horseman brought
14323,BOOK VII,Rumours that Spain hath landed a great force
14324,BOOK VII,In Ireland. Mary of Scotland only waits
14325,BOOK VII,The word to stab us in the side for Rome.
14326,BOOK VII,"The Queen, weighed down by Burleigh and the friends"
14327,BOOK VII,"Of peace at any cost, may yet be driven"
14328,BOOK VII,"To make thy life our ransom, which indeed"
14329,BOOK VII,"She hath already sworn, or seemed to swear."""
14330,BOOK VII,
14331,BOOK VII,"To whom Drake answered, ""Gloriana lives;"
14332,BOOK VII,"And in her life mine only fear lies dead,"
14333,BOOK VII,"Mine only fear, for England, not myself."
14334,BOOK VII,"Willing am I and glad, as I have lived,"
14335,BOOK VII,To die for England's sake.
14336,BOOK VII,"Yet, lest the Queen be driven now to restore"
14337,BOOK VII,"This cargo that I bring her--a world's wealth,"
14338,BOOK VII,"The golden springs of all the power of Spain,"
14339,BOOK VII,The jewelled hearts of all those cruel realms
14340,BOOK VII,(For I have plucked them out) beyond the sea;
14341,BOOK VII,Lest she be driven to yield them up again
14342,BOOK VII,"For Spain and Spain's delight, I will warp out"
14343,BOOK VII,Behind St. Nicholas' Island. The fierce plague
14344,BOOK VII,"In Plymouth shall be colour and excuse,"
14345,BOOK VII,Until my courier return from court
14346,BOOK VII,"With Gloriana's will. If it be death,"
14347,BOOK VII,"I'll out again to sea, strew its rough floor"
14348,BOOK VII,"With costlier largesses than kings can throw,"
14349,BOOK VII,"And, ere I die, will singe the Spaniard's beard"
14350,BOOK VII,And set the fringe of his imperial robe
14351,BOOK VII,Blazing along his coasts. Then let him roll
14352,BOOK VII,"His galleons round the little _Golden Hynde_,"
14353,BOOK VII,"Bring her to bay, if he can, on the high seas,"
14354,BOOK VII,"Ring us about with thousands, we'll not yield,"
14355,BOOK VII,"I and my _Golden Hynde_, we will go down,"
14356,BOOK VII,With flag still flying on the last stump left us
14357,BOOK VII,And all my cannon spitting out the fires
14358,BOOK VII,"Of everlasting scorn into his face."""
14359,BOOK VII,
14360,BOOK VII,So Drake warped out the _Golden Hynde_ anew
14361,BOOK VII,"Behind St. Nicholas' Island. She lay there,"
14362,BOOK VII,The small grey-golden centre of the world
14363,BOOK VII,"That raged all round her, the last hope, the star"
14364,BOOK VII,"Of Protestant freedom, she, the outlawed ship"
14365,BOOK VII,Holding within her the great head and heart
14366,BOOK VII,Of England's ocean power; and all the fleets
14367,BOOK VII,"That have enfranchised earth, in that small ship,"
14368,BOOK VII,Lay waiting for their doom.
14369,BOOK VII,Past her at night
14370,BOOK VII,"Fisher-boats glided, wondering as they heard"
14371,BOOK VII,In the thick darkness the great songs they deemed
14372,BOOK VII,Must oft have risen from many a lonely sea;
14373,BOOK VII,For oft had Spaniards brought a rumour back
14374,BOOK VII,Of that strange pirate who in royal state
14375,BOOK VII,"Sailed to a sound of violins, and dined"
14376,BOOK VII,"With skilled musicians round him, turning all"

14473,SONG,"Beyond all price, diamonds, crosses of gold,"
14474,SONG,"Rubies that smouldered once for Aztec kings,"

14502,SONG,Her officers of state with mouths awry
14503,SONG,"Informed the high ambassador of Spain,"
14504,SONG,"Despite his pomp and circumstance, the Queen"
14505,SONG,"Could not receive him, being in conference"
14506,SONG,"With some rough seaman, pirate, what you will,"
14507,SONG,"A fellow made of bronze, a buccaneer,"
14508,SONG,"Maned like a lion, bearded like a pard,"
14509,SONG,"With hammered head, clamped jaws, and great deep eyes"
14510,SONG,"That burned with fierce blue colours of the brine,"
14511,SONG,"And liked not Spain--Drake! 'Twas the very name,"
14512,SONG,"One Francis Drake! a Titan that had stood,"
14513,SONG,"Thundering commands against the thundering heavens,"
14514,SONG,"On lightning-shattered, storm-swept decks and drunk"

14517,SONG,"To Spain's ambassador, nor see his face"
14518,SONG,"Again, while yet one Spanish musketeer"
14519,SONG,Remained in Ireland.
14520,SONG,Vainly the Spaniard raged
14521,SONG,"Of restitution, recompense; for now"
14522,SONG,Had Drake brought up the little _Golden Hynde_
14523,SONG,"To London, and the rumor of her wealth"
14524,SONG,Out-topped the wild reality. The crew
14525,SONG,Were princes as they swaggered down the streets
14526,SONG,In weather-beaten splendour. Out of their doors
14527,SONG,To wonder and stare the jostling citizens ran
14528,SONG,When They went by; and through the length and breadth
14529,SONG,"Of England, now, the gathering glory of life"
14530,SONG,"Shone like the dawn. O'er hill and dale it streamed,"
14531,SONG,"Dawn, everlasting and almighty dawn,"

14534,SONG,"In each remotest hamlet, by the hearth,"
14535,SONG,"The cart, the grey church-porch, the village pump"
14536,SONG,"By meadow and mill and old manorial hall,"
14537,SONG,"By turnpike and by tavern, farm and forge,"
14538,SONG,Men staved the crimson vintage of romance
14539,SONG,"And held it up against the light and drank it,"
14540,SONG,And with it drank confusion to the wrath

14569,BOOK VIII,Or none that reached her restless helpless hands.
14570,BOOK VIII,Only the general rumour of the world
14571,BOOK VIII,Borne to her by the gossip of her maid
14572,BOOK VIII,Kept the swift pictures passing through her brain
14573,BOOK VIII,Of how the _Golden Hynde_ was hauled ashore
14574,BOOK VIII,"At Deptford through a sea of exultation,"
14575,BOOK VIII,And by the Queen's command was now set up
14576,BOOK VIII,For an everlasting memory!
14577,BOOK VIII,Of how the Queen with subtle statecraft still
14578,BOOK VIII,"Kept Spain at arm's-length, dangling, while she played"
14579,BOOK VIII,"At fast and loose with France, whose embassy,"
14580,BOOK VIII,"Arriving with the marriage-treaty, found"
14581,BOOK VIII,"(And trembled at her daring, since the wrath"
14582,BOOK VIII,"Of Spain seemed, in their eyes, to flake with foam"
14583,BOOK VIII,The storm-beat hulk) a gorgeous banquet spread
14584,BOOK VIII,To greet them on that very _Golden Hynde_
14585,BOOK VIII,"Which sacked the Spanish main, a gorgeous feast,"
14586,BOOK VIII,The like of which old England had not seen
14587,BOOK VIII,"Since the bluff days of boisterous king Hal,"
14588,BOOK VIII,"Great shields of brawn with mustard, roasted swans,"
14589,BOOK VIII,"Haunches of venison, roasted chines of beef,"
14590,BOOK VIII,"And chewets baked, big olive-pyes thereto,"

14592,BOOK VIII,"White wine, rose-water, and candied eringoes."
14593,BOOK VIII,"There, on the outlawed ship, whose very name"
14594,BOOK VIII,Rang like a blasphemy in the imperial ears
14595,BOOK VIII,Of Spain (its every old worm-eaten plank
14596,BOOK VIII,Being scored with scorn and courage that not storm
14597,BOOK VIII,"Nor death, nor all their Inquisition racks,"
14598,BOOK VIII,The white-hot irons and bloody branding whips
14599,BOOK VIII,"That scarred the backs of Rome's pale galley-slaves,"
14600,BOOK VIII,"Her captured English seamen, ever could daunt),"
14601,BOOK VIII,"There with huge Empires waiting for one word,"
14602,BOOK VIII,"One breath of colour and excuse, to leap"
14603,BOOK VIII,"Like wolves at the naked throat of her small isle,"
14604,BOOK VIII,"There in the eyes of the staggered world she stood,"
14605,BOOK VIII,"Great Gloriana, while the live decks reeled"
14606,BOOK VIII,"With flash of jewels and flush of rustling silks,"
14607,BOOK VIII,"She stood with Drake, the corsair, and her people"
14608,BOOK VIII,Surged like a sea around. There did she give
14609,BOOK VIII,Open defiance with her agate smile
14610,BOOK VIII,"To Spain. ""Behold this pirate, now,"" she cried,"
14611,BOOK VIII,"""Whose head my Lord, the Invincible, Philip of Spain"

14613,BOOK VIII,Kneel down; for now have I this gilded sword

14615,BOOK VIII,"Ambassador of France, since I be woman,"
14616,BOOK VIII,"And squeamish at the sight of blood, give thou"

14618,BOOK VIII,"(Thus, even in boldness, playing a crafty part,"
14619,BOOK VIII,And dangling France before the adventurous deed)
14620,BOOK VIII,"To Marchaumont: and in the face of Europe,"
14621,BOOK VIII,With that huge fleet in Cadiz and the whole
14622,BOOK VIII,"World-power of Spain crouching around her isle,"
14623,BOOK VIII,"Knighted the master-thief of the unknown world,"
14624,BOOK VIII,Sir Francis Drake.
14625,BOOK VIII,And then the rumour came
14626,BOOK VIII,Of vaster privateerings planned by Drake
14627,BOOK VIII,Against the coasts of Philip; but held in check
14628,BOOK VIII,"And fretting at the leash, as ever the Queen"
14629,BOOK VIII,"Clung to her statecraft, while Drake's enemies"
14630,BOOK VIII,Worked in the dark against him. Spain had set
14631,BOOK VIII,An emperor's ransom on his life. At home
14632,BOOK VIII,"John Doughty, treacherous brother of that traitor"
14633,BOOK VIII,"Who met his doom by Drake's own hand, intrigued"
14634,BOOK VIII,With Spain abroad and Spain's dark emissaries
14635,BOOK VIII,At home to avenge his brother. Burleigh still
14636,BOOK VIII,Beset Drake's path with pitfalls: treacherous greed
14637,BOOK VIII,For Spain's blood-money daggered all the dark
14638,BOOK VIII,"Around him, and John Doughty without cease"
14639,BOOK VIII,"Sought to make use of all; until, by chance,"
14640,BOOK VIII,Drake gat the proof of treasonable intrigue
14641,BOOK VIII,"With Spain, against him, up to the deadly hilt,"
14642,BOOK VIII,And hurled him into the Tower.
14643,BOOK VIII,Many a night
14644,BOOK VIII,She sat by that old casement nigh the sea
14645,BOOK VIII,And heard its ebb and flow. With soul erect
14646,BOOK VIII,"And splendid now she waited, yet there came"
14647,BOOK VIII,"No message; and, she thought, he hath seen at last"
14648,BOOK VIII,"My little worth. And when her maiden sang,"
14649,BOOK VIII,With white throat throbbing softly in the dusk
14650,BOOK VIII,"And fingers gently straying o'er the lute,"
14651,BOOK VIII,"As was her wont at twilight, some old song"
14652,BOOK VIII,Of high disdainful queens and lovers pale
14653,BOOK VIII,"Pining a thousand years before their feet,"
14654,BOOK VIII,"She thought, ""O, if my lover loved me yet"
14655,BOOK VIII,My heart would break for joy to welcome him:
14656,BOOK VIII,Perchance his true pride will not let him come
14657,BOOK VIII,"Since false pride barred him out""; and yet again"
14658,BOOK VIII,"She burned with shame, thinking, ""to him such pride"
14659,BOOK VIII,"Were matter for a jest. Ah no, he hath seen"
14660,BOOK VIII,"My little worth."" Even so, one night she sat,"
14661,BOOK VIII,"One dark rich summer night, thinking him far"
14662,BOOK VIII,"Away, wrapped in the multitudinous cares"
14663,BOOK VIII,Of one that seemed the steersman of the State
14664,BOOK VIII,"Now, thro' the storm of Europe; while her maid"
14665,BOOK VIII,"Sang to the lute, and soft sea-breezes brought"
14666,BOOK VIII,Wreathed scents and sighs of secret waves and flowers
14667,BOOK VIII,Warm through the casement's muffling jasmine bloom.

14685,II,II
14686,II,
14687,II,"_Let not the queen that would not hear,"
14688,II,(Love lies dead!)
14689,II,Or beauty that refused to save.
14690,II,Exult in one dejected tear;
14691,II,"But gather the glory of the year,"
14692,II,"The pomp and glory of the year,"
14693,II,"The triumphing glory of the year,"
14694,II,"And softly, softly, softly shed"
14695,II,Its light and fragrance round the grave
14696,II,Where Love lies dead_.
14697,II,"The song ceased. Far away the great sea slept,"
14698,II,And all was very still. Only hard by
14699,II,"One bird-throat poured its passion through the gloom,"
14700,II,And the whole night breathlessly listened.
14701,II,A twig
14702,II,"Snapped, the song ceased, the intense dumb night was all"
14703,II,One passion of expectation--as if that song
14704,II,"Were prelude, and ere long the heavens and earth"
14705,II,Would burst into one great triumphant psalm.
14706,II,The song ceased only as if that small bird-throat
14707,II,Availed no further. Would the next great chord
14708,II,Ring out from harps in flaming seraph hands
14709,II,"Ranged through the sky? The night watched, breathless, dumb."
14710,II,Bess listened. Once again a dry twig snapped
14711,II,"Beneath her casement, and a face looked up,"
14712,II,"Draining her face of blood, of sight, of life,"
14713,II,"Whispering, a voice from far beyond the stars,"
14714,II,"Whispering, unutterable joy, the whole"
14715,II,Glory of life and death in one small word--
14716,II,_Sweetheart!_
14717,II,"The jasmine at her casement shook,"
14718,II,"She knew no more than he was at her side,"
14719,II,"His arms were round her, and his breath beat warm"
14720,II,Against her cheek.

14722,II,*   *   *   *
14723,II,
14724,II,"Suddenly, nigh the house,"
14725,II,A deep-mouthed mastiff bayed and a foot crunched
14726,II,"The gravel. ""Hark! they are watching for thee,"" she cried."
14727,II,"He laughed: ""There's half of Europe on the watch"
14728,II,"Outside for my poor head, 'Tis cosier here"
14729,II,"With thee; but now""--his face grew grave, he drew"
14730,II,"A silken ladder from his doublet--""quick,"
14731,II,Before yon good gamekeeper rounds the house
14732,II,"We must be down."" And ere the words were out"
14733,II,"Bess reached the path, and Drake was at her side."
14734,II,Then into the star-stabbed shadow of the woods
14735,II,"They sped, his arm around her. Suddenly"
14736,II,"She drew back with a cry, as four grim faces,"
14737,II,"With hand to forelock, glimmered in their way."
14738,II,Laughing she saw their storm-beat friendly smile
14739,II,Welcome their doughty captain in this new
14740,II,"Adventure. Far away, once more they heard"
14741,II,"The mastiff bay; then nearer, as if his nose"
14742,II,Were down upon the trail; and then a cry
14743,II,"As of a hot pursuit. They reached the brook,"
14744,II,Hurrying to the deep. Drake lifted Bess
14745,II,"In his arms, and down the watery bed they splashed"
14746,II,To baffle the clamouring hunt. Then out of the woods
14747,II,"They came, on the seaward side, and Bess, with a shiver,"
14748,II,"Saw starlight flashing from bare cutlasses,"
14749,II,As the mastiff bayed still nearer. Swiftlier now
14750,II,They passed along the bare blunt cliffs and saw
14751,II,The furrow ploughed by that strange cannon-shot
14752,II,Which saved this hour for Bess; down to the beach
14753,II,And starry foam that churned the silver gravel
14754,II,"Around an old black lurching boat, a strange"
14755,II,"Grim Charon's wherry for two lovers' flight,"
14756,II,"Guarded by old Tom Moone. Drake took her hand,"
14757,II,"And with one arm around her waist, her breath"
14758,II,"Warm on his cheek for a moment, in she stepped"
14759,II,"Daintily o'er the gunwale, and took her seat,"
14760,II,"His throned princess, beside him at the helm,"
14761,II,"Backed by the glittering waves, his throned princess,"
14762,II,With jewelled throat and glorious hair that seemed
14763,II,Flashing back scents and colours to a sea
14764,II,Which lived but to reflect her loveliness.
14765,II,
14766,II,"Then, all together, with their brandished oars"
14767,II,The seamen thrust as a heavy mounded wave
14768,II,Lifted the boat; and up the flowering breast
14769,II,"Of the next they soared, then settled at the thwarts,"
14770,II,And the fierce water boiled before their blades
14771,II,While with Drake's iron hand upon the helm
14772,II,They plunged and ploughed across the starlit seas
14773,II,"To where a small black lugger at anchor swung,"
14774,II,Dipping her rakish brow i' the liquid moon.
14775,II,"Small was she, but not fangless; for Bess saw,"
14776,II,"With half a tremor, the dumb protective grin"
14777,II,Of four grim guns above the tossing boat.
14778,II,
14779,II,But ere his seamen or his sweetheart knew
14780,II,"What power, as of a wind, bore them along,"
14781,II,"Anchor was up, the sails were broken out,"
14782,II,And as they scudded down the dim grey coast
14783,II,Of a new enchanted world (for now had Love
14784,II,Made all things new and strange) the skilled musicians
14785,II,"Upraised, at Drake's command, a song to cheer"
14786,II,Their midnight path across that faery sea.

14985,BOOK IX,Night of the last corruption of a world
14986,BOOK IX,"Fast-bound in misery and iron, with chains"
14987,BOOK IX,"Of priest and king and feudal servitude,"
14988,BOOK IX,"Night of the fettered flesh and ravaged soul,"

15004,BOOK IX,Of England. Under Philip's feet at last

15010,BOOK IX,"Of seamen, torch and battle-lanthorn nigh,"
15011,BOOK IX,"Watched by the brooding unlit beacons, piled"
15012,BOOK IX,"Of sun-dried gorse, funereal peat, rough logs,"

15018,BOOK IX,"And through that deepening gloom when, as it seemed,"
15019,BOOK IX,"All England held her breath in one grim doubt,"
15020,BOOK IX,Swift rumours flashed from North to South as runs
15021,BOOK IX,The lightning round a silent thunder-cloud;
15022,BOOK IX,"And there were muttering crowds in the London streets,"

15024,BOOK IX,"All night, dark inns, gathering the country-side,"
15025,BOOK IX,Reddened with clashing auguries of war.
15026,BOOK IX,"All night, in the ships of Plymouth Sound, the soul"
15027,BOOK IX,"Of Francis Drake was England, and all night"

15030,BOOK IX,
15031,BOOK IX,But hour by hour that night grew deeper. Spain
15032,BOOK IX,"Watched, cloud by cloud, her huge Armadas grow,"
15033,BOOK IX,"Watched, tower by tower, and zone by zone, her fleets"
15034,BOOK IX,Grapple the sky with a hundred hands and drag
15035,BOOK IX,"Whole sea-horizons into her menacing ranks,"
15036,BOOK IX,"Joining her powers to the fierce night, while Philip"
15037,BOOK IX,"Still strove, with many a crafty word, to lull"
15038,BOOK IX,"The fears of Gloriana, till his plots"
15039,BOOK IX,"Were ripe, his armaments complete; and still"
15040,BOOK IX,"Great Gloriana took her woman's way,"
15041,BOOK IX,Preferring ever tortuous intrigue
15042,BOOK IX,"To battle, since the stakes had grown so great;"
15043,BOOK IX,"Now, more than ever, hoping against hope"
15044,BOOK IX,To find some subtler means of victory;
15045,BOOK IX,"Yet not without swift impulses to strike,"
15046,BOOK IX,"Swiftly recalled. Blind, yet not blind, she smiled"
15047,BOOK IX,"On Mary of Scotland waiting for her throne,"
15048,BOOK IX,A throne with many a strange dark tremor thrilled
15049,BOOK IX,Now as the rumoured murderous mines below
15050,BOOK IX,"Converged towards it, mine and countermine,"
15051,BOOK IX,Till the live earth was honeycombed with death.
15052,BOOK IX,"Still with her agate smile, still she delayed,"
15053,BOOK IX,Holding her pirate admiral in the leash
15054,BOOK IX,"Till Walsingham, nay, even the hunchback Burleigh,"
15055,BOOK IX,"That crafty king of statesmen, seeing at last"
15056,BOOK IX,The inevitable thunder-crash at hand.
15057,BOOK IX,Grew heart-sick with delay and ached to shatter
15058,BOOK IX,The tense tremendous hush that seemed to oppress
15059,BOOK IX,"All hearts, compress all brows, load the broad night"
15060,BOOK IX,With more than mortal menace.
15061,BOOK IX,
15062,BOOK IX,Only once
15063,BOOK IX,"The night was traversed with one lightning flash,"
15064,BOOK IX,"One rapier stroke from England, at the heart"
15065,BOOK IX,"Of Spain, as swiftly parried, yet no less"
15066,BOOK IX,A fiery challenge; for Philip's hate and scorn
15067,BOOK IX,"Growing with his Armada's growth, he lured"
15068,BOOK IX,With promises of just and friendly trade
15069,BOOK IX,A fleet of English corn-ships to relieve
15070,BOOK IX,His famine-stricken coast. There as they lay
15071,BOOK IX,"Within his ports he seized them, one and all,"
15072,BOOK IX,To fill the Armada's maw.
15073,BOOK IX,
15074,BOOK IX,"Whereat the Queen,"

15086,BOOK IX,"From Spain's revenge: he, privateer to the eyes"
15087,BOOK IX,"Of Spain, but England to all English hearts,"
15088,BOOK IX,"Gathered together, in all good jollity,"
15089,BOOK IX,"All help and furtherance himself could wish,"
15090,BOOK IX,"Before that moon was out, a pirate fleet"
15091,BOOK IX,Whereof the like old ocean had not seen--
15092,BOOK IX,"Eighteen swift cruisers, two great battleships,"
15093,BOOK IX,With pinnaces and store-ships and a force
15094,BOOK IX,"Of nigh three thousand men, wherewith to singe"

15123,SONG,The flower of flowers most glorious!

15126,SONG,But its heart breaks out wi' the Rose
15127,SONG,"On England's flag victorious,"
15128,SONG,The triumphing flag that flows
15129,SONG,Thro' the heavens of Liberty.

15132,SONG,The flower of flowers most beautiful!

15139,SONG,

15143,SONG,"Its waves are the waves of the sea,"

15164,SONG,A Rose that sinks i' the West
15165,SONG,And surges round the world;
15166,SONG,Sing we the Rose!
15167,SONG,
15168,SONG,"One night as, with his great vice-admiral,"
15169,SONG,"Frobisher, his rear-admiral, Francis Knollys,"
15170,SONG,"And Thomas Fenner, his flag-captain, Drake"
15171,SONG,"Took counsel at his tavern, there came a knock,"
15172,SONG,"The door opened, and cold as from the sea"
15173,SONG,"The gloom rushed in, and there against the night,"
15174,SONG,"Clad as it seemed with wind and cloud and rain,"
15175,SONG,Glittered a courtier whom by face and form
15176,SONG,"All knew for the age's brilliant paladin,"
15177,SONG,"Sidney, the king of courtesy, a star"
15178,SONG,"Of chivalry. The seamen stared at him,"
15179,SONG,Each with a hand upon the red-lined chart
15180,SONG,"Outspread before them. Then all stared at Drake,"
15181,SONG,"Who crouched like a great bloodhound o'er the table,"
15182,SONG,And rose with a strange light burning in his eyes;
15183,SONG,"For he remembered how, three years agone,"
15184,SONG,"That other courtier came, with words and smiles"
15185,SONG,Copied from Sidney's self; and in his ears
15186,SONG,Rang once again the sound of the two-edged sword
15187,SONG,Upon the desolate Patagonian shore
15188,SONG,Beneath Magellan's gallows. With a voice
15189,SONG,"So harsh himself scarce knew it, he desired"
15190,SONG,This fair new courtier's errand. With grim eyes
15191,SONG,"He scanned the silken knight from head to foot,"
15192,SONG,"While Sidney, smiling graciously, besought"
15193,SONG,Some place in their adventure. Drake's clenched fist
15194,SONG,"Crashed down on the old oak table like a rock,"
15195,SONG,Splintering the wood and dashing his rough wrist
15196,SONG,"With blood, as he thundered, ""By the living God,"
15197,SONG,"No! We've no room for courtiers, now! We leave"
15198,SONG,"All that to Spain."""
15199,SONG,"Whereat, seeing Sidney stood"
15200,SONG,"Amazed, Drake, drawing nearer, said, ""You ask"
15201,SONG,More than you dream: I know you for a knight
15202,SONG,"Most perfect and most gentle, yea, a man"
15203,SONG,Ready to die on any battle-field
15204,SONG,"To save a wounded friend"" (even so said Drake,"
15205,SONG,"Not knowing how indeed this knight would die),"
15206,SONG,Then fiercely he outstretched his bleeding hand
15207,SONG,And pointed through the door to where the gloom
15208,SONG,"Glimmered with bursting spray, and the thick night"
15209,SONG,Was all one wandering thunder of hidden seas
15210,SONG,"Rolling out of Eternity: ""You'll find"
15211,SONG,"No purple fields of Arcady out there,"
15212,SONG,"No shepherds piping in those boisterous valleys,"
15213,SONG,"No sheep among those roaring mountain-tops,"
15214,SONG,No lists of feudal chivalry. I've heard
15215,SONG,That voice cry death to courtiers. 'Tis God's voice.
15216,SONG,Take you the word of one who has occupied
15217,SONG,"His business in great waters. There's no room,"
15218,SONG,"Meaning, or reason, office, or place, or name"
15219,SONG,For courtiers on the sea. Does the sea flatter?
15220,SONG,"You cannot bribe it, torture it, or tame it!"
15221,SONG,"Its laws are those of the Juggernaut universe,"
15222,SONG,"Remorseless--listen to that!""--a mighty wave"
15223,SONG,"Broke thundering down the coast; ""your hands are white,"
15224,SONG,"Your rapier jewelled, can you grapple that?"
15225,SONG,What part have you in all its flaming ways?
15226,SONG,What share in its fierce gloom? Has your heart broken
15227,SONG,As those waves break out there? Can you lie down
15228,SONG,"And sleep, as a lion-cub by the old lion,"
15229,SONG,"When it shakes its mane out over you to hide you,"
15230,SONG,And leap out with the dawn as I have done?
15231,SONG,"These are big words; but, see, my hand is red:"
15232,SONG,"You cannot torture me, I have borne all that;"
15233,SONG,"And so I have some kinship with the sea,"
15234,SONG,"Some sort of wild alliance with its storms,"
15235,SONG,"Its exultations, ay, and its great wrath"
15236,SONG,"At last, and power upon them. 'Tis the worse"
15237,SONG,"For Spain, Be counselled well: come not between"
15238,SONG,"My sea and its rich vengeance."""
15239,SONG,"Silently,"
15240,SONG,"Bowing his head, Sidney withdrew. But Drake,"
15241,SONG,"So fiercely the old grief rankled in his heart,"
15242,SONG,"Summoned his swiftest horseman, bidding him ride,"
15243,SONG,"Ride like the wind through the night, straight to the Queen,"
15244,SONG,Praying she would most instantly recall
15245,SONG,"Her truant courtier. Nay, to make all sure,"
15246,SONG,Drake sent a gang of seamen out to crouch
15247,SONG,"Ambushed in woody hollows nigh the road,"
15248,SONG,"Under the sailing moon, there to waylay"
15249,SONG,"The Queen's reply, that she might never know"
15250,SONG,"It reached him, if it proved against his will."
15251,SONG,
15252,SONG,And swiftly came that truant's stern recall;
15253,SONG,"But Drake, in hourly dread of some new change"
15254,SONG,"In Gloriana's mood, slept not by night"
15255,SONG,"Or day, till out of roaring Plymouth Sound"
15256,SONG,"The pirate fleet swept to the wind-swept main,"
15257,SONG,And took the wind and shook out all its sails.
15258,SONG,Then with the unfettered sea he mixed his soul
15259,SONG,"In great rejoicing union, while the ships"
15260,SONG,Crashing and soaring o'er the heart-free waves
15261,SONG,Drave ever straight for Spain.
15262,SONG,Water and food
15263,SONG,They lacked; but the fierce fever of his mind
15264,SONG,To sail from Plymouth ere the Queen's will changed
15265,SONG,"Had left no time for these. Right on he drave,"
15266,SONG,"Determining, though the Queen's old officers"
15267,SONG,"Beneath him stood appalled, to take in stores"
15268,SONG,"Of all he needed, water, powder, food,"
15269,SONG,"By plunder of Spain herself. In Vigo bay,"
15270,SONG,"Close to Bayona town, under the cliffs"
15271,SONG,Of Spain's world-wide and thunder-fraught prestige
15272,SONG,"He anchored, with the old sea-touch that wakes"
15273,SONG,"Our England still. There, in the tingling ears"
15274,SONG,"Of the world he cried, _En garde_! to the King of Spain."
15275,SONG,"There, ordering out his pinnaces in force,"
15276,SONG,"While a great storm, as if he held indeed"
15277,SONG,"Heaven's batteries in reserve, growled o'er the sea,"
15278,SONG,He landed. Ere one cumbrous limb of all
15279,SONG,The monstrous armaments of Spain could move
15280,SONG,His ships were stored; and ere the sword of Spain
15281,SONG,"Stirred in its crusted sheath, Bayona town"
15282,SONG,Beheld an empty sea; for like a dream
15283,SONG,"The pirate fleet had vanished, none knew whither."
15284,SONG,"But, in its visible stead, invisible fear"
15285,SONG,Filled the vast rondure of the sea and sky
15286,SONG,As with the omnipresent soul of Drake.
15287,SONG,For when Spain saw the small black anchored fleet
15288,SONG,"Ride in her bays, the sight set bounds to fear."
15289,SONG,"She knew at least the ships were oak, the guns"
15290,SONG,Of common range: nor did she dream e'en Drake
15291,SONG,Could sail two seas at once. Now all her coasts
15292,SONG,"Heard him all night in every bursting wave,"
15293,SONG,His topsails gleamed in every moonlit cloud;
15294,SONG,His battle-lanthorn glittered in the stars
15295,SONG,That hung the low horizon. He became
15296,SONG,A universal menace; yet there followed
15297,SONG,"No sight or sound of him, unless the sea"
15298,SONG,Were that grim soul incarnate. Did it not roar
15299,SONG,His great commands? The very spray that lashed
15300,SONG,The cheeks of Spanish seamen lashed their hearts
15301,SONG,To helpless hatred of him. The wind sang
15302,SONG,_El Draque_ across the rattling blocks and sheets
15303,SONG,"When storms perplexed them; and when ships went down,"
15304,SONG,"As under the fury of his onsetting battle,"
15305,SONG,The drowning sailors cursed him while they sank.
15306,SONG,
15307,SONG,"Suddenly a rumour shook the Spanish Court,"
15308,SONG,"He has gone once more to the Indies. Santa Cruz,"
15309,SONG,"High Admiral of Spain, the most renowned"
15310,SONG,"Captain in Europe, clamoured for a fleet"
15311,SONG,Of forty sail instantly to pursue.
15312,SONG,For unto him whose little _Golden Hynde_
15313,SONG,"Was weapon enough, now leading such a squadron,"
15314,SONG,"The West Indies, the whole Pacific coast,"
15315,SONG,"And the whole Spanish Main, lay at his mercy."
15316,SONG,
15317,SONG,And onward over the great grey gleaming sea
15318,SONG,Swept like a thunder-cloud the pirate fleet
15319,SONG,"With vengeance in its heart. Five years agone,"
15320,SONG,"Young Hawkins, in the Cape Verde Islands, met--"
15321,SONG,At Santiago--with such treachery
15322,SONG,"As Drake burned to requite, and from that hour"
15323,SONG,Was Santiago doomed. His chance had come;
15324,SONG,"Drake swooped upon it, plundered it, and was gone,"
15325,SONG,Leaving the treacherous isle a desolate heap
15326,SONG,"Of smoking ashes in the leaden sea,"
15327,SONG,While onward all those pirate bowsprits plunged
15328,SONG,"Into the golden West, across the broad"
15329,SONG,"Atlantic once again; ""For I will show,"""
15330,SONG,"Said Drake, ""that Englishmen henceforth will sail"
15331,SONG,"Old ocean where they will."" Onward they surged,"
15332,SONG,And the great glittering crested majestic waves
15333,SONG,"Jubilantly rushed up to meet the keels,"
15334,SONG,And there was nought around them but the grey
15335,SONG,"Ruin and roar of the huge Atlantic seas,"
15336,SONG,"Grey mounded seas, pursuing and pursued,"
15337,SONG,"That fly, hounded and hounding on for ever,"
15338,SONG,From empty marge to marge of the grey sky.
15339,SONG,"Over the wandering wilderness of foam,"
15340,SONG,"Onward, through storm and death, Drake swept; for now"
15341,SONG,"Once more a fell plague gripped the tossing ships,"
15342,SONG,And not by twos and threes as heretofore
15343,SONG,His crews were minished; but in three black days
15344,SONG,Three hundred seamen in their shotted shrouds
15345,SONG,"Were cast into the deep. Onward he swept,"
15346,SONG,"Implacably, having in mind to strike"
15347,SONG,"Spain in the throat at St. Domingo, port"
15348,SONG,"Of Hispaniola, a city of far renown,"
15349,SONG,"A jewel on the shores of old romance,"
15350,SONG,"Palm-shadowed, gated with immortal gold,"
15351,SONG,"Queen city of Spain's dominions over sea,"
15352,SONG,And guarded by great guns. Out of the dawn
15353,SONG,"The pirate ships came leaping, grim and black,"
15354,SONG,"And ere the Spaniards were awake, the flag"
15355,SONG,Of England floated from their topmost tower.
15356,SONG,But since he had not troops enough to hold
15357,SONG,"So great a city, Drake entrenched his men"
15358,SONG,Within the Plaza and held the batteries.
15359,SONG,"Thence he demanded ransom, and sent out"
15360,SONG,A boy with flag of truce. The boy's return
15361,SONG,Drake waited long. Under a sheltering palm
15362,SONG,"He stood, watching the enemies' camp, and lo,"
15363,SONG,Along the hot white purple-shadowed road
15364,SONG,"Tow'rds him, a crawling shape writhed through the dust"
15365,SONG,"Up to his feet, a shape besmeared with blood,"
15366,SONG,A shape that held the stumps up of its wrists
15367,SONG,"And moaned, an eyeless thing, a naked rag"
15368,SONG,"Of flesh obscenely mangled, a small face"
15369,SONG,"Hideously puckered, shrivelled like a monkey's"
15370,SONG,With lips drawn backward from its teeth.
15371,SONG,"""Speak, speak,"
15372,SONG,"In God's name, speak, what art thou?"" whispered Drake,"
15373,SONG,"And a sharp cry came, answering his dread,"
15374,SONG,A cry as of a sea-bird in the wind
15375,SONG,"Desolately astray from all earth's shores,"
15376,SONG,"""Captain, I am thy boy, only thy boy!"
15377,SONG,"See, see, my captain, see what they have done!"
15378,SONG,"Captain, I only bore the flag; I only----"""
15379,SONG,
15380,SONG,"""O, lad, lad, lad,"" moaned Drake, and, stooping, strove"
15381,SONG,To pillow the mangled head upon his arm.
15382,SONG,"""What have they done to thee, what have they done?"""
15383,SONG,"And at the touch the boy screamed, once, and died."
15384,SONG,
15385,SONG,Then like a savage sea with arms uplift
15386,SONG,"To heaven the wrath of Drake blazed thundering,"
15387,SONG,"""Eternal God, be this the doom of Spain!"
15388,SONG,Henceforward have no pity. Send the strength
15389,SONG,Of Thy great seas into my soul that I
15390,SONG,"May devastate this empire, this red hell"
15391,SONG,"They make of Thy good earth."""
15392,SONG,"His men drew round,"
15393,SONG,Staring in horror at the silent shape
15394,SONG,That daubed his feet. Like a cold wind
15395,SONG,His words went through their flesh:
15396,SONG,"""This is the lad"
15397,SONG,That bore our flag of truce. This hath Spain done.
15398,SONG,"Look well upon it, draw the smoke of the blood"
15399,SONG,"Up into your nostrils, my companions,"
15400,SONG,And down into your souls. This makes an end
15401,SONG,For Spain! Bring forth the Spanish prisoners
15402,SONG,"And let me look on them."""
15403,SONG,
15404,SONG,"Forth they were brought,"
15405,SONG,"A swarthy gorgeous band of soldiers, priests,"
15406,SONG,"And sailors, hedged between two sturdy files"
15407,SONG,Of British tars with naked cutlasses.
15408,SONG,"Close up to Drake they halted, under the palm,"
15409,SONG,"Gay smiling prisoners, for they thought their friends"
15410,SONG,Had ransomed them. Then they looked up and met
15411,SONG,"A glance that swept athwart them like a sword,"
15412,SONG,Making the blood strain back from their blanched faces
15413,SONG,"Into their quivering hearts, with unknown dread,"
15414,SONG,As that accuser pointed to the shape
15415,SONG,Before his feet.
15416,SONG,"""Dogs, will ye lap his blood"
15417,SONG,Before ye die? Make haste; for it grows cold!
15418,SONG,"Ye will not, will not even dabble your hands"
15419,SONG,"In that red puddle of flesh, what? Are ye Spaniards?"
15420,SONG,"Come, come, I'll look at you, perchance there's one"
15421,SONG,"That's but a demi-devil and holds you back."""
15422,SONG,And with the word Drake stepped among their ranks
15423,SONG,And read each face among the swarthy crew--
15424,SONG,"The gorgeous soldiers, ringleted sailors, priests"
15425,SONG,"With rosary and cross, a slender page"
15426,SONG,"In scarlet with a cloud of golden hair,"
15427,SONG,And two rope-girdled friars.
15428,SONG,The slim page
15429,SONG,"Drake drew before the throng. ""You are young,"" he said,"
15430,SONG,"""Go; take this message to the camp of Spain:"
15431,SONG,Tell them I have a hunger in my soul
15432,SONG,"To look upon the murderers of this boy,"
15433,SONG,"To see what eyes they have, what manner of mouths,"
15434,SONG,"To touch them and to take their hands in mine,"
15435,SONG,And draw them close to me and smile upon them
15436,SONG,"Until they know my soul as I know theirs,"
15437,SONG,And they grovel in the dust and grope for mercy.
15438,SONG,"Say that, until I get them, every day"
15439,SONG,I'll hang two Spaniards though I dispeople
15440,SONG,"The Spanish Main. Tell them that, every day,"
15441,SONG,"I'll burn a portion of their city down,"
15442,SONG,"Then find another city and burn that,"
15443,SONG,And then burn others till I burn away
15444,SONG,"Their empire from the world, ay, till I reach"
15445,SONG,"The Imperial throne of Philip with my fires,"
15446,SONG,And send it shrieking down to burn in hell
15447,SONG,"For ever. Go!"""
15448,SONG,"Then Drake turned once again,"
15449,SONG,To face the Spanish prisoners. With a voice
15450,SONG,Cold as the passionless utterance of Fate
15451,SONG,"His grim command went forth. ""Now, provost-marshal,"
15452,SONG,"Begin with yon two friars, in whose faces"
15453,SONG,"Chined like singed swine, and eyed with the spent coals"
15454,SONG,"Of filthy living, sweats the glory of Spain."
15455,SONG,Strip off their leprous rags
15456,SONG,And twist their ropes around their throats and hang them
15457,SONG,High over the Spanish camp for all to see.
15458,SONG,"At dawn I'll choose two more."""

15501,BOOK X,"Wormwood to Philip, of how Drake had stood"
15502,BOOK X,"I' the governor's house at San Domingo, and seen"
15503,BOOK X,A mighty scutcheon of the King of Spain
15504,BOOK X,"Whereon was painted the terrestrial globe,"
15505,BOOK X,And on the globe a mighty steed in act
15506,BOOK X,"To spring into the heavens, and from its mouth"
15507,BOOK X,"Streaming like smoke a scroll, and on the scroll"
15508,BOOK X,Three words of flame and fury--_Non sufficit
15509,BOOK X,Orbis_--of how Drake and his seamen stood
15510,BOOK X,"Gazing upon it, and could not forbear"
15511,BOOK X,From summoning the Spaniards to expound
15512,BOOK X,"Its meaning, whereupon a hurricane roar"
15513,BOOK X,"Of mirth burst from those bearded British lips,"
15514,BOOK X,And that immortal laughter shook the world.
15515,BOOK X,
15516,BOOK X,"So, while the imperial warrior eyes of Spain"
15517,BOOK X,"Watched, every hour, her vast Armada grow"
15518,BOOK X,Readier to launch and shatter with one stroke
15519,BOOK X,"Our island's frail defence, fear gripped her still,"
15520,BOOK X,For there came sounds across the heaving sea
15521,BOOK X,"Of secret springs unsealed, forces unchained,"
15522,BOOK X,"A mustering of deep elemental powers,"
15523,BOOK X,A sound as of the burgeoning of boughs
15524,BOOK X,In universal April and dead hearts
15525,BOOK X,Uprising from their tombs; a mighty cry
15526,BOOK X,"Of resurrection, surging through the souls"
15527,BOOK X,Of all mankind. For now the last wild tale
15528,BOOK X,Swept like another dawn across the deep;
15529,BOOK X,"And, in that dawn, men saw the slaves of Spain,"
15530,BOOK X,"The mutilated negroes of the mines,"
15531,BOOK X,"With gaunt backs wealed and branded, scarred and seared"
15532,BOOK X,"By whip and iron, in Spain's brute lust for gold,"
15533,BOOK X,"Saw them, at Drake's great liberating word,"
15534,BOOK X,"Burst from their chains, erect, uplifting hands"
15535,BOOK X,"Of rapture to the glad new light that then,"
15536,BOOK X,"Then first, began to struggle thro' the clouds"
15537,BOOK X,And crown all manhood with a sacred crown
15538,BOOK X,"August--a light which, though from age to age"
15539,BOOK X,"Clouds may obscure it, grows and still shall grow,"
15540,BOOK X,"Until that Kingdom come, that grand Communion,"
15541,BOOK X,"That Commonweal, that Empire, which still draws"
15542,BOOK X,"Nigher with every hour, that Federation,"
15543,BOOK X,That turning of the wasteful strength of war
15544,BOOK X,"To accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace,"
15545,BOOK X,That gathering up of one another's loads
15546,BOOK X,Whereby the weak are strengthened and the strong
15547,BOOK X,Made stronger in the increasing good of all.
15548,BOOK X,"Then, suddenly, it seemed, as he had gone,"
15549,BOOK X,A ship came stealing into Plymouth Sound
15550,BOOK X,"And Drake was home again, but not to rest;"
15551,BOOK X,For scarce had he cast anchor ere the road
15552,BOOK X,To London rang beneath the flying hoofs
15553,BOOK X,"That bore his brief despatch to Burleigh, saying--"
15554,BOOK X,"""We have missed the Plate Fleet by but twelve hours' sail,"
15555,BOOK X,The reason being best known to God. No less
15556,BOOK X,We have given a cooling to the King of Spain.
15557,BOOK X,"There is a great gap opened which, methinks,"
15558,BOOK X,Is little to his liking. We have sacked
15559,BOOK X,"The towns of his chief Indies, burnt their ships,"
15560,BOOK X,"Captured great store of gold and precious stones,"
15561,BOOK X,"Three hundred pieces of artillery,"
15562,BOOK X,"The more part brass. Our loss is heavy indeed,"
15563,BOOK X,"Under the hand of God, eight hundred men,"
15564,BOOK X,"Three parts of them by sickness. Captain Moone,"
15565,BOOK X,"My trusty old companion, he that struck"
15566,BOOK X,"The first blow in the South Seas at a Spaniard,"
15567,BOOK X,Died of a grievous wound at Cartagena.
15568,BOOK X,My fleet and I are ready to strike again
15569,BOOK X,"At once, where'er the Queen and England please."
15570,BOOK X,"I pray for her commands, and those with speed,"
15571,BOOK X,"That I may strike again."" Outside the scroll"
15572,BOOK X,"These words were writ once more--""My Queen's commands"
15573,BOOK X,"I much desire, your servant, Francis Drake."""
15574,BOOK X,
15575,BOOK X,This terse despatch the hunchback Burleigh read
15576,BOOK X,"Thrice over, with the broad cliff of his brow"
15577,BOOK X,Bending among his books. Thrice he assayed
15578,BOOK X,To steel himself with caution as of old;
15579,BOOK X,"And thrice, as a glorious lightning running along"
15580,BOOK X,"And flashing between those simple words, he saw"
15581,BOOK X,"The great new power that lay at England's hand,"
15582,BOOK X,"An ocean-sovereignty, a power unknown"
15583,BOOK X,"Before, but dawning now; a power that swept"
15584,BOOK X,All earth's old plots and counterplots away
15585,BOOK X,Like straws; the germ of an unmeasured force
15586,BOOK X,"New-born, that laid the source of Spanish might"
15587,BOOK X,At England's mercy! Could that force but grow
15588,BOOK X,"Ere Spain should nip it, ere the mighty host"
15589,BOOK X,"That waited in the Netherlands even now,"
15590,BOOK X,That host of thirty thousand men encamped
15591,BOOK X,"Round Antwerp, under Parma, should embark"
15592,BOOK X,Convoyed by that Invincible Armada
15593,BOOK X,To leap at England's throat! Thrice he assayed
15594,BOOK X,"To think of England's helplessness, her ships"
15595,BOOK X,Little and few. Thrice he assayed to quench
15596,BOOK X,With caution the high furnace of his soul
15597,BOOK X,Which Drake had kindled. As he read the last
15598,BOOK X,"Rough simple plea, _I wait my Queen's commands_,"
15599,BOOK X,His deep eyes flashed with glorious tears.
15600,BOOK X,He leapt
15601,BOOK X,"To his feet and cried aloud, ""Before my God,"
15602,BOOK X,"I am proud, I am very proud for England's sake!"
15603,BOOK X,"This Drake is a terrible man to the King of Spain."""
15604,BOOK X,
15605,BOOK X,"And still, still, Gloriana, brooding darkly"
15606,BOOK X,"On Mary of Scotland's doom, who now at last"
15607,BOOK X,Was plucked from out her bosom like a snake
15608,BOOK X,"Hissing of war with France, a queenly snake,"
15609,BOOK X,A Lilith in whose lovely gleaming folds
15610,BOOK X,And sexual bonds the judgment of mankind
15611,BOOK X,"Writhes even yet half-strangled, meting out"
15612,BOOK X,Wild execrations on the maiden Queen
15613,BOOK X,Who quenched those jewelled eyes and mixt with dust
15614,BOOK X,"That white and crimson, who with cold sharp steel"
15615,BOOK X,"In substance and in spirit, severed the neck"
15616,BOOK X,And straightened out those glittering supple coils
15617,BOOK X,For ever; though for evermore will men
15618,BOOK X,Lie subject to the unforgotten gleam
15619,BOOK X,"Of diamond eyes and cruel crimson mouth,"
15620,BOOK X,And curse the sword-bright intellect that struck
15621,BOOK X,Like lightning far through Europe and the world
15622,BOOK X,"For England, when amid the embattled fury"
15623,BOOK X,"Of world-wide empires, England stood alone."
15624,BOOK X,"Still she held back from war, still disavowed"
15625,BOOK X,The deeds of Drake to Spain; and yet once more
15626,BOOK X,"Philip, resolved at last never to swerve"
15627,BOOK X,"By one digressive stroke, one ell or inch"
15628,BOOK X,"From his own patient, sure, laborious path,"
15629,BOOK X,"Accepted her suave plea, and with all speed"
15630,BOOK X,Pressed on his huge emprise until it seemed
15631,BOOK X,"His coasts groaned with grim bulks of cannonry,"
15632,BOOK X,Thick loaded hulks of thunder and towers of doom;
15633,BOOK X,"And, all round Antwerp, Parma still prepared"
15634,BOOK X,To hurl such armies o'er the rolling sea
15635,BOOK X,As in all history hardly the earth herself
15636,BOOK X,Felt shake with terror her own green hills and plains.
15637,BOOK X,_I wait my Queen's commands!_ Despite the plea
15638,BOOK X,Urged every hour upon her with the fire
15639,BOOK X,"That burned for action in the soul of Drake,"
15640,BOOK X,"Still she delayed, till on one darkling eve"
15641,BOOK X,She gave him audience in that glimmering room
15642,BOOK X,Where first he saw her. Strangely sounded there
15643,BOOK X,The seaman's rough strong passion as he poured
15644,BOOK X,"His heart before her, pleading--""Every hour"
15645,BOOK X,"Is one more victory lost,"" and only heard"
15646,BOOK X,"The bitter answer--""Nay, but every hour"
15647,BOOK X,Is a breath snatched from the unconquerable
15648,BOOK X,"Doom, that awaits us if we are forced to war."
15649,BOOK X,"Yea, and who knows?--though Spain may forge a sword,"
15650,BOOK X,Its point is not inevitably bared
15651,BOOK X,"Against the breast of England!"" As she spake,"
15652,BOOK X,"The winds without clamoured with clash of bells,"
15653,BOOK X,There was a gleam of torches and a roar--
15654,BOOK X,"_Mary, the traitress of the North, is dead,"
15655,BOOK X,God save the Queen!_
15656,BOOK X,Her head bent down: she wept.
15657,BOOK X,"""Pity me, friend, though I be queen, O yet"
15658,BOOK X,"My heart is woman, and I am sore pressed"
15659,BOOK X,"On every side,--Scotland and France and Spain"
15660,BOOK X,"Beset me, and I know not where to turn."""
15661,BOOK X,"Even as she spake, there came a hurried step"
15662,BOOK X,Into that dim rich chamber. Walsingham
15663,BOOK X,"Stood there, before her, without ceremony"
15664,BOOK X,"Thrusting a letter forth: ""At last,"" he cried,"
15665,BOOK X,"""Your Majesty may read the full intent"
15666,BOOK X,"Of priestly Spain. Here, plainly written out"
15667,BOOK X,"Upon this paper, worth your kingdom's crown,"
15668,BOOK X,"This letter, stolen by a trusty spy,"
15669,BOOK X,Out of the inmost chamber of the Pope
15670,BOOK X,"Sixtus himself, here is your murder planned:"
15671,BOOK X,Blame not your Ministers who with such haste
15672,BOOK X,"Plucked out this viper, Mary, from your breast!"
15673,BOOK X,"Read here--how, with his thirty thousand men,"
15674,BOOK X,"The pick of Europe, Parma joins the Scots,"
15675,BOOK X,"While Ireland, grasped in their Armada's clutch,"
15676,BOOK X,"And the Isle of Wight, against our west and south"
15677,BOOK X,"Become their base."""
15678,BOOK X,"""Rome, Rome, and Rome again,"
15679,BOOK X,"And always Rome,"" she muttered; ""even here"
15680,BOOK X,In England hath she thousands yet. She hath struck
15681,BOOK X,"Her curse out with pontific finger at me,"
15682,BOOK X,Cursed me down and away to the bottomless pit.
15683,BOOK X,"Her shadow like the shadow of clouds or sails,"
15684,BOOK X,"The shadow of that huge event at hand,"
15685,BOOK X,"Darkens the seas already, and the wind"
15686,BOOK X,Is on my cheek that shakes my kingdom down.
15687,BOOK X,"She hath thousands here in England, born and bred"
15688,BOOK X,"Englishmen. They will stand by Rome!"""
15689,BOOK X,
15690,BOOK X,"""'Fore God,"""
15691,BOOK X,"Cried Walsingham, ""my Queen, you do them wrong!"
15692,BOOK X,There is another Rome--not this of Spain
15693,BOOK X,Which lurks to pluck the world back into darkness
15694,BOOK X,And stab it there for gold. There is a City
15695,BOOK X,Whose eyes are tow'rd the morning; on whose heights
15696,BOOK X,Blazes the Cross of Christ above the world;
15697,BOOK X,A Rome that shall wage warfare yet for God
15698,BOOK X,"In the dark days to come, a Rome whose thought"
15699,BOOK X,Shall march with our humanity and be proud
15700,BOOK X,"To cast old creeds like seed into the ground,"
15701,BOOK X,Watch the strange shoots and foster the new flower
15702,BOOK X,Of faiths we know not yet. Is this a dream?
15703,BOOK X,I speak as one by knighthood bound to speak;
15704,BOOK X,For even this day--and my heart burns with it--
15705,BOOK X,I heard the Catholic gentlemen of England
15706,BOOK X,Speaking in grave assembly. At one breath
15707,BOOK X,"Of peril to our island, why, their swords"
15708,BOOK X,"Leapt from their scabbards, and their cry went up"
15709,BOOK X,"To split the heavens--_God save our English Queen!_"""
15710,BOOK X,Even as he spake there passed the rushing gleam
15711,BOOK X,"Of torches once again, and as they stood"
15712,BOOK X,"Silently listening, all the winds ran wild"
15713,BOOK X,"With clamouring bells, and a great cry went up--"
15714,BOOK X,"_God save Elizabeth, our English Queen!_"
15715,BOOK X,
15716,BOOK X,"""I'll vouch for some two hundred Catholic throats"
15717,BOOK X,"Among that thousand,"" whispered Walsingham"
15718,BOOK X,"Eagerly, with his eyes on the Queen's face."
15719,BOOK X,"Then, seeing it brighten, fervently he cried,"
15720,BOOK X,"Pressing the swift advantage home, ""O, Madam,"
15721,BOOK X,The heart of England now is all on fire!
15722,BOOK X,"We are one people, as we have not been"
15723,BOOK X,"In all our history, all prepared to die"
15724,BOOK X,"Around your throne. Madam, you are beloved"
15725,BOOK X,"As never yet was English king or queen!"""
15726,BOOK X,"She looked at him, the tears in her keen eyes"
15727,BOOK X,"Glittered--""And I am very proud,"" she said,"
15728,BOOK X,"""But if our enemies command the world,"
15729,BOOK X,"And we have one small island and no more...."""
15730,BOOK X,"She ceased; and Drake, in a strange voice, hoarse and low,"
15731,BOOK X,"Trembling with passion deeper than all speech,"
15732,BOOK X,"Cried out--""No more than the great ocean-sea"
15733,BOOK X,Which makes the enemies' coast our frontier now;
15734,BOOK X,No more than that great Empire of the deep
15735,BOOK X,"Which rolls from Pole to Pole, washing the world"
15736,BOOK X,"With thunder, that great Empire whose command"
15737,BOOK X,"This day is yours to take. Hear me, my Queen,"
15738,BOOK X,"This is a dream, a new dream, but a true;"
15739,BOOK X,For mightier days are dawning on the world
15740,BOOK X,Than heart of man hath known. If England hold
15741,BOOK X,"The sea, she holds the hundred thousand gates"
15742,BOOK X,That open to futurity. She holds
15743,BOOK X,The highway of all ages. Argosies
15744,BOOK X,Of unknown glory set their sails this day
15745,BOOK X,For England out of ports beyond the stars.
15746,BOOK X,"Ay, on the sacred seas we ne'er shall know"
15747,BOOK X,"They hoist their sails this day by peaceful quays,"
15748,BOOK X,"Great gleaming wharves in the perfect City of God,"
15749,BOOK X,"If she but claim her heritage."""
15750,BOOK X,He ceased;
15751,BOOK X,"And the deep dream of that new realm the sea,"
15752,BOOK X,"Through all the soul of Gloriana surged,"
15753,BOOK X,"A moment, then with splendid eyes that filled"
15754,BOOK X,"With fire of sunsets far away, she cried"
15755,BOOK X,"(Faith making her a child, yet queenlier still)"
15756,BOOK X,"""Yea, claim it thou for me!"""
15757,BOOK X,A moment there
15758,BOOK X,"Trembling she stood. Then, once again, there passed"
15759,BOOK X,"A rush of torches through the gloom without,"
15760,BOOK X,"And a great cry ""_God save Elizabeth,"
15761,BOOK X,"God save our English Queen!_"""
15762,BOOK X,"""Yea go, then, go,"""
15763,BOOK X,"She said, ""God speed you now, Sir Francis Drake,"
15764,BOOK X,"Not as a privateer, but with full powers,"
15765,BOOK X,"My Admiral-at-the-Seas!"""
15766,BOOK X,Without a word
15767,BOOK X,"Drake bent above her hand and, ere she knew it,"
15768,BOOK X,His eyes from the dark doorway flashed farewell
15769,BOOK X,And he was gone. But ere he leapt to saddle
15770,BOOK X,"Walsingham stood at his stirrup, muttering ""Ride,"
15771,BOOK X,Ride now like hell to Plymouth; for the Queen
15772,BOOK X,"Is hard beset, and ere ye are out at sea"
15773,BOOK X,Her mood will change. The friends of Spain will move
15774,BOOK X,Earth and the heavens for your recall. They'll tempt her
15775,BOOK X,"With their false baits of peace, though I shall stand"
15776,BOOK X,"Here at your back through thick and thin; farewell!"""
15777,BOOK X,Fire flashed beneath the hoofs and Drake was gone.
15778,BOOK X,
15779,BOOK X,Scarce had he vanished in the night than doubt
15780,BOOK X,Once more assailed the Queen. The death of Mary
15781,BOOK X,"Had brought e'en France against her. Walsingham,"
15782,BOOK X,"And Burleigh himself, prime mover of that death,"
15783,BOOK X,"Being held in much disfavour for it, stood"
15784,BOOK X,"As helpless. Long ere Drake or human power,"
15785,BOOK X,"They thought, could put to sea, a courier sped"
15786,BOOK X,To Plymouth bidding Drake forbear to strike
15787,BOOK X,"At Spain, but keep to the high seas, and lo,"
15788,BOOK X,The roadstead glittered empty. Drake was gone!
15789,BOOK X,
15790,BOOK X,Gone! Though the friends of Spain had poured their gold
15791,BOOK X,"To thin his ranks, and every hour his crews"
15792,BOOK X,"Deserted, he had laughed--""Let Spain buy scum!"
15793,BOOK X,Next to an honest seaman I love best
15794,BOOK X,An honest landsman. What more goodly task
15795,BOOK X,"Than teaching brave men seamanship?"" He had filled"
15796,BOOK X,His ships with soldiers! Out in the teeth of the gale
15797,BOOK X,"That raged against him he had driven. In vain,"
15798,BOOK X,"Amid the boisterous laughter of the quays,"
15799,BOOK X,A pinnace dashed in hot pursuit and met
15800,BOOK X,A roaring breaker and came hurtling back
15801,BOOK X,"With oars and spars all trailing in the foam,"
15802,BOOK X,A tangled mass of wreckage and despair.
15803,BOOK X,Sky swept to stormy sky: no sail could live
15804,BOOK X,In that great yeast of waves; but Drake was gone!
15805,BOOK X,
15806,BOOK X,"Then, once again, across the rolling sea"
15807,BOOK X,Great rumours rushed of how he had sacked the port
15808,BOOK X,Of Cadiz and had swept along the coast
15809,BOOK X,"To Lisbon, where the whole Armada lay."
15810,BOOK X,"Had snapped up prizes under its very nose,"
15811,BOOK X,"And taunted Santa Cruz, High Admiral"
15812,BOOK X,"Of Spain, striving to draw him out for fight,"
15813,BOOK X,"And offering, if his course should lie that way,"
15814,BOOK X,"To convoy him to Britain, taunted him"
15815,BOOK X,"So bitterly that for once, in the world's eyes,"
15816,BOOK X,A jest had power to kill; for Santa Cruz
15817,BOOK X,"Died with the spleen of it, since he could not move"
15818,BOOK X,Before the appointed season. Then there came
15819,BOOK X,"Flying back home, the Queen's old Admiral"
15820,BOOK X,"Borough, deserting Drake and all aghast"
15821,BOOK X,"At Drake's temerity: ""For,"" he said, ""this man,"
15822,BOOK X,"Thrust o'er my head, against all precedent,"
15823,BOOK X,Bade me follow him into harbour mouths
15824,BOOK X,"A-flame with cannon like the jaws of death,"
15825,BOOK X,Whereat I much demurred; and straightway Drake
15826,BOOK X,"Clapped me in irons, me--an officer"
15827,BOOK X,"And Admiral of the Queen; and, though my voice"
15828,BOOK X,"Was all against it, plunged into the pit"
15829,BOOK X,"Without me, left me with some word that burns"
15830,BOOK X,"And rankles in me still, making me fear"
15831,BOOK X,"The man was mad, some word of lonely seas,"
15832,BOOK X,A desert island and a mutineer
15833,BOOK X,"And dead Magellan's gallows. Sirs, my life"
15834,BOOK X,"Was hardly safe with him. Why, he resolved"
15835,BOOK X,"To storm the Castle of St. Vincent, sirs,"
15836,BOOK X,"A castle on a cliff, grinning with guns,"
15837,BOOK X,Well known impregnable! The Spaniards fear
15838,BOOK X,Drake; but to see him land below it and bid
15839,BOOK X,"Surrender, sirs, the strongest fort of Spain"
15840,BOOK X,"Without a blow, they laughed! And straightway he,"
15841,BOOK X,"With all the fury of Satan, turned that cliff"
15842,BOOK X,To hell itself. He sent down to the ships
15843,BOOK X,"For faggots, broken oars, beams, bowsprits, masts,"
15844,BOOK X,"And piled them up against the outer gates,"
15845,BOOK X,"Higher and higher, and fired them. There he stood"
15846,BOOK X,"Amid the smoke and flame and cannon-shot,"
15847,BOOK X,"This Admiral, like a common seamen, black"
15848,BOOK X,"With soot, besmeared with blood, his naked arms"
15849,BOOK X,"Full of great faggots, labouring like a giant"
15850,BOOK X,"And roaring like Apollyon. Sirs, he is mad!"
15851,BOOK X,"But did he take it, say you? Yea, he took it,"
15852,BOOK X,"The mightiest stronghold on the coast of Spain,"
15853,BOOK X,Took it and tumbled all its big brass guns
15854,BOOK X,Clattering over the cliffs into the sea.
15855,BOOK X,"But, sirs, ye need not raise a cheer so loud"
15856,BOOK X,"It is not warfare. 'Twas a madman's trick,"
15857,BOOK X,"A devil's!"""
15858,BOOK X,Then the rumour of a storm
15859,BOOK X,That scattered the fleet of Drake to the four winds
15860,BOOK X,"Disturbed the heart of England, as his ships"
15861,BOOK X,"Came straggling into harbour, one by one,"
15862,BOOK X,"Saying they could not find him. Then, at last,"
15863,BOOK X,When the storm burst in its earth-shaking might
15864,BOOK X,"Along our coasts, one night of rolling gloom"
15865,BOOK X,His cannon woke old Plymouth. In he came
15866,BOOK X,Across the thunder and lightning of the sea
15867,BOOK X,"With his grim ship of war and, close behind,"
15868,BOOK X,A shadow like a mountain or a cloud
15869,BOOK X,"Torn from the heaven-high panoplies of Spain,"
15870,BOOK X,"A captured galleon loomed, and round her prow"
15871,BOOK X,"A blazoned scroll, whence (as she neared the quays"
15872,BOOK X,Which many a lanthorn swung from brawny fist
15873,BOOK X,Yellowed) the sudden crimson of her name
15874,BOOK X,"_San Filippe_ flashed o'er the white sea of faces,"
15875,BOOK X,And a rending shout went skyward that outroared
15876,BOOK X,"The blanching breakers--""'Tis the heart of Spain!"
15877,BOOK X,"The great _San Filippe_!"" Overhead she towered,"
15878,BOOK X,The mightiest ship afloat; and in her hold
15879,BOOK X,"The riches of a continent, a prize"
15880,BOOK X,Greater than earth had ever known; for there
15881,BOOK X,Not only ruby and pearl like ocean-beaches
15882,BOOK X,Heaped on some wizard coast in that dim hull
15883,BOOK X,Blazed to the lanthorn-light; not only gold
15884,BOOK X,"Gleamed, though of gold a million would not buy"
15885,BOOK X,Her store; but in her cabin lay the charts
15886,BOOK X,And secrets of the wild unwhispered wealth
15887,BOOK X,"Of India, secrets that splashed London wharves"
15888,BOOK X,With coloured dreams and made her misty streets
15889,BOOK X,Flame like an Eastern City when the sun
15890,BOOK X,Shatters itself on jewelled domes and spills
15891,BOOK X,Its crimson wreckage thro' the silvery palms.
15892,BOOK X,And of those dreams the far East India quest
15893,BOOK X,Began: the first foundation-stone was laid
15894,BOOK X,"Of our great Indian Empire, and a star"
15895,BOOK X,Began to tremble on the brows of England
15896,BOOK X,That time can never darken.
15897,BOOK X,But now the seas
15898,BOOK X,Darkened indeed with menace; now at last
15899,BOOK X,The cold wind of the black approaching wings
15900,BOOK X,Of Azrael crept across the deep: the storm
15901,BOOK X,"Throbbed with their thunderous pulse, and ere that moon"
15902,BOOK X,"Waned, a swift gunboat foamed into the Sound"
15903,BOOK X,With word that all the Invincible Armada
15904,BOOK X,Was hoisting sail for England.
15905,BOOK X,"Even now,"
15906,BOOK X,"Elizabeth, torn a thousand ways, withheld"
15907,BOOK X,"The word for which Drake pleaded as for life,"
15908,BOOK X,"That he might meet them ere they left their coasts,"
15909,BOOK X,"Meet them or ever they reached the Channel, meet them"
15910,BOOK X,"Now, or--""Too late! Too late!"" At last his voice"
15911,BOOK X,Beat down e'en those that blindly dinned her ears
15912,BOOK X,With chatter of meeting Spain on British soil;
15913,BOOK X,And swiftly she commanded (seeing once more
15914,BOOK X,The light that burned amid the approaching gloom
15915,BOOK X,"In Drake's deep eyes) Lord Howard of Effingham,"
15916,BOOK X,"High Admiral of England, straight to join him"
15917,BOOK X,"At Plymouth Sound. ""How many ships are wanted?"""
15918,BOOK X,"She asked him, thinking ""we are few, indeed!"""
15919,BOOK X,"""Give me but sixteen merchantmen,"" he said,"
15920,BOOK X,"""And but four battleships, by the mercy of God,"
15921,BOOK X,"I'll answer for the Armada!"" Out to sea"
15922,BOOK X,"They swept, in the teeth of a gale; but vainly Drake"
15923,BOOK X,Strove to impart the thought wherewith his mind
15924,BOOK X,Travailed--to win command of the ocean-sea
15925,BOOK X,By bursting on the fleets of Spain at once
15926,BOOK X,"Even as they left their ports, not as of old"
15927,BOOK X,To hover in a vain dream of defence
15928,BOOK X,"Round fifty threatened points of British coast,"
15929,BOOK X,"But Howard, clinging to his old-world order,"
15930,BOOK X,"Flung out his ships in a loose, long, straggling line"
15931,BOOK X,"Across the Channel, waiting, wary, alert,"
15932,BOOK X,But powerless thus as a string of scattered sea-gulls
15933,BOOK X,"Beating against the storm. Then, flying to meet them,"
15934,BOOK X,"A merchantman brought terror down the wind,"
15935,BOOK X,With news that she had seen that monstrous host
15936,BOOK X,"Stretching from sky to sky, great hulks of doom,"
15937,BOOK X,Dragging death's midnight with them o'er the sea
15938,BOOK X,Tow'rds England. Up to Howard's flag-ship Drake
15939,BOOK X,"In his immortal battle-ship--_Revenge_,"
15940,BOOK X,"Rushed thro' the foam, and thro' the swirling seas"
15941,BOOK X,His pinnace dashed alongside. On to the decks
15942,BOOK X,"O' the tossing flag-ship, like a very Viking"
15943,BOOK X,Shaking the surf and rainbows of the spray
15944,BOOK X,From sun-smit lion-like mane and beard he stood
15945,BOOK X,Before Lord Howard in the escutcheoned poop
15946,BOOK X,And poured his heart out like the rending sea
15947,BOOK X,In passionate wave on wave:
15948,BOOK X,"""If yonder fleet"
15949,BOOK X,"Once reach the Channel, hardly the mercy of God"
15950,BOOK X,"Saves England! I would pray with my last breath,"
15951,BOOK X,"Let us beat up to windward of them now,"
15952,BOOK X,"And handle them before they reach the Channel."""
15953,BOOK X,"""Nay; but we cannot bare the coast,"" cried Howard,"
15954,BOOK X,"""Nor have we stores of powder or food enough!"""
15955,BOOK X,"""My lord,"" said Drake, with his great arm outstretched,"
15956,BOOK X,"""There is food enough in yonder enemy's ships,"
15957,BOOK X,And powder enough and cannon-shot enough!
15958,BOOK X,"We must re-victual there. Look! look!"" he cried,"
15959,BOOK X,And pointed to the heavens. As for a soul
15960,BOOK X,That by sheer force of will compels the world
15961,BOOK X,"To work his bidding, so it seemed the wind"
15962,BOOK X,That blew against them slowly veered. The sails
15963,BOOK X,"Quivered, the skies revolved. A northerly breeze"
15964,BOOK X,"Awoke and now, behind the British ships,"
15965,BOOK X,Blew steadily tow'rds the unseen host of Spain.
15966,BOOK X,"""It is the breath of God,"" cried Drake; ""they lie"
15967,BOOK X,"Wind-bound, and we may work our will with them."
15968,BOOK X,"Signal the word, Lord Howard, and drive down!"""
15969,BOOK X,And as a man convinced by heaven itself
15970,BOOK X,"Lord Howard ordered, straightway, the whole fleet"
15971,BOOK X,To advance.
15972,BOOK X,"And now, indeed, as Drake foresaw,"
15973,BOOK X,"The Armada lay, beyond the dim horizon,"
15974,BOOK X,"Wind-bound and helpless in Corunna bay,"
15975,BOOK X,"At England's mercy, could her fleet but draw"
15976,BOOK X,"Nigh enough, with its fire-ships and great guns"
15977,BOOK X,"To windward. Nearer, nearer, league by league"
15978,BOOK X,The ships of England came: till Ushant lay
15979,BOOK X,"Some seventy leagues behind. Then, yet once more"
15980,BOOK X,"The wind veered, straight against them. To remain"
15981,BOOK X,Beating against it idly was to starve:
15982,BOOK X,"And, as a man whose power upon the world"
15983,BOOK X,"Fails for one moment of exhausted will,"
15984,BOOK X,"Drake, gathering up his forces as he went"
15985,BOOK X,"For one more supreme effort, turned his ship"
15986,BOOK X,"Tow'rds Plymouth, and retreated with the rest."
15987,BOOK X,
15988,BOOK X,"There, while the ships refitted with all haste"
15989,BOOK X,"And axe and hammer rang, one golden eve"
15990,BOOK X,Just as the setting sun began to fringe
15991,BOOK X,"The clouds with crimson, and the creaming waves"
15992,BOOK X,"Were one wild riot of fairy rainbows, Drake"
15993,BOOK X,Stood with old comrades on the close-cropped green
15994,BOOK X,"Of Plymouth Hoe, playing a game of bowls."
15995,BOOK X,"Far off unseen, a little barque, full-sail,"
15996,BOOK X,"Struggled and leapt and strove tow'rds Plymouth Sound,"
15997,BOOK X,Noteless as any speckled herring-gull
15998,BOOK X,Flickering between the white flakes of the waves.
15999,BOOK X,A group of schoolboys with their satchels lay
16000,BOOK X,"Stretched on the green, gazing with great wide eyes"
16001,BOOK X,"Upon their seamen heroes, as like gods"
16002,BOOK X,Disporting with the battles of the world
16003,BOOK X,"They loomed, tossing black bowls like cannon-balls"
16004,BOOK X,"Against the rosy West, or lounged at ease"
16005,BOOK X,With faces olive-dark against that sky
16006,BOOK X,"Laughing, while from the neighboring inn mine host,"
16007,BOOK X,"White aproned and blue-jerkined, hurried out"
16008,BOOK X,"With foaming cups of sack, and they drank deep,"
16009,BOOK X,Tossing their heads back under the golden clouds
16010,BOOK X,And burying their bearded lips. The hues
16011,BOOK X,"That slashed their doublets, for the boy's bright eyes"
16012,BOOK X,(Even as the gleams of Grecian cloud or moon
16013,BOOK X,Revealed the old gods) were here rich dusky streaks
16014,BOOK X,"Of splendour from the Spanish Main, that shone"
16015,BOOK X,But to proclaim these heroes. There a boy
16016,BOOK X,More bold crept nearer to a slouched hat thrown
16017,BOOK X,"Upon the green, and touched the silver plume,"
16018,BOOK X,And felt as if he had touched a sunset-isle
16019,BOOK X,Of feathery palms beyond a crimson sea.
16020,BOOK X,
16021,BOOK X,Another stared at the blue rings of smoke
16022,BOOK X,A storm-scarred seaman puffed from a long pipe
16023,BOOK X,Primed with the strange new herb they had lately found
16024,BOOK X,In far Virginia. But the little ship
16025,BOOK X,Now plunging into Plymouth Bay none saw.
16026,BOOK X,E'en when she had anchored and her straining boat
16027,BOOK X,"Had touched the land, and the boat's crew over the quays"
16028,BOOK X,"Leapt with a shout, scarce was there one to heed."
16029,BOOK X,"A seaman, smiling, swaggered out of the inn"
16030,BOOK X,Swinging in one brown hand a gleaming cage
16031,BOOK X,Wherein a big green parrot chattered and clung
16032,BOOK X,Fluttering against the wires. A troop of girls
16033,BOOK X,With arms linked paused to watch the game of bowls;
16034,BOOK X,"And now they flocked around the cage, while one"
16035,BOOK X,With rosy finger tempted the horny beak
16036,BOOK X,To bite. Close overhead a sea-mew flashed
16037,BOOK X,"Seaward. Once, from an open window, soft"
16038,BOOK X,"Through trellised leaves, not far away, a voice"
16039,BOOK X,"Floated, a voice that flushed the cheek of Drake,"
16040,BOOK X,"The voice of Bess, bending her glossy head"
16041,BOOK X,"Over the broidery frame, in a quiet song."
16042,BOOK X,
16043,BOOK X,"The song ceased. Still, with rainbows in their eyes,"
16044,BOOK X,The schoolboys watched the bowls like cannon-balls
16045,BOOK X,Roll from the hand of gods along the turf.
16046,BOOK X,
16047,BOOK X,"Suddenly, tow'rds the green, a little cloud"
16048,BOOK X,"Of seamen, shouting, stumbling, as they ran"
16049,BOOK X,Drew all eyes on them. The game ceased. A voice
16050,BOOK X,Rough with the storms of many an ocean roared
16051,BOOK X,"""Drake! Cap'en Drake! The Armada!"
16052,BOOK X,They are in the Channel! We sighted them--
16053,BOOK X,A line of battleships! We could not see
16054,BOOK X,An end of them. They stretch from north to south
16055,BOOK X,"Like a great storm of clouds, glinting with guns,"
16056,BOOK X,"From sky to sky!"""
16057,BOOK X,"So, after all his strife,"
16058,BOOK X,"The wasted weeks had tripped him, the fierce hours"
16059,BOOK X,"Of pleading for the sea's command, great hours"
16060,BOOK X,"And golden moments, all were lost. The fleet"
16061,BOOK X,Of Spain had won the Channel without a blow.
16062,BOOK X,
16063,BOOK X,"All eyes were turned on Drake, as he stood there"
16064,BOOK X,A giant against the sunset and the sea
16065,BOOK X,"Looming, alone. Far off, the first white star"
16066,BOOK X,Gleamed in a rosy space of heaven. He tossed
16067,BOOK X,"A grim black ball i' the lustrous air and laughed,--"
16068,BOOK X,"""Come lads,"" he said, ""we've time to finish the game."""
16069,BOOK X,
16070,BOOK X,
16071,BOOK XI,BOOK XI
16072,BOOK XI,
16073,BOOK XI,"Few minutes, and well wasted those, were spent"
16074,BOOK XI,On that great game of bowls; for well knew Drake
16075,BOOK XI,"What panic threatened Plymouth, since his fleet"
16076,BOOK XI,Lay trapped there by the black head-wind that blew
16077,BOOK XI,"Straight up the Sound, and Plymouth town itself,"
16078,BOOK XI,"Except the ships won seaward ere the dawn,"
16079,BOOK XI,Lay at the Armada's mercy. Never a seaman
16080,BOOK XI,"Of all the sea-dogs clustered on the quays,"
16081,BOOK XI,"And all the captains clamouring round Lord Howard,"
16082,BOOK XI,Hoped that one ship might win to the open sea:
16083,BOOK XI,"At dawn, they thought, the Armada's rolling guns"
16084,BOOK XI,"To windward, in an hour, must shatter them,"
16085,BOOK XI,Huddled in their red slaughter-house like sheep.
16086,BOOK XI,
16087,BOOK XI,Now was the great sun sunken and the night
16088,BOOK XI,"Dark. Far to Westward, like the soul of man"
16089,BOOK XI,"Fighting blind nature, a wild flare of red"
16090,BOOK XI,Upon some windy headland suddenly leapt
16091,BOOK XI,And vanished flickering into the clouds. Again
16092,BOOK XI,It leapt and vanished: then all at once it streamed
16093,BOOK XI,Steadily as a crimson torch upheld
16094,BOOK XI,By Titan hands to heaven. It was the first
16095,BOOK XI,Beacon! A sudden silence swept along
16096,BOOK XI,"The seething quays, and in their midst appeared"
16097,BOOK XI,Drake.
16098,BOOK XI,Then the jubilant thunder of his voice
16099,BOOK XI,"Rolled, buffeting the sea-wind far and nigh,"
16100,BOOK XI,And ere they knew what power as of a sea
16101,BOOK XI,"Surged through them, his immortal battle-ship"
16102,BOOK XI,"_Revenge_ had flung out cables to the quays,"
16103,BOOK XI,"And while the seamen, as he had commanded,"
16104,BOOK XI,"Knotted thick ropes together, he stood apart"
16105,BOOK XI,(For well he knew what panic threatened still)
16106,BOOK XI,"Whittling idly at a scrap of wood,"
16107,BOOK XI,And carved a little boat out for the child
16108,BOOK XI,Of some old sea-companion.
16109,BOOK XI,So great and calm a master of the world
16110,BOOK XI,"Seemed Drake that, as he whittled, and the chips"
16111,BOOK XI,"Fluttered into the blackness over the quay,"
16112,BOOK XI,Men said that in this hour of England's need
16113,BOOK XI,Each tiny flake turned to a battle-ship;
16114,BOOK XI,"For now began the lanthorns, one by one,"
16115,BOOK XI,"To glitter, and half-reveal the shadowy hulks"
16116,BOOK XI,"Before him.--So the huge old legend grew,"
16117,BOOK XI,Not all unworthy the Homeric age
16118,BOOK XI,Of gods and god-like men.
16119,BOOK XI,"St. Michael's Mount,"
16120,BOOK XI,"Answering the first wild beacon far away,"
16121,BOOK XI,Rolled crimson thunders to the stormy sky!
16122,BOOK XI,The ropes were knotted. Through the panting dark
16123,BOOK XI,Great heaving lines of seamen all together
16124,BOOK XI,"Hauled with a shout, and all together again"
16125,BOOK XI,Hauled with a shout against the roaring wind;
16126,BOOK XI,"And slowly, slowly, onward tow'rds the sea"
16127,BOOK XI,"Moved the _Revenge_, and seaward ever heaved"
16128,BOOK XI,"The brawny backs together, and in their midst,"
16129,BOOK XI,"Suddenly, as they slackened, Drake was there"
16130,BOOK XI,"Hauling like any ten, and with his heart"
16131,BOOK XI,"Doubling the strength of all, giving them joy"
16132,BOOK XI,"Of battle against those odds,--ay, till they found"
16133,BOOK XI,Delight in the burning tingle of the blood
16134,BOOK XI,That even their hardy hands must feel besmear
16135,BOOK XI,"The harsh, rough, straining ropes. There as they toiled,"
16136,BOOK XI,"Answering a score of hills, old Beachy Head"
16137,BOOK XI,Streamed like a furnace to the rolling clouds
16138,BOOK XI,Then all around the coast each windy ness
16139,BOOK XI,And craggy mountain kindled. Peak from peak
16140,BOOK XI,"Caught the tremendous fire, and passed it on"
16141,BOOK XI,"Round the bluff East and the black mouth of Thames,--"
16142,BOOK XI,"Up, northward to the waste wild Yorkshire fells"
16143,BOOK XI,"And gloomy Cumberland, where, like a giant,"
16144,BOOK XI,"Great Skiddaw grasped the red tempestuous brand,"
16145,BOOK XI,And thrust it up against the reeling heavens.
16146,BOOK XI,"Then all night long, inland, the wandering winds"
16147,BOOK XI,Ran wild with clamour and clash of startled bells;
16148,BOOK XI,"All night the cities seethed with torches, flashed"
16149,BOOK XI,With twenty thousand flames of burnished steel;
16150,BOOK XI,While over the trample and thunder of hooves blazed forth
16151,BOOK XI,The lightning of wild trumpets. Lonely lanes
16152,BOOK XI,"Of country darkness, lit by cottage doors"
16153,BOOK XI,"Entwined with rose and honeysuckle, roared"
16154,BOOK XI,"Like mountain-torrents now--East, West, and South,"
16155,BOOK XI,As to the coasts with pike and musket streamed
16156,BOOK XI,"The trained bands, horse and foot, from every town"
16157,BOOK XI,And every hamlet. All the shaggy hills
16158,BOOK XI,"From Milford Haven to the Downs of Kent,"
16159,BOOK XI,"And up to Humber, gleamed with many a hedge"
16160,BOOK XI,Of pikes between the beacon's crimson glares;
16161,BOOK XI,"While in red London forty thousand men,"
16162,BOOK XI,"In case the Invader should prevail, drew swords"
16163,BOOK XI,"Around their Queen. All night in dark St. Paul's,"
16164,BOOK XI,While round it rolled a multitudinous roar
16165,BOOK XI,"As of the Atlantic on a Western beach,"
16166,BOOK XI,And all the leaning London streets were lit
16167,BOOK XI,"With fury of torches, rose the passionate prayer"
16168,BOOK XI,Of England's peril:
16169,BOOK XI,"_O Lord God of Hosts,"
16170,BOOK XI,Let Thine enemies know that Thou hast taken
16171,BOOK XI,England into Thine hands!_
16172,BOOK XI,The mighty sound
16173,BOOK XI,"Rolled, billowing round the kneeling aisles, then died,"
16174,BOOK XI,"Echoing up the heights. A voice, far off,"
16175,BOOK XI,"As on the cross of Calvary, caught it up"
16176,BOOK XI,"And poured the prayer o'er that deep hush, alone:"
16177,BOOK XI,"_We beseech Thee, O God, to go before our armies,"
16178,BOOK XI,Bless and prosper them both by land and sea!
16179,BOOK XI,"Grant unto them Thy victory, O God,"
16180,BOOK XI,As Thou usedst to do to Thy children when they please Thee!
16181,BOOK XI,"All power, all strength, all victory come from Thee!_"
16182,BOOK XI,Then from the lips of all those thousands burst
16183,BOOK XI,"A sound as from the rent heart of an ocean,"
16184,BOOK XI,"One tumult, one great rushing storm of wings"
16185,BOOK XI,Cleaving the darkness round the Gates of Heaven:
16186,BOOK XI,_Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses;
16187,BOOK XI,"But we will remember Thy name, O Lord our God!_"
16188,BOOK XI,
16189,BOOK XI,"So, while at Plymouth Sound her seamen toiled"
16190,BOOK XI,"All through the night, and scarce a ship had won"
16191,BOOK XI,"Seaward, the heart of England cried to God."
16192,BOOK XI,"All night, while trumpets yelled and blared without,"
16193,BOOK XI,"And signal cannon shook the blazoned panes,"
16194,BOOK XI,"And billowing multitudes went thundering by,"
16195,BOOK XI,Amid that solemn pillared hush arose
16196,BOOK XI,From lips of kneeling thousands one great prayer
16197,BOOK XI,"Storming the Gates of Heaven! _O Lord, our God,"
16198,BOOK XI,"Heavenly Father, have mercy upon our Queen,"
16199,BOOK XI,To whom Thy far dispersed flock do fly
16200,BOOK XI,"In the anguish of their souls. Behold, behold,"
16201,BOOK XI,"How many princes band themselves against her,"
16202,BOOK XI,"How long Thy servant hath laboured to them for peace,"
16203,BOOK XI,How proudly they prepare themselves for battle!
16204,BOOK XI,"Arise, therefore! Maintain Thine own cause,"
16205,BOOK XI,Judge Thou between her and her enemies!
16206,BOOK XI,"She seeketh not her own honour, but Thine,"
16207,BOOK XI,"Not the dominions of others, but Thy truth,"
16208,BOOK XI,Not bloodshed but the saving of the afflicted!
16209,BOOK XI,"O rend the heavens, therefore, and come down."
16210,BOOK XI,Deliver Thy people!
16211,BOOK XI,"To vanquish is all one with Thee, by few"
16212,BOOK XI,"Or many, ward or wealth, weakness or strength."
16213,BOOK XI,"The cause is Thine, the enemies Thine, the afflicted"
16214,BOOK XI,"Thine! The honour, victory, and triumph"
16215,BOOK XI,"Thine! Grant her people now one heart, one mind,"
16216,BOOK XI,One strength. Give unto her councils and her captains
16217,BOOK XI,Wisdom and courage strongly to withstand
16218,BOOK XI,"The forces of her enemies, that the fame"
16219,BOOK XI,And glory of Thy Kingdom may be spread
16220,BOOK XI,"Unto the ends of the world. Father, we crave"
16221,BOOK XI,"This in Thy mercy, for the precious death"
16222,BOOK XI,"Of Thy dear Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ!"
16223,BOOK XI,Amen._
16224,BOOK XI,"And as the dreadful dawn thro' mist-wreaths broke,"
16225,BOOK XI,"And out of Plymouth Sound at last, with cheers"
16226,BOOK XI,"Ringing from many a thousand throats, there struggled"
16227,BOOK XI,"Six little ships, all that the night's long toil"
16228,BOOK XI,Had warped down to the sea (but leading them
16229,BOOK XI,The ship of Drake) there rose one ocean-cry
16230,BOOK XI,"From all those worshippers--_Let God arise,"
16231,BOOK XI,And let His enemies be scattered!_
16232,BOOK XI,
16233,BOOK XI,"Under the leaden fogs of that new dawn,"
16234,BOOK XI,"Empty and cold, indifferent as death,"
16235,BOOK XI,"The sea heaved strangely to the seamen's eyes,"
16236,BOOK XI,Seeing all round them only the leaden surge
16237,BOOK XI,Wrapped in wet mists or flashing here and there
16238,BOOK XI,With crumbling white. Against the cold wet wind
16239,BOOK XI,Westward the little ships of England beat
16240,BOOK XI,"With short tacks, close inshore, striving to win"
16241,BOOK XI,The windward station of the threatening battle
16242,BOOK XI,"That neared behind the veil. Six little ships,"
16243,BOOK XI,"No more, beat Westward, even as all mankind"
16244,BOOK XI,Beats up against that universal wind
16245,BOOK XI,Whereon like withered leaves all else is blown
16246,BOOK XI,"Down one wide way to death: the soul alone,"
16247,BOOK XI,"Whether at last it wins, or faints and fails,"
16248,BOOK XI,Stems the dark tide with its intrepid sails.
16249,BOOK XI,"Close-hauled, with many a short tack, struggled and strained,"
16250,BOOK XI,"North-west, South-west, the ships; but ever Westward gained"
16251,BOOK XI,"Some little way with every tack; and soon,"
16252,BOOK XI,"While the prows plunged beneath the grey-gold noon,"
16253,BOOK XI,"Lapped by the crackling waves, even as the wind"
16254,BOOK XI,"Died down a little, in the mists behind"
16255,BOOK XI,Stole out from Plymouth Sound the struggling score
16256,BOOK XI,Of ships that might not win last night to sea.
16257,BOOK XI,"They followed; but the Six went on before,"
16258,BOOK XI,"Not knowing, alone, for God and Liberty."
16259,BOOK XI,
16260,BOOK XI,"Now, as they tacked North-west, the sullen roar"
16261,BOOK XI,"Of reefs crept out, or some strange tinkling sound"
16262,BOOK XI,Of sheep upon the hills. South-west once more
16263,BOOK XI,The bo'sun's whistle swung their bowsprits round;
16264,BOOK XI,South-west until the long low lapping splash
16265,BOOK XI,"Was all they heard, of keels that still ran out"
16266,BOOK XI,"Seaward, then with one muffled heave and crash"
16267,BOOK XI,Once more the whistles brought their sails about.
16268,BOOK XI,
16269,BOOK XI,And now the noon began to wane; the west
16270,BOOK XI,"With slow rich colours filled and shadowy forms,"
16271,BOOK XI,"Dark curdling wreaths and fogs with crimsoned breast,"
16272,BOOK XI,"And tangled zones of dusk like frozen storms,"
16273,BOOK XI,
16274,BOOK XI,"Motionless, flagged with sunset, hulled with doom!"
16275,BOOK XI,"Motionless? Nay, across the darkening deep"
16276,BOOK XI,Surely the whole sky moved its gorgeous gloom
16277,BOOK XI,Onward; and like the curtains of a sleep
16278,BOOK XI,
16279,BOOK XI,"The red fogs crumbled, mists dissolved away!"
16280,BOOK XI,"There, like death's secret dawning thro' a dream,"
16281,BOOK XI,"Great thrones of thunder dusked the dying day,"
16282,BOOK XI,"And, higher, pale towers of cloud began to gleam."
16283,BOOK XI,
16284,BOOK XI,"There, in one heaven-wide storm, great masts and clouds"
16285,BOOK XI,"Of sail crept slowly forth, the ships of Spain!"
16286,BOOK XI,"From North to South, their tangled spars and shrouds"
16287,BOOK XI,Controlled the slow wind as with bit and rein;
16288,BOOK XI,Onward they rode in insolent disdain
16289,BOOK XI,"Sighting the little fleet of England there,"
16290,BOOK XI,While o'er the sullen splendour of the main
16291,BOOK XI,"Three solemn guns tolled all their host to prayer,"
16292,BOOK XI,And their great ensign blazoned all the doom-fraught air.
16293,BOOK XI,
16294,BOOK XI,The sacred standard of their proud crusade
16295,BOOK XI,Up to the mast-head of their flag-ship soared:
16296,BOOK XI,"On one side knelt the Holy Mother-maid,"
16297,BOOK XI,On one the crucified Redeemer poured
16298,BOOK XI,"His blood, and all their kneeling hosts adored"
16299,BOOK XI,"Their saints, and clouds of incense heavenward streamed,"
16300,BOOK XI,While pomp of cannonry and pike and sword
16301,BOOK XI,"Down long sea-lanes of mocking menace gleamed,"
16302,BOOK XI,And chant of priests rolled out o'er seas that darkly dreamed.
16303,BOOK XI,
16304,BOOK XI,"_Who comes to fight for England?_ Is it ye,"
16305,BOOK XI,Six little straws that dance upon the foam?
16306,BOOK XI,"Ay, sweeping o'er the sunset-crimsoned sea"
16307,BOOK XI,"Let the proud pageant in its glory come,"
16308,BOOK XI,Leaving the sunset like a hecatomb
16309,BOOK XI,Of souls whose bodies yet endure the chain!
16310,BOOK XI,"Let slaves, by thousands, branded, scarred and dumb,"
16311,BOOK XI,"In those dark galleys grip their oars again,"
16312,BOOK XI,And o'er the rolling deep bring on the pomp of Spain;--
16313,BOOK XI,
16314,BOOK XI,Bring on the pomp of royal paladins
16315,BOOK XI,(For all the princedoms of the land are there!)
16316,BOOK XI,And for the gorgeous purple of their sins
16317,BOOK XI,The papal pomp bring on with psalm and prayer:
16318,BOOK XI,Nearer the splendour heaves; can ye not hear
16319,BOOK XI,"The rushing foam, not see the blazoned arms,"
16320,BOOK XI,And black-faced hosts thro' leagues of golden air
16321,BOOK XI,"Crowding the decks, muttering their beads and charms"
16322,BOOK XI,"To where, in furthest heaven, they thicken like locust-swarms?"
16323,BOOK XI,
16324,BOOK XI,"Bring on the pomp and pride of old Castille,"
16325,BOOK XI,"Blazon the skies with royal Aragon,"
16326,BOOK XI,Beneath Oquendo let old ocean reel.
16327,BOOK XI,The purple pomp of priestly Rome bring on;
16328,BOOK XI,"And let her censers dusk the dying sun,"
16329,BOOK XI,The thunder of her banners on the breeze
16330,BOOK XI,Following Sidonia's glorious galleon
16331,BOOK XI,"Deride the sleeping thunder of the seas,"
16332,BOOK XI,While twenty thousand warriors chant her litanies.
16333,BOOK XI,
16334,BOOK XI,"Lo, all their decks are kneeling! Sky to sky"
16335,BOOK XI,Responds! It is their solemn evening hour.
16336,BOOK XI,"Salve Regina, though the daylight die,"
16337,BOOK XI,"Salve Regina, though the darkness lour;"
16338,BOOK XI,Have they not still the kingdom and the power?
16339,BOOK XI,"Salve Regina, hark, their thousands cry,"
16340,BOOK XI,From where like clouds to where like mountains tower
16341,BOOK XI,"Their crowded galleons looming far or nigh,"
16342,BOOK XI,"Salve Regina, hark, what distant seas reply!"
16343,BOOK XI,
16344,BOOK XI,"What distant seas, what distant ages hear?"
16345,BOOK XI,Bring on the pomp! the sun of Spain goes down:
16346,BOOK XI,The moon but swells the tide of praise and prayer;
16347,BOOK XI,Bring on the world-wide pomp of her renown;
16348,BOOK XI,"Let darkness crown her with a starrier crown,"
16349,BOOK XI,And let her watch the fierce waves crouch and fawn
16350,BOOK XI,"Round those huge hulks from which her cannon frown,"
16351,BOOK XI,While close inshore the wet sea-mists are drawn
16352,BOOK XI,"Round England's Drake: then wait, in triumph, for the dawn."
16353,BOOK XI,
16354,BOOK XI,The sun of Rome goes down; the night is dark!
16355,BOOK XI,"Still are her thousands praying, still their cry"
16356,BOOK XI,"Ascends from the wide waste of waters, hark!"
16357,BOOK XI,"AVE MARIA, darker grows the sky!"
16358,BOOK XI,"AVE MARIA, _those about to die"
16359,BOOK XI,"Salute thee_! Nay, what wandering winds blaspheme"
16360,BOOK XI,With random gusts of chilling prophecy
16361,BOOK XI,Against the solemn sounds that heavenward stream!
16362,BOOK XI,The night is come at last. Break not the splendid dream.
16363,BOOK XI,
16364,BOOK XI,"But through the misty darkness, close inshore,"
16365,BOOK XI,"North-west, South-west, and ever Westward strained"
16366,BOOK XI,"The little ships of England. All night long,"
16367,BOOK XI,"As down the coast the reddening beacons leapt,"
16368,BOOK XI,"The crackle and lapping splash of tacking keels,"
16369,BOOK XI,The bo'suns' low sharp whistles and the whine
16370,BOOK XI,"Of ropes, mixing with many a sea-bird's cry"
16371,BOOK XI,"Disturbed the darkness, waking vague swift fears"
16372,BOOK XI,Among the mighty hulks of Spain that lay
16373,BOOK XI,"Nearest, then fading through the mists inshore"
16374,BOOK XI,"North-west, then growing again, but farther down"
16375,BOOK XI,Their ranks to Westward with each dark return
16376,BOOK XI,"And dark departure, till the rearmost rank"
16377,BOOK XI,Of grim sea-castles heard the swish and creak
16378,BOOK XI,Pass plashing seaward thro' the wet sea-mists
16379,BOOK XI,"To windward now of all that monstrous host,"
16380,BOOK XI,Then heard no more than wandering sea-birds' cries
16381,BOOK XI,"Wheeling around their leagues of lanthorn-light,"
16382,BOOK XI,"Or heave of waters, waiting for the dawn."
16383,BOOK XI,
16384,BOOK XI,"Dawn, everlasting and almighty dawn"
16385,BOOK XI,Rolled o'er the waters. The grey mists were fled.
16386,BOOK XI,"See, in their reeking heaven-wide crescent drawn"
16387,BOOK XI,"Those masts and spars and cloudy sails, outspread"
16388,BOOK XI,"Like one great sulphurous tempest soaked with red,"
16389,BOOK XI,In vain withstand the march of brightening skies:
16390,BOOK XI,"The dawn sweeps onward and the night is dead,"
16391,BOOK XI,"And lo, to windward, what bright menace lies,"
16392,BOOK XI,What glory kindles now in England's wakening eyes?
16393,BOOK XI,
16394,BOOK XI,"There, on the glittering plains of open sea,"
16395,BOOK XI,"To windward now, behind the fleets of Spain,"
16396,BOOK XI,"Two little files of ships are tossing free,"
16397,BOOK XI,Free of the winds and of the wind-swept main:
16398,BOOK XI,"Were they not trapped? Who brought them forth again,"
16399,BOOK XI,"Free of the great new fields of England's war,"
16400,BOOK XI,"With sails like blossoms shining after rain,"
16401,BOOK XI,And guns that sparkle to the morning star?
16402,BOOK XI,Drake!--first upon the deep that rolls to Trafalgar!
16403,BOOK XI,
16404,BOOK XI,"And Spain knows well that flag of fiery fame,"
16405,BOOK XI,Spain knows who leads those files across the sea;
16406,BOOK XI,"Implacable, invincible, his name"
16407,BOOK XI,"_El Draque_, creeps hissing through her ranks to lee;"
16408,BOOK XI,"But now she holds the rolling heavens in fee,"
16409,BOOK XI,"His ships are few. _They surge across the foam,"
16410,BOOK XI,The hunt is up!_ But need the mountains flee
16411,BOOK XI,Or fear the snarling wolf-pack? Let them come!
16412,BOOK XI,"They crouch, but dare not leap upon the flanks of Rome."
16413,BOOK XI,
16414,BOOK XI,"Nearer they come and nearer! Nay, prepare!"
16415,BOOK XI,Close your huge ranks that sweep from sky to sky!
16416,BOOK XI,Madness itself would shrink; but Drake will dare
16417,BOOK XI,Eternal hell! Let the great signal fly--
16418,BOOK XI,Close up your ranks; El Draque comes down to die!
16419,BOOK XI,El Draque is brave! The vast sea-cities loom
16420,BOOK XI,"Thro' heaven: Spain spares one smile of chivalry,"
16421,BOOK XI,One wintry smile across her cannons' gloom
16422,BOOK XI,As that frail fleet full-sail comes rushing tow'rds its doom.
16423,BOOK XI,
16424,BOOK XI,"Suddenly, as the wild change of a dream,"
16425,BOOK XI,Even as the Spaniards watched those lean sharp prows
16426,BOOK XI,"Leap straight at their huge hulks, watched well content,"
16427,BOOK XI,"Knowing their foes, once grappled, must be doomed;"
16428,BOOK XI,Even as they caught the rush and hiss of foam
16429,BOOK XI,"Across that narrow, dwindling gleam of sea,"
16430,BOOK XI,"And heard, abruptly close, the sharp commands"
16431,BOOK XI,"And steady British answers, caught one glimpse"
16432,BOOK XI,"Of bare-armed seamen waiting by their guns,"
16433,BOOK XI,The vision changed! The ships of England swerved
16434,BOOK XI,Swiftly--a volley of flame and thunder swept
16435,BOOK XI,"Blinding the buffeted air, a volley of iron"
16436,BOOK XI,"From four sheer broadsides, crashing thro' a hulk"
16437,BOOK XI,"Of Spain. She reeled, blind in the fiery surge"
16438,BOOK XI,And fury of that assault. So swift it seemed
16439,BOOK XI,"That as she heeled to leeward, ere her guns"
16440,BOOK XI,"Trained on the foe once more, the sulphurous cloud"
16441,BOOK XI,"That wrapped the sea, once, twice, and thrice again"
16442,BOOK XI,Split with red thunder-claps that rent and raked
16443,BOOK XI,"Her huge beams through and through. Ay, as she heeled"
16444,BOOK XI,"To leeward still, her own grim cannon belched"
16445,BOOK XI,"Their lava skyward, wounding the void air,"
16446,BOOK XI,"And, as by miracle, the ships of Drake"
16447,BOOK XI,Were gone. Along the Spanish rear they swept
16448,BOOK XI,"From North to South, raking them as they went"
16449,BOOK XI,"At close range, hardly a pistol-shot away,"
16450,BOOK XI,With volley on volley. Never Spain had seen
16451,BOOK XI,Seamen or marksmen like to these who sailed
16452,BOOK XI,"Two knots against her one. They came and went,"
16453,BOOK XI,Suddenly neared or sheered away at will
16454,BOOK XI,"As if by magic, pouring flame and iron"
16455,BOOK XI,In four full broadsides thro' some Spanish hulk
16456,BOOK XI,Ere one of hers burst blindly at the sky.
16457,BOOK XI,"Southward, along the Spanish rear they swept,"
16458,BOOK XI,"Then swung about, and volleying sheets of flame,"
16459,BOOK XI,"Iron, and death, along the same fierce road"
16460,BOOK XI,"Littered with spars, reeking with sulphurous fumes,"
16461,BOOK XI,"Returned, triumphantly rushing, all their sails"
16462,BOOK XI,"Alow, aloft, full-bellied with the wind."
16463,BOOK XI,
16464,BOOK XI,"Then, then, from sky to sky, one mighty surge"
16465,BOOK XI,"Of baleful pride, huge wrath, stormy disdain,"
16466,BOOK XI,With shuddering clouds and towers of sail would urge
16467,BOOK XI,"Onward the heaving citadels of Spain,"
16468,BOOK XI,"Which dragged earth's thunders o'er the groaning main,"
16469,BOOK XI,"And held the panoplies of faith in fee,"
16470,BOOK XI,"Beating against the wind, struggling in vain"
16471,BOOK XI,To close with that swift ocean-cavalry:
16472,BOOK XI,"Spain had all earth in charge! Had England, then, the sea?"
16473,BOOK XI,
16474,BOOK XI,Spain had the mountains--mountains flow like clouds.
16475,BOOK XI,Spain had great kingdoms--kingdoms melt away!
16476,BOOK XI,"Yet, in that crescent, army on army crowds,"
16477,BOOK XI,How shall she fear what seas or winds can say?--
16478,BOOK XI,"The seas that leap and shine round earth's decay,"
16479,BOOK XI,"The winds that mount and sing while empires fall,"
16480,BOOK XI,"And mountains pass like waves in the wind's way,"
16481,BOOK XI,And dying gods thro' shuddering twilights call.
16482,BOOK XI,"Had England, then, the sea that sweeps o'er one and all?"
16483,BOOK XI,
16484,BOOK XI,"See, in gigantic wrath the _Rata_ hurls"
16485,BOOK XI,Her mighty prows round to the wild sea-wind:
16486,BOOK XI,The deep like one black maelstrom round her swirls
16487,BOOK XI,While great Recaldé follows hard behind:
16488,BOOK XI,"Reeling, like Titans, thunder-blasted, blind,"
16489,BOOK XI,"They strive to cross the ships of England--yea,"
16490,BOOK XI,"Challenge them to the grapple, and only find"
16491,BOOK XI,"Red broadsides bursting o'er the bursting spray,"
16492,BOOK XI,And England surging still along her windward way!
16493,BOOK XI,
16494,BOOK XI,To windward still _Revenge_ and _Raleigh_ flash
16495,BOOK XI,"And thunder, and the sea flames red between:"
16496,BOOK XI,In vain against the wind the galleons crash
16497,BOOK XI,And plunge and pour blind volleys thro' the screen
16498,BOOK XI,Of rolling sulphurous clouds at dimly seen
16499,BOOK XI,"Topsails that, to and fro, like sea-birds fly!"
16500,BOOK XI,Ever to leeward the great hulks careen;
16501,BOOK XI,"Their thousand cannon can but wound the sky,"
16502,BOOK XI,While England's little _Rainbow_ foams and flashes by.
16503,BOOK XI,
16504,BOOK XI,"Suddenly the flag-ship of Recaldé, stung"
16505,BOOK XI,"To fury it seemed, heeled like an avalanche"
16506,BOOK XI,"To leeward, then reeled out beyond the rest"
16507,BOOK XI,"Against the wind, alone, daring the foe"
16508,BOOK XI,To grapple her. At once the little _Revenge_
16509,BOOK XI,"With Drake's flag flying flashed at her throat,"
16510,BOOK XI,And hardly a cable's-length away out-belched
16511,BOOK XI,"Broadside on broadside, under those great cannon,"
16512,BOOK XI,"Crashing through five-foot beams, four shots to one,"
16513,BOOK XI,While Howard and the rest swept to and fro
16514,BOOK XI,Keeping at deadly bay the rolling hulks
16515,BOOK XI,That looming like Leviathans now plunged
16516,BOOK XI,Desperately against the freshening wind
16517,BOOK XI,To rescue the great flag-ship where she lay
16518,BOOK XI,"Alone, amid the cannonades of Drake,"
16519,BOOK XI,"Alone, like a volcanic island lashed"
16520,BOOK XI,"With crimson hurricanes, dinning the winds"
16521,BOOK XI,"With isolated thunders, flaking the skies"
16522,BOOK XI,"With wrathful lava, while great spars and blocks"
16523,BOOK XI,"Leapt through the cloudy glare and fell, far off,"
16524,BOOK XI,Like small black stones into the hissing sea.
16525,BOOK XI,
16526,BOOK XI,Oquendo saw her peril far away!
16527,BOOK XI,"His rushing prow thro' heaven begins to loom,"
16528,BOOK XI,"Oquendo, first in all that proud array,"
16529,BOOK XI,Hath heart the pride of Spain to reassume:
16530,BOOK XI,He comes; the rolling seas are dusked with gloom
16531,BOOK XI,"Of his great sails! Now round him once again,"
16532,BOOK XI,"Thrust out your oars, ye mighty hulks of doom;"
16533,BOOK XI,"Forward, with hiss of whip and clank of chain!"
16534,BOOK XI,Let twice ten hundred slaves bring on the wrath of Spain!
16535,BOOK XI,
16536,BOOK XI,Sidonia comes! Toledo comes!--huge ranks
16537,BOOK XI,"That rally against the storm from sky to sky,"
16538,BOOK XI,As down the dark blood-rusted chain-locked planks
16539,BOOK XI,Of labouring galleys the dark slave-guards ply
16540,BOOK XI,"Their knotted scourges, and the red flakes fly"
16541,BOOK XI,"From bare scarred backs that quiver and heave once more,"
16542,BOOK XI,And slaves that heed not if they live or die
16543,BOOK XI,"Pull with numb arms at many a red-stained oar,"
16544,BOOK XI,Nor know the sea's dull crash from cannon's growing roar.
16545,BOOK XI,
16546,BOOK XI,Bring on the wrath! From heaven to rushing heaven
16547,BOOK XI,The white foam sweeps around their fierce array;
16548,BOOK XI,In vain before their shattering crimson levin
16549,BOOK XI,The ships of England flash and dart away:
16550,BOOK XI,Not England's heart can hold that host at bay!
16551,BOOK XI,"See, a swift signal shoots along her line,"
16552,BOOK XI,"Her ships are scattered, they fly, they fly like spray"
16553,BOOK XI,"Driven against the wind by wrath divine,"
16554,BOOK XI,"While, round Recaldé now, Sidonia's cannon shine."
16555,BOOK XI,
16556,BOOK XI,The wild sea-winds with golden trumpets blaze!
16557,BOOK XI,One wave will wash away the crimson stain
16558,BOOK XI,That blots Recaldé's decks. Her first amaze
16559,BOOK XI,Is over: down the Channel once again
16560,BOOK XI,Turns the triumphant pageantry of Spain
16561,BOOK XI,"In battle-order, now. Behind her, far,"
16562,BOOK XI,"While the broad sun sinks to the Western main,"
16563,BOOK XI,"Glitter the little ships of England's war,"
16564,BOOK XI,And over them in heaven glides out the first white star.
16565,BOOK XI,
16566,BOOK XI,The sun goes down: the heart of Spain is proud:
16567,BOOK XI,"Her censers fume, her golden trumpets blow!"
16568,BOOK XI,Into the darkening East with cloud on cloud
16569,BOOK XI,Of broad-flung sail her huge sea-castles go:
16570,BOOK XI,Rich under blazoned poops like rose-flushed snow
16571,BOOK XI,Tosses the foam. Far off the sunset gleams:
16572,BOOK XI,"Her banners like a thousand sunsets glow,"
16573,BOOK XI,"As down the darkening East the pageant streams,"
16574,BOOK XI,"Full-fraught with doom for England, rigged with princely dreams."
16575,BOOK XI,
16576,BOOK XI,"Nay, ""rigged with curses dark,"" as o'er the waves"
16577,BOOK XI,Drake watched them slowly sweeping into the gloom
16578,BOOK XI,"That thickened down the Channel, watched them go"
16579,BOOK XI,"In ranks compact, roundels impregnable,"
16580,BOOK XI,With Biscay's bristling broad-beamed squadron drawn
16581,BOOK XI,Behind for rear-guard. As the sun went down
16582,BOOK XI,Drake flew the council-flag. Across the sea
16583,BOOK XI,That gleamed still like a myriad-petalled rose
16584,BOOK XI,Up to the little _Revenge_ the pinnaces foamed.
16585,BOOK XI,
16586,BOOK XI,"There, on Drake's powder-grimed escutcheoned poop"
16587,BOOK XI,"They gathered, Admirals and great flag-captains,"
16588,BOOK XI,"Hawking, Frobisher, shining names and famous,"
16589,BOOK XI,And some content to serve and follow and fight
16590,BOOK XI,"Where duty called unknown, but heroes all."
16591,BOOK XI,"High on the poop they clustered, gazing East"
16592,BOOK XI,With faces dark as iron against the flame
16593,BOOK XI,"Of sunset, eagle-faces, iron lips,"
16594,BOOK XI,And keen eyes fiercely flashing as they turned
16595,BOOK XI,"Like sword-flames now, or dark and deep as night"
16596,BOOK XI,Watching the vast Armada slowly mix
16597,BOOK XI,Its broad-flung sails with twilight where it dragged
16598,BOOK XI,Thro' thickening heavens its curdled storms of clouds
16599,BOOK XI,Down the wide darkening Channel.
16600,BOOK XI,"""My Lord Howard,"""
16601,BOOK XI,"Said Drake, ""it seems we have but scarred the skins"
16602,BOOK XI,Of those huge hulks: the hour grows late for England.
16603,BOOK XI,"'Twere well to handle them again at once."" A growl"
16604,BOOK XI,Of fierce approval answered; but Lord Howard
16605,BOOK XI,"Cried out, ""Attack we cannot, save at risk"
16606,BOOK XI,"Of our whole fleet. It is not death I fear,"
16607,BOOK XI,"But England's peril. We have fought all day,"
16608,BOOK XI,Accomplished nothing. Half our powder is spent!
16609,BOOK XI,I think it best to hang upon their flanks
16610,BOOK XI,"Till we be reinforced."""
16611,BOOK XI,"""My lord,"" said Drake,"
16612,BOOK XI,"""Had we that week to spare for which I prayed,"
16613,BOOK XI,"And were we handling them in Spanish seas,"
16614,BOOK XI,We might delay. There is no choosing now.
16615,BOOK XI,Yon hulks of doom are steadfastly resolved
16616,BOOK XI,On one tremendous path and solid end--
16617,BOOK XI,To join their powers with Parma's thirty thousand
16618,BOOK XI,"(Not heeding our light horsemen of the sea),"
16619,BOOK XI,Then in one earthquake of o'erwhelming arms
16620,BOOK XI,Roll Europe over England. They've not grasped
16621,BOOK XI,The first poor thought which now and evermore
16622,BOOK XI,"Must be the sceptre of Britain, the steel trident"
16623,BOOK XI,Of ocean-sovereignty. That mighty fleet
16624,BOOK XI,"Invincible, impregnable, omnipotent,"
16625,BOOK XI,"Must here and now be shattered, never be joined"
16626,BOOK XI,"With Parma, never abase the wind-swept sea,"
16627,BOOK XI,With oaken roads for thundering legions
16628,BOOK XI,To trample in the splendour of the sun
16629,BOOK XI,From Europe to our island.
16630,BOOK XI,"As for food,"
16631,BOOK XI,In yonder enemy's fleet there is food enough
16632,BOOK XI,"To feed a nation; ay, and powder enough"
16633,BOOK XI,To split an empire. I will answer for it
16634,BOOK XI,"Ye shall not lack of either, nor for shot,"
16635,BOOK XI,Not though ye pluck them out of your own beams
16636,BOOK XI,To feed your hungry cannon. Cast your bread
16637,BOOK XI,Upon the waters. Think not of the Queen!
16638,BOOK XI,She will not send it! For she hath not known
16639,BOOK XI,"(How could she know?) this wide new realm of hers,"
16640,BOOK XI,When we ourselves--her seamen--scarce have learnt
16641,BOOK XI,What means this kingdom of the ocean-sea
16642,BOOK XI,"To England and her throne--food, life-blood, life!"
16643,BOOK XI,"She could not understand who, when our ships"
16644,BOOK XI,"Put out from Plymouth, hardly gave them store"
16645,BOOK XI,"Of powder and shot to last three fighting days,"
16646,BOOK XI,"Or rations even for those. Blame not the Queen,"
16647,BOOK XI,Who hath striven for England as no king hath fought
16648,BOOK XI,"Since England was a nation. Bear with me,"
16649,BOOK XI,For I must pour my heart before you now
16650,BOOK XI,This one last time. Yon fishing-boats have brought
16651,BOOK XI,Tidings how on this very day she rode
16652,BOOK XI,Before her mustered pikes at Tilbury.
16653,BOOK XI,Methinks I see her riding down their lines
16654,BOOK XI,"High on her milk-white Barbary charger, hear"
16655,BOOK XI,"Her voice--'My people, though my flesh be woman,"
16656,BOOK XI,My heart is of your kingly lion's breed:
16657,BOOK XI,I come myself to lead you!' I see the sun
16658,BOOK XI,"Shining upon her armour, hear the voice"
16659,BOOK XI,Of all her armies roaring like one sea--
16660,BOOK XI,"_God save Elizabeth, our English Queen!_"
16661,BOOK XI,"'God save her,' I say, too; but still she dreams,"
16662,BOOK XI,"As all too many of us--bear with me!--dream,"
16663,BOOK XI,"Of Crécy, when our England's war was thus;"
16664,BOOK XI,"When we, too, hurled our hosts across the deep"
16665,BOOK XI,As now Spain dreams to hurl them on our isle.
16666,BOOK XI,But now our war is otherwise. We claim
16667,BOOK XI,"The sea's command, and Spain shall never land"
16668,BOOK XI,"One swordsman on our island. Blame her not,"
16669,BOOK XI,But look not to the Queen. The people fight
16670,BOOK XI,"This war of ours, not princes. In this hour"
16671,BOOK XI,God maketh us a people. We have seen
16672,BOOK XI,"Victories, never victory like to this,"
16673,BOOK XI,When in our England's darkest hour of need
16674,BOOK XI,"Her seamen, without wage, powder, or food,"
16675,BOOK XI,Are yet on fire to fight for her. Your ships
16676,BOOK XI,"Tossing in the great sunset of an Empire,"
16677,BOOK XI,"Dawn of a sovereign people, are all manned"
16678,BOOK XI,"By heroes, raggèd, hungry, who will die"
16679,BOOK XI,"Like flies ere long, because they have no food"
16680,BOOK XI,But turns to fever-breeding carrion
16681,BOOK XI,"Not fit for dogs. They are half-naked, hopeless"
16682,BOOK XI,"Living, of any reward; and if they die"
16683,BOOK XI,They die a dog's death. We shall reap the fame
16684,BOOK XI,While they--great God! and all this cannot quench
16685,BOOK XI,The glory in their eyes. They will be served
16686,BOOK XI,"Six at the mess of four, eking it out"
16687,BOOK XI,"With what their own rude nets may catch by night,"
16688,BOOK XI,Silvering the guns and naked arms that haul
16689,BOOK XI,"Under the stars with silver past all price,"
16690,BOOK XI,While some small ship-boy in the black crow's nest
16691,BOOK XI,Watches across the waters for the foe.
16692,BOOK XI,"My lord, it is a terrible thing for Spain"
16693,BOOK XI,When poor men thus go out against her princes;
16694,BOOK XI,"For so God whispers 'Victory' in our ears,"
16695,BOOK XI,"I cannot dare to doubt it."""
16696,BOOK XI,
16697,BOOK XI,Once again
16698,BOOK XI,"A growl of fierce approval answered him,"
16699,BOOK XI,"And Hawkins cried--""I stand by Francis Drake"";"
16700,BOOK XI,"But Howard, clinging to his old-world order,"
16701,BOOK XI,Yet with such manly strength as dared to rank
16702,BOOK XI,"Drake's wisdom of the sea above his own,"
16703,BOOK XI,"Sturdily shook his head. ""I dare not risk"
16704,BOOK XI,A close attack. Once grappled we are doomed.
16705,BOOK XI,"We'll follow on their trail no less, with Drake"
16706,BOOK XI,Leading. Our oriflamme to-night shall be
16707,BOOK XI,His cresset and stern-lanthorn. Where that shines
16708,BOOK XI,"We follow."""
16709,BOOK XI,
16710,BOOK XI,"Drake, still thinking in his heart,--"
16711,BOOK XI,"""And if Spain be not shattered here and now"
16712,BOOK XI,"We are doomed no less,"" must even rest content"
16713,BOOK XI,With that good vantage.
16714,BOOK XI,As the sunset died
16715,BOOK XI,Over the darkling emerald seas that swelled
16716,BOOK XI,"Before the freshening wind, the pinnaces dashed"
16717,BOOK XI,To their own ships; and into the mind of Drake
16718,BOOK XI,There stole a plot that twitched his lips to a smile.
16719,BOOK XI,High on the heaving purple of the poop
16720,BOOK XI,Under the glimmer of firm and full-blown sails
16721,BOOK XI,"He stood, an iron statue, glancing back"
16722,BOOK XI,"Anon at his stern-cresset's crimson flare,"
16723,BOOK XI,The star of all the shadowy ships that plunged
16724,BOOK XI,"Like ghosts amid the grey stream of his wake,"
16725,BOOK XI,And all around him heard the low keen song
16726,BOOK XI,Of hidden ropes above the wail and creak
16727,BOOK XI,"Of blocks and long low swish of cloven foam,"
16728,BOOK XI,"A keen rope-music in the formless night,"
16729,BOOK XI,"A harmony, a strong intent good sound,"
16730,BOOK XI,"Well-strung and taut, singing the will of man."
16731,BOOK XI,"""Your oriflamme,"" he muttered,--""so you travail"
16732,BOOK XI,With sea-speech in the tongue of old Poictiers--
16733,BOOK XI,"Shall be my own stern-lanthorn. Watch it well,"
16734,BOOK XI,"My good Lord Howard."""
16735,BOOK XI,Over the surging seas
16736,BOOK XI,"The little _Revenge_ went swooping on the trail,"
16737,BOOK XI,Leading the ships of England. One by one
16738,BOOK XI,"Out of the gloom before them slowly crept,"
16739,BOOK XI,"Sinister gleam by gleam, like blood-red stars,"
16740,BOOK XI,"The rearmost lanthorns of the Spanish Fleet,"
16741,BOOK XI,A shaggy purple sky of secret storm
16742,BOOK XI,Heaving from north to south upon the black
16743,BOOK XI,Breast of the waters. Once again with lips
16744,BOOK XI,"Twitched to a smile, Drake suddenly bade them crowd"
16745,BOOK XI,All sail upon the little _Revenge_. She leapt
16746,BOOK XI,Forward. Smiling he watched the widening gap
16747,BOOK XI,"Between the ships that followed and her light,"
16748,BOOK XI,"Then as to those behind, its flicker must seem"
16749,BOOK XI,"Wellnigh confused with those of Spain, he cried,"
16750,BOOK XI,"""Now, master bo'sun, quench their oriflamme,"
16751,BOOK XI,Dip their damned cresset in the good black Sea!
16752,BOOK XI,"The rearmost light of Spain shall lead them now,"
16753,BOOK XI,"A little closer, if they think it ours."
16754,BOOK XI,"Pray God, they come to blows!"""
16755,BOOK XI,Even as he spake
16756,BOOK XI,His cresset-flare went out in the thick night;
16757,BOOK XI,A fluttering as of blind bewildered moths
16758,BOOK XI,A moment seized upon the shadowy ships
16759,BOOK XI,"Behind him, then with crowded sail they steered"
16760,BOOK XI,Straight for the rearmost cresset-flare of Spain.
16761,BOOK XI,
16762,BOOK XI,
16763,BOOK XII,BOOK XII
16764,BOOK XII,
16765,BOOK XII,"Meanwhile, as in the gloom he slipped aside"
16766,BOOK XII,"Along the Spanish ranks, waiting the crash"
16767,BOOK XII,"Of battle, suddenly Drake became aware"
16768,BOOK XII,Of strange sails bearing up into the wind
16769,BOOK XII,"Around his right, and thought, ""the Armada strives"
16770,BOOK XII,"To weather us in the dark."" Down went his helm,"
16771,BOOK XII,"And all alone the little _Revenge_ gave chase,"
16772,BOOK XII,"Till as the moon crept slowly forth, she stood"
16773,BOOK XII,"Beside the ghostly ships, only to see"
16774,BOOK XII,"Bewildered Flemish merchantmen, amazed"
16775,BOOK XII,With fears of Armageddon--such vast shrouds
16776,BOOK XII,Had lately passed them on the rolling seas.
16777,BOOK XII,"Down went his helm again, with one grim curse"
16778,BOOK XII,Upon the chance that led him thus astray;
16779,BOOK XII,And down the wind the little _Revenge_ once more
16780,BOOK XII,Swept on the trail. Fainter and fainter now
16781,BOOK XII,"Glared the red beacons on the British coasts,"
16782,BOOK XII,And the wind slackened and the glimmering East
16783,BOOK XII,"Greyed and reddened, yet Drake had not regained"
16784,BOOK XII,Sight of the ships. When the full glory of dawn
16785,BOOK XII,"Dazzled the sea, he found himself alone,"
16786,BOOK XII,With one huge galleon helplessly drifting
16787,BOOK XII,"A cable's-length away. Around her prow,"
16788,BOOK XII,"_Nuestra Señora del Rosario_,"
16789,BOOK XII,"Richly emblazoned, gold on red, proclaimed"
16790,BOOK XII,"The flagship of great Valdes, of the fleet"
16791,BOOK XII,"Of Andalusia, captain-general. She,"
16792,BOOK XII,"Last night, in dark collision with the hulks"
16793,BOOK XII,"Of Spain, had lost her foremast. Through the night"
16794,BOOK XII,"Her guns, long rank on deadly rank, had kept"
16795,BOOK XII,All enemies at bay. Drake summoned her
16796,BOOK XII,Instantly to surrender. She returned
16797,BOOK XII,A scornful answer from the glittering poop
16798,BOOK XII,Where two-score officers crowned the golden sea
16799,BOOK XII,And stained the dawn with blots of richer colour
16800,BOOK XII,"Loftily clustered in the glowing sky,"
16801,BOOK XII,"Doubleted with cramoisy velvet, wreathed"
16802,BOOK XII,"With golden chains, blazing with jewelled swords"
16803,BOOK XII,"And crusted poignards. ""What proud haste was this?"""
16804,BOOK XII,"They asked, glancing at their huge tiers of cannon"
16805,BOOK XII,And crowded decks of swarthy soldiery;
16806,BOOK XII,"""What madman in yon cockle-shell defied Spain?"""
16807,BOOK XII,"""Tell them it is El Draque,"" he said, ""who lacks"
16808,BOOK XII,The time to parley; therefore it will be well
16809,BOOK XII,"They strike at once, for I am in great haste."""
16810,BOOK XII,"There, at the sound of that renownèd name,"
16811,BOOK XII,Without a word down came their blazoned flag.
16812,BOOK XII,Like a great fragment of the dawn it lay
16813,BOOK XII,Crumpled upon their decks.. . .
16814,BOOK XII,
16815,BOOK XII,Into the soft bloom and Italian blue
16816,BOOK XII,"Of sparkling, ever-beautiful Torbay,"
16817,BOOK XII,"Belted as with warm Mediterranean crags,"
16818,BOOK XII,"The little _Revenge_ foamed with her mighty prize,"
16819,BOOK XII,A prize indeed--not for the casks of gold
16820,BOOK XII,Drake split in the rich sunlight and poured out
16821,BOOK XII,"Like dross amongst his men, but in her hold"
16822,BOOK XII,"Lay many tons of powder, worth their weight"
16823,BOOK XII,In rubies now to Britain. Into the hands
16824,BOOK XII,Of swarthy Brixham fishermen he gave
16825,BOOK XII,"Prisoners and prize, then--loaded stem to stern"
16826,BOOK XII,With powder and shot--their swiftest trawlers flew
16827,BOOK XII,Like falcons following a thunder-cloud
16828,BOOK XII,"Behind him, as with crowded sail he rushed"
16829,BOOK XII,On England's trail once more. Like a caged lion
16830,BOOK XII,"Drake paced his deck, praying he yet might reach"
16831,BOOK XII,The fight in time; and ever the warm light wind
16832,BOOK XII,Slackened. Not till the sun was half-way fallen
16833,BOOK XII,Once more crept out in front those dusky thrones
16834,BOOK XII,"Of thunder, heaving on the smooth bright sea"
16835,BOOK XII,From North to South with Howard's clustered fleet
16836,BOOK XII,"Like tiny clouds, becalmed, not half a mile"
16837,BOOK XII,Behind the Spaniards. For the breeze had failed
16838,BOOK XII,Their blind midnight pursuit; and now attack
16839,BOOK XII,"Seemed hopeless. Even as Drake drew nigh, the last"
16840,BOOK XII,"Breath of the wind sank. One more day had flown,"
16841,BOOK XII,Nought was accomplished; and the Armada lay
16842,BOOK XII,Some leagues of golden sea-way nearer now
16843,BOOK XII,To its great goal. The sun went down: the moon
16844,BOOK XII,Rose glittering. Hardly a cannon-shot apart
16845,BOOK XII,The two fleets lay becalmed upon the silver
16846,BOOK XII,Swell of the smooth night-tide. The hour had come
16847,BOOK XII,For Spain to strike. The ships of England drifted
16848,BOOK XII,"Helplessly, at the mercy of those great hulks"
16849,BOOK XII,Oared by their thousand slaves.
16850,BOOK XII,"Onward they came,"
16851,BOOK XII,Swinging suddenly in tremendous gloom
16852,BOOK XII,"Over the silver seas. But even as Drake,"
16853,BOOK XII,"With eyes on fire at last for his last fight,"
16854,BOOK XII,Measured the distance ere he gave the word
16855,BOOK XII,"To greet it with his cannon, suddenly"
16856,BOOK XII,The shining face of the deep began to shiver
16857,BOOK XII,With dusky patches: the doomed English sails
16858,BOOK XII,"Quivered and, filling smart from the North-east,"
16859,BOOK XII,The little _Revenge_ rushed down their broken line
16860,BOOK XII,"Signalling them to follow, and ere they knew"
16861,BOOK XII,"What miracle had saved them, they all sprang"
16862,BOOK XII,Their luff and ran large out to sea. For now
16863,BOOK XII,"The Armada lay to windward, and to fight"
16864,BOOK XII,Meant to be grappled and overwhelmed; but dark
16865,BOOK XII,"Within the mind of Drake, a fiercer plan"
16866,BOOK XII,Already had shaped itself.
16867,BOOK XII,"""They fly! They fly!"""
16868,BOOK XII,Rending the heavens from twice ten thousand throats
16869,BOOK XII,A mighty shout rose from the Spanish Fleet.
16870,BOOK XII,Over the moonlit waves their galleons came
16871,BOOK XII,"Towering, crowding, plunging down the wind"
16872,BOOK XII,"In full chase, while the tempter, Drake, laughed low"
16873,BOOK XII,To watch their solid battle-order break
16874,BOOK XII,And straggle. When once more the golden dawn
16875,BOOK XII,"Dazzled the deep, the labouring galleons lay"
16876,BOOK XII,Scattered by their unequal speed. The wind
16877,BOOK XII,Veered as the sun rose. Once again the ships
16878,BOOK XII,Of England lay to windward. Down swooped Drake
16879,BOOK XII,Where like a mountain the _San Marcos_ heaved
16880,BOOK XII,"Her giant flanks alone, having out-sailed"
16881,BOOK XII,Her huge companions. Then the sea-winds blazed
16882,BOOK XII,With broadsides. Two long hours the sea flamed red
16883,BOOK XII,All round her. One by one the Titan ships
16884,BOOK XII,"Came surging to her rescue, and met the buffet"
16885,BOOK XII,"Of battle-thunders, belching iron and flame;"
16886,BOOK XII,Nor could they pluck her forth from that red chaos
16887,BOOK XII,Till great Oquendo hurled his mighty prows
16888,BOOK XII,"Crashing athwart those thunders, and once more"
16889,BOOK XII,Gathered into unshakeable battle-order
16890,BOOK XII,The whole Armada raked the reeking seas.
16891,BOOK XII,Then up the wind the ships of England sheered
16892,BOOK XII,"Once more, and one more day drew to its close,"
16893,BOOK XII,"With little accomplished, half their powder spent,"
16894,BOOK XII,"And all the Armada moving as of old,"
16895,BOOK XII,"From sky to sky one heaven-wide zone of storm,"
16896,BOOK XII,(Though some three galleons out of all their host
16897,BOOK XII,Laboured woundily) down the darkening Channel.
16898,BOOK XII,And all night long on England's guardian heights
16899,BOOK XII,"The beacons reddened, and all the next long day"
16900,BOOK XII,The impregnable Armada never swerved
16901,BOOK XII,"From its tremendous path. In vain did Drake,"
16902,BOOK XII,"Frobisher, Hawkins, Howard, greatest names"
16903,BOOK XII,"In all our great sea-history, hover and dart"
16904,BOOK XII,Like falcons round the mountainous array.
16905,BOOK XII,"Till now, as night fell and they lay abreast"
16906,BOOK XII,"Of the Isle of Wight, once more the council flag"
16907,BOOK XII,Flew from the little _Revenge_. With iron face
16908,BOOK XII,"Thrust close to Howard's, and outstretched iron arm,"
16909,BOOK XII,Under the stars Drake pointed down the coast
16910,BOOK XII,"Where the red beacons flared. ""The shoals,"" he hissed,"
16911,BOOK XII,"""The shoals from Owers to Spithead and the net"
16912,BOOK XII,Of channels yonder in Portsmouth Roads. At dawn
16913,BOOK XII,"They'll lie to leeward of the Invincible Fleet!"""
16914,BOOK XII,
16915,BOOK XII,"Swiftly, in mighty sweeping lines Drake set"
16916,BOOK XII,Before the council his fierce battle-plan
16917,BOOK XII,To drive the Armada down upon the banks
16918,BOOK XII,And utterly shatter it--stroke by well-schemed stroke
16919,BOOK XII,As he unfolded there his vital plot
16920,BOOK XII,And touched their dead cold warfare into life
16921,BOOK XII,"Where plan before was none, he seemed to tower"
16922,BOOK XII,"Above them, clad with the deep night of stars;"
16923,BOOK XII,"And those that late would rival knew him now,"
16924,BOOK XII,"In all his great simplicity, their king,"
16925,BOOK XII,"One of the gods of battle, England's Drake,"
16926,BOOK XII,"A soul that summoned Cæsar from his grave,"
16927,BOOK XII,And swept with Alexander o'er the deep.
16928,BOOK XII,
16929,BOOK XII,So when the dawn thro' rolling wreaths of cloud
16930,BOOK XII,"Struggled, and all the waves were molten gold,"
16931,BOOK XII,"The heart of Spain exulted, for she saw"
16932,BOOK XII,The little fleet of England cloven in twain
16933,BOOK XII,As if by some strange discord. A light breeze
16934,BOOK XII,"Blew from the ripening East; and, up against it,"
16935,BOOK XII,"Urged by the very madness of defeat,"
16936,BOOK XII,"Or so it seemed, one half the British fleet"
16937,BOOK XII,"Drew nigh, towed by their boats, to challenge the vast"
16938,BOOK XII,"Tempest-winged heaving citadels of Spain,"
16939,BOOK XII,At last to the murderous grapple; while far away
16940,BOOK XII,"Their other half, led by the flag of Drake,"
16941,BOOK XII,"Stood out to sea, as if to escape the doom"
16942,BOOK XII,"Of that sheer madness, for the light wind now"
16943,BOOK XII,Could lend them no such wings to hover and swoop
16944,BOOK XII,As heretofore. Nearer the mad ships came
16945,BOOK XII,"Towed by their boats, till now upon their right"
16946,BOOK XII,To windward loomed the Fleet Invincible
16947,BOOK XII,"With all its thunder-clouds, and on their left"
16948,BOOK XII,"To leeward, gleamed the perilous white shoals"
16949,BOOK XII,With their long level lightnings under the cliffs
16950,BOOK XII,"Of England, from the green glad garden of Wight"
16951,BOOK XII,"To the Owers and Selsea Bill. Right on they came,"
16952,BOOK XII,And suddenly the wrench of thundering cannon
16953,BOOK XII,Shook the vast hulks that towered above them. Red
16954,BOOK XII,Flamed the blue sea between. Thunder to thunder
16955,BOOK XII,"Answered, and still the ships of Drake sped out"
16956,BOOK XII,"To the open sea. Sidonia saw them go,"
16957,BOOK XII,Furrowing the deep that like a pale-blue shield
16958,BOOK XII,Lay diamond-dazzled now in the full light.
16959,BOOK XII,"Rich was the omen of that day for Spain,"
16960,BOOK XII,The feast-day of Sidonia's patron-saint!
16961,BOOK XII,And the priests chanted and the trumpets blew
16962,BOOK XII,Triumphantly! A universal shout
16963,BOOK XII,"Went skyward from the locust-swarming decks,"
16964,BOOK XII,A shout that rent the golden morning clouds
16965,BOOK XII,"From heaven to menacing heaven, as castle to castle"
16966,BOOK XII,"Flew the great battle-signal, and like one range"
16967,BOOK XII,"Of moving mountains, those almighty ranks"
16968,BOOK XII,Swept down upon the small forsaken ships!
16969,BOOK XII,The lion's brood was in the imperial nets
16970,BOOK XII,Of Spain at last. Onward the mountains came
16971,BOOK XII,With all their golden clouds of sail and flags
16972,BOOK XII,Like streaming cataracts; all their glorious chasms
16973,BOOK XII,"And glittering steeps, echoing, re-echoing,"
16974,BOOK XII,"Calling, answering, as with the herald winds"
16975,BOOK XII,That blow the golden trumpets of the morning
16976,BOOK XII,From Skiddaw to Helvellyn. In the midst
16977,BOOK XII,The great _San Martin_ surged with heaven-wide press
16978,BOOK XII,Of proudly billowing sail; and yet once more
16979,BOOK XII,"Slowly, solemnly, like another dawn"
16980,BOOK XII,Up to her mast-head soared in thunderous gold
16981,BOOK XII,The sacred standard of their last crusade;
16982,BOOK XII,While round a hundred prows that heaved thro' heaven
16983,BOOK XII,"Like granite cliffs, their black wet shining flanks,"
16984,BOOK XII,"And swept like moving promontories, rolled"
16985,BOOK XII,"The splendid long-drawn thunders of the foam,"
16986,BOOK XII,And flashed the untamed white lightnings of the sea
16987,BOOK XII,"Back to a morn unhalyarded of man,"
16988,BOOK XII,Back to the unleashed sun and blazoned clouds
16989,BOOK XII,And azure sky--the unfettered flag of God.
16990,BOOK XII,
16991,BOOK XII,*   *   *   *
16992,BOOK XII,
16993,BOOK XII,Like one huge moving coast-line on they came
16994,BOOK XII,"Crashing, and closed the ships of England round"
16995,BOOK XII,"With one fierce crescent of thunder and sweeping flame,"
16996,BOOK XII,"One crimson scythe of Death, whose long sweep drowned"
16997,BOOK XII,"The eternal ocean with its mighty sound,"
16998,BOOK XII,"From heaven to heaven, one roar, one glitter of doom,"
16999,BOOK XII,While out to the sea-line's blue remotest bound
17000,BOOK XII,"The ships of Drake still fled, and the red fume"
17001,BOOK XII,Of battle thickened and shrouded shoal and sea with gloom.
17002,BOOK XII,
17003,BOOK XII,"The distant sea, the close white menacing shoals"
17004,BOOK XII,Are shrouded! And the lion's brood fight on!
17005,BOOK XII,And now death's very midnight round them rolls;
17006,BOOK XII,Rent is the flag that late so proudly shone!
17007,BOOK XII,The red decks reel and their last hope seems gone!
17008,BOOK XII,Round them they still keep clear one ring of sea:
17009,BOOK XII,"It narrows; but the lion's brood fight on,"
17010,BOOK XII,"Ungrappled still, still fearless and still free,"
17011,BOOK XII,While the white menacing shoals creep slowly out to lee.
17012,BOOK XII,
17013,BOOK XII,"Now through the red rents of each fire-cleft cloud,"
17014,BOOK XII,High o'er the British blood-greased decks flash out
17015,BOOK XII,"Thousands of swarthy faces, crowd on crowd"
17016,BOOK XII,"Surging, with one tremendous hurricane shout"
17017,BOOK XII,"_On, to the grapple_! and still the grim redoubt"
17018,BOOK XII,"Of the oaken bulwarks rolls them back again,"
17019,BOOK XII,As buffeted waves that shatter in the furious bout
17020,BOOK XII,When cannonading cliffs meet the full main
17021,BOOK XII,And hurl it back in smoke--so Britain hurls back Spain;
17022,BOOK XII,
17023,BOOK XII,"Hurls her back, only to see her return,"
17024,BOOK XII,Darkening the heavens with billow on billow of sail:
17025,BOOK XII,"Round that huge storm the waves like lava burn,"
17026,BOOK XII,"The daylight withers, and the sea-winds fail!"
17027,BOOK XII,"Seamen of England, what shall now avail"
17028,BOOK XII,Your naked arms? Before those blasts of doom
17029,BOOK XII,"The sun is quenched, the very sea-waves quail:"
17030,BOOK XII,"High overhead their triumphing thousands loom,"
17031,BOOK XII,When hark! what low deep guns to windward suddenly boom?
17032,BOOK XII,
17033,BOOK XII,What low deep strange new thunders far away
17034,BOOK XII,Respond to the triumphant shout of Spain?
17035,BOOK XII,Is it the wind that shakes their giant array?
17036,BOOK XII,Is it the deep wrath of the rising main?
17037,BOOK XII,"Is it--_El Draque_? El Draque! Ay, shout again,"
17038,BOOK XII,His thunders burst upon your windward flanks;
17039,BOOK XII,The shoals creep out to leeward! Is it plain
17040,BOOK XII,"At last, what earthquake heaves your herded ranks"
17041,BOOK XII,Huddled in huge dismay tow'rds those white foam-swept banks?
17042,BOOK XII,
17043,BOOK XII,"Plain, it was plain at last, what cunning lured,"
17044,BOOK XII,"What courage held them over the jaws o' the pit,"
17045,BOOK XII,Till Drake could hurl them down. The little ships
17046,BOOK XII,"Of Howard and Frobisher, towed by their boats,"
17047,BOOK XII,"Slipped away in the smoke, while out at sea"
17048,BOOK XII,"Drake, with a gale of wind behind him, crashed"
17049,BOOK XII,Volley on volley into the helpless rear
17050,BOOK XII,"Of Spain and drove it down, huddling the whole"
17051,BOOK XII,Invincible Fleet together upon the verge
17052,BOOK XII,Of doom. One awful surge of stormy wrath
17053,BOOK XII,Heaved thro' the struggling citadels of Spain.
17054,BOOK XII,"From East to West their desperate signal flew,"
17055,BOOK XII,"And like a drove of bullocks, with the foam"
17056,BOOK XII,"Flecking their giant sides, they staggered and swerved,"
17057,BOOK XII,"Careening tow'rds the shallows as they turned,"
17058,BOOK XII,Then in one wild stampede of sheer dismay
17059,BOOK XII,"Rushed, tacking seaward, while the grey sea-plain"
17060,BOOK XII,"Smoked round them, and the cannonades of Drake"
17061,BOOK XII,"Raked their wild flight; and the crusading flag,"
17062,BOOK XII,"Tangled in one black maze of crashing spars,"
17063,BOOK XII,Whirled downward like the pride of Lucifer
17064,BOOK XII,From heaven to hell.
17065,BOOK XII,Out tow'rds the coasts of France
17066,BOOK XII,"They plunged, narrowly weathering the Ower banks;"
17067,BOOK XII,"Then, once again, they formed in ranks compact,"
17068,BOOK XII,"Roundels impregnable, wrathfully bent at last"
17069,BOOK XII,Never to swerve again from their huge path
17070,BOOK XII,"And solid end--to join with Parma's host,"
17071,BOOK XII,And hurl the whole of Europe on our isle.
17072,BOOK XII,"Another day was gone, much powder spent;"
17073,BOOK XII,"And, while Lord Howard exulted and conferred"
17074,BOOK XII,"Knighthoods on his brave seamen, Drake alone"
17075,BOOK XII,"Knew that his mighty plan, in spite of all,"
17076,BOOK XII,"Had failed, knew that wellnigh his last great chance"
17077,BOOK XII,Was lost of wrecking the Spaniards ere they joined
17078,BOOK XII,"Parma. The night went by, and the next day,"
17079,BOOK XII,With scarce a visible scar the Invincible Fleet
17080,BOOK XII,"Drew onwards tow'rds its goal, unshakeable now"
17081,BOOK XII,In that grim battle-order. Beacons flared
17082,BOOK XII,"Along the British coast, and pikes flashed out"
17083,BOOK XII,"All night, and a strange dread began to grip"
17084,BOOK XII,"The heart of England, as it seemed the might"
17085,BOOK XII,Of seamen most renowned in all the world
17086,BOOK XII,Checked not that huge advance. Yet at the heart
17087,BOOK XII,Of Spain no less there clung a vampire fear
17088,BOOK XII,"And strange foreboding, as the next day passed"
17089,BOOK XII,"Quietly, and behind her all day long"
17090,BOOK XII,The shadowy ships of Drake stood on her trail
17091,BOOK XII,"Quietly, patiently, as death or doom,"
17092,BOOK XII,Unswerving and implacable.
17093,BOOK XII,While the sun
17094,BOOK XII,Sank thro' long crimson fringes on that eve.
17095,BOOK XII,The fleets were passing Calais and the wind
17096,BOOK XII,Blew fair behind them. A strange impulse seized
17097,BOOK XII,"Spain to shake off those bloodhounds from her trail,"
17098,BOOK XII,And suddenly the whole Invincible Fleet
17099,BOOK XII,"Anchored, in hope the following wind would bear"
17100,BOOK XII,The ships of England past and carry them down
17101,BOOK XII,To leeward. But their grim insistent watch
17102,BOOK XII,Was ready; and though their van had wellnigh crashed
17103,BOOK XII,"Into the rear of Spain, in the golden dusk,"
17104,BOOK XII,"They, too, a cannon-shot away, at once"
17105,BOOK XII,"Anchored, to windward still."
17106,BOOK XII,Quietly heaved
17107,BOOK XII,The golden sea in that tremendous hour
17108,BOOK XII,"Fraught with the fate of Europe and mankind,"
17109,BOOK XII,"As yet once more the flag of council flew,"
17110,BOOK XII,"And Hawkins, Howard, Frobisher, and Drake"
17111,BOOK XII,Gathered together upon the little _Revenge_
17112,BOOK XII,While like a triumphing fire the news was borne
17113,BOOK XII,"To Spain, already, that the Invincible Fleet"
17114,BOOK XII,"Had reached its end, ay, and ""that great black dog"
17115,BOOK XII,"Sir Francis Drake"" was writhing now in chains"
17116,BOOK XII,Beneath the torturer's hands.
17117,BOOK XII,High on his poop
17118,BOOK XII,"He stood, a granite rock, above the throng"
17119,BOOK XII,"Of captains, there amid the breaking waves"
17120,BOOK XII,"Of clashing thought and swift opinion,"
17121,BOOK XII,"Silent, gazing where now the cool fresh wind"
17122,BOOK XII,Blew steadily up the terrible North Sea
17123,BOOK XII,Which rolled under the clouds into a gloom
17124,BOOK XII,Unfathomable. Once only his lips moved
17125,BOOK XII,"Half-consciously, breathing those mighty words,"
17126,BOOK XII,"_The clouds His chariot_! Then, suddenly, he turned"
17127,BOOK XII,And looked upon the little flock of ships
17128,BOOK XII,"That followed on the fleet of England, sloops"
17129,BOOK XII,"Helpless in fight. These, manned by the brave zeal"
17130,BOOK XII,"Of many a noble house, from hour to hour"
17131,BOOK XII,Had plunged out from the coast to join his flag.
17132,BOOK XII,"""Better if they had brought us powder and food"
17133,BOOK XII,"Than sought to join us thus,"" he had growled; but now"
17134,BOOK XII,"""Lord God,"" he cried aloud, ""they'll light our road"
17135,BOOK XII,"To victory yet!"" And in great sweeping strokes"
17136,BOOK XII,Once more he drew his mighty battle-plan
17137,BOOK XII,Before the captains. In the thickening gloom
17138,BOOK XII,They stared at his grim face as at a man
17139,BOOK XII,"Risen from hell, with all the powers of hell"
17140,BOOK XII,"At his command, a face tempered like steel"
17141,BOOK XII,"In the everlasting furnaces, a rock"
17142,BOOK XII,"Of adamant, while with a voice that blent"
17143,BOOK XII,With the ebb and flow of the everlasting sea
17144,BOOK XII,"He spake, and at the low deep menacing words"
17145,BOOK XII,Monotonous with the unconquerable
17146,BOOK XII,Passion and level strength of his great soul
17147,BOOK XII,"They shuddered; for the man seemed more than man,"
17148,BOOK XII,And from his iron lips resounded doom
17149,BOOK XII,"As from the lips of cannon, doom to Spain,"
17150,BOOK XII,"Inevitable, unconquerable doom."
17151,BOOK XII,
17152,BOOK XII,And through that mighty host of Spain there crept
17153,BOOK XII,"Cold winds of fear, as to the darkening sky"
17154,BOOK XII,Once more from lips of kneeling thousands swept
17155,BOOK XII,"The vespers of an Empire--one vast cry,"
17156,BOOK XII,"SALVE REGINA! God, what wild reply"
17157,BOOK XII,Hissed from the clouds in that dark hour of dreams?
17158,BOOK XII,"AVE MARIA, _those about to die"
17159,BOOK XII,"Salute thee_! See, what ghostly pageant streams"
17160,BOOK XII,Above them? What thin hands point down like pale moonbeams?
17161,BOOK XII,
17162,BOOK XII,Thick as the ghosts that Dante saw in hell
17163,BOOK XII,"Whirled on the blast thro' boundless leagues of pain,"
17164,BOOK XII,"Thick, thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable,"
17165,BOOK XII,In the Inquisition's yellow robes her slain
17166,BOOK XII,"And tortured thousands, dense as the red rain"
17167,BOOK XII,"That wellnigh quenched her fires, went hissing by"
17168,BOOK XII,"With twisted shapes, raw from the racks of Spain,"
17169,BOOK XII,"Salve Regina!--rushing thro' the sky,"
17170,BOOK XII,"And pale hands pointing down and lips that mocked her cry,"
17171,BOOK XII,
17172,BOOK XII,Ten thousand times ten thousand!--what are these
17173,BOOK XII,That are arrayed in yellow robes and sweep
17174,BOOK XII,Between your prayers and God like phantom seas
17175,BOOK XII,Prophesying over your masts? Could Rome not keep
17176,BOOK XII,The keys? Who loosed these dead to break your sleep?
17177,BOOK XII,"SALVE REGINA, cry, yea, cry aloud."
17178,BOOK XII,AVE MARIA! Ye have sown: shall ye not reap?
17179,BOOK XII,"SALVE REGINA! Christ, what fiery cloud"
17180,BOOK XII,"Suddenly rolls to windward, high o'er mast and shroud?"
17181,BOOK XII,
17182,BOOK XII,Are hell-gates burst at last? For the black deep
17183,BOOK XII,To windward burns with streaming crimson fires!
17184,BOOK XII,"Over the wild strange waves, they shudder and creep"
17185,BOOK XII,"Nearer--strange smoke-wreathed masts and spars, red"
17186,BOOK XII,spires
17187,BOOK XII,"And blazing hulks, vast roaring blood-red pyres,"
17188,BOOK XII,Fierce as the flames ye fed with flesh of men
17189,BOOK XII,Amid the imperial pomp and chanting choirs
17190,BOOK XII,Of Alva--from El Draque's red hand again
17191,BOOK XII,Sweep the wild fire-ships down upon the Fleet of Spain.
17192,BOOK XII,
17193,BOOK XII,Onward before the freshening wind they come
17194,BOOK XII,"Full fraught with all the terrors, all the bale"
17195,BOOK XII,"That flamed so long for the delight of Rome,"
17196,BOOK XII,"The shrieking fires that struck the sunlight pale,"
17197,BOOK XII,The avenging fires at last! Now what avail
17198,BOOK XII,"Your thousand ranks of cannon? Swift, cut free,"
17199,BOOK XII,"Cut your scorched cables! Cry, reel backward, quail,"
17200,BOOK XII,"Crash your huge huddled ranks together, flee!"
17201,BOOK XII,"Behind you roars the fire, before--the dark North Sea!"
17202,BOOK XII,
17203,BOOK XII,"Dawn, everlasting and omnipotent"
17204,BOOK XII,"Dawn rolled in crimson o'er the spar-strewn waves,"
17205,BOOK XII,As the last trumpet shall in thunder roll
17206,BOOK XII,"O'er heaven and earth and ocean. Far away,"
17207,BOOK XII,"The ships of Spain, great ragged piles of gloom"
17208,BOOK XII,"And shaggy splendour, leaning to the North"
17209,BOOK XII,"Like sun-shot clouds confused, or rent apart"
17210,BOOK XII,"In scattered squadrons, furiously plunged,"
17211,BOOK XII,Burying their mighty prows i' the broad grey rush
17212,BOOK XII,"Of smoking billowy hills, or heaving high"
17213,BOOK XII,"Their giant bowsprits to the wandering heavens,"
17214,BOOK XII,"Labouring in vain to return, struggling to lock"
17215,BOOK XII,"Their far-flung ranks anew, but drifting still"
17216,BOOK XII,"To leeward, driven by the ever-increasing storm"
17217,BOOK XII,Straight for the dark North Sea. Hard by there lurched
17218,BOOK XII,"One gorgeous galleon on the ravening shoals,"
17219,BOOK XII,Feeding the white maw of the famished waves
17220,BOOK XII,With gold and purple webs from kingly looms
17221,BOOK XII,"And spilth of world-wide empires. Howard, still"
17222,BOOK XII,"Planning to pluck the Armada plume by plume,"
17223,BOOK XII,Swooped down upon that prey and swiftly engaged
17224,BOOK XII,"Her desperate guns; while Drake, our ocean-king,"
17225,BOOK XII,"Knowing the full worth of that doom-fraught hour,"
17226,BOOK XII,"Glanced neither to the left nor right, but stood"
17227,BOOK XII,"High on his poop, with calm implacable face"
17228,BOOK XII,"Gazing as into eternity, and steered"
17229,BOOK XII,The crowded glory of his dawn-flushed sails
17230,BOOK XII,"In superb onset, straight for the great fleet"
17231,BOOK XII,Invincible; and after him the main
17232,BOOK XII,"Of England's fleet, knowing its captain now,"
17233,BOOK XII,"Followed, and with them rushed--from sky to sky"
17234,BOOK XII,"One glittering charge of wrath--the storm's white waves,"
17235,BOOK XII,The twenty thousand foaming chariots
17236,BOOK XII,Of God.
17237,BOOK XII,None but the everlasting voice
17238,BOOK XII,Of him who fought at Salamis might sing
17239,BOOK XII,The fight of that dread Sabbath. Not mankind
17240,BOOK XII,"Waged it alone. War raged in heaven that day,"
17241,BOOK XII,Where Michael and his angels drave once more
17242,BOOK XII,The hosts of darkness ruining down the abyss
17243,BOOK XII,"Of chaos. Light against darkness, Liberty"
17244,BOOK XII,"Against all dark old despotism, unsheathed"
17245,BOOK XII,The sword in that great hour. Behind the strife
17246,BOOK XII,Of men embattled deeps beyond all thought
17247,BOOK XII,"Moved in their awful panoply, as move"
17248,BOOK XII,"Silent, invisible, swift, under the clash"
17249,BOOK XII,"Of waves and flash of foam, huge ocean-glooms"
17250,BOOK XII,And vast reserves of inappellable power.
17251,BOOK XII,The bowsprits ranked on either fore-front seemed
17252,BOOK XII,But spear-heads of those dread antagonists
17253,BOOK XII,Invisible: the shuddering sails of Spain
17254,BOOK XII,"Dusk with the shadow of death, the sunward sails"
17255,BOOK XII,Of England full-fraught with the breath of God.
17256,BOOK XII,Onward the ships of England and God's waves
17257,BOOK XII,"Triumphantly charged, glittering companions,"
17258,BOOK XII,And poured their thunders on the extreme right
17259,BOOK XII,"Of Spain, whose giant galleons as they lurched"
17260,BOOK XII,Heavily to the roughening sea and wind
17261,BOOK XII,"With all their grinding, wrenching cannon, worked"
17262,BOOK XII,On rolling platforms by the helpless hands
17263,BOOK XII,"Of twenty thousand soldiers, without skill"
17264,BOOK XII,"In stormy seas, rent the indifferent sky"
17265,BOOK XII,Or tore the black troughs of the swirling deep
17266,BOOK XII,"In vain, while volley on volley of flame and iron"
17267,BOOK XII,"Burst thro' their four-foot beams, fierce raking blasts"
17268,BOOK XII,From ships that came and went on wings of the wind
17269,BOOK XII,"All round their mangled bulk, scarce a pike's thrust"
17270,BOOK XII,"Away, sweeping their decks from stem to stern"
17271,BOOK XII,(Between the rush and roar of the great green waves)
17272,BOOK XII,"With crimson death, rending their timbered towns"
17273,BOOK XII,And populous floating streets into wild squares
17274,BOOK XII,"Of slaughter and devastation; driving them down,"
17275,BOOK XII,"Huddled on their own centre, cities of shame"
17276,BOOK XII,"And havoc, in fiery forests of tangled wrath,"
17277,BOOK XII,With hurricanes of huge masts and swarming spars
17278,BOOK XII,And multitudinous decks that heaved and sank
17279,BOOK XII,"Like earthquake-smitten palaces, when doom"
17280,BOOK XII,"Comes, with one stride, across the pomp of kings."
17281,BOOK XII,"All round them shouted the everlasting sea,"
17282,BOOK XII,Burst in white thunders on the streaming poops
17283,BOOK XII,And blinded fifty thousand eyes with spray.
17284,BOOK XII,"Once, as a gorgeous galleon, drenched with blood"
17285,BOOK XII,"Began to founder and settle, a British captain"
17286,BOOK XII,"Called from his bulwarks, bidding her fierce crew"
17287,BOOK XII,Surrender and come aboard. Straight through the heart
17288,BOOK XII,A hundred muskets answered that appeal.
17289,BOOK XII,_Sink or destroy_! The deadly signal flew
17290,BOOK XII,"From mast to mast of England. Once, twice, thrice,"
17291,BOOK XII,A huge sea-castle heaved her haggled bulk
17292,BOOK XII,"Heavenward, and with a cry that rent the heavens"
17293,BOOK XII,"From all her crowded decks, and one deep roar"
17294,BOOK XII,As of a cloven world or the dark surge
17295,BOOK XII,"Of chaos yawning, sank: the swirling slopes"
17296,BOOK XII,Of the sweeping billowy hills for a moment swarmed
17297,BOOK XII,"With struggling insect-men, sprinkling the foam"
17298,BOOK XII,With tossing arms; then the indifferent sea
17299,BOOK XII,Rolled its grey smoking waves across the place
17300,BOOK XII,Where they had been. Here a great galleasse poured
17301,BOOK XII,"Red rivers through her scuppers and torn flanks,"
17302,BOOK XII,"And there a galleon, wrapped in creeping fire,"
17303,BOOK XII,Suddenly like a vast volcano split
17304,BOOK XII,"Asunder, and o'er the vomiting sulphurous clouds"
17305,BOOK XII,"And spouting spread of crimson, flying spars"
17306,BOOK XII,And heads torn from their trunks and scattered limbs
17307,BOOK XII,"Leapt, hideous gouts of death, against the glare."
17308,BOOK XII,"Hardly the thrust of a pike away, the ships"
17309,BOOK XII,"Of England flashed and swerved, till in one mass"
17310,BOOK XII,Of thunder-blasted splendour and shuddering gloom
17311,BOOK XII,Those gorgeous floating citadels huddled and shrank
17312,BOOK XII,"Their towers, and all the glory of dawn that rolled"
17313,BOOK XII,And burned along the tempest of their banners
17314,BOOK XII,"Withered, as on a murderer's face the light"
17315,BOOK XII,Withers before the accuser. All their proud
17316,BOOK XII,Castles and towers and heaven-wide clouds of sail
17317,BOOK XII,"Shrank to a darkening horror, like the heart"
17318,BOOK XII,"Of Evil, plucked from midnight's fiercest gloom,"
17319,BOOK XII,With all its curses quivering and alive;
17320,BOOK XII,"A horror of wild masts and tangled spars,"
17321,BOOK XII,Like some great kraken with a thousand arms
17322,BOOK XII,"Torn from the filthiest cavern of the deep,"
17323,BOOK XII,"Writhing, and spewing forth its venomous fumes"
17324,BOOK XII,On every side. _Sink or destroy_!--all day
17325,BOOK XII,The deadly signal flew; and ever the sea
17326,BOOK XII,"Swelled higher, and the flashes of the foam"
17327,BOOK XII,Broadened and leapt and spread as a wild white fire
17328,BOOK XII,That flourishes with the wind; and ever the storm
17329,BOOK XII,Drave the grim battle onward to the wild
17330,BOOK XII,"Menace of the dark North Sea. At set of sun,"
17331,BOOK XII,Even as below the sea-line the broad disc
17332,BOOK XII,Sank like a red-hot cannon-ball through scurf
17333,BOOK XII,"Of seething molten lead, the _Santa Maria_"
17334,BOOK XII,Uttering one cry that split the heart of heaven
17335,BOOK XII,"Went down with all hands, roaring into the dark."
17336,BOOK XII,Hardly five rounds of shot were left to Drake!
17337,BOOK XII,"Gun after gun fell silent, as the night"
17338,BOOK XII,"Deepened--""Yet we must follow them to the North,"""
17339,BOOK XII,"He cried, ""or they'll return yet to shake hands"
17340,BOOK XII,"With Parma! Come, we'll put a brag upon it,"
17341,BOOK XII,"And hunt them onward as we lacked for nought!"""
17342,BOOK XII,"So, when across the swinging smoking seas,"
17343,BOOK XII,Grey and splendid and terrible broke the day
17344,BOOK XII,"Once more, the flying Invincible fleet beheld"
17345,BOOK XII,"Upon their weather-beam, and dogging them"
17346,BOOK XII,"Like their own shadow, the dark ships of Drake,"
17347,BOOK XII,Unswerving and implacable. Ever the wind
17348,BOOK XII,And sea increased; till now the heaving deep
17349,BOOK XII,Swelled all around them into sulky hills
17350,BOOK XII,"And rolling mountains, whose majestic crests,"
17351,BOOK XII,Like wild white flames far blown and savagely flickering
17352,BOOK XII,"Swept thro' the clouds; and, on their vanishing slopes,"
17353,BOOK XII,Past the pursuing fleet began to swirl
17354,BOOK XII,"Scores of horses and mules, drowning or drowned,"
17355,BOOK XII,Cast overboard to lighten the wild flight
17356,BOOK XII,"Of Spain, and save her water-casks, a trail"
17357,BOOK XII,Telling of utmost fear. And ever the storm
17358,BOOK XII,"Soared louder across the leagues of rioting sea,"
17359,BOOK XII,Driving her onward like a mighty stag
17360,BOOK XII,Chased by the wolves. Off the dark Firth of Forth
17361,BOOK XII,"At last, Drake signalled and lay head to wind,"
17362,BOOK XII,"Watching. ""The chariots of God are twenty thousand,"""
17363,BOOK XII,"He muttered, as, for a moment close at hand,"
17364,BOOK XII,"Caught in some league-wide whirlpool of the sea,"
17365,BOOK XII,The mighty galleons crowded and towered and plunged
17366,BOOK XII,"Above him on the huge o'erhanging billows,"
17367,BOOK XII,"As if to crash down on his decks; the next,"
17368,BOOK XII,A mile of ravening sea had swept between
17369,BOOK XII,"Each of those wind-whipt straws and they were gone,"
17370,BOOK XII,"With all their tiny shrivelling scrolls of sail,"
17371,BOOK XII,"Through roaring deserts of embattled death,"
17372,BOOK XII,Where like a hundred thousand chariots charged
17373,BOOK XII,"With lightnings and with thunders, the great deep"
17374,BOOK XII,Hurled them away to the North. From sky to sky
17375,BOOK XII,One blanching bursting storm of infinite seas
17376,BOOK XII,"Followed them, broad white cataracts, hills that grasped"
17377,BOOK XII,"With struggling Titan hands at reeling heavens,"
17378,BOOK XII,And roared their doom-fraught greetings from Cape Wrath
17379,BOOK XII,Round to the Bloody Foreland.
17380,BOOK XII,There should the yeast
17381,BOOK XII,"Of foam receive the purple of many kings,"
17382,BOOK XII,And the grim gulfs devour the blood-bought gold
17383,BOOK XII,"Of Aztecs and of Incas, and the reefs,"
17384,BOOK XII,"League after league, bristle with mangled spars,"
17385,BOOK XII,And all along their coasts the murderous kerns
17386,BOOK XII,Of Catholic Ireland strip the gorgeous silks
17387,BOOK XII,And chains and jewel-encrusted crucifixes
17388,BOOK XII,"From thousands dead, and slaughter thousands more"
17389,BOOK XII,With gallow-glass axes as they blindly crept
17390,BOOK XII,Forth from the surf and jagged rocks to seek
17391,BOOK XII,Pity of their own creed.
17392,BOOK XII,To meet that doom
17393,BOOK XII,"Drake watched their sails go shrivelling, till the last"
17394,BOOK XII,Flicker of spars vanished as a skeleton leaf
17395,BOOK XII,"Upon the blasts of winter, and there was nought"
17396,BOOK XII,But one wide wilderness of splendour and gloom
17397,BOOK XII,Under the northern clouds.
17398,BOOK XII,"""Not unto us,"""
17399,BOOK XII,"Cried Drake, ""not unto us--but unto Him"
17400,BOOK XII,"Who made the sea, belongs our England now!"
17401,BOOK XII,Pray God that heart and mind and soul we prove
17402,BOOK XII,Worthy among the nations of this hour
17403,BOOK XII,"And this great victory, whose ocean fame"
17404,BOOK XII,Shall wash the world with thunder till that day
17405,BOOK XII,"When there is no more sea, and the strong cliffs"
17406,BOOK XII,"Pass like a smoke, and the last peal of it"
17407,BOOK XII,"Sounds thro' the trumpet."""
17408,BOOK XII,"So, with close-hauled sails,"
17409,BOOK XII,"Over the rolling triumph of the deep,"
17410,BOOK XII,"Lifting their hearts to heaven, they turned back home."
