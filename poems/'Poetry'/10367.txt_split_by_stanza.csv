16,PREFACE.,PREFACE. 
17,PREFACE.,"This Volume is submitted to the Public with all that diffidence which ought to attend the publication of Verses, many of which were written in the gay and happy era of boyhood, and others in subsequent periods of maturer life, as a relief from more arduous pursuits. "
18,PREFACE.,"They lay no pretensions to the depth and solidity of the effusions of the Muse in her elevated flights; they are the few wild notes of the simple shepherd, and do not even affect to imitate the rich cadence of the scientific musician. "
19,PREFACE.,"If the Author might, without the imputation of vanity, select for them a place in the Temple of Poetry, he would endeavour to class them in that niche which is appropriated for the reception of the light and playful _Vers de Societé_. "
20,PREFACE.,"Should the Reader find them but little worthy of his approval, he will not have reason at the same time to condemn their prolixity: their brevity will, at least in some degree, atone for their want of fire and fancy. "
21,PREFACE.,"It is thought proper to state that some of the following Poems have appeared before at various times, in a fugitive shape; and that the Poetry in the Author’s Tours is here collected. "

27,IN DEVONSHIRE.,IN DEVONSHIRE. 
28,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Tell me, thou grotto! o’er whose brow are seen Projecting plumes, and shades of deep’ning green,— While not a sound disturbs thy stony hall, While all thy dewy drops forget to fall,— Why canst thou not thy soothing charms impart, And shed thy quiet o’er this beating heart? Tell me, thou richly-painted river! tell, That on thy mirror’d plane dost mimic well Each pendent tree and every distant hill, Tipp’d with red lustre, beauteous, bright, and still,— Can I not, gazing on thy tranquil tide, Shed ev’ry grief upon thy rocky side? Or must I rove thy margin, calm and clear, The only agitated object near? Oh! tell me, too, thou babbling cold cascade! Whose waters, falling thro’ successive shade, Unspangled by the brightness of the sky, Awake each echo to a soft reply,— Say, canst thou not my bosom-grief befriend, And bid one drop upon my heart descend? When all thy songsters soothe themselves to sleep. Ah! must these aching eyes for ever weep? And must their frequent waters, like thine own, Drop, idly drop, on unimpressive stone? Or, when my beauteous fair shall deign to grace The humid foliage of thy mossy base, Canst thou not tell how many a rock below Impedes to kiss thy waters as they flow? In _her_ mind canst thou not the feeling rear To stop, or thus caress, each genuine tear? Teach her, oh! teach her, then, thou cold cascade! Pour all thy lessons for the lovely maid! And thou, bless’d grotto! let thy silence prove Her mute consenting answer to my love! And thou, bright river! as thou roll’st along, Bear on thy wand’ring wave a lover’s song! Strong as thy current, as thy waters pure, Teach her to feel the passion I endure! "

33,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Tho’ no funereal grandeur swell my song, Nor genius, eagle-plum’d, the strain prolong,— Tho’ Grief and Nature here alone combine To weep, my William! o’er a fate like thine,— Yet thy fond pray’r, still ling’ring on my ear, Shall force its way thro’ many a gushing tear: The Muse, that saw thy op’ning beauties spread, That lov’d thee living, shall lament thee dead! Ye graceful Virtues! while the note I breathe, Of sweetest flow’rs entwine a fun’ral wreath,— Of virgin flow’rs, and place them round his tomb, To bud, like him, and perish in their bloom! Ah! when these eyes saw thee serenely wait The last long separating stroke of Fate,— When round thy bed a kindred weeping train Call’d on thy voice to greet them, but in vain,— When o’er thy lips we watch’d thy fault’ring breath— When louder grief proclaim’d th’approach of death,— Thro’ ev’ry vein an icy horror chill’d, Colder than marble ev’ry bosom thrill’d. Unsettled still, tho’ exercis’d to grieve, Scarce would my mind the alter’d sight believe; Familiar scenes a transient calm inspire, Poor flutt’ring Fancy fann’d the vain desire, ’Till with sad proof thy wasted relics rise, And restless Nature pours uncall’d-for sighs. Ah! long, my William! shall thy picture rest, Time shall not wear it, imag’d in my breast; Yes, thou shall live while fond remembrance lives, ’Till he who mourns thee asks the line he gives. No common joy, no fugitive delight, Regret like this could in my breast excite; For then my sorrow had been less severe, And tears less copious had bedew’d the bier. From the same breast our milky food we drew, Entwin’d affection strengthen’d as we grew; Why further trace? The flatt’ring dream is o’er— Thy transient joys and sorrows are no more! All, all are fled!—And, ah! where’er I turn, Insulting Death directs me to thy urn, Throws his cold shadows round me while I sing. Damps ev’ry nerve, and slackens ev’ry string. So, when the Moon trims up her waning fire, Sweep the night-breezes o’er th’Aeolian lyre; Ling’ring, perchance, some wild pathetic sound Lulls the lorn ear, and dies along the ground. Ye kindred train! who, o’er the parting grave, Have mourn’d the virtues which ye could not save. Ye know how Mem’ry, with excursive pow’r, Extracts a sweet from ev’ry faded hour;— From scenes long past, regardless of repose, She feeds her tears, and treasures up her woes. Thou tuneful, mute, companion[1] of my care! Where now thy notes, that linger’d in the air? That linger still!—Vain thy harmonious store,— Thy sweet persuasive triumphs are no more. Thy mournful image strikes my wand’ring eye; Sad, near thy silent strings, I sit and sigh. Cold is that band which Music form’d her own, When ev’ry chord resign’d its sweetest tone. Ah! long, fair source of rapture, shall thou rest, Silent and sad, neglected and unprest, ’Till years, lov’d shade! superior pow’rs resign, Or raise one note more eloquent than thine. Tho’ with’ring Sickness mark’d thee in the womb, And form’d thy cradle but to form thy tomb, Yet, like a flow’r, she bade thee reach thy prime, The fairer victim for the stroke of Time. When fond Invention vainly sought thine ease, The wave salubrious and the morning breeze,— When even Sleep, sweet Sleep! refus’d thy call, Sleep! that with sweet refreshment smiles on all,— When, till the morn, thine eyes, unclos’d and damp, Trac’d thy sad semblance in the glimm’ring lamp,— When from thy face Health’s latest relic fled, Where Hope might flatter, with reluctant tread,— Still, darting forward from the weight of woe, Thy soul with all its energy would glow; Still with the purest passion wouldst thou prove The glow of friendship and the warmth of love. And ah! to sacred Memory ever nigh, Thy wit and humour claim the passing sigh: When, thro’ the hour, with unresisted skill, I’ve seen thee mould each feature to thy will,— When friends drew round thee with attentive ear, Pleas’d with the raill’ry which they could not fear. Oh! how I’ve heard thee, with concealing art, Join in the song, tho’ sorrow rent thy heart; How have I seen thee too, with venial guile, O’er many an anguish force the faithless smile,— Seen suffering Nature check each sigh, each fear, To rob maternal fondness of a tear! Alas! those scenes are past!—Vain was the pray’r That ask’d of Fate to soften and to spare; Ah! vain, if wit and virtue could not save Thy youthful honours from an early grave. But yet, if here my warm fraternal love May claim alliance with the realms above; If kindred Nature, with perpetual bloom, Transplanted springs, and lives beyond the tomb; Thy pitying soul shall smile upon my grief, Shall feel a pang that wishes not relief; In visions still shall shield me as I go, Along this gloomy wilderness of woe; Shall still regard me with peculiar pride, On earth my brother, and in heav’n my guide! Methinks I see thee reach th’ empyrean shore, And heav’n’s full chorus hails one angel more; While ’mid the seraph-forms that round thee fly, Thy father meets thee with ecstatic eye! He springs exulting from his throne of rest, Extends his arms, and clasps thee to his breast! "

37,ON,“_The Golden Days of good Queen Bess_.” 
38,ON,"To my Muse give attention, and deem it not a mystery If I jumble up together music, poetry, and history, To sing of the vices of wicked Queen Bess, sir, Whose memory posterity with blushes shall confess, sir, Detested be the memory of wicked Queen Bess, sir, Whose memory posterity with blushes shall confess, sir. "
39,ON,"In saying she would die a maid, she, England! did amuse ye. But what she did, and what she died—I hope you will excuse me: A gallant Earl a miracle of passion for her fed, sir; She kiss’d him, and she clos’d the scene by striking off his head, sir! Detested be, &c. "
40,ON,"Oh! rude ungrateful Scotland! had thy desolated Queen, sir, No blue eyes ever known, nor had she beauteous been, sir, The envy of our old rival hag she might have baffled, sir, Nor with her guiltless blood have crimson’d o’er the scaffold, sir. Detested be, &c. "
41,ON,"She dress’d just like a porcupine, and din’d just like a pig, sir, And an over-running butt of sack she swallow’d at a swig, sir! Her brawny maids of honour ate and drank confounded hard, sir, And droves of oxen daily bled within her palace-yard, sir! Detested be, &c. "
42,ON,"In ruling she was wonderous tyrannical and surly; If a patriot only touch’d on the Queen or Master Burleigh, She’d send a file of soldiers in less than half an hour, sir, Just to bid him make his speeches to the prisons of the Tow’r, sir! Detested be, &c. "

45,"REBECCA,",Rebecca was the fairest maid That on the Danube’s borders play’d; And many a handsome nobleman For her in tilt and tourney ran; While fair Rebecca wish’d to see What youth her husband was to be. 
46,"REBECCA,","Rebecca heard the gossips say, “Alone from dusk till midnight stay Within the church-porch drear and dark, Upon the vigil of Saint Mark, And, lovely maiden! you shall see What youth your husband is to be.” "
47,"REBECCA,","Rebecca, when the night grew dark, Upon the vigil of Saint Mark, (Observ’d by Paul, a roguish scout, Who guess’d the task she went about,) Stepp’d to St Stephen’s Church to see What youth her husband was to be. "
48,"REBECCA,","Rebecca heard the screech-owl cry, And saw the black bat round her fly; She sat, ’till, wild with fear, at last Her blood ran cold, her pulse beat fast; And yet, rash maid! she stopp’d to see What youth her husband was to be. "
49,"REBECCA,","Rebecca heard the midnight chime Ring out the yawning peal of time, When shrouded Paul, unlucky knave! Rose like a spectre from the grave; And cried, “Fair maiden, come with me. For I your bridegroom am to be.” "
50,"REBECCA,","Rebecca turn’d her head aside, Sent forth a hideous shriek, and died! While Paul confess’d himself, in vain, Rebecca never spoke again! Ah! little, hapless maid! did she Think Death her bridegroom was to be. "
51,"REBECCA,","Rebecca! may thy story long Instruct the giddy and the young. Fright not, fond youths! the timid fair; And you too, gentle maids! beware; Nor seek by lawless arts to see What youths your husbands are to be. "

64,TO TAKE THE COMMAND OF A SQUADRON.,"Oh! why does sorrow shade thy face, Where mind and beauty vie with grace? Say, dost thou for thy hero weep, Who gallantly, upon the deep, Is gone to tell the madd’ning foe, Tho’ vict’ry laid our Nelson low, We still have chiefs as greatly brave, Proudly triumphant on the wave? Dear to thy Country shalt thou be, Fair mourner! and her sympathy Is thine; for, in the war’s alarms, Thou gav’st thine hero from thine arms; And only ask’d to sigh alone, To look to heav’n, and weep him gone. Oh! soon shall all thy sorrow cease, And, to thine aching bosom, peace Shall quick return;—another tear To love and joy, supremely dear, Shall give thy gen’rous mind relief— That tear shall gem the laurel leaf.

So, in the silence of the night, Shines on the wave the lunar light; With its soft image, bright, imprest, It heaves, and seems to know no rest: Its agitation soon is o’er; It sighs, and dies along the shore!

274,"IN THE RUINS OF BERRY CASTLE, DEVONSHIRE.[7]","By your permission, Ladies! I address ye, And for the boon you grant, my Muse shall bless ye. I do not mean in solemn verse to tell What fate the race of Pomeroy befell; To trace the castle-story of each year, To learn how many owls have hooted here; What was the weight of stone, which form’d this pile, Will on your lovely cheeks awake no smile: Such antiquarian sermons suit not me, Nor any soul who loves festivity. Past times I heed not; be the present hour In life, while yet it blooms, my chosen flow’r, For well I know, what Time cannot disown, Amidst this mossy pile of mould’ring stone, That Hospitality was never seen To spread more social joy upon the green; Or, when its noble and capacious hall Rang with the gambol gay, or graceful ball, More beauty never charm’d its ancient beaux Than what its honour’d ruins now enclose. Thanks to the clouds, which from the soaking show’r Preserve the vot’ries of the present hour; For, strange to tell, beneath the chilling storm, Lately the rose reclin’d her frozen form; Yet since, beneath the favour of the weather, We are (a laughing group) conven’d together, Pray let the Muse pursue her merry route, To shew what pass’d before we all set out. To some fair damsel, who, intent to charm, Declares she thinks the weather fine and warm, Such words as these address her trembling ear— “I really think we shall have rain, my dear; Pray do not go, my love,” cries soft mama; “You shall not go, that’s flat,” cries stern papa. A lucky sunbeam shines on the discourse, The parents soften, and Miss mounts her horse. Each tickled with some laugh-inspiring notion, Behold the jocund party all in motion: Some by a rattling buggy are befriended, Some mount the cart—but not to be suspended. The mourning-coach[8] is wisely counter-order’d (The very thought on impious rashness border’d), Because the luckless vehicle, one night, Put all its merry mourners in a fright, Who, to conduct them to the masquerade, Sought from its crazy wheels their moving aid. Us’d to a soleme pace, the creaking load Bounded unwillingly along the road; Down came the whole—oh! what a sight was there! O’er a blind Fiddler roll’d a Flow’r-Nymph fair; A glitt’ring Spaniard, who had lost his nose, Roar’d out, “Oh! d—n it, take away your toes;” A blooming Nun fell plump upon a Jew, Still to the good old cause of traffic true, Buried in clothes, exclaim’d the son of barter, “Got blesh my shoul! you’ll shell this pretty garter?” Here let me pause;—the Muse, in sad affright, Turns from the dire disasters of that night; Quite panic-struck she drops her trembling plumes, And thus a moralizing theme assumes:— Know, gentle Ladies, once these shapeless walls, O’er whose grey wreck the shading ivy crawls, Compos’d a graceful mansion, whose fair mould Led from the road the trav’ller, to behold. Oft, when the morning ting’d the redd’ning skies, Far off the spiral smoke was seen to rise; At noon the hospitable board was spread, Then nappy ale made light the weary head; And when grey eve appear’d, in shadows damp, Each casement glitter’d with th’ enliv’ning lamp; Here the laugh titter’d, there the lute of Love Fill’d with its melody the moon-light grove: All, all are fled!—Time ruthless stalks around, And bends the crumbling ruin to the ground: Time, Ladies, too (I know you do not like him, And, if a fan could end him, you would strike him), Will with as little gallantry devour From your fair faces their bewitching pow’r; Then, like these ruins, beauteous in decay, Still shall you charm, and men shall still obey: Then, with remembrance soft, and tender smile, Perchance you’ll think upon this mossy pile; And, with a starting tear of joy declare, “Oh! how we laugh’d, how merry were we there!” "
275,"IN THE RUINS OF BERRY CASTLE, DEVONSHIRE.[7]","[7] The manor of Berry was given by William the Conqueror to one of his Normans, Ralph de la Pomerai, who built on it the castle which still bears his name, and in whose family it continued till the reign of Edward VI. when it was sold by Sir Thomas Pomeroy to Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, from whom it has descended to the present Duke. The castle is seated upon a rock, which rises almost perpendicularly from a narrow valley; through this valley winds a small stream of water, which drives the mill seen through the foliage of the surrounding woods from the turrets of the castle. In approaching the castle from the south, the path leads down the side of a hill through a thick wood; and on the north side of the valley, opposite the rock on which the castle stands, is a high ridge, partly covered with oak: these hills completely shut in the ruins on both sides. The valley stretches a considerable way both to the east and west, and opens a view at either end into the adjacent country. From the ivy-covered ruins of the fortress which now remain, it is scarcely possible to say what was its ancient form; but it is most generally supposed to have been quadrangular, having only one entrance, a large double portcullis, at the west end of the southern front, turreted and embattled, as was the whole of the front, with a tower at its eastern end, corresponding with that on the west. This front, with its gateway and turrets, are perhaps the only remains of the original structure. Winding steps, now almost worn away, lead to what once was a chapel, over the portcullis, and thence to the top of the turrets. In more modern times a magnificent building was erected within the walls of the castle by the Seymour family; but, although upwards of £20,000 were said to have been expended on it, it was never finished, and now the whole forms one common ruin, which, as it totters on it base, the spectator contemplates with awe, while he sighs over the remains of fallen grandeur.

Then, when the castle’s rocky form Rose ’mid the dark surrounding storm, The Harper had a sacred seat, Whence he might breathe his wild notes sweet. Oh! then, when many a twinkling star Shone in the azure vault afar, And mute was ev’ry mountain-bird, Soft music from the harp was heard; And when the morning’s blushes shed On hill, or tow’r, their varying red, Oh! then the harp was heard to cheer, With earliest sound, th’ enraptur’d ear; Then many a lady fair was known, With snowy hand, to wake its tone; And infant fingers press’d the string, And back recoil’d, to hear it sing. Sweet instrument! such was thy pow’r, ’Twas thine to gladden ev’ry hour; The young and old then honour’d thee, And smil’d to hear thy melody. "

519,"AT DRONNINGAARD, NEAR COPENHAGEN.","[14] Dronningaard is the first private residence in Denmark: it belongs to the wealthy family of the De Conincks. The grounds, which are very extensive, and tastefully laid out, slope down to a noble lake, twelve English miles in circumference, which is skirted with fine woods and romantic country-houses. At the end of a beautiful walk is an elegant marble column, with a tablet, on which is inscribed by Mr. D.C. “This monument is erected in gratitude to a mild and beneficent Government, under whose auspices I enjoy the blessings that surround me.” In another part of the grounds, in a spot of deep seclusion, are the ruins of a Hermitage; and a little further, in a nook, an open grave and tombstone. The story connected with this retired spot deserves to be mentioned:—Time has shed many snows upon the romantic beauties of Dronningaard, since one, who, weary of the pomp of courts and the tumult of camps, in the prime of life, covered with honours and with fortune, sought from its hospitable owner permission to raise a sequestered cell, in which he might pass the remainder of his days in all the austerities and privations of an Anchorite. This singular man had, long previously to the revolution in Holland, distinguished himself at the head of his regiment, when, in an unhappy moment, the love of aggrandizement took possession of his heart, and, marrying under its influence, misery soon followed; and here, in a little wood of tall firs, he raised this simple fabric: moss warmed it within, and the bark of the birch defended it without; a stream of rock-water once flowed in a bed of pebbles before the door, in which the young willow dipped its leaves; and, at a little distance from a bed of wild roses, the labernum gracefully rose, and suspended her yellow flowers; and adjoining was a spot which the Recluse had selected for his grave, of which, like the monks of La Trappe, he dug a small portion every day until he had finished it. He composed his Epitaph in French, and had it inscribed on a stone. If the reader is as much interested as I was in the history of the poor Hermit, he will be pleased with the translation of it, which follows, from the pen of my respected and distinguished friend, William Hayley, Esq. In this solitude he passed several years, when the plan of his life became suddenly reversed by a letter of recall, which he received from his Prince, containing the most flattering expressions of regard. He obeyed the summons, returned to Holland, and at the head of his regiment most gallantly fought and fell. "

521,THE HERMIT’S EPITAPH.,"Here may he rest, who, shunning scenes of strife, Enjoy’d at Dronningaard a Hermit’s life: The faithless splendour of a court he knew, And all the ardour of the tented field, Soft Passion’s idler charm, not less untrue, And all that listless Luxury can yield. He tasted, tender Love! thy chatter sweet; Thy promis’d happiness prov’d mere deceit. To Hymen’s hallow’d fane by Reason led, He deem’d the path he trod the path of bliss; Oh! ever-mourn’d mistake! from int’rest bred, Its dupe was plung’d in misery’s abyss: But Friendship offer’d him, benignant pow’r! Her cheering hand, in trouble’s darkest hour: Beside this shaded stream, her soothing voice Bade the disconsolate again rejoice: Peace in his heart revives, serenely sweet; The calm content, so sought for as his choice, Quits him no more in this belov’d retreat.

To-morrow our principal tools shall repair To this spot, to implore you to stay where you are: Little Jancourt, you know, has a tear at command, The rest shall have muslin-wrapp’d onions in hand; An expedient which you, my good Consul, must try, For a drop never yet wag observ’d in your eye! And therefore I think ’twould be better for you The largest to pluck from the beds of St Cloud. When these fellows appear, they shall fall at your feet, Portalis shall pen a few words to repeat; He shall state ’tis the nation’s imperial will That you do not your _dangerous promise_ fulfil; But snug in this closet put all into motion, Nor hazard your life with these sons of the ocean. _You_ shall say, “I have sworn by my glory to go;”   } _They_ shall all of them blubber out “No, no, no, no!} It must not, thou world’s second saviour! be so.          } If you go, mighty Chieftain! and should not escape, All Gallia, the world, will be cover’d with crape[15]!

When thrice sixty seconds have nearly expir’d (Now mind, my dear Consul, and do as desir’d), You must mimic some hero you’ve seen at the play, Of the tragical cast, when his soul melts away (And, without any compliment ’twixt you and I, You re’lly have talents and pow’rs very high, To make the most striking tragedian alive). But now to the point. You must tenderly strive To raise these sweet prostrates; then, heaving a sigh, And wiping the drops that shall stand in each eye, Like one sorely cross’d, you shall, weeping, exclaim, “Oh! why do you tear me from conquest and fame? But still, if the nation commands me, ’tis fit” (Your breast thumping hard) “that its Chief should submit.” Then you see, if the army of England should sail, And the schemes of this cursed armada should fail, In the _Moniteur’s_ faithful official page, I can humbug the people, and soften their rage; I will tell them, that, had but the nation permitted Her Chief to have gone, we had ne’er been outwitted; That merely the terrible glance of his eye Would have made all those shop-keeping islanders fly; This will quiet our friends, and, to harass our foes, A second invasion I’ll slyly propose, In which, in the van, Buonaparte shall pour His vengeance divine on that mercantile shore.

Juliana died here. The palace and grounds, parts of which are beautiful, were, when I visited them in 1804, much neglected. "

Tho’, when we met, the solar ray was gone, And on our steps the moon-beam only shone, Yet well I mark’d thy form and native grace, And all the sweet expression of thy face; And pleas’d I listen’d as thy accents fell, Accents that spoke a feeling mind so well Lo, when the birds repose at ev’ning hour, The sweetest of them carols from her bow’r!

674,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"For wan was her visage, and phrensied her eye, At her girdle a poniard she wore; Her bosom and limbs were expos’d to the sky, And her robe was besprinkled with gore. "
675,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Nature shudder’d, and sigh’d as the wild rabble past, Each flow’r droop’d its beautiful head; The groves became dusky, and moan’d in the blast, And Virtue and Innocence fled. "
676,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"She rose from her car ’midst the yell of her crew; Emblazon’d, a scroll she unfurl’d, And on it the dreams of Philosophy drew; “’Tis the Charter, she cried, of the World.” "
677,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Plunder, keen-ey’d and lean, rang with plaudits the sky, Murder grinn’d as he whetted his steel; While Blasphemy swore the Redeemer on high Was the creature of Folly and Zeal. "

688,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"But England disdain’d to the Tyrant to bend; Still erect, undismay’d, she was found; Infuriate, he swore that “his bolt should descend,” And her temples should fall to the ground. "

690,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Oh! banish the thought; for, learn ’tis in vain, Thus, thou maniac Tyrant, to boast; As soon shall her base be remov’d by the main, As her empire by thee and thy host. "
691,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"The sound is gone forth, ’tis recorded above, To the mountain it spread from the vale; “Our God, and our King, and our Country, we love, And for them we will die or prevail.” "
692,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Then hasten the day, if thy threat be sincere, Let the winds blow thy myriads along; Then soon may thy boasted armada appear, And our rocks catch thy death-breathing song. "
693,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Thy guardian, foul deity! hideous with crime, Shall view, as she moves to our shore, The Genius of Britain, mild, brave, and sublime, And shall boast her achievements no more. "

695,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"In Heaven, with smiles, shall the happy and blest Lean over its bright-beaming walls, To guide and support to the regions of rest The soul of the patriot who falls. "
696,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"Britannia! thy Muse, on a rock high and steep, The fate of the fight shall proclaim; The strings of her lyre Inspiration shall sweep, Recording each hero by name. "
697,THE FURY OF DISCORD,"The world to its centre shall shake with delight, As thus she announces their fall; “They sink! our invaders submit to our might, The ocean has buried them all!” "

716,THE MUSHROOM.,"Awake, my Muse! awake each slumb’ring string, And (mighty subject!) of a Mushroom sing, Fair to the eye, and pleasant to the taste; Charm’d by the note, a pigmy group, in haste, Lay down their grainy loads, as slow they move Thro’ lanes of reed and grass, to them a grove! As if an Orpheus thou, they gather round, Erect their tiny ears, and drink the sound. Gray was the sky, save where the eastern ray O’er fragrant hills proclaim’d th’ approaching day; Rurilla, loveliest virgin of the plain, With spirits light, and mind without a stain, Rose from her simple bed, refresh’d with rest; Ah, Sleep! with marble finger had’st thou prest Her lovely eyelids till a later hour, And by a blissful vision’s fairy pow’r Hadst thou impress’d her mind with forms of love, The walk at eve, the kiss, the murm’ring dove, The little nymph had never sought the plain, Nor fill’d with one romantic thought this brain. In russet gown, with sweet and simple air, She issued forth, like Hebe, young and fair, To neighb’ring field, fresh as the rosy dawn; Nor stile oppos’d her; like a bounding fawn Graceful she sprang: so prankish was the air, Had but the love-sick Daphanel been there, He would have sigh’d: alas! poor love-sick fool! Thou rather Zephyr dost inflame than cool! And now, my Muse, the fatal spot disclose, Where, bath’d with dew, the modest Mushroom rose. Less fair the swan, by Richmond’s flow’ry side, That in the river views herself with pride, As, gazing on her, some their stay prolong, To see her sail in majesty along. Ill-fated child of earth! thy charms so fair, As oft with youthful beauty, prove thy snare: Now, as with dewy-spangled feet is seen The lovely maid to trace each ringlet green, Not distant far thy skin of velvet white She views, and to thee presses with delight Oh! might some deity, with potent arm, Arrest her flight, and alter ev’ry charm; Like Niobe dissolve into a tear, Or like the Delian virgin, when with fear She fled!—See on each beauteous limb appear Soft leaves and flow’rs, the sweetest of the year; And, taking root, spread round her fragrant breath O’er the fair form that now she dooms to death: But, ah! in vain, the pray’r no goddess hears;     } She bends—she plucks—and, bath’d in purple tears,} The much-priz’d victim in her lap she bears!       } Tears that, preserv’d in crystal, will prolong, And paint its worth beyond this simple song.

728,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"These bays be thine; and, tho’ not form’d to shine Clear as thy colour, faultless as thy line, Yet shall the Muse essay, in humble verse, Thy merits, lovely Painting! to rehearse. As when the demon of the winter storm Robs each sweet flow’ret of its beauteous form, The Spirit of the stream, in crystal wave, Sleeps whilst the chilling blasts above him rave, Till the Sun spreads his animating fires, And sullen Darkness from the scene retires, Then mountain-nymphs discard their robes of snow, And in green mantles smile in roseate glow, And rivers, loosen’d from their icy chain, Spread joy and richness thro’ the verdant plain, Thus, in those climes where skies are ever fair, Each infant Science breath’d a genial air, Climes where the Earth her stores to all resign’d, Nor left one selfish passion to the mind; On her green lap the swain reclin’d his head, And found his banquet where he found his bed. Then Painting grew, and from the shades of flow’rs[20] There first essay’d her imitative pow’rs, When, urg’d by plunder, with the torrent’s might, Nerv’d by the storm, and harden’d in the fight, A race barbarian left their forests wild, And sought the spot where Love and Learning smil’d. By Taste unsoften’d, these relentless droves Burst, fair Italia! thro’ thy sacred groves, Laid ev’ry flow’r of Art and Fancy waste, And pour’d a winter o’er the realms of Taste, Each Science trembled at the ruffian sound, Forsook her shades, and fled her classic ground; The lofty column prostrate in the dust, Defac’d the arch, o’erthrown the matchless bust; The shatter’d fresco animates no more, And ruthless winds thro’ clefted temples roar! Florence beheld the scene with sad surprise, And bade the prostrate pile in grandeur rise. Then, oh! thou truly “Father of the Art[21]!” ’Twas thine superior vigour to impart; Illustrious Cimabue! it was thine To soar beyond Example’s bounded line, And, as the Heav’n-directed sceptre’s shock, Produc’d full torrents from the flinty rock, So streams of taste obey’d thy pencil’s call, And Nature seem’d to start from out the wall. Hail, beauteous art! oh! that in equal lay Could but my Muse thy various pow’rs convey! ’Tis thine with silent eloquence to shew Passion’s strong image, Beauty’s rapt’rous glow, To soothe the parted lover’s anxious care, Who owns thee fairest of thy sisters fair; When waves divide him, still thro’ thee to trace The dear resemblance of that cherish’d face, Which he so oft with trembling lips has prest, So often gaz’d upon, so often blest! Thine too it is to seek the verdant plains Where Peace resides, where Rustic Beauty reigns; Or bid the torrent on thy canvass roar, Or calmly spread the yellow winding shore; Or show, from some vast cliff’s extremest verge, The frail bark combating the angry surge. Oft too on some lone turret wilt thou stand, To trace the fury of th’ embattled band, To darken with the clouds of death the skies, And bid the scenes of blood and havoc rise! Such, and far more, thy pow’rs, bless’d art! to thee Inferior far descriptive Poesy; And tho’ sweet Music, when she strikes the strings, When thro’ the grove with seraph-voice she sings, The soul, enraptur’d with the thrilling stream, Would hail the Maid of Harmony supreme! Yet, while her dulcet sounds enchant, they die;} So shooting stars illume the midnight sky,     } And, as we wonder, vanish from the eye.        } But when resistless Death, in mournful hour, Withdraws the drooping painter’s mimic pow’r, Improv’d by time, his works still charm the sight, And thro’ successive ages yield delight Greece early bade the painter’s pencil trace Each form with force; to force she added grace: For this her Zeuxis she a garland wove, For[22] that Apelles won her grateful love. Chiefly she called on Painting’s magic powers To deck the guardians of her lofty tow’rs; Here[23] Jove in lightning show’d his awful mien. There Venus with her doves was smiling seen! Till ruthless Time, with unabating flight, O’er Grecian grandeur flung the shades of night Long did they settle o’er the darken’d world. Till Raphael’s hand the sable curtain furl’d; A pious calm, an elevated grace, Then on the canvass mark’d th’ Apostle’s face; Devout applauses ev’ry feature drew, E’en[24] such as graceful Sculpture never knew. In nearer times, and on a neighb’ring shore, Painting but feebly shone, obscur’d by pow’r. See Rubens’ soul indignantly advance, Press’d by the pride and vanity of France; Behold,[25] in fulsome allegory spread, The gaudy iris o’er the victor’s head! See Genius, deaf to Nature’s nobler call, Waste all its strength upon the banner’d hall! E’en now, tho’ Gallia, in her blood-stain’d car, Spreads over Europe all the woes of war, Still with consummate craft she tries to prove How much the peaceful charms engage her love: Treasures of art in lengthen’d gall’ries glow, And[26] Europe’s plunder Europe’s plund’rers show! Yet of her living artists few can claim Half the mix’d praise that waits on David’s fame. Thrice happy Britain! in thy favour’d isle The sister Arts in health and beauty smile! Tho’ no Imperial Gall’ries grace thy shores, Tho’ wealth the public bounty seldom pours, Yet private taste rewards thy painter’s toil, And bids his genius grace his native soil. Bless’d country! here thy artists can supply Abundant charms to fix th’ admiring eye: In furtive splendour ne’er art thou array’d, No plunder’d country mourns thy ruthless blade, Sees its transported treasures torn away, To grace a fierce ambitious Tyrant’s sway. Long in this isle, where Freedom finds repose, Whilst, raving round her, loud the tempest blows, Oh! long befriended, may the Arts excel, And bless the sacred spot they love so well! "
729,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[20] “_Then painting grew, and from the shades_,” &c.—The shadows of plants, and indeed of every object in Nature, must, at a very early period, have furnished ideas of imitation. "
730,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[21] _“Then, oh! thou_,” &c.—After the ravages of the northern barbarians, painting was revived in Italy, about the fourteenth century, by Cimabue, who was hence styled the Father of Painting. "
731,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[22] “_For that Apelles_,” &c.—Painting attained so great a perfection amongst the Greeks, under Zeuxis, that Apelles found nothing wanting but grace, which in those times he bestowed upon the art, as Corregio did after Raphael. "
732,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[23] “_Here Jove in_,” &c.—The Greeks excelled in the delineation of their deities, to whom they attributed all the human passions: their Jupiter they elevated to the highest degree of majesty, their Venus to the utmost pitch of human beauty. "
733,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[24] “_E’en such as graceful Sculpture_,” &c.—From Cimabue to Raphael, the painters were employed by the church; and they gave a character to the Prophets, Apostles, and our Saviour, which was never known to the ancient sculptors. The power which the former possessed of uniting dignity to humility is without a parallel. "
734,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[25] “_Behold, in fulsome allegory_,” &c.—As long as the French school adhered to the principles of the Italian school, it produced many great masters; however, the art certainly degenerated after Raphael, by being employed in adulatory allegory, in honour of Princes, as is to be seen in the works of Rubens and Le Brun at Paris, artists of great talents, which they were led to misapply, through the supreme vanity of Louis the Fourteenth. "
735,TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST.,"[26] “_And Europe’s plunder_,” &c.—Those who have visited the Napoleon Gallery at Paris can attest the truth of this observation, as those who are acquainted with the modern state of painting in France well know, and, knowing, cannot but be surprised at, the small number of French painters of any tolerable celebrity.
