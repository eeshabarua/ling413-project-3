382,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"I wandered forth upon the shore,"

472,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"My sin, my misery--and my tears"
473,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),Fell thick and fast upon the sands;
474,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"I hid my face within my hands,"
475,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),For tears are strange that find their way

489,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),In anger had almost replied--
490,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),An aged man was at my side;

497,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"As our great Father, when he sat"

511,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),But in this old man’s speech and tone

521,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"And how I thought to arm my soul,"
522,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),And stablish it in self-controul;
523,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"And said I would obey the right,"
