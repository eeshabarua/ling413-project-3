                           III

He was that God, for man which spake
  From Sinai forth in thunder;
He was that Love, for man which brake
  The dreadful grave asunder.
      Lord over every lord,
      His consecrating word
      An earthly prince awaits;
      Lift then your heads, ye gates!
        Your King comes riding under.
