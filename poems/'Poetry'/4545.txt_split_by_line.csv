21,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
22,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Post Annulment 2
23,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
24,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Afferent, the city bus cramps to the curb and brakes"
25,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,through
26,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Solipsistic muteness
27,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,With an exhaltation startled and choking.
28,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As the sun blazes upon the terminal's
29,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Scraped concrete
30,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The shelved rows of the poor men
31,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Hear the sound die on the pavement
32,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In a gradual dying echo.
33,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,A cigarette succumbs to the voice as
34,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Carrion brought to life; all the tattered people
35,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,awaken;
36,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"And a man spits toward the tire of the bus,"
37,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,But misses.
38,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
39,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And as he watches his own spit vanish
40,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"From the hard crest of the world,"
41,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And silently scrapes his lunch pail against
42,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,A corner of a metallic bench as if expecting the pale
43,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,to bleed...
44,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And hoping it would bleed...he tries to remember the
45,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,angles
46,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He and his wife stood to project
47,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The intermingled shadows that both
48,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Had labeled as their marriage.
49,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
50,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He enters the second bus:
51,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Its coolness sedating the skin that
52,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Overlaps his troubled mind.
53,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,His thoughts pull together
54,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Like the light, cool flow of the air conditioning."
55,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He feels a little pacified.
56,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He knows the shadow's intangible depth:
57,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Its vastness having overpowered him these months
58,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Until he could not reach the logic that told him
59,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To find himself outside its barriers.
60,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As he stares out of the window
61,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He wonders why she has left.
62,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,How could she have left without indication
63,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,When he has remained angled toward work
64,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,So that he and his wife can stay alive?
65,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In the bus window he sees his diaphanous face--the
66,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,windows
67,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Of the Hilton, where he has a job in maintenance,"
68,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Piercing solidly through its head.  He rings the bell.
69,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
70,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"The idea of her not home, and legally annulled"
71,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,From his life--her small crotch not tightened to his
72,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,desperate
73,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Thrusts--makes him feel sick.  He gets down from the
74,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,bus.
75,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He goes to work.  He suddenly knows that being in love
76,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,is not love.

80,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Earth
81,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
82,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
83,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,I use her earth to plant my seed--
84,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"My limbs twisting around the collective molecules,"
85,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Trying to dig in.
86,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Only the obscurity of my body
87,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Presses so fully that it is neither
88,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Body nor bed nor the intersection of both,"
89,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,But euphoric traction;
90,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"And then, planted and repulsed,"
91,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Only the seam of backbone minutely faces her,"
92,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,That bed of earth.
93,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,With all conscious force
94,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,I breathe the aloneness that intangibly defines the
95,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Air.  I swallow its ambrosia
96,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Of depth and ask myself
97,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Why I ever married the woman.
98,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,There is void.
99,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Then a hollow answer calls my name and says ""it was"
100,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"time."""
101,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"I realize myself in movement, parting the scene."
102,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
103,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,I use what has been planted for the reaping--
104,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,My suit tucks me into its structure of cotton;
105,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And soon a building will be again the structure
106,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Around men of cotton suits, pushing a product."
107,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
108,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Lost, I drink my coffee alone on the stoop."
109,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She had asked to fix me breakfast
110,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,But I would not let her.
111,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,My miniature is one and black.
112,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,I drink me in when I am not
113,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Pressed by the coffee's steam.
114,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Cars' casketed phantoms of people
115,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Chasing up and down Dunlavy Street of Houston
116,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,After something--their whole lives after something--
117,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Come and go from consciousness like respiration.
118,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The people plant and reap.
119,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Who can count all of their
120,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Insignificant names?--
121,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Animals that are not created sensible enough
122,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"To propagate unless lost to frenzy,"
123,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Caught in structures without meaning.

130,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We Mongoled Human experience.
131,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We pushed it into our mouths
132,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As the crisp pretzels of which the shape became salty
133,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,dust
134,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"At our tastes: the crispness of life,"
135,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And we Mongoled human experience.

140,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Maddening consumption, was what we left"
141,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Our wives for; and then hardened ourselves on
142,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The springless cushions of the sofas of our friends
143,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Whom we eventually forgot the names of:
144,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"The wetness of human experience that we Mongoled,"
145,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And felt the bladed emptiness
146,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Of stomachs that could not consume food
147,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,On mornings after.  But the Angels of bar rooms
148,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,continually
149,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Appeared before darkened stages where, in front of"
150,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"guitars,"
151,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We played.  They apppeared at various stages to the
152,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,weeks of the years.
153,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"They came, silently whispering themselves off"
154,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As Sandras or Cassandras;
155,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Stared up at us for two hours; and disappeared.
156,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"The reappearance of their light enamored us, and we"
157,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,left
158,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And followed but found bats that offered
159,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"No shelter, and often caves we could not fit into"
160,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Or were forbidden from entering.
161,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
162,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We invested our capital
163,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In the Silicon Valleys of this great nation.
164,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Third-world bitches, in factories, became sick for our"
165,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,chips.
166,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We held power.
167,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We bred metals and bought the ownership titles
168,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Of properties, but could not find a home of the world."
169,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
170,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,We married again and brought forth children
171,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Who were duplicate strangers of ourselves.

180,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The whole seated body sticking slightly
181,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As moaning howls come from his
182,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Paralyzed mouth.
183,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,It is after having

185,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,That this woman who would dab the bile
186,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,From his bed like one who napkins a spill from

194,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,No woman to drag him from
195,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"The pot,"
196,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,After she has had his body bent
197,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Toward her for the wiping,"
198,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And flop him onto the bench
199,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In the shower; no woman...
200,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
201,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"She sits, cigarette limp in her mouth,"
202,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Thinking that the day has almost ended.

204,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,From the living room of the group home
205,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She remembers are other earths limping

218,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In Houston the Boat-People

225,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,

227,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The settled imagination of a

229,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Allows a mangled brown horse
230,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To elongate and flatten out
231,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To the reality of the rolled up carpet
232,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,(All because of the rain).
233,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She feels the wetness now beginning
234,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To seep into her clothes;
235,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She raises herself; she sees the old Cuban

243,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Both extensive and inadequate;
244,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And she follows him.
245,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
246,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Apart
247,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And yet they both think about the Vietnamese

249,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Who yells ""boo"" behind doors"
250,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,That are entered;
251,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The Cambodian boy who
252,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To the view of the Montrose area
253,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Pours on the bare shrubs,"
254,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"And then strips and pours upon himself,"

257,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As if they have been greased;
258,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Falling into Houston's world of high buildings
259,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,From the descending planes
260,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,While hoping that the big world would
261,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Not overpower their memories;
262,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"And the Cubans, in house #2 always yelling of ""Miami."""
263,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
264,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,They believe that Cambodian refugees
265,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Always clean house #1,"
266,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"That Africans never clean themselves,"
267,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,and that Laotians often pour rice down the drains
268,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Causing the faucets of the house to stop-up;

271,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And a little food or take them on little trips
272,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To the Social Security Office or the doctor's office
273,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Past 5 p.m.--
274,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"But of different seconds in that minute,"
275,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Different lengths, and various perceptions."
276,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She remembers the ugly man
277,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,In Vietnam that ran from the police
278,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And then a scar around his eye
279,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Opened from the clubs and the blood
280,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Tried to escape him completely
281,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,As the body attempted to pull itself
282,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"From the street, and could not."
283,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He remembers thinking that the
284,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Cranium of an old man is always heavy
285,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"On the neck, and that his"
286,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Is becoming like this.
287,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,
288,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He desires to clasp the gate

293,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And instantly gone.
294,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,He desires to arrive there and
295,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Read a few tombstones
296,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Before and after watching.
297,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She desires to imagine horses

300,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,She desires to follow the Cuban that she fears
301,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Since he is moving away from the refugee houses.
302,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,There are no horses in inner-city; and
303,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,The Hispanic cemetery cannot be found
304,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,To souls wanting to rest there.
305,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"""Este cerca de calle Alabama?"""

309,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,peel their sounds from a roof.
310,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And he notices her steps
311,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,Despite the stronger sounds; halts;
312,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"And glances behind him as shingles fall ahead,"
313,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,While wanting her to completely leave him
314,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,And wanting her to come with him.
315,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,

332,AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS: 25 POEMS,"Because the hotdogs are overpriced,"

1492,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Televised voices discussing laws of limits
1493,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,In openness and freedoms
1494,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And ramifications.  He did not understand--
1495,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"As the mirrors steamed, dripped"
1496,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"Down from the air conditioning's touch, and resteamed"
1497,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,When it shut off;
1498,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And when he wondered what home owners
1499,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Had used the bathtub before
1500,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And what disease might be
1501,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Dropping from the cracks around the faucet--that
1502,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,The fags would push down the American way of life.
1503,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,He did not argue that if they were isolated
1504,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"From the mainstream, their liquids might get off on"
1505,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,any
1506,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Products as they worked for the cost of their
1507,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,isolation
1508,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"In, for example, a barren region of Texas;"
1509,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"And that the isolated would, by the testing of the"
1510,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"Virus, be proven witches"
1511,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,So there would not have to be witch hunts--
1512,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"No, he just felt their destruction."
1513,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,
1514,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And he thought of his woman
1515,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"In the bedroom, waiting, and became"
1516,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Forgetful of anything
1517,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,But the desire to have her.
1518,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,They had that freedom.  The American constitution
1519,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Said so---freedom to live and breathe
1520,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And fuck and fuck..
1521,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Fuck so hard that the penis would
1522,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Knive through the condom
1523,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And spray-paint the man's name
1524,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,On the dull walls of the vagina.
1525,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,They had that freedom--those inalienable rights--
1526,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Her to be banged and to squeal
1527,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,To her friends that she was in love
1528,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And him to white pussy
1529,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And a gal that he could call his own...
1530,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,His woman.  And if the initial M got ready
1531,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,To graffito-crawl his way out--
1532,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,A problem for the rest of their years---
1533,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"She could erase it, not remembering it"
1534,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,With any more significance than
1535,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Having clipped a broken end
1536,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Of a fingernail.  She had that right.
1537,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"Her man said so, and so said"
1538,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,The American constitution.
1539,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,
1540,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,His shift in Toastmaster
1541,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,"Had for that day ended,"
1542,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And so now he could rest in waters;
1543,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Focus on the bubbles that rose
1544,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,When he farted; and let the memories
1545,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Of the entire day be released to rise and fall
1546,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Like the steam.
1547,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,He would have to scrub himself
1548,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Good before going to his woman:
1549,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,She understood money
1550,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,With its charm of a cocaine high--
1551,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Although the need for dominance
1552,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,And the breaking of rules
1553,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Made her love him
1554,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Who still did not supply her with all of her needs--
1555,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,But the composite smell of the factory and the drugs
1556,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,That he sold after each shift
1557,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,Would lessen the good feelings that made
1558,'ALL BUT ONE DEAD:,That understanding.
