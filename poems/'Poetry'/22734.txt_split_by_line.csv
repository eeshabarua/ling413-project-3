123,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,in the flush of a march
124,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,Softly-impulsive advancing as water towards a weir
125,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,from the arch
126,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,Of shadow emerging as blood emerges from inward
127,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,shades of our night
128,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,"Encroaching towards a crisis, a meeting, a spasm and"
129,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,throb of delight.

131,EVOLUTIONS OF SOLDIERS,"The wave of soldiers, the coming wave, the throbbing"

151,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,
152,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"THE chime of the bells, and the church clock"
153,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,striking eight
154,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,Solemnly and distinctly cries down the babel
155,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,of children still playing in the hay.
156,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"The church draws nearer upon us, gentle and great"
157,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"In shadow, covering us up with her grey."
158,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,
159,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,Like drowsy children the houses fall asleep
160,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"Under the fleece of shadow, as in between"
161,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"Tall and dark the church moves, anxious to keep"
162,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"Their sleeping, cover them soft unseen."
163,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,
164,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,"Hardly a murmur comes from the sleeping brood,"
165,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,I wish the church had covered me up with the rest
166,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,In the home-place. Why is it she should exclude
167,THE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING,Me so distinctly from sleeping with those I love best?

170,LAST HOURS,LAST HOURS
171,LAST HOURS,
172,LAST HOURS,THE cool of an oak's unchequered shade
173,LAST HOURS,Falls on me as I lie in deep grass
174,LAST HOURS,"Which rushes upward, blade beyond blade,"
175,LAST HOURS,While higher the darting grass-flowers pass
176,LAST HOURS,Piercing the blue with their crocketed spires
177,LAST HOURS,"And waving flags, and the ragged fires"
178,LAST HOURS,"Of the sorrel's cresset--a green, brave town"
179,LAST HOURS,"Vegetable, new in renown."
180,LAST HOURS,
181,LAST HOURS,"Over the tree's edge, as over a mountain"
182,LAST HOURS,"Surges the white of the moon,"
183,LAST HOURS,"A cloud comes up like the surge of a fountain,"
184,LAST HOURS,"Pressing round and low at first, but soon"
185,LAST HOURS,Heaving and piling a round white dome.
186,LAST HOURS,How lovely it is to be at home
187,LAST HOURS,Like an insect in the grass
188,LAST HOURS,Letting life pass.
189,LAST HOURS,
190,LAST HOURS,There's a scent of clover crept through my hair
191,LAST HOURS,From the full resource of some purple dome
192,LAST HOURS,"Where that lumbering bee, who can hardly bear"
193,LAST HOURS,"His burden above me, never has clomb."
194,LAST HOURS,But not even the scent of insouciant flowers
195,LAST HOURS,Makes pause the hours.
196,LAST HOURS,
197,LAST HOURS,Down the valley roars a townward train.
198,LAST HOURS,I hear it through the grass
199,LAST HOURS,Dragging the links of my shortening chain
200,LAST HOURS,"Southwards, alas!"

241,AFTER THE OPERA,AFTER THE OPERA
242,AFTER THE OPERA,
243,AFTER THE OPERA,DOWN the stone stairs
244,AFTER THE OPERA,Girls with their large eyes wide with tragedy
245,AFTER THE OPERA,Lift looks of shocked and momentous emotion
246,AFTER THE OPERA,up at me.
247,AFTER THE OPERA,And I smile.
248,AFTER THE OPERA,
249,AFTER THE OPERA,Ladies
250,AFTER THE OPERA,Stepping like birds with their bright and pointed feet
251,AFTER THE OPERA,"Peer anxiously forth, as if for a boat to carry them out"
252,AFTER THE OPERA,"of the wreckage,"
253,AFTER THE OPERA,And among the wreck of the theatre crowd
254,AFTER THE OPERA,I stand and smile.
255,AFTER THE OPERA,
256,AFTER THE OPERA,They take tragedy so becomingly.
257,AFTER THE OPERA,Which pleases me.
258,AFTER THE OPERA,
259,AFTER THE OPERA,But when I meet the weary eyes
260,AFTER THE OPERA,The reddened aching eyes of the bar-man with thin
261,AFTER THE OPERA,"arms,"
262,AFTER THE OPERA,I am glad to go back to where I came from.

266,GOING BACK,
267,GOING BACK,"THE NIGHT turns slowly round,"
268,GOING BACK,Swift trains go by in a rush of light;
269,GOING BACK,Slow trains steal past.
270,GOING BACK,"This train beats anxiously, outward bound."
271,GOING BACK,
272,GOING BACK,But I am not here.
273,GOING BACK,"I am away, beyond the scope of this turning;"
274,GOING BACK,"There, where the pivot is, the axis"
275,GOING BACK,Of all this gear.
276,GOING BACK,
277,GOING BACK,"I, who sit in tears,"
278,GOING BACK,"I, whose heart is torn with parting;"
279,GOING BACK,Who cannot bear to think back to the departure
280,GOING BACK,platform;
281,GOING BACK,My spirit hears
282,GOING BACK,
283,GOING BACK,Voices of men
284,GOING BACK,"Sound of artillery, aeroplanes, presences,"
285,GOING BACK,"And more than all, the dead-sure silence,"
286,GOING BACK,The pivot again.
287,GOING BACK,
288,GOING BACK,"There, at the axis"
289,GOING BACK,"Pain, or love, or grief"
290,GOING BACK,Sleep on speed; in dead certainty;
291,GOING BACK,Pure relief.
292,GOING BACK,
293,GOING BACK,"There, at the pivot"
294,GOING BACK,Time sleeps again.
295,GOING BACK,"No has-been, no here-after; only the perfected"

299,ON THE MARCH,ON THE MARCH
300,ON THE MARCH,
301,ON THE MARCH,WE are out on the open road.
302,ON THE MARCH,Through the low west window a cold light
303,ON THE MARCH,flows
304,ON THE MARCH,On the floor where never my numb feet trode
305,ON THE MARCH,Before; onward the strange road goes.
306,ON THE MARCH,
307,ON THE MARCH,Soon the spaces of the western sky
308,ON THE MARCH,With shutters of sombre cloud will close.
309,ON THE MARCH,"But we'll still be together, this road and I,"
310,ON THE MARCH,"Together, wherever the long road goes."
311,ON THE MARCH,
312,ON THE MARCH,"The wind chases by us, and over the corn"
313,ON THE MARCH,Pale shadows flee from us as if from their foes.
314,ON THE MARCH,"Like a snake we thresh on the long, forlorn"
315,ON THE MARCH,"Land, as onward the long road goes."
316,ON THE MARCH,
317,ON THE MARCH,"From the sky, the low, tired moon fades out;"
318,ON THE MARCH,Through the poplars the night-wind blows;
319,ON THE MARCH,"Pale, sleepy phantoms are tossed about"
320,ON THE MARCH,As the wind asks whither the wan road goes.
321,ON THE MARCH,
322,ON THE MARCH,Away in the distance wakes a lamp.
323,ON THE MARCH,Inscrutable small lights glitter in rows.
324,ON THE MARCH,"But they come no nearer, and still we tramp"
325,ON THE MARCH,"Onward, wherever the strange road goes."
326,ON THE MARCH,
327,ON THE MARCH,Beat after beat falls sombre and dull.
328,ON THE MARCH,"The wind is unchanging, not one of us knows"
329,ON THE MARCH,What will be in the final lull
330,ON THE MARCH,When we find the place where this dead road goes.
331,ON THE MARCH,
332,ON THE MARCH,"For something must come, since we pass and pass"
333,ON THE MARCH,"Along in the coiled, convulsive throes"
334,ON THE MARCH,"Of this marching, along with the invisible grass"
335,ON THE MARCH,That goes wherever this old road goes.
336,ON THE MARCH,
337,ON THE MARCH,Perhaps we shall come to oblivion.
338,ON THE MARCH,Perhaps we shall march till our tired toes
339,ON THE MARCH,"Tread over the edge of the pit, and we're gone"
340,ON THE MARCH,Down the endless slope where the last road goes.
341,ON THE MARCH,
342,ON THE MARCH,"If so, let us forge ahead, straight on"
343,ON THE MARCH,If we're going to sleep the sleep with those
344,ON THE MARCH,"That fall forever, knowing none"
345,ON THE MARCH,Of this land whereon the wrong road goes.
346,ON THE MARCH,
347,ON THE MARCH,
348,BOMBARDMENT,BOMBARDMENT
349,BOMBARDMENT,
350,BOMBARDMENT,THE TOWN has opened to the sun.
351,BOMBARDMENT,Like a flat red lily with a million petals
352,BOMBARDMENT,"She unfolds, she comes undone."
353,BOMBARDMENT,
354,BOMBARDMENT,A sharp sky brushes upon
355,BOMBARDMENT,The myriad glittering chimney-tips
356,BOMBARDMENT,As she gently exhales to the sun.
357,BOMBARDMENT,
358,BOMBARDMENT,Hurrying creatures run
359,BOMBARDMENT,Down the labyrinth of the sinister flower.
360,BOMBARDMENT,What is it they shun?
361,BOMBARDMENT,
362,BOMBARDMENT,A dark bird falls from the sun.
363,BOMBARDMENT,It curves in a rush to the heart of the vast
364,BOMBARDMENT,Flower: the day has begun.
365,BOMBARDMENT,
366,BOMBARDMENT,
367,WINTER-LULL,WINTER-LULL
368,WINTER-LULL,
369,WINTER-LULL,"Because of the silent snow, we are all hushed"
370,WINTER-LULL,Into awe.
371,WINTER-LULL,"No sound of guns, nor overhead no rushed"
372,WINTER-LULL,Vibration to draw
373,WINTER-LULL,Our attention out of the void wherein we are crushed.
374,WINTER-LULL,
375,WINTER-LULL,A crow floats past on level wings
376,WINTER-LULL,Noiselessly.
377,WINTER-LULL,Uninterrupted silence swings
378,WINTER-LULL,"Invisibly, inaudibly"
379,WINTER-LULL,To and fro in our misgivings.
380,WINTER-LULL,
381,WINTER-LULL,"We do not look at each other, we hide"
382,WINTER-LULL,Our daunted eyes.
383,WINTER-LULL,"White earth, and ruins, ourselves, and nothing beside."
384,WINTER-LULL,It all belies
385,WINTER-LULL,"Our existence; we wait, and are still denied."
386,WINTER-LULL,
387,WINTER-LULL,"We are folded together, men and the snowy ground"
388,WINTER-LULL,Into nullity.
389,WINTER-LULL,"There is silence, only the silence, never a sound"
390,WINTER-LULL,Nor a verity
391,WINTER-LULL,To assist us; disastrously silence-bound!
392,WINTER-LULL,
393,WINTER-LULL,
394,THE ATTACK,THE ATTACK
395,THE ATTACK,
396,THE ATTACK,WHEN we came out of the wood
397,THE ATTACK,Was a great light!
398,THE ATTACK,The night uprisen stood
399,THE ATTACK,In white.
400,THE ATTACK,
401,THE ATTACK,"I wondered, I looked around"
402,THE ATTACK,It was so fair. The bright
403,THE ATTACK,Stubble upon the ground
404,THE ATTACK,Shone white
405,THE ATTACK,
406,THE ATTACK,Like any field of snow;
407,THE ATTACK,Yet warm the chase
408,THE ATTACK,Of faint night-breaths did go
409,THE ATTACK,Across my face!
410,THE ATTACK,
411,THE ATTACK,"White-bodied and warm the night was,"
412,THE ATTACK,Sweet-scented to hold in my throat.
413,THE ATTACK,White and alight the night was.
414,THE ATTACK,A pale stroke smote
415,THE ATTACK,
416,THE ATTACK,The pulse through the whole bland being
417,THE ATTACK,Which was This and me;
418,THE ATTACK,"A pulse that still went fleeing,"
419,THE ATTACK,Yet did not flee.
420,THE ATTACK,
421,THE ATTACK,"After the terrible rage, the death,"
422,THE ATTACK,This wonder stood glistening?
423,THE ATTACK,"All shapes of wonder, with suspended breath,"
424,THE ATTACK,Arrested listening
425,THE ATTACK,
426,THE ATTACK,In ecstatic reverie.
427,THE ATTACK,"The whole, white Night!--"
428,THE ATTACK,"With wonder, every black tree"
429,THE ATTACK,Blossomed outright.
430,THE ATTACK,
431,THE ATTACK,I saw the transfiguration
432,THE ATTACK,And the present Host.
433,THE ATTACK,Transubstantiation
434,THE ATTACK,Of the Luminous Ghost.
435,THE ATTACK,
436,THE ATTACK,
437,OBSEQUIAL ODE,OBSEQUIAL ODE
438,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
439,OBSEQUIAL ODE,SURELY you've trodden straight
440,OBSEQUIAL ODE,To the very door!
441,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Surely you took your fate
442,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Faultlessly. Now it's too late
443,OBSEQUIAL ODE,To say more.
444,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
445,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"It is evident you were right,"
446,OBSEQUIAL ODE,That man has a course to go
447,OBSEQUIAL ODE,A voyage to sail beyond the charted seas.
448,OBSEQUIAL ODE,You have passed from out of sight
449,OBSEQUIAL ODE,And my questions blow
450,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Back from the straight horizon that ends all one sees.
451,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
452,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Now like a vessel in port
453,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"You unlade your riches unto death,"
454,OBSEQUIAL ODE,And glad are the eager dead to receive you there.
455,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Let the dead sort
456,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"Your cargo out, breath from breath"
457,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"Let them disencumber your bounty, let them all share."
458,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
459,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"I imagine dead hands are brighter,"
460,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Their fingers in sunset shine
461,OBSEQUIAL ODE,With jewels of passion once broken through you as a
462,OBSEQUIAL ODE,prism
463,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Breaks light into jewels; and dead breasts whiter
464,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"For your wrath; and yes, I opine"
465,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"They anoint their brows with your blood, as a perfect"
466,OBSEQUIAL ODE,chrism.
467,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
468,OBSEQUIAL ODE,"On your body, the beaten anvil,"
469,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Was hammered out
470,OBSEQUIAL ODE,That moon-like sword the ascendant dead unsheathe
471,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Against us; sword that no man will
472,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Put to rout;
473,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Sword that severs the question from us who breathe.
474,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
475,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Surely you've trodden straight
476,OBSEQUIAL ODE,To the very door.
477,OBSEQUIAL ODE,You have surely achieved your fate;
478,OBSEQUIAL ODE,And the perfect dead are elate
479,OBSEQUIAL ODE,To have won once more.
480,OBSEQUIAL ODE,
481,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Now to the dead you are giving
482,OBSEQUIAL ODE,Your last allegiance.
483,OBSEQUIAL ODE,But what of us who are living
484,OBSEQUIAL ODE,And fearful yet of believing
485,OBSEQUIAL ODE,In your pitiless legions.
486,OBSEQUIAL ODE,

488,SHADES,SHADES
489,SHADES,
490,SHADES,"SHALL I tell you, then, how it is?--"
491,SHADES,There came a cloven gleam
492,SHADES,Like a tongue of darkened flame
493,SHADES,To flicker in me.
494,SHADES,
495,SHADES,And so I seem
496,SHADES,To have you still the same
497,SHADES,In one world with me.
498,SHADES,
499,SHADES,"In the flicker of a flower,"
500,SHADES,"In a worm that is blind, yet strives,"
501,SHADES,In a mouse that pauses to listen
502,SHADES,
503,SHADES,Glimmers our
504,SHADES,Shadow; yet it deprives
