109,PREFACE.,
110,PREFACE.,"The verses which make up this volume have been written at intervals,"
111,PREFACE.,"and under the most varied and chequered circumstances, extending over a"
112,PREFACE.,"period of five-and-twenty years.  If, therefore, they bear upon their"
113,PREFACE.,"surface variety of sentiment and incongruity of feeling, that fact will"
114,PREFACE.,explain it.  I am fully aware that some of the pieces are unequal in
115,PREFACE.,"merit from a purely artistic point of view, but I have felt that my"
116,PREFACE.,"audience will be varied in its composition, and hence the introduction"
117,PREFACE.,"of variety.  The tone, however, of the whole work, I believe to be"
118,PREFACE.,"healthy; and where honest maxims, combined with homely metaphor, are"
119,PREFACE.,"found to take the place of high constructive art, they will, I know, be"
120,PREFACE.,"excused by votaries of the latter, for the sake of those whose hearts"
121,PREFACE.,and instincts are much more sensitive to homely appeals than to the
122,PREFACE.,"charms of mere artistic effect.  The pieces have all been written,"
123,PREFACE.,"together with many other effusions, at such leisure moments as have"
124,PREFACE.,"been accorded to one who, during the whole time of their composition,"
125,PREFACE.,"has had to apply himself, almost without cessation, to the performance"
126,PREFACE.,of newspaper press duties; and those who know anything about such
127,PREFACE.,"things need not be told that a taste for versification is, to a"
128,PREFACE.,"press-man, as a rule, what poverty is to most people--a very"
129,PREFACE.,"inconvenient and by no means a profitable companion.  In my own case,"
130,PREFACE.,"however, the inconvenience has been a pleasure, and I have no reason to"
131,PREFACE.,find fault as to profit.  From the fitful excitement of journalistic
132,PREFACE.,"duties I have turned to ""making poetry,"" as Spenser defines the art, as"
133,PREFACE.,"a jaded spirit looks for rest, and have always felt refreshed after it."
134,PREFACE.,"My only hope in connection with the poetry I have thus made is, that"
135,PREFACE.,those who may incline to read what I have written will take as much
136,PREFACE.,"pleasure in reading as I have taken in writing it, and that the result"
137,PREFACE.,"to myself will be a justification for having published the work, to be"
138,PREFACE.,"found only in that public appreciation which I hope to obtain,"

387,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",gold medal was given by the Committee.  The Vicar said the best
388,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.","composition was an English poem, signed 'David.'  It was written in a"
389,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.","style well adapted to the subject, in language dignified and sonorous,"
390,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",with not a little of the rhythmic cadence of Paradise Lost.  It was

404,HISTORICAL NOTE.,the leading historical incidents of Saul's career that lead up to and
405,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"explain his tragic death on Mount Gilboa.  With him, nearly 3,000 years"
406,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"ago, commenced the Monarchical government of the Israelites, who had"
407,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"previously been governed by a Theocracy.  The Prophet Samuel, who"
408,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"anointed Saul, was the last of the High Priests or Judges under this"
409,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"Theocracy, which existed for 800 years, and died out with the"
410,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"acceptance of Saul, by the Israelites, as ""King of all the tribes of"
411,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"Israel.""  The incidents touched upon range from the proclamation of"
412,HISTORICAL NOTE.,"Saul as King, by Samuel (1095 B.C.), to the fall of the hapless Monarch"

721,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,That rolls from world to world.  And through the blast
722,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Of warfare came a weak and wailing voice
723,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Moaning in utter anguish--""Let me die!"""
724,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,'Twas Saul the Anointed--Israel's fallen King:
725,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Crushed 'neath the hand of an offended God!
726,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""Lo!"" cried the King, and raised his tearful eyes,"
727,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""The Philistines are near, pierce thou my breast!"""
728,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"And, turning round, his kingly breast he bared,"
729,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Bidding his armour-bearer thrust his sword
730,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Hilt-deep into his heart.  ""Better to die"
731,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""By friendly hand,"" he cried, ""than owe my death"

733,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""Thrust deep and quickly!""  But the faltering hand"
734,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"That held the sword fell nerveless.  ""Mighty King!"
735,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""I dare not!"" spake the trembling armourer."
736,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""Then by my own I die,"" exclaimed the King."
737,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,And as he spake he poised the glittering blade
738,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Point upward from the earth, and moaning fell"
739,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Upon the thirsty steel.  The ruddy gush
740,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Came spurting through the armour that he wore,"
741,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,And steamed in misty vapour to the sky
742,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,In voiceless testimony to the truth
743,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Of words once spoken by the living God!
744,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Aghast the faithful armour-bearer stood.
745,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""O, mighty King!  I die with thee!"" he said,"
746,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"And, falling on his sword, the blood of both"
747,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Commingled, as from ghastly wounds it ran"
748,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,In trickling streamlets down Mount Gilboa's side. (_i_)
749,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,As ebbs and flows the sea with troubled throb

754,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,The earth and unseen worlds that lie beyond.
755,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"So hung the life of Saul, whose bitter cup,"
756,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Still at his lips, contained its bitterest dregs."
757,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Prostrate he lay, by bloody sword transfixed;"
758,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"A corpse his pillow; arms extended out,"
759,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"And body bent in agony of pain,"
760,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,The flame of life still fluttering at his heart
761,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,A waning lamp.  He heard the tumult swell.
762,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Bondage was worse than death.  ""They come!  They come!"""
763,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"He moaned.  ""Stand ye upon my breast,"" he said,"

765,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""And force the gurgling stream back on my heart,"
766,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"""To quench the life within me.  Quick!  They come!"""
767,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,The stranger did the cruel bidding. (_j_) Hark!

770,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Had lain by them unseen.  But while the shout
771,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,Swept like a storm along the swelling ranks
772,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"The soul of Saul went drifting through the dark,"
773,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Like some fair ship with sails and cordage rent,"
774,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Out from the stormy trials of his life,"
775,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,To tempt the terrors of an unknown sea.
776,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,And then the cry of lamentation rose
777,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"In Israel, and the Hebrew maidens hung"
778,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Their speechless harps upon the willow branch,"
779,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,And mourned the loved and lost unceasingly.

781,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,
782,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,
783,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,(_a_) Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
784,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"they said, Nay, but we will have a King over us, that we also may be"
785,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"like all the nations. And Samuel said to all the people, ""See ye him"

788,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,
789,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"(_b_) And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons"

792,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"viii., 1, 2."
793,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,
794,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"(_c_) And Saul said, ""Bring hither a burnt offering,"" and he offered"

803,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"Samuel, ""The people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, to sacrifice"
804,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"unto the Lord thy God at Gilgal.""  And Samuel said, ""Behold, to obey is"
805,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For"
806,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity"
807,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"and idolatry.  Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath"

838,BATTLE OF GILBOA AND THE DEATH OF SAUL.,"(_i_) And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him,"

988,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",
989,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",Near yonder grave there stands a widowed life:
990,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",Husband and son beneath the grave-stone rest:
991,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.","Some laurels tell, by tender lip caressed,"
992,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",The changeless love of mother and of wife.

1001,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.","And as she knelt, the morning breezes swept"
1002,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",A cloud of hair about her drooping head.
1003,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.",
1004,"WREXHAM NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, 1876.","Her feet were small and slender, bare and white--"

1822,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,There is a little history attached to the following lines.  Twenty
1823,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"years ago, my friend, Mr. Arthur J. Morris, at that time an accountant"
1824,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"at the Llwydcoed Ironworks, Aberdare, and subsequently manager at the"
1825,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"Plymouth Ironworks, Merthyr Tydfil, but now deceased, asked me to write"
1826,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"a song in praise of Wales.  I did so, and wrote and sent him the words"
1827,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"of ""Beautiful Wales,"" a Welsh translation of which was made and"
1828,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"forwarded to me by Mr. Daniel Morgan (Daniel ap Gwilym), of Aberaman,"
1829,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,Aberdare.  A short time afterwards I received a request from Mr. R.
1830,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"Andrews, of Manchester (whom I never saw and do not know) for"
1831,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"permission to set the words to music, which permission I gave, and the"
1832,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"song (English version) was published by Robert Cocks and Co., London."
1833,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"It has long since been out of print.  I found, on receiving some copies"
1834,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"of the music, that the tune was merely an adaptation of a well-known"
1835,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"dance tune, and some years ago I wrote to Mr. Brinley Richards on the"
1836,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"subject, who regretted that the words had not been wedded to more"
1837,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"suitable music.  The matter, however, was lost sight of by myself, and"
1838,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,I was under the impression that the song had been forgotten.  To my
1839,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,surprise it suddenly cropped up as a great favourite of the Sunday
1840,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"schools, and I have myself heard it sung at school anniversaries to"
1841,BEAUTIFUL WALES.,"various tunes.  It would seem, therefore, that after playing the"

2534,THE BELFRY OLD.,"Kept silent ward o'er each grassy mound,"
2535,THE BELFRY OLD.,"With a cloak of ivy about it grown,"
2536,THE BELFRY OLD.,"Fringed round, like fur, with a snowy fray;"
2537,THE BELFRY OLD.,On a New Year's Eve I watched alone
2538,THE BELFRY OLD.,The life of the last year ebbing away.
2539,THE BELFRY OLD.,
2540,THE BELFRY OLD.,Anon there came from the belfry out
2541,THE BELFRY OLD.,A strange wild sound as of pleasure and pain;
2542,THE BELFRY OLD.,For the birth of the new a jubilant shout:
2543,THE BELFRY OLD.,For the death of the old a sad refrain.

2597,THE BELFRY OLD.,The emblazoned escutcheon the bloody hand:
2598,THE BELFRY OLD.,"How women and men to the altar hie,"
2599,THE BELFRY OLD.,And swear to the promise they rarely keep;
2600,THE BELFRY OLD.,"How Vice, a shameless and living lie,"
2601,THE BELFRY OLD.,Gets honours which Virtue never can reap.

3522,A FABLE.,"Men chance to gaze, they taller seem"

3526,A FABLE.,A boy who in my face should scan
3527,A FABLE.,"Will grow as tall as any man!"""

3532,A FABLE.,To praise mankind is what I hate:
3533,A FABLE.,"What says our neighbour, Master Plate?"""
3534,A FABLE.,The plate-glass then essayed to speak;

3546,A FABLE.,"You, Concave, lessen what you see,"
3547,A FABLE.,Though well you know 't should larger be.
3548,A FABLE.,"While Convex, aye to flattery prove,"
3549,A FABLE.,Makes mounts of what are mites alone.
3550,A FABLE.,"Plain-spoken Plate, in wrong the least,"
3551,A FABLE.,"Would tell a beast it _was_ a beast,"

4251,II.,Frantic then the mother hugged it;
4252,II.,Gazed a moment; then with laughter

4257,II.,And she turned her large blue eyes up
4258,II.,"With a strange and fitful gazing,"
4259,II.,Laughing till the tears chased madly
4260,II.,Down her cheeks of pallid whiteness.
4261,II.,"""Dear, dear Blanche!"" her husband murmured,"
4262,II.,Stretching out his hand towards her;

4267,II.,With a voice so low and plaintive
4268,II.,"'Twould have won a brute to lameness,"

4276,II.,Then he walkt a step towards her;
4277,II.,But the girl with 'wildered features
4278,II.,"Drew her thin hand o'er her forehead,"
4279,II.,And in wandering accents muttered:
4280,II.,"""Husband?  Husband?  No, not husband!"
4281,II.,I am still a laughing maiden;
4282,II.,"Yet methought I had been married,"
4283,II.,"And bore such a sweet, sweet baby--"
4284,II.,Such a fair and bonny baby!
4285,II.,Baby--baby--hush; the wild winds

4301,III.,

4306,III.,With the din of life around it--
4307,III.,Din of rushing life about it;
4308,III.,"Sat a girlish, grief-worn figure,"
4309,III.,"Croucht up in the darkest corner,"
4310,III.,With her pallid face turned upwards;
4311,III.,To and fro in silence rocking
4312,III.,On a little mound of dark dirt.
4313,III.,"Like a veiled Nun rose the pale moon,"
4314,III.,Draped about with fleecy vapour;
4315,III.,And the stars in solemn conclave
4316,III.,"Came to meet her--came to greet her,"
4317,III.,To their convent home to bear her:
4318,III.,She had soared above the dingy
4319,III.,"Earth, and left the world behind her."
4320,III.,"As she passed she lookt down sadly,"
4321,III.,"Gazed with silent, noble pity,"

4327,III.,Round about from windows flickered
4328,III.,"Lights, which told of inside revels;"

4330,III.,"Sobbing kisses, soft embraces,"
4331,III.,"Feasts of Love, and feasts of Pleasure,"
4332,III.,"Ruby lips, and joyous laughter."
4333,III.,"Then the buzz of life grew softer,"
4334,III.,Broken only by the tramping
4335,III.,"Of a troop of bacchanalians,"
4336,III.,"Reeling through the streets deserted,"
4337,III.,With their loud uproarious language.

4346,III.,Straight the drowsy buildings leapt up
4347,III.,"Like huge giants from their slumber,"
4348,III.,"And, with faces flusht and ruddy,"
4349,III.,Waited for the King of Morning!
4350,III.,"Lo! he comes from far-off mountains,"
4351,III.,"With a glory-robe about him,"
4352,III.,With a robe of gold and purple;
4353,III.,And a buzz of mighty wonder
4354,III.,"Rises as, with step majestic,"
4355,III.,"And with glance sublime, he walks on,"
4356,III.,"Gathering his robe about him,"
4357,III.,"To his West-embowered palace,"
4358,III.,"Still the girlish, grief-worn figure,"
4359,III.,Croucht in dark and dreary corner
4360,III.,"Of that small corpse-crowded graveyard,"
4361,III.,"With her pallid face turned upwards,"
4362,III.,"To and fro in silence rocking,"
4363,III.,On a little mound of black dirt!
4364,III.,When the box which held her treasure
4365,III.,"Had been borne from home and buried,"
4366,III.,"She had followed, undetected;"
4367,III.,And when all had left the graveyard
4368,III.,"She had crept to that small hillock,"
4369,III.,Trembling like a half-crusht lily;
4370,III.,"Yearning towards the child beneath her,"
4371,III.,"Yet, the while, to earth-life clinging"

4389,IV.,"Gliding, like a sunbeam, o'er it--"
4390,IV.,To that small corpse-crowded graveyard;
4391,IV.,"Where for hours she'd sit and murmur,"

4399,IV.,Her fair bonny-featured baby!
4400,IV.,"And her husband would bend o'er her,"
4401,IV.,With low words of pure affection--
4402,IV.,As when first he woo'd and won her.
4403,IV.,And her home was not the dungeon--
4404,IV.,"The sad, dark, and dismal dungeon--"
4405,IV.,"The cold death-vault of her infant,"
4406,IV.,With the drear and ghastly rushlight:
4407,IV.,"But a home of cottage comfort,"

4421,V.,'Twas the voice of Charles that pleaded:
4422,V.,"Softly, then, he drew the curtain,"
4423,V.,"Gently, fearful, drew the curtain--"
4424,V.,"""Charles!--dear Charles!"" a faint voice murmured,"
4425,V.,"In a tone so weak and lowly,"
4426,V.,Sweetly weak and soul-subduing.
4427,V.,"""Blanche!--my sweet one!"" gasp'd the husband,"

4429,V.,"Then he threw his arms around her,"

4432,V.,Drew the loved one to his bosom:
4433,V.,And the babe that nestled near her
4434,V.,Covered he with warm caresses.
4435,V.,"Reason, like a golden sunbeam"
4436,V.,"On a lily-cup, had lightened"
4437,V.,Her sweet soul so dark and turbid--
4438,V.,For three years so darkly turbid;
4439,V.,Three long years so dark and turbid.
4440,V.,"""Charles, my dream has been a sad one,"""

4442,V.,Shadowed with a mournful sadness.
4443,V.,"""I have dreamt they stole my baby,"

4445,V.,"Then she took the babe and kiss'd it,"

4462,VI.,As a new-made grave in Summer
4463,VI.,"Bulges up dark and unsightly,"
4464,VI.,"With the bright blue sky above it,"
4465,VI.,"And the daisies smiling round it,"
4466,VI.,"So, with all its doleful darkness,"
4467,VI.,Fell the dream of that fair suff'rer
4468,VI.,"O'er her mind with inward canker,"
