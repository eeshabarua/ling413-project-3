66,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,(1798-1855)
67,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
68,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,The last of the eighteenth century was an important period for Russia
69,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"and Poland, not only politically, but in letters and art. It marked the"
70,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"birth of statesmen, patriots, poets and writers. It was into a Poland of"
71,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,great names and greater activities that Adam Mickiewicz was born in
72,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"1798, as son of an impoverished family of the old nobility. Three years"
73,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"before, the third and last partition of his native land had taken place,"
74,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,and the signed documents had been hastened to Petersburg to make more
75,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,triumphant the birthday of the Great Catherine.
76,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
77,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Just a few years before this (1792), Kosciusko had courageously led his"
78,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,forty-five thousand valiant Poles in their brave defiance of an
79,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,overwhelming number of Cossacks and Russians. History had recorded the
80,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"bloody Turkish wars, the Pugatshev rebellion, the uprising of the"
81,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Zaporogian Cossacks and the Polish confederations. And with the
82,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,nineteenth century came the Napoleonic wars with the dramatic entry of
83,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Napoleon into Russia, and a new and different mental life began to dawn"
84,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,over Europe.
85,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
86,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Mickiewicz was born in Novogrodek in Lithuania. This was the birthplace
87,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"of Count Henry Rzewuski, who wrote the delightful memories of the Polish"
88,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"eighteenth century, under the title of ""The Memories of Pan Severin"
89,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Soplica,""[*] and who declared he considered it an honor to be born a"
90,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"""schlazig"" (noble) of Lithuania, and of Novogrodek. He went to a"
91,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"government school in Minsk, and later attended the University of Vilna,"
92,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"which city in his day was a place of Jesuit faith, gloomy convents and"
93,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,echoing bells. All about him epoch-making events for Slav lands were
94,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"taking place. It was a resounding, inspired age for his race, and he"
95,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"grew up to take a fitting place in that age and to be called ""the"
96,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"immortal hero of Polish poetry."" Poland just then was the battle-ground"
97,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"not only for the armies of Europe, but for the diplomats. It was a place"
98,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"for statesmen to win their spurs. If accredited to Petersburg or Warsaw,"
99,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"and successful, they were believed to be equal to any diplomatic"
100,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"emergency. Eloquence, inspiration, and patriotic fervor must have"
101,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,cradled his childhood.
102,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
103,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,[Footnote *: The full title of the book is: Memories of Pan Severin
104,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Soplica, Cupbearer of Parnau, by Count Henry Rzewuski.]"
105,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
106,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"At the time of the birth of Mickiewicz, Russia was bringing to a close a"
107,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,prodigious period of development in almost every field of human
108,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,activity. It was really the birth-throe of a nation that was to move
109,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"powerfully, and to dominate--partially--the new age. And the splendid"
110,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,and never again to be equalled pageant of the life of Catherine the
111,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Great, with its wild dreams of world dominance and of the glorious"
112,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"revival of perished Greece, had just been unrolled for the amazement of"
113,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Europe. What dramatic and enchanting memories the names of her followers
114,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"call up: the Orlows, Potemkin, Panin, Poniatowski, Bestushew-Rjumin,"
115,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Princess Daschkov, Razumowski."
116,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
117,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"In France, too, the same preceding period had been brilliant. It had"
118,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"been the France of Voltaire, the Encyclopedists, and a most resplendent"
119,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,and luxurious monarch. England had known her greatest orators and prime
120,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,ministers. It had been the Prussia of Frederick the Great; the Dresden
121,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,of August the Strong; the Austria of Joseph the Second.
122,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
123,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,A little later--during Mickiewicz's own youth--Goethe was at the height
124,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,of his power and the intellectual dictator of Europe. Under his
125,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,direction and encouragement the treasures of oriental literature were
126,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,being translated and made known to the West. This is merely a hasty
127,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"glimpse of the ""mise-en-scene"" that preceded the debut in life of the"
128,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,most renowned of Polish poets. The old traditions of absolute and
129,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"God-created monarchs and princely times were coming to an end, and that"
130,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"democratic modern world, where everything was to change, was close at"
131,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"hand, just over the crest, indeed, of this new century into which Fate"
132,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,was ushering him. He was to see the last of blind power and royal
133,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"prerogative, and the first dawn of a modern spirit which in time would"
134,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"sweep away forever, the old. It was an uncertain, difficult transition"
135,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"period, without standards and without measurements."
136,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
137,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"As we take a fleeting, bird's-eye view of the stirring times in which"
138,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"his days were spent, his travels, his army life, his periods of"
139,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"professorship, we can not help but wonder at the amount of writing"
140,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Mickiewicz did. And his life was not a long one; it did not reach to
141,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"sixty years. But during the working years allotted him, before a"
142,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,mystical melancholy--which was threatening to degenerate into
143,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"madness--had impaired his faculties, his mind was unusually brilliant,"
144,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,creative and marvelously disciplined. It obeyed at will. At one time he
145,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,was professor of Latin in Lausanne; at another time he held the chair of
146,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Slavic languages in Paris. He taught Polish and Latin in Kovno. He
147,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,traveled extensively in Italy in the interest of the Polish revolution.
148,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,His mind was many-sided and capable of various activities. He devoted
149,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,considerable time to advanced mathematics and philosophy. He made
150,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,scientific investigations in Vilna under Lalewel. At one time and
151,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,another he lived in various large cities of Europe. In Germany he met
152,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,and became friendly with Goethe. In Switzerland he met Krasinski. In
153,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,1833 he married Celina Szymanovska. Her mother was the famous Slav
154,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,beauty and musician who had so delighted Goethe in her youth.
155,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
156,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Among writers of Russia and Poland whose life period somewhat coincided
157,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"with that of Mickiewicz's are: Korzenowski (born in 1797), the novelist"
158,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,(a brother of Adam Mickiewicz was fellow-teacher with Korzenowski at
159,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Charkov); Danilewski (1829), likewise a novelist--it was he who"
160,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"translated The Crimean Sonnets into Russian; Malzweski, Polish patriot"
161,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"and poet, whose ""Maria""--perhaps the most popular poetic story in"
162,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Poland--appeared at almost the same time as The Crimean Sonnets; Zaleski
163,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"(1802), Slowacki (1809), Krasinski (1812), the three greatest poets of"
164,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Poland excepting only Mickiewicz himself, the Polish critic, Brodzinski."
165,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
166,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"In Russia, the golden age of literature almost covered the same period"
167,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"as Mickiewicz's own life--Puschkin, Lermontov, Schukowski, Gogol, to"
168,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,mention only some of the most important names.
169,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
170,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"In the eighteen-thirties we find Mickiewicz in Paris, which happened to"
171,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,be filled just then with a crowd of brilliant Slavic exiles. Here he
172,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"became the friend of Chopin, and one of Chopin's most talented pupils--a"
173,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,young Polish girl--made the first translation of the Sonnets into
174,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,French. It was a wonderful and brilliant Paris which Mickiewicz entered.
175,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"This was the time when the city was first called ""the stepmother of"
176,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Genius."" Heine was here in exile, and Boerne. It knew the personal"
177,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,fascination and the denunciative writings of Ferdinand la Salle. It was
178,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"the day, too, of Eugene Sue, Berlioz, George Sand, de Musset, Dumas,"
179,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Gautier, the Goncourt Brothers, Gavarni, Sainte Beuve, Liszt, Felix"
180,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Mendelssohn, Ary Scheffer, Delacroiz, Horace Vernet--to mention only a"
181,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"few great names at random. Julius Slowacki, Count Krasinski and Adam"
182,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Mickiewicz were all here editing their poetry in the midst of this
183,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,brilliant life in the inspiring city by the Seine. This period in Paris
184,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,signs perhaps the high-water mark of the creative genius of Mickiewicz.
185,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"He had already written the Ballads and Romances, the third part of"
186,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Dziady, Pan Tadeuz."
187,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
188,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"The Crimean Sequence belongs to the period of Mickiewicz's youth, the"
189,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Vilna period. He joined a society at this time which was looked upon
190,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"with disfavor by the Government. At length, because of his continued"
191,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"participation in it, he was exiled to southern Russia. On that trip,"
192,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"while he was going toward Odessa, he began the Crimean Sonnets. Their"
193,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,success was quick and astonishing. They were translated into every
194,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,language of Europe. Although the form is the traditional and classic
195,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"sonnet form, he makes use of it in a slightly different manner, not"
196,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"altogether as an exposition of the sentiments of the soul, and the"
197,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"convictions and emotions of the mind, but as an instrument with which to"
198,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,sketch what he saw upon this eventful journey. He used the sonnet form
199,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"at that period just as Verhaeren used it in ""Les Flamandes,"" to show us"
200,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Flanders, and as Albert Samain in ""Le Chariot d'Or,"" to picture the"
201,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,gardens of Versailles. This is worthy of note. And this we must remember
202,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,was before 1826. In the poetical works of Mickiewicz there was always
203,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,traceable an inclination to break tradition and to search for new and
204,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,untried possibilities.
205,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
206,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"On this exile in Russia he learned to know Puschkin, then a young man"
207,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,like himself. Puschkin has written a verse letter to him which we
208,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"transcribe in free prose. ""He lived among us for a while--a people"
209,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,strange to him. And yet his mind cherished no hatred and no longing for
210,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"revenge. Generous, kind of heart, noble-minded, he joined our evening"
211,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"circles, and we loved him. We exchanged our dreams, our plans--our"
212,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,poems. God gave him genius and inspiration. He stood always on the
213,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,heights and looked down on life. We talked of history and of nations. He
214,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,declared a time would come when races would forget all evil things--like
215,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"war, rebellion--and dwell together peaceably in one great family. We"
216,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,listened to him eagerly for he had the gift of speech. After a while he
217,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,went away and we gave our blessing to him. Then we learned our
218,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,guest--spurred on by his revengeful race--had become our enemy. To
219,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,please that bitter race of his he filled his songs with hatred. Of our
220,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,beloved friend there came to us only revenge and angry thoughts. God
221,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"grant that peace may come again to his embittered heart!"""
222,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
223,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Puschkin himself wrote eloquently of these same Crimean scenes that
224,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Mickiewicz shows us. He, too, was inspired by the old capital city of"
225,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"the Tartar rulers. We recall his ""Fountain of Baktschi Serai."" And he,"
226,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"too, brings before our eyes again that gigantic mountain world of"
227,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"southern Russia in ""The Prisoner of the Caucasus."""
228,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,
229,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,The fame of The Crimean Sonnets was so great that Mickiewicz was offered
230,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,a government position which attached him to the person of the powerful
231,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Prince Galitzin, in Moscow. It was in Rome, and singularly enough it was"
232,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"when he wrote the ""Ode to Youth"" that he began to devote himself to"
233,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,mystical studies which had such an injurious effect upon his mind. For
234,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"some time after he had lost his fluent power as a poet, he retained his"
235,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,conversational gifts which were remarkable and brought him almost as
236,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,much fame as his poetry. His life ended in a period as dramatic as that
237,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,in which it began. He entered the Turkish wars in 1855 and died in
238,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,Stamboul in that same year. It is somewhat peculiar and at the same time
239,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,no little to his credit that he should have chosen the sonnet as the
240,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"instrument of his quick sketching of Crimea on the trip of exile,"
241,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,because the sonnet has never been a frequently chosen means of
242,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"expression of the Slav races, despite the numerous sonnets written later"
243,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"by Vrchlicky, Preseren and others. The sonnet has belonged more to the"
244,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,"Latin races, and to the English race. The Crimean Sonnets, however, rank"
245,ADAM MICKIEWICZ,among the famous sequences.
