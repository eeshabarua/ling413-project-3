29,LADY CLARE,"It was the time when lilies blow, And clouds are highest up in air. Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe To give his cousin, Lady Clare. "
30,LADY CLARE,I trow they did not part in scorn: Lovers long betrothed were they; They two will wed the morrow morn; God's blessing on the day! 
31,LADY CLARE,"""He does not love me for my birth Nor for my lands so broad and fair; He loves me for my own true worth, And that is well,"" said Lady Clare. "
32,LADY CLARE,"In there came old Alice the nurse, Said, ""Who was this that went from thee?"" ""It was my cousin,"" said Lady Clare; ""To-morrow he weds with me."" "
33,LADY CLARE,"""Oh, God be thanked!"" said Alice the nurse, ""That all comes round so just and fair: Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands, And you are not the Lady Clare."" "
34,LADY CLARE,"""Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,"" Said Lady Clare, ""that ye speak so wild?"" ""As God's above,"" said Alice the nurse, ""I speak the truth: you are my child. "
35,LADY CLARE,"The old earl's daughter died at my breast; I speak the truth, as I live by bread! I buried her like my own sweet child, And put my child in her stead."" "
36,LADY CLARE,"""Falsely, falsely have ye done, O mother,"" she said, ""if this be true, To keep the best man under the sun So many years from his due."" "
37,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, my child,"" said Alice the nurse, ""But keep the secret for your life, And all you have will be Lord Ronald's, When you are man and wife."" "
38,LADY CLARE,"""If I'm a beggar born,"" she said ""I will speak out, for I dare not lie, Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold, And fling the diamond necklace by."" "
39,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, my child,"" said Alice the nurse, ""But keep the secret all you can."" She said, ""Not so; but I will know If there be any faith in man."" "
40,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, what faith?"" said Alice the nurse, ""The man will cleave unto his right."" ""And he shall have it,"" the lady replied, ""Though I should die to-night."" "
41,LADY CLARE,"""Yet give one kiss to your mother, dear! Alas, my child! I sinned for thee."" ""O mother, mother, mother,"" she said, ""So strange it seems to me! "
42,LADY CLARE,"""Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear, My mother dear, if this be so, And lay your hand upon my head, And bless me, mother, ere I go."" "
43,LADY CLARE,"She clad herself in a russen gown, She was no longer Lady Clare: She went by dale, and she went by down, With a single rose in her hair. "
44,LADY CLARE,The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought Leapt up from where she lay. Dropped her head in the maiden's hand. And followed her all the way. 
45,LADY CLARE,"Down stepped Lord Ronald from his tower: ""O Lady Clare, you shame your worth! Why come you dressed like a village maid, That are the flower of the earth?"" "
46,LADY CLARE,"""If I come dressed like a village maid, I am but as my fortunes are: I am a beggar born,"" she said, ""And not the Lady Clare."" "
47,LADY CLARE,"""Play me no tricks,"" said Lord Ronald, ""For I am yours in word and in deed; Play me no tricks,"" said Lord Ronald, ""Your riddle is hard to read."" "
48,LADY CLARE,"Oh, and proudly stood she up! Her heart within her did not fail: She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes, And told him all her nurse's tale. "
49,LADY CLARE,"He laughed a laugh of merry scorn: He turned and kissed her where she stood; ""If you are not the heiress born, And I,"" said he, ""the next in blood-- "
50,LADY CLARE,"""If you are not the heiress born, And I,"" said he, ""the lawful heir, We two will wed to-morrow morn, And you shall still be Lady Clare."" "
