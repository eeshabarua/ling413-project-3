108,I,"He had a high nose. He looked at one over the collar, so to speak."
109,I,"His regard was very assured, and his speech was that short bundle of"
110,I,monosyllables which the subaltern throws at the orderly. He had never
111,I,"been questioned, and, the precedent being absent, he had never"
112,I,"questioned himself. Why should he? We live by question and answer,"
113,I,but we do not know the reply to anything until a puzzled comrade
114,I,bothers us and initiates that divine curiosity which both humbles and
115,I,uplifts us.
116,I,
117,I,He wanted all things for himself. What he owned he wished to own
118,I,"completely. He would give anything away with the largest generosity,"
119,I,but he would share with no one--
120,I,
121,I,"""Whatever is mine,"" said he, ""must be entirely mine. If it is alive I"
122,I,"claim its duty to the last respiration of its breath, and if it is dead"
123,I,I cannot permit a mortgage on it. Have you a claim on anything
124,I,"belonging to me? then you may have it entirely, I must have all of it"
125,I,"or none."""
126,I,
127,I,"He was a stockbroker, and, by the methods peculiar to that mysterious"
128,I,"profession, he had captured a sufficiency of money to enable him to"
129,I,regard the future with calmness and his fellow-creatures with
130,I,condescension--perhaps the happiest state to which a certain humanity
131,I,can attain.
132,I,
133,I,So far matters were in order. There remained nothing to round his life
134,I,"into the complete, harmonious circle except a wife; but as a stated"
135,I,"income has the choice of a large supply, he shortly discovered a lady"
136,I,"whose qualifications were such as would ornament any, however exalted,"
137,I,position--She was sound in wind and limb. She spoke grammar with the
138,I,"utmost precision, and she could play the piano with such skill that it"
139,I,was difficult to explain why she played it badly.
140,I,
141,I,"This also was satisfactory, and if the world had been made of machinery"
142,I,he would have had the fee-simple of happiness. But to both happiness
143,I,"and misery there follows the inevitable second act, and beyond that,"
144,I,"and to infinity, action and interaction, involution and evolution,"
145,I,forging change for ever. Thus he failed to take into consideration
146,I,"that the lady was alive, that she had a head on her shoulders which was"
147,I,"native to her body, and that she could not be aggregated as chattel"
148,I,property for any longer period than she agreed to.
149,I,
150,I,After their marriage he discovered that she had dislikes which did not
151,I,"always coincide with his, and appreciations which set his teeth on"
152,I,edge. A wife in the house is a critic on the hearth--this truth was
153,I,"daily and unpleasantly impressed upon him: but, of course, every man"
154,I,"knows that every woman is a fool, and a tolerant smile is the only"
155,I,recognition we allow to their whims. God made them as they are--we
156,I,"grin, and bear it."
157,I,
158,I,His wife found that the gospel of her husband was this--Love me to the
159,I,exclusion of all human creatures. Believe in me even when I am in the
160,I,wrong. Women should be seen and not heard. When you want excitement
161,I,make a fuss of your husband.--But while he entirely forgot that his
162,I,"wife had been bought and paid for, she did not forget it: indeed, she"
163,I,could not help remembering it. A wrong had been done her not to be
164,I,"obscured even by economics, the great obscurer. She had been won and"
165,I,not wooed. (The very beasts have their privileges!) She had been
166,I,"defrauded of how many teasing and provoking prerogatives, aloofnesses,"
167,I,"and surrenders, and her body, if not her mind, resented and remembered"
168,I,it.
169,I,
170,I,There are times when calmness is not recognised as a virtue. Of
171,I,"course, he had wooed her in a way. He took her to the opera, he gave"
172,I,"her jewels, he went to Church with her twice every Sunday, and once a"
173,I,month he knelt beside her in more profound reverences: sometimes he
174,I,"petted her, always he was polite--"
175,I,
176,I,But he had not told her that her eyes were the most wonderful and
177,I,inspiring orbs into which a tired man could look. He never said that
178,I,there would not be much to choose between good and evil if he lost her.
179,I,He never said that one touch of her lips would electrify a paralytic
180,I,into an acrobat. He never swore that he would commit suicide and dive
181,I,to deep perdition if she threw him over--none of these things. It is
182,I,"possible that she did not wish him to say or do such extravagances, but"
183,I,"he had not played the game, and, knowing that something was badly"
184,I,"wrong, she nursed a grievance, that horrid fosterling."
185,I,
186,I,"He was fiercely jealous, not of his love, but of his property, and"
187,I,"while he was delighted to observe that other men approved of his taste,"
188,I,he could not bear that his wife should admire these outsiders. This
189,I,"was his attitude to her: Give me your admirations, all of them, every"
190,I,"note of exclamation of which you are mistress, every jot and tittle of"
191,I,"your thoughts must be mine, for, lacking these, I have nothing. I am"
192,I,good to you. I have interposed between you and the buffets of
193,I,existence. I temper all winds to the bloom of your cheek. Do you your
194,I,"part, and so we will be happy."
195,I,
196,I,"There was a clerk in his office, a black-haired, slim, frowning young"
197,I,"man, who could talk like a cascade for ten minutes and be silent for a"
198,I,"month: he was a very angry young man, with many hatreds and many"
199,I,"ambitions. His employer prized him as a reliable and capable worker,"
200,I,"liked his manners, and paid him thirty-five shillings per week--Outside"
201,I,of these matters the young man abode no more in his remembrance than
202,I,did the flower on the heath or the bird on the tree.
203,I,
204,I,It happened one day that the employer fell sick of influenza and was
205,I,"confined to his bed. This clerk, by order, waited on him to see to his"
206,I,"correspondence; for, no matter who sneezes, work must be attended to."
207,I,
208,I,"The young man stayed in the house for a week, and during his sojourn"
209,I,"there he met the lady. She fair, young, brooding! he also young,"
210,I,"silent, and angry! After the first look had passed between them, there"
211,I,was little more to be said. They came together as though they had been
212,I,"magnetised. Love or passion, by whatever name it is called, was born"
213,I,abruptly. There is a force in human relations drawing too imperatively
214,I,"for denial; defying self-interest, and dragging at all anchors of duty"
215,I,and religion. Is it in man only the satisfaction of self? Egotism
216,I,"standing like a mountain, and demanding, ""Give me yourself or I will"
217,I,"kill myself."" And women! is their love the degradation of self, the"
218,I,surrender and very abasement of lowliness? or is it also egotism set on
219,I,"a pinnacle, so careless and self-assured as to be fearful of nothing?"
220,I,"In their eyes the third person, a shadow already, counted as less than"
221,I,"a shadow. He was a name with no significance, a something without a"
222,I,locality. His certain and particular income per annum was a thing to
223,I,"laugh at . . . there was a hot, a swift voice speaking--""I love you,"""
224,I,"it said, ""I love you"": he would batter his way into heaven, he would"
225,I,"tear delight from wherever delight might be--or else, and this was"
226,I,"harder, a trembling man pleading, ""Aid me or I perish,"" and it is"
227,I,"woman's instinct not to let a man perish. ""If I help you, I hurt"
228,I,"myself,"" she sighed; and, ""Hurt yourself, then,"" sighed the man; ""would"
229,I,"you have me perish. . .?"""
230,I,
231,I,So the owner by purchase smiled--
232,I,
233,I,"""You are mine,"" said he, ""altogether mine, no one else has a lien upon"
234,I,you. When the weather is fine I will take you for drives in the
235,I,"sunshine. In the nights we will go to the opera, hearkening together"
236,I,"to the tenor telling his sweet romanza, and when the wintry rain beats"
237,I,"on the windows you will play the piano for me, and so we will be happy."""
238,I,
239,I,"When he was quite recovered he went back to his office, and found that"
240,I,one of his clerks had not arrived--this angered him; when he returned
241,I,"home again in the evening, he found that his wife was not there. So"
242,I,things go.
243,I,
244,I,
245,II,II
246,II,
247,II,"He was one of those who shy at the _tête-à-tête_ life which, for a long"
248,II,"time, matrimony demands. As his wedding-day approached he grew fearful"
249,II,of the prolonged conversation which would stretch from the day of
250,II,"marriage, down the interminable vistas, to his death, and, more and"
251,II,"more, he became doubtful of his ability to cope with, or his endurance"
252,II,"to withstand, the extraordinary debate called marriage."
253,II,
254,II,He was naturally a silent man. He did not dislike conversation if it
255,II,"was kept within decent limits: indeed, he responded to it contentedly"
256,II,"enough, but when he had spoken or been addressed for more than an hour"
257,II,"he became, first, impatient, then bored, and, finally, sulky or"
258,II,"ill-mannered.--""With men,"" said he, ""one can talk or be silent as one"
259,II,"wishes, for between them there is a community of understanding which"
260,II,turns the occasional silence into a pregnant and fruitful interlude
261,II,wherein a thought may keep itself warm until it is wanted: but with a
262,II,"woman!""--he could not pursue that speculation further, for his"
263,II,acquaintance with the sex was limited.
264,II,
265,II,In every other respect his bride was a happiness. Her good looks
266,II,soothed and pleased him. The touch of her hand gave him an
267,II,extraordinary pleasure which concealed within it a yet more
268,II,"extraordinary excitement. Her voice, as a mere sound, enchanted him."
269,II,"It rippled and flowed, deepened and tinkled. It cooed and sang to him"
270,II,"at times like the soft ringdove calling to its mate, and, at times"
271,II,"again, it gurgled and piped like a thrush happy in the sunlight. The"
272,II,"infinite variation of her tone astonished and delighted him, and if it"
273,II,could have remained something as dexterous and impersonal as a wind he
274,II,"would have been content to listen to it for ever--but, could he give"
275,II,her pipe for pipe? Would the rich gurgle or the soft coo sound at last
276,II,"as a horrid iteration, a mere clamour to which he must not only give an"
277,II,"obedient heed, but must even answer from a head wherein silence had so"
278,II,peacefully brooded?
279,II,
280,II,"His mind was severe, his utterance staccato, and he had no knowledge of"
281,II,those conversational arts whereby nouns and verbs are amazingly
282,II,transfigured into a gracious frolic or an intellectual pleasure. To
283,II,"snatch the chatter from its holder, toss and keep it playing in the air"
284,II,until another snatched it from him; to pluck a theory hot from the
285,II,"stating, and expand it until it was as iridescent and, perhaps, as thin"
286,II,as a soap-bubble: to light up and vivify a weighty conversation until
287,II,the majestic thing sparkled and glanced like a jewel--these things he
288,II,"could not do, and he knew it. Many a time he had sat, amazed as at an"
289,II,"exhibition of acrobatics, while around him the chatter burst and sang"
290,II,"and shone. He had tried to bear his part, but had never been able to"
291,II,"edge more than one word into that tossing cataract, and so he fell to"
292,II,the habit of listening instead of speaking.
293,II,
294,II,"With some reservations, he enjoyed listening, but particularly he"
295,II,"enjoyed listening to his own thoughts as they trod slowly, but very"
296,II,"certainly, to foregone conclusions. Into the silent arena of his mind"
297,II,"no impertinent chatter could burst with a mouthful of puns or ridicule,"
298,II,or a reminiscence caught on the wing and hurled apropos to the very
299,II,centre of discussion. His own means of conveying or gathering
300,II,information was that whereby one person asked a question and another
301,II,"person answered it, and, if the subject proved deeper than the"
302,II,"assembled profundity, then one pulled out the proper volume of an"
303,II,"encyclopaedia, and the pearl was elicited as with a pin."
304,II,
305,II,"Meanwhile, his perturbation was real. There are people to whom we need"
306,II,not talk--let them pass: we overlook or smile distantly at the
307,II,"wretches, retaining our reputation abroad and our self-respect in its"
308,II,"sanctuary: but there are others with whom we may not be silent, and"
309,II,into this latter category a wife enters with assured emphasis. He
310,II,foresaw endless opportunities for that familiar discussion to which he
311,II,"was a stranger. There were breakfast-tables, dinner-tables,"
312,II,"tea-tables, and, between these, there might be introduced those"
313,II,preposterous other tables which women invent for no purpose unless it
314,II,"be that of making talk. His own breakfast, dinner, and tea-tables had"
315,II,"been solitary ones, whereat he lounged with a newspaper propped against"
316,II,"a lamp, or a book resting one end against the sugar-bowl and the other"
317,II,"against his plate.--This quietude would be ravaged from him for ever,"
318,II,"and that tumult nothing could exorcise or impede. Further than these,"
319,II,"he foresaw an interminable drawing-room, long walks together, and"
320,II,"other, even more confidential and particular, sequestrations."
321,II,
322,II,"After one has married a lady, what does one say to her? He could not"
323,II,"conceive any one saying anything beyond ""Good-morning."" Then the other"
324,II,"aspect arrested him, ""What does a woman find to say to a man?"" Perhaps"
325,II,"safety lay in this direction, for they were reputed notable and"
326,II,tireless speakers to whom replies are not pressingly necessary. He
327,II,"looked upon his sweetheart as from a distance, and tried to reconstruct"
328,II,her recent conversations.--He was amazed at the little he could
329,II,"remember. ""I, I, I, we, we, we, this shop, that shop, Aunt Elsa, and"
330,II,"chocolates."" She had mentioned all these things on the previous day,"
331,II,"but she did not seem to have said anything memorable about them, and,"
332,II,"so far as he could recollect, he had said nothing in reply but ""Oh,"
333,II,"yes"" and ""To be sure!"" Could he sustain a lifetime of small-talk on"
334,II,these meagre responses? He saw in vision his most miserable
335,II,tea-table--a timid husband and a mad wife glaring down their noses at
336,II,plates. The picture leaped at him as from a cinematograph and appalled
337,II,him. . . . After a time they would not even dare to look at each
338,II,"other. Hatred would crouch behind these figures, waiting for its chain"
339,II,to be loosed!
340,II,
341,II,"So he came to the knowledge that he, so soon to be a husband, had been"
342,II,specially fashioned by nature to be a bachelor. For him safety lay in
343,II,"solitude: others, less rigorously planned, might safely venture into"
344,II,"the haphazard, gregarious state of wedlock, but he not only could not,"
345,II,"but must not, do so, and he meditated an appeal to his bride to release"
346,II,him from the contract. Several times the meditation almost became
347,II,"audible, but always, just as he toppled on the surge of speech, the"
348,II,dear lady loosed a torrent of irrelevancies which swirled him from all
349,II,"anchorage, and left him at the last stranded so distantly from his"
350,II,thought that he did not know how to find his way back to it.
351,II,
352,II,It would be too brutally direct to shatter information about silk at
353,II,one shilling the yard with a prayer for matrimonial freedom. The girl
354,II,"would be shocked--he could see her--she would stare at him, and"
355,II,suddenly grow red in the face and stammer; and he would be forced to
356,II,"trail through a lengthy, precise explanation of this matter which was"
357,II,"not at all precise to himself. Furthermore, certain obscure emotions"
358,II,rendered him unwilling to be sundered from this girl.--There was the
359,II,"touch of her hand; more, the touch of her lips given bravely and with"
360,II,ready modesty--a contact not lightly to be relinquished. He did not
361,II,"believe he could ever weary of looking at her eyes: they were grey,"
362,II,"widely open, and of a kindness such as he could not disbelieve in; a"
363,II,"radiant cordiality, a soft, limpid goodwill; believing and trustful"
364,II,eyes which held no guile when they looked at him: there were her
365,II,"movements, her swiftness, spaciousness, her buoyant certainty: one"
366,II,"remembered her hair, her hands, the way she wore a frock, and a"
367,II,"strange, seductive something about the look of her shoe."
368,II,
369,II,The thing was not possible! It is the last and darkest insult to tell
370,II,the woman who loves you that you do not wish to marry her. Her
371,II,indignant curiosity may be appeased only by the excuse that you like
372,II,"some other woman better, and although she may hate the explanation she"
373,II,will understand it--but no less legitimate excuse than this may pass
374,II,sunderingly between a man and a woman.
375,II,
376,II,"It lay, therefore, that he must amend his own hand, and, accordingly,"
377,II,"for the purpose of marital intercourse, he began a sad inquiry into the"
378,II,nature of things. The world was so full of things: clouds and winds
379,II,"and sewing machines, kings and brigands, hats and heads, flower-pots,"
380,II,jam and public-houses--surely one could find a little to chat about at
381,II,any moment if one were not ambitiously particular. With inanimate
382,II,objects one could speak of shape and colour and usefulness. Animate
383,II,"objects had, beside these, movements and aptitudes for eating and"
384,II,"drinking, playing and quarrelling. Artistic things were well or badly"
385,II,"executed, and were also capable of an inter-comparison which could not"
386,II,but be interesting and lengthy.--These things could all be talked
387,II,about. There were positive and negative qualities attaching to
388,II,"everything, and when the former was exhausted the latter could still be"
389,II,"profitably mined--""Order,"" said he, ""subsists in everything, and even"
390,II,"conversation must be subject to laws capable of ascertainment."""
391,II,
392,II,"He carefully, and under the terms of badinage, approached other men,"
393,II,"inquiring how they bore themselves in the matrimonial dispute, and what"
394,II,were the subjects usually spoken of in the intimacies of family life.
395,II,But from these people he received the smallest assistance.--Some were
396,II,"ribald, some jocose, some so darkly explanatory that intelligence could"
397,II,not peer through the mist or could only divine that these hated their
398,II,wives. One man held that all domestic matters should be left entirely
399,II,to the wife and that talking was a domestic matter. Another said that
400,II,"the words ""yes, no, and why"" would safeguard a man through any"
401,II,"labyrinth, however tortuous. Another said that he always went out when"
402,II,the wife began to speak; and yet another suggested that the only
403,II,"possible basis for conversation was that of perpetual opposition, where"
404,II,"an affirmation was always countered by a denial, and the proving of the"
405,II,case exercised both time and intelligence.
406,II,
407,II,As he sat in the train beside his wife the silence which he so dreaded
408,II,came upon them. Emptiness buzzed in his head. He sought diligently
409,II,for something to speak about--the characteristics of objects! There
410,II,"were objects and to spare, but he could not say--""that window is"
411,II,"square, it is made of glass,"" or, ""the roof of this carriage is flat,"
412,II,"it is made of wood."""
413,II,
414,II,"Suddenly his wife buried her face in her muff, and her shoulders were"
415,II,convulsed. . . .
416,II,
417,II,Love and contrition possessed him on the instant. He eased his husky
418,II,"throat, and the dreaded, interminable conversation began--"
419,II,
420,II,"""What are you crying for, my dear?"" said he."
421,II,
422,II,"Her voice, smothered by the fur, replied--"
423,II,
424,II,"""I am not crying, darling,"" said she, ""I am only laughing."""

427,III,III
428,III,
429,III,He got stiffly up from his seat before the fire--
430,III,
431,III,"""Be hanged,"" said he, ""if I wait any longer for her. If she doesn't"
432,III,"please to come in before this hour let her stop out."" He stared into"
433,III,"the fire for a few moments--""Let her go to Jericho,"" said he, and he"
434,III,tramped up to bed.
435,III,
436,III,"They had been married just six months, after, as he put it, the hardest"
437,III,courtship a man ever undertook. She was more like a piece of
438,III,"quicksilver than a girl. She was as uncertain as a spring wind, as"
439,III,"flighty as a ball of thistledown--""Doesn't know her own mind for ten"
440,III,"minutes together,"" he groaned. ""Hasn't any mind at all,"" he'd think an"
441,III,"hour later. While, on the following day, it might be--""That woman is"
442,III,"too deep, she is dodging all round me, she is sticking her finger in my"
443,III,"eye. She treats me as if I wasn't there at one moment, and diddles me"
444,III,"as if I was Tom Fool the next--I'll get out of it."""
445,III,
446,III,"He had got out of it three or four times--halted her against a wall,"
447,III,"and, with a furious forefinger, wagged all her misdeeds in her face;"
448,III,"then, rating her up, down and round, he had prepared to march away"
449,III,"complacent and refreshed like Justice taking leave of a sinner, only to"
450,III,find that if the jade wept he could not go away--
451,III,
452,III,"""Dash it all,"" said he, ""you can't leave a girl squatting down against"
453,III,"a wall, with her head in her lap and she crying. Hang it,"" said he,"
454,III,"""you feel as if there was water round your legs and you'll splash if"
455,III,"you move."""
456,III,
457,III,"So he leavened justice with mercy, and, having dried her tears with his"
458,III,"lips, he found himself in the same position as before, with a mad"
459,III,"suspicion tattering through his brain that maybe he had been ""diddled"""
460,III,again.
461,III,
462,III,"But he married her, and to do that was a job also. She shied at"
463,III,matrimony. She shied at everything that looked plain or straight. She
464,III,was like a young dog out for a walk: when she met a side-street she
465,III,"bolted down it and was instantly surrounded by adventure and misery,"
466,III,"returning, like the recovered pup, thick with the mud of those"
467,III,"excursions. There was a lust in her blood for side-streets, laneways"
468,III,and corners.
469,III,
470,III,"""Marriage!"" said she, and she was woebegone--""Marriage will be for"
471,III,"ever."""
472,III,
473,III,"""So will heaven,"" he retorted comfortingly."
474,III,
475,III,"""So will--the other place,"" said she, with a giggle, and crushed him"
476,III,under the feeling that she envisaged him as the devil of that
477,III,"particular Hades, instead of as an unfortunate sinner plucked up by the"
478,III,heels and soused into the stew-pan by his wife.
479,III,
480,III,He addressed himself--
481,III,
482,III,"""When we are married,"" said he, ""I'll keep a hand on you, my lady, that"
483,III,"you won't be able to wriggle away from. If you are slippery, and faith"
484,III,"you are, why I'm tough, and so you'll find it."" ""Get rid of your kinks"
485,III,"before you marry,"" said he. ""I've no use for a wife with one eye on"
486,III,"me, and it a dubious one, and the other one squinting into a parlour"
487,III,two streets off. You've got to settle down and quit tricks. A wife
488,III,"has no one else to deceive but her husband, that's all she can want"
489,III,"tricks for, and there's not going to be any in my house. It's all"
490,III,"right for a pretty girl to be a bit larky----"""
491,III,
492,III,"""Am I really pretty?"" said she, deeply interested and leaning forward"
493,III,"with her hands clasping her knees--""Do you really and truly think I am"
494,III,"pretty? I met a man one time, he had a brown moustache and blue eyes,"
495,III,"outside a tailor's shop in Georges Street, with a public-house on one"
496,III,"side, and he said he thought I was very pretty: he told me what his"
497,III,"name was, but I forget it: maybe, you know him: he wears a tweed suit"
498,III,"with a stripe and a soft hat--Let me see, no, his name began with a"

504,"T----""",
505,"T----""","So married they were, six months now, and the wits were nearly worried"

515,"T----""","""Heart-scalded I am,"" said he, ""with her hopping and trotting. She"

520,"T----""",
521,"T----""",And now it was all finished. Here was twelve o'clock at night and an

602,A GLASS OF BEER,"It was now his custom to sit there. The world has its habits, why"
603,A GLASS OF BEER,should a man not have his? The earth rolls out of light and into
604,A GLASS OF BEER,darkness as punctually as a business man goes to and from his office;
605,A GLASS OF BEER,"the seasons come with the regularity of automata, and go as if they"
606,A GLASS OF BEER,"were pushed by an ejector; so, night after night, he strolled from the"
607,A GLASS OF BEER,"Place de l'Observatoire to the Font St. Michel, and, on the return"
608,A GLASS OF BEER,"journey, sat down at the same Café, at the same table, if he could"
609,A GLASS OF BEER,"manage it, and ordered the same drink."
610,A GLASS OF BEER,
611,A GLASS OF BEER,So regular had his attendance become that the waiter would suggest the
612,A GLASS OF BEER,"order before it was spoken. He did not drink beer because he liked it,"
613,A GLASS OF BEER,but only because it was not a difficult thing to ask for. Always he
614,A GLASS OF BEER,"had been easily discouraged, and he distrusted his French almost as"
615,A GLASS OF BEER,much as other people had reason to. The only time he had varied the
616,A GLASS OF BEER,"order was to request ""un vin blanc gommée,"" but on that occasion he had"
617,A GLASS OF BEER,"been served with a postage stamp for twenty-five centimes, and he still"
618,A GLASS OF BEER,wondered when he remembered it.
619,A GLASS OF BEER,
620,A GLASS OF BEER,He liked to think of his first French conversation. He wanted
621,A GLASS OF BEER,"something to read in English, but was timid of asking for it. He"
622,A GLASS OF BEER,"walked past all the newspaper kiosks on the Boulevard, anxiously"
623,A GLASS OF BEER,"scanning the vendors inside--they were usually very stalwart, very"
624,A GLASS OF BEER,"competent females, who looked as though they had outgrown their sins"
625,A GLASS OF BEER,"but remembered them with pleasure. They had the dully-polished,"
626,A GLASS OF BEER,"slightly-battered look of a modern antique. The words ""M'sieu, Madame"""
627,A GLASS OF BEER,"rang from them as from bells. They were very alert, sitting, as it"
628,A GLASS OF BEER,"were, on tiptoe, and their eyes hit one as one approached. They were"
629,A GLASS OF BEER,like spiders squatting in their little houses waiting for their daily
630,A GLASS OF BEER,flies.
631,A GLASS OF BEER,
632,A GLASS OF BEER,"He found one who looked jolly and harmless, sympathetic indeed, and to"
633,A GLASS OF BEER,"her, with a flourished hat, he approached. Said he, ""Donnez-moi,"
634,A GLASS OF BEER,"Madame, s'il vous plaît, le _Daily Mail_."" At the second repetition"
635,A GLASS OF BEER,"the good lady smiled at him, a smile compounded of benevolence and"
636,A GLASS OF BEER,"comprehension, and instantly, with a ""V'la M'sieu,"" she handed him _The"
637,A GLASS OF BEER,"New York Herald_. They had saluted each other, and he marched down the"
638,A GLASS OF BEER,"road in delight, with his first purchase under his arm and his first"
639,A GLASS OF BEER,foreign conversation accomplished.
640,A GLASS OF BEER,
641,A GLASS OF BEER,"At that time everything had delighted him--the wide, well-lighted"
642,A GLASS OF BEER,"Boulevard, the concierges knitting in their immense doorways, each"
643,A GLASS OF BEER,"looking like a replica of the other, each seeming sister to a"
644,A GLASS OF BEER,kiosk-keeper or a cat. The exactly-courteous speech of the people and
645,A GLASS OF BEER,their not quite so rigorously courteous manners pleased him. He
646,A GLASS OF BEER,"listened to the voluble men who went by, speaking in a haste so"
647,A GLASS OF BEER,breathless that he marvelled how the prepositions and conjunctions
648,A GLASS OF BEER,stuck to their duty in so swirling an ocean of chatter. There was a
649,A GLASS OF BEER,big black dog with a mottled head who lay nightly on the pavement
650,A GLASS OF BEER,opposite the Square de l'Observatoire. At intervals he raised his lean
651,A GLASS OF BEER,skull from the ground and composed a low lament to an absent friend.
652,A GLASS OF BEER,His grief was respected. The folk who passed stepped sidewards for
653,A GLASS OF BEER,"him, and he took no heed of their passage--a lonely, introspective dog"
654,A GLASS OF BEER,"to whom a caress or a bone were equally childish things: Let me alone,"
655,A GLASS OF BEER,"he seemed to say, I have my grief, and it is company enough. There was"
656,A GLASS OF BEER,"the very superior cat who sat on every window-ledge, winking at life."
657,A GLASS OF BEER,"He (for in France all cats are masculine by order of philology), he did"
658,A GLASS OF BEER,"not care a rap for man or dog, but he liked women and permitted them to"
659,A GLASS OF BEER,observe him. There was the man who insinuated himself between the
660,A GLASS OF BEER,"tables at the Café, holding out postcard-representations of the"
661,A GLASS OF BEER,"Pantheon, the Louvre, Notre Dame, and other places. From beneath these"
662,A GLASS OF BEER,cards his dexterous little finger would suddenly flip others. One saw
663,A GLASS OF BEER,"a hurried leg, an arm that shone and vanished, a bosom that fled shyly"
664,A GLASS OF BEER,"again, an audacious swan, a Leda who was thoroughly enjoying herself"
665,A GLASS OF BEER,and had never heard of virtue. His look suggested that he thought
666,A GLASS OF BEER,better of one than to suppose that one was not interested in the nude.
667,A GLASS OF BEER,"""M'sieu,"" he seemed to say, with his fixed, brown-eyed regard, ""this is"
668,A GLASS OF BEER,"indeed a leg, an authentic leg, not disguised by even the littlest of"
669,A GLASS OF BEER,"stockings; it is arranged precisely as M'sieu would desire it."" His"
670,A GLASS OF BEER,sorrow as he went away was dignified with regret for an inartistic
671,A GLASS OF BEER,"gentleman. One was _en garçon_, and yet one would not look at one's"
672,A GLASS OF BEER,postcards! One had better then cease to be an artist and take to
673,A GLASS OF BEER,peddling onions and asparagus as the vulgar do.
674,A GLASS OF BEER,
675,A GLASS OF BEER,"It was all a long time ago, and now, somehow, the savour had departed"
676,A GLASS OF BEER,from these things. Perhaps he had seen them too often. Perhaps a kind
677,A GLASS OF BEER,"of public surreptitiousness, a quite open furtiveness, had troubled"
678,A GLASS OF BEER,"him. Maybe he was not well. He sat at his Café, three quarters down"
679,A GLASS OF BEER,"the Boulevard, and before him a multitude of grotesque beings were"
680,A GLASS OF BEER,pacing as he sipped his bock.
681,A GLASS OF BEER,
682,A GLASS OF BEER,"Good manners decreed that he should not stare too steadfastly, and he"
683,A GLASS OF BEER,was one who obeyed these delicate dictations. Alas! he was one who
684,A GLASS OF BEER,"obeyed all dictates. For him authority wore a halo, and many sins"
685,A GLASS OF BEER,which his heyday ought to have committed had been left undone only
686,A GLASS OF BEER,because they were not sanctioned by immediate social usage. He was
687,A GLASS OF BEER,often saddened when he thought of the things he had not done. It was
688,A GLASS OF BEER,"the only sadness to which he had access, because the evil deeds which"
689,A GLASS OF BEER,he had committed were of so tepid and hygienic a character that they
690,A GLASS OF BEER,"could not be mourned for without hypocrisy, and now that he was"
691,A GLASS OF BEER,released from all privileged restraints and overlookings and could do
692,A GLASS OF BEER,whatever he wished he had no wish to do anything.
693,A GLASS OF BEER,
694,A GLASS OF BEER,"His wife had been dead for over a year. He had hungered, he had prayed"
695,A GLASS OF BEER,for her death. He had hated that woman (and for how many years!) with
696,A GLASS OF BEER,a kind of masked ferocity. How often he had been tempted to kill her
697,A GLASS OF BEER,or to kill himself! How often he had dreamed that she had run away
698,A GLASS OF BEER,from him or that he had run away from her! He had invented Russian
699,A GLASS OF BEER,"Princes, and Music Hall Stars, and American Billionaires with whom she"
700,A GLASS OF BEER,"could adequately elope, and he had both loved and loathed the prospect."
701,A GLASS OF BEER,"What unending, slow quarrels they had together! How her voice had"
702,A GLASS OF BEER,"droned pitilessly on his ears! She in one room, he in another, and"
703,A GLASS OF BEER,through the open door there rolled that unending recitation of woes and
704,A GLASS OF BEER,"reproaches, an interminable catalogue of nothings, while he sat dumb as"
705,A GLASS OF BEER,"a fish, with a mind that smouldered or blazed. He had stood unseen"
706,A GLASS OF BEER,"with a hammer, a poker, a razor in his hand, on tiptoe to do it. A"
707,A GLASS OF BEER,"movement, a rush, one silent rush and it was done! He had revelled in"
708,A GLASS OF BEER,"her murder. He had caressed it, rehearsed it, relished it, had jerked"
709,A GLASS OF BEER,"her head back, and hacked, and listened to her entreaties bubbling"
710,A GLASS OF BEER,through blood!
711,A GLASS OF BEER,
712,A GLASS OF BEER,And then she died! When he stood by her bed he had wished to taunt
713,A GLASS OF BEER,"her, but he could not do it. He read in her eyes--I am dying, and in a"
714,A GLASS OF BEER,"little time I shall have vanished like dust on the wind, but you will"
715,A GLASS OF BEER,"still be here, and you will never see me again--He wished to ratify"
716,A GLASS OF BEER,"that, to assure her that it was actually so, to say that he would come"
717,A GLASS OF BEER,"home on the morrow night, and she would not be there, and that he would"
718,A GLASS OF BEER,"return home every night, and she would never be there. But he could"
719,A GLASS OF BEER,"not say it. Somehow the words, although he desired them, would not"
720,A GLASS OF BEER,come. His arm went to her neck and settled there. His hand caressed
721,A GLASS OF BEER,"her hair, her cheek. He kissed her eyes, her lips, her languid hands;"
722,A GLASS OF BEER,and the words that came were only an infantile babble of regrets and
723,A GLASS OF BEER,"apologies, assurances that he did love her, that he had never loved any"
724,A GLASS OF BEER,"one before, and never would love any one again. . . ."
725,A GLASS OF BEER,
726,A GLASS OF BEER,Every one who passed looked into the Café where he sat. Every one who
727,A GLASS OF BEER,passed looked at him. There were men with sallow faces and wide black
728,A GLASS OF BEER,"hats. Some had hair that flapped about them in the wind, and from"
729,A GLASS OF BEER,"their locks one gathered, with some distaste, the spices of Araby."
730,A GLASS OF BEER,Some had cravats that fluttered and fell and rose again like banners in
731,A GLASS OF BEER,"a storm. There were men with severe, spade-shaped, most"
732,A GLASS OF BEER,"responsible-looking beards, and quizzical little eyes which gave the"
733,A GLASS OF BEER,lie to their hairy sedateness--eyes which had spent long years in
734,A GLASS OF BEER,looking sidewards as a woman passed. There were men of every stage of
735,A GLASS OF BEER,foppishness--men who had spent so much time on their moustaches that
736,A GLASS OF BEER,"they had only a little left for their finger-nails, but their"
737,A GLASS OF BEER,"moustaches exonerated them; others who were coated to happiness,"
738,A GLASS OF BEER,"trousered to grotesqueness, and booted to misery. He thought--In this"
739,A GLASS OF BEER,"city the men wear their own coats, but they all wear some one else's"
740,A GLASS OF BEER,"trousers, and their boots are syndicated."
741,A GLASS OF BEER,
742,A GLASS OF BEER,"He saw no person who was self-intent. They were all deeply conscious,"
743,A GLASS OF BEER,"not of themselves, but of each other. They were all looking at each"
744,A GLASS OF BEER,"other. They were all looking at him; and he returned the severe, or"
745,A GLASS OF BEER,"humourous, or appraising gaze of each with a look nicely proportioned"
746,A GLASS OF BEER,"to the passer, giving back exactly what was given to him, and no more."
747,A GLASS OF BEER,"He did not stare, for nobody stared. He just looked and looked away,"
748,A GLASS OF BEER,and was as mannerly as was required.
749,A GLASS OF BEER,
750,A GLASS OF BEER,A negro went by arm in arm with a girl who was so sallow that she was
751,A GLASS OF BEER,"only white by courtesy. He was a bulky man, and as he bent greedily"
752,A GLASS OF BEER,over his companion it was evident that to him she was whiter than the
753,A GLASS OF BEER,snow of a single night.
754,A GLASS OF BEER,
755,A GLASS OF BEER,"Women went past in multitudes, and he knew the appearance of them all."
756,A GLASS OF BEER,How many times he had watched them or their duplicates striding and
757,A GLASS OF BEER,"mincing and bounding by, each moving like an animated note of"
758,A GLASS OF BEER,"interrogation! They were long, and medium, and short. There were"
759,A GLASS OF BEER,"women of a thinness beyond comparison, sheathed in skirts as featly as"
760,A GLASS OF BEER,"a rapier in a scabbard. There were women of a monumental, a mighty"
761,A GLASS OF BEER,"fatness, who billowed and rolled in multitudinous, stormy garments."
762,A GLASS OF BEER,"There were slow eyes that drooped on one heavily as a hand, and quick"
763,A GLASS OF BEER,"ones that stabbed and withdrew, and glanced again appealingly, and slid"
764,A GLASS OF BEER,"away cursing. There were some who lounged with a false sedateness, and"
765,A GLASS OF BEER,some who fluttered in an equally false timidity. Some wore velvet
766,A GLASS OF BEER,"shoes without heels. Some had shoes, the heels whereof were of such"
767,A GLASS OF BEER,inordinate length that the wearers looked as though they were perched
768,A GLASS OF BEER,on stilts and would topple to perdition if their skill failed for an
769,A GLASS OF BEER,"instant. They passed and they looked at him; and from each, after the"
770,A GLASS OF BEER,"due regard, he looked away to the next in interminable procession."
771,A GLASS OF BEER,
772,A GLASS OF BEER,There were faces also to be looked at: round chubby faces wherefrom the
773,A GLASS OF BEER,"eyes of oxen stared in slow, involved rumination. Long faces that were"
774,A GLASS OF BEER,keener than hatchets and as cruel. Faces that pretended to be scornful
775,A GLASS OF BEER,and were only piteous. Faces contrived to ape a temperament other than
776,A GLASS OF BEER,their own. Raddled faces with heavy eyes and rouged lips. Ragged lips
777,A GLASS OF BEER,that had been chewed by every mad dog in the world. What lips there
778,A GLASS OF BEER,were everywhere! Bright scarlet splashes in dead-white faces. Thin
779,A GLASS OF BEER,"red gashes that suggested rat-traps instead of kisses. Bulbous, flabby"
780,A GLASS OF BEER,lips that would wobble and shiver if attention failed them. Lips of a
781,A GLASS OF BEER,horrid fascination that one looked at and hated and ran to. . . .
782,A GLASS OF BEER,"Looking at him slyly or boldly, they passed along, and turned after a"
783,A GLASS OF BEER,"while and repassed him, and turned again in promenade."
784,A GLASS OF BEER,
785,A GLASS OF BEER,He had a sickness of them all. There had been a time when these were
786,A GLASS OF BEER,"among the things he mourned for not having done, but that time was long"
787,A GLASS OF BEER,"past. He guessed at their pleasures, and knew them to be without salt."
788,A GLASS OF BEER,"Life, said he, is as unpleasant as a plate of cold porridge. Somehow"
789,A GLASS OF BEER,the world was growing empty for him. He wondered was he outgrowing his
790,A GLASS OF BEER,"illusions, or his appetites, or both? The things in which other men"
791,A GLASS OF BEER,"took such interest were drifting beyond him, and (for it seemed that"
792,A GLASS OF BEER,the law of compensation can fail) nothing was drifting towards him in
793,A GLASS OF BEER,"recompense. He foresaw himself as a box with nothing inside it, and he"
794,A GLASS OF BEER,thought--It is not through love or fear or distress that men commit
795,A GLASS OF BEER,suicide: it is because they have become empty: both the gods and the
796,A GLASS OF BEER,devils have deserted them and they can no longer support that solemn
797,A GLASS OF BEER,stagnation. He marvelled to see with what activity men and women
798,A GLASS OF BEER,played the most savourless of games! With what zest of pursuit they
799,A GLASS OF BEER,tracked what petty interests. He saw them as ants scurrying with
800,A GLASS OF BEER,"scraps of straw, or apes that pick up and drop and pick again, and he"
801,A GLASS OF BEER,"marvelled from what fount they renewed themselves, or with what charms"
802,A GLASS OF BEER,they exorcised the demons of satiety.
803,A GLASS OF BEER,
804,A GLASS OF BEER,On this night life did not seem worth while. The taste had gone from
805,A GLASS OF BEER,his mouth; his bock was water vilely coloured; his cigarette was a hot
806,A GLASS OF BEER,"stench. And yet a full moon was peeping in the trees along the path,"
807,A GLASS OF BEER,"and not far away, where the countryside bowed in silver quietude, the"
808,A GLASS OF BEER,rivers ran through undistinguishable fields chanting their lonely
809,A GLASS OF BEER,"songs. The seas leaped and withdrew, and called again to the stars,"
810,A GLASS OF BEER,"and gathered in ecstasy and roared skywards, and the trees did not rob"
811,A GLASS OF BEER,each other more than was absolutely necessary. The men and women were
812,A GLASS OF BEER,"all hidden away, sleeping in their cells, where the moon could not see"
813,A GLASS OF BEER,"them, nor the clean wind, nor the stars. They were sundered for a"
814,A GLASS OF BEER,little while from their eternal arithmetic. The grasping hands were
815,A GLASS OF BEER,lying as quietly as the paws of a sleeping dog. Those eyes held no
816,A GLASS OF BEER,further speculation than the eyes of an ox who lies down. The tongues
817,A GLASS OF BEER,"that had lied all day, and been treacherous and obscene and respectful"
818,A GLASS OF BEER,"by easy turn, said nothing more; and he thought it was very good that"
819,A GLASS OF BEER,"they were all hidden, and that for a little time the world might swing"
820,A GLASS OF BEER,darkly with the moon in its own wide circle and its silence.
821,A GLASS OF BEER,
822,A GLASS OF BEER,"He paid for his bock, gave the waiter a tip, touched his hat to a lady"
823,A GLASS OF BEER,"by sex and a gentleman by clothing, and strolled back to his room that"
824,A GLASS OF BEER,"was little, his candle that was three-quarters consumed, and his"
825,A GLASS OF BEER,picture which might be admired when he was dead but which he would
826,A GLASS OF BEER,"never be praised for painting; and, after sticking his foot through the"
827,A GLASS OF BEER,"canvas, he tugged himself to bed, agreeing to commence the following"
828,A GLASS OF BEER,"morning just as he had the previous one, and the one before that, and"
829,A GLASS OF BEER,the one before that again.

860,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT
861,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
862,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,He was one of those men who can call ladies by their Christian names.
863,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"One day he met twenty-four duchesses walking on a red carpet, and he"
864,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"winked at them, and they were all delighted. It was so at first he"
865,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,appeared to her. Has a mere girl any protection against a man of that
866,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,quality? and she was the very merest of girls--she knew it. It was not
867,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"that she was ignorant, for she had read widely about men, and she had"
868,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,three brothers as to whom she knew divers intimate things.
869,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
870,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,The girl who has been reared among brothers has few defences against
871,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,other males. She has acquired two things--a belief in the divine right
872,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"of man, and a curiosity as to what those men are like who are not her"
873,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"brothers. She may love her brothers, but she cannot believe that they"
874,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,adequately represent the other sex. Does not every girl wish to marry
875,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,the antithesis of her brother? The feeling is that one should marry as
876,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"far outside of the family as is possible, and as far outside of one's"
877,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"self as may be; but love has become subject to geography, and our"
878,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,choice is often bounded by the tramline upon which we travel from our
879,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,houses to our businesses and back again.
880,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
881,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"While she loved and understood her brothers, she had not in the least"
882,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"understood or believed in the stories she had read, and so, when the"
883,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"Young Man out of a Book came to her, she was delighted but perplexed."
884,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
885,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,It was difficult to live up to him worthily. It was difficult to know
886,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"what he would do next, and it was exceedingly difficult to keep out of"
887,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"his way; for, indeed, he seemed to pervade the part of the world where"
888,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,she lived. He was as ubiquitous as the air or the sky. If she went
889,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"into a shop, he was pacing on the pavement when she came out. If she"
890,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,went for a walk he was standing at the place farther than which she had
891,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,decided not to go. She had found him examining a waterfall on the
892,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"Dodder, leaning over the bear-pit in the Zoological Gardens, and"
893,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"kneeling beside her in the Chapel, and her sleep had been distressed by"
894,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,the reflection that maybe he was sitting on her window-sill like a sad
895,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"sparrow drenched in the rain, all its feathers on end with the cold,"
896,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,and its eyes wide open staring at misery.
897,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
898,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,The first time they met he spoke to her. He plucked a handkerchief
899,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"from somewhere and thrust it into her hand, saying--"
900,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
901,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"""You have dropped this, I think""--and she had been too alarmed to"
902,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,disown it.
903,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
904,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,It was a mighty handkerchief. It was so big that it would scarcely fit
905,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"into her muff.--""It is a table-cloth,"" said she, as she solemnly"
906,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"stuffed away its lengthy flaps. ""It is his own,"" she thought a moment"
907,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"later, and she would have laughed like a mad woman, only that she had"
908,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"no time, for he was pacing delicately by her side, and talking in a low"
909,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"voice that was partly a whisper and partly a whistle, and was entirely"
910,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,and disturbingly delicious.
911,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
912,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,The next time they met very suddenly. Scarcely a dozen paces separated
913,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"them. She could see him advancing towards her, and knew by his knitted"
914,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,brows that he was searching anxiously for something to say. When they
915,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,drew together he lifted his hat and murmured--
916,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
917,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"""How is your handkerchief to-day?"""
918,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
919,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,The query so astonished her that (the verb is her own) she simply
920,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"bawled with laughter. From that moment he treated her with freedom,"
921,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"for if once you laugh with a person you admit him to equality, you have"
922,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"ranked him definitely as a vertebrate, your hand is his by right of"
923,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"species, scarcely can you withhold even your lips from his advances."
924,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
925,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"Another, a strange, a fascinating thing, was that he was afraid of her."
926,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"It was inconceivable, it was mad, but it was true. He looked at her"
927,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,with disguised terror. His bravado was the slenderest mask. Every
928,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"word he said was uttered tentatively, it was subject to her approval,"
929,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,and if she opposed a statement he dropped it instantly and adopted her
930,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,alternative as one adopts a gift. This astonished her who had been
931,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,prepared to be terrified. He kept a little distance between them as he
932,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"walked, and when she looked at him he looked away. She had a vision of"
933,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"herself as an ogre--whiskers sprouted all over her face, her ears"
934,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"bulged and swaggled, her voice became a cavernous rumble, her"
935,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"conversation sounded like fee-faw-fum--and yet, her brothers were not"
936,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,afraid of her in the least; they pinched her and kicked her hat.
937,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
938,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,He spoke (but always without prejudice) of the loveliest things
939,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"imaginable--matters about which brothers had no conception, and for"
940,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,which they would not have any reverence. He said one day that the sky
941,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"was blue, and, on looking she found that it was so. The sky was"
942,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"amazingly blue. It had never struck her before, but there was a colour"
943,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,in the firmament before which one might fall down and worship.
944,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"Sunlight was not the hot glare which it had been: it was rich,"
945,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"generous, it was inexpressibly beautiful. The colour and scent of"
946,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,flowers became more varied. The world emerged as from shrouds and
947,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"cerements. It was tender and radiant, comeliness lived everywhere, and"
948,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,goodwill. Laughter! the very ground bubbled with it: the grasses waved
949,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"their hands, the trees danced and curtsied to one another with gentle"
950,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"dignity, and the wind lurched down the path with its hat on the side of"
951,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"its head and its hands in its pockets, whistling like her younger"
952,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,brother.
953,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
954,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,And then he went away. She did not see him any more. He was not by
955,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"the waterfall on the Dodder, nor hanging over the bear-pit in the Zoo."
956,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"He was not in the Chapel, nor on the pavement when she came out of a"
957,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"shop. He was not anywhere. She searched, but he was not anywhere."
958,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,And the sun became the hot pest it had always been: the heavens were
959,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,stuffed with dirty clouds the way a second-hand shop is stuffed with
960,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,dirty bundles: the trees were hulking corner-boys with muddy boots: the
961,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"wind blew dust into her eye, and her brothers pulled her hair and"
962,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,kicked her hat; so that she went apart from all these. She sat before
963,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,the mirror regarding herself with woeful amazement--
964,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
965,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,"""He was afraid of me!"" she said."
966,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
967,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,And she wept into his monstrous handkerchief.
968,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
969,THREE WOMEN WHO WEPT,
970,II,II
971,II,
972,II,"When he came into the world he came howling, and he howled without"
973,II,"ceasing for seven long years, except at the times when he happened to"
974,II,"be partaking of nourishment, or was fast asleep, and, even then, he"
975,II,snored with a note of defiance and protest which proved that his humour
976,II,was not for peace.
977,II,
978,II,The time came when he ceased to howl and became fascinated by the
979,II,problem of how to make other people howl. In this art he became an
980,II,adept. When he and another child chanced to be left together there
981,II,"came, apparently from the uttermost ends of the earth, a pin, and the"
982,II,other child and the pin were soon in violent and lamentable conjunction.
983,II,
984,II,So he grew.
985,II,
986,II,"""Be hanged if I know what to do with him,"" said his father as he"
987,II,"rebuckled on his belt. ""The devil's self hasn't got the shape or match"
988,II,of such an imp in all the length and breadth of his seven hells. I'm
989,II,"sick, sore and sorry whacking him, so I am, and before long I'll be"
990,II,hung on the head of him. I'm saying that there's more deceit and
991,II,devilment in his bit of a carcass than there is in a public-house full
992,II,"of tinkers, so there is."""
993,II,
994,II,He turned to his wife--
995,II,
996,II,"""It's no credit at all the son you've bore me, ma'am, but a sorrow and"
997,II,a woe that'll be killing us in our old age and maybe damning our souls
998,II,at the heel of it. Where he got his blackguardly ways from I'm not
999,II,"saying, but it wasn't from my side of the house anyway, so it wasn't,"
1000,II,"and that's a moral. Get out of my sight you sniffling lout, and if"
1001,II,ever I catch you at your practices again I'll lam you till you won't be
1002,II,"able to wink without help, so I will."""
1003,II,
1004,II,"""Musha,"" sobbed his wife, ""don't be always talking out of you. Any one"
1005,II,"would think that it was an old, criminal thief you were instructing,"
1006,II,instead of a bit of a child that'll be growing out of his wildness in
1007,II,"no time. Come across to me, child, come over to your mother, my lamb."""
1008,II,
1009,II,"That night, when his father got into bed, he prodded his foot against"
1010,II,something under the sheets. Investigation discovered a brown paper bag
1011,II,"at the end of the bed. A further search revealed a wasp's nest, inside"
1012,II,of which there was an hundred angry wasps blazing for combat. His
1013,II,father left the room with more expedition than decency. He did not
1014,II,stop to put on as much as his hat. He fled to the stream which ran
1015,II,"through the meadow at the back of their house, and lay down in it, and"
1016,II,in two seconds there was more bad language than water in the stream.
1017,II,Every time he lifted his head for air the wasps flew at him with their
1018,II,"tails curled. They kept him there for half an hour, and in that time"
1019,II,he laid in the seeds of more rheumatism than could be cured in two
1020,II,lifetimes.
1021,II,
1022,II,When he returned home he found his wife lying on the floor with a
1023,II,"blanket wrapped about her head, groaning by instinct, for she was"
1024,II,senseless.
1025,II,
1026,II,Her face had disappeared. There was nothing where it had been but
1027,II,poisoned lumps. A few days later it was found that she was blind of
1028,II,"one eye, and there was danger of erysipelas setting in."
1029,II,
1030,II,"The boy could not be found for some time, but a neighbour, observing a"
1031,II,"stone come from nowhere in particular and hit a cat, located the first"
1032,II,"cause in a ditch. He brought the boy home, and grabbed his father just"
1033,II,in time to prevent murder being done.
1034,II,
1035,II,It was soon found that the only thing which eased the restless moaning
1036,II,"woman was the touch of her son. All her unmanageable, delirious"
1037,II,thoughts centred on him--
1038,II,
1039,II,"""Sure he's only a boy; beating never did good to anything. Give him a"
1040,II,chance now for wouldn't a child be a bit wild anyhow. You will be a
1041,II,"good boy, won't you? Come to your mother, my lamb."""
1042,II,
1043,II,"So the lad grew, from twelve to fifteen, from fifteen to twenty. Soon"
1044,II,he attained to manhood. To his mother he seemed to have leaped in a
1045,II,"day from the careless, prattling babe to the responsibly-whiskered"
1046,II,miracle at whom mothers sit and laugh in secret delight. This
1047,II,"towering, big-footed, hairy person! was he really the little boy who"
1048,II,used to hide in her skirts when his father scowled? She had only to
1049,II,close her eyes and she could feel again a pair of little hands clawing
1050,II,"at her breast, sore from the violent industry of soft, wee lips."
1051,II,
1052,II,So he grew. Breeches that were big became small. Bony wrists were
1053,II,continually pushing out of coat cuffs. His feet would burst out of his
1054,II,boots. He grew out of everything but one. A man may outgrow his
1055,II,"breeches, he cannot outgrow his nature: his body is never too big or"
1056,II,too small to hold that.
1057,II,
1058,II,Every living thing in the neighbourhood knew him. When a cat saw him
1059,II,coming it climbed a tree and tried to look as much like a lump of wood
1060,II,as it could. When a dog heard his step it tucked its tail out of sight
1061,II,and sought for a hole in the hedge. The birds knew he carried stones
1062,II,in his pockets. No tree cast so black a shadow in the sunlight as he
1063,II,did. There were stories of a bottle of paraffin oil and a cat that
1064,II,screeched in flames. Folk told of a maltreated dog that pointed its
1065,II,nose to heaven and bayed a curse against humanity until a terrified man
1066,II,"battered it to death with a shovel. No one knew who did it, but every"
1067,II,one said there were only two living hearts capable of these
1068,II,"iniquities--one belonged to the devil, the other to our young man, and"
1069,II,they acquitted Satan of the deeds.
1070,II,
1071,II,The owner of the dog swore by the beasts in the field and the stars in
1072,II,the sky that he would tear the throat of the man who had injured his
1073,II,beast.
1074,II,
1075,II,"The father drove his one-eyed wife from the house, and went with her to"
1076,II,"live elsewhere; but she left him and went back to her son, and her"
1077,II,husband forswore the twain.
1078,II,
1079,II,When women saw him in the road they got past him with their breath
1080,II,hissing through their teeth in fear. When men passed him they did it
1081,II,"warily, with their fists clenched and their eyes alert. He was shunned"
1082,II,by every one. The strength of his arms also was a thing to be afraid
1083,II,"of, and in the world there was but two welcomes for him, one from his"
1084,II,"mother, the other from an old, grey rat that slept in his breast--"
1085,II,
1086,II,"""Sure, you're all against him,"" his mother would say. ""Why don't you"
1087,II,give the boy a chance? It's only the hot blood of youth that's working
1088,II,in him--and he never did it either. Look how kind he is to me! never
1089,II,"the bad word or the hard look! Ye black hearts that blame my boy, look"
1090,II,"among yourselves for the villain. No matter who is against you, come"
1091,II,"to your mother, my lamb."""
1092,II,
1093,II,He was found one day at the foot of the cliff with his neck broken.
1094,II,"Some said that he had slipped and fallen, some said he had committed"
1095,II,"suicide, other some pursed their lips tightly and said nothing. All"
1096,II,"were relieved that he was gone, saving his mother only, she mourned for"
1097,II,"her only son, and wept bitterly, refusing to be comforted until she"
1098,II,died.
1099,II,
1100,II,
1101,III,III
1102,III,
1103,III,She had begun to get thin. Her face was growing sharp and peaked. The
1104,III,steady curve of her cheek had become a little indeterminate. Her chin
1105,III,had begun to sag and her eyes to look a little weary. But she had not
1106,III,"observed these things, for we do not notice ourselves very much until"
1107,III,some other person thinks we are worthy of observation and tells us so;
1108,III,and these changes are so gradual and tiny that we seldom observe them
1109,III,until we awaken for a moment or two in our middle age and then we get
1110,III,ready to fall asleep again.
1111,III,
1112,III,"When her uncle died, the solicitors who had administered his will handed"
1113,III,her a small sum of money and intimated that from that date she must hew
1114,III,"out her own path in life, and as she had most of the household furniture"
1115,III,"of her late uncle at her disposal, she decided to let lodgings. Setting"
1116,III,about that end with all possible expedition she finished writing
1117,III,"""apartments to let"" on a square of pasteboard, and, having placed it"
1118,III,"prominently in a window, she folded her mittened hands and sat down with"
1119,III,some trepidation to await the advent of a lodger.
1120,III,
1121,III,He came in the night time with the stars and the moon. He was running
1122,III,"like a youthful god, she thought, for her mind had not yet been weaned"
1123,III,"from certain vanities, and she could not see that a gigantic policeman"
1124,III,"was in his wake, tracking him with elephantine bounds, and now and again"
1125,III,snatching a gasp from hurry to blow furious warnings on a whistle.
1126,III,
1127,III,It was the sound of the whistle which opened her eyes through her ears.
1128,III,"She went to the door and saw him coming framed in the moonlight, his arms"
1129,III,"pressed tightly to his sides, his head well up and his feet kicking a"
1130,III,mile a minute on the pavement. Behind him the whistle shrilled with
1131,III,"angry alarm, and the thunder of monumental feet came near as the"
1132,III,policeman sprinted in majesty.
1133,III,
1134,III,"As the lodger ran she looked at him. He was a long-legged, young man"
1135,III,"with a pleasant, clean-shaven face. His eyes met hers, and, although he"
1136,III,"grinned anxiously, she saw that he was frightened. That frightened smile"
1137,III,"gripped her and she panted noiselessly, ""Oh, run, run!"""
1138,III,
1139,III,"As he drew level he fixed his gaze on her, and, stopping suddenly, he"
1140,III,ducked under her arm and was inside the house in a twinkling.
1141,III,
1142,III,The poor lady's inside curled up in fear and had started to uncurl in
1143,III,"screams when she felt a hand laid gently on her arm, and, ""Don't make a"
1144,III,"noise, or I'm caught,"" said a voice, whereupon, and with exceeding"
1145,III,"difficulty, she closed her mouth while the scream went sizzling through"
1146,III,"her teeth in little gasps. But now the enemy appeared round the corner,"
1147,III,"tooting incessantly on his whistle, and whacking sparks from the"
1148,III,cobblestones as he ran. Behind her she could hear the laboured breathing
1149,III,of a spent runner. The lodger was kneeling at her skirts: he caught her
1150,III,hand and pressed his face against it entreatingly--
1151,III,
1152,III,The policeman drew near--
1153,III,
1154,III,"""Did you see a fellow skedaddling along here, ma'am?"" said he."
1155,III,
1156,III,"She hesitated for only a moment and then, pointing to a laneway opposite,"
1157,III,replied--
1158,III,
1159,III,"""He went up there."""
1160,III,
1161,III,"""Thank you, ma'am,"" said the policeman with a genial smile, and he"
1162,III,sprinted up the laneway whistling cheerily.
1163,III,
1164,III,She turned to the lodger--
1165,III,
1166,III,"""You had better go now,"" said she."
1167,III,
1168,III,He looked at her ruefully and hesitated--
1169,III,
1170,III,"""If I go now,"" he replied, ""I'll be caught and get a month. I'll have to"
1171,III,"eat skilly, you know, and pick oakum, and get my hair cut."""
1172,III,
1173,III,"She looked at his hair--it was brown and wavy, just at his ears it"
1174,III,"crisped into tiny curls, and she thought it would be a great pity to cut"
1175,III,"it. He bore her scrutiny well, with just a trifle of embarrassment and a"
1176,III,shyly humorous eye--
1177,III,
1178,III,"""You are the kindest woman I ever met,"" said he, ""and I'll never forget"
1179,III,you as long as I live. I'll go away now because I wouldn't like to get
1180,III,"you into trouble for helping me."""
1181,III,
1182,III,"""What did you do?"" she faltered."
1183,III,
1184,III,"""I got into a fight with another man,"" he replied, ""and while we were"
1185,III,"hammering each other the policeman came up. He was going to arrest me,"
1186,III,"and, before I knew what I was doing, I knocked him down."""
1187,III,
1188,III,She shook her head--
1189,III,
1190,III,"""You should not have done that. That was very wrong, for he was only"
1191,III,"doing his duty."""
1192,III,
1193,III,"""I know it,"" he admitted, ""but, do you see, I didn't know what I was"
1194,III,"doing, and then, when I hit him, I got frightened and ran."""
1195,III,
1196,III,"""You poor boy,"" said she tenderly."
1197,III,
1198,III,"""And somehow, when I saw you, I knew you wouldn't give me up: wasn't it"
1199,III,"queer?"""
1200,III,
1201,III,"What a nice, gentlemanly young fellow he is, she thought."
1202,III,
1203,III,"""But, of course, I cannot be trespassing on your kindness any longer,"" he"
1204,III,"continued, ""so I'll leave at once, and if ever I get the chance to repay"
1205,III,"your kindness to a stranger----"""
1206,III,
1207,III,"""Perhaps,"" said she, ""it might not be quite safe for you to go yet. Come"
1208,III,inside and I will give you a cup of tea. You must be worn out with the
1209,III,"excitement and the danger. Why, you are shaking all over: a cup of tea"
1210,III,"will steady your nerves and give him time to stop looking for you."""
1211,III,
1212,III,"""Perhaps,"" said he, ""if I turned my coat inside out and turned my"
1213,III,"trousers up, they wouldn't notice me."""
1214,III,
1215,III,"""We will talk it over,"" she replied with a wise nod."
1216,III,
1217,III,That was how the lodger came. He told her his name and his
1218,III,"employment--he was a bookmaker's clerk. He brought his luggage,"
1219,III,"consisting mostly of neckties, to her house the following day from his"
1220,III,former lodgings--
1221,III,
1222,III,"""Had a terrible time getting away from them,"" said he. ""They rather"
1223,III,"liked me, you know, and couldn't make out why I wanted to leave."""
1224,III,
1225,III,"""As if you weren't quite free to do as you wished,"" quoth his indignant"
1226,III,new landlady.
1227,III,
1228,III,"""And then, when they found I would go, they made me pay two weeks' rent"
1229,III,"in lieu of notice--mean, wasn't it?"""
1230,III,
1231,III,"""The low people,"" she replied. ""I will not ask you to pay anything this"
1232,III,"week."""
1233,III,
1234,III,"He put his bandbox on the ground, and shook hands with her--"
1235,III,
1236,III,"""You are a brick,"" said he, ""the last and the biggest of them. There"
1237,III,"isn't the like of you in this or any other world, and never was and never"
1238,III,"will be, world without end, amen."""
1239,III,
1240,III,"""Oh, don't say that,"" said she shyly."
1241,III,
1242,III,"""I will,"" he replied, ""for it's the truth. I'll hire a sandwichman to"
1243,III,stop people in the street and tell it to them. I'll get a week's
1244,III,engagement at the theatre and sing it from the stage. I'll make up a
1245,III,poem about your goodness. I don't know what to do to thank you. Do you
1246,III,"see, if I had to pay you now I'd have to pawn something, and I really"
1247,III,believe I have pawned everything they'd lend on to get the money for that
1248,III,"two weeks' rent. I'm broke until Friday, that's my pay day, but that"
1249,III,"night I'll come home with my wages piled up on a cart."""
1250,III,
1251,III,"""I can lend you a few shillings until then,"" said she laughing."
1252,III,
1253,III,"""Oh, no,"" said he. ""It's not fair. I couldn't do that,"" but he could."
1254,III,
1255,III,Well the light of the world shone out of the lodger. He was like a sea
1256,III,breeze in a soap factory. When he awakened in the morning he whistled.
1257,III,When he came down to breakfast he sang. When he came home in the evening
1258,III,he danced. He had an amazing store of vitality: from the highest hair on
1259,III,the top of his head down to his heels he was alive. His average language
1260,III,"was packed with jokes and wonderful curses. He was as chatty as a girl,"
1261,III,"as good-humoured as a dog, as unconscious as a kitten--and she knew"
1262,III,"nothing at all of men, except, perhaps, that they wore trousers and were"
1263,III,not girls. The only man with whom she had ever come in contact was her
1264,III,"uncle, and he might have been described as a sniffy old man with a cold;"
1265,III,"a blend of gruel and grunt, living in an atmosphere of ointment and pills"
1266,III,"and patent medicine advertisements--and, behold, she was living in"
1267,III,"unthinkable intimacy with the youngest of young men; not an old,"
1268,III,"ache-ridden, cough-racked, corn-footed septuagenarian, but a young,"
1269,III,"fresh-faced, babbling rascal who laughed like the explosion of a"
1270,III,"blunderbuss, roared songs as long as he was within earshot and danced"
1271,III,when he had nothing else to do. He used to show her how to do
1272,III,"hand-balances on the arm-chair, and while his boots were cocked up in the"
1273,III,air she would grow stiff with terror for his safety and for that of the
1274,III,adjacent crockery.
1275,III,
1276,III,"The first morning she was giving him his breakfast, intending afterwards"
1277,III,"to have her own meal in the kitchen, but he used language of such"
1278,III,"strangely attractive ferocity, and glared at her with such a"
1279,III,humorously-mad eye that she was compelled to breakfast with him.
1280,III,
1281,III,"At night, when he returned to his tea, he swore by this and by that he"
1282,III,would die of hunger unless she ate with him; and then he told her all the
1283,III,"doings of the day, the bets that had been made and lost, and what sort of"
1284,III,"a man his boss was, and he extolled the goodness of his friends, and"
1285,III,lectured on the vast iniquity of his enemies.
1286,III,
1287,III,So things went until she was as intimate with him as if he had been her
1288,III,brother. One night he came home just a trifle tipsy. She noted at last
1289,III,"what was wrong with him, and her heart yearned over the sinner. There"
1290,III,"were five or six glasses inside of him, and each was the father of an"
1291,III,"antic. He was an opera company, a gymnasium, and a menagerie at once,"
1292,III,all tinged with a certain hilarious unsteadiness which was fascinating.
1293,III,"But at last he got to his bed, which was more than she did."
1294,III,
1295,III,She sat through the remainder of the night listening to the growth of her
1296,III,"half-starved heart. Oh, but there was a warmth there now. . . .!"
1297,III,Springtime and the moon in flood. What new leaves are these which the
1298,III,"trees put forth? Bird, singing at the peep of morn, where gottest thou"
1299,III,"thy song? Be still, be still, thou stranger, fluttering a wing at my"
1300,III,breast. . . .
1301,III,
1302,III,"At the end of a month the gods moved, and when the gods move they trample"
1303,III,mortals in the dust.
1304,III,
1305,III,"The lodger's employer left Dublin for London, taking his clerk with him."
1306,III,
1307,III,"""Good-bye,"" said he."
1308,III,
1309,III,"""Good-bye,"" she replied, ""and a pleasant journey to you."""
1310,III,
1311,III,"And she took the card with ""Apartments to Let"" written upon it and placed"
1312,III,"it carefully in the window, and then, folding her mittened hands, she sat"
1313,III,"down to await the coming of another lodger, and as she sat she wept"
1314,III,bitterly.
1315,III,
1316,III,
1317,III,
1318,III,
1319,THE TRIANGLE,THE TRIANGLE
1320,THE TRIANGLE,
1321,THE TRIANGLE,Nothing is true for ever. A man and a fact will become equally
1322,THE TRIANGLE,"decrepit and will tumble in the same ditch, for truth is as mortal as"
1323,THE TRIANGLE,"man, and both are outlived by the tortoise and the crow."
1324,THE TRIANGLE,
1325,THE TRIANGLE,To say that two is company and three is a crowd is to make a very
1326,THE TRIANGLE,temporary statement. After a short time satiety or use and wont has
1327,THE TRIANGLE,"crept sunderingly between the two, and, if they are any company at all,"
1328,THE TRIANGLE,"they are bad company, who pray discreetly but passionately for the"
1329,THE TRIANGLE,crowd which is censured by the proverb.
1330,THE TRIANGLE,
1331,THE TRIANGLE,If there had not been a serpent in the Garden of Eden it is likely that
1332,THE TRIANGLE,the bored inhabitants of Paradise would have been forced to import one
1333,THE TRIANGLE,from the outside wilds merely to relax the tedium of a too-sustained
1334,THE TRIANGLE,duet. There ought to be a law that when a man and a woman have been
1335,THE TRIANGLE,married for a year they should be forcibly separated for another year.
1336,THE TRIANGLE,"In the meantime, as our law-givers have no sense, we will continue to"
1337,THE TRIANGLE,invoke the serpent.
1338,THE TRIANGLE,
1339,THE TRIANGLE,Mrs. Mary Morrissy had been married for quite a time to a gentleman of
1340,THE TRIANGLE,"respectable mentality, a sufficiency of money, and a surplus of"
1341,THE TRIANGLE,"leisure--Good things? We would say so if we dared, for we are growing"
1342,THE TRIANGLE,"old and suspicious of all appearances, and we do not easily recognize"
1343,THE TRIANGLE,what is bad or good. Beyond the social circumference we are confronted
1344,THE TRIANGLE,with a debatable ground where good and bad are so merged that we cannot
1345,THE TRIANGLE,distinguish the one from the other. To her husband's mental
1346,THE TRIANGLE,"attainments (from no precipitate, dizzy peaks did he stare; it was only"
1347,THE TRIANGLE,a tiny plain with the tiniest of hills in the centre) Mrs. Morrissy
1348,THE TRIANGLE,extended a courtesy entirely unmixed with awe. For his money she
1349,THE TRIANGLE,extended a hand which could still thrill to an unaccustomed
1350,THE TRIANGLE,"prodigality, but for his leisure (and it was illimitable) she could"
1351,THE TRIANGLE,find no possible use.
1352,THE TRIANGLE,
1353,THE TRIANGLE,The quality of permanency in a transient world is terrifying. A
1354,THE TRIANGLE,"permanent husband is a bore, and we do not know what to do with him."
1355,THE TRIANGLE,He cannot be put on a shelf. He cannot be hung on a nail. He will not
1356,THE TRIANGLE,"go out of the house. There is no escape from him, and he is always the"
1357,THE TRIANGLE,"same. A smile of a certain dimension, moustaches of this inevitable"
1358,THE TRIANGLE,"measurement, hands that waggle and flop like those of automata--these"
1359,THE TRIANGLE,"are his. He eats this way and he drinks that way, and he will continue"
1360,THE TRIANGLE,to do so until he stiffens into the ultimate quietude. He snores on
1361,THE TRIANGLE,"this note, he laughs on that, dissonant, unescapeable, unchanging."
1362,THE TRIANGLE,"This is the way he walks, and he does not know how to run. A"
1363,THE TRIANGLE,"predictable beast indeed! He is known inside and out, catalogued,"
1364,THE TRIANGLE,"ticketed, and he cannot be packed away."
1365,THE TRIANGLE,
1366,THE TRIANGLE,"Mrs. Morrissy did not yet commune with herself about it, but if her"
1367,THE TRIANGLE,grievance was anonymous it was not unknown. There is a back-door to
1368,THE TRIANGLE,"every mind as to every house, and although she refused it house-room,"
1369,THE TRIANGLE,the knowledge sat on her very hearthstone whistling for recognition.
1370,THE TRIANGLE,
1371,THE TRIANGLE,"Indeed, she could not look anywhere without seeing her husband. He was"
1372,THE TRIANGLE,included in every landscape. His moustaches and the sun rose together.
1373,THE TRIANGLE,"His pyjamas dawned with the moon. When the sea roared so did he, and"
1374,THE TRIANGLE,he whispered with the river and the wind. He was in the picture but
1375,THE TRIANGLE,was out of drawing. He was in the song but was out of tune. He
1376,THE TRIANGLE,"agitated her dully, surreptitiously, unceasingly. She questioned of"
1377,THE TRIANGLE,"space in a whisper, ""Are we glued together?"" said she. There was a bee"
1378,THE TRIANGLE,"in a flower, a burly rascal who did not care a rap for any one: he sat"
1379,THE TRIANGLE,"enjoying himself in a scented and gorgeous palace, and in him she"
1380,THE TRIANGLE,confided:
1381,THE TRIANGLE,
1382,THE TRIANGLE,"""If,"" said she to the bee, ""if that man doesn't stop talking to me I'll"
1383,THE TRIANGLE,"kick him. I'll stick a pin in him if he does not go out for a walk."""
1384,THE TRIANGLE,
1385,THE TRIANGLE,She grew desperately nervous. She was afraid that if she looked at him
1386,THE TRIANGLE,"any longer she would see him. To-morrow, she thought, I may notice"
1387,THE TRIANGLE,"that he is a short, fat man in spectacles, and that will be the end of"
1388,THE TRIANGLE,everything. But the end of everything is also the beginning of
1389,THE TRIANGLE,"everything, and so she was one half in fear and the other half in hope."
1390,THE TRIANGLE,"A little more and she would hate him, and would begin the world again"
1391,THE TRIANGLE,with the same little hope and the same little despair for her meagre
1392,THE TRIANGLE,capital.
1393,THE TRIANGLE,
1394,THE TRIANGLE,"She had already elaborated a theory that man was intended to work, and"
1395,THE TRIANGLE,that male sloth was offensive to Providence and should be forbidden by
1396,THE TRIANGLE,"the law. At times her tongue thrilled, silently as yet, to certain"
1397,THE TRIANGLE,"dicta of the experienced Aunt who had superintended her youth, to the"
1398,THE TRIANGLE,intent that a lazy man is a nuisance to himself and to everybody else;
1399,THE TRIANGLE,"and, at last, she disguised this saying as an anecdote and repeated it"
1400,THE TRIANGLE,pleasantly to her husband.
1401,THE TRIANGLE,
1402,THE TRIANGLE,"He received it coldly, pondered it with disfavour, and dismissed it by"
1403,THE TRIANGLE,"arguing that her Aunt had whiskers, that a whiskered female is a freak,"
1404,THE TRIANGLE,and that the intellectual exercises of a freak are---- He lifted his
1405,THE TRIANGLE,eyebrows and his shoulders. He brushed her Aunt from the tips of his
1406,THE TRIANGLE,fingers and blew her delicately beyond good manners and the mode.
1407,THE TRIANGLE,
1408,THE TRIANGLE,But time began to hang heavily on both. The intellectual antics of a
1409,THE TRIANGLE,"leisured man become at last wearisome; his methods of thought, by mere"
1410,THE TRIANGLE,"familiarity, grow distasteful; the time comes when all the arguments"
1411,THE TRIANGLE,"are finished, there is nothing more to be said on any subject, and"
1412,THE TRIANGLE,"boredom, without even the covering, apologetic hand, yawns and yawns"
1413,THE TRIANGLE,"and cannot be appeased. Thereupon two cease to be company, and even a"
1414,THE TRIANGLE,serpent would be greeted as a cheery and timely visitor. Dismal
1415,THE TRIANGLE,"indeed, and not infrequent, is that time, and the vista therefrom is a"
1416,THE TRIANGLE,"long, dull yawn stretching to the horizon and the grave. If at any"
1417,THE TRIANGLE,"time we do revalue the values, let us write it down that the person who"
1418,THE TRIANGLE,"makes us yawn is a criminal knave, and then we will abolish matrimony"
1419,THE TRIANGLE,and read Plato again.
1420,THE TRIANGLE,
1421,THE TRIANGLE,The serpent arrived one morning hard on Mrs. Morrissy's pathetic
1422,THE TRIANGLE,"pressure. It had three large trunks, a toy terrier, and a volume of"
1423,THE TRIANGLE,"verse. The trunks contained dresses, the dog insects, and the book"
1424,THE TRIANGLE,emotion--a sufficiently enlivening trilogy! Miss Sarah O'Malley wore
1425,THE TRIANGLE,"the dresses in exuberant rotation, Mr. Morrissy read the emotional"
1426,THE TRIANGLE,"poetry with great admiration, Mrs. Morrissy made friends with the dog,"
1427,THE TRIANGLE,and life at once became complex and joyful.
1428,THE TRIANGLE,
1429,THE TRIANGLE,"Mr. Morrissy, exhilarated by the emotional poetry, drew, with an"
1430,THE TRIANGLE,"instinct too human to be censured, more and more in the direction of"
1431,THE TRIANGLE,"his wife's cousin, and that lady, having a liking for comedy, observed"
1432,THE TRIANGLE,the agile posturings of the gentleman on a verbal summit up and down
1433,THE TRIANGLE,and around which he flung himself with equal dexterity and
1434,THE TRIANGLE,"satisfaction--crudely, he made puns--and the two were further thrown"
1435,THE TRIANGLE,"together by the enforced absences of Mrs. Morrissy, into a privacy more"
1436,THE TRIANGLE,"than sealed, by reason of the attentions of a dog who would climb to"
1437,THE TRIANGLE,"her lap, and there, with an angry nose, put to no more than temporary"
1438,THE TRIANGLE,rout the nimble guests of his jacket. Shortly Mrs. Morrissy began to
1439,THE TRIANGLE,look upon the toy terrier with a meditative eye.
1440,THE TRIANGLE,
1441,THE TRIANGLE,"It was from one of these, now periodical, retreats that Mrs. Morrissy"
1442,THE TRIANGLE,"first observed the rapt attitude of her husband, and, instantly, life"
1443,THE TRIANGLE,"for her became bounding, plentiful, and engrossing."
1444,THE TRIANGLE,
1445,THE TRIANGLE,There is no satisfaction in owning that which nobody else covets. Our
1446,THE TRIANGLE,"silver is no more than second-hand, tarnished metal until some one else"
1447,THE TRIANGLE,speaks of it in terms of envy. Our husbands are barely tolerable until
1448,THE TRIANGLE,a lady friend has endeavoured to abstract their cloying attentions.
1449,THE TRIANGLE,"Then only do we comprehend that our possessions are unique, beautiful,"
1450,THE TRIANGLE,well worth guarding.
1451,THE TRIANGLE,
1452,THE TRIANGLE,Nobody has yet pointed out that there is an eighth sense; and yet the
1453,THE TRIANGLE,sense of property is more valuable and more detestable than all the
1454,THE TRIANGLE,others in combination. The person who owns something is civilised. It
1455,THE TRIANGLE,"is man's escape from wolf and monkeydom. It is individuality at last,"
1456,THE TRIANGLE,"or the promise of it, while those other ownerless people must remain"
1457,THE TRIANGLE,"either beasts of prey or beasts of burden, grinning with ineffective"
1458,THE TRIANGLE,"teeth, or bowing stupid heads for their masters' loads, and all begging"
1459,THE TRIANGLE,humbly for last straws and getting them.
1460,THE TRIANGLE,
1461,THE TRIANGLE,Under a sufficiently equable exterior Mrs. Morrissy's blood was pulsing
1462,THE TRIANGLE,with greater activity than had ever moved it before. It raced! It
1463,THE TRIANGLE,"flew! At times the tide of it thudded to her head, boomed in her ears,"
1464,THE TRIANGLE,surged in fierce waves against her eyes. Her brain moved with a
1465,THE TRIANGLE,complexity which would have surprised her had she been capable of
1466,THE TRIANGLE,remarking upon it. Plot and counterplot! She wove webs horrid as a
1467,THE TRIANGLE,"spider's. She became, without knowing it, a mistress of psychology."
1468,THE TRIANGLE,She dissected motions and motives. She builded theories precariously
1469,THE TRIANGLE,"upon an eyelash. She pondered and weighed the turning of a head, the"
1470,THE TRIANGLE,"handing of a sugar-bowl. She read treason in a laugh, assignations in"
1471,THE TRIANGLE,"a song, villainy in a new dress. Deeper and darker things! Profound"
1472,THE TRIANGLE,and vicious depths plunging stark to where the devil lodged in
1473,THE TRIANGLE,darknesses too dusky for registration! She looked so steadily on these
1474,THE TRIANGLE,gulfs and murks that at last she could see anything she wished to see;
1475,THE TRIANGLE,"and always, when times were critical, when this and that, abominations"
1476,THE TRIANGLE,"indescribable, were separate by no more than a pin's point, she must"
1477,THE TRIANGLE,retire from her watch (alas for a too-sensitive nature!) to chase the
1478,THE TRIANGLE,"enemies of a dog upon which, more than ever, she fixed a meditative eye."
1479,THE TRIANGLE,
1480,THE TRIANGLE,To get that woman out of the house became a pressing necessity. Her
1481,THE TRIANGLE,cousin carried with her a baleful atmosphere. She moved cloudy with
1482,THE TRIANGLE,"doubt. There was a diabolic aura about her face, and her hair was red!"
1483,THE TRIANGLE,These things were patent. Was one blind or a fool? A straw will
1484,THE TRIANGLE,"reveal the wind, so will an eyelash, a smile, the carriage of a dress."
1485,THE TRIANGLE,Ankles also! One saw too much of them. Let it be said then. Teeth
1486,THE TRIANGLE,and neck were bared too often and too broadly. If modesty was indeed
1487,THE TRIANGLE,"more than a name, then here it was outraged. Shame too! was it only a"
1488,THE TRIANGLE,word? Does one do this and that without even a blush? Even vice
1489,THE TRIANGLE,"should have its good manners, its own decent retirements. If there is"
1490,THE TRIANGLE,nothing else let there be breeding! But at this thing the world might
1491,THE TRIANGLE,look and understand and censure if it were not brass-browed and stupid.
1492,THE TRIANGLE,"Sneak! Traitress! Serpent! Oh, Serpent! do you slip into our very"
1493,THE TRIANGLE,"Eden? looping your sly coils across our flowers, trailing over our beds"
1494,THE TRIANGLE,"of narcissus and our budding rose, crawling into our secret arbours and"
1495,THE TRIANGLE,whispering-places and nests of happiness! Do you flaunt and sway your
1496,THE TRIANGLE,"crested head with a new hat on it every day? Oh, that my Aunt were"
1497,THE TRIANGLE,"here, with the dragon's teeth, and the red breath, and whiskers to"
1498,THE TRIANGLE,match! Here Mrs. Morrissy jumped as if she had been bitten (as indeed
1499,THE TRIANGLE,"she had been) and retired precipitately, eyeing the small dog that"
1500,THE TRIANGLE,frisked about her with an eye almost petrified with meditation.
1501,THE TRIANGLE,
1502,THE TRIANGLE,To get that woman out of the house quickly and without scandal. Not to
1503,THE TRIANGLE,"let her know for a moment, for the blink and twitter of an eyelid, of"
1504,THE TRIANGLE,"her triumph. To eject her with ignominy, retaining one's own dignity"
1505,THE TRIANGLE,in the meantime. Never to let her dream of an uneasiness that might
1506,THE TRIANGLE,"have screamed, an anger that could have bitten and scratched and been"
1507,THE TRIANGLE,happy in the primitive exercise. Was such a task beyond her adequacy?
1508,THE TRIANGLE,
1509,THE TRIANGLE,"Below in the garden the late sun slanted upon her husband, as with"
1510,THE TRIANGLE,"declamatory hands and intense brows he chanted emotional poetry, ready"
1511,THE TRIANGLE,himself on the slope of opportunity to roll into verses from his own
1512,THE TRIANGLE,"resources. He criticised, with agile misconception, the inner meaning,"
1513,THE TRIANGLE,"the involved, hard-hidden heart of the poet; and the serpent sat before"
1514,THE TRIANGLE,"him and nodded. She smiled enchantments at him, and allurements, and"
1515,THE TRIANGLE,"subtle, subtle disagreements. On the grass at their feet the toy"
1516,THE TRIANGLE,terrier bounded from his slumbers and curved an imperative and furious
1517,THE TRIANGLE,hind-leg in the direction of his ear.
1518,THE TRIANGLE,
1519,THE TRIANGLE,"Mrs. Morrissy called the dog, and it followed her into the house,"
1520,THE TRIANGLE,"frisking joyously. From the kitchen she procured a small basket, and"
1521,THE TRIANGLE,into this she packed some old cloths and pieces of biscuit. Then she
1522,THE TRIANGLE,"picked up the terrier, cuffed it on both sides of the head, popped it"
1523,THE TRIANGLE,"into the basket, tucked its humbly-agitated tail under its abject ribs,"
1524,THE TRIANGLE,"closed the basket, and fastened it with a skewer. She next addressed a"
1525,THE TRIANGLE,"label to her cousin's home, tied it to the basket, and despatched a"
1526,THE TRIANGLE,"servant with it to the railway-station, instructing her that it should"
1527,THE TRIANGLE,be paid for on delivery.
1528,THE TRIANGLE,
1529,THE TRIANGLE,At breakfast the following morning her cousin wondered audibly why her
1530,THE TRIANGLE,"little, weeny, tiny pet was not coming for its brecky."
1531,THE TRIANGLE,
1532,THE TRIANGLE,"Mrs. Morrissy, with a smile of infinite sweetness, suggested that Miss"
1533,THE TRIANGLE,"O'Malley's father would surely feed the brute when it arrived. ""It was"
1534,THE TRIANGLE,"a filthy little beast,"" said she brightly; and she pushed the"
1535,THE TRIANGLE,toast-rack closer to her husband.
1536,THE TRIANGLE,
1537,THE TRIANGLE,"There followed a silence which drowsed and buzzed to eternity, and"
1538,THE TRIANGLE,during which Mr. Morrissy's curled moustaches straightened and grew
1539,THE TRIANGLE,limp and drooped. An edge of ice stiffened around Miss O'Malley.
1540,THE TRIANGLE,"Incredulity, frozen and wan, thawed into swift comprehension and"
1541,THE TRIANGLE,"dismay, lit a flame in her cheeks, throbbed burningly at the lobes of"
1542,THE TRIANGLE,"her ears, spread magnetic and prickling over her whole stung body, and"
1543,THE TRIANGLE,ebbed and froze again to immobility. She opposed her cousin's kind
1544,THE TRIANGLE,eyes with a stony brow.
1545,THE TRIANGLE,
1546,THE TRIANGLE,"""I think,"" said she rising, ""that I had better see to my packing."""
1547,THE TRIANGLE,
1548,THE TRIANGLE,"""Must you go?"" said Mrs. Morrissy, with courteous unconcern, and she"
1549,THE TRIANGLE,helped herself to cream. Her husband glared insanely at a pat of
1550,THE TRIANGLE,"butter, and tried to look like some one who was somewhere else."
1551,THE TRIANGLE,
1552,THE TRIANGLE,Miss O'Malley closed the door behind her with extreme gentleness.
1553,THE TRIANGLE,
1554,THE TRIANGLE,So the matter lay. But the position was unchanged. For a little time
1555,THE TRIANGLE,"peace would reign in that household, but the same driving necessity"
1556,THE TRIANGLE,"remained, and before long another, and perhaps more virulent, serpent"
1557,THE TRIANGLE,would have to be requisitioned for the assuagement of those urgent
1558,THE TRIANGLE,woes. A man's moustaches will arise with the sun; not Joshua could
1559,THE TRIANGLE,constrain them to the pillow after the lark had sung reveille. A woman
1560,THE TRIANGLE,will sit pitilessly at the breakfast table however the male eye may
1561,THE TRIANGLE,shift and quail. It is the business and the art of life to degrade
1562,THE TRIANGLE,"permanencies. Fluidity is existence, there is no other, and for ever"
1563,THE TRIANGLE,the chief attraction of Paradise must be that there is a serpent in it
1564,THE TRIANGLE,to keep it lively and wholesome. Lacking the serpent we are no longer
1565,THE TRIANGLE,"in Paradise, we are at home, and our sole entertainment is to yawn when"
1566,THE TRIANGLE,we wish to.

1596,I,"slow regularity his hammer swung up and down, cracking a stone into"
1597,I,small pieces at each descent. But his heart was not in the work. He
1598,I,hit whatever stone chanced to be nearest. There was no cunning
1599,I,"selection in his hammer, nor any of these oddities of stroke which a"
1600,I,curious and interested worker would have essayed for the mere trial of

1603,I,"He was not difficult to become acquainted with, and, after a little"

1606,I,"said. Everything that people had done to him was wrong, that he"
1607,I,"affirmed; nor had he any hope that matters would mend, for life was"
1608,I,poisoned at the fountain-head and there was no justice anywhere.
1609,I,Justice! he raised his eyebrows with the horrid stare of a man who
1610,I,searches for apparitions; he lowered them again to the bored blink of
1611,I,one who will not believe in apparitions even though he see them--there
1612,I,"was not even fairness! Perhaps (and his bearing was mildly tolerant),"
1613,I,"perhaps some people believed there was fairness, but he had his share"
1614,I,"of days to count by and remember. Forty-nine years of here and there,"
1615,I,"and in and out, and up and down; walking all kinds of roads in all"

1629,I,"""How could you be happy if you have not got what you want?"" and he"
1630,I,thumped solidly with his hammer.
1631,I,

1633,I,

1671,I,
1672,I,"""A person wants respect from other people.--If he doesn't get that,"

1686,I,and so I'll tell you what is in my mind.--A person that has neighbours
1687,I,"will have either friends or enemies, and it's likely enough that he'll"
1688,I,have the last unless he has a meek spirit. And it's the same way with
1689,I,"a man that's married, or a man that has a brother. For the neighbours"
1690,I,"will spy on you from dawn to dark, and talk about you in every place,"

1698,I,"""These are three things a man doesn't like--he doesn't like to be spied"
1699,I,"on, and he doesn't like to be ruled and regulated, and he doesn't like"
1700,I,"to be asked for a thing he wants himself. And, whether he lets himself"
1701,I,"be spied on or not, he'll be talked about, and in any case he'll be"
1702,I,made out to be a queer man; and if he lets his wife rule him he'll be
1703,I,"scorned and laughed at, and if he doesn't let her rule him he'll be"
1704,I,called a rough man; and if he once gives to his brother he will have to

1729,I,
1730,I,"""If you went to a ditch for your wife----!"" said I."

1733,I,
1734,I,"""I think,"" said I, ""that you need not mind the neighbours so very much"
1735,I,for no one can spy on you but yourself. If your mind was in a glass
1736,I,case instead of in a head it would be different; and no one can really

1744,I,He wrinkled up his eyes and looked at me very steadily--
1745,I,
1746,I,"""I'll be saying good-bye to you, young man,"" said he, and he raised his"
1747,I,hammer again and began to beat solemnly on the stones.
1748,I,
1749,I,"I stood by him for a few minutes, but as he neither spoke nor looked at"
1750,I,me again I turned to my own path intending to strike Dublin by the Paps

1756,II,"One day he chucked his job, put up his tools, told the boss he could do"
1757,II,"this and that, called hurroo to the boys, and sauntered out of the place"
1758,II,with a great deal of dignity and one week's wages in cash.
1759,II,
1760,II,"There were many reasons why he should not have quitted his work, not the"
1761,II,lightest of them being that the food of a wife and family depended on his
1762,II,"sticking to it, but a person who has a temper cannot be expected to have"
1763,II,everything else.
1764,II,
1765,II,Nothing makes a man feel better than telling his employer that he and his
1766,II,"job can go bark at one another. It is the dream of a great many people,"
1767,II,and were it not for the glamour of that idea most folk would commit
1768,II,"suicide through sheer disgust. Getting the ""sack"" is an experience which"
1769,II,wearies after the first time. Giving the sack is a felicity granted only
1770,II,to a few people. To go home to one's wife with the information that you
1771,II,"have been discharged is an adventure which one does not wish to repeat,"
1772,II,but to go home and hand her thirty shillings with the statement that you
1773,II,have discharged yourself is not one of the pleasantest ways of passing
1774,II,time.
1775,II,
1776,II,"His wife's habits were as uncertain as her temper, but not as bad. She"
1777,II,"had a hot tongue, a red head, a quick fist and a big family--ingredients"
1778,II,to compose a peppery dish. They had been only a short time married when
1779,II,she gave her husband to understand that there was to be only one head of
1780,II,"that household, and that would not be he. He fought fiercely for a"
1781,II,position on the executive but he did not get it. His voice in the
1782,II,"household economy, which had commenced with the lordly ""Let this be"
1783,II,"done,"" concluded in the timidly blustering ""All right, have it your own"
1784,II,"way."""
1785,II,
1786,II,"Furthermore, the theory that a woman is helpmate to a man was repugnant"
1787,II,"to her. She believed and asserted that a man had to be managed, and she"
1788,II,had several maxims to which she often gave forcible and contemptuous
1789,II,utterance--
1790,II,
1791,II,"""Let a man go his own road to-day and he will be shaking hands with the"

1803,II,
1804,II,But while advocating peace at any price and a tax on muscles that were
1805,II,bigger than a fly's knuckle she was herself a warrior of the breed of
1806,II,Finn and strong enough to scare a pugilist. When she was angry her
1807,II,"family got over the garden wall, her husband first. She did not think"
1808,II,"very much of him, and she told him so, but he was sufficient of a man not"
1809,II,to believe her.
1810,II,
1811,II,"For a long time he had been a dissatisfied person, leading a grumpy"
1812,II,existence which was only made bearable by gusts of solitary blasphemy.
1813,II,"When a man curses openly he is healthy enough, but when he takes to"

1824,II,"eaten off the floor. She was a big comely woman, but at the moment she"
1825,II,did not look dainty. A long wisp of red hair came looping down on her
1826,II,"shoulders. A smear of soot toned down the roses of her cheek, her arms"
1827,II,"were smothered in soap suds, and the fact that she was wearing a pair of"
1828,II,her husband's boots added nothing to her attractions.
1829,II,
1830,II,When she saw her husband standing in the doorway at this unaccustomed

1838,II,"""I'm not walking on the soap with my head,"" he retorted, ""if I was I'd"
1839,II,"see it, and if it wasn't on the floor it wouldn't be tripping folk up. A"
1840,II,nice thing it is that a man can't come into his own house without being
1841,II,"set slipping and sliding like an acrobat on an iceberg."""
1842,II,
1843,II,"""And,"" cried his wife, ""if I kept the soap locked up it's the nice, clean"
1844,II,house you'd have to come into. Not that you'd mind if the place was
1845,II,"dirty, I'll say that much for you, for what one is reared to one likes,"
1846,II,and what is natural is pleasant. But I got a different rearing let me
1847,II,"tell you, and while I'm in it I'll have the clean house no matter who"
1848,II,"wants the dirty one."""
1849,II,
1850,II,"""You will so,"" said he, looking at the soapy water for a place to walk on."
1851,II,
1852,II,"""Can't you be coming in then, and not stand there framed in the doorway,"
1853,II,"gawking like a fool at a miracle."""
1854,II,
1855,II,"""I'll sail across if you'll get a canal boat or a raft,"" said he, ""or, if"
1856,II,"the children are kept out of sight, I'll strip, ma'm, and swim for it."""
1857,II,
1858,II,His wife regarded him with steady gloom.
1859,II,
1860,II,"""If you took the smallest interest in your home,"" said she, ""and were"
1861,II,"less set on gallivanting about the country, going to the Lord knows"
1862,II,"where, with the Lord knows who, you'd know that the children were away in"
1863,II,school at this hour. Nice indeed the places you visit and the company
1864,II,"you keep, if the truth were known--walk across it, man, and wipe your"
1865,II,"feet on the kitchen mat."""
1866,II,
1867,II,"So he walked into the kitchen, and sat down, and, as he sat, the last"
1868,II,remnants of his courage trembled down into his boots and evaporated.
1869,II,
1870,II,His wife came in after him--she drooped a speculative eye on her lord--
1871,II,
1872,II,"""You didn't say what brought you home so early,"" said she."
1873,II,
1874,II,When a hard thing has to be done the quickest way is generally the best
1875,II,"way. It is like the morning bath--don't ruminate, jump in, for the"
1876,II,"longer you wait the more dubious you get, and the tub begins to look"
1877,II,arctic and repellent.
1878,II,
1879,II,Some such philosophy as this dictated his attitude. He lugged out his
1880,II,"week's wages, slapped it on the table, and said--"
1881,II,
1882,II,"""I've got the sack."""
1883,II,
1884,II,"Then he stretched his legs out, pushed his fists deep into his trouser"
1885,II,"pockets, and waited."
1886,II,
1887,II,"His wife sat down too, slowly and with great care, and she stared in"
1888,II,silence at her husband--
1889,II,
1890,II,"""Do you tell me you have lost your employment?"" said she in a quiet voice."
1891,II,
1892,II,"""I do, then,"" said he. ""I chucked it myself. I told old Whiskers that"
1893,II,he could go and boil his job and his head together and sell the soup for
1894,II,"cat-lap."""
1895,II,
1896,II,"""You threw up your situation yourself."""
1897,II,
1898,II,"""You've got the truth of it, ma'm,"" he rejoined."
1899,II,
1900,II,"""Maybe you'd be telling me what you did the like of that for?"""
1901,II,
1902,II,"""Because,"" said he, ""I'm a man and not a mouse. Because I don't want to"
1903,II,be at the beck and call of every dog and devil that has a bit more money
1904,II,"than I have--a man has got to be a man sometimes,"" he growled."
1905,II,
1906,II,"""Sure, you're telling the truth,"" said his wife, nodding her head at him."
1907,II,"""A man should be a man sometimes. It's the pity of the world that he"
1908,II,"can't be a man always: and, indeed, it's the hard thing for a woman to"
1909,II,"tell herself that the man she has got isn't a man at all, but a big fool"
1910,II,"with no more wit than a boy."""
1911,II,
1912,II,Now this was the first time he had found his wife take trouble lying
1913,II,down. As a rule she was readier for a fight than he was. She jumped
1914,II,into a row with the alacrity of a dog: and the change worked on him. He
1915,II,"looked at her listless hands, and the sight of those powerful organs"
1916,II,hanging so powerlessly wrought on him. Women often forget that their
1917,II,weakness is really their strength. The weakest things in the world are
1918,II,by a queer paradox always the strongest. The toughest stone will wear
1919,II,"away under the dropping of water, a mushroom will lift a rock on its"
1920,II,"delicate head, a child will make its father work for it. So the too"
1921,II,"capable woman will always have a baby to nurse, and that baby will be her"
1922,II,husband. If she buttress her womanhood too much she saps his manhood.
1923,II,"Let her love all she can and never stint that blessing, but a woman"
1924,II,cannot often be obeyed and loved at the same time. A man cannot obey a
1925,II,woman constantly and retain his self-respect: the muscles of his arms
1926,II,"reproach him if he does, and the man with his self-respect gone is a man"
1927,II,"with a grudge, he will learn to hate the agent who brought him low. A"
1928,II,"day may come when he will rise and beat her in self-defence, with his"
1929,II,"fists if he is sufficiently brutalised, some subtler, but no less"
1930,II,"efficient, weapon if his manhood refuses to be degraded--and this was our"
1931,II,case. His wife had grabbed the reins and driven the matrimonial coach:
1932,II,"driven it well, that is true, but the driver, by right of precedent, had"
1933,II,"sat by hurt and angry, and at last, in an endeavour to prove his manhood"
1934,II,"among men, he had damned his employer's self and work, although in"
1935,II,reality all his fury was directed against the mother of his children. He
1936,II,"threw up his work, and the semi-conscious thought that went home with him"
1937,II,"was--""Now she will be sorry. If she must do everything let her earn the"
1938,II,"bread."""
1939,II,
1940,II,"The woman knew what poverty meant, and she had four young children. It"
1941,II,was the thought of these helpless ones crying with hunger (she could hear
1942,II,"them already, her ears were dinned with their hungry lamentation) that"
1943,II,"took the fibre out of her arms, and left her without any fight. She"
1944,II,could only sit and look with wretched eyes on the man whom she had been
1945,II,"demoralising, and, for the first time since he knew her, the tears came,"
1946,II,and the poor woman laid her head on the kitchen table and wept.
1947,II,
1948,II,"He was astonished, he was dismayed, but he could not stand her tears: he"
1949,II,ran to her--the first time he ever did run to her--
1950,II,
1951,II,"""Sure, darling,"" said he, ""is it crying you are? What would you be doing"
1952,II,that for? If I've lost one job I can get another. I'm not afraid of
1953,II,"work, and I know how to do it. I'll get something to do at once, if it's"
1954,II,"only wheeling a handcart, or selling cockles in public-houses. Wisha,"
1955,II,"dry your eyes--they're as pretty as they ever were,"" said he, trying to"
1956,II,"look at them, while his wife, with a strange shyness, would not let him"
1957,II,"see, for she felt that there was a strange man with her, some one she did"
1958,II,"not know. That was a man's hand on her shoulder, and she had never felt"
1959,II,"a man's hand before, as long as she was married."
1960,II,
1961,II,"""I'll go out at once,"" said he, ""and when I come in to-night I'll have a"
1962,II,"job if I have to bang it out of some one with a shovel."""
1963,II,
1964,II,"He slapped on his hat, kicked the soap out of the way, tramped through"
1965,II,"the water on the floor, and when at the door he turned again and came"
1966,II,"back to kiss his wife, a form of caress which had long fallen into"
1967,II,"desuetude, and so, out into the street, a man again."
1968,II,
1969,II,"When he had gone his wife returned to her scrubbing, and, as she worked"
1970,II,"she smiled at something she was remembering, and, now and again, a bit of"
1971,II,a song came from lips that had scolded so much. Having finished her work
1972,II,she spent nearly an hour at the looking-glass doing up her hair (grand
1973,II,"hair it was, too) with her ears listening for a footstep. Now and again"
1974,II,"she would run to the pot to see were the potatoes doing all right--""The"
1975,II,"children will be in shortly,"" said she, ""and hungry to the bone, poor"
1976,II,"dears."""
1977,II,
1978,II,But she was not thinking of the children. The warmth of a kiss was still
1979,II,"on her lips. Something in the back of her head was saying--""He will do"
1980,II,"it again when he comes in."""
1981,II,
1982,II,And the second honeymoon was pleasanter than the first.
1983,II,
1984,II,
1985,III,III
1986,III,
1987,III,"She was tall and angular. Her hair was red, and scarce, and untidy."
1988,III,Her hands were large and packed all over with knuckles and her feet
1989,III,"would have turned inwards at the toes, only that she was aware of and"
1990,III,corrected their perversities.
1991,III,
1992,III,"She was sitting all alone, and did not look up as I approached--"
1993,III,
1994,III,"""Tell me,"" said I, ""why you have sat for more than an hour with your"
1995,III,"eyes fixed on nothing, and your hands punching your lap?"""
1996,III,
1997,III,"She looked at me for a fleeting instant, and then, looking away again,"
1998,III,"she began to speak.--Her voice was pleasant enough, but it was so"
1999,III,strong that one fancied there were bones in it--
2000,III,
2001,III,"""I do not dislike women,"" said she, ""but I think they seldom speak of"
2002,III,"anything worth listening to, nor do they often do anything worth"

2004,III,
2005,III,"""But,"" said I, ""you have not explained why you thump your lap with your"
2006,III,"fist?"""
2007,III,
2008,III,She proceeded--
2009,III,
2010,III,"""I do not hate women, nor do I love men. It was only that I did not"
2011,III,"take much notice of the one, and that I liked being with the other,"
2012,III,"for, as things are, there is very little life for a person except in"
2013,III,thinking. All our actions are so cumbered by laws and customs that we
2014,III,cannot take a step beyond the ordinary without finding ourselves either
2015,III,"in gaol or in Coventry."""
2016,III,
2017,III,"Having said this, she raised her bleak head and stared like an eagle"
2018,III,across the wastes.
2019,III,
2020,III,"After I had coughed twice I touched her arm, and said--"
2021,III,
2022,III,"""Yes?"""
2023,III,
2024,III,"""One must live,"" said she quickly. ""I do not mean that we must eat and"
2025,III,"sleep--these mechanical matters are settled for many of us, but life"
2026,III,"consists in thinking, and nothing else, yet many people go from the"
2027,III,cradle to the grave without having lived differently from animals. I
2028,III,do not want to be one of them. Their whole theory of life is
2029,III,mechanical. They eat and drink. They invite each other to their
2030,III,"houses to eat and drink, and they use such speech as they are gifted"
2031,III,with in discussing their food and whatever other palpable occurrence
2032,III,"may have chanced to them in the day. It is a step, perhaps, towards"
2033,III,"living, but it is still only one step removed from stagnation. They"
2034,III,"have some interest in an occurrence, but how that occurrence happened,"
2035,III,"and what will result from it does not exercise them in the least, and"
2036,III,"these, which are knowledge and prophecy, are the only interesting"
2037,III,"aspects of any event."""
2038,III,
2039,III,"""But,"" said I, ""you have not told me why you sit for a full hour"
2040,III,"staring at vacancy, and thumping on your knee with your hand?"""
2041,III,
2042,III,She continued--.
2043,III,
2044,III,"""Sometimes one meets certain people who have sufficient of the divine"
2045,III,ferment in their heads to be called alive: they are almost always men.
2046,III,We fly to them as to our own people. We abase ourselves before them in
2047,III,happy humility. We crave to be allowed to live near them in order that
2048,III,we may be assured that everything in the world is not nonsense and
2049,III,"machinery--and then, what do we find--?"""
2050,III,
2051,III,"She paused, and turned a large fierce eye upon me."
2052,III,
2053,III,"""I do not know,"" said I, and I endeavoured vainly to look everywhere"
2054,III,but at her eye.
2055,III,
2056,III,"""We find always that they are married,"" said she, and, saying so, she"
2057,III,lapsed again to a tense and worried reflection.
2058,III,
2059,III,"""You have not told me,"" I insisted gently, ""why you peer earnestly into"
2060,III,"space, and thump at intervals upon your knee with the heel of your"
2061,III,"fist?"""
2062,III,
2063,III,"""These men,"" said she sternly, ""are surrounded by their wives. They"
2064,III,are in gaol and their wives are their warders. You cannot go to them
2065,III,without a permit. You may not speak to them without a listener. You
2066,III,may not argue with them for fear of raising an alien and ridiculous
2067,III,hostility. Scarcely can you even look at them without reproach.--How
2068,III,"then can we live, and how will the torch of life be kept alight?"""
2069,III,
2070,III,"""I do not know,"" I murmured."
2071,III,
2072,III,She turned her pale eye to me again.
2073,III,
2074,III,"""I am not beautiful,"" said she."
2075,III,
2076,III,"But there was just a tremor of doubt in her voice, so that the apparent"
2077,III,"statement became packed with curiosity, and had all the quality of a"
2078,III,question.
2079,III,
2080,III,I did not shrug my shoulder nor raise an eyebrow--
2081,III,
2082,III,"""You are very nice,"" I replied."
2083,III,
2084,III,"""I do not want to be beautiful,"" she continued severely. ""Why should"
2085,III,"I? I have no interest in such things. I am interested only in living,"
2086,III,and living is thinking; but I demand access to my fellows who are
2087,III,"alive. Perhaps, I did not pay those others enough attention. How"
2088,III,could I? They cannot think. They cannot speak. They make a
2089,III,"complicated verbal noise, but all I am able to translate from it is,"
2090,III,that a something called lip-salve can be bought in some particular shop
2091,III,one penny cheaper than it can in a certain other shop. They will
2092,III,twitter for hours about the way a piece of ribbon was stitched to a hat
2093,III,which they saw in a tramcar. They agitate themselves wondering whether
2094,III,"a muff should be this size or that size?--I say, they depress me, and"
2095,III,if I do turn my back on them when men are present I am only acting
2096,III,sensibly and justly. Why cannot they twitter to each other and let me
2097,III,"and other people alone?"""
2098,III,
2099,III,She turned to me again--
2100,III,
2101,III,"""I do not know,"" said I meekly."
2102,III,
2103,III,"""And,"" she continued, ""the power they have; the amazing power they have"
2104,III,"to annoy other folk. All kinds of sly impertinences, vulgar evasions,"
2105,III,and sneering misunderstandings. Why should such women be allowed to
2106,III,"take men into their captivity, to sequester, and gag, and restrain them"
2107,III,from those whom they would naturally be eager to meet?
2108,III,
2109,III,"""What,"" she continued fiercely, ""had my hat to do with that woman, or"

2111,III,
2112,III,"I nodded slowly and grievously, and repeated--"

2114,III,"""What indeed?"""
2115,III,
2116,III,"""A hat,"" said she, ""is something to cover one's head from the rain, and"
2117,III,a frock is something to guard one's limbs from inclement weather.--To
2118,III,that extent I am interested in these things: but they would put a hat
2119,III,"on my mind, and a black cloth on my understanding."""
2120,III,
2121,III,"We sat in silence for a little time, while she surveyed the bleak"
2122,III,horizon as an eagle might.
2123,III,
2124,III,"""And when I call at their houses,"" said she, ""their servants say 'Not"
2125,III,"at home,' a lie, you know, and they close their doors on me."""
2126,III,
2127,III,She was silent again--
2128,III,
2129,III,"""I do not know what to do,"" said she."
2130,III,
2131,III,"""Is that,"" said I, ""the reason why you beat your lap with your hand,"
2132,III,"and stare abroad like a famished eagle?"""
2133,III,
2134,III,She turned quickly to me--
2135,III,
2136,III,"""What shall I do to open those doors?"" said she."
2137,III,
2138,III,"""If I happened to be you,"" I replied, ""I would cut off my hair, I'd buy"
2139,III,"a man's clothes and wear them always, I'd call myself Harry or Tom; and"
2140,III,"then I'd go wherever I pleased, and meet whoever I wanted to meet?"""
2141,III,
2142,III,"She stared fixedly at herself in these garments, and under these"

2144,III,
2145,III,"""They would know I was not a man,"" said she gravely."
2146,III,
2147,III,I looked at her figure--
2148,III,
2149,III,"""No person in the world would ever guess it,"" said I."
2150,III,
2151,III,She arose from her seat. She clutched her reticule to her breast--

2160,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"When Brien O'Brien died, people said that it did not matter very much,"
2161,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,because he would have died young in any case. He would have been
2162,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"hanged, or his head would have been split in two halves with a hatchet,"
2163,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,or he would have tumbled down the cliff when he was drunk and been
2164,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"smashed into jelly. Something like that was due to him, and everybody"
2165,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,likes to see a man get what he deserves to get.
2166,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2167,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"But, as ethical writs cease to run when a man is dead, the neighbours"
2168,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"did not stay away from his wake. They came, and they said many"
2169,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,mitigating things across the body with the bandaged jaws and the sly
2170,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"grin, and they reminded each other of this and that queer thing which"
2171,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"he had done, for his memory was crusted over with stories of wild,"
2172,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"laughable things, and other things which were wild but not laughable."
2173,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2174,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Meanwhile, he was dead, and one was at liberty to be a trifle sorry for"
2175,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"him. Further, he belonged to the O'Brien nation, a stock to whom"
2176,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,reverence was due. A stock not easily forgotten. The historic memory
2177,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"could reconstruct forgotten glories of station and battle, of terrible"
2178,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"villainy and terrible saintliness, the pitiful, valorous, slow descent"
2179,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,to the degradation which was not yet wholly victorious. A great stock!
2180,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,The O'Neills remembered it. The O'Tools and the MacSweeneys had
2181,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,stories by the hundred of love and hate. The Burkes and the Geraldines
2182,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,and the new strangers had memories also.
2183,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2184,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"His family was left in the poorest way, but they were used to that, for"
2185,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"he had kept them as poor as he left them, or found them, for that"
2186,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,matter. They had shaken hands with Charity so often that they no
2187,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"longer disliked the sallow-faced lady, and, so, certain small gifts"
2188,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"made by the neighbours were accepted, not very thankfully, but very"
2189,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,readily. These gifts were almost always in kind. A few eggs. A bag
2190,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,of potatoes. A handful of meal. A couple of twists of tea--such like.
2191,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2192,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"One of the visitors, however, moved by an extraordinary dejection,"
2193,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,slipped a silver threepenny-piece into the hand of Brien's little

2195,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,for it back again.
2196,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2197,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Little Sheila had been well trained by her father. She knew exactly

2199,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,tip-toed to the coffin and slipped the threepenny-piece into Brien's
2200,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"hand. That hand had never refused money when it was alive, it did not"
2201,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,reject it either when it was dead.

2207,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,what was due to him. He was removed protesting and struggling to the
2208,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,place decreed.
2209,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2210,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Down,"" said Rhadamanthus, pointing with his great hand, and down he"
2211,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,went.
2212,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2213,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"In the struggle he dropped the threepenny-piece, but he was so bustled"
2214,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"and heated that he did not observe his loss. He went down, far down,"
2215,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"out of sight, out of remembrance, to a howling, black gulf with others"
2216,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,of his unseen kind.
2217,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2218,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"A young seraph, named Cuchulain, chancing to pass that way shortly"
2219,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"afterwards, saw the threepenny-piece peeping brightly from the rocks,"
2220,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,and he picked it up.
2221,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2222,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"He looked at it in astonishment. He turned it over and over, this way"
2223,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"and that way. Examined it at the stretch of his arm, and peered"
2224,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,minutely at it from two inches distance--
2225,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2226,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I have never in my life seen anything so beautifully wrought,"" said"
2227,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"he, and, having stowed it in his pouch along with some other trinkets,"
2228,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,he strolled homewards again through the massy gates.
2229,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2230,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"It was not long until Brien discovered his loss, and, suddenly, through"
2231,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the black region, his voice went mounting and brawling."
2232,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2233,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I have been robbed,"" he yelled. ""I have been robbed in heaven!"""
2234,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2235,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Having begun to yell he did not stop. Sometimes he was simply angry
2236,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,and made a noise. Sometimes he became sarcastic and would send his
2237,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,query swirling upwards--
2238,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2239,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Who stole the threepenny-bit?"" he roared. He addressed the"
2240,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,surrounding black space--
2241,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2242,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Who stole the last threepenny-bit of a poor man?"""
2243,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2244,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Again and again his voice pealed upwards. The pains of his habitation
2245,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,lost all their sting for him. His mind had nourishment and the heat
2246,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"within him vanquished the fumes without. He had a grievance, a"
2247,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"righteous cause, he was buoyed and strengthened, nothing could silence"
2248,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"him. They tried ingenious devices, all kinds of complicated things,"
2249,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"but he paid no heed, and the tormentors were in despair."
2250,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2251,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I hate these sinners from the kingdom of Kerry,"" said the Chief"
2252,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Tormentor, and he sat moodily down on his own circular saw; and that"
2253,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"worried him also, for he was clad only in a loin cloth."
2254,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2255,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I hate the entire Clan of the Gael,"" said he; ""why cannot they send"
2256,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"them somewhere else?"" and then he started practising again on Brien."
2257,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2258,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,It was no use. Brien's query still blared upwards like the sound of
2259,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the great trump itself. It wakened and rung the rocky caverns,"
2260,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"screamed through fissure and funnel, and was battered and slung from"
2261,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,pinnacle to crag and up again. Worse! his companions in doom became
2262,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"interested and took up the cry, until at last the uproar became so"
2263,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,appalling that the Master himself could not stand it.
2264,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2265,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I have not had a wink of sleep for three nights,"" said that harassed"
2266,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"one, and he sent a special embassy to the powers."
2267,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2268,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Rhadamanthus was astonished when they arrived. His elbow was leaning
2269,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"on his vast knee, and his heavy head rested on a hand that was acres"
2270,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"long, acres wide."
2271,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2272,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""What is all this about?"" said he."
2273,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2274,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""The Master cannot go to sleep,"" said the spokesman of the embassy, and"
2275,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"he grinned as he said it, for it sounded queer even to himself."
2276,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2277,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It is not necessary that he should sleep,"" said Rhadamanthus. ""I have"
2278,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"never slept since time began, and I will never sleep until time is"
2279,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"over. But the complaint is curious. What has troubled your master?"""
2280,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2281,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Hell is turned upside down and inside out,"" said the fiend. ""The"
2282,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,tormentors are weeping like little children. The principalities are
2283,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,squatting on their hunkers doing nothing. The orders are running here
2284,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,and there fighting each other. The styles are leaning against walls
2285,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"shrugging their shoulders, and the damned are shouting and laughing and"
2286,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"have become callous to torment."""
2287,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2288,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It is not my business,"" said the judge."
2289,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2290,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""The sinners demand justice,"" said the spokesman."
2291,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2292,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""They've got it,"" said Rhadamanthus, ""let them stew in it."""
2293,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2294,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""They refuse to stew,"" replied the spokesman, wringing his hands."
2295,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2296,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Rhadamanthus sat up.
2297,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2298,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It is an axiom in law,"" said he, ""that however complicated an event"
2299,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"may be, there can never be more than one person at the extreme bottom"
2300,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"of it. Who is the person?"""
2301,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2302,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It is one Brien of the O'Brien nation, late of the kingdom of Kerry."
2303,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"A bad one! He got the maximum punishment a week ago."""
2304,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2305,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,For the first time in his life Rhadamanthus was disturbed. He
2306,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"scratched his head, and it was the first time he had ever done that"
2307,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,either.
2308,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2309,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""You say he got the maximum,"" said Rhadamanthus, ""then it's a fix! I"
2310,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"have damned him for ever, and better or worse than that cannot be done."
2311,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"It is none of my business,"" said he angrily, and he had the deputation"
2312,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,removed by force.
2313,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2314,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,But that did not ease the trouble. The contagion spread until ten
2315,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"million billions of voices were chanting in unison, and uncountable"
2316,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,multitudes were listening between their pangs.
2317,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2318,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Who stole the threepenny-bit? Who stole the threepenny-bit?"""
2319,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2320,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,That was still their cry. Heaven rang with it as well as hell. Space
2321,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,was filled with that rhythmic tumult. Chaos and empty Nox had a new
2322,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,discord added to their elemental throes. Another memorial was drafted
2323,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"below, showing that unless the missing coin was restored to its owner"
2324,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,hell would have to close its doors. There was a veiled menace in the
2325,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"memorial also, for Clause 6 hinted that if hell was allowed to go by"
2326,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,the board heaven might find itself in some jeopardy thereafter.
2327,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2328,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,The document was dispatched and considered. In consequence a
2329,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"proclamation was sent through all the wards of Paradise, calling on"
2330,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"whatever person, archangel, seraph, cherub, or acolyte had found a"
2331,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"threepenny-piece since midday of the tenth of August then instant, that"
2332,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the same person, archangel, seraph, cherub, or acolyte, should deliver"
2333,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the said threepenny-piece to Rhadamanthus at his Court, and should"
2334,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,receive in return a free pardon and a receipt.
2335,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2336,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"The coin was not delivered,"
2337,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2338,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"That young seraph, Cuchulain, walked about like a person who was"
2339,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"strange to himself. He was not tormented: he was angry. He frowned,"
2340,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,he cogitated and fumed. He drew one golden curl through his fingers
2341,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"until it was lank and drooping; save the end only, that was still a"
2342,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,ripple of gold. He put the end in his mouth and strode moodily chewing
2343,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,it. And every day his feet turned in the same direction--down the long
2344,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"entrance boulevard, through the mighty gates, along the strip of carved"
2345,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"slabs, to that piled wilderness where Rhadamanthus sat monumentally."
2346,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2347,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Here delicately he went, sometimes with a hand outstretched to help his"
2348,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"foothold, standing for a space to think ere he jumped to a further"
2349,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"rock, balancing himself for a moment ere he leaped again. So he would"
2350,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,come to stand and stare gloomily upon the judge.
2351,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2352,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"He would salute gravely, as was meet, and say, ""God bless the work"";"
2353,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"but Rhadamanthus never replied, save by a nod, for he was very busy."
2354,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2355,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Yet the judge did observe him, and would sometimes heave ponderous lids"
2356,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"to where he stood, and so, for a few seconds, they regarded each other"
2357,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,in an interval of that unceasing business.
2358,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2359,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Sometimes for a minute or two the young seraph Cuchulain would look
2360,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"from the judge to the judged as they crouched back or strained forward,"
2361,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the good and the bad all in the same tremble of fear, all unknowing"
2362,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,which way their doom might lead. They did not look at each other.
2363,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"They looked at the judge high on his ebon throne, and they could not"
2364,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"look away from him. There were those who knew, guessed clearly their"
2365,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"doom; abashed and flaccid they sat, quaking. There were some who were"
2366,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"uncertain--rabbit-eyed these, not less quaking than the others, biting"
2367,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"at their knuckles as they peeped upwards. There were those hopeful,"
2368,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"yet searching fearfully backwards in the wilderness of memory, chasing"
2369,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"and weighing their sins; and these last, even when their bliss was"
2370,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"sealed and their steps set on an easy path, went faltering, not daring"
2371,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"to look around again, their ears strained to catch a--""Halt, miscreant!"
2372,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"this other is your way!"""
2373,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2374,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"So, day by day, he went to stand near the judge; and one day"
2375,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Rhadamanthus, looking on him more intently, lifted his great hand and"
2376,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,pointed--
2377,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2378,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Go you among those to be judged,"" said he."
2379,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2380,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,For Rhadamanthus knew. It was his business to look deep into the heart
2381,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"and the mind, to fish for secrets in the pools of being."
2382,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2383,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"And the young seraph Cuchulain, still rolling his golden curl between"
2384,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"his lips, went obediently forward and set down his nodding plumes"
2385,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,between two who whimpered and stared and quaked.
2386,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2387,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"When his turn came, Rhadamanthus eyed him intently for a long time--"
2388,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2389,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Well!"" said Rhadamanthus."
2390,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2391,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,The young seraph Cuchulain blew the curl of gold away from his mouth--
2392,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2393,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Findings are keepings,"" said he loudly, and he closed his mouth and"
2394,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,stared very impertinently at the judge.
2395,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2396,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It is to be given up,"" said the judge."
2397,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2398,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Let them come and take it from me,"" said the seraph Cuchulain. And"
2399,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,suddenly (for these things are at the will of spirits) around his head
2400,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the lightnings span, and his hands were on the necks of thunders."
2401,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2402,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"For the second time in his life Rhadamanthus was disturbed, again he"
2403,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,scratched his head--
2404,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2405,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It's a fix,"" said he moodily. But in a moment he called to those"
2406,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,whose duty it was--
2407,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2408,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Take him to this side,"" he roared."
2409,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2410,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"And they advanced. But the seraph Cuchulain swung to meet them, and"
2411,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,his golden hair blazed and shrieked; and the thunders rolled at his
2412,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"feet, and about him a bright network that hissed and stung--and those"
2413,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,who advanced turned haltingly backwards and ran screaming.
2414,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2415,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""It's a fix,"" said Rhadamanthus; and for a little time he stared"
2416,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,menacingly at the seraph Cuchulain.
2417,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2418,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,But only for a little time. Suddenly he put his hands on the rests of
2419,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,his throne and heaved upwards his terrific bulk. Never before had
2420,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Rhadamanthus stood from his ordained chair. He strode mightily forward
2421,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,and in an instant had quelled that rebel. The thunders and lightnings
2422,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,were but moonbeams and dew on that stony carcass. He seized the seraph
2423,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Cuchulain, lifted him to his breast as one lifts a sparrow, and tramped"
2424,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,back with him--
2425,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2426,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Fetch me that other,"" said he, sternly, and he sat down."
2427,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2428,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Those whose duty it was sped swiftly downwards to find Brien of the
2429,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"O'Brien nation; and while they were gone, all in vain the seraph"
2430,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Cuchulain crushed flamy barbs against that bosom of doom. Now, indeed,"
2431,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,his golden locks were drooping and his plumes were broken and tossed;
2432,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,but his fierce eye still glared courageously against the nipple of
2433,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Rhadamanthus.
2434,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2435,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Soon they brought Brien. He was a sight of woe--howling, naked as a"
2436,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"tree in winter, black as a tarred wall, carved and gashed, tattered in"
2437,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"all but his throat, wherewith, until one's ears rebelled, he bawled his"
2438,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,one demand.
2439,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2440,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"But the sudden light struck him to a wondering silence, and the sight"
2441,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,of the judge holding the seraph Cuchulain like a limp flower to his
2442,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,breast held him gaping--
2443,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2444,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Bring him here,"" said Rhadamanthus."
2445,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2446,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,And they brought him to the steps of the throne--
2447,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2448,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""You have lost a medal!"" said Rhadamanthus. ""This one has it."""
2449,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2450,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Brien looked straitly at the seraph Cuchulain.
2451,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2452,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Rhadamanthus stood again, whirled his arm in an enormous arc, jerked,"
2453,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"and let go, and the seraph Cuchulain went swirling through space like a"
2454,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,slung stone--
2455,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2456,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Go after him, Kerryman,"" said Rhadamanthus, stooping; and he seized"
2457,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Brien by the leg, whirled him wide and out and far; dizzy, dizzy as a"
2458,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"swooping comet, and down, and down, and down."
2459,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2460,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Rhadamanthus seated himself. He motioned with his hand--
2461,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2462,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""Next,"" said he, coldly."
2463,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2464,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Down went the seraph Cuchulain, swirling in wide tumbles, scarcely"
2465,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"visible for quickness. Sometimes, with outstretched hands, he was a"
2466,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"cross that dropped plumb. Anon, head urgently downwards, he dived"
2467,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"steeply. Again, like a living hoop, head and heels together, he spun"
2468,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"giddily. Blind, deaf, dumb, breathless, mindless; and behind him Brien"
2469,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,of the O'Brien nation came pelting and whizzing.
2470,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2471,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,What of that journey! Who could give it words? Of the suns that
2472,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,appeared and disappeared like winking eyes. Comets that shone for an
2473,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"instant, went black and vanished. Moons that came, and stood, and were"
2474,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"gone. And around all, including all, boundless space, boundless"
2475,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"silence; the black, unmoving void--the deep, unending quietude, through"
2476,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"which they fell with Saturn and Orion, and mildly-smiling Venus, and"
2477,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"the fair, stark-naked moon and the decent earth wreathed in pearl and"
2478,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"blue. From afar she appeared, the quiet one, all lonely in the void."
2479,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,As sudden as a fair face in a crowded street. Beautiful as the sound
2480,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,of falling waters. Beautiful as the sound of music in a silence. Like
2481,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,a white sail on a windy sea. Like a green tree in a solitary place.
2482,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Chaste and wonderful she was. Flying afar. Flying aloft like a joyous
2483,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,bird when the morning breaks on the darkness and he shrills sweet
2484,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,tidings. She soared and sang. Gently she sang to timid pipes and
2485,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"flutes of tender straw and murmuring, distant strings. A song that"
2486,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"grew and swelled, gathering to a multitudinous, deep-thundered harmony,"
2487,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,until the over-burdened ear failed before the appalling uproar of her
2488,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"ecstasy, and denounced her. No longer a star! No longer a bird! A"
2489,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"plumed and horned fury! Gigantic, gigantic, leaping and shrieking"
2490,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"tempestuously, spouting whirlwinds of lightning, tearing gluttonously"
2491,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"along her path, avid, rampant, howling with rage and terror she leaped,"
2492,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,dreadfully she leaped and flew. . . .
2493,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2494,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"Enough! They hit the earth--they were not smashed, there was that"
2495,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,virtue in them. They hit the ground just outside the village of
2496,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,Donnybrook where the back road runs to the hills; and scarcely had they
2497,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,bumped twice when Brien of the O'Brien nation had the seraph Cuchulain
2498,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,by the throat--
2499,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2500,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""My threepenny-bit,"" he roared, with one fist up--"
2501,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2502,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,But the seraph Cuchulain only laughed--
2503,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2504,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""That!"" said he. ""Look at me, man. Your little medal dropped far"
2505,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"beyond the rings of Saturn."""
2506,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2507,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,And Brien stood back looking at him--He was as naked as Brien was. He
2508,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"was as naked as a stone, or an eel, or a pot, or a new-born babe. He"
2509,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,was very naked.
2510,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2511,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,So Brien of the O'Brien nation strode across the path and sat down by
2512,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,the side of a hedge--
2513,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2514,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""The first man that passes this way,"" said he, ""will give me his"
2515,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"clothes, or I'll strangle him."""
2516,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2517,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,The seraph Cuchulain walked over to him--
2518,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,
2519,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,"""I will take the clothes of the second man that passes,"" said he, and"
2520,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,he sat down.
2521,THE THREEPENNY-PIECE,

2586,THREE YOUNG WIVES,THREE YOUNG WIVES
2587,THREE YOUNG WIVES,
2588,I,I
2589,I,
2590,I,"She was about to be a mother for the second time, and the fear which is"
2591,I,the portion of women was upon her. In a little while she would be in
2592,I,"the toils, and she hated and feared physical pain with a great hatred"
2593,I,and a great fear. But there was something further which distressed her.
2594,I,
2595,I,"She was a soft, babyish creature, downy and clinging, soft-eyed and"
2596,I,"gentle, the beggar folk had received gifts at her hand, the dogs knew"
2597,I,"of her largesse. Men looked on her with approval, and women liked her."
2598,I,"Her husband belonged to the type known as ""fine men,"" tall,"
2599,I,"generously-proportioned, with the free and easy joviality which is so"
2600,I,common in Ireland. He was born a boy and he would never grow out of
2601,I,that state. The colour of his hair or the wrinkles on his cheek would
2602,I,"not have anything to do with his age, for time was powerless against"
2603,I,the richness of his blood. He would still be a boy when he was dying
2604,I,"of old age; but if protestations, kisses and homage were any criterion"
2605,I,then the fact that he loved his wife was fixed beyond any kind of doubt.
2606,I,
2607,I,But he did not love her.--He was as changeable as the weather of his
2608,I,country. Swift to love he was equally swift to forget. His passions
2609,I,"were of primitive intensity, but they were not steadfast. He clutched"
2610,I,with both hands at the present and was surprised and irritated by the
2611,I,fact that he could in nowise get away from the past: the future he did
2612,I,"not care a rap about. Nobody does: there is, indeed, no such thing as"
2613,I,"the future, there is only the possibility of it, but the past and the"
2614,I,present are facts not to be gotten away from. What we have done and
2615,I,"what we are doing are things which stamp us, mould us, live with us and"
2616,I,"after us: what we will do cannot be counted on, has no part in us, has"
2617,I,"only a problematical existence, and can be interfered with, hindered,"
2618,I,nullified or amplified by the thousand unmanageable accidents of
2619,I,futurity.
2620,I,
2621,I,"He had married thanking God from a full heart for His goodness, and"
2622,I,"believing implicitly that he had plucked the very Flower of Womanhood,"
2623,I,"and the Heart of the World, and, maybe, he had.--There are many Flowers"
2624,I,"of Womanhood, all equally fragrant, and the Heart of the World can beat"
2625,I,against the breast of any man who loves a woman.
2626,I,
2627,I,"Some time previously their little boy had contracted small-pox, and his"
2628,I,"mother, nursing him, took it from him. When they recovered her beauty"
2629,I,was gone. The extraordinary bloom which had made her cheek a shrine to
2630,I,"worship and marvel at was destroyed for ever, while, by a curious"
2631,I,"chance, the boy was unmarked."
2632,I,
2633,I,Now the only love which he had to give was a physical love. He did not
2634,I,"love a woman, he loved the husk. Of the woman herself he knew nothing"
2635,I,"and cared less. He had never sought to know his wife, never tried to"
2636,I,pierce beneath her beauty and discover where the woman lived and what
2637,I,"she was like at home. Indeed, he knew less of his wife than his"
2638,I,"servants did, and by little and little she had seen how the matter"
2639,I,stood. She had plucked the heart from his mystery and read him to the
2640,I,"bones, while remaining herself intact. But she held him still,"
2641,I,"although by the most primitive and fragile of bonds, by the magnetism"
2642,I,"of her body, the shining of her eyes, the soft beauty of her cheeks;"
2643,I,"and, behold! she was undone. The disease had stamped on her face, and,"
2644,I,"in the recoil, had stamped on her husband's love."
2645,I,
2646,I,How many nights of solitary tears she had known! she alone could count
2647,I,"them, a heavy knowledge. How many slights, shrinkings, coldnesses she"
2648,I,"had discerned! the tale of them was hot in her brain, the index heavy"
2649,I,on her heart.
2650,I,
2651,I,She knew her loss on the day that her husband looked at her after her
2652,I,"recovery when all fear of infection had passed--the stare, the flush,"
2653,I,the angry disgust. Her eyes were cameras. She had only to close them
2654,I,and she could see again in dismal procession those dismal details.
2655,I,
2656,I,"And now, as she lay helpless on the bed, she watched him. She was"
2657,I,"racked with pain, and he was mumbling that it would be all right again"
2658,I,"in a little time. ""A week from now,"" said he, ""and you will have"
2659,I,"forgotten all about it."""
2660,I,
2661,I,"But she, looking at him with fearful eyes, traced this sentence at the"
2662,I,"back of his brain, ""I hope that she will die,"" and the life within her"
2663,I,"which had been sown in happiness and love, and had grown great through"
2664,I,misery and tears was now beating at the gates of entrance. . . . She
2665,I,"might die: so many people die in labour, and she was not strong. With"
2666,I,"a new clairvoyant gaze she saw Death standing by the bed, hooded,"
2667,I,cloaked and sombre; his eyes were fixed on her and they were peaceful
2668,I,and kindly eyes. Had there been nothing else to care for she would
2669,I,have gone gladly to the Dark One; but there remained her little son.
2670,I,What heart was he to rest on when she was gone? Whose arms could open
2671,I,so widely as the mother's when he fled from the terrible things which
2672,I,haunt Babyland?--it was an arrow in her heart.
2673,I,
2674,I,She knew well that her husband would marry again. He was of those men
2675,I,who are inveterate husbands--and that new woman!--Who was she? What
2676,I,was she like? What would be her attitude towards a motherless child?
2677,I,"towards her little one? She would be kindly at first, little doubt of"
2678,I,"that, but afterwards, when her own children came, what would become of"
2679,I,the child of a husband's first wife? . . .
2680,I,
2681,I,"She stared down vistas of sorrow. She was a woman, and she knew women."
2682,I,"She saw the other little ones, strangers to her, cared for and loved,"
2683,I,"all their childish troubles the centre of maternal interest and debate,"
2684,I,"while her boy slunk through a lonely, pathetic childhood, frightened,"
2685,I,"repressed, perhaps beaten, because he was not of the brood. . . ."
2686,I,
2687,I,"She saw these things as she lay looking at her husband, and she"
2688,I,believed they would come to pass if she died.
2689,I,
2690,I,"And in the night time, when the stars were hidden behind the window"
2691,I,"curtains, by the light of a lamp that fell on toiling, anxious people,"
2692,I,in a hospital-like atmosphere of pain and clamour she did die.
2693,I,
2694,I,
2695,II,II
2696,II,
2697,II,It was believed long ago in the ancient kingdom of Erinn that it was
2698,II,"death to be a poet, death to love a poet, and death to mock a poet. So"
2699,II,"the Gael said, and, in that distant time, the people of the Gael were a"
2700,II,"wise people, holding the ancient knowledge, and they honoured the poet"
2701,II,"and feared him, for his fostering was among the people of the Shee, and"
2702,II,his curse was quickened with the authority of the gods. Even lately
2703,II,"the people feared the poets and did them reverence, although the New"
2704,II,Ignorance (known humorously as Education) was gradually strangling the
2705,II,"life out of Wisdom, and was setting up a different and debased standard"
2706,II,"of mental values. There was a lady once and she scorned a poet,"
2707,II,"wittingly and with malice, and it was ill for her in the sequel, for"
2708,II,the gods saw to it.
2709,II,
2710,II,"She was very beautiful--""The finest girl in three counties, sir,"" said"
2711,II,"her father: but he might have been prejudiced in favour of his own, and"
2712,II,"he had been known to speak of himself as ""the finest man in Ireland,"
2713,II,"and you know what that means, sir."" Further, his dog was ""the greatest"
2714,II,"dog that ever ratted in the universe."" Whatever he owned was not only"
2715,II,"good, it was great and unique, and whatever he did not own had, in his"
2716,II,"opinion, very little to recommend it."
2717,II,
2718,II,But his daughter was beautiful. When the male eye encountered her it
2719,II,"was in no haste to look away. When the female eye lit on her it was,"
2720,II,"and the owner of the female eye, having sniffed as was proper, went"
2721,II,home and tried to do up her hair or her complexion in the like
2722,II,manner--as was also proper. A great many people believe (and who will
2723,II,quarrel with their verities) that beauty is largely a matter of craft
2724,II,and adjustment.--Such women are beautiful with a little
2725,II,"difficulty--they pursue loveliness, run it to earth in a shop, obtain"
2726,II,"it with a certain amount of minted metal, and reincarnate themselves"
2727,II,from a box.--They deserve all the success which they undoubtedly
2728,II,"obtain. There are other women who are beautiful by accident--such as,"
2729,II,"the cunning disposition of a dimple, the abilities of a certain kind of"
2730,II,"smile, the possession of a charming voice--for, indeed, an ugly woman"
2731,II,with a beautiful voice is a beautiful woman. But some women are
2732,II,"beautiful through the spendthrift generosity of nature, and of this"
2733,II,"last was she. Whatever of colour, line, or motion goes to the"
2734,II,"construction of beauty that she was heiress to, and she knew it only"
2735,II,too well.
2736,II,
2737,II,A person who has something of his own making may properly be proud of
2738,II,"his possession, even if it is nothing more than a stamp album, but a"
2739,II,person who has been gifted by Providence or Fairy Godmothers should not
2740,II,"be conceited. A self-made man may be proud of his money, but his son"
2741,II,"may not. Pride in what has been given freely to you is an empty pride,"
2742,II,and she was prouder of her beauty than a poet is of his odes--it was
2743,II,her undoing in the end.
2744,II,
2745,II,She was so accustomed to the homage of men that one who failed to make
2746,II,instant and humble obeisance to her proved himself to be either a very
2747,II,"vulgar person or else a miracle. Such folk were few, for the average"
2748,II,"man bends as readily to beauty as a flower sways to the wind, or the"
2749,II,sea to the touch of the moon.
2750,II,
2751,II,Before she was twenty years of age she had loomed in the eye of every
2752,II,male in her vicinity as the special female whom nature had built to his
2753,II,exclusive measure. When she was twenty-one she had withstood the
2754,II,"matrimonial threats of half the male population of Ireland, and she"
2755,II,knew how every social grade (there are not many of them) of Irish life
2756,II,"made love, for that was the only thing they were able to do while they"
2757,II,were near her. From the farmer with a spade in his fist to the
2758,II,"landlord with a writ in his agent's pocket, all sang the same song, the"
2759,II,"sole difference being a matter of grammar; and, although young women"
2760,II,"have big appetites in these cases, and great recuperative powers, she"
2761,II,was as tired of love and love-lorn swains as a young and healthy woman
2762,II,"can be, and then, suddenly, and to her own delighted consternation, she"
2763,II,did fall in love.
2764,II,
2765,II,The tantalising part of the whole matter was that she was unable to
2766,II,formulate any good reason for falling in love with this particular
2767,II,male. Her powers of observation (and they were as sharp as a cat's
2768,II,tooth) pointed out that although he was a young man his head was
2769,II,"beginning to push out through his hair, and she had always considered"
2770,II,"that a bald man was outside the pale of human interest. Furthermore,"
2771,II,"his trousers bagged at the knees, perhaps the most lamentable mishap"
2772,II,that can descend on manly apparel.--They were often a little jagged at
2773,II,the ends. She did not understand that trousers such as these were the
2774,II,"correct usage, they were in the tradition: he was wearing ""the bearded"
2775,II,"breeches of the bard."" He was a little weak on his legs, and his hands"
2776,II,"sometimes got in his own way, but she said to herself with a smile,"
2777,II,"""How different he is from other men!"""
2778,II,
2779,II,"What that difference consisted in got between her and her rest, there"
2780,II,was a crumb in her bed on the head of it.
2781,II,
2782,II,"Meanwhile, he had not told her that he loved her, and she was strangely"
2783,II,"anxious for news to that effect. Indeed, she sought confirmation of"
2784,II,"her hopes as often as maidenly modesty permitted, which was pretty"
2785,II,"frequent, for maidenly modesty has its diplomacy also; besides, has not"
2786,II,a reigning beauty liberty to pay court?--there are plenty of other
2787,II,queens who have done it.
2788,II,
2789,II,"He was a poet by profession, but his livelihood depended upon his"
2790,II,ability as a barrister. When she first saw him he was crossing a
2791,II,"street. Suddenly, in the centre of the road, he halted, with his toes"
2792,II,"turned in, his fingers caressing his chin, and an expression of rapt"
2793,II,"and abstracted melancholy on his visage, while he sought for the"
2794,II,"missing, the transfiguring word. There was a sonnet in his eye and it"
2795,II,"impeded his vision. Meanwhile, the wheeled traffic of the street"
2796,II,addressed language to him which was so vigorous as almost to be
2797,II,poetical. She had pulled him from beneath a horse's head which a
2798,II,frantic driver was endeavouring to pull the mouth from. The words of
2799,II,"the driver as he sailed away were--""Go home and die, you moonstruck,"
2800,II,"gibbering, wobbling omadhaun,"" and she had thought that his description"
2801,II,was apt and eloquent.
2802,II,
2803,II,"She saw him a second time, when her father took her for a visit to the"
2804,II,"Four Courts. He was addressing the Court, and, while his language was"
2805,II,"magnificent, the judge must have considered that his law was on"
2806,II,"vacation, for he lost his cause."
2807,II,
2808,II,"They met again in her own home. Her father knew him very well, and,"
2809,II,"although they seldom met, he had that strong admiration for him which a"
2810,II,vigorous and overbearing personality sometimes extends to a shy and
2811,II,unworldly friend--
2812,II,
2813,II,"""A perfect frost as a lawyer,"" he used to say, ""but as a poet, sir,"
2814,II,"Shakespeare is an ass beside him, and if any one asks you who said so,"
2815,II,"tell them that I did, sir."""
2816,II,
2817,II,He sat beside her at dinner and forgot her before the first course was
2818,II,"removed, and, later, when he knocked a glass off the table, he looked"
2819,II,at her as though she were responsible for the debris.
2820,II,
2821,II,"He did not make love to her, a new and remarkable omission in her"
2822,II,"experience of men, however bald, and while this was refreshing for a"
2823,II,"time it became intolerable shortly. She challenged him, as a woman"
2824,II,"can, with the flash of her eyes, the quick music of her laugh, but he"
2825,II,"was marvelling at the width of the horizon, rapt in contemplation of"
2826,II,"the distant mountains, observing how a flower poised and nodded on its"
2827,II,"stalk, following the long, swooping flight of a bird or watching how"
2828,II,the moon tramped down on the stars. So far as she could see he was
2829,II,unaware that her charms were of other than average significance--
2830,II,
2831,II,"""These poets are awful fools,"" said she angrily."
2832,II,
2833,II,But the task of awakening this landlocked nature was one which
2834,II,presented many interesting features to her. She was really jealous
2835,II,"that he paid her no attention, and, being accustomed to the homage of"
2836,II,"every male thing over fifteen years of age, she resented his"
2837,II,"negligence, became interested in him, as every one is in the abnormal,"
2838,II,and when a woman becomes interested in a man she is unhappy until he
2839,II,becomes interested in her.
2840,II,
2841,II,"There had arrived, with the express intention of asking her to marry"
2842,II,"him, another young gentleman. He had a light moustache and a fancy"
2843,II,"waistcoat, both of which looked new. He was young, rich, handsome, and"
2844,II,"sufficiently silly to make any woman wish to take charge of him, and"
2845,II,"her father had told him to ""go in and win, my boy, there's no one I'd"
2846,II,"like better, sir,"" a very good heartener for a slightly dubious youth,"
2847,II,even though he may consider that the lady of his choice is watching
2848,II,another man more intently than is pleasant.
2849,II,
2850,II,"The young gentleman gripped, with careful frenzy, at his light, new"
2851,II,"moustache, and growled as he watched the stalking. But the poet was"
2852,II,"occupied and careless, and then, suddenly, it happened. What movement,"
2853,II,"conscious or unconscious, opened his eyes one cannot say: the thing"
2854,II,"seemed to be done without any preliminaries, and he was awakened and in"
2855,II,the toils.
2856,II,
2857,II,"They had been reading poetry together, his poetry, and he was"
2858,II,"expressing, more to himself than to her, how difficult and how"
2859,II,"delightful it was to work with entire satisfaction within the ""scanty"
2860,II,"plot"" of a sonnet. She was listening with bated breath, and answering"
2861,II,"with an animation more than slightly tinged with ignorance, for she was"
2862,II,as little interested in the making of sonnets as in the making of
2863,II,"shoes.--Nobody is interested in the making of sonnets, not even poets."
2864,II,
2865,II,He fell silent after a space and sat gazing at the moon where it globed
2866,II,"out on the stillness, and she also became silent. Her nerves, she told"
2867,II,"herself, were out of order. She was more used to dismissing than to"
2868,II,being dismissed and yet she seemed beaten. There was nothing further
2869,II,that a girl could do. He cared no more about her than he did about
2870,II,"whatever woman cleaned his rooms. She was not angry, but a feeling of"
2871,II,weariness came upon her. (It is odd that one can be so in earnest when
2872,II,"one is in jest.) Once or twice she shook her head at the moon, and as"
2873,II,"she stared, moody and quiet, it seemed that the moon had slid beyond"
2874,II,"her vision and she was looking into great caverns of space, bursting"
2875,II,with blackness. Some horror of emptiness was reaching to roll her in
2876,II,"pits of murk, where her screams would be battered back on her tongue"
2877,II,soundless.
2878,II,
2879,II,"With an effort she drew her eyes into focus again and turned them,"
2880,II,"smiling bitterly, on her companion, and, lo, he was looking at her with"
2881,II,"timid eyes, amazed eyes, and they spoke, for all their timidity, louder"
2882,II,"than trumpets. She knew that look, who could mistake it? Here was"
2883,II,"flame from the authentic fire. He was silent, but his breath came and"
2884,II,"went hurriedly, and he was bending towards her, little by little he was"
2885,II,"bending, his eyes, his whole body and soul yearning."
2886,II,
2887,II,Then she arose----
2888,II,
2889,II,"""It is getting a little cold,"" said she: ""we had better go in."""
2890,II,
2891,II,They went indoors silently. He was walking like a man just awakened
2892,II,from a dream. While she!--her head was high. Where was her equal!
2893,II,She frowned in the face of the moon and stars. She beat her small feet
2894,II,upon the earth and called it slave. She had torn victory from nowhere.
2895,II,"A man's head swung at her girdle and she owned the blood that dripped,"
2896,II,"and her heart tossed rapture and anthem, carol and paean to the air"
2897,II,around.--She had her hour.
2898,II,
2899,II,That night the other young gentleman whom any woman would like to take
2900,II,"charge of asked her to be his wife, and she consented gracefully,"
2901,II,"slightly disarranging his nice, new moustache in the act of surrender."
2902,II,
2903,II,The next day the poet left the house pleading urgent briefs as an
2904,II,excuse--
2905,II,
2906,II,"""You'll come to the wedding,"" cried her father, ""or,"" laughing, ""maybe,"
2907,II,"you'll help us with the settlements, that's more in your line,"" and he"
2908,II,"put an arm fondly about his daughter. She, regarding their visitor,"
2909,II,nestled to him and laughingly said--
2910,II,
2911,II,"""It would not be like my wedding at all if you stayed away. You must"
2912,II,"write me an ode,"" and her eyes mocked him."
2913,II,
2914,II,"He stood, looking at her for a moment, and his eyes mocked also, for"
2915,II,"the poet knew by his gift what she had done, and he replied with"
2916,II,careless scorn--
2917,II,
2918,II,"""I will come with pleasure, and,"" with an emphasis she noted, ""I will"
2919,II,"dance at your wedding."" So he laughed and marched away heart-whole."
2920,II,
2921,II,"Then, disengaging her arm from her father's, she smiled and walked"
2922,II,"slowly indoors, and as she walked there spread over her body a fierce"
2923,II,"coldness, and when her husband sought her afterwards that wintry breast"
2924,II,"chilled him, and he died: but the poet danced at her wedding, when her"
2925,II,"eyes were timid and pleading, and frightened."
2926,II,
2927,II,
2928,III,III
2929,III,
2930,III,"She read the letter through twice, and then she stood for a few minutes"
2931,III,"looking in front of her, with her arms hanging loosely by her sides,"
2932,III,and her foot tapping on the carpet. She was looking into the future
2933,III,with the thoughtful gaze of one who has cut off all communication with
2934,III,"the past, and, with a strange feeling of detachment, she was wondering"
2935,III,"how that future would reveal itself, and whether he. . .? She crossed"
2936,III,"to the fireplace, sat down, and read the letter over again."
2937,III,
2938,III,Her husband had gone out that evening with a friend. In his usual
2939,III,"hit-or-miss fashion, he kissed his wife and asked her to settle his"
2940,III,"tie. He was always asking her to do something, but he never did"
2941,III,"anything for her.--It was, ""Will you hand me the paper, like a good"
2942,III,"girl?"" and, ""I say, dear, my pipe is stuffed, you might stick a hairpin"
2943,III,"through it,"" or, ""You might see, old lady, if there is a match"
2944,III,"anywhere."" Before their marriage she had been accustomed to men who"
2945,III,"did things for her, and the change was sudden: likeable enough at"
2946,III,first--
2947,III,
2948,III,. . . How red the fire is to-night! They must be sending better coal
2949,III,"than we usually get--there is not a single dark spot in it, and how the"
2950,III,shape continually changes! Now it is a deep cave with stalactites
2951,III,"hanging from the roof, and little swelling hillocks on the floor, and,"
2952,III,"over all, a delicate, golden glow surging and fading. The blue flame"
2953,III,"on the top that flits and flickers like a will-o'-the-wisp is gas, I"
2954,III,suppose--I wonder how they extract it. . . . I wonder will he be sorry
2955,III,"when he comes home, and finds. . . . Perhaps his friend will be"
2956,III,sufficient for him then. . . . It is curious to think of oneself as a
2957,III,"piece of animated furniture, a dumb waiter, always ready when required,"
2958,III,"and decently out of sight when not wanted--not dumb, though! He cannot"
2959,III,"say I failed to talk about it: but, of course, that is nagging and bad"
2960,III,"temper, and ""making yourself ridiculous for nothing, my dear."""
2961,III,Nothing! I warned him over and over again; but he must have company.
2962,III,"He would be stifled unless he went among men now and again--""Male"
2963,III,"company is a physical necessity for men, my dear."" I suppose women do"
2964,III,"not need any other company than that of their husbands, and they must"
2965,III,"not ask too much of that. . . . What strange, careless, hopeful"
2966,III,"creatures they are, and how they cease to value what they have got!"
2967,III,"Does the value rise again when it is gone, I wonder? . . . Out all"
2968,III,"day, and he cannot understand why I ask him to stay with me at night."
2969,III,"""A man wants air, sweetheart."" A woman does not, of course--she would"
2970,III,"not have the cheek to want anything: there is something not ""nice"""
2971,III,about a woman wanting anything. Do all men stifle in the air their
2972,III,"wives have breathed? If I ask him ""do you love me still?"" he replies,"
2973,III,"""of course, do you mind if I run out for an hour or two, dear."" One"
2974,III,"will ask questions, of course. . . . A kiss in the morning, another at"
2975,III,"night, and, for Heaven's sake, don't bother me in the interval: that is"
2976,III,marriage from a man's point of view. Do they really believe that women
2977,III,are alive? Is matrimony always a bondage to them? Are all women's
2978,III,"lives so lonely? Are their wishes neglected, their attempts to think"
2979,III,"laughed at, their pride stricken?--I wonder. . . . And he did love me,"
2980,III,I know that: but if he has forgotten I must not remember it. He could
2981,III,"not see enough of me then: and the things he said, and does not"
2982,III,remember--I was a wonder that the world could not equal--it is
2983,III,"laughable.--A look from me was joy, a word delight, a touch ecstasy."
2984,III,"He would run to the ends of the earth to gratify a whim of mine, and"
2985,III,life without me was not worth living. . . . If I would only love him!
2986,III,If I could only bring myself to care for him a little--he was too
2987,III,"humble, too unworthy to imagine--and so forth, and so forth; and it was"
2988,III,all true then. Now I am some one who waits upon him. He wants this
2989,III,"and that, and asks me for it. He has cut his finger and shouts for me"
2990,III,"to bind it up, and I must be terribly concerned about it; somehow, he"
2991,III,will even manage to blame me for his cut finger. He cannot sleep in
2992,III,"the night, so I must awaken also and listen to his complaint. He is"
2993,III,"sick, and the medicine tastes nasty; I am to understand that if the"
2994,III,medicine tastes nasty I am responsible for it--I should not have given
2995,III,him anything nasty: he is surprised: he trusted me not to do such a
2996,III,thing to him. He turns to me like a child when he has any . . . he
2997,III,turns to me like a child and trusts . . . he turns to me . . . like a
2998,III,child. . . .
2999,III,
3000,III,"The sound of a horse's hooves came to her, and she arose from her chair"
3001,III,"with frightened haste. She looked swiftly at the clock, and then stood"
3002,III,"listening in a rigid attitude, with a face that grew white and peaked,"
3003,III,and flushed and paled again. The car came swiftly nearer and stopped a
3004,III,"little way from the house. Then a foot crunched the gravel, and her"
3005,III,desperate eyes went roving quickly about the room as though she were
3006,III,"looking for a place to hide in. Next, after a little interval of"
3007,III,"silence, a pebble struck the window. She stood for a moment staring at"
3008,III,"the window and then ran to it, swung open a pane of glass, and, leaning"
3009,III,"out, she called in a high, strained voice, ""I will not go."" Then,"
3010,III,"closing the window again, she ran back to the fireplace, crouched down"
3011,III,on the rug and pushed her fingers into her ears.
3012,III,
3013,III,"Her husband came home before eleven o'clock, brushed the wraith of a"
3014,III,"kiss half an inch from her lips, and asked was there anything nice for"
3015,III,"supper? The supper things were already on the table, and, after"
3016,III,tasting a mouthful--
3017,III,
3018,III,"""Who cooked this?"" said he."
3019,III,
3020,III,She was watching him intently--
3021,III,
3022,III,"""The girl did,"" she replied."
3023,III,
3024,III,"""I knew it,"" said he angrily, ""it's beastly: you might have done it"
3025,III,"yourself when you were not busy; a lot you care about what I like."""
3026,III,
3027,III,"""I will do it to-morrow,"" she replied quietly."
3028,III,
3029,III,"""Yes do,"" said he, ""there is no one can cook like you."""
3030,III,
3031,III,"And she, still watching him intently, suddenly began to laugh--"
3032,III,
3033,III,"He leaped up from the table and, after a stare of indignant"
3034,III,"astonishment, he stalked off to bed--"
3035,III,
3036,III,"""You are always giggling about nothing,"" said he, and he banged the"
3037,III,door.
3038,III,
3039,III,

3042,THE HORSES,THE HORSES
3043,THE HORSES,
3044,THE HORSES,"He was tall and she was short. He was bulky, promising to be fat. She"
3045,THE HORSES,"was thin, and, with a paring here and there, would have been skinny."
3046,THE HORSES,"His face was sternly resolute, solemn indeed, hers was prim, and"
3047,THE HORSES,"primness is the most everlasting, indestructible trait of humanity. It"
3048,THE HORSES,can outface the Sphinx. It is destructible only by death. Whoever has
3049,THE HORSES,"married a prim woman must hand over his breeches and his purse, he will"
3050,THE HORSES,"collect postage stamps in his old age, he will twiddle his thumbs and"
3051,THE HORSES,"smile when the visitor asks him a question, he will grow to dislike"
3052,THE HORSES,"beer, and will admit and assert that a man's place is the home--these"
3053,THE HORSES,things come to pass as surely as the procession of the seasons.
3054,THE HORSES,
3055,THE HORSES,"It may be asked why he had married her, and it would be difficult to"
3056,THE HORSES,find an answer to that question. The same query might be put to almost
3057,THE HORSES,"any couple, for (and it is possibly right that it should be so) we do"
3058,THE HORSES,"not marry by mathematics, but by some extraordinary attraction which is"
3059,THE HORSES,"neither entirely sexual nor mental. Something other than these,"
3060,THE HORSES,"something as yet uncharted by psychology, is the determining factor."
3061,THE HORSES,"It may be that the universal, strange chemistry of nature, planning"
3062,THE HORSES,"granite and twig, ant and onion, is also ordering us more imperatively"
3063,THE HORSES,and more secretly than we are aware.
3064,THE HORSES,
3065,THE HORSES,"He had always been a hasty creature. He never had any brains, and had"
3066,THE HORSES,never felt the lack of them. He was one of those men who are called
3067,THE HORSES,"""strong,"" because of their imperfect control over themselves. His"
3068,THE HORSES,appetites and his mental states ruled him. He was impatient of any
3069,THE HORSES,restraint; whatever he wanted to do he wanted urgently to do and would
3070,THE HORSES,touch no alternatives. He had the robust good humour which will
3071,THE HORSES,cheerfully forgive you to-morrow for the wrongs he has done you to-day.
3072,THE HORSES,He bore no malice to any one on earth except those who took their
3073,THE HORSES,medicine badly. Meek people got on very well with him because they
3074,THE HORSES,"behaved themselves, but he did not like them to believe they would"
3075,THE HORSES,inherit the earth.
3076,THE HORSES,
3077,THE HORSES,"Some people marry because other people have done so. It is in the air,"
3078,THE HORSES,"like clothing and art and not eating with a knife. He, of course, got"
3079,THE HORSES,"married because he wanted to, and the singular part of it was that he"
3080,THE HORSES,"did not mate with a meek woman. Perhaps he thought she was meek, for"
3081,THE HORSES,before marriage there is a habit of deference on both sides which is
3082,THE HORSES,misleading and sometimes troublesome.
3083,THE HORSES,
3084,THE HORSES,From the beginning of their marriage he had fought against his wife
3085,THE HORSES,with steadiness and even ferocity. Scarcely had they been wed when her
3086,THE HORSES,"gently-repressive hand was laid upon him, and, like a startled horse,"
3087,THE HORSES,"he bounded at the touch into freedom--that is, as far as the limits of"
3088,THE HORSES,the matrimonial rope would permit. Of course he came back again--there
3089,THE HORSES,"was the rope, and the unfailing, untiring hand easing him to the way he"
3090,THE HORSES,was wanted to go.
3091,THE HORSES,
3092,THE HORSES,"There was no fighting against that. Or, at least, it did not seem that"
3093,THE HORSES,"fighting was any use. One may punch a bag, but the bag does not mind,"
3094,THE HORSES,and at last one grows weary of unproductive quarrelling. One shrugs
3095,THE HORSES,"one's shoulders, settles to the collar, and accepts whatever destiny"
3096,THE HORSES,"the gods, in their wisdom, have ordained. Is life the anvil upon which"
3097,THE HORSES,"the gods beat out their will? It is not so. The anvil is matter, the"
3098,THE HORSES,"will of the gods is life itself, urging through whatever torment to"
3099,THE HORSES,some identity which it can only surmise or hope for; and the one order
3100,THE HORSES,to life is that it shall not cease to rebel until it has ceased to
3101,THE HORSES,"live; when, perhaps, it can take up the shaping struggle in some other"
3102,THE HORSES,form or some other place.
3103,THE HORSES,
3104,THE HORSES,But he had almost given in. Practically he had bowed to the new order.
3105,THE HORSES,"Domestic habits were settling about him thick as cobwebs, and as"
3106,THE HORSES,clinging. His feet were wiped on the mat when he came in. His hat was
3107,THE HORSES,hung on the orthodox projection. His kiss was given at the stated
3108,THE HORSES,"time, and lasted for the regulation period. The chimney-corner claimed"
3109,THE HORSES,him and got him. The window was his outlook on life. Beyond the hall
3110,THE HORSES,door were foreign lands inhabited by people who were no longer of his
3111,THE HORSES,"kind. The cat and the canary, these were his familiars, and his wife"
3112,THE HORSES,was rapidly becoming his friend.
3113,THE HORSES,
3114,THE HORSES,Once a day he trod solemnly forth on the designated walk--
3115,THE HORSES,
3116,THE HORSES,"""Be back before one o'clock,"" said the voice of kind authority, ""lunch"
3117,THE HORSES,"will be ready."""
3118,THE HORSES,
3119,THE HORSES,"""Won't you be back before two?"" said that voice, ""the lawn has to be"
3120,THE HORSES,"rolled."""
3121,THE HORSES,
3122,THE HORSES,"""Don't stay out after three,"" the voice entreated, ""we are going to"
3123,THE HORSES,"visit Aunt Kate."""
3124,THE HORSES,
3125,THE HORSES,And at one and two and three o'clock he paced urgently wifeward. He
3126,THE HORSES,ate the lunch that was punctually ready. He rolled the inevitable
3127,THE HORSES,"lawn. He trod sturdily to meet the Aunt Kate and did not quail, and"
3128,THE HORSES,"then he went home again. One climbed to bed at ten o'clock, one was"
3129,THE HORSES,"gently spoken to until eleven o'clock, and then one went to sleep."
3130,THE HORSES,
3131,THE HORSES,"On a day she entrusted him with a sum of money, and requested that he"
3132,THE HORSES,"should go down to the town and pay at certain shops certain bills, the"
3133,THE HORSES,details whereof she furnished to him on paper.
3134,THE HORSES,
3135,THE HORSES,"""Be back before three o'clock,"" said the good lady, ""for the Fegans are"
3136,THE HORSES,"coming to tea. You need not take your umbrella, it won't rain, and you"
3137,THE HORSES,"ought to leave your pipe behind, it doesn't look nice. Bring some"
3138,THE HORSES,"cigarettes instead, and your walking-stick if you like, and be sure to"
3139,THE HORSES,"be back before three."""
3140,THE HORSES,
3141,THE HORSES,"He pressed his pipe into a thing on the wall which was meant for pipes,"
3142,THE HORSES,"put his cigarette-case into his pocket, and took his walking-stick in"
3143,THE HORSES,his hand.
3144,THE HORSES,
3145,THE HORSES,"""You did not kiss me good-bye,"" said she gently."
3146,THE HORSES,
3147,THE HORSES,"So he returned and did that, and then he went out."
3148,THE HORSES,
3149,THE HORSES,It was a delicious day. The sun was shining with all its might. One
3150,THE HORSES,"could see that it liked shining, and hoped everybody enjoyed its art."
3151,THE HORSES,If there were birds about anywhere it is certain they were singing. In
3152,THE HORSES,"this suburb, however, there were only sparrows, but they hopped and"
3153,THE HORSES,"flew, and flew and hopped, and cocked their heads sideways and chirped"
3154,THE HORSES,"something cheerful, but possibly rude, as one passed. They were busy"
3155,THE HORSES,"to the full extent of their beings, playing innocent games with happy"
3156,THE HORSES,"little flies, and there was not one worry among a thousand of them."
3157,THE HORSES,
3158,THE HORSES,There was a cat lying on a hot window-ledge. She was looking drowsily
3159,THE HORSES,"at the sparrows, and any one could see that she loved them and wished"
3160,THE HORSES,them well.
3161,THE HORSES,
3162,THE HORSES,"There was a dog stretched across a doorway. He was very quiet, but he"
3163,THE HORSES,"was not in the least bored. He was taking a sun-bath, and he was"
3164,THE HORSES,watching the cat. So steadily did he observe her that one discerned at
3165,THE HORSES,"a glance he was her friend, and would protect her at any cost."
3166,THE HORSES,
3167,THE HORSES,There was a small boy who held in his left hand a tin can and a piece
3168,THE HORSES,of string. With his right hand he was making affectionate gestures to
3169,THE HORSES,"the dog. He loved playing with animals, and he always rewarded their"
3170,THE HORSES,trust in him.
3171,THE HORSES,
3172,THE HORSES,"Our traveller paced slowly onwards, looking at his feet as he went. He"
3173,THE HORSES,noticed with a little dismay that he could not see as much of his legs
3174,THE HORSES,as he thought he should see. There was a slight but nicely-shaped
3175,THE HORSES,curve between him and his past--
3176,THE HORSES,
3177,THE HORSES,"""I am getting fat,"" said he to himself, and the reflection carried him"
3178,THE HORSES,back to the morning mirror--
3179,THE HORSES,
3180,THE HORSES,"""I am getting a bit bald, too,"" said he, and a quiet sadness took"
3181,THE HORSES,possession of him.
3182,THE HORSES,
3183,THE HORSES,"But he reassured himself. One does get fat. ""Every one gets fat,"""
3184,THE HORSES,"said he, ""after he gets married."" He reviewed his friends and"
3185,THE HORSES,"acquaintances, and found that this was true, and he bowed before an"
3186,THE HORSES,immutable decree.
3187,THE HORSES,
3188,THE HORSES,"""One does get bald,"" quoth he. ""Everybody gets bald. The wisest"
3189,THE HORSES,"people in the world lose their hair. Kings and generals, rich people"
3190,THE HORSES,"and poor people, they are all bald! It is not a disgrace,"" said he;"
3191,THE HORSES,and he trod soberly forward in the sunshine.
3192,THE HORSES,
3193,THE HORSES,"A young man caught up on him from behind, and strode past. He was"
3194,THE HORSES,whistling. His coat-tails were lifted and his hands were thrust in his
3195,THE HORSES,pockets. His elbows jerked to left and right as he marched.
3196,THE HORSES,
3197,THE HORSES,"""A fellow oughtn't to swagger about like that,"" said our traveller."
3198,THE HORSES,"""What does he want to tuck up his coat for, anyhow? It's not decent,"""
3199,THE HORSES,"said he in a low voice. ""It makes people laugh,"" said he."
3200,THE HORSES,
3201,THE HORSES,A girl came out of a shop near by and paced down in their direction.
3202,THE HORSES,"She looked at the young man as they passed, and then she turned again,"
3203,THE HORSES,"a glance, no more, and looked after him without stopping her pace. She"
3204,THE HORSES,"came on. She had no pockets to stick her hands in, but she also was"
3205,THE HORSES,"swaggering. There was a left and right movement of her shoulders, an"
3206,THE HORSES,impetus and retreat of her hips. Something very strong and yet
3207,THE HORSES,reticent about her surging body. She passed the traveller and went
3208,THE HORSES,down the road.
3209,THE HORSES,
3210,THE HORSES,"""She did not look at me,"" said he, and his mind folded its hand across"
3211,THE HORSES,"its stomach, and sat down, while he went forward in the sunlight to do"
3212,THE HORSES,his errands.
3213,THE HORSES,
3214,THE HORSES,"He stopped to light a cigarette, and stood for a few minutes watching"
3215,THE HORSES,the blue smoke drifting and thinning away on the air. While he stood a
3216,THE HORSES,man drove up with a horse and car. The car was laden with
3217,THE HORSES,"groceries--packets of somebody's tea, boxes of somebody's chocolate,"
3218,THE HORSES,"bottles of beer and of mineral water, tins of boot blacking, and"
3219,THE HORSES,"parcels of soap; confectionery, and tinned fish, cheese, macaroni, and"
3220,THE HORSES,jam.
3221,THE HORSES,
3222,THE HORSES,"The man was beating the horse as he approached, and the traveller"
3223,THE HORSES,looked at them both through a wreath of smoke.
3224,THE HORSES,
3225,THE HORSES,"""I wonder,"" said he, ""why that man beats his horse?"""
3226,THE HORSES,
3227,THE HORSES,The driver was sitting at ease. He was not angry. He was not
3228,THE HORSES,impatient. There was nothing the matter with him at all. But he was
3229,THE HORSES,"steadily beating the horse; not harshly, gently in truth. He beat the"
3230,THE HORSES,"horse without ill-will, almost without knowing he was doing it. It was"
3231,THE HORSES,"a sort of wrist exercise. A quick, delicate twitch of the whip that"
3232,THE HORSES,"caught the animal under the belly, always in the same place. It was"
3233,THE HORSES,"very skilful, but the driver was so proficient in his art that one"
3234,THE HORSES,wondered why he had to practice at it any longer. And the horse did
3235,THE HORSES,not make any objection! Not even with his ears; they lay back to his
3236,THE HORSES,mane as he jogged steadily forward in the sunlight. His hooves were
3237,THE HORSES,"shod with iron, but they moved with an unfaltering, humble regularity."
3238,THE HORSES,"His mouth was filled with great, yellow teeth, but he kept his mouth"
3239,THE HORSES,"shut, and one could not see them. He did not increase or diminish his"
3240,THE HORSES,"pace under the lash; he jogged onwards, and did not seem to mind it."
3241,THE HORSES,
3242,THE HORSES,"The reins were jerked suddenly, and the horse turned into the path and"
3243,THE HORSES,"stopped, and when he stood he was not any quieter than when he had been"
3244,THE HORSES,moving. He did not raise his head or whisk his tail. He did not move
3245,THE HORSES,his ears to the sounds behind and on either side of him. He did not
3246,THE HORSES,paw and fumble with his feet. There was a swarm of flies about his
3247,THE HORSES,head; they moved along from the point of his nose to the top of his
3248,THE HORSES,"forehead, but mostly they clustered in black, obscene patches about his"
3249,THE HORSES,"eyes, and through these patches his eyes looked out with a strange"
3250,THE HORSES,"patience, a strange mildness. He was stating a fact over and over to"
3251,THE HORSES,"himself, and he could not think of anything else--"
3252,THE HORSES,
3253,THE HORSES,"""There are no longer any meadows in the world,"" said he. ""They came in"
3254,THE HORSES,"the night and took away the green meadows, and the horses do not know"
3255,THE HORSES,"what to do."" . . . Horse! Horse! Little horse! . . . You do not"
3256,THE HORSES,believe me. There are those who have no whips. There are children who
3257,THE HORSES,would love to lift you in their arms and stroke your head. . . .
3258,THE HORSES,
3259,THE HORSES,"The driver came again, he mounted to his seat, and the horse turned"
3260,THE HORSES,carefully and trotted away.
3261,THE HORSES,
3262,THE HORSES,"The man with the cigarette looked after them for a few minutes, and"
3263,THE HORSES,"then he also turned carefully, to do his errands."
3264,THE HORSES,
3265,THE HORSES,He reached the Railway Station and peered in at the clock. There were
3266,THE HORSES,some men in uniform striding busily about. Three or four people were
3267,THE HORSES,moving up the steps towards the ticket office. A raggedy man shook a
3268,THE HORSES,"newspaper in his face, paused for half a second, and fled away bawling"
3269,THE HORSES,his news. A red-faced woman pushed hastily past him. She was carrying
3270,THE HORSES,"a big basket and a big baby. She was terribly engrossed by both, and"
3271,THE HORSES,"he wondered if she had to drop one which of them it would be. A short,"
3272,THE HORSES,"stout, elderly man was hoisting himself and a great leather portmanteau"
3273,THE HORSES,by easy stages up the steps. He was very determined. He bristled at
3274,THE HORSES,everybody as at an enemy. He regarded inanimate nature as if he was
3275,THE HORSES,daring it to move. It would not be easy to make that man miss a train.
3276,THE HORSES,A young lady trod softly up the steps. She draped snowy garments about
3277,THE HORSES,"her, but her ankles rebelled: whoever looked quickly saw them once, and"
3278,THE HORSES,"then she spoke very severely to them, and they hid themselves. It was"
3279,THE HORSES,"plain that she could scarcely control them, and that they would escape"
3280,THE HORSES,again when she wasn't looking. A young man bounded up the steps; he
3281,THE HORSES,"was too late to see them, and he looked as if he knew it. He stared"
3282,THE HORSES,"angrily at the girl, but she lifted her chin slightly and refused to"
3283,THE HORSES,admit that he was alive. A very small boy was trying to push a large
3284,THE HORSES,"india-rubber ball into his mouth, but his mouth was not big enough to"
3285,THE HORSES,"hold it, and he wept because of his limitations. He was towed along by"
3286,THE HORSES,"his sister, a girl so tall that one might say her legs reached to"
3287,THE HORSES,"heaven, and maybe they did."
3288,THE HORSES,
3289,THE HORSES,He looked again at the hour. It was one minute to two o'clock; and
3290,THE HORSES,then something happened. The whole white world became red. The oldest
3291,THE HORSES,seas in the world went suddenly lashing into storm. An ocean of blood
3292,THE HORSES,"thundered into his head, and the noise of that primitive flood, roaring"
3293,THE HORSES,"from what prehistoric gulfs, deafened him at an instant. The waves"
3294,THE HORSES,"whirled his feet from under him. He went foaming up the steps, was"
3295,THE HORSES,"swept violently into the ticket office, and was swirled away like a"
3296,THE HORSES,"bobbing cork into the train. A guard tried to stop him, for the train"
3297,THE HORSES,"was already taking its pace, but one cannot keep out the tide with a"
3298,THE HORSES,"ticket-puncher. The guard was overwhelmed, caught in the backwash, and"
3299,THE HORSES,"swirled somewhere, anywhere, out of sight and knowledge. The train"
3300,THE HORSES,"gathered speed, went flying out of the station into the blazing"
3301,THE HORSES,"sunlight, picked up its heels and ran, and ran, and ran; the wind"
3302,THE HORSES,"leaped by the carriage window, shrieking with laughter; the wide fields"
3303,THE HORSES,"danced with each other, shouting aloud"
3304,THE HORSES,
3305,THE HORSES,"""The horses are coming again to the green meadows. Make way, make way"
3306,THE HORSES,"for the great, wild horses!"""
3307,THE HORSES,
3308,THE HORSES,And the trees went leaping from horizon to horizon shrieking and
3309,THE HORSES,shrieking the news.

3347,THREE LOVERS WHO LOST,THREE LOVERS WHO LOST
3348,THREE LOVERS WHO LOST,
3349,I,I
3350,I,
3351,I,Young Mr. O'Grady was in love. It was the first time he had been in
3352,I,"love, and it was all sufficiently startling. He seemed to have leaped"
3353,I,"from boyhood to manhood at a stroke, and the things which had pretended"
3354,I,to be of moment yesterday were to-day discovered to have only the very
3355,I,meanest importance. Different affairs now occupied him. A little
3356,I,"while ago his cogitations had included, where he would walk to on the"
3357,I,"next Sunday, whether his aunt in Meath Street would lend him the price"
3358,I,"of a ticket for the coming Bank Holiday excursion, whether his brother"
3359,I,"would be using his bicycle on Saturday afternoon, and whether the"
3360,I,packet of cigarettes which he was momently smoking contained as many
3361,I,cigarettes as could be got elsewhere for two pence.
3362,I,
3363,I,These things were no longer noteworthy. Clothing had assumed an
3364,I,"importance he could scarcely have believed in. Boots, neck-ties, the"
3365,I,"conduct of one's hat and of one's head, the progress of one's"
3366,I,"moustache, one's bearing towards people in the street and in the house,"
3367,I,this and that social observance--all these things took on a new and
3368,I,"important dignity. He bought a walking-stick, a card-case, a purse, a"
3369,I,pipe with a glass bottom wherein one could observe one's own nicotine
3370,I,inexorably accumulating.--He bought a book on etiquette and a pot of
3371,I,"paste for making moustaches grow in spite of providence, and one day he"
3372,I,"insisted on himself drinking a half glass of whisky--it tasted sadly,"
3373,I,but he drank it without a grimace. Etiquette and whisky! these things
3374,I,"have to be done, and one might as well do them with an air. He was in"
3375,I,"love, he was grown up, he was a man, and he lived fearlessly up to his"
3376,I,razor and his lady.
3377,I,
3378,I,From the book on etiquette he exhumed a miscellany of useful and
3379,I,peculiar wisdom. Following information about the portage of knives and
3380,I,forks at incredible dinners he discovered that a well-bred person
3381,I,always speaks to the young lady's parents before he speaks to the young
3382,I,"lady. He straightened his shoulders.--It would be almost as bad, he"
3383,I,"thought, as having to drink whisky, but if it had to be done why he"
3384,I,would not shrink from this any more than he had from that. He set
3385,I,forth on the tingling errand.
3386,I,
3387,I,"Mr. O'Reilly was a scrivener, a husband and a father. He made copies"
3388,I,of all kinds of documents for a living. He also copied maps. It has
3389,I,been said that scriveners have to get drunk at least twice a week in
3390,I,order to preserve their sanity; but the person whose miserable
3391,I,employment is to draw copies of maps is more desperately environed than
3392,I,an ordinary scrivener. It was Mr. O'Reilly's misfortune that he was
3393,I,"unable to get drunk. He disliked liquor, and, moreover, it disagreed"
3394,I,"with him. He had, to paraphrase Lamb, toiled after liquor as other"
3395,I,"people toil after virtue, but the nearer he got the less did he like"
3396,I,"it. As a consequence of this enforced decency the ill-temper, which is"
3397,I,"the normal state of scriveners, had surged and buzzed around him so"
3398,I,long that he had quite forgotten what a good temper was like.--It might
3399,I,"be said that he hated every one, not excepting his wife and daughter."
3400,I,"He could avoid other people, but these he could never escape from."
3401,I,They wanted to talk to him when he wanted to be let alone. They
3402,I,worried him with this and that domestic question or uproar. He would
3403,I,gladly have sold them both as slaves to the Barbadoes or presented them
3404,I,to the seraglio of any eastern potentate. There they were! and he
3405,I,often gnashed his teeth and grinned at them in amazement because they
3406,I,were there.
3407,I,
3408,I,On the evening when young Mr. O'Grady sallied forth to ask him for the
3409,I,hand of his daughter in marriage he was sitting at supper with his
3410,I,consort--
3411,I,
3412,I,Mr. O'Reilly took the last slice of bread from under his wife's hand.
3413,I,"It was loot, so he ate it with an extra relish and his good lady"
3414,I,waddled away to get more bread from cupboard--
3415,I,
3416,I,"""Everything's a trouble,"" said she, as she cut the loaf. ""Doesn't it"
3417,I,"make you think of the hymn 'I'm but a stranger here, heaven is my"
3418,I,"home'?"""
3419,I,
3420,I,"""No, ma'm,"" said her husband, ""it does not. Where is Julia Elizabeth?"""
3421,I,and he daringly and skilfully abstracted the next slice of bread while
3422,I,his wife was laying down the butter knife.
3423,I,
3424,I,"""I wish,"" said she, as she reached for the knife again, ""I wish you"
3425,I,"would give me a chance, O'Reilly: you eat much quicker than I do, God"
3426,I,"help me!"""
3427,I,
3428,I,"""I wish,"" rapped her husband fiercely, ""that you would give a plain"
3429,I,"answer to a plain question. Now then, ma'm, in two words, where is"
3430,I,"that girl? My whole life seems to be occupied in asking that question,"
3431,I,"and yours seems to be spent in dodging the answer to it."""
3432,I,
3433,I,"""I don't know,"" replied his wife severely, ""and that's three words."""
3434,I,
3435,I,"""You don't know!"" he looked around in helpless appeal and condemnation."
3436,I,"""What sort of an answer is that for a mother to give about her"
3437,I,"daughter?"" and under cover of his wrath he stole the next slice of"
3438,I,bread.
3439,I,
3440,I,His wife also became angry--she put her plate in her lap and sat up at
3441,I,him--
3442,I,
3443,I,"""Don't barge me, man,"" said she. ""A nice daughter to have to give such"
3444,I,"an answer about. Leave me alone now for I'm not well, I say, on the"
3445,I,head of her. I never know where she does be. One night it's (she
3446,I,endeavoured to reproduce her daughter's soprano) 'I am going to a
3447,I,"dance, mother, at the Durkins'----'"""
3448,I,
3449,I,"""Ha'penny hops!"" said her husband fiercely. ""Can't you cut me a bit of"
3450,I,"bread!"""
3451,I,
3452,I,"""And another night, 'she wants to go out to see Mary Durkan.'"""
3453,I,
3454,I,"""I know her well, a big hat and no morals, a bankrupt's baggage."""
3455,I,
3456,I,"""And the night after she 'wants to go to the theatre, ma.'"""
3457,I,
3458,I,"""Dens of infamy,"" said he. ""If I had my way I'd shut them all up and"
3459,I,"put the actors in gaol, with their hamleting and gamyacting and"
3460,I,"ha-ha'ing out of them."""
3461,I,
3462,I,"""I can't keep her in,"" said his wife, wringing her hands, ""and I won't"
3463,I,"try to any longer. I get a headache when I talk to her, so I do. Last"
3464,I,night when I mentioned about her going out with that Rorke man she
3465,I,turned round as cool as you please and told me 'to shut up.' Her own
3466,I,"mother!"" and she surveyed Providence with a condemnatory eye--"
3467,I,
3468,I,At this point her husband swung his long arm and arrested the slice of
3469,I,bread in his wife's lap--
3470,I,
3471,I,"""If she spoke to me that way,"" he grinned, ""I'll bet I'd astonish her."""
3472,I,
3473,I,"His wife looked in amazement from her lap to his plate, but she had"
3474,I,ability for only one quarrel at a time--
3475,I,
3476,I,"""And doesn't she talk to you like that? You never say a word to her"
3477,I,but she has a look in her eye that's next door to calling you a
3478,I,"fool.--I don't know where she is at all to-day."""
3479,I,
3480,I,"""What time did she go out?"""
3481,I,
3482,I,"""After breakfast this morning."""
3483,I,
3484,I,"""And now it's supper-time--ha! that's good! Can't you give me a bit of"
3485,I,"bread, or do you want to eat the whole loaf yourself? Try to remember"
3486,I,"that I do pay for my food."""
3487,I,
3488,I,"With an angry shake of the head his wife began to cut the loaf, and"
3489,I,continued speaking--
3490,I,
3491,I,"""'Where are you going to, Julia Elizabeth?' said I. 'Out,' said she,"
3492,I,"and not another word could I get from her. Her own mother, mind you,"
3493,I,"and her best clothes----"""
3494,I,
3495,I,Mr. O'Reilly ate the last slice of bread and arose from the table.
3496,I,
3497,I,"""I suppose,"" said he, ""she is loafing about the streets with some young"
3498,I,"puppy who has nothing of his own but a cigarette and a walking-stick,"
3499,I,"and they both borrowed. I'll have a talk with her when she comes in,"
3500,I,"and we'll see if she tells me to shut up."""
3501,I,
3502,I,"The door banged, the room shook, and Mrs. O'Reilly settled to her"
3503,I,"frustrated tea, but her thoughts still ran on her daughter."
3504,I,
3505,I,"It was at this point that, directed by love and etiquette, Mr. O'Grady"
3506,I,knocked at the door. Mrs. O'Reilly was again cutting the loaf in an
3507,I,"exasperation which was partly hunger and partly maternal, and, as she"
3508,I,"cut, she communed with herself--"
3509,I,
3510,I,"""As if,"" said she, ""I haven't enough trouble trying to keep a cranky"
3511,I,"man like her pa in good humour, without being plagued by Julia"
3512,I,"Elizabeth""--she paused, for there was a knock at the door.--""If,"" said"
3513,I,"she to the door, ""you are a woman with ferns in a pot I don't want you,"
3514,I,"and I don't want Dublin Bay herrings, or boot-laces either, so you can"
3515,I,go away.--The crankiness of that man is more than tongue can tell. As
3516,I,"Miss Carty says, I shouldn't stand it for an hour--Come in, can't"
3517,I,"you--and well she may say it, and she a spinster without a worry under"
3518,I,heaven but her suspicious nature and her hair falling out. And then to
3519,I,be treated the way I am by that girl! It'd make a saint waxy so it
3520,I,"would.--Good heavens! can't you come in, or are you deaf or lame or"
3521,I,"what?"" and in some exasperation she arose and went to the door. She"
3522,I,"looked in perplexity for one moment from her food to her visitor, but"
3523,I,as good manners and a lady are never separate she welcomed and drew the
3524,I,young man inside--
3525,I,
3526,I,"""Come in, Mr. O'Grady,"" said she. ""How are you now at all? Why it's"
3527,I,nearly a week since you were here. Your mother's well I hope (sit down
3528,I,"there now and rest yourself). Some people are always well, but I'm"
3529,I,"not--it's (sit there beside the window, like a good boy) it's hard to"
3530,I,"have poor health and a crotchety husband, but we all have our trials."
3531,I,"Is your father well too? but what's the use of asking, every one's well"
3532,I,but me. Did your aunt get the pot of jam I sent her last Tuesday?
3533,I,"Raspberry is supposed to be good for the throat, but her throat's all"
3534,I,right. Maybe she threw it out: I'm not blaming her if she did. God
3535,I,knows she can buy jam if she wants it without being beholden to any one
3536,I,"for presents and her husband in the Post Office.--Well, well, well, I'm"
3537,I,"real glad to see you--and now, tell me all the news?"""
3538,I,
3539,I,The young man was a little embarrassed by this flood of language and
3540,I,"its multiplicity of direction, but the interval gave him time to"
3541,I,collect himself and get into the atmosphere.--He replied--
3542,I,
3543,I,"""I don't think there is any news to tell, ma'm. Father and mother are"
3544,I,"quite well, thank you, and Aunt Jane got the jam all right, but she"

3550,I,
3551,I,"""You see,"" said the young man, ""the children got at the jam before she"
3552,I,"could, and they cleaned the pot. Aunt Jane was very angry about it."""
3553,I,
3554,I,"""Was she now?"" said the instantly interested lady. ""It's real bad for"
3555,I,a stout person to be angry. Apoplexy or something might ensue and
3556,I,death would be instantaneous and cemeteries the price they are in
3557,I,Glasnevin and all: but the children shouldn't have eaten all the jam at

3567,I,"no matter, God is good, and we can't live for ever."""
3568,I,
3569,I,The four seconds of silence which followed was broken by the lover--
3570,I,
3571,I,"""Is Julia Elizabeth in, ma'm?"" said he timidly."
3572,I,
3573,I,"""She's not, then,"" was the reply. ""We all have our trials, Mr."
3574,I,"O'Grady, and she's mine. I don't complain, but I don't deserve it, for"
3575,I,"a harder working woman never lived, but there you are."""
3576,I,
3577,I,"""I'm rather glad she's out,"" said the youth hastily, ""for I wanted to"

3596,I,delighted. He's in the next room making faces at a map. Maps are a

3860,II,
3861,II,"His mother finished reading the story of the Beautiful Princess, and it"
3862,II,was surely the saddest story he had ever heard. He could not bear to
3863,II,"think of that lovely and delicate lady all alone in the great, black"
3864,II,forest waiting until the giant came back from killing her seven brothers.
3865,II,He would return with their seven heads swinging pitifully from his
3866,II,"girdle, and, when he reached the castle gates, he would gnash his teeth"
3867,II,through the keyhole with a noise like the grinding together of great
3868,II,"rocks, and would poke his head through the fanlight of the door, and say,"
3869,II,fee-faw-fum in a voice of such exceeding loudness that the castle would
3870,II,be shaken to its foundation.
3871,II,
3872,II,"Thinking of this made his throat grow painful with emotion, and then his"
3873,II,"heart swelled to the most uncomfortable dimensions, and he resolved to"
3874,II,"devote his whole life to the rescue of the Princess, and, if necessary,"
3875,II,die in her defence.
3876,II,
3877,II,Such was his impatience that he could not wait for anything more than his
3878,II,"dinner, and this he ate so speedily that his father called him a"
3879,II,"Perfect-Young-Glutton, and a Disgrace-To-Any-Table. He bore these"
3880,II,"insults in a meek and heroic spirit, whereupon his mother said that he"
3881,II,"must be ill, and it was only by a violent and sustained outcry that he"
3882,II,escaped being sent to bed.
3883,II,
3884,II,Immediately after dinner he set out in search of the giant's castle. Now
3885,II,there is scarcely anything in the world more difficult to find than a
3886,II,"giant's castle, for it is so large that one can only see it through the"
3887,II,"wrong end of a telescope; and, furthermore, he did not even know this"
3888,II,giant's name. He might never have found the place if he had not met a
3889,II,certain old woman on the common.
3890,II,
3891,II,"She was a very nice old woman. She had three teeth, a red shawl, and an"
3892,II,umbrella with groceries inside it; so he told her of the difficulty he
3893,II,was in.
3894,II,
3895,II,"She replied that he was in luck's way, and that she was the only person"
3896,II,in the world who could assist him. She said her name was
3897,II,"Really-and-Truly, and that she had a magic head, and that if he cut her"
3898,II,head off it would answer any questions he asked it. So he stropped his
3899,II,"penknife on his boot, and said he was ready if she was."
3900,II,
3901,II,The old woman then informed him that in all affairs of this delicate
3902,II,"nature it was customary to take the will for the deed, and that he might"
3903,II,now ask her head anything he wanted to know--so he asked the head what
3904,II,"was the way to the nearest giant, and the head replied that if he took"
3905,II,"the first turning to the left, the second to the right, and then the"
3906,II,"first to the left again, and if he then knocked at the fifth door on the"
3907,II,"right-hand side, he would see the giant."
3908,II,
3909,II,"He thanked the old woman very much for the use of her head, and she"
3910,II,"permitted him to lend her one threepenny-piece, one pocket-handkerchief,"
3911,II,"one gun-metal watch, one cap, and one boot-lace. She said that she never"
3912,II,"took two of anything, because that was not fair, and that she wanted"
3913,II,"these for a very particular, secret purpose, about which she dare not"
3914,II,"speak, and, as to which she trusted he would not press her, and then she"
3915,II,took a most affectionate leave of him and went away.
3916,II,
3917,II,"He followed her directions with the utmost fidelity, and soon found"
3918,II,"himself opposite a house which, to the eyes of any one over seven years"
3919,II,"of age, looked very like any other house, but which, to the searching eye"
3920,II,"of six and three quarters, was patently and palpably a giant's castle."
3921,II,
3922,II,"He tried the door, but it was locked, as, indeed, he had expected it"
3923,II,"would be. Then he crept very cautiously, and peeped through the first"
3924,II,floor window. He could see in quite plainly. There was a polar bear
3925,II,"crouching on the floor, and the head looked at him so directly and"
3926,II,vindictively that if he had not been a hero he would have fled. The
3927,II,"unexpected is always terrible, and when one goes forth to kill a giant it"
3928,II,is unkind of Providence to complicate one's adventure with a gratuitous
3929,II,"and wholly unnecessary polar bear. He was, however, reassured by the"
3930,II,"sight of a heavy chair standing on the polar bear's stomach, and in the"
3931,II,chair there sat the most beautiful woman in the world.
3932,II,
3933,II,An ordinary person would not have understood so instantly that she was
3934,II,"the most beautiful woman in the world, because she looked very stout, and"
3935,II,much older than is customary with princesses--but that was owing to the
3936,II,"fact that she was under an enchantment, and she would become quite young"
3937,II,again when the giant was slain and three drops of his blood had been
3938,II,sprinkled on her brow.
3939,II,
3940,II,"She was leaning forward in the chair, staring into the fire, and she was"
3941,II,so motionless that it was quite plain she must be under an enchantment.
3942,II,"From the very first instant he saw the princess he loved her, and his"
3943,II,heart swelled with pity to think that so beautiful a damsel should be
3944,II,subjected to the tyranny of a giant. These twin passions of pity and
3945,II,love grew to so furious a strength within him that he could no longer
3946,II,contain himself. He wept in a loud and very sudden voice which lifted
3947,II,"the damsel out of her enchantment and her chair, and hurled her across"
3948,II,the room as though she had been propelled by a powerful spring.
3949,II,
3950,II,He was so overjoyed at seeing her move that he pressed his face against
3951,II,"the glass and wept with great strength, and, in a few moments, the"
3952,II,princess came timidly to the window and looked out. She looked right
3953,II,"over his head at first, and then she looked down and saw him, and her"
3954,II,"eyebrows went far up on her forehead, and her mouth opened; and so he"
3955,II,"knew that she was delighted to see him. He nodded to give her courage,"
3956,II,"and shouted three times, ""Open Sesame, Open Sesame, Open Sesame,"" and"
3957,II,then she opened the window and he climbed in.
3958,II,
3959,II,"The princess tried to push him out again, but she was not able, and he"
3960,II,bade her put all her jewels in the heel of her boot and fly with him.
3961,II,"But she was evidently the victim of a very powerful enchantment, for she"
3962,II,"struggled violently, and said incomprehensible things to him, such as ""Is"
3963,II,"it a fire, or were you chased?"" and ""Where is the cook?"" But after a"
3964,II,"little time she listened to the voice of reason, and recognised that"
3965,II,these were legitimate and heroic embraces from which she could not
3966,II,honourably disentangle herself.
3967,II,
3968,II,When her first transports of joy were somewhat abated she assured him
3969,II,"that excessive haste had often undone great schemes, and that one should"
3970,II,"always look before one leaped, and that one should never be rescued all"
3971,II,"at once, but gradually, in order that one might become accustomed to the"
3972,II,severe air of freedom--and he was overjoyed to find that she was as wise
3973,II,as she was beautiful.
3974,II,
3975,II,"He told her that he loved her dearly, and she admitted, after some"
3976,II,"persuasion, that she was not insensible to the charms of his heart and"
3977,II,"intellect, but she confessed that her love was given to another."
3978,II,
3979,II,"At these tidings his heart withered away within him, and when the"
3980,II,princess admitted she loved the giant his amazement became profound and
3981,II,complicated. There was a rushing sound in his ears. The debris of his
3982,II,"well-known world was crashing about him, and he was staring upon a new"
3983,II,"planet, the name of which was Incredulity. He looked round with a queer"
3984,II,feeling of insecurity. At any moment the floor might stand up on one of
3985,II,"its corners, or the walls might begin to flap and waggle. But none of"
3986,II,these things happened. Before him sat the princess in an attitude of
3987,II,"deep dejection, and her lily-white hands rested helplessly on her lap."
3988,II,She told him in a voice that trembled that she would have married him if
3989,II,"he had asked her ten years earlier, and urged that she could not fly with"
3990,II,"him now, because, in the first place, she had six children, and, in the"
3991,II,"second place, it would be against the law, and, in the third place, his"
3992,II,"mother might object. She admitted that she was unworthy of his love, and"
3993,II,"that she should have waited, and she bore his reproaches with a meekness"
3994,II,which finally disarmed him.
3995,II,
3996,II,"He stropped his penknife on his boot, and said that there was nothing"
3997,II,"left but to kill the giant, and that she had better leave the room while"
3998,II,"he did so, because it would not be a sight for a weak woman, and he"
3999,II,wondered audibly how much hasty-pudding would fall out of the giant if he
4000,II,stabbed him right to the heart. The princess begged him not to kill her
4001,II,"husband, and assured him that this giant had not got any hasty-pudding in"
4002,II,"his heart at all, and that he was really the nicest giant that ever"
4003,II,"lived, and, further, that he had not killed her seven brothers, but the"
4004,II,"seven brothers of quite another person entirely, which was only a"
4005,II,"reasonable thing to do when one looked at it properly, and she continued"
4006,II,in a strain which proved to him that this unnatural woman really loved
4007,II,the giant.
4008,II,
4009,II,It was more in pity than in anger that he recognised the impossibility of
4010,II,rescuing this person. He saw at last that she was unworthy of being
4011,II,"rescued, and told her so. He said bitterly that he had grave doubts of"
4012,II,"her being a princess at all, and that if she was married to a giant it"
4013,II,"was no more than she deserved, and further he had a good mind to rescue"
4014,II,"the giant from her, and he would do so in a minute, only that it was"
4015,II,"against his principles to rescue giants.--And, saying so, he placed his"
4016,II,penknife between his teeth and climbed out through the window again.
4017,II,
4018,II,He stood for a moment outside the window with his right hand extended to
4019,II,the sky and the moonlight blazing on his penknife--a truly formidable
4020,II,"figure, and one which the princess never forgot; and then he walked"
4021,II,"slowly away, hiding behind a cold and impassive demeanour a mind that was"
4022,II,tortured and a heart that had plumbed most of the depths of human
4023,II,suffering.
4024,II,
4025,II,
4026,III,III
4027,III,
4028,III,Aloysius Murphy went a-courting when the woods were green. There were
4029,III,grapes in the air and birds in the river. A voice and a song went
4030,III,"everywhere, and the voice said, ""Where is my beloved?"" and the song"
4031,III,"replied, ""Thy beloved is awaiting thee, and she stretches her hands"
4032,III,abroad and laughs for thy coming; bind then the feather of a bird to
4033,III,"thy heel and a red rose upon thy hair, and go quickly."""
4034,III,
4035,III,So he took his hat from behind the door and his stick from beside the
4036,III,bed and went out into the evening.
4037,III,
4038,III,"He had been engaged to Miss Nora MacMahon for two ecstatic months, and"
4039,III,held the opinion that the earth and the heavens were aware of the
4040,III,"intensity of his passion, and applauded the unique justice of his"
4041,III,choice.
4042,III,
4043,III,"By day he sat humbly in a solicitor's office, or scurried through the"
4044,III,"thousand offices of the Four Courts, but with night came freedom, and"
4045,III,he felt himself to be of the kindred of the gods and marched in pomp.
4046,III,By what subterranean workings had he become familiar with the lady?
4047,III,Suffice it that the impossible is possible to a lover. Everything can
4048,III,be achieved in time. The man who wishes to put a mountain in his
4049,III,pocket can do so if his pocket and his wish be of the requisite
4050,III,magnitude.
4051,III,
4052,III,Now the lady towards whom the raging torrent of his affections had been
4053,III,"directed was the daughter of his employer, and this, while it notated"
4054,III,"romance, pointed also to tragedy. Further, while this fact was well"
4055,III,"within his knowledge, it was far from the cognizance of the lady. He"
4056,III,"would have enlightened her on the point, but the longer he delayed the"
4057,III,"revelation, the more difficult did it become. Perpetually his tongue"
4058,III,ached to utter the truth. When he might be squeezing her hand or
4059,III,"plunging his glance into the depths of her eyes, consciousness would"
4060,III,"touch him on the shoulder with a bony hand and say, ""That is the boss's"
4061,III,"daughter you are hugging""--a reminder which was provocative sometimes"
4062,III,"of an almost unholy delight, when to sing and dance and go mad was but"
4063,III,"natural; but at other times it brought with it moods of woe, abysses of"
4064,III,blackness.
4065,III,
4066,III,In the solitude of the room wherein he lodged he sometimes indulged in
4067,III,"a small drama, wherein, as the hero, he would smile a slightly sad and"
4068,III,"quizzical smile, and say gently, ""Child, you are Mr. MacMahon's"
4069,III,"daughter, I am but his clerk""--here the smile became more sadly"
4070,III,"quizzical--""how can I ask you to forsake the luxury of a residence in"
4071,III,"Clontarf for the uncongenial, nay, bleak surroundings of a South"
4072,III,"Circular Road habitation?"" And she, ah me! She vowed that a hut and a"
4073,III,crust and the love of her heart. . .! No matter!
4074,III,
4075,III,"So, nightly, Aloysius Murphy took the tram to Clontarf, and there,"
4076,III,"wide-coated and sombreroed like a mediaeval conspirator, he trod"
4077,III,"delicately beside his cloaked and hooded inamorata, whispering of the"
4078,III,spice of the wind and the great stretches of the sea.
4079,III,
4080,III,"Now a lover who comes with the shades of night, harbinger of the moon,"
4081,III,"and hand in glove with the stars, must be a very romantic person"
4082,III,"indeed, and, even if he is not, a lady whose years are tender can"
4083,III,easily supply the necessary gauze to tone down his too-rigorous
4084,III,projections. But the bird that flies by night must adduce for our
4085,III,curiosity substantial reason why his flight has deserted the whiteness
4086,III,of the daytime; else we may be tempted to believe that his advent in
4087,III,darkness is thus shrouded for even duskier purposes.--Miss MacMahon had
4088,III,"begun to inquire who Mr. Murphy was, and he had, accordingly, begun to"
4089,III,explain who he was not. This explanation had wrapped his identity in
4090,III,"the most labyrinthine mystery, but Miss MacMahon detected in the rapid,"
4091,III,incomprehensible fluctuations of his story a heart torn by unmerited
4092,III,"misfortune, and whose agony could only be alleviated by laying her own"
4093,III,dear head against its turmoil.
4094,III,
4095,III,"To a young girl a confidant is almost as necessary as a lover, and when"
4096,III,"the rendezvous is clandestine, the youth mysterious, and his hat"
4097,III,"broad-leafed and flapping, then the necessity for a confidant becomes"
4098,III,imperative.
4099,III,
4100,III,Miss MacMahon confided the knowledge of all her happiness to the
4101,III,"thrilled ear of her younger sister, who at once hugged her, and bubbled"
4102,III,"query, conjecture, and admonishment. "". . . Long or short? . . ."
4103,III,"Dark or fair?"" "". . . and slender . . . with eyes . . . dove . . ."
4104,III,lightning . . . hair . . . and so gentle . . . and then I said . . .
4105,III,"and then he said . . .!"" ""Oh, sweet!"" sighed the younger sister, and"
4106,III,she stretched her arms wide and crushed the absent excellences of Mr.
4107,III,Murphy to her youthful breast.
4108,III,
4109,III,"On returning next day from church, having listened awe-stricken to a"
4110,III,"sermon on filial obedience, the little sister bound her mother to"
4111,III,"secrecy, told the story, and said she wished she were dead."
4112,III,"Subsequently the father of Clann MacMahon was informed, and he said"
4113,III,"""Hum"" and ""Ha,"" and rolled a fierce, hard eye, and many times during"
4114,III,the progress of the narrative he interjected with furious energy these
4115,III,"words, ""Don't be a fool, Jane,"" and Mrs. MacMahon responded meekly,"
4116,III,"""Yes, dear,"" and Mr. MacMahon then said ""Hum"" and ""Ha"" and ""Gr-r-r-up"""
4117,III,in a truly terrible and ogreish manner; and in her distant chamber Miss
4118,III,"MacMahon heard the reverberation of that sonorous grunt, and whispered"
4119,III,"to her little sister, ""Pa's in a wax,"" and the little sister pretended"
4120,III,to be asleep.
4121,III,
4122,III,"The spectacle of an elderly gentleman, side-whiskered, precise and"
4123,III,"grey, disguising himself with mufflers and a squash hat, and stalking"
4124,III,with sombre fortitude the erratic wanderings of a pair of young
4125,III,"featherheads, is one which mirth may be pleased to linger upon. Such a"
4126,III,spectacle was now to be observed in the semi-rural outskirts of
4127,III,"Clontarf. Mr. MacMahon tracked his daughter with considerable stealth,"
4128,III,adopting unconsciously the elongated and nervous stride of a theatrical
4129,III,"villain. He saw her meet a young man wearing a broad-brimmed hat,"
4130,III,"whose clothing was mysteriously theatrical, and whose general shape,"
4131,III,"when it could be glimpsed, was oddly familiar."
4132,III,
4133,III,"""I have seen that fellow somewhere,"" said he."
4134,III,
4135,III,"The lovers met and kissed, and the glaring father spoke rapidly but"
4136,III,"softly to himself for a few moments. He was not accustomed to walking,"
4137,III,"and it appeared as if these two intended to walk for ever, but he kept"
4138,III,"them in sight, and when the time came for parting he was close at hand."
4139,III,
4140,III,"The parting was prolonged, and renewed, and rehearsed again with"
4141,III,amendments and additions: he could not have believed that saying
4142,III,good-bye to a person could be turned into so complicated and symbolic a
4143,III,"ceremony: but, at last, his daughter, with many a backward look and"
4144,III,"wave of hand, departed in one direction, and the gentleman, after"
4145,III,"similar signals, moved towards the tramway."
4146,III,
4147,III,"""I know that fellow, whoever he is,"" said Mr. MacMahon."
4148,III,
4149,III,"Passing a lamp-post, Mr. Aloysius Murphy stayed for a moment to light"
4150,III,"his pipe, and Mr. MacMahon stared, he ground his teeth, he foamed at"
4151,III,"the mouth, and his already prominent eyes bulged still further and"
4152,III,rounder--
4153,III,
4154,III,"""Well, I'm----!"" said he."
4155,III,
4156,III,"He turned and walked homewards slowly, murmuring often to himself and"
4157,III,"to the night, ""All right! wait, though! Hum! Ha! Gr-r-r-up!"""
4158,III,
4159,III,"That night he repeatedly entreated his wife ""not to be a fool, Jane,"""
4160,III,"and she as repeatedly replied, ""Yes, dear."" Long after midnight he"
4161,III,awoke her by roaring violently from the very interior depths of a
4162,III,"dream, ""Cheek of the fellow! Pup! Gr-r-r-up!"""
4163,III,
4164,III,At breakfast on the following morning he suggested to his wife and
4165,III,elder daughter that they should visit his office later on in the day--
4166,III,
4167,III,"""You have never seen it, Nora,"" said he, ""and you ought to have a look"
4168,III,at the den where your poor old daddy spends his time grinding dress
4169,III,material for his family from the faces of the poor. I've got some
4170,III,"funny clerks, too: one of them is a curiosity."" Here, growing suddenly"
4171,III,"furious, he gave an egg a clout."
4172,III,
4173,III,His daughter giggled--
4174,III,
4175,III,"""Oh, Pa,"" said she, ""you are not breaking that egg, you are murdering"
4176,III,"it."""
4177,III,
4178,III,He looked at her gloomily--
4179,III,
4180,III,"""It wasn't the egg I was hitting,"" said he. ""Gr-r-r-up,"" said he"
4181,III,"suddenly, and he stabbed a piece of butter, squashed it to death on a"
4182,III,"slice of bread, and tore it to pieces with his teeth."
4183,III,
4184,III,"The young lady looked at him with some amazement, but she said nothing,"
4185,III,"for she believed, as most ladies do, that men are a little mad"
4186,III,"sometimes, and are foolish always."
4187,III,
4188,III,"Her father intercepted that glance, and instantly snarled--"
4189,III,
4190,III,"""Can you cook, young woman?"" said he."
4191,III,
4192,III,"""Of course, father,"" replied the perplexed maiden."
4193,III,
4194,III,He laid aside his spoon and gave her his full attention.
4195,III,
4196,III,"""Can you cook potatoes?"" said he. ""Can you mash 'em, eh? Can you mash"
4197,III,"'em? What! You can. They call them Murphies in this country, girl."
4198,III,"Can you mash Murphys, eh? I can. There's a Murphy I know, and,"
4199,III,"although it's been mashed already, by the Lord Harry, I'll mash it"
4200,III,"again. Did you ever know that potatoes had eyes, miss? Did you ever"
4201,III,notice it when you were cooking them? Did you ever look into the eyes
4202,III,"of a Murphy, eh? When you mashed it, what? Don't answer me, girl."""
4203,III,
4204,III,"""I don't know what you are talking about, Pa,"" said the young lady."
4205,III,
4206,III,"""Don't you, now?"" grinned the furious gentleman, and his bulging eyes"
4207,III,"looked like little round balls of glass. ""Who said you did, miss?"
4208,III,"Gr-r-r-up,"" said he, and the poor girl jumped as though she had been"
4209,III,prodded with a pin.
4210,III,
4211,III,Mr. Aloysius Murphy's activities began at ten o'clock in the morning by
4212,III,opening the office letters with an ivory instrument and handing them to
4213,III,"his employer; then, as each letter was read, he entered its receipt and"
4214,III,date in a book kept for that purpose.
4215,III,
4216,III,When Mr. MacMahon came in on the morning following the occurrences I
4217,III,"have detailed he neglected, for the first time in many years, to"
4218,III,respond to his clerk's respectfully-cordial salutation. To the
4219,III,"discreet ""Good-morning, sir,"" he vouchsafed no reply. Mr. Murphy was a"
4220,III,"trifle indignant and a good deal perturbed, for to an unquiet"
4221,III,"conscience a word or the lack of it is a goad. Once or twice, looking"
4222,III,"up from his book, he discovered his employer's hard eyes fixed upon him"
4223,III,with a regard too particular to be pleasant.
4224,III,
4225,III,"An employer seldom does more than glance at his clerk, just the"
4226,III,sideward glint of a look which remarks his presence without admitting
4227,III,"his necessity, and in return the clerk slants a hurried eye on his"
4228,III,"employer, notes swiftly if his aspect be sulky or benign, and stays his"
4229,III,"vision at that. But, now, Mr. Murphy, with sudden trepidation, with a"
4230,III,"frightful sinking in the pit of his stomach, became aware that his"
4231,III,"employer was looking at him stealthily; and, little by little, he took"
4232,III,to sneaking glances at his employer. After a few moments neither
4233,III,seemed to be able to keep his eyes from straying--they created
4234,III,"opportunities in connection with the letters; the one looking intent,"
4235,III,"wide-eyed, and with a cold, frigid, rigid, hard stare, and the other"
4236,III,"scurrying and furtive, in-and-away, hit-and-miss-and-try-again, wink,"
4237,III,"blink, and twitter."
4238,III,
4239,III,Mr. MacMahon spoke--
4240,III,
4241,III,"""Murphy!"""
4242,III,
4243,III,"""Yes, sir."""
4244,III,
4245,III,"""Have you anything in Court to-day?"""
4246,III,
4247,III,"""Yes, sir, an ex parte application, Donald and Cluggs."""
4248,III,
4249,III,"""Let O'Neill attend to it. I shall want you to draft a deed for some"
4250,III,ladies who will call here at noon. You can come down at ten minutes
4251,III,"after twelve."""
4252,III,
4253,III,"""Yes, sir,"" said Murphy."
4254,III,
4255,III,He grabbed his share of the letters and got to the door bathed in
4256,III,"perspiration and forebodings. He closed the door softly behind him,"
4257,III,"and stood for a few seconds staring at the handle. ""Blow you!"" said he"
4258,III,"viciously to nothing in particular, and he went slowly upstairs."
4259,III,
4260,III,"""He can't know,"" said he on the first landing. On the second floor he"
4261,III,"thought, ""She couldn't have told for she didn't know herself."" He"
4262,III,"reached his desk. ""I wish I had a half of whisky,"" said the young man"
4263,III,to himself.
4264,III,
4265,III,"Before, however, twelve o'clock arrived he had journeyed on the hopeful"
4266,III,"pinions of youth from the dogmatic ""could not be"" to the equally"
4267,III,"immovable ""is not,"" and his mind resumed its interrupted equilibrium."
4268,III,
4269,III,"At twelve o'clock Mrs. and Miss MacMahon arrived, and were at once"
4270,III,"shown into the private office. At ten minutes past, Mr. Murphy's"
4271,III,"respectful tap was heard. ""Don't, Eddie,"" said Mrs. MacMahon in a"
4272,III,"queer, flurried voice. ""Come in,"" said her husband. Nora was"
4273,III,examining some judicial cartoons pinned over the mantelpiece. Mr.
4274,III,"Murphy opened the door a few inches, slid through the aperture, and was"
4275,III,"at once caught and held by his employer's eye, which, like a hand,"
4276,III,guided him to the table with his notebook. Under the almost physical
4277,III,pressure of that authoritative glare he did not dare to look who was in
4278,III,"the room, but the rim of his eye saw the movement of a skirt like the"
4279,III,"far-away, shadowy canter of a ghost's robe. He fixed his attention on"
4280,III,his note-book.
4281,III,
4282,III,Mr. MacMahon began to dictate a Deed of Conveyance from a precedent
4283,III,deed in his hand. After dictating for some few minutes--
4284,III,
4285,III,"""Murphy,"" said he, and at the word the young lady studying the cartoons"
4286,III,"stiffened, ""I've rather lost the thread of that clause; please read"
4287,III,"what you have down."""
4288,III,
4289,III,"Murphy began to read, and, at the first word, the girl made a tiny,"
4290,III,"shrill, mouse's noise, and then stood stock-still, tightened up and"
4291,III,"frightened, with her two wild eyes trying to peep around her ears."
4292,III,
4293,III,Mr. Murphy heard the noise and faltered--he knew instinctively.
4294,III,Something told him with the bellowing assurance of a cannon who was
4295,III,there. He must look. He forced his slack face past the granite image
4296,III,"that was his employer, saw a serge-clad figure that he knew, one ear"
4297,III,and the curve of a cheek. Then a cascade broke inside his head. It
4298,III,"buzzed and chattered and crashed, with now and again the blank"
4299,III,brutality of thunder bashing through the noise. The serge-clad figure
4300,III,"swelled suddenly to a tremendous magnitude, and then it receded just as"
4301,III,"swiftly, and the vast earth spun minutely on a pin's point ten million"
4302,III,"miles away, and she was behind it, her eyes piercing with scorn. . . ."
4303,III,Through the furious winds that whirled about his brain he heard a
4304,III,"whisper, thin and cold, and insistent as a razor's edge, ""Go on,"
4305,III,"Murphy; go on, Murphy."" He strove to fix his attention on his"
4306,III,"shorthand notes--To fight it down, to stand the shock like a man, and"
4307,III,"then crawl into a hole somewhere and die; but his mind would not grip,"
4308,III,nor his eyes focus. The only words which his empty brain could pump up
4309,III,"were these, irrelevant and idiotic, ""'A frog he would a-wooing go,"
4310,III,"heigho,' said Rowley""; and they must not be said. ""It is a bit"
4311,III,"difficult, perhaps,"" said the whispering voice that crept through the"
4312,III,"tumult of winds and waters in his head. ""Never mind, take down the"
4313,III,"rest of it,"" and the far-away whisper began to say things all about"
4314,III,"nothing, making queer little noises and pauses, running for a moment"
4315,III,"into a ripple of sound, and eddying and dying away and coming back"
4316,III,again--buz-z-z! His notebook lying on the table was as small as a
4317,III,"postage stamp, while the pencil in his hand was as big as an elephant's"
4318,III,leg. How can a man write on a microscopic blur with the stump of a fir
4319,III,"tree? He poked and prodded, and Mr. MacMahon watched for a few moments"
4320,III,his clerk poking his note-book with the wrong end of a pencil. He
4321,III,silently pulled his daughter forward and made her look. After a
4322,III,little--
4323,III,
4324,III,"""That will do, Murphy,"" said he, and Mr. Murphy, before he got out,"
4325,III,made two severe attempts to walk through a wall.
4326,III,
4327,III,"For half an hour he sat at his desk in a trance, with his eyes fixed"
4328,III,"upon an ink-bottle. At last, nodding his head slowly--"
4329,III,
4330,III,"""I'll bet you a shilling,"" said he to the ink-bottle, ""that I get the"
4331,III,"sack to-night."""
4332,III,
4333,III,And the ink-bottle lost the wager.

4338,THE BLIND MAN,THE BLIND MAN
4339,THE BLIND MAN,
4340,THE BLIND MAN,He was one who would have passed by the Sphinx without seeing it. He
4341,THE BLIND MAN,"did not believe in the necessity for sphinxes, or in their reality, for"
4342,THE BLIND MAN,"that matter--they did not exist for him. Indeed, he was one to whom"
4343,THE BLIND MAN,the Sphinx would not have been visible. He might have eyed it and
4344,THE BLIND MAN,"noted a certain bulk of grotesque stone, but nothing more significant."
4345,THE BLIND MAN,
4346,THE BLIND MAN,"He was sex-blind, and, so, peculiarly limited by the fact that he could"
4347,THE BLIND MAN,not appreciate women. If he had been pressed for a theory or
4348,THE BLIND MAN,metaphysic of womanhood he would have been unable to formulate any.
4349,THE BLIND MAN,"Their presence he admitted, perforce: their utility was quite apparent"
4350,THE BLIND MAN,"to him on the surface, but, subterraneously, he doubted both their"
4351,THE BLIND MAN,existence and their utility. He might have said perplexedly--Why
4352,THE BLIND MAN,cannot they do whatever they have to do without being always in the
4353,THE BLIND MAN,"way? He might have said--Hang it, they are everywhere and what good"
4354,THE BLIND MAN,"are they doing? They bothered him, they destroyed his ease when he was"
4355,THE BLIND MAN,"near them, and they spoke a language which he did not understand and"
4356,THE BLIND MAN,did not want to understand. But as his limitations did not press on
4357,THE BLIND MAN,"him neither did they trouble him. He was not sexually deficient, and"
4358,THE BLIND MAN,"he did not dislike women; he simply ignored them, and was only really"
4359,THE BLIND MAN,at home with men. All the crudities which we enumerate as masculine
4360,THE BLIND MAN,"delighted him--simple things, for, in the gender of abstract ideas,"
4361,THE BLIND MAN,"vice is feminine, brutality is masculine, the female being older,"
4362,THE BLIND MAN,"vastly older than the male, much more competent in every way, stronger,"
4363,THE BLIND MAN,"even in her physique, than he, and, having little baggage of mental or"
4364,THE BLIND MAN,"ethical preoccupations to delay her progress, she is still the guardian"
4365,THE BLIND MAN,"of evolution, requiring little more from man than to be stroked and"
4366,THE BLIND MAN,petted for a while.
4367,THE BLIND MAN,
4368,THE BLIND MAN,He could be brutal at times. He liked to get drunk at seasonable
4369,THE BLIND MAN,"periods. He would cheerfully break a head or a window, and would"
4370,THE BLIND MAN,bandage the one damage or pay for the other with equal skill and
4371,THE BLIND MAN,pleasure. He liked to tramp rugged miles swinging his arms and
4372,THE BLIND MAN,"whistling as he went, and he could sit for hours by the side of a ditch"
4373,THE BLIND MAN,thinking thoughts without words--an easy and a pleasant way of
4374,THE BLIND MAN,"thinking, and one which may lead to something in the long run."
4375,THE BLIND MAN,
4376,THE BLIND MAN,Even his mother was an abstraction to him. He was kind to her so far
4377,THE BLIND MAN,"as doing things went, but he looked over her, or round her, and marched"
4378,THE BLIND MAN,away and forgot her.
4379,THE BLIND MAN,
4380,THE BLIND MAN,Sex-blindness carries with it many other darknesses. We do not know
4381,THE BLIND MAN,"what masculine thing is projected by the feminine consciousness, and"
4382,THE BLIND MAN,"civilisation, even life itself, must stand at a halt until that has"
4383,THE BLIND MAN,"been discovered or created, but art is the female projected by the"
4384,THE BLIND MAN,"male: science is the male projected by the male--as yet a poor thing,"
4385,THE BLIND MAN,"and to remain so until it has become art; that is, has become"
4386,THE BLIND MAN,fertilised and so more psychological than mechanical. The small part
4387,THE BLIND MAN,"of science which came to his notice (inventions, machinery, etc.) was"
4388,THE BLIND MAN,easily and delightedly comprehended by him. He could do intricate
4389,THE BLIND MAN,"things with a knife and a piece of string, or a hammer and a saw: but a"
4390,THE BLIND MAN,"picture, a poem, a statue, a piece of music--these left him as"
4391,THE BLIND MAN,"uninterested as they found him: more so, in truth, for they left him"
4392,THE BLIND MAN,bored and dejected.
4393,THE BLIND MAN,
4394,THE BLIND MAN,"His mother came to dislike him, and there were many causes and many"
4395,THE BLIND MAN,"justifications for her dislike. She was an orderly, busy, competent"
4396,THE BLIND MAN,"woman, the counterpart of endless millions of her sex, who liked to"
4397,THE BLIND MAN,"understand what she saw or felt, and who had no happiness in reading"
4398,THE BLIND MAN,"riddles. To her he was at times an enigma, and at times again a"
4399,THE BLIND MAN,simpleton. In both aspects he displeased and embarrassed her. One has
4400,THE BLIND MAN,"one's sense of property, and in him she could not put her finger on"
4401,THE BLIND MAN,"anything that was hers. We demand continuity, logic in other words,"
4402,THE BLIND MAN,"but between her son and herself there was a gulf fixed, spanned by no"
4403,THE BLIND MAN,bridge whatever; there was complete isolation; no boat plied between
4404,THE BLIND MAN,them at all. All the kindly human things which she loved were
4405,THE BLIND MAN,"unintelligible to him, and his coarse pleasures or blunt evasions"
4406,THE BLIND MAN,distressed and bewildered her. When she spoke to him he gaped or
4407,THE BLIND MAN,"yawned; and yet she did not speak on weighty matters, just the"
4408,THE BLIND MAN,"necessary small-change of existence--somebody's cold, somebody's dress,"
4409,THE BLIND MAN,somebody's marriage or death. When she addressed him on sterner
4410,THE BLIND MAN,"subjects, the ground, the weather, the crops, he looked at her as if"
4411,THE BLIND MAN,"she were a baby, he listened with stubborn resentment, and strode away"
4412,THE BLIND MAN,"a confessed boor. There was no contact anywhere between them, and he"
4413,THE BLIND MAN,was a slow exasperation to her.--What can we do with that which is ours
4414,THE BLIND MAN,"and not ours? either we own a thing or we do not, and, whichever way it"
4415,THE BLIND MAN,"goes, there is some end to it; but certain enigmas are illegitimate and"
4416,THE BLIND MAN,are so hounded from decent cogitation.
4417,THE BLIND MAN,
4418,THE BLIND MAN,"She could do nothing but dismiss him, and she could not even do that,"
4419,THE BLIND MAN,"for there he was at the required periods, always primed with the wrong"
4420,THE BLIND MAN,"reply to any question, the wrong aspiration, the wrong conjecture; a"
4421,THE BLIND MAN,"perpetual trampler on mental corns, a person for whom one could do"
4422,THE BLIND MAN,nothing but apologise.
4423,THE BLIND MAN,
4424,THE BLIND MAN,They lived on a small farm and almost the entire work of the place was
4425,THE BLIND MAN,"done by him. His younger brother assisted, but that assistance could"
4426,THE BLIND MAN,have easily been done without. If the cattle were sick he cured them
4427,THE BLIND MAN,almost by instinct. If the horse was lame or wanted a new shoe he knew
4428,THE BLIND MAN,precisely what to do in both events. When the time came for ploughing
4429,THE BLIND MAN,he gripped the handles and drove a furrow which was as straight and as
4430,THE BLIND MAN,economical as any furrow in the world. He could dig all day long and
4431,THE BLIND MAN,be happy; he gathered in the harvest as another would gather in a
4432,THE BLIND MAN,"bride; and, in the intervals between these occupations, he fled to the"
4433,THE BLIND MAN,nearest publichouse and wallowed among his kind.
4434,THE BLIND MAN,
4435,THE BLIND MAN,He did not fly away to drink; he fled to be among men.--Then he
4436,THE BLIND MAN,"awakened. His tongue worked with the best of them, and adequately too."
4437,THE BLIND MAN,"He could speak weightily on many things--boxing, wrestling, hunting,"
4438,THE BLIND MAN,"fishing, the seasons, the weather, and the chances of this and the"
4439,THE BLIND MAN,other man's crops. He had deep knowledge about brands of tobacco and
4440,THE BLIND MAN,the peculiar virtues of many different liquors. He knew birds and
4441,THE BLIND MAN,beetles and worms; how a weazel would behave in extraordinary
4442,THE BLIND MAN,circumstances; how to train every breed of horse and dog. He recited
4443,THE BLIND MAN,"goats from the cradle to the grave, could tell the name of any tree"
4444,THE BLIND MAN,"from its leaf; knew how a bull could be coerced, a cow cut up, and what"
4445,THE BLIND MAN,"plasters were good for a broken head. Sometimes, and often enough, the"
4446,THE BLIND MAN,"talk would chance on women, and then he laughed as heartily as any one"
4447,THE BLIND MAN,"else, but he was always relieved when the conversation trailed to more"
4448,THE BLIND MAN,interesting things.
4449,THE BLIND MAN,
4450,THE BLIND MAN,His mother died and left the farm to the younger instead of the elder
4451,THE BLIND MAN,"son; an unusual thing to do, but she did detest him. She knew her"
4452,THE BLIND MAN,younger son very well. He was foreign to her in nothing. His temper
4453,THE BLIND MAN,"ran parallel with her own, his tastes were hers, his ideas had been"
4454,THE BLIND MAN,"largely derived from her, she could track them at any time and make or"
4455,THE BLIND MAN,demolish him. He would go to a dance or a picnic and be as exhilarated
4456,THE BLIND MAN,"as she was, and would discuss the matter afterwards. He could speak"
4457,THE BLIND MAN,"with some cogency on the shape of this and that female person, the hat"
4458,THE BLIND MAN,"of such an one, the disagreeableness of tea at this house and the"
4459,THE BLIND MAN,goodness of it at the other. He could even listen to one speaking
4460,THE BLIND MAN,"without going to sleep at the fourth word. In all he was a decent,"
4461,THE BLIND MAN,"quiet lad who would become a father the exact replica of his own, and"
4462,THE BLIND MAN,whose daughters would resemble his mother as closely as two peas
4463,THE BLIND MAN,resemble their green ancestors.--So she left him the farm.
4464,THE BLIND MAN,
4465,THE BLIND MAN,"Of course, there was no attempt to turn the elder brother out. Indeed,"
4466,THE BLIND MAN,for some years the two men worked quietly together and prospered and
4467,THE BLIND MAN,"were contented; then, as was inevitable, the younger brother got"
4468,THE BLIND MAN,"married, and the elder had to look out for a new place to live in, and"
4469,THE BLIND MAN,to work in--things had become difficult.
4470,THE BLIND MAN,
4471,THE BLIND MAN,It is very easy to say that in such and such circumstances a man should
4472,THE BLIND MAN,"do this and that well-pondered thing, but the courts of logic have as"
4473,THE BLIND MAN,yet the most circumscribed jurisdiction. Just as statistics can prove
4474,THE BLIND MAN,"anything and be quite wrong, so reason can sit in its padded chair"
4475,THE BLIND MAN,issuing pronouncements which are seldom within measurable distance of
4476,THE BLIND MAN,any reality. Everything is true only in relation to its centre of
4477,THE BLIND MAN,thought. Some people think with their heads--their subsequent actions
4478,THE BLIND MAN,are as logical and unpleasant as are those of the other sort who think
4479,THE BLIND MAN,"only with their blood, and this latter has its irrefutable logic also."
4480,THE BLIND MAN,"He thought in this subterranean fashion, and if he had thought in the"
4481,THE BLIND MAN,other the issue would not have been any different.
4482,THE BLIND MAN,
4483,THE BLIND MAN,"Still, it was not an easy problem for him, or for any person lacking"
4484,THE BLIND MAN,"initiative--a sexual characteristic. He might have emigrated, but his"
4485,THE BLIND MAN,"roots were deeply struck in his own place, so the idea never occurred"
4486,THE BLIND MAN,"to him; furthermore, our thoughts are often no deeper than our pockets,"
4487,THE BLIND MAN,and one wants money to move anywhere. For any other life than that of
4488,THE BLIND MAN,farming he had no training and small desire. He had no money and he
4489,THE BLIND MAN,was a farmer's son. Without money he could not get a farm; being a
4490,THE BLIND MAN,farmer's son he could not sink to the degradation of a day labourer;
4491,THE BLIND MAN,"logically he could sink, actually he could not without endangering his"
4492,THE BLIND MAN,own centres and verities--so he also got married.
4493,THE BLIND MAN,
4494,THE BLIND MAN,"He married a farm of about ten acres, and the sun began to shine on him"
4495,THE BLIND MAN,once more; but only for a few days. Suddenly the sun went away from
4496,THE BLIND MAN,the heavens; the moon disappeared from the silent night; the silent
4497,THE BLIND MAN,"night itself fled afar, leaving in its stead a noisy, dirty blackness"
4498,THE BLIND MAN,"through which one slept or yawned as one could. There was the farm, of"
4499,THE BLIND MAN,"course, one could go there and work; but the freshness went out of the"
4500,THE BLIND MAN,very ground; the crops lost their sweetness and candour; the horses and
4501,THE BLIND MAN,cows disowned him; the goats ceased to be his friends--It was all up
4502,THE BLIND MAN,with him. He did not whistle any longer. He did not swing his
4503,THE BLIND MAN,"shoulders as he walked, and, although he continued to smoke, he did not"
4504,THE BLIND MAN,look for a particular green bank whereon he could sit quietly flooded
4505,THE BLIND MAN,with those slow thoughts that had no words.
4506,THE BLIND MAN,
4507,THE BLIND MAN,For he discovered that he had not married a farm at all. He had
4508,THE BLIND MAN,"married a woman--a thin-jawed, elderly slattern, whose sole beauty was"
4509,THE BLIND MAN,her farm. How her jaws worked! The processions and congregations of
4510,THE BLIND MAN,words that fell and dribbled and slid out of them! Those jaws were
4511,THE BLIND MAN,"never quiet, and in spite of all he did not say anything. There was"
4512,THE BLIND MAN,"not anything to say, but much to do from which he shivered away in"
4513,THE BLIND MAN,"terror. He looked at her sometimes through the muscles of his arms,"
4514,THE BLIND MAN,"through his big, strong hands, through fogs and fumes and singular,"
4515,THE BLIND MAN,quiet tumults that raged within him. She lessoned him on the things he
4516,THE BLIND MAN,"knew so well, and she was always wrong. She lectured him on those"
4517,THE BLIND MAN,"things which she did know, but the unending disquisition, the perpetual"
4518,THE BLIND MAN,"repetition, the foolish, empty emphasis, the dragging weightiness of"
4519,THE BLIND MAN,her tongue made him repudiate her knowledge and hate it as much as he
4520,THE BLIND MAN,did her.
4521,THE BLIND MAN,
4522,THE BLIND MAN,"Sometimes, looking at her, he would rub his eyes and yawn with fatigue"
4523,THE BLIND MAN,and wonder--there she was! A something enwrapped about with
4524,THE BLIND MAN,petticoats. Veritably alive. Active as an insect! Palpable to the
4525,THE BLIND MAN,touch! And what was she doing to him? Why did she do it? Why didn't
4526,THE BLIND MAN,she go away? Why didn't she die? What sense was there in the making
4527,THE BLIND MAN,"of such a creature that clothed itself like a bolster, without any"
4528,THE BLIND MAN,freedom or entertainment or shapeliness?
4529,THE BLIND MAN,
4530,THE BLIND MAN,Her eyes were fixed on him and they always seemed to be angry; and her
4531,THE BLIND MAN,"tongue was uttering rubbish about horses, rubbish about cows, rubbish"
4532,THE BLIND MAN,about hay and oats. Nor was this the sum of his weariness. It was not
4533,THE BLIND MAN,"alone that he was married; he was multitudinously, egregiously married."
4534,THE BLIND MAN,"He had married a whole family, and what a family--"
4535,THE BLIND MAN,
4536,THE BLIND MAN,"Her mother lived with her, her eldest sister lived with her, her"
4537,THE BLIND MAN,youngest sister lived with her--and these were all swathed about with
4538,THE BLIND MAN,petticoats and shawls. They had no movement. Their feet were like
4539,THE BLIND MAN,those of no creature he had ever observed. One could hear the
4540,THE BLIND MAN,"flip-flap of their slippers all over the place, and at all hours. They"
4541,THE BLIND MAN,"were down-at-heel, draggle-tailed, and futile. There was no"
4542,THE BLIND MAN,"workmanship about them. They were as unfinished, as unsightly as a"
4543,THE BLIND MAN,"puddle on a road. They insulted his eyesight, his hearing, and his"
4544,THE BLIND MAN,"energy. They had lank hair that slapped about them like wet seaweed,"
4545,THE BLIND MAN,"and they were all talking, talking, talking."
4546,THE BLIND MAN,
4547,THE BLIND MAN,The mother was of an incredible age. She was senile with age. Her
4548,THE BLIND MAN,cracked cackle never ceased for an instant. She talked to the dog and
4549,THE BLIND MAN,the cat; she talked to the walls of the room; she spoke out through the
4550,THE BLIND MAN,window to the weather; she shut her eyes in a corner and harangued the
4551,THE BLIND MAN,circumambient darkness. The eldest sister was as silent as a deep
4552,THE BLIND MAN,ditch and as ugly. She slid here and there with her head on one side
4553,THE BLIND MAN,"like an inquisitive hen watching one curiously, and was always doing"
4554,THE BLIND MAN,nothing with an air of futile employment. The youngest was a
4555,THE BLIND MAN,"semi-lunatic who prattled and prattled without ceasing, and was always"
4556,THE BLIND MAN,"catching one's sleeve, and laughing at one's face.--And everywhere"
4557,THE BLIND MAN,"those flopping, wriggling petticoats were appearing and disappearing."
4558,THE BLIND MAN,"One saw slack hair whisking by the corner of one's eye. Mysteriously,"
4559,THE BLIND MAN,"urgently, they were coming and going and coming again, and never, never"
4560,THE BLIND MAN,being silent.
4561,THE BLIND MAN,
4562,THE BLIND MAN,More and more he went running to the public-house. But it was no
4563,THE BLIND MAN,"longer to be among men, it was to get drunk. One might imagine him"
4564,THE BLIND MAN,sitting there thinking those slow thoughts without words. One might
4565,THE BLIND MAN,"predict that the day would come when he would realise very suddenly,"
4566,THE BLIND MAN,"very clearly all that he had been thinking about, and, when this"
4567,THE BLIND MAN,"urgent, terrible thought had been translated into its own terms of"
4568,THE BLIND MAN,"action, he would be quietly hanged by the neck until he was as dead as"
4569,THE BLIND MAN,he had been before he was alive.

4596,I,
4597,I,One awakened suddenly in those days. Sleep was not followed by the
4598,I,haze which trails behind more mature slumbers. One's eyes opened wide
4599,I,"and bright, and brains and legs became instantly active. If by a"
4600,I,"chance the boy lying next to you was still asleep, it was the thing to"
4601,I,"hit him with a pillow. Even among boys, however, there are certain"
4602,I,"morose creatures who are ill-tempered in the morning, and these, on"
4603,I,"being struck with a pillow, become malignantly active, and desire to"
4604,I,fight with fists instead of pillows.
4605,I,
4606,I,Bull was such a boy. He was densely packed with pugnacity. He lived
4607,I,"for ever on the extreme slope of a fight, down which he slid at a word,"
4608,I,"a nod, a wink, into strenuous and bloodthirsty warfare. He was never"
4609,I,"seen without a black eye, a bruised lip, or something wrong with his"
4610,I,ear. He had the most miscellaneous collection of hurts that one could
4611,I,"imagine, and he was always prepared to exhibit his latest injury in"
4612,I,exchange for a piece of toffee. If this method of barter was not
4613,I,"relished, he would hit the proprietor of the toffee and confiscate the"
4614,I,goods to his own use.
4615,I,
4616,I,His knowledge of who had sweets was uncanny. He had an extra sense in
4617,I,"that direction, which was a trouble to all smaller boys. No matter how"
4618,I,"cunningly one concealed a sticky treasure, just when one was secretly"
4619,I,enjoying it he came leaping out of space with the most offensive
4620,I,"friendliness crinkling all over his face, and his desire to participate"
4621,I,in the confection was advanced without any preliminary courtesies--
4622,I,
4623,I,"""What have you got? Show! Give us a bit. Can't you give a fellow a"
4624,I,"bit?"""
4625,I,
4626,I,"When the bit was tendered he snatched it, swallowed it, and growled--"
4627,I,
4628,I,"""Do you call that a bit? Give us a real bit."""
4629,I,
4630,I,There are plenty of boys who will defend their toffee with their lives.
4631,I,"Such boys he liked to meet, for their refusal to surrender a part gave"
4632,I,him an opportunity to fight and a reason for confiscating the whole of
4633,I,the ravished sweetmeat. One often had to devour one's sweets at a full
4634,I,gallop. It was no uncommon thing to see a small boy scudding furiously
4635,I,"around a field with Bull pounding behind, intent as a bloodhound, and"
4636,I,as horribly vocal. A close examination would discover that the small
4637,I,boy's jaws were moving with even greater rapidity than his legs. If he
4638,I,managed to get his stuff devoured before he was caught it was all
4639,I,"right, but he got hammered anyhow when he was caught. However, Bull's"
4640,I,"approach was usually managed with great skill and strategy, and before"
4641,I,the small boy was aware Bull was squatting beside him using
4642,I,blandishments both moral and minatory.
4643,I,
4644,I,He was a very gifted boy. He had no bent for learning lessons but he
4645,I,had a great gift for collecting and turning to his own use the property
4646,I,of other people. Sometimes three or four boys swore a Solemn League
4647,I,and Covenant against him. His perplexity then was extreme. He saw
4648,I,toffee being devoured and none of it coming his way. Possibly his
4649,I,"method of thinking was in pictures, and he could visualise with painful"
4650,I,"clarity the alien gullets down which toffee was traveling, and,"
4651,I,"simultaneously, he could see the woeful emptiness of his own red lane."
4652,I,He must have felt that all was not right with a Providence which could
4653,I,allow such happenings. A world wherein there was toffee for others and
4654,I,none for him was certainly a world out of joint. His idea of Utopia
4655,I,would be a place where there were lots of things for him to eat and a
4656,I,circle of hungry boys who watched his deliberate jaws with envy and
4657,I,"humility. Furthermore, the idea that smaller boys could have, not the"
4658,I,"courage, but the heart to congregate against him, must have come to him"
4659,I,with a shock. He was appalled by a sense of the sinfulness of human
4660,I,"nature, and dismayed by the odds against which virtue has to fight."
4661,I,
4662,I,"The others, strong in numbers, followed him on such occasions chewing"
4663,I,"their tuck with grave deliberation, descanting minutely and loudly on"
4664,I,"the taste of each bit, the splendid length of time it took to dissolve,"
4665,I,and the blessedly large quantity which yet remained to be eaten. He
4666,I,"threatened them, but his threats were received with yawns. He wheedled"
4667,I,(a thing he could do consummately well) but they were not to be
4668,I,blandished. He mapped out on his own person the particular and painful
4669,I,places where later on he would hit them unless he was bound over to the
4670,I,peace by toffee. And they sucked their sweetstuff and made diagrams on
4671,I,each other of the places where they could hit Bull if they had a mind
4672,I,"to, and told each other and him that he was not worth hitting and,"
4673,I,would probably die if he were hit. But they were careful not dissolve
4674,I,partnership until the sweets were eaten and beyond even the wildest
4675,I,"hopes of salvage. Then, in the later-on that had been predicted, Bull"
4676,I,"captured them in detail, and, as he had promised, he ""lammed the"
4677,I,"stuffing"" out of them."
4678,I,
4679,I,"He had all the grave wisdom of the stupid, and the extraordinary energy"
4680,I,"and persistence which perpetuates them. He never could learn a lesson,"
4681,I,"but he could, and did, pinch the boy next to him into adept prompting,"
4682,I,"and would intimidate any one into doing his sums. Indeed, the man of"
4683,I,whom he was the promise had no need for ordinary learning. The lighter
4684,I,"accomplishments of life had no appeal, nor would the deeper lessons"
4685,I,"have any meaning for him. He is simply a big, physical appetite,"
4686,I,"untrammelled by anything like introspection or conscience, and working"
4687,I,in perfect innocence for the fulfilment of its simple wants. For at
4688,I,base his species are surely the most simple of human creatures. In
4689,I,spite of their complex physical structure they are one-celled organisms
4690,I,driven through life with only a passionate hunger as their motive
4691,I,"power, and with no complexities of thought or emotion to hamper their"
4692,I,loud progressions. None but those of their own kind can suffer from
4693,I,"their ravages, and, even so, they fly the contact of each other with"
4694,I,horror.
4695,I,
4696,I,Doubtless by this time Bull is a prosperous and wealthy citizen
4697,I,"somewhere, the proprietor of a curved waistcoat and a gold watch."
4698,I,Possessions other than these he would regard with the amiable tolerance
4699,I,of a philosopher regarding a child with toys. So strongly acquisitive
4700,I,a nature must win the particular little battles which it is fitted to
4701,I,wage. When a conscienceless mind is buttressed by a pugnacious
4702,I,"temperament then houses and land, and cattle and maidservants, and"
4703,I,"such-like, the small change of existence, are easily gotten."
4704,I,

4707,II,
4708,II,The sunlight of youth has a special quality which will never again be
4709,II,known until we rediscover it in Paradise. What a time it was! How the
4710,II,"sun shone, and how often it shone! I remember playing about in a"
4711,II,parched and ragged field with a leaf from a copy-book stuck under my
4712,II,cap to aid its quarter-inch peak in keeping off the glare of that
4713,II,tremendous sunshine.
4714,II,
4715,II,"Tip-and-Tig, Horneys and Robbers, Relievo we played, and another game,"
4716,II,"the name of which did not then seem at all strange, but which now wears"
4717,II,"an amazing appearance--it was, Twenty-four Yards on the Billy-Goat's"
4718,II,"Tail. I wonder now what was that Billy-Goat, and was he able to wag the"
4719,II,triumphant tail of which twenty-four yards was probably no more than an
4720,II,"inconsiderable moiety. There were other games: Ball-in-the-Decker,"
4721,II,"Cap-on-the-Back, and Towns or Rounders. These were all summer games."
4722,II,
4723,II,With the lightest effort of imagination I can see myself and other
4724,II,tireless atoms scooting across reaches of sunlight. I can hear the
4725,II,"continuous howl which accompanied our play, and can see that ragged,"
4726,II,"parched field spreading, save for the cluster of boys, wide and silent"
4727,II,"to the further, greener fields, where the cows were lying down in great"
4728,II,"coloured lumps, and one antic deer, a pet, would make such astonishing"
4729,II,"journeys, jumping the entire circuit of the field on four thin and"
4730,II,absolutely rigid legs; for when it made these peculiar excursions it
4731,II,"never seemed to use its legs--these were held quite rigidly, and the"
4732,II,"deer bounded by some powerful, spring-like action, its brown coat"
4733,II,"flashing in the sunlight, and its movement a rhythmic glory which the"
4734,II,boys watched with ecstasy and laughter.
4735,II,
4736,II,"An old ass was native to that field also. He had been a bright,"
4737,II,"kind-hearted donkey at one time: a donkey whose nose might be tickled,"
4738,II,and who would allow one to climb upon his back. But the presence of
4739,II,"boys grew disturbing as he grew old, and the practical jokes of which"
4740,II,his youth took no heed induced a kind of insanity in his latter age.
4741,II,"He took to kicking the cows as they browsed peacefully, and, later, he"
4742,II,"developed a horrid appetite for fowl, and would stalk and kill and eat"
4743,II,hens whenever possible. Later still he directed this unhealthy
4744,II,"appetite towards small boys, and after he had eaten part of one lad's"
4745,II,shoulder and the calf from another boy's leg he disappeared--whether he
4746,II,"was sold to some innocent person, or had been slaughtered mysteriously,"
4747,II,we did not know. We professed to believe that he had died of the
4748,II,"horrible taste of the boys he had bitten, and, afterwards, whenever we"
4749,II,"played cannibals, we refused, greatly to their chagrin, to kill and eat"
4750,II,"these two boys, on the ground that their flesh was poisonous; but the"
4751,II,others we slaughtered and fed on with undiminished gusto.
4752,II,
4753,II,"There were only two trees in the field--great, gnarled monsters casting"
4754,II,a deep shade. In that shade the grass grew long and green and juicy.
4755,II,After a game the boys would fling themselves down in the shadow of the
4756,II,"trees to chew the sweet grass, and play ""knifey,"" and talk.--Such"
4757,II,"talk!--endless and careless, and loud as the converse of young bulls."
4758,II,What did we talk about? Delightful and inconsequent shoutings--
4759,II,
4760,II,"""That is a hawk up there, he's going to soar. How does he keep so"
4761,II,steady without moving his wings? Watch now! down he drops like a
4762,II,stone. . . . If you give your rabbit too many cabbage leaves he'll die
4763,II,of the gripes. . . . Did you ever play jack-stones? a fellow showed me
4764,II,"how, look! . . . When we were at the sea yesterday Jimmy Nelson"
4765,II,wouldn't go out from the shore. He was afraid of his life--he wouldn't
4766,II,"even duck down. I swam nearly out of sight, didn't I, Sam? So did"
4767,II,Sam. . . . You could climb right up to the top of that tree if you
4768,II,"tried. No you couldn't.--Yes I could, it's forked all the way"
4769,II,up. . . . The new master wears specs--Old Four-Eyes! and he grins at a
4770,II,fellow. I don't think he's much. . . . How do midges get born? . . .
4771,II,My brother has one with four blades and a thing for poking stones out
4772,II,of a horse's hoof. . . . A horse-hair won't break the cane at all:
4773,II,"it's all bosh: rosin is the only thing. . . ."""
4774,II,
4775,II,There was a little stream which twisted a six-foot path through the
4776,II,"field, the sunshine dashing off its waters in brilliant flashes. The"
4777,II,"top of the water swarmed with flying insects and strange, small"
4778,II,spider-things skimmed over its surface with amazing swiftness. We
4779,II,believed there were otters in that stream--they came out at nightfall
4780,II,"and, unless you had the good fortune to be rescued by a Newfoundland"
4781,II,"dog, they would hold you down under water until you were drowned. We"
4782,II,also held there were leeches in the stream--they would grip you by the
4783,II,"hundred thousand and suck you to death in five minutes, and they clung"
4784,II,so tightly that one could not prise their mouths open with a poker. We
4785,II,"hoped there were whales in it, but not one of us desired a shark"
4786,II,because it is the Sailor's Enemy.
4787,II,
4788,II,An iron railing ran by part of the field. Every hole and joint of it
4789,II,"was crammed with earwigs, and these could be poked out of the crevices"
4790,II,with a straw. When an amazing number of them had been poked out there
4791,II,was always another one left. The very last earwig that could be
4792,II,discovered was the King. He was able and willing to bite ten times as
4793,II,"badly as any of the others, and he was awfully vicious when his nest"
4794,II,"was broken into. Furthermore, he had the ability to put a curse on you"
4795,II,"before he died, and he always did this because he was so vicious. If a"
4796,II,King Earwig had time to curse you before he was killed terrible things
4797,II,might happen. His favourite curse was to translate himself into the
4798,II,"next piece of bread you would eat, and then you would see one-half of"
4799,II,him waggling in a hole in the bread: the other half you had already
4800,II,eaten.--For this reason the King Earwig was always allowed to go free
4801,II,"until he was not looking, then he was killed with great suddenness."
4802,II,
4803,II,I remember how the slow evening shadows drew over the quiet fields. The
4804,II,"sunlight slowly faded to a mist of gold, into which the great trees"
4805,II,"thrust timorous, shy fingers, and these gradually widened, until, at"
4806,II,"last, the whole horizon bowed into the twilight."
4807,II,
4808,II,"Across the field there could be heard the voice of the river, a"
4809,II,"furtive, desolate hoarseness in the dusk. The cows in the far fields"
4810,II,"had long ago wandered home to be milked, scarcely a bird moved in the"
4811,II,"high silences, the gnats had hidden themselves away in the deep, rugged"
4812,II,"bark of the trees, and, through the dimness, the heavy beetles were"
4813,II,"hurling like stones, and dropping and rising again in a laborious"
4814,II,flight.
4815,II,
4816,II,
4817,III,III
4818,III,
4819,III,He could remember that he had wept to be allowed go to school. Even
4820,III,more vivid was his recollection of the persuasive and persistent tears
4821,III,which he had shed to be allowed to stay at home.
4822,III,
4823,III,Most of the joys of school were exhausted after he had submitted to one
4824,III,hour of dreary discipline.--To be compelled to sit still when every
4825,III,inch of one's being clamoured to move about; to have to stand up and
4826,III,stare at a blackboard upon which meaningless white scrawls were
4827,III,"perpetually being drawn, and as perpetually being wiped out to a"
4828,III,"master's meaningless, monotonous verbal accompaniment; to have to join"
4829,III,"in a chant which began with ""a, b, c,"" and droned steadily through a"
4830,III,"complexity of sounds to a ridiculously inadequate ""z""--such things"
4831,III,"became desperately boring. One was not even let go to sleep, and if"
4832,III,"one wept from sheer ennui, then one was clouted. School, he shortly"
4833,III,"decided, was not worth anybody's while, but he also discovered that a"
4834,III,torment had commenced which was not by any artifice to be evaded.
4835,III,
4836,III,Along the road to school there ran a succession of meadows--the path
4837,III,was really a footway through fields--and how not to stray into these
4838,III,meadows was a problem demanding the entire of one's attention.
4839,III,Sometimes a rabbit bolted almost from under one's feet--it flapped away
4840,III,"through the grass, and bobbed up and down in a great hurry. Then his"
4841,III,heart filled with envy. He said to himself--
4842,III,
4843,III,"""That rabbit is not going to school: if it was it wouldn't run so"
4844,III,"quickly."""
4845,III,
4846,III,It was paltry comfort to hurl a wad of grass after it.
4847,III,
4848,III,"Through most of the journey there was an immense, lazy bee with a bass"
4849,III,"voice, and he droned defiance three feet away from one's cap which"
4850,III,almost jolted to be put over him. He seemed to understand that at such
4851,III,"an hour he was not in any danger, and so he would drop to the grass,"
4852,III,"roll on his back, and cock up his legs in ecstasy."
4853,III,
4854,III,"""Bees,"" said he to himself in amazement and despair, ""do not go to"
4855,III,"school."""
4856,III,
4857,III,"Each bush and tree seemed, for the moment, to be inhabited by a bird"
4858,III,whose song was unfamiliar and the markings on whom he could not
4859,III,remember to have seen before; and he had no time to stay and note them.
4860,III,"He dragged beyond these objects reluctantly, pondering on the"
4861,III,unreasonable savagery of parents who sent one to school when the sun
4862,III,was shining.
4863,III,
4864,III,But the greatest obstacle to getting to school was the river which
4865,III,danced briskly through the fields. The footpath went for a stretch
4866,III,"along this stream, and, during that piece of the journey, haste was not"
4867,III,possible. There are so many things in a river to look at. The
4868,III,movement of the water in itself exercises fascinations over a boy.
4869,III,"There are always bubbles, based strongly in froth, sailing gallantly"
4870,III,along.--One speculates how long a bubble will swim before it hits a
4871,III,"rock, or is washed into nothing by an eddy, or is becalmed in a"
4872,III,sheltered corner to ride at jaunty anchor with a navy of similar
4873,III,delicate tonnage.
4874,III,
4875,III,"Further, if one finds a twig on the path, or a leaf, there is nothing"
4876,III,more natural than to throw these into the river and see how fast or how
4877,III,erratically they sail. Pebbles also clamour to be cast into the
4878,III,stream. Perhaps a dragon-fly whirls above the surface of the water to
4879,III,hold one late from school. The grasses and rushes by the marge may
4880,III,stir as a grey rat slips out to take to the water and swim low down and
4881,III,very fast on some strange and important journey. The inspection of
4882,III,"such an event cannot be hurried. One must, if it is possible, discover"
4883,III,"where he swims to, and if his hole is found it has to be blocked up"
4884,III,"with stones, even though the persistent bell is clanging down over the"
4885,III,fields.
4886,III,
4887,III,Perhaps a big frog will push out from the grass and go in fat leaps
4888,III,down to the water--plop! and away he swims with his sarcastic nose up
4889,III,"and his legs going like fury. The strange, very-little-boy motions of"
4890,III,"a frog in water is a thing to ponder over. There are small frogs also,"
4891,III,"every bit as interesting, thin-legged, round-bellied anatomies who try"
4892,III,"to jump two ways at once when they are observed, and are caught so"
4893,III,easily that it is scarcely worth one's trouble to chase them at all.
4894,III,
4895,III,Just where the path turned there was an arch under which the river
4896,III,flowed.--It was covered in with an iron grating. Surely it was a place
4897,III,"of mystery. Through the bars the dark, swirling waters were dimly"
4898,III,visible--there were things in there. Black lumps rose out of the
4899,III,"water, and, for a little distance, the slimy, shimmering, cold-looking"
4900,III,"walls could be seen. Beyond there was a deeper gloom, and, beyond that"
4901,III,"again, a blank, mysterious darkness. Through the grating the voice of"
4902,III,"the stream came back with a strange note. On the outside, under the"
4903,III,"sun, it was a tinkle and a rush, a dance indeed, but within it was a"
4904,III,low snarl that deepened to a grim whisper. There was an edge of malice
4905,III,to the sound: something dark and very terrible brooded on the face of
4906,III,those hidden waters. It was the home of surmise.--What might there not
4907,III,be there? There might be gully-holes where the waters whirled in wide
4908,III,"circles, and then flew smoothly down, and down, and down. If one could"
4909,III,have got in there to see! To crawl along by the slippery edge in the
4910,III,darkness and solitude! It was very hard to get away from this place.
4911,III,
4912,III,A little farther on two goats were tethered. As one passed they would
4913,III,"cease to pluck the grass and begin to dance slowly, such dainty, antic"
4914,III,"steps, with their heads held down and their pale eyes looking upwards"
4915,III,with a joke in them. They did not really want to fight; they wanted to
4916,III,play but were too shy to admit it.
4917,III,
4918,III,And here the schoolhouse was in sight. The bell had stopped: it was
4919,III,now time to run.
4920,III,
4921,III,He gripped the mouth of his satchel with one hand to prevent the lesson
4922,III,"books from jumping out as he ran, he gripped his pocket with the other"
4923,III,hand to prevent his lunch from being jolted into the road.
4924,III,
4925,III,Another few yards and he was at the gate--some one was glaring out
4926,III,through a window. It was a big face rimmed with spectacles and
4927,III,whiskers--a master. He knew that when yonder severe eye had lifted
4928,III,"from him it had dropped to look at a watch, and he also knew exactly"
4929,III,what the owner of the severe eye would say to him as he sidled in.

4964,I,"The old gentleman entered, and was about to sit down, when a button"
4965,I,became detached from some portion of his raiment and rolled upon the
4966,I,floor. He picked the button up and observed that he would keep it for
4967,I,"his housekeeper to sew on, and, while speaking on the strangeness of"
4968,I,"housekeeping and buttons, he came slowly to the subject of matrimony--"
4969,I,
4970,I,"""Like so many other customs,"" said he, ""marriage is not native to the"
4971,I,"human race, nor is it altogether peculiar to it. So far as I am aware"
4972,I,"no person was ever born married, and in extreme youth bachelors and"
4973,I,"spinsters are so common as to call for no remark. Nature strives, not"
4974,I,for duality as in the case of the Siamese Twins but for individuality.
4975,I,"We are all born strongly separated, and I am often inclined to fancy"
4976,I,that this ceremony of joining appears very like flying in the face of
4977,I,"Providence. I have also thought, on the other hand, that the"
4978,I,segregation of humanity into male and female is not an economic
4979,I,"practice, but I fear the foundation of the sex habit is by this time so"
4980,I,deeply trenched in our natures as to be practically ineradicable.
4981,I,
4982,I,"""Throughout nature the male and female habit is usual: all beasts are"
4983,I,"born of one or the other gender, and this is also the case in the"
4984,I,vegetable kingdom: but I am not aware that the ridiculous and wasteful
4985,I,preparations with which we encumber matrimony obtain also among plants
4986,I,"and animals. Certainly, among some animals courtship, as we understand"
4987,I,"it, is practised--Wolves, for instance, are an extraordinarily acute"
4988,I,"people who make good husbands and fathers, and in these relations they"
4989,I,display a tenderness and courtesy which one only acquainted with their
4990,I,out-of-door manners would scarcely credit them with. Their courtship
4991,I,is conducted under circumstances of extraordinary rigour. A he-wolf
4992,I,"who becomes enamoured of a female from another tribe is forced, in"
4993,I,"attempting to wed her, to set his life upon the venture, and,"
4994,I,"disdaining all the fury of her numerous relatives, he must forcibly"
4995,I,"detach her from her family, kill or maim all her other suitors, sustain"
4996,I,in a wounded and desperate condition a prolonged chase over the
4997,I,"snow-clad Russian Steppes, and, ultimately, consummate his nuptials, if"
4998,I,"he can, with as many limbs as his lady's family have failed to collect"
4999,I,off him. This is a courtship admirably fitted to evolve a hardy and
5000,I,Spartan race strong in the virtues of reliance and self-control.
5001,I,
5002,I,"""Spiders, on the other hand, are a people whom I despise on several"
5003,I,"counts, but must admire on others. They conduct their love affairs in"
5004,I,"an even more tragic style. In every event matrimony is a tragedy, but"
5005,I,in the case of spiders it is a catastrophe. Spiders are a very sour
5006,I,"and pessimistic people who live in walls, corners of hotel bedrooms and"
5007,I,"holes generally, in which places they weave very delicate webs, and sit"
5008,I,"for a long period in a state of philosophic ecstasy, contemplating the"
5009,I,infinite. Their principal pastimes are killing flies and committing
5010,I,suicide--both of which games should be encouraged. Like so many other
5011,I,unhappy creatures they are born with a gender from which there is no
5012,I,"escape. The male spider is very much smaller than the female, and he"
5013,I,does not care greatly for his life. When he does not desire to live
5014,I,any longer he commits matrimony or suicide. He weds a large and fierce
5015,I,"wife, who, when in expectation of progeny, kills him, and, being a"
5016,I,"thorough-going person as all females are, she also eats him, possibly"
5017,I,"at his own request, and thus she relieves her husband of the tedium of"
5018,I,existence and herself of the necessity for seeking immediate victual.
5019,I,I do not know whether male spiders are very plentiful or extremely
5020,I,"scarce, but I cite this as an example of the extravagance and economy"
5021,I,of the female gender.
5022,I,
5023,I,"""Of the courting habits of fish I have scanty knowledge. Fish are very"
5024,I,"ugly, dirty creatures who appear to live entirely in water, and they"
5025,I,have been known to follow a ship for miles in the disgusting hope of
5026,I,garbage being thrown to them by the steward. Their chief pastime is
5027,I,"weighing each other, for which purpose they are liberally provided with"
5028,I,"scales. They can be captured by nets, or rods and lines, or, when they"
5029,I,"are cockles, they can be captured by the human hand, but, in this"
5030,I,"latter case, they cannot be tamed, having very little intelligence."
5031,I,"The cockle has no scale, and feels the deprivation keenly, hiding"
5032,I,himself deep in the sea and seldom venturing forth except at
5033,I,"night-time. He is composed of two shells and a soft piece, is chiefly"
5034,I,"useful for poisoning children and is found at Sandymount, a place where"
5035,I,nobody but a cockle would live. Other fish may be generally described
5036,I,"as, crabs, pinkeens, red herrings and whales. How these conduct their"
5037,I,matrimonial adventures I do not know--the statement that whales are
5038,I,"fond of pinkeens is true only in a food sense, for these races have"
5039,I,never been observed to intermarry.
5040,I,
5041,I,"""A great many creatures capture or captivate their mates by"
5042,I,"singing.--These are usually, but not always, birds, and include wily"
5043,I,"wagtails, larks, canary birds and the crested earwig. Poets, music"
5044,I,hall comedians and cats may also be included in this category. Dogs
5045,I,"are imperative and dashing wooers, but they seldom sing. Peacocks"
5046,I,"expand their tails before the astonished gaze of their brides, showing"
5047,I,"how the female sex is over-borne by minor, unimportant advantages."
5048,I,"Frogs, I believe, make love in the dark, which is a wise thing for them"
5049,I,"to do--they are very witty folk, but confirmed sentimentalists."
5050,I,Grocers' assistants attract their mates by exposing very tall collars
5051,I,"and brown boots. Drapers' assistants follow suit, with the comely"
5052,I,addition of green socks and an umbrella--they are never known to fail.
5053,I,Some creatures do not marry at all. At a certain period they break in
5054,I,"two halves, and each half, fully equipped for existence, waggles away"
5055,I,from the other.--They are the only perfectly happy folk of whom I am
5056,I,"aware. For myself, I was born single and I will remain so, I will"
5057,I,"never be a slave to the disgusting habit of matrimony."""
5058,I,
5059,I,"Having said this with great firmness, the old gentleman shed two more"
5060,I,"buttons from his waistcoat, and, after sticking three nails and a piece"
5061,I,"of twine through his garments, he departed very happily. The"
5062,I,"gentleman-in-waiting sneezed three times in a loud voice, and gave a"
5063,I,"war-whoop, but I took no notice of these impertinences."
5064,I,
5065,I,
5066,II,II
5067,II,
5068,II,"I had not seen the old gentleman for a long time, and when he entered"
5069,II,"with one foot in a boot and the other in a carpet slipper, I was"
5070,II,overjoyed. When the bubbling tankard which I had ordered was placed
5071,II,"before him he seized my two hands, wrung them heartily and dashed into"
5072,II,the following subject--
5073,II,
5074,II,"""It must be remembered,"" said he, ""that dancing is not an art but a"
5075,II,"pastime, and should, therefore, be freed from the too-burdensome"
5076,II,regulations wherewith an art is encumbered. An art is a
5077,II,highly-specialised matter hedged in on every side by intellectual
5078,II,"policemen, a pastime is not specialised, and never takes place in the"
5079,II,"presence of policemen, who are well known to be the sworn enemies of"
5080,II,"gaiety. For example, theology is an art but religion is a pastime: we"
5081,II,"learn the collects only under compulsion, but we sing anthems because"
5082,II,"it is pleasant to do so. Thus, eating oysters is an art by dint of the"
5083,II,"elaborate ceremonial including shell-openers, lemons, waiters and"
5084,II,"pepper, which must be grouped around your oyster before you can"
5085,II,"conveniently swallow him, but eating nuts, or blackberries, or a"
5086,II,privily-acquired turnip--these are pastimes.
5087,II,
5088,II,"""The practice of dancing is of an undoubted antiquity. History teems"
5089,II,"with reference to this custom, but it is difficult to discover what"
5090,II,nationality or what era first witnessed its evolution. I myself
5091,II,believe that the first dance was performed by a domestic hen who found
5092,II,"an ostrich's egg, and bounded before Providence in gratitude for"
5093,II,something worthy of being sat upon.
5094,II,
5095,II,"""In all places and in all ages dancing has been utilised as a first-aid"
5096,II,"to language. The function of language is intellectual, that of dancing"
5097,II,is emotional. It is scarcely possible to say anything of an emotional
5098,II,nature in words without adventuring into depths or bogs of
5099,II,sentimentality from which one can only emerge greasy with dishonour.
5100,II,When we are happy we cannot say so with any degree of intelligibility:
5101,II,"in such a context the spoken word is miserably inadequate, and must be"
5102,II,supplemented by some bodily antic. If we are merry we must skip to be
5103,II,understood. If we are happy we must dance. If we are wildly and
5104,II,"ecstatically joyous then we will become creators, and some new and"
5105,II,beneficent dance-movements will be added to the repertory of our
5106,II,neighborhood.
5107,II,
5108,II,"""Children will dance upon the slightest provocation, so also do lambs"
5109,II,"and goats; but policemen, and puckauns, and advertisement agents, and"
5110,II,"fish do not dance at all, and this is because they have hard hearts."
5111,II,"Worms and Members of Parliament, between whom, in addition to their"
5112,II,"high general culture, there is a singular and subtle correspondence, do"
5113,II,"not dance, because the inelastic quality of their environment forbids"
5114,II,"anything in the nature of freedom. Frogs, dogs, and very young"
5115,II,mountains do dance.
5116,II,
5117,II,"""A frog is a most estimable person. He has a cold body but a warm"
5118,II,"heart, and a countenance of almost parental benevolence, and the joy of"
5119,II,life moves him to an almost ceaseless activity. I can never observe a
5120,II,frog on a journey without fancying that his gusto for travel is
5121,II,directed by a philanthropic impulse towards the bedside of a sick
5122,II,friend or a meeting to discuss the Housing of the Working Classes. He
5123,II,"has danced all the way to, he will dance all the way from his"
5124,II,"objective, but the spectacle of many men dancing is provocative of"
5125,II,"pain.--To them dancing is a duty, and a melancholy one. If one danced"
5126,II,to celebrate a toothache one might take lessons from them. They stand
5127,II,"in the happy circle, their features are composed to an iron gravity,"
5128,II,"their hands are as rigid as those of a graven image, and then, the"
5129,II,"fatal moment having arrived, they agitate their legs with a cold fury"
5130,II,which is distinctly unpleasant. Having finished they dash their
5131,II,partners from their sides and retire to blush and curse in a corner.
5132,II,
5133,II,"""When a man dances he should laugh and crow and snap his fingers and"
5134,II,"make faces; otherwise, he is not dancing at all, he is taking exercise."
5135,II,No person should be allowed to dance without first swearing that he
5136,II,feels only six years of age. People who admit to feeling more than ten
5137,II,"years old should be sent to hospital, and any one proved guilty of"
5138,II,fourteen years of age should be lodged in gaol without the option.
5139,II,
5140,II,"""It is peculiar how often opposite emotions may meet on a common plane"
5141,II,of expression. The extremes of love and hate strive to get equally
5142,II,close to kiss or to bite the object of their regard. Work and play may
5143,II,be equally strenuous and equally enthralling. Hunger and satiety unite
5144,II,"in a common boredom. A happy person will dance from sheer delight, and"
5145,II,the man in whom a pin has been secreted can only by dancing express the
5146,II,exquisite sensibility of his cuticle. Whatever one does or refrains
5147,II,from doing one must be tired by bed-time--it is a law--but one may be
5148,II,pleasantly tired.
5149,II,
5150,II,"""I will suspect the morals of a man who cannot dance. I will look"
5151,II,curiously into his sugar or statecraft. I will impeach his candour or
5152,II,"reticence, and sneer at his method of lighting a fire unless he can"
5153,II,frolic when he goes out for a walk with a dog--that is the beginning of
5154,II,dancing: the end of it is the beginning of a world. A young dog is a
5155,II,"piece of early morning disguised in an earthly fell, and the man who"
5156,II,"can resist his contagion is a sour, dour, miserable mistake, without"
5157,II,"bravery, without virtue, without music, with a cranky body and a"
5158,II,"shrivelled soul, and with eyes incapable of seeing the sunlight."
5159,II,
5160,II,"""I have often thought that dogs are a very superior race of people."
5161,II,They are certainly more highly organised on the affectional plane than
5162,II,man. A dog will love you just for the fun of it--and that is virtue.
5163,II,Pat a dog on the head and he will dance around you in an ecstasy of
5164,II,"good-fellowship. Let us, at least, be the equal of these sagacities."
5165,II,Let us put away our false intellectual pride. Let us learn to be
5166,II,unconscious. The average man trembles into a dance imagining that all
5167,II,"eyes are rayed upon him wonderingly or admiringly, whereas, in truth,"
5168,II,he will only be looked at if he dances very well or very badly. Both
5169,II,of these extremities of perfection ought to be avoided. We should
5170,II,exercise our very bad or very good qualities in solitude lest average
5171,II,people be saddened by their disabilities in either direction. Let your
5172,II,curses be as private as your prayers for both are purgative operations.
5173,II,"In public we must conform to the standard, in private only may we do"
5174,II,"our best or our worst. Acting so, we will be freed from false pride"
5175,II,and cowardly self-consciousness. Let us be brave. Let us caress the
5176,II,waists of our neighbours without fear. Let everybody's chin be our
5177,II,toy. Let us pat one another on the hats as we pass in the melancholy
5178,II,streets.--Thus only shall we learn to be gay and careless who for so
5179,II,long have been miserable and suspicious. We will be fearless and
5180,II,"companionable who have been so timid and solitary. A new, a better, a"
5181,II,real police force will arrest people who don't dance as they travel to
5182,II,"and from their labour. The world will be happy at last, and"
5183,II,"civilisation will begin to be possible."""
5184,II,
5185,II,"Here, in an ecstasy of good-fellowship, the old gentleman seized his"
5186,II,"pewter with his left hand and my glass with his right hand, and he"
5187,II,"emptied them both before recognising his mistake. I had, however, run"
5188,II,"out of tobacco, whereupon he became very angry, and refused to bid me"
5189,II,good-night.
5190,II,
5191,II,
5192,III,III
5193,III,
5194,III,"The old gentleman condescended to accept the last cigar which I had,"
5195,III,"and, having lit it with my only match, he earnestly advised me never to"
5196,III,"smoke to excess, because this indulgence brought spots before the eyes,"
5197,III,"deteriorated the moral character, and was, moreover, exceedingly"
5198,III,expensive.--On the subject of smoking and tobacco he spoke as follows--
5199,III,
5200,III,"""I have observed that people who do not smoke are usually of a sour and"
5201,III,"unsociable disposition. All red-haired people smoke naturally, and"
5202,III,"they almost invariably use cut-plug. Very dark-haired men smoke twist,"
5203,III,and their natural strength and virtue is such that in the intervals of
5204,III,smoking they also chew tobacco. Fair-haired men generally smoke
5205,III,"cigarettes--they do this, not for the purpose of enjoyment, but purely"
5206,III,"in imitation of their betters. However, in later life, when they"
5207,III,"become bald, as they invariably do, they also became regenerate and"
5208,III,smoke pig-tail. Men with mouse-coloured hair do not smoke at all.
5209,III,"They collect postage stamps and sea-shells, and are usually to be found"
5210,III,sitting round a fire with other girls eating chocolates and seeking for
5211,III,"replies to such questions as, when is a door not a door? and why does a"
5212,III,chicken cross the road? They are miserable creatures whom I will not
5213,III,further mention.
5214,III,
5215,III,"""The usage of tobacco, or some smokable substitute, is as old as"
5216,III,primitive man. Almost all nations of the earth are adepts in this
5217,III,"particular habit. It is, of course, an acquired taste, as also are"
5218,III,washing and tomatoes. We are born with appetites which are static and
5219,III,"unchangeable, but we are also born with a yearning for pleasure which"
5220,III,is almost as positive as an appetite and only needs cultivation to
5221,III,"become equally imperative. Doubtless, a traveller from some distant"
5222,III,"planet, who knew nothing of tobacco, would be astonished at the"
5223,III,spectacle of a man exhaling smoke from his lips with splendid
5224,III,"unconcern, and our traveller's conjectures as to the origin of the"
5225,III,smoke and the immunity of the smoker would be highly amusing and
5226,III,instructive.
5227,III,
5228,III,"""I am often surprised on reflecting that our immediate ancestors were"
5229,III,"debarred from this pleasant indulgence, and I have wondered how they"
5230,III,made the evenings pass. The lack of tobacco and pockets in their
5231,III,clothes (both of which are great civilising agents) may have been
5232,III,"responsible for the wars, harryings, kidnappings and cattle raids"
5233,III,"which, alternating with rigorous and austere religious ceremonial,"
5234,III,formed the bulk of their pleasures. Nowadays we leave these violent
5235,III,entertainments to children and the semi-literate and take our pleasures
5236,III,more composedly. A man who can put his hands in his pockets will
5237,III,seldom remove them for the purpose of slaying some one whose only fault
5238,III,is that he was born in the County Sligo. A man with a pipe in his
5239,III,teeth will be too much at peace with society to endanger its existence.
5240,III,
5241,III,"""If the blessings of tobacco should be extended to the remainder of the"
5242,III,"vertebrates (as, why should it not?) I am sure that lions, elephants,"
5243,III,"and wild boars would avail themselves of it. So, also, would"
5244,III,"kangaroos, a beautiful and agile race living in Polynesia, or"
5245,III,"thereabouts--they are beautiful hoppers, and collect large quantities"
5246,III,"of this plant. In this direction they are especially well equipped,"
5247,III,"each having a pouch in her stomach in which to carry tobacco and hops,"
5248,III,but wherein they now ignorantly secrete their young. Serpents would
5249,III,"smoke a pipe with considerable elegance, and might become more"
5250,III,"benevolent in consequence. Frogs would smoke, but I fancy they would"
5251,III,"expectorate too elaborately to be neighbourly. Fish, however, would"
5252,III,"not smoke at all.--They are a cowardly and corrupt people, living in"
5253,III,"water, which is a singular thing to do. Neither would many birds"
5254,III,"smoke, they have neither the stamina nor the teeth, but I am certain"
5255,III,that crows and jackdaws would chew tobacco eagerly and with true
5256,III,relish. A large proportion of the insecta are too light-minded and
5257,III,"frivolous to care for smoking. Beetles, however, a very reserved and"
5258,III,"dignified race, would smoke cigars, and so would cockroaches, a rather"
5259,III,saturnine and cynical people; but no others.
5260,III,
5261,III,"""As for women--I am astonished they have not smoked, by mere contagion,"
5262,III,long ago. If they did they would certainly grow more kind-hearted and
5263,III,"manly, and I am sure that a deputation of ladies with pipes in their"
5264,III,mouths and hands in their pockets would only have to demand the
5265,III,franchise from an astounded ministry to obtain it.
5266,III,
5267,III,"""Members of Parliament are, I believe, either a separate creation or a"
5268,III,composite of the parrot and the magpie. I have not yet discovered
5269,III,their particular function in nature but have observed them with some
5270,III,"particularity. They wear top hats and are constantly making speeches,"
5271,III,both of which are easy things to do and quite pleasant minor
5272,III,accomplishments.--So far as I can gather their chief use has been to
5273,III,pass something called a Budget. From the fact that this Budget
5274,III,contains a disgraceful imposition on tobacco I must take it that
5275,III,Members of Parliament are among the lower animals who do not
5276,III,"smoke--they are also uninteresting in other ways."""
5277,III,
5278,III,Having said this my old friend bowed to me and departed genially with
5279,III,my cigar case in his pocket. The shirt-sleeved Adonis behind the
5280,III,counter wagged his head solemnly at a fly and then clouted it with a
5281,III,dish-cloth.
5282,III,

5284,IV,IV
5285,IV,
5286,IV,"The old gentleman took an athletic pull at his liquor, and continued"
5287,IV,his discourse. He had been discussing more to himself than to me the
5288,IV,"merits of Professor James and Monsieur Bergson, and had inquired was I"
5289,IV,aware of the nature of the Pragmatic Sanction. The gentleman behind
5290,IV,"the counter remarked, that he had one on his bicycle, but that they"
5291,IV,were no good. This statement was denounced by the Philosopher as an
5292,IV,"unnatural and clumsy falsehood, and, anathematising the ignorance of"
5293,IV,"his interrupter, he came by slow degrees to the following discourse--"
5294,IV,
5295,IV,"""I have but little faith in any of the methods of education with which"
5296,IV,I am presently acquainted. The objective of every system of teaching
5297,IV,should be to enable the person who is being subjected to this repulsive
5298,IV,treatment to do something which will fit him to maintain a place in
5299,IV,life where he will be as little liable as possible to the changes and
5300,IV,vicissitudes of civilised existence.
5301,IV,
5302,IV,"""The cumbrous and inadequate preparation which is now in vogue can"
5303,IV,scarcely be spoken of by a person of understanding without the use of
5304,IV,language unbefitting one who is a member of (inter alia) the Reformed
5305,IV,Church and the highest order of the vertebrates.
5306,IV,
5307,IV,"""If one walks into any school in this kingdom one is certain to meet a"
5308,IV,"tall, thin, anaemic youth with a draggled moustache and a worried eye"
5309,IV,"who is endeavouring to coerce a mass of indigestible, inelastic and"
5310,IV,unimportant facts into the heads of divers sleepy and disgusted
5311,IV,"children. If a small boy, on being asked where Labrador is, replies"
5312,IV,"that it is the most northerly point of the Berlin Archipelago, he may"
5313,IV,"be wrong in quite a variety of ways, but even if he answered correctly"
5314,IV,"he would still know just as little about the matter, while if he were"
5315,IV,"to give the only proper reply to so ridiculous a conundrum, he would"
5316,IV,"tell his tormentor that he did not care a rap where it was, that he had"
5317,IV,"not put it there, and that he would tell his mother if the man did not"
5318,IV,"leave him alone. What has he got to do with Labrador, Terra del Fuego,"
5319,IV,"or the Isles of Greece? Give him a fistful of facts about Donnybrook,"
5320,IV,"and send him away to hunt out the truth of it, with a sandwich in his"
5321,IV,pocket and the promise of a lump of toffee when he came back with his
5322,IV,"cargo of truths--that would interest him, the toffee would make the"
5323,IV,"information stick, while the verification of his facts would make his"
5324,IV,head fat and fertile.
5325,IV,
5326,IV,"""When we ceased to be natural creatures and put on the oppressive"
5327,IV,"shrouds, wraps and disguises which we label in the villainous aggregate"
5328,IV,"civilisation, we ceased to know either how to teach or how to learn."
5329,IV,We exchanged the freedom and spaciousness of life for a cramped
5330,IV,"existence compounded of spectacles and bad grammar, this complicated"
5331,IV,"still further by the multiplication tables, the dead languages and"
5332,IV,indigestion tabloids. During his school-days many a healthy boy had to
5333,IV,parse ten square miles of dead language. Why? he does not know and he
5334,IV,"will never be told, for no one else knows any more than he. The only"
5335,IV,"thing of which he is certain is, that he did not do anything to deserve"

5337,IV,
5338,IV,"""Civilisation, which is responsible for all the woes of life, such as"
5339,IV,"washing, shaving and buying boots, is responsible for this also."
5340,IV,"Potatoes are more productive than Latin roots, are twice as nourishing"
5341,IV,and cannot be parsed. Teach a girl how to recognise an egg by the
5342,IV,"naked eye, and then teach her how to cook it. Teach a boy how to"
5343,IV,discover the kind of trees eggs grow on and what is the best kind of
5344,IV,soil to plant them in. Teach a girl how to keep her hands from
5345,IV,"scratching, her tongue from telling lies, and her teeth from dropping"
5346,IV,"out prematurely, and she will, maybe, turn out a healthy kind of mammal"
5347,IV,having a house filled with brightness and laughter. Teach a boy how to

5349,IV,"good to his mother when she is old, teach him how to give two-pence to"
5350,IV,a beggar without imagining that he is investing his savings in Paradise
5351,IV,"at fifty per cent and a bonus; and then, having eliminated"
5352,IV,"civilisation, education, clothes, tin whistles and soap this earth will"
5353,IV,not be such a bad old ball-alley for a man to smoke a pipe in.

5355,IV,"""Everything is wrong. People should rise to their feet and salute when"
5356,IV,a farmer or a teacher comes into a room. No man should be allowed into

5358,IV,but because they are the two most important professions in the world
5359,IV,"their exponents are robbed and harried into slaves and fools."""
5360,IV,
5361,IV,Having said this with great earnestness the old gentleman
5362,IV,"absent-mindedly impounded my drink, absorbed it, and strode away"
5363,IV,wrapped in thought. The gentleman-in-waiting sympathetically asked me
5364,IV,"if I would have another one, but on learning that I had no more money"
5365,IV,he said good-night.
5366,IV,
5367,IV,

5369,V,
5370,V,The old gentleman was in a state of most unusual content. It might
5371,V,"have been because the sun was shining, or it might have been because he"
5372,V,"had just finished his third glass: whatever it was, the smile upon his"
5373,V,face was of a depth and a radiance impossible to describe. He spoke
5374,V,"for a while upon the pleasant smell of hay passing through a city, and,"
5375,V,"remarking upon the enviable thirst of hay-makers, he swept gradually to"
5376,V,the following weighty monologue--
5377,V,
5378,V,"""From the earliest times,"" said he, ""drinking has been regarded not"
5379,V,"alone as a necessary lubricant, but also as a pastime, and the"
5380,V,ingenuity of every race under the sun has been exercised in the attempt
5381,V,to give variety and distinction to its beverages.
5382,V,
5383,V,"""We may take it that the earliest race of men drank nothing but water,"
5384,V,"and hot water to boot, for at that era the earth must have been, if not"
5385,V,"hot, at least tepid. One can easily imagine that the contemporaries of"
5386,V,the five-toed horse might have welcomed death as a happy release from
5387,V,their too sultry existence.
5388,V,
5389,V,"""I suppose man is the only brewing animal known to scientific research."
5390,V,"All other creatures take their food and drink neat, or in a raw state."
5391,V,"Of course, almost all mammals are enabled by a highly ingenious"
5392,V,"internal mechanism to brew milk, or some other lacteal substitute, but"
5393,V,"this is performed by a natural, instinctive impulse towards the"
5394,V,preservation of their young and conserves none of the spirit of
5395,V,artifice and calculation so necessary to authentic brewing operations.
5396,V,
5397,V,"""Brewing was possible only when the stability of the human race was,"
5398,V,"more or less, assured and permanent. Our primal ancestors existed in a"
5399,V,state as nearly resembling chaos as well might be. They had not yet
5400,V,"aggregated into communities, but vast hordes of families--a father, an"
5401,V,"uncertain number of mothers, and an astounding complexity of"
5402,V,"children--wandered wherever food seemed most abundant, and fought with"
5403,V,or eluded such other families as they chanced upon. This state of
5404,V,existence was too precarious and haphazard to allow of the niceties of
5405,V,brewing being evolved.
5406,V,
5407,V,"""But the natural tendency of families to lengthen, the gregarious"
5408,V,"instincts of the race, and the need of mutual protection and assistance"
5409,V,ultimately welded these indiscriminate families into communities of
5410,V,"ever-varying extent, and the movement of these huge troops and"
5411,V,transportation of their baggage becoming more and more difficult
5412,V,"(vehicles being unknown and horses, perhaps, treble-toed, wily and"
5413,V,"ferocious) and food, which until then had only been obtained in a"
5414,V,"fugitive state, becoming less easy of access, these communities were"
5415,V,"forced to select a settled habitation, scratch the earth for provender,"
5416,V,"settled down to the breeding of one-toed horses, and exercise the"
5417,V,respectable virtues of thrift and industry for their preservation.
5418,V,"Thus, laws were formulated, tentative and unsatisfactory at first, and"
5419,V,"ever tending, as to this day, to become more complex and less"
5420,V,"satisfactory. Villages took shape, straggled into towns, widened into"
5421,V,"cities and coalesced into kingdoms and empires: and so, the"
5422,V,"civilisation of which we are partakers crawled laboriously into being,"
5423,V,"with the brewer somewhere in the centre, active, rubicund and"
5424,V,"disputatious, as he has continued to date, with a seat on the County"
5425,V,"Council which he had swindled some thirsty statesman out of, and more"
5426,V,property than he could deal with by himself.
5427,V,
5428,V,"""It is a singular reflection that thirst has very little to do with the"
5429,V,"consumption of drink, nor is this appetite subject to the vagaries of"
5430,V,"climate, for the inhabitants of the coldest regions will, it is feared,"
5431,V,drink on equal terms with those dwelling in the sun-burnt tropics. In
5432,V,"almost all ceremonial observances drinking has had a special place, and"
5433,V,this diversion lends itself to an infinite number of objects--we can
5434,V,from the same bowl quaff health to our friends and confusion to our
5435,V,"enemies, doubtless with equal results. Here alone men meet on equal"
5436,V,"terms. There is no religion, nationality or politics in liquor: let it"
5437,V,be but sufficiently wet and potent and it matters not if the brew has
5438,V,been fermented in the tub of a Christian or the vessel of a heathen
5439,V,Turk.
5440,V,
5441,V,"""I understand that this latter race are forbidden, by the form of"
5442,V,"heresy which they call religion, to use liquors more potent than"
5443,V,sherbet. Some thinkers believe that this deprivation is possibly the
5444,V,"reason of their being Turks.--They are Turks, not from conviction, but"
5445,V,"from habit, spite, and the bile engendered by a too rigid and bigoted"
5446,V,"abstinence. In this belief, however, I do not concur, for I consider"
5447,V,"that a Turk is a Turk naturally, and without any further constraint"
5448,V,than those imposed by the laws of geography and primogeniture.
5449,V,
5450,V,"""Meanwhile it is interesting to speculate on the future of an abstinent"
5451,V,nation whose politics have the misfortune to be guided by a Peerage
5452,V,"instead of a Beerage, and whose national destiny is irrationally"
5453,V,divorced from the interests of 'The Trade.' Any departure from the
5454,V,"established customs of humanity must be criticised unsparingly, and, if"
5455,V,"necessary, destructively. To overthrow the customs of antiquity must"
5456,V,entail its own punishment and that punishment may be an awe-inspiring
5457,V,"and chastening Success. Therefore, this happy whisky-governed land of"
5458,V,ours should never forsake its liquor or it may be forced by opportunity
5459,V,and work to become great. The foundations of our civilisation are
5460,V,"steeped in beer--let no sacrilegious hand seek to interfere with it,"
5461,V,"for, even if the foundations were rotten, the interests of the Trade"
5462,V,"must not be disturbed, the grave and learned members of our Corporation"
5463,V,"might be horribly reduced to working for their living, and our"
5464,V,unfortunate City might have the extraordinary misfortune to scramble
5465,V,"out of debt in the absence of its statesmen."""
5466,V,
5467,V,"The old gentleman, with a bright smile, said that ""he did not mind if"
5468,V,"he did,"" and he ""did"" with such gusto that I had to call a cab."
5469,V,
5470,V,
5471,VI,VI
5472,VI,
5473,VI,The old gentleman came in hurriedly and called for that to which he was
5474,VI,"accustomed. He fumbled in one pocket after another, and after going over"
5475,VI,"all his pockets several times he remarked to me ""I have forgotten my"
5476,VI,"purse."" His air was so friendly and confiding that it more than repaid"
5477,VI,me for the small sum which I had to advance. He sat down close beside
5478,VI,"me, and, after touching on the difficulty of being understood in a"
5479,VI,"tavern, he drew genially to these remarks--"
5480,VI,
5481,VI,"""Language may be described as a medium for recording one's sensations."
5482,VI,It is gesture translated into sound. It is noise with a meaning. Music
5483,VI,"cannot at all compare with it, for music is no more than the scientific"
5484,VI,"distribution of noise, and it does not impart any meaning to the"
5485,VI,disintegrated and harried tumults. Language may be divided into several
5486,VI,"heads, which, again, may be subdivided almost indefinitely.--The primary"
5487,VI,"heads are, language, talk, and speech. Speech is the particular form of"
5488,VI,noise which is made by Members of Parliament. Language is the symbols
5489,VI,whereby one lady in a back street makes audible her impressions of the
5490,VI,lady who lives on the same floor--it is often extremely sinewy. Talk may
5491,VI,be described as the crime of people who make one tired.
5492,VI,
5493,VI,"""It is my opinion that people talk too much. I think the world would be"
5494,VI,a healthier and better place if it were more silent. On every day that
5495,VI,passes there is registered over all the earth a vast amount of language
5496,VI,"which, so far as I can see, has not the slightest bearing on anything"
5497,VI,anywhere.
5498,VI,
5499,VI,"""I have been told of a race living in Central Africa, or elsewhere, who"
5500,VI,by an inherent culture were enabled to dispense with speech. They
5501,VI,"whistled, and by practice had attained so copious and flexible a"
5502,VI,"vocabulary that they could whistle good-morning and good-night, or"
5503,VI,"how-do-you-do with equal facility and distinction. This, while it is a"
5504,VI,"step in the right direction, is not a sufficiently long step. To live"
5505,VI,among these people might appear very like living in a cageful of canaries
5506,VI,or parrots. Parrots are a very superior race who usually travel with
5507,VI,sailors. They have a whistle which can be guided or deflected into
5508,VI,various by-ways. I once knew a parrot who was employed by a sailor-man
5509,VI,to curse for him when his own speech was suspended by liquor. He could
5510,VI,"also whistle ballads and polkas, and had attained an astonishing"
5511,VI,"proficiency in these arts; for, by long practice, he could dovetail"
5512,VI,"curses and whistles in a most energetic and, indeed, astonishing manner."
5513,VI,"It would often project two whistles and a curse, sometimes two curses and"
5514,VI,"a whistle, while all the time keeping faithfully to the tune of 'The"
5515,VI,Sailor's Grave' or another. It was a highly cultivated and erudite
5516,VI,"person. As it advanced in learning it took naturally to chewing tobacco,"
5517,VI,"but, being a person of strongly experimental habits, it tried one day to"
5518,VI,"curse and whistle and chew tobacco at the one moment, with the"
5519,VI,unfortunate result that a piece of honeydew got jammed between a whistle
5520,VI,"and a curse, and the poor thing perished miserably of strangulation."
5521,VI,
5522,VI,"""It is indeed singular that while every race of mankind is competent to"
5523,VI,"speak, none of the other races, such as cats, cows, caterpillars, and"
5524,VI,"crabs, have shown the slightest interest in the making of this ordered"
5525,VI,noise. This is the more strange when we reflect that almost all animals
5526,VI,are provided with a throat and a mouth which are capable of making a
5527,VI,noise certainly equal in volume and intelligibility to the sounds made by
5528,VI,a German or a Spaniard.
5529,VI,
5530,VI,"""Long ago men lived in trees and had elongated backbones which they were"
5531,VI,"able to twitch. There were no shops, theatres, or churches in those"
5532,VI,"times, and, consequently, no necessity for a specialized and meticulous"
5533,VI,"prosody. Man barked at his fellow-man when he wanted something, and if"
5534,VI,his request was not understood he bit his fellow-man and was quit of him.
5535,VI,When they forsook the trees and became ground-walkers they came into
5536,VI,"contact with a variety of theretofore unknown objects, the necessity for"
5537,VI,naming which so exercised their tongues that gradually their bark took on
5538,VI,a different quality and became susceptible of more complicated sounds.
5539,VI,"Then, with the dawning of the Pastoral Age, food in a gregarious"
5540,VI,community became a matter of more especial importance. When a man barked
5541,VI,at his wife for a cocoanut and she handed him a baby or a bowl of soup or
5542,VI,"an evening paper it became necessary, in order to minimise her"
5543,VI,"alternatives, that he should elaborate his bark to meet this and an"
5544,VI,hundred other circumstances. I do not know at what period of history man
5545,VI,was able to call his wife names with the certainty of reprisal. It was
5546,VI,"possible quite early, because I have often heard a dog bark in a"
5547,VI,dissatisfied and important manner at another dog and be perfectly
5548,VI,comprehended.
5549,VI,
5550,VI,"""A difficulty would certainly arise as to the selection of a word when"
5551,VI,forty or fifty men might at the same time label any article with as many
5552,VI,"different names, and, it is reasonable to suppose, that they would be"
5553,VI,reluctant to adopt any other expression but that of their own creation.
5554,VI,In such a crux the strongest man of the community would be likely to
5555,VI,clout the others to an admission that his terminology was standard.
5556,VI,
5557,VI,"""Thus, by slow accretions, the various languages crept into currency, and"
5558,VI,the youth of innumerable schoolboys has been embittered by having to
5559,VI,learn to spell.
5560,VI,
5561,VI,"""Grasshoppers are a fine, sturdy race of people. A great many of them"
5562,VI,"live on the Hill of Howth, where I have often spent hours hearkening to"
5563,VI,their charming conversation. They do not speak with the same machinery
5564,VI,that we use--they convey their ideas to each other by rubbing their
5565,VI,"hind-legs together, whereupon noises are produced of exceeding variety"
5566,VI,"and interest. As a method of speech this is simply delightful, and I"
5567,VI,wish we could be trained to converse in so majestical a manner. Perhaps
5568,VI,we shall live to see the day when the journals will chronicle that Mr.
5569,VI,Redmond had rubbed his legs together for three hours at the Treasury
5570,VI,"Bench and was removed frothing at the feet, but after a little rest he"
5571,VI,"was enabled to return and make more noise than ever."""
5572,VI,
5573,VI,The old gentleman smiled very genially and went out. The assistant
5574,VI,"suggested that he had a terrible lot of old ""guff,"" but I did not agree"
5575,VI,with him.
5576,VI,
5577,VI,
5578,VII,VII
5579,VII,
5580,VII,Between impartial sips at his own and my liquor the old gentleman
5581,VII,perused the small volume which he had taken from my pocket. After he
5582,VII,had read it he buttoned the book in his own pouch and addressed me with
5583,VII,great kindness--
5584,VII,
5585,VII,"""In some respects,"" said he, ""poets differ materially from other"
5586,VII,"animals. For instance, they seldom marry, and when they do it is only"
5587,VII,under extreme compulsion.--This is the more singular when we remember
5588,VII,that poets are almost continually singing about love. When they do
5589,VII,marry they instantly cease to make poetry and turn to labour like the
5590,VII,rest of the community.
5591,VII,
5592,VII,"""It has been finely said that the poet is born and not made, but I"
5593,VII,fancy that this might be postulated of the rest of creation.
5594,VII,
5595,VII,"""Many people believe that all poets arise from their beds in the middle"
5596,VII,"of the night, and that they walk ten miles until they come to a"
5597,VII,"hillside, where they remain until the dawn whistling to the little"
5598,VII,"birds; but this, while it is true in some instances, is not invariably"
5599,VII,true. A proper poet would not walk ten miles for any one except a
5600,VII,publisher.
5601,VII,
5602,VII,"""The art of writing poetry is very difficult at first, but it becomes"
5603,VII,easy by practice. The best way for a beginner is to take a line from
5604,VII,"another poem; then he should construct a line to fit it; then, having"
5605,VII,"won his start, he should strike out the first line (which, of course,"
5606,VII,does not belong to him) and go ahead. When the poet has written three
5607,VII,verses of four lines each he should run out and find a girl somewhere
5608,VII,and read it to her. Girls are always delighted when this is done.
5609,VII,"They usually clasp their hands together as though in pain, roll their"
5610,VII,"eyes in an ecstasy, and shout, 'How perfectly perfect!' Then the poet"
5611,VII,will grip both her hands very tightly and say he loves her but will not
5612,VII,"marry her, and, in an agony of inspiration, he will tear himself away"
5613,VII,"and stand drinks to himself until he is put out. This is, of course,"
5614,VII,only one way of being a poet. If he perseveres he will ultimately
5615,VII,write lyrics for the music halls and make a fortune. He will then wear
5616,VII,"a fur coat that died of the mange, he will support a carnation in his"
5617,VII,"buttonhole, wear eighteen rings on his right hand and one hundred and"
5618,VII,twenty-seven on his left. He will also be entitled to wear two
5619,VII,breast-pins at once and yellow boots. He will live in England when he
5620,VII,"is at home, and be very friendly with duchesses."
5621,VII,
5622,VII,"""Poetry is the oldest of the arts. Indeed, it may be called the parent"
5623,VII,"of the arts. Poetry, music, and dancing are the only relics which have"
5624,VII,come down to us from those ancient times which are termed impartially
5625,VII,the Golden or the Arboreal Ages. In ancient Ireland the part played by
5626,VII,"the poet was very important. Not alone was he the singer of songs, he"
5627,VII,"was also the bestower of fame and the keeper of genealogies, and,"
5628,VII,"therefore, he was treated with a dignity which he has since refused to"
5629,VII,"forget. When a poet made a song in public, it was customary that the"
5630,VII,"king and the nobility should divest themselves of their jewels, gold"
5631,VII,"chains, and rings, and give this light plunder to him. They also"
5632,VII,"bestowed on him goblets of gold and silver, herds of cattle, farms, and"
5633,VII,maidservants. The poets are not at all happy in these constricted
5634,VII,"times, and will proclaim their astonishment and repugnance in the"
5635,VII,roundest language.
5636,VII,
5637,VII,"""A few days ago I was speaking in Grafton Street to a poet of great"
5638,VII,"eminence, and, with tears in his voice, he told me that he had never"
5639,VII,been offered as much as a bracelet by any lady. Times have changed;
5640,VII,but for the person who still wishes to enter this decayed profession
5641,VII,"there is still every opportunity, for poetry is only the art of cutting"
5642,VII,"sentences into equal lengths, and then getting these sentences printed"
5643,VII,by a publisher. It is in the latter part of this formula that the real
5644,VII,art consists.
5645,VII,
5646,VII,"""There are a great many poets in Ireland, particularly in Dublin. In"
5647,VII,an evening's walk one may meet at least a dozen of this peculiar
5648,VII,"people. They may be known by the fact that they wear large, soft hats,"
5649,VII,and that the breast-pockets of their coats have a more than noticeable
5650,VII,"bulge, due to their habit of carrying therein the twenty-seven"
5651,VII,masterpieces which they have just written. They are very ethereal
5652,VII,"creatures, composed largely of soul and thirst. Soul is a far-away,"
5653,VII,"eerie thing, generally produced by eating fish."""
5654,VII,
5655,VII,The old gentleman borrowed the price of a tram home; but as he
5656,VII,"instantly stood himself a drink with it, I was forced to relend him the"
5657,VII,money when we got outside.
5658,VII,
5659,VII,
5660,VIII,VIII
5661,VIII,
5662,VIII,The old gentleman was in a very bad temper when I arrived. He had a
5663,VIII,"large glass of porter in his hand--a pint, in fact--and he was gazing"
5664,VIII,on this liquid with no great favour. I was a little surprised at his
5665,VIII,"choice of a drink, for I had never before known him care for any other"
5666,VIII,refreshment than spirits; but I did not like to make any reference to
5667,VIII,"the change. Looking thus, with great disgust, upon his pint, he began"
5668,VIII,to talk with some asperity about the English nation.
5669,VIII,
5670,VIII,"""The ways of Providence,"" said he, ""are indeed inscrutable, else why"
5671,VIII,"should there be such things in the world as lobsters, gutta-percha,"
5672,VIII,"ballet-dancers, and Englishmen? These four objects, and some"
5673,VIII,"others--notably water, tram-cars, and warts--I can find no necessity"
5674,VIII,"for in nature; but there must be some reason for such, or else they"
5675,VIII,could not have arrived at the more or less mature stage of development
5676,VIII,at which they are found.
5677,VIII,
5678,VIII,"""If we apply the canons of the Pragmatic philosophy to these objects we"
5679,VIII,"will arrive at some conclusion which, although it may not justify their"
5680,VIII,"existence, will give a hint as to their expediency. The question to be"
5681,VIII,put to any doubtful fact in nature is this--'What is your use?' and the
5682,VIII,reality of the fact is in ratio to the degree of usefulness inhering in
5683,VIII,"it. Thus treated, most of the objects to which I have referred may be"
5684,VIII,able to adduce some excuse for their existence. A lobster may aver
5685,VIII,that if he were not alive his absence would be a severe blow to the
5686,VIII,"lobster-pot industry, and would throw many respectable families on the"
5687,VIII,already-overburdened rates. Gutta-percha might plead that it has
5688,VIII,aspired through many millions of ages to a maturity which would enable
5689,VIII,it to rub out lead-pencil marks. Ballet-dancers would have a great
5690,VIII,"deal to say for themselves, possibly on moral grounds; but I really see"
5691,VIII,no reason for Englishmen.
5692,VIII,
5693,VIII,"""I have said that an object is real in ratio to its usefulness. If we"
5694,VIII,examine an Englishman thus pragmatically we must discover that his
5695,VIII,"usefulness is zero, and we are then forced to inquire why he exists at"
5696,VIII,"all, for he does undoubtedly exist, as witness this pint of porter"
5697,VIII,"which I hold in my hand, and which I do hold in my hand solely on"
5698,VIII,account of the unexplainable existence of Englishmen.
5699,VIII,
5700,VIII,"""I may say at once that I never indulge in this particular form of"
5701,VIII,"refreshment, against which I have nothing further to charge than it"
5702,VIII,"does not agree with my system, but I am no bigot in such matters, and"
5703,VIII,can quite willingly believe that lower natures and less cultivated
5704,VIII,palates may take pleasure in secreting this inordinately lengthy
5705,VIII,liquid. I cannot avoid the belief that any liquid which may be imbibed
5706,VIII,"by the imperial pint is an essentially gross drink, and one unfitted"
5707,VIII,for persons of a high culture. Nor can I find in nature that any of
5708,VIII,the more specialised organisms take their drink in such extravagant
5709,VIII,"quantities. Camels, who, I am informed, are a very well-behaved and"
5710,VIII,"moral race leading rigorous and chaste lives in a desert, do drink"
5711,VIII,"deeply, but their excess is more apparent than real, for Providence in"
5712,VIII,an aberration endowed these folk with more stomachs than the average
5713,VIII,"person possesses, and the necessity for filling these additional"
5714,VIII,cisterns accounts for and justifies their liberal use of moisture.
5715,VIII,"Worms, on the other hand, are a folk for whom I have very little"
5716,VIII,reverence and no affection. I am not aware whether they are all
5717,VIII,"stomach or all neck, but from their corner-boy expression I am inclined"
5718,VIII,"to fancy that worms would drink pints if they could. Happily, this"
5719,VIII,disgusting exhibition is forbidden by the imperfect state of their
5720,VIII,civilisation and the inelastic quality of their environment.
5721,VIII,
5722,VIII,"""But this is beside the point. My grievance is, that in my old age I"
5723,VIII,"am forced to drink porter which disagrees with my liver, and am"
5724,VIII,compelled to abstain from spirits which have a sustaining and medicinal
5725,VIII,"effect on that organ, and this deprivation is solely due to the"
5726,VIII,unnatural and inexplicable existence of Englishmen. It may be that
5727,VIII,nature grew Englishmen for the sole purpose of interfering with my
5728,VIII,"organs, and so, by modifying my teaching in accordance with my diseased"
5729,VIII,"interior, nature may be striving to evolve a new culture wherein bile"
5730,VIII,"will have a rare ability. If this is so, then I am not at all obliged"
5731,VIII,to nature for singling me out as the instrument of her changes; if it
5732,VIII,is not so I can only confess my ignorance and wash my hands of the
5733,VIII,matter.
5734,VIII,
5735,VIII,"""Mark you, it was only during my lifetime that an exorbitant tax was"
5736,VIII,placed on whisky. Before my era the interference with this refreshment
5737,VIII,was of the most tentative and apologetic description.
5738,VIII,
5739,VIII,"""I can remember, and I do remember with dismay, the time when whisky"
5740,VIII,"was purchaseable at two bronze pennies for the naggin, but now one may"
5741,VIII,discharge a ruinous impost for the privilege of imbibing one poor
5742,VIII,fourth of that happy measure.
5743,VIII,
5744,VIII,"""This has been brought about by the continuous interference of"
5745,VIII,Englishmen with my liquor. Time and again they have added additional
5746,VIII,"difficulties to my obtaining this medicinal refreshment, and, while I"
5747,VIII,am compelled to bow my head to the ideas of nature for the improvement
5748,VIII,"of our race, I am often inclined, having bowed it, to charge goat-like"
5749,VIII,at these intolerable people and butt them off the face of the earth
5750,VIII,into the nowhere for which their villainous and ungenial habits have
5751,VIII,"fitted them. Otherwise, by their future exactions I may be brought to"
5752,VIII,the drinking of benzene or printer's ink for lack of a fortune
5753,VIII,"wherewith to purchase fitter refreshment."""
5754,VIII,
5755,VIII,"Having said this with great fury, the old gentleman laid down his"
5756,VIII,untasted pint and stalked out. The acolyte behind the counter made a
5757,VIII,sympathetic clicking noise with his tongue and sold the pint to another
5758,VIII,"man.--He probably did this thoughtlessly, and I did not care to"
5759,VIII,embarrass him by remarking on it.
5760,VIII,
5761,VIII,
5762,IX,IX
5763,IX,
5764,IX,I met the old gentleman marching solemnly across Cork Hill. There was
5765,IX,"a tramcar in his immediate rear, a cab in front of him, an outside-car"
5766,IX,"and a bicycle on his right hand, and a dray laden with barrels on his"
5767,IX,left. The drivers of all these vehicles were entreating him in one
5768,IX,"voice to stroll elsewhere. He looked around and, observing that"
5769,IX,"matters were complicated, he opened his umbrella, held it over his"
5770,IX,"head, and awaited events with the most admirable fortitude. When I had"
5771,IX,"escorted him to the pavement, and further to his own hostelry, he"
5772,IX,seized the third button of my waistcoat and spake as follows:--
5773,IX,
5774,IX,"""It is an admirable example of the wisdom of nature that she has"
5775,IX,refrained in every case from equipping her creatures with wheels
5776,IX,"instead of legs, and she might easily have done this. So far as I am"
5777,IX,"aware there are but four methods of progression in nature--these are,"
5778,IX,"flying, swimming, walking and crawling. None of these are performed"
5779,IX,"with a rotary motion, and all are admirably adapted to the people using"
5780,IX,"them, and are sufficiently expeditious to suit their needs."
5781,IX,
5782,IX,"""There is no doubt that the most primitive of movements is that of"
5783,IX,"crawling, and by this method of progression, one is brought into an"
5784,IX,intimate contact with the earth which cannot fail to be beneficial. I
5785,IX,do not see any real difficulty in the way of our again becoming a race
5786,IX,of happy and crawling people. The initial essay towards this end is to
5787,IX,"shed our arms and legs as useless incumbrances, and then to aim at a"
5788,IX,stronger growth of jaw and cranium. Among certain organisms it will be
5789,IX,"found that the jaws are the most immediately useful parts of the body,"
5790,IX,performing the most varied and delicate functions with the greatest
5791,IX,"ease. A dog, for example, will, with the one organ, play with a ball,"
5792,IX,"kill a cat, or nip the calf of a Christian, and, when the moon is high,"
5793,IX,he can make a noise with his mouth which is as loud and quite as
5794,IX,melodious as the professional clamour of a ballad-vocalist.
5795,IX,
5796,IX,"""One of the greatest evils of civilisation is the longing for speed,"
5797,IX,"which, within the past hundred years, has developed from a simple vice"
5798,IX,to a complicated mania. Long ago men were accustomed to use their legs
5799,IX,"in order to propel themselves forward, and, when greater speed was"
5800,IX,"necessary, they assisted their legs with their hands--this was coeval"
5801,IX,"with, or shortly after, the arboreal age. Next came the hunting epoch,"
5802,IX,"when some person, probably a commercial traveller, dropped off a tree"
5803,IX,"on to a horse's back, and finding the movement pleasant he informed his"
5804,IX,companions of his adventure and demonstrated to them how it had been
5805,IX,performed. It is from this occurrence we may date the degradation of
5806,IX,the human race and the industry of horse-stealing. There followed the
5807,IX,"pastoral age, when nuts were, more or less, abandoned as a food and"
5808,IX,tillage became general. The necessity for conveying the crops from the
5809,IX,"field to the camp excited some lazy individual to invent a cart, and,"
5810,IX,"thus, wheels came into use and the doom of humanity as an instinctive"
5811,IX,and natural race was sealed.
5812,IX,
5813,IX,"""While we walked on our own legs we were natural and instinctive"
5814,IX,"creatures, open to every impression of nature and able to tell the time"
5815,IX,"without clocks, but when we adopted mechanical methods of progression"
5816,IX,"we became unnatural and mechanical people, whizzing restlessly and"
5817,IX,"recklessly from here to yonder, for no purpose save the mere sensual"
5818,IX,"pleasure of movement, and we are at this date simply debauched by"
5819,IX,travel and have shortened the world to less than one-tenth of its
5820,IX,actual size as well as destroying our abilities for simple and rational
5821,IX,enjoyment.
5822,IX,
5823,IX,"""If we continue using these artificial means of locomotion there is no"
5824,IX,doubt that the race will become atrophied in the legs but with
5825,IX,extraordinary results. The spectacle of an egg-shaped humanity
5826,IX,"squatting painfully on engines is not a pleasant one to contemplate,"
5827,IX,nor is the prospect of a world wherein there will be neither breeches
5828,IX,nor boots good for the moralist or economist to dwell upon.
5829,IX,
5830,IX,"""In order to conserve the happiness of the world every inventor should"
5831,IX,"be squashed in the egg, more particularly those having anything to do"
5832,IX,"with wheels, cogs or levers. The wheel has no counterpart in nature,"
5833,IX,and is unthinkable to any but a diseased and curious mind. Man will
5834,IX,never more be happy until he has broken all the machinery he can find
5835,IX,"with a hammer, and has then thrown the hammer into the sea; and then he"
5836,IX,"can, by experiment, become almost as rooted in the earth as a tree or"
5837,IX,an artesian well. It is a bad thing to have an indefinite horizon. It
5838,IX,is a good thing to grow knowing one part of the world as thoroughly as
5839,IX,"one knows the inside of one's boots. Legs make for nationality,"
5840,IX,"patriotism, and all the virtues which centre in locality. Wheels make"
5841,IX,"for diffuseness, imperialisms, cosmopolitanisms. By the use of legs"
5842,IX,humanity has stalked into manhood. By the use of wheels we are rapidly
5843,IX,"rolling into a race of commercial travellers, touts, gad-abouts, and"
5844,IX,"members of parliament, folk with the hanging jaws of astonishment, avid"
5845,IX,"for curios, and with mental, moral and optical indigestion."
5846,IX,
5847,IX,"""I believe that the Spanyols and Mandibaloes, two Mongol races"
5848,IX,"inhabiting the countries at the rear of the Great Chow Desert, were the"
5849,IX,first people to deal largely with wheels. The men of these nations
5850,IX,"were used, when travelling, to affix two small wheels upon their"
5851,IX,"shoulder blades, and on coming to any slight incline in their path they"
5852,IX,"would curl up their legs, lie on their backs and free-wheel as"
5853,IX,"distantly as the slant of the ground permitted, greatly, no doubt, to"
5854,IX,"the astonishment of less sophisticated people. But, knowing their"
5855,IX,"habits, their enemies were wont to lie in wait at the bottoms of hills"
5856,IX,"and slopes, and when a Spanyol or Mandibaloe came wheeling down a hill"
5857,IX,with his legs up he was killed before he could regain a less
5858,IX,"complicated position, or one more fitted for defence or offence. Thus,"
5859,IX,"these races became rapidly extinct, and are now only remembered by the"
5860,IX,tracks as wide as a man's shoulderblades which are occasionally found
5861,IX,"in parts of the post-tertiary formation."""
5862,IX,
5863,IX,The old gentleman released the third button of my waistcoat which he
5864,IX,had held for so long and stepped with me out of the hostel. As it had
5865,IX,"begun to rain he carefully folded up his umbrella, tucked it under his"
5866,IX,"arm, and strode rapidly down the street. Some small boys followed him"
5867,IX,"for a little time singing, ""We are the boys of Wexford who fought with"
5868,IX,"heart and hand,"" but I drove these away."
5869,IX,
5870,IX,
5871,X,X
5872,X,
5873,X,"He wiped his face with a large, red pocket-handkerchief, pursed his"
5874,X,"lips, shut one eye, and, with the other, he critically observed the"
5875,X,remnant of his liquor. After a moment of deep consideration he smiled
5876,X,delightfully and said he thought it was all right. The apothecary
5877,X,behind the counter smiled also as one gratified and suggested that
5878,X,"there was not much of that at the North Pole, and, after a little"
5879,X,"discussion on this point, the old gentleman addressed me in the"
5880,X,following words:--
5881,X,
5882,X,"""I do not understand what necessity impels people to the discovery of"
5883,X,"something, which, if it has any existence at all, has only an"
5884,X,"idealistic existence, and which, when it is discovered, cannot be"
5885,X,utilised in any possible direction. Utility is the first attribute of
5886,X,"all terrestrial bodies. A stone, for instance, is a useful inorganic"
5887,X,"substance--it can be built into a house, or thrown at a duck, or, when"
5888,X,"ground into sand, it can be, and is, sold as sugar by a grocer. It is"
5889,X,constantly being utilised in one or other of these directions; and so
5890,X,with all other objects. But the necessity for a North or a South Pole
5891,X,has yet to be demonstrated.
5892,X,
5893,X,"""The statement that the North Pole was put there by the Castle"
5894,X,"authorities is one which I do not believe, for I am assured that at"
5895,X,every period of the world's history there has been a North and a South
5896,X,"Pole, which, surrounded as they were by snow-clad countries, icebergs,"
5897,X,"cold water and whales, were too remote and inhospitable to tempt the"
5898,X,average civilian to journey there.
5899,X,
5900,X,"""The only thing which grows in the Polar regions is ice, and this is"
5901,X,"generally found in almost tropical profusion and rankness, growing"
5902,X,"sometimes to the height of several hundred feet, none of which wear"
5903,X,"boots. Polar bears and Esquimos are also found there, but in scattered"
5904,X,and inconsiderable quantities. These two races spend most of their
5905,X,"time chasing each other in order to keep themselves warm, which they do"
5906,X,by degrees which are often registered on a barometer. They also eat
5907,X,each other and get scurvy. Outside of these relaxations their
5908,X,existence is stagnant and unexciting. I sometimes fancy that if I had
5909,X,the misfortune to be born a polar bear or an Esquimo I would not have
5910,X,been a patriot.
5911,X,
5912,X,"""I have no esteem for ice in other than easily portable quantities."
5913,X,"Some small pieces to pack around fish, a particle to drop into a glass"
5914,X,of lager beer--that is all the ice which I can regard patiently or
5915,X,leniently; but a continent composed entirely of ice and polar bears
5916,X,tempts me to believe that Providence is subject to aberrations.
5917,X,
5918,X,"""It is supposed to redound to the credit of a nation when one of its"
5919,X,"citizens resolves to discover some inaccessible and futile place, and"
5920,X,proceeds to do so in the most fantastic manner. The inhabitants of
5921,X,that country who remain at their work and continue to pay their rates
5922,X,are expected to be in a condition of wild enthusiasm and delight at the
5923,X,"adventure.--My own impression is, that the majority of people take no"
5924,X,"more than a tepid interest in these forlorn adventures, and are but"
5925,X,imperfectly convinced of the sanity of the adventurers; and this is the
5926,X,more particularly noticeable when the quest is for something so
5927,X,intangible and unmarketable as a North Pole. Why need they go so far
5928,X,afield for their excitement? Every discoverer is a detective. He
5929,X,"traces missing places, and there are cartloads of Poles in their own"
5930,X,countries waiting for explorers.
5931,X,
5932,X,"""The habit of seeking for a North Pole is one of only comparative"
5933,X,"antiquity. Its conception is well within the historic era, and must,"
5934,X,"therefore, be classed as an acquired habit and one not inherent in man."
5935,X,I have not observed that any other animals are addicted to this
5936,X,peculiar expeditionary craze. It is true that many species of birds
5937,X,"migrate annually from these shores, and, although their departures are"
5938,X,"usually chronicled in the newspapers, it must not without further"
5939,X,evidence be inferred that these birds have gone to look for the North
5940,X,"Pole. They may, as a matter of fact, have left this country to avoid"
5941,X,"being arrested, for here one is continually being arrested. The"
5942,X,"evidence in favour of the North Pole theory as regards birds is, that"
5943,X,"nobody knows where they have gone to, and that as the rest of the earth"
5944,X,is round and densely populated their arrival would be noted somewhere
5945,X,"as their departure was, but their arrival not being so noted, and as"
5946,X,"they must be somewhere, the process of eliminating all possible places"
5947,X,leaves nowhere but the North Pole as their objective. Now birds are a
5948,X,very intelligent and strenuous race of people who build nests in trees
5949,X,"and have often five eggs at a time, and I believe that they leave these"
5950,X,"countries because their nests are full of broken egg-shells, and"
5951,X,"because the winter is setting in, and because they dislike cold"
5952,X,"weather; and, thus disliking cold weather, it is unlikely that they"
5953,X,"would fly to the North Pole where the cold is very intense, and where,"
5954,X,"moreover, there is little food to be found, saving polar bears and"
5955,X,"Esquimos, a form of victual for which birds have only the scantiest"
5956,X,"relish. My own impression is, that these birds when out of sight of"
5957,X,"land are enabled by a mechanism with which we are not yet familiar, to"
5958,X,"convert themselves into fishes, or, alternatively, that they know the"
5959,X,"whereabouts of Tir na n-Og and go there, or else that they do not go"
5960,X,anywhere at all but are simply translated into the Fourth Dimension of
5961,X,"Space, and are, thus, flying, nesting and mating all around us in a"
5962,X,medium which our eyes are too gross to penetrate.
5963,X,
5964,X,"""From a perusal of the evening papers I observe that the discoverer of"
5965,X,"the North Pole is an American citizen with a complicated pedigree, a"
5966,X,"long beard and a red shirt, all of which he hoisted to the top of the"
5967,X,Pole and left there for subsequent identification. I fear this was a
5968,X,thoughtless action on his part because the Esquimos who live habitually
5969,X,"at the North Pole, but have not discovered it, will, while his back is"
5970,X,"turned, take to wearing his shirt in turn. They are a communistic"
5971,X,"people, I fancy, and no shirt will survive communism. Also, seeing the"
5972,X,"fuss which is being made of their Pole, they may either hide it or sell"
5973,X,pieces of it to tourists as remembrancers.
5974,X,
5975,X,"""The explorer should have cached his shirt and other memorials at the"
5976,X,"foot of the Pole, built a cairn upon it, and shook cayenne pepper on"
5977,X,"top of all to keep bears away--but it is useless to advise explorers."""
5978,X,
5979,X,"The ancient hereupon made a significant gesture to the curate, who"
5980,X,"misinterpreted it, and brought more than he had required. He was very"
5981,X,"much perturbed, for, as he explained, he had forgotten to bring his"
5982,X,"purse with him. He consented, however, to use my purse for his needs,"
5983,X,"and, after paying his shot, he, in an abstracted and melancholy manner,"
5984,X,put the change in his trouser pocket. There was only one shilling in
5985,X,the purse so I did not like to draw his attention to the mistake. He
5986,X,"very genially returned my purse, and said he had conceived a great"
5987,X,liking for me.
5988,X,
5989,X,
5990,XI,XI
5991,XI,
5992,XI,When the old gentleman came in I noticed at once that he was out of
5993,XI,"humour. He had a large scar on his chin, and three pieces of newspaper"
5994,XI,on his cheeks. He discharged the contents of my tobacco pouch into a
5995,XI,"pipe which had a holding capacity of one and a half ounces, and then he"
5996,XI,became more cheerful--
5997,XI,
5998,XI,"""I dislike extremely,"" said he, ""the impertinent interference with"
5999,XI,nature which men are nowadays guilty of. Not content with clamping our
6000,XI,"feet in leathern boxes, our legs in cloth cylinders, our trunks in a"
6001,XI,"variety of wrappings of complex inutility, and then inserting our heads"
6002,XI,"into monstrous felt pots, we even approach ourselves more minutely and"
6003,XI,scrape the very hair from our faces which nature has sown there for
6004,XI,"purposes of ornament and protection; with the result, that it is"
6005,XI,difficult for a short-sighted person to distinguish rapidly the sex of
6006,XI,the people with whom he comes in contact saving by a minute and tedious
6007,XI,examination of their clothing.
6008,XI,
6009,XI,"""This habit of shaving is one which is entirely confined to man. It is"
6010,XI,"the one particular habit that he holds apart from all other animals,"
6011,XI,"and, indeed, it is not an accomplishment upon which he need pride"
6012,XI,"himself, for in parting with his beard he has sacrificed the only"
6013,XI,pleasant-looking portion of his face.
6014,XI,
6015,XI,"""It could easily be proved that hair and innocence have a subtle"
6016,XI,"relationship. No very hairy person is really vicious, as witness the"
6017,XI,"caterpillar, of whom I have not heard that he ever bit any one: while,"
6018,XI,"on the other hand, the frog, who is born bald, would doubtless be very"
6019,XI,savage were it not for the fact that nature has benevolently curtailed
6020,XI,"his teeth. Fishes, also, an uncleanly race, and who I fancy are shaved"
6021,XI,"before birth, are all monsters of cold-blooded ferocity, and they will"
6022,XI,devour their parents and even their own offspring with equal and
6023,XI,indiscriminate enjoyment.
6024,XI,
6025,XI,"""The habit of shaving is not of a very ancient origin. When humanity"
6026,XI,"lived a quiet, rural and unambitious life, men did not shave: their"
6027,XI,"hair was their glory, and if they had occasion to swear, which must"
6028,XI,"have been infrequent, their hardiest and readiest oath was, 'by the"
6029,XI,"beard of my father,' showing clearly that this texture was held in"
6030,XI,veneration in early times and was probably accorded divine honours upon
6031,XI,suitable occasions.
6032,XI,
6033,XI,"""With the advent of war came the habit of shaving. A beard offered too"
6034,XI,"handy a grip to a foeman who had gotten to close quarters, therefore,"
6035,XI,warriors who had no true hardihood of soul preferred cutting off their
6036,XI,beards to the honourable labour of defending their chins. Many ancient
6037,XI,races effected a compromise in order to retain a fitting military
6038,XI,"appearance, for a bare-faced warrior has but little of terror in his"
6039,XI,"aspect. The ancient Egyptians, for example, who had cut off, or could"
6040,XI,"not cultivate, or had been forcibly deprived of their beards, were wont"
6041,XI,"to go into battle clad in heavy false whiskers, which, when an enemy"
6042,XI,"seized hold of them, came off instantly in his hand, and the ancient"
6043,XI,Egyptian was enabled to despatch him while in a trance of stupefaction
6044,XI,"and horror. Clean-shaved men became, by this cowardly stratagem, very"
6045,XI,"much prized as fighting men, and thus the foundation of the shaving"
6046,XI,habit was laid.
6047,XI,
6048,XI,"""It is a remarkable fact that, save for an inconsiderable number who"
6049,XI,"live in circuses, women have no beards. I am unable at present to"
6050,XI,"trace the reason for this singular omission, but the advantages of"
6051,XI,beards for women are too patent for explanation. They would improve
6052,XI,"her personal appearance, and their advantages as air-purifiers or"
6053,XI,respirators I need not dwell upon. I am certain that a persistent
6054,XI,application of goose-grease and electricity to the chin of a woman
6055,XI,would at last enable her to become as bearded and virtuous as her
6056,XI,"husband, besides entitling her to the political franchise. They are"
6057,XI,"perverse creatures, however, and it is possible that this deprivation"
6058,XI,is responsible for many of their ill-humours and crankinesses. Their
6059,XI,scarcity of beard is the more remarkable when we observe that the
6060,XI,female cat is as magnificently whiskered as her male companion. The
6061,XI,"wisdom of cats is proverbial, and I have never heard of a cat who has"
6062,XI,"hired another cat to bite out, tear off, scrape or otherwise demolish"
6063,XI,his or her whiskers. When I do hear of some such occurrence I shall be
6064,XI,prepared to reconsider my position on this subject.
6065,XI,
6066,XI,"""In some ways a clean-shaved face is desirable. A pig's cheek should"
6067,XI,"not have whiskers, neither should oysters nor the face of a clock, but"
6068,XI,a man's face should never be seen out of doors without a decent and
6069,XI,"honourable covering."""

6071,XI,"Having said this, the old gentleman, with remarkable presence of mind,"
6072,XI,"drank my whisky, and then apologised with dignified and touching"
6073,XI,humility. As we departed the youth behind the counter corrugated his
6074,XI,"features in a remarkable manner, and said, ""bow-wow"" by way of"
6075,XI,valediction.

6079,XII,
6080,XII,He helped himself absently to two water biscuits and a piece of cheese
6081,XII,and sank to a profound reverie. The eating of this light refreshment
6082,XII,"was probably a manifestation of subconscious thought, for, when he had"
6083,XII,"finished, he spoke to me as follows--"
6084,XII,
6085,XII,"""There are a great many things which I dislike immensely but the"
6086,XII,"necessity for which I must perforce acquiesce in: these are water,"
6087,XII,easterly winds and actresses: but there are other habits cultivated by
6088,XII,"humanity for which I can find no apology, and some of these have grown"
6089,XII,to so great an extent that they now bulk as evils of terrific
6090,XII,"magnitude."""
6091,XII,
6092,XII,"""Foremost among these reprehensible customs I will mention that of"
6093,XII,eating. Of all the evils under which civilisation staggers helplessly
6094,XII,"the most ponderous and merciless is hunger, and it is the evil which"
6095,XII,will ultimately decimate all existing forms of life.
6096,XII,
6097,XII,"""All forms of organic life have now for millions of years been slaves"
6098,XII,"to this filthy habit of eating, and have superimposed upon their"
6099,XII,original singleness of form a variety of weighty and unattractive
6100,XII,"organs to keep pace with the satisfaction of this oppressive appetite,"
6101,XII,until to-day the entire organic world stands upon the imminent brink of
6102,XII,destruction if food should be withheld from it for one entire week.
6103,XII,
6104,XII,"""Every living being should be self-supporting and self-sufficient. It"
6105,XII,should be inherent in the economy of a man to produce for himself not
6106,XII,alone food but also shelter and raiment from his own internal
6107,XII,resources. A man should be able to build a house or evolve a loaf of
6108,XII,bread out of his own body with ease and assurance.
6109,XII,
6110,XII,"""Look for a moment at spiders. Every spider carries within himself the"
6111,XII,"materials for his own home. His stomach, instead of being, as is"
6112,XII,"vulgarly supposed, a cemetery for smaller organisms, is in reality his"
6113,XII,"brick-field and rope-walk, and out of this minute sack he will produce"
6114,XII,endless miles of cordage and web which he weaves into the most
6115,XII,beautiful and mathematical harmonies. This is a self-contained utility
6116,XII,"which might be imitated by men with advantage, and that which is done"
6117,XII,with ease by a spider can scarcely offer insuperable difficulty to the
6118,XII,"chief of the vertebrates. Of course, each man's production will be"
6119,XII,"more or less guided and limited by his capacity.--Thus, fat men will"
6120,XII,"spin forth cathedrals, opera-houses and railway stations. Thin men"
6121,XII,"will devote themselves to obelisks, church spires, factory chimneys,"
6122,XII,and artistic bric-a-brac. Short men will willingly produce artisans'
6123,XII,"dwellings, busts of famous men and, perhaps, now and then, pyramids or"
6124,XII,villa residences. Constant work of this description will not alone
6125,XII,"render us independent of landlords, but, by atrophy of the digestive"
6126,XII,"organs, will inaugurate a brighter era for long-suffering, food-fed"
6127,XII,humanity.
6128,XII,
6129,XII,"""Suppose it is advanced that man cannot keep up his strength and"
6130,XII,usefulness without some kind of exterior nourishment--I will then
6131,XII,proceed to demonstrate how this can be most easily accomplished. Our
6132,XII,"first cousins, the trees and bushes, do not sit down at stated hours to"
6133,XII,"a heterogeneous mess of steak, tea and onions: they stand firm in the"
6134,XII,ground unhurried by the sound of the dinner-bell and careless of the
6135,XII,state of the American market. As the spider is sufficient in itself in
6136,XII,"house-building, so are the trees, the grass and all inorganic life"
6137,XII,"self-supporting so far as food is concerned. The reason is, that"
6138,XII,"trees, grass and flowers are bedded in the earth, the source of all"
6139,XII,"nourishment. Let this fact be but properly understood, and the last"
6140,XII,"and greatest bar to human progress will be removed, and 'the"
6141,XII,millenniums which so furiously chase us' will have a chance of catching
6142,XII,us up.
6143,XII,
6144,XII,"""If, once a week, men would bury themselves to the chin in good fertile"
6145,XII,"clay, and allow the nurture of the earth to permeate their bodies there"
6146,XII,would be an end to this gross and unfortunate digestive activity. I
6147,XII,have myself experimented in this direction with the most encouraging
6148,XII,"results. A rich, loamy soil is very good--it is rather cold at the"
6149,XII,"bottom, but invigorating. Light, sandy clay would suit sedentary"
6150,XII,"persons such as parsons, artists, judges. In poor ground some"
6151,XII,"superphosphates, or a light compost could be strewn by each person"
6152,XII,"around himself. Families would take turns in pruning each other, and"
6153,XII,so forth; but all these incidental matters would rapidly adjust
6154,XII,themselves. After a time we might succeed in propagating ourselves by
6155,XII,"seeds or slips, and this would lead to a radical readjustment of our"
6156,XII,sex relations and put an end to many of the problems wherewith we are
6157,XII,eternally badgered and perplexed.
6158,XII,
6159,XII,"""In some ways I will admit that food is valuable. As a means of"
6160,XII,"killing a rich uncle by gout, or of attaining wealth by judicious"
6161,XII,"adulteration it can be recommended, and looked at in the light of a"
6162,XII,gentle morning exercise to be taken immediately after rising it is
6163,XII,"useful, but as a method of obtaining nourishment it is obsolete and"
6164,XII,"disgustingly vulgar."""
6165,XII,
6166,XII,At this point the gentleman-in-waiting snorted in a most unbecoming
6167,XII,"manner, and dived under the counter, from beneath which he alternately"
6168,XII,mewed like a cat and crowed like a cock. It was a clear attack of
6169,XII,hysteria. While the poor man was recovering from his seizure the old
6170,XII,gentleman absent-mindedly departed without paying his shot.
