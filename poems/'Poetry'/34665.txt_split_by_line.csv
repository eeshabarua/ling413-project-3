29,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
30,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Twenty years ago, Hezekiah Thornypath was in Luck's way--so much so,"
31,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,that Luck kicked him out of it.  Hez went up to London to make his
32,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"fortune, and he took his wife and children with him to help to make it:"
33,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Hez meant ""to make his crown a pound,"" as the old song says, but he did"
34,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"not.  Either times, trade, or Hez's management was bad; things went"
35,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"contrary; and, as though it were a punishment for marrying against old"
36,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Thornypath's wish, Hezekiah's few hundred pounds melted away, troubles"
37,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"came upon him, friends forsook him, and when he considered that his"
38,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"affairs could be no worse, he had to fetch the doctor, who came, shook"
39,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"his head, and in a few hours Hez and his wife were weeping bitterer"
40,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"tears than they had ever shed before, for the rigour of death was fast"
41,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,stealing away the beauty from the features of their youngest child.
42,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
43,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,The house looked sad and sombre with the blinds drawn down; footsteps
44,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"were hushed, and voices were heard but in a whisper--how needlessly Hez"
45,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"too well knew, as he gazed, with his weeping wife, upon the little"
46,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"sleeper.  The world looked in advance one dreary desert, while hope"
47,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,seemed to have parted from them for ever.  No friendly word of comfort
48,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"was spoken, no whispered consolation--they were alone in the great city,"
49,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,and the tears that fell had no earthly witness.
50,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
51,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"A few days dragged slowly past, and then the lid of the little painted"
52,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,deal coffin hid from aching eyes the tiny spirit's cast-off robe.
53,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Blinding tears, breasts heaving while the thrilling words of the Apostle"
54,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"fell upon the grieving parents' ears, a last long look at the deep cold"
55,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"grave, and a catching of the breath as the earth fell heavily upon their"
56,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"infant's breast, and then, slowly, sadly, hand-in-hand, away from the"
57,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,little grave.
58,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
59,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Three months passed away, and the shabby mourning had grown more rusty--"
60,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,three months of sorrow and struggles for the bare necessaries of life--
61,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"and then again the slow, creaking step of the doctor; the same anxious"
62,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,faces watching the hard-drawn breath and fevered countenance of another
63,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"little sufferer--watching with aching hearts, and moaning in the"
64,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"bitterness of their spirit at their helplessness, their utter impotence"
65,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"to give relief.  Gazing with awe at the wild eye, unearthly look, and"
66,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"startled mien; ever and anon trying to soothe the child, whose spirit"
67,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"seemed to hold communion with another world.  The same sad, sad scene:"
68,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"the creaking step departing, with the assurance, ""nothing can be done;"""
69,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"and then, by the gloomy light of the wretched candle, the shades of that"
70,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"deepest night were seen to gather upon the little brow, as the eyes were"
71,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,closed in the sleep whose waking is into life eternal.
72,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
73,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Through the crowded streets again, to the crowded habitation of the"
74,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"dead, a shabby funeral, with shabby mourners, hardly noticed but by the"
75,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"children, who cease their play and cling to the churchyard rails, or"
76,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,follow the sad procession amongst the mouldering graves.  Another little
77,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"coffin close beside the first in the cold, black earth, while hearts"
78,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"filled to bursting mourn for the lost ones, drinking deeply of"
79,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"affliction--of those bitter waters of Marah; and then on again, toiling"
80,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,through life's weary way.
81,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
82,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,Months of struggling--months of privation and misery; and after a day
83,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"spent in a vain effort to gain employ, Hez slunk through the"
84,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"gaily-lighted streets of the West End, shrinking within himself as"
85,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"though it were dishonest of him to be poor, and to show his haggard face"
86,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"amid so much wealth.  Christmas was at hand, and the gaily-decorated"
87,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"shops were thronged with merry faces; the streets, too, were crowded,"
88,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"vehicles were loaded, and railway-vans groaned beneath the weight of the"
89,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"presents they were bearing away.  Boys home for the holidays, visitors"
90,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"from the country, busy purchasers and sight-seers, hurried through the"
91,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,teeming arteries of the mighty city; and the light of many a roaring
92,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"fire danced upon the window-blinds, or sent its curtain-shaded radiance"
93,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"glowing across the road, telling of home and comfort, and the welcome"
94,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"awaiting those away.  Soft flakes of snow were falling fast, and"
95,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"deadened the footfalls of those he met.  A little farther on, strains of"
96,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"music greeted his ear, and a voice arrested him for an instant as he"
97,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"heard the words of a song well-known in happier days.  Again onwards, to"
98,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"pass a merry party of young men, laughing and happy.  Everything"
99,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"betokening comfort, wealth, and the festivity of Christmas, met his eye;"
100,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"but no misery save his own, for the bitter night had sent all others"
101,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"hiding down in courts and alleys, seeking in their darkness' for shelter"
102,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,from the winter's icy breath.  Hez groaned; for he thought of past
103,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Christmas-days, and now of the present, with his one beggarly room in a"
104,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"court; of his patient, long-suffering wife, and half-starving children;"
105,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"of the dire pressure upon him, and his impotence to ward off the"
106,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"troubles.  Want had him tightly in her clutches, and, with the thought"
107,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"of his misery, he looked down upon his wretched garb in despair.  He had"
108,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,sold everything that the traffickers with poverty would buy; little by
109,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"little, furniture, plate, watches, books, clothes, the little trifles"
110,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"interchanged in brighter days, all, all had gone; and now Hez hurried"
111,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"back to his lodging, knowing that he could not stir again in search of"
112,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,employment but as a shoeless beggar.
113,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
114,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,Hez and his wife supped that night upon the luxury he took in with him--
115,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,a hot potato; the two children lay asleep in their corner when he
116,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"returned; and bare and wretched as the back room was, lighted only by a"
117,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"rushlight, there was still one bright ray to illumine its darkness--love"
118,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"was there; and the same fond smile welcomed Hez back, as greeted him in"
119,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,brighter days; the same arms--albeit thin and attenuated--clung round
120,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"his neck, and the same gentle face was laid to his, as when, in the full"
121,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"career of prosperity, he had returned to a comfortable home."
122,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
123,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Christmas-Eve, and things at the worst: the tide of prosperity floated"
124,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"away, and Hez's bark stranded.  A bitter night; no furniture to sell; no"
125,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"coals; no fire; and three weeks' rent in arrear.  A few hours before,"
126,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"and a message came, that the landlady wanted to see Mr Thornypath; when"
127,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,the poor fellow encountered the storm of abuse in waiting for him; to
128,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"listen to the threats of bailiffs, and finally, as no money was produced"
129,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"by the wordy warfare, to receive notice to quit.  It was ten o'clock,"
130,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,and Hez sat by the empty grate upon a broken stool; the children with
131,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,their mother were asleep upon a mattress stretched in the corner of the
132,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"room.  Poor things, they had cried with the cold, and their mother,"
133,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"trying to lend warmth to their little chilled forms, in her weariness"
134,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"and misery slept by their side.  Hez had knelt down, and kissed away a"
135,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"half-dried tear from the pallid cheek, as he had added his ragged coat"
136,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"to his wife's scanty covering.  It was a bitter, biting night, and Hez"
137,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,felt half stupefied with the cold; the pane of glass which the children
138,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"had broken was badly stopped, and through it the chilly blast rushed in."
139,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,Earlier in the night there had been an organ in the court; but the man
140,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"gave in after playing half a tune, and shivered off, thinking of his own"
141,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"sunny land; some musicians, too, and a carol singer, had been to the"
142,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"public-house hard by; but their strains raised no response; and now,"
143,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Christmas-Eve though it was, the occasional tramp of a policeman, and"
144,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"the hum of the distant street, were all the sounds that greeted the ear."
145,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
146,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Hez sat upon his stool and mused, unmindful of the cold that crept"
147,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"beneath his ragged shirt, and pinched him until it left blue marks upon"
148,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,his flesh; unmindful of all but the half-muttered words and sighs of his
149,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"sleeping wife, when he would lightly cross the room to re-adjust the"
150,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"wretched coverlet, and listen to her breathings, as though afraid that"
151,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,she might leave him in her sleep.  Hez sat and mused: the bygone came
152,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"back, and the thinker saw himself as child, boy, and man."
153,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
154,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,Then he recalled stormy interviews with his father; insubordination and
155,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"defiance; the smarting of a blow upon his flushing cheek; and then,"
156,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"married life, and still happiness for a time; years of sunshine, and his"
157,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"barque floating gently along the stream, which now bore him for a time"
158,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"upon his way.  Then the recollection of others' pains; the affliction,"
159,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"ruin, and distress he had witnessed, where adversity had been bravely"
160,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"battled with for long, long years."
161,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
162,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,------------------------------------------------------------------------
163,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
164,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,A black cloud shrouding the man's soul: why should he suffer thus? what
165,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,had he done? where was his sin? should wife and little ones bear the
166,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,offence of the father?--suffer for his disobedience?  Thousands around
167,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"were in opulence; and he, willing to fight for his daily bread, eager to"
168,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"seize the work that should give him the labourer's independence, pushed"
169,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,to the wall by the hundreds striving to grasp the coveted food-procurer.
170,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,Why should he not take what stern fate denied? must he sit and watch
171,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"his little ones' agony, or apply as a pauper for parish relief?  What"
172,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,was honesty to him now? he must have gold--gold--not to satisfy greed or
173,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"the avarice of possession, but because it was the life of all most dear"
174,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"to him.  Glittering stores of life-blood--wife's, children's"
175,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"life-blood--breath--lay in the windows close, at hand; could he not"
176,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"clutch the spoil, and let them live and be happy once more?  ""Thou shalt"
177,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"not steal!""  What whispered of theft?  It was no theft, but duty; the"
178,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"right of a strong man to grasp the possessions of the weaker, as kings"
179,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"made conquests.  Gold, jewellery, wealth for the taking, and then in"
180,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,some country home to forget once more this hideous act in life's drama.
181,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"""Thou shalt not steal!""  Hush, conscience, hush!  Man must live!  But"
182,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,not by bread alone.  Not one sparrow should fall to the ground without
183,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,He willed it so!  But life--life for the sleeping ones; life for his
184,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"long, long-suffering wife--for his prattling children!  Must he keep"
185,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"laws and see the famine-pinched cheeks, the blue lips, and listen to"
186,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,wailing cries for bread?  Had he not waited and hoped--hoped still
187,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,against the crushing desolation that pressed upon his weary brain?  But
188,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,why not die?  Why should they not all sleep--sleep together?  A little
189,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"charcoal and the door well closed; the chimney stopped; and then, with"
190,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"them gently sleeping, without a struggle, wafted away from this weary"
191,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"life to eternal rest.  His would be the sin; and they, poor, gentle,"
192,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"loving hearts, would be tenderly led by the hand of Mercy to their"
193,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Father's home.  Life! what was life but one great sorrow?  They, poor"
194,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"sleepers, would not suffer.  But what was that?  A merry gentle laugh"
195,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"and a few half-muttered words from little golden hair, nestling close to"
196,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,her mother's breast; prattling words of playful glee; some happy dream
197,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,playing round that little flame of life.  And should he crush it out?
198,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,slay as a murderer that tiny innocent? to hear no more the music of its
199,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"mirth, the ringing silver of its laugh, and the broken, half-framed"
200,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,words and sentences of its lips--words so sweet and playful that the
201,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,child itself would peer through the golden tangle that overhung its
202,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"bright blue eyes, and laugh--merrily laugh--to hear its own attempts."
203,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"Those blue eyes, pure in their light as the heaven reflected in their"
204,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,liquid depth.  Must this be so?  God--God forgive the thought!  They
205,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"should live--live to bless him yet, for his secret should be his own."
206,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
207,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,The grate bar--the broken poker!  Enough: they would suffice.  He would
208,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"go--go at once; but stay, he must wait awhile; his wife had moaned in"
209,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,"her sleep, the wind had rattled the window, and he felt numbed with the"
210,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,cold.  He had thought too much; but he was now relieved and determined.
211,ONE--FREEZING SHARP.,
212,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.
213,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,
214,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,Fleet Street.  The wind whistling down the river lanes and moaning
215,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"through the courts.  The night far advanced, and a thin section of the"
216,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"moon rising behind the distant cathedral.  Stars bright, and sparkling"
217,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,like diamonds through the keen frosty air.  The gas within the lamps
218,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"quivering in the chilling draught, and the policeman passing a figure"
219,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,cowering in a dark alley near Temple-bar.  The warder of the night
220,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"passes, and a single vehicle rattles by directly after, the horse's"
221,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,breath rising like a vapour; and then wheels and footsteps gradually
222,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"fade upon the ear as they pass, echoing down the long street.  The"
223,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"bareheaded, coatless figure emerges from its concealment, and looks"
224,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"around.  All still as death, and no eye upon its actions but the stars"
225,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"of heaven, as it were, spirits looking down to chronicle what passed."
226,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"The rattling of a shutter bar--the grating noise as of iron upon iron,"
227,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,mingled with the crackling of woodwork; the figure wrenching and tearing
228,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"with maniacal fury at the firm fastenings, while huge drops of sweat"
229,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"roll down his face.  More resistance; more noise; but the figure,"
230,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"straining with the might of a giant, again and again, till the iron"
231,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"snaps in the frosty air; and then, wrenched out by its protecting bar,"
232,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,an iron-sheeted shutter lies upon the pavement.  To dash in the thick
233,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"glass, and, with bleeding hands, to seize watches, chains, trays of"
234,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"rings, and sparkling jewels, and force them into a bag, is but the work"
235,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"of a few moments, and, grasping with both hands all that he can clutch,"
236,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"the figure turns to flee, just as the sharp report of a pistol rings"
237,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"from the interior of the shop.  The glass shivers, but the figure is"
238,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"untouched, and grasping the stolen treasure, darts along the pavement,"
239,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,hardly avoiding the blow aimed at him by a policeman.  Away down the
240,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"well-lit street, followed by sounds that lend speed to the enfeebled"
241,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"frame, for, joined to the shouts of the alarmed inmates of the house,"
242,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,the policeman's rattle sends its harsh whirring alarm-notes through the
243,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"still night air.  Onward, clutching the booty to his breast, and panting"
244,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"as the pursuing steps sound fainter; a race for more than life, and the"
245,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"street nearly passed, when another enemy darts from a side court, and"
246,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"grasps the fugitive's arm.  There is a sharp struggle for a few moments,"
247,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"and the policeman falls, stricken to the ground by an iron bar, and the"
248,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,figure dashes on again.  But the alarm has spread as he turns down
249,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"Bridge Street, where the sharp air seems to numb the limbs of the"
250,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"runner.  Battle after rattle and shrill whistles are heard, and the"
251,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"figure stands for a moment undecided, wiping the half-frozen drops from"
252,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"his brow.  Again onward, with enemies springing up on all sides, and"
253,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,shouts ringing in his ears; panting up the steep slope of the old
254,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"bridge, but at the top two more enemies.  Beaten, wearied, fainting; no"
255,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,hope; escape closed; prison; felon's dock; transportation; a starving
256,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"wife and children; and a dishonoured name--all crowding thoughts,"
257,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"rushing to the brain to add anguish to the moment, as, still clutching"
258,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"his ill-gotten booty, the despairing wretch, with a last look around,"
259,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"climbs the heavy stone balustrade, gives one wild shriek, and parts the"
260,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,air in a plunge down into the dark abyss of rushing waters.  The waters
261,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"part to receive him in their cold embrace, and then the struggle for"
262,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"life--for breath--above water--borne away by the swirling eddies, and"
263,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"dashed against the sharp buttress; gliding along by the slimy stone, and"
264,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"hurried through the arch, to be caught by the back eddy, and swept into"
265,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"still water, and borne down by the heavy booty.  One glance at the"
266,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"bright stars, with the stream bubbling at his mouth; arms failing with"
267,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,beating the waves; and then the tide roaring in the drowning wretch's
268,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"ears, spreading his long hair for a moment upon the surface, and then"
269,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"closing above his head--the concentric rings swept away, and all cold,"
270,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"dark, and familiar once more--the gas in the court shining up through"
271,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"the window upon the ceiling, and wife and children asleep upon the"
272,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,floor.
273,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,
274,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"Cold and stiff, Hez staggered to his feet; a heavy dew was upon his"
275,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"brow; a deep groan burst from his breast; and, sinking upon his knees,"
276,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"he covered his haggard face with his hands, and, by the side of his"
277,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"sleeping ones, a prayer of thankfulness welled forth from the depths of"
278,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,his heart that it was but a dream.  Overwrought nature could bear no
279,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"more, and at last, sinking beside his sleeping wife, that happy"
280,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,"oblivion, given alike to rich and poor, closed his eyes once more in"
281,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,rest.
282,TWO--DOWN TO ZERO.,
283,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.
284,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,
285,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,The bells rang forth merrily upon that Christmas-morn; the sun shone out
286,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"in unclouded splendour, and danced in vivid flashes from the snowy"
287,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"covering of the house-tops.  Water frozen in the bedrooms, and, far off"
288,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"in the country, the rivers ringing with the pick-axe blows to break the"
289,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,massive ice.  Birds upon the house-tops setting all their feathers up
290,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"perpendicularly, and looking as if they had put in an appearance against"
291,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,the cold by donning an extra suit.  There was a crisp feeling in the air
292,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"that sent the blood tingling through the veins, and gave a rosy hilarity"
293,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,even to the porters of the gate-ways about Lincoln's Inn; for they
294,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"seemed to drop their pounce and parchment air for the time, and beat"
295,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"their breasts, and stamped about the fresh-swept pavement with such an"
296,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"air of jollity, that people turned round to look at them; and one"
297,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"wayfarer gave it as his opinion that the Court of Chancery was dead, and"
298,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,the porters had received the news of a pension from a grateful country.
299,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"The policemen, too, for once looked good-tempered; and one was actually"
300,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,seen to smile upon a ragged urchin going surreptitiously down a slide.
301,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,
302,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"It was Christmas-morning, but there was plenty of business going on: the"
303,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,poulterer's boy from round the corner showed ears that looked like raw
304,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"beef; but he had a broad grin upon his countenance as he puffed along,"

428,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"a large blue cotton handkerchief, and in a moment her eyes were wiped;"
429,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,and as the astonished family gazed upon her she scuffled back to the

432,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,only to return and fetch the great gingham umbrella which stood leaning

436,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Few minutes elapsed before the silence was again broken, when heavy"

439,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,of wood were deposited in the cupboard; while before Hez's wife had
440,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"recovered from her surprise, in puffed Mrs Cripps, with a loaf under"

446,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"smiles, and the efforts required to gulp down an occasional sob, that"
447,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,lady's countenance was a physiognomical study.  The umbrella was soon
448,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"crowned with the big black bonnet, and stood up in a corner, the shawl"
449,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"hung up on a nail, the gown skirts pinned up all round, and the old lady"
450,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,bustling about the place as though she belonged to it.  Twice only had
451,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,she to run up in a corner to bury her face in the big blue handkerchief;
452,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"but making a cheerful fire, and picking out the most nubbly coals,"
453,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"getting the kettle on in the most eligible position for heat, and"
454,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"fanning the blazing wood with the dust-pan, took up so much time that"
455,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,the old lady soon forgot to sob.  The odds and ends of cups and saucers
456,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"were then arranged upon the table; and the children, with eager eyes,"
457,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"watched the disgorging of the big basket, until they clapped their"
458,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,little hands with delight in anticipation of the coming banquet.
459,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Rashers of bacon, fresh butter, eggs, coffee, sugar, all were there; and"
460,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,then the kettle gave two or three premonitory snorts by way of clearing
461,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"its throat, and to announce that it was going to sing; whereupon the"
462,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"elder girl was enlisted into Mrs Cripps's working committee, and set to"

466,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,little one informed the dame after she had seen it herself and
467,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"temporarily repaired the evil; and then eggs were placed in it, upon the"

469,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"and Mrs Cripps's smiling face, the bare and not wretched room began to"

471,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,
472,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,Everything was progressing to a satisfactory state of readiness; and now
473,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,the demands upon the old lady's time were multifarious: the kettle was
474,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,sputtering and boiling over into the fire; the bacon was nearly done;
475,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,the coffee required tossing in and out of a tea-cup; the eggs wanted
476,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,watching while they seethed their prescribed three minutes and a half;
477,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,and then there was the bread and butter to cut and the butter wouldn't
478,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"spread, but kept coming off in great crumb-lined flakes.  But"
479,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"perseverance overcomes all difficulties, and as Mrs Cripps had plenty"
480,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"of that virtue in her composition, she surmounted all her trials, and"

484,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Hez and his wife had hardly moved since their visitor entered the room,"

487,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"wounded pride, sat with head half averted, until his old nurse"
488,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"approached with so apologetic an air, such a union of respect and pity,"
489,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"withal such tenderly, motherly words, that Hez completely broke down,"
490,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"and burying his face in his hands, he wept like a child."
491,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,
492,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Poor Mrs Cripps, she was thirty years old when Hez was born, and she"

509,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"carried the day by saying it would ""do the dear children good.""  Mrs"
510,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Thornypath then crossed over to her husband, who was leaning against the"
511,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"mantel-piece, and whispered with him for a minute; when he, poor fellow,"
512,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"glancing at his clothes, sorrowfully shook his head.  But it was of no"

516,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"There was now a busy interval of preparation, when a heavy footstep was"

543,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,Mrs Prodgers was one of that class of householders who so abound in our

563,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"to anything but their wants, and so by degrees Hez's shame and wounded"
564,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"pride, that so far had covered him with an icy reserve, melted before"
565,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"the genial dame.  The bright morning, and the merry faces of his"
566,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"children, listening to the details of the pudding that awaited them,"
567,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"these, too, tended to bring to his remembrance the dream of the previous"
568,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"night, and to show him that one loving, honest heart on earth was more"
569,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"than a match for despair.  The streets were full of happy faces, and to"
570,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Hez's eye everything appeared already to wear a brighter aspect.  ""Try"
571,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"again"" seemed to ring in his ears, and during a temporary stoppage the"
572,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"greeting of one rosy-faced old man to another, ""Merry Christmas and"
573,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"Happy New Year to you, my boy,"" seemed to thrill through him.  Why"
574,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,should it not be a happy new year to him too?  And with the thought the
575,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"saddening, vacant, helpless look vanished from his countenance, driven"
576,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,away by the spirit of energy and determination; his carriage became more
577,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"erect, and this unwonted aspect was communicated to her who had divided"

580,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,Mrs Cripps still kept too busy on the front seat with the children to

582,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"trickled slowly down her nose, until it descended ""plash"" upon the hand"
583,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"of the child she held in her lap, making the little thing ask in her"
584,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"wonderment ""what made it yain there?""  There was too much to point out"
585,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"to the children for any notice to be taken of what took place, and when"
586,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"at last Hez and his wife each held out a hand to the dame, the former"
587,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"felt that there was no cause to fear humiliation, for the hearty, honest"
588,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"pressure, accompanied as it was by the motherly, loving smile, showed"
589,THREE--RAYS FROM THE CRYSTALS.,"the full extent of the existing sympathy, and how little need there was"

596,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"luscious as roast goose.  The cooking too: one turn more would, nay"
597,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"must, have spoiled it; and as to the consequences of one turn less, they"
598,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"were not to be thought of.  It was just, to do Mary justice, ""done to a"
599,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"turn,"" and Mrs Cripps was put out of her misery; for, as she had told"
600,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"Mrs Hez in confidence, she had had her doubts; but they were all"
601,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"cleared up, and the old lady's face shone and looked for all the world"
602,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"like the pippins that had composed the sauce.  Such mashed potatoes,"
603,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,beautifully worked all over the surface into elegant designs with a
604,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"fork, and showing brown where they had been to the fire; while just"
605,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"under Hez's nose, and sending forth a maddening jet of steam, was a"
606,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"tureen full of supplementary gravy, and sage and onions, in case the"
607,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,great levy that lay within the internal regions of the goose should
608,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,fail.  There was a big brown jug of the brownest stout; bread of the
609,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,whitest; greens of the greenest; and the table had all the best cut
610,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"glass on, so as to give the effect to Mrs Cripps's six silver"
611,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"table-spoons.  There was a real oak Christmas log upon the fire,"
612,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,crackling away and sending whole regiments of soldiers flying up the
613,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"chimney, when poked for the gratification of little Goldenhair.  Hez's"
614,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"eldest child, too, had had a peep in the sideboard cupboard, where there"
615,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"were oranges, apples, figs, nuts, decanters, and all sorts of unheard-of"
616,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,treasures.  But at last the whole party were settled at the table; Mr
617,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"and Mrs Hez top and bottom, and Mrs Cripps and the children taking the"

619,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,
620,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"There never was such a goose before.  ""Ciss-s-s-s"" at the first plunge"
621,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,of the carving-knife a fountain of rich brown gravy spurted right across
622,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"the snow-white table-cloth, and right into the salt-cellar; and then"
623,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"there was such scraping and rubbing up of the mess, only ending in"
624,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,making bad doubly worse; but at last the carver's duty was well
625,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"performed, the choice morsels distributed, and Mrs Cripps idle, from"
626,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,the fact that she really could not force more mashed potatoes or gravy
627,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,upon anyone.
628,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,
629,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"At last, when summoned, Mrs Cripps's Mary came in to change the plates,"
630,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,and brought with her such a fragrant scent as could only have belonged
631,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"to a Christmas pudding; and, sure enough, it directly afterwards made"
632,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"its appearance, with sides bursting open to disclose the richness"
633,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,within.  It had been on the boil for six hours; and what with the piece
634,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"of holly stuck in the top, and the wine-glassful of brandy set blazing"
635,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"in the dish, there never could have been such a luxurious pudding"
636,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"before.  As to the children, they again clapped their hands with"
637,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"delight, but otherwise gave silent testimony of their admiration by"
638,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"being helped three times, and eating as only children can eat pudding."
639,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,
640,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"But the best of dinners must have a termination, and so did this one;"
641,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"and when the hearth had been swept up, and the treasures of the cupboard"

643,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"hues within the old-fashioned decanters, full of old-fashioned home-made"
644,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"wine, the chairs being all drawn up round the fire, Mrs Cripps began to"
645,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,tell her visitors of her savings; and how that she had two hundred
646,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,pounds in the bank; and it not being likely that she would want it for
647,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"many years to come, it was her wish that Hez--""dear Master Hez""--should"
648,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"take it to begin the world with afresh, and pay his old nurse again when"
649,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,he could spare it.  And when Hez and his wife would not hear of such a
650,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"thing, the old woman grew quite angry, and took the upper hand, saying,"
651,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"""that they were children and ought not to dictate to an old body of her"
652,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"years, and that she would do what she liked with her own money,"" and"
653,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"last of all pretended to get in such a passion, that the visitors were"
654,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,obliged to be silent.
655,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,
656,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"At last, when the early winter's eve was closing in, when the ferny"

658,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"were lighted, Mrs Cripps, who had been for a long time very silent,"
659,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"suddenly asked Hez if he remembered the story he used to read her, years"
660,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"ago, out of his little book, about the mouse helping the lion out of the"
661,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"net.  Hez replied in the affirmative, and saw again within the glowing"
662,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"fire the image of his tiny, bygone self, perched upon a tall chair,"
663,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"reading to his comely nurse.  While his nurse, old, but comely still,"
664,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"fondly putting her hand upon his shoulder, reminded him, too, of the"
665,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,dreary Christmas-eve when she had come to his father's house--to her old
666,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"master--wet, cold, and weary with her long walk from the distant"
667,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,village; how that weeping and sobbing she had come to beg the stern old
668,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"man to lend her money to save her husband from ruin, and their little"
669,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,home from being broken up; how that Hez's father had refused--harshly
670,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,refused--saying that he had too many ways for his money to waste it in
671,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"helping idle people; and how, when turning heartsick to the door, a"
672,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"little hand had seized hold of old nurse's gown, telling nurse not to"
673,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"cry, for Hez would give her all his money; and forthwith thrust his"
674,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"little box, containing two new pennies and a lucky sixpence, into her"
675,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"hands, setting her weeping more bitterly than ever; bringing her upon"
676,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,her knees by his side to sob over and kiss the noble-hearted little
677,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"fellow, till a stern voice had called him away; but only to come rushing"
678,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,after her again with the money she sought clasped in his little hands.
679,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"""And,"" concluded the dame, once more sinking upon her knees by the side"
680,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"of Hez, ""I thank God that I can show my dear boy how many years I have"
681,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"remembered his kind--kind act!"""
682,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,
683,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"It was growing very dark in the little parlour, and Mary was getting"
684,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,very impatient to bring in the tea-things; but her patience was tried
685,FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.,"for some time longer, and when at last, unsummoned, she took them in,"

693,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"left all the frost and thaw far behind, and got well on in his journey"
694,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,of life.  He used to say that a blessing went with old nurse Cripps's

700,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"I spent a few days with him at Christmas-time, some three or four years"

702,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"white-haired dame, pretending to be very busy knitting, propped up in"
703,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"her easy-chair, with one or another of Hez's numerous youngsters on the"

709,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"Christmas-night had come, and a merry day had been spent.  The old lady"

712,FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.,"for dinner; and that, for all his money, he had never seen such a"

746,CORNS.,
747,CORNS.,"I looked at the bristly-headed physician, who handed me a sheet of note"
748,CORNS.,"paper with a big capital B, two long blurs, a rough blotch, a few"
749,CORNS.,"spidery ink splays, and an ugly MD at the end of a few inky"

753,CORNS.,struck cold up my legs.  Here I was confronted by the footman who
754,CORNS.,"ushered me into his master's presence--a blue-coated, crestless-buttoned"
755,CORNS.,"wretch with two round grey eyes that said ""shillings"" as plainly as any"
756,CORNS.,"mute thing could; but I was angry, and determined to come no more: so"
757,CORNS.,"giving the fellow only a sixpence, I hobbled away and stood in Saville"
758,CORNS.,Row.
759,CORNS.,
760,CORNS.,"Diet, indeed; why no man could be more moderate.  And what's half a"
761,CORNS.,"bottle of port for one's dinner?  Why, my grandfather, sir, took his two"
762,CORNS.,"bottles regularly, and, beyond an occasional fit of the gout, was as"
763,CORNS.,"hale a man as ever lived.  Why, he'd have lived till fourscore safe if"
764,CORNS.,bad management and country doctors had not drawn the regal complaint
765,CORNS.,"into his stomach, where it would stop.  This was coming to a physician"
766,CORNS.,for advice.  And then what did he do when I told him of the agonies I
767,CORNS.,"suffered?--smiled pleasantly, and said it was my liver; while when I"
768,CORNS.,"hinted at my corns, what did he do then but metaphorically tread upon"
769,CORNS.,"them, for he laughed."
770,CORNS.,
771,CORNS.,"Now, putting dyspepsia on one side, I appeal to my fellow-sufferers, and"
772,CORNS.,"ask them, Is there any torture to be compared with the infliction of"
773,CORNS.,corns?  Headache?--take a little medicine and lie down.  Toothache?--
774,CORNS.,have it out.  Earache?--try hot onion.  Opodeldoc for rheumatism;
775,CORNS.,chlorodyne for tic; colchicum for gout.  There's a remedy for nearly
776,CORNS.,every pain and ache; but what will you do for your corns?  Ordinary
777,CORNS.,"sufferings come only now and then, but corns shoot, stab, twitch, and"
778,CORNS.,agonise continually.  What is the remedy?  Plasters are puffs; bandages
779,CORNS.,empty promises; the knife threatens tetanus; caustic only makes them
780,CORNS.,black and smarting; while chiropodists--.  Mention them not in my
781,CORNS.,"hearing, lest my vengeance fall upon your devoted head.  Where can you"
782,CORNS.,"put your feet to be safe--at home or abroad?  Why, your very boots are"
783,CORNS.,"sworn enemies, and the battle at putting on or pulling off makes the"
784,CORNS.,thought of the operation produce beads of cold perspiration upon one's
785,CORNS.,ample brow.  Who can be surprised at one's lying long in bed of a
786,CORNS.,"morning when tortures await, and you know that just outside the door, by"
787,CORNS.,"the side of the large white jug whose water grows less and less steamy,"
788,CORNS.,there stand two hollow leather cylinders loaded with fearful pains to be
789,CORNS.,discharged at your devoted feet.
790,CORNS.,
791,CORNS.,There isn't a sensible shoemaker on the face of the earth.  I've tried

794,CORNS.,"are worse than ever.  I won't believe in them any more, though they do"
795,CORNS.,"show me lasts made to my feet, and insult me with hideous nubbly, bunkly"
796,CORNS.,"abortions carved in wood, which they say represent my feet--my feet,"
797,CORNS.,"those suffering locomotives.  I'll take to sandals, or else follow the"
798,CORNS.,"advice of the Countess de Noailles, and go barefoot like the old hen in"

800,CORNS.,
801,CORNS.,I could suffer the bodily pain if it were not for the mental
802,CORNS.,"accompaniment, and the total want of pity and compassion shown by"
803,CORNS.,"people.  Only the other day, going down one of those quiet cab-stand"
804,CORNS.,"streets, one of the idle wretches that I intended to engage shouted out"
805,CORNS.,"to his companions,--"
806,CORNS.,
807,CORNS.,"""I say, old 'uns, here's Peter Pindar a-coming."""
808,CORNS.,
809,CORNS.,"""Who?"" shouted another."
810,CORNS.,
811,CORNS.,"""Cove as turned pilgrim, and went with peas in his shoes,"" cried Number"

814,CORNS.,
815,CORNS.,"""You scoundrel,"" I cried, ""it's my corn,--it's not peas."""
816,CORNS.,
817,CORNS.,"""Then get it ground, sir,"" groaned the fellow; when I was so vexed that"
818,CORNS.,"I took the omnibus instead, or rather the omnibus took me, and as soon"
819,CORNS.,"as I had entered, I was shot into the lap of a stout elderly lady who"
820,CORNS.,"looked daggers at me, and revenged herself by putting her fat umbrella"
821,CORNS.,ferrule on my corn at every opportunity.  I believe it was Mrs Saunders
822,CORNS.,"herself, the friend of Mrs Bardell, of Goswell Street.  And oh! what I"
823,CORNS.,suffered in that vehicle!  Would that I could have performed the
824,CORNS.,operation recommended by the conductor--a man with a gash across his
825,CORNS.,"face when he laughed--to put my toes in my pocket, or go and dispose of"
826,CORNS.,my troubles at Mark Lane.
827,CORNS.,
828,CORNS.,"It was of no use to try: every one who came in or went out of that 'bus,"
829,CORNS.,"either trod upon or poked my worst corn with stick or umbrella, and then"
830,CORNS.,"in the height of my anguish, when my countenance was distorted with"
831,CORNS.,"pain, a stout, wheezing old lady opposite must ""Drat my imperance,"" and"
832,CORNS.,want to know whether I meant to insult her.
833,CORNS.,
834,CORNS.,"I hobbled out of the place of torture as quickly as I could, and stepped"
835,CORNS.,into one of those mud trimmings the scavengers delight in leaving by our
836,CORNS.,"pavements, covering the glossy leather with the foul refuse, so that,"
837,CORNS.,"naturally particular about my boots, I was reduced to the extremity of"
838,CORNS.,"having a polish laid on by one of those young scarlet rascals, who kneel"
839,CORNS.,at the corners of the streets.
840,CORNS.,
841,CORNS.,"""Black yer boots, sir,"" cried first one and then another, but I could"
842,CORNS.,"not trust to the first I met with, for he looked too eager, the next too"
843,CORNS.,"slow, while the third seemed a doubtful character, so I waited till I"
844,CORNS.,reached a fourth.
845,CORNS.,
846,CORNS.,"""Do you see that slight eminence, you dog?"""
847,CORNS.,
848,CORNS.,"""Wot that knobble, sir,"" said the boy."
849,CORNS.,
850,CORNS.,"""That eminence, boy,"" I said, fiercely.  ""That covers a corn."""
851,CORNS.,
852,CORNS.,"""All right, sir,"" said the boy, ""I won't hurt it.  I'll go a tip-toe"
853,CORNS.,"over him, you see if I don't.  I often cleans boots for gents as has"
854,CORNS.,"corns, and I'm used to 'em, and--"""
855,CORNS.,
856,CORNS.,"""Yah-h-h-h,"" I shrieked, for it was impossible to help it, and at the"
857,CORNS.,same moment brought down my umbrella fiercely on the little scoundrel's
858,CORNS.,"head.  Fancy my feelings all you who suffer, for it must have been done"
859,CORNS.,purposely; just as the young ruffian was grinding away with an
860,CORNS.,"abomination of a hard brush--a very hard brush, so hard that there was"
861,CORNS.,more wood than bristles--he looked up at me and grinned while I was
862,CORNS.,"perspiring with fear and pain, and then with one furious stroke he"
863,CORNS.,"caught the edge of his brush right upon the apex of Mount Agony, causing"
864,CORNS.,"me to shriek, seize my half-cleaned boot with both hands, and dance"
865,CORNS.,"round upon one leg regardless of appearances, and to the extreme delight"
866,CORNS.,of the collecting crowd.
867,CORNS.,
868,CORNS.,"""Don't you do that agen, now come,"" whimpered the boy, guarding his head"
869,CORNS.,"with both arms, and smearing his black countenance where a few tears"
870,CORNS.,trickled down.
871,CORNS.,
872,CORNS.,"""You dog!""  I shouted; ""I'll--I'll--I'll--"""
873,CORNS.,
874,CORNS.,"""Oh, ah!  I dessay you will,"" whined the boy; ""I never said nothin' to"
875,CORNS.,"you.  Why don't you pull off your boots then, and not go a-knockin' me"
876,CORNS.,"about?"""
877,CORNS.,
878,CORNS.,"Of course I hurried away with my boots half-cleaned, and so I have to"
879,CORNS.,"hurry through life--a miserable man, suffering unheard-of torment, but"
880,CORNS.,"with no one to pity me.  Time back, people would ask what ailed me, but"
881,CORNS.,"now they ""pooh, pooh"" my troubles, since it is only my corns.  I would"
882,CORNS.,"not care if people would tread upon me anywhere else, but they won't,"
883,CORNS.,and I feel now reduced to my last hope.
884,CORNS.,
885,CORNS.,"Did not somebody once say, ""Great oaks from little acorns grow--great"
886,CORNS.,"aches from little toe-corns grow""?  How true--how telling!  But there, I"
887,CORNS.,"give up, with the determination to bear my pains as I can, for I feel"
888,CORNS.,assured that no one will sympathise with me who does not suffer from
889,CORNS.,corns.

897,A GHASTLY DEED.,"In Portsmouth harbour the good ship lay,"
898,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Her cruising ended for many a day,"
899,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And gathered on deck while receiving their pay,"
900,A GHASTLY DEED.,The sailors most thickly were mustered.
901,A GHASTLY DEED.,The Jews on the wharves were all eagerly bent
902,A GHASTLY DEED.,"On supplying poor Jack, while most likely by scent,"
903,A GHASTLY DEED.,There were sharks by the score
904,A GHASTLY DEED.,On all parts of the shore.
905,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Both he sharks and she sharks enough, ay and more,"
906,A GHASTLY DEED.,"To devour poor Jack,"
907,A GHASTLY DEED.,"When they made their attack,"
908,A GHASTLY DEED.,And there on the land they all clustered.
909,A GHASTLY DEED.,
910,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Only think; from a cruise of four years returned,"
911,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And paid in clean money!  No wonder it burned,"
912,A GHASTLY DEED.,And Jack's canvass pockets were ready to give.
913,A GHASTLY DEED.,"But, there: not so ready as Jack who would live"
914,A GHASTLY DEED.,"To the top of his income--the very main truck,"
915,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And when to the bottom of pocket, why luck,"
916,A GHASTLY DEED.,Would never turn back
917,A GHASTLY DEED.,"On poor happy-faced Jack,"
918,A GHASTLY DEED.,Who never said die
919,A GHASTLY DEED.,In his life.  And would try
920,A GHASTLY DEED.,"To face any storm if his officers spoke,"
921,A GHASTLY DEED.,Or the wildest of sights that the hurricane woke.
922,A GHASTLY DEED.,
923,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Now Dick Sprit was a sailor,"
924,A GHASTLY DEED.,Tight and bold in a gale or
925,A GHASTLY DEED.,"A storm.  He would cheer in a fight,"
926,A GHASTLY DEED.,"'Mid the bullets' flight,"
927,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And sooner than hear any praise or flattery,"
928,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Would have run his head in a ""Rooshun"" battery."
929,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Now Dick his pockets had ten times slapped,"
930,A GHASTLY DEED.,"His fingers snapped, and his trousers clapped;"
931,A GHASTLY DEED.,"He had thought of his home and the Christmas-time,"
932,A GHASTLY DEED.,The long shore days 'mid the frosty rime.
933,A GHASTLY DEED.,"He had gone on shore, run the gauntlet well,"
934,A GHASTLY DEED.,'Scaped the Jews' oiled words and the grog-shops' smell.
935,A GHASTLY DEED.,"The night was cold and the way was dark,"
936,A GHASTLY DEED.,"What mattered when Dick was free of his bark,"
937,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And with kit on his back, and stick in his fist,"
938,A GHASTLY DEED.,"His pay in his pocket, and cheek full of twist,"
939,A GHASTLY DEED.,He started off for his six miles' tramp
940,A GHASTLY DEED.,"To his native spot, spite of snow or damp."
941,A GHASTLY DEED.,
942,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Dick twisted his twist, and he flourished his stick,"
943,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And vowed he could fourteen footpads lick,"
944,A GHASTLY DEED.,"For in war or in peace, a scrimmage or spar"
945,A GHASTLY DEED.,Is heartily welcome to every tar.
946,A GHASTLY DEED.,"The night was cold and the way was dark,"
947,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And the town lights shone here and there like a spark,"
948,A GHASTLY DEED.,"As merrily on through the snow Dick tramped,"
949,A GHASTLY DEED.,Though he certainly wished that the way were lamped.
950,A GHASTLY DEED.,"But what was that when with four years' pay,"
951,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And a leave of absence for many a day,"
952,A GHASTLY DEED.,"With the old folks waiting their boy to meet,"
953,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Their sailor lad who, now fleet of feet,"
954,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Hurried along o'er the crunching snow,"
955,A GHASTLY DEED.,As the thoughts of home made his heart to glow.
956,A GHASTLY DEED.,
957,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Some three miles past, and the sailor now"
958,A GHASTLY DEED.,Paused by a hedge where the holly bough
959,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Grew thick and dense, and though dim the night"
960,A GHASTLY DEED.,"There were memories many within that sight,"
961,A GHASTLY DEED.,"For the days of old came hurrying by,"
962,A GHASTLY DEED.,And that Christmas past when he said good-bye;
963,A GHASTLY DEED.,"While then came the thoughts of years soon sped,"
964,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Of the distant climes and the blood he'd shed,"
965,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Of the battles with storms in the ocean wild,"
966,A GHASTLY DEED.,Of the torrid heat or the breezes mild.
967,A GHASTLY DEED.,But now once more he was nearing home
968,A GHASTLY DEED.,After his four years' tiring roam;
969,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And with bounding heart how the night he blest,"
970,A GHASTLY DEED.,And thought of the coming days of rest.
971,A GHASTLY DEED.,
972,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Some three miles past, when his blood was chilled"
973,A GHASTLY DEED.,By a shriek which through every muscle thrilled;
974,A GHASTLY DEED.,"He stood for a moment, and then could hear"
975,A GHASTLY DEED.,The sounds of a struggle and trampling near;
976,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Panting and sobs, as of mortal fight,"
977,A GHASTLY DEED.,While from over a hedge gleamed rays of light.
978,A GHASTLY DEED.,Dick's feelings were wrought to the highest pitch;
979,A GHASTLY DEED.,"His bundle he dropped, gave his slack a hitch,"
980,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Then tightening his grasp of his sapling oak,"
981,A GHASTLY DEED.,"With a bounding rush through the hedge he broke,"
982,A GHASTLY DEED.,When hard by a cottage a lanthorn's light
983,A GHASTLY DEED.,Cast its flickering rays on a ghastly sight:
984,A GHASTLY DEED.,With gory features and blade in hand
985,A GHASTLY DEED.,Two ruffians stooped and their victim scanned;
986,A GHASTLY DEED.,"As over the struggling form they leant,"
987,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Dick paused no more, but his sapling went,"
988,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Cut one--cut two on each villain's head,"
989,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Thud like the fall of a pestle of lead,"
990,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And then they fell with a deep drawn groan,"
991,A GHASTLY DEED.,"While Dick leaned forward on hearing a moan,"
992,A GHASTLY DEED.,"But suddenly turning, he ran like mad,"
993,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And breathlessly muttered, ""'Twas really too bad."
994,A GHASTLY DEED.,Be blest if he ever did see such a rig
995,A GHASTLY DEED.,"As to topper two lubbers for killing a pig!"""
996,A GHASTLY DEED.,
997,A GHASTLY DEED.,"And Dick was right, for 'twas really no joke,"
998,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Though our sailor lad here had no ""pig in a poke;"""
999,A GHASTLY DEED.,"But though courage should merit the best of our praise,"
1000,A GHASTLY DEED.,There's a certain fair maiden whose limpid eyes' rays
1001,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Should be shed on our mind when we think to engage,"
1002,A GHASTLY DEED.,And not in our hurry go blind in our rage;
1003,A GHASTLY DEED.,"Discretion should lead us, or else every whit,"
1004,A GHASTLY DEED.,We may turn out as blind as the sailor--Dick Sprit.

1011,COME BACK.,
1012,COME BACK.,"""Ha-ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha!"" laughed Shadrach--Shadrach Pratt, light porter"
1013,COME BACK.,"at Teman, Sundry, and Sope's, the wholesale and retail grocers in the"
1014,COME BACK.,"City.  ""Ha-ha-ha!"" laughed Shadrach, stopping, with one foot on the wet"
1015,COME BACK.,"pavement and the other in the snowy slush of the kennel, to slap his"
1016,COME BACK.,"thigh, and say: ""That's a good 'un, that is--`What do the Arabs of the"
1017,COME BACK.,"desert live on? the sand which is there.'  That _is_ a good one, rale"
1018,COME BACK.,"grit.  Ha-ha-ha!"" laughed the little man.  ""I'll ask 'em that after"
1019,COME BACK.,"dinner to-morrow."""
1020,COME BACK.,
1021,COME BACK.,"Who'd have thought, to see the little fellow go skipping along through"
1022,COME BACK.,"the wet, splashy snow, that there were holes in the sides of his boots,"
1023,COME BACK.,"and that one sole had given up the stitches that morning and gone off,"
1024,COME BACK.,"being not buried, but suffering the fiery ordeal of burning, curling"
1025,COME BACK.,about upon its funereal pyre as though still alive?  Who'd have thought
1026,COME BACK.,"that he had had no dinner this Christmas-eve, and was now off,"
1027,COME BACK.,"post-haste, to his home in Bermondsey (_pronounced_ Bummonsey), to get"
1028,COME BACK.,dinner and tea together--a hot meal of bloater and bread-and-butter--
1029,COME BACK.,with orders to be back in an hour at the latest? for it was busy tide
1030,COME BACK.,"with the firm, and whatever Shadrach's duty may have been at other"
1031,COME BACK.,"times, he was heavy porter now decidedly."
1032,COME BACK.,
1033,COME BACK.,"Over the bridge, round the corner, down by Tooley Street warehouses,"
1034,COME BACK.,famed for suffering from an ailment that must amongst buildings answer
1035,COME BACK.,"to the Saint Anthony's fire of the human being; down past sacking,"
1036,COME BACK.,"sailcloth, and rope warehouses; and down past marine stores, and"
1037,COME BACK.,miseries enough to give a man an ultramarine tint; and then home in the
1038,COME BACK.,pleasant and unsalubrious locality of Snow's Fields.  Snow there was in
1039,COME BACK.,"plenty--muddy, slushy snow; but the only field visible was a large field"
1040,COME BACK.,"for improvement; but then, as Shadrach said, ""How handy for business!"""
1041,COME BACK.,
1042,COME BACK.,"""Here's father!"" was the cry, as the little man rushed in, hugged his"
1043,COME BACK.,"wife, and had his legs hugged at the same time; and then he was in the"
1044,COME BACK.,"warm place by the tea-tray, toasting his steaming boots, and watching"
1045,COME BACK.,"the water being poured into the hissing, hot earthen teapot."
1046,COME BACK.,
1047,COME BACK.,"""Now, then,"" said Mrs Pratt, ""they've all had their teas; and you're"
1048,COME BACK.,"not to touch them, or give them a scrap.  But have you had your dinner?"""
1049,COME BACK.,
1050,COME BACK.,"""No,"" said Shadrach; ""only stayed my stomach with half a pint of four"
1051,COME BACK.,"ale and a hot tater, at one; but I've brought a bloat--There, bless my"
1052,COME BACK.,"soul!  I always did say the tail of your coat is not a safe place, and"
1053,COME BACK.,if I ain't been setting upon it.  What a good job it was a hard-roed
1054,COME BACK.,"'un.  Not hurt a bit.  Who'll toast it?"""
1055,COME BACK.,
1056,COME BACK.,"""Me--me--me!"" chorussed some six or seven voices; and then the most"
1057,COME BACK.,"substantial-looking of the family was picked out, and she began toasting"
1058,COME BACK.,"till the fish began to curl its head and tail together, when the toaster"
1059,COME BACK.,"happening to turn her head to watch the distribution of ""dog's bits"" (ie"
1060,COME BACK.,"scraps of bread-and-butter), the bloater glided from the fork, and had"
1061,COME BACK.,to be picked from the ashes and wiped.
1062,COME BACK.,
1063,COME BACK.,"But it was not so very gritty when done, and only made Shadrach think"
1064,COME BACK.,"about the Arabs and the sandwiches; though, after distributing so many"
1065,COME BACK.,"scraps, father's share of bloater, or grit, was not large; and then up"
1066,COME BACK.,"jumped the refreshed head of the family, and prepared for another start."
1067,COME BACK.,
1068,COME BACK.,"""'Tain't much, eighteen shillings a week, with a family, is it?"" said"
1069,COME BACK.,"Shadrach, counting the money out in his wife's hand; ""but, never mind,"
1070,COME BACK.,"there's lots worse off."""
1071,COME BACK.,
1072,COME BACK.,"Mrs Pratt gave a shrug, as much as to say, ""And lots better.""  But,"
1073,COME BACK.,"smiling again, she told what preparations had been made towards the next"
1074,COME BACK.,day.
1075,COME BACK.,
1076,COME BACK.,"""There, I can't stop,"" said Shadrach; ""you must do it all.  Goose, you"
1077,COME BACK.,"know!  Wait till it's quite late at Leadenhall, and then you'll get it"
1078,COME BACK.,"cheap.  They can't sell them all out."""
1079,COME BACK.,
1080,COME BACK.,Mrs Pratt seemed to think that the goose would make a fearful hole in
1081,COME BACK.,eighteen shillings.
1082,COME BACK.,
1083,COME BACK.,"""There's coals, and grosheries, and vegetables, and bread, and butter;"
1084,COME BACK.,"and Ginger's boots are in a sad state, and--and--"""
1085,COME BACK.,
1086,COME BACK.,"Certainly, Ginger's boots were in a sad state; but that was not of much"
1087,COME BACK.,"consequence, according to the Countess de Noailles; and if she advocated"
1088,COME BACK.,"bare feet amidst the aristocracy, she would have little pity for"
1089,COME BACK.,Ginger--domus name of Mr Pratt's fourth son; for Shadrach was given to
1090,COME BACK.,nicknaming his children in accordance with the common objects of his
1091,COME BACK.,"life: hence ""Ginger,"" ""Pepper,"" and ""Spicy"" were familiar terms for as"
1092,COME BACK.,many children.
1093,COME BACK.,
1094,COME BACK.,"""But didn't I, eh?--the Christmas-box?"" said Shadrach, pinching his chin"
1095,COME BACK.,and looking innocent.
1096,COME BACK.,
1097,COME BACK.,"""Why, an old cheat!"" cried Mrs Pratt, rushing to the door, and finding"
1098,COME BACK.,a brown paper parcel resting behind the bulky umbrella upon her clogs;
1099,COME BACK.,"and then, amidst a volley of cheers, bearing it to the table, which was"
1100,COME BACK.,"directly surrounded by chairs, climbed upon by an escalading party, and"
1101,COME BACK.,it was only by dint of great presence of mind that Mrs Pratt saved the
1102,COME BACK.,"brown paper citadel by hurriedly opening it, drawing out a pound of"
1103,COME BACK.,"raisins, and bribing the attacking party by giving them a plum apiece."
1104,COME BACK.,
1105,COME BACK.,"""Ta ta!  I'm off,"" cried Shadrach, with glistening eyes, as he hurried"
1106,COME BACK.,out and banged the door after him; but only to climb on to the
1107,COME BACK.,window-sill by means of holding on to the water-butt and nearly pulling
1108,COME BACK.,"it over, when he could peep through a hole in the shutter and see his"
1109,COME BACK.,wife hold up to the eyes of the exultant children the Christmas-box
1110,COME BACK.,"regularly given by Teman, Sundry, and Sope to their _employes_.  There"
1111,COME BACK.,"was a pound of raisins, and a pound of currants, and a ditto brown"
1112,COME BACK.,"sugar, a ditto lump, an ounce of spice, and a quarter of a pound of"
1113,COME BACK.,"peel; which was the last packet opened, when Shadrach leaped down and"
1114,COME BACK.,hurried away through the dirty street.
1115,COME BACK.,
1116,COME BACK.,"But it was fine now overhead, and the stars began to twinkle brightly,"
1117,COME BACK.,while the slushy roads were fast growing crisp; but not crisp enough to
1118,COME BACK.,prevent moisture from creeping through into Shadrach's boots.
1119,COME BACK.,
1120,COME BACK.,"""Because they live on the sand which--law!"" cried Shadrach, ""what a pity"
1121,COME BACK.,"we can't live on sand; what a lot the little 'uns do eat.""  And then he"
1122,COME BACK.,"stopped short for a minute to hear some street singers spoiling a carol,"
1123,COME BACK.,"and heard the reference to a babe in a manger; and then somehow, as he"
1124,COME BACK.,"trotted on, Shadrach could not see very clearly for thinking of two"
1125,COME BACK.,lambs lost from his humble fold: one sleeping in its little grave with
1126,COME BACK.,"the pure white snow covering its breast, and the bright stars like"
1127,COME BACK.,"angels' eyes watching it; and the other--""My poor, poor bairn!"" sobbed"
1128,COME BACK.,"the little man, hurrying along; and then he was elbowing his way through"
1129,COME BACK.,"the throng on London Bridge, eager to get back in time."
1130,COME BACK.,
1131,COME BACK.,"""That's the worst of music,"" said Shadrach; ""it allus upsets me.  Ah!"
1132,COME BACK.,"yah! where are you running to, you young dog?"" he cried to a boy who,"
1133,COME BACK.,"yelling out ""I would I were a bird,"" blundered on to the little man's"
1134,COME BACK.,"favourite corn, and made him limp the rest of the way.  ""Not that sort"
1135,COME BACK.,"of music, confound him.  Would he was a bird, indeed!  Pity he ain't got"
1136,COME BACK.,"his neck wrung for him.  Ha! ha! ha!"" laughed Shadrach, taking a long"
1137,COME BACK.,"breath; ""how bracing the wind is off the river! why, I do declare if I"
1138,COME BACK.,"couldn't over posts or anything to-night."""
1139,COME BACK.,
1140,COME BACK.,"But there was no room for Shadrach to run or over posts, for the streets"
1141,COME BACK.,"were thronged with busy, hurrying people.  The roadway was crowded too;"
1142,COME BACK.,and everywhere it was plain to see that Christmas was here.  It was
1143,COME BACK.,"quite a blessing that some of the laden railway-vans did not break down,"
1144,COME BACK.,"for there would have been an absolute block; while, however it was"
1145,COME BACK.,possible for all the presents on the way to get to their destination in
1146,COME BACK.,"time, no one could say.  Shops and people, ay, and weather too, all"
1147,COME BACK.,spoke of Christmas: people looked hearty and genial; the shops looked
1148,COME BACK.,"generous; while, though the weather felt cold, it was not a griping,"
1149,COME BACK.,"nipping cold, but a warm, dry cold that made the slush hard and firm,"
1150,COME BACK.,and whispered of blazing fires and brave old English comforts.
1151,COME BACK.,
1152,COME BACK.,"God bless it!  I love a Christmas-night; and, when I say a"
1153,COME BACK.,"Christmas-night, I mean any night in that jovial, happy tide, when men"
1154,COME BACK.,sink the care and money-hunting to spread enjoyment around; when the
1155,COME BACK.,"hand is open, either for a loving, brotherly pressure, or to aid a"
1156,COME BACK.,"poorer brother; or, better still, the fatherless and the widow.  The"
1157,COME BACK.,"hand open? ay, and the heart too; for there seems to be breathed around"
1158,COME BACK.,"a spirit that softens the hard crust, so that it is open to any emotion,"
1159,COME BACK.,be it such as begets mirth or tears.  Who can say what it is?--that
1160,COME BACK.,"loving, happy exhilaration that comes over us, and makes a man even kiss"
1161,COME BACK.,"his mother-in-law roundly.  Why, it's the very time to get your salary"
1162,COME BACK.,"raised, is Christmas; and now the secret is out, I know I shall never be"
1163,COME BACK.,"forgiven by the heads of firms, who will be pounds out of pocket in"
1164,COME BACK.,future.  Who ever kicked a dog at Christmas; or prosecuted a thief? who
1165,COME BACK.,ever gave a beggar a penny without a blush for the smallness of the sum?
1166,COME BACK.,God bless it! though it comes so soon year after year to tell us how by
1167,COME BACK.,"twelve months our span of life is shorter, and that we are nearer to the"
1168,COME BACK.,long sleep.  God bless it! and may its genial breath softly waft the
1169,COME BACK.,"incense from every frugal hearth in our land, and rest in love where the"
1170,COME BACK.,"poor prepare their humble feast--ay, feast; for the simplest Christmas"
1171,COME BACK.,"dinner is a feast sprinkled by the torch of ""Christmas Present."""
1172,COME BACK.,"There's something stirring in the very air, and the bells sound as they"
1173,COME BACK.,"do at no other time--they go home to the feelings, and call up from the"
1174,COME BACK.,past the happy emotions planted in our hearts by God; but which a busy
1175,COME BACK.,life and rude contact with the world have caused to flee away and hide.
1176,COME BACK.,"Back they come though, till, in the wild delight, eyes sparkle, cheeks"
1177,COME BACK.,"flush, and hands grasp hands in the fulness of heart to give a squeeze"
1178,COME BACK.,"often accompanied by a twinkling eye, where a tear will force its way."
1179,COME BACK.,Holy--sacred--are those reunions--those family meetings; and sad is it
1180,COME BACK.,when a seat becomes vacant; but is not that loss a bond to bind those
1181,COME BACK.,"left the tighter, as wishing each other ""a merry Christmas,"" as I do,"
1182,COME BACK.,"they say--""God bless it!"""
1183,COME BACK.,
1184,COME BACK.,Is there such a thing as a kind of magnetism in life by which spirit
1185,COME BACK.,"whispers to spirit, and by some occult warning we know that those we"
1186,COME BACK.,love are near?  Or why should old Shadrach start and shiver as he passed
1187,COME BACK.,"some one in the throng, and then mutter to himself very"
1188,COME BACK.,"thoughtfully--""Poor Polly!"""
1189,COME BACK.,
1190,COME BACK.,"But it was a busy night, and what baskets did Shadrach lug about from"
1191,COME BACK.,"Gracechurch Street.  East, west, north, and south--here, there, and"
1192,COME BACK.,"everywhere.  Light porter, indeed! why, we won't insult him.  But he"
1193,COME BACK.,"didn't mind, bless you, though he groaned and grunted under his load of"
1194,COME BACK.,Christmas fruit; and there was something merry to say to every servant
1195,COME BACK.,"lass who lightened his basket.  Toast and ale, and egg-flip too, were"
1196,COME BACK.,"waiting when eleven o'clock struck, and though Mr Sope wanted to keep"
1197,COME BACK.,"open another hour, and Sundry said half an hour, old Teman, the head,"
1198,COME BACK.,"said ""No! regular hours were the thing, and it was not fair to the young"
1199,COME BACK.,men; and that if the Queen herself came from Buckingham Palace and
1200,COME BACK.,"wanted a pound or two of fruit, she should not have it after the"
1201,COME BACK.,"shutters were up."""
1202,COME BACK.,
1203,COME BACK.,It would have done your heart good to have seen Shadrach rattle up those
1204,COME BACK.,"shutters, as the boy down stairs held them up to the roller ready for"
1205,COME BACK.,him to take.
1206,COME BACK.,
1207,COME BACK.,"""Ter-r-r-r-r-rattle"" went the shutter as he dragged it over the roller,"
1208,COME BACK.,"and then ""flip-flap-bang,"" it was in its place.  ""Ter-r-r-r-r-rattle"""
1209,COME BACK.,"went another, and nearly knocked an old gentleman over, but he only gave"
1210,COME BACK.,"a leap, skip, and a jump, and laughed.  Two shutters up, and that big,"
1211,COME BACK.,nodding Chinese mandarin with the bare stomach is covered up.
1212,COME BACK.,"""Ter-r-r-r-rattle,"" and part of the big China punchbowl covered."
1213,COME BACK.,"""Ter-r-r-r-rattle,"" and the whole of it covered.  At it again--and the"
1214,COME BACK.,"squeezy almond-eyed lady hidden.  At it again, nine shutters up.  At it"
1215,COME BACK.,"again, skipping about as though he had never walked a step that day, but"
1216,COME BACK.,"just come fresh out of a lavender-and-clover bed ready for work, after"
1217,COME BACK.,"lying by for a rest.  ""Ter-r-r-r-rattle-bing-bang-bump.""  He did it that"
1218,COME BACK.,"time: knocked the policeman's helmet off, and sent it rolling along the"
1219,COME BACK.,pavement.
1220,COME BACK.,
1221,COME BACK.,"""God bless my soul,"" said Shadrach, aghast at such an assault upon the"
1222,COME BACK.,"law of the land, but the policeman only laughed, and old Teman only"
1223,COME BACK.,"laughed, and called the bobby up to the door, while he fetched him a"
1224,COME BACK.,"glass of egg-flip himself, and wished him ""A merry Christmas."""
1225,COME BACK.,
1226,COME BACK.,"""Bang--slap--slip--flap--crack--jangle--jang--jink jonk--jank!""  There"
1227,COME BACK.,"they are; the twelve shutters up, and both iron bars; screws rammed in,"
1228,COME BACK.,"and all tight; and Shadrach not a bit out of breath.  Shop closed, and"
1229,COME BACK.,no Queen to beg for a pound or two of fruit and test old Teman's
1230,COME BACK.,"loyalty, as he ladled out the flip to his dozen men, when, wishing he"
1231,COME BACK.,"could have poured his share into his pocket, Shadrach said ""Good-night!"""
1232,COME BACK.,and was off homeward.
1233,COME BACK.,
1234,COME BACK.,"Plenty of people in the streets yet, but London Bridge seemed empty on"
1235,COME BACK.,"the west side when Shadrach reached it, and then stopped at the first"
1236,COME BACK.,"recess to look over at the rushing river.  A bright, calm, light night,"
1237,COME BACK.,"with snow lying here and there in patches; here upon pier or barge,"
1238,COME BACK.,"there upon roof, and all glittering in the light of the full moon."
1239,COME BACK.,"Lanthorns here and there where vessels were moored, and lamps in lines"
1240,COME BACK.,upon the distant bridges.  Frost laying hold of everything; but warmed
1241,COME BACK.,"with exercise and the genial draught, Shadrach felt not the cold, but"
1242,COME BACK.,"knelt gazing over at the hurrying tide, and comparing it, perhaps, with"
1243,COME BACK.,"his life.  But there was something else upon his mind, something that"
1244,COME BACK.,"kept bringing a shadow over him, and kept him from hurrying home."
1245,COME BACK.,
1246,COME BACK.,"At length he stepped down, and walked slowly across the bridge towards"
1247,COME BACK.,"the Borough; but then, with a strange, thoughtful, undecided step, he"
1248,COME BACK.,crossed over and sauntered back towards the city again; and at last
1249,COME BACK.,"stood leaning once more over the parapet, gazing at the glittering"
1250,COME BACK.,"river, till he started, for the clocks began to strike twelve.  There"
1251,COME BACK.,"were the faint and distant tones, and the sharp, clear sounds of those"
1252,COME BACK.,"at hand, mingled with which came the heavy boom of Saint Paul's, till"
1253,COME BACK.,"the last stroke had fallen upon his ear, when with a half-shudder of"
1254,COME BACK.,"cold, Shadrach once more stepped down and commenced with some display of"
1255,COME BACK.,vigour his homeward walk.
1256,COME BACK.,
1257,COME BACK.,"There was scarcely a soul to be seen now upon the bridge, but as he"
1258,COME BACK.,"reached the middle recess, Shadrach paused with a strange, tumultuous"
1259,COME BACK.,"beating at his heart, for there, in the same position as that in which"
1260,COME BACK.,"he had so lately leant, was the figure of a woman, evidently watching"
1261,COME BACK.,the rushing river.
1262,COME BACK.,
1263,COME BACK.,"""Could she be meditating self-destruction?""  Shadrach thought.  ""Could"
1264,COME BACK.,he save her?  But why should such thoughts come when he had often and
1265,COME BACK.,"often seen women of her class in the same attitude?"" he asked himself"
1266,COME BACK.,"the question, and could find no answer, except that it was so sad to see"
1267,COME BACK.,a homeless outcast there upon a Christmas-eve.
1268,COME BACK.,
1269,COME BACK.,"""Poor thing--poor thing!"" muttered Shadrach to himself; and then, going"
1270,COME BACK.,"up and speaking in a husky voice: ""Had you not better go home, my girl?"""
1271,COME BACK.,
1272,COME BACK.,"""What?"" cried the girl, angrily; ""home?  There's no home for such as I."""
1273,COME BACK.,
1274,COME BACK.,"""But the night--the cold--and--ah, my God!--Polly!"""
1275,COME BACK.,
1276,COME BACK.,"Shadrach had advanced to the girl, and laid his hand upon her shoulder;"
1277,COME BACK.,"when, starting, she turned hastily round and confronted him beneath the"
1278,COME BACK.,"lamp; a mutual recognition took place, when, with a bitter cry, the girl"
1279,COME BACK.,"darted away, while her father staggered and fell, striking his head"
1280,COME BACK.,violently against the granite seat.
1281,COME BACK.,
1282,COME BACK.,"But he soon recovered himself, slowly got up, looked hopelessly round at"
1283,COME BACK.,"the deserted bridge, and then walked with feeble, uncertain steps in the"
1284,COME BACK.,direction of home.
1285,COME BACK.,
1286,COME BACK.,The old Dutch clock upon the wall had given warning that it was about to
1287,COME BACK.,"strike one; the fire was low, and the candle burned with a long snuff,"
1288,COME BACK.,as Shadrach Pratt and his wife sat beside the fire silent and tearful.
1289,COME BACK.,"There was an open Bible upon his lap, and he had been essaying to read,"
1290,COME BACK.,but the print looked blurred and confused; his voice was husky; and more
1291,COME BACK.,"than one tear had dropped upon the page where it said--""I will arise and"
1292,COME BACK.,"go to my father,"" and again where ""his father fell upon his neck and"
1293,COME BACK.,"kissed him;"" and there was sorrow that night in the humble home."
1294,COME BACK.,
1295,COME BACK.,"The candle burned down, quivered in the socket, and then went out; the"
1296,COME BACK.,"fire sank together again and again with a musical tinkle, and then"
1297,COME BACK.,ceased to give forth its warmth; but through the two round holes in the
1298,COME BACK.,"shutters the bright moonbeams shone, bathing the couple with their"
1299,COME BACK.,"light, as slowly they knelt down, and Shadrach repeated some words,"
1300,COME BACK.,"stopping long upon that impressive clause--""As we forgive them that"
1301,COME BACK.,"trespass against us."""
1302,COME BACK.,
1303,COME BACK.,"""And you'll leave the back door unfastened, Mary?"" whispered Shadrach."
1304,COME BACK.,
1305,COME BACK.,Mrs Pratt nodded.
1306,COME BACK.,
1307,COME BACK.,"""And forget the past if she should come?"""
1308,COME BACK.,
1309,COME BACK.,"""Ah, me! ah, me! my poor girl!"" cried the mother, thoroughly"
1310,COME BACK.,"heart-broken, and for the first time since her child forsook her home"
1311,COME BACK.,"showing any emotion; ""what have we done that we should be her judges?"""
1312,COME BACK.,
1313,COME BACK.,"The moonbeams shone brightly in as the couple rose, and after listening"
1314,COME BACK.,"for a moment at the stair foot, Shadrach walked to the back door, opened"
1315,COME BACK.,"it, uttered a cry, and then fell upon his knees; for there, upon the"
1316,COME BACK.,"cold snow, with her cheek resting upon the threshold, lay the lost one"
1317,COME BACK.,"of the flock--cold, pale, and motionless, but with her hands"
1318,COME BACK.,"outstretched, and clasped together, as if praying for forgiveness."
1319,COME BACK.,Stretched upon the cold snow by the door she had stolen from two years
1320,COME BACK.,"before; lying where she had crept, with trembling hands, and quivering,"
1321,COME BACK.,"fevered lips, whispering to herself that she would die there, for she"
1322,COME BACK.,dared ask no entrance.
1323,COME BACK.,
1324,COME BACK.,"Need the story be told of that Christmas-day, and of the joy in that"
1325,COME BACK.,poor man's home--of the sick one weeping in her mother's arms--of the
1326,COME BACK.,welcome given to one the world called lost!  I trow not; but let us skip
1327,COME BACK.,"another year, and then stand in the same room, in the same place, and at"
1328,COME BACK.,"the same hour, as with a bright light in his humble, ordinary face,"
1329,COME BACK.,"Shadrach Pratt, a man not addicted to quoting Scripture, takes his"
1330,COME BACK.,"homely wife's hand, and whispers--"
1331,COME BACK.,
1332,COME BACK.,"""More than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance."""

1340,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"And I've found that out that it isn't money, nor a well-furnished house,"
1341,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"nor clothes that make a man happy, but the possession of a good wife;"
1342,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,and it took me ten years to find it out.  It took me ten selfish years--
1343,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,years that I had been spending thinking more about myself than anybody
1344,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"else, you know.  And all that while I'd got so used to it that I never"
1345,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,took any notice of the patience and forbearance and tenderness that was
1346,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"always being shown to me.  It's all right, thinks I, and it's me that's"
1347,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"master, and I've a right to be served.  And that's the case with too"
1348,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"many of us: we get married, and are precious proud taking the wife out"
1349,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"for a bit; but then come the domestic duties, and mostly a few children,"
1350,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"when it's hard work to make both ends meet, and so the poor wife gets"
1351,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"lower and lower and lower, till she's a regular slave, while the husband"
1352,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"looks on, and never stretches out a hand to save her a bit of trouble."
1353,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1354,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Well, that's measuring other people's corn by your own bushel, and"
1355,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"that's right--that's just what it is: that's my bushel, and allowing for"
1356,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"it being a bit battered and knocked about, it's surprising what a"
1357,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"correct measure it is, and if ever I use that old measure to try any"
1358,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"other man's corn, and I find as it don't do for it, I always feel as if"
1359,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I should like to shake that fellow's hand off, for I know he's a trump"
1360,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,and a man worth knowing.
1361,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1362,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Now, I'm going to tell you how I found it all out, and in finding it all"
1363,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"out as I call it, let me tell you I mean principally what a fool I had"
1364,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"been for ten long years.  I needn't tell you when it was, and Jane there"
1365,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"don't care to be too nice about the day--very well, we'll say you do,"
1366,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"but never mind now--only it was Christmas-eve, and I come home from work"
1367,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"with my hands in my pockets, and a week's wage there too, and when I"
1368,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"mounted the stairs and went into our shabby room, there was the wife"
1369,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"down in the low rocking-chair, with two of the little ones in her lap,"
1370,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and though her head was partly turned away I could see she was crying,"
1371,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and another time I should have flown at her about it, for I don't mind"
1372,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,saying as I was a regular brute to her--not hitting or anything of that
1373,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"sort, you know, but sending hard words such as she's told me since hit"
1374,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,harder than blows.  But I couldn't fly at her then on account of a
1375,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"strange chap as was there.  Shabby, snuffy-looking little fellow, with"
1376,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"flue in his hair and pits in his chin, where he couldn't shave into, so"
1377,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"that, what with his face not being over well washed, and his old black"
1378,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"clothes looking greasy, he didn't seem the sort of visitor as you'd care"
1379,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"about having in your place, because, though I came home dirty with my"
1380,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"trade, I always set that down as clean dirt, and don't mind it."
1381,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1382,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Well, what's for you?""  I says, precious gruff."
1383,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1384,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Two pun fifteen and ninepence, with costs,"" he says, bringing out a"
1385,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"paper; and then you might have knocked me down with it, for I knew it"
1386,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"was for rent.  There'd been a bother about it several times, and no"
1387,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"wonder, and as I'd promised again and again, and never kept my word, as"
1388,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I should have done, why this was come on me, and there was a man in"
1389,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,possession.
1390,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1391,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"There was only one thing to be done, and of course that I does at once;"
1392,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"goes over the way to the landlord, and when I got into his room I began"
1393,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,to bluster a bit.
1394,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1395,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""It's a deal too bad,"" I says."
1396,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1397,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Have you brought the money, my man?"" he says."
1398,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1399,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""No, I ain't,"" I says, ""and I thinks--"""
1400,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1401,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Now, look here, Roberts,"" he says, quite quietly, and holding up his"
1402,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"finger, ""You're not the sort of tenant I want.  You're no credit to the"
1403,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"place.  If you had been a decent fellow, struggling against the world,"
1404,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and you owed me twice as much, and I saw you meant to pay, why I'd never"
1405,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"have put in the bailiffs; but when I see a man going on as you do, why I"
1406,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,say if you've money to waste you can pay your rent.  Sorry for your
1407,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"wife, but if you can't pay the money now, there's the door.  I'm not"
1408,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"going to be annoyed in my own place."""
1409,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1410,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"He wasn't a big man, but he took me down twenty pegs in a minute in his"
1411,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"cool, easy way, and before I knew where I was I'd backed out, and was"
1412,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"going across the street, when I recollects the man sitting there at"
1413,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"home, and of a Christmas-eve too, and I slowly went back and sent in a"
1414,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"message to landlord, and directly after I stood before him again, and"
1415,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"after no end of a hard fight he consented to let a pound stop on, and"
1416,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,send the man off if I'd pay down one pound fifteen and ninepence.
1417,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1418,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Well, I thought a minute, and hesitated, and thought again, and then"
1419,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"recollected the dirty, snuffy fellow there, and that settled me, so that"
1420,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I paid down the money, took my receipt, and a note to the man, and"
1421,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"directly after I was standing in my own place, with that chap gone, and"
1422,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,only threepence left of my six-and-thirty shillings for a Christmas
1423,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,dinner; and now it came upon me hot and strong why it was that I stood
1424,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"there like that, and as I saw it all so plain I set my teeth and brought"
1425,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"my fist down upon the table in a way as made the candlestick jump, and"
1426,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,sent the children trembling up to their mother.
1427,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1428,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""It's because nobody ever said to me, `Sam Roberts, what'll you take to"
1429,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"eat?'""  And then I banged my fist on the table again, and began walking"
1430,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,up and down the room.
1431,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1432,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Nobody spoke to me, but the wife got the children off quietly to bed,"
1433,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and at last, when I was still striding up and down, I felt her hand on"
1434,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"my shoulder, and she whispered quite low like--"
1435,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1436,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Don't mind it, dear."""
1437,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1438,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""But I do,"" I said, quite fierce and loud, and the poor thing stole away"
1439,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"from me again, and though I didn't look at her, I knew she wasn't able"
1440,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"to keep the tears back, and that I'd been the cause again."
1441,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1442,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I took no notice then though, for something was working in me, and at"
1443,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"last I told her to go to bed, and she did, while I sat before the bit of"
1444,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,fire in the room and thought it over.
1445,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1446,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Now don't laugh at me when I tell you that I believe in bells, but I"
1447,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"can't help it if you do, for they always seem to speak to me like music"
1448,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"does, and if there's ever anything will act on me it's the sound of a"
1449,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"peal of bells.  It was bitter cold that night, and yet I didn't feel it;"
1450,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"the wind howled along the street, and I could now and then hear the"
1451,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"great flakes of snow come softly patting at the window, and then the"
1452,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"sashes would shake, and the wind rumble in the chimney, while every now"
1453,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and then came the sound of the bells, not bright and joyful, but sad and"
1454,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"sobbing and mournful.  I knew it was a merry, rejoicing time with every"
1455,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"one else.  I could not attend to that, for I was gradually getting to"
1456,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"see one thing that I kept on fighting against, and that was, what a fool"
1457,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,I had been.
1458,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1459,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Fight against it I did, but it was no use, for as the streets got more"
1460,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"quiet, and the wind sunk, the bells rang out clearer and clearer, and"
1461,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,seemed to keep telling me of it.  Now I knew of it by the threepence in
1462,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,my pocket; now it was by the shabby floor; then the beggarly furniture
1463,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,and the miserable fire; and though I didn't cross the room I had it in
1464,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"my mind's eye, and there it all was written plain enough in my wife's"
1465,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,face.
1466,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1467,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"And yet I wouldn't own to it, though the bells seemed to be speaking to"
1468,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"me, and rang out plainer and plainer all my waste and carelessness, till"
1469,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,all at once they stopped for a minute; when one big bell began to toll
1470,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"slowly, ""boom, boom, boom""; and that did it, for the next moment I gave"
1471,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"a wild sort of cry, and was down on my knees with my hands over my face,"
1472,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and the big tears, hot and blinding, bursting out from between my"
1473,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"fingers.  But the tears might blind, they could not hide that, though"
1474,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"every one seemed like hot lead.  They could not hide what I then saw,"
1475,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"for the bell still went on, now swept away in the distance, now coming"
1476,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"nearer and nearer, till it filled the room, and made the very place seem"
1477,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"to tremble and quiver, as did every nerve in my body."
1478,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1479,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"No; the tears could not hide that scene as the tolling bell brought up,"
1480,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and there I could see the snow upon the ground, and two mourners"
1481,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,following a little coffin through the street of a country-town with
1482,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"their footmarks left black in the pathway, as though even they were"
1483,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"marks of the funeral.  And there, too, was the church, and the"
1484,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"grey-haired clergyman meeting us at the gate, and me hard, bitter, and"
1485,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"sullen, seeing it all unmoved, and listening to the words as came now to"
1486,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"my ears borne upon the bells.  There, too, was the little grave, and the"
1487,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"earth thrown out all black round it, and every spade-full of earth, too,"
1488,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"black, just as though everything was in mourning for the little flower"
1489,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"as the bitter winter had nipped.  Yes; there it all was, with the poor"
1490,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"wife sinking down at last upon her knees beside the open grave, and"
1491,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"letting a few of a mother's tears fall silently upon the little plain,"
1492,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"white coffin, and me--hard, bitter, and cold."
1493,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1494,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Boom, boom, boom""--how it all came back, and how I saw it all now.  How"
1495,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"plain it all was that I had been a fool and my own enemy, and ready to"
1496,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,blame every one but myself for my ill success; and at last muttering
1497,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""pardon, pardon,"" I held up my hands, and then started to my feet, for"
1498,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"the bells had stopped, and my hands were taken by some one there in the"
1499,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"dark, so that I trembled; till I heard my name whispered, and this time"
1500,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,I did not turn from the offered comfort.
1501,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1502,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Just then out rang the bells again, bright, cheerful, and merry; and,"
1503,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"though I listened attentively, and tried to make them go with my"
1504,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"thoughts, they seemed now quite to have left me to myself."
1505,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1506,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"And then, without thinking of the bitter night, or our poverty, or what"
1507,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"we should do for a Christmas dinner, we sat there together wrapped up in"
1508,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"one idea, and that was that there was a change come over me, for somehow"
1509,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I felt quite a different man; and, though no word was spoken, we seemed"
1510,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"to understand one another, and that was quite enough for us."
1511,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1512,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"All at once I turns to the wife, and I says, ""I don't know what's come"
1513,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"over me, lass; feelings have got the better of me; I'm almost choking."""
1514,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"And then we both started up, for it seemed hot, and close, and heavy in"
1515,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,the room.
1516,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1517,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Why, it's fire somewhere,"" I says, and then I turned all over hot and"
1518,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"trembling, and the wet stood upon my forehead, for I thought the place"
1519,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"below was on fire, and we on the second floor with three children."
1520,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1521,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I ran to the window and opened it, and just then there was the rattle of"
1522,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"a policeman going, and first one voice and then another shouting,"
1523,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Fire!"" while directly after there was a tremendous noise as shook the"
1524,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"house from top to bottom, and made the plaster off the ceiling come"
1525,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"rattling down on our heads, while the shop-front seemed to be blown out."
1526,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Then there came another crashing explosion, and that was the jingling"
1527,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,noise and falling of window-glass upon the pavement; and then came
1528,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"screaming and crying out, the sounds of people running and kicking at"
1529,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"doors, shouting cries for help, and a hundred people outside shrieking,"
1530,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Fire!"""
1531,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1532,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"For a minute I stood with my hands to my head, as though it was all a"
1533,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"dream.  I felt lost, and could not tell what to do, but the next moment"
1534,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I had two of the children in my arms; and, shouting to the wife, ""Slip"
1535,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"on a few things!""  I tore open the door and darted down the stairs"
1536,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"through the heat and smoke to the first-floor, where the rush of flame"
1537,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and smoke almost drove me back; but I knew it was for life, and I dashed"
1538,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"down the rest of the way along the passage, and then fell staggering"
1539,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,down with my load upon the pavement.
1540,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1541,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"They had us up, though, in a moment, blackened, scorched, half"
1542,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"suffocated, and smarting; and then, after casting one look up at our"
1543,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"window, where the wife stood with one little one in her arms, I ran"
1544,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"towards the blazing passage, but a policeman and two men had hold of me"
1545,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,in a moment.
1546,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1547,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Hold back, man!"" said one of 'em; ""it's madness to try it."""
1548,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1549,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Certain death,"" says another."
1550,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1551,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Yes, if you don't let go!""  I roared, feeling as furious as a wild"
1552,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"beast at being held back.  ""Let go; I tell you they'll be burnt to death"
1553,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"if I don't save them;"" and then I fought with 'em to get away, but they"
1554,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"were too strong for me; and, more coming to help, I could do nothing."
1555,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1556,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Pray, let me go,"" I cried at last, quite pitifully, for I could hear"
1557,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"shrieks for help from up above, and felt that some one would think I had"
1558,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"taken care of myself and left her to perish; and then, what with the"
1559,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"shrieks and the thoughts, I felt almost mad, and strove and plunged so,"
1560,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,that I got free and dashed at the door where the flames came pouring
1561,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,out.
1562,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1563,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I believe that I should have rushed in, but at that moment there was"
1564,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"another loud explosion, and I seemed to be lifted off my feet, and"
1565,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"thrown back into the road, where I lay quite helpless and half-stunned"
1566,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"for a few moments.  But I soon came to again, just as they were going to"
1567,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"carry me through the crowd, and begging of them not to take me away, I"
1568,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"got them to let me stop, for the men wanted to see what was going on;"
1569,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"for now the flames were mounting up higher and higher, and rushing out"
1570,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"of the first-floor windows, while that one under where my poor wife"
1571,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"stood shrieking for help was glowing with light, and I knew the fire"
1572,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,would burst out there directly.
1573,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1574,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,The gunpowder canisters in the shop as they exploded had all helped to
1575,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"make the fire burn more rapidly, and before the first engine came, the"
1576,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"place was blazing furiously, while, instead of trying anything to save"
1577,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"her who stood at the window, people did nothing but shriek and scream"
1578,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and wring their hands.  I soon saw, unless something was done the fire"
1579,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"would get the better of us, while in spite of all I could think of,"
1580,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,there seemed no way to save her who stood crying there for the help we
1581,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,could not give--nothing but for her to jump out.  I ran about through
1582,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"the crowd here and there, calling to the people to save her, and for the"
1583,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"time quite mad and frantic that I could not get at her, when all at once"
1584,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"there was a loud shout and cheer, and the people gave way, as along at"
1585,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,full speed came the tall fire-escape.
1586,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1587,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I ran to help drag it along, and in a few moments they had it leaning"
1588,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"beneath the window, but it was too short, and I groaned again, for it"
1589,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"seemed only brought to raise our hopes, and then dash them down; but the"
1590,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"next moment the fly ladder was pulled up by ropes, and before any one"
1591,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"could stay me, I tried to get up."
1592,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1593,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"But the escape man was before me, and up and up he went, till there came"
1594,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"a fierce burst of flame and smoke right upon him and beat him back, so"
1595,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"that he crept down again, till he reached where I was coming up, and"
1596,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,then I got past him and past the flames where the escape was quite on
1597,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"fire, and then up to the window where my wife stood clutching the child,"
1598,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,and leaned half-fainting from the window.
1599,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1600,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"It was a hard matter to reach to them, but I got one foot upon the sill,"
1601,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"dashed out a pane of glass to get a hold of the sash for my hand, and"
1602,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"then began to wonder how I could save them, when I heard a cry from"
1603,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,below and a regular yell of shrieks as the light escape ladder was
1604,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"burned through and fell to the ground, so that it was only by an effort"
1605,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,I saved myself from felling; but I crept inside the room with a horrid
1606,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"sensation upon me, for I felt that our last hour was come, and a"
1607,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,frightful one it was.
1608,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1609,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"The wife just turned her horrified face to me once, and then fainted,"
1610,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"while I could see but little of what was going on below, on account of"
1611,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"the rising flame and smoke, and as to the heat it was awful--so"
1612,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"stifling, that I was glad to hold out the heads of them with me, for the"
1613,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,smoke came rolling through the door.
1614,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1615,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I knew that in a few minutes we must be burned to death, and how awful"
1616,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"those thoughts were that came upon me is more than I can describe, and"
1617,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"yet in spite of all there seemed a calmness, even when I heard a"
1618,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"crackling behind me, and saw the flickering light playing through the"
1619,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,smoke behind as the flames were creeping into the room.
1620,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1621,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Just then I heard a shouting below, and some one to the left cried to"
1622,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,me.  I looked up and found there were two men at the third-floor window
1623,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"of the next house, and one of them shouted:--"
1624,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1625,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Put her down and try and catch this,"" and then he began swinging a rope"
1626,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,towards me till I got hold of it; and without waiting for instructions
1627,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"made it fast round the wife's waist, helped her out of the window, and"
1628,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"held on till they had the rope tight, and shouted to me, when I left go,"
1629,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,and saw her go clear of the flame and smoke with such a fearful swing
1630,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"that I felt sure they would let go, and I shrunk back, for I dared not"
1631,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,look.
1632,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1633,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Before a minute was over I heard them shout again, and then I looked out"
1634,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"trembling, and caught at the rope again two or three times before I"
1635,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"could get it, for it was a hard matter to get it swung far enough.  But"
1636,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"I had it at last, and pulled in as much as they could spare, so as to"
1637,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"tie it round the little child somewhere about the middle, when they saw"
1638,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"me make a sign, for I could not shout, I was that choked, and then they"
1639,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"hauled in while I kept hold too, so as to keep the little thing from"
1640,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,swinging down so fearfully.
1641,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1642,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"It was a good long rope, and even when they had the little one safe"
1643,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,there was enough left for me to fasten it with a half hitch round my
1644,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"waist and climb out and hang by the window-sill till they were ready,"
1645,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"for the room was burning, and the flames came over me, quite scorching"
1646,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"my hands, so that in another few minutes I must have dropped.  But the"
1647,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"rope tightened, and I left go, swinging through the air right clear of"
1648,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,the smoke and flame; and then I felt myself dragged up and in at the
1649,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"window, but I did not see or hear anything more for some little time."
1650,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1651,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"It was a shocking fire, certainly, but it's when people are at the worst"
1652,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"that they find out how neighbourly those around could be, for we found"
1653,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"them as took us in; and in spite of being so frightened and scorched,"
1654,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,after two or three hours' sleep we did not feel so bad but we could put
1655,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"on the things that were lent us, and I can't help thinking that we"
1656,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,should have given thanks somewhere else for our escape besides in our
1657,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"bedroom, if it had not been for our burnt-off hair."
1658,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
1659,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"And in spite of all loss and care, that was a pleasant Christmas-day we"
1660,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"spent, where everybody seemed as if they could not make enough of us;"
1661,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and, at the same time, there was a feeling in my heart that seemed to"
1662,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,cheer me and make me look hopefully to the future.  For the clothes and
1663,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,furniture that we had lost were none to be so proud of--rather different
1664,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"to what we now have round us, and when I tell the wife so, I get a"
1665,UPON CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"pleasant smile, for she says there's light behind every cloud."

1672,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1673,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""But what an out-of-the-way place to get to,"" I said, after being most"
1674,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"cordially received by my old school fellow and his wife, one bitter"
1675,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"night after a long ride.  ""But you really are glad to see me, eh?"""
1676,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1677,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Now, hold your tongue, do,"" cried Ned and his wife in a breath.  ""You"
1678,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"won't get away again under a month, so don't think it.  But where we are"
1679,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"going to put you I don't know,"" said Ned."
1680,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1681,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Oh I can sleep anywhere, chairs, table, anything you like; only make me"
1682,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"welcome.  Fine old house this seems, but however came you to take it?"""
1683,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1684,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Got it cheap, my boy.  Been shut up for twenty years.  It's haunted,"
1685,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and no one will live in it.  But I have it full for this Christmas, at"
1686,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"all events, and what's more I have some potent spirits in the place too,"
1687,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"but they are all corked down tightly, so there is no fear at present."
1688,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But I say, Lilly,"" cried Ned, addressing his wife, ""why we shall have to"
1689,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"go into the haunted room and give him our place."""
1690,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1691,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""That you won't,"" I said.  ""I came down here on purpose to take you by"
1692,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"surprise, and to beg for a snack of dinner on Christmas-day; and now you"
1693,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"are going to give me about the greatest treat possible, a bed in a"
1694,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"haunted room.  What kind of a ghost is it?"""
1695,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1696,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""You mustn't laugh,"" said Ned, trying to appear very serious; ""for there"
1697,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"is not a soul living within ten miles of this place, that would not give"
1698,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,you a long account of the horrors of the Red Chamber: of spots of blood
1699,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,upon the bedclothes coming down in a regular rain; noises; clashing of
1700,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"swords; shrieks and groans; skeletons or transparent bodies.  Oh, my"
1701,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"dear fellow, you needn't grin, for it's all gospel truth about here, and"
1702,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"if we did not keep that room screwed up, not a servant would stay in the"
1703,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"house."""
1704,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1705,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Wish I could buy it and take it away,"" I said."
1706,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1707,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""I wish you could, indeed,"" cried Ned, cordially."
1708,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1709,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,Half an hour after Ned and I were busy with screwdriver and candle busy
1710,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"in the large corridors, turning the rusty screws which held a large door"
1711,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,at the extreme end of the house.  First one and then another was twirled
1712,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,out till nothing held the door but the lock; the key for which Ned
1713,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"Harrington now produced from his pocket--an old, many-warded, rusty key,"
1714,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,at least a couple of hundred years old.
1715,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1716,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Hold the candle a little lower,"" said Ned, ""here's something in the"
1717,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"keyhole,"" when pulling out his knife, he picked out a quantity of paper,"
1718,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"evidently very recently stuffed in.  He then inserted the key, and after"
1719,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"a good deal of effort it turned, and the lock shot back with a harsh,"
1720,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"grating noise.  Ned then tried the handle, but the door remained fast;"
1721,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and though he tugged and tugged, it still stuck, till I put one hand to"
1722,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"help him, when our united efforts made it come open with a rush,"
1723,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"knocking over the candle, and there we were standing upon the portal of"
1724,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,the haunted room in the dark.
1725,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1726,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""I'll fetch a light in a moment out of the hall,"" said Ned, and he"
1727,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"slipped off, while I must confess to a certain feeling of trepidation on"
1728,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"being left alone, listening to a moaning, whistling noise, which I knew"
1729,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"to be the wind, but which had all the same a most dismal effect upon my"
1730,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"nerves, which, in spite of my eagerness to be the inmate of the closed"
1731,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"room, began to whisper very strongly that they did not like it at all."
1732,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But the next minute Ned was beside me with the light, and we entered the"
1733,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,gloomy dusty old chamber--a bed-chamber furnished after the fashion of
1734,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the past century.  The great four-post bedstead looked heavy and gloomy,"
1735,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and when we drew back the curtains, I half expected to see a body lying"
1736,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"in state, but no, all was very dusty, very gloomy, and soul chilling,"
1737,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,but nothing more.
1738,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1739,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Come, there's plenty of room for a roaring fire,"" said Ned, ""and I"
1740,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"think after all we had better come here ourselves, and let you have our"
1741,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"room."""
1742,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1743,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""That you will not,"" I said, determinedly.  ""Order them to light a fire,"
1744,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and have some well-aired things put upon that bed, and it will be a"
1745,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"clever ghost that wakes me to-night, for I'm as tired as a dog."""
1746,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1747,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Here, Mary,"" shouted Ned to one of the maids, ""coals and wood here, and"
1748,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"a broom."""
1749,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1750,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"We waited about, peering here and there at the old toilet-ware and"
1751,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"stands, the old chest of drawers and armoire, old chairs and paintings,"
1752,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,for all seemed as if the room had been suddenly quitted; while inside a
1753,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"huge cupboard beside the fireplace hung a dusty horseman's cloak, and in"
1754,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,the corner were a long thin rapier and a quaint old-fashioned firelock.
1755,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1756,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Strikes chilly and damp,"" said I, snuffing the smell of old boots and"
1757,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,fine dust.
1758,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1759,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Ah, but we'll soon drive that out,"" said Ned.  ""But you'd better give"
1760,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"in, my boy.  'Pon my word, I'm ashamed to let you come in here."""
1761,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1762,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Pooh! nonsense!""  I said.  ""Give me a roaring fire, and that's all I"
1763,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"want."""
1764,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1765,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Ah!"" cried Ned.  ""But what a while that girl is;"" and then he stepped"
1766,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"out into the passage.  ""Why, what are you standing there for?"" he cried."
1767,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Come and light this fire."""
1768,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1769,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Plee', sir, I dussent,"" said the maid."
1770,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1771,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Here, give me hold,"" cried Ned, in a pet; ""and send your mistress"
1772,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"here;"" and then he made his appearance with a coal-scuttle, paper, and"
1773,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,wood; when between us we soon had a fire alight and roaring up the huge
1774,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"chimney, while the bright flames flickered and danced, and gave quite a"
1775,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,cheerful aspect to the place.
1776,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1777,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Well,"" cried Mrs Harrington, who now appeared, ""how are you getting"
1778,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"on?"" but neither Ned's wife nor her sister stood looking, for, in spite"
1779,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of all protestations, dressed as they were, they set to sweeping,"
1780,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"dusting, airing linen, bed, mattress, etcetera, we helping to the best"
1781,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of our ability--for no maid, either by threats or persuasion, would"
1782,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"enter the place--and at last we made the place look, if not comfortable,"
1783,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,at all events less dismal than before we entered.  The old blinds came
1784,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"down like so much tinder when touched, while, as to the curtains, the"
1785,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"first attempt to draw them brought down such a cloud of dust, that they"
1786,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"were left alone, though Mrs Harrington promised that the place should"
1787,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,be thoroughly seen to in the morning.
1788,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1789,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"Returning to the drawing-room, the remainder of the evening was most"
1790,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,agreeably spent; while the cause of my host and hostess's prolonged
1791,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,absence produced endless comments and anecdotes respecting the Red
1792,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,Chamber--some of them being so encouraging in their nature that Ned
1793,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"Harrington, out of sheer compassion, changed the conversation."
1794,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1795,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Well, my boy,"" said Ned, when the ladies had all retired for the night,"
1796,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""you shan't go to bed till the witching hour is past;"" so he kept me"
1797,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"chatting over old times, till the clock had gone one--the big old"
1798,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"turret-clock, whose notes flew booming away upon the frosty air."
1799,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Christmas-eve to-morrow, so we'll have a tramp on the moors after the"
1800,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"wild ducks--plenty out here.  I say, my boy, I believe this is the"
1801,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"original Moated Grange, so don't be alarmed if you hear the mice."""
1802,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1803,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""There's only one thing I care for,"" I said, ""and that is anything in"
1804,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the shape of a practical joke."""
1805,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1806,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Honour bright! my boy,"" said Ned; ""you need fear nothing of that kind;"""
1807,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and then I was alone in the Haunted Chamber, having locked myself in."
1808,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1809,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"My first proceeding was to give the large fire an extra poke, which sent"
1810,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"a flood of light across the room, and the flames gushing up the chimney;"
1811,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"my next, to take one of the candles and make a tour of my bedroom,"
1812,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"during which I looked under the bed, behind the curtains, and into"
1813,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"armoire and cupboard, but discovered nothing.  Next thing I tried the"
1814,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"windows, through which I could just dimly see the snow-white country,"
1815,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"but they were fast and blackened with dirt.  The chimney-glass, too, was"
1816,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"so injured by damp, that the dim reflection given back was something"
1817,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"startling, being more like a bad photograph of life-size than anything"
1818,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"else; and at length, having fully made up my mind that I was alone, and"
1819,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"that, as far as I could make out, there were neither trap-doors nor"
1820,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"secret passages in the wall, I undressed, put out the candles, and"
1821,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,plunged into bed.
1822,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1823,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But I was wrong in what I had said to my host about sleeping, for I"
1824,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,never felt more wakeful in my life.  I watched the blaze of the fire
1825,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"sink down to a ruddy glow, the glow turn blacker and blacker till at"
1826,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"last the fire was all but extinct, while the room was dark as could be."
1827,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But my eyesight was painfully acute, while my hearing seemed strained to"
1828,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,catch the slightest passing sound.  The wind roared and rumbled in the
1829,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"great chimney, and swept sighing past the windows; and, though it had a"
1830,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"strange, wild sound with it, yet I had heard the wind before, and"
1831,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,therefore paid but little heed to its moans.
1832,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1833,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"All at once the fire seemed to fall together with a tinkling sound, a"
1834,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"bright flame leaped up, illumining the room for a moment, then becoming"
1835,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"extinct, and leaving all in darkness; but there was light for a long"
1836,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"enough interval for me to see, or fancy I saw, the cupboard door open"
1837,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,and the great horseman's cloak stand out in a weird-like manner before
1838,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"me, as though covering the shoulders of some invisible figure."
1839,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1840,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"I felt warm--then hot--then in a profuse perspiration, but I told myself"
1841,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"it was fancy, punched my pillow, and turned over upon the other side to"
1842,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"sleep.  Now came a long, low, dreary moan, hollow and heartrending, for"
1843,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,it seemed like the cry of some one in distress; when I raised myself
1844,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,upon one elbow and listened.
1845,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1846,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Old cowl on a chimney,"" I muttered, letting myself fall back again, now"
1847,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"thoroughly determined to sleep, but the moaning continued, the wind"
1848,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"whistled and howled, while now came a gentle tap, tap, tapping at my"
1849,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"window, as if some one was signalling to be admitted."
1850,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1851,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Tap, tap, tap;"" still it kept on, as though whoever tapped was fearful"
1852,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of making too much noise; and at length, nerving myself, I slipped out"
1853,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of bed, crossed the room, and found that the closet door was open, but a"
1854,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,vigorous poke inside produced nothing but dust and two or three very
1855,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"sharp sneezes.  So I fastened the door, and listened.  All silent: but"
1856,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the next moment began the tapping upon the dirty window-pane again; and,"
1857,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"impelled by a mingled sensation of fear and attraction, I crept closer"
1858,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"to the sash, and at length made out the shadow of something tapping at"
1859,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,the glass.
1860,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1861,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Bah!  Bah!""  I exclaimed the next moment as I shuffled across the room"
1862,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and back to my bed, ""strand of ivy and the wind.""  But I was not to be"
1863,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"at peace yet, for now there came a most unmistakable noise behind the"
1864,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"wainscot--louder and louder, as if some one were trying to tear a piece"
1865,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,of the woodwork down.  The place chosen seemed to be the corner beside
1866,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the cupboard; and at last, having made up my mind that it was the rats,"
1867,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"I dropped off to sleep, and slept soundly till morning, when I heard the"
1868,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,cheery voice of my host at the door.
1869,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1870,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Oh, all right,"" he said as I answered; ""I only came because the girl"
1871,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"knocked, and said that something must be the matter, for she could not"
1872,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"make you hear."""
1873,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1874,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"On descending to breakfast, I found that I was to undergo a rigorous"
1875,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,cross-examination as to what I had seen and heard; but one elderly lady
1876,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"present shook her head ominously, freely giving it as her opinion that"
1877,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"it was little better than sacrilege to open the haunted chamber, and"
1878,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,finishing a very solemn peroration with the words--
1879,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1880,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Stop a bit; they don't walk every night."""
1881,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1882,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"This was encouraging, certainly; but in the course of the afternoon I"
1883,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"went up to my room, and found that it had been well cleaned out, while"
1884,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"many little modern appliances had been added to the dingy furniture, so"
1885,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,that it wore quite a brightened appearance.  The insides of the windows
1886,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"had been cleaned, and a man was then upon a ladder polishing away at the"
1887,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"exterior, when I drew his attention to a number of loose ivy strands,"
1888,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,which he cut off.
1889,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1890,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,In the cupboard I found plenty of traces of rats in the shape of
1891,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,long-gnawed-off fragments of wood pushed beneath the skirting-board;
1892,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"while, upon holding my head against the chimney, the groaning of the"
1893,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"cowl was plainly to be heard, as it swung round dolefully upon some"
1894,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,neighbouring chimney.
1895,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1896,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"A pleasant day was spent, and then, after a cosy evening, I was once"
1897,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"more ushered into the chamber of horrors, this time being escorted by"
1898,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the whole of the visitors, the gentlemen affectionately bidding me"
1899,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"farewell, but not one seeming disposed to accept my offer of changing"
1900,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"rooms.  However, Ned and Mrs Harrington both wished me to go to their"
1901,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"room, when I of course refused; and once more I was alone."
1902,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1903,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"It was now about half-past twelve and Christmas-morning, a regular storm"
1904,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"was hurrying round the house, and a strange feeling of crepitation came"
1905,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,upon me when I had extinguished the light; and then on climbing into bed
1906,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"I sat and listened for a while, laid my head upon my pillow, and the"
1907,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"next moment, or what seemed the next moment, I was startled by a strange"
1908,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"beating sound, and as I became aware of a dim, peculiar light,"
1909,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"penetrating the room, I heard a low, muffled voice cry appealingly--"
1910,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1911,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Your hot water, sir--quarter to eight!"" while I could hardly believe my"
1912,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,eyes had been closed.
1913,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1914,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"Christmas-day passed as it generally does in the country, that is to"
1915,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"say, in a most jovial, sociable way; and after fun, frolic, sport,"
1916,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"pastime, forfeit, dance, and cards, I stood once more within the haunted"
1917,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"chamber with the strange sensation upon me, that though I had met with"
1918,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"nothing so far to alarm me--this night, a night when, of all nights in"
1919,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the year, spirits might be expected to break loose, I was to suffer for"
1920,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,my temerity.
1921,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1922,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"As soon as I entered and secured the door, I felt that something was"
1923,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"wrong, but I roused up the fire, lit the wax candles upon the"
1924,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"dressing-table, and then looked round the room."
1925,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1926,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"Apparently I was alone, but upon opening the big closet door, the great"
1927,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"cloak fell down with a ghostly rustle, while a peculiar odour seemed to"
1928,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"rise from the heap.  The long, thin sword too, fell, with a strange"
1929,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"clanging noise as I hastily closed the door, and then setting down the"
1930,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"candle tried to compose myself to look at matters in a calm,"
1931,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"philosophical manner.  But things would not be looked at in that way,"
1932,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and now I began to feel that I was being punished for all, since the"
1933,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,next moment I could see the eyes of the large portrait between the
1934,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"windows gleam and roll, now showing the whites, now seeming to pierce"
1935,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"me, so intense was their gaze.  Then the figure seemed to be slowly"
1936,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"coming down from the frame nearer and nearer, till it was close to me,"
1937,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"when it slowly receded, and a shade passed over the canvas, so that it"
1938,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,was gone.
1939,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1940,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But for shame and the fear of ridicule, I should have opened the door"
1941,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and cried for aid; in fact, I believe I did rise from the chair and try"
1942,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"to reach the door, but some invisible power drew me into a corner of the"
1943,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"room, where I leaned panting against the wall to gaze upon a fresh"
1944,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"phenomenon.  I had brought a chamber candlestick into the room, and"
1945,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"after igniting the pair of candles upon the toilet table, placed the"
1946,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"flat candlestick between them, and left it alight, but now--no--yes--I"
1947,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,rubbed my eyes--there was no mistake.
1948,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1949,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,_There were six candles burning_.
1950,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1951,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"I started, shook myself, muttering that it was deception; but no, there"
1952,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"burned six candles, while their flames were big and blurred with a"
1953,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"large, ghastly, blue halo round each, that had a strange weird light;"
1954,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,and now I tried to recall what I had read in old ghost stories about
1955,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"corpse candles, for I felt that these three must be of that character."
1956,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1957,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,In an agony of fear I tried to run up to the dressing-table to dash the
1958,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"weird lights over, but again the same strange influence guided my steps,"
1959,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"so that I curved off to the bed, where I sat down, trembling in every"
1960,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,limb--limbs that refused their office--while I gazed upon the candles
1961,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"which now began to float backwards and forwards before me, till I could"
1962,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"bear the strange sight no more, and throwing myself back, I buried my"
1963,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,face in the bed.
1964,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1965,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"But there was no relief here, for as I threw myself down at full length,"
1966,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the great bedstead gave a crack, a rattle, and a bound, and then in an"
1967,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"agony of dread I was clinging to the bedding, for the huge structure"
1968,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,began to rise slowly higher--higher--higher--sailing away apparently
1969,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"upon the wings of the wind, and then again sinking lower and lower and"
1970,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"lower to interminable depths, so that I involuntarily groaned and closed"
1971,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"my eyes.  But that was of no avail, for I could feel the great bedstead"
1972,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"career, now on one side, now on the other, and ever going onward through"
1973,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,space like some vessel upon a vast aerial sea.
1974,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1975,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"The rapid gliding upward, in spite of the dread, seemed attended with"
1976,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,somewhat of an exhilarating effect; but the falling was hideous in the
1977,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"extreme--for now it was slowly and gently, but the next moment the speed"
1978,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"was fearful, and I lay trembling in expectation of feeling the structure"
1979,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"dash upon the ground, while every time I unclosed my eyes I could see"
1980,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"the gyrating candles, and turned giddy with confusion."
1981,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1982,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"And now, with one tremendously swift gliding swoop, away we went, faster"
1983,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and faster, more rapidly than swallows upon the wing.  Space seemed"
1984,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"obliterated; and, by the rushing noise and singing in my ears, I could"
1985,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,feel that the bedstead was careering on where the atmosphere was growing
1986,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"more and more attenuated, while soon, from the catching of my breath, I"
1987,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,felt sure that we should soon be beyond air altogether.  The candles
1988,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"were gone, but there were stars innumerable, past which we sped with"
1989,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"inconceivable rapidity, so that their light seemed continued in one long"
1990,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"luminous streak, while ever more and more the speed was increasing, till"
1991,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"it seemed that we were attached to some mighty cord, and being whirled"
1992,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"round and round with frightful velocity, as if at the end of the string;"
1993,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and now I trembled for the moment when the cord should be loosed, and we"
1994,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"should fly off into illimitable space, to go on--on--on for ever!"
1995,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
1996,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"At last it came, and away I went; but now separated from the bedstead,"
1997,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"to which I had clung to the last.  On--on--on, with something large and"
1998,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"undefined in front of me, which I felt that I should strike, though I"
1999,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"was powerless to prevent the collision.  Nearer--nearer--nearer, but"
2000,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"ever darting along like a shooting-star in its course, I was swept on,"
2001,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"till, with a fearful crash, I struck what I now found to be the lost"
2002,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"bed, and tried to cling to it once more; but, no!  I rolled off, and"
2003,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"fell slowly and gradually lower--lower, and evidently out of the sphere"
2004,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of the former attraction, so that at last I fell, with only a moderate"
2005,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"bump, upon the floor, when, hastily rising, I found all totally dark,"
2006,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"and that the bedpost was beside me; when, shudderingly dragging off some"
2007,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"of the clothes on to the carpet, I rolled myself in them, and went off"
2008,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,into a heavy sleep.
2009,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2010,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,The next morning several of my friends made remarks upon my pale and
2011,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"anxious looks; and soon after breakfast, Ned beckoned me into his study,"
2012,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,and begged of me to tell him whether I had been disturbed.
2013,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2014,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,For a few minutes I felt that I could not tell of the horrors of the
2015,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"past night, even though I had vowed to sleep in the haunted room still;"
2016,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"but at last I began my recital, and had arrived at the point where the"
2017,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"bedstead set sail, when Ned jumped up, crying:"
2018,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2019,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Why, I thought from your looks that you really had been disturbed.  But"
2020,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"I say, old boy, I suppose we must look over it, as it's Christmas; but,"
2021,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"do you know, judging by my own feelings, I think I'd better make the"
2022,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"punch rather less potent to-night."""
2023,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2024,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Well, really,"" I said, ""I think so too."""
2025,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2026,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Do you?"" said Ned."
2027,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,
2028,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,"""Oh, yes,"" I said, ""for my head aches awfully;"" and no wonder, seeing"
2029,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,how it had been Haunted by Spirits!
2030,HAUNTED BY SPIRITS.,

2033,CHAPTER SEVEN.,CHAPTER SEVEN.
2034,CHAPTER SEVEN.,
2035,ON THE DOWN LINE.,ON THE DOWN LINE.
2036,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2037,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"I couldn't stop indoors, for I couldn't bear to see them all.  The"
2038,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"children didn't seem to mind it so much, for they ran about and played,"
2039,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and their little hearts were light; but there was some one sitting by
2040,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the wretched little fire, looking that pale and worn and miserable, that"
2041,ON THE DOWN LINE.,it went quite to one's heart.
2042,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2043,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Christmas-morning, with the bright sun shining in through the dirty"
2044,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"windows, while from everywhere the rays went flashing as they lighted"
2045,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"upon the frost, rime, or snow.  Such of the blue sky as we could see"
2046,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"from our court, was as bright and clear a blue as could be seen out in"
2047,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the country, while the pavement looked dry, and you could hear the snow"
2048,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"crunch under the people's feet.  But there was no brightness with us,"
2049,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and at last I went out, for I couldn't stop indoors."
2050,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2051,ON THE DOWN LINE.,Was it my fault?  I kept asking myself; had I tried hard enough to get
2052,ON THE DOWN LINE.,took on again; or ought we to have been more saving when I had a
2053,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"situation?  Ah!  I asked myself all this again and again as I went out,"
2054,ON THE DOWN LINE.,leaving them at home in a regular state of beggary; for we had come down
2055,ON THE DOWN LINE.,to the last shilling.
2056,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2057,ON THE DOWN LINE.,I've always noticed as poor men keep their hands in their pockets; and I
2058,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"did mine that sharp, cold morning, and went sauntering along the"
2059,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"streets, wondering what it would all come to, and how we were to manage."
2060,ON THE DOWN LINE.,There was every one I met looking cheerful and bright; here and there
2061,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"shops a little way open, just as if they were winking at you, because"
2062,ON THE DOWN LINE.,they were so full of all sorts of good things; people were going in and
2063,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"coming out with loaded baskets; while, when I got near the baker's, it"
2064,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"was enough to make a hungry man savage to see the stream of people, with"
2065,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"their happy, jolly faces, bearing in geese, turkeys, and great fat"
2066,ON THE DOWN LINE.,mottled pieces of beef; and all looking as though there wasn't such a
2067,ON THE DOWN LINE.,thing as poverty.
2068,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2069,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Everybody seemed in a hurry, and every face seemed twinkling and bright"
2070,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"with the thoughts of good things to come, till at last, from feeling low"
2071,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and miserable, I got to be reckless and savage, and felt as if I should"
2072,ON THE DOWN LINE.,have liked to have had it out with the world there on the spot.
2073,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2074,ON THE DOWN LINE.,Every one you met in the big streets was like nature that morning--
2075,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"dressed in the best clothes; some bound for church, some out visiting;"
2076,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and do what I would, I couldn't find one face that looked miserable."
2077,ON THE DOWN LINE.,There were the cabs and carriages rattling along; 'buses loaded; the
2078,ON THE DOWN LINE.,bells ringing merrily; while there seemed to be a something in the air
2079,ON THE DOWN LINE.,that made you feel bright in spite of yourself; and after being savage
2080,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"for an hour and a half, I seemed to catch the infection from the people"
2081,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"about, and more than once I caught myself going to whistle."
2082,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2083,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"But the thoughts of what I'd left at home made me stop short, with my"
2084,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"face all screwed up, and from going to one extreme I got to another; and"
2085,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"at last, ready to break down, I found myself sitting on the"
2086,ON THE DOWN LINE.,stone-setting of the railings of one of the West End churches.
2087,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2088,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Beadle comes out after a bit and has a look at me, as much as to say,"
2089,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Are you a beggar, or ain't you?"" but he never says nothing; and after a"
2090,ON THE DOWN LINE.,bit he goes in again.  Policeman comes by beating his white gloves
2091,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"together, and he looks very suspiciously at me, as if he couldn't quite"
2092,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"make up his mind; and then he goes on, and says nothing.  And there I"
2093,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"sat in the cold, feeling nothing but the misery gripping at my heart,"
2094,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and at last, seeing nothing but a pale worn face in a bare room, where a"
2095,ON THE DOWN LINE.,troop of hungry children were wanting bread.
2096,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2097,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Sounds strange that, and some may think it stretched.  But let them"
2098,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"climb some of the dirty stairs at the East end, and they can find such"
2099,ON THE DOWN LINE.,sights any day and every day.
2100,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2101,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"No; I could see nothing then, but the place we called home; and I might"
2102,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"have sat there till I froze, if all at once something that seemed almost"
2103,ON THE DOWN LINE.,like a vision had not come before me; for as I sat there with my head
2104,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"upon my hands, there came a light touch, and looking up, there stood a"
2105,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"little bright-eyed, golden-haired child before me, her beautiful cheeks"
2106,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"ruddy with the keen air, while a tiny bright tear was in each eye, as"
2107,ON THE DOWN LINE.,with a pitying look she pushed a penny into my hand; when I was so
2108,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"utterly took aback, that her bright scarlet cloak was some distance off"
2109,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"as she tripped along beside a tall stately lady, before I could recover"
2110,ON THE DOWN LINE.,myself.
2111,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2112,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"That did it.  It seemed to bear down pride, anger, everything, and"
2113,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"taking me so suddenly, I couldn't bear it, but there in that open street"
2114,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"my head went down again upon my hands, and in the hopeless misery of my"
2115,ON THE DOWN LINE.,heart I cried like a child.
2116,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2117,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"But only for a minute, when I jumped up and hurried along the street, to"
2118,ON THE DOWN LINE.,catch one more sight of the bright pitying little angel; but she was
2119,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"gone, and at last, making sure that she had gone into one of the houses,"
2120,ON THE DOWN LINE.,I walked slowly back to the churchyard.
2121,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2122,ON THE DOWN LINE.,When I got there the people were beginning to come out of the big
2123,ON THE DOWN LINE.,church: carriages were drawing up; from out of the open doors there came
2124,ON THE DOWN LINE.,the rolling sound of the organ; and as I stood there against the
2125,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"railings, watching the happy-looking crowd, it seemed to me that I must"
2126,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"be a sort of impostor, for to see how folks were dressed there couldn't"
2127,ON THE DOWN LINE.,be such a thing as misery in the world.
2128,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2129,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"All at once I started, and took hold of the railing, for I heard a voice"
2130,ON THE DOWN LINE.,that put me in mind of the time when I was started from the Great
2131,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Central line.  Just in front of me, and coming towards a carriage that a"
2132,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"lad held open, were a lady and gentleman dressed tip-top, and he was"
2133,ON THE DOWN LINE.,laughing and chatting to her.  But I only just saw that she was very
2134,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"handsome, for I was watching the gentleman's eyes--bright, piercing blue"
2135,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"eyes, such as you seldom see; and in a regular state of muddle in my own"
2136,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"mind, and wondering about where those eyes had come across me before, I"
2137,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"leaned forward right in the way, staring fixed-like at him."
2138,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2139,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Stand back, my good fellow,"" he says, and then, just as the lady"
2140,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"lightly stepped into the carriage, he stops short, fixes those eyes of"
2141,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"his on to mine, and then, with his hand playing with his big brown"
2142,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"moustache, he burst out laughing, when I knew him in a moment.  It _was_"
2143,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"him; and as I thought of the misery of the past year that he had caused,"
2144,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"something seemed to rise up in me, and for a moment I felt as if I could"
2145,ON THE DOWN LINE.,have knocked him down.  But the clenching of my fist made me feel that
2146,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"penny, and that brought up another face, when turning dejected once"
2147,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"more, I turned aside, saying--"
2148,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2149,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Ah! it's fun for you, but pretty nigh death for me;"" but before I'd got"
2150,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"two steps off, he had his hand on my shabby blackened moleskin jacket,"
2151,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and he says--
2152,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2153,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Gently, my friend, I must introduce you;"" and before I knew what he was"
2154,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"about, he had me at the door of the carriage, and he says--""Look,"
2155,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Marian, here's our honest charioteer, the Vulcan who drove us down to"
2156,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Moreton;"" and then he whispered something that made the lady smile, and"
2157,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"a bright colour come all over her handsome face.  ""Do you drive the mail"
2158,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"now?"" he says, turning to me."
2159,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2160,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""_Never_ touched a handle since, sir,"" I says.  ""They had me afore the"
2161,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"board two mornings after, and discharged me.""  And then the thoughts of"
2162,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"it all seemed too much for me, and I turned husky and choky, and"
2163,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"couldn't speak for a minute, when I says, with a sort of gulp:--"
2164,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2165,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Can't help it, sir; I've been werry hard drove since--wife--children--"""
2166,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and then I choked again as I shunted off what I was saying.
2167,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2168,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Stand back a bit,"" says the gentleman to his servant, and then, in so"
2169,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"kind and gentle a way, he says to me--""Why, my poor fellow, I wouldn't"
2170,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"have had this happen on any account;"" and then I saw a tear or two in"
2171,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"his lady's beautiful eyes, and they both stopped talking to me a good"
2172,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"quarter of an hour, free as could be, telling me that they had me to"
2173,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"thank for much happiness, as theirs was a runaway match.  And at last,"
2174,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"when they drove off, nodding and smiling at me, I had the gentleman's"
2175,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"card, so as to call on him next morning, when he said his father, being"
2176,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"a railway director, I should be took on the line at once; and, what was"
2177,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"more to the purpose then, there were five sovereigns in my hand."
2178,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2179,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"I didn't know what to do, whether to laugh or cry; and I'm sure I must"
2180,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"have looked like a madman as I tore through the streets, and rushed"
2181,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"upstairs into our room, when the first thing I did was to scrape up"
2182,ON THE DOWN LINE.,every bit of coal at the bottom of the cupboard and put it a-top of the
2183,ON THE DOWN LINE.,fire.
2184,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2185,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Lay the cloth, my lass,"" I says, seizing a dish; ""and, Lord bless you,"
2186,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"look alive!""  The children stared, and then laughed and clapped their"
2187,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"hands, while I rushed out to the cook's shop in the lane, looking like a"
2188,ON THE DOWN LINE.,wolf.
2189,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2190,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"There was a roast goose just up, and cissing away in the big pewter dish"
2191,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"all amongst the gravy, with the stuffing a smelling that rich, it was"
2192,ON THE DOWN LINE.,enough to drive you mad.
2193,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2194,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Just as I slipped into the door, the waiter--red-nosed chap--with a"
2195,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"dirty white wisp of a handkercher round his neck, looking like a seedy"
2196,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"undertaker--the waiter says: ""Two goose--apple sauce--and taters;"" and"
2197,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the master sticks his fork into the buzzum, and makes a cut as sent the"
2198,ON THE DOWN LINE.,stuffing all out of a gush.
2199,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2200,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Hold hard,"" I says, ""that's mine;"" and ketching hold of one leg, before"
2201,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"he knew what I was up to, it was on my dish.  ""Now then, ladle on that"
2202,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"gravy,"" I says, ""and let's have the setrers;"" and saying that, I dabs a"
2203,ON THE DOWN LINE.,sovrin down on the edge of the pewter.
2204,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2205,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"I think they were going to send out for a policeman, but the sight of"
2206,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"that little bit of metal settled it, and five minutes after I was"
2207,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"carrying the change--not much of it neither--the goose under a cover,"
2208,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and the waiter following behind with a tray, with vegetables, sauce, and"
2209,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"aside the great wedge of pudding, a pot of half-and-half."
2210,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2211,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"When the waiter had gone out of the room, and the little ones were"
2212,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"hooraying and tapping with their knives, I got to the top of the table,"
2213,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the wife went to the bottom, and I began to say grace, when our eyes"
2214,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"met, she ran to me, and then for a good ten minutes she was a sobbing in"
2215,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"my arms; while I--there; that's private, and I think I've confessed"
2216,ON THE DOWN LINE.,enough.
2217,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2218,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"There; I don't care whose it was, or where it was, all I know is this,"
2219,ON THE DOWN LINE.,that there wasn't such a dinner eaten or enjoyed anywhere that day
2220,ON THE DOWN LINE.,throughout the length and breadth of our old country; and though
2221,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"sometimes it was hard to see where I stuck the fork, or cut with the"
2222,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"knife, I was smiling all the time.  As for the wife, she would keep"
2223,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"breaking down till I shouted at her, when she went at it and helped me"
2224,ON THE DOWN LINE.,keep the young ones going; and at last of all I'd have taken a shilling
2225,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"for what was left of the goose, and whoever bought it wouldn't have been"
2226,ON THE DOWN LINE.,the best off in the bargain.
2227,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2228,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"The very next week I was took on the London, Highshare, and Ploughshare"
2229,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"railway, and that through the gent who got me discharged from the Great"
2230,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Central, which happened this way."
2231,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2232,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"The Christmas-Eve afore what I've told you was one of those yaller,"
2233,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"smoky, foggy times, when trains are all later than they should be, even"
2234,ON THE DOWN LINE.,worse than might be expected at Christmas-time.  The lamps were burning
2235,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"in the booking offices all day, while the steam hung like a cloud in the"
2236,ON THE DOWN LINE.,roof of the terminus.  I was sitting in the engine-shed on our horse--
2237,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"steam-horse you know--waiting to run the mail down to the north, when"
2238,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Ben Davis, my stoker, says:"
2239,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2240,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""There they goes again, `bang, bang,' I wonder what it's cost the"
2241,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"company to-day in fog signals;"" and then as I didn't say nothing, he"
2242,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"says, ""Ah! this is just such a night as it was four years agone, when"
2243,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"poor Tom Harris was cut up the night afore the pitch in,""--smash you"
2244,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"know.  ""Poor Tom; he knowed it was a-comin' to that, and he told me all"
2245,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"about it; for I stoked him."""
2246,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2247,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Just then time was up, and all hot and hissing, I runs out to the"
2248,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"switches, and comes back on to the down line, where we were coupled on"
2249,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"to the train, when Ben goes on: ""Poor chap; he'd been outer sorts for"
2250,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"some time, and I do think he took more than he should; but one way and"
2251,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"another, he was horribly low-spirited, and would quite upset you with"
2252,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the way he'd talk.  The last night as I stoked him, he got telling me"
2253,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"his reg'lar tale, about a run down he had, and one as he had never"
2254,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"forgotten about, being on full swing in a terribly dark foggy night, he"
2255,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"heard a whistle, and looking back he could see a train coming on at an"
2256,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"awful rate just behind him, when of course he put on more steam.  But"
2257,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"that didn't seem no good; for coming round the curve, he could see the"
2258,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"train closing up fast; and at last, when half mad with fear, and ready"
2259,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"to jump off, he saw that the train was on the up line, and the next"
2260,ON THE DOWN LINE.,minute it was alongside his; and there they two were racing abreast of
2261,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"each other; when he slackened, the other slackened; and when he did"
2262,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"t'other, they did t'other.  Same length train; same size engine; same"
2263,ON THE DOWN LINE.,lights; and fire door open like his; so that he could see the driver's
2264,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"face; and he says, says he, `I nearly dropped; for it was me as was"
2265,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"driving that 'tother train.'  On they goes together into the tunnel, and"
2266,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"out they goes together.  When he looked back, there was all the"
2267,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"carriages lit up, and all just as if it was his own train; but whistling"
2268,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"at the short stations when he did, and keeping an exactly same pace.  It"
2269,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"was like being in a cloud, the fog was so heavy; while the steam from"
2270,ON THE DOWN LINE.,both funnels mixed together.
2271,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2272,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""It was Christmas-eve, just like this; and yet cold as it was, he said,"
2273,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"poor chap, the water dripped from his face as they rushed on.  He knew"
2274,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"it couldn't last long, for there'd be an up-train directly, and then"
2275,ON THE DOWN LINE.,there must be a fearful smash; but yet something seemed to tell him as
2276,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"there wouldn't; and watching as they went by station after station, he"
2277,ON THE DOWN LINE.,stood trembling at his post.  All at once he could see the up-train
2278,ON THE DOWN LINE.,coming; and then he put on a spurt so as to be ahead when the smash
2279,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"came; but that was no use, for the train kept aside his, and then all at"
2280,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"once there was a shriek, and a rush, and the up-train was right behind;"
2281,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"while along side his, there was that same engine just in the same place,"
2282,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and him a-driving it.  Poor Tom used to make me creep when he told that
2283,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"tale, and he didn't live long arter; for one night there was something"
2284,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"wrong in front of our engine, when he wouldn't wait till we stopped, but"
2285,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"got along as we were going, and when I was expecting him to come back,"
2286,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and looked--for I'd been putting on more coal--there was some blood
2287,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"splashed all about the screen, and when I stopped and run back, there"
2288,ON THE DOWN LINE.,was poor Tom lying all to bits in the six foot.  And they do say as he's
2289,ON THE DOWN LINE.,been seen by some of the chaps a running a ghost engine along the line
2290,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"at express rate, sometimes one line, and sometimes the other; and when"
2291,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"he meets another train, there's a whistle and shriek, and he's gone."""
2292,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2293,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""That's werry pretty,"" I says.  ""I'd have that put in a book, if I was"
2294,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"you;"" and just then there was a bit of door banging, the second bell"
2295,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"rang, the guard's whistle chirrupped, and then with a scream we started,"
2296,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"the steam puffing out of the funnel in round white balls, and slowly"
2297,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"spreading overhead till it came faster, and hanging over us like a plume"
2298,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"of white feathers, it streamed back over the train."
2299,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2300,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Such a night: thick as thick; and every now and then it was ""bang, bang"""
2301,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"as we went over the fog signals, and had to pull up and go very slowly,"
2302,ON THE DOWN LINE.,so that we were a good ten minutes going the first half-mile; and then
2303,ON THE DOWN LINE.,past the first short station we went very slowly.
2304,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2305,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Thirty-five miles down was our first stoppage, where we took in water,"
2306,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and then another forty took us to Moreton, which was our next stoppage."
2307,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"By degrees we got on faster and faster, but the darkness was something"
2308,ON THE DOWN LINE.,terrible; while the signal lights at the short stations were almost
2309,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"useless, for I couldn't see them till we were close up, so being already"
2310,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"very late through its being Christmas-time I pushed her along, trusting"
2311,ON THE DOWN LINE.,to the line being all clear.
2312,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2313,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Ah!"" says Ben all at once, ""we're jest a-coming to the spot where poor"
2314,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Tom was cut up.  Poor old chap,"" he says; ""and it was just here as he"
2315,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"first saw that train running by his side."""
2316,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2317,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Now, of course, I knew well enough that it was all gammon; but Ben"
2318,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"talked so serious that it give me quite a shiver, and as we came"
2319,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"suddenly upon the lights of a station, and raced through, my heart gave"
2320,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"a jump, for it almost seemed as if a train was aside us; and even after"
2321,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"passing the station, I looked out, for there was the train lights"
2322,ON THE DOWN LINE.,reflected on the fog on each side; but directly after I laughed at
2323,ON THE DOWN LINE.,myself.
2324,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2325,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""It was just about here as he must have gone down,"" says Ben to me--"
2326,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"shouting in my ear, for we were going fast; ""and they do say as"
2327,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"sometimes he mounts an engine and--_Yah-h-h_!"" cried the poor fellow,"
2328,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"falling down upon his hands and knees; while regularly took aback, I"
2329,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"shrunk trembling up in the corner of the screen, and there stopped"
2330,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"staring at a horrible looking figure, as seemed to start all at once"
2331,ON THE DOWN LINE.,into the light just as if he'd rose out of the coals.  And then he came
2332,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"right up to me, for poor Ben had fainted."
2333,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2334,ON THE DOWN LINE.,As we were staring at one another I could see as the figure was buttoned
2335,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"up in an oilskin coat, while a close fur cap covered its head, and a"
2336,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"handkercher was round the lower part of the face, so that I could see"
2337,ON THE DOWN LINE.,nothing but a pair of fierce bright eyes; and there it stood with one
2338,ON THE DOWN LINE.,hand holding the side of the screen.
2339,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2340,ON THE DOWN LINE.,As long as I kept quiet it never moved; but directly I tried to get to
2341,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"my place it motioned me back.  At last, half-desperate, I faced it; for"
2342,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"a bit of thinking told me it must be a man, though Ben's story had a bit"
2343,ON THE DOWN LINE.,upset me.
2344,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2345,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Here's Richford close here,"" I shouts, ""where we stops;"" but in a"
2346,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"moment I saw the barrel of a pistol flashing in the light of the fire,"
2347,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and then I shrunk back again into the corner.  If he would only have
2348,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"turned his back for a moment I should have pinned him, but he only"
2349,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"glanced round once, when Ben shuffled back into the far corner of the"
2350,ON THE DOWN LINE.,tender; and there we were five minutes after rushing through Richford at
2351,ON THE DOWN LINE.,full speed.
2352,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2353,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Now,"" he says, leaning down to me, ""rouse up, and push on faster; and"
2354,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"don't you dare to stop till we get to Moreton:"" and when a man says this"
2355,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"to you with a pistol in his hand, why, what else can you do but mind."
2356,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2357,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Now,"" thinks I, ""this is a pretty go;"" and then I kicks up Ben to come"
2358,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and stoke; but he wouldn't move, and what wanted doing I had to do"
2359,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"myself; and so we raced on, for he made me put on more steam, seeing"
2360,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"through my dodge in a moment, when I slackened instead; and on we went,"
2361,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"with the night seeming to grow darker every moment.  But it was race on,"
2362,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"past station after station like a flash; and, one way and another, I"
2363,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"began to grow excited.  The guard had been letting go at the gong, but"
2364,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"of course I could take no notice; no doubt, too, he had screwed down his"
2365,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"break, but that seemed to make very little difference, with the metals"
2366,ON THE DOWN LINE.,in such a greasy state with the heavy frosty mist; and we raced along at
2367,ON THE DOWN LINE.,such a rate as I've never been at since.

2369,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"More than once, I made sure we should be crash into the tail of some"
2370,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"goods-train; but though we passed several coming up, nothing was in our"
2371,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"way, and at last, after the wildest ride I ever had, we began to get"
2372,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"near Moreton, just as the water was beginning to get low.  ""And now,"" he"
2373,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"says, fiercely, ""draw up just this side of the station;"" and I nodded:"
2374,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"but, for all that, I meant to have run right in, but he was too quick"
2375,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"for me, and screwed down the brake so that we stopped a good fifty yards"
2376,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"short of the platform, when he leaped down, and I was going to follow,"
2377,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"but a rough voice said, ""Stand back,"" and I could see some one in front"
2378,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"of me; while, by the lights of the train, I just saw a carriage next the"
2379,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"tender opened, and some one hurried off to where a couple of lights were"
2380,ON THE DOWN LINE.,shining; and I could hear horses stamping; and then--it all didn't take
2381,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"a minute--there was the trampling of hoofs and the rolling of wheels,"
2382,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and the man who stopped me from getting down was gone.
2383,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2384,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"""Get up,"" I says to Ben, as we run into the station; ""it warn't a"
2385,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"ghost:"" but Ben seemed anything but sure on that point.  While, as we"
2386,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"finished our journey that night, I put that and that together, and made"
2387,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"out as this chap, who must have been a plucky fellow, got from the next"
2388,ON THE DOWN LINE.,carriage on to the tender while we were crawling through the fog just
2389,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"outside London; and all to prevent stopping at Richford, where, no"
2390,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"doubt, somebody had telegraphed for him to be taken; while, though the"
2391,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"message would perhaps be repeated to Moreton, it was not sure to be so,"
2392,ON THE DOWN LINE.,and his dodge of stopping short where a conveyance was in waiting made
2393,ON THE DOWN LINE.,that all right.
2394,ON THE DOWN LINE.,
2395,ON THE DOWN LINE.,I drove the up-mail next day to town; but that was my last on the Great
2396,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"Central, for, when summoned before the Board, it was pay off, and go;"
2397,ON THE DOWN LINE.,"and that, too, without a character."

2408,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well say away,"" I said very drowsily."
2409,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2410,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well, dear,"" said Mrs Scribe, ""You see mamma's coming."""
2411,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2412,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Sorry to hear it,"" I said in an undertone."
2413,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2414,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""For shame,"" said Mrs S.  ""How can you talk in that way, when you know"
2415,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"what interest she takes in you, and how she praises all you write.  No,"
2416,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"now, it isn't gammon, as you so politely call it.  Well, and if she did"
2417,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"say you always introduced `the wife,' or `the missus,' so often, what"
2418,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"then?  You would not have her flatter you, and say what she didn't mean,"
2419,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"would you now, dear?"""
2420,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2421,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I couldn't help it, for the wind was easterly and I was very tired, so I"
2422,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"only said, ""Bother!""  But there, I dare not commit to paper all that was"
2423,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,said to me upon the subject.  A word or two will suffice upon a matter
2424,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,familiar to every Benedict.
2425,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2426,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Ah, sir,"" said Mrs S, ""you did not say `bother' after that walk when"
2427,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"we gathered cowslips, and I gave you leave to speak to mamma.  What did"

2434,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""There, for goodness sake, don't be casting all one's follies in one's"

2446,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Now don't be so stupid and tiresome, dear, but just listen.  Now, Mrs"

2449,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2450,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Pick up,"" I said, ""why they won't let you have anything unless you pay"

2452,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2453,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Dear me, how exceedingly witty,"" said Mrs S.  ""Have you quite"
2454,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"finished, sir?"""
2455,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2456,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I felt scorched, so held my tongue, and submitted to the scolding."

2459,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"vegetable-dish covers are all broken but one, and that has no handle;"
2460,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,the soup tureen has a great piece out of the side; there are only five
2461,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"soup plates left, while as to the dinner plates, they are that cracked"

2463,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2464,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""If you want a new service, why don't you say so, and not go dodging"

2469,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Parabola was so proud of, and we must have a fresh carpet in the"
2470,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dining-room, for ours is perfectly disgraceful.  What? people come to"
2471,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"see us and not our carpets?  Well I suppose they do, but we need not"
2472,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"disgrace them by making believe to be so poor.  And let's see, there's a"
2473,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"very pretty china tea-service that I certainly would get, dear, and a"
2474,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"few of those damask table-cloths and napkins."""
2475,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2476,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""`Those damask table-cloths and napkins?'""  I said.  ""Why, how the"
2477,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dickens do you know anything about them?"""
2478,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2479,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Why, I went to see, of course, and the auctioneer's men were very civil"
2480,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"and let us go over the house."""
2481,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2482,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Humph,"" I said.  ""Anything else you would like?""  When if she did not"
2483,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"keep on talk, talk, talk for a good hour about the odds and ends, as she"
2484,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"called them, that it would be advantageous to buy."
2485,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2486,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Now, it so happened that when I married I thought I had properly"
2487,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,furnished my house; but year after year I have gone on finding out that
2488,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"this was a complete mistake, while now, at the end of some thirteen"
2489,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"years, it seems to me to be as far from perfect as ever.  But here, in"
2490,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"this case, as Mrs Scribe's mamma was coming down to spend Christmas, I"
2491,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"could of course say nothing, so after faithfully promising that I would"
2492,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"visit Mrs Parabola's during the three days' sale, I was allowed to go"
2493,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,to sleep.
2494,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2495,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Going to the sale, Retort?""  I said the next day to a friend."
2496,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2497,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well, no,"" was the stammered reply; ""I never buy at sales."""
2498,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2499,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Never mind, walk there with me.""  Mr Retort consented, and we strolled"
2500,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"on together to where a gaily-patterned hearthrug hung out of a window,"
2501,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,bearing one of the auctioneer's bills.  Men were hanging about with
2502,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"porters' knots, and mostly wearing head coverings composed of Brussels"
2503,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"carpet; Abram was there, Isaac was there, Jacob was there, and the whole"
2504,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"of the twelve patriarchs, all looking hook-nosed, unctuous, unsoaped,"
2505,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"and evidently revelling in the idea of what a glorious ""knock out"" there"
2506,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,would be after the sale.  The dining-room was set apart for selling
2507,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"purposes; the long table stood, with all the leaves in, while its"
2508,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,telescopic principle was so put to it that in places it was quite out of
2509,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"focus, and the leaves did not meet.  The ""elegantly-designed genuine"
2510,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Turkey carpet"" was ingeniously folded, so that all the worn parts were"
2511,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"hidden, and the brighter and unworn portions prominently spread out upon"
2512,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"the long table.  The scroll fender stood upon the chimney-piece, the"
2513,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"plated-ware upon the sideboard, while ranged along the walls were the"
2514,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"bureaus and wardrobes out of the bedrooms; at which innovation, or"
2515,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"rather intrusion, the large portraits upon the walls gazed down most"
2516,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,ferociously.
2517,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2518,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Porter, sir?"" said a man, touching his carpet-cap to Retort."
2519,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2520,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""No, thank you, my man,"" said my friend, politely, ""I never take beer."""
2521,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2522,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""No, sir, I mean to carry home what you buy,"" said the man."
2523,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2524,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Oh, dear me, no,"" said Retort, ""I never purchase at sales."""
2525,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2526,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"The man thrust a ribald tongue into his long lank cheek, while, at the"
2527,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"same moment I was earnestly examining the aforesaid Turkey carpet, and"
2528,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,wondering whether it would be an improvement upon the one in our own
2529,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"room, when a man, whose name must have been Isaacs or Moss,"
2530,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,insinuatingly offered me a catalogue.
2531,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2532,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Thank you,"" I said: ""I have one."""
2533,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2534,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Shouldn't recommend it, sir,"" said the new-comer.  ""The drawing-room"
2535,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"carpet would just suit you, for it by rights should have been laid in a"
2536,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dining-room."""
2537,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2538,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Thanks,"" I said, ""but don't let me detain you."""
2539,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2540,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"No detention in the least.  Mr Isaacs was a broker, and for the usual"
2541,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,trifling commission he could secure anything in the sale for me at a
2542,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,considerable reduction in the price I should have to give.
2543,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2544,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""For you see,"" said Mr Isaacs, see-sawing the edge of a leaf of the"
2545,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"catalogue between two of his excessively dirty teeth, ""if you attempt to"
2546,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,bid for yourself the brokers will consider that you are taking the bread
2547,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"out of their mouths, and combine against you, and run things up."
2548,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Couldn't secure a thing yourself, I assure you, sir."""
2549,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2550,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Isn't this a public auction?""  I said, in what was meant to be a"
2551,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,dignified way.
2552,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2553,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Oh, yes, of course,"" said Mr Isaacs; ""but you see, sir, these sort of"
2554,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,things are always managed for gentlemen by brokers.  Gentlemen never bid
2555,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"for themselves."""
2556,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2557,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I left Mr Isaacs under the impression that I was not a gentleman, since"
2558,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I fully intended to bid for myself, and steadfastly refused to pay"
2559,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,attention to the various eligible lots he kept introducing to my notice
2560,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"as I passed from room to room of the mansion, gradually getting better"
2561,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,filled with visitors bound on bargain-seeking errands.
2562,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2563,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Why, you'll pay dear enough for what you buy, depend upon it,"" said"
2564,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Retort.  ""What with brokers and buyers, I don't see much chance for"
2565,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"you."""
2566,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2567,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Perhaps not, but look here,"" I said.  ""This is how I manage: I get, say"
2568,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"in a corner, where I can just see the auctioneer's face, and then taking"
2569,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,care not to make much movement or to do anything that will take the
2570,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"enemy's attention, I give him a quiet nod for my bid each time, while"
2571,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"seeing that I am a buyer, he always looks out for my nods.  Don't you"
2572,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"see?"""
2573,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2574,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Just so,"" said Retort, ""a capital plan, no doubt."""
2575,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2576,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"The sale began, and having obtained a pretty good place, I bid for"
2577,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,several little things.  Two or three times over I saw that the brokering
2578,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"clique were running them up, but by a judicious bit of management I let"
2579,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"them run on, and then left my friends with the last bid, so that they"
2580,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,were quite satisfied and let me bid and buy as I liked.
2581,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2582,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I had secured, as the day wore on, several undoubted bargains, amongst"
2583,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,which was some of the damask linen which had taken Mrs Scribe's fancy;
2584,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"but the room was insufferably hot and stuffy, and evidently too much for"
2585,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"poor Retort, who disappeared."
2586,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2587,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"At length the dining-room Turkey carpet came on, and in spite of various"
2588,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"shabby parts, I made up my mind to have it for divers reasons, among"
2589,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"which I might enumerate its probably going for a song; secondly,"
2590,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"durability; thirdly, its eminent respectability, for no one could find"
2591,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,fault with a dining-room covered by a Turkey carpet.
2592,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2593,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Five pun',"" said one of the brokers, after the auctioneer's"
2594,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,introductory remarks.
2595,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2596,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,I nodded.
2597,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2598,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Five ten--five ten--six--six ten--seven--seven ten--eight ten--nine"
2599,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"ten.  Nine ten,"" said the auctioneer, drawing bid after bid from"
2600,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"different parts of the room, while, forgetting my nodding system in the"
2601,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"excitement of the moment, I stood confessed.  Now I had set ten pounds"
2602,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"down in my own mind as the price I would go to, and was rather surprised"
2603,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"to find how quickly it had reached to ""nine ten,"" as the auctioneer"
2604,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"termed it.  However, seeing that the carpet was pretty good, and my room"
2605,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"large, I thought I would go a little farther, for I must confess to"
2606,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,feeling a little spite against the party of Jews who now seemed to be
2607,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"running me up again.  So on went the bidding again, till it had reached"
2608,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,to fourteen pounds.
2609,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2610,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Let the gentleman have it,"" said Mr Isaacs, with a grin.  But, no,"
2611,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""fifteen pounds"" was bid from somewhere else--evidently by a"
2612,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,confederate.
2613,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2614,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Sixteen,"" I formed with my mouth."
2615,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2616,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Seventeen bid,"" cried the hammer-man."
2617,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2618,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""I will have it,"" I muttered, ""in spite of the scoundrels, for it would"
2619,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"cost twenty for a good Brussels, and there's no wear in them."""
2620,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2621,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Going at seventeen--seventeen--_sev-en-teen--sev-en-teen_.  Going at"
2622,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"seven-_teen_.  `Eighteen.'  I thank you, sir.  Eighteen--eighteen--"
2623,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"eighteen.  Nineteen is bid,"" said the auctioneer, while the Jews grinned"
2624,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,and chuckled.
2625,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2626,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Not half its vally yet, sir,"" cried Mr Isaacs.  ""Don't give it away,"
2627,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"sir.  Orter make fifty pun', at the least."""
2628,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2629,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Thou villainous Shylock,"" I muttered to myself, ""but I can afford a few"
2630,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"pounds sooner than be beaten."""
2631,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2632,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""This splendid Turkey carpet, fit for any nobleman's mansion, now stands"
2633,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"at nineteen pounds,"" cried the man in the rostrum.  ""Say another pound"
2634,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"for you, sir!"""
2635,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2636,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,I nodded.
2637,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2638,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Twenty pounds--twenty--twenty--guineas--twenty-one pound is offered."
2639,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"It's against you, sir, at twenty-one pounds."""
2640,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2641,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,I nodded again.
2642,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2643,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Twenty-two pounds,"" cried the auctioneer.  ""Twenty-two pounds.  Any"
2644,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"advance upon twenty-two pounds,"" he continued, amid much chuckling,"
2645,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"when, as there was no further reply to the challenges, I became the"
2646,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,fortunate owner of the carpet at double its worth.
2647,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2648,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Name,"" cried the auctioneer, and then catching my eye, he nodded, and"
2649,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,went on with the next lot.
2650,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2651,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""I'll keep out of sight again, I think,"" I muttered, and returned to my"
2652,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"corner, feeling very hot and bristly, as I determined to reopen the"
2653,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"knocking-out discussion in the morning papers, for it was evident that I"
2654,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,was the victim of a conspiracy.
2655,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2656,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"But I was warm in temper as well as body, and therefore determined not"
2657,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"to be driven away, so I purchased an elegant set of card and occasional"
2658,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,tables at about double their value; gave six pounds ten for the damaged
2659,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,dinner-service; seven pounds for the china; five guineas for a wool
2660,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"mattress, and found myself at last bidding twelve shillings an ounce for"
2661,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,some of the plate.
2662,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2663,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"The Jews seemed frantic with delight, but I knew all the while it was"
2664,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"only to conceal their anger and annoyance; and, though I kept carefully"
2665,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"out of sight, I knew the bolts and shafts of their coarse allusions were"
2666,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"being directed at me, while their hidden confederate on the opposite"
2667,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,side of the room bid furiously.  Once or twice I felt disposed to leave
2668,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"off, and let the high-priced lots be knocked down to the Israelitish"
2669,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"villain.  ""But no,"" I said, ""I'll have what I want in spite of them, and"
2670,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"cunning as they are;"" for the rascals kept sending their chaff flying at"
2671,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,their confederate as well.
2672,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2673,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""What a good job Retort has gone!""  I muttered; ""I shall never have the"
2674,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"face to tell anyone what I have given.""  And now, as it was fast getting"
2675,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dusk, and our Jewish friends were beginning to be sportive and indulge"
2676,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"in such little freaks of fancy as bonneting the porters, and"
2677,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,accidentally causing articles of furniture to fall against their
2678,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"fellows, all of which tended to make the confusion worse than before, I"
2679,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"left the auctioneer hurrying through the last of that day's lots, and"
2680,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"made the best of my way out; when, to my surprise, I found Retort in the"
2681,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,hall.
2682,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2683,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Ah, well met!""  I exclaimed, hurriedly following his example; and"
2684,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"thrusting my pencilled catalogue into my pocket, feeling very desirous"
2685,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,not to talk of the day's purchases until a little softened down by
2686,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dinner and a glass or two of sherry.  However, Retort did not seem at"
2687,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"all disposed to speak upon the subject; and, after a little pressing,"
2688,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,the touchy bachelor consented to dine with me and take pot luck.
2689,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2690,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"But pot luck that day was nothing to be grumbled at, for Mrs Scribe had"
2691,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"exerted herself to have everything snug, as she afterwards told me, in"
2692,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"consequence of my having been ""a good boy,"" and undertaken to get the"
2693,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,few things she wanted before mamma came down.  So pot luck that day
2694,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"consisted of some well-made ox-tail soup--not at all burnt--caught, as"
2695,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,our queen of the kitchen terms it--a nice flakey bit of crimped cod with
2696,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,oysters; boiled fowls and tongue; two species of kickshaws; Stilton and
2697,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"celery.  The bottled ale was good, the sherry pleasant, and Mrs S"
2698,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,amiability itself; so that by degrees the creature comforts acted like
2699,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,anodyne or unguent to my raw temper; and when my smiling partner left us
2700,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"over our wine, I leaped out of my chair, opened the door, and earned the"
2701,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,smile tendered for my acceptance.
2702,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2703,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Hem!"" said Retort, as soon as we were alone."
2704,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2705,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Come, fill your glass, Tom,"" I said; ""that's a capital glass of wine,"
2706,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,even if it isn't one of your wonderful vintages.  I call that Pantheon

2708,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2709,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Hum,"" said Retort very superciliously--""Gilbey's, eh?"""
2710,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2711,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Now, I do call that shabby,"" I said, ""to sneer at a fellow because he"
2712,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"frankly offers you a cheap glass, and isn't above owning to it.  Now, if"
2713,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"you had dined with old Blunkarn, he'd have given you a worse glass, and"
2714,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"vowed it was '20 port."""
2715,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2716,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""But how did you get on at the sale?"" said Retort hastily, so as to"
2717,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,change the subject.
2718,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2719,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Rascally!""  I exclaimed, firing up.  ""Those confounded Jews!"""
2720,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2721,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Wasn't it scandalous,"" said Retort."
2722,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2723,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""The most iniquitous affair I ever saw!""  I exclaimed."
2724,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2725,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""The scoundrels ought to be indicted for conspiracy,"" said my friend."
2726,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2727,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""_I'll_ show them up, my boy,"" I said.  ""I'll send columns to the papers"
2728,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"if they'll only put them in."""
2729,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2730,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Ah, do,"" said my companion.  ""Now, you see, I bid for a thing or two."""
2731,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2732,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""You,"" I said; ""why, what for?  Bachelor in lodgings?"""
2733,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2734,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well--er--er--yes,"" said Retort, stammering, ""er--er at present, you"
2735,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"know--at present."""
2736,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2737,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Why, you don't mean to say--"" I burst out."
2738,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2739,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Hush, my dear fellow! don't speak so loud."""
2740,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2741,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""That you've proposed to Miss Visite?"""
2742,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2743,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well--er--yes, my dear sir, I have,"" simpered the great booby."
2744,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2745,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Then I congratulate you,"" I exclaimed.  ""Here, Nelly,"" I said, running"
2746,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,towards the door.
2747,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2748,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""No, no, no--don't, don't, there's a good fellow,"" cried Retort,"
2749,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"dragging me back towards the table; ""don't call Mrs Scribe.  Let me"
2750,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"break it to her gently some other time.  I'd rather do it myself."""
2751,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2752,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Just as you like,"" I said, good-humouredly; and then I toasted the"
2753,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,future Mrs Retort's most honoured name.
2754,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2755,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well,"" continued Retort, drawing forth his catalogue, ""I was telling"
2756,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"you that I bid for a few lots, but those fellows run them up so, that I"

2758,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2759,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Yes, it was too bad,"" I muttered, fumbling in my pocket for my"

2761,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2762,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Here, Emily,"" I said, when the maiden answered the bell, ""fetch that"
2763,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,catalogue out of my coat-pocket in the dressing-room.  Don't show it to
2764,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"any one else.  Bring it straight here;"" for I was rather alarmed lest"
2765,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,Mrs Scribe should see the figures made beside the lots I had secured.
2766,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2767,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Emily soon returned, and then, with a somewhat darkened brow, I began to"
2768,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,refer to the different items.
2769,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2770,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""What did you bid for, Tom?""  I said to my friend, who was poring over"
2771,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"the list, evidently deep in for furnishing.  ""But I never thought of"
2772,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"your getting married, old chap; though I did half fancy that you were"
2773,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"sweet after Miss V."""
2774,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2775,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Why, you don't suppose I should have wasted a day at a sale if I had"
2776,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"not wanted things, do you?"""
2777,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2778,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Never gave it a thought,"" said I.  ""And so you didn't buy anything"

2780,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2781,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""No,"" said Retort.  ""Did you?"""
2782,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2783,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well--er--er--um, ye-e-es; a few things--a few."""
2784,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2785,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Things went dear, though, didn't they?"""
2786,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,

2788,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2789,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Oh, I thought that Turkey carpet would just suit us; and as you were"
2790,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"going in for the drawing-room Brussels, why, I bid for it; but those"
2791,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"Israelitish villains run it up to twenty-two pounds."""
2792,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2793,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,I was so out of breath for a moment that I couldn't speak.
2794,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2795,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Then,"" continued my dear friend, ""I wanted those card and occasional"
2796,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"tables, but couldn't get them; they bought the dinner-service, too, at"
2797,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"six ten, and the china for seven pounds.  Then I took a strong fancy to"
2798,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"that wool mattress, but of course I wasn't going to give five guineas"
2799,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"for it.  It certainly was a beautifully soft and thick one, but one"
2800,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"could buy it new for the money, or less."""
2801,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2802,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Did you bid for any of the plate?""  I gasped in husky tones."
2803,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2804,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Well, 'pon my word, old chap, I'm half ashamed to own it, but I really"
2805,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,was stupid enough to go as far as eleven and sixpence an ounce for it--
2806,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"which is an absurd price, you know.  But there, thank goodness!  I've"
2807,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"escaped, for I haven't bought a single lot."""
2808,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2809,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"I did not speak for quite five minutes, for the simple reason that I"
2810,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"could not.  What was I to do, or what was I to say?  I wanted to call"
2811,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"him names, and take him by the collar to shake him till his teeth"
2812,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,chattered.  But who could so treat a guest?
2813,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2814,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Let's go up and have some tea,"" I said at last, very hoarsely; and"
2815,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"then, recovering myself, I stopped him, for I felt sure he would begin"
2816,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"talking upstairs, while Mrs Scribe, on the subject being broached,"
2817,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,would ask--what as yet she had not had opportunity for--what I had
2818,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,secured.
2819,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2820,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"""Stop a minute, Tom,"" I said.  ""Don't say a word about the sale"

2822,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
2823,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"He looked at me strangely, and kept his counsel as well as mine--and not"
2824,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"a single word has since passed our lips; but in after days, when dining"
2825,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"at our house in company with his wife, I have seen his eyes wander from"
2826,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"the Turkey carpet to the dinner-service, and again, in the drawing-room,"
2827,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,from the occasional tables to the china tea-cups and saucers; and then
2828,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"he has glanced darkly at me, with the look of a found-out conspirator,"
2829,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"and I have looked darkly at him.  But, no, not even to the wife of my"
2830,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,bosom have I ever unburdened myself respecting the prices I paid for the
2831,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,new acquisitions to our furnishing department.  While as to that
2832,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"five-guinea wool mattress, I could almost swear that, whoever stuffed"
2833,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"it, stuffed in the miserable sheep's trotters and bones, for whenever by"
2834,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,"chance we have slept in the visitors' room, upon airing principles, I"

3057,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Why you're as nervous and bashful as ever, my boy,"" said Broxby, in his"
3058,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"rough, good-natured way, and I tried to laugh it off, particularly as it"
3059,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,was said before so many people in the well-lit drawing-room; but even
3060,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,before the fearful shock my nerves received I always was of a terribly
3061,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"nervous temperament, a temperament which makes me extremely susceptible."
3062,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3063,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,As I am now forty I have given up all hopes of ever getting the better
3064,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"of it, even as I have felt compelled to give up the expectation of"
3065,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"whiskers, curling hair, and--well no, not yet, for, as the poet says,"
3066,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""We may be happy yet,"" and some fond, loving breast may yet throb for me"
3067,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"in the future.  I may add that my hair is fair, my face slightly"
3068,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"freckled, and that I have a slight lisp, but it is so slight that you do"
3069,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,not notice it when you get used to me.
3070,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3071,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"After a long, cold ride down by train to Ancaster, and a six miles' ride"
3072,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"in Broxby's dog-cart from the station, where I was met by his groom, the"
3073,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"well-lit drawing-room seemed so cheering and comfortable, and as I grew"
3074,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,a little more at home I began to be glad that I had left my chambers to
3075,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"their fate for the time, and come down to bask awhile in the light of so"
3076,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,many lustrous orbs.
3077,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3078,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,I was just feeling somewhat confused from the fact of Mrs Major
3079,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Carruthers having rested her eye upon me and smiled sweetly, when as a"
3080,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"matter of course I felt bound to do either one thing or the other, look"
3081,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"angry and suppose that she was laughing at me, or smile sympathetically"
3082,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"in return.  I did the latter, when, as I said before, I became confused"
3083,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"to see that Major Carruthers was frowning fiercely at me, while his face"
3084,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,looked quite currant-dumplingified from the fierce hue assumed by his
3085,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,pimples.  But just at that moment a servant announced something to my
3086,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"host, who came forward, slapped me on the shoulder, and I followed him"
3087,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"out of the room into his study, where a small table was spread expressly"
3088,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,for my delectation.
3089,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3090,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""You see we dined two hours ago, Augustus, so I'm going to chat and have"
3091,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,a glass of sherry with you while you freshen up.  I thought it would be
3092,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"more snug for you here in my study, so cut away."""
3093,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3094,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"I must confess to having felt hungry, and I directly commenced the meal,"
3095,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,while my friend chatted pleasantly about the party I had met in the
3096,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,drawing-room.
3097,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3098,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Why, we must find you a wife, one of those fair maidens, my boy.  A"
3099,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"good, strong-minded, lovable woman would be the making of you.  Good"
3100,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"people, those Carruthers, only the Major is so fearfully jealous of his"
3101,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"wife--simple, quiet, good-hearted soul as ever breathed.  And oh, by the"
3102,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"bye, I have to apologise to you for something really unavoidable.  I"
3103,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"would not trouble you if I could help myself, but I can't.  You see the"
3104,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Major is a first cousin of my wife's, and we always ask them to our"
3105,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"little gatherings, while it so happened that Mrs Major's brother was"
3106,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"staying with them, when, as it was either bring him or stay away"
3107,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"themselves, Laura, my wife you know, thoughtlessly said `Bring him,'"
3108,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,never stopping to think that every bed in the house was engaged.  What
3109,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"to do I could not think, nor where to put him, till at last I said to"
3110,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"myself why Gus Littleboy will help me out of the difficulty, and"
3111,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"therefore, my lad, for two nights only I have to go down on my"
3112,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,inhospitable marrowbones and ask you to sleep double.  We've put you in
3113,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the blue room, where there's an old four-poster that is first cousin to"
3114,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the great bed of Ware, so that you can lie almost a quarter of a mile"
3115,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"from each other, more or less you know, so you won't mind, will you old"
3116,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"fellow, just to oblige us you know?"""
3117,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3118,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Of course I promised not to mind, and a great deal more, but still I did"
3119,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"mind it very much, for I omitted to say that, er--that er--I am"
3120,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"extremely modest, and the fact of having a gentleman in the same room"
3121,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,was most painful to my feelings.
3122,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3123,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"We soon after joined the party in the drawing-room; and, feeling"
3124,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"somewhat refreshed, I tried to make myself agreeable, as it was"
3125,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Christmas-time, and people are expected to come out a little.  So I"
3126,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"brought out two or three conjuring tricks that I had purchased in town,"
3127,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,and Broxby showed them off while I tried to play one or two tricks with
3128,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"cards; but, somehow or another, when Mrs Major Carruthers drew a card,"
3129,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"I had forgotten the trick, and she had to draw another card which she"
3130,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"dropped; and, when it was on the carpet, we both stooped together to"
3131,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"pick it up; and you've no idea how confusing it was, for we knocked our"
3132,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"heads together, when I distinctly heard some one go ""Phut"" in precisely"
3133,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the same way as a turkey-cock will when strutting; when, to my intense"
3134,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"dismay, I again found that the Major was scowling at me fiercely."
3135,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3136,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Then I should go to bed if I were you, Timothy,"" I heard Mrs Major say"
3137,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"soon after; and, on looking across the room, I saw that she was talking"
3138,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"to her brother, but her eye was upon me, and she was smiling, so that I"
3139,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"felt perfectly horrified, and looked carefully round at the Major; but"
3140,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"he was playing cards, and did not see me."
3141,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3142,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"So Mr T Peters left the room, and Broxby did all he could to amuse his"
3143,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"visitors, till the ladies, one and all, declared they must retire, when"
3144,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,the gentlemen drew round the fire; and a bright little kettle having
3145,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"been set upon the hob and a tray of glasses placed upon the table, my"
3146,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"friend brewed what he called a night-cap, a portion of which I left four"
3147,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"of them discussing when Broxby rang for a candlestick, and told the maid"
3148,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,to show me the bedroom.
3149,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3150,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Did you have my portmanteau taken up?""  I said to the maid."
3151,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3152,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Yes, sir."""
3153,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3154,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""And carpet-bag?"""
3155,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3156,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Yes, sir."""
3157,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3158,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""And writing-case?"""
3159,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3160,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Oh yes, sir; all there--that's the door, sir; you'll find everything"
3161,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"well-aired, and a nice fire;"" and then the maiden tripped off and"
3162,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"disappeared at the back.  But I had left my skin rug in the hall; and,"
3163,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"as it was so excessively cold, I went down the broad staircase once"
3164,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"more, and fetched it; returned to the bedroom door, opened it to make"
3165,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,sure I was right--not a doubt of it: nice fire--the great four-post
3166,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"bedstead with the great blue hangings.  No; they were green, and I was"
3167,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"about to start back, only a heavy breath from the bed told me that I was"
3168,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"right; and, besides, I recollected that blue always looked green by"
3169,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"candle-light; and this was the case, too, with the paper I observed."
3170,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3171,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Most extraordinary people that Major and his wife,"" I thought; and then"
3172,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"I wound up my watch, laid it upon the chimney-piece, carefully locked"
3173,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"and bolted the door, and then, drawing a chair up to the fire, sat down"
3174,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"to give my feet a good warm.  The room was most comfortably furnished,"
3175,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"and the chair soft and well stuffed; when, what with the heat of the"
3176,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"fire, the cold wind during my ride, and, perhaps, partly owing to the"
3177,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"night-cap I had partaken of, I fell into a sort of doze, and then the"
3178,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"doze deepened into a sleep, in which I dreamed that the Major had called"
3179,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"me out for endeavouring to elope with his wife, when it was that strange"
3180,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"eye of hers which had run away with me, while her set of false teeth"
3181,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,were in full chase behind to seize me like some rabid dog.
3182,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3183,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"The horror became so great at last that I started from my sleep, kicking"
3184,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the fender as I did so, when the fire-irons clattered loudly."
3185,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3186,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""What's that?"" cried a familiar voice, which sounded rather softly, as"
3187,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,if from beneath the clothes.
3188,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3189,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Only the fire-irons, my dear sir,"" I said, blandly--""I kicked them."""
3190,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"The next moment an exclamation made me turn sharply round; when, horror"
3191,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"of horrors! there was a set of teeth upon the dressing-table, and from"
3192,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,between the curtains of the bed Mrs Major's eyes fixing me in the most
3193,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,horrifying way.
3194,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3195,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Monster!"" cried a cracked voice, which sent me sprawling up against the"
3196,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"wash-stand, whose fittings clattered loudly; while at one and the same"
3197,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"moment I heard the voice of the Major talking, and the loud, hearty"
3198,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,laugh of Broxby upon the stairs.
3199,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3200,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,I was melting away fast when more of Mrs Major appeared through the
3201,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"curtains; in fact, the whole of her head, night-cap, papers and all, and"
3202,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,the cracked voice shrieked--
3203,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3204,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Monster, there's help at hand!--Alfred, Alfred, help! help!"" and then"
3205,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the head disappeared; when I heard from inside the curtains a choking,"
3206,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,stifling noise; and then came a succession of shrieks for aid.
3207,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3208,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""For pity's sake, silence, madam!""  I cried, running to the door; but"
3209,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,the next moment I ran back.
3210,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3211,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Open this door, here!--open!"" roared the Major, kicking and thundering,"
3212,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"so that the panels cracked.  ""Matilda, my angel, I am here."""
3213,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3214,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Don't, don't; pray don't scream, ma'am,"" I implored."
3215,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3216,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Oh! oh! oh! help, help, help! murder!"" shrieked Mrs Major."
3217,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3218,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Here, hi! oh! villain!  A man's voice!  Break in the door; smash it off"
3219,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"the hinges.  I am here, Matilda, I am here.  Broxby, what is this?"""
3220,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,roared the Major; and then the door cracked and groaned beneath the
3221,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,blows thundered upon it.
3222,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3223,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Oh! oh! oh!"" shrieked Mrs Major."
3224,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3225,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""What shall I do?""  I muttered, wringing my hands and trembling like a"
3226,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"leaf.  I ran to the bed to implore Mrs Major to be still, but she only"
3227,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"shrieked the louder.  I ran to the door, but fled again on hearing the"
3228,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"thunderings and roarings of the Major, who beat frantically, louder and"
3229,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,louder.
3230,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3231,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Sir, sir,"" I cried, ""it's a mistake."""
3232,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3233,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Oh! villain,"" he shrieked.  ""Here, here, a poker; my pistols.  Broxby,"
3234,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"there'll be murder done."""
3235,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3236,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Madam, oh! madam,"" I cried, in agony, ""have pity, and hear me."""
3237,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3238,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Oh! oh! oh! help! help!"" shrieked the wretched woman; when I heard the"
3239,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"door going crack, crack; the panel was smashed in, and the sounds of the"
3240,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"hubbub of voices entered the room, wherein I could detect that of the"
3241,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Major, more like a wild beast than anything, when, dashing to the"
3242,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"window, I pushed back the fastener, threw up the sash, and crept out,"
3243,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"lowered myself down till I hung by my hands, when, with my last look, I"
3244,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"saw an arm reaching through the broken panel, the bolt slipped, the key"
3245,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"turned, and a rush of people into the room; when, losing my hold, I fell"
3246,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"crash into a tree, and then from branch to branch to the ground, where I"
3247,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"lay, half-stunned, upon the cold snow."
3248,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3249,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""There he is,"" shouted a voice from above me, whose effect was like"
3250,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"electricity to my shattered frame, for I leaped up, and gaining the"
3251,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"pathway, fled to the road, and then on towards the station, only pausing"
3252,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,once to listen for the sounds of pursuit and to tie my handkerchief
3253,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,round my head to screen it from the icy breeze.  I ran till I was
3254,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"breathless, and then walked, but only to run again, and this I kept on"
3255,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"till I had passed the six miles between Broxby's Beat and Ancaster,"
3256,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"where I arrived just before the night mail came in, at a quarter to"
3257,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,four.
3258,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3259,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"One of the porters was very civil, and, supposing that my hat had been"
3260,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"blown off and lost, sold me a very dirty old greasy cap for five"
3261,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"shillings, and then I once more felt safe as I leaned back in a"
3262,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"carriage, and felt that we were going towards London at the rate of"
3263,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,forty miles an hour.  But I did not feel thoroughly safe until I had
3264,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"gained entrance, in the cold dark morning, to my chambers by means of my"
3265,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"latchkey, and having barricaded the door, tried to forget my sorrows in"
3266,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"sleep, but I could not, while, as my laundress supposed that I should be"
3267,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"away for a week, everything was in a most deplorable state, in"
3268,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,consequence of the old woman meaning to have a good clean up on
3269,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,Boxing-day.
3270,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3271,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"I did not go out for a week, for I had to take precautions for my"
3272,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"health's sake, putting my feet in hot water, and taking gruel for the"
3273,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"bad cold I caught; but for that, and the nervous shock, I was not hurt,"
3274,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,though my clothes were much torn.  It was about eight days after that a
3275,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"letter arrived while I was at breakfast, bearing the Ancaster post-mark,"
3276,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"directed to me in Broxby's familiar hand; but I had read it twice, with"
3277,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"disgust portrayed on every lineament, before I perceived that my late"
3278,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,friend had evidently written to his brother and to me at the same
3279,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"sitting, when, by some hazard, the letters had been cross-played and put"
3280,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"in the wrong envelopes, for the abominable epistle was as follows:--"
3281,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3282,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Dear Dick,--You should have come down.  Such a spree.  My ribs are"
3283,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"sore yet with laughing, and I shall never get over it.  I sent old Gus"
3284,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Littleboy an invite.  Poor fool, but no harm in him except blundering."
3285,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"The Major was here; quite a houseful, in fact.  Gus was to sleep with"
3286,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Tim Peters, and got somehow into the Major's room while he was down"
3287,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"with me finishing the toddy.  Murder, my boy.  Oh! you should have"
3288,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"been here to hear the screaming, and seen the Major stamp and go on."
3289,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"He kicked the panel in, when poor Gus fled by the window, and has not"
3290,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,sent for his traps yet.  For goodness sake contrive for the Major to
3291,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"meet him at your place when I'm up next week.  It will be splitting,"
3292,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,and of course I can't manage it now.
3293,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3294,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Yours affectionately,"
3295,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3296,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"""Joe Broxby."""
3297,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,
3298,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,I need scarcely tell a discerning public that I refused the invitation
3299,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"sent me by Mr Richard Broxby, of Bedford Square, when it arrived the"
3300,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"next week; while when, some months after, I encountered the Major and"
3301,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"his wife upon the platform of the Great Nosham, Somesham, and Podmorton"
3302,A HORROR OF HORRORS.,"Railway, I turned all of a cold perspiration, for my nerves will never"

3335,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"you know, and then you're all right, and will find us decent working,"
3336,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,when you moulds us up and brings out a model cabby.
3337,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3338,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"You see you calls them black fellows men and brothers, but I'm blest if"
3339,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"I think some people thinks as we are; for, instead of brothers, they"
3340,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"treat us as if we was werry distant relations indeed, and then sets to"
3341,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,and fights it out with us for every sixpence we earns.  Don't believe a

3343,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"heart no, not they!  ""Oh, they're a bad lot, kebmen,"" says Mrs John"
3344,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Bull, and she says as the straw's musty, the lining fusty, and the"
3345,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"seat's dusty, and then grumbles at the horse, and blows up the driver"
3346,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,and flings dirt at him.
3347,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3348,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""You rascal--you scoundrel!  I'll summons you; I'll put you on the"
3349,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,treadmill; I'll have the distance measured; I'll--I'll write to the

3354,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3355,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""I'll--I'll--I'll,"" I says to myself.  ""Nice ile yours 'ud be to grease"

3357,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,over a mile as he rode.  And only think of wanting to put a Hansom
3358,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"driver off with sixpence.  Then, again, I drives a gent to the rail, and"
3359,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"his missus with him, and when he gets out he sorter sneaks a shillin'"
3360,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"into my hand, and then's going to shuffle off, when ""Wot's this here"

3362,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3363,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Your fare, my man,"" he says, werry mildly."

3365,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Hayten-pence more,"" I says."
3366,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3367,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Sixpence a mile, my good man,"" he says, ""and Mogg's guide says that--"""
3368,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3369,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Mogg's guide doesn't say that kebs is to be made carriers' waggons on"
3370,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"for nothing,"" I says; and then the porters laughed, and he gives me the"
3371,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"difference of the half-crown; and only nat'ral, for I'll tell you what"
3372,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,there was.  First there was three boxes--heavy ones--on the roof; two
3373,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"carpet-bags and a portmanty on the seat aside me; a parrot's cage, a"
3374,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"cap-box, a gun-case, and a whole bundle o' fishing-rods, and umbrellys,"
3375,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,and things on the front seat; and him and his missus on the back.  And
3376,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"arter the loading up and loading down, and what not, I don't think as it"
3377,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"was so werry dear.  I sarved him out, though, for I took and bit every"
3378,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"blessed bit o' silver, making believe as I didn't think 'em good, and"
3379,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"stood grumbling there till the porters had got all the things in, and"
3380,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,Master Generous had put hisself outer sight.
3381,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3382,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"You see, sir, it ain't us as has all the queer pints; there's some as I"
3383,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"knows on, if they was brought down to kebbing, 'stead of being swells,"
3384,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,they'd be a jolly sight worse than we.
3385,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3386,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Didn't know Tom Sizer, I s'pose?  No, you wouldn't know him, I dare say."
3387,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Out an out driver, he was, poor chap.  But what was the use on it to"
3388,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"him?  Just because he was clever with the reins, and could do a'most"
3389,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"anything with any old knacker of a 'oss, the guv'nor sets him up the"
3390,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"shabbiest of any man as went outer the yard.  There he was, poor chap,"
3391,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"with the wust 'oss and the wust keb, and then being only a seedy-looking"
3392,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"cove hisself, why he turned out werry rough.  But that didn't matter;"
3393,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Tom allus managed to keep upsides with the guv'nor, and was never"
3394,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"behind.  Being a quiet sorter driver, yer see, he'd got some old ladies"
3395,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"as was regular customers, and one way and another he made it up.  And it"
3396,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"was always the guv'nor's artfulness, you know: he had old 'osses and a"
3397,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"old keb or two, and if he'd sent some men out with 'em they'd ha'"
3398,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,brought back a'most nothing.
3399,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3400,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"A regular sharp, teasing winter came on; rain, and freeze, and blow; and"
3401,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"then our pore old Tom he got dreadful shaky at last, and his cough"
3402,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"teased him awful, so none of us was surprised when we found one day as"
3403,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,he warn't come to the yard; nor we warn't surprised next day when he
3404,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,didn't come; nor yet when a whole week passed away and his keb stood
3405,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"under the shed, and his 'oss kep in the stable, for they was such bad"
3406,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,'uns none of our chaps'd have anything to do with 'em; and more'n once I
3407,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"see the guv'nor stand with his hat half-raised in one hand, and"
3408,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"scratting his head with t'other, as he looked at the old worn keb, as"
3409,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"much as to say, ""I shall never make anything outer that any more."""
3410,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3411,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas arternoon comes, and I thinks as I'll go and have a look at"
3412,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Tom.  So I tidies up a bit, puts on a white choker, and ties it"
3413,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"coachman's fashion, and fixes it with a horse-shoe pin, as my missus"
3414,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"give me when we was courting.  Then I brushes my hat up, and was just"
3415,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"going off, when the missus says, ""Wot d'yer want yer whip for?"" she"
3416,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"says.  ""Wot do I want my whip for?""  I says, and then I stops short, and"
3417,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"goes and stands it up in the corner by the drawers, for it didn't seem"
3418,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"nat'ral to go out without one's whip, and it ain't often as we goes out"
3419,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"walking, I can tell you."
3420,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3421,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Well, I toddles along, and gets to the place at last, where Tommy held"
3422,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"out: tall house it was, just aside Awery Row, and opposite to a mews;"
3423,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"werry pleasant lookout in summer-time, for the coachmen's wives as lived"
3424,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,over the stables was fond of their flowers and birds; but even in winter
3425,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,time there was allus a bit o' life going on: chaps cleaning first-class
3426,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"'osses, or washing carriages, or starting off fresh and smart to drive"
3427,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"out shopping or in the park.  Fine, clean-legged, stepping 'osses, and"
3428,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,bright warnished carriages and coachmen in livery; and all right up to
3429,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"the mark, you knew."
3430,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3431,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"So I goes on upstairs, for I knowed the way to his room, along of having"
3432,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,had supper with him one night--mussels and a pot of stout we had--so I
3433,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"didn't ring three times like a stranger, but walks up one pair, two"
3434,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"pair, three pair stairs, and then I stops short, for the door was ajar,"
3435,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and I could see a gentleman's back, and hear talking; so I says to"
3436,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"myself, ""That's the doctor,"" I says, and I sets down on the top stair to"
3437,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"get my wind, and then I turns quite chilly to hear poor old Tom's voice,"
3438,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"so altered and pipy I didn't know what to make of it, as he says."
3439,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3440,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""There, sir, don't stand no more; set down.  Not that chair, 'cos the"
3441,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"leg's broke.  Try t'other one.  Well,"" he says, ""I takes this as werry"
3442,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,kind of you to come and see a poor fellow as is outer sorts and laid
3443,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,up--laid up!  Ah! it's pretty well knacker's cart and Jack Straw's
3444,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"castle with me.  The missus there's been cleaning and a-tidying up, and"
3445,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"doing the best she could; but, in course, with me in it, the bed can't"
3446,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"be turned up, and so the place can't look werry decent.  I do take it as"
3447,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,werry kind of a gent like you climbing up three pairs o' stairs o'
3448,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,purpose to come and see me--it quite cheers me up.  Not as I wants for
3449,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"visitors, for I has the 'spensary doctor, and there's four sorter"
3450,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"journeymen preachers comes a-wherretin' me; till, as soon as I sees one"
3451,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"on 'em coming in all in black, I thinks it's the undertaker hisself."
3452,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"The doctor came half an hour ago--two hours, was it? ah, well, I've been"
3453,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"asleep, I s'pose; and then time goes.  He's left me a lot more physic"
3454,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and stuff, but I ain't taken it, and I ain't a-going to; for what's the"
3455,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,use o' greasing the keb wheels when the tires is off and the spokes is
3456,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"all loose and rattling, and a'most ready to tumble out.  'Tain't no use"
3457,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"whatsomever, whether they've been good ones or bad ones.  It's all up;"
3458,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and you may wheel the keb werry gently through the yard under the shed,"
3459,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and leave it there, and wot odds; there's fresh 'uns a-coming out every"
3460,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"day with all the noo improvements, so what's the use o' troubling about"
3461,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,one as is worn out and out.  There ain't no use in trying to patch when
3462,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"all the woodwork's worm-eaten, while the lining's clean gone; what with"
3463,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"bad usage and bad weather; and, as to the windys, they ain't broke, but"
3464,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"they're grown heavy and dull, and I can't see through 'em; and you'll"
3465,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"soon see the blinds pulled down over 'em, never to come up no more--"

3471,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"so as it was terrible to listen, and I'd ha' slipped away, ony I felt as"
3472,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,I should like to have just a word with my poor old mate again.
3473,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3474,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""There,"" he says, ""I've got my wind again; you see it's up hill, and"

3476,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"rest up a-top for even a poor fellow like me; and, do you know,"" he"
3477,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"says, quite softly, ""I begins to want to get there, though it does grit"
3478,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,me to think as I can't take Polly on the box with me; but that's a hard
3479,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"thing to understand--that about life, and death, and 'ternity--for ever,"
3480,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and ever, and ever.  That's what the youngest parson as comes talks to"
3481,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"me about.  Nice fellow he is; I like him, for he seems to want to light"
3482,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"one's lamps up a bit and clear the road--seems fond of one like, and"
3483,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,eager to give one a shove outer the block.  But there; I ain't lived to
3484,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,six-and-sixty year without having my own thoughts about religion and
3485,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"that sort of thing.  I know as we're all bad enough, and I s'pose a-top"
3486,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"of the hill there it will all be reckoned against one, and kep' account"
3487,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"on, good and bad.  As I sez to Polly, after that chap had been here as"

3489,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"`Polly,' I sez, `it's no manner of use; I ain't a-going to turn king's"
3490,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,evidence and try to shirk out of it that way: what I've done wrong will
3491,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"go to the bad, and what I've done right I hope will go to the good,"
3492,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,while I'm sure no poor fellow could be more sorry than me for what's
3493,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"amiss.'  When we goes afore Him as judges up there, sir, it will all be"
3494,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"made light, and there won't be no feeling as justice ain't done.  There"
3495,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,won't be no big fellows in gowns and wigs a-trying to swear a chap's
3496,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"soul away--making a whole sarmon out of a word, and finding out things"
3497,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"as was never before thought on at all.  I've been before 'em, and"
3498,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"examined and cross-examined, and twisted about till you don't know what"
3499,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"your a-saying of.  And so, when I thinks of all this lying still in the"
3500,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"night, listening to the rumbling of the kebs--kebs as I shall never"
3501,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"drive no more; why, I feels comfortable and better like; don't seem to"
3502,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"see as it's so werry serious, as my number's been took, and I'm"
3503,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"summoned; `Done my dooty,' I says, `and kep' home together as well as I"

3505,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,must ha' come to it same as I'm a-coming now.'  Of course I should ha'
3506,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"had a finer funeral; but there, lots of fellows as I knows on the rank,"
3507,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"chaps as is Foresters, they'll drive behind me with their windy-blines"
3508,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"down, and a little bit o' crape bow on the ends o' their whips; they'll"
3509,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"smoke it at night in their pipes, and take it werry much to 'art when"

3515,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"to-day, p'raps, nor yet to-morrow, but some time afore long, for I knows"
3516,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"well enough how my number's been took, and my license is about gone."
3517,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Well, sir, I drove a cab thirty year, and it was never took away afore;"

3520,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Going, sir?"" he says: ""Then I'll take it as a favour, sir, if you'll"
3521,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"just see that young genelman--the parson as I likes, and ast him to"
3522,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,come.  He left his card on the chimbley there for me to send for him
3523,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"when I felt to want him, and he seems to be the real doctor for my"
3524,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"complaint.  I was to send if I wanted him before he came again, and I'd"
3525,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"rather not see them others too.  That first one helps me on a bit, and"
3526,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"somehow, I seem to want to be a-top of the hill now, and he's"
3527,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,first-class company for a pore chap on a dark road.  Nothing like a real
3528,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"friend when you're in trouble, and he seems one as will help."""
3529,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3530,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"""Good bye, sir,"" he says, werry softly.  ""The warnish is all rubbed off,"
3531,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,and the paint chipped and showing white and worn; the bottom's a-falling
3532,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"out, and the head's going fast; so once more, sir, good bye, for the old"

3535,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,
3536,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"And then some one stepped softly by me, and went down the creaking"
3537,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"stairs, and I got ready to go in; but, not feeling in a bit of a hurry,"
3538,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"for there was something seemed to stick in my throat, and I knew I"
3539,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"shouldn't be able to speak like a man when I got into the room, so I"
3540,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"stops outside a bit longer; and then, when I made sure as it was all"
3541,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"right with me once more, I steps softly in, and then stops short, when I"
3542,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"turned worse than ever; for there, kneeling down by his bed, was poor"
3543,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"Mrs Sizer sobbing, oh, so bitterly! and then I thought of how he said"
3544,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"he'd like to take her on the box with him.  And there, you'll laugh, I"
3545,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"know, at calling it a beautiful sight to see them pore, plain,"
3546,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,weather-and-time-worn people taking like a last farewell of one another;
3547,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"and it was no good; I daren't speak, but slowly and softly backed out,"
3548,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"thinking about the years them two had been together working up hill, up"
3549,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"hill always; and then it didn't seem so strange that, when one of these"
3550,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"old folks dies, the other goes into the long, deep sleep, to be with"
3551,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"him.  And then a-going down the stairs softly and slowly, I says to"
3552,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"myself, ""there's a deal o' rough crust and hard stuff caked over us, but"
3553,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,a pore man's heart's made of the real same material as God made those of
3554,CABBY AT CHRISTMAS.,"better folks of;"" and Lord bless you, sir! use him well, and you'll find"

3603,DRAT THE CATS.,"""almost the worst"" on it; not _the_ worst of it, for the worst of it is,"
3604,DRAT THE CATS.,"that she will be so aggravating, and won't own to it.  Say she can't"
3605,DRAT THE CATS.,"help it; well, then, why don't she own it, and tell me so--not go"
3606,DRAT THE CATS.,"sticking out, as she'd only jest shet her eyes, and was as wide awake as"
3607,DRAT THE CATS.,I was.
3608,DRAT THE CATS.,
3609,DRAT THE CATS.,"Now, I'll jest give you a sample.  We live in a part where there's cats"
3610,DRAT THE CATS.,enough to make the fortunes of five hundred millions o' Dick
3611,DRAT THE CATS.,Whittingtons.  The place is alive with 'em; scratching up your bits of
3612,DRAT THE CATS.,"gardens; sneaking in at your back doors, and stealing; making Hyde Parks"
3613,DRAT THE CATS.,and Kensington Gardens of the tops o' your wash-houses and tiles of your
3614,DRAT THE CATS.,"roof; and howling--howling--why, no mortal pusson would believe how them"
3615,DRAT THE CATS.,"cats can howl.  They seem to give the whole o' their minds to it, and"
3616,DRAT THE CATS.,"try it one against another, to see who's got the loudest voice, and"
3617,DRAT THE CATS.,"setting up such a concert as makes the old women cry, ""Drat the cats."""
3618,DRAT THE CATS.,"But that ain't no good: they don't mind being dratted, not a bit of it;"
3619,DRAT THE CATS.,"and if you go out into the back garden, and shy bricks, why, they only"
3620,DRAT THE CATS.,swear at you--awful.
3621,DRAT THE CATS.,
3622,DRAT THE CATS.,"Well, you see, we live in a very catty part, and it seems to me as if"
3623,DRAT THE CATS.,"the beasts warn't fed enough, and do it out of spite, for no sooner does"
3624,DRAT THE CATS.,"it get dark, than out they come, tunes their pipes, and then you can"
3625,DRAT THE CATS.,"hear 'em.  No matter where you are, back or front, there they are,"
3626,DRAT THE CATS.,"a-going it, like hooroar, till I'm blest if it ain't half enough to"
3627,DRAT THE CATS.,"drive you mad.  Why, there's one old black Tom, as you can hear a mile"
3628,DRAT THE CATS.,"off, and I wouldn't bet as you couldn't hear him two, for he's got a"
3629,DRAT THE CATS.,werry peculiar voice of his own.  I think it's what musical people calls
3630,DRAT THE CATS.,"a tenner, though it might be a hundreder for the noise it makes."
3631,DRAT THE CATS.,
3632,DRAT THE CATS.,"He's an artful old brute, though, is that Tom; and I've tried to come"
3633,DRAT THE CATS.,"round him scores of times, but it ain't no use, for he won't believe in"
3634,DRAT THE CATS.,"me.  I've taken out saucers of milk and bits of fish, all got ready on"
3635,DRAT THE CATS.,"purpose for my gentleman, but do you think he'd come?  No, thank you."
3636,DRAT THE CATS.,"And as soon as ever he ketches sight of me, he shunts, he does, and goes"
3637,DRAT THE CATS.,off like an express train in front of a runaway engine.
3638,DRAT THE CATS.,
3639,DRAT THE CATS.,"But I was going to tell you about my wife.  Now, nex' Monday's a"
3640,DRAT THE CATS.,fortni't since I come home werry tired and worn out--for porter's work
3641,DRAT THE CATS.,"at a big terminus at Christmas ain't easy, I can tell you; while, when"
3642,DRAT THE CATS.,"we are off night dootey, it's only natural as one should like a quiet"
3643,DRAT THE CATS.,"night's rest, which ain't much to ask for, now is it, even if a man does"
3644,DRAT THE CATS.,"only get a pound a week, and a sixpence now and then, as swells make a"
3645,DRAT THE CATS.,"mistake, and give you through not having read the notice up on the walls"
3646,DRAT THE CATS.,"about instant dismissal, and all that?  Well, tired out regularly, and"
3647,DRAT THE CATS.,"ready to sleep through anything a'most, I goes to bed, and as I lays"
3648,DRAT THE CATS.,down I thinks to myself--
3649,DRAT THE CATS.,
3650,DRAT THE CATS.,"You may howl away, my beauties, to-night, for I can sleep through"
3651,DRAT THE CATS.,anything.
3652,DRAT THE CATS.,
3653,DRAT THE CATS.,"And really I thought I could, but I suppose it was through having a"
3654,DRAT THE CATS.,"hyster barrel on my mind, that I couldn't go off directly--for there was"
3655,DRAT THE CATS.,"one missing, and a fish hamper, both on 'em.  No doubt, having been"
3656,DRAT THE CATS.,stolen by some one in the crowd on the platform; while I got the blame;
3657,DRAT THE CATS.,"and I put it to you, now, could a railway porter, having a pound a week,"
3658,DRAT THE CATS.,"and Sunday dooty in his turn, have his eyes every wheres at once?"
3659,DRAT THE CATS.,
3660,DRAT THE CATS.,"So I didn't go to sleep right off, but some one else did, and there,"
3661,DRAT THE CATS.,"just outside the window, if one o' them cats didn't begin."
3662,DRAT THE CATS.,
3663,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Wow-w-w, wow-w-w, wow-w-w, meyow-w-w,"" and all such a pretty tune,"
3664,DRAT THE CATS.,finished off with a long low swear at the end.
3665,DRAT THE CATS.,
3666,DRAT THE CATS.,"I stood it for ten minutes good, turning first one side, and then"
3667,DRAT THE CATS.,"another, pulling the clothes over my ear, and at last ramming my head"
3668,DRAT THE CATS.,"right under, with my fingers stuck in my ears, but there, Lor' bless"
3669,DRAT THE CATS.,"you, that was no good, for I'll warrant the song of one of them pretty,"
3670,DRAT THE CATS.,"soft, furry nightingales to go through anything, and at last I finds"
3671,DRAT THE CATS.,"that I was only smothering myself for nowt, and I puts my head out of"
3672,DRAT THE CATS.,"the clothes again, and give a great sigh."
3673,DRAT THE CATS.,
3674,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Me-ow-ow-ow,"" says my friend on the tiles."
3675,DRAT THE CATS.,
3676,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Hear that, Polly?""  I says."
3677,DRAT THE CATS.,
3678,DRAT THE CATS.,No answer.
3679,DRAT THE CATS.,
3680,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Me-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow,"" says my friend outside."
3681,DRAT THE CATS.,
3682,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Hear that, Polly?""  I says, for there warn't no fun in putting up with"
3683,DRAT THE CATS.,"all the noise yourself, when there was some one else in the room to take"
3684,DRAT THE CATS.,"half share.  ""Polly,"" I says, giving her a nudge, ""hear that?"""
3685,DRAT THE CATS.,
3686,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Eh!"" she says; ""what say?"""
3687,DRAT THE CATS.,
3688,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Hear that?""  I says."
3689,DRAT THE CATS.,
3690,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Yes,"" she says; ""what?"""
3691,DRAT THE CATS.,
3692,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Why, you were asleep,"" I says."
3693,DRAT THE CATS.,
3694,DRAT THE CATS.,"""That I'm sure I warn't,"" she says."
3695,DRAT THE CATS.,
3696,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Well, then, did you hear that?""  I says."
3697,DRAT THE CATS.,
3698,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Yes; what was it?"" she says."
3699,DRAT THE CATS.,
3700,DRAT THE CATS.,"""What was it?""  I says.  ""There; go to sleep again,"" I says; for I felt"
3701,DRAT THE CATS.,"quite rusty to think anybody else could sleep through such a row, while"
3702,DRAT THE CATS.,I couldn't.
3703,DRAT THE CATS.,
3704,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Meyow--meyow--wow--wow-w-w-w,"" goes the music again."
3705,DRAT THE CATS.,
3706,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Two on 'em,"" I says, as I lay listening, and there it went on getting"
3707,DRAT THE CATS.,"louder and louder every moment, both sides and over the way, and up and"
3708,DRAT THE CATS.,"down the street, till I'm blest if I could stand it any longer."
3709,DRAT THE CATS.,
3710,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Oh, you beauties,"" I says; ""if I only had a gun.""  And then I lay"
3711,DRAT THE CATS.,"there, listening and wondering whether I mightn't just as well get up"
3712,DRAT THE CATS.,"and have a pipe; and at last of all, because I couldn't stand it any"
3713,DRAT THE CATS.,"longer, I gets up, goes to the window, opens it softly, and says--"
3714,DRAT THE CATS.,
3715,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Ssh!"""
3716,DRAT THE CATS.,
3717,DRAT THE CATS.,"Lor' bless you! you might just as well have said nothing, for there they"
3718,DRAT THE CATS.,"were a-going it all round to that degree, that it was something awful,"
3719,DRAT THE CATS.,"and I stood there half dressed, and leaning out of the window, wondering"
3720,DRAT THE CATS.,what was best to be done.  There was no mistake about it; there they
3721,DRAT THE CATS.,"were, cats of all sorts and sizes, and of all kinds of voices--some was"
3722,DRAT THE CATS.,"very shrill, some very hoarse, and some round and deep-toned, and"
3723,DRAT THE CATS.,"meller.  Now and then some one would open a winder, and cry, ""Ssh,"" same"
3724,DRAT THE CATS.,"as I did, but as soon as they smelt what a sharp frost it was, they shut"
3725,DRAT THE CATS.,"them down again, and at last I did the same, and made up my mind as I"
3726,DRAT THE CATS.,"crept into bed again, as I'd go where there was no cats."
3727,DRAT THE CATS.,
3728,DRAT THE CATS.,"Yes, that was a capital idea, that was--to move to a place where there"
3729,DRAT THE CATS.,"was no cats, and on the strength of that determination, I went off fast"
3730,DRAT THE CATS.,asleep.
3731,DRAT THE CATS.,
3732,DRAT THE CATS.,"Next morning over my breakfast, I got thinking, and come to the"
3733,DRAT THE CATS.,"conclusion, that I'd cut myself out a bit of a job.  Where was I to get"
3734,DRAT THE CATS.,"a little house or lodgings where there was no cats, for were not the"
3735,DRAT THE CATS.,"happy, domestic creatures everywhere?  No; that was of no use, but I"
3736,DRAT THE CATS.,warn't going to stand having my rest broken night after night in that
3737,DRAT THE CATS.,"way; so I mounted a trap, for I'd made up my mind, that out of revenge,"
3738,DRAT THE CATS.,"I'd have a full-sized railway rug lined with scarlet cloth, while the"
3739,DRAT THE CATS.,rug itself should be of _fur_.
3740,DRAT THE CATS.,
3741,DRAT THE CATS.,"First night I sets my trap, I baited it with a bit of herring.  Goes"
3742,DRAT THE CATS.,"next morning and found the herring had been dragged out at the side, and"
3743,DRAT THE CATS.,"the trap warn't sprung.  Sets it next night, baited with two sprats;"
3744,DRAT THE CATS.,"goes next morning to find 'em gone, but no pussy.  And so I went on,"
3745,DRAT THE CATS.,"week after week, till I got tired out, and tried poison, which hit the"
3746,DRAT THE CATS.,"wrong game, and killed our neighbour's tarrier dog.  Then I thought I'd"
3747,DRAT THE CATS.,"try an air-gun, but somehow or another there was a fault in that gun,"
3748,DRAT THE CATS.,"for it wouldn't shoot straight, and I never hit one of the nuisances.  A"
3749,DRAT THE CATS.,"regular powder-and-shot gun I couldn't try, because it would have spoken"
3750,DRAT THE CATS.,"so loud, that all the neighbours would have heard and known who was"
3751,DRAT THE CATS.,killing the cats.
3752,DRAT THE CATS.,
3753,DRAT THE CATS.,"Last of all, one moonlight night I was down at the bottom of our garden,"
3754,DRAT THE CATS.,"when I happens to look up towards the back door, and see a long-tailed"
3755,DRAT THE CATS.,tortoise-shell beauty sneaking into the kitchen.
3756,DRAT THE CATS.,
3757,DRAT THE CATS.,"""All right, my pretty one,"" I says, quietly.  ""You'll do for the middle"
3758,DRAT THE CATS.,"of the rug,"" and then stealing softly up, I got to the door, slips in,"
3759,DRAT THE CATS.,"and had it to in a moment, and then getting hold of the copper-stick and"
3760,DRAT THE CATS.,"lid, just like a sword and shield, I goes forward to the attack."
3761,DRAT THE CATS.,
3762,DRAT THE CATS.,"No mistake, there was Mrs Puss glaring at me like a small tiger, and as"
3763,DRAT THE CATS.,"I advanced, she made a rush by me, but there was no escape that way, and"
3764,DRAT THE CATS.,then I shut the kitchen-door.
3765,DRAT THE CATS.,
3766,DRAT THE CATS.,"Bang--crash went the crockery, for as I made a hit at the brute, she"
3767,DRAT THE CATS.,"flew on to the dresser, and along one of the shelves, sending jugs and"
3768,DRAT THE CATS.,"plates down helter-skelter on the floor, where they smashed to bits."
3769,DRAT THE CATS.,
3770,DRAT THE CATS.,"""All down to your credit, my beauty,"" I says, and I made another hit at"
3771,DRAT THE CATS.,"her, when ""whoosh,"" spitting and swearing, she was up on the"
3772,DRAT THE CATS.,"chimney-piece in a jiffey, and down came the candlesticks, while Polly"
3773,DRAT THE CATS.,"puts her head in at the door, and then, seeing what was the matter,"
3774,DRAT THE CATS.,"slips off again in a moment, bangs the door to, and keeps on shouting to"
3775,DRAT THE CATS.,"me to drive the thing out.  But talking was one thing, and acting"
3776,DRAT THE CATS.,"another, for you never did see such a beast; she was here, there, and"
3777,DRAT THE CATS.,everywhere in the same moment; and though I kept hitting at her with the
3778,DRAT THE CATS.,"copper-stick, I could hit anything else but her, as you'd have said, if"
3779,DRAT THE CATS.,you'd seen me fetch the vegetable-dish and cover off the dresser with a
3780,DRAT THE CATS.,"smash, and then seen the copper lid split in two, when I shied it at"
3781,DRAT THE CATS.,her.
3782,DRAT THE CATS.,
3783,DRAT THE CATS.,"Why, she flew about to that degree, that I got frightened of her, for at"
3784,DRAT THE CATS.,"last she came at me, tore at my legs, and then was over my shoulder in"
3785,DRAT THE CATS.,"an instant, while feeling quite scared, I just saw her dash up the"
3786,DRAT THE CATS.,"chimney, and she was gone."
3787,DRAT THE CATS.,
3788,DRAT THE CATS.,"""But you won't stop there, my lady,"" I says, and I was right, for next"
3789,DRAT THE CATS.,"moment the brute came scrambling down, and we went at it again: she"
3790,DRAT THE CATS.,"cutting about, and me hitting at her till I got savage, for I never"
3791,DRAT THE CATS.,touched her once.  Now I hit the table; now it was something off the
3792,DRAT THE CATS.,"dresser; now she'd dodge behind the saucepans and kettles, on the black"
3793,DRAT THE CATS.,pot-board under the dresser; and now there'd be such a clatter and
3794,DRAT THE CATS.,"rattle, that Polly gave quite a scream, for she was wide enough awake"
3795,DRAT THE CATS.,"then, I can tell you; but the jolly a bit could I touch that precious"
3796,DRAT THE CATS.,"cat; and at last she stood in one corner of the kitchen, and I stood in"
3797,DRAT THE CATS.,"the other looking at her, with her tail like a bottle-brush, her fur all"
3798,DRAT THE CATS.,"up, and her back set up like an arch, and then I thought I'd try"
3799,DRAT THE CATS.,coaxing.
3800,DRAT THE CATS.,
3801,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Pussy, pussy, pussy,"" I says, but she only swore and spit at me."
3802,DRAT THE CATS.,
3803,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Poor pussy; come then,"" I says; but she wouldn't come near me, and then"
3804,DRAT THE CATS.,"I turned so savage that I threw the copper-stick at her, but only hit"
3805,DRAT THE CATS.,the tea-tray as stood on a little side-table.
3806,DRAT THE CATS.,
3807,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Bang, clang, jangle,"" down it come on to the floor, and then there was"
3808,DRAT THE CATS.,"a rush, and a smash, and a scream from Polly; and I stood skretching my"
3809,DRAT THE CATS.,"head, and looking at the broken kitchen-window--for the beauty had shot"
3810,DRAT THE CATS.,"right through it when the tea-tray fell down, and now there was nothing"
3811,DRAT THE CATS.,"to do but pick up the pieces, and go and ask the glazier to come and put"
3812,DRAT THE CATS.,in the broken square.
3813,DRAT THE CATS.,
3814,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Oh, what a kitchen,"" says Polly, as she came in, and really it did look"
3815,DRAT THE CATS.,"a bit upset, and then seeing as she was put out, and going to make a"
3816,DRAT THE CATS.,"fuss, I says--"
3817,DRAT THE CATS.,
3818,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Bad job; ain't it, my gal; but it warn't me; _it was the cats_!"""
3819,DRAT THE CATS.,
3820,DRAT THE CATS.,"""Drat the cats!"" says Polly; and she looked so scornful and cross, that"
3821,DRAT THE CATS.,I give up all thoughts on the instant of ever getting a skin rug; but if
3822,DRAT THE CATS.,"there is any one mortal thing as I do hate, it's a cat."

3828,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.
3829,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3830,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"No snow, no frosts, no bare trees, but in the daytime glowing, sultry"
3831,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heat, and of a night soft, balmy, dewy, moonlit hours, and yet it was"
3832,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas-time, and the whole of the past day I had been picturing to"
3833,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"myself the cold, sharp, bracing weather at home, with the busy shops and"
3834,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the merry Christmas faces, and now on that 24th of December I was"
3835,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"dreaming away of the old home, fourteen thousand miles away; going over"
3836,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"again the sad hearts with which we come away, and how we gazed till our"
3837,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,eyes swam at the fast fading shores; recalling every sigh and sorrowful
3838,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"thought, when all at once there seemed to be a feeling of horror come"
3839,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"over me, and I started up on the heath bed and looked about.  But all"
3840,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"was still; close beside me lay Abel Franks, my mate and companion,"
3841,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,sleeping heavily; the moon was shining through the little window right
3842,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"upon the two dogs stretched before the fireplace, and made it light"
3843,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,enough for me to see that everything was in its place.  There were the
3844,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"skin rugs on the floor, the rough bench, stool, and table; the guns,"
3845,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rods, nets, and oars of our boat; the shelf with its pile of birds'"
3846,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"skins, the brightest hued which fell to our guns; skins of opossum and"
3847,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"kangaroo hung against the wall; the burnt-out lamp on the table, with"
3848,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the fragments of our supper, all just as we had left them, while as the"
3849,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,surest sign that nothing had disturbed me the dogs were curled up quite
3850,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"motionless, when their quick ears would have heard a step in an instant."
3851,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3852,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I lay down again and listened attentively for a few minutes, and once"
3853,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heard faintly the howl of a wild dog, but that was all, and there in the"
3854,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"stillness of night, in that far-off Australian wild, I was slowly dozing"
3855,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,off when I again started up and this time Abel was up too staring at me.
3856,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3857,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""What is it, Harry?"" he cried, as at the same instant I asked him a"
3858,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"similar question, and then up leaped both dogs, set up the rough hair"
3859,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"round their necks, and ran to the door growling fiercely.  The moment"
3860,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"after came the cracking of sticks, a rustling through the bushes, and a"
3861,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heavy body fell up against the door, making the rough woodwork creak."
3862,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3863,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Living as we did in a hut of our own making, furnished by ourselves, our"
3864,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"own cooks and managers, we studied dress and toilets but very little;"
3865,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,our custom was to throw ourselves down upon our skin-covered bed of
3866,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heath, so that upon this occasion we were both instantly upon our feet,"
3867,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and, seizing our guns, stood in readiness for action, if defence were"
3868,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"needed, for in the days of Australia's early settlements, before the"
3869,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"bursting forth of the gold fever, many were the raids made by the"
3870,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"savage, and the worse than savage bushranger, escaped ""hand,"" or"
3871,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"convict, sent over from the mother country as a part of the dregs of her"
3872,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"population, to settle in the infant colonies."
3873,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3874,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"To open the door seemed the first thing, but we naturally hesitated, for"
3875,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"that meant giving perhaps an enemy admission to our fortress, for the"
3876,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,noise at the door might have been but a ruse to get the better of our
3877,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"caution.  A heavy groan, however, decided us, and as I stood with my"
3878,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"double gun ready cocked, and a couple of ready patched bullets rammed"
3879,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"hastily down upon the charges of duck-shot, Abel cautiously undid the"
3880,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fastenings, and the two dogs, no mean aids at such a time, stood ready"
3881,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,for a spring.
3882,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3883,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,There was something startling and oppressive there in the stillness of
3884,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the great wild, quite two miles as we were from the nearest station, and"
3885,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,now roused from slumber in so strange a way; but there was no time for
3886,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"thought, for grasping his long knife in one hand, with the other my"
3887,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"companion sharply opened the door, and as he did so a figure fell into"
3888,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"his arms.  The moonbeams, which streamed in at the open door, gave"
3889,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"enough light to show us that we had nothing to fear from the new-comer,"
3890,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"who lay before us groaning, while the dogs darted out after a momentary"
3891,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"pause by his side, and began scouring about the open."
3892,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3893,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Shut the door--quick--quick,"" groaned the man, ""they're tracking me."""
3894,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3895,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"We quickly acted upon his advice, and then, carefully covering the"
3896,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"window and door with rugs, obtained a light and began to examine our"
3897,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,visitor.  And a ghastly spectacle he presented: a gash on his forehead
3898,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"was bleeding profusely, covering his face with blood; his shirt was torn"
3899,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and dragged half off, while one arm lay doubled under him in a strange"
3900,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"unnatural position, as if it were broken."
3901,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3902,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Why it's Jepson,"" cried Abel in a whisper, and as he spoke the wounded"
3903,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"man started, opened his eyes and stared wildly, but closed them again,"
3904,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,groaning heavily.
3905,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3906,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"We lifted the poor fellow on to our bed, all the while listening for the"
3907,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"warning we expected momentarily to hear from our dogs, for without"
3908,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"explanation we knew well enough what had happened, namely, a night"
3909,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"attack upon the little station of our neighbour, Mr Anderson, whose"
3910,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,shepherd had made his escape to us.
3911,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3912,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Abel was, like me, all in a tremble, for we knew not yet what was the"
3913,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"extent of the disaster, and though we neither of us spoke, we knew each"
3914,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"other's thoughts; and our trembling was not from fear for ourselves, but"
3915,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"for what might be the fate of Mary Anderson, the blue-eyed Scottish"
3916,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"girl, whose presence lent a charm to this far-off wild."
3917,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3918,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Hastily binding up the poor fellow's head, I looked at and laid in an"
3919,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"easier position his arm, which was also bleeding, having evidently been"
3920,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,broken by a ball from gun or revolver.  A few drops of rum poured
3921,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"between his teeth revived him, and he was able to answer our questions."
3922,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3923,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Rangers, sir--six of 'em.  They've burnt the place down, shot the"
3924,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"master and young Harry, and gone off with Miss Mary and the servant gal."
3925,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I was tracking them, but they were too much for me; two of them hung"
3926,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"back and caught me from behind.  I did all I could, and then ran on"
3927,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"here."""
3928,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3929,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The exertion of saying this was too much for him, and he fainted away,"
3930,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"while half mad with grief and horror, Abel and I stood gazing at one"
3931,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,another.
3932,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3933,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"It was evident that the villains would not molest us, for they probably"
3934,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"only followed poor Jepson for a short distance, and then hurried after"
3935,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,their companions.  If they had been in pursuit we should have known of
3936,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"their presence before this from the dogs, which now came whining and"
3937,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,scratching at the door for admittance.
3938,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3939,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"We did all we could for the shepherd, and then, following Abel's"
3940,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"example, I drew the shot charge from my gun, replaced the bullets,"
3941,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"buckled on an ammunition pouch, and then reloaded and primed my"
3942,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"revolver.  Seeing these preparations going on, the dogs immediately"
3943,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"became uneasy and eager to be off, and though our quarry was to be far"
3944,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"different to any to which they were accustomed, it would have been a"
3945,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"strong, daring man that could have successfully combatted our"
3946,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,four-footed allies.
3947,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3948,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Our preparations were soon made, and then, after placing the spirit and"
3949,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"water beside the wounded man, we started off for Anderson's Creek"
3950,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"through the dense tea-scrub, for in our then excited state we made for"
3951,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the shortest cut.  The moon was fast sinking towards a heavy bank of
3952,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"clouds, but she gave us light for best part of our journey, while the"
3953,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,remainder was made plain for us by the glowing house and farm buildings
3954,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,in our front.
3955,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3956,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I couldn't help it--when I saw the wreck of that house where I had spent
3957,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"so many happy hours, and shudderingly thought of poor Mary, dragged off"
3958,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"by the bloodthirsty villains, I stopped short and gave vent to a bitter"
3959,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,groan.
3960,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3961,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"This roused Abel, who cried savagely to me to come on; for, faithful and"
3962,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"true friends in everything else, there was one rock upon which we split,"
3963,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and that was our admiration for Mary Anderson.  He was maddened himself,"
3964,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and scarcely knew how to contain his feelings, but the idea of me"
3965,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"grieving for her at such a time seemed to exasperate him, and he almost"
3966,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,yelled out--
3967,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3968,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Don't be a woman, Fred; come on, or we shall be too late."""
3969,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3970,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Too late!""  Too late for what?  A shudder ran through me as I asked"
3971,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"myself the question, and taking no notice of Abel's angry manner, I was"
3972,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"at his side in an instant, and we dashed on though the bushes."
3973,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3974,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,Just as we got up to the rough fence Abel stumbled and fell over
3975,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"something, and on recovering himself he stooped and raised the head of a"
3976,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"man.  The ruddy flames shone full upon his countenance, and we saw that"
3977,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"it was Harry, one of Mr Anderson's men.  He was quite dead, for the"
3978,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,side of his head was battered in.  Abel softly laid down the poor
3979,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fellow's head, and then we went cautiously round the building, with guns"
3980,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"cocked and ready, in case the villains might be lurking about, though we"
3981,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,knew enough of such catastrophes to feel assured that directly they had
3982,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,secured all the plunder and ammunition they could carry off they would
3983,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,decamp.
3984,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3985,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,The greater part of the buildings were blazing.  The house was nearly
3986,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"level with the ground, but the men's shed and the wool store still"
3987,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"blazed furiously, and on getting round to the back we both raised our"
3988,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"pieces to fire, but dropped them again directly, for just in front,"
3989,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"squatting round some glowing embers, were a party of black fellows, whom"
3990,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"we might have taken for the perpetrators of this foul outrage, had we"
3991,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"not known of their peaceable, inoffensive conduct."
3992,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
3993,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"In another instant they were running up to us, and a tall fellow,"
3994,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"evidently their leader, suddenly threw himself into position, with his"
3995,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"long, slender spear held horizontally, as if for throwing, and with the"
3996,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,point aimed directly at my breast.  Even in the midst of my trouble and
3997,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,anxiety I could not help thinking what an effect such a salute would
3998,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"have upon a stranger, for the unerring aim with which these untutored"
3999,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,men can throw a spear is something surprising.  But in another instant
4000,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the spear end touched the ground, and the party closed round us,"
4001,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"chattering and begging, and earnest in their efforts to make us aware"
4002,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,that they had not been the guilty parties.
4003,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4004,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Mine no fire,"" said the leader.  ""No black fellow kill."""
4005,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4006,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""No, no,"" I said; ""but who was it?"""
4007,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4008,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Dat Sam, Sooty Sam,"" said the savage, holding up six fingers, and"
4009,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,pointing towards the bush.
4010,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4011,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I nodded, and shuddered, for I knew but too well the character of the"
4012,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,mulatto convict known as Sooty Sam.
4013,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4014,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""You give me tickpence, mine shar,"" cried the fellow."
4015,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4016,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Money was an article I seldom carried then, unless bound for the nearest"
4017,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"settlement for stores, but I happened to have a fourpenny piece in my"
4018,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tobacco pouch, and I gave it to him."
4019,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4020,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Dat not tickpence, dat fourpenny,"" shouted the fellow, indignantly, for"
4021,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,constant communion with the settlers had induced a strong desire for the
4022,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,coins that would procure rum or whisky.
4023,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4024,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"A display of my empty pocket, however, satisfied my black ally, and"
4025,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"leading us towards one of the sheep pens, he coolly pointed out the body"
4026,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"of Mr Anderson, shot through the head, and lying just as he had fallen."
4027,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4028,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"We soon learned from the blacks which way the men had fled, and tried to"
4029,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"induce them to go with us to track the marauders, but without avail,"
4030,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"night work being their special abomination, and nothing short of a fire"
4031,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,like the present sufficing to draw them from their resting-place.  We
4032,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,knew that our proper course was to rouse the neighbours at the nearest
4033,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"stations, but in our impatience to pursue the scoundrels prudence and"
4034,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"management were forgotten.  Unable to gain the assistance of the blacks,"
4035,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"we determined to commence the pursuit alone with our dogs, after"
4036,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"promising the fellows ""much rum"" if they would rouse the neighbouring"
4037,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"settlers, who, we knew, would soon be on our trail; but in spite of the"
4038,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"direction being pointed out, we found, to our disappointment, that the"
4039,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"darkness would prove an enemy, and that we must wait for daylight, and"
4040,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,reluctantly turned back.
4041,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4042,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,All at once a ray of hope shot through my breast; just before me was old
4043,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Gyp, my favourite dog, a great half-bred sheep and wolf hound, who was"
4044,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"growling and snarling over a heap of what looked like sail cloth, but"
4045,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which inspection showed to be a tattered duck frock, filthily dirty, and"
4046,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"stained with blood, evidently having been cut off by some wounded man."
4047,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4048,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Old Gyp was licking the bloody part, and growling angrily, and on my"
4049,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"speaking to him, and encouraging him, he yelped and whined; and then,"
4050,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"setting his nose to the ground, ran a few yards, looked back, yelped"
4051,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"again, and then would have set off full speed along the trail, had I not"
4052,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"called him back and tied a piece of tar band to his neck, holding the"
4053,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,other end in my hand.
4054,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4055,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,Abel's eyes glittered as he saw the great powerful beast strain to be
4056,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"off, and then, without a word, we set off at a trot, and leaving the"
4057,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"glowing fire behind, plunged into the darkness before us."
4058,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4059,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"We reckoned that the villains had about two hours start, but encumbered,"
4060,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"as we knew they must be, with booty, and the two women, we felt sure"
4061,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"that, even with the horses they had doubtless taken, they could not have"
4062,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"retreated at a very great rate; why, though we both felt that it was"
4063,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"like plunging into the lion's jaws, and that most likely one, if not"
4064,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"both of us, would lose our lives in the impending struggle, there was"
4065,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"not a thought in either of our breasts that savoured of fear, for the"
4066,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,desire to overtake the villains was intense.
4067,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4068,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"But it was a fearful task.  The darkness was now terrible, and the eager"
4069,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"beast struggled on, irrespective of bush or thorn, while every now and"
4070,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,then some thick tuft in the track would trip me up.  Abel had a hard
4071,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"task to keep up with me.  But before daylight matters grew better, for"
4072,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"we were in the wood, where there was scarcely any undergrowth, and when"
4073,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"day broke we were threading our way through the sombre forest, where the"
4074,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tree trunks were all around, apparently endless, and so similar that"
4075,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"only the sagacious beast before us, or a native, could have found a way"
4076,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,through.
4077,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4078,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Now and then we could catch a glimpse of a star or two, but directly"
4079,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"after the clouds seemed to close up again, and we stumbled on till a"
4080,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"faint light announced the coming day, which found us blackened, torn,"
4081,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and bleeding, but as feverishly eager for the fray as ever."
4082,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4083,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"As for track, that was invisible to us, excepting now and then, where"
4084,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the print of a horse's hoof showed in a moist place, and told us that"
4085,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the faithful beast with us was worthy of the trust placed in him.  Now
4086,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"we were out in the open, then making our way again through the"
4087,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tea-scrub, and then skirting a ravine beside the range of rugged, bleak"
4088,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rocks, standing out bold and barren, while the ravine, now here and"
4089,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"there green, where a pool of water remained, or a tiny rivulet trickled"
4090,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,along where we saw a rushing river in the rainy season.
4091,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4092,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,If one's heart could have been at rest how beautiful was the scene
4093,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"around, tree, bush, flower, and rugged mossy stone, where the track"
4094,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"wound in and out, now down into the deep ravine, now crossing the little"
4095,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"bright rill which sometimes trickled beneath the grass, and again"
4096,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"appeared, leaping from rock to rock.  Birds everywhere flitting and"
4097,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"climbing about the trees, or hanging in places, like flowers of gorgeous"
4098,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,hues.
4099,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4100,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"But there was no peace for us, and we strode on till from the early"
4101,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"freshness of the morning we were panting through the heat of the day,"
4102,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heat so oppressive that it grew unbearable, and but for the errand of"
4103,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"life and death upon which we were engaged, we should have rested until"
4104,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the sun was again low down in the horizon.
4105,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4106,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,Sooner or later we felt sure that we should come upon some traces of the
4107,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"marauders, and we were not disappointed, for, all at once, the dog gave"
4108,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"a whining bark, and began snuffing about in the grass, where lay a"
4109,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"bottle evidently but lately cast aside.  Then on again, panting, with"
4110,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,parched lips and tongue: any doubts that we had formerly had respecting
4111,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the dog's ability to trace the marauders being now fully put to flight.
4112,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4113,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"And now the track led us right down into the deep ravine, where the"
4114,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"sides rose seventy or eighty feet high on either side, at times almost"
4115,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"perpendicular; but in spite of the roughness of the path, the coolness"
4116,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,was most grateful as we struggled on beneath the shade.
4117,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4118,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I was at times so faint that I could gladly have rested, but the thought"
4119,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"of those on before acted as a spur to my flagging energies, and I"
4120,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"pressed on.  Abel seemed to know no fatigue, and when he was in front,"
4121,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"holding the dog, I had hard work to keep up with him, while I could hear"
4122,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,him muttering to himself angrily as he pressed on.
4123,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4124,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"All at once we pulled short up, startled by the threatening aspect that"
4125,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,had come over the heavens.  It was evident that a storm was coming on;
4126,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and knowing, as we did, the character of the rain in the region we were"
4127,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"in, the thought crossed both our minds, what would the ravine be if a"
4128,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"storm came.  But the dragging of the dog roused us, and again we pressed"
4129,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"on, feeling convinced that we must be close upon the scoundrels; and"
4130,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"indeed we were so close that, at the next turning, we came in sight of"
4131,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"them--six, with two horses, two of the fellows being mounted, and with"
4132,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,one of the women before him.
4133,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4134,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,No sooner were we in sight than the dog bayed loudly; the two mounted
4135,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"men dashed on, while the other four posted themselves to oppose our"
4136,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"further passage.  There was no turning to the right or left, for the"
4137,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rugged banks effectually opposed all exit, in some parts completely"
4138,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"overhanging the glen, and, outnumbered as we were, ours was but an"
4139,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"awkward position.  However, in the excitement of the moment, fear seemed"
4140,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"to have fled, and holding the dog back, we hurried forward to where the"
4141,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fellows stood, taking advantage of every screen which presented itself"
4142,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"as we advanced, for we knew how much mercy we had to expect as soon as"
4143,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,we came within shot.
4144,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4145,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Fortunately for us, the huge blocks of quartz lying about afforded ample"
4146,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"shelter, and we darted from place to place, each minute getting nearer"
4147,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and nearer.  All at once, as I made a run forward to a mass in my front,"
4148,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"there was a sharp reverberating crack, and I heard a bullet whistle by"
4149,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"my ears, but the next moment I was in safety, and then Abel rushed to my"
4150,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"side, but he was not so fortunate, for, as he crossed the open, two"
4151,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"shots were fired, one of which grazed his shoulder and just drew blood."
4152,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4153,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"It was now a matter of regular Indian warfare, and we knew well enough"
4154,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,that if we dashed forward we must be shot down before we could get
4155,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"hand-to-hand with the ruffians, so Abel took one side of the rock, and I"
4156,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the other, to try and get a return shot at our enemies.  It was a mass"
4157,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"some fifty feet in length, and when I reached the end I heard Abel fire,"
4158,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and directly after, he fired again, emptying his second barrel, when"
4159,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,there was a reply of three shots.
4160,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4161,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I was hopeful that, hearing two shots, the fellows would think we were"
4162,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"both together, and taking advantage of some low bushes, I crawled right"
4163,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"to the side of the ravine, and then screening myself behind a buttress,"
4164,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"found that I could climb up a few feet to where there was a ledge, which"
4165,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I soon reached, and was then some twenty feet above the bottom, well"
4166,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"screened by some bushes; and, to my intense satisfaction, I found, upon"
4167,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"creeping to the edge and thrusting my double-barrel between the leaves,"
4168,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I had a good sight at two of the miscreants, whose heads and shoulders"
4169,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,were just visible.
4170,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4171,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"As I looked, Abel gave two more shots from his gun, and I saw the chips"
4172,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fly from the rock a little farther off, and then the two men I had not"
4173,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,seen before rose up and delivered their fire--dropping down again
4174,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"directly--and evidently with some effect, for I heard a dismal howl,"
4175,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which told of the dog being struck.  Directly after, one of the fellows"
4176,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"in sight began to crawl forward, evidently intending to take us in the"
4177,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"flank; but he had been outwitted, and with the barrel of my gun"
4178,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"trembling as I took aim, I fired, and he lay motionless."
4179,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4180,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"In an instant his companion turned in my direction, evidently saw the"
4181,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"puff of smoke, and raised his gun towards where I was; but he was too"
4182,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"late, I already had him well covered, and I fired again, when the poor"
4183,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"wretch gave a wild shriek, sprang into the air, and then fell out of"
4184,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,sight amongst the bushes.
4185,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4186,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I was so horrified that I lay there trembling, so that I could scarcely"
4187,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"reload.  The perspiration ran off my forehead, and my teeth quite"
4188,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"chattered, but it was but for a few moments, for I recalled the scene of"
4189,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the past night, and then remembered what must be the fate of the"
4190,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"prisoners were they not rescued.  I felt that it was but life for life,"
4191,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,and with another shot I might myself be weltering in my blood.  The next
4192,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"moment I was cautiously peering out again to get another aim, and now my"
4193,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,hand was quite steady.  I could see the place where one of the men had
4194,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"shown to get a shot at Abel, but nothing of him was visible, so I"
4195,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"crawled a little more forward, when in a moment there was a sharp pang"
4196,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"in my left arm, so acute that I could not refrain from crying out, as I"
4197,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"started up on one knee; and then I fell again, for, as I heard a second"
4198,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"shot, my cap was struck from my head, and I saw that one of the men had"
4199,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"changed his position, and was a little higher up the valley, leaning"
4200,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"forward to see the result of his aim.  But he was too eager, for the"
4201,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"next moment there was a shot from Abel and the fellow rolled over, and"
4202,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"lay full in my view, quivering and clutching at the ground, tearing up"
4203,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tufts of grass, and gnashing his teeth frightfully.  Then came a run and"
4204,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"a rush, and I saw the last of the four rush up the ravine, running"
4205,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"zigzag, but I got a sight at him, in spite of my pain, and Abel fired"
4206,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"too, though apparently without effect; and then the sky seemed to turn"
4207,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"black, and the rocks around to swim, and I saw no more till I found Abel"
4208,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"leaning over me, dropping some spirit between my lips from his flask."
4209,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4210,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""There, old fellow,"" he said, grimly, as he bound up my arm.  ""Can you"
4211,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"walk?"""
4212,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4213,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I nodded; and seeming to gather strength each moment, I followed him"
4214,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"down into the ravine, where we found that two of the men were quite"
4215,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"dead, while the other was in a dying state, but he struck at us savagely"
4216,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,with his knife whenever we tried to approach.
4217,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4218,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I saw Abel's hand playing angrily with the butt of his revolver, and but"
4219,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"for me I believe he would have shot the fellow as he lay, but I hurried"
4220,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"him on, and we cautiously proceeded for about a hundred yards, but this"
4221,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"time without our dog to track, for the poor brute was lying bleeding to"
4222,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"death, shot through the lungs."
4223,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4224,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"All at once there was a shot from a little gully on our right, when Abel"
4225,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"threw up his arms and let fell his gun, which exploded as it fell, and"
4226,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"then the poor fellow staggered, and went down upon his face."
4227,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4228,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I did not stop to think that the next bullet might find its billet in my
4229,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"heart, but dashed forward towards the spot from whence the shot had been"
4230,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fired, and directly after I was face to face with an enemy.  He was"
4231,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"sitting with his back supported by a block of stone, and his gun across"
4232,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"his knees, glaring at me with a look of the bitterest hate, and a"
4233,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,moment's reflection would have told me that he was wounded unto the
4234,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"death, but in the anger and heat of the moment there was no pausing for"
4235,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"thought, and the next moment both barrels of my gun, held pistol-wise,"
4236,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,were discharged into his breast.
4237,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4238,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I ran back to Abel, and raised his head, but with a sickening, deathly"
4239,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"feeling, I again let it fall, for the expression of his wild and staring"
4240,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,eyes told too well how true had been the aim--the last sting of the
4241,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"dying viper; and when I somewhat recovered, it was to cover the body"
4242,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"with fragments of stone, to keep off the birds, and then, weak and"
4243,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"faint, I struggled on after the two mounted men."
4244,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4245,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,But a change had now come over the scene; the wind tore furiously
4246,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"overhead, while where I was toiling along it was a perfect calm.  Then"
4247,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"came the rain--a few big drops, then a cessation; then again a loud and"
4248,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"furious howling of the wind; then a calm; while, piled up in huge,"
4249,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"lurid, black masses, the clouds seemed to shut out the light of day,"
4250,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,save when they were rent asunder by some jagged flash of lightning of a
4251,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,vivid violet hue.  Ever and anon there was a glare of light playing
4252,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"behind the clouds, lighting them up in the most glorious way, so that"
4253,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the rolling massy-looking vapours were displayed in all their grandeur,"
4254,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"while along the edges, quivering and darting, there was an incessant"
4255,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,tremulous light of every brilliant sunset hue.  Now came the thunder in
4256,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"a mighty diapason, rolling along the ravine, and seeming as if the sound"
4257,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"split and crumbled upon the bare summits of the range of mountains,"
4258,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"while fragments of the giant peal were scattered, and came hurrying"
4259,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"along the ravine.  Then, again, burst after burst of huge, bellowing,"
4260,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,metallic peals rumbling hollow and deafening as though discharged from
4261,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"some vast cannon mouth.  Blackness again, as if it were night; till in a"
4262,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"few seconds came again a blinding flash, displaying the wild aspect of"
4263,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the glen, but only to leave it darker than before; and now again a few"
4264,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"drops of rain, pattering upon the dry ground, and splashing from the"
4265,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"surface of the lichen-covered rocks, then a sharp fall as of a thunder"
4266,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"shower, and I crept beneath the shelter of an overhanging rock, while I"
4267,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"hastily covered the lock of my gun, and tried to load it with my one"
4268,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"uninjured hand, when again came the lightning playing down the ravine,"
4269,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"then black darkness and bellowing, deafening thunder, and then down came"
4270,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the rain--not pouring--not streaming, but in one huge cataract of"
4271,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"hissing and foaming waters, as though, indeed, the heavens were opened"
4272,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,and the fountains of the great deep broken up.  It was as though to have
4273,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,stood beneath it for a moment would have been to be beaten down and
4274,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,swept helplessly away by the waters bubbling and foaming at my feet.
4275,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4276,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,But how refreshing and cooling it seemed as I bathed my fevered brow and
4277,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"moistened the handkerchief hastily bound round my bleeding arm; while,"
4278,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"though stopped from continuing my pursuit, I knew that it was impossible"
4279,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"for the fugitives to proceed, and I waited anxiously for the cessation"
4280,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,of the storm.
4281,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4282,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Once there came a lull, but only for a few moments, while the brilliant"
4283,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rose-coloured and violet lightning played around, when down came the"
4284,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rain again, more violently than ever, as though it would never cease."
4285,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The ravine had been turned into a little river, once again towards"
4286,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which, winding in and out amidst the huge blocks of rock, hundreds of"
4287,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"watercourses were hurrying.  Now it was black darkness, and nothing"
4288,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"visible, and the next moment again flaming swords appeared to cut"
4289,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"through the rain, and light up the ravine with every rainbow tint; and"
4290,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"still came that deafening mighty rushing sound of the waters, as though"
4291,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I were standing upon the spray-wet rock beneath Niagara.
4292,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4293,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I was standing where a weather-stained mass jutted out from the rocky
4294,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"side and protected me from the heavy fall, but from every jagged and"
4295,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,time-worn point around the water streamed down as it leaped and plunged
4296,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,from the mountain side into the ravine.  At some early epoch in the
4297,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"world's history, the earth must have divided in some awful internal"
4298,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"throe, and then imperfectly closing, have left this long rift forming a"
4299,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"watercourse in the rainy season, but in the dry-time merely a stony bed,"
4300,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"with here and there a pool.  Save where the rains had washed away, and"
4301,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"masses of rock had fallen, the sides showed how once they had been torn"
4302,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"asunder, and displayed prominence and indentation at every bend."
4303,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4304,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"All at once the rain ceased, as if in obedience to an omnipotent"
4305,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"command, the black clouds passed over, and the sun shone down into the"
4306,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"ravine.  But what a sight met my gaze.  Already up to my knees, and"
4307,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"teeming along with awful velocity, was a mighty clay-stoned river,"
4308,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"eddying, foaming, and sweeping round the rock-strewn bed, and bearing"
4309,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"with it leaf, branch, and trunk; bushes and masses of grass torn from"
4310,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the gully sides; while large pieces of rock were being moved from their
4311,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"places, or tottered where they stood."
4312,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4313,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I stood waiting for the waters to subside, for where I stood it was"
4314,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"impossible to scale the rocks, even for an active man, while in my"
4315,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"crippled state, I could not have climbed a foot.  But they did not seem"
4316,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"to subside at first; and I fancied that they perceptibly rose, till I"
4317,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,called to mind that I had altered my position a little.  But now there
4318,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"was no doubt about it; the waters were rising fast, and I trembled as I"
4319,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"thought of being swept away, and my helplessness to cope with the"
4320,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rushing stream; while, again, it was horrid to be prisoned there, while"
4321,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the poor girl I sought to rescue was perhaps being borne farther and
4322,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,farther away.  Then came a grim smile as I thought of the vengeance
4323,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which had overtaken four of the miscreants, and then I shuddered as I"
4324,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,thought of the cost at which it had been purchased--poor Abel now
4325,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,perhaps swept from his stony resting-place and borne far away towards
4326,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the sea.
4327,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4328,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"But now it was time to think of self and life, for the water was rising"
4329,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fast, and as I stood hesitating and watching for a place of safety, and"
4330,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"to which I could wade, heard above the present rushing of the waters,"
4331,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"came a hideous hollow-sounding roar, and gazing with affrighted eyes, I"
4332,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"saw as it were a tall wave rushing down the ravine, making the water in"
4333,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"its path foam and roar as, like some large cylinder, it rolled over and"
4334,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"over, sweeping all before it, and the next moment I was caught, torn"
4335,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"from my feeble hold on the rock, and hurried along, buffeting the"
4336,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,strangling waters.
4337,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4338,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Those were horrible moments: now I was beneath, now above, now dashed"
4339,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"half-stunned and senseless against some mass of rock, now thrust down"
4340,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,and held beneath the rushing stream by the branches of some torn-up
4341,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tree.  It was impossible to swim, while even in the stillest water such"
4342,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,an effort would have been hard to a wounded man.  A few despairing
4343,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"thoughts crowded through my brain as I feebly buffeted the waves, and"
4344,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"struggled for a few more draughts of the fresh air of heaven, and then"
4345,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"after grasping and catching at twigs, branches, and masses of floating"
4346,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"turf, I was dashed against a mass of rock, to which I tried to cling."
4347,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"There was a cleft in it wherein I thrust my fingers, and then tried to"
4348,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,hold on by my teeth on the soft crumbling stone.  At first the little
4349,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"projection broke off, filling my mouth with pieces of grit, but"
4350,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"despairingly I again hung on by my teeth, and this time hope seemed to"
4351,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"dawn again within my breast, for I thought if I could hold on for"
4352,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"awhile, the waters must subside.  But as the thought animated me, there"
4353,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"came a fiercer rush than ever, I felt the mass of rock totter, roll"
4354,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"over, and I gave a wild despairing cry, as I was again swept away faster"
4355,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and faster, while the horrid dread of death gave place to a strange"
4356,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,lulling sensation as I closed my eyes.
4357,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4358,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Once more I was aroused by a violent blow, and as my arm was raised"
4359,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"mechanically to grasp, I passed it over the trunk of a large floating"
4360,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tree, and holding on for dear life, I was hurried down with the foaming"
4361,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,waters.
4362,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4363,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The hard battle for breath past, fear came again, and I looked"
4364,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"despairingly from left to right for rescue from my perilous position,"
4365,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"but everywhere ruin and desolation, while the din of the rushing waters"
4366,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,was frightful.  Everywhere the sides of the ravine seemed to be
4367,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"crumbling down, and masses of earth and rock were undermined and fell"
4368,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"with a terrible splash into the stream, growing more furious every"
4369,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"moment, while, wherever the gorge narrowed, the turbulence was awful."
4370,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4371,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Dashed against masses of drift wood, and bruised against the summits of"
4372,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the projecting rocks, I was faint and despairing, when all at once the"
4373,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"roots of the tree I was in caught against a massive stone, the trunk"
4374,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"swung round, and I found myself brought up by the side of the gorge,"
4375,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,where the branches of a tree hung down; and rousing my last strength I
4376,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"clutched them, and drew myself up, till I could rest my knees upon the"
4377,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,floating tree; then I nearly over-balanced myself as the trunk rolled
4378,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"about, but getting hold of a stouter branch I again drew myself up, so"
4379,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"that I stood, and then as the trunk again broke loose and floated away,"
4380,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"I got one foot upon the rocky side, and hung suspended over the stream,"
4381,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"whose waves seemed to leap angrily, to beat me down."
4382,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4383,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,To an uninjured man a slight effort would have been sufficient to place
4384,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"him in safety, but a strange fear seemed to creep over me, as I felt"
4385,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"that in a few moments I must fall from my hold, and be swept away.  But"
4386,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"once more the desire for life came again to renew my strength, and"
4387,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"slowly and painfully I got hold for my other foot, and then crawled to a"
4388,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rift, where a little stream of water was rushing down from the"
4389,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"table-land above, when by dint of again battling with the blinding"
4390,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"water, falling from weakness again and again, I managed to reach the"
4391,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"top, crawl beyond the reach of the stream, and then fell exhausted,"
4392,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,where I could gaze down upon the raging torrent.
4393,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4394,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The pain from my wounded arm roused me at last from a half-drowsy,"
4395,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"fainting state, and then I eagerly drank from the spirit-flask in my"
4396,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"pocket.  I then loosened the handkerchief round my wound, and"
4397,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"remembering that my task was yet unperformed, I examined my powder,"
4398,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which was fortunately dry, and after carefully wiping, reloaded my"
4399,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"revolver, which was safe in my belt, but my gun was lost when I was"
4400,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"swept away.  The sun was now setting, and I tried to make my plans for"
4401,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the future, but a sense of confusion and dizziness seemed to rob me of"
4402,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"all power of action, and at last I threaded my way amongst the trees"
4403,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"slowly and painfully, keeping close to the great gully, and listening to"
4404,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the hurrying waters; now shuddering as I thought of the past--now
4405,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,stopping short to think of the possibility of those I was I was in
4406,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"search of being yet in between the walls of the rift, when the storm"
4407,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"came, and then I trembled for their fate.  But all seemed troubled and"
4408,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"confused as I stumbled along, trying to recover my lost ground, for I"
4409,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"must have been swept back a mile, though what I could have done to save"
4410,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,those I sought from their peril would have been but little.  The last I
4411,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,remember then is kneeling down to try and make out some object borne
4412,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"along by the stream, surging along in the darkness below me, for all"
4413,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"seemed wild and blank, till I was again hastening with Abel through the"
4414,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"wood, guided by the burning farmstead, and watching the black demon-like"
4415,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,figures flitting about.  Then I could feel the dog tug tug at the string
4416,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"as we tracked the bushrangers, and I listened to his low whimpering cry."
4417,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Then again came the fight in the gully, and I saw again the agonies of"
4418,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the man I shot, as he griped and clutched with talon-like fingers at the"
4419,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"earth; and then came the horrible crashing, rushing voice of the mighty"
4420,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"stream, as it raged along, sweeping all before it in its headlong"
4421,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"passage.  Now, again I was stifling and strangling, grasping and"
4422,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"clutching at everything I touched, and then I seemed to be borne under,"
4423,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,and all was darkness.
4424,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4425,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The sun was high in the heavens when I awoke from my stupor-like sleep,"
4426,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"with my head throbbing, and gazed at the brilliant blue sky above me,"
4427,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"trying to recall the past.  I was in pain, and could not raise my arm;"
4428,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"there was a delicious cool breeze fanning my cheek, while bright, fresh,"
4429,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and pure, all around seemed grateful to the senses; but as I lay there"
4430,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"was a strange trembling vibration of the ground beneath me, and I"
4431,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,wondered as with it came a tremendous roar--a rushing noise.
4432,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4433,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"All at once thought came again with a flash, and I shuddered as I"
4434,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"recalled the past, and thought of having slept so many hours.  Then I"
4435,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,sat up and saw that I had fallen within a few feet of the precipice
4436,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"where the stream rushed along still fiercely and impetuously, but with"
4437,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the swift fierceness of a deep and mighty current.
4438,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4439,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I might well tremble as I gazed upon that huge current--a torrent which
4440,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"had risen fifty feet in a few hours, sweeping all before it, and I"
4441,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,trembled again as I thought of those I sought.  I rose to my feet and
4442,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tottered for a few paces, but was soon fain to sit down beneath a tree,"
4443,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and there in the great wild I stayed, faint and weary, hour after hour,"
4444,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"listless and but little troubled, as I sat within sound of the rushing"
4445,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,waters.
4446,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4447,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"It was towards night when all at once I roused up and stared around me,"
4448,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,for it seemed that I heard voices.  I listened and all was silent; but
4449,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"again the sound came, again heard above the roaring of the torrent, and"
4450,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"then I tried to give the well-known call of the Australian woods, when"
4451,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"to my inexpressible joy it was answered, and five minutes after I was"
4452,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"surrounded by a party, half squatters, half blacks, who had been upon"
4453,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the track for the murderers of Mr Anderson.
4454,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4455,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,I learned afterwards that the blacks had followed our trail till the
4456,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"storm was coming, when they immediately hurried back, and the whole"
4457,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"party had a very narrow escape, but though they had struck the gully"
4458,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"again and again, they had seen no traces of those they sought, and but"
4459,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"for my hearing them, they would have passed me on their return."
4460,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4461,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"They turned back once more upon learning my history; and, guided by the"
4462,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"blacks, kept as close to the brink of the rift as was possible; while,"
4463,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"after refreshment and rest, I struggled on with them, hoping against"
4464,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,hope that the two poor girls might yet be alive.  I knew that if they
4465,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,had escaped they could not be far off; and so the sequel proved.
4466,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4467,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"The search was about concluded; and, sick at heart, I listened to the"
4468,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,talked-of return.
4469,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4470,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"""Poor things! they must have been swept away,"" said one of the"
4471,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"squatters, when he started, and ran towards the gully edge, for a long,"
4472,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,wild cry for help arose apparently from beneath our feet.
4473,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4474,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"One of the blacks then let himself over the edge, and climbed down, to"
4475,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,return directly after with the announcement that Miss Anderson was
4476,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,below.
4477,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4478,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"A rope of handkerchiefs and straps was soon improvised, with which the"
4479,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"black again descended; and in a few minutes the poor, fainting girl was"
4480,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,drawn up from the shelf of rock upon which she had been for hours
4481,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"resting; and, after regaining her strength somewhat, she related how"
4482,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"that, when the storm set in, the men had hurriedly dismounted; and,"
4483,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"securing their horses at the bottom, climbed with the two poor girls to"
4484,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the shelf where she was found--a place well sheltered by the overhanging
4485,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rock; and, of course, at the same time thoroughly hidden from those who"
4486,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,passed above.
4487,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4488,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Then came a time of horror, for they could climb no higher; and slowly"
4489,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,they had seen the water swell and rise till it came nearer and nearer;
4490,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"and at last, giddy with fright, the poor servant had slipped from her"
4491,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"hold into the fierce stream.  The men hesitated for a moment, but"
4492,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"directly after let themselves down, and swam boldly after her.  Soon"
4493,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"after there came a shout, and then one or two strange, gurgling cries,"
4494,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"which chilled the hearer's blood, and then all was silent save the"
4495,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"rushing of the river, till voices were heard overhead when her cry for"
4496,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,help brought salvation.
4497,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,
4498,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"Times have altered since then, and I often look with pride at the wife"
4499,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"who shares my home in the wilderness; and now, years after, in spite of"
4500,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"the changes that have taken place, and the safety of person and property"
4501,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"in the colony, Mary never hears an unusual noise by night without"
4502,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,"tremblingly grasping my arm, and listening eagerly, while she recalls"
4503,AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.,the horrors of the deep gully.

4516,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Hush, listen!  Keep it secret.  I am a man who has known sorrow and deep"
4517,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"affliction.  My heart has been broken--broken? no, hammered to pieces--"
4518,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"powdered, till there cannot be a fragment left that has not dissolved"
4519,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"away amidst my tears.  And how was this, say you?  Why, because I loved"
4520,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"her.  I knew it not at first, but it came upon me imperceptibly, like"
4521,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"the pale dawn upon the daisy mead, growing brighter each moment until"
4522,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"the sun riseth, and all is one glowing scene of beauty.  It was all"
4523,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"sunshine then, and earth was brighter day by day in my kindling eye.  A"
4524,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"new life seemed bursting forth within me.  I found charms, where all"
4525,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"before was dreary.  I slept--but to dream of my beloved image, and awoke"
4526,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"but to muse upon her perfections.  She was a doctor's little daughter,"
4527,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"but the taint of medicine was never upon her, and to love her was a"
4528,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"new-born hope.  Yes, I dared to hope--presumptuous wretch that I was;"
4529,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"but by that which casts the shadow of Wilkie Collins, I will name ""No"
4530,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Name.""  Yes, I hoped that my ardent passion was returned--that is to say"
4531,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"that not mine, but another ardent passion was given in exchange.  Had"
4532,GNASHING OF TEETH.,not she smiled upon me? and had not her hand rested in mine for an
4533,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"instant, squeezed it, and then gently glided away, while I was bursting"
4534,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"with the desire to press my lips upon it?  I dared not be too sanguine,"
4535,GNASHING OF TEETH.,but yet hope whispered me that I was loved--that she would be all my
4536,GNASHING OF TEETH.,own--mine--far off perhaps in the future might the realisation of my
4537,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"wishes be, but I could wait.  I was still young, eighteen in a month,"
4538,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"and what were a few years, when so peerless a queen awaited me?"
4539,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4540,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Time slipped rapidly by, though I counted the minutes ere I could cull"
4541,GNASHING OF TEETH.,and lay the choicest of flowerets before her--flowers bought with money
4542,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"at Covent Garden Market--flowers received with smiles, while some bud"
4543,GNASHING OF TEETH.,would be culled and placed amidst the ebon ringlets that wantoned around
4544,GNASHING OF TEETH.,her alabastrine neck.  The light of gratitude would beam from those
4545,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"tender dark eyes when some book, poem, or musical trifle that I had"
4546,GNASHING OF TEETH.,sought was presented with a stammered excuse for daring to bring them
4547,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"beneath her queen-like notice.  Her coral lips would part, and display"
4548,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"the pearly treasures beneath, when I would shrink back timid and fearful"
4549,GNASHING OF TEETH.,lest I should be guilty of a theft and steal a treasure from the coral
4550,GNASHING OF TEETH.,bow.
4551,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4552,GNASHING OF TEETH.,I loved her--madly loved her.  I paced the square by night to gaze upon
4553,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"her lamp-lit casement--content with gazing upon the blind alone, but"
4554,GNASHING OF TEETH.,enraptured if the shadow of her fairy form was cast upon that blind;
4555,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"misery-stricken if, warned off by the policeman, I had to leave the"
4556,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"square, smarting under the knowledge that I was watched.  But still I"
4557,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"kept long vigils by the house lest evil should befall her, and I not be"
4558,GNASHING OF TEETH.,there to ward it off.  But nothing happened: the house did not catch
4559,GNASHING OF TEETH.,fire; burglars never assailed it; no ruffians ever attempted abduction;
4560,GNASHING OF TEETH.,and the two mysterious figures who entered by the front door at two
4561,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"o'clock on the Tuesday night, were her father and brother; while the"
4562,GNASHING OF TEETH.,dark man who went down the area was only the policeman.  But those were
4563,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"agonies until I knew the truth, and was sweetly rallied for my anxiety."
4564,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"But though no prodigies of valour were ever performed by me, they were"
4565,GNASHING OF TEETH.,there ready in my bosom--a bosom which burned to shed its last drop in
4566,GNASHING OF TEETH.,her defence.
4567,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4568,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Months flew by, and then in the balcony one night I told my love of my"
4569,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"anxieties, my troubles, my cares, and then, in the intoxication of the"
4570,GNASHING OF TEETH.,moment I saw not that we stood plainly out against the illuminated
4571,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"window, for I only knew that her blushing face was hidden upon my"
4572,GNASHING OF TEETH.,shoulder as I clasped her to my breast and reiterated my vows of love.
4573,GNASHING OF TEETH.,And she?  Ah! she would be mine--mine for ever; and she whispered those
4574,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"words as a ribald street boy sung out ""Lul-liety."""
4575,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4576,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Oh, life of blisses!  Oh, hours of too-brief happiness!  Why passed"
4577,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"away--why gone--gone for ever?  The moments were too bright to endure,"
4578,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"and a cloud crossed the sun of my young and ardent love, raining tears--"
4579,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"tears of agony upon my earthly paradise.  Doubt, suspicion, hope, fear,"
4580,GNASHING OF TEETH.,all swept across my trusting spirit ere I would give entrance to that
4581,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"fearful brain-enslaving jealousy--maddening jealousy.  Oh, but it was a"
4582,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"hard battle, for I could not believe her false, even though the evidence"
4583,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"was clear as the noon-day sun.  The current of my life was changed, and"
4584,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"from an open trusting soul I became a spy.  I dogged her footsteps,"
4585,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"coward that I was, for I dared not upbraid her.  But the villain who had"
4586,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"robbed me of my peace, for him was reserved the corked-up bottle of my"
4587,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"wrath, ready for pouring upon his devoted head.  I felt that I could"
4588,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"rend him limb from limb, and tear out his false, deceitful heart.  I had"
4589,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"three times seen him leave the house, and knew him at once as a rival."
4590,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"I hated him with ten thousand-fold fury, but still I must be just.  Of"
4591,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"noble mien, of polished exterior he was fitted by nature to gain the"
4592,GNASHING OF TEETH.,heart of a weak woman; and even as I passed him I fancied that I could
4593,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"trace a smile of triumph beneath his black moustache.  For yes, he"
4594,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"passed me almost upon the steps of the house, and then entering a"
4595,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"well-appointed brougham, he was driven off."
4596,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4597,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"For days I watched for this demon in black, with his dark eyes, lustrous"
4598,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"hair and whiskers, and glistening teeth, for he was, in my sight, a dark"
4599,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"tempter, but he did not return.  But I saw something which set my brain"
4600,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"almost on fire.  She left the house morning after morning, and my heart"
4601,GNASHING OF TEETH.,whispered that it was to keep assignations with the treacherous villain.
4602,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4603,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"But I did not upbraid her; I was cheerful and sarcastic in her presence,"
4604,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"while she grew strained and strange.  And I, knowing that my manner had"
4605,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"produced the change, laughed a loud, long, harsh laugh, and left the"
4606,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"house with a dramatic scowl upon my brow, and at last, after days of"
4607,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"watching, I followed her with the sensation of a hand clutching and"
4608,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"compressing my heart.  My temples throbbed, my brain swam, and as I"
4609,GNASHING OF TEETH.,hurried along I stumbled against the passers-by.
4610,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4611,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"At last I staggered so heavily against a man that an altercation ensued,"
4612,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"a crowd collected, and when I escaped, the cab that I had been tracking"
4613,GNASHING OF TEETH.,was gone.
4614,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4615,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Oh, the tortures I suffered! oh, the agonies of my mind! but impotent as"
4616,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"I felt, what could I do, but wait hours until I saw her return, and then"
4617,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"with closely-drawn veil hurry into the house, where I dared not trust"
4618,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"myself to follow, for I felt, oh! so bad--so dreadfully bad, I didn't"
4619,GNASHING OF TEETH.,know what to do.
4620,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4621,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"I returned to my abode where I offended my father, upset my mamma, and"
4622,GNASHING OF TEETH.,quarrelled viciously with my poor saintly sisters.  And oh! what a night
4623,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"I passed!  In the morning when gazing in the mirror, I started with"
4624,GNASHING OF TEETH.,affright from the wretch who met my gaze.
4625,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4626,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Take some medicine, Alfy,"" exclaimed mamma, when she saw that I turned"
4627,GNASHING OF TEETH.,with disgust from my breakfast.
4628,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4629,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Kind, well-meant words, but what medicine would ease my"
4630,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"sorely-distressed mind.  But no, I could not eat; and though hours too"
4631,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"soon, I could contain myself no longer, but hurried off, engaged a cab,"
4632,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"driven by a tiger, who afterwards preyed fearfully upon my pocket, and"
4633,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"then had the vehicle posted, where, unseen, I could watch the door of"
4634,GNASHING OF TEETH.,her habitation.  The hours passed slowly away as I sat gnawing my
4635,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"fingers, and comparing the present tempest of the heart with the past"
4636,GNASHING OF TEETH.,bliss.
4637,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4638,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Go, ungrateful!""  I exclaimed aloud."
4639,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4640,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Where, sir?"" said the cabman; coming to the door and touching his hat."
4641,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4642,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""No where;"" I exclaimed, ""stay here."""
4643,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4644,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Certainly sir, only I thought you shouted."""
4645,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4646,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"At length the wretch slept upon his box, whilst I, wretch that I was,"
4647,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"envied the poor fellow, and longed for peace and rest from the burning,"
4648,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"maddening, torturing pain I suffered.  Then I started, for I saw her"
4649,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"page come from the house, and in a short space of time return with a"
4650,GNASHING OF TEETH.,cab.
4651,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4652,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"She, false girl, was evidently waiting in the hall--yes, ready now for"
4653,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"an assignation, though I had been kept an hour at a time when about to"
4654,GNASHING OF TEETH.,take her to horticultural fete or opera--and directly after and still
4655,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"more closely veiled, she tripped lightly over the pavement and entered"
4656,GNASHING OF TEETH.,the vehicle.
4657,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4658,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"My driver was already well tutored, but he was asleep."
4659,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4660,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Follow that cab!""  I cried, hurriedly, as I poked at the somnolent"
4661,GNASHING OF TEETH.,wretch with my cane.
4662,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4663,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Aw right;"" he exclaimed; till I savagely thrust at his ear, when he"
4664,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"roused up with a start, jerked the reins, and began to follow the wrong"
4665,GNASHING OF TEETH.,cab.
4666,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4667,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""No! no!""  I shrieked, excitedly; ""the other street.  That! that!  The"
4668,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"one turning the corner."""
4669,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4670,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Then why didn't yer say so at first;"" growled the ruffian, blaming me"
4671,GNASHING OF TEETH.,for his own neglect; when on jangled the wretched vehicle closely behind
4672,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"that containing the false one, whilst I pressed and stifled down the"
4673,GNASHING OF TEETH.,feelings battling for escape.  Then I endeavoured to arrest the desire
4674,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"to stay her in the street, and prevent the meeting my instinct told me"
4675,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"was to take place; for I was determined to confront them, and then cast"
4676,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"her off in his vile presence, ere in the far-off Antipodean South I"
4677,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"fled, to seek forgetfulness or a grave."
4678,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4679,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"The cabs stopped, and then I saw her enter the door of a noble-looking"
4680,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"mansion, where she was evidently expected.  What could I do?  In my"
4681,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"impotence I sat for a while madly raging in my cab, for, gifted with a"
4682,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"strong imagination, I could, in fancy, see all that was taking place:"
4683,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"soft glances, clasped hands, the arm of the foreign-count-looking fiend"
4684,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"around her waist, her head resting upon his shoulder, and then eyes"
4685,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"meeting eyes, and her face buried in that hideous black beard.  Oh! it"
4686,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"was too much; and I sprang out of my cab, ran up the steps, tore at the"
4687,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"bell, and then, as if by magic, the door was opened, when, guided by"
4688,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"instinct, I pushed by the servant, and hurried up the drawing-room"
4689,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"stairs.  Unheeding the shout of the liveried menial, I paused for a"
4690,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"moment undetermined before three doors, when, hearing low muttered"
4691,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"sounds, I opened the one right before me, and entered."
4692,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4693,GNASHING OF TEETH.,Will time ever erase the agony of that moment from my memory?  Shall I
4694,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"ever again know that state of happy rest--those peaceful hours, ere I"
4695,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"gazed upon thy false, false face?  Oh, Eva!  Alas! no.  My heart still"
4696,GNASHING OF TEETH.,answers No!
4697,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4698,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"I glided like an avenging serpent into the room, so silently that they"
4699,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"heard me not, and then for a moment I was spell-bound with agony, for"
4700,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"there was almost what I had pictured.  With her bonnet thrown off, her"
4701,GNASHING OF TEETH.,long dark hair hanging over the back of the fauteuil in which she
4702,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"reclined, and her eyes raised towards his, was the false one.  While"
4703,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"_he_, the blight and crusher of my life, leant over her, caressing her"
4704,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"cheek, and bending nearer and nearer, and nearer still--but I could bear"
4705,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"no more: my eyes seemed blinded with fury, and to be starting out of"
4706,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"their sockets; my brain burned; and with one wild, hoarse cry of"
4707,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Fiend,"" Nemesis-like I launched myself upon him."
4708,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4709,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"In a moment, with a cry of dread, he wrenched himself round and"
4710,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"confronted me with his ashen face, but with a wild ""Ha! ha!""  I had him"
4711,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"by the throat, and we wrestled here and there, tumbling the rich"
4712,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"furniture in every direction, till, with almost superhuman strength, I"
4713,GNASHING OF TEETH.,dashed his head through the pier-glass behind him.
4714,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4715,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"There was a fearful crash, and the wretched woman shrieked aloud; but I"
4716,GNASHING OF TEETH.,was deaf to her cries as she implored me to spare him.  I laughed again
4717,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"madly, and still held to the struggling wretch, till, half strangled and"
4718,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"in despair, he dashed something in my face, when, as it fell shattering"
4719,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"to the floor, I started back and held my enemy at arm's length."
4720,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4721,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Aghast I gazed upon Eva, but she covered her face with her hands, and"
4722,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"tried to swoon, as she sank in a heap upon the floor.  But I had seen"
4723,GNASHING OF TEETH.,all--all in that horribly-distorted mouth.  A fearful light had flashed
4724,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"across my brain, and, as servants came hurrying into the room, I thrust"
4725,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"my enemy from me, and parting the people at the door, darted down the"
4726,GNASHING OF TEETH.,stairs and fled for my life.
4727,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4728,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"Forgetful of the waiting cab, I was tearing along the pave, when the"
4729,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"driver, fearful for his fare, galloped his wretched knacker after me,"
4730,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"and then I staggered in, and sunk back amongst the hard cushions, ready"
4731,GNASHING OF TEETH.,almost to heap the dirty straw from beneath my feet upon my wretched
4732,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"head, but still I could hear the sympathising words of the cabby as he"
4733,GNASHING OF TEETH.,closed the door.
4734,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4735,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"""Pore chap, it must ha' been a scrauntch."""
4736,GNASHING OF TEETH.,
4737,GNASHING OF TEETH.,For he knew where I had been--where I had seen all--all in that fearful
4738,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"moment--the gnashing teeth which lay at my feet, the man's face, Eva's"
4739,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"distorted, mumbling mouth; and I had fled, never to see her more--never"
4740,GNASHING OF TEETH.,to know rest for the aching misery within my heart.  Alas!  I had seen
4741,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"all, and oh! cabby, faithful charioteer, 'twas indeed an awful"
4742,GNASHING OF TEETH.,"scrauntch, for my fancied rival was Michael Angelo Raphael, the Dentist."

4952,SPUN YARN.,
4953,SPUN YARN.,"Uncle Joe ran away to sea when quite a boy, and he had served enough"
4954,SPUN YARN.,"years in the Royal Navy to have been an admiral, but what with our"
4955,SPUN YARN.,"scheme of promotion, and some want of ability on the old fellow's part,"
4956,SPUN YARN.,"he was a first-rate able seaman, but he never got a step farther.  One"
4957,SPUN YARN.,"can always picture him in his blue trousers and loose guernsey, with its"
4958,SPUN YARN.,"wide turn-down collar, his cap set right back on his head, and the name"
4959,SPUN YARN.,"of his ship on the band, in gilt letters, while his big clasp-knife hung"
4960,SPUN YARN.,"by the white lanyard round his waist.  Clean, neat, and active, the"
4961,SPUN YARN.,"sinewy old chap came rolling in after my father; neck open, eyes bright,"
4962,SPUN YARN.,and face shining and good-humoured.
4963,SPUN YARN.,
4964,SPUN YARN.,"""Cold, cold, cold,"" said my father, entering the room where we were"
4965,SPUN YARN.,"clustered round the fire.  ""Freezes sharp; and, bless my heart, there's"

4967,SPUN YARN.,"gentleman, who had just been round the farmyard for the last time that"
4968,SPUN YARN.,"night, went back into the passage and rubbed off the snow, while Uncle"
4969,SPUN YARN.,"Joe, chuckling and laughing, walked up to the fireplace and scraped his"
4970,SPUN YARN.,"shoes on the front bar, so that the pieces of hard snow began sputtering"
4971,SPUN YARN.,and cissing as they fell in the fire.
4972,SPUN YARN.,
4973,SPUN YARN.,"""Cold?"" said Uncle Joe, filling his pipe, and then shutting his brass"
4974,SPUN YARN.,"tobacco-box with a snap; ""Cold? 'taint cold a bit, no more nor that's"
4975,SPUN YARN.,"hot,"" and then, stooping down, he thrust a finger and thumb in between"
4976,SPUN YARN.,"the bottom bars, caught hold of a piece of glowing coal and laid it upon"
4977,SPUN YARN.,"the bowl of his pipe, which means soon ignited the tobacco within.  ""My"
4978,SPUN YARN.,"hands are hard enough for anything,"" he growled, taking the place made"
4979,SPUN YARN.,"for him beside the fire, when he tucked his cap beneath the chair, and"
4980,SPUN YARN.,"then took one leg upon his knee, and nursed it as he smoked for awhile"
4981,SPUN YARN.,in silence.
4982,SPUN YARN.,
4983,SPUN YARN.,"""Now, come, Christmas-night,"" cried my father, ""and you're all as quiet"
4984,SPUN YARN.,"as so many mice.  What's it to be, Joe--the old thing?"""
4985,SPUN YARN.,
4986,SPUN YARN.,"""Well, yes,"" growled my uncle; ""I won't say no to a tot o' grog,"" and"
4987,SPUN YARN.,"then he smoked on abstractedly, while my father mixed for the wanderer"
4988,SPUN YARN.,whom he had not seen for five years.
4989,SPUN YARN.,
4990,SPUN YARN.,"""Wish to goodness I'd brought a hammock,"" said my uncle, at last.  ""I"
4991,SPUN YARN.,"did try whether I couldn't lash the curtains together last night, but"
4992,SPUN YARN.,"they're too weak."""
4993,SPUN YARN.,
4994,SPUN YARN.,"""I should think so, indeed,"" exclaimed my mother.  ""That chintz, too."
4995,SPUN YARN.,"How can you be so foolish, Joe?"""
4996,SPUN YARN.,
4997,SPUN YARN.,"My uncle smoked on, apparently thinking with great disgust of the"
4998,SPUN YARN.,"comfortably-furnished bedroom in which he had to sleep, as compared with"
4999,SPUN YARN.,the main-deck of his frigate.
5000,SPUN YARN.,
5001,SPUN YARN.,"""But 'taint cold,"" he all at once burst out."
5002,SPUN YARN.,
5003,SPUN YARN.,"""Three or four degrees of frost, at all events,"" said my father."
5004,SPUN YARN.,
5005,SPUN YARN.,"""Pooh; what's that?"" said my uncle.  ""That's hot weather, that is.  How"
5006,SPUN YARN.,should you like to sleep where yours and your mate's breath all turns
5007,SPUN YARN.,"into a fall of snow, and comes tumbling on to you?  How should you like"
5008,SPUN YARN.,"to nibble your rum as if it was sugar-candy, and never touch nothing of"
5009,SPUN YARN.,"iron for fear of burning your fingers like, and leaving all the skin"
5010,SPUN YARN.,"behind?  This ain't cold."""
5011,SPUN YARN.,
5012,SPUN YARN.,"""Here, draw round close,"" cried my father; ""throw on another log or two,"
5013,SPUN YARN.,"and Uncle Joe will spin you a yarn."""
5014,SPUN YARN.,
5015,SPUN YARN.,"The fire was replenished, and as the many-hued flames leaped and danced,"
5016,SPUN YARN.,"and the sparks flew up the chimney, every face was lit up with the"
5017,SPUN YARN.,"golden glow.  The wind roared round the house, and sung in the chimney,"
5018,SPUN YARN.,"but the red curtains were closely-drawn, the table was well spread with"
5019,SPUN YARN.,"those creature comforts so oft seen at the genial season, and closing"
5020,SPUN YARN.,tightly in--chair against chair--we all watched for the next opening of
5021,SPUN YARN.,"Uncle Joe's oracular lips.  And we had not long to wait; for, taking his"
5022,SPUN YARN.,"pipe out of his mouth, he began to point with the stem, describe"
5023,SPUN YARN.,"circles, and flourish it oratorically, as he once more exclaimed--"
5024,SPUN YARN.,
5025,SPUN YARN.,"""'Taint cold; not a bit!  How should you like to spend Christmas up"
5026,SPUN YARN.,"close aside the North Pole?"""
5027,SPUN YARN.,
5028,SPUN YARN.,"No one answering with anything further than a shiver, the old tar went"
5029,SPUN YARN.,on:--
5030,SPUN YARN.,
5031,SPUN YARN.,"""I can't spin yarns, I can't, for I allus gets things in a tangle and"
5032,SPUN YARN.,"can't find the ends again, but I'll tell you about going up after Sir"
5033,SPUN YARN.,"John Franklin."""
5034,SPUN YARN.,
5035,SPUN YARN.,"""Hear, hear!"" said my father, and Uncle Joe tasted his grog, and then"
5036,SPUN YARN.,"winked very solemnly at my father, as much as to say ""That's it exact."""
5037,SPUN YARN.,
5038,SPUN YARN.,"""Little more rum?"" hinted my father.  Uncle Joe winked with his other"
5039,SPUN YARN.,eye and shook his head and went on:--
5040,SPUN YARN.,
5041,SPUN YARN.,"""You see, ours was a strong-built ship, fitted out on purpose for the"
5042,SPUN YARN.,"North seas, and what we had to do was to go right up as far nor'ard as"
5043,SPUN YARN.,"we could get, and leave depots of preserved meats, and spirits, and"
5044,SPUN YARN.,"blankets, and pemmican, and all sorts of necessaries, at different"
5045,SPUN YARN.,places where it was likely that the party might reach; and to mark these
5046,SPUN YARN.,"spots we had to build up cairns of stones, so that they might be seen."
5047,SPUN YARN.,"Well, we'd got as far as our captain thought it prudent to go, for we"
5048,SPUN YARN.,"were back'ard in the year, in consequence of the ice having been very"
5049,SPUN YARN.,"late before it broke up that year, and hindering us a good deal; and now"
5050,SPUN YARN.,"that we had landed all as was necessary, and built up the last cairn,"
5051,SPUN YARN.,"the captain says to the officers, he says, `We'll go back now, or we"
5052,SPUN YARN.,shall be shut in for the winter.'
5053,SPUN YARN.,
5054,SPUN YARN.,"""'Twasn't so late in the autumn, and no doubt you were having nice warm"
5055,SPUN YARN.,"weather, but things began looking precious winterly round about us."
5056,SPUN YARN.,"Great icebergs were floating about, and fogs would hang round them."
5057,SPUN YARN.,"Snowstorms would come on, with snow with such sharp edges that it would"
5058,SPUN YARN.,seem a'most to cut your ears off.  The shrouds and clews and sheets
5059,SPUN YARN.,"would be all stiff and covered with ice, while, as to the sails, they"
5060,SPUN YARN.,"were like so much board, and it got to be tough work up aloft."
5061,SPUN YARN.,
5062,SPUN YARN.,"""`Cold this here,' I says to a shipmet.  `Pooh,' he says, `this ain't"
5063,SPUN YARN.,nothing yet.'  Nor more it warn't nothing at all; and there we were
5064,SPUN YARN.,"going along as well as we could, with double lookouts, and plenty of"
5065,SPUN YARN.,"need for them to use their eyes, for we might have been crash on to an"
5066,SPUN YARN.,iceberg ten times over.  Captain used to shake his head and look
5067,SPUN YARN.,"serious, and enough to make him, with all his responsibility, and all of"
5068,SPUN YARN.,us looking up to him to take care of us; and last of all we seemed to be
5069,SPUN YARN.,"right in the thick of it, with the ice-pack all around, and ice and"
5070,SPUN YARN.,"snow, ice and snow everywhere, and us just gently sailing along a narrow"
5071,SPUN YARN.,"open channel of blue water, sometimes going east, sometimes west, just"
5072,SPUN YARN.,"as it happened.  Sometimes a little more wind would spring up, and the"
5073,SPUN YARN.,"pack opened a bit, and made fresh channels, so that we got on; then the"
5074,SPUN YARN.,"wind would drop, and the loose ice close round us, so that we hardly"
5075,SPUN YARN.,"moved, and at last one morning when I turns out, we were froze in."
5076,SPUN YARN.,
5077,SPUN YARN.,"""But not hard stuck, you know; for we soon had that ice broken, and got"
5078,SPUN YARN.,"hauling along by fixing ice-anchors, and then pulling at the cable; but"
5079,SPUN YARN.,"our captain only did it by way of duty, and trying to the very last to"
5080,SPUN YARN.,get free; for his orders were not to winter up there if he could help
5081,SPUN YARN.,"it.  But there we were next morning tighter in than ever, with the ship"
5082,SPUN YARN.,"creaking and groaning at the pressure upon her ribs, and the ice"
5083,SPUN YARN.,"tightening her up more and more, till at last if she weren't lifted"
5084,SPUN YARN.,"right up ever so many foot, and hung over all on one side, so as we had"
5085,SPUN YARN.,cables and anchors out into the ice to make sure as she didn't capsize.
5086,SPUN YARN.,"But there was no capsize in her; and there she sat, all on the careen,"
5087,SPUN YARN.,"just as if she was mounting a big wave; and so she was, only it was"
5088,SPUN YARN.,solid.
5089,SPUN YARN.,
5090,SPUN YARN.,"""Days went by, and the sun got lower and lower, and the weather colder"
5091,SPUN YARN.,"and colder.  Sometimes we'd see flocks of birds going south, then a herd"
5092,SPUN YARN.,"or two of deer, and once or twice we saw a bear, but they fought very"
5093,SPUN YARN.,"shy of us; and, last of all, the captain seeing that we must make the"
5094,SPUN YARN.,"best of our winter quarters, set us to work unbending sails, striking"
5095,SPUN YARN.,"masts, and lowering spars on deck, and then the stuff was had up, and"
5096,SPUN YARN.,"the deck regularly roofed in, so as to make a snug house of the ship."
5097,SPUN YARN.,"Stoves were rigged, snow hauled up round the hull, steps made up to the"
5098,SPUN YARN.,"side, and one way or another all looked so jolly, that I began to reckon"
5099,SPUN YARN.,"on spending my Christmas out in the polar regions.  Then, too, extra"
5100,SPUN YARN.,"clothes were sarved out, and gloves, and masks, and fur caps; and one"
5101,SPUN YARN.,"way and another we got to make such stuffed mummies of ourselves, that a"
5102,SPUN YARN.,rare lot of joking went on.
5103,SPUN YARN.,
5104,SPUN YARN.,"""`Wait a bit,' says my mate, `it'll be colder yet;' and so it was,"
5105,SPUN YARN.,"colder and colder, till I couldn't have believed it possible that it"
5106,SPUN YARN.,"could be a bit worse.  But it could, though; for, before the winter was"
5107,SPUN YARN.,"over, there's been times when if a man went outside the vessel the cold"
5108,SPUN YARN.,"would have cut him down dead almost in a moment, and he not able to help"
5109,SPUN YARN.,"himself.  Why, as I told you, down on the main-deck, the breath used to"
5110,SPUN YARN.,"turn into a reg'lar fall of snow, and everything would freeze hard in"
5111,SPUN YARN.,"spite of the roaring fires we kept up; and only think of it, just at"
5112,SPUN YARN.,"this time it was always dark, for the sun had gone lower and lower, till"
5113,SPUN YARN.,"at last he had not risen at all, and it was one long, dreary night, with"
5114,SPUN YARN.,every star seeming to shoot bright icy arrows at you to cut you down.
5115,SPUN YARN.,
5116,SPUN YARN.,"""The captain used to do all he could to cheer us up, and keep the"
5117,SPUN YARN.,horrors off; for you know they will come out there when you're all in
5118,SPUN YARN.,"the dark and half froze, and wondering whether you'll see home any more."
5119,SPUN YARN.,"Sometimes it would be exercise, sometimes a bit of a play, or"
5120,SPUN YARN.,"skylarking.  Then one officer or another would read, and we'd have have"
5121,SPUN YARN.,"some music or yarn-spinning, and altogether we were very sociable; and"
5122,SPUN YARN.,"so matters went on till it got to be Christmas-day."""
5123,SPUN YARN.,
5124,SPUN YARN.,In whose honour Uncle Joe treated himself to a hearty libation from his
5125,SPUN YARN.,steaming tumbler.
5126,SPUN YARN.,
5127,SPUN YARN.,"""--Christmas-day,"" said my uncle, ""and _pro_ceedings were made for a"

5129,SPUN YARN.,
5130,SPUN YARN.,"""Well, the officers made themselves very sociable, and the grog went"
5131,SPUN YARN.,"round.  Some chaps danced, others smoked, and one way and another things"
5132,SPUN YARN.,went on jolly; but though the little stoves roared till they got
5133,SPUN YARN.,"red-hot, yet there was a regular fog down between decks, while the"
5134,SPUN YARN.,captain said that it was about the coldest day we had had yet.
5135,SPUN YARN.,
5136,SPUN YARN.,"""Towards night it seemed to come on awful all at once, and first one and"
5137,SPUN YARN.,"then another chap began shivering and twisting up his shoulders, and"

5139,SPUN YARN.,"slip up on deck, where I heard him shout out."

5141,SPUN YARN.,"""A dozen of us scrambled up on the covered-in deck, feeling cut in two"
5142,SPUN YARN.,"with the icy wind that came down, and then we found as the door out of"
5143,SPUN YARN.,"the bulwarks, and fitted in at the side, had been left open by some"
5144,SPUN YARN.,one--a door you know that just about this time used to mostly have a man
5145,SPUN YARN.,"aside it, and when our chaps went to the little ice-observatory it used"
5146,SPUN YARN.,to be banged to after 'em directly; while if it had been left open but
5147,SPUN YARN.,"one night, I daresay some on us wouldn't have woke up any more."
5148,SPUN YARN.,
5149,SPUN YARN.,"""`Who's gone out?' cries the captain, and then the men begins looking"
5150,SPUN YARN.,"from one to the other, but no one answered."
5151,SPUN YARN.,
5152,SPUN YARN.,"""`Where's Joe Perry,' shouts out some one in front of me.  `It's Joe"
5153,SPUN YARN.,Perry as is gone.'
5154,SPUN YARN.,
5155,SPUN YARN.,"""`You're a--something,' I was going to say, but I was that vexed I"
5156,SPUN YARN.,"didn't say it; but, forgetting all about the officers, I gives my"
5157,SPUN YARN.,"gentleman such a cuff on the ear, as sent him staggering; when instead"
5158,SPUN YARN.,"of being angry, I saw the Cap bite his lip, and no end of chaps began"
5159,SPUN YARN.,sniggering.
5160,SPUN YARN.,
5161,SPUN YARN.,"""`But where's Bill Barker,' I says, looking round, for I remembered"
5162,SPUN YARN.,seeing Bill go up the companion ladder about ten minutes before.
5163,SPUN YARN.,
5164,SPUN YARN.,"""`Pass the word for William Barker,' says the captain, and they passed"
5165,SPUN YARN.,"it, but there was no answer, and then we knew that Bill must have"
5166,SPUN YARN.,"slipped out against orders, thinking he wouldn't be missed, while the"
5167,SPUN YARN.,"chaps were keeping up Christmas, and forgetting that we should feel the"
5168,SPUN YARN.,"cold from the door he was obliged to leave open, so as to get in again."
5169,SPUN YARN.,
5170,SPUN YARN.,"""`Foolish fellow,' cried the captain, stamping about the deck."
5171,SPUN YARN.,"`Volunteers there, who'll fetch him in?  These five will do,' he says,"
5172,SPUN YARN.,"and in a few minutes the first luff with five men, were all ready in"
5173,SPUN YARN.,"their fur coats and boots, and masks over their faces, or I oughter say,"
5174,SPUN YARN.,"our faces, for I was one of 'em.  And yet you say it's cold here now."
5175,SPUN YARN.,"Pooh!  Why, we were no sooner outside in that bright starlight, with the"
5176,SPUN YARN.,"northern lights hanging ahead of us, much like a rainbow, than it was as"
5177,SPUN YARN.,"if your breath was taken away, and the wind cutting right through and"
5178,SPUN YARN.,"through you, stiffening your joints, tingling powerfully in your nose,"
5179,SPUN YARN.,and seeming to make you numbed and stupid.
5180,SPUN YARN.,
5181,SPUN YARN.,"""`Double,' shouts the luff, and keeping our eyes about us, we began to"
5182,SPUN YARN.,trot along the snowy path towards the little observatory.  But he wasn't
5183,SPUN YARN.,"there.  Then we ran a little one way, then another, and all keeping"
5184,SPUN YARN.,together as well as we could for the rough ice we were going over.  But
5185,SPUN YARN.,"there was nothing to be seen anywhere on that side of the ship, so we"
5186,SPUN YARN.,"trotted round to the other side, always keeping a sharp look out for our"
5187,SPUN YARN.,"poor mate, and hoping after all that he would be all right; but going by"
5188,SPUN YARN.,"my own feelings, I could not help feeling sure that if he had come out"
5189,SPUN YARN.,"without the same things on as we had, it would go hard with him."
5190,SPUN YARN.,
5191,SPUN YARN.,"""`Here look!' some one shouted in a thick muffly voice, but we were all"
5192,SPUN YARN.,looking now towards where a couple of bears were coming slowly towards
5193,SPUN YARN.,"us, while quite plain between us lay on the white snow, the body of poor"
5194,SPUN YARN.,Bill Barker.
5195,SPUN YARN.,
5196,SPUN YARN.,"""`Back to the ship,' shouted the first luff, and we were soon once more"
5197,SPUN YARN.,"a-top of the steps and inside, but you needn't think we were going to"
5198,SPUN YARN.,"leave our shipmet in that way, for the next minute saw us going back at"
5199,SPUN YARN.,"the double, but this time well armed."
5200,SPUN YARN.,
5201,SPUN YARN.,"""As soon as we were within shot, the first luff kneels down, and taking"
5202,SPUN YARN.,"aim, fired his double rifle right and left at the two great brutes that"
5203,SPUN YARN.,stood growling over poor Bill Barker.
5204,SPUN YARN.,
5205,SPUN YARN.,"""`Stand firm, men,' he says, then `prepare to charge.'  And then we five"
5206,SPUN YARN.,stood with our guns and bayonets ready for the brutes as began to come
5207,SPUN YARN.,"down upon us, while the luff got behind us, and began to load.  You see"
5208,SPUN YARN.,"he wouldn't let us fire on account of poor Bill, and I s'pose he had"
5209,SPUN YARN.,"more trust in his own gun than in ours, for he kept on fumbling away in"
5210,SPUN YARN.,"the cold till he was loaded, which was when the brutes were only about a"
5211,SPUN YARN.,"dozen yards off, when he drops on one knee aside me, and taking a good"
5212,SPUN YARN.,long aim fired when one brute was only five or six yards off--both
5213,SPUN YARN.,"barrels right into him, and rolled him over and over, just as he would"
5214,SPUN YARN.,"have done a rabbit.  But the next moment it was helter-skelter, and"
5215,SPUN YARN.,"hooraying, for t'other bear was down on us with a rush, taking no more"
5216,SPUN YARN.,"notice of our bayonets than if they had been so many toothpicks, and"
5217,SPUN YARN.,downing two of our chaps like nine-pins.
5218,SPUN YARN.,
5219,SPUN YARN.,"""`Be firm, men,' shouts the luff, and we three ran at the great brute"
5220,SPUN YARN.,"that stood growling over our two mates, and I don't know about what"
5221,SPUN YARN.,"t'others did, but at one and the same moment, I drove the bayonet up to"
5222,SPUN YARN.,"the gun muzzle right in the bear's flank, and fired as well.  Then it"
5223,SPUN YARN.,"seemed that the gun was wrenched out of my hand, and I saw the great"
5224,SPUN YARN.,"brute rear up above me, fetch me a pat with one of its paws, when I"
5225,SPUN YARN.,caught a glimpse of the luff and heard the sharp ring of his rifle
5226,SPUN YARN.,"again, and then I seemed to be smothered, for the great beast fell right"
5227,SPUN YARN.,upon me.
5228,SPUN YARN.,
5229,SPUN YARN.,"""I don't know how long it was before they got help from the ship, and"
5230,SPUN YARN.,the great brute dragged off me; but I know that the next thing I
5231,SPUN YARN.,"remember is being carried into the ship through the doorway, and hearing"
5232,SPUN YARN.,"some one say, that Bill Barker was frozen stiff and cold.  But I soon"
5233,SPUN YARN.,"came to, and excepting the bruises, there was nothing worse the matter"
5234,SPUN YARN.,"than a broken rib, which I soon got the better of.  But poor Bill was"
5235,SPUN YARN.,"dead and frozen hard when they got him aboard, with his gun tight fixed"
5236,SPUN YARN.,"in his hand, so that they could not get it away for some time; for"
5237,SPUN YARN.,though the poor chap knew all the orders well enough about going out
5238,SPUN YARN.,"without proper preparations, like many more of us, he couldn't believe"
5239,SPUN YARN.,as the frost would have such power--power enough to cut him down before
5240,SPUN YARN.,"he'd walked a couple hundred yards, for it was something awful that"
5241,SPUN YARN.,"night, though the little brawny chaps that live in those parts, seem to"
5242,SPUN YARN.,bear it very well.
5243,SPUN YARN.,
5244,SPUN YARN.,"""Freeze! why this is nothing: them two bears were masses of ice next"
5245,SPUN YARN.,"morning when they hauled 'em on board, while everything we cut, had to"
5246,SPUN YARN.,be thawed first before the stove-fires.  But then we had plenty of
5247,SPUN YARN.,"provisions, and I don't think I once saw the grog get down so low, as in"
5248,SPUN YARN.,"this here glass of mine--here present."""
5249,SPUN YARN.,
5250,SPUN YARN.,"My father took the hint, and replenished the old sailor's glass."

5257,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5258,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Now, once for all,"" said Asher Skurge, ""if I don't get my bit o' rent"
5259,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"by to-morrow at four o'clock, out you goes, bag and baggage,"
5260,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Christmas-eve or no Christmas-eve.  If you can't afford to pay rent,"
5261,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"you'd best go in the house, and let them pay as will.""  And Asher girded"
5262,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"up his loins, and left Widow Bond and her children in their bare"
5263,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"cottage, to moan over their bitter fate."
5264,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5265,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"And then came Christmas-eve and four o'clock, and no money; and, what"
5266,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was better, no Asher Skurge to turn out Widow Bond, ""bag and baggage,"""
5267,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"not a very difficult task, for there was not much of it.  The cottage"
5268,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was well-furnished before Frank Bond's ship was lost at sea, and the"
5269,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"widow had to live by needlework, which, in her case, meant starving,"
5270,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,although she found two or three friends in the village who were very
5271,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"sorry for her, or at all events said they were, which answered the same"
5272,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,purpose.
5273,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5274,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"However, four o'clock grew near--came--passed--and no Asher.  It was not"
5275,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"very dark, for there was snow--bright, glittering snow upon the ground;"
5276,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"but it gradually grew darker and darker, and with the deepening gloom."
5277,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Mrs Bond's spirits rose, for she felt that, leaving heart out of the"
5278,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"question, old Skurge, the parish clerk, dare not turn her out that night"
5279,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"on account of his own character.  Five o'clock came, and then six, and"
5280,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,still no Asher; and Widow Bond reasonably thought that something must be
5281,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,keeping him.
5282,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5283,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Mrs Bond was right--something was keeping the clerk, and that something"
5284,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was the prettiest, yellow-haired, violet-eyed maiden that ever turned"
5285,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"out not to be a dreadful heroine given to breaking up, and then"
5286,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"pounding, the whole of the ten commandments in a way that would have"
5287,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"staggered Moses himself.  No; Amy Frith, the rector's daughter, was not"
5288,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"a wicked heroine, and now that she was busy giving the finishing touches"
5289,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"to the altar-screen, and pricking her little fingers with holly till"
5290,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"they bled, she would not let the old man go because young Harry"
5291,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Thornton, her father's pupil, was there.  And Amy knew that so sure as"
5292,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"old Skurge took himself off, the young man would begin making love,"
5293,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"which, though it may be crowned in a church, ought not to be made in the"
5294,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,same place.
5295,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5296,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,The young man fumed and fretted; and the old man coughed and groaned and
5297,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,told of his rheumatics; but it was of no use; the maiden pitied them
5298,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"both, and would have set them at liberty on her own terms, but remained"
5299,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"inexorable in other respects till the clock chimed half-past six, when"
5300,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the candles were extinguished, the dim old church left to its repose,"
5301,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and the late occupants took their departure to the rectory, and the long"
5302,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,low cottage fifty yards from the church gates.
5303,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5304,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No; it couldn't be done at any price--turn the woman out on such a"
5305,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,night; the whole place would be up in arms; but he would go and see if
5306,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"there was any money for him;"" and so Asher Skurge partook of his frugal"
5307,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"tea by his very frugal fire, a fire which seemed to make him colder, for"
5308,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"it was so small that the wintry winds, which came pelting in at keyhole"
5309,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and cranny, all hooted, and teased, and laughed at it, and rushed, and"
5310,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"danced, and flitted round, so that they made a terrible commotion all"
5311,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"about Asher's chair, and gave him far more cause to complain of"
5312,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,rheumatics than he had before.
5313,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5314,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"So Asher buttoned himself up, body and soul too; he buttoned his soul up"
5315,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"so tight that there was not space for the smallest, tiniest shade of a"
5316,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,glance or a ray of good feeling to peep out; and then he sallied forth
5317,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"out into the night-wind, with his nose as sharp and blue as if it had"
5318,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"been made of steel; and, as he hurried along, it split the frosty wind"
5319,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"right up, like the prow of a boat does water, and the sharp wind was"
5320,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"thus split into two sharper winds, which went screeching behind him, to"
5321,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,cut up the last remains of anything left growing.
5322,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5323,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"He was a keen man was Asher; as keen a man as ever said ""Amen"" after a"
5324,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,prayer and didn't mean it.  Ill-natured folks said he only seemed in his
5325,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"element on Commination-day, when, after all the Curseds, he rolled out"
5326,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the Amens with the greatest of gusto, and as if he really did mean it,"
5327,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,while the rector would quite shiver--but then the wind generally is
5328,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"easterly at commination time, in the cold spring.  He used to boast that"
5329,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"he had neither chick nor child, did Asher; and here again people would"
5330,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"say it was a blessing, for one Skurge was enough in a village; and that"
5331,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,it was a further blessing that his was a slow race.  He was a
5332,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"cold-blooded old rascal; but for all that he was warm, inasmuch as he"
5333,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"had well feathered his nest, and might by this time have been"
5334,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"churchwarden; but he preferred being clerk, to the very great disgust of"
5335,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Parson Frith, who would gladly have been rid of him long enough before."
5336,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5337,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,It did seem too bad to go worrying a poor widow for rent on a
5338,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Christmas-eve; but nothing was too bad for Asher, who soon made the poor"
5339,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"woman's heart leap, and then sink with despair."
5340,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5341,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Old Skurge was soon back in his own room, and the wind at last blew so"
5342,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,very cold that he indulged in the extravagance of an extra shovel of
5343,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"coals, and a small chump of wood, and then he drew his pipe from the"
5344,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"corner and began to smoke, filling the bowl out of a small white"
5345,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"gallipot containing a mixture, half tobacco, half herbs, which he found"
5346,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"most economical; for it did not merely spin out the tobacco, but no"
5347,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"dropper-in ever cared about having a pipe of ""Skurge's particular,"" as"
5348,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,it was named in the village.
5349,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5350,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Then, after smoking a bit, Asher seemed moved to proceed to further"
5351,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"extravagance, in consequence of its being Christmas-eve; so he laid down"
5352,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"his pipe, rubbed his ear, and then plunged his hand into his pocket and"
5353,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"brought out a small key.  The small key opened a small cupboard, wherein"
5354,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"hung upon nails some half-dozen larger keys, one of which was taken down"
5355,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and used to open a larger cupboard, from which Asher Skurge brought"
5356,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,forth a well-corked and tied-down bottle.
5357,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5358,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"A cunning, inhospitable old rascal, bringing out his hidden treasures to"
5359,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,bib on a winter's night alone.  What was it in the old black bottle?
5360,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Curacoa, maraschino, cherry brandy, genuine hollands, potent rum,"
5361,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"cognac?  Hush! was it smuggled-up remains, or an odd bottle of"
5362,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"sacramental wine?  No, it was none of these; but it poured forth clear,"
5363,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"bright, and amber-hued, with a creaming foam on the top; and--""blob;"""
5364,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"what was that? a swollen raisin, and the grains that slipped to the"
5365,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,bottom were rice.
5366,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5367,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Then what could the liquid be?  The old man sipped it and tried to look
5368,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"gratified, and sipped again, and took a long breath, and said ""ha!"" as"
5369,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"he set down the glass, and proceeded to fish out the raisin and bits of"
5370,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"rice, which he threw on the fire, and disgusted it to that extent that"
5371,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,it spat and sputtered; after which he let the glass stand again for a
5372,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"long time before he attempted another taste, for the liquid was very"
5373,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"small, very sour beer, six months in bottle.  Another year, perhaps,"
5374,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"might have improved its quality; but one thing was certain, and that"
5375,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was, that it could be no worse."
5376,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5377,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,But Asher Skurge was not going to show that he did not appreciate the
5378,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"sour beverage, for he considered himself quite bacchanalian; and, after"
5379,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"one loud gust of wind, he poked his fire so recklessly that the poor"
5380,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"thing turned faint, and nearly became extinct, but was at length tickled"
5381,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,and coaxed into burning.
5382,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5383,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Nine of 'em,"" said Asher, as the old Dutch clock in the corner gave"
5384,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"warning of its intention to strike shortly; a chirping, jarring sound,"
5385,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"as much as to say ""stand clear or you'll be hit;"" and just then the"
5386,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"clerk stopped short, put down his pipe again, and rubbed the side of his"
5387,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,nose uneasily; got up and looked closer at the clock; went to the window
5388,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and moved the blind to get a peep out, and then came back to the fire"
5389,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,and sat rubbing his hands.
5390,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5391,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Never knew such a thing before in my life,"" said Asher.  ""Never once"
5392,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"forgot it before.  And just at a time, too, when I'm comfortable.  All"
5393,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,that confounded woman's fault for not paying her rent.  Running after
5394,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"her when I'd my own business to attend to.""  In fact, the old clerk had"
5395,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"been so put out of his regular course that night, what with church"
5396,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"decorations and hunting up Widow Bond, that he had quite forgotten to"
5397,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"wind up the clock, the old church time-keeper that he had never let run"
5398,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,down once for twenty years.
5399,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5400,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"It was a rough job though upon such a night, just as he was so"
5401,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"comfortable, and enjoying his beer and tobacco in so jovial a manner."
5402,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"He looked in his almanac to make sure this was the right evening, and"
5403,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"that he had not worked his ideas into a knot; but, no; his ideas were"
5404,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"all straight and in good order, and this was the night for winding up."
5405,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5406,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Couldn't he leave it till the morning?
5407,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5408,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Couldn't he forget all about it?
5409,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5410,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Couldn't he wait half an hour?
5411,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5412,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Couldn't he--couldn't he?--No; he couldn't; for habits that have been
5413,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"grown into, can't be cast off in a moment.  They may be shabby, and they"
5414,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"may be bad habits; they may hang in rags about the wearer, but for all"
5415,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,that it takes some time to get rid of them; and if Asher Skurge had not
5416,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"wound up the clock upon this particular night, he would have been unable"
5417,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"to sleep in his bed, he would have had the weights upon his chest, the"
5418,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"lines hanging round his neck, and the pendulum vibrating within an inch"
5419,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"of his nose, while the hands pointed at him, and called attention to his"
5420,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,neglect.
5421,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5422,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"No; once a week had Asher Skurge wound up that clock; and, ""will he,"
5423,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"nill he,"" it seemed he must go this night and perform his old duty.  But"
5424,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"he did wait more than half an hour, and then how he did snap, and snarl,"
5425,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,and worry the air--the cold air of the room.  He might have been taken
5426,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,for a wiry terrier showing his teeth with impotent rage while worried by
5427,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the attacks of a flea legion; but there was nothing for it, and he got"
5428,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,up and tied his comforter three times round his neck; brought the horn
5429,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"lanthorn out of the cupboard, and then tried to illumine the scrap of"
5430,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,candle at the bottom.  But there was no illumination in that candle.  To
5431,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"begin with, it was only a fag-end--one where the cotton did not reach"
5432,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the end of the grease, and to make matters worse, it had been"
5433,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,extinguished in that popular manner--snuffing out with wet fingers.
5434,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Consequently the candle end spit, spat, and sputtered; sent off little"
5435,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"fatty scintillations, and then went out.  Lit again, it went through the"
5436,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"same process, and upon repeating this twice, Asher grew wroth, seized"
5437,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the offending morsel, and dashed it into the fire, where it flared up"
5438,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and seemed to rejoice in the warmth, whilst its indignant owner wiped"
5439,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"his fingers in his scant hair, and then lit a fresh piece, closed the"
5440,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"lanthorn, and opened the door for a start."
5441,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5442,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Talk about Will-o'-the-Wisps and hobgoblins, why Asher looked quite the"
5443,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"equal of any ugly monstrosity of the imagination, as he went crunching"
5444,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,and grumbling along the snowy path on his way to the belfry-door.  The
5445,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"wind was colder than ever, while in spite of the howling din, it was"
5446,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"bright and clear overhead, and the stars seemed not merely to twinkle,"
5447,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,but quiver and dance.
5448,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5449,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher's journey was but a short one, and mostly along the narrow side"
5450,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,path which led amongst the tombstones and wooden tablets; but he cared
5451,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"no more for tombstones, and night walks in churchyards, than he did for"
5452,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"walks in the meadows; so on he went, ""crunch, crunch,"" on the frozen"
5453,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"snow, never pausing to admire the beautiful old church in its Christmas"
5454,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"mantle, but growling and grumbling, and if it had been any other man we"
5455,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"might have said swearing, till he reached the door in the tower and"
5456,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,fumbled in the big key.
5457,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5458,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Scraun-n-n-n-tch"" went the old wards as the rusty key turned in the"
5459,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"rusty lock; and ""Crea-ee-ee-ak"" went the great door upon its old hinges;"
5460,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and then setting down his lanthorn, Asher tried to shut the door again"
5461,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"to keep out the bitter wind.  But the door would not shut, but seemed as"
5462,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,if something was pushing it back against him; and it was not until after
5463,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"two or three vigorous thrusts, that the old man stopped to scratch his"
5464,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"head, and took up his lanthorn and examined the hinges; when, sure"
5465,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"enough, there was something which prevented the door closing, for there"
5466,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was a great bone stuck in the crack, and it was so squeezed and jammed"
5467,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"in that it took a great deal of getting out.  But when it was got out,"
5468,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher threw it savagely away, for he minded not a bone or two when there"
5469,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was quite a heap in the corner behind him; so he threw it savagely away,"
5470,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and gave the door a bang which made the old tower jar, and the light in"
5471,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"his lanthorn quiver, while just then there was a rattling noise, and"
5472,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,something round came rolling up to him and stopped up against his feet
5473,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,so that the old man gave quite a start.
5474,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5475,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Bah!"" exclaimed Asher directly after, for he made no more account of a"
5476,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"skull than the grave-digger in Hamlet.  ""Bah?"" he exclaimed; and he gave"
5477,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,the skull a fierce kick to send it back to the heap from whence it had
5478,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"rolled.  But just then Asher gave a leap--a most nimble one, too, for so"
5479,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"old a man; for the skull seemed to have seized him by the foot, and"
5480,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"stuck tightly to his heavy boot, which he had driven through the thin"
5481,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"bone, and half buried in the internal cavity."
5482,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5483,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Why, what the--?""  What Asher would have said remains unknown, for he"
5484,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"stopped short just as a mighty rush of wind smote the door, howled"
5485,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"through the bottom of the tower, and nearly extinguished the"
5486,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"horn-protected candle.  The old man did not say any more, but kicked and"
5487,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"kicked at the skull till it was loosened, when it flew off, and up"
5488,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"against the stone wall with a sharp crack, and then down upon the floor;"
5489,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"while Asher seized his lanthorn, and, troubled with an unusual feeling"
5490,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"of trepidation, began to ascend the ricketty old oak ladder which led up"
5491,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,to the floor where the bell-ringers had been that night pulling a few
5492,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,changes out of the five bells.
5493,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5494,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher Skurge crossed the floor, threading his way amongst the ropes, and"
5495,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,then began to mount the next ladder; for there was no spiral staircase
5496,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"here.  Up the ricketty, loose rounds, and then rising like a stage ghost"
5497,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"through a trap-door, the clerk stood at length in the second floor"
5498,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"amongst the ropes, which passed through to the bells above; and here,"
5499,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"shut up in a gigantic cupboard, was the great clock whose announcements"
5500,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,of the flight of time floated over vale and lea.
5501,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5502,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"As the clerk drew near, all at once there began a whizzing, whirring"
5503,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"noise, which drowned the ""tic-tac; tic-tac"" of the pendulum; and then"
5504,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,loud and clear--too loud and too clear--sounded the great bell-hammer
5505,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"within, announcing that it was eleven o'clock."
5506,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5507,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Ah!"" growled Asher, as soon as the clock had struck; ""nice time for my"
5508,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"job!"" and then he pulled out another key, and prepared to open the great"
5509,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,clock cupboard.
5510,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5511,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Hallo?"" said Asher, ""what now?"" and he started back a step, for there"
5512,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was a tiny head and shoulders poked out of the keyhole, and two bright,"
5513,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"glittering little eyes seemed to gaze at the clerk for a moment, and"
5514,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,then popped in again.
5515,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5516,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Asher Skurge felt himself to be too old a bird to be caught with that
5517,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"sort of chaff--he only believed in four spirits, did Asher; and, after"
5518,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"gin, rum, brandy, and whisky had been named, the speaker would have got"
5519,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,to the end of Asher's spiritual tether.  So he put down his lanthorn and
5520,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the key beside it; rubbed his eyes, lifted his hat, and scratched his"
5521,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,head; and then began to warm himself by beating his hands against his
5522,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,breast.
5523,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5524,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Gammon!"" muttered Asher, taking up lanthorn and key, and going towards"
5525,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the cupboard again.  ""Gammon!"" he exclaimed aloud, and was about to put"
5526,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the key in the hole, when out popped the tiny head again, and remained"
5527,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"looking at the astonished clerk, who stopped short and opened his mouth"
5528,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,widely.
5529,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5530,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""It's the strong ale,"" said Asher; and he made a poke at the keyhole"
5531,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"with the key, when ""bang, crash;"" the door flew open and struck him in"
5532,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the face, knocked him down and his lanthorn out; and of course, you'll"
5533,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"say, ""there he lay in the dark!"""
5534,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5535,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Not a bit of it.  There lay Asher Skurge, certainly; but not in the"
5536,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"dark; for shining out from the middle of the clock was a bright, glowing"
5537,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"light, which filled the place, and made the bell-ropes shine as if made"
5538,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,of gold.  There was the great clock with all its works; but high and
5539,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"low, everywhere, it was covered with tiny figures similar to the one"
5540,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"which gazed out of the keyhole, and all busily at work: there were"
5541,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,dozens clinging to the pendulum and swinging backwards and forwards upon
5542,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the great bob, while a score at each side gave it a push every time it"
5543,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,swung within reach; dozens more were sliding down the long shaft to
5544,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,reach those upon the bob; while the weights seemed quite alive with the
5545,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,busy little fellows toiling and straining to push them down.  Astride of
5546,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,the spindles; climbing up the cogs as though they were steps; clinging
5547,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"in, out, and about every wheel; and all, as it were, bent upon the same"
5548,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,object--forcing on the clock--hurry and bustle--bustle and hurry--up and
5549,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"down--down and up--climbing, crawling, and leaping in the golden light"
5550,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,were the tiny figures pushing on the wheels.
5551,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5552,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher Skurge sat up with his hair lifting on his head, but a staunch and"
5553,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"obstinate man was he, and he wouldn't believe it a bit, and told himself"
5554,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"in learned language it was a delusion; but for all that, he was very"
5555,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"uncomfortable, and felt about for the old horn spectacles he had left in"
5556,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,the room at home.
5557,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5558,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""I don't care; it's all gammon!"" exclaimed the clerk; ""and if I was to"
5559,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"say, `crafts and assaults of the devil, Good Lord, deliver us,' they'd"
5560,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"all vanish."""
5561,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5562,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No, they wouldn't, Asher!"" said a small voice close at his ear."
5563,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5564,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Eh?"" said Asher, starting."
5565,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5566,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No, they wouldn't, Asher,"" said the voice again; ""not till they've kept"
5567,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the clock going till your time's up.  You wanted it to run down, but we"
5568,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"didn't."""
5569,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5570,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher stared about him, and then saw that the tiny figure which first"
5571,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"gazed at him from the keyhole was now squatted, nursing its knees, upon"
5572,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"his lanthorn, and gazing fixedly at him."
5573,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5574,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""They wouldn't vanish, Asher,"" said the tiny figure; ""and here they"
5575,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"come."""
5576,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5577,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"As it finished speaking, the little spirits came trooping towards Asher,"
5578,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and dragged out of his pocket a small key, which opened a padlock, and"
5579,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"loosened a chain, and set at liberty the key of the great timepiece; for"
5580,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher was determined that no other hands should touch _his_ clock, as he"
5581,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,called it; but now he saw a couple of score of little figures seize the
5582,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"key, fit it in the hole, and then toil at it till they turned it round"
5583,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and round, and wound up first one and then the other weight."
5584,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5585,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""How much longer?"" cried the little spirit upon the lanthorn."
5586,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5587,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""One hour,"" cried all the other spirits in chorus; and the two words"
5588,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"seemed to ring in Asher's ears, and then go buzzing round the place, and"
5589,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"even up and amongst the bells, so that there was a sort of dumb pealing"
5590,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,echo of the words.
5591,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5592,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""`One hour,'"" cried Asher, at length; ""what's `one hour'?"""
5593,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5594,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""One hour more for you,"" said the little spirit, staring unwinkingly,"
5595,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"with its little diamond eyes fixed upon Asher, while its mite of a chin"
5596,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,rested upon its little bare knees.
5597,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5598,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""What do you mean,"" said Asher, fiercely, ""with your one more hour?"" and"
5599,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"then he tried to get up, but could not, for he found that a number of"
5600,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,the little figures had busily tied him with the bell-ropes; and there he
5601,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was fast, hand and foot."
5602,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5603,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""What do I mean?"" said the little figure; ""lie still, and I'll tell you,"
5604,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher.  I mean that your time's nearly up, and that you have now only"
5605,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"fifty-six minutes left."""
5606,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5607,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""It must be the strong ale,"" muttered Asher, turning hot all over, after"
5608,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"vainly trying to loosen his bands.  ""It must be the strong ale; but I"
5609,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"think, perhaps, I'll let Mrs Bond stay another week."""
5610,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5611,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Ha! ha! ha! she's all right.  You see you didn't make a will, Asher."""
5612,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5613,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""How do you know?"" cried the old man, now growing quite alarmed.  ""Who"
5614,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"says I didn't make a will?"""
5615,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5616,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""I do,"" said the little figure.  ""But don't waste time, man.  Only fifty"
5617,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"minutes; and time's precious."""
5618,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5619,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""But who are you?"" cried Asher, excitedly."
5620,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5621,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Me?"" said the little thing.  ""Oh, I'm only a second, like those"
5622,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,climbing about the clock; and I'm the last one in your hour.  There's
5623,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,one beat off by the pendulum every moment.  Don't you see fresh ones
5624,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"keep going down?"""
5625,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5626,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No!"" growled Asher, savagely, ""I don't.""  But he did though, for all"
5627,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"that, though he would not own to it.  There they were, clinging to the"
5628,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"great round ball of the pendulum, and one dropping off at every beat,"
5629,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,while fresh ones kept gliding down the long shaft into their places.
5630,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"What became of the others he could not tell, for, as they fell off, they"
5631,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,seemed to dissolve in the glow which lit up the old clock's works.
5632,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5633,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"It was of no use to struggle, for the efforts only made the ropes cut"
5634,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,into his wrists and legs; and if it had not been that the rope which
5635,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,went round his neck was the part covered with worsted to save the
5636,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"ringers' hands, it seemed to him that he would have been strangled.  He"
5637,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was horribly frightened, but he would not own to it, and, in spite of"
5638,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the fierce cold, he felt wet with perspiration."
5639,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5640,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""How slow the time goes,"" said the little figure.  ""I want to be off."
5641,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"You're about ready, I suppose."""
5642,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5643,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No I'm not,"" cried Asher furiously, ""I've no end to do."""
5644,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5645,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Turn out Widow Bond for one thing,"" said the figure with a mocking"
5646,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"leer.  ""Never mind about that.  Only forty-five more minutes now."""
5647,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5648,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""What a horrible dream,"" cried Asher in agony."
5649,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5650,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""'Tisn't a dream,"" said the little figure.  ""You pinch your leg and try"
5651,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"now, or stop, I will,"" and in a moment the tiny fellow leaped down and"
5652,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,nipped the clerk's leg so vigorously that he shrieked with pain.
5653,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5654,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Don't feel like a dream, does it?"" said the spirit."
5655,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5656,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Don't think it does,"" said Asher, ""at least I never dreamed so loud"
5657,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"before that I know of."""
5658,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5659,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""No, I shouldn't think you did, but you won't dream any more,"" said the"
5660,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,little spirit.
5661,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5662,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""You don't mean that?"" said Asher in a pitiful voice."
5663,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5664,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""I shouldn't have said it if I had not,"" said the spirit.  ""Do you"
5665,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"suppose we speak falsely?"""
5666,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5667,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Oh, I don't know,"" groaned Asher.  ""But, I say, let me go this time."""
5668,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5669,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Thirty-five minutes,"" said the little spirit; ""only thirty-five minutes"
5670,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"more, and then my work's done, and yours too."""
5671,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5672,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher groaned again, and then gave a furious struggle, which only"
5673,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,tightened the ropes and made one of the bells above give a sonorous
5674,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"clang, which sounded like a knell to the groaning clerk."
5675,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5676,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""How are you going to do it?"" he cried at last."
5677,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5678,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Going to do what?"" said the spirit."
5679,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5680,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Going to--to--to--make an end of me?"" said Asher."
5681,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5682,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Oh!"" said the spirit, ""I shan't have anything to do with it.  Some of"
5683,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,those to come will do that; I shall be gone.  I suppose they'll only put
5684,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"your head under the big hammer which strikes the hour, and it will do"
5685,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"all that, so that people will say it was an accident.  Only twenty-five"
5686,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"minutes now."""
5687,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5688,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher turned as white as the parson's surplice, and his teeth chattered"
5689,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,as he groaned out:--
5690,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5691,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Oh! what for? what for?"""
5692,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5693,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Why, you see, you are no good,"" said the spirit, ""and only in the way,"
5694,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,so some one else may just as well be in your place.  What do you know of
5695,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"love, or friendship, or affection, or anything genial?  Why you're cold"
5696,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"enough to chill the whole parish.  Only a quarter of an hour now."""
5697,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5698,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Ten minutes after the little spirit told the trembling man that he had
5699,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"but five minutes more, and four of these were wasted in unavailing"
5700,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"struggles and prayers for release, when all at once Asher felt himself"
5701,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,seized by hundreds of tiny hands.  The cords were tightened till their
5702,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,pressure was agonising; and then he seemed to be floated up into the
5703,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"great open floor where the bells hung in the massive oaken framework,"
5704,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and though he could not see it, he knew well enough where the tenor bell"
5705,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"was, and also how the great iron clock hammer was fixed, which would"
5706,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,crush his skull like an egg-shell.
5707,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5708,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher struggled and tried to scream, but he felt himself impelled"
5709,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"towards the bell, and directly after his cheek was resting upon the cold"
5710,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"metal on one side, while the great hammer barely touched his temple on"
5711,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the other, and he knew when it was raised that it would come down with a"
5712,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"fierce crash, and he shuddered as he thought of the splashed bell, and"
5713,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the blood, and brains, and hair clinging to the hammer."
5714,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5715,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""And they'll say it was an accident,"" muttered Asher to himself, quoting"
5716,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the spirit's remark.  ""They'll never give me credit for doing it myself."
5717,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"I'm the wrong sort.""  And then the thoughts of a life seemed crowded"
5718,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"into that last minute, and he shuddered to see what a little good he had"
5719,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"done.  Always money and self, and now what was it worth?  He had pinched"
5720,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"and punished all around him for the sake of heaping up riches, and now"

5725,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Thoughts crowded through the wretched man's brain thick and fast.  He
5726,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"seemed living his life through in these few remaining seconds, while"
5727,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,above all there was the reproaching face of the poor widow whom he would
5728,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,have cast out that night homeless and friendless upon the bitter world.
5729,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"He could not explain it to himself, but it seemed that this face kept"
5730,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,him down where he was more than anything else.  There was no anger upon
5731,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"it, nothing but bitter sorrowful reproach, and though he would have"
5732,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,closed his eyes he could not hide from his gaze that sad countenance.
5733,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"But now came the horror of death, for he seemed to see the little"
5734,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"spirits glide down the pendulum far beneath him, rest for a moment upon"
5735,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"the bob, and then as one was beaten off, up rose the hammer, and he felt"
5736,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,its cold touch leave his temple.  Up--up--higher--higher--and now it was
5737,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"about to come down and would dash out his brains.  It was coming, and"
5738,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"all was over, and for that second the agony he suffered was intense."
5739,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Then down it came, after seeming to be poised in the air for an awful"
5740,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"space of time, and at last came the fearful stroke."
5741,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5742,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Clang,"" and his brain rocked and reeled as the blow fell upon the"
5743,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,sonorous metal close by his forehead.  The piercing tones rang through
5744,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"him, but before he could collect his thoughts--""Clang"" went the hammer"
5745,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"again again, and yet his heart did not revive, for he felt that it would"
5746,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,be the _last_ stroke which would crush him.
5747,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5748,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"""Clang--clang--clang--clang"" came the solemn tones of the great bell;"
5749,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"solemn, although they seemed to split his head with the noise, and now"
5750,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"he had counted eleven, and the last blow was about to fall.  The hammer"
5751,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,was rising--slowly rising--and in less than a moment he felt that the
5752,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"blow would come.  He could not struggle, though he was being impelled"
5753,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"nearer and nearer.  He could not cry.  He could not move; and at last,"
5754,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"after an agonising suspense, during which the widow's imploring,"
5755,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"reproachful face was pressing closer and closer, down came the great"
5756,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,hammer for the twelfth stroke--

5764,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5765,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Asher Skurge heard the voice, and directly after he shrieked out with"
5766,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"pain, for he felt something cutting into his leg, and this caused him to"

5768,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"he was regularly wrapped, tied, and tangled with the bell-ropes, while"
5769,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,the clock cupboard lay open before him--the clock at a standstill--
5770,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"probably from the cold; while, as for himself, he was quite at a"
5771,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"lie-still, and there had been some one dragging at one of the ropes so"
5772,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,as almost to cut his leg in two.
5773,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5774,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,Directly after the head of young Harry Thornton appeared above the
5775,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"trap-door, and then at his call came the sexton; but more help was"
5776,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,needed before Asher Skurge could be got down the ladders and across the
5777,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"churchyard to his cottage, where, what with rheumatics and lumbago, the"
5778,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,old man is not so fond of winter night walks as of old.
5779,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5780,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,But though Asher would as soon of thought of turning himself out as
5781,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"Widow Bond, he did not have her long for a tenant, for her husband's"
5782,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"ship was not lost; and after three years' absence, Frank Bond came back"
5783,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"safe and sound, but so weatherbeaten as hardly to be recognised."
5784,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,
5785,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"But Asher Skurge was ever after an altered man, for it seemed to him"
5786,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"that he had taken out a new lease of his life, and in spite of"
5787,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"neighbourly sneers, he set heartily to work to repair his soul's"
5788,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,tenement.  You can see where it has been patched; and even now it is far
5789,ASHER'S LAST HOUR.,"from perfect, but there are much worse men in the world than Asher"

6008,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Tied a lanthorn to a cat's neck, and sent her out in the open, to make"

6025,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Done,"" roared my uncle; ""why run down to the Spinney, or there won't be"
6026,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"a pheasant left.  Here, my stick--my pistols--Here, Dick--Confound--"
6027,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Scoundrels.  Look sharp.""  And then he hobbled out of the room after the"
6028,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"keeper, when warm with the excitement of perhaps having a brush with the"
6029,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"poachers, I was following, but a voice detained me on the threshold."
6030,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6031,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Richard,"" whispered Jenny; and there was something in the earnest eyes"
6032,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"and frightened look that drew me back in an instant.  ""Richard, you"
6033,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"won't go--those men--danger--Oh!  Richard, pray!  There, don't.  What"
6034,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"would your uncle say?"""
6035,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6036,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"I didn't know, neither did I pause to think, for that newly-awakened"
6037,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"earnestness whispered such sweet hopes that, darting back, I was for the"
6038,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"instant forgetful of all propriety, till some one stood blushing before"
6039,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"me, arranging those bright little curls so lately resting upon my arm."
6040,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6041,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""But you won't go?"" pleaded Jenny.  ""For _my_ sake Richard?"""
6042,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6043,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Di-i-i-i-i-ck,"" roared my uncle, and, wresting myself from the silken"
6044,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"chains, I darted down into the hall."
6045,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6046,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Here lay hold of that stick, my lad,"" cried my uncle, flourishing a"
6047,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"large bludgeon, while Browsem grinning and showing his teeth, was"
6048,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,quietly twisting the leathern thong of a short stout staff round his
6049,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,wrist.
6050,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6051,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""All right my darling,"" said the old man, turning to the pale-faced"
6052,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Jenny, who had come quietly downstairs to where we stood.  ""Don't be"
6053,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"alarmed, we shall take care of one another, and march half a dozen"

6055,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6056,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Browsem led the way at a half-trot, and grasping my arm, the old"

6058,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"We were soon out of the grounds, and, clambering a gate, made our way"
6059,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"towards the wood, where the keeper had heard the gun."
6060,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6061,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Confound them,"" growled my uncle, ""that's where that poor fellow was"
6062,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"shot ten years ago."""

6064,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Bang--bang."""
6065,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6066,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""There they are, sir,"" growled the keeper, halting to let us get up"
6067,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"alongside; and now I started, for in the dusk behind me, and apparently"
6068,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"dodging my heels, was a tall figure."
6069,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6070,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""It's only Todds, sir,"" growled the keeper, and Todds his helper growled"
6071,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,in response.
6072,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6073,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""That is right."""
6074,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6075,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Amost wonder as they came here, sir,"" whispered Browsem.  ""Never knowed"

6077,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6078,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Munday's Ghost?""  I said."
6079,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6080,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Yes, sir; pore chap as were shot.  They do say as he walks still, but"
6081,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"there's a sight o' pheasants here."""
6082,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6083,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"It was one of those dark heavy nights late in winter, when the last"
6084,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"oak-leaves have fallen, and every step you take through the thickly"
6085,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,strewn glades rustles loudly.  The wind just sighed by us as we pressed
6086,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"on along a path through a plantation, and then once or twice I fancied I"
6087,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"heard guns to the right, far off behind the house.  But I forgot them"
6088,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"the next moment, for my heart beat, and the excitement increased, for"
6089,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,just on in front came two loud and distinct reports.
6090,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6091,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""They're at it,"" growled my uncle, forgetting his gout, and loosing my"
6092,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"arm.  ""Now Browsem, you and Todds go round, and we'll come forward, only"
6093,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"mind when I whistle, it's for help."""
6094,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6095,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"The next moment I was going to speak to the keeper, but I started, for"
6096,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"he was gone, and on looking behind I found Todds had also vanished,"
6097,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"quiet as a snake, for my uncle and I stood alone."
6098,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6099,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""You'll stick to me, Dick?"" whispered the old gentleman."
6100,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6101,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Conditions,"" I said in the same voice."
6102,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6103,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""What? the white feather,"" growled the old gentleman."
6104,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6105,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""No, no,"" I said, ""but if I enlist now on your side, will you join me in"
6106,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"a siege afterwards?"""
6107,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6108,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Siege? what the deuce?  Why don't you speak plain, sir?"""
6109,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6110,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Well,"" I said, ""I mean about--about--a certain young lady at the"
6111,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Priory, you know."""
6112,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6113,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Confound your thick head, sir.  Why, if you had had an ounce of brains,"
6114,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"you could have seen what I meant, and--"""
6115,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6116,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Bang, bang!"" from the wood."
6117,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6118,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Forward,"" shouted my uncle, and crossing a small open field, we entered"
6119,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,the Spinney.
6120,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6121,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Now, if I were to say that I was brave, the assertion would be a fib,"
6122,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,for I possess but few of the qualifications for making a good soldier;
6123,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"but all the same, as we pushed our way in that night amongst the thick"
6124,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"hazel stubs, I felt a sort of tingly sensation in my arm, which made me"
6125,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"grasp my weapon more tightly, and feel as if I wished there was"
6126,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,something to hit.
6127,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6128,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Keep your eyes well open, Dick,"" whispered my uncle, ""and if you come"
6129,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"across a tall thin squinting rascal with his nose on one side, mind,"
6130,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"that's Ruddle's.  Fell him to the ground in an instant, sir.  No mercy:"
6131,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"capture him as you love me, and if you do take the scoundrel, you shall"
6132,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"have another cool thousand down on your wedding morning."""
6133,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6134,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""And if I don't?""  I whispered."
6135,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6136,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Hold your tongue, you dog, and don't talk nonsense."""
6137,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6138,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"On we went in silence as to our tongues, but with the leaves rustling"
6139,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,and sticks cracking as we pushed on.  Now I could hear my uncle
6140,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"ejaculating; then he'd stumble and mutter, while once I had to haul him"
6141,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,out of a small hole half full of water.
6142,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6143,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Confound it!"" growled the old gentleman; ""but I'll pay some one for all"
6144,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"this.  Open out a bit to the right, Dick."""
6145,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6146,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"I separated from the main body, and on we still pressed, rustling and"
6147,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"crackling along, while now and again I could make out the well-defined"
6148,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,forms of pheasants roosting amidst the low branches of the trees.  All
6149,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"at once I heard my uncle stop short, for about a hundred yards to my"
6150,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"right there came again a sharp ""bang, bang"" of two guns."
6151,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6152,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Push on, my boy,"" whispered the old gentleman, closing up; and then, as"
6153,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"fast as we could for the dense undergrowth, we made our way in the"
6154,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"direction of the sounds.  ""They're out strong, my boy, but we're four"
6155,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"determined men with right on our side, and a prize to win; eh, you dog?"""
6156,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6157,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Oof!""  I involuntarily exclaimed, for just then my uncle gave me a poke"
6158,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"in the ribs with his stick--very facetiously, no doubt; but it hurt."
6159,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6160,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"We were now in the thickest part of the wood; and, after going a little"
6161,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"farther, I felt my shoulder clutched, and ""Here they come,"" was"
6162,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"whispered in my ear.  ""Seize one man, Dick, and hold on to him like a"
6163,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"bull-dog."""
6164,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6165,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,Just then I could hear in front the sharp crackling and rustling made by
6166,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"bodies being forced through the underwood; and, grasping my staff and"
6167,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"pressing eagerly forward, I waited with beating heart for the coming of"
6168,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,the enemy.
6169,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6170,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"I did not have to wait long, for the next moment I was face to face with"
6171,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,Browsem.
6172,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6173,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Lord, sir!  I thought it had been one on 'em,"" he exclaimed, and then a"
6174,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"whispered consultation having been held, we opened out about twenty"
6175,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"yards apart, and went straight away in the direction we supposed the"
6176,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,poachers to have taken.
6177,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6178,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"On, slowly and painfully, with the twigs flying back and lashing our"
6179,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"faces, roots trying to trip us up, and the night growing darker and"
6180,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"darker.  Right and left I could hear my uncle and Browsem, while right"
6181,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"off beyond the old gentleman, Mr Todds, the reticent, was making his"
6182,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,way.  Every eye was strained and every ear attent to catch the slightest
6183,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,sound; but for quite ten minutes we crept on until right in our rear
6184,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"came the sharp, loud report of a gun; and then, after the interval of a"
6185,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"few moments, another louder and apparently nearer."
6186,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6187,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Back again!"" cried my uncle; and then, casting off all caution, we all"
6188,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"pushed forward eagerly, closing in as we went, till we were only"
6189,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"separated by a few bushes, so that I could hear the hard breathing on"
6190,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,either side.  Hard work blundering and stumbling along; but the will was
6191,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"good, and at last we all drew up again in a small opening, panting, hot,"
6192,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,and regularly breathed.
6193,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6194,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Hist!"" whispered my uncle, and we all listened eagerly; but, with the"
6195,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"exception of a wild, strange cry some distance off, all was silent."
6196,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6197,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""What's that?""  I whispered to Browsem."
6198,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6199,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Only a howl, sir,"" he whispered again.  ""Blessed rum start this, ain't"
6200,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"it?"""
6201,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6202,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Bang, bang!"" again a hundred yards off."
6203,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6204,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Come on!"" roared my uncle furiously, ""there won't be a bird left in the"
6205,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"place;"" and away we dashed again, but only to pull up once more,"
6206,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,regularly puzzled.
6207,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6208,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""'Tain't no good, sir,"" whispered Browsem.  ""We might go on like this"
6209,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"all night, and ketch no one."""
6210,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6211,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Why?""  I said, mopping my brow."
6212,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6213,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""That 'ere, sir, as I said was a howl, must ha' been Munday's Ghost, and"
6214,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,them 'ere shots as we keeps hearing's the ones as killed the poor
6215,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"fellow, and that's why the poachers never comes to this bit."""
6216,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6217,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Browsem,"" puffed my uncle."
6218,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6219,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Yes, sir,"" said Browsem."
6220,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6221,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""You're a fool, Browsem,"" puffed my uncle."
6222,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6223,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Thanky, sir,"" said Browsem."
6224,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6225,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""What do you mean by that, sir?"" cried my uncle, fiercely."
6226,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6227,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Nothing, sir,"" said the keeper, mildly."
6228,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6229,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""For two pins, sir,"" cried my uncle, fiercely, ""I'd discharge you, sir."
6230,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"D'yer hear? discharge you, sir, for talking such foolery.  Ghosts--"
6231,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"posts! pooh! bah! puff! stuff! yah!  Forward."""
6232,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6233,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Mr Todds, who was at my elbow, murmured his approval of his superior's"
6234,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"language, but gave a superstitious shiver at the same moment.  And then"
6235,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"once more we opened out, and tramped through the wood, till regularly"
6236,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"beaten out; and, without having heard another shot or seen a single"
6237,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"enemy, we reluctantly retraced our steps to the Priory."
6238,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6239,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"The next morning, at breakfast, the parlour-maid again announced"
6240,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Browsem--for my uncle abjures men-servants in the house--and the keeper,"
6241,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"looking puzzled and long-faced, appeared at the door."
6242,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6243,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Now, then,"" sputtered my uncle, ""have you caught them?"""
6244,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6245,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""They cleared Sandy Plants last night, sir,"" growled the man."
6246,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6247,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Who? what?"" cried my uncle, upsetting his coffee."
6248,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6249,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Some on 'em--Ruddles's, I s'pose,"" said Browsem.  ""Don't b'leeve"
6250,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"there's a tail left out'er scores,"" said the man."
6251,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6252,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""There, go down and wait, and I'll come directly after breakfast."""
6253,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6254,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"But to all intents and purposes my uncle had finished his breakfast, for"
6255,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"nothing more would he touch, while his face grew purple with rage."
6256,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Gout--everything--was forgotten for the time; and half an hour after,"
6257,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,Browsem was pointing out the signs of the havoc made on the preceding
6258,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"night in the fir-plantation.  Here and there lay feathers, spots of"
6259,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"blood, gun-wads; and many a trunk was scarred and flayed with shot.  In"
6260,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"one place, where the trees were largest, the poachers seemed to have"
6261,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"been burning sulphur beneath the boughs, while twice over we came upon"
6262,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"wounded pheasants, and one dead--hung high up in the stubbly branches,"
6263,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,where it had caught.
6264,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6265,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"My uncle looked furious, and then turning in the direction of the scene"
6266,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"of the last night's adventures, he strode off, and we followed in"
6267,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,silence.
6268,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6269,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"On reaching the wood, we very soon found, from the trampled underwood"
6270,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"and broken twigs, traces of our chase; but the birds seemed plentiful,"
6271,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,and no feathers or blood-stains were to be found.
6272,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6273,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""They didn't get many here, at all events,"" muttered my uncle."
6274,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6275,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Both Browsem and Todds shook their heads at me, and looked ghosts."
6276,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,

6278,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"Browsem?"""
6279,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6280,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"The keeper screwed up his face, and said nothing."
6281,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,

6283,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""What Tom-fool rubbish you men do believe.  Hullo! though, here's a"

6286,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6287,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,Browsem only screwed up his phiz a little tighter.
6288,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6289,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Why, tut, tut, tut!  Come here, Dick!"" shouted the old gentleman,"
6290,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"excitedly.  ""We've been done, my lad; and they've cleared out the"
6291,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"plantation while we were racing up and down here."""
6292,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6293,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,I followed the old gentleman to one of the openings where we had stopped
6294,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"together the night before, when Todds, who was close behind, suddenly"
6295,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"gave a grunt, and stooping down, picked up a half-empty horn"
6296,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,powder-flask.
6297,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,
6298,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""That's Ruddles's, I'd swear,"" growled Browsem."

6300,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,"""Of course,"" said my uncle.  ""And now, look here, Dick,"" he cried,"
6301,MUNDAY'S GHOST.,pointing to the half-burnt gun-wads lying about near a large pollard

6575,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"his poor worn face, all drawed with pain and hollow-looking, although"
6576,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"he'd got his paint on and the band and spangles were round his head,"
6577,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,though his black hair was all rough with him a-tossing about.
6578,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6579,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"There was the bit of candle flaring away and guttering down, the wind"
6580,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,flapping the canvas backwards and forwards and coming in fierce through
6581,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the holes, while the rain was dripping from the top because the canvas"
6582,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"hadn't got well soaked and tight, and I couldn't help thinking about"
6583,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,what a miserable place it was for a sick man.  There was the drum
6584,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"a-going and the clarinet squeaking, while another of the company was"
6585,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,rattling away at a pair o' pot-lid cymbals; the grease-pots were flaring
6586,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"in front of the stage, and them all a dancing and one thing and another"
6587,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"over and over again, while Balchin's voice, husky and bad with his cold,"
6588,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,could be heard telling people to walk up for the last time that night;
6589,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"but they wouldn't, for it was wet and miserable and spiritless as could"
6590,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,be.
6591,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6592,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,Poor Dick had been out ever so long in his tights and fleshings doing
6593,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"his summersets and bits o' posturing, till his thin things were wet"
6594,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"through, when he comes in at last to me, where I was nursing little"
6595,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Totty, hard at work to keep her quiet, and he says with a bit of a"
6596,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,groan--
6597,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6598,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""I'm knocked over, lass.  It's like a knife in my chest,"" and I could"
6599,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"hear his breath rattling hard, as he looked that ill I couldn't keep the"
6600,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,tears back.  You see he'd been bad for days and taking medicine for his
6601,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"cough; but then what good was that with us, going from place to place in"
6602,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"wet weather and him obliged to take his turn with the rest, and we"
6603,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"always sleeping under the canvas.  Why, he ought to have been in a house"
6604,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and with a doctor to him, though he wouldn't hear of it when I talked"

6606,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6607,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Can't afford it, Sally,"" he'd say, and then, poor fellow, he'd sit up"

6609,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"laid down, back came the cough again worse than ever, and I've lain"
6610,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"quiet and still, crying because I couldn't help him.  Don't know"
6611,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,anything more sad and wearying than to hear some one cough--cough--cough
6612,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the whole long night through, with it resting a little when sitting up,"

6615,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"And that's how it was with poor Dick, but he had a heart like a lion and"

6623,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6624,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"And Dick wouldn't have the doctor till that night, when he says at last,"
6625,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""you must fetch him.""  I'd been watching him lying there hardly able to"
6626,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"breathe, and sometimes, when his eyes were nearly shut, you could only"
6627,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"see the whites, while his hands tore like at the covering, he seemed in"
6628,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,such pain.
6629,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6630,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Just then in came Balchin, looking very cross and out of humour, for"
6631,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"there was the ground to pay for, and he'd taken next to nothing that"
6632,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,night.
6633,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6634,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""What did you sneak off like that for, Dick Parker?"" he says, and then"
6635,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Dick started up, but he fell back with a bit of a groan, when Balchin"
6636,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"grumbled out something, and turned round and went off."
6637,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6638,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Could you mind little Totty?""  I says to Dick, for I didn't like to"
6639,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,take the child out in the wet.
6640,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6641,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"He didn't speak, but made a place aside him for the little thing, and"
6642,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the next minute the poor little mite had nestled up close to him, and I"
6643,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"turned to put on my shawl, when who should lift up the canvas and come"
6644,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"in but Balchin, with a steaming hot glass of whisky and water in his"
6645,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,hand?
6646,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6647,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Here we are, my boy,"" he says, in his rough cheery way, that he could"
6648,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"put on when he liked.  ""Now is the sun of summer turned to glorious"
6649,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"winter, so away with discontent and a merry Christmas and a happy noo"
6650,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"year to you, my boy.  You're a bit outer sorts you are, and so was I"
6651,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"just now, but I'm what you're going to be directly, so tip some of this"
6652,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"up."""
6653,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6654,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"But Dick only shook his head and smiled, and then whispering him to"
6655,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"please stop till I got back, I slipped out to fetch the doctor."
6656,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6657,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"It isn't hard to find the doctor's place in a town, and I was soon there"
6658,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"standing, ring, ring, ring, while the rain, now half sleet and snow,"
6659,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"began to come down so, that I shivered again.  But I hardly thought"
6660,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"about it, for my mind was all upon poor Dick, for a terrible thought had"
6661,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"come into my head, and that was, that my poor boy was going to leave me."
6662,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,Everything now seemed to tell me of it: the cold howling wind seemed to
6663,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"shriek as it tore away through the long street, the clock at the big"
6664,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"church seemed to be tolling instead of striking twelve, while the very"
6665,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,air seemed alive with terrible whispers of something dreadful going to
6666,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,happen.
6667,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6668,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"At last a window upstairs was opened, and I asked if the doctor was at"
6669,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,home.
6670,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6671,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Who wants him?"" said a voice."
6672,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6673,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""I want him to come to my poor husband, for he's--"" I couldn't finish"
6674,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,the word for a sob that seemed to choke me.
6675,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6676,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Where do you live?"" said the same voice."
6677,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6678,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""At the show in the market-place,"" I said, feeling all the while half"
6679,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,ashamed.
6680,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6681,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""You'd better go to Mr Smith, he's the parish doctor,"" said the voice,"
6682,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,and then the window was shut.  And I stood half blind with the tears
6683,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"that would come, as I dragged my shawl closer round me, and stood"
6684,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,shivering and wondering which way to turn so as to find the parish
6685,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,doctor.  The wind was sweeping and howling along; the snow came in heavy
6686,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"squalls which whitened me in a few moments, while the cold seemed to"
6687,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"chill one's very marrow; but I hardly thought of it, for I was all the"
6688,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,time seeing poor Dick lying in our miserable bit of a bed by the light
6689,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"of the flaring candle, while above the howling of the wind I seemed to"
6690,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,be hearing his low hacking cough.
6691,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6692,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Oh! it was pitiful, pitiful, standing out there on that bitter night,"
6693,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"close to Christmas-time, when people's hearts are said to be more"
6694,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"charitably disposed; but now, though bright lights shone in windows here"
6695,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and there, I was alone, alone, in the bitter storm, without a soul to"
6696,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,direct me or teach me where to go for a doctor.  I hurried to the end of
6697,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the street--then back along the other side, up one street and down"
6698,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"another, eagerly looking for a lighted lamp over a door, or for some one"
6699,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"to tell me; but not a soul was to be seen, and every public-house was"
6700,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,shut.
6701,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6702,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"On I went again, growing almost frantic, for the howling wind seemed to"
6703,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"form itself into cries--wild, appealing cries to me for help for my boy,"
6704,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,who lay suffering in our wretched wandering home; and at last I ran up
6705,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"to a door and rang the bell, but no one answered.  Then I heard the"
6706,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"muffled sound of wheels, and stood listening.  Yes, they were coming"
6707,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"nearer and nearer--they were in the street, and I ran into the road to"
6708,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"try and stay the driver, as I shrieked for help, for I was most mad with"
6709,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"anxiety; but there was the sharp stinging cut of a whip across my cheek,"
6710,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and half-blinded and smarting, I started back, and the next minute the"
6711,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,round of the wheels had died away.
6712,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6713,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Oh, oh, oh!""  I moaned piteously, wringing my hands; what shall I do,"
6714,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"what shall I do?  But the next moment my heart leaped, for by the light"
6715,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,of one of the street lamps I saw a man approaching and hurried up to
6716,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,him.
6717,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6718,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Sir, sir,"" I cried; ""the doctor--the--"" But an oath and a rude push,"
6719,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,which sent me staggering off the pavement to fall in the mud and snow of
6720,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the road, was my answer, and then, as half bewildered I slowly got up, I"
6721,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,heard a harsh laugh and the man began whistling.
6722,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6723,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"I could not sob now, but felt as if something was clutching at my heart"
6724,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and tearing it, but again I hurried along half blind with the heavy"
6725,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"snow, and now once more I saw a man in front, but dimly seen through the"
6726,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,heavy fall.
6727,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6728,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Help, help,"" I cried hoarsely, with my hands clasped together."
6729,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6730,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Eh! what?"" he said."
6731,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6732,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Oh, sir, a doctor, for God's sake--for pity's sake--my poor boy!"""
6733,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6734,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Who, who?"" he said, taking hold of my arm."
6735,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6736,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""My poor husband,"" I said, ""he's dying."""
6737,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6738,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"The next moment he was walking beside me, as I thought to show me where"
6739,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"the doctor lived, and it was nearer the market-place where the show"
6740,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,stood.
6741,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6742,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Come in here,"" he said, opening a door with a key, when feeling"
6743,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"trembling and suspicious, I hung back, but the light falling upon my new"
6744,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"companion, showed me a pleasant faced old man, and I followed him into a"
6745,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"surgery, where he put something into a bottle, and five minutes after we"
6746,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,were standing in the booth where Balchin and his wife and a couple more
6747,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"of the company were standing about the bed where poor Dick lay,"
6748,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"breathing so heavily that it was pitiful to hear him, and me not daring"
6749,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,to wake him for fear of his cough.
6750,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6751,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""God bless my soul,"" muttered the doctor I had so fortunately met; ""what"
6752,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"a place and what a night!  Can't you move him to a house?"""
6753,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6754,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""No,"" said Dick, suddenly sitting up.  ""I'll die here.  This is good"
6755,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"enough for a rogue and a vagabond of a strolling player.  But doctor,"""
6756,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"he said, with his eyes almost blazing, ""can you cure my complaint?"""
6757,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6758,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Well, well! we'll see,"" said the doctor, laying his hand upon poor"
6759,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,Dick's chest.
6760,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6761,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""No, no; not there, sir,"" said Dick.  ""It's here--here--in my heart, and"
6762,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"it's sore about that poor girl and this little one: that's my complaint,"
6763,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,not this cough.  What are they to do?  Where are they to go?  Who's to
6764,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"keep them when I'm gone?  Not that I've done much for them, poor"
6765,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"things."""
6766,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6767,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Dick, Dick,"" I said, reproachfully."
6768,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6769,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""My girl!"" he says, so softly and tenderly and with such a look, that I"
6770,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"was down next moment upon my knees beside him, when he threw one arm"
6771,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"round my neck and rested his head again my cheek so loving, so tender,"
6772,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,while his other arm was round the little one now fast asleep.
6773,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6774,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"And there we all stayed for a bit; no one speaking, for the doctor stood"
6775,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"with his head bent down and his hat off, while the light of the candle"
6776,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,shone amongst his silver-looking hair.  Two or three times over I saw
6777,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Balchin and his wife and the others look hard at him, and once Balchin"
6778,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"touched him on the sleeve, but he stood still looking on, while poor"
6779,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Dick lay there with his head upon my shoulder, and me, not crying but"
6780,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"confused and struck down, and dazed like with sorrow."
6781,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6782,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"At last every one seemed so still and quiet, that I looked up wondering"
6783,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"to see the doctor hold up his hand to the others to be silent, when,"
6784,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"whispering to me that he would be back in a few minutes, he hurried"
6785,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"away.  And still no one moved for perhaps a quarter of an hour, when"
6786,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"through being half blind now with the tears that began to come, I could"
6787,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,not see the doctor come back; and this time he had something in his hand
6788,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"which he made as though he would give to Dick, but he shrunk back next"
6789,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"moment shaking his head, gave the glass to Balchin to hold, and then as"
6790,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Mrs Balchin began sobbing loudly, the doctor knelt down beside the bed"
6791,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and said some words in a low tone at first, but getting more earnest and"
6792,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"loud as he went on and then he was silent, and Dick seemed to give a"
6793,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,deep drawn sigh.
6794,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6795,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Then I waited to hear the next sigh, for all was still and quiet;"
6796,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"Balchin and his wife stood with their heads bent down, and Mrs Balchin"
6797,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"had left off sobbing; the others stood about, one here and one there,"
6798,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"and the good doctor was still upon his knees, and I couldn't help"
6799,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"thinking how calm and easy poor Dick's laboured breathing had become,"
6800,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,when all at once little Totty began to say some prattling words in her
6801,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"sleep, and then as if some bright little dream was hers she began to"
6802,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"laugh out loud in her little merry way, and nestled closer to her"
6803,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,father.
6804,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6805,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"All at once I started, for a horrible thought came into my mind, and"
6806,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,turning my face I looked as well as I could at poor Dick's eyes.  The
6807,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"light was very dim and I could only see that they were half open, while"
6808,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,there was a quiet happy smile upon his lip.  Then I eagerly held the
6809,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"back of my hand to his mouth to feel his breath, but there was nothing."
6810,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,I felt his heart--it was still.  I whispered to him--
6811,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,
6812,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"""Dick!  Dick! speak to me,"" and I fancied there was just another faint"
6813,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"sigh, but no answer--no reply--for with his arms round all he loved and"
6814,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"who loved him on this earth, he had gone from us--gone without me"
6815,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,fancying for a moment it was so near.  And then again for a moment I
6816,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"could not believe it, but looked first at the doctor, and then at first"
6817,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"one and then another, till they all turned their heads away, when with a"
6818,A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND.,"bitter cry I clasped him to me, for I knew poor Dick was dead."

6825,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6826,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Of course they were--the good old times, or, as Macaulay has it, ""the"
6827,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"brave days of old.""  Things are not now as they used to be; and mind, O"
6828,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"reader, these are not my words, but those of a patriarch.  Things are"
6829,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,not as they used to be; the theatres even have not the casts now that
6830,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"they had fifty years since; those were the fine old coaching times, when"
6831,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,team after team started from the old Post-office in style.  There were
6832,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"beaux and bucks, and men of spirit then--men who could dress, and spent"
6833,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"their money as it should be spent.  Gambling, duelling, and such"
6834,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"spirited affairs were common, and really, there can be no doubt of it,"
6835,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,times are altered.
6836,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6837,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,I am foolish enough to think for the better--but then I am only a
6838,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"unit,--and I think so in spite of the incessant mess the railway, gas,"
6839,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"water, telegraph, pneumatic, and all the other companies are making of"
6840,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"our streets.  One cannot help admiring our monster hotels, gigantic"
6841,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"railway schemes, palatial warehouses, etcetera, etcetera, but then we"
6842,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,miss many of our delightful old institutions.  Where are the dustmen's
6843,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,bells of our childhood?  Surely those polished articles in our railway
6844,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"stations, always reposing upon a wooden block when one is at a distance,"
6845,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"but which our approach seems to be the signal for the ""stout porters"" to"
6846,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"seize and jangle harshly in our ears--surely those are not the ""bells,"
6847,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"bells, bells"" so familiar of old.  Where are the organs with the"
6848,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,waltzing figures turning round and round to the ground-up music of
6849,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Strauss or Weber, then in their popularity?  Where the people who so"
6850,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,horrified our diaper pinafore-encased bosom by walking upon stilts to
6851,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,the accompaniment of drum and Pan pipes?  Where the ancient glories of
6852,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,Jack in the Green and Guido Fawkes?  Where are numbers of our old street
6853,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"friends who seem gone, while Punch alone seems immortal, and comes out"
6854,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,yearly with fresh paint covering his battered old phiz?  Certainly we
6855,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"had in the street ""twopence more and up goes the donkey,"" though no man"
6856,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,had the good fortune to be present when the twopence more was arrived
6857,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"at, and the miserable asinine quadruped was elevated upon the ladder and"
6858,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,balanced upon its owner's chin--certainly we had that; but after all
6859,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"said and done, how our acrobats have improved, how much brighter are the"
6860,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"spangles, how much better greased the hair and developed the muscles."
6861,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Look at that tub feat, or the man balanced upon the pole, of course an"
6862,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"improved donkey trick.  Look at--look at the length of thy article, oh!"
6863,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,writer.
6864,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6865,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"It seems only yesterday, but some years have passed now since we used to"
6866,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"lie in bed of a cold, dark winter's morning, and listen to the prolonged"
6867,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"rattle of the sweep's brush upon some chimney-pot far on high, and then"
6868,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"hear the miserable little fellow's doleful ""halloo, halloo, halloo,"" by"
6869,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"way of announcement that he had achieved his task, and had head and"
6870,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"shoulders right out of the pot.  And it seems only yesterday, too, that,"
6871,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"by special favour, our household Betty allowed me to descend and see the"
6872,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"sweeps do the kitchen chimney, when I stood trembling in presence of our"
6873,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"blackened visitors and the smoke-jack, and then saw the great black pall"
6874,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"fastened before the fireplace with three forks, when the sooty boy"
6875,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"covered his head and face with a cap, grinning diabolically at me before"
6876,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"he eclipsed his features, and then by the light of the blackened tallow"
6877,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,candle I saw him disappear behind the cloth.
6878,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6879,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"That was quite enough, and I could stand no more, but turned and fled"
6880,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"upstairs, feeling convinced that he would never come down again."
6881,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6882,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"And it really was but yesterday, comparatively speaking, when, in the"
6883,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"depth of winter, a few days before Christmas, Mrs Scribe and self were"
6884,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"staying at a friend's house in Lower Bleak Street, Grimgreen Square,"
6885,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"close by Glower Street, North.  I had a cold whose effect was to make me"
6886,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"insufferably hot and feverish, and as I lay in bed, somewhere about what"
6887,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"seemed the middle of the night, by which I mean the middle of one's"
6888,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"sleeping night, not twelve o'clock, when one has just plunged into bed--"
6889,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"about the middle of the night, while I was dreaming of being where there"
6890,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"were rows upon rows of lights, through which I was being somehow"
6891,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"propelled at the risk of being dashed against an indescribable object,"
6892,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"while my hands were apparently swelling out to a large size, and I was"
6893,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"in a wild, semi-delirious dream, from which it was a charity to wake me,"
6894,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"I felt my arm roughly grasped, and a well-known voice whispered in my"
6895,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,ear--
6896,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6897,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Are you awake?"""
6898,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6899,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,As soon as I could collect myself and make sure that I really was in the
6900,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"required state, I said, ""Yes.""  But that was not until some few seconds"
6901,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,had passed.
6902,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6903,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Only listen, dear,"" there's some one in the room, the voice whispered"
6904,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,again in an agitated manner.
6905,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6906,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Pooh, nonsense,"" I said perversely, ""I know that.  There's been some"
6907,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"one all night.""  And then I stopped short, for though I knew that I had"
6908,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"fastened the door when we came to bed, I could hear a gentle rustling"
6909,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"noise, as of some one in a silk dress slowly gliding about the room very"
6910,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"slowly, and then coming to a stop, and apparently agitating the robe,"
6911,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"when again the rustling began, and it appeared just opposite the foot of"
6912,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,our bed.
6913,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6914,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""What shall we do?"" gasped Mrs Scribe in a smothered voice, from"
6915,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,beneath the clothes.
6916,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6917,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"I didn't know, so of course I could not tell her.  I knew what I ought"
6918,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"to do, which was to have leaped boldly out of bed, and grappled the"
6919,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"intruder, but then the rustling was like that of a silk dress, and if a"
6920,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"ghost, of course it was of the feminine gender, and one could not help"
6921,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,studying decorum.
6922,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6923,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Hadn't you better get up and see what it is?"" said Mrs S, accompanying"
6924,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,the remark with a touch from her elbow.
6925,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6926,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""I'm in such a perspiration, I daren't stir,"" I whispered.  ""Remember"
6927,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"what a cold I have.""  And how I blessed that cold just then, for to a"
6928,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"man not too brave in his constitution, it did seem such a neat"
6929,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"creephole, for if one is no hero to his valet, one likes to be somebody"
6930,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,in the eyes of a wife.  But still I must confess to a horrible dread of
6931,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"ghosts, owing no doubt to the fact, that in our old house in Pimlico,"
6932,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"where I dwelt till the age of five, there was a huge black bogie who had"
6933,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"his habitat in the cellar, and though I never saw him, I was assured of"
6934,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"his existence upon the competent authority of both maids, and"
6935,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,consequently always had a wholesome dread of the coal-scuttle and the
6936,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"coals, over which he must have walked."
6937,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6938,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""But what shall we do?"" whispered Mrs Scribe again.  ""You really must"
6939,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"get out, dear."""
6940,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6941,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Which was likely, wasn't it, to jump out of bed in the dark on purpose"
6942,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"to attack an unseen form in a rustling silk dress, creeping and gliding"
6943,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"about apparently by the wall?  Why, to have attacked a ghost one could"
6944,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"have seen would have been bad enough, but in the dark when it could take"
6945,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"one at such disadvantage, it was not to be thought of, so I said by way"
6946,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,of compromise--
6947,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6948,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Stop a minute,"" and there I lay listening to the horrible, creeping,"
6949,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"gliding, rustling noise.  Ah!  I could see it all plainly enough in my"
6950,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"imagination.  We were in one of the old houses of the past century, and"
6951,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"here no doubt there had been a lady murdered after betrayal, and"
6952,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,concealed behind the wainscot.  And now I remembered a peculiar smell
6953,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"there was in the place when we entered it, a smell that I could not name"
6954,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"then, but which I know now, from having experienced it in the British"
6955,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Museum--it was a mummy.  There it was, all as plain as could be, a tall"
6956,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"slight figure in a brocaded silk dress extended with hoops, short"
6957,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"sleeves, and long lace trimmings hanging over the soft well rounded"
6958,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"arms; and there she was with her hair built right up, and secured by a"
6959,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"great comb, slowly gliding along by the wall, not on the floor, but some"
6960,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"feet up, and slowly rising higher and higher towards the ceiling."
6961,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6962,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"All at once I fancied she turned her face to me, and, horror of horrors,"
6963,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"it was fleshless--nothing but the gaping sockets of the eyeballs, and"
6964,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"the grinning white teeth of a skull, and then I could bear no more, but"
6965,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"tried to cover my eyes with my hands, but found they did not need the"
6966,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,cover as the clothes were already to a certain extent over them.  I
6967,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"solemnly protest, however, that this must have been the act of Mrs"
6968,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Scribe, for I could not have done such a thing."
6969,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6970,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"This convinced me that I could not have seen the figure, so I raised"
6971,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"myself upon my elbow, urged thereto by the words of Mrs S, who"
6972,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,exclaimed--
6973,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6974,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Do pray get up, dear, or I shall faint."""
6975,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6976,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""I wish you would,"" I muttered to myself, but then, thinking of the"
6977,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"cruelty of the remark, I added, ""or go to sleep,"" and then I tried to"
6978,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"pierce the thick darkness, but found that I was unable even to"
6979,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"distinguish the parts of the bedstead, and there, all the while, was the"
6980,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"noise, ""rustle, rustle, rustle""--then a stoppage, and a sound as if a"
6981,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"hand beat against the wall, and at last the rustling quite ceased, and"
6982,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"was succeeded by a peculiar scraping sound, at times quite loud, and"
6983,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"then dying away, or stopping, and seeming as if it was not in the room"
6984,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,at all.
6985,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6986,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Is it gone?"" whispered Mrs S, and then, as I did not answer, and she"
6987,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"could not hear any noise, sitting up in bed by my side, ""Oh! how"
6988,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"dreadful it is--isn't it, dear?"" she whispered.  ""Pray do get up and see"
6989,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"what it can be."""
6990,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
6991,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"The catarrh had made me so weak, and preyed so upon my nerves, that I"
6992,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"was obliged to take refuge again under my cold, and plead perspiration"
6993,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"and sudden check, and then, with the exception of the grating noise, all"
6994,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"seemed quiet; and I was about thinking of lying down again, when"
6995,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""rustle, rustle,"" came the sound again, and Mrs S collapsed, that is to"
6996,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"say, sank beneath the clothes, while I--well I _didn't_ leap out of bed,"
6997,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,and try to grapple with our nocturnal visitant.  I knew there were
6998,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"matches upon the table, and I remembered exactly where the candle stood,"
6999,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"but I put it to the reader, who could get out of bed and try to light a"
7000,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"candle when there was a ghost in the room in a brocaded silk dress,"
7001,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"rustling about from place to place, and seeming as if the floor was no"
7002,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"necessity at all, for sometimes the noise came from far up, and"
7003,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"sometimes from low down; and at last, as I sat there in a regular"
7004,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Turkish Bath, minus the shampooing, it seemed that the tall figure I"
7005,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,imagined to be there gliding about by the wall grew shorter and shorter
7006,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"until but a foot high, then a few inches, and at last it was upon a"
7007,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"level with the floor, and then the noise grew fainter and fainter, and"
7008,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"at last was gone entirely, leaving a deep silence as intense as the"
7009,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,darkness which closed us in upon all sides.
7010,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7011,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"With what a sigh of relief I fell back in the bed, and exclaimed--"
7012,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7013,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""She's gone?"""
7014,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7015,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Then get up and light the candle, dear,"" exclaimed Mrs S; but"
7016,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"suffering as I was from catarrh, I might have made myself worse--at all"
7017,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"events, such a proceeding would have been imprudent--so I lay quite"
7018,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"still, thinking that, perhaps, after all, it was but a delusion and a"
7019,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"snare, and that I might be attacked as soon as I got out of bed; or even"
7020,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"if the ghost were gone, might she not come back again?"
7021,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7022,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"It was of no use though.  I fought hard, but some women are so powerful"
7023,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"in their arguments; and before ten minutes had passed, I was standing"
7024,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"shivering by the dressing-table, fumbling about after the matches, which"
7025,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,I could not find until I had knocked over the candlestick and a
7026,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"scent-bottle, and then put my foot upon one of the broken pieces.  Then,"
7027,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"when I opened the box and took hold of a match, it would come off all"
7028,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"diabolical and phosphorescent upon my fingers, but no light could I get."
7029,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,Sometimes it was the wrong end I was rubbing upon the sand-paper;
7030,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"sometimes the head came off, and I could see it shining like a tiny star"
7031,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,upon the carpet.  The beastly things would not light upon the
7032,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"looking-glass, nor yet upon the table; but after I can't say how many"
7033,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"tries, I managed to get a light, though it went out again in an instant,"
7034,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,and there I stood trembling and expecting to be clutched by a cold hand
7035,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,or to be dragged back.
7036,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7037,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Light at last though, for, drying my damp hands as well as I could, I"
7038,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"tried again by rubbing the match upon the paper of the wall, and then,"
7039,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"though the candle would not ignite with the extinguisher upon it, yet I"
7040,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"managed to get it well alight at last, and then tremblingly began to"
7041,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,search the room.
7042,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7043,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"The door was fast, and at the first glance there was nothing to be seen"
7044,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"anywhere; but I examined behind the curtains, beneath the bed, in the"
7045,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"cupboard, and, as a last resource, up the chimney, and found--nothing."
7046,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7047,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Why, it was fancy,"" I said, quite boldly, putting down the candle upon"
7048,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"the dressing-table, and looking at my watch, which, for the moment, I"
7049,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"made sure was wrong, for it pointed to seven."
7050,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7051,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Don't put out the candle,"" said Mrs S, and I left it burning; but I"
7052,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,had hard work to make her believe it was so late.
7053,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7054,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""But not another night will I stop,"" she exclaimed.  ""I could not bear"
7055,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"it, for my nerves would be completely shattered if I had to put up with"
7056,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"this long.  The place must be haunted."""
7057,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7058,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,Hot water and daylight put a stop to the dissertation which we had upon
7059,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"the subject, and soon after--that is to say, about nine o'clock--we made"
7060,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"our way to the breakfast-parlour, where our host and hostess did not"
7061,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"appear for another quarter of an hour, and then it was nearly half an"
7062,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"hour more before we began breakfast, on account of delays in the kitchen"
7063,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"relating to toast, eggs, bacon, hot water, and other necessaries for the"
7064,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,matutinal repast.
7065,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7066,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""You see, it happened so unfortunately,"" said our hostess; ""but I'm sure"
7067,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"you will look over it, as we wanted to be all clear for Christmas-day."""
7068,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7069,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Oh, don't name it,"" said Mrs S; ""we are often later than this, for Mr"
7070,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"S will keep such late hours, especially if he is interested in anything"
7071,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"he is reading or writing."""
7072,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7073,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""I'm sure I need not ask if you both slept comfortably,"" said our"
7074,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"hostess, ""for you both look so well."""
7075,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7076,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Hem!"" said Mrs Scribe; and I supplemented her cough with another much"
7077,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,louder.
7078,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7079,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Surely the bed was not damp,"" exclaimed our hostess."
7080,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7081,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Oh, no,"" said Mrs S; ""but--but--er--did you ever hear any particular"
7082,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"noise about the house of a night?"""
7083,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7084,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"Our hostess shook her head, and then looked at me, but my face appeared"
7085,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"so placid and happy, that she looked back at Mrs S, who was"
7086,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,telegraphing for me to speak.
7087,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7088,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""No,"" said our host, putting down his letters, ""no, I don't think we are"
7089,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,much troubled with noises here of a night.  I often thought I should
7090,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"like a good haunted house.  But surely you heard nothing?"""
7091,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7092,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Oh, yes,"" said my wife, excitedly; ""but pray ask Mr S--he will"
7093,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"explain;"" and she again telegraphed for me to act as chief speaker."
7094,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7095,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Well, what was it, Scribe?"" exclaimed our host.  ""What did you hear?"""
7096,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7097,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""What did I hear?""  I said, for I had smelt out the rat--or the soot."
7098,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,"""Oh, I heard nothing but the sweeps."""
7099,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,
7100,A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.,Mrs S looked daggers.

7108,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""You don't believe in ghostsh?"""
7109,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7110,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""No, I don't believe in ghostsh."""

7113,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7114,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""No, nor yet in goblinsh, nor witches, nor nothing of the kind, I"
7115,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"don't,"" cried Sandy Brown, talking all the while to himself as he was"
7116,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"making his way home from the village alehouse on Christmas-eve.  ""I'm"
7117,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"the right short I am, and I ain't 'fraid o' nothin', nor I don't care"
7118,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"for nothin', an' I'm aw' right, and rule Britannia never shall be"

7126,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7127,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"And a very nice man was Sandy Brown, the true born Briton, as he went"
7128,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"rolling along the path that gloriously bright Christmas-eve, when there"
7129,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"were myriads of stars in the East, and the whole heavens above seemed"
7130,A GOBLIN DITTY.,singing their wondrous eternal chorus--
7131,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7132,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""The hand that made us is Divine."""
7133,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7134,A GOBLIN DITTY.,The moon shone; the sky was of a deep blue; the stars gemmed the vast
7135,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"arch like diamonds; ay, and, like the most lustrous of jewels, shone"
7136,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"again the snow and frost from the pure white earth, while from far away"
7137,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"came the northern breeze humming over woodland, down, and lea, turning"
7138,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"everything to ice with its freezing breath, so that river and brook"
7139,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"forgot to flow, and every chimney sent up its incense-like smoke, rising"
7140,A GOBLIN DITTY.,higher and higher in the frosty air.
7141,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7142,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"The bells had been ringing, and the ringers had shut up the belfry-door."
7143,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"The curate's and rector's daughters had finished their task, so that"
7144,A GOBLIN DITTY.,the inside of the church was one great wreath of bright evergreens;
7145,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"while many a busy housewife was hard at work yet, even though past"
7146,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"twelve, to finish dressing the goose or stoning the plums."
7147,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7148,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"And what a breeze that was that came singing over the hills, sharp,"
7149,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"keen, and blood dancing.  Why, it was no use to try and resist it, for"
7150,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"it seemed to make your very heart glow, so that you wanted to hug"
7151,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"everybody and wish them a merry Christmas.  Late, yes, it was late, but"
7152,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"there were glaring lights in many a window, and even bright sparks"
7153,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"dancing out of the tops of chimneys, for wasn't it Christmas-eve, and"
7154,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"was not the elder wine simmering in the little warmer, while many a rosy"
7155,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"face grew rosier through making the toast?  And there, too, when you"
7156,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"stood by Rudby churchyard and looked at the venerable pile, glittering"
7157,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"with snow and ice in the moonlight, while the smooth, round hillocks lay"
7158,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"covered as it were with white fur for warmth, the scene brought then no"
7159,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"saddening thoughts, for you seemed only gazing upon the happy, peaceful"
7160,A GOBLIN DITTY.,resting-place of those who enjoyed Christmas in the days of the past.
7161,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7162,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"For it's of no use, you can't help it, it's in the bells, or the wind,"
7163,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"or the time, or something, you must feel jolly at Christmas, whether you"
7164,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"will or no, and though you may set up your back and resist, and all that"
7165,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"sort of thing, it's of no avail, so you may just as well yield with a"
7166,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"good grace, and in making others enjoy themselves, enjoy yourself too."
7167,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Selfishness!  Bah, it's madness, folly: why, the real--the true"
7168,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"enjoyment of life is making other people happy, but Sandy Brown thought"
7169,A GOBLIN DITTY.,that making himself the receptacle for more beer than was good for him
7170,A GOBLIN DITTY.,was being happy; and Sandy Brown was wrong.
7171,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7172,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"And perhaps you'll say, too, that you don't believe in ghosts, goblins,"
7173,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"and spirits?  Hold your tongue, for they're out by the thousand this"
7174,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Christmas-time, putting noble and bright inspirations into people's"
7175,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"hearts, showing us the sufferings of the poor, and teaching us of the"
7176,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"good that there is room to do in this wicked world of ours.  But there,"
7177,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"fie! fie! fie! to call it this wicked world--this great, wondrous,"
7178,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"glorious, beautiful world, if we did not mar its beauty.  But there,"
7179,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"it's Christmas-time, when we all think of the coming year, and hopefully"
7180,A GOBLIN DITTY.,gird up our loins for the new struggle.
7181,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7182,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Sandy Brown had left his wife and child at home, while he went out to"
7183,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"enjoy himself after his fashion, which was to drink till he grew so"
7184,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"quarrelsome that the landlord turned him out, when he would go home,"
7185,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"beat his wife, and then lay upon the bed and swear."
7186,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7187,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Ah, he was a nice man, was Sandy, just the fellow to have had in a glass"
7188,A GOBLIN DITTY.,case to show as a specimen of a free-born Briton--of the man who never
7189,A GOBLIN DITTY.,would be a slave--to anything but his own vile passions.
7190,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7191,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"It was very bleak at Sandy's cottage that night, for the coals were"
7192,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"done, and there was no wood.  Little Polly could not sleep for the cold,"
7193,A GOBLIN DITTY.,and her mother eat shivering over the fire trying to warm the little
7194,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"thing, who cried piteously, as did its mother.  There were no"
7195,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"preparations for spending a happy Christmas there, but poor Mrs Brown,"
7196,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"pale, young, and of the trusting heart, sat watching and waiting till"
7197,A GOBLIN DITTY.,her lord and master should choose to return.
7198,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7199,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""There,"" said Sandy, blundering through the swing-gate and standing in"
7200,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"the churchyard.  ""Who'sh afraid?  Where'sh yer ghosh--eh?"""
7201,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7202,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Hallo!"" said a voice at his elbow, while it seemed that a cold, icy,"
7203,A GOBLIN DITTY.,chilling breath swept over his cheek.
7204,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7205,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Where'sh yer ghosh?"" cried Sandy, startled and half sober already."
7206,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7207,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Don't make such a noise, man, we're all here,"" said the voice, ""come"
7208,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"along."""
7209,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7210,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Eh?"" cried Sandy, now quite sober and all of a shiver, for a cold"
7211,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"breath seemed to have gone right through him, and he looked behind him"
7212,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"on each side and then in front, but there was nothing visible but the"
7213,A GOBLIN DITTY.,glittering snow--covered graves and tombstones sparkling in the
7214,A GOBLIN DITTY.,brilliant moonlight.
7215,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7216,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Bah!"" cried Sandy, ""I don't believe--"""
7217,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7218,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Yes, you do,"" said the same voice, and again the cold breath seemed to"
7219,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"go through Sandy and amongst his hair, so that it lifted his hat,"
7220,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"already half off, and it fell to the ground."
7221,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7222,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""N-n-no, I don't,"" cried Sandy, trying to start off in a run, but he"
7223,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"stopped short, for just in front of him stood a bright, glittering,"
7224,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"white figure, apparently made of snow, only that it had jolly rosy"
7225,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"cheeks, and a pair of the keenest eyes ever seen."
7226,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7227,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Yes, you do, Sandy Brown,"" said the same voice, ""and so don't"
7228,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"contradict.  Bring him along."""
7229,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7230,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"In a moment, before he could turn himself, there came a rushing sound"
7231,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"like when the wintry breeze plunges into a heap of leaves, and whirls"
7232,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"and rustles them away, when Sandy felt himself turned in a moment as it"
7233,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"were to ice, and then rising higher and higher as he was borne round and"
7234,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"round for some distance; when in the midst of myriads of tiny,"
7235,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"glittering, snow-like figures, he was carried all at once right over the"
7236,A GOBLIN DITTY.,church; while like a beam of light the figures swept on after him as now
7237,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"rising, now falling, then circling, he was at last wafted round and"
7238,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"round the old church, till he was placed upon the tower top, and like a"
7239,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"swarm of bees in summer, the tiny figures came clustering and humming"
7240,A GOBLIN DITTY.,round him till they were all settled.
7241,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7242,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Let me go home, please,"" cried Sandy, as soon as he could speak, but"
7243,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"before the last word was well said, the first figure he had seen clapped"
7244,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"its hand upon his mouth, when the tailor's jaw seemed to freeze stiff,"
7245,A GOBLIN DITTY.,so that he could not move his jaw.
7246,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7247,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""How dare you?"" cried the spirit angrily."
7248,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7249,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Dare I what?""  Sandy said with his eyes."
7250,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7251,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Profane good words,"" cried the spirit, in answer.  ""How dare you talk"
7252,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"about home, when you have murdered it, and cast the guardian spirit out?"
7253,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Freeze him.  But there, stop a bit."""
7254,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7255,A GOBLIN DITTY.,Hundreds of the little fellows round had been about to make a dash at
7256,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"Sandy, but they fell back once more, and the tailor sat immoveable."
7257,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7258,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""There, look there,"" said the cold voice; ""that's what you have spoilt."""
7259,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"And Sandy began to weep bitterly, so that his tears froze and fell in"
7260,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"little hard pellets of ice on to the snow before him, for he was looking"
7261,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"upon the happy little home he had once had before he took to drinking,"
7262,A GOBLIN DITTY.,and watching in the humble but comfortable spot the busy wife preparing
7263,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"for the next day's Christmas feast, while he, busy and active, was"
7264,A GOBLIN DITTY.,finishing some work to take back.
7265,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7266,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"""Now, look,"" cried the cold voice, and in an instant the scene had"
7267,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"changed from light to darkness, for he could see his own dissipated,"
7268,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"ragged self standing in the open door of his cottage, with the moonlight"
7269,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"casting his shadow across the figure of his wife, lying cold and pale,"
7270,A GOBLIN DITTY.,with her child clasped to her breast.  The black shadow--his shadow--the
7271,A GOBLIN DITTY.,gloomy shade of her life cast upon her; and in speechless agony Sandy
7272,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"tried to shriek, for it seemed that she was dead--that they were dead,"
7273,A GOBLIN DITTY.,frozen in the bitter night while waiting for him.
7274,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7275,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"The poor wretch looked imploringly at the figure before him, but there"
7276,A GOBLIN DITTY.,was only a grim smile upon its countenance as it nodded its head; and
7277,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"then, as if in the midst of a storm of snow flakes, Sandy was borne away"
7278,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"and away, freezing as he went, now higher, now lower; now close up to"
7279,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"some bright window, where he could see merry faces clustering round the"
7280,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"fire; now by the humblest cottage, now by the lordly mansion; but see"
7281,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"what he would, there was still the black shadow of himself cast upon"
7282,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"those two cold figures, and he turned his eyes imploringly from tiny"
7283,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"face to tiny face, till all at once he found that they were sailing once"
7284,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"more round and round, now higher, now lower, till from sailing round the"
7285,A GOBLIN DITTY.,church the tiny spirits began to settle slowly down more and more in the
7286,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"churchyard, till they left Sandy, stiff and cold, lying between two"
7287,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"graves, with the one tall ghostly figure glittering above him."
7288,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7289,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"And now began something more wondrous than ever, for the bright figure"
7290,A GOBLIN DITTY.,glittering in the moonlight began to hover and quiver its long arms and
7291,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"legs above the tailor, and as it shook itself it seemed to fall all away"
7292,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"in innumerable other figures, each one its own counterpart, till there"
7293,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"was nothing left but the face, which stayed staring right in front."
7294,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7295,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"The old clock struck four, when, groaning with pain and trembling with"
7296,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"fear and cold, Sandy Brown slowly raised himself, keeping his eyes fixed"
7297,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"upon a stony-faced cherub powdered with snow, which sat upon a tombstone"
7298,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"in front, and returned the stare with its stony eyes till Sandy slowly"
7299,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"and painfully made his way across the churchyard, leaving his track in"
7300,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"the newly fallen snow; while, after an hour or two's overclouding, the"
7301,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"heavens were once more bright and clear, so that when Sandy stood"
7302,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"shuddering at his own door he feared to raise the latch, for the moon"
7303,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"shone brightly behind him, and he trembled and paused in dread, for he"
7304,A GOBLIN DITTY.,knew where his black shadow would fall.
7305,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7306,A GOBLIN DITTY.,But in an agony of fear he at length slowly and carefully raised the
7307,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"latch, gazed upon his shadow falling across his wife and child, and"
7308,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"then, in the revulsion of feeling to find that they only slept, he"
7309,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"staggered for a moment, and as his frightened wife shrieked, he fell to"
7310,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"the ground, as if stricken by some mighty blow."
7311,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7312,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"But joy don't kill, especially at Christmas-time, and when Mrs Brown"
7313,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"rose rather late that morning, she could not make out why Sandy was gone"
7314,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"out so soon, for his usual custom was to lie half the day in bed after a"
7315,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"drinking bout.  But Sandy had gone to see about the day's dinner, and--"
7316,A GOBLIN DITTY.,
7317,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"But there, Sandy's home a year after showed the effect of his meeting"
7318,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"with the Christmas spirits, for it was well-furnished, and his wife"
7319,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"looked happy, plump, and rosy--another woman, in fact; while as to"
7320,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"people saying that Sandy fell down drunk in the churchyard, and that it"
7321,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"was the little snow storm that he saw, why that's all nonsense; the"
7322,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"story must be true, for a man picked up Sandy's old hat just by the"
7323,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"swing-gate, where it fell off when he felt the spirit's breath.  And as"
7324,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"to there being no spirits out at Christmas-time, why I could name no end"
7325,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"of them, such as love, gratitude, kindness, gentleness, good humour, and"
7326,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"scores more with names, besides all those nameless spirits that cluster"
7327,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"round every good, true, and loving heart at Christmas; ay, and at all"
7328,A GOBLIN DITTY.,times.  While among those who have listened to this story and thought of
7329,A GOBLIN DITTY.,"its moral, surely there is at this moment that most gracious of"
7330,A GOBLIN DITTY.,spirits--Forbearance.

7342,KING BOREAS.,
7343,KING BOREAS.,"O'er the sea, o'er the waves that spring tossing in wrath,"
7344,KING BOREAS.,"To fly after the host in a storm of white froth,"

7367,KING BOREAS.,
7368,KING BOREAS.,"Rejoicing and shrieking anew at each feat,"

7398,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7399,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, no, sir, I can't complain, I've risen well in the force, and I'm"
7400,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"very well satisfied with my position, but then there's a great deal of"
7401,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"responsibility attached to one's office, and, I can assure you, police"
7402,A LADY IN THE CASE.,inspectors have something else to do besides sitting still and growing
7403,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fat.  Many a smart young fellow would rise and get to be sergeant,"
7404,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"inspector, or super in his turn, but for some little failings that creep"
7405,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"out--I have my failings, too, of course, but still somehow I've crept up"
7406,A LADY IN THE CASE.,till here I am on the shady side of fifty and busy as ever.
7407,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7408,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Now you want me to give you an anecdote to put into print, that's what"
7409,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"you want, eh?  Well, of course it was easy enough to tell that, and I"
7410,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"don't mind obliging you, for, as you very reasonably say, truth is"
7411,A LADY IN THE CASE.,stranger than fiction.  But that disposition to tattle or talk about
7412,A LADY IN THE CASE.,their business has been the ruin of more than one promising young
7413,A LADY IN THE CASE.,officer.  Now just think for a moment and suppose us to be always ready
7414,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"to talk of the cases we had in hand, where should we be?  Marked men"
7415,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"would slip us, planned jobs would be stopped, and many a gaol bird,"
7416,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"whose tail we want to salt, would be off and escape.  Ah, thirty years"
7417,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"in the force have shown me some strange sights, and laid bare some"
7418,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"curious tricks, all planned for the purpose of getting hold of"
7419,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"somebody's money.  I've seen and had to do with robbery, and murder, and"
7420,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"garrotting, and burking, and suicide, and swindling, and embezzlement,"
7421,A LADY IN THE CASE.,and every kind of felony or larceny you can find a name for.
7422,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7423,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"You know, our part is decidedly, I think, more lively than the city, for"
7424,A LADY IN THE CASE.,with the exception of a good bold robbery now and then at a bank or big
7425,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"gentleman's, there's seldom anything much there, while in our part we're"
7426,A LADY IN THE CASE.,always busy.  For somehow or another there's always so many really
7427,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"clever rascals laying their heads together and making schemes, and then"
7428,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"you have something new coming out all at once, like a clap of thunder"
7429,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"over the town, and people are very much disgusted because the police"
7430,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"have not bad more foresight, when all the while it's like a game of"
7431,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"chess, and though we who play with the white pieces can to a certain"
7432,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"extent see through the manoeuvres of black, yet we cannot see through"
7433,A LADY IN THE CASE.,everything as a matter of course.
7434,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7435,A LADY IN THE CASE.,Now I'm going to tell you of a little affair that happened one
7436,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Christmas-night about twenty years ago, when I was only number so and"
7437,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"so.  It was a bright, clear, frosty night; no moon, but plenty of snow"
7438,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"had fallen, quite late in the evening, so that the streets were"
7439,A LADY IN THE CASE.,regularly muffled; and in spite of feeling a bit ill-tempered at having
7440,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"to be on duty while other people were enjoying themselves, I could not"
7441,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"help thinking of what a seasonable night it was, and how jovial and"
7442,A LADY IN THE CASE.,pleasant every place seemed to look.  There were the bright lights and
7443,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"glowing fires, shining ruddy and warm through the drawn curtains; music"
7444,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and laughing might be heard every here and there, and more than once I"
7445,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"stopped to hear a sweet voice singing, and felt envious like of the"
7446,A LADY IN THE CASE.,comforts other people enjoyed.  Everywhere there seemed jollity and
7447,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"festivity, but in the midst of my growling I could not help recollecting"
7448,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"that my beat that night was all in the better part, while down in the"
7449,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"slums there was plenty of misery, enough to make even a policeman's"
7450,A LADY IN THE CASE.,heart sore.
7451,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7452,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, I felt better then, and I went on quietly through the deep snow,"
7453,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"now making a little noise where it was a bit trampled, and now stealing"
7454,A LADY IN THE CASE.,along as quietly as could be.  Once I caught myself humming a bit of a
7455,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"song I had just heard some one singing, then I whistled a bit, and still"
7456,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I kept on, buttoned up and gloved, thinking how pleasant it would have"
7457,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"been spending Christmas at some jolly farm-house in the country, far"
7458,A LADY IN THE CASE.,away from the noise and worry of London.
7459,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7460,A LADY IN THE CASE.,All at once I came upon a merry party of some half-dozen ladies and
7461,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"gentlemen, just going in at a large house, when one of the gentlemen"
7462,A LADY IN THE CASE.,stopped and gave me quite a cheerer.
7463,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7464,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""How long are you on for, my man?"" he says."
7465,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7466,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Six o'clock to-morrow morning, sir."""
7467,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7468,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Hum; long hours on a bitter night like this.  Bring a glass, John."""
7469,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7470,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"And then I heard him rattle his keys as he says, ""stop a minute,"" and"
7471,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"directly after he came back into the large, handsome hall with a"
7472,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"decanter in his hand, while just about the same time the servant brought"
7473,A LADY IN THE CASE.,a wine glass on a little silver tray.
7474,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7475,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""There, my man,"" says the jolly-looking old gentleman, filling me up a"
7476,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"glass of wine.  ""You take care of us, so it's only fair that we should"
7477,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"take care of you.  Thank you, my man, I hope I may have good health."
7478,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"There tip it down and have another glass.  That's twenty port, that is,"
7479,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and a couple of glasses of that won't hurt you.  Here, take hold of this"
7480,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"lump of cake."""
7481,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7482,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I didn't know anything then about twenty port, but I thought I should"
7483,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"like twenty glasses of the rich red wine, which trickled down your"
7484,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"throat like molten sunshine, and made you feel as if it was a jolly"
7485,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"thing to be out on a cold Christmas-night; so I drank my second glass,"
7486,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"wishing the pleasant, smiling old chap a merry Christmas, and then next"
7487,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"minute, feeling like a new man, I was slowly tramping down the long"
7488,A LADY IN THE CASE.,street.
7489,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7490,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"As I told you, in places I went along as quiet as a mouse, when I"
7491,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"suppose it was about one o'clock that, in the middle of one street, I"
7492,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"came all at once upon a tall, well-dressed young fellow inside some area"
7493,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"railings, same as you may have seen, sometimes, where, beside the rails,"
7494,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the top of the area is all covered with iron bars, which make it like"
7495,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the top of a cage; while, as a matter of course, you can walk up to the"
7496,A LADY IN THE CASE.,dining-room windows.
7497,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7498,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, that's what this young fellow had done; and, as I went quietly up,"
7499,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"there he was, close up, resting one foot on a ledge of the stucco, while"
7500,A LADY IN THE CASE.,one hand was on the sill of the open parlour window.
7501,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7502,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Hallo!""  I said quietly, for I had taken my gentleman quite by"
7503,A LADY IN THE CASE.,surprise; and I felt very good-tempered and comfortable from the effects
7504,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"of those two glasses of sunshine; so ""Hallo!""  I said, ""what is it?"""
7505,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"knowing all the while that I must have my gentleman, for he was"
7506,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"regularly caged, and looking at me through the bars."
7507,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7508,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Hush!"" he said, not in the least taken aback; ""Hush! hold your tongue:"
7509,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"there's a lady in the case.  Here, catch hold, and be off, there's a"
7510,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"good fellow;"" and then he gave me half-a-crown."
7511,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7512,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Now, seeing that it was light enough for me to make out that he was a"
7513,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"well-dressed, smart-looking young chap, I took the half-crown, and as it"
7514,A LADY IN THE CASE.,didn't seem to be part of my work to interfere with a bit of billing and
7515,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"cooing, I went on, leaving my friend whispering to some one inside."
7516,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7517,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""All right, my fine fellow,"" I said to myself, turning it over in my"
7518,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"mind; ""All right, but I don't mean to be done if there's anything else"
7519,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"on the way.""  So I went slowly on, and turned the corner; and then,"
7520,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"knowing that my steps couldn't be heard, I slipped into a doorway, and"
7521,A LADY IN THE CASE.,made myself as small as I could.
7522,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7523,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, I hadn't been there a minute before I fancied I heard a sound like"
7524,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"somebody sneezing, and trying to smother it down; and then my heart beat"
7525,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"a little heavier, for I knew there was something more than a lady in the"
7526,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"case; while, as I stood squeezed up there, I could make out my friend"
7527,A LADY IN THE CASE.,coming along by the shadow sent forward by the gas-lamp just round the
7528,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"corner.  At last, very slowly he peeped round to look along the street"
7529,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"where I was, but he could make nothing out, for I kept very snug in my"
7530,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"doorway; though, if he had only come down half-a-dozen yards, he must"
7531,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"have seen me, for there was a light burning over the door."
7532,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7533,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"But the very openness of the place concealed me, and I breathed easier"
7534,A LADY IN THE CASE.,again as I made out by the shadow that he was going back.
7535,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7536,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""My turn now,"" I said; and then, going down on hands and knees, I"
7537,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"crawled quietly and quickly over the snow, and had my peep round the"
7538,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"corner after him, when there he was, slipping along as fast as he could"
7539,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"go.  ""Stop a minute, my boy,"" I said, and then I runs as hard as I could"
7540,A LADY IN THE CASE.,down two streets to where I knew I must meet our sergeant and another
7541,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"man; for, you see, we all have our points to cross one another at"
7542,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"certain times of the night, so that one man acts as a check on another;"
7543,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and the sergeant soon knows that, if a man's not at his place, there's"
7544,A LADY IN THE CASE.,either something wrong or the constable's neglecting his duty.
7545,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7546,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Just as I thought, there were the sergeant and the man, and the next"
7547,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"minute we were going over my ground again, so as to pass along the"
7548,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"street and come up to the open window, as I did at first.  They were"
7549,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"close behind me when I reached the street, and down on my knees I went"
7550,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"again, held my hat behind me, crept to the end of the railings, and"
7551,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"peeped like a boy playing ""whoop."""
7552,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7553,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""All right,"" I whispered back to the sergeant, for there was my friend"
7554,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"at the other corner down on his hands and knees peeping round too, and"
7555,A LADY IN THE CASE.,watching for me to come back again.
7556,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7557,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, we sent our man back through the mews behind the houses to try and"
7558,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"catch the watcher, while the sergeant and I crawled very quietly along"
7559,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"close to the railings towards the open-windowed house, and next moment"
7560,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"we were safe in the doorway, when I saw a head pop back from the open"
7561,A LADY IN THE CASE.,window as we came up; and so did the sergeant--by the way he nipped my
7562,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"arm.  But there, we waited quiet and still for our other man to do his"
7563,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"work and take number one, as I'll call the generous half-crown"
7564,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"gentleman, when we meant to take proceedings against the one or two"
7565,A LADY IN THE CASE.,inside.
7566,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7567,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"About five minutes slipped away very slowly when the sergeant whispered,"
7568,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""He's a very long time!""  But the words were hardly out of his mouth"
7569,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"before we heard some one coming down the street as hard as he could run,"
7570,A LADY IN THE CASE.,with another in full chase.  So we let the first come on without our
7571,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"showing ourselves, when, as he came near the open window, he gave a low,"
7572,A LADY IN THE CASE.,peculiar whistle--one which was replied to from inside by a sort of
7573,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"warning chirrup.  But, if meant for a warning, it was of no use, for,"
7574,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"stooping in the shadow of the railings, we darted out just at the right"
7575,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"moment, tripped my amorous friend up; and, though he tried to jump"
7576,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"clear, it was of no use, for down he went, over and over in the snow,"
7577,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"our other man a-top of him, and then we had the ""darbies"" on him in a"
7578,A LADY IN THE CASE.,moment.
7579,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7580,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""I hope we shan't alarm that lady that's in the case,"" I said to my"
7581,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"friend, as we hauled him up into the doorway; and then with another pair"
7582,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"of bracelets we fastened him tight to the scraper, where he was quite"
7583,A LADY IN THE CASE.,safe till we liked to take him off.
7584,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7585,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Hum,"" said the sergeant; then, looking at me and chuckling, as he stood"
7586,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"brushing the snow off the knees of his trousers; ""Hum, that's the cock"
7587,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"bird, Jones, but I'm afraid the hen will prove rather tough."""
7588,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7589,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Yes,"" I says, ""and I'm afraid there'll be one or two awkward chicks as"
7590,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"well."""
7591,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7592,A LADY IN THE CASE.,The next thing the sergeant did was to ring well at the door after
7593,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"sending another man, who now came up, round to the mews at the back to"
7594,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"be on the look-out for escaping in that direction; and then, as he"
7595,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"climbed over the railings to get at the parlour window, we heard a most"
7596,A LADY IN THE CASE.,tremendous screaming.
7597,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7598,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Come now, there is a lady in the case after all,"" said the sergeant;"
7599,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and then, telling our other man to mind the prisoner, he made ready to"
7600,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"get in at the window, where all looked very uncomfortably dark and"
7601,A LADY IN THE CASE.,treacherous.
7602,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7603,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Shall I go first?""  I said, all in a fidget at the same time lest he"
7604,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"should say ""Yes,"" for I don't mind owning that it looked uncommonly like"
7605,A LADY IN THE CASE.,putting one's head in a trap to go in at that window; and I felt a bit
7606,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"nervous, if not frightened."
7607,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7608,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"The next moment I was over the railings too; and, holding my bull's-eye"
7609,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"so as to throw all the light into the room I could, when in went the"
7610,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"sergeant, and directly after, almost before you could say ""Jack"
7611,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Robinson,"" there was a bit of a scuffle and the sound of a heavy blow,"
7612,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and some one went down with a crash; while, as I leaned forward and held"
7613,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"in my light, I just caught a glimpse of some one, and at the same moment"
7614,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"a heavy, numbing blow came down on my hand, and the lanthorn was knocked"
7615,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"out, and fell with a clang under my feet in the area, while the silence"
7616,A LADY IN THE CASE.,which followed showed me plainly enough that it was not the lady in the
7617,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"case who had been knocked down, but the sergeant."
7618,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7619,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Now, my lad,"" I said to the other policeman, as I stood rubbing and"
7620,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"shaking my hand, ""one of us must go in; sergeant's down, safe."""
7621,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7622,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Well,"" he said, ""you've been longest in the force, you'd best go."""
7623,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7624,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Wrong,"" I said; ""you were in before me."""
7625,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7626,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Well, but,"" he said, ""I'm a married man, and you ain't."""
7627,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7628,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Wrong again,"" I said; ""I'm married, and have two little ones."""
7629,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7630,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, perhaps, you'll say it was cowardly not to have dashed in at once"
7631,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"to help the sergeant.  Perhaps it was; but, mind you, all this didn't"
7632,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"take many seconds, as we whispered together; and, besides, I knew well"
7633,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"enough that I should be taken at a disadvantage; for, though I couldn't"
7634,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"see him, I was sure enough that there was a fellow armed with a"
7635,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"life-preserver or a poker just behind the large window-curtain, so I"
7636,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"wanted to plan a bit.  And, mind you, I didn't want to go; but, as my"
7637,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fellow-constable did not seem disposed, and I stood close to the window,"
7638,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"there was nothing for it, but to take off my great coat and jump in.  So"
7639,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I drew out my staff, when my fingers were so numbed that I could hardly"
7640,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"hold it; and then I said to myself, ""Now for it, my boy;"" when, making"
7641,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"plenty of noise, I tried a very stale old trick--one that I didn't for a"
7642,A LADY IN THE CASE.,moment expect would take; and I tell you what I did.  I got my
7643,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fellow-constable's bull's-eye, opened it, and set it on the window-sill,"
7644,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"so that the light was shining into the room, and then in went one leg,"
7645,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"and I made believe to be jumping in with a rush; but, instead of doing"
7646,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"so, I pushed in my hat as far as I could reach on the end of my staff,"
7647,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"when ""bang, crash,"" down came something right on the hat, beating my"
7648,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"staff out of my hand, and making my fingers tingle again, it came so"
7649,A LADY IN THE CASE.,hard.
7650,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7651,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"That was my time, though, and I leaped in so quickly that, before there"
7652,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"was time for another cut, I had tight hold of somebody, and there I was"
7653,A LADY IN THE CASE.,engaged in the fiercest struggle I ever had.  There were the chairs
7654,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"knocking here, there, and everywhere, while I could feel somebody's hot"
7655,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"breath against my neck as, locked together, we swayed backwards and"
7656,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"forwards.  Once I was forced right back upon the dining-room table, but"
7657,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I sprang up again, and the next moment, whoever it was I struggled with"
7658,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"had his head through the glass; while, as to the darkness, it was"
7659,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"something fearful, for the lanthorn was knocked over, and only shone"
7660,A LADY IN THE CASE.,just in one corner by the floor.  Jangle went a piano once as I was
7661,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"forced back on to it, and then the noise grew louder, for I could hear"
7662,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"above the wild beast, worrying noise we made, the people upstairs"
7663,A LADY IN THE CASE.,screaming worse than ever.
7664,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7665,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Well, there must be help come soon,"" I thought, as now down, now up, we"
7666,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"struggled on.  I wanted to shout to my fellow-constable to come in, as"
7667,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"he was not wanted outside, but I suppose he did not like the job of"
7668,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"getting in, for he did not attempt to come, while as to calling him, I"
7669,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"could just as soon have flown, for my adversary seemed quite satisfied"
7670,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"with my company, and held on by my throat so tightly, that I was almost"
7671,A LADY IN THE CASE.,choked.
7672,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7673,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"All at once, for about the sixth time, I tumbled over the sergeant, and"
7674,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"this time down I went undermost, while my head came against one of those"
7675,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"tin-plate warmers, and made the most outrageous noise you ever heard in"
7676,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"your life.  Well, this rather shook the sense out of me, tin being"
7677,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"rather a hard metal to catch your head against--so hard, that it seemed"
7678,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"to me to quite strike fire, and then taking advantage of my being a"
7679,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"little beaten down, this fellow got his hand inside my stock, when what"
7680,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"with the blow and the pressure of his knuckles in my throat, lights"
7681,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"began to dance before my eyes, and I felt about done.  However, it"
7682,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"seemed to me to be now not a struggle for capture or escape, but for"
7683,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"life and death, and in the last despair of the moment, I got hold of the"
7684,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fellow's hand between my teeth, and hung on like a bull terrier."
7685,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7686,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"How long this lasted I can't say; but I remember hearing a crash, and"
7687,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"seeing the flashed light of a bull's-eye, when my lord rolled off me,"
7688,A LADY IN THE CASE.,and then through a sort of mist I could just see the sergeant's face
7689,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"looking all bloody, while directly after the light of the lanthorn was"
7690,A LADY IN THE CASE.,thrown two or three times upon my face.
7691,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7692,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""How are you, my lad?"" said the sergeant."
7693,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7694,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"But I didn't tell him, for the simple reason that I could not just then,"
7695,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"but lay as still as could be, feeling afraid of tumbling, for the room"
7696,A LADY IN THE CASE.,appeared to be spinning round as fast as possible.
7697,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7698,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""How are you, my lad?"" said the sergeant again directly after, but this"
7699,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"time a little way off, and then I heard the ""click, click"" of the"
7700,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"handcuffs, as he made them fast round my dear friend's wrists."
7701,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7702,A LADY IN THE CASE.,But I did not answer then; for though the room had left off spinning so
7703,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"hard, my tongue seemed to have turned sulky, and would not speak, though"
7704,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"it was not my fault a bit.  One feeling, however, did seem to come upon"
7705,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"me now strong, and that was that I should like to have a look at the man"
7706,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"on the floor, though not an inch could I move right or left."
7707,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7708,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Well, seeing that I could not answer, the sergeant called in the outside"
7709,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"man, and then after a look round the room, he went and opened the"
7710,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"dining-room door, and called out:--"
7711,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7712,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Come down, and bring a light.  We are the police."""
7713,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7714,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"But before he had well said the words, there came a bang like thunder,"
7715,A LADY IN THE CASE.,and I could hear shot go rattling down the passage.
7716,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7717,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Here, I say! confound you; what are you doing?"" shouted the sergeant."
7718,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Don't you hear?  We're the police.""  When, bad as I was, I could not"
7719,A LADY IN THE CASE.,help laughing to see the way our poor sergeant jumped.  Though certainly
7720,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"it was enough to make him, you'll say."
7721,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7722,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"After a few minutes a miserable looking old gentleman, in a dressing"
7723,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"gown, came shivering down with one of those great brass blunderbusses in"
7724,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"one hand, and a candlestick in the other."
7725,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7726,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Keep back,"" the old gentleman cried; ""it's loaded again."""
7727,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7728,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Then the sooner you uncock it the better,"" said our sergeant; ""or else,"
7729,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"perhaps, you'll be making another mistake.  But now, if you'll go with"
7730,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"me, we will just let the other man in,"" and then he went and shut down"
7731,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the window, and drew the curtains across."
7732,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7733,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"But the old gentleman seemed so scared, that he could hardly tell"
7734,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"friends from enemies, and he did not appear to like the idea of the"
7735,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"front door being opened, for nearly all the sense seemed frightened out"
7736,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"of him.  However, he followed the sergeant, and they unlocked the door,"
7737,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"let down the chain, and slipped back the bolts, and then after unlocking"
7738,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the darby, they lugged in my friend who said there was a lady in the"
7739,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"case, brought him into the dining-room, and set him in an easy-chair in"
7740,A LADY IN THE CASE.,the corner.  The sergeant then set light to a pair of candles on the
7741,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"chimney-piece, when I could see all that went on, for I could neither"
7742,A LADY IN THE CASE.,move nor speak yet.
7743,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7744,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Slip round to the station for more help, and the stretcher,"" said the"
7745,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"sergeant; and my fellow-constable went, though the old gentleman didn't"
7746,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"seem to like it, and asked if it was safe to be left with the two"
7747,A LADY IN THE CASE.,burglars.
7748,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7749,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Then the sergeant came and stooped over me again, and asked me how I"
7750,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"was; but all I could do was to look hard in his face, and wink both my"
7751,A LADY IN THE CASE.,eyes.
7752,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7753,A LADY IN THE CASE.,Just then he asked the old gentleman if he had a drop of brandy in the
7754,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"house, when a decanter was brought out, and a glass held to my lips, and"
7755,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"a few drops seemed to revive me so, that I was able to sit up, when the"
7756,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"sergeant and the old gentleman between them got me upon a sofa, where I"
7757,A LADY IN THE CASE.,lay quite still and felt better.
7758,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7759,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Dear me, dear me,"" said the old gentleman: ""I don't like my house being"
7760,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"turned into a hospital."""
7761,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7762,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""P'raps not,"" said the sergeant; ""but if it hadn't been for that poor"
7763,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fellow, you might have looked queer."""
7764,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7765,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Hearing the old fellow grumble seemed to rouse me, and I still went on"
7766,A LADY IN THE CASE.,listening.
7767,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7768,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""It's been a stiff fight, sir,"" said the sergeant; ""and that young"
7769,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fellow--"""
7770,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7771,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""And you, sergeant,"" I said feebly."
7772,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7773,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Oh, come; that's cheering,"" said he with a pleasant look, which went"
7774,A LADY IN THE CASE.,right over his shining face.
7775,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7776,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"You can't tell how pleased I felt to be able to use my tongue once more,"
7777,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"but there was no work in me, and there I lay watching the sergeant give"
7778,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"a look at the two prisoners, and examine the handcuffs to see that all"
7779,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"was right, when all at once the fellow I had such a struggle with,"
7780,A LADY IN THE CASE.,sprang up and fetched the sergeant the most savage of kicks in the
7781,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"knee--one which sent him staggering back--when, in spite of all that has"
7782,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"been said about the police using their staves, I'm sure no one could"
7783,A LADY IN THE CASE.,have blamed that sergeant for bringing his staff down on the fellow's
7784,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"head, and striking him to the ground, where, as he lay, I had a good"
7785,A LADY IN THE CASE.,look at him.
7786,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7787,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"And a nice specimen of humanity he looked--a great six-foot fellow,"
7788,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"strong as a horse, while my impression is that, if the sergeant had not"
7789,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"come so opportunely to my aid, you would not have heard this story.  But"
7790,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the fellow was tolerably knocked about.  Ah! and so was the sergeant,"
7791,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"while, no doubt, I should have been stunned at first if the chap had not"
7792,A LADY IN THE CASE.,been taken in by my shallow trick.
7793,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7794,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"A nice little affair that was, and I saw that I had only just got up in"
7795,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"time, for there were two carpet-bags on the floor crammed full of"
7796,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"plate--silver dishes and tea and coffee pots, while all the small parts"
7797,A LADY IN THE CASE.,were filled out with forks and spoons.
7798,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7799,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"All at once the old gentleman, who had been shivering about as far off"
7800,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"the burglars as he could, seemed to catch sight of my half-crown"
7801,A LADY IN THE CASE.,gentleman's face--a face that he had not appeared so far to be very
7802,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"proud of, for he had kept it hung down over his waistcoat the greater"
7803,A LADY IN THE CASE.,part of the time--when all at once the old gentleman stood still and
7804,A LADY IN THE CASE.,exclaimed:--
7805,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7806,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Why, you scoundrel, it's you, is it?"" and the fellow only shrunk down"
7807,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"more of a heap, while the old gentleman was so enraged, that he made"
7808,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"believe to shoot the rascal with his blunderbuss, when the sergeant made"
7809,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"no more ado, but went and took it away from him."
7810,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7811,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Come, you know,"" said the sergeant; ""I see you won't be happy till"
7812,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"you've done some one a mischief with that pretty little plaything.  Oh,"
7813,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"he was your footman, was he, and you discharged him for drunkenness, did"
7814,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"you, a month ago?  Well, I'm not surprised a bit."""
7815,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7816,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"Just then three of our men came in, and they walked off our two"
7817,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"gaol-birds at once, and then I got hold of the sergeant's arm, and found"
7818,A LADY IN THE CASE.,I could walk.
7819,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7820,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Take a little more brandy,"" said the old gentleman, and he poured out"
7821,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"with a shaking hand about half a wine-glassful, when after I had drunk"
7822,A LADY IN THE CASE.,it he said again:
7823,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7824,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""You're a brave fellow, and there's something to drink my health with."""
7825,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7826,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I thanked him, and then we two walked out together, and stood on the"
7827,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"pavement amongst the snow, listening to the old gentleman and the"
7828,A LADY IN THE CASE.,servants locking and bolting the door after us.
7829,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7830,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Well,"" said the sergeant; ""I think, my lad, we've done our night's"
7831,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"work, and after reporting at the station, we'll go off duty for a day or"
7832,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"two; for my head is in a queer state,"" and then he lifted his hat,"
7833,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"pressed his hand upon it, and looked at the blood-smeared palm under the"
7834,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"lamp.  ""But what did the old fellow give you?"""
7835,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7836,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"I opened my hand and looked, for I had not cared to look before; in"
7837,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"fact, I was so stupid then, and dizzy, that I felt no interest in the"
7838,A LADY IN THE CASE.,money.
7839,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7840,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"""Just what I expected,"" exclaimed the sergeant; ""Sixpence!  Well, some"
7841,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"men have consciences."""
7842,A LADY IN THE CASE.,
7843,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"It was a week before the sergeant was pronounced fit for duty, but it"
7844,A LADY IN THE CASE.,took me a fortnight to get right; while our friends had fourteen years
7845,A LADY IN THE CASE.,each.  I've often thought of the way I spent that Christmas-night--the
7846,A LADY IN THE CASE.,"roughest I ever did pass; but then you see, there was a Lady in the"
7847,A LADY IN THE CASE.,Case.

7853,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.
7854,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7855,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Whether I believe in ghosts, fetches, hobgoblins, table spirits, and the"
7856,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"rest of the lights and shades of the supernatural world, is a question"
7857,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"that we will not stop to discuss, but if these pages should meet the eye"
7858,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"of any person who can introduce me to a haunted house, I shall be his"
7859,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"debtor.  Now, when I say a haunted house, I must place a few"
7860,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"stipulations upon my acceptance of the said house, so I will at once"
7861,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,state what I want.
7862,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7863,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"I want one of those comfortably (old-fashioned) furnished, quaint,"
7864,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"gabled houses, shut up and deserted on account of supernatural tenants"
7865,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"who will not be evicted; a house sacred to dust, spiders, and silence,"
7866,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"where the damp has crept in here, and the mildew there, where dry rot"
7867,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and desolation have fixed their abodes, where the owl hoots and the"
7868,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"chimney swallow builds, undisturbed by the cheering fumes of a fire;"
7869,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,where the once trim garden is weed-grown and wild; pedestals overturned;
7870,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"moss and ivy rampant; fountains choked, and nature having it all her own"
7871,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,way as she has had it for years.  That's the sort of place I want to
7872,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"meet with, one that nobody will take, and when I present myself, the"
7873,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"agent will laugh in his sleeve, and gladly accept me as tenant on lease"
7874,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"for a trivial rent.  Yes, the agent will laugh in his sleeve at my folly"
7875,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"in taking the place on lease, and eagerly getting the document prepared"
7876,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,and signed.
7877,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7878,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,But then about the murder once committed in the far chamber--the
7879,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,noises--the rustling of silk dresses--the groans--the spots on the
7880,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,floor--the steps along the passages--the opening and closing doors--and
7881,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"other horrors that have scared people to death?  Well, by God's help,"
7882,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and the exercise of a little observation, and putting of that and that"
7883,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"together, I fancy I could get over those little troubles in time, for if"
7884,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the released souls of Hades, that once strutted upon this world's stage,"
7885,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,can come back to perform such pitiful duties as to get in table legs and
7886,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"hats, bang doors, rattle chains, and rustle about o' nights, why e'en"
7887,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"let them; and as I before hinted, I'll try and get used to that part of"
7888,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the trouble.  The birds would still be welcome visitants, for I must own"
7889,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"to a weakness for the feathered tribe, while on their part I can easily"
7890,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,conceive that they would be discriminating in their choice of chimneys;
7891,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the mildew and damp must, of course, be ousted, along with the dust and"
7892,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"dry rot, while, as to the spiders and their works, why, much as their"
7893,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"untiring industry and patience must be admired, out they must go too."
7894,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"And after all said and done, I fancy that a spider deserves a little"
7895,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,better treatment at our hands.  As to his character: it is too bad to
7896,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"associate him with so much craft and insidiousness.  Why, what does the"
7897,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,poor thing do but toil hard for its living? and I maintain that friend
7898,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,Arachne is as reputable a member of insect society as the much-vaunted
7899,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,busy bee.
7900,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7901,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Oh!"" some one will say; ""but look at the nasty murdering thing and the"
7902,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"poor flies struggling in its net, while the dear bees live upon nectar"
7903,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and honey!"""
7904,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7905,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,Who killed and murdered most wilfully all those poor unfortunate
7906,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"chuckle-headed drones this summer, eh?"
7907,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7908,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,But to my haunted house once more.  What a crusade against rats and
7909,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,mice--what inspecting of old furniture--and sending this to the
7910,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"lumber-room, and that to be polished and rubbed up--what choosing of"
7911,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"suitable new objects, and fitting up the old-fashioned rooms again,"
7912,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"mingling just enough of the modern to add to the comfort of the old,"
7913,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"without destroying its delicious quaintness.  For I like an old house,"
7914,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"with its crooks and corners, and bo-peep passages, and closets, and"
7915,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"steps, and ins and outs, wainscots, old pictures, and memories of the"
7916,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"past.  Why, no one with a thinking apparatus of his own can be dull in"
7917,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"such a place for calling up the scenes of the past, and trying to trace"
7918,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,the old place's history.
7919,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7920,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Then, again, the garden.  How glorious to leave to nature her beauties,"
7921,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,and only take away the foul and rank; cutting back here and rescuing
7922,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"there, and bringing the neglected place into a charming wilderness--a"
7923,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"place that nature has robbed of its old formal primness, and, setting"
7924,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"art at defiance, made it her own."
7925,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7926,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Yes, if some one will kindly put me in the way of getting such a place"
7927,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"for a residence I shall be his or her debtor, while for recompense, as"
7928,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"soon as ever matters have been a bit seen to, and the place is"
7929,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"habitable, they shall have the honour of first sleeping in the most"
7930,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,haunted room in the house.
7931,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7932,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"This is, I am well aware, a very choice kind of house, but that there"
7933,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"are such places every one is aware, and my story is to be about one of"
7934,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"these old man-forsaken spots, that years ago existed in Hertfordshire."
7935,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"I say years ago existed, for though the house still stands, it is in a"
7936,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"dreadfully modernised form.  Wings were pulled down, wainscotings torn"
7937,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"out, and the place so altered that a tenant was found, and the haunters"
7938,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"so disgusted with their home that the noises ceased, and the old"
7939,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,reputation was forgotten.
7940,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7941,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"I write this story as it was told to me by a friend, in whose word I"
7942,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,have faith sufficient to vouch for the truth of what he heard.
7943,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7944,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"There was an old legend attached to the place, something relating to the"
7945,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"right of possession, and some one coming home to oust the then holder of"
7946,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the estate; then followed midnight murder, the concealment of the deed,"
7947,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and, as 'tis said, the spirits of the murderer and murdered haunted the"
7948,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,scene of the dread deed.
7949,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7950,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Be that as it may, family after family took the house and left in a very"
7951,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"short time.  Strange noises were heard, strange stories got about the"
7952,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,village; servants at first could only be sent from one room to another
7953,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,in twos or threes for mutual protection.  Jane fell down in a fit; Mary
7954,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"was found staring, with her eyes fixed on nothingness, and her mouth"
7955,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"wide open; Betsey was lost, but afterwards found in the best bedroom,"
7956,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"with the whole of her person buried beneath the clothes, when she"
7957,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,struggled and screamed horribly at their being dragged off; cooks Number
7958,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 used to go about after dark with their aprons over"
7959,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"their heads; Mary Hann would not sleep alone; Thomas said nothing, but"
7960,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,took to wearing his hair standing on end like quills upon the fretful
7961,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"etcetera, or better still, in this case, like a hedgehog; and all ended"
7962,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"by giving notice one after the other, so fast, that at last it came to a"
7963,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"fresh servant reaching the village, hearing the character of the house,"
7964,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and then going back without even testing the place, for, like a"
7965,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"snowball, the horrors said to abound, increased at a fearful ratio when"
7966,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,slipping glibly off Rumour's many tongues.  At last the house stood
7967,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,empty year after year.  The agent who was empowered to let it did his
7968,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"best.  House-hunters came, looked at it, asked questions, and then,"
7969,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"after a few inquiries, house-hunters went, and the house stood empty,"
7970,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"when, as season after season passed, the forlorn aspect of the place"
7971,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,became worse; the paint peeled off the window frames; the gutters
7972,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,rotted; green mould settled upon the doors; grass grew up between the
7973,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,steps; while the large slab was raised right out of its place by a
7974,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"growth of fungus; idle boys threw stones at the windows, and then ran"
7975,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,for their lives; shutters became loose and flapped about; while neglect
7976,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"and ruin were everywhere, and the house was said to be more haunted than"
7977,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,ever.
7978,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7979,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Fortunately, The Grange was the property of a wealthy man, who did not"
7980,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"feel the loss of the rent, and as time wore on the place was known as"
7981,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""The Harnted House,"" and no attempt was made to let it, so that it"
7982,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,became at last almost untenable.
7983,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7984,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"At length a new agent came to the neighbouring town, and after a few"
7985,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"months' stay his curiosity became aroused, and being a quiet sensible"
7986,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"fellow, he talked to first one acquaintance and then another, heard the"
7987,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"story of the haunted house from different sources, and the upstart was,"
7988,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"that a party of half a dozen, of whom my friend was one, agreed to sit"
7989,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"up with the agent in the ghostly place, and try and investigate the"
7990,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"matter, so as to place the strange rumours in a better light if"
7991,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,possible.
7992,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7993,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"The night fixed upon came, and well provided with creature comforts, the"
7994,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"party adjourned to the Grange; Mr Hemson, the agent, having been in the"
7995,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"afternoon, and seen that a supply of fuel was placed ready, and at the"
7996,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,same time had all he could done towards making what had evidently been a
7997,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,little breakfast-room comfortable.
7998,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
7999,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"On reaching the hall door the snow was falling heavily, while a sad"
8000,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"moaning wind swept round the house, and blew the large flakes in the"
8001,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,unwonted visitors' faces.  Dreary and dismal looked the old Elizabethan
8002,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Grange, and more than one of the venturesome party felt a shiver--"
8003,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,perhaps of cold--pass through him as a large key was thrust into the
8004,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"lock, and with a groan the door turned upon its hinges."
8005,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8006,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Mr Hemson had brought with him a bull's-eye dark lanthorn, and now"
8007,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"turning it on, the party found themselves in a small square hall with a"
8008,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"wide staircase in front, and about three doors on either side.  All"
8009,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"looked gloomy and weird, while a sensation of chill fell upon one and"
8010,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"all as they passed across the earthy-smelling place, followed Mr Hemson"
8011,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"down a few stairs to the right, and then stood in the little"
8012,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"breakfast-room, where a few sparks yet remained of the large fire that"
8013,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,had been lit.
8014,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8015,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,Every man had come loaded and ready for passing a cold winter's night in
8016,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the forsaken house; and soon candles were lit, a large fire was roaring"
8017,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"up the chimney, and a cloth having been spread over an old table, spirit"
8018,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"bottles, glasses, lemons, and sugar, all tended towards making the room"
8019,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"a little more cheering, while, in spite of dust and cobwebs, there was"
8020,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,some very good furniture about the place.
8021,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8022,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Choose wood-seat chairs, gentlemen,"" said Mr Hemson, ""for everything"
8023,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"is terribly damp."""
8024,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8025,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"The advice was followed, after closing the shutters, and bringing down a"
8026,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,cloud of dust in the performance.
8027,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8028,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Glasses round became the order of the night, and whether for the sake of"
8029,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"getting Dutch courage or not, I cannot say, but Hollands gin was a"
8030,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"favoured spirit.  After this refresher, candles were trimmed, the"
8031,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"lanthorn turned on, and beginning with the cellars, a careful"
8032,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"investigation of the place was made, walls were tapped, fastenings"
8033,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"tried, shutters shaken, and all perfectly satisfied that no one but"
8034,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,themselves was in or could gain entrance to the place.  Go where they
8035,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"would, there was the same dull, damp, mephitic odour; dust and cobwebs,"
8036,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,and mildew everywhere.
8037,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8038,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"But for these traces of the lapse of time, the place might have been"
8039,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"left but a few weeks or months.  The rooms were well-furnished, good"
8040,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"carpets were down, the library shelves were full of books, and ornaments"
8041,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,upon the chimney-pieces.  In the drawing-room was an old square
8042,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"pianoforte, while from every wall gloomy and dark faces looked down upon"
8043,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the intruders.  And thus the tour of the house was completed, not a"
8044,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"closet even being left unscanned, while as they left each room the keys"
8045,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"were turned, and at length, joking and laughing, they returned to the"
8046,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"comparatively snug room, and assembled round the fire."
8047,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8048,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Now,"" said my friend, ""presuming that we have come here to listen for"
8049,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the strange sounds that are heard, what course are we to adopt in the"
8050,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"event of anything taking our attention?"""
8051,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8052,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Not much fear,"" laughed one."
8053,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8054,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Then let's have a little smoke and a song,"" said another."
8055,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8056,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""But really,"" said Mr Hemson, ""I think we ought to do something,"
8057,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"gentlemen; for mind you, I for one fully expect that we shall hear some"
8058,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"strange noise, and what I want is for us to find out what it is, and see"
8059,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"if we can't stop it for the future."""
8060,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8061,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Did you bring any holy water, Hemson?"" said one of the party."
8062,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8063,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Come, come, gentlemen,"" said my friend, ""business, business.  Now, I"
8064,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,tell you what: we will all sit here and of course the first man who
8065,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"thinks he hears a sound will advise the others, when we will all go"
8066,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"together and try and find out what it was, but in silence, mind.  No man"
8067,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"is to speak till we get back to this room, when here is paper and you"
8068,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"have, most of you, pencils; let each man write down what impression that"
8069,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"which he has seen and heard made upon him, writing it down in as few"
8070,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"words as possible, and so we can compare impressions, and there will not"
8071,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"be, as is often the case, one person modelling his ideas upon those of"
8072,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"another."""
8073,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8074,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Very good; I second that,"" said Mr Hemson, while, after a few remarks,"
8075,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,first one and then another agreed that the plan would be excellent.
8076,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8077,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Ten--eleven struck by the old church-clock, and the wind roared round"
8078,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the old place, rumbling in the chimney and sending the snow with soft"
8079,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"pats up against the window-panes, so that more than once a member of the"
8080,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"party started and looked round, but the warm glow of the fire, the"
8081,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"social cheer, and perhaps, more than all, the spirits, tended to drive"
8082,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,away any dread that might otherwise have taken possession of those
8083,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"present, and the night wore on."
8084,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8085,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Twelve struck by the old church-clock, and the wind lulled."
8086,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8087,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Now is the witching--what's the rest of it?"" said one of the party."
8088,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8089,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Ah,"" said another, ""now's the ghostly time."""
8090,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8091,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Don't you wish you were at home, Hemson?"" said another."
8092,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8093,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Not I,"" said the agent.  ""I'm perfectly cool, so far."""
8094,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8095,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Well, I'm not,"" said the first speaker, ""for my shins are scorching."""
8096,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8097,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Pass the kettle this way,"" said my friend, ""and--"""
8098,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8099,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Hush!"" exclaimed Mr Hemson, and a dead silence fell upon the group."
8100,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8101,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Well, what is it?"" said my friend, holding his glass to the"
8102,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,kettle-spout.
8103,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8104,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""I fancied I heard a noise,"" said Mr Hemson, while all listened"
8105,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,attentively.
8106,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8107,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Pooh,"" said my friend; ""the wind,"" and he then filled up his glass and"
8108,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"placed it upon the table, but the next moment he started up."
8109,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8110,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Well, what now?"" said Mr Hemson."
8111,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8112,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Didn't you hear that?"" exclaimed my friend."
8113,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8114,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""No, what?"" said Mr Hemson."
8115,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8116,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Why that noise--there!"" he exclaimed, and now every man started to his"
8117,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"feet, having distinctly heard some sounds proceeding from the direction"
8118,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,of the hall.
8119,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8120,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Hush, be quiet,"" whispered Mr Hemson, hastily examining his lanthorn."
8121,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Now then, follow me,"" and all hastily passed up the few steps and stood"
8122,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,in the hall listening to the sound as of some one talking in the room
8123,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,right in front--the dining-room.
8124,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8125,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,The hall was quite dark save where the light from the breakfast-parlour
8126,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"shone out and cast a long streak upon the dining-room door, while there,"
8127,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"each man holding his breath, and armed as they were with stout"
8128,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"walking-sticks, pokers, or whatever came to their reach, the party stood"
8129,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"listening as the loud utterance of some voice reached their ears,"
8130,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"succeeded by various noises, as if there were some occupant of the room."
8131,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8132,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Now then,"" whispered Mr Hemson, ""are you all ready?"""
8133,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8134,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Yes,"" was the whispered response."
8135,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8136,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Mr Hemson turned on his dark lanthorn, almost with one movement turned"
8137,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"key and handle, threw open the door, and as every man rushed in, the"
8138,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"light was flashed all over the room, but no one was visible.  There"
8139,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"stood the old-fashioned dining-room chairs formally against the walls,"
8140,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the pictures looked down grimly, the wine cooler beneath the sideboard"
8141,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"yawned gloomily and black, but nothing more could be seen; not even a"
8142,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"chair was out of place, though every eye was now directed to a large"
8143,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,closet in one corner.
8144,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8145,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Come along, gentlemen,"" said Mr Hemson, and he swung the door of the"
8146,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,empty closet open.
8147,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8148,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""But the table cover,"" whispered my friend, pointing to the large"
8149,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"dust-covered cloth, whose corners touched the floor."
8150,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8151,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,To whisk off the great pall-like cloth from the long dining-table was
8152,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"but the work of an instant, and then the light was flashed beneath the"
8153,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,table; but nothing save a cloud of penetrating dust rewarded the
8154,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"searchers, who then stood, pale and puzzled, looking at one another,"
8155,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"till Mr Hemson proposed an adjournment to the little room, where, after"
8156,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"carefully locking the dining-room door, they retook their places, every"
8157,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,man feeling uncomfortable and put out.
8158,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8159,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,But attention was soon drawn by my friend to the arrangement agreed
8160,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"upon, when pencils were eagerly seized, and for a quarter of an hour not"
8161,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"a word was spoken, when the last man laid down his pencil."
8162,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8163,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Has every man signed his name?"" asked my friend."
8164,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8165,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"This caused another trifling delay, for no man had placed his name at"
8166,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"the bottom of his manuscript; but this being done, the first man's paper"
8167,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"was read over.  It was, of course, very brief, but to the effect that,"
8168,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"while standing in the hall, he had heard the sound as of a man talking"
8169,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"to himself in a wild, agitated manner; that it seemed that a book was"
8170,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"thrown hastily down upon the table by some one, who then hurriedly"
8171,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"pushed his chair back, so that it scraped along the floor, while at the"
8172,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,same time the table gave way and cracked audibly.  Then followed the
8173,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"hurried pacing of some one up and down the room, till the door was"
8174,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,thrown open and all became silent.
8175,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8176,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Precisely what I have stated,"" exclaimed Mr Hemson."
8177,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8178,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"""Mine is almost word for word the same,"" cried my friend; while, with"
8179,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"trifling exceptions, the narratives of the other watchers tallied."
8180,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8181,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Rather pale and uncomfortable, the party now eat talking in whispers,"
8182,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"starting at every loud gust of wind or loud pat of snow upon the window,"
8183,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,while the rattling of casement or door was enough to send a shiver
8184,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,through the stoutest man present.  But as the night wore on and nothing
8185,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"more alarming was heard, first one and then another dropped off to"
8186,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"sleep, though the majority sat watching till the cold grey light of the"
8187,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"winter's morning dawned; and then, after another glance at the"
8188,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"dining-room, now looking more weird than ever as seen by the light"
8189,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"streaming through the round, eye-like holes in the window shutters, the"
8190,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"party gladly left the house, and doubtless made the best of their way to"
8191,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,bed.
8192,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,
8193,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"Now, I make no defence of this story, for I have placed it upon paper in"
8194,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,much the same form that it was told to me.  What the noise was that the
8195,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"convivial watchers heard I cannot say, but though I consider my"
8196,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"informant worthy of credence, and though it was singular that the"
8197,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,"impression made on all was the same, yet I cannot help thinking that the"
8198,THE GHOSTS AT THE GRANGE.,best thing to imbibe while sitting up o' night is tea.

8203,CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.,
8204,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.
8205,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8206,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Fancy being almost born a DD, like unto Mr Dagon Dodd, a gentleman who"
8207,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"resided, when in what he called his prime, at Number Nine, Inkermann"
8208,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Villas, Balaclava-road, Russiaville--who resided there for the simple"
8209,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,reason that he paid his rent and rates with the same punctuality that he
8210,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"did his Income Tax, or it is within the range of probability that Number"
8211,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,Nine would soon have possessed another tenant.
8212,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8213,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Now, although Mr Dagon Dodd had a great right to the letters DD, since"
8214,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,they formed his initials; yet he was in no wise related to a celebrated
8215,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,doctor of the same name.  Mr Dodd was a bachelor--rather a bald
8216,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"bachelor, with a great deal of very smooth white crown, surrounded by a"
8217,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,neat little stubbly fence of very black bristly hair.  You never caught
8218,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr DD with his hair brushed in greasy streaks across his head, for the"
8219,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"simple reason that his was hair that would not brush, nor yet comb; it"
8220,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"grew in a particular way, and stuck to that way most obstinately,"
8221,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"besides which what hair existed was so much like a brush itself, that"
8222,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,when the well-known toilet appendage came into contact with Mr DD's
8223,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"head there was such violent antagonism that electricity was evolved, and"
8224,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,my only wonder is that Mr DD had not brought the powerful current into
8225,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,use in some way.
8226,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8227,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr Dodd was in person slightly stout, slightly asthmatical, and"
8228,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"decidedly short; and though a single person, report said that it was not"
8229,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the fault of the gentleman, for he had once proposed to a lady and been"
8230,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"rejected.  At all events, Mr Dodd was a single gentleman in the popular"
8231,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"acceptation of the term, but decidedly not so in appearance, for in"
8232,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"addition to his person, which might have been called after the contents"
8233,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"of certain brewers' barrels, ""Double Stout,"" he wore double-breasted"
8234,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"coats and waistcoats, double-soled shoes, with large black ferret"
8235,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"strings, tied in bows, even in snowy weather, while his double chin and"
8236,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,double show of importance made the little gentleman do very great credit
8237,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"to Number Nine, Inkermann Villas."
8238,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8239,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But though a bachelor, Mr Dodd was wedded--wedded to science--science"
8240,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"as applied to domestic economy--social science, and he experimentalised"
8241,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"largely, greatly to the disgust of his staff of servants--cook,"
8242,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"housemaid, and buttons,--who stigmatised him as _messy_.  For the fact"
8243,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"is, Mr Dodd delighted in patents, and was in himself a little fortune"
8244,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,to those men who are for ever trying to perfect that steam-engine which
8245,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"shall draw corks.  Though far from sneering at improvements, what a"
8246,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,blessing it would be if some ingenious mortal would invent a patent
8247,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"noiseless dressing-machine--a dressing-machine for babies.  Oh, _bliss_!"
8248,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,bliss!! bliss!!!  However such an invention could not be expected from a
8249,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"single gentleman, who had, though, patent locks on all his doors; a"
8250,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,patent rotary knife-cleaner polished the knives; a patent boot-cleaner
8251,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the boots; a patent roasting-jack nearly drove the cook mad, as it"
8252,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"basted the meat itself, and all the while splashed the clean hearth and"
8253,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"wasted the perquisites.  Then there was a patent potato-peeler, a patent"
8254,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,potato-masher--egg-beater--carpet-sweeper--cinder-sifter--and prize
8255,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,Kitchener.  Patent something with an unpronounceable name covered the
8256,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,hall; patent candles burned in patent lamps; patent enamel saucepans
8257,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,cooked the viands; while Mr Dodd almost fed himself by means of a
8258,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"little chewing thing, which turned with a handle, for teeth and"
8259,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"digestion were failing, and in spite of a patent base artificial teeth"
8260,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,will prove more ornamental than useful.  There was a patent ventilator
8261,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,for regulating the temperature of every room--instruments that were
8262,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"remarkable for their awkward propensities, for, like the greater part of"
8263,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the machinery in Mr Dodd's establishment, these ventilators always made"
8264,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,a point of doing the very opposite to what was required of them.  For
8265,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"instance, they always stuck and remained open in winter, to give"
8266,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,entrance to all the tooth-chattering winds; and as obstinately remained
8267,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"closed when the summer heats prevailed, and a little fresh air would"
8268,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"have been a blessing.  The patent, or rather to be made patent,"
8269,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,coal-scuttle of Mr Dodd's own designing was certainly a noble
8270,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"invention, only that, like Artemus Ward's first novel, it was far from"
8271,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""perfeck,"" for in consequence of working with a crank the article was"
8272,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"cranky, and always put on either too much or too little of the"
8273,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"heat-affording mineral, while it had been known to scatter a knubbly"
8274,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,shower all over the hearthrug.
8275,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8276,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But scarcely anything had taken up more of Mr Dodd's attention, than"
8277,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,the springs which opened and closed his doors.  He very reasonably said
8278,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,that such a trivial matter might easily be worked by machinery
8279,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,sympathising with the approaching feet; but in spite of all his care and
8280,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"trouble, the springs beneath the boards of the floor would not be"
8281,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"regulated to the required strength, they would go either too stiffly or"
8282,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"too easily.  Now this was very often most troublesome, as exemplified"
8283,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"upon one occasion, when Mr Dodd was bowing out a lady visitor, taking"
8284,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,leave with her husband.  The owner of the inventions stood too long upon
8285,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the spring board, and just in the midst of one of his most profound"
8286,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"bows, clap-to came the door, shooting Mr Dodd forward, as if out of a"
8287,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Roman catapult, and making him butt his male friend, ram fashion, right"
8288,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"in the region known to us in school days as ""the wind,"" when the effects"
8289,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"were most disastrous: the gentleman's watch-glass was broken, and the"
8290,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"visitor doubled up in the large umbrella-stand, with his internal"
8291,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"inflatable organs in a state of vacuum, while by the recoil, Mr Dodd"
8292,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"came down in a sitting posture upon the door mat, where he remained"
8293,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"staring at his collapsed friend until he thought better of it, and"
8294,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,helped him to rise.
8295,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8296,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,He was often on the very point of becoming a martyr to science was Mr
8297,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Dodd, and never nearer than upon one dismal, dreary, snowy, scrawmy"
8298,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"morning, one of those cheerful times when people are wont to feel put"
8299,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,out with everything and everybody--a sort of three-cornered time--a
8300,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Boxing-day in fact, when, after a little extra jollity on the previous"
8301,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"night, there was a strong suspicion of headache and disordered liver."
8302,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr Dodd began the day all askew, by getting out of bed the wrong way,"
8303,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,and then felt as if all the skin was off his temper which as naturally
8304,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"became chafed, as that people who have sore places, manage to hit them"
8305,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,in preference to other parts of their body however sound.  Everything
8306,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,went wrong with Mr Dodd upon that morning.  His shaving water was
8307,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"nearly cold, and in spite of the patent guard razor, Mr Dodd cut"
8308,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"himself severely; then there was hard water in place of soft, in the"
8309,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"ewer, and his face was chapped with the previous day's cutting wind; he"
8310,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"felt as if he had taken cold, for the ventilator had not closed when Mr"
8311,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Dodd went to bed, even when he stood upon a chair and hammered it with a"
8312,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"poker; while, worse than all, an irritating cough tickled and tormented"
8313,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"him, tried as it was by the smoke which ascended the staircase and"
8314,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,penetrated his bedroom.
8315,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8316,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Descending at last through the clouds, like an angry Jove, Mr Dodd"
8317,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"encountered Mary, housemaid, with an angry--""Where does all this smoke"
8318,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"come from?"""
8319,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8320,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh, it's all that nasty jester, sir, as won't keep up.  It's only"
8321,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"propped up now by two little deary pieces of firewood, a waiting to be"
8322,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"burnt through and let it down again."""
8323,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8324,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mary's angry master seemed to think the ""nasty jester"" was no joker; but"
8325,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"a little examination soon enabled him to put the register right, and"
8326,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"dispense with the ""two little deary pieces of firewood;"" but directly"
8327,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"after Mr Dodd summoned the maiden to the dining-room, by apparently"
8328,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"trying to play a tune upon some instrument, whose ivory mouthpiece"
8329,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,projected from the wall.
8330,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8331,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""No stove fire alight in the hall this morning, Mary?"" said Mr Dodd, as"
8332,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"his attendant brought, in some very badly made dry toast."
8333,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8334,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Won't burn a bit, sir,"" said Mary.  ""It's wuss than this, and smokes"
8335,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"awful."""
8336,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8337,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Did you turn the little knob by the pipe?"""
8338,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8339,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""No, sir, I didn't, sir."""
8340,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8341,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Tutt--tutt--tutt,"" exclaimed Mr Dodd impatiently, as he went to the"
8342,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"foot of the well staircase, opened the stove damper, and then stooped"
8343,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,down to open the door and see whether a spark yet remained.
8344,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8345,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"It was well for Mr Dodd that he stooped as he did, for with a fearful"
8346,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"crash down came a coal-scuttle from the second floor, striking from side"
8347,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"to side of the well staircase, and bestowing upon the stooping"
8348,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"gentleman's bald head a regular douche of knubbly coals, mingled with"
8349,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"dust, while the copper scuttle itself fell upon the stove, and knocked"
8350,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,off the pineapple knob which formed its apex.
8351,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8352,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Lawk-a-mercy, sir, what a good job as it wasn't the scuttle,"" exclaimed"
8353,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mary, as her master shook himself free from the cheerful coal, and gazed"
8354,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"up at the skylight at the top of the staircase, to see whence came the"
8355,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"fearful shower, but only to find his eyes resting upon the fat, round,"
8356,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"inanimate countenance of the page staring over the bannisters, perfectly"
8357,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,aghast at the mischief.
8358,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8359,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,The explanation Mr Dodd sought was most simple.  Mr Dodd had not yet
8360,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"fitted his house with a hydraulic lift, after the fashion of those used"
8361,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"in our Brobdignagian hotels, but had contented himself with a crane and"
8362,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"winch for drawing up coals and other loads.  This machine, too, was a"
8363,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"failure from the ignorance and apathy of the page, who was a regular"
8364,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"grit in Mr Dodd's cog-wheels, and who this very morning, from some"
8365,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"mismanagement, had nearly offered up his master as a sacrifice upon the"
8366,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,altar of science.
8367,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8368,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,Under these untoward circumstances Mr Dodd went and acted in the most
8369,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"sensible of ways, that is to say, he went and washed himself; but it is"
8370,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,not surprising that he should afterwards feel more gritty than ever when
8371,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"he sat down to partake of his matutinal coffee, made in a patent pot"
8372,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"with an impossible name.  He boiled his eggs, too, himself, by means of"
8373,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"a small tin affair--patent, of course--in which a certain quantity of"
8374,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"spirit of wine was burned, and when extinct the eggs were done."
8375,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8376,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,Mr Dodd finished his breakfast in a very excitable and vicious manner.
8377,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"He felt sore, mentally and bodily sore, for his inventions and patents"
8378,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"were his hobby, and they either would not work right, or people would"
8379,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,not take the trouble to comprehend them.  He suffered terribly; but for
8380,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"all that he persevered, and, being a bachelor, he did as he liked.  And,"
8381,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"being a bachelor, what wonder that he should have a sewing-machine, and"
8382,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,amuse himself with his Wheeler and Lathe in stitching round the
8383,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,half-dozen new table-cloths?  But the sewing-machine was useless for
8384,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"buttons, so Mr Dodd set to, to invent one that should meet that want,"
8385,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,and so be a blessing for every single man.  A week passed--two weeks--
8386,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"three weeks; and then, after no end of brain work and modelling for the"
8387,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"new machine, to be called the patent button-fixer, invented by Mr Dagon"
8388,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Dodd, that gentleman didn't do it, and gave up, if not in despair, at"
8389,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,all events in despair's first cousin.
8390,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8391,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,But Boxing-day seemed to have set in badly; while Mr Dodd felt
8392,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,ill-disposed to suffer the stings and arrows.  According to the old
8393,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"saying, ""it never rains but it pours""--in this case coals--and while the"
8394,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"hero of these troubles was sternly gazing upon his fire, with a foot"
8395,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"planted against each bright cheek of the stove, Mary came to announce"
8396,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the arrival of a tradesman, now in attendance to take certain orders."
8397,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8398,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr Dodd tried to place himself in a less American position, but found"
8399,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"that he was a fixture.  It was a wet, slushy morning, and Mr D had"
8400,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,determined to try the new patent compo-ment-elastical-everlasting-soled
8401,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"boots--a new patent, and one which should have been devoted to the"
8402,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"practice of walking upon ceilings, for they were now tightly fixed to"
8403,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the sides of the fireplace, and Mr Dodd in them, to his unutterable"
8404,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,discomfort and annoyance.  At the first he imagined that it must be
8405,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"owing to the tar he burned upon his fire--a coke fire, whose combustion"
8406,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"was aided by the drips from a small vessel behind the register,"
8407,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,containing tar; but Mr D soon found that the material of his new
8408,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,impervious boot-soles was alone to blame; and consequently while the man
8409,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"waited he unlaced and set himself at liberty, a culmination at which he"
8410,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"did not arrive without slipping off his chair once, and coming into"
8411,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,sharp contact with the fender.
8412,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8413,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr Dodd determined in future to stick to his shoes, for it was evident"
8414,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"that his boots meant to stick to something else, and they did too so"
8415,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"tightly that they had to be flayed off with the carving-knife, and not"
8416,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"easily either, for sometimes the knife became a fixture, and at others"
8417,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the sole became again attached, while the heel was set at liberty, and"
8418,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,_vice versa_.  So Mr Dodd felt ill-tempered.
8419,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8420,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Now, Mr Pouter,"" said Mr Dodd at last to the tradesman, who had been"
8421,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"for some time standing within the door, and smelling very strongly of"
8422,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"glue; ""now, Mr Pouter, I want the door-springs eased a little, and I"
8423,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"want this fixed."""
8424,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8425,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Certainly, sir,"" said Mr Pouter, smiling at the recollection of his"
8426,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"old friends the spring-doors, which had been quite a little fortune to"
8427,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"him, and bade fair to remain so, seeing that they required his"
8428,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,ministering hands about once a week.  _We_ already know how that they
8429,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"would occasionally bang too hard, but they would also bang too softly;"
8430,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"when the application of a hand was necessary to make them close, and"
8431,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,they might just as well have been common doors.  So Mr Pouter smiled.
8432,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8433,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""What are you laughing at, sir?"" exclaimed Mr Dodd, angrily.  ""I tell"
8434,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"you what it is, sir,"" he continued, rubbing his sore head, for he could"
8435,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"not touch his sore temper, ""I'll tell you what it is, if you can--not"
8436,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"attend to my orders without grinning like a gorilla, I'll--I'll--I'll--"
8437,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"employ some one else.  Such impudence!"""
8438,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8439,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"This was an awful threat for Mr Pouter.  It was like saying, ""I'll take"
8440,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"fifty pounds away from you;"" and therefore Mr Pouter, who hated losing"
8441,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"a customer, and was much given to cuddling his jobs--that is to say,"
8442,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,holding one very tightly till another came in--Mr Pouter looked
8443,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"exceedingly dove-like and mild, ceased smiling, and said appealingly--"
8444,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8445,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Plee, sir, I didn't laugh."""
8446,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8447,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Hold your tongue, sir,"" exclaimed Mr Dodd, ""I say you did laugh."""
8448,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8449,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""But plee, sir, I really didn't, sir, and I didn't mean nothin' at all,"
8450,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"sir,"" expostulated Mr Pouter, in a most ill-used tone."
8451,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8452,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""You laughed at me very rudely, sir,"" said Mr Dodd, with dignity, ""and"
8453,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,I now beg that the subject may be dropped.  Have you brought your
8454,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"tools?"""
8455,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8456,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Yes, sir; yes, sir!"" exclaimed Mr Pouter, glad enough to have the"
8457,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"subject changed, and now looking as solemn and stiff in his features as"
8458,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,if his skin were composed of his own shavings.
8459,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8460,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Then turn up that carpet, remove the loose boards, and ease the"
8461,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"door-spring--not too much, mind; but, there, let that girl pass with the"
8462,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"tray."""
8463,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8464,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""That girl"" was Mr Dodd's housemaid, Mary, who gave her head a"
8465,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,dignified toss; but her step was arrested by the sound of a heavy body
8466,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"falling, followed by an exclamation of pain."
8467,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8468,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Dear me, sir--very sorry, sir--wouldn't have had it happen on any"
8469,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"account,"" said Mr Pouter, stooping to pick up the mallet he had dropped"
8470,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,upon Mr Dodd's particular corn.
8471,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8472,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But Mr Dodd did not reply, he only limped about the room with anguish"
8473,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"depicted upon every feature, while Mr Pouter tremblingly went on with"
8474,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,his work.
8475,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8476,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""There!"" exclaimed Mary, upon reaching the kitchen, ""I declare if I'll"
8477,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,stop.  There's nothing but messing going on from morning till night.
8478,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"It's too bad! for there's that Pouter again, chipping and hammering, and"
8479,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"sending the dust a-flying all over the room worse than ever."""
8480,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8481,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""What was all that noise?"" croaked Cook, a very red-faced and red-armed"
8482,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,lady.
8483,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8484,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Carpenter dropped one of his tools on master's toe, and sent him"
8485,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"a-hopping about the room like a singed monkey,"" exclaimed Mary, in a"
8486,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,tone of the deepest disgust.  And it must be said that this was a very
8487,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"disrespectful and doubtful simile, for the odds were strongly against"
8488,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,Mary Housemaid having seen a monkey suffering from the effects of fire.
8489,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8490,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""What's the carpenter a-doing of?"" said Cook, who was busy making paste,"
8491,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"and now paused to have her question answered, and to rub her itching"
8492,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,nose with the rolling-pin.
8493,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8494,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Why,"" exclaimed Cook's mortal enemy, the Buttons, ""master said as old"
8495,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Pouter was to come and fix a jam--something or other."""
8496,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8497,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""There, now, you be off into the hairy and finish them shoes,"" exclaimed"
8498,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mrs Cook, fiercely.  ""Nobody arst your opinion; so come, now, be off!"""
8499,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8500,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Buttons did ""be off,"" for under the circumstances it would have been"
8501,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"rash to have stayed, since Mrs Cook was going at him, rolling-pin in"
8502,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"hand, with the very evident intention of using it in the same way as her"
8503,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,friend Q1866 did his truncheon.  But Buttons was not going to be bundled
8504,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"out of the kitchen that way ""he knowed,"" so he took his revenge by"
8505,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"flattening his nose against the kitchen-window, just where he would be"
8506,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,most in his culinary tyrant's light; and then in pantomimic show he
8507,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"began to deride Mrs Cook's actions, till that lady rushed out at him,"
8508,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"when he retreated to his den beneath the pavement, and went on with his"
8509,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"work for quite five minutes, then, with a shoe covering one hand and a"
8510,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"brush in the other, he made his appearance at the kitchen-door, to"
8511,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,deliver the following mystic announcement:--
8512,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8513,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""It worn't a jam, it were a preserver,"" but he retreated again with"
8514,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,great rapidity to avoid the paste pin launched at his head by the irate
8515,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"cook, but the utensil only struck the closed door, when Master Buttons"
8516,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"again inserted his head to howl out a derisive ""Boo-o-o,"" and then"
8517,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,disappeared till dinner time.
8518,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8519,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But matters progressed so satisfactorily up stairs, that by five o'clock"
8520,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Mr Pouter departed, basket on back, with half a yard of saw sticking"
8521,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"out, to tickle and scratch those whom he met, to whom on the pavement he"
8522,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,was just such an agreeable obstacle to encounter as a British war
8523,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"chariot, with its scythed axletrees, must have been to all concerned."
8524,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But Mr Dodd was placid, the door worked beautifully, and he determined"
8525,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,to have every other door in the house seen to and re-adjusted.  So Mr
8526,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Dodd dined, and at last retired to bed, serene and happy in his"
8527,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,expression.
8528,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8529,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,That very night something happened.
8530,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8531,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"It was midnight, and, save when the noise of some cab, conveying the"
8532,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Christmas folk home, could be heard, all was still.  But there were"
8533,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,voices to be heard in the attic of Number Nine.  There was a candle on a
8534,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"chair beside the bed, and Cook and Mary were sitting up, the one"
8535,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"listening, while the other slowly waded through the thrilling plot of"
8536,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the ""to be continued"" tale in the Penny Mystifier."
8537,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8538,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"The night was cold, and shawls thrown over shoulders was the mode, while"
8539,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"slowly see-sawing her body backwards and forwards in bed, Mary, after"
8540,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"once reading, went back and epitomised the tale for Cook's benefit, that"
8541,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,lady not having been very clear upon two or three points.
8542,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8543,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Then,"" said Mary, ""when she finds as her par won't let her marry De"
8544,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Belleville, she sits by the open winder, with the snow rivalling her"
8545,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"arm's whiteness, and a lamenting of her hard fate, and it's quite dark,"
8546,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"and her lover comes and begs of her to fly with him."""
8547,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8548,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Go in a fly,"" said Cook, approvingly."
8549,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8550,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""No! no! go off with him,"" said Mary."
8551,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8552,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Ah!  I see,"" said Cook, ""go on."""
8553,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8554,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""And, after being begged and prayed a deal, she says as she will, and he"
8555,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"fetches the ladder; and, just as she's done falling on his neck and"
8556,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"weeping, a mysterious voice says--"""
8557,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8558,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh!"" cried the domestics in horrified tones as they clung together, for"
8559,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"in the stillness of the night there was a fearful cry from below stairs,"
8560,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,followed by the noise of something heavy falling.
8561,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8562,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""It's the biler busted, Mary!"" shivered and sobbed the cook."
8563,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8564,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh no, it's master being murdered,"" gasped Mary; ""I know it is."
8565,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Ennery!  Ennery!  Ennery!"" she cried, banging at the frail partition"
8566,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"wall to arouse Buttons, who at last condescended to wake up and knock in"
8567,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,answer.
8568,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8569,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh! do get up and go down; there's something the matter!"" cried Mary"
8570,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,and Cook together.
8571,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8572,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh, ah! you go,"" came back in muffled tones from the sweet youth."
8573,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8574,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh, do go, there's a good boy!"" said Cook sweetly; ""do go down and"
8575,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"see."""
8576,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8577,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Ah!  I dessay,"" said Buttons, recalling the morning's treatment."
8578,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8579,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"A compromise was at length effected, and the three domestics stood upon"
8580,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"the top of the staircase gazing down, while the moon looked sideways at"
8581,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,them through the skylight.
8582,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8583,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Ah!  I see you!"" cried Cook to an imaginary burglar.  ""You'd better go:"
8584,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"here's the perlice a-coming,"" which was a great fib of Mrs Cook's, for"
8585,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"there was not a policeman near; though, from the lady's tones and"
8586,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"confident way of speaking, it might have been imagined that there was a"
8587,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"police barracks on the roof, just within call."
8588,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8589,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Cook!"" cried a faint voice."
8590,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8591,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""There.  I know'd it was!"" cried Mary.  ""It's master, half killed."""
8592,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8593,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Here, help! come down!"" came up again faintly."
8594,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8595,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""Oh! we dussen't, sir!"" chorused Mr Dodd's servants."
8596,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8597,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"But at length Buttons was pushed forward, and, a landing at a time, the"
8598,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"timid trio slowly descended to the assistance of poor Mr Dodd, whom"
8599,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,they found half-stunned and bleeding upon the dining-room door mat; but
8600,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"warm water, diachylon, and half a glass of brandy revived Mr Dodd so"
8601,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"that he was able to re-send his servants to bed, and then retire"
8602,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"himself, and ponder upon the advisability of having mechanical"
8603,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"life-preservers attached to the lower room doors, since the experimental"
8604,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"affair fixed that day by Mr Pouter had proved so awkward, when its"
8605,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,owner had hurriedly gone down to fetch the letters left upon the
8606,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"dining-room chimney-piece; though if Mr Dodd had been a burglar, the"
8607,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,effect would have been most effectual as well as striking.
8608,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8609,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"""No,"" said Mr Dodd, as he turned his aching head to find an easier spot"
8610,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"upon the pillow.  ""No, I think bells are the best after all."""
8611,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,
8612,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Next morning Mr Dodd was too ill to rise, and many of his"
8613,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"Christmas-boxing friends who had omitted to call the previous day, went"
8614,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"away empty.  Mr Pouter's bill has decreased yearly, for Mr Dodd's"
8615,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"faith has been shaken in patents; while as to spring-guns in grounds,"
8616,CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.,"and preservers set with springs on doors, surely it is better to suffer"
