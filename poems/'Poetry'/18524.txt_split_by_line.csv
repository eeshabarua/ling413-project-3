91,A DARK MONTH,"""La maison sans enfants!""--VICTOR HUGO."
92,A DARK MONTH,
93,A DARK MONTH,
94,I,I
95,I,
96,I,A month without sight of the sun
97,I,Rising or reigning or setting
98,I,"Through days without use of the day,"
99,I,Who calls it the month of May?
100,I,The sense of the name is undone
101,I,And the sound of it fit for forgetting.
102,I,
103,I,"We shall not feel if the sun rise,"
104,I,We shall not care when it sets:
105,I,If a nightingale make night's air
106,I,"As noontide, why should we care?"
107,I,"Till a light of delight that is done rise,"
108,I,Extinguishing grey regrets;
109,I,
110,I,Till a child's face lighten again
111,I,On the twilight of older faces;
112,I,Till a child's voice fall as the dew
113,I,On furrows with heat parched through
114,I,"And all but hopeless of grain,"
115,I,Refreshing the desolate places--
116,I,
117,I,Fall clear on the ears of us hearkening
118,I,And hungering for food of the sound
119,I,And thirsting for joy of his voice:
120,I,"Till the hearts in us hear and rejoice,"
121,I,And the thoughts of them doubting and darkening
122,I,Rejoice with a glad thing found.
123,I,
124,I,"When the heart of our gladness is gone,"
125,I,What comfort is left with us after?
126,I,"When the light of our eyes is away,"
127,I,"What glory remains upon May,"
128,I,What blessing of song is thereon
129,I,If we drink not the light of his laughter?
130,I,
131,I,No small sweet face with the daytime
132,I,"To welcome, warmer than noon!"
133,I,No sweet small voice as a bird's
134,I,To bring us the day's first words!
135,I,Mid May for us here is not Maytime:
136,I,No summer begins with June.
137,I,
138,I,"A whole dead month in the dark,"
139,I,A dawn in the mists that o'ercome her
140,I,Stifled and smothered and sad--
141,I,"Swift speed to it, barren and bad!"
142,I,"And return to us, voice of the lark,"
143,I,"And remain with us, sunlight of summer."
144,I,
145,I,
146,II,II
147,II,
148,II,"Alas, what right has the dawn to glimmer,"
149,II,What right has the wind to do aught but moan?
150,II,All the day should be dimmer
151,II,Because we are left alone.
152,II,
153,II,Yestermorn like a sunbeam present
154,II,"Hither and thither a light step smiled,"
155,II,And made each place for us pleasant
156,II,With the sense or the sight of a child.
157,II,
158,II,"But the leaves persist as before, and after"
159,II,Our parting the dull day still bears flowers;
160,II,And songs less bright than his laughter
161,II,Deride us from birds in the bowers.
162,II,
163,II,"Birds, and blossoms, and sunlight only,"
164,II,As though such folly sufficed for spring!
165,II,As though the house were not lonely
166,II,For want of the child its king!
167,II,
168,II,
169,III,III
170,III,
171,III,Asleep and afar to-night my darling
172,III,"Lies, and heeds not the night,"
173,III,If winds be stirring or storms be snarling;
174,III,For his sleep is its own sweet light.
175,III,
176,III,I sit where he sat beside me quaffing
177,III,The wine of story and song
178,III,"Poured forth of immortal cups, and laughing"
179,III,When mirth in the draught grew strong.
180,III,
181,III,"I broke the gold of the words, to melt it"
182,III,"For hands but seven years old,"
183,III,"And they caught the tale as a bird, and felt it"
184,III,More bright than visible gold.
185,III,
186,III,"And he drank down deep, with his eyes broad beaming,"
187,III,"Here in this room where I am,"
188,III,"The golden vintage of Shakespeare, gleaming"
189,III,In the silver vessels of Lamb.
190,III,
191,III,Here by my hearth where he was I listen
192,III,"For the shade of the sound of a word,"
193,III,"Athirst for the birdlike eyes to glisten,"
194,III,For the tongue to chirp like a bird.
195,III,
196,III,"At the blast of battle, how broad they brightened,"
197,III,"Like fire in the spheres of stars,"
198,III,"And clung to the pictured page, and lightened"
199,III,As keen as the heart of Mars!
200,III,
201,III,"At the touch of laughter, how swift it twittered"
202,III,The shrillest music on earth;
203,III,How the lithe limbs laughed and the whole child glittered
204,III,With radiant riot of mirth!
205,III,
206,III,"Our Shakespeare now, as a man dumb-stricken,"
207,III,Stands silent there on the shelf:
208,III,"And my thoughts, that had song in the heart of them, sicken,"
209,III,And relish not Shakespeare's self.
210,III,
211,III,"And my mood grows moodier than Hamlet's even,"
212,III,"And man delights not me,"
213,III,But only the face that morn and even
214,III,My heart leapt only to see.
215,III,
216,III,"That my heart made merry within me seeing,"
217,III,And sang as his laugh kept time:
218,III,"But song finds now no pleasure in being,"
219,III,And love no reason in rhyme.
220,III,
221,III,
222,IV,IV
223,IV,
224,IV,"Mild May-blossom and proud sweet bay-flower,"
225,IV,"What, for shame, would you have with us here?"
226,IV,It is not the month of the May-flower
227,IV,"This, but the fall of the year."
228,IV,
229,IV,"Flowers open only their lips in derision,"
230,IV,Leaves are as fingers that point in scorn
231,IV,The shows we see are a vision;
232,IV,Spring is not verily born.
233,IV,
234,IV,"Yet boughs turn supple and buds grow sappy,"
235,IV,As though the sun were indeed the sun:
236,IV,And all our woods are happy
237,IV,With all their birds save one.
238,IV,
239,IV,"But spring is over, but summer is over,"
240,IV,"But autumn is over, and winter stands"
241,IV,With his feet sunk deep in the clover
242,IV,And cowslips cold in his hands.
243,IV,
244,IV,"His hoar grim head has a hawthorn bonnet,"
245,IV,His gnarled gaunt hand has a gay green staff
246,IV,With new-blown rose-blossom on it:
247,IV,But his laugh is a dead man's laugh.
248,IV,
249,IV,"The laugh of spring that the heart seeks after,"
250,IV,"The hand that the whole world yearns to kiss,"
251,IV,"It rings not here in his laughter,"
252,IV,The sign of it is not this.
253,IV,
254,IV,There is not strength in it left to splinter
255,IV,"Tall oaks, nor frost in his breath to sting:"
256,IV,"Yet it is but a breath as of winter,"
257,IV,And it is not the hand of spring.
258,IV,
259,IV,
260,V,V
261,V,
262,V,"Thirty-one pale maidens, clad"
263,V,"All in mourning dresses,"
264,V,"Pass, with lips and eyes more sad"
265,V,"That it seems they should be glad,"
266,V,"Heads discrowned of crowns they had,"
267,V,Grey for golden tresses.
268,V,
269,V,"Grey their girdles too for green,"
270,V,And their veils dishevelled:
271,V,"None would say, to see their mien,"
272,V,That the least of these had been
273,V,"Born no baser than a queen,"
274,V,Reared where flower-fays revelled.
275,V,
276,V,"Dreams that strive to seem awake,"
277,V,"Ghosts that walk by daytime,"
278,V,"Weary winds the way they take,"
279,V,"Since, for one child's absent sake,"
280,V,"May knows well, whate'er things make"
281,V,"Sport, it is not Maytime."
282,V,
283,V,
284,VI,VI
285,VI,
286,VI,A hand at the door taps light
287,VI,As the hand of my heart's delight:
288,VI,"It is but a full-grown hand,"
289,VI,Yet the stroke of it seems to start
290,VI,"Hope like a bird in my heart,"
291,VI,Too feeble to soar or to stand.
292,VI,
293,VI,To start light hope from her cover
294,VI,Is to raise but a kite for a plover
295,VI,If her wings be not fledged to soar.
296,VI,"Desire, but in dreams, cannot ope"
297,VI,The door that was shut upon hope
298,VI,When love went out at the door.
299,VI,
300,VI,Well were it if vision could keep
301,VI,The lids of desire as in sleep
302,VI,"Fast locked, and over his eyes"
303,VI,A dream with the dark soft key
304,VI,"In her hand might hover, and be"
305,VI,Their keeper till morning rise;
306,VI,
307,VI,The morning that brings after many
308,VI,Days fled with no light upon any
309,VI,The small face back which is gone;
310,VI,When the loved little hands once more
311,VI,Shall struggle and strain at the door
312,VI,They beat their summons upon.
313,VI,
314,VI,
315,VII,VII
316,VII,
317,VII,"If a soul for but seven days were cast out of heaven and its mirth,"
318,VII,They would seem to her fears like as seventy years upon earth.
319,VII,
320,VII,Even and morrow should seem to her sorrow as long
321,VII,As the passage of numberless ages in slumberless song.
322,VII,
323,VII,"Dawn, roused by the lark, would be surely as dark in her sight"
324,VII,As her measureless measure of shadowless pleasure was bright.
325,VII,
326,VII,"Noon, gilt but with glory of gold, would be hoary and grey"
327,VII,"In her eyes that had gazed on the depths, unamazed with the day."
328,VII,
329,VII,"Night hardly would seem to make darker her dream never done,"
330,VII,When it could but withhold what a man may behold of the sun.
331,VII,
332,VII,"For dreams would perplex, were the days that should vex her but seven,"
333,VII,"The sight of her vision, made dark with division from heaven."
334,VII,
335,VII,"Till the light on my lonely way lighten that only now gleams,"
336,VII,I too am divided from heaven and derided of dreams.
337,VII,
338,VII,
339,VIII,VIII
340,VIII,
341,VIII,A twilight fire-fly may suggest
342,VIII,How flames the fire that feeds the sun:
343,VIII,"""A crooked figure may attest"
344,VIII,"In little space a million."""
345,VIII,
346,VIII,"But this faint-figured verse, that dresses"
347,VIII,"With flowers the bones of one bare month,"
348,VIII,Of all it would say scarce expresses
349,VIII,In crooked ways a millionth.
350,VIII,
351,VIII,A fire-fly tenders to the father
352,VIII,Of fires a tribute something worth:
353,VIII,"My verse, a shard-borne beetle rather,"
354,VIII,Drones over scarce-illumined earth.
355,VIII,
356,VIII,Some inches round me though it brighten
357,VIII,"With light of music-making thought,"
358,VIII,"The dark indeed it may not lighten,"
359,VIII,"The silence moves not, hearing nought."
360,VIII,
361,VIII,"Only my heart is eased with hearing,"
362,VIII,"Only mine eyes are soothed with seeing,"
363,VIII,"A face brought nigh, a footfall nearing,"
364,VIII,Till hopes take form and dreams have being.
365,VIII,
366,VIII,
367,IX,IX
368,IX,
369,IX,As a poor man hungering stands with insatiate eyes and hands
370,IX,Void of bread
371,IX,Right in sight of men that feast while his famine with no least
372,IX,"Crumb is fed,"
373,IX,
374,IX,"Here across the garden-wall can I hear strange children call,"
375,IX,"Watch them play,"
376,IX,"From the windowed seat above, whence the goodlier child I love"
377,IX,Is away.
378,IX,
379,IX,Here the sights we saw together moved his fancy like a feather
380,IX,"To and fro,"
381,IX,"Now to wonder, and thereafter to the sunny storm of laughter"
382,IX,Loud and low--
383,IX,
384,IX,Sights engraven on storied pages where man's tale of seven
385,IX,swift ages
386,IX,All was told--
387,IX,Seen of eyes yet bright from heaven--for the lips that laughed
388,IX,were seven
389,IX,Sweet years old.
390,IX,
391,IX,
392,X,X
393,X,
394,X,Why should May remember
395,X,"March, if March forget"
396,X,The days that began with December
397,X,The nights that a frost could fret?
398,X,
399,X,All their griefs are done with
400,X,Now the bright months bless
401,X,"Fit souls to rejoice in the sun with,"
402,X,Fit heads for the wind's caress;
403,X,
404,X,Souls of children quickening
405,X,"With the whole world's mirth,"
406,X,Heads closelier than field-flowers thickening
407,X,"That crowd and illuminate earth,"
408,X,
409,X,Now that May's call musters
410,X,Files of baby bands
411,X,To marshal in joyfuller clusters
412,X,Than the flowers that encumber their hands.
413,X,
414,X,Yet morose November
415,X,"Found them no less gay,"
416,X,With nought to forget or remember
417,X,Less bright than a branch of may.
418,X,
419,X,All the seasons moving
420,X,Move their minds alike
421,X,"Applauding, acclaiming, approving"
422,X,All hours of the year that strike.
423,X,
424,X,"So my heart may fret not,"
425,X,Wondering if my friend
426,X,Remember me not or forget not
427,X,Or ever the month find end.
428,X,
429,X,Not that love sows lighter
430,X,"Seed in children sown,"
431,X,But that life being lit in them brighter
432,X,Moves fleeter than even our own.
433,X,
434,X,May nor yet September
435,X,"Binds their hearts, that yet"
436,X,"Remember, forget, and remember,"
437,X,"Forget, and recall, and forget."
438,X,
439,X,
440,XI,XI
441,XI,
442,XI,As light on a lake's face moving
443,XI,Between a cloud and a cloud
444,XI,"Till night reclaim it, reproving"
445,XI,"The heart that exults too loud,"
446,XI,
447,XI,The heart that watching rejoices
448,XI,When soft it swims into sight
449,XI,Applauded of all the voices
450,XI,"And stars of the windy night,"
451,XI,
452,XI,"So brief and unsure, but sweeter"
453,XI,"Than ever a moondawn smiled,"
454,XI,"Moves, measured of no tune's metre,"
455,XI,The song in the soul of a child;
456,XI,
457,XI,The song that the sweet soul singing
458,XI,"Half listens, and hardly hears,"
459,XI,Though sweeter than joy-bells ringing
460,XI,And brighter than joy's own tears;
461,XI,
462,XI,The song that remembrance of pleasure
463,XI,"Begins, and forgetfulness ends"
464,XI,With a soft swift change in the measure
465,XI,That rings in remembrance of friends
466,XI,
467,XI,"As the moon on the lake's face flashes,"
468,XI,So haply may gleam at whiles
469,XI,A dream through the dear deep lashes
470,XI,"Whereunder a child's eye smiles,"
471,XI,
472,XI,And the least of us all that love him
473,XI,May take for a moment part
474,XI,"With angels around and above him,"
475,XI,And I find place in his heart.
476,XI,
477,XI,
478,XII,XII
479,XII,
480,XII,"Child, were you kinless and lonely--"
481,XII,"Dear, were you kin to me--"
482,XII,My love were compassionate only
483,XII,Or such as it needs would be.
484,XII,
485,XII,But eyes of father and mother
486,XII,Like sunlight shed on you shine:
487,XII,What need you have heed of another
488,XII,Such new strange love as is mine?
489,XII,
490,XII,It is not meet if unruly
491,XII,Hands take of the children's bread
492,XII,And cast it to dogs; but truly
493,XII,The dogs after all would be fed.
494,XII,
495,XII,On crumbs from the children's table
496,XII,"That crumble, dropped from above,"
497,XII,"My heart feeds, fed with unstable"
498,XII,Loose waifs of a child's light love.
499,XII,
500,XII,Though love in your heart were brittle
501,XII,"As glass that breaks with a touch,"
502,XII,You haply would lend him a little
503,XII,Who surely would give you much.
504,XII,
505,XII,
506,XIII,XIII
507,XIII,
508,XIII,Here is a rough
509,XIII,"Rude sketch of my friend,"
510,XIII,Faint-coloured enough
511,XIII,And unworthily penned.
512,XIII,
513,XIII,Fearlessly fair
514,XIII,"And triumphant he stands,"
515,XIII,And holds unaware
516,XIII,Friends' hearts in his hands;
517,XIII,
518,XIII,Stalwart and straight
519,XIII,As an oak that should bring
520,XIII,Forth gallant and great
521,XIII,Fresh roses in spring.
522,XIII,
523,XIII,On the paths of his pleasure
524,XIII,All graces that wait
525,XIII,What metre shall measure
526,XIII,What rhyme shall relate
527,XIII,
528,XIII,"Each action, each motion,"
529,XIII,"Each feature, each limb,"
530,XIII,Demands a devotion
531,XIII,In honour of him:
532,XIII,
533,XIII,Head that the hand
534,XIII,"Of a god might have blest,"
535,XIII,Laid lustrous and bland
536,XIII,On the curve of its crest:
537,XIII,
538,XIII,"Mouth sweeter than cherries,"
539,XIII,"Keen eyes as of Mars,"
540,XIII,Browner than berries
541,XIII,And brighter than stars.
542,XIII,
543,XIII,Nor colour nor wordy
544,XIII,Weak song can declare
545,XIII,"The stature how sturdy,"
546,XIII,How stalwart his air.
547,XIII,
548,XIII,As a king in his bright
549,XIII,"Presence-chamber may be,"
550,XIII,So seems he in height--
551,XIII,Twice higher than your knee.
552,XIII,
553,XIII,As a warrior sedate
554,XIII,"With reserve of his power,"
555,XIII,So seems he in state--
556,XIII,As tall as a flower:
557,XIII,
558,XIII,As a rose overtowering
559,XIII,The ranks of the rest
560,XIII,"That beneath it lie cowering,"
561,XIII,Less bright than their best.
562,XIII,
563,XIII,And his hands are as sunny
564,XIII,As ruddy ripe corn
565,XIII,Or the browner-hued honey
566,XIII,From heather-bells borne.
567,XIII,
568,XIII,"When summer sits proudest,"
569,XIII,"Fulfilled with its mirth,"
570,XIII,And rapture is loudest
571,XIII,"In air and on earth,"
572,XIII,
573,XIII,The suns of all hours
574,XIII,That have ripened the roots
575,XIII,Bring forth not such flowers
576,XIII,And beget not such fruits.
577,XIII,
578,XIII,"And well though I know it,"
579,XIII,"As fain would I write,"
580,XIII,"Child, never a poet"
581,XIII,Could praise you aright.
582,XIII,
583,XIII,I bless you? the blessing
584,XIII,Were less than a jest
585,XIII,Too poor for expressing;
586,XIII,"I come to be blest,"
587,XIII,
588,XIII,With humble and dutiful
589,XIII,"Heart, from above:"
590,XIII,"Bless me, O my beautiful"
591,XIII,Innocent love!
592,XIII,
593,XIII,This rhyme in your praise
594,XIII,With a smile was begun;
595,XIII,But the goal of his ways
596,XIII,"Is uncovered to none,"
597,XIII,
598,XIII,Nor pervious till after
599,XIII,The limit impend;
600,XIII,It is not in laughter
601,XIII,These rhymes of you end.
602,XIII,
603,XIII,
604,XIV,XIV
605,XIV,
606,XIV,"Spring, and fall, and summer, and winter,"
607,XIV,"Which may Earth love least of them all,"
608,XIV,"Whose arms embrace as their signs imprint her,"
609,XIV,"Summer, or winter, or spring, or fall?"
610,XIV,
611,XIV,"The clear-eyed spring with the wood-birds mating,"
612,XIV,"The rose-red summer with eyes aglow,"
613,XIV,"The yellow fall with serene eyes waiting,"
614,XIV,The wild-eyed winter with hair all snow?
615,XIV,
616,XIV,"Spring's eyes are soft, but if frosts benumb her"
617,XIV,As winter's own will her shrewd breath sting:
618,XIV,"Storms may rend the raiment of summer,"
619,XIV,And fall grow bitter as harsh-lipped spring.
620,XIV,
621,XIV,"One sign for summer and winter guides me,"
622,XIV,"One for spring, and the like for fall:"
623,XIV,"Whichever from sight of my friend divides me,"
624,XIV,That is the worst ill season of all.
625,XIV,
626,XIV,
627,XV,XV
628,XV,
629,XV,Worse than winter is spring
630,XV,If I come not to sight of my king:
631,XV,But then what a spring will it be
632,XV,When my king takes homage of me!
633,XV,
634,XV,I send his grace from afar
635,XV,"Homage, as though to a star;"
636,XV,As a shepherd whose flock takes flight
637,XV,May worship a star by night.
638,XV,
639,XV,As a flock that a wolf is upon
640,XV,My songs take flight and are gone:
641,XV,No heart is in any to sing
642,XV,Aught but the praise of my king.
643,XV,
644,XV,Fain would I once and again
645,XV,Sing deeds and passions of men:
646,XV,But ever a child's head gleams
647,XV,Between my work and my dreams.
648,XV,
649,XV,Between my hand and my eyes
650,XV,"The lines of a small face rise,"
651,XV,And the lines I trace and retrace
652,XV,Are none but those of the face.
653,XV,
654,XV,
655,XVI,XVI
656,XVI,
657,XVI,Till the tale of all this flock of days alike
658,XVI,"All be done,"
659,XVI,Weary days of waiting till the month's hand strike
660,XVI,"Thirty-one,"
661,XVI,"Till the clock's hand of the month break off, and end"
662,XVI,"With the clock,"
663,XVI,Till the last and whitest sheep at last be penned
664,XVI,"Of the flock,"
665,XVI,I their shepherd keep the count of night and day
666,XVI,"With my song,"
667,XVI,"Though my song be, like this month which once was May,"
668,XVI,All too long.
669,XVI,
670,XVI,
671,XVII,XVII
672,XVII,
673,XVII,"The incarnate sun, a tall strong youth,"
674,XVII,On old Greek eyes in sculpture smiled:
675,XVII,But trulier had it given the truth
676,XVII,To shape him like a child.
677,XVII,
678,XVII,No face full-grown of all our dearest
679,XVII,"So lightens all our darkness, none"
680,XVII,Most loved of all our hearts hold nearest
681,XVII,"To far outshines the sun,"
682,XVII,
683,XVII,As when with sly shy smiles that feign
684,XVII,"Doubt if the hour be clear, the time"
685,XVII,Fit to break off my work again
686,XVII,"Or sport of prose or rhyme,"
687,XVII,
688,XVII,My friend peers in on me with merry
689,XVII,"Wise face, and though the sky stay dim"
690,XVII,"The very light of day, the very"
691,XVII,Sun's self comes in with him.
692,XVII,
693,XVII,
694,XVIII,XVIII
695,XVIII,
696,XVIII,"Out of sight,"
697,XVIII,Out of mind!
698,XVIII,Could the light
699,XVIII,Prove unkind?
700,XVIII,
701,XVIII,Can the sun
702,XVIII,Quite forget
703,XVIII,What was done
704,XVIII,Ere he set?
705,XVIII,
706,XVIII,Does the moon
707,XVIII,When she wanes
708,XVIII,Leave no tune
709,XVIII,That remains
710,XVIII,
711,XVIII,In the void
712,XVIII,Shell of night
713,XVIII,Overcloyed
714,XVIII,With her light?
715,XVIII,
716,XVIII,Must the shore
717,XVIII,At low tide
718,XVIII,Feel no more
719,XVIII,"Hope or pride,"
720,XVIII,
721,XVIII,No intense
722,XVIII,"Joy to be,"
723,XVIII,In the sense
724,XVIII,Of the sea--
725,XVIII,
726,XVIII,In the pulses
727,XVIII,Of her shocks
728,XVIII,"It repulses,"
729,XVIII,When its rocks
730,XVIII,
731,XVIII,Thrill and ring
732,XVIII,As with glee?
733,XVIII,Has my king
734,XVIII,"Cast off me,"
735,XVIII,
736,XVIII,Whom no bird
737,XVIII,Flying south
738,XVIII,Brings one word
739,XVIII,From his mouth?
740,XVIII,
741,XVIII,Not the ghost
742,XVIII,Of a word.
743,XVIII,Riding post
744,XVIII,"Have I heard,"
745,XVIII,
746,XVIII,Since the day
747,XVIII,When my king
748,XVIII,Took away
749,XVIII,"With him spring,"
750,XVIII,
751,XVIII,And the cup
752,XVIII,Of each flower
753,XVIII,Shrivelled up
754,XVIII,"That same hour,"
755,XVIII,
756,XVIII,With no light
757,XVIII,Left behind.
758,XVIII,"Out of sight,"
759,XVIII,Out of mind!
760,XVIII,
761,XVIII,
762,XIX,XIX
763,XIX,
764,XIX,Because I adore you
765,XIX,And fall
766,XIX,On the knees of my spirit before you--
767,XIX,"After all,"
768,XIX,
769,XIX,"You need not insult,"
770,XIX,"My king,"
771,XIX,"With neglect, though your spirit exult"
772,XIX,"In the spring,"
773,XIX,
774,XIX,"Even me, though not worth,"
775,XIX,"God knows,"
776,XIX,"One word of you sent me in mirth,"
777,XIX,Or one rose
778,XIX,
779,XIX,Out of all in your garden
780,XIX,That grow
781,XIX,Where the frost and the wind never harden
782,XIX,"Flakes of snow,"
783,XIX,
784,XIX,Nor ever is rain
785,XIX,"At all,"
786,XIX,But the roses rejoice to remain
787,XIX,Fair and tall--
788,XIX,
789,XIX,"The roses of love,"
790,XIX,More sweet
791,XIX,Than blossoms that rain from above
792,XIX,"Round our feet,"
793,XIX,
794,XIX,When under high bowers
795,XIX,"We pass,"
796,XIX,Where the west wind freckles with flowers
797,XIX,All the grass.
798,XIX,
799,XIX,But a child's thoughts bear
800,XIX,More bright
801,XIX,"Sweet visions by day, and more fair"
802,XIX,"Dreams by night,"
803,XIX,
804,XIX,Than summer's whole treasure
805,XIX,Can be:
806,XIX,"What am I that his thought should take pleasure,"
807,XIX,"Then, in me?"
808,XIX,
809,XIX,I am only my love's
810,XIX,"True lover,"
811,XIX,"With a nestful of songs, like doves"
812,XIX,"Under cover,"
813,XIX,
814,XIX,That I bring in my cap
815,XIX,"Fresh caught,"
816,XIX,To be laid on my small king's lap--
817,XIX,Worth just nought.
818,XIX,
819,XIX,Yet it haply may hap
820,XIX,"That he,"
821,XIX,When the mirth in his veins is as sap
822,XIX,"In a tree,"
823,XIX,
824,XIX,Will remember me too
825,XIX,Some day
826,XIX,Ere the transit be thoroughly through
827,XIX,Of this May--
828,XIX,
829,XIX,"Or perchance, if such grace"
830,XIX,"May be,"
831,XIX,Some night when I dream of his face.
832,XIX,Dream of me.
833,XIX,
834,XIX,Or if this be too high
835,XIX,A hope
836,XIX,For me to prefigure in my
837,XIX,"Horoscope,"
838,XIX,
839,XIX,He may dream of the place
840,XIX,Where we
841,XIX,"Basked once in the light of his face,"
842,XIX,Who now see
843,XIX,
844,XIX,"Nought brighter, not one"
845,XIX,"Thing bright,"
846,XIX,"Than the stars and the moon and the sun,"
847,XIX,Day nor night.
848,XIX,
849,XIX,
850,XX,XX
851,XX,
852,XX,"Day by darkling day,"
853,XX,"Overpassing, bears away"
854,XX,Somewhat of the burden of this weary May.
855,XX,
856,XX,"Night by numbered night,"
857,XX,"Waning, brings more near in sight"
858,XX,Hope that grows to vision of my heart's delight.
859,XX,
860,XX,Nearer seems to burn
861,XX,In the dawn's rekindling urn
862,XX,"Flame of fragrant incense, hailing his return."
863,XX,
864,XX,Louder seems each bird
865,XX,In the brightening branches heard
866,XX,Still to speak some ever more delightful word.
867,XX,
868,XX,All the mists that swim
869,XX,Round the dawns that grow less dim
870,XX,Still wax brighter and more bright with hope of him.
871,XX,
872,XX,All the suns that rise
873,XX,Bring that day more near our eyes
874,XX,When the sight of him shall clear our clouded skies.
875,XX,
876,XX,All the winds that roam
877,XX,Fruitful fields or fruitless foam
878,XX,Blow the bright hour near that brings his bright face home.
879,XX,
880,XX,
881,XXI,XXI
882,XXI,
883,XXI,I hear of two far hence
884,XXI,"In a garden met,"
885,XXI,And the fragrance blown from thence
886,XXI,Fades not yet.
887,XXI,
888,XXI,"The one is seven years old,"
889,XXI,And my friend is he:
890,XXI,But the years of the other have told
891,XXI,Eighty-three.
892,XXI,
893,XXI,To hear these twain converse
894,XXI,Or to see them greet
895,XXI,Were sweeter than softest verse
896,XXI,May be sweet.
897,XXI,
898,XXI,The hoar old gardener there
899,XXI,With an eye more mild
900,XXI,Perchance than his mild white hair
901,XXI,Meets the child.
902,XXI,
903,XXI,I had rather hear the words
904,XXI,That the twain exchange
905,XXI,Than the songs of all the birds
906,XXI,"There that range,"
907,XXI,
908,XXI,"Call, chirp, and twitter there"
909,XXI,Through the garden-beds
910,XXI,Where the sun alike sees fair
911,XXI,"Those two heads,"
912,XXI,
913,XXI,And which may holier be
914,XXI,Held in heaven of those
915,XXI,Or more worth heart's thanks to see
916,XXI,No man knows.
917,XXI,
918,XXI,
919,XXII,XXII
920,XXII,
921,XXII,"Of such is the kingdom of heaven,"
922,XXII,No glory that ever was shed
923,XXII,From the crowning star of the seven
924,XXII,"That crown the north world's head,"
925,XXII,
926,XXII,No word that ever was spoken
927,XXII,"Of human or godlike tongue,"
928,XXII,Gave ever such godlike token
929,XXII,Since human harps were strung.
930,XXII,
931,XXII,No sign that ever was given
932,XXII,To faithful or faithless eyes
933,XXII,Showed ever beyond clouds riven
934,XXII,So clear a Paradise.
935,XXII,
936,XXII,Earth's creeds may be seventy times seven
937,XXII,And blood have defiled each creed:
938,XXII,"If of such be the kingdom of heaven,"
939,XXII,It must be heaven indeed.
940,XXII,
941,XXII,
942,XXIII,XXIII
943,XXIII,
944,XXIII,The wind on the downs is bright
945,XXIII,As though from the sea:
946,XXIII,And morning and night
947,XXIII,Take comfort again with me.
948,XXIII,
949,XXIII,"He is nearer to-day,"
950,XXIII,"Each night to each morning saith,"
951,XXIII,Whose return shall revive dead May
952,XXIII,With the balm of his breath.
953,XXIII,
954,XXIII,"The sunset says to the moon,"
955,XXIII,He is nearer to-night
956,XXIII,Whose coming in June
957,XXIII,Is looked for more than the light.
958,XXIII,
959,XXIII,"Bird answers to bird,"
960,XXIII,"Hour passes the sign on to hour,"
961,XXIII,And for joy of the bright news heard
962,XXIII,Flower murmurs to flower.
963,XXIII,
964,XXIII,The ways that were glad of his feet
965,XXIII,In the woods that he knew
966,XXIII,Grow softer to meet
967,XXIII,The sense of his footfall anew.
968,XXIII,
969,XXIII,"He is near now as day,"
970,XXIII,Says hope to the new-born light:
971,XXIII,"He is near now as June is to May,"
972,XXIII,Says love to the night.
973,XXIII,
974,XXIII,
975,XXIV,XXIV
976,XXIV,
977,XXIV,Good things I keep to console me
978,XXIV,"For lack of the best of all,"
979,XXIV,"A child to command and control me,"
980,XXIV,Bid come and remain at his call.
981,XXIV,
982,XXIV,"Sun, wind, and woodland and highland,"
983,XXIV,Give all that ever they gave:
984,XXIV,"But my world is a cultureless island,"
985,XXIV,My spirit a masterless slave.
986,XXIV,
987,XXIV,"And friends are about me, and better"
988,XXIV,At summons of no man stand:
989,XXIV,"But I pine for the touch of a fetter,"
990,XXIV,The curb of a strong king's hand.
991,XXIV,
992,XXIV,Each hour of the day in her season
993,XXIV,Is mine to be served as I will:
994,XXIV,And for no more exquisite reason
995,XXIV,Are all served idly and ill.
996,XXIV,
997,XXIV,"By slavery my sense is corrupted,"
998,XXIV,My soul not fit to be free:
999,XXIV,"I would fain be controlled, interrupted,"
1000,XXIV,Compelled as a thrall may be.
1001,XXIV,
1002,XXIV,For fault of spur and of bridle
1003,XXIV,I tire of my stall to death:
1004,XXIV,My sail flaps joyless and idle
1005,XXIV,For want of a small child's breath.
1006,XXIV,
1007,XXIV,
1008,XXV,XXV
1009,XXV,
1010,XXV,Whiter and whiter
1011,XXV,"The dark lines grow,"
1012,XXV,And broader opens and brighter
1013,XXV,The sense of the text below.
1014,XXV,
1015,XXV,Nightfall and morrow
1016,XXV,Bring nigher the boy
1017,XXV,"Whom wanting we want not sorrow,"
1018,XXV,Whom having we want no joy.
1019,XXV,
1020,XXV,Clearer and clearer
1021,XXV,The sweet sense grows
1022,XXV,"Of the word which hath summer for hearer,"
1023,XXV,The word on the lips of the rose.
1024,XXV,
1025,XXV,Duskily dwindles
1026,XXV,"Each deathlike day,"
1027,XXV,Till June rearising rekindles
1028,XXV,The depth of the darkness of May.
1029,XXV,
1030,XXV,
1031,XXVI,XXVI
1032,XXVI,
1033,XXVI,"""In his bright radiance and collateral light"
1034,XXVI,"Must I be comforted, not in his sphere."""
1035,XXVI,
1036,XXVI,"Stars in heaven are many,"
1037,XXVI,Suns in heaven but one:
1038,XXVI,Nor for man may any
1039,XXVI,Star supplant the sun.
1040,XXVI,
1041,XXVI,Many a child as joyous
1042,XXVI,As our far-off king
1043,XXVI,Meets as though to annoy us
1044,XXVI,In the paths of spring.
1045,XXVI,
1046,XXVI,"Sure as spring gives warning,"
1047,XXVI,All things dance in tune:
1048,XXVI,"Sun on Easter morning,"
1049,XXVI,"Cloud and windy moon,"
1050,XXVI,
1051,XXVI,Stars between the tossing
1052,XXVI,"Boughs of tuneful trees,"
1053,XXVI,Sails of ships recrossing
1054,XXVI,Leagues of dancing seas;
1055,XXVI,
1056,XXVI,"Best, in all this playtime,"
1057,XXVI,"Best of all in tune,"
1058,XXVI,"Girls more glad than Maytime,"
1059,XXVI,Boys more bright than June;
1060,XXVI,
1061,XXVI,"Mixed with all those dances,"
1062,XXVI,Far through field and street
1063,XXVI,"Sing their silent glances,"
1064,XXVI,Ring their radiant feet.
1065,XXVI,
1066,XXVI,Flowers wherewith May crowned us
1067,XXVI,Fall ere June be crowned:
1068,XXVI,Children blossom round us
1069,XXVI,All the whole year round.
1070,XXVI,
1071,XXVI,Is the garland worthless
1072,XXVI,"For one rose the less,"
1073,XXVI,And the feast made mirthless?
1074,XXVI,"Love, at least, says yes."
1075,XXVI,
1076,XXVI,"Strange it were, with many"
1077,XXVI,"Stars enkindling air,"
1078,XXVI,Should but one find any
1079,XXVI,"Welcome: strange it were,"
1080,XXVI,
1081,XXVI,Had one star alone won
1082,XXVI,Praise for light from far:
1083,XXVI,"Nay, love needs his own one"
1084,XXVI,Bright particular star.
1085,XXVI,
1086,XXVI,Hope and recollection
1087,XXVI,Only lead him right
1088,XXVI,In its bright reflection
1089,XXVI,And collateral light.
1090,XXVI,
1091,XXVI,Find as yet we may not
1092,XXVI,Comfort in its sphere:
1093,XXVI,Yet these days will weigh not
1094,XXVI,When it warms us here;
1095,XXVI,
1096,XXVI,"When full-orbed it rises,"
1097,XXVI,Now divined afar:
1098,XXVI,None in all the skies is
1099,XXVI,Half so good a star;
1100,XXVI,
1101,XXVI,None that seers importune
1102,XXVI,Till a sign be won:
1103,XXVI,"Star of our good fortune,"
1104,XXVI,"Rise and reign, our sun!"
1105,XXVI,
1106,XXVI,
1107,XXVII,XXVII
1108,XXVII,
1109,XXVII,I pass by the small room now forlorn
1110,XXVII,Where once each night as I passed I knew
1111,XXVII,A child's bright sleep from even to morn
1112,XXVII,Made sweet the whole night through.
1113,XXVII,
1114,XXVII,"As a soundless shell, as a songless nest,"
1115,XXVII,Seems now the room that was radiant then
1116,XXVII,And fragrant with his happier rest
1117,XXVII,Than that of slumbering men.
1118,XXVII,
1119,XXVII,"The day therein is less than the day,"
1120,XXVII,The night is indeed night now therein:
1121,XXVII,"Heavier the dark seems there to weigh,"
1122,XXVII,And slower the dawns begin.
1123,XXVII,
1124,XXVII,"As a nest fulfilled with birds, as a shell"
1125,XXVII,"Fulfilled with breath of a god's own hymn,"
1126,XXVII,"Again shall be this bare blank cell,"
1127,XXVII,Made sweet again with him.
1128,XXVII,
1129,XXVII,
1130,XXVIII,XXVIII
1131,XXVIII,
1132,XXVIII,"Spring darkens before us,"
1133,XXVIII,"A flame going down,"
1134,XXVIII,With chant from the chorus
1135,XXVIII,Of days without crown--
1136,XXVIII,"Cloud, rain, and sonorous"
1137,XXVIII,Soft wind on the down.
1138,XXVIII,
1139,XXVIII,She is wearier not of us
1140,XXVIII,Than we of the dream
1141,XXVIII,That spring was to love us
1142,XXVIII,And joy was to gleam
1143,XXVIII,Through the shadows above us
1144,XXVIII,That shift as they stream.
1145,XXVIII,
1146,XXVIII,"Half dark and half hoary,"
1147,XXVIII,Float far on the loud
1148,XXVIII,"Mild wind, as a glory"
1149,XXVIII,Half pale and half proud
1150,XXVIII,"From the twilight of story,"
1151,XXVIII,Her tresses of cloud;
1152,XXVIII,
1153,XXVIII,Like phantoms that glimmer
1154,XXVIII,Of glories of old
1155,XXVIII,With ever yet dimmer
1156,XXVIII,Pale circlets of gold
1157,XXVIII,As darkness grows grimmer
1158,XXVIII,And memory more cold.
1159,XXVIII,
1160,XXVIII,Like hope growing clearer
1161,XXVIII,"With wane of the moon,"
1162,XXVIII,Shines toward us the nearer
1163,XXVIII,"Gold frontlet of June,"
1164,XXVIII,And a face with it dearer
1165,XXVIII,Than midsummer noon.
1166,XXVIII,
1167,XXVIII,
1168,XXIX,XXIX
1169,XXIX,
1170,XXIX,"You send me your love in a letter,"
1171,XXIX,I send you my love in a song:
1172,XXIX,"Ah child, your gift is the better,"
1173,XXIX,Mine does you but wrong.
1174,XXIX,
1175,XXIX,"No fame, were the best less brittle,"
1176,XXIX,"No praise, were it wide as earth,"
1177,XXIX,Is worth so much as a little
1178,XXIX,Child's love may be worth.
1179,XXIX,
1180,XXIX,We see the children above us
1181,XXIX,As they might angels above:
1182,XXIX,"Come back to us, child, if you love us,"
1183,XXIX,And bring us your love.
1184,XXIX,
1185,XXIX,
1186,XXX,XXX
1187,XXX,
1188,XXX,No time for books or for letters:
1189,XXX,What time should there be?
1190,XXX,No room for tasks and their fetters:
1191,XXX,Full room to be free.
1192,XXX,
1193,XXX,The wind and the sun and the Maytime
1194,XXX,Had never a guest
1195,XXX,More worthy the most that his playtime
1196,XXX,Could give of its best.
1197,XXX,
1198,XXX,"If rain should come on, peradventure,"
1199,XXX,(But sunshine forbid!)
1200,XXX,Vain hope in us haply might venture
1201,XXX,To dream as it did.
1202,XXX,
1203,XXX,"But never may come, of all comers"
1204,XXX,"Least welcome, the rain,"
1205,XXX,To mix with his servant the summer's
1206,XXX,Rose-garlanded train!
1207,XXX,
1208,XXX,"He would write, but his hours are as busy"
1209,XXX,"As bees in the sun,"
1210,XXX,And the jubilant whirl of their dizzy
1211,XXX,Dance never is done.
1212,XXX,
1213,XXX,"The message is more than a letter,"
1214,XXX,"Let love understand,"
1215,XXX,And the thought of his joys even better
1216,XXX,Than sight of his hand.
1217,XXX,
1218,XXX,
1219,XXXI,XXXI
1220,XXXI,
1221,XXXI,"Wind, high-souled, full-hearted"
1222,XXXI,South-west wind of the spring!
1223,XXXI,"Ere April and earth had parted,"
1224,XXXI,"Skies, bright with thy forward wing,"
1225,XXXI,"Grew dark in an hour with the shadow behind it, that bade not a"
1226,XXXI,bird dare sing.
1227,XXXI,
1228,XXXI,"Wind whose feet are sunny,"
1229,XXXI,"Wind whose wings are cloud,"
1230,XXXI,With lips more sweet than honey
1231,XXXI,"Still, speak they low or loud,"
1232,XXXI,Rejoice now again in the strength of thine heart: let the depth of
1233,XXXI,thy soul wax proud.
1234,XXXI,
1235,XXXI,"We hear thee singing or sighing,"
1236,XXXI,"Just not given to sight,"
1237,XXXI,All but visibly flying
1238,XXXI,"Between the clouds and the light,"
1239,XXXI,"And the light in our hearts is enkindled, the shadow therein of the"
1240,XXXI,clouds put to flight.
1241,XXXI,
1242,XXXI,From the gift of thine hands we gather
1243,XXXI,"The core of the flowers therein,"
1244,XXXI,"Keen glad heart of heather,"
1245,XXXI,"Hot sweet heart of whin,"
1246,XXXI,Twin breaths in thy godlike breath close blended of wild spring's
1247,XXXI,wildest of kin.
1248,XXXI,
1249,XXXI,All but visibly beating
1250,XXXI,We feel thy wings in the far
1251,XXXI,"Clear waste, and the plumes of them fleeting,"
1252,XXXI,"Soft as swan's plumes are,"
1253,XXXI,"And strong as a wild swan's pinions, and swift as the flash of the"
1254,XXXI,flight of a star.
1255,XXXI,
1256,XXXI,As the flight of a planet enkindled
1257,XXXI,Seems thy far soft flight
1258,XXXI,Now May's reign has dwindled
1259,XXXI,And the crescent of June takes light
1260,XXXI,"And the presence of summer is here, and the hope of a welcomer"
1261,XXXI,presence in sight.
1262,XXXI,
1263,XXXI,"Wind, sweet-souled, great-hearted"
1264,XXXI,Southwest wind on the wold!
1265,XXXI,From us is a glory departed
1266,XXXI,"That now shall return as of old,"
1267,XXXI,"Borne back on thy wings as an eagle's expanding, and crowned with"
1268,XXXI,the sundawn's gold.
1269,XXXI,
1270,XXXI,"There is not a flower but rejoices,"
1271,XXXI,There is not a leaf but has heard:
1272,XXXI,"All the fields find voices,"
1273,XXXI,All the woods are stirred:
1274,XXXI,There is not a nest but is brighter because of the coming of one
1275,XXXI,bright bird.
1276,XXXI,
1277,XXXI,"Out of dawn and morning,"
1278,XXXI,"Noon and afternoon,"
1279,XXXI,The sun to the world gives warning
1280,XXXI,Of news that brightens the moon;
1281,XXXI,"And the stars all night exult with us, hearing of joy that shall"
1282,XXXI,come with June.
