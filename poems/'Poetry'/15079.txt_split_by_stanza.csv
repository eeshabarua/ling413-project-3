33,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS 
34,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS,"Ho! green fields and running brooks! Knotted strings and fishing-hooks Of the truant, stealing down Weedy backways of the town. "
35,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS,"Where the sunshine overlooks, By green fields and running brooks, All intruding guests of chance With a golden tolerance, "
36,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS,"Cooing doves, or pensive pair Of picnickers, straying there-- By green fields and running brooks, Sylvan shades and mossy nooks! "
37,GREEN FIELDS AND RUNNING BROOKS,"And--O Dreamer of the Days, Murmurer of roundelays All unsung of words or books, Sing green fields and running brooks! "
38,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A COUNTRY PATHWAY. 
39,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I come upon it suddenly, alone-- A little pathway winding in the weeds That fringe the roadside; and with dreams my own, I wander as it leads. "
40,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Full wistfully along the slender way, Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine, I take the path that leads me as it may-- Its every choice is mine. "
41,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A chipmunk, or a sudden-whirring quail, Is startled by my step as on I fare-- A garter-snake across the dusty trail Glances and--is not there. "
42,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Above the arching jimson-weeds flare twos And twos of sallow-yellow butterflies, Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose When autumn winds arise. "
43,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"The trail dips--dwindles--broadens then, and lifts Itself astride a cross-road dubiously, And, from the fennel marge beyond it, drifts Still onward, beckoning me. "
44,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And though it needs must lure me mile on mile Out of the public highway, still I go, My thoughts, far in advance in Indian-file, Allure me even so. "
45,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Why, I am as a long-lost boy that went At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars, And was not found again, though Heaven lent His mother ail the stars "
46,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,With which to seek him through that awful night. O years of nights as vain!--Stars never rise But well might miss their glitter in the light Of tears in mother-eyes! 
47,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"So--on, with quickened breaths, I follow still-- My _avant-courier_ must be obeyed! Thus am I led, and thus the path, at will, Invites me to invade "
48,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A meadow's precincts, where my daring guide Clambers the steps of an old-fashioned stile, And stumbles down again, the other side, To gambol there awhile "
49,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"In pranks of hide-and-seek, as on ahead I see it running, while the clover-stalks Shake rosy fists at me, as though they said-- ""You dog our country-walks "
50,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And mutilate us with your walking-stick!-- We will not suffer tamely what you do And warn you at your peril,--for we'll sic Our bumble-bees on you!"" "
51,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"But I smile back, in airy nonchalance,-- The more determined on my wayward quest, As some bright memory a moment dawns A morning in my breast-- "
52,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Sending a thrill that hurries me along In faulty similes of childish skips, Enthused with lithe contortions of a song Performing on my lips. "
53,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"In wild meanderings o'er pasture wealth-- Erratic wanderings through dead'ning-lands, Where sly old brambles, plucking me by stealth, Put berries in my hands: "
54,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or, the path climbs a boulder--wades a slough-- Or, rollicking through buttercups and flags, Goes gaily dancing o'er a deep bayou On old tree-trunks and snags: "
55,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or, at the creek, leads o'er a limpid pool Upon a bridge the stream itself has made, With some Spring-freshet for the mighty tool That its foundation laid. "
56,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I pause a moment here to bend and muse, With dreamy eyes, on my reflection, where A boat-backed bug drifts on a helpless cruise, Or wildly oars the air, "
57,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"As, dimly seen, the pirate of the brook-- The pike, whose jaunty hulk denotes his speed-- Swings pivoting about, with wary look Of low and cunning greed. "
58,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Till, filled with other thought, I turn again To where the pathway enters in a realm Of lordly woodland, under sovereign reign Of towering oak and elm. "
59,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A puritanic quiet here reviles The almost whispered warble from the hedge, And takes a locust's rasping voice and files The silence to an edge. "
60,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"In such a solitude my somber way Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom Of his own shadows--till the perfect day Bursts into sudden bloom, "
61,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And crowns a long, declining stretch of space, Where King Corn's armies lie with flags unfurled, And where the valley's dint in Nature's face Dimples a smiling world. "
62,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And lo! through mists that may not be dispelled, I see an old farm homestead, as in dreams, Where, like a gem in costly setting held, The old log cabin gleams. "
63,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,*      *      *      *      * 
64,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"O darling Pathway! lead me bravely on Adown your valley way, and run before Among the roses crowding up the lawn And thronging at the door,-- "
65,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And carry up the echo there that shall Arouse the drowsy dog, that he may bay The household out to greet the prodigal That wanders home to-day. "
66,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK. 
67,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"On the banks o' Deer Crick!  There's the place fer me!-- Worter slidin' past ye jes as clair as it kin be:-- See yer shadder in it, and the shadder o' the sky, And the shadder o' the buzzard as he goes a-lazein' by; Shadder o' the pizen-vines, and shadder o' the trees-- And I purt'-nigh said the shadder o' the sunshine and the breeze! Well--I never seen the ocean ner I never seen the sea: On the banks o' Deer Crick's grand enough fer me! "
68,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"On the banks o' Deer Crick--mild er two from town-- 'Long up where the mill-race comes a-loafin' down,-- Like to git up in there--'mongst the sycamores-- And watch the worter at the dam, a-frothin' as she pours: Crawl out on some old log, with my hook and line, Where the fish is jes so thick you kin see 'em shine As they flicker round yer bait, _coaxin_' you to jerk, Tel yer tired ketchin' of 'em, mighty nigh, as _work_! "
69,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"On the banks o' Deer Crick!--Allus my delight Jes to be around there--take it day er night!-- Watch the snipes and killdees foolin' half the day-- Er these-'ere little worter-bugs skootin' ever'way!-- Snakefeeders glancin' round, er dartin' out o' sight; And dew-fall, and bullfrogs, and lightnin'-bugs at night-- Stars up through the tree-tops--er in the crick below,-- And smell o' mussrat through the dark clean from the old b'y-o! "
70,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Er take a tromp, some Sund'y, say, 'way up to ""Johnson's Hole,"" And find where he's had a fire, and hid his fishin' pole; Have yer ""dog-leg,"" with ye and yer pipe and ""cut-and-dry""-- Pocketful o' corn-bred, and slug er two o' rye,-- Soak yer hide in sunshine and waller in the shade-- Like the Good Book tells us--""where there're none to make afraid!"" Well!--I never seen the ocean ner I never seen the sea-- On the banks o' Deer Crick's grand enough fer me! "
71,A DITTY OF NO TONE.,A DITTY OF NO TONE. 
72,A DITTY OF NO TONE.,_Piped to the Spirit of John Keats._ 
73,I.,I. 
74,I.,"Would that my lips might pour out in thy praise A fitting melody--an air sublime,-- A song sun-washed and draped in dreamy haze-- The floss and velvet of luxurious rhyme: A lay wrought of warm languors, and o'er-brimmed With balminess, and fragrance of wild flowers Such as the droning bee ne'er wearies of-- Such thoughts as might be hymned To thee from this midsummer land of ours Through shower and sunshine blent for very love. "
75,II.,II. 
76,II.,"Deep silences in woody aisles wherethrough Cool paths go loitering, and where the trill Of best-remembered birds hath something new In cadence for the hearing--lingering still Through all the open day that lies beyond; Reaches of pasture-lands, vine-wreathen oaks, Majestic still in pathos of decay,-- The road--the wayside pond Wherein the dragonfly an instant soaks His filmy wing-tips ere he flits away. "
77,III.,III. 
78,III.,"And I would pluck from out the dank, rich mould, Thick-shaded from the sun of noon, the long Lithe stalks of barley, topped with ruddy gold, And braid them in the meshes of my song; And with them I would tangle wheat and rye, And wisps of greenest grass the katydid Ere crept beneath the blades of, sulkily, As harvest-hands went by; And weave of all, as wildest fancy bid, A crown of mingled song and bloom for thee. "
79,A WATER-COLOR.,A WATER-COLOR. 
80,A WATER-COLOR.,"Low hidden in among the forest trees An artist's tilted easel, ankle-deep In tousled ferns and mosses, and in these A fluffy water-spaniel, half asleep Beside a sketch-book and a fallen hat-- A little wicker flask tossed into that. "
81,A WATER-COLOR.,"A sense of utter carelessness and grace Of pure abandon in the slumb'rous scene,-- As if the June, all hoydenish of face, Had romped herself to sleep there on the green, And brink and sagging bridge and sliding stream Were just romantic parcels of her dream. "
82,THE CYCLONE.,THE CYCLONE. 
83,THE CYCLONE.,"So lone I stood, the very trees seemed drawn In conference with themselves.--Intense--intense Seemed everything;--the summer splendor on The sight,--magnificence! "
84,THE CYCLONE.,"A babe's life might not lighter fail and die Than failed the sunlight--Though the hour was noon, The palm of midnight might not lighter lie Upon the brow of June. "
85,THE CYCLONE.,"With eyes upraised, I saw the underwings Of swallows--gone the instant afterward-- While from the elms there came strange twitterings, Stilled scarce ere they were heard. "
86,THE CYCLONE.,"The river seemed to shiver; and, far down Its darkened length, I saw the sycamores Lean inward closer, under the vast frown That weighed above the shores. "
87,THE CYCLONE.,"Then was a roar, born of some awful burst!-- And one lay, shrieking, chattering, in my path-- Flung--he or I--out of some space accurst As of Jehovah's wrath: "
88,THE CYCLONE.,"Nor barely had he wreaked his latest prayer, Ere back the noon flashed o'er the ruin done, And, o'er uprooted forests touseled there, The birds sang in the sun. "
89,WHERE-AWAY.,WHERE-AWAY. 
90,WHERE-AWAY.,"O the Lands of Where-Away! Tell us--tell us--where are they? Through the darkness and the dawn We have journeyed on and on-- From the cradle to the cross-- From possession unto loss,-- Seeking still, from day to day, For the lands of Where-Away. "
91,WHERE-AWAY.,"When our baby-feet were first Planted where the daisies burst, And the greenest grasses grew In the fields we wandered through, On, with childish discontent, Ever on and on we went, Hoping still to pass, some day, O'er the verge of Where-Away. "
92,WHERE-AWAY.,"Roses laid their velvet lips On our own, with fragrant sips; But their kisses held us not, All their sweetness we forgot;-- Though the brambles in our track Plucked at us to hold us back-- ""Just ahead,"" we used to say, ""Lie the Lands of Where-Away."" "
93,WHERE-AWAY.,"Children at the pasture-bars, Through the dusk, like glimmering stars, Waved their hands that we should bide With them over eventide: Down the dark their voices failed Falteringly, as they hailed, And died into yesterday-- Night ahead and--Where-Away? "
94,WHERE-AWAY.,"Twining arms about us thrown-- Warm caresses, all our own, Can but stay us for a spell-- Love hath little new to tell To the soul in need supreme, Aching ever with the dream Of the endless bliss it may Find in Lands of Where-Away! "
95,THE HOME-GOING.,THE HOME-GOING. 
96,THE HOME-GOING.,"We must get home--for we have been away So long it seems forever and a day! And O so very homesick we have grown, The laughter of the world is like a moan In our tired hearing, and its songs as vain,-- We must get home--we must get home again! "
97,THE HOME-GOING.,"We must get home: It hurts so, staying here, Where fond hearts must be wept out tear by tear, And where to wear wet lashes means, at best, When most our lack, the least our hope of rest When most our need of joy, the more our pain-- We must get home--we must get home again! "
98,THE HOME-GOING.,"We must get home: All is so quiet there: The touch of loving hands on brow and hair-- Dim rooms, wherein the sunshine is made mild--- The lost love of the mother and the child Restored in restful lullabies of rain.-- We must get home--we must get home again! "
99,THE HOME-GOING.,"We must get home, where, as we nod and drowse, Time humors us and tiptoes through the house, And loves us best when sleeping baby-wise, With dreams--not tear-drops--brimming our clenched eyes,-- Pure dreams that know nor taint nor earthly stain-- We must get home--we must get home again! "
100,THE HOME-GOING.,"We must get home; and, unremembering there All gain of all ambitions otherwhere, Rest--from the feverish victory, and the crown Of conquest whose waste glory weighs us down.-- Fame's fairest gifts we toss back with disdain-- We must get home--we must get home again! "
101,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM. 
102,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and John, Except, of course, the extry he'p when harvest-time come on-- And then, I want to say to you, we _needed_ he'p about, As you'd admit, ef you'd a-seen the way the crops turned out! "
103,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"A better quarter-section, ner a richer soil warn't found Than this-here old-home place o' ourn fer fifty miles around!-- The house was small--but plenty-big we found it from the day That John--our only livin' son--packed up and went way. "
104,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"You see, we tuck sich pride in John--his mother more 'n me-- That's natchurul; but _both_ of us was proud as proud could be; Fer the boy, from a little chap, was most oncommon bright, And seemed in work as well as play to take the same delight. "
105,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"He allus went a-whistlin' round the place, as glad at heart As robins up at five o'clock to git an airly start; And many a time 'fore daylight Mother's waked me up to say-- ""Jest listen, David!--listen!--Johnny's beat the birds to-day!"" "
106,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"High-sperited from boyhood, with a most inquirin' turn,-- He wanted to learn ever'thing on earth they was to learn: He'd ast more plaguey questions in a mortal-minute here Than his grandpap in Paradise could answer in a year! "
107,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And read! w'y, his own mother learnt him how to read and spell; And ""The Childern of the Abbey""--w'y, he knowed that book as well At fifteen as his parents!--and ""The Pilgrim's Progress,"" too-- Jest knuckled down, the shaver did, and read 'em through and through! "
108,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"At eighteen, Mother 'lowed the boy must have a better chance-- That we ort to educate him, under any circumstance; And John he j'ined his mother, and they ding-donged and kep' on, Tel I sent him off to school in town, half glad that he was gone. "
109,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"But--I missed him--w'y of course I did!--The Fall and Winter through I never built the kitchen-fire, er split a stick in two, Er fed the stock, er butchered, er swung up a gambrel-pin, But what I thought o' John, and wished that he was home agin. "
110,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"He'd come, sometimes--on Sund'ys most--and stay the Sund'y out; And on Thanksgivin'-Day he 'peared to like to be about: But a change was workin' on him--he was stiller than before, And did n't joke, ner laugh, ner sing and whistle any more. "
111,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And his talk was all so proper; and I noticed, with a sigh, He was tryin' to raise side-whiskers, and had on a striped tie, And a standin'-collar, ironed up as stiff and slick as bone; And a breast-pin, and a watch and chain and plug-hat of his own. "
112,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"But when Spring-weather opened out, and John was to come home And he'p me through the season, I was glad to see him come; But my happiness, that evening, with the settin' sun went down, When he bragged of ""a position"" that was offered him in town. "
113,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"""But,"" says I, ""you'll not accept it?""  ""W'y, of course I will,"" says he.-- ""This drudgin' on a farm,"" he says, ""is not the life fer me; I've set my stakes up higher,"" he continued, light and gay, ""And town's the place fer me, and I'm a-goin' right away!"" "
114,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And go he did!--his mother clingin' to him at the gate, A-pleadin' and a-cryin'; but it hadn't any weight. I was tranquiller, and told her 'twarn't no use to worry so, And onclasped her arms from round his neck round mine--and let him go! "
115,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"I felt a little bitter feelin' foolin' round about The aidges of my conscience; but I didn't let it out;-- I simply retch out, trimbly-like, and tuck the boy's hand, And though I did n't say a word, I knowed he'd understand. "
116,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And--well!--sence then the old home here was mighty lonesome, shore! With me a-workin' in the field, and Mother at the door, Her face ferever to'rds the town, and fadin' more and more--- Her only son nine miles away, a-clerkin' in a store! "
117,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"The weeks and months dragged by us; and sometimes the boy would write A letter to his mother, savin' that his work was light, And not to feel oneasy about his health a bit-- Though his business was confinin', he was gittin' used to it. "
118,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And sometimes he would write and ast how _I_ was gittin' on, And ef I had to pay out much fer he'p sence he was gone; And how the hogs was doin', and the balance of the stock, And talk on fer a page er two jest like he used to talk. "
119,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And he wrote, along 'fore harvest, that he guessed he would git home, Fer business would, of course be dull in town.--But _didn't_ come:-- We got a postal later, sayin' when they had no trade They filled the time ""invoicin' goods,"" and that was why he staid. "
120,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And then he quit a-writin' altogether: Not a word-- Exceptin' what the neighbors brung who'd been to town and heard What store John was clerkin' in, and went round to inquire If they could buy their goods there less and sell their produce higher. "
121,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And so the Summer faded out, and Autumn wore away, And a keener Winter never fetched around Thanksgivin'-Day! The night before that day of thanks I'll never quite fergit, The wind a-howlin' round the house--it makes me creepy yit! "
122,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"And there set me and Mother--me a-twistin' at the prongs Of a green scrub-ellum forestick with a vicious pair of tongs, And Mother sayin', ""_David!  David!_"" in a' undertone, As though she thought that I was thinkin' bad-words unbeknown. "
123,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"""I've dressed the turkey, David, fer to-morrow,"" Mother said, A-tryin' to wedge some pleasant subject in my stubborn head,-- ""And the mince-meat I'm a-mixin' is perfection mighty nigh; And the pound-cake is delicious-rich--"" ""Who'll eat 'em?"" I-says-I. "
124,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"""The cramberries is drippin-sweet,"" says Mother, runnin' on, P'tendin' not to hear me;--""and somehow I thought of John All the time they was a-jellin'--fer you know they allus was His favour--he likes 'em so!""  Says I, ""Well, s'pose he does?"" "
125,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"""Oh, nothin' much!"" says Mother, with a quiet sort o' smile-- ""This gentleman behind my cheer may tell you after while!"" And as I turned and looked around, some one riz up and leant And put his arms round Mother's neck, and laughed in low content. "
126,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"""It's _me_,"" he says--""your fool-boy John, come back to shake your hand; Set down with you, and talk with you, and make you understand How dearer yit than all the world is this old home that we Will spend Thanksgivin' in fer life--jest Mother, you and me!"" "
127,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,*      *      *      *      *      * 
128,HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM.,"Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and John, Except of course the extry he'p, when harvest-time comes on; And then, I want to say to you, we _need_ sich he'p about, As you'd admit, ef you could see the way the crops turns out! "
129,NORTH AND SOUTH.,NORTH AND SOUTH. 
130,NORTH AND SOUTH.,"Of the North I wove a dream, All bespangled with the gleam Of the glancing wings of swallows Dipping ripples in a stream, That, like a tide of wine, Wound through lands of shade and shine Where purple grapes hung bursting on the vine. "
131,NORTH AND SOUTH.,"And where orchard-boughs were bent Till their tawny fruitage blent With the golden wake that marked the Way the happy reapers went; Where the dawn died into noon As the May-mists into June, And the dusk fell like a sweet face in a swoon. "
132,NORTH AND SOUTH.,"Of the South I dreamed: And there Came a vision clear and fair As the marvelous enchantments Of the mirage of the air; And I saw the bayou-trees, With their lavish draperies, Hang heavy o'er the moon-washed cypress-knees. "
133,NORTH AND SOUTH.,"Peering from lush fens of rice, I beheld the Negro's eyes, Lit with that old superstition Death itself can not disguise; And I saw the palm tree nod Like an oriental god, And the cotton froth and bubble from the pod, "
134,NORTH AND SOUTH.,"And I dreamed that North and South, With a sigh of dew and drouth, Blew each unto the other The salute of lip and mouth; And I wakened, awed and thrilled-- Every doubting murmur stilled In the silence of the dream I found fulfilled. "
135,THE IRON HORSE.,THE IRON HORSE. 
136,THE IRON HORSE.,"No song is mine of Arab steed-- My courser is of nobler blood, And cleaner limb and fleeter speed, And greater strength and hardihood Than ever cantered wild and free Across the plains of Araby. "
137,THE IRON HORSE.,"Go search the level desert-land From Sana on to Samarcand-- Wherever Persian prince has been Or Dervish, Sheik or Bedouin, And I defy you there to point Me out a steed the half so fine-- From tip of ear to pastern-joint-- As this old iron horse of mine. "
138,THE IRON HORSE.,"You do not know what beauty is-- You do not know what gentleness His answer is to my caress!-- Why, look upon this gait of his,-- A touch upon his iron rein-- He moves with such a stately grace The sunlight on his burnished mane Is barely shaken in its place; And at touch he changes pace, And, gliding backward, stops again. "
139,THE IRON HORSE.,"And talk of mettle--Ah! my friend, Such passion smoulders in his breast That when awakened it will send A thrill of rapture wilder than Ere palpitated heart of man When flaming at its mightiest. And there's a fierceness in his ire-- A maddened majesty that leaps Along his veins in blood of fire, Until the path his vision sweeps Spins out behind him like a thread Unraveled from the reel of time, As, wheeling on his course sublime, The earth revolves beneath his tread. "
140,THE IRON HORSE.,"Then stretch away, my gallant steed! Thy mission is a noble one: You bear the father to the son, And sweet relief to bitter need; You bear the stranger to his friends; You bear the pilgrim to the shrine, And back again the prayer he sends That God will prosper me and mine,-- The star that on thy forehead gleams Has blossomed in our brightest dreams. Then speed thee on thy glorious race! The mother waits thy ringing pace; The father leans an anxious ear The thunder of thy hoofs to hear; The lover listens, far away, To catch thy keen exultant neigh; And, where thy breathings roll and rise, The husband strains his eager eyes, And laugh of wife and baby-glee Ring out to greet and welcome thee. Then stretch away! and when at last The master's hand shall gently check Thy mighty speed, and hold thee fast, The world will pat thee on the neck. "
141,HIS MOTHER'S WAY,HIS MOTHER'S WAY 
142,HIS MOTHER'S WAY,"Tomps 'ud allus haf to say Somepin' 'bout ""his mother's way.""-- _He_ lived hard-like--never jined Any church of any kind.-- ""It was Mother's way,"" says he, ""To be good enough fer _me_ And her too,--and certinly Lord has heerd _her_ pray!"" Propped up on his dyin' bed,-- ""Shore as Heaven's overhead, I'm a-goin' there,"" he said--- ""It was Mother's way."" "
143,JAP MILLER.,JAP MILLER. 
144,JAP MILLER.,"Jap Miller down at Martinsville's the blamedest feller yit! When _he_ starts in a-talkin' other folks is apt to quit!-- 'Pears like that mouth o' his'n wuz n't made fer nuthin' else But jes' to argify 'em down and gether in their pelts: He'll talk you down on tariff; er he'll talk you down on tax, And prove the pore man pays 'em all--and them's about the fac's!-- Religen, law, er politics, prize-fightin', er base-ball-- Jes' tetch Jap up a little and he'll post you 'bout 'em all.

145,JAP MILLER.,"And the comicalist feller ever tilted back a cheer And tuck a chaw tobacker kind o' like he did n't keer.-- There's where the feller's strength lays,--he's so common-like and plain,-- They haint no dude about old Jap, you bet you--nary grain! They 'lected him to Council and it never turned his head, And did n't make no differunce what anybody said,-- He didn't dress no finer, ner rag out in fancy clothes; But his voice in Council-meetin's is a turrer to his foes. "
146,JAP MILLER.,"He's fer the pore man ever' time!  And in the last campaign He stumped old Morgan County, through the sunshine and the rain, And helt the banner up'ards from a-trailin' in the dust, And cut loose on monopolies and cuss'd and cuss'd and cuss'd! He'd tell some funny story ever' now and then, you know, Tel, blame it! it wuz better 'n a jack-o'-lantern show! And I'd go furder, yit, to-day, to hear old Jap norate Than any high-toned orator 'at ever stumped the State! "
147,JAP MILLER.,"W'y, that-air blame Jap Miller, with his keen sircastic fun, Has got more friends than ary candidate 'at ever run! Do n't matter what _his_ views is, when he states the same to you, They allus coincide with your'n, the same as two and two: You _can't_ take issue with him--er, at least, they haint no sense In startin' in to down him, so you better not commence.-- The best way's jes' to listen, like your humble servant does, And jes' concede Jap Miller is the best man ever wuz!

150,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"Herein are blown from out the South Songs blithe as those of Pan's pursed mouth-- As sweet in voice as, in perfume, The night-breath of magnolia-bloom. "
151,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"Such sumptuous languor lures the sense-- Such luxury of indolence-- The eyes blur as a nymph's might blur, With water-lilies watching her. "
152,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"You waken, thrilling at the trill Of some wild bird that seems to spill The silence full of winey drips Of song that Fancy sips and sips. "
153,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"Betimes, in brambled lanes wherethrough The chipmunk stripes himself from view, You pause to lop a creamy spray Of elder-blossoms by the way. "
154,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"Or where the morning dew is yet Gray on the topmost rail, you set A sudden palm and, vaulting, meet Your vaulting shadow in the wheat. "
155,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"On lordly swards, of suave incline, Entessellate with shade and shine, You shall misdoubt your lowly birth, Clad on as one of princely worth: "
156,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,The falcon on your wrist shall ride-- Your milk-white Arab side by side With one of raven-black.--You fain Would kiss the hand that holds the rein. 
157,A SOUTHERN SINGER.,"Nay, nay, Romancer!  Poet!  Seer! Sing us back home--from there to here; Grant your high grace and wit, but we Most honor your simplicity.-- "

159,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,A DREAM OF AUTUMN. 
160,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Mellow hazes, lowly trailing Over wood and meadow, veiling Somber skies, with wildfowl sailing Sailor-like to foreign lands; And the north-wind overleaping Summer's brink, and floodlike sweeping Wrecks of roses where the weeping Willows wring their helpless hands. "
161,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Flared, like Titan torches flinging Flakes of flame and embers, springing From the vale the trees stand swinging In the moaning atmosphere; While in dead'ning-lands the lowing Of the cattle, sadder growing, Fills the sense to overflowing With the sorrow of the year. "
162,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Sorrowfully, yet the sweeter Sings the brook in rippled meter Under boughs that lithely teeter Lorn birds, answering from the shores Through the viny, shady-shiny Interspaces, shot with tiny Flying motes that fleck the winy Wave-engraven sycamores. "
163,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Fields of ragged stubble, wrangled With rank weeds, and shocks of tangled Corn, with crests like rent plumes dangled Over Harvest's battle-piain; And the sudden whir and whistle Of the quail that, like a missile, Whizzes over thorn and thistle, And, a missile, drops again. "
164,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Muffled voices, hid in thickets Where the redbird stops to stick its Ruddy beak betwixt the pickets Of the truant's rustic trap; And the sound of laughter ringing Where, within the wild-vine swinging, Climb Bacchante's schoolmates, flinging Purple clusters in her lap. "
165,A DREAM OF AUTUMN.,"Rich as wine, the sunset flashes Round the tilted world, and dashes Up the sloping west and splashes Red foam over sky and sea-- Till my dream of Autumn, paling In the splendor all-prevailing, Like a sallow leaf goes sailing Down the silence solemnly. "
166,TOM VAN ARDEN.,TOM VAN ARDEN. 
167,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Our warm fellowship is one Far too old to comprehend Where its bond was first begun: Mirage-like before my gaze Gleams a land of other days, Where two truant boys, astray, Dream their lazy lives away. "
168,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"There's a vision, in the guise Of Midsummer, where the Past Like a weary beggar lies In the shadow Time has cast; And as blends the bloom of trees With the drowsy hum of bees, Fragrant thoughts and murmurs blend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. "
169,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, All the pleasures we have known Thrill me now as I extend This old hand and grasp your own-- Feeling, in the rude caress, All affection's tenderness; Feeling, though the touch be rough, Our old souls are soft enough. "
170,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"So we'll make a mellow hour: Fill your pipe, and taste the wine-- Warp your face, if it be sour, I can spare a smile from mine; If it sharpen up your wit, Let me feel the edge of it-- I have eager ears to lend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. "
171,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Are we ""lucky dogs,"" indeed? Are we all that we pretend In the jolly life we lead?-- Bachelors, we must confess, Boast of ""single blessedness"" To the world, but not alone-- Man's best sorrow is his own! "
172,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"And the saddest truth is this,-- Life to us has never proved What we tasted in the kiss Of the women we have loved: Vainly we congratulate Our escape from such a fate As their lying lips could send, Tom Van Arden, my old friend! "
173,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Hearts, like fruit upon the stem, Ripen sweetest, I contend, As the frost falls over them: Your regard for me to-day Makes November taste of May, And through every vein of rhyme Pours the blood of summertime. "
174,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"When our souls are cramped with youth Happiness seems far away In the future, while, in truth, We look back on it to-day Through our tears, nor dare to boast,-- ""Better to have loved and lost!"" Broken hearts are hard to mend, Tom Van Arden, my old friend. "
175,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, I grow prosy, and you tire; Fill the glasses while I bend To prod up the failing fire . . . You are restless:--I presume There's a dampness in the room.-- Much of warmth our nature begs, With rheumatics in our legs! . . . "
176,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Humph! the legs we used to fling Limber-jointed in the dance, When we heard the fiddle ring Up the curtain of Romance, And in crowded public halls Played with hearts like jugglers'-balls.-- _Feats of mountebanks, depend_!-- Tom Van Arden, my old friend. "
177,TOM VAN ARDEN.,"Tom Van Arden, my old friend, Pardon, then, this theme of mine: While the fire-light leaps to lend Higher color to the wine,-- I propose a health to those Who have _homes_, and home's repose, Wife- and child-love without end! . . . Tom Van Arden, my old friend. "

179,JUST TO BE GOOD.,"Just to be good-- This is enough--enough! O we who find sin's billows wild and rough, Do we not feel how more than any gold Would be the blameless life we led of old While yet our lips knew but a mother's kiss? Ah! though we miss All else but this, To be good is enough! "
180,JUST TO BE GOOD.,"It is enough-- Enough--just to be good! To lift our hearts where they are understood; To let the thirst for worldly power and place Go unappeased; to smile back in God's face With the glad lips our mothers used to kiss. Ah! though we miss All else but this, To be good is enough! "

184,HOME AT NIGHT.,"When buzzing things, with double wings Of crisp and raspish flutterings, Go whizzing by so very nigh One thinks of fangs and stings:-- "

186,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD. 
187,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,"The Hoosier Folk-Child--all unsung-- Unlettered all of mind and tongue; Unmastered, unmolested--made Most wholly frank and unafraid: Untaught of any school--unvexed Of law or creed--all unperplexed-- Unsermoned, aye, and undefiled, An all imperfect-perfect child-- A type which (Heaven forgive us!) you And I do tardy honor to, And so, profane the sanctities Of our most sacred memories. Who, growing thus from boy to man, That dares not be American? Go, Pride, with prudent underbuzz-- Go _whistle_! as the Folk-Child does. "
188,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,"The Hoosier Folk-Child's world is not Much wider than the stable-lot Between the house and highway fence That bounds the home his father rents. His playmates mostly are the ducks And chickens, and the boy that ""shucks Corn by the shock,"" and talks of town, And whether eggs are ""up"" or ""down,"" And prophesies in boastful tone Of ""owning horses of his own,"" And ""being his own man,"" and ""when He gets to be, what he'll do then.""-- Takes out his jack-knife dreamily And makes the Folk-Child two or three Crude corn-stalk figures,--a wee span Of horses and a little man. "
189,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,"The Hoosier Folk-Child's eyes are wise And wide and round as Brownies' eyes: The smile they wear is ever blent With all-expectant wonderment,-- On homeliest things they bend a look As rapt as o'er a picture-book, And seem to ask, whate'er befall, The happy reason of it all:-- Why grass is all so glad a green, And leaves--and what their lispings mean;-- Why buds grow on the boughs, and why They burst in blossom by and by-- As though the orchard in the breeze Had shook and popped its _popcorn-trees_, To lure and whet, as well they might, Some seven-league giant's appetite! "
190,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,"The Hoosier Folk-Child's chubby face Has scant refinement, caste or grace,-- From crown to chin, and cheek to cheek, It bears the grimy water-streak Of rinsings such as some long rain Might drool across the window-pane Wherethrough he peers, with troubled frown, As some lorn team drives by for town. His brow is elfed with wispish hair, With tangles in it here and there, As though the warlocks snarled it so At midmirk when the moon sagged low, And boughs did toss and skreek and shake, And children moaned themselves awake, With fingers clutched, and starting sight Blind as the blackness of the night! "
191,THE HOOSIER FOLK-CHILD.,"The Hoosier Folk-Child!--Rich is he In all the wealth of poverty! He owns nor title nor estate, Nor speech but half articulate,-- He owns nor princely robe nor crown;-- Yet, draped in patched and faded brown, He owns the bird-songs of the hills-- The laughter of the April rills; And his are all the diamonds set. In Morning's dewy coronet,-- And his the Dusk's first minted stars That twinkle through the pasture-bars, And litter all the skies at night With glittering scraps of silver light;-- The rainbow's bar, from rim to rim, In beaten gold, belongs to him.

197,WHILE THE MUSICIAN PLAYED.,"Our silken sails in lazy folds Drooped in the breathless breeze: As o'er a field of marigolds Our eyes swam o'er the seas; While here the eddies lisped and purled Around the island's rim, And up from out the underworld We saw the mermen swim. "
198,WHILE THE MUSICIAN PLAYED.,"And it was dawn and middle-day And midnight--for the moon On silver rounds across the bay Had climbed the skies of June-- And there the glowing, glorious king Of day ruled o'er his realm, With stars of midnight glittering About his diadem. "
199,WHILE THE MUSICIAN PLAYED.,"The seagull reeled on languid wing In circles round the mast, We heard the songs the sirens sing As we went sailing past; And up and down the golden sands A thousand fairy throngs Flung at us from their flashing hands The echoes of their songs. "

204,AUGUST.,"Upon the gleaming harvest-field remote The thresher lies deserted, like some old Dismantled galleon that hangs afloat Upon a sea of gold. "
205,AUGUST.,"The yearning cry of some bewildered bird Above an empty nest, and truant boys Along the river's shady margin heard-- A harmony of noise-- "

207,AUGUST.,"And through the hazy veil the atmosphere Has draped about the gleaming face of Day, The sifted glances of the sun appear In splinterings of spray. "
208,AUGUST.,"The dusty highway, like a cloud of dawn, Trails o'er the hillside, and the passer-by, A tired ghost in misty shroud, toils on His journey to the sky. "
209,AUGUST.,"And down across the valley's drooping sweep, Withdrawn to farthest limit of the glade, The forest stands in silence, drinking deep Its purple wine of shade. "
210,AUGUST.,The gossamer floats up on phantom wing; The sailor-vision voyages the skies And carries into chaos everything That freights the weary eyes:

Nay, Leave always his eyes clear and glad, although Mine own, dear Lord, do fill to overflow; Let his remembered features, as I pray, Smile ever on me!  Ah! what stress of love Thou givest me to guard with Thee thiswise: Its fullest speech ever to be denied Mine own--being his mother!

227,JUNE AT WOODRUFF.,"Out at Woodruff Place the Muse Dips her sandal in the dews, Sacredly as night and dawn Baptize lilied grove and lawn: Woody path, or paven way-- She doth haunt them night and day,-- Sun or moonlight through the trees, To her eyes, are melodies. "

232,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I must tell you all about it!  But I'll have to deviate A little in beginning so's to set the matter straight As to how it comes to happen that I never took a wife-- Kind o' ""crawfish"" from the Present to the Springtime of my life! "
233,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I was brought up in the country: Of a family of five-- Three brothers and a sister--I'm the only one alive,-- Fer they all died little babies; and 'twas one o' Mother's ways, You know, to want a daughter; so she took a girl to raise. "
234,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"The sweetest little thing she was, with rosy cheeks, and fat-- We was little chunks o' shavers then about as high as that! But someway we sort o' _suited_-like! and Mother she'd declare She never laid her eyes on a more lovin' pair "

236,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I was then a lad o' twenty; and I felt a flash o' pride In thinkin' all depended on _me_ now to pervide Fer Mother and fer Mary; and I went about the place With sleeves rolled up--and workin', with a mighty smilin' face.-- "
237,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Fer _sompin' else_ was workin'! but not a word I said Of a certain sort o' notion that was runnin' through my head,-- ""Someday I'd mayby marry, and _a brother's_ love was one Thing--a _lover's_ was another!"" was the way the notion run! "
238,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I remember onc't in harvest, when the ""cradle-in'"" was done-- When the harvest of my summers mounted up to twenty-one-- I was ridin' home with Mary at the closin' o' the day-- A-chawin' straws and thinkin', in a lover's lazy way! "

242,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I don't know how I acted--I don't know _what_ I said, Fer my heart seemed jest a-turnin' to an ice-cold lump o' lead; And the hosses kind o' glimmered before me in the road, And the lines fell from my fingers--and that was all I knowed-- "
243,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Fer--well, I don't know how long--They's a dim rememberence Of a sound o' snortin' bosses, and a stake-and-ridered fence A-whizzin' past, and wheat-sheaves a-dancin' in the air, And Mary screamin' ""Murder!"" and a-runnin' up to where "
244,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"_I_ was layin' by the roadside, and the wagon upside down A-leanin' on the gate-post, with the wheels a whirlin' round! And I tried to raise and meet her, but I couldn't, with a vague Sort o' notion comin' to me that I had a broken leg. "
245,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Well, the women nussed me through it; but many a time I'd sigh As I'd keep a-gittin' better instid o' goin' to die, And wonder what was left _me_ worth livin' fer below, When the girl I loved was married to another, don't you know! "
246,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And my thoughts was as rebellious as the folks was good and kind When Brown and Mary married--Railly must a-been my _mind_ Was kindo' out o' kilter!--fer I hated Brown, you see, Worse'n _pizen_--and the feller whittled crutches out fer _me_-- "
247,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,And done a thousand little ac's o' kindness and respec'-- And me a-wishin' all the time that I could break his neck! My relief was like a mourner's when the funeral is done When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o' Forty-one. 
248,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Then I went to work in airnest--I had nothin' much in view But to drownd out rickollections--and it kep' me busy, too! But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day. "
249,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Then I'd think how little _money_ was, compared to happiness-- And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess! But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year, Tel I'm payin' half the taxes in the county, mighty near! "
250,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Well!--A year ago er better, a letter comes to hand Astin' how I 'd like to dicker fer some Illinois land-- ""The feller that had owned it,"" it went ahead to state, ""Had jest deceased, insolvent, leavin' chance to speculate,""-- "
251,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And then it closed by sayin' that I'd ""better come and see.""-- I'd never been West, anyhow--a most too wild fer me, I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town Said I'd find myself mistakend when I come to look around. "
252,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"So I bids good-bye to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train, A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again-- And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be, I think it's more 'n likely she'd a-went along with me! "
253,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast! But finally they called out my stopping-place at last: And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' I was a train O' cars, and _skeered_ at sumpin', runnin' down a country lane! "
254,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Well, in the mornin' airly--after huntin' up the man-- The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land-- We started fer the country;' and I ast the history Of the farm--its former owner--and so-forth, etcetery! "
255,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And--well--it was _interestin'_--I su'prised him, I suppose, By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!-- But his su'prise was greater, and it made him wonder more, When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!-- "

Though you may marvel much That _we_, who see by sense of touch And taste and hearing, see things _you_ May never look upon; and true Is it that even in the scent Of blossoms _we_ find something meant No eyes have in their faces read, Or wept to see interpreted. "
280,BLIND.,"And you might think it strange if now I told you you were smiling.  How Do I know that?  I hold your hand-- _Its_ language I can understand-- Give both to me, and I will show You many other things I know. Listen:  We never met before Till now?--Well, you are something lower Than five-feet-eight in height; and you Are slender; and your eyes are blue-- "
281,BLIND.,"Your mother's eyes--your mother's hair-- Your mother's likeness everywhere Save in your walk--and that is quite Your father's; nervous.--Am I right? I thought so.  And you used to sing, But have neglected everything Of vocalism--though you may Still thrum on the guitar, and play A little on the violin,-- I know that by the callous in The finger-tips of your left hand-- And, by-the-bye, though nature planned You as most men, you are, I see, ""_Left_-handed,"" too,--the mystery Is clear, though,--your right arm has been Broken, to ""break"" the left one in. And so, you see, though blind of sight, I still have ways of seeing quite Too well for you to sympathize Excessively, with your good eyes.-- Though _once_, perhaps, to be sincere, Within the whole asylum here, From cupola to basement hall, I was the blindest of them all! "
282,BLIND.,"Let us move further down the walk-- The man here waiting hears my talk, And is disturbed; besides, he may Not be quite friendly anyway. In fact--(this will be far enough; Sit down)--the man just spoken of Was once a friend of mine.  He came For treatment here from Burlingame-- A rich though brilliant student there, Who read his eyes out of repair, And groped his way up here, where we Became acquainted, and where he Met one of our girl-teachers, and, If you 'll believe me, asked her hand In marriage, though the girl was blind As I am--and the girl _declined_. Odd, wasn't it?  Look, you can see Him waiting there.  Fine, isn't he? And handsome, eloquently wide And high of brow, and dignified With every outward grace, his sight Restored to him, clear and bright As day-dawn; waiting, waiting still For the blind girl that never will Be wife of his.  How do I know? You will recall a while ago I told you he and I were friends. In all that friendship comprehends, I was his friend, I swear! why now, Remembering his love, and how His confidence was all my own, I hear, in fancy, the low tone Of his deep voice, so full of pride And passion, yet so pacified With his affliction, that it seems An utterance sent out of dreams Of saddest melody, withal So sorrowfully musical It was, and is, must ever be-- But I'm digressing, pardon me. _I_ knew not anything of love In those days, but of that above All worldly passion,--for my art-- Music,--and that, with all my heart And soul, blent in a love too great For words of mine to estimate. And though among my pupils she Whose love my friend sought came to me I only knew her fingers' touch Because they loitered overmuch In simple scales, and needs must be Untangled almost constantly. But she was bright in other ways, And quick of thought, with ready plays Of wit, and with a voice as sweet To listen to as one might meet In any oratorio-- And once I gravely told her so,-- And, at my words, her limpid tone Of laughter faltered to a moan, And fell from that into a sigh That quavered all so wearily, That I, without the tear that crept Between the keys, had known she wept; And yet the hand I reached for then She caught away, and laughed again. And when that evening I strolled With my old friend, I, smiling, told Him I believed the girl and he Were matched and mated perfectly: He was so noble; she, so fair Of speech, and womanly of air; He, strong, ambitious; she, as mild And artless even as a child; And with a nature, I was sure, As worshipful as it was pure And sweet, and brimmed with tender things Beyond his rarest fancyings. He stopped me solemnly.  He knew, He said, how good, and just, and true Was all I said of her; but as For his own virtues, let them pass, Since they were nothing to the one That he had set his heart upon; For but that morning she had turned Forever from him.  Then I learned That for a month he had delayed His going from us, with no aid Of hope to hold him,--meeting still Her ever firm denial, till Not even in his new-found sight He found one comfort or delight. And as his voice broke there, I felt The brother-heart within me melt In warm compassion for his own That throbbed so utterly alone. And then a sudden fancy hit Along my brain; and coupling it With a belief that I, indeed, Might help my friend in his great need, I warmly said that I would go Myself, if he decided so, And see her for him--that I knew My pleadings would be listened to Most seriously, and that she Should love him, listening to me. Go; bless me!  And that was the last-- The last time his warm hand shut fast Within my own--so empty since, That the remembered finger-prints I 've kissed a thousand times, and wet Them with the tears of all regret! "
283,BLIND.,"I know not how to rightly tell How fared my quest, and what befell Me, coming in the presence of That blind girl, and her blinder love. I know but little else than that Above the chair in which she sat I leant--reached for, and found her hand, And held it for a moment, and Took up the other--held them both-- As might a friend, I will take oath: Spoke leisurely, as might a man Praying for no thing other than He thinks Heaven's justice;--She was blind, I said, and yet a noble mind Most truly loved her; one whose fond Clear-sighted vision looked beyond The bounds of her infirmity, And saw the woman, perfectly Modeled, and wrought out pure and true And lovable.  She quailed, and drew Her hands away, but closer still I caught them.  ""Rack me as you will!"" She cried out sharply--""Call me 'blind'-- Love ever is--I am resigned! Blind is your friend; as blind as he Am I--but blindest of the three-- Yea, blind as death--you will not see My love for you is killing me!"" "
284,BLIND.,"There is a memory that may Not ever wholly fade away From out my heart, so bright and fair The light of it still glimmers there. Why, it did seem as though my sight Flamed back upon me, dazzling white And godlike.  Not one other word Of hers I listened for or heard, But I _saw_ songs sung in her eyes Till they did swoon up drowning-wise, As my mad lips did strike her own And we flashed one and one alone! Ah! was it treachery for me To kneel there, drinking eagerly That torrent-flow of words that swept Out laughingly the tears she wept?-- Sweet words!  O sweeter far, maybe, Than light of day to those that see,-- God knows, who did the rapture send To me, and hold it from my friend. "
285,BLIND.,"And we were married half a year Ago,--and he is--waiting here, Heedless of that--or anything, But just that he is lingering To say good-bye to her, and bow-- As you may see him doing now,-- For there's her footstep in the hall; God bless her!--help him!--save us all! "

385,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The man that rooms next door to me: Two weeks ago, this very night, He took possession quietly, As any other lodger might-- But why the room next mine should so Attract him I was vexed to know,-- Because his quietude, in fine, Was far superior to mine. "
386,THE QUIET LODGER.,"""Now, I like quiet, truth to tell, A tranquil life is sweet to me-- But _this_,"" I sneered, ""suits me too well.-- He shuts his door so noiselessly, And glides about so very mute, In each mysterious pursuit, His silence is oppressive, and Too deep for me to understand."" "
387,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Sometimes, forgetting book or pen, I've found my head in breathless poise Lifted, and dropped in shame again, Hearing some alien ghost of noise-- Some smothered sound that seemed to be A trunk-lid dropped unguardedly, Or the crisp writhings of some quire Of manuscript thrust in the fire. "
388,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Then I have climbed, and closed in vain My transom, opening in the hall; Or close against the window-pane Have pressed my fevered face,--but all The day or night without held not A sight or sound or counter-thought To set my mind one instant free Of this man's silent mastery. "
389,THE QUIET LODGER.,"And often I have paced the floor With muttering anger, far at night, Hearing, and cursing, o'er and o'er, The muffled noises, and the light And tireless movements of this guest Whose silence raged above my rest Hoarser than howling storms at sea-- The man that rooms next door to me. "
390,THE QUIET LODGER.,"But twice or thrice, upon the stair, I've seen his face--most strangely wan,-- Each time upon me unaware He came--smooth'd past me, and was gone. So like a whisper he went by, I listened after, ear and eye, Nor could my chafing fancy tell The meaning of one syllable. "
391,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Last night I caught him, face to face,-- He entering his room, and I Glaring from mine: He paused a space And met my scowl all shrinkingly, But with full gentleness:  The key Turned in his door--and I could see It tremblingly withdrawn and put Inside, and then--the door was shut. "
392,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Then silence.  _Silence_!--why, last night The silence was tumultuous, And thundered on till broad daylight;-- O never has it stunned me thus!-- It rolls, and moans, and mumbles yet.-- Ah, God! how loud may silence get When man mocks at a brother man Who answers but as silence can! "
393,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The silence grew, and grew, and grew, Till at high noon to-day 'twas heard Throughout the house; and men flocked through The echoing halls, with faces blurred With pallor, gloom, and fear, and awe, And shuddering at what they saw-- The quiet lodger, as he lay Stark of the life he cast away.

397,THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"O the waiting in the watches of the night! In the darkness, desolation, and contrition and affright; The awful hush that holds us shut away from all delight: The ever weary memory that ever weary goes Recounting ever over every aching loss it knows-- The ever weary eyelids gasping ever for repose-- In the dreary, weary watches of the night! "
398,THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Dark--stifling dark--the watches of the night! With tingling nerves at tension, how the blackness flashes white With spectral visitations smitten past the inner sight!-- What shuddering sense of wrongs we've wrought that may not be redressed-- Of tears we did not brush away--of lips we left unpressed, And hands that we let fall, with all their loyalty unguessed! Ah! the empty, empty watches of the night! "
399,THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"What solace in the watches of the night?-- What frailest staff of hope to stay--what faintest shaft of light? Do we _dream_ and dare _believe_ it, that by never weight of right Of our own poor weak deservings, we shall win the dawn at last-- Our famished souls find freedom from this penance for the past, In a faith that leaps and lightens from the gloom that flees aghast-- Shall we survive the watches of the night? "
400,THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"One leads us through the watches of the night-- By the ceaseless intercession of our loved ones lost to sight He is with us through all trials, in His mercy and His might;-- With our mothers there about Him, all our sorrow disappears, Till the silence of our sobbing is the prayer the Master hears, And His hand is laid upon us with the tenderness of tears In the waning of the watches of the night.

Stay thy chattering chin, And reel the tauntings of thy vain tongue in, Nor tempt me further with thy vaporish boast That I am _helpless_ to combat thee!  Well, Have at thee, then!  Yet if a doom most dire Thou wouldst escape, flee whilst thou canst!--Revile Me not, Miasmic Mist!--Rank Air! _retire_!

Go, and be forgot As death forgets!"" their glitter _hissed_ (So _seemed_ it) in their hatred.  Ho! Dared any mortal front her so?-- Tempestuous eyebrows knitted down-- Tense nostril, mouth--no muscle slack,-- And black--the suffocating black-- The stifling blackness of her frown! "
415,THE QUARREL.,"Ah! but the lifted face of her! And the twitched lip and tilted head! Yet he did neither wince nor stir,-- Only--his hands clenched; and, instead Of words, he answered with a stare That stammered not in aught it said, As might his voice if trusted there. "
416,THE QUARREL.,"And what--what spake his steady gaze?-- Was there a look that harshly fell To scoff her?--or a syllable Of anger?--or the bitter phrase That myrrhs the honey of love's lips, Or curdles blood as poison drips? What made their breasts to heave and swell As billows under bows of ships In broken seas on stormy days? We may not know--nor _they_ indeed-- What mercy found them in their need. "
417,THE QUARREL.,"A sudden sunlight smote the gloom; And round about them swept a breeze, With faint breaths as of clover-bloom; A bird was heard, through drone of bees,-- Then, far and clear and eerily, A child's voice from an orchard-tree-- Then laughter, sweet as the perfume Of lilacs, could the hearing see. And he--O Love! he fed thy name On bruis√©d kisses, while her dim Deep eyes, with all their inner flame, Like drowning gems were turned on him. "

427,II.,"But with a sense of nameless dread, I turned me, from the merry face Of this newcomer, to my dead; And, kneeling there a space, "

431,JOHN BROWN.,JOHN BROWN. 
432,JOHN BROWN.,"Writ in between the lines of his life-deed We trace the sacred service of a heart Answering the Divine command, in every part Bearing on human weal: His love did feed The loveless; and his gentle hands did lead The blind, and lift the weak, and balm the smart Of other wounds than rankled at the dart In his own breast, that gloried thus to bleed. He served the lowliest first--nay, them alone-- The most despised that e'er wreaked vain breath In cries of suppliance in the reign whereat Red Guilt sate squat upon her spattered throne.-- For these doomed there it was he went to death.

If she sorrow--lo! her face It is like a flowery space In bright meadows, overlaid With light clouds and lulled with shade If she laugh--it is the trill Of the wayward whippoorwill Over upland pastures, heard Echoed by the mocking-bird In dim thickets dense with bloom And blurred cloyings of perfume. If she sigh--a zephyr swells Over odorous asphodels And wan lilies in lush plots Of moon-drown'd forget-me-nots. Then, the soft touch of her hand-- Takes all breath to understand What to liken it thereto!-- Never roseleaf rinsed with dew Might slip soother-suave than slips Her slow palm, the while her lips Swoon through mine, with kiss on kiss Sweet as heated honey is.

441,Y.,"Grand Haven is in Michigan, and in possession, too, Of as many rare attractions as our party ever knew:-- The fine hotel, the landlord, and the lordly bill of fare, And the dainty-neat completeness of the pretty waiters there; The touch on the piano in the parlor, and the trill Of the exquisite soprano, in our fancy singing still; Our cozy room, its comfort, and our thousand grateful tho'ts, And at our door the gentle face Of H. Y. Potts! "
442,Y.,"His artless observations, and his drollery of style, Bewildered with that sorrowful serenity of smile-- The eye's elusive twinkle, and the twitching of the lid, Like he didn't go to say it and was sorry that he did. O Artemus of Michigan! so worthy of the name, Our manager indorses it, and Bill Nye does the same-- You tickled our affection in so many tender spots That even Recollection laughs At H. Y. Potts! "
443,Y.,"And hark ye!  O Grand Haven! count your rare attractions o'er-- The commerce of your ships at sea, and ships along the shore; Your railroads, and your industries, and interests untold, Your Opera House--our lecture, and the gate-receipts in gold!-- Ay, Banner Town of Michigan! count all your treasures through-- Your crowds of summer tourists, and your Sanitarium, too; Your lake, your beach, your drives, your breezy groves and grassy plots, But head the list of all of these With H.

Elizabeth! "

484,II.,"Elizabeth!  Lo, lily-fair, In deep, cool shadows of thy hair, Thy face maintaineth its repose.-- Is it, O sister of the rose, So better, sweeter, blooming thus Than in this briery world with us?-- Where frost o'ertaketh, and the breath Of biting winter harrieth With sleeted rains and blighting snows All fairest blooms--Elizabeth!

492,DAN PAINE.,"Old friend of mine, whose chiming name Has been the burthen of a rhyme Within my heart since first I came To know thee in thy mellow prime; With warm emotions in my breast That can but coldly be expressed, And hopes and wishes wild and vain, I reach my hand to thee, Dan Paine. "
493,DAN PAINE.,"In fancy, as I sit alone In gloomy fellowship with care, I hear again thy cheery tone, And wheel for thee an easy chair; And from my hand the pencil falls-- My book upon the carpet sprawls, As eager soul and heart and brain, Leap up to welcome thee, Dan Paine. "
494,DAN PAINE.,"A something gentle in thy mein, A something tender in thy voice, Has made my trouble so serene, I can but weep, from very choice. And even then my tears, I guess, Hold more of sweet than bitterness, And more of gleaming shine than rain, Because of thy bright smile, Dan Paine. "
495,DAN PAINE.,"The wrinkles that the years have spun And tangled round thy tawny face, Are kinked with laughter, every one, And fashioned in a mirthful grace. And though the twinkle of thine eyes Is keen as frost when Summer dies, It can not long as frost remain While thy warm soul shines out, Dan Paine. "
496,DAN PAINE.,"And so I drain a health to thee;-- May merry Joy and jolly Mirth Like children clamber on thy knee, And ride thee round the happy earth! And when, at last, the hand of Fate Shall lift the latch of Canaan's gate, And usher me in thy domain, Smile on me just as now, Dan Paine. "

502,II.,II. 
503,II.,"The boughs about me spread a shade That shields me from the sun, but weaves With breezy shuttles through the leaves Blue rifts of skies, to gleam and fade Upon the eyes that only see Just of themselves, all drowsily. "
504,III.,III. 
505,III.,"Above me drifts the fallen skein Of some tired spider, looped and blown, As fragile as a strand of rain, Across the air, and upward thrown By breaths of hayfields newly mown-- So glimmering it is and fine, I doubt these drowsy eyes of mine. "
506,IV.,IV. 
507,IV.,"Far-off and faint as voices pent In mines, and heard from underground, Come murmurs as of discontent, And clamorings of sullen sound The city sends me, as, I guess, To vex me, though they do but bless Me in my drowsy fastnesses. "

509,V.,"I have no care.  I only know My hammock hides and holds me here In lands of shade a prisoner: While lazily the breezes blow Light leaves of sunshine over me, And back and forth and to and fro I swing, enwrapped in some hushed glee, Smiling at all things drowsily. "

511,A LOUNGER.,"He leant against a lamp-post, lost In some mysterious reverie: His head was bowed; his arms were crossed; He yawned, and glanced evasively: Uncrossed his arms, and slowly put Them back again, and scratched his side-- Shifted his weight from foot to foot, And gazed out no-ward, idle-eyed. "
512,A LOUNGER.,"Grotesque of form and face and dress, And picturesque in every way-- A figure that from day to day Drooped with a limper laziness; A figure such as artists lean, In pictures where distress is seen, Against low hovels where we guess No happiness has ever been. "

514,A SONG OF LONG AGO.,A song of Long Ago: Sing it lightly--sing it low-- Sing it softly--like the lisping of the lips we used to know When our baby-laughter spilled From the glad hearts ever filled With music blithe as robin ever trilled! 
515,A SONG OF LONG AGO.,"Let the fragrant summer-breeze, And the leaves of locust-trees, And the apple-buds and blossoms, and the wings of honey-bees, All palpitate with glee, Till the happy harmony Brings back each childish joy to you and me. "
516,A SONG OF LONG AGO.,"Let the eyes of fancy turn Where the tumbled pippins burn Like embers in the orchard's lap of tangled grass and fern,-- There let the old path wind In and out and on behind The cider-press that chuckles as we grind. "
517,A SONG OF LONG AGO.,"Blend in the song the moan Of the dove that grieves alone, And the wild whir of the locust, and the bumble's drowsy drone; And the low of cows that call Through the pasture-bars when all The landscape fades away at evenfall. "
518,A SONG OF LONG AGO.,"Then, far away and clear, Through the dusky atmosphere, Let the wailing of the kildee be the only sound we hear: O sad and sweet and low As the memory may know Is the glad-pathetic song of Long Ago! "

535,AUTUMN.,"As a harvester, at dusk, Faring down some woody trail Leading homeward through the musk Of may-apple and pawpaw, Hazel-bush, and spice and haw,-- So comes Autumn, swart and hale, Drooped of frame and slow of stride. But withal an air of pride Looming up in stature far Higher than his shoulders are; Weary both in arm and limb, Yet the wholesome heart of him Sheer at rest and satisfied. "
536,AUTUMN.,"Greet him as with glee of drums And glad cymbals, as he comes! Robe him fair, O Rain and Shine. He the Emperor--the King-- Royal lord of everything Sagging Plenty's granary floors And out-bulging all her doors; He the god of corn and wine, Honey, milk, and fruit and oil-- Lord of feast, as lord of toil-- Jocund host of yours and mine! "
537,AUTUMN.,"Ho! the revel of his laugh!-- Half is sound of winds, and half Roar of ruddy blazes drawn Up the throats of chimneys wide, Circling which, from side to side, Faces--lit as by the Dawn, With her highest tintings on Tip of nose, and cheek, and chin-- Smile at some old fairy-tale Of enchanted lovers, in Silken gown and coat of mail, With a retinue of elves Merry as their very selves, Trooping ever, hand in hand, Down the dales of Wonderland. "
538,AUTUMN.,"Then the glory of his song!-- Lifting up his dreamy eyes-- Singing haze across the skies; Singing clouds that trail along Towering tops of trees that seize Tufts of them to stanch the breeze; Singing slanted strands of rain In between the sky and earth, For the lyre to mate the mirth And the might of his refrain: Singing southward-flying birds Down to us, and afterwards Singing them to flight again; Singing blushes to the cheeks Of the leaves upon the trees-- Singing on and changing these Into pallor, slowly wrought, Till the little, moaning creeks Bear them to their last farewell, As Elaine, the lovable, Was borne down to Lancelot.-- Singing drip of tears, and then Drying them with smiles again. "
539,AUTUMN.,"Singing apple, peach and grape, Into roundest, plumpest shape, Rosy ripeness to the face Of the pippin; and the grace Of the dainty stamin-tip To the huge bulk of the pear, Pendant in the green caress Of the leaves, and glowing through With the tawny laziness Of the gold that Ophir knew,-- Haply, too, within its rind Such a cleft as bees may find, Bungling on it half aware. And wherein to see them sip Fancy lifts an oozy lip, And the singer's falter there. "
540,AUTUMN.,"Sweet as swallows swimming through Eddyings of dusk and dew, Singing happy scenes of home Back to sight of eager eyes That have longed for them to come, Till their coming is surprise Uttered only by the rush Of quick tears and prayerful hush; Singing on, in clearer key, Hearty palms of you and me Into grasps that tingle still Rapturous, and ever will! Singing twank and twang of strings-- Trill of flute and clarinet In a melody that rings Like the tunes we used to play, And our dreams are playing yet! Singing lovers, long astray, Each to each, and, sweeter things-- Singing in their marriage-day, And a banquet holding all These delights for festival. "

544,THE TWINS.,"And the _other_--Well, they say That he's got his Daddy's way O' bein' ruther soberfied, er ruther extry gay,-- That he either cries his best, Er he laughs his howlin'est-- Like all he lacked was buttons and a vest! "
545,THE TWINS.,"Look at _her_!--and look at _him_!-- Talk about yer ""Cheru-_bim_!"" Roll 'em up in dreams together, rosy arm and chubby limb! O we love 'em as the bees Loves the blossoms of the trees, A-ridin' and a-rompin' in the breeze! "

Ah, that my hands Were more than human in their strength, That my deft lariat at length Might safely noose this splendid thing That so defies all conquering! Ho! but to see it whirl and reel-- The sands spurt forward--and to feel The quivering tension of the thong That throned me high, with shriek and song! To grapple tufts of tossing mane-- To spurn it to its feet again, And then, sans saddle, rein or bit, To lash the mad life out of it! "

563,LET US FORGET.,LET US FORGET. 
564,LET US FORGET.,"Let us forget.  What matters it that we Once reigned o'er happy realms of long-ago, And talked of love, and let our voices low, And ruled for some brief sessions royally? What if we sung, or laughed, or wept maybe? It has availed not anything, and so Let it go by that we may better know How poor a thing is lost to you and me. But yesterday I kissed your lips, and yet Did thrill you not enough to shake the dew From your drenched lids--and missed, with no regret, Your kiss shot back, with sharp breaths failing you; And so, to-day, while our worn eyes are wet With all this waste of tears, let us forget!

576,REACH YOUR HAND TO ME.,"Reach your hand to me, my friend, With its heartiest caress-- Sometime there will come an end To its present faithfulness-- Sometime I may ask in vain For the touch of it again, When between us land or sea Holds it ever back from me. "
577,REACH YOUR HAND TO ME.,"Sometime I may need it so, Groping somewhere in the night, It will seem to me as though Just a touch, however light, Would make all the darkness day, And along some sunny way Lead me through an April-shower Of my tears to this fair hour. "
578,REACH YOUR HAND TO ME.,"O the present is too sweet To go on forever thus! Round the corner of the street Who can say what waits for us?-- Meeting--greeting, night and day, Faring each the self-same way-- Still somewhere the path must end.-- Reach your hand to me, my friend! "

580,THE ROSE.,"It tossed its head at the wooing breeze; And the sun, like a bashful swain, Beamed on it through the waving frees With a passion all in vain,-- For my rose laughed in a crimson glee, And hid in the leaves in wait for me. "
581,THE ROSE.,"The honey-bee came there to sing His love through the languid hours, And vaunt of his hives, as a proud old king Might boast of his palace-towers: But my rose bowed in a mockery, And hid in the leaves in wait for me. "
582,THE ROSE.,"The humming-bird, like a courtier gay, Dipped down with a dalliant song, And twanged his wings through the roundelay Of love the whole day long: Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy And hid in the leaves in wait for me. "
583,THE ROSE.,"The firefly came in the twilight dim My red, red rose to woo-- Till quenched was the flame of love in him, And the light of his lantern too, As my rose wept with dew-drops three And hid in the leaves in wait for me. "
584,THE ROSE.,"And I said: I will cult my own sweet rose-- Some day I will claim as mine The priceless worth of the flower that knows No change, but a bloom divine-- The bloom of a fadeless constancy That hides in the leaves in wait for me! "
585,THE ROSE.,"But time passed by in a strange disguise, And I marked it not, but lay In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes, Till the summer slipped away, And a chill wind sang in a minor key: ""Where is the rose that waits for thee?"" "
586,THE ROSE.,*     *     *     *     * 
587,THE ROSE.,"I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain Of bloom on a withered stalk, Pelted down by the autumn rain In the dust of the garden-walk, That an Angel-rose in the world to be Will hide in the leaves in wait for me. "

592,SUSPENSE.,SUSPENSE. 
593,SUSPENSE.,"A woman's figure, on a ground of night Inlaid with sallow stars that dimly stare Down in the lonesome eyes, uplifted there As in vague hope some alien lance of light Might pierce their woe.  The tears that blind her sight-- The salt and bitter blood of her despair-- Her hands toss back through torrents of her hair And grip toward God with anguish infinite. And O the carven mouth, with all its great Intensity of longing frozen fast In such a smile as well may designate The slowly-murdered heart, that, to the last, Conceals each newer wound, and back at Fate Throbs Love's eternal lie--""Lo, I can wait!""

598,BY HER WHITE BED.,BY HER WHITE BED. 
599,BY HER WHITE BED.,"By her white bed I muse a little space: She fell asleep--not very long ago,-- And yet the grass was here and not the snow-- The leaf, the bud, the blossom, and--her face!-- Midsummer's heaven above us, and the grace Of Lovers own day, from dawn to afterglow; The fireflies' glimmering, and the sweet and low Plaint of the whip-poor-wills, and every place In thicker twilight for the roses' scent. Then _night_.--She slept--in such tranquility, I walk atiptoe still, nor _dare_ to weep, Feeling, in all this hush, she rests content-- That though God stood to wake her for me, she Would mutely plead: ""Nay, Lord!  Let _him_ so sleep."" "

601,WE TO SIGH INSTEAD OF SING.,"""Rain and rain! and rain and rain!"" Yesterday we muttered Grimly as the grim refrain That the thunders uttered: All the heavens under cloud-- All the sunshine sleeping; All the grasses limply bowed With their weight of weeping. "
602,WE TO SIGH INSTEAD OF SING.,"Sigh and sigh! and sigh and sigh! Never end of sighing; Rain and rain for our reply-- Hopes half-drowned and dying; Peering through the window-pane, Naught but endless raining-- Endless sighing, and, as vain, Endlessly complaining. "
603,WE TO SIGH INSTEAD OF SING.,"Shine and shine! and shine and shine! Ah! to-day the splendor!-- All this glory yours and mine-- God! but God is tender! We to sigh instead of sing, _Yesterday_, in sorrow, While the Lord was fashioning This for our To-morrow! "

"
606,THE BLOSSOMS ON THE TREES.,"Could the rhymer only wring All the sweetness to the lees Of all the kisses clustering In juicy Used-to-bes, To dip his rhymes therein and sing The blossoms on the trees,-- ""O Blossoms on the Trees,"" He would twitter, trill and coo, ""However sweet, such songs as these Are not as sweet as you:-- For you are _blooming_ melodies The _eyes_ may listen to!"" "

608,A DISCOURAGING MODEL.,"Just the airiest, fairiest slip of a thing, With a Gainsborough hat, like a butterfly's wing, Tilted up at one side with the jauntiest air, And a knot of red roses sown in under there Where the shadows are lost in her hair. "
609,A DISCOURAGING MODEL.,"Then a cameo face, carven in on a ground Of that shadowy hair where the roses are wound; And the gleam of a smile O as fair and as faint And as sweet as the masters of old used to paint Round the lips of their favorite saint! "
610,A DISCOURAGING MODEL.,"And that lace at her throat--and the fluttering hands Snowing there, with a grace that no art understands, The flakes of their touches--first fluttering at The bow--then the roses--the hair--and then that Little tilt of the Gainsborough hat. "
611,A DISCOURAGING MODEL.,"O what artist on earth with a model like this, Holding not on his palette the tint of a kiss, Nor a pigment to hint of the hue of her hair, Nor the gold of her smile--O what artist could dare To expect a result half so fair? "
612,LAST NIGHT--AND THIS.,LAST NIGHT--AND THIS. 
613,LAST NIGHT--AND THIS.,"Last night--how deep the darkness was! And well I knew its depths, because I waded it from shore to shore, Thinking to reach the light no more. "
614,LAST NIGHT--AND THIS.,"She would not even touch my hand.-- The winds rose and the cedars fanned The moon out, and the stars fled back In heaven and hid--and all was black! "
615,LAST NIGHT--AND THIS.,"But ah!  To-night a summons came, Signed with a teardrop for a name,-- For as I wondering kissed it, lo, A line beneath it told me so. "

625,A GLIMPSE OF PAN.,"I caught but a glimpse of him.  Summer was here, And I strayed from the town and its dust and heat And walked in a wood, while the noon was near, Where the shadows were cool, and the atmosphere Was misty with fragrances stirred by my feet From surges of blossoms that billowed sheer O'er the grasses, green and sweet. "
626,A GLIMPSE OF PAN.,"And I peered through a vista of leaning trees, Tressed with long tangles of vines that swept To the face of a river, that answered these With vines in the wave like the vines in the breeze, Till the yearning lips of the ripples crept And kissed them, with quavering ecstacies, And gurgled and laughed and wept. "
627,A GLIMPSE OF PAN.,"And there, like a dream in a swoon, I swear I saw Pan lying,--his limbs in the dew And the shade, and his face in the dazzle and glare Of the glad sunshine; while everywhere, Over, across, and around him blew Filmy dragonflies hither and there, And little white butterflies, two and two, In eddies of odorous air.

629,OUT OF NAZARETH.,"""He shall sleep unscathed of thieves Who loves Allah and believes."" Thus heard one who shared the tent, In the far-off Orient, Of the Bedouin ben Ahrzz-- Nobler never loved the stars Through the palm-leaves nigh the dim Dawn his courser neighed to him! "
630,OUT OF NAZARETH.,"He said: ""Let the sands be swarmed With such thieves as I, and thou Shalt at morning rise, unharmed, Light as eyelash to the brow Of thy camel, amber-eyed, Ever munching either side, Striding still, with nestled knees, Through the midnight's oases. "

Who could be enriched of thee By such hoard of poverty As thy niggard hand pretends To dole me--thy worst of friends? Therefore shouldst thou pause to bless One indeed who blesses thee; Robbing thee, I dispossess But myself.--Pray thou for me!"" "
633,OUT OF NAZARETH.,He shall sleep unscathed of thieves Who loves Allah and believes. 
634,THE WANDERING JEW.,THE WANDERING JEW. 
635,THE WANDERING JEW.,"The stars are failing, and the sky Is like a field of faded flowers; The winds on weary wings go by; The moon hides, and the temptest lowers; And still through every clime and age I wander on a pilgrimage That all men know an idle quest, For that the goal I seek is--REST! "
636,THE WANDERING JEW.,"I hear the voice of summer streams, And, following, I find the brink Of cooling springs, with childish dreams Returning as I bend to drink-- But suddenly, with startled eyes, My face looks on its grim disguise Of long gray beard; and so, distressed, I hasten on, nor taste of rest. "
637,THE WANDERING JEW.,"I come upon a merry group Of children in the dusky wood, Who answer back the owlet's whoop, That laughs as it had understood; And I would pause a little space, But that each happy blossom-face Is like to one His hands have blessed Who sent me forth in search of rest. "
638,THE WANDERING JEW.,"Sometimes I fain would stay my feet In shady lanes, where huddled kine Couch in the grasses cool and sweet, And lift their patient eyes to mine; But I, for thoughts that ever then Go back to Bethlehem again, Must needs fare on my weary quest, And weep for very need of rest. "
639,THE WANDERING JEW.,"Is there no end?  I plead in vain: Lost worlds nor living answer me. Since Pontius Pilate's awful reign Have I not passed eternity? Have I not drank the fetid breath Of every fevered phase of death, And come unscathed through every pest And scourge and plague that promised rest? "
640,THE WANDERING JEW.,"Have I not seen the stars go out That shed their light o'er Galilee, And mighty kingdoms tossed about And crumbled clod-like in the sea? Dead ashes of dead ages blow And cover me like drifting snow, And time laughs on as 'twere a jest That I have any need of rest. "
641,LONGFELLOW.,LONGFELLOW. 
642,LONGFELLOW.,"The winds have talked with him confidingly; The trees have whispered to him; and the night Hath held him gently as a mother might, And taught him all sad tones of melody: The mountains have bowed to him; and the sea, In clamorous waves, and murmurs exquisite, Hath told him all her sorrow and delight-- Her legends fair--her darkest mystery. His verse blooms like a flower, night and day; Bees cluster round his rhymes; and twitterings Of lark and swallow, in an endless May, Are mingling with the tender songs he sings.-- Nor shall he cease to sing--in every lay Of Nature's voice he sings--and will alway.

647,JOHN MCKEEN.,"Tick the clock with a wooden sound, And fill the hearing with childish glee Of rhyming riddle, or story found In the Robinson Crusoe, leather-bound Old book of the Used-to-be! "
648,JOHN MCKEEN.,"John McKeen of the Past!  Ah, John, To have grown ambitious in worldly ways!-- To have rolled your shirt-sleeves down, to don A broadcloth suit, and, forgetful, gone Out on election days! "
649,JOHN MCKEEN.,"John, ah, John! did it prove your worth To yield you the office you still maintain? To fill your pockets, but leave the dearth Of all the happier things on earth To the hunger of heart and brain? "
650,JOHN MCKEEN.,"Under the dusk of your villa trees, Edging the drives where your blooded span Paw the pebbles and wait your ease,-- Where are the children about your knees, And the mirth, and the happy man? "
651,JOHN MCKEEN.,"The blinds of your mansion are battened to; Your faded wife is a close recluse; And your ""finished"" daughters will doubtless do Dutifully all that is willed of you, And marry as you shall choose!-- "
652,JOHN MCKEEN.,"But O for the old-home voices, blent With the watery jingle of pans and spoons, And the motherly chirrup of glad content And neighborly gossip and merriment, And the old-time fiddle-tunes! "

656,THEIR SWEET SORROW.,"The clock, beneath its crystal cup, Discreetly clicks--""Quick!  Act!  Speak up!"" A tension circles both her slender Wrists--and her raised eyes flash in splendor, "

658,THEIR SWEET SORROW.,"Is whispered brokenly, with half A sob, like a belated laugh,-- While cloyingly their blurred kiss closes, Sweet as the dew's lip to the rose's. "

667,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"He lived, it seemed, shut up alone In a low hovel of his own; There cooked his meals and made his bed, Careless of all his neighbors said. "
668,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"His neighbors, too, said many things Expressive of grave wonderings, Since none of them had ever been Within his doors, or peered therein. "
669,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"In fact, grown watchful, they became Assured that Mr. What's-his-name Was up to something wrong--indeed, Small doubt of it, we all agreed. "
670,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"At night were heard strange noises there, When honest people everywhere Had long retired; and his light Was often seen to burn all night. "
671,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"He left his house but seldom--then Would always hurry back again, As though he feared some stranger's knock, Finding him gone, might burst the lock. "
672,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"Beside, he carried, every day, At the one hour he went away, A basket, with the contents hid Beneath its woven willow lid. "
673,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"And so we grew to greatly blame This wary Mr. What's-his-name, And look on him with such distrust His actions seemed to sanction just. "
674,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,But when he died--he died one day-- Dropped in the street while on his way To that old wretched hut of his-- You'll think it strange--perhaps it is-- 
675,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"But when we lifted him, and past The threshold of his home at last, No man of all the crowd but stepped With reverence,--Aye, _quailed_ and _wept_! "
676,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"What was it?  Just a shriek of pain I pray to never hear again-- A withered woman, old and bowed, That fell and crawled and cried aloud-- "
677,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"And kissed the dead man's matted hair-- Lifted his face and kissed him there-- Called to him, as she clutched his hand, In words no one could understand. "
678,MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.,"Insane?  Yes.--Well, we, searching, found An unsigned letter, in a round Free hand, within the dead man's breast: ""Look to my mother--_I'm_ at rest. "
