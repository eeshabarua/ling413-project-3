90,I,
91,I,What should there be in the glimmering lights of a poor fishing-village
92,I,"to fascinate me? Far below, a mile perhaps, I behold them in the"
93,I,darkness and the storm like some phosphorescence of the beach; I see the
94,I,pale tossing of the surf beside them; I hear the continuous roar borne
95,I,up and softened about these heights; and this is night at Taormina.
96,I,There is a weirdness in the scene--the feeling without the reality of
97,I,"mystery; and at evening, I know not why, I cannot sleep without stepping"
98,I,upon the terrace or peering through the panes to see those lights. At
99,I,morning the charm has flown from the shore to the further heights above
100,I,me. I glance at the vast banks of southward-lying cloud that envelop
101,I,"Etna, like deep fog upon the ocean; and then, inevitably, my eyes seek"
102,I,"the double summit of the Taorminian mountain, rising nigh at hand a"
103,I,"thousand feet, almost sheer, less than half a mile westward. The nearer"
104,I,"height, precipice-faced, towers full in front with its crowning ruined"
105,I,"citadel, and discloses, just below the peak, on an arm of rock toward"
106,I,"its right, a hermitage church among the heavily hanging mists. The other"
107,I,"horn of the massive hill, somewhat more remote, behind and to the old"
108,I,"castle's left, exposes on its slightly loftier crest the edge of a"
109,I,"hamlet. It, too, is cloud-wreathed--the lonely crag of Mola. Over these"
110,I,"hilltops, I know, mists will drift and touch all day; and often they"
111,I,"darken threateningly, and creep softly down the slopes, and fill the"
112,I,"next-lying valley, and roll, and lift again, and reveal the flank of"
113,I,Monte d'Oro northward on the far-reaching range. As I was walking the
114,I,"other day, with one of these floating showers gently blowing in my face"
115,I,"down this defile, I noticed, where the mists hung in fragments from the"
116,I,"cloud out over the gulf, how like air-shattered arches they groined the"
117,I,profound ravine; and thinking how much of the romantic charm which
118,I,delights lovers of the mountains and the sea springs from such Gothic
119,I,"moods of nature, I felt for a moment something of the pleasure of"
120,I,recognition in meeting with this northern and familiar element in the
121,I,Sicilian landscape.
122,I,
123,I,One who has grown to be at home with nature cannot be quite a stranger
124,I,anywhere on earth. In new lands I find the poet's old domain. It is not
125,I,only from the land-side that these intimations of old acquaintance come.
126,I,"When my eyes leave, as they will, the near girdle of rainy mountain"
127,I,"tops, and range home at last upon the sea, something familiar is there"
128,I,"too,--that which I have always known,--but marvellously transformed and"
129,I,heightened in beauty and power. Such sudden glints of sunshine in the
130,I,"offing through unseen rents of heaven, as brilliant as in mid-ocean, I"
131,I,"have beheld a thousand times, but here they remind me rather of"
132,I,cloud-lights on far western plains; and where have I seen those still
133,I,"tracts of changeful colour, iridescent under the silvery vapours of"
134,I,"noon; or, when the weather freshens darkens, those whirlpools of pure"
135,I,emerald in the gray expanse of storm? They seem like memories of what
136,I,"has been, made fairer. One recurring scene has the same fascination for"
137,I,my eyes as the fishers' lights. It is a simple picture: only an arm of
138,I,"mist thrusting out from yonder lowland by the little cape, and making a"
139,I,"near horizon, where, for half an hour, the waves break with great dashes"
140,I,"of purple and green, deep and angry, against the insubstantial mole. All"
141,I,day I gaze on these sights of beauty until it seems that nature herself
142,I,has taken on nobler forms forever more. When the mountain storm beats
143,I,"the pane at midnight, or the distant lightnings awake me in the hour"
144,I,"before dawn, I can forget in what climate I am; but the oblivion is"
145,I,"conscious, and half a memory of childhood nights: in an instant comes"
146,I,"the recollection, ""I am on the coasts, and these are the couriers, of"
147,I,"Etna."""
148,I,
149,I,The very rain is strange: it is charged with obscure personality; it is
150,I,"the habitation of a new presence, a storm-genius that I have never"
151,I,"known; it in born of Etna, whence all things here have being and draw"
152,I,"nourishment. It is not rain, but the rain-cloud, spread out over the"
153,I,"valleys, the precipices, the sounding beaches, the ocean plain; it is"
154,I,"not a storm, but a season. It does not rise with the moist Hyades, or"
155,I,ride with cloudy Orion in the Mediterranean night; it does not pass like
156,I,Atlantic tempests on great world-currents: it remains. Its home is upon
157,I,"Etna; thence it comes and thither it returns; it gathers and disperses,"
158,I,"lightens and darkens, blows and is silent, and though it suffer the"
159,I,"clear north wind, or the west, to divide its veils with heaven, again it"
160,I,"draws the folds together about its abode. It obeys only Etna, who sends"
161,I,it forth; then with clouds and thick darkness the mountain hides its
162,I,face: it is the Sicilian winter.
163,I,
164,I,
165,II,II
166,II,
167,II,But Etna does not withdraw continuously from its children even in this
168,II,"season. On the third day, at farthest, I was told it would bring back"
169,II,the sun; and I was not deceived. Two days it was closely wrapped in
170,II,"impenetrable gray; but the third morning, as I threw open my casement"
171,II,"and stepped out upon the terrace, I saw it, like my native winter,"
172,II,expanding its broad flanks under the double radiance of dazzling clouds
173,II,"spreading from its extreme summit far out and upward, and of the"
174,II,snow-fields whose long fair drifts shone far down the sides. Villages
175,II,"and groves were visible, clothing all the lower zone, and between lay"
176,II,"the plain. It seemed near in that air, but it is twelve miles away."
177,II,From the sea-dipping base to the white cone the slope measures more than
178,II,"twenty miles, and as many more conduct the eye downward to the western"
179,II,fringe--a vast bulk; yet one does not think of its size as he gazes; so
180,II,"large a tract the eye takes in, but no more realizes than it does the"
181,II,"distance of the stars. High up, forests peer through the ribbed snows,"
182,II,and extinct craters stud the frozen scene with round hollow mounds
183,II,"innumerable. A thousand features, but it remains one mighty mountain."
184,II,How natural it seems for it to be sublime! It is the peer of the sea and
185,II,"of the sky. All day it flashed and darkened under the rack, and I"
186,II,"rejoiced in the sight, and knew why Pindar called it the pillar of"
187,II,heaven; and at night it hooded itself once more with the winter cloud.
188,II,
189,II,
190,III,III
191,III,
192,III,"Would you see this land as I see it? Come then, since Etna gives a fair,"
193,III,"pure morning, up over the shelving bank to the great eastern spur of"
194,III,"Taormina, where stood the hollow theatre, now in ruins, and above it the"
195,III,small temple with which the Greeks surmounted the highest point. It is
196,III,such a spot as they often chose for their temples; but none ever
197,III,"commanded a more noble prospect. The far-shining sea, four or five"
198,III,"hundred feet below, washes the narrow, precipitous descent, and on each"
199,III,hand is disclosed the whole of that side of Sicily which faces the
200,III,"rising sun. To the left and northward are the level straits, with the"
201,III,"Calabrian mountains opposite, thinly sown with light snow, as far as the"
202,III,"Cape of Spartivento, distinctly seen, though forty miles away; in front"
203,III,"expands the open sea; straight to the south runs the indented coast, bay"
204,III,"and beach, point after point, to where, sixty miles distant, the great"
205,III,blue promontory of Syracuse makes far out. On the land-side Etna fills
206,III,"the south with its lifted snow-fields, now smoke-plumed at the languid"
207,III,"cone; and thence, though lingeringly, the eye ranges nearer over the"
208,III,"intervening plain to the well-wooded ridge of Castiglione, and, next, to"
209,III,"the round solitary top of Monte Maestra, with its long shoreward"
210,III,"descent, and comes to rest on the height of Taormina overhead, with its"
211,III,"hermitage of Santa Maria della Rocca, its castle, and Mola. Yet further"
212,III,"off, at the hand of the defile, looms the barren summit of Monte"
213,III,"Venere, with Monte d'Oro and other hills in the foreground, and"
214,III,"northward, peak after peak, travels the close Messina range."
215,III,
216,III,"A landscape of sky, sea, plain, and mountains, great masses majestically"
217,III,"grouped, grand in contour! Yet to call it sublime does not render the"
218,III,"impression it makes upon the soul. Sublime, indeed, it is at times, and"
219,III,dull were he whose heart from hour to hour awe does not visit here; but
220,III,"constantly the scene is beautiful, and yields that delight which dwells"
221,III,unwearied with the soul. One may be seldom touched to the exaltation
222,III,"which sublimity implies, but to take pleasure in loveliness is the habit"
223,III,of one who lives as heaven made him; and what characterizes this
224,III,"landscape and sets it apart is the permanence of its beauty, its"
225,III,"perpetual and perfect charm through every change of light and weather,"
226,III,"and in every quarter of its heaven and earth, felt equally whether the"
227,III,"eye sweeps the great circuit with its vision, or pauses on the nearer"
228,III,"features, for they, too, are wonderfully composed. This hill of my"
229,III,"station falls down for half a mile with broken declivities, and then"
230,III,"becomes the Cape of Taormina, and takes its steep plunge into the sea."
231,III,"Yonder picturesque peninsula to its left, diminished by distance and"
232,III,"strongly relieved on the purple waves, is the Cape of Sant' Andrea, and"
233,III,beside it a cluster of small islands lies nearer inshore. On the other
234,III,"side, to the right of our own cape, shines our port, with Giardini, the"
235,III,"village of my fishers' lights, the beach with its boats, and the white"
236,III,main road winding in the narrow level between the bluffs and the sands.
237,III,"The port is guarded on the south by the peninsula of Schiso, where"
238,III,"ancient Naxos stood; and just beyond, the river Alcantara cuts the plain"
239,III,"and flows to the sea. At the other extremity, northward of Sant' Andrea,"
240,III,"is the cove of Letojanni, with its village, and then, perhaps eight"
241,III,"miles away, the bold headland of Sant' Alessio closes the shore view"
242,III,with a mass of rock that in former times completely shut off the land
243,III,"approach hither, there being no passage over it, and none around it"
244,III,"except by the strip of sand when the sea was quiet. All this ground,"
245,III,"with in several villages, from Sant' Alessio to the Alcantara, and"
246,III,"beyond into the plain, was anciently the territory of Taormina."
247,III,
248,III,"The little city itself lies on its hill, between the bright shore and"
249,III,"the gray old castle, on a crescent-like terrace whose two horns jut out"
250,III,"into the air like capes. The northern one of these is my station, the"
251,III,site of the old temple and the amphitheatre; the southern one opposite
252,III,"shows the facade of the Dominican convent; and the town circles between,"
253,III,possibly a mile from spur to spur. Here and there long broken lines of
254,III,"the ancient wall, black with age, stride the hillside. A round Gothic"
255,III,"tower, built as if for warfare, a square belfry, a ruined gateway, stand"
256,III,out among the humble roofs. Gardens of orange and lemon trees gleam like
257,III,"oblong parks, principally on the upper edge toward the great rock. If"
258,III,"you will climb, as I have done, the craggy plateau close by, which"
259,III,overhangs the theatre and obstructs the view of the extreme end of the
260,III,"town at this point, you will see from its level face, rough with the"
261,III,"plants of the prickly-pear, a cross on an eminence just below, and the"
262,III,gate toward Messina.
263,III,
264,III,"The face of the country is bare. Here beneath, where the main ravine of"
265,III,"Taormina cuts into the earth between the two spurs of the city, are"
266,III,"terraces of fruit trees and vegetables, and, wherever the naked rock"
267,III,"permits, similar terraces are seen on the castle hill and every less"
268,III,"steep slope, looking as if they would slide off. Almond and olive trees"
269,III,"cling and climb all over the hillsides, but their boughs do not clothe"
270,III,"the country. It is gray to look at, because of the masses of natural"
271,III,"rock everywhere cropping out, and also from the substructure of the"
272,III,"terraces, which, seen from below, present banks of the same gray stone."
273,III,"The only colour is given by the fan-like plants of the prickly-pear,"
274,III,"whose flat, thick-lipped, pear-shaped leaves, stuck with thorns, and"
275,III,"often extruding their reddish fruit from the edge, lend a dull green to"
276,III,"the scene. This plant grows everywhere, like wild bush, to a man's"
277,III,"height, covering the otherwise infertile soil, and the goats crop it. A"
278,III,"closer view shows patches of wild candytuft and marigolds, like those at"
279,III,"my feet, and humble purple and blue blossoms hang from crannies or run"
280,III,over the stony turf; but these are not strong enough to be felt in the
281,III,"prevalent tones. The blue of ocean, the white of Etna, the gray of"
282,III,Taormina--this is the scene.
283,III,
284,III,Three ways connect the town with the lower world. The modern carriage
285,III,"road runs from the Messina gate, and, quickly dropping behind the"
286,III,"northern spur, winds in great serpentine loops between the Campo Santo"
287,III,"below and old wayside tombs, Roman and Arabic, above, until it slowly"
288,III,"opens on the southern outlook, and, after two miles of tortuous courses"
289,III,"above the lovely coves, comes out on the main road along the coast. The"
290,III,"second way starts from the other end of the town, the gate toward Etna,"
291,III,and goes down more precipitously along the outer flank of the southern
292,III,"spur, with Mola (here shifted to the other side of the castle hill)"
293,III,closing the deep ravine behind; and at last it empties into the torrent
294,III,"of Selina, in whose bed it goes on to Giardini. The third, or short way,"
295,III,"leaps down the great hollow of the spurs, and yet keeps to a ridge"
296,III,"between the folds of the ravine which it discloses on each side, with"
297,III,"here and there a contadino cutting rock on the steep hillsides, or a"
298,III,"sportsman wandering with his dog; or often at twilight, from some coign"
299,III,"of vantage, you may see the goats trooping home across the distant sands"
300,III,by the sea. It debouches through great limestone quarries on the main
301,III,"road. There, seen from below, Taormina comes out--a cape, a town, and a"
302,III,"hill. It is, in fact, a long, steep, broken ridge, shaped like a wedge;"
303,III,"one end of the broad lace dips into the sea, the other, high on land,"
304,III,"exposes swelling bluffs; its back bears the town, its point lifts the"
305,III,castle.
306,III,
307,III,"This is the Taorminian land. What a quietude hangs over it! How poor,"
308,III,"how mean, how decayed the little town now looks amid all this silent"
309,III,beauty of enduring nature! It could not have been always so. This
310,III,"theatre at my feet, hewn in the living rock, flanked at each end by"
311,III,"great piers of massive Roman masonry, and showing broken columns thick"
312,III,"strewn in the midst of the broad orchestra, tells of ancient splendour"
313,III,"and populousness. The narrow stage still stands, with nine columns in"
314,III,"position in two groups; part are shattered half-way up, part are yet"
315,III,"whole, and in the gap between the groups shines the lovely sea with the"
316,III,"long southern coast, set in the beauty of these ruins as in a frame."
317,III,"Here Attic tragedies were once played, and Roman gladiators fought. The"
318,III,"enclosure is large, much over a hundred yards in diameter. It held many"
319,III,thousands. Whence came the people to fill it? I noticed by the
320,III,"roadside, as I came up, Saracenic tombs. I saw in the first square I"
321,III,"entered those small Norman windows, with the lovely pillars and the"
322,III,round arch. On the ancient church I have observed the ornamentation and
323,III,"mouldings of Byzantine art. The Virgin with her crown, over the"
324,III,"fountain, was paltry enough, but I saw that this was originally a"
325,III,"mermaid's statue. A water-clock here, a bath there; in all quarters I"
326,III,"come on some slight, poor relics of other ages; and always in the faces"
327,III,"of the people, where every race seems to have set its seal, I see the"
328,III,ruins of time. These echoes are not all of far-off things. That lookout
329,III,"below was a station of English cannon, I am told; and the bluff over"
330,III,"Giardini, beyond the torrent, takes its name from the French tents"
331,III,"pitched there long ago. The old walls can be traced for five miles, but"
332,III,"now the circuit is barely two. I wonder, as I go down to my room in the"
333,III,"Casa Timeo, what was the past of this silent town, now so shrunken from"
334,III,"its ancient limits; and who, I ask myself, Timeo?"
335,III,
336,IV,IV
337,IV,
338,IV,I thought when I first saw the inaccessibility of this mountain-keep
339,IV,that I should have no walks except upon the carriage road; but I find
340,IV,"there are paths innumerable. Leap the low walls where I will, I come on"
341,IV,unsuspected ways broad enough for man and beast. They ran down the
342,IV,"hillsides in all directions, and are ever dividing as they descend, like"
343,IV,"the branching streams of a waterfall. Some are rudely paved, and hemmed"
344,IV,"by low walls; others are mere footways on the natural rock and earth,"
345,IV,"often edging precipices, and opening short cross-cuts in the most"
346,IV,"unexpected places, not without a suggestion of peril, to make eye and"
347,IV,"foot alert, and to infuse a certain wild pleasure into the exercise. The"
348,IV,"multiplicity of these paths is a great boon to the lover of beauty, for"
349,IV,here one charm of Italian landscape exists in perfection. Every few
350,IV,"moments the scene rearranges itself in new combinations, as on the"
351,IV,"Riviera or at Amalfi, and makes an endless succession of lovely"
352,IV,pictures. The infinite variety of these views is not to be imagined
353,IV,unless it has been witnessed; and besides the magic wrought by mere
354,IV,"change of position, there is also a constant transformation of tone and"
355,IV,"colour from hour to hour, as the lights and shadows vary, and from day"
356,IV,"to day, with the unsettled weather."
357,IV,
358,IV,Yet who could convey to black-and-white speech the sense of beauty which
359,IV,is the better part of my rambles? It is only to say that here I went up
360,IV,"and down on the open hillsides, and there I followed the ridges or kept"
361,IV,the cliff-line above the fair coves; that now I dropped down into the
362,IV,"vales, under the shade of olive and lemon branches, and wound by the"
363,IV,gushing streams through the orchards. In every excursion I make some
364,IV,"discovery, and bring home some golden store for memory. Yesterday I"
365,IV,"found the olive slopes over Letojanni--beautiful old gnarled trees, such"
366,IV,as I have never seen except where the nightingales sing by the eastern
367,IV,shore of Spezzia. I did not doubt when I was told that those orchards
368,IV,"yield the sweetest oil in the world. It was the lemon harvest, and"
369,IV,everywhere were piles of the pale yellow fruit heaped like apples under
370,IV,"the slender trees, with a gatherer here and there; for this is always a"
371,IV,landscape of solitary figures. To-day I found the little beach of San
372,IV,"Nicolo, not far from the same place. I kept inland, going down the"
373,IV,"hollow by the Campo Santo, where there is a cool, gravelly stream in a"
374,IV,"dell that is like a nook in the Berkshire hills, and then along the"
375,IV,"upland on the skirts of Monte d'Oro, till by a sharp turn seaward I came"
376,IV,out through a marble quarry where men were working with what seemed slow
377,IV,implements on the gray or party-coloured stone. I passed through the
378,IV,"rather silent group, who stopped to look at me, and a short distance"
379,IV,"beyond I crossed the main road, and went down by a stream to the shore."
380,IV,"I found it strewn with seaside rock, as a hundred other beaches are, but"
381,IV,"none with rocks like these. They were marble, red or green, or shot with"
382,IV,"variegated hues, with many a soft gray, mottled or wavy-lined; and the"
383,IV,"sea had polished them. Very lovely they were, and shone where the low"
384,IV,wave gleamed over them. I had wondered at the profusion of marbles in
385,IV,"the Italian churches, but I had not thought to find them wild on a"
386,IV,lonely Sicilian beach. Once or twice already I had seen a block rosy in
387,IV,"the torrent-beds, and it had seemed a rare sight; but here the whole"
388,IV,shore was piled and inlaid with the beautiful stone.
389,IV,
390,IV,I have learned now that Taormina is famous for these marbles. Over
391,IV,"thirty varieties were sent to the Vienna Exhibition, and they won the"
392,IV,"prize. I got this information from the keeper of the Communal Library,"
393,IV,with whom I have made friends. He recalls to my memory the ship that
394,IV,"Hieron of Syracuse gave to Ptolemy, wonderful for its size. It had"
395,IV,"twenty banks of rowers, three decks, and space to hold a library, a"
396,IV,"gymnasium, gardens with trees in them, stables, and baths, and towers"
397,IV,"for assault, and it was provided by Archimedes with many ingenious"
398,IV,mechanical devices. The wood of sixty ordinary galleys was required for
399,IV,"its construction. I describe it because its architect, Filea, was a"
400,IV,"Taorminian by birth, and esteemed in his day second only to Archimedes"
401,IV,in his skill in mechanics; and in lining the baths of this huge galley
402,IV,he used these beautiful Taorminian marbles. My friend the librarian told
403,IV,"me also, with his Sicilian burr, of the wine of Taormina, the Eugenaean,"
404,IV,"which was praised by Pliny, and used at the sacred feasts of Rome; but"
405,IV,"now, he said sadly, the grape had lost its flavour."
406,IV,
407,IV,"The sugar-cane, which nourished in later times, is also gone. But the"
408,IV,"mullet that is celebrated in Juvenal's verse, and the lampreys that once"
409,IV,"went to better Alexandrian luxury, are still the spoil of the fishers,"
410,IV,"the shrimps are delicate to the palate, and the marbles will endure as"
411,IV,"long as this rock itself. The rock lasts, and the sea. The most ancient"
412,IV,"memory here is of them, for this is the shore of Charybdis. It is stated"
413,IV,"in Sallust and other Latin authors, as well as by writers throughout the"
414,IV,"Middle Ages, that all which was swallowed up in the whirlpool of the"
415,IV,"straits, after being carried beneath the sea for miles, was finally cast"
416,IV,up on the beach beneath the hill of Taormina.
417,IV,
418,IV,The rock and the sea were finely blended in one of my first discoveries
419,IV,"in the land, and in consequence they have seemed, to my imagination,"
420,IV,more closely united here than is common. On a stormy afternoon I had
421,IV,"strolled down the main road, and was walking toward Letojanni. I came,"
422,IV,"after a little, to a great cliff that overhung the sea, with room for"
423,IV,"the road to pass beneath; and as I drew near I heard a strange sound, a"
424,IV,"low roaring, a deep-toned reverberation, that seemed not to come from"
425,IV,"the breaking waves, loud on the beach: it was a more solemn, a more"
426,IV,piercing and continuous sound. It was from the rock itself. The grand
427,IV,"music of the rolling sea beneath was taken up by the hollowed cliff, and"
428,IV,reechoed with a mighty volume of sound from invisible sources. It seemed
429,IV,"the voice of the rock, as if by long sympathy and neighbourhood in that"
430,IV,"lonely place the cliff were interpenetrated with the sea-music, and had"
431,IV,become resonant of itself with those living harmonies heard only in the
432,IV,Psalmist's song. It seemed a lyre for the centuries; and I thought over
433,IV,"how many a conqueror, how many a race, that requiem had been lifted upon"
434,IV,it as they passed to their death on this shore. I came back slowly in
435,IV,"the twilight, and was roused from my reverie by the cold wind breathing"
436,IV,"on me as I reached the top of the hill, pure and keen and frosted like"
437,IV,the bright December breezes of my own land. It was the kiss of Etna on
438,IV,my cheek.
439,IV,
440,IV,
441,V,V
442,V,
443,V,Will you hear the legend of Taormina?--for in these days I dare not call
444,V,"it history. Noble and romantic it is, and age-long. I had not hoped to"
445,V,recover it; but my friend the librarian has brought me books in which
446,V,patriotic Taorminians have written the story celebrating their dear
447,V,city. I was touched by the simplicity with which he informed me that the
448,V,town authorities had been unwilling to waste on a passing stranger these
449,V,"little paper-bound memorials of their city. ""But,"" he said, ""I told them"
450,V,"I had given you my word."" So I possess these books with a pleasant"
451,V,"association of Sicilian honour, and I have read them with real interest."
452,V,As I turned the pages I was reminded once more how impossible it is to
453,V,"know the past. The past survives in human institutions, in the"
454,V,"temperament of races, and in the creations of ideal art; but only in the"
455,V,last is it immortal. Custom and law are for an age: race after race is
456,V,"pushed to the sea, and dies; only epic and saga and psalm have one date"
457,V,"with man, one destiny with the breath of his lips, one silence at the"
458,V,last with them. Least of all does the past survive in the living
459,V,"memories of men. Here and there the earth cherishes a coin or a statue,"
460,V,"the desert embalms some solitary city, a few leagues of rainless air"
461,V,preserve on rock and column the lost speech of Nile; so the mind of man
462,V,"holds in dark places, or lifts to living fame, no more than ruins and"
463,V,fragments of the life that was. I have been a diligent reader of books
464,V,in my time; and here in an obscure corner of the Old-World I find a
465,V,"narrative studded with noble names, not undistinguished by stirring"
466,V,"deeds, and, save for the great movements of history and a few shadowy"
467,V,"figures, it is all fresh to my mind. I have looked on three thousand"
468,V,"years of human life upon this hill; something of what they have yielded,"
469,V,"if you will have patience with such a tract of time, I will set down."
470,V,
471,V,"My author is Monsignore Giovanni di Giovanni, a Taorminian, who"
472,V,"flourished in the last century. He was a man of vast erudition, and"
473,V,there is in his pages the Old-World learning which delights me. He was
474,V,born before the days of historic doubt. He tells a true story. To allege
475,V,"an authority is with him to prove a fact, and to cite all writers who"
476,V,repeat the original source is to render truth impregnable. Rarely does
477,V,he show any symptom of the modern malady of incredulity. _Scripta
478,V,"littera_ is reason enough, unless the fair fame of his city chances to"
479,V,"be at stake. He was really learned, and I do wrong to seem to diminish"
480,V,"his authority. He was a patient investigator of manuscripts, and did"
481,V,important service to Sicilian history. The simplicity I have alluded to
482,V,affects mainly the ecclesiastical part of his narrative. A few
483,V,statements also in regard to the prehistoric period might disturb the
484,V,"modern mind, but I own to finding in them the charm of lost things. In"
485,V,"my mental provinces I welcome the cave-man, the flint-maker, the"
486,V,"lake-dweller, and all their primitive tribes to the abode of science;"
487,V,but I feel them to be intruders in my antiquity. I was brought up on
488,V,"quite other chronologies, and I still like a history that begins with"
489,V,"the flood. I will not, however, ask any one of more serious mind to go"
490,V,"back with Monsignore and myself to the era of autochthonous Sicily, when"
491,V,"the children of the Cyclops inhabited the land, and Demeter in her"
492,V,"search for Proserpina wept on this hill, and Charybdis lay stretched out"
493,V,under these bluffs watching the sea. It is precise enough to say that
494,V,"Taormina began eighty years before the Trojan War. Very dimly, it must"
495,V,"be acknowledged, the ancient Sicani are seen arriving and driven, like"
496,V,"all doomed races, south and west out of the land, and in their place the"
497,V,"Siculi flourish, and a Samnite colony voyages over the straits from"
498,V,Italy and joins them. Here for three centuries these sparse communities
499,V,"lived along these heights in fear of the sea pirates, and warred"
500,V,"confusedly from their mainhold on Mount Taurus, or the Bull, so called"
501,V,because the two summits of the mountain from a distance resemble a
502,V,bull's horns; and they left no other memory of themselves.
503,V,
504,V,Authentic history begins toward the end of the eighth century before our
505,V,"era. It is a bright burst; for then, down by yonder green-foaming rock,"
506,V,the young Greek mariners leaped on the strand. This was their first
507,V,"land-fall in Sicily; that rock, their Plymouth; and here, doubtless, the"
508,V,alarmed mountaineers stood in their fastness and watched the bearers of
509,V,"the world's torch, and knew them not, bringing daybreak to the dark"
510,V,"island for evermore, but fought, as barbarism will, against the light,"
511,V,and were at last made friends with it--a chance that does not always
512,V,"befall. Then quickly rose the lowland city of Naxos, and by the river"
513,V,"sprang up the temple to Guiding Apollo, the earliest shrine of the"
514,V,"Sicilian Greeks, where they came ever afterward to pray for a prosperous"
515,V,"voyage when they would go across the sea, homeward. They were from the"
516,V,first a fighting race; and decade by decade the cloud of war grew
517,V,"heavier on each horizon, southward from Syracuse and northward from"
518,V,"Messina, and swords beat fiercer and stronger with the rivalries of"
519,V,growing states--battles dimly discerned now. A single glimpse flashes
520,V,out on the page of Thucydides. He relates that when once the Messenians
521,V,"threatened Naxos with overthrow, the mountaineers rushed down from the"
522,V,"heights in great numbers to the relief of their Greek neighbours, and"
523,V,"routed the enemy and slew many. This is the first bloodstain, clear and"
524,V,"bright, on our Taorminian land. Shall I add, from the few relics of that"
525,V,"age, that Pythagoras, on the journey he undertook to establish the"
526,V,"governments of the Sicilian cities, wrought miracles here, curing a mad"
527,V,"lover of his frenzy by music, and being present on this hill and at"
528,V,Metaponto the same day--a thing not to be done without magic? But at
529,V,"last we see plainly Alcibiades coasting along below, and the ill-fated"
530,V,"Athenians wintering in the port, and horsemen going out from Naxos"
531,V,toward Etna on the side of Athens in the death-struggle of her glory.
532,V,"And then, suddenly, after the second three hundred years, all is over,"
533,V,"the Greek city betrayed, sacked, destroyed, Naxos trodden out under the"
534,V,foot of Dionysius the tyrant.
535,V,
536,V,"Other fortune awaited him a few years later when he came again, and our"
537,V,"city (which, one knows not when, had been walled and fortified) stood"
538,V,its first historic siege. Dionysius arrived in the dead of winter. Snow
539,V,"and ice--I can hardly credit it--whitened and roughened these ravines, a"
540,V,new ally to the besieged; but the tyrant thought to betray them by a
541,V,"false security in such a season. On a bitter night, when clouds hooded"
542,V,"the hilltop, and mists rolled low about its flanks, he climbed"
543,V,"unobserved, with his forces, up these precipices, and gained two outer"
544,V,forts which gave footways to the walls; but the town roused at the sound
545,V,"of arms and the cries of the guards, and came down to the fray, and"
546,V,"fought until six hundred of the foe fell dead, others with wounds"
547,V,"surrendered, and the rest fled headlong, with Dionysius among them, hard"
548,V,"pressed, and staining the snow with his blood as he went. This was the"
549,V,city's first triumph.
550,V,
551,V,"Not only with brave deeds did Taormina begin, but, as a city should,"
552,V,"with a great man. He was really great, this Andromachus. Do you not"
553,V,"remember him out of Plutarch, and the noble words that have been his"
554,V,"immortal memory among men? ""This man was incomparably the best of all"
555,V,"those that bore sway in Sicily at that time, governing his citizens"
556,V,"according to law and justice, and openly professing an aversion and"
557,V,"enmity to all tyrants."" Was the defeat of Dionysius the first of his"
558,V,"youthful exploits, as some say? I cannot determine; but it is certain"
559,V,"that he gathered the surviving exiles of Naxos, and gave them this"
560,V,"plateau to dwell upon, and it was no longer called Mount Taurus, as had"
561,V,"been the wont, but Tauromenium, or the Abiding-place of the Bull. A few"
562,V,years later Andromachus performed the signal action of his life by
563,V,"befriending Timoleon, as great a character, in my eyes, as Plutarch"
564,V,"records the glory of. Timoleon had set out from Corinth, at the summons"
565,V,"of his Greek countrymen, to restore the liberty of Syracuse, then"
566,V,"tyrannized over by the second Dionysius; and because Andromachus, in his"
567,V,"stronghold of Taormina, hated tyranny, Plutarch says, he ""gave Timoleon"
568,V,leave to muster up his troops there and to make that city the seat of
569,V,"war, persuading the inhabitants to join their arms with the Corinthian"
570,V,"forces and to assist them in the design of delivering Sicily."" It was on"
571,V,"our beach that Timoleon disembarked, and from our city he went forth to"
572,V,"the conquest foretold, by the wreath that fell upon his head as he"
573,V,"prayed at Delphi, and by the prophetic fire that piloted his ship over"
574,V,"the sea. The Carthaginians came quickly after him from Reggio, where he"
575,V,"had eluded them, for they were in alliance with the tyrant; and from"
576,V,their vessels they parleyed with Andromachus in the port. With an
577,V,"insolent gesture, the envoy, raising his hand, palm up, and turning it"
578,V,"lightly over, said that even so, and with such ease, would he overturn"
579,V,"the little city; and Andromachus, mocking his hand-play, answered that"
580,V,"if he did not leave the harbour, even so would he upset his galley. The"
581,V,Carthaginians sailed away. The city remained firm-perched. Timoleon
582,V,"prospered, brought back liberty to Syracuse, ruled wisely and nobly, and"
583,V,gave to Sicily those twenty years of peace which were the flower of her
584,V,"Greek annals. Then, we must believe, rose the little temple on our"
585,V,"headland, the Greek theatre where the tongue of Athens lived, the"
586,V,gymnasium where the youths grew fair and strong. Then Taormina struck
587,V,"her coins: Apollo with the laurel, with the lyre, with the grape;"
588,V,"Dionysus with the ivy, and Zeus with the olive; for the gods and temples"
589,V,"of the Naxians had become ours, and were religiously cherished; and with"
590,V,"the rest was struck a coin with the Minotaur, our symbol. But of"
591,V,"Andromachus, the founder of the well-built and fairly adorned Greek city"
592,V,"that then rose, we hear no more--a hero, I think, one of the true breed"
593,V,"of the founders of states. But alas for liberty! A new tyrant,"
594,V,"Agathocles, was soon on the Syracusan throne, and he won this city by"
595,V,"friendly professions, only to empty it by treachery and murder; and he"
596,V,"drove into exile Timaeus, the son of Andromachus. Timaeus? He,"
597,V,"evidently, of my Casa Timeo. I know him now, the once famed historian"
598,V,whom Cicero praises as the most erudite in history of all writers up to
599,V,"his time, most copious in facts and various in comment, not unpolished"
600,V,"in style, eloquent, and distinguished by terse and charming expression."
601,V,"Ninety years he lived in the Greek world, devoted himself to history,"
602,V,"and produced many works, now lost. The ancient writers read him, and"
603,V,from their criticism it is clear that he was marked by a talent for
604,V,"invective, was given to sharp censure, and loved the bitter part of"
605,V,"truth. He introduced precision and detail into his art, and is credited"
606,V,with being the first to realize the importance of chronology and to seek
607,V,"exactness in it. He never saw again his lovely birthplace, and I easily"
608,V,forgive to the exile and the son of Andromachus the vigour with which he
609,V,depicted the crimes of Agathocles and others of the tyrants. In our
610,V,"city, meanwhile, the Greek genius waning to its extinction, Tyndarion"
611,V,ruled; and in his time Pyrrhus came hither to repulse the ever invading
612,V,power of Carthage. But he was little more than a shedder of blood; he
613,V,"accomplished nothing, and I name him only as one of the figures of our"
614,V,beach.
615,V,
616,V,The day of Greece was gone; but those two clouds of war still hung on
617,V,"the horizon, north and south, with ever darker tempest. Instead of"
618,V,"Syracuse and Messina, Carthage and the new name of Rome now sent them"
619,V,"forth, and over this island they encountered. Our city, true to its"
620,V,"ancient tradition, became Rome's ever faithful ally, as you may read in"
621,V,"the poem of Silius Italicus, and was dignified by treaty with the title"
622,V,of a confederate city; and of this fact Cicero reminded the judges when
623,V,"in that famous trial he thundered against Verres, the spoiler of our"
624,V,"Sicilian province, and with the other cities defended this of ours,"
625,V,whose people had signalized their hatred of the Roman praetor by
626,V,"overthrowing his statue in the market-place and sparing the pedestal, as"
627,V,"they said, to be an eternal memorial of his infamy. From the Roman age,"
628,V,"however, I take but two episodes, for I find that to write this town's"
629,V,history were to write the history of half the Mediterranean world. When
630,V,"the slaves rose in the Servile War, they intrenched themselves on this"
631,V,"hill, and in their hands the city bore its siege by the Roman consul as"
632,V,"hardily as was ever its custom. Cruel they were, no doubt, and"
633,V,vindictive. With horror Monsignore relates that they were so resolved
634,V,"not to yield that, starving, they ate their children, their wives, and"
635,V,one another; and he rejoices when they were at last betrayed and
636,V,"massacred, and this disgrace was wiped away. I hesitate. I cannot feel"
637,V,regret when those whom man has made brutal answer brutally to their
638,V,oppressors. I have enough of the old Taorminian spirit to remember that
639,V,"the slaves, too, fought for liberty. I am sorry for those penned and"
640,V,dying men; their famine and slaughter in these walls were least horrible
641,V,"for their part in the catastrophe, if one looks through what they did to"
642,V,"what they were, and remembers that the civilization they violated had"
643,V,"stripped them of humanity. After the slave, I make room--for whom else"
644,V,"than imperial Augustus? Off this shore he defeated Sextus Pompey, and he"
645,V,thought easily to subdue the town above when he summoned it. But Taormina
646,V,"was always a loyal little place, and it would not yield without a siege."
647,V,"Then Augustus, sitting down before it, prayed in our temple of Guiding"
648,V,Apollo that he might have the victory; and as he walked by the beach
649,V,"afterward a fish threw itself out of the water before him--an omen,"
650,V,"said the diviners, that even so the Pompeians, who held the seas, after"
651,V,"many turns of varied fortune, should be brought to his feet. Pompey"
652,V,"returned with a fleet, and in these waters again the battle was fought"
653,V,"and Augustus lost it, and the siege was raised. But when a third time"
654,V,"the trial of naval strength was essayed, and the cause of the Pompeians"
655,V,"ruined, Augustus remembered the city that had defied him, sent its"
656,V,"inhabitants into exile, and planted a Roman colony in its place. Latin"
657,V,was now the language here. The massive grandeur of Roman architecture
658,V,replaced the old Greek structures. The amphitheatre was enlarged and
659,V,"renewed in its present form, villas of luxury bordered the coasts as in"
660,V,"Campania, and coins were struck in the Augustan name."
661,V,
662,V,The Roman domination in its turn slowly moved to its fall; and where
663,V,should the new age begin more fitly than in this city of beginnings? As
664,V,"of old the Greek torch first gleamed here, here first on Sicilian soil"
665,V,was the Cross planted. The gods of Olympus had many temples about the
666,V,"hill slopes, shrines of venerable antiquity even in those days; but if"
667,V,"the monkish chronicles be credited, the new faith signalized its victory"
668,V,"rather over three strange idolatries,--the worship of Falcone, of"
669,V,"Lissone, and of Scamandro, a goddess. I refuse to believe that the"
670,V,citizens were accustomed to sacrifice three youths annually to Falcone;
671,V,"and as for the other two deities, little is known of them except that"
672,V,their destruction marked the advent of the young religion. Pancrazio was
673,V,the name of him who was destined to be our patron saint through the
674,V,"coming centuries. He was born in Antioch, and when a child of three"
675,V,"years, going with his father into Judea, he had seen the living Christ;"
676,V,"now, grown into manhood, he was sent by St. Peter to spread the gospel"
677,V,"in the isles of the sea. He disembarked on our beach, and forthwith"
678,V,"threw Lissone's image into the waves, and with it a holy dragon which"
679,V,was coiled about it like a garment and was fed with sacrifices; and he
680,V,shattered with his cross the great idol Scamandro: and so Taormina
681,V,"became Christian, welcomed St. Peter on his way to Rome, and entered on"
682,V,"the long new age. It was here, as elsewhere, the age of"
683,V,"martyrs--Pancrazio first, and after him Geminiano, guided hither with"
684,V,"his mother by an angel; and then San Nicone, who suffered with his one"
685,V,"hundred and ninety-nine brother monks, and Sepero and Corneliano with"
686,V,"their sixty; the age of monks--Luca, who fled from his bridal to live on"
687,V,"Etna, with fasts, visions, and prophecies; and, later, simple-minded"
688,V,"Daniele, the follower of St. Elia, of whom there is more to be recorded;"
689,V,"the age of bishops, heard in Roman councils and the palace of Byzantium,"
690,V,"of whom two only are of singular interest--Zaccaria, who was deprived,"
691,V,"evidently the ablest in mind and policy of all the succession, once a"
692,V,"great figure in the disputes of East and West; and Procopio, whom the"
693,V,"Saracens slew, for the Crescent now followed the Cross."
694,V,
695,V,The ancient war-cloud had again gathered out of Africa. The Saracens
696,V,"were in the land, and every city had fallen except Syracuse and"
697,V,"Taormina. For sixty years the former held out, and our city for yet"
698,V,"another thirty, the sole refuge of the Christians. Signs of the"
699,V,impending destruction were first seen by that St. Elia already
700,V,"mentioned, who wandered hither, and was displeased by the manners and"
701,V,morals of the citizens. I am sorry to record that Monsignore believed
702,V,"his report, for only here is there mention of such a matter. ""The"
703,V,"citizens,"" says my author, ""lived in luxury and pleasure not becoming to"
704,V,"a state of war. They saw on all sides the fields devastated, houses"
705,V,"burnt, wealth plundered, cities given to the flames, friends and"
706,V,"companions killed or reduced to slavery, yet was there no vice, no sin,"
707,V,"that did not rule unpunished among them."" Therefore the saint preached"
708,V,"the woe to come, and, turning to the governor, Constantine Patrizio, in"
709,V,"his place in the cathedral, he appealed to him to restrain his people."
710,V,"""Let the philosophy of the Gentiles,"" he exclaimed, ""be your shame."
711,V,"Epaminondas, that illustrious _condottiere_, strictly restrained himself"
712,V,"from intemperance, from every lust, every allurement of pleasure. So,"
713,V,"also, Scipio, the Roman leader, was valorous through the same continence"
714,V,"as Epaminondas; and therefore they brought back signal victory, one over"
715,V,"the Spartans, the other over the Carthaginians, and both erected"
716,V,"immortal trophies."" He promised them mercy with repentance, but ended"
717,V,"threateningly: ""So far as in me lies I have clearly foretold to you all"
718,V,"that has been divinely revealed to me. If you believe my words, like"
719,V,"the penitents of Nineveh, you shall find mercy; if you despise my"
720,V,"admonitions, bound and captive you shall be reduced to the worst"
721,V,"slavery."" He prophesied yet more in private. He went to the house of a"
722,V,"noble citizen, Crisione, who esteemed him as a father, and, lying in"
723,V,"bed, he said to him: ""Do you see, Crisione, the bed in which I now lie?"
724,V,"In this same bed shall Ibrahim sleep, hungry for human blood, and the"
725,V,walls of the rooms shall see many of the most distinguished persons of
726,V,"this city all together put to the edge of the sword."" Then he left the"
727,V,"house and went to the square in the centre of the city, and, standing"
728,V,"there, he lifted his garments above the knee. Whereupon simple Daniele,"
729,V,"who always followed him about, marvelling asked, ""What does this thing"
730,V,"mean, father?"" The old man had his answer ready, ""Now I see rivers of"
731,V,"blood running, and these proud and magnificent buildings which you see"
732,V,"exalted shall be destroyed even to the foundations by the Saracens."" And"
733,V,"the monk fled from the doomed city, like a true prophet, and went"
734,V,overseas.
735,V,
736,V,"The danger was near, but perhaps not more felt than it must always have"
737,V,been where the prayer for defence against the Saracens had gone up for a
738,V,"hundred years in the cathedral. The governor, however, had taken pains"
739,V,to add to the strength of the city by strong fortifications upon Mola.
740,V,"Ahulabras came under the walls, but gave over the ever unsuccessful"
741,V,"attempt to take the place, and went on to ruin Reggio beyond the"
742,V,"straits. When it was told to his father Ibrahim that Tabermina, as the"
743,V,"Saracens called it, had again been passed by, he cried out upon his son,"
744,V,"""He is degenerate, degenerate! He took his nature from his mother and"
745,V,"not from his father; for, had he been born from me, surely his sword"
746,V,"would not have spared the Christians!"" Therefore he recalled him to the"
747,V,"home government, and came himself and sat down before the city. The"
748,V,"garrison was small and insufficient, but, says my author, following old"
749,V,"chronicles, ""youths, old men, and children, without distinction of age,"
750,V,"sex, or condition, fearing outrage and all that slavery would expose"
751,V,"them to, all spontaneously offered themselves to fight in this holy war"
752,V,even to death: with such courage did love of country and religious zeal
753,V,"inspire the citizens."" Ibrahim had other weapons than the sword. He"
754,V,"first corrupted the captains of the Greek fleet, who were afterward"
755,V,"condemned for the treason at Byzantium. Then, all being ready, he"
756,V,"promised some Ethiopians of his army, who are described as of a"
757,V,"ferocious nature and harsh aspect, that he would give them the city for"
758,V,"booty, besides other gifts, if they would devote themselves to the bold"
759,V,undertaking. The catastrophe deserves to be told in Monsignore's own
760,V,words:
761,V,
762,V,"""This people, accustomed to rapine, allured by the riches of the"
763,V,"Taorminians and the promises of the king, with the aid of the traitors"
764,V,"entered unexpectedly into the city, and with bloody swords and mighty"
765,V,"cries and clamour assailed the citizens. Meanwhile King Ibrahim, having"
766,V,"entered with all his army by a secret gate under the fortress of Mola,"
767,V,"thence called the gate of the Saracens, raged against the citizens with"
768,V,such unexpected and cruel slaughter that not only neither the weakness
769,V,"of sex, nor tender years, nor reverence for hoary age, but not even the"
770,V,"abundance of blood that like torrents flowed down the ways, touched to"
771,V,"pity that ferocious heart. The soldiers, masters of the beautiful and"
772,V,"wealthy city, divided among them the riches and goods of the citizens"
773,V,according as to each one the lot fell; they levelled to the ground the
774,V,"magnificent buildings, public or private, sacred or profane, all that"
775,V,"were proudest for amplitude, construction, and ornament; and that not"
776,V,"even the ruins of ancient splendour should remain, all that had survived"
777,V,"they gave to the flames."""
778,V,
779,V,"This city, which the Saracens destroyed, is the one the Taorminians"
780,V,"cherish as the culmination of their past. In the Greek, the Roman, and"
781,V,"the early Christian ages it had flourished, as both its ruins and its"
782,V,"history attest, and much must have yet survived from those times; while"
783,V,its station as the only Christian stronghold in the island would
784,V,naturally have attracted wealth hither for safety. In this first sack of
785,V,"the Saracens, the ancient city must have perished, but the destruction"
786,V,"could hardly have been so thorough as is represented, since some of the"
787,V,"churches themselves, in their present state, show Byzantine workmanship."
788,V,
789,V,There remains one bloody and characteristic episode to Ibrahim's
790,V,"victory. The king, says the Arab chronicler, was pious and naturally"
791,V,"compassionate, but on this occasion he forgot his usual mildness. In the"
792,V,midst of fire and blood he ordered the soldiers to search the caverns of
793,V,"the hills, and they dragged forth many prisoners, among whom was the"
794,V,"Bishop Procopio. The king spoke to him gently and nobly, ""Because you"
795,V,"are wise and old, O Bishop, I exhort you with soft words to obey my"
796,V,"advice, and to have foresight for your own safety and that of your"
797,V,companions; otherwise you shall suffer what your fellow-citizens have
798,V,"suffered from me. If you will embrace my laws, and deny the Christian"
799,V,"religion, you shall have the second place after me, and shall be more"
800,V,"dear to me than all the Agarenes."" The prelate only smiled. Then, full"
801,V,"of wrath, the king said: ""Do you smile while you are my prisoner? Know"
802,V,"you not in whose presence you are?"" ""I smile truly,"" came the answer,"
803,V,"""because I see you are inspired by a demon who puts these words into"
804,V,"your mouth."" Furious, the king called to his attendants, ""Quick, break"
805,V,"open his breast, tear out his heart, that we may see and understand the"
806,V,"secrets of his mind."" While the command was being executed, Procopio"
807,V,"reproved the king and comforted his companions. ""The tyrant, swollen"
808,V,"with rage, and grinding his teeth,"" says the narrative, ""barbarously"
809,V,"offered him the torn-out heart that he might eat it."" Then he bade them"
810,V,"strike off the bishop's head (who, we are told, was already half dead),"
811,V,"and also the heads of his companions, and to burn the bodies all"
812,V,together. And as St. Pancrazio of old had thrown the holy dragon into
813,V,"the sea, so now were his own ashes scattered to the winds of heaven; and"
814,V,"Ibrahim, having accomplished his work, departed."
815,V,
816,V,"Some of the citizens, however, had survived, and among them Crisione,"
817,V,the host of St. Elia. He went to bear the tidings to the saint; and
818,V,"being now assured of the gift of prophecy possessed by the holy man,"
819,V,asked him to foretell his future. He met the customary fate of the
820,V,"curious in such things. ""I foresee,"" said the discomfortable saint,"
821,V,"""that within a few days you will die."" And to make an end of St. Elia"
822,V,"with Crisione, let me record here the simple Daniele's last act of piety"
823,V,"to his master. It is little that in such company he fought with devils,"
824,V,"or that after he had written with much labour a beautiful Psalter, the"
825,V,old monk bade him fling it and worldly pride together over the cliff
826,V,"into a lake. Such episodes belonged to the times; and, after all, by"
827,V,"making a circuit of six miles he found the Psalter miraculously unwet,"
828,V,and only his worldly pride remained at the lake's bottom. But it was a
829,V,mind singularly inventive of penance that led the dying saint to charge
830,V,poor Daniele to bear the corpse on his back a long way over the
831,V,"mountains, merely because, he said, it would be a difficult thing to do."
832,V,"Other survivors of the sack of Taormina, more fortunate than Crisione,"
833,V,"watched their opportunity, and, at a moment when the garrison was weak,"
834,V,"entered, seized the place, fortified it anew, and offered it to the"
835,V,"Greek emperor once more. He could not maintain war with the Saracens,"
836,V,but by a treaty made with them he secured his faithful Taorminians in
837,V,the possession of the city. After forty years of peace under this treaty
838,V,"it was again besieged for several months, and fell on Christmas night."
839,V,Seventeen hundred and fifty of its citizens were sent by the victors
840,V,"into slavery in Africa. Greek troops, however, soon retook the city in"
841,V,a campaign that opened brilliantly in Sicily only to close in swift
842,V,"disaster; but for five years longer Taormina sustained continual siege,"
843,V,"and when it fell at last, with the usual carnage of its citizens and the"
844,V,"now thrice-repeated fire and ruin of Saracenic victory, we may well"
845,V,"believe that, though it remained the seat of a governor, little of the"
846,V,city was left except its memory. Its name even was changed to Moezzia.
847,V,
848,V,"The Crescent ruled undisturbed for a hundred years, until the landing of"
849,V,"Count Roger, the Norman, the great hero of mediaeval Sicily, who"
850,V,"recovered the island to the Christian faith. Taormina, true to its"
851,V,"tradition, was long in falling; but after eighteen years of desultory"
852,V,warfare Count Roger sat down before it with determination. He surrounded
853,V,it with a circumvallation of twenty-two fortresses connected by ramparts
854,V,"and bridges, and cut off all access by land or sea. Each day he"
855,V,"inspected the lines; and the enemy, having noticed this habit, laid an"
856,V,ambush for him in some young myrtles where the path he followed had a
857,V,"very narrow passage over the precipices. They rushed out on him, and, as"
858,V,"he was unarmed and alone, would have killed him, had not their cries"
859,V,"attracted one Evandro, a Breton, who, coming, and seeing his chief's"
860,V,"peril, threw himself between, and died in his place. Count Roger was not"
861,V,"forgetful of this noble action. He recovered the body, held great"
862,V,"funeral services, and gave gifts to the soldiers and the church. The"
863,V,"story appealed so to the old chronicler Malaterra, that he told it in"
864,V,"both prose and verse. After seven months the city surrendered, and the"
865,V,iron cross was again set up on the rocky eminence by the gate. It is a
866,V,sign of the ruin which had befallen that the city now lost its bishopric
867,V,and was ecclesiastically annexed to another see.
868,V,
869,V,"Taormina, compared with what it had been, was now a place of the desert;"
870,V,but not the less for that did the tide of war rage round it for five
871,V,hundred years to come. It was like a rock of the sea over which
872,V,conflicting billows break eternally. I will not narrate the feudal story
873,V,"of internecine violence, nor how amidst it all every religious order set"
874,V,"up monasteries upon the beautiful hillsides, of whose life little is now"
875,V,left but the piles of books in old bindings over which my friend the
876,V,"librarian keeps guard, mourning the neglect in which they are left."
877,V,"Among both the nobles and the fathers were some examples of heroism,"
878,V,"sacrifice, and learning, but their deeds and virtues may sleep unwaked"
879,V,"by me. The kings and queens who took refuge here, and fled again,"
880,V,"Messenian foray and Chiaramontane faction, shall go unrecorded. I must"
881,V,"not, however, in the long roll of the famous figures of our beach forget"
882,V,that our English Richard the Lion-hearted was entertained here by
883,V,Tancred in crusading days; and of notable sieges let me name at least
884,V,that which the city suffered for its loyalty to the brave and generous
885,V,"Manfred when the Messenians surprised and wasted it, and that which with"
886,V,"less destruction the enemies of the second Frederick inflicted on it,"
887,V,"and that of the French under Charles II, who, contrary to his word, gave"
888,V,up the surrendered city to the soldiery for eight whole days--a terrible
889,V,"sack, of which Monsignore has heard old men tell. What part the citizens"
890,V,"took in the Sicilian Vespers, and how the Parliament that vainly sought"
891,V,"a king for all Sicily was held here, and in later times the marches of"
892,V,"the Germans, Spaniards, and English--these were too long a tale. With"
893,V,"one more signal memory I close this world-history, as it began, with a"
894,V,noble name. It was from our beach yonder that Garibaldi set out for
895,V,"Italy in the campaign of Aspromonte; hither he was brought back,"
896,V,"wounded, to the friendly people, still faithful to that love of liberty"
897,V,which flowed in the old Taorminian blood.
898,V,
899,V,I shut my books; but to my eyes the rock is scriptured now. What a leaf
900,V,it is from the world-history of man upon the planet! Every race has
901,V,splashed it with blood; every faith has cried from it to heaven. It is
902,V,only a hill-station in the realm of empire; but in the records of such a
903,V,"city, lying somewhat aside and out of common vision, the course of human"
904,V,fate may be more simply impressive than in the story of world-cities.
905,V,"Athens, Rome, Constantinople, London, Paris, are great centres of"
906,V,history; but in them the mind is confused by the multiplicity and awed
907,V,by the majesty of events. Here on this bare rock there is no thronging
908,V,"of illustrious names, and little of that glory that conceals imperial"
909,V,"crime, the massacre of armies, and the people's woe. Again I use the"
910,V,"figure: it is like a rock of the sea, set here in the midst of the"
911,V,"Mediterranean world, washed by all the tides of history, beat on by"
912,V,every pitiless storm of the passion of man for blood. The torch of
913,V,"Greece, the light of the Cross, the streaming portent of the Crescent,"
914,V,"have shone from it, each in its time; all governments, from Greek"
915,V,"democracy to Bourbon tyranny, have ruled it in turn; Roman law and"
916,V,"feudal custom had it in charge, each a long age: yet civilization in all"
917,V,"its historic forms has never here done more, seemingly, than alleviate"
918,V,at moments the hard human lot. And what has been the end? Go down into
919,V,the streets; go out into the villages; go into the country-side. The men
920,V,"will hardly look up from their burdens, the women will seldom stop to"
921,V,"ask alms, but you will see a degradation of the human form that speaks"
922,V,"not of the want of individuals, of one generation, or of an age, but of"
923,V,"the destitution of centuries stamped physically into the race. There is,"
924,V,"as always, a prosperous class, men well to do, the more fortunate and"
925,V,"better-born; but the common people lead toilsome lives, and among them"
926,V,"suffering is widespread. Three thousand years of human life, and this"
927,V,the result! Yet I see many indications of a brave patriotism in the
928,V,"community, an effort to improve general conditions, to arouse, to"
929,V,"stimulate, to encourage--the spirit of free and united Italy awakening"
930,V,"here, too, with faith in the new age of liberty and hope of its promised"
931,V,blessings. And for a sign there stands in the centre of the poor
932,V,fishing-village yonder a statue of Garibaldi.
933,V,
934,V,
935,VI,VI
936,VI,
937,VI,"The rain-cloud is gone. The days are bright, warm, and clear, and every"
938,VI,"hour tempts me forth to wander about the hills. It is not spring, but"
939,VI,the hesitancy that holds before the season changes; yet each day there
940,VI,"are new flowers--not our delicate wood flowers, but larger and coarser"
941,VI,"of fibre, and it adds a charm to them that I do not know their names."
942,VI,"The trees are budding, and here and there, like a wave breaking into"
943,VI,"foam on a windless sea, an almond has burst into blossom, white and"
944,VI,"solitary on the gray slopes, and over all the orchards there is the"
945,VI,"faint suggestion of pale pink, felt more than seen, so vague is it--but"
946,VI,"it is there. I go wandering by cliff or sea-shore, by rocky beds of"
947,VI,"running water, under dark-browed caverns, and on high crags; now on our"
948,VI,"cape, among the majestic rocks, I watch the swaying of the smooth"
949,VI,"deep-violet waters below, changing into indigo as they lap the rough"
950,VI,"clefts, or I loiter on the beach to see the fishers about their boats,"
951,VI,"weather-worn mariners, and youths in the fair strength of manly beauty,"
952,VI,like athletes of the old world: and always I bring back something for
953,VI,"memory, something unforeseen."
954,VI,
955,VI,I have ever found this uncertainty a rare pleasure of travel. It is
956,VI,blessed not to know what the gods will give. I remember once in other
957,VI,"days I left the beach of Amalfi to row away to the isles of the Sirens,"
958,VI,"farther down the coast. It was a beautiful, blowing, wave-wild morning,"
959,VI,"and I strained my sight, as every headland of the high cliff-coast was"
960,VI,"rounded, to catch the first glimpse of the low isles; and there came by"
961,VI,"a country boat-load of the peasants, and in the bows, as it neared and"
962,VI,"passed, I saw a dark, black-haired boy, bare breast, and dreaming eyes,"
963,VI,motionless save for the dipping prow--a figure out of old Italian
964,VI,"pictures, some young St. John, inexpressibly beautiful. I have"
965,VI,"forgotten how the isles of the Sirens looked, but that boy's face I"
966,VI,shall never forget. It is such moments that give the Italy of the
967,VI,"imagination its charm. Here, too, I have similar experiences. A day or"
968,VI,"two ago, when the bright weather began, I was threading the rough edge"
969,VI,"of a broken path under the hill, and clinging to the rock with my hand."
970,VI,"Suddenly a figure rose just before me, where the land made out a little"
971,VI,"farther on a point of the crag, so strange that I was startled; but"
972,VI,"straightway I knew the goatherd, the curling locks, the olive face, the"
973,VI,garments of goatskin and leather on his limbs. It came on me like a
974,VI,flash--_eccola_ the country of Theocritus!
975,VI,
976,VI,I have never seen it set down among the advantages of travel that one
977,VI,"learns to understand the poets better. To see courts and governments,"
978,VI,"manners and customs, works of architecture, statues and pictures and"
979,VI,"ruins--this, since modern travel began, is to make the grand tour; but"
980,VI,"though I have diligently sought such obvious and common aims, and had my"
981,VI,"reward, I think no gain so great as that I never thought of, the light"
982,VI,"which travel sheds upon the poets; unless, indeed, I should except that"
983,VI,stronger hold on the reality of the ideal creations of the imagination
984,VI,"which comes from familiar life with pictures, and statues, and kindred"
985,VI,physical renderings of art. This latter advantage must necessarily be
986,VI,"more narrowly availed of by men, since it implies a certain peculiar"
987,VI,"temperament; but poetry, in its less exalted forms, is open and common"
988,VI,"to all who are not immersed in the materialism of their own lives, and"
989,VI,whatever helps to unlock the poetic treasures of other lands for our
990,VI,possession may be an important part of life. I think none can fully
991,VI,"taste the sweetness, or behold the beauty, of English song even, until"
992,VI,he has wandered in the lanes and fields of the mother-country; and in
993,VI,"the case of foreign, and especially of the ancient, poets, so much of"
994,VI,"whose accepted and assumed world of fact has perished, the loss is very"
995,VI,great. I had trodden many an Italian hillside before I noticed how
996,VI,subtly Dante's landscape had become realized in my mind as a part of
997,VI,nature. I own to believing that Virgil's storms never blew on the sea
998,VI,"until once, near Salerno, as I rode back from Paestum, there came a"
999,VI,storm over the wide gulf that held my eyes enchanted--such masses of
1000,VI,"ragged, full clouds, such darkness in their broad bosoms broken with"
1001,VI,"rapid flame, and a change beneath so swift, such anger on the sea, such"
1002,VI,"an indescribable and awful gleaming hue, not purple, nor green, nor red,"
1003,VI,but a commingling of all these--a revelation of the wrath of colour! The
1004,VI,waves were wild with the fallen tempest; quick and heavy the surf came
1005,VI,"thundering on the sands; the light went out as if it were extinguished,"
1006,VI,"and the dark rain came down; and I said, ""'Tis one of Virgil's storms."""
1007,VI,"Such a one you will find also in Theocritus, where he hymns the children"
1008,VI,"of Leda, succourers of the ships that, ""defying the stars that set and"
1009,VI,"rise in heaven, have encountered the perilous breath of storms. The"
1010,VI,"winds raise huge billows about their stern, yea, or from the prow, or"
1011,VI,"even as each wind wills, and cast them into the hold of the ship, and"
1012,VI,"shatter both bulwarks, while with the sail limits nil the gear confused"
1013,VI,"and broken, and the wide sea rings, being lashed by the gusts and by"
1014,VI,"showers of iron hail."""
1015,VI,
1016,VI,"I must leave these older memories, to tell, so far as it is possible in"
1017,VI,"words, of that land of the idyl which of all enchanted retreats of the"
1018,VI,imagination is the hardest for him without the secret to enter. Yet here
1019,VI,I find it all about me in the places where the poets first unveiled it.
1020,VI,"Once before I had a sight of it, as all over Italy it glimpses at times"
1021,VI,from the hills and the campagna. Descending under the high peak of
1022,VI,"Capri, I heard a flute, and turned and saw on the neighbouring slopes"
1023,VI,"the shepherd-boy leading his flock, the music at his lips. Then the"
1024,VI,"centuries rolled together like a scroll, and I heard the world's morning"
1025,VI,"notes. That was a single moment; but here, day-long is the idyl world. I"
1026,VI,"read the old verses over, and in my walks the song keeps breaking in."
1027,VI,"The idyls are full of streams and fountains, just such as I meet with"
1028,VI,"wherever I turn, and the water counts in the landscape as in the poems."
1029,VI,"It is always tumbling over rocks in cascades, brawling with rounded"
1030,VI,"forms among the stones of the shallow brooks, bubbling in fountains, or"
1031,VI,"dripping from the cliff, or shining like silver in the plain. The run"
1032,VI,"that comes down from Mola, the torrent under the olive and lemon"
1033,VI,"branches toward Letojanni, the more open course in the ravine of the"
1034,VI,"mill down by Giardini, the cimeter of the far-seen Alcantara lying on"
1035,VI,"the campagna in the meadows, and that further _fiume freddo_, the cold"
1036,VI,"stream,--""chill water that for me deep-wooded Etna sends down from the"
1037,VI,"white snow, a draught divine,""--each of these seems inhabited by a"
1038,VI,"genius of its own, so that it does not resemble its neighbours. But all"
1039,VI,"alike murmur of ancient song, and bring it near, and make it real."
1040,VI,
1041,VI,"On the beach one feels most keenly the actuality of much of the idyls,"
1042,VI,and finds the continuousness of the human life that enters into them. No
1043,VI,"idyl appeals so directly to modern feeling, I suspect, as does that of"
1044,VI,the two fishermen and the dream of the golden fish. Go down to the
1045,VI,"shore; you will find the old men still at their toil, the same"
1046,VI,"implements, the same poverty, the same sentiment for the heart. Often as"
1047,VI,"I look at them I recall the old words, while the goats hang their heads"
1048,VI,"over the scant herbage, and the blue sea breaks lazily and heavily on"
1049,VI,the sands.
1050,VI,
1051,VI,"""Two fishers, on a time, two old men, together lay and slept; they had"
1052,VI,"strewn the dry sea-moss for a bed in their wattled cabin, and there lay"
1053,VI,against the leafy wall. Beside them wore strewn the instruments of their
1054,VI,"toilsome bands, the fishing-creels, the rods of reed, the hooks, the"
1055,VI,"sails bedraggled with sea-spoil, the lines, the weels, the lobster-pots"
1056,VI,"woven of rushes, the seines, two oars, and an old cobble upon props."
1057,VI,"Beneath their heads was a scanty matting, their clothes, their sailors'"
1058,VI,"caps. Here was all their toil, here all their wealth. The threshold had"
1059,VI,"never a door nor a watch-dog. All things, all, to them seemed"
1060,VI,"superfluity, for Poverty was their sentinel; they had no neighbour by"
1061,VI,"them, but ever against their narrow cabin gently floated up the sea."""
1062,VI,
1063,VI,This is what the eye beholds; and I dare not say that the idyl is
1064,VI,touched more with the melancholy of human fate for us than for the poet.
1065,VI,"Poverty such as this, so absolute, I see everywhere at every hour. It is"
1066,VI,a terrible sight. It is the physical hunger of the soul in wan limbs and
1067,VI,"hand, and the fixed gaze of the unhoping eyes--despair made flesh. How"
1068,VI,long has it suffered here? and was it so when Theocritus saw his fishers
1069,VI,and gave them a place in the country of his idyls? He spreads before us
1070,VI,"the hills and fountains, and fills the scene-with shepherds, and"
1071,VI,"maidens, and laughing loves, and among the rest are these two poor old"
1072,VI,men. The shadow of the world's poverty falls on this paradise now as
1073,VI,"then. With the rock and sea it, too, endures."
1074,VI,
1075,VI,A few traces of the old myths also survive on the landscape. Not far
1076,VI,"from here, down the coast, the rocks that the Cyclops threw after the"
1077,VI,fleeing mariners are still to be seen near the shore above which he
1078,VI,piped to Galatea. Some day I mean to take a boat and see them. But now I
1079,VI,"let the Cyclops idyls go, and with them Adonis of Egypt, and Ptolemy,"
1080,VI,"and the prattling women, and the praises of Hiero, and the deeds of"
1081,VI,"Herakles; these all belong to the cities of the pastoral, to its"
1082,VI,civilization and art in more conscious forms; but my heart stays in the
1083,VI,"campagna, where are the song-contests, the amorous praise of maidens,"
1084,VI,"the boyish boasting, the young, sweet, graceful loves. Fain would I"
1085,VI,"recover the breath of that springtime; but while from my foot ""every"
1086,VI,"stone upon the way spins singing,"" make what speed I can, I come not to"
1087,VI,"the harvest-feast. Bees go booming among the blossoms, and the flocks"
1088,VI,"crop their pasture, and night falls with Hesperus; but fruitless on my"
1089,VI,"lips, as at some shrine whence the god is gone, is Bion's prayer:"
1090,VI,"""Hesperus, golden lamp of the lovely daughter of the foam--dear"
1091,VI,"Hesperus, sacred jewel of the deep blue night, dimmer as much than the"
1092,VI,"moon as thou art among the stars preeminent, hail, friend!"" Dead now is"
1093,VI,"that ritual. Now more silent than ever is the country-side, missing"
1094,VI,"Daphnis, the flower of all those who sing when the heart is young. Sweet"
1095,VI,"was his flute's first triumph over Menaleas: ""Then was the boy glad, and"
1096,VI,"leaped high, and clapped his hands over his victory, as a young fawn"
1097,VI,"leaps about his mother""; but sweeter was the unwon victory when he"
1098,VI,"strove with Damoetas: ""Then Damoetas kissed Daphnis, as he ended his"
1099,VI,"song, and he gave Daphnis a pipe, and Daphnis gave him a beautiful"
1100,VI,"flute. Damoetas fluted, and Daphnis piped; the herdsmen, and anon the"
1101,VI,"calves, were dancing in the soft green grass. Neither won the victory,"
1102,VI,"but both were invincible."" And him, too, I miss who loved his friend,"
1103,VI,"and wished that they twain might ""become a song in the ears of all men"
1104,VI,"unborn,"" even for their love's sake; and prayed, ""Would, O Father"
1105,VI,"Cronides, and would, ye ageless immortals, that this might be, and that"
1106,VI,"when two generations have sped, one might bring these tidings to me by"
1107,VI,"Acheron, the irremeable stream: the loving-kindness that was between"
1108,VI,"thee and thy gracious friend is even now in all men's mouths, and"
1109,VI,"chiefly on the lips of the young."" Hill and fountain and pine, the gray"
1110,VI,"sea and Mother Etna, are here; but no children gather in the land, as"
1111,VI,"once about the tomb of Diocles at the coming in of the spring,"
1112,VI,"contending for the prize of the kisses--""Whoso most sweetly touches lip"
1113,VI,"to lip, laden with garlands he returneth to his mother. Happy is he who"
1114,VI,"judges those kisses of the children."" Lost over the bright furrows of"
1115,VI,the sea is Europa riding on the back of the divine bull as Moschus
1116,VI,"beheld her--""With one hand she clasped the beast's great horn, and with"
1117,VI,"the other caught up the purple fold of her garment, lest it might trail"
1118,VI,"and be wet in the hoar sea's infinite spray""; and from the border-land"
1119,VI,"of mythic story, that was then this world's horizon, yet more faintly"
1120,VI,the fading voice of Hylas answers the deep-throated shout of Herakles.
1121,VI,"Faint now as his voice are the voices of the shepherds who are gone,"
1122,VI,"youth and maiden and children; dimly I see them, vaguely I hear them; at"
1123,VI,"last there remains only ""the hoar sea's infinite spray."" And will you"
1124,VI,say it was in truth all a dream? Were the poor fisherman in their toil
1125,VI,"alone real, and the rest airy nothings to whom Sicily gave a local"
1126,VI,habitation and a name? It was Virgil's dream and Spenser's; and some
1127,VI,"secret there was--something still in our breasts--that made it immortal,"
1128,VI,"so that to name the Sicilian Muses is to stir an infinite, longing"
1129,VI,tenderness in every young and noble heart that the gods have softened
1130,VI,with sweet thoughts.
1131,VI,
1132,VI,"And here I shut in my pages the one laurel leaf that Taormina bore. She,"
1133,VI,"too, in her centuries has had her poet. Perhaps none who will see these"
1134,VI,words ever gave a thought to the name and fame of Cornelius Severus. Few
1135,VI,"of his works remain, and little is known of his life. He is said to have"
1136,VI,"been the friend of Pollio, and to have been present in the Sicilian war"
1137,VI,between Augustus and Sextus Pompey. He wrote the first book of an epic
1138,VI,"poem on that subject, so excellent that it has been thought that, had"
1139,VI,"the entire work been continued at the same level, he would have held the"
1140,VI,"second place among the Latin epic poets. He wrote also heroic songs, of"
1141,VI,"which fragments survive, one of which is an elegy upon Cicero, which"
1142,VI,"Seneca quotes, saying of him, ""No one out of so many talented men"
1143,VI,"deplored the death of Cicero better than Cornelius Severus."" Some"
1144,VI,dialogues in verse also seem to have been written by him. These
1145,VI,"fragments may not he easily obtained. But take down your Virgil; and, if"
1146,VI,"it be like this of mine which I brought from Rome, you will find at the"
1147,VI,"very end, last of the shorter pieces ascribed to the poet, one of the"
1148,VI,"length of a book of the ""Georgics,"" called ""Etna."" This is the work of"
1149,VI,Cornelius Severus. An early death took from him the perfection of his
1150,VI,genius and the hope of fame; but happy was the fortune of him who wrote
1151,VI,so well that for centuries his lines were thought not unworthy of
1152,VI,"Virgil, whose name still shields this Taorminian verse from oblivion."
1153,VI,
1154,VI,
1155,VII,VII
1156,VII,
1157,VII,It is my last day at Taormina. I have seen the sunrise from my old
1158,VII,"station by the Greek temple, and watched the throng of cattle and men"
1159,VII,gathered on the distant beach of Letojanni and darkening the broad bed
1160,VII,"of the dry torrent that there makes down to the sea, and I wished I"
1161,VII,"were among them, for it is their annual fair; and still I dwell on every"
1162,VII,feature of the landscape that familiarity has made more beautiful. The
1163,VII,"afternoon I have dedicated to a walk to Mola. It is a pleasant, easy"
1164,VII,"climb, with the black ancient wall of the city on the left, where it"
1165,VII,"goes up the face of the castle-rock, and on the right the deep ravine,"
1166,VII,"closed by Monte Venere in the west. All is very quiet; a silent, silent"
1167,VII,"country! There are few birds or none, and indeed I have heard no"
1168,VII,"bird-song since I have been here. Opposite, on the other side of the"
1169,VII,"wall of the ravine, are some cows hanging in strange fashion to the"
1170,VII,"cliff, where it seems goats could hardly cling; but the unwieldy,"
1171,VII,"awkward creatures move with sure feet, and seem wholly at home,"
1172,VII,"pasturing on the bare precipice. I cannot hear the torrent, now a narrow"
1173,VII,"stream, deep below me, but I see the women of Mola washing by the old"
1174,VII,fountain which is its source. There is no other sign of human life. The
1175,VII,"fresh spring flowers, large and coarse, but bright-coloured, are all I"
1176,VII,"have of company, and the sky is blue and the air like crystal. So I go"
1177,VII,"up, ever up, and at last am by the gate of Mola, and enter the"
1178,VII,"stony-hearted town. A place more dreary, desolate to the eye, is seldom"
1179,VII,"seen. There are only low, mean houses of gray stone, and the paved ways."
1180,VII,"If you can fancy a prison turned inside out like a glove, with all its"
1181,VII,"interior stone exposed to the sunlight, which yet seems sunlight in a"
1182,VII,"prison, and silence over all--that is Mola. The ruins of the fortress"
1183,VII,are near the gate on the highest point of the crag. Within is a barren
1184,VII,"spot--a cistern, old foundations, and some broken walls. Look over the"
1185,VII,"battlement westward, and you will see a precipice that one thinks only"
1186,VII,"birds could assail; and, observing how isolated is the crag on all"
1187,VII,"sides, you will understand what an inaccessible fastness this was, and"
1188,VII,cannot be surprised at its record of defence.
1189,VII,
1190,VII,"Perhaps here was the oldest dwelling-place of man upon the hill, and it"
1191,VII,"was the securest retreat. Monsignore, indeed, believes that Ham, the son"
1192,VII,"of Noah, who drove Japhet out of Sicily, was the first builder; but I do"
1193,VII,"not doubt its antiquity was very great, and it seems likely that this"
1194,VII,"was the original Siculian stronghold before the coming of the Greeks,"
1195,VII,and the building of the lower city of Taormina. The ruins that exist are
1196,VII,part of the fortress made by that governor who lost the city to the
1197,VII,"Saracens, to defend it against them on this side; and here it stood for"
1198,VII,"nigh a thousand years, like the citadel itself, an impregnable hold of"
1199,VII,"war. It seldom yielded, and always by treachery or mutiny; for more than"
1200,VII,"once, when Taormina was sacked, its citadel and Mola remained untaken"
1201,VII,and unconquerable on their extreme heights. I shall not tell its story;
1202,VII,"but one brave man once commanded here, and his name shall be its fame"
1203,VII,"now, and my last tale of the Taorminian past."
1204,VII,
1205,VII,"He was Count Matteo, a nobleman of the days when the Messenians revolted"
1206,VII,against the chancellor of Queen Margaret. He was placed over this
1207,VII,castle; and when a certain Count Riccardo was discovered in a conspiracy
1208,VII,"to murder the chancellor, and was taken captive, he was given into"
1209,VII,"Matteo's charge, and imprisoned here. The Messenians came and surprised"
1210,VII,"the lower city of Taormina, but they could not gain Mola nor persuade"
1211,VII,Matteo to yield Riccardo up to them. So they thought to overcome his
1212,VII,"fidelity cruelly. They took his wife and children, who were at Messina,"
1213,VII,"threw them into a dungeon, and condemned them to death. Then they sent"
1214,VII,Matteo's brother-in-law to treat with him. But when the count knew the
1215,VII,"reason of the visit he said: ""It seems to me that you little value the"
1216,VII,"zeal of an honest man who, loyal to his office, does not wish, neither"
1217,VII,"knows how, to break his sworn faith. My wife and children would look on"
1218,VII,me with scornful eyes should I be renegade; for shame is not the reward
1219,VII,"that sweetens life, but burdens it. If the Messenians stain themselves"
1220,VII,"with innocent blood, I shall weep for the death of my wife and sons, but"
1221,VII,"the heart of an honest citizen will have no remorse."" Then he was"
1222,VII,silent. But treachery could do what such threats failed to accomplish.
1223,VII,"One Gavaretto was found, who unlocked the prison, and Riccardo was"
1224,VII,"already escaping when Matteo, roused at a slight noise, came, sword in"
1225,VII,"hand, and would have slain him; but the traitor behind, ""to save his"
1226,VII,"wages,"" struck Matteo in the body, and the faithful count fell dead in"
1227,VII,"his blood. I thought of this story, standing there, and nothing else in"
1228,VII,"the castle's filled with bloom; then the infinite beauty, slowly"
1229,VII,"fading, withdrew the scene, and sweetly it parted from my eyes."
1230,VII,
1231,VII,
1232,VIII,VIII
1233,VIII,
1234,VIII,Yet once more I step out upon the terrace into the night. I hear the
1235,VIII,"long roar of the breakers; I see the flickering fishers' lights, and"
1236,VIII,Etna pale under the stars. The place is full of ghosts. In the darkness
1237,VIII,"I seem to hear vaguely arising, half sense, half thought, the murmur of"
1238,VIII,"many tongues that have perished here, Sicanian and Siculian and the lost"
1239,VIII,"Oscan, Greek and Latin and the hoarse jargon of barbaric slaves,"
1240,VIII,"Byzantine and Arabic confused with strange African dialects, Norman and"
1241,VIII,"Sicilian, French and Spanish, mingling, blending, changing, the sharp"
1242,VIII,"battle-cry of a thousand assaults rising from the low ravines, the"
1243,VIII,"death-cry of twenty bloody massacres within these walls, ringing on the"
1244,VIII,hard rock and falling to silence only to rise more full with fiercer
1245,VIII,pain--century after century of the battle-wrath and the battle-woe. My
1246,VIII,"fancy shapes the air till I see over the darkly lifted, castle-rock the"
1247,VIII,"triple crossing swords of Greek, Carthaginian, and Roman in the"
1248,VIII,"age-long duel, and as these fade, the springing brands of Byzantine,"
1249,VIII,"Arab, and Norman, and yet again the heavy blades of France, Spain, and"
1250,VIII,"Sicily; and ever, like rain or snow, falls the bloody dew on this lone"
1251,VIII,"hill-wide. ""Oh, wherefore?"" I whisper; and all is silent save the surge"
1252,VIII,still lifting round the coast the far voices of the old Ionian sea. I
1253,VIII,have wondered that the children of Etna should dwell in its lovely
1254,VIII,"paradise, as I thought how often, how terribly, the lava has poured"
1255,VIII,"forth upon it, the shower of ashes fallen, the black horror of volcanic"
1256,VIII,"eruption overwhelmed the land. Yet, sum it all, pang by pang, all that"
1257,VIII,"Etna ever wrought of woe to the sons of men, the agonies of her"
1258,VIII,"burnings, the terrors of her living entombments, all her manifold deaths"
1259,VIII,"at once, and what were it in comparison with the blood that has flowed"
1260,VIII,"on this hillside, the slaughter, the murder, the infinite pain here"
1261,VIII,"suffered at the hands of man. O Etna, it is not thou that man should"
1262,VIII,fear! He should fear his brother-man.
1263,VIII,

1265,IX,IX
1266,IX,
1267,IX,"The stars were paling over Etna, white and ghostly, as I came out to"
1268,IX,depart. In the dark street I met a woman with a young boy clinging to
1269,IX,"her side. Her black hair fell down over her shoulders, and her bosom was"
1270,IX,scantily clothed by the poor garment that fell to her ankles and her
1271,IX,"feet. She was still young, and from her dark, sad face her eyes met mine"
1272,IX,"with that fixed look of the hopeless poor, now grown familiar; the"
1273,IX,"child, half naked, gazed up at me as he held his mother's hand. What"
1274,IX,"brought her there at that hour, alone with her child? She seemed the"
1275,IX,"epitome of the human life I was leaving behind, come forth to bid"
1276,IX,farewell; and she passed on under the shadows of the dawn. The last star
1277,IX,faded as I went down the hollow between the spurs. Etna gleamed white
1278,IX,"and vast over the shoulder of the ravine, and, as I dipped down, was"
1279,IX,gone.

1287,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"There was an old cry, Return to Nature! Let us rather return unto the"
1288,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul. Nature is great, and her science marvellous; but it is man who"
1289,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knows it. In what he knows it is partial and subsidiary. Know thyself,"
1290,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,was the first command of reason; and wisdom was an ancient thing when
1291,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the sweet influences of the Pleiades and the path of Arcturus with his
1292,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sons were young in human thought. These late conquests of the mind in
1293,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the material infinities of the universe, its exploring of stellar space,"
1294,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its exhuming of secular time, its harnessing of invisible forces, this"
1295,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"new mortal knowledge, its sudden burst, its brilliancy and amplitude of"
1296,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"achievement, thought winnowing the world as with a fan; the vivid"
1297,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,spectacle of vast and beneficent changes wrought by this means in human
1298,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"welfare, the sense of the increase of man's power springing from"
1299,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unsuspected and illimitable resources,--all this has made us forgetful"
1300,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of truth that is the oldest heirloom of the race. In the balances of
1301,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,thought the soul of man outweighs the mass that gravitation measures.
1302,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Man only is of prime interest to men; and man as a spirit, a creature"
1303,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,but made in the likeness of something divine. The lapse of aeons touches
1304,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"us as little as the reach of space; even the building of our planet, and"
1305,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"man's infancy, have the faint and distant reality of cradle records."
1306,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Science may reconstruct the inchoate body of animal man, the clay of our"
1307,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mould, and piece together the primitive skeleton of the physical being"
1308,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,we now wear; but the mind steadily refuses to recognize a human past
1309,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"without some discipline in the arts, some exercise in rude virtue, and"
1310,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,some proverbial lore handed down from sire to son. The tree of knowledge
1311,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is of equal date with the tree of life; nor were even the tamer of
1312,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"horses, the worker in metals, or the sower, elder than those twin"
1313,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"guardians of the soul,--the poet and the priest. Conscience and"
1314,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,imagination were the pioneers who made earth habitable for the human
1315,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,spirit; they are still its lawgivers and where they have lodged their
1316,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"treasures, there is wisdom. I desire to renew the long discussion of the"
1317,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature and method of idealism by engaging in a new defence of poetry,"
1318,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"or the imaginative art in any of its kinds, as the means by which this"
1319,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wisdom, which is the soul's knowledge of itself, is stored up for the"
1320,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"race in its most manifest, enduring, and vital forms. It is, by literary"
1321,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tradition and association, a proud task. May I not take counsel of"
1322,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Spenser and be bold at the first door? Sidney and Shelley pleaded this
1323,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"cause. Because they spoke, must we be dumb? or shall not a noble example"
1324,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,be put to its best use in trying what truth can now do on younger lips?
1325,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The old hunt is up in the Muses' bower; and I would fain speak for that
1326,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,learning which has to me been light. I use this preface not unwillingly
1327,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in open loyalty to studies on which my youth was nourished, and the"
1328,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,masters I then loved whom the natural thoughts of youth made eloquent;
1329,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"my hope is to continue their finer breath, as they before drank from old"
1330,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fountains; but chiefly I name them as a reminder that the main argument
1331,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is age-long; it does not harden into accepted dogma; and it is thus
1332,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ceaselessly tossed because it belongs in that sphere of our warring
1333,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nature where conflict is perpetual. It goes on in the lives as well as
1334,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,on the lips of men. It is a question how to live as well as how to
1335,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"express life. Each race uses its own tongue, each age its dialect; but,"

1339,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The defenders of the soul inherit an old cause that links them together
1340,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in a long descent; but the battle is always to a present age.
1341,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Continually something is becoming superfluous, inapplicable, or wanting"
1342,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the work of the past. Victory itself makes arms useless, and consigns"
1343,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"them to dark closets. New times, new weapons, is the history of all"
1344,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"warfare. The doubt of the validity of the ideal, never absent from any"
1345,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intellectual period, is active on all sides, and in more than one"
1346,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,quarter passes into denial. Literature and the other arts of expression
1347,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,suffer throughout the world. To that point is it come that those of the
1348,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,old stock who believe that the imagination exercises man's faculty at
1349,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its highest pitch, and that the method of idealism is its law, are bid"
1350,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"step down, while others more newly grounded in what belongs to"
1351,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature possess the city; but seeing the shrines interdicted, the"
1352,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"obliteration of ancient names, the heroes' statues thrown down, shall"
1353,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,we learn what our predecessors never knew--to abdicate and abandon? I
1354,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,hear in the temples the footsteps of the departing gods--
1355,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1356,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Di quibus imperium hoc steterat;
1357,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1358,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,but no; for our opponents are worse off than those of whom it was said
1359,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that though one rose from the dead they would not believe,--Plato, being"
1360,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"dead, yet speaks, Shakspere treads our boards, and (why should I"
1361,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,hesitate?) Tennyson yet breathes among us though already immortal. That
1362,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which convinced the master minds of antiquity and many in later ages is
1363,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"still convincing, if it be attended to; the old tradition is yet"
1364,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unbroken; therefore, because I was bred in this faith, I will try to set"
1365,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,forth anew in the phrases of our time the eternal ground of reason on
1366,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which idealism rests.
1367,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1368,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The specific question concerns literature and its method, but its import"
1369,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is not mainly literary. Life is the matter of literature; and thence it
1370,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,comes that all leading inquiries to which literature gives rise probe
1371,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,for their premises to the roots of our being and expand in their issues
1372,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to the unknown limits of human fate. It is an error to think of idealism
1373,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as a thing remote, fantastic, and unsubstantial. It enters intimately"
1374,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"into the lives of all men, however humble and unlearned, if they live at"
1375,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,all except in their bodies. What is here proposed is neither
1376,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"speculative, technical, nor abstruse; it is practical in matter,"
1377,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"universal in interest, and touches upon those things which men most"
1378,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,should heed. I fear rather to incur the reproach of uttering truisms
1379,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,than paradoxes. But he does ill who is scornful of the trite. To be
1380,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,learned in commonplaces is no mean education. They make up the great
1381,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,body of the people's knowledge. They are the living words upon the lips
1382,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of men from generation to generation; the real winged words; the matter
1383,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the unceasing reiteration of families, schools, pulpits, libraries;"
1384,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the tradition of mankind. Proverb, text, homily,--happy the youth whose"
1385,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"purse is stored with these broad pieces, current, in every country and"
1386,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for every good, like fairy gifts of which the occasion only when it"
1387,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arises shows the use. It is with truth as with beauty,--familiarity"
1388,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,endears and makes it more precious. What is common is for that very
1389,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reason in danger of neglect, and from it often flashes that divine"
1390,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,surprise which most enkindles the soul. Why must Prometheus bring fire
1391,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,from heaven to savage man? Did it not sleep in the flint at his feet?
1392,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"How often, at the master stroke of life, has some text of Holy"
1393,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Scripture, which lay in the mind from childhood almost like the debris"
1394,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of memory, illuminated the remorseful darkness of the mind, or"
1395,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,interpreted the sweetness of God's sunshine in the happy heart! Common
1396,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as light is love, sang Shelley; and equally common with beauty and truth"
1397,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and love is all that is most vital to the soul, all that feeds it and"
1398,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"gives it power; if aught be lacking, it is the eye to see and the heart"
1399,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to understand. Grain, fruit and vegetable, wool, silk and cotton, gold,"
1400,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"silver and iron, steam and electricity,--were not all, like the spark,"
1401,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,within arm's reach of savage man? The slow material progress of mankind
1402,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,through ages is paralleled by the slow growth of the individual soul in
1403,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,laying hold of and putting to use the resources of spiritual strength
1404,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that are nigh unto it. The service of man to man in the ways of the
1405,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spirit is, in truth, an act as simple as the giving of a cup of cold"
1406,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,water to him who is athirst.
1407,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1408,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Can there be any surprise when I say that the method of idealism is that
1409,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of all thought? that in its intellectual process the art of the poet, so"
1410,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"far from being a sort of incantation, is the same as belongs to the"
1411,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"logician, the chemist, the statesman? It is no more than to say that in"
1412,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,creating literature the mind acts; the action of the mind is thought;
1413,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and there are no more two ways of thinking than there are two kinds of
1414,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,gravitation. Experience is the matter of all knowledge. It is given to
1415,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind as a complex of particular facts, a series, ever continuing, of"
1416,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"impressions outward and inward. It is stored in the memory, and were"
1417,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"memory the only mental faculty, no other knowledge than this of"
1418,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,particular facts in their temporal sequence could be acquired; the sole
1419,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,method of obtaining knowledge would be by observation. All literature
1420,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,would then be merely annals of the contents of successive moments in
1421,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their order. Reason, however, intervenes. Its process is well known. In"
1422,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"every object of perception, as it exists in the physical world and is"
1423,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"given by sensation to our consciousness, there is both in itself and in"
1424,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its relations a likeness to other objects and relations, and this"
1425,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,likeness the mind takes notice of; it thus analyzes the complex of
1426,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"experience, discerns the common element, and by this means classifies"
1427,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"particular facts, thereby condensing them into mental conceptions,--"
1428,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"abstract ideas, formulas, laws. The mind arrives at these in the"
1429,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"course of its normal operation. As soon as we think at all, we speak"
1430,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of white and black, of bird and beast, of distance and size,--of"
1431,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"uniformities in the behaviour of nature, or laws; by such classification"
1432,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of qualities, objects, and various relations, not merely in the sensuous"
1433,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"but in every sphere of our consciousness, the mind simplifies its"
1434,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"experience, compacts its knowledge, and economizes its energies. To this"
1435,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"work it brings, also, the method of experiment. It then interferes"
1436,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arbitrarily with the natural occurrence of facts, and brings that to"
1437,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,pass which otherwise would not have been; and this method it uses to
1438,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"investigate, to illustrate what was previously known, and to confirm"
1439,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what was surmised. Its end, whether through observation or experiment,"
1440,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is to reach general truth as opposed to matter-of-fact, universals more"
1441,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"or less embracing as opposed to particulars, the units of thought as"
1442,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,opposed to the units of phenomena. The body of these constitutes
1443,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,rational knowledge.
1444,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1445,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Nature then becomes known, not as a series of impressions on the retina"
1446,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of sense merely, but as a system seized by the eye of reason; for the"
1447,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"senses show man the aspect worn by the world as it is at the moment, but"
1448,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reason opens to him the order obtaining in the world as it must be at
1449,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,every moment; and the instrument by which man rises from the phenomenal
1450,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,plane of experience to the necessary sphere of truth is the generalizing
1451,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,faculty whose operation has just been described. The office of the
1452,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reason in the exercise of this faculty is to find organic form in that
1453,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"experience which memory preserves in the mass,--to penetrate, that is,"
1454,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to that mould of necessity in the world which phenomena, when they"
1455,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arise, must put on. The species once perceived, the mind no longer cares"
1456,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for the individual; the law once known, the mind no longer cares for the"
1457,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"facts; for in these universals all particular instances, past, present,"
1458,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and to come, are contained in their significance. All sciences are"
1459,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,advanced in proportion as they have thus organized their appropriate
1460,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"matter in abstract conceptions and laws, and are backward in proportion"
1461,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as there remains much in their provinces not yet so coordinated and
1462,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"systematized; and in their hierarchy, from astronomical physics"
1463,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"downward, each takes rank according to the nature of the universals it"
1464,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"deals with, as these are more or less embracing."
1465,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1466,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The matter of literature--that part of total experience which it deals
1467,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with--is life; and, to confine attention to imaginative literature where"
1468,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"alone the question of idealism arises, the matter with which imaginative"
1469,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,literature deals is the inward and spiritual order in man's breast as
1470,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,distinguished from the outward and physical order with which science
1471,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,deals. The reason as here exercised organizes man's experience in this
1472,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"great tract of emotion, will, and meditation, and so possesses man of"
1473,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"true knowledge of himself, just as in the realm of science it possesses"
1474,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"him of true knowledge of the physical world, or, in psychology and"
1475,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"metaphysics, of the constitution and processes of the mind itself. Such"
1476,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge is, without need of argument, of the highest consequence to"
1477,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mankind. It exceeds, indeed, in dignity and value all other knowledge;"
1478,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for to penetrate this inward or spiritual order, to grasp it with the"
1479,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mind and conform to it with the will, is not, as is the case with every"
1480,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"other sort of knowledge, the special and partial effort of selected"
1481,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"minds, but the daily business of all men in their lives. The method of"
1482,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the mind here is and must be the same with that by which it accomplishes
1483,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its work elsewhere, its only method. Here, too, its concern is with the"
1484,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,universal; its end is to know life--the life with which literature
1485,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"deals--not empirically in its facts, but scientifically in its necessary"
1486,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"order, not phenomenally in the senses but rationally in the mind, not"
1487,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,without relation in its mere procession but organically in its laws; and
1488,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its instrument here, as through the whole gamut of the physical sciences"
1489,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and of philosophy itself, is the generalizing faculty."
1490,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1491,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"One difference there is between scientific and imaginative truth,--a"
1492,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difference in the mode of statement. Science and also philosophy
1493,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"formulate truth and end in the formula; literature, as the saying is,"
1494,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"clothes truth in a tale. Imagination is brought in, and by its aid the"
1495,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mind projects a world of its own, whose principle of being is that it"
1496,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reembodies general or abstract truth and presents it concretely to the
1497,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eye of the mind, and in some arts gives it physical form. So, to draw an"
1498,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"example from science itself, when Leverrier projected in imagination the"
1499,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"planet Uranus, he incarnated in matter a whole group of universal"
1500,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"qualities and relations, all that go to make up a world, and in so doing"
1501,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"he created as the poet creates; there was as much of truth, too, in his"
1502,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,imagined world before he found the actual planet as there was of reality
1503,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the planet itself after it swam into his ken. This creation of the
1504,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,concrete world of art is the joint act of the imagination and the reason
1505,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,working in unison; and hence the faculty to which this act is ascribed
1506,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is sometimes called the creative reason, or shaping power of the mind,"
1507,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in distinction from the scientific intellect which merely knows. The
1508,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"term is intended to convey at once the double phase, under one aspect of"
1509,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which the reason controls imagination, and under the other aspect the"
1510,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imagination formulates the reason; it is meant to free the idea, on the"
1511,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"one hand, from that suggestion of abstraction implied by the reason, and"
1512,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to disembarrass it, on the other, of any connection with the irrational"
1513,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fancy; for the world of art so conceived is necessarily both concrete,"
1514,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"correspondent to the realities of experience, and truthful, subject to"
1515,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the laws of the universe; it cannot contain the impossible, it cannot"
1516,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"amalgamate the actual with the unreal, it cannot in any way lie and"
1517,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,retain its own nature. The use of this rational imagination is not
1518,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,confined to the world of art. It is only by its aid that we build up the
1519,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,horizons of our earthly life and fill them with objects and events
1520,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,beyond the reach of our senses. To it we are indebted for our knowledge
1521,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the greater part of others' lives, for our idea of the earth's"
1522,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"surface and the doings of foreign nations, of all past history and its"
1523,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"scene, and the events of primaeval nature which were even before man"
1524,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,was. So far as we realize the world at all beyond the limit of our
1525,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"private experience of it, we do so by the power of the imagination"
1526,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,acting on the lines of reason. It fills space and time for us through
1527,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,all their compass. Nor is it less operative in the practical pursuits of
1528,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,men. The scientist lights his way with it; the statesman forecasts
1529,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reform by it, building in thought the state which he afterward realizes"
1530,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in fact; the entire future lives to us--and it is the most important
1531,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,part of life--only by its incantation. The poet acts no otherwise in
1532,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"employing it than the inventor and the speculator even, save that he"
1533,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,uses it for the ends of reason instead of for his private interest. In
1534,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"some parts of this field there is, or was once, or will be, a physical"
1535,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"parallel, an actuality, containing the verification of the imagined"
1536,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"state of things; but so, for the poet, there is a parallel, a conception"
1537,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the reason just as normal, which is not the less real because it is a"
1538,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,tissue of abstract thought. In art this governance of the imagination by
1539,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the reason is fundamental, and gives to the office of the latter a"
1540,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,seeming primacy; and therefore emphasis is rightly placed on the
1541,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"universal element, the truth, as the substance of the artistic form. But"
1542,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the light of this preliminary description of the mental processes
1543,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"involved, let us take a nearer view of their particular employment in"
1544,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,literature.
1545,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1546,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Human life, as represented in literature, consists of two main branches,"
1547,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character and action. Of these, character, which is the realm of"
1548,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personality, is generalized by means of type, which is ideal character;"
1549,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"action, which is the realm of experience, by plot, which is ideal"
1550,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,action. It is convenient to examine the nature of these separately. A
1551,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"type, the example of a class, contains the characteristic qualities"
1552,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which make an individual one of that class; it does not differ in this
1553,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"elementary form from the bare idea of the species. The traits of a tree,"
1554,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for instance, exist in every actual tree, however stunted or imperfect;"
1555,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and in the type which condenses into itself what is common in all
1556,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"specimens of the class, these traits only exist; they constitute the"
1557,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"type. Comic types, in literature, are often simple abstractions of some"
1558,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"single human quality, and hence easily afford illustrations. The"
1559,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"braggart, the miser, the hypocrite, contain that one trait which is"
1560,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,common to the class; and in their portrayal this characteristic only is
1561,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"shown. In proportion as the traits are many in any character, the type"
1562,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"becomes complex. In simple types attention is directed to some one vice,"
1563,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passion, or virtue, capable of absorbing a human life in to itself. This"
1564,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is the method of Jonson, and, in tragedy, of Marlowe. As human energy"
1565,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"displays itself more variously in a life, in complex types, the mind"
1566,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contemplates human nature in a more catholic way, with a less exclusive"
1567,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"identification of character with specific trait, a more free conception"
1568,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of personality as only partially exhibited; thus, in becoming complex,"
1569,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"types gather breadth and depth, and share more in the mystery of"
1570,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,humanity as something incompletely known to us at the best. Such are the
1571,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,characters of Shakspere.
1572,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1573,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The manner in which types are arrived at and made recognizable in other
1574,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,arts opens the subject more fully and throws light upon their nature.
1575,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The sculptor observes in a group of athletes that certain physical
1576,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,habits result in certain moulds of the body; and taking such
1577,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"characteristics as are common to all of one class, and neglecting such"
1578,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as are peculiar to individuals, he carves a statue. So permanent are the"
1579,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"physical facts he relies upon that, centuries after, when the statue is"
1580,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"dug up, men say without hesitation--here is the Greek runner, there the"
1581,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,wrestler. The habit of each in life produces a bodily form which if it
1582,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,exists implies that habit; the reality here results from the operation
1583,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of physical laws and can be physically rendered; the type is
1584,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,constituted of permanent physical fact. There are habits of the soul
1585,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which similarly impress an outward stamp upon the face and form so
1586,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"certainly that expression, attitude, and shape authentically declare the"
1587,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,presence of the soul that so reveals itself. In the Phidian Zeus was all
1588,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"awe; in the Praxitelean Hermes all grace, sweetness, tenderness; in the"
1589,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Pallas Athene of her people who carved or minted her image in statue,"
1590,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"bas-relief, or coin, was all serene and grave wisdom; or, in the glowing"
1591,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and chastened colours of the later artistic time, the Virgin mother"
1592,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"shines out, in Fra Angelico all adoration, in Bellini all beatitude, in"
1593,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Raphael all motherhood. The sculptor and the painter are restricted to
1594,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the bodily signs of the soul's presence; but the poet passes into
1595,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,another and wider range of interpretation. He finds the soul stamped in
1596,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its characteristic moods, words, actions. He then creates for the mind's"
1597,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eye Achilles, Aeneas, Arthur; and in his verse are beheld their spirits"
1598,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,rather than their bodies.
1599,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1600,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,These several sorts of types make an ascending series from the
1601,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"predominantly physical to the predominantly spiritual; but, from the"
1602,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"present point of view, the arts which embody their creations in a"
1603,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,material form should not be opposed to literature which employs the
1604,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"least interrelation of sensation, as if the former had a physical and"
1605,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the last a spiritual content. All types have one common element, they"
1606,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"express personality; they have for the mind a spiritual meaning, what"
1607,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,they contain of human character; they differ here only in fulness of
1608,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,representation. The most purely physical types imply spiritual
1609,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"qualities, choice, will, command,--all the life which was a condition"
1610,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"precedent to the bodily perfection that was its flower; and, though the"
1611,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eye rests on the beautiful form, it may discern through it the human"
1612,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul of the athlete as in life; and, moreover, the figure may be"
1613,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"represented in some significant act, or mood even, but this last is"
1614,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rare. The more plainly spiritual types, physically rendered, are most"
1615,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,often shown in some such mood or act expressive in itself of the soul
1616,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whose habit lives in the form it has moulded. It is not that the plastic
1617,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and pictorial arts cannot spiritualize the stone and the canvas as well
1618,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as humanize it bodily; equally with the poetic art they reveal
1619,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character, but within narrower bounds. The limitation of these arts in"
1620,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"embodying personality is one of scope, not of intention; and though it"
1621,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"springs out of their use of material forms, it does so in a peculiar"
1622,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,way. It is not the employment of a physical medium of communication that
1623,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"differentiates them, for a physical medium of some sort is the only"
1624,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,means of exchange between mind and mind; neither is it the employment of
1625,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"a physical basis, for all art, being concrete, rests on a physical"
1626,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,basis--the world of imagination is exhaled from things that are. The
1627,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"physical basis of a drama, for instance, is manifest when it is enacted"
1628,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,on the stage; but it is substantially the same whether beheld in thought
1629,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,or ocularly.
1630,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1631,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The fact is that the limitation of sculpture and painting and their
1632,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,kindred arts results from their use of the physical basis of life only
1633,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"partially, and not as a whole as literature uses it. They set forth"
1634,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,their works in the single element of space; they exclude the changes
1635,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that take place in time. The types they show are arrested, each in its"
1636,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"moment; or if a story is told by a series of representations, it is a"
1637,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,succession of such moments of arrested life. The method is that of the
1638,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,camera; what is given is a fixed state. But literature renders life in
1639,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,movement; it revolves life through its moments as rapidly as on the
1640,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,retina of sense; its method is that of the kinetoscope. It holds under
1641,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its command change, growth, the entire energy of life in action; it can"
1642,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"chase mood with mood, link act to act. It alone can speak the word,"
1643,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which is the most powerful instrument of man. Hence the types it shows
1644,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"by presenting moods, words, and acts with the least obstruction of"
1645,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"matter and the slightest obligation to the active senses, are the most"
1646,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"complete. They have broken the bonds of the flesh, of moment and place."
1647,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"They exhibit themselves in actions; they speak, and in dialogue and"
1648,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soliloquy set forth their states of mind lying before, or accompanying,"
1649,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"or following their actions, thus interpreting these more fully. Action"
1650,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"by itself reveals character; speech illumines it, and casts upon the"
1651,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"action also a forward and a backward light. The lapse of time, binding"
1652,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all together, adds the continuous life of the soul. This large compass,"
1653,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the greatest reached by any art, rests on the wider command and"
1654,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,more flexible control which literature exercises over that physical
1655,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,basis which is the common foundation of all the arts. Hence it abounds
1656,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in complex types, just as other arts present simple types with more"
1657,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"frequency. All types, however, in so far as they appeal to the mind and"
1658,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"interpret the inward world, under which aspect alone they are now"
1659,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"considered, have their physical nature, materially or imaginatively,"
1660,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"even though it be solely visible beauty, in order to express"
1661,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,personality.
1662,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1663,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The type, in the usage of literature, must be further distinguished from"
1664,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the bare idea of the species as it has thus far been defined. It is more
1665,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,than this. It is not only an example; it is an example in a high state
1666,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of development, if not perfect. The best possible tree, for instance,"
1667,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"does not exist in nature, owing to a confused environment which does not"
1668,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,permit its formation. In literature a type is made a high type either by
1669,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intensity, if it be simple, or by richness of nature, if it be complex."
1670,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Miserliness, braggadocio, hypocrisy, in their extremes, are the"
1671,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"characters of comedy; a rich nature, such as Hamlet, showing variety of"
1672,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"faculty and depth of experience, is the hero of more profound drama."
1673,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"This truth, the necessity of high development in the type, underlay the"
1674,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"old canon that the characters of tragedy should be of lofty rank, great"
1675,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"place, and consequence in the world's affairs, preferably even of"
1676,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,historic fame. The canon erred in mistaking one means of securing
1677,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,credible intensity or richness for the many which are possible. The end
1678,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in view is to represent human qualities at their acme. In other times as
1679,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,a matter of fact persons highly placed were most likely to exhibit such
1680,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"development; birth, station, and their opportunities for unrestrained"
1681,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and conspicuous action made them examples of the compass of human
1682,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"energy, passion, and fate. New ages brought other conditions. Shakspere"
1683,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"recognized the truth of the matter, and laid the emphasis where it"
1684,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"belongs, upon the humanity of the king, not on the kingly office of the"
1685,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"man. Said Henry V: ""I think the king is but a man as I am; the violet"
1686,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to
1687,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"me; all his senses have but human conditions; his ceremonies laid by, in"
1688,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his appetites are higher
1689,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with like wing."""
1690,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Such, too, was Lear in the tempest. And from the other end of the scale"
1691,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"hear Shylock: ""Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,"
1692,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"dimensions, senses, appetites, passions? fed with the same food, hurt"
1693,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same"
1694,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian"
1695,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
1696,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not"
1697,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"revenge?"" Rank and race are accidents; the essential thing is that the"
1698,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"type be highly human, let the means of giving it this intensity and"
1699,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,richness be what they may.
1700,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1701,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It is true that the type may seem defective in the point that it is at
1702,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"best but a fragment of humanity, an abstraction or a combination of"
1703,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,abstracted qualities. There was never such an athlete as our Greek
1704,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sculptor's, never a pagan god nor Virgin Mother, nor a hero equal to"
1705,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Homer's thought, so beautiful, brave, and courteous, so terrible to his"
1706,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"foe, so loving to his friend. And yet is it not thus that life is known"
1707,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to us actually? does not this typical rendering of character fall in
1708,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with the natural habit of life? What man, what friend, is known to us"
1709,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"except by fragments of his spirit? Only one life, our own, is known to"
1710,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"us as a continuous existence. Just as when we see an orange, we supply"
1711,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the further side and think of it as round, so with men we supply from"
1712,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ourselves the unseen side that makes the man completely and continuously
1713,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"human. Moreover, it is a matter of common experience that men, we"
1714,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ourselves, may live only in one part, and the best, of our nature at one"
1715,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"moment, and yet for the moment be absorbed in that activity both in"
1716,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"consciousness and energy; for that moment we are only living so; now, if"
1717,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,a character were shown to us only in the moments in which he was living
1718,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"so, at his best and in his characteristic state as the soldier, the"
1719,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"priest, the lover, then the ideal abstraction of literature would not"
1720,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,differ from the actuality of our experience. In this selfsame way we
1721,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,habitually build for ourselves ideal characters out of dead and living
1722,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"men, by dwelling on that part of their career which we most admire or"
1723,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"love as showing their characteristic selves. Napoleon is the conqueror,"
1724,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"St. Francis the priest, Washington the great citizen, only by this"
1725,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,method. They are not thereby de-humanized; neither do the ideal types of
1726,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imagination fail of humanization because they are thus fragmentarily,"
1727,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"but consistently, presented."
1728,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1729,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The type must make this human appeal under all circumstances. Its whole
1730,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"meaning and virtue lie in what it contains of our common humanity, in"
1731,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the clearness and brilliancy with which it interprets the man in us, in"
1732,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the force with which it identifies us with human nature. If it is
1733,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"separated from us by a too high royalty or a too base villany, it loses"
1734,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligibility, it forfeits sympathy, it becomes more and more an"
1735,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"object of simple curiosity, and removes into the region of the unknown."
1736,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Even if the type passes into the supernatural, into fairyland or the"
1737,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"angelic or demoniac world, it must not leave humanity behind. These"
1738,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spheres are in fact fragments of humanity itself, projections of its"
1739,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sense of wonder, its goodness, and its evil, in extreme abstraction"
1740,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"though concretely felt. Fairy, angel, and devil cease to be conceivable"
1741,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"except as they are human in trait, however the conditions of their"
1742,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nature may be fancied; for we have no other materials to build with save
1743,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"those of our life on earth, though we may combine them in ways not"
1744,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,justified by reason. In so far as these worlds are in the limits of
1745,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rational imagination, they are derived from humanity, partial"
1746,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"interpretations of some of its moods, portions of itself; and the beings"
1747,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,who inhabit them are impaired for the purposes of art in the degree to
1748,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which their abstract nature is felt as stripping them of complete
1749,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"humanity. For this reason in dealing with such simple types, being"
1750,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"natures all of one strain, it has been found best in practice to import"
1751,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,into them individually some quality widely common to men in addition to
1752,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that limited quality they possess by their conception. Some touch of
1753,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"weakness in an angel, some touch of pity in a devil, some unmerited"
1754,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"misfortune in an Ariel, bring them home to our bosoms; just as the"
1755,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"frailty of the hero, however great he be, humanizes him at a stroke."
1756,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Thus these abstract fragments also are reunited with humanity, with the"
1757,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whole of life in ourselves.
1758,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1759,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Types, then, whether simple or complex, whether apparently physical or"
1760,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"purely spiritual, whether given fragmentary or as wholes of personality,"
1761,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,express human character in its essential traits. They may be narrow or
1762,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"broad generalizations; but if to know ourselves be our aim, those"
1763,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"types, which show man his common and enduring nature, are the most"
1764,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"valuable, and rank first in importance; in proportion as they are"
1765,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"specialized, they are less widely interpretative; in proportion as they"
1766,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"escape from time and place, race, culture, and religion, and present man"
1767,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eternal and universal in his primary actions, moods, and passions, they"
1768,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,appeal to a greater number and with more permanence; they become
1769,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,immortal in becoming universal. To preserve this universality is the
1770,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"essence of the type, and the degree of universality it reaches is its"
1771,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,measure of value to men. It is immaterial whether it be simple as Ajax
1772,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"or complex as Hamlet, whether it be the work of imagination solely as in"
1773,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Hercules, or have a historical basis as in Agamemnon; its exemplary"
1774,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,rendering of man in general is its substance and constitutor its
1775,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ideality.
1776,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1777,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Action, the second great branch of life, is generalized by plot. It"
1778,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"lies, as has been said, in the region of experience. Character, though"
1779,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it may be conceived as latent, can be presented only energetically as it"
1780,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,finds outward expression. It cannot be shown in a vacuum. It embodies or
1781,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reveals itself in an act; form and feature, as expressive of character,"
1782,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,are the record of past acts. This act is the link that binds type to
1783,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"plot. By means of it character enters the external world, determining"
1784,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the course of events and being passively affected by them. Plot takes
1785,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"account of this interplay and sets forth its laws. It is, therefore,"
1786,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"more deeply engaged with the environment, as type is more concerned with"
1787,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the man in himself. It is, initially, a thing of the outward as type is"
1788,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"a thing of the inward world. How, then, does literature, through plot,"
1789,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reduce the environment in its human relations to organic form?
1790,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1791,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The course of events, taken as a whole, is in part a process of nature"
1792,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"independent of man, in part the product of his will. It is a continuous"
1793,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"stream of phenomena in great multiplicity, and proceeding in a temporal"
1794,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sequence. Science deals with that portion of the whole which is
1795,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"independent of man, and may be called natural events, and by discerning"
1796,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,causal relations in them arrives at the conception of law as a principle
1797,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of unchanging and necessary order in nature. Science seeks to reduce the
1798,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,multiplicity and heterogeneity of facts as they occur to these simple
1799,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,formulas of law. Science does not begin in reality until facts end;
1800,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"facts, ten or ten thousand, are indifferent to her after the law which"
1801,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contains them is found, and are a burden to her until it is found."
1802,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Literature, in its turn, deals with human events; and, in the same way"
1803,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as science, by attending to causal relations, arrives at the conception"
1804,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of spiritual law as a similarly permanent principle in the order of the
1805,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,soul. This causal unity is the cardinal idea of plot which by
1806,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,definition is a series of events causally related and conceived as a
1807,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unit, technically called the action. Plot is thus analogous to an"
1808,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"illustrative experiment in science; it is a concrete example of law,--it"
1809,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is law operating.
1810,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1811,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The course of events again, so far as they stand in direct connection"
1812,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with human life, may be thought of as the expression of the individual's"
1813,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"own will, or of that of his environment. The will of the environment may"
1814,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"be divided into three varieties, the will of nature, the will of other"
1815,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"men, and the will of God. In each case it is will embodied in events. If"
1816,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,these ideas be all merged in the conception of the world as a totality
1817,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whose course is the unfolding of one Divine will operant throughout it
1818,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and called Fate or Providence, then the individual will, through which,"
1819,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as through nature also, the Divine will works, is only its servant."
1820,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Action so conceived, the march of events under some heavenly power"
1821,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,working through the mass of human will which it overrules in conjunction
1822,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with its own more comprehensive purposes, is epic action; in it"
1823,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"characters are subordinate to the main progress of the action, they are"
1824,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only terms in the action; however free they may be apparently,"
1825,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"considered by themselves, that freedom is within such limits as to allow"
1826,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"entire certainty of result, its mutations are included in the"
1827,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,calculation of the Divine will. The action of the Aeneid is of this
1828,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nature: a grand series of destined events worked out through human
1829,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,agency to fulfil the plan of the ruler of all things in heaven and
1830,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"earth. On the other hand, if the course of events be more narrowly"
1831,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"attended to within the limits of the individual's own activity, as the"
1832,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"expression primarily and significantly of his personal will, then the"
1833,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,successive acts are subordinate to the character; they are terms of the
1834,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character which is thereby exhibited; they externalize the soul. Action,"
1835,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"so conceived, is dramatic action. If in the course of events there"
1836,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,arises a conflict between the will of the individual and that of his
1837,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"environment, whether nature, man, or God, then the seed of tragedy,"
1838,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"specifically, is present; this conflict is the essential idea of"
1839,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tragedy. In all these varieties of action, the scene is the external"
1840,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world; plot lies in that world, and sets forth the order, the causal"
1841,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"principle, obtaining in it."
1842,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1843,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"It is necessary, however, to refine upon this statement of the matter."
1844,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The course of external events, in so far as it affects one person,"
1845,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"whether as proceeding from or reacting upon him, reveals character, and"
1846,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,has meaning as an interpretation of inward life. It is a series outward
1847,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"indeed, but parallel with the states of will, intellect, and emotion"
1848,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which make up the consciousness of the character; and it is interesting
1849,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"humanly only as a mirror of them. It is not the murderous blow, but the"
1850,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"depraved will; not the pale victim, but the shocked conscience; not the"
1851,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"muttered prayer, the frantic penance, the suicide, but remorse working"
1852,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"itself out, that hold our attention. Plot here manifests the law of"
1853,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character outwardly; but the human reality lies within, and to be seen"
1854,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,requires the illumination which only our own hearts can give. All
1855,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fiction is such a shadowing forth of the soul. The constancy, the"
1856,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intimacy, the profundity with which Shakspere felt this, from the"
1857,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"earliest syllables of his art, and the frequency with which he dwells"
1858,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"upon it, mark a characteristic of genius. Says Richard II:--"
1859,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1860,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;"
1861,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,And those external manners of lament
1862,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
1863,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,That swells in silence in the tortured soul;
1864,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"There lies the substance."""
1865,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1866,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"So Theseus, of the play of the rude artisans of Athens, excusing all"
1867,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art: ""The best in this kind are but shadows."" So Hamlet; so Prospero."
1868,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1869,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Action is vital in us, and has a double order of phenomena; so far as"
1870,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"these are physical, their law is one of the physical world, and"
1871,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,interests us no more than other physical laws; so far as they belong in
1872,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the inward world of self-consciousness, their law is spiritual, and has"
1873,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,human interest as being operant in a soul like our own. The external
1874,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fact is seized by the eye as a part of nature; the internal fact is of
1875,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the unseen world, and is beheld only in the light which is within our"
1876,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,own bosoms--it is spiritually discerned. On the stage plainly this is
1877,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the case. So far as the actions are for the eye of sense alone they are
1878,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"merely spectacular; so far as they express desires and energies, they"
1879,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"are dramatic, and these we do not see but feel according as our"
1880,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,experience permits us so to comprehend them. We contemplate a world of
1881,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"emotion there in connection with the active energy of the will, a world"
1882,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of character in operation in man; we feed it from our life, interpret it"
1883,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"therefrom, build it up in ourselves, suffering the illusion till"
1884,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,absorbed in what is arising in our consciousness under the actor's
1885,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,genius we become ourselves the character. The greatest actor is he who
1886,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,makes the spectator play the part. So far is the drama from the scene
1887,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that it goes on in our own bosoms; there is the stage without any
1888,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,illusion whatsoever; the play in vital for the moment in ourselves.
1889,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1890,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,And what is true of the stage is true of life. It is only through our
1891,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,own hearts that we look into the hearts of others. We interpret the
1892,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,external signs of sense in terms of personality and experience known
1893,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only within us; the life of will, head, and heart that we ascribe to"
1894,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our nearest and dearest friends is something imagined, something never"
1895,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,seen any more than our own personality. Thus our knowledge of them is
1896,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"not only fragmentary, as has been said; it is imaginative even within"
1897,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its limits. It is, in reality as well as in art, a shadow-world we live"
1898,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in, believing that within its sensuous films a spirit like unto"
1899,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ourselves abides,--the human soul, though never seen face to face. To"
1900,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,enter this substantial world behind the phenomena of human life as
1901,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sensibly shown in imagination, to know the invisible things of"
1902,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personality and experience, and to set them forth as a spiritual order,"
1903,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is the main end of ideal art. Though in plot the outward order is
1904,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"brought into the fullest prominence, and may seem to occupy the field,"
1905,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,yet it is significantly only the shadow of that order within.
1906,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1907,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,In thus presenting plot as the means by which the history of a single
1908,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul is externalized, one important element has been excluded from"
1909,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"consideration. The causal chain of events, which constitutes plot, has a"
1910,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"double unity, answering to the double order of phenomena in action as a"
1911,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"state of mind and a state of external fact. Under one aspect, so much"
1912,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the action as is included in any single life and is there a linked
1913,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sequence of mental states, has its unity in the personality of that"
1914,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"individual. Under the other aspect, the entire action which sets forth"
1915,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the relations of all the characters involved, of their several courses"
1916,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of experience as elements in the working out of the joint result, has"
1917,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its unity in the constitution of the universe,--the impersonal order,"
1918,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that structure of being itself, which is independent of man's will,"
1919,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is imposed upon him as a condition of existence, and which he must"
1920,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"accept without appeal. This necessity, to give it the best name, to"
1921,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which man is exposed without and subjected within, is in its broadest"
1922,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conception the power that increases life, and all things are under its"
1923,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sway. Its sphere is above man's will; he knows it as immutable law in
1924,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,himself as it is in nature; it is the highest object of his thoughts.
1925,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Its workings are submitted to his observation and experiment as a part
1926,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the world of knowledge; he sees its operation in individuals, social"
1927,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"groups, and nations, and sets it forth in the action of the lyric, the"
1928,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"drama, and the epic as the law of life. In its sphere is the higher"
1929,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,unity of plot by virtue of which it integrates many lives in one main
1930,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"action. Such, then, is the nature of plot as intermediary between man"
1931,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and his environment, but deeply engaged in the latter, and not to be"
1932,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,freed from it even by a purely spiritualistic philosophy; for though we
1933,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"say that, as under one aspect plot shadows forth the unseen world of the"
1934,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul's life, so under the other it shadows forth the invisible will of"
1935,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"God, we do not escape from the outward world. Sense is still the medium"
1936,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,by which only man knows his brother man and God also as through a glass
1937,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"darkly,--"
1938,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1939,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""The painted veil which those who live call life."""
1940,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1941,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"It separates all spirits, the beautiful but dense element in which the"
1942,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,pure soul is submerged.
1943,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1944,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It is necessary only to summarize the characteristics of plot which are
1945,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,merely parallel to those of type already illustrated. Plot may be simple
1946,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,or complex; it may be more or less involved in physical conditions in
1947,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,proportion as it lays stress on its machinery or its psychology; it must
1948,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"be important, as the type must be high, but important by virtue of its"
1949,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,essential human meaning and not of its accidents; it is a fragment of
1950,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"destiny only, but in this falls in with the way life in others is known"
1951,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to us; if it passes into the superhuman world, it must retain human"
1952,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,significance and be brought back to man's life by devices similar to
1953,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,those used in the type for the same purpose; it rises in value in
1954,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"proportion to the universality it contains, and gains depth and"
1955,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,permanence as it is interpretative of common human fate at all times and
1956,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,among all men; it may be purely imaginary or founded on actual
1957,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,incidents; and its exemplary interpretation of man's life is its
1958,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"substance, and constitutes its ideality."
1959,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1960,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"In the discussion of type and plot, the concrete nature of the world of"
1961,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art, which was originally stated to be the characteristic work of the"
1962,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"creative reason, or imagination acting in conformity with truth, has"
1963,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"been assumed; but no reason has been given for it, because it seemed"
1964,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,best to develop first with some fulness the nature of that inward order
1965,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which is thus projected in the forms of art. It belongs to the frailty
1966,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of man that he seizes with difficulty and holds with feebleness the pure
1967,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ideas of the intellect, the more in proportion as they are removed from"
1968,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sense; and he seeks to support himself against this weakness by framing
1969,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sensible representations of the abstract in which the mind can rest.
1970,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Thus in all lands and among savage tribes, as well as in the most"
1971,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"civilized nations, symbols have been used immemorially. The flag of a"
1972,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nation has all its meaning because it is taken as a physical token of
1973,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"national honour, almost of national life itself. The Moslem crescent,"
1974,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the Christian cross, have only a similar significance, a bringing near"
1975,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to the eye of what exists in reality only for the mind and heart. A
1976,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"symbol, however, is an arbitrary fiction, and stands to the idea as a"
1977,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,metaphor does to the thing itself. In literature the parable of the
1978,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mustard seed to which the kingdom of heaven was likened, exemplifies"
1979,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,symbolical or metaphorical method; but the tale of the court of Arthur's
1980,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knights, ideal method; between them, and sharing something of both, lies"
1981,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"allegorical method. Idolatry is the religion of symbolism, for the image"
1982,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is not the god; Christianity is the religion of idealism, for Christ is"
1983,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"God incarnate. Idealism presents the reality itself, the universal truth"
1984,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"made manifest in the concrete type, and there present and embodied in"
1985,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its characteristics as they are, not merely arbitrarily by a fiction of"
1986,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thought, symbolically or allegorically."
1987,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
1988,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The way in which type concretes truth is sufficiently plain; but it may
1989,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"be useful, with respect to plot, to draw out more in detail the analogy"
1990,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which has been said to exist between it and an illustrative scientific
1991,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"experiment. If scientific law is declared experimentally, the course of"
1992,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature is modified by intent; certain conditions are secured, certain"
1993,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,others eliminated; a selected train of phenomena is then set in motion
1994,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to the end that the law may be illustrated, and nothing else. In a"
1995,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,perfect experiment the law is in full operation. In plot there is a like
1996,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"selection of persons, situations, and incidents so arranged as to"
1997,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,disclose the working of that order which obtains in man's life. The law
1998,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,may be simple and shown by means of few persons and incidents in a brief
1999,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"way, as in ancient drama, or complex and exhibited with many characters"
2000,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in an abundance of action over a wide scene as in Shakspere; in either
2001,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,case equally there is a selection from the whole mass of man's life of
2002,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,what shall illustrate the causal union in its order and show it in
2003,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,action. The process in the epic or prose narrative is the same. The
2004,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,common method of all is to present the universal law in a particular
2005,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,instance made for the purpose.
2006,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2007,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"In thus clothing itself in concrete form, truth suffers no"
2008,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"transformation; it remains what it was, general truth, the very essence"
2009,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of type and plot being, as has been said, to preserve this universality"
2010,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the particular instance. There is a sense in which this general truth
2011,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is more real, as Plato thought, than particulars; a sense in which the"
2012,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"phenomenal world is less real than the system of nature, for phenomena"
2013,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"come and go, but the law remains; a sense in which the order in man's"
2014,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"breast is more real than he is, in whom it is manifest, for the form of"
2015,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ideas, the mould of law, are permanent, but their expression in us"
2016,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"transitory. It is this higher realism, as it was anciently called, that"
2017,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind strives for in idealism,--this organic form of life, the object"
2018,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of all rational knowledge. Types, under their concrete disguise, are"
2019,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,thus only a part of the general notions of the mind found in every
2020,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"branch of knowledge and necessary to thought; plots, similarly, are only"
2021,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,a part of the general laws of the ordered world; literature in using
2022,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"them, and specializing them in concrete form by which alone they differ"
2023,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in appearance from like notions and laws elsewhere, merely avails itself"
2024,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of that condensing faculty of the mind which most economizes mental
2025,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,effort and loads conceptions with knowledge. In the type it is not
2026,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personal, but human character that interests the mind; in plot, it is"
2027,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"not personal, but human fate."
2028,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2029,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"While it is true that the object of ideal method is to reach universals,"
2030,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and reembody them in particular instances, this reasoning action is"
2031,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,often obscurely felt by the imagination in its creative process. The
2032,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,very fact that its operation is through the concrete complicates the
2033,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,process. The mind of genius working out its will does not usually start
2034,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,with a logical attempt consciously; it does not arrive at truth in the
2035,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,abstract and then reduce it to concrete illustration in any systemic
2036,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,way; it does not select the law and then shape the plot. The poet is
2037,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,rather directly interested in certain characters and events that appeal
2038,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to him; his sympathies are aroused, and he proceeds to show forth, to"
2039,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"interpret, to create; and in proportion as the characters he sets in"
2040,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,motion and the circumstances in which they are placed have moulding
2041,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"force, they will develop traits and express themselves in influences"
2042,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that he did not foresee. This is a matter of familiar knowledge to
2043,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"authors, who frequently discover in the trend of the imaginary tale a"
2044,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"will of its own, which has its unforeseen way. The drama or story, once"
2045,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"set in motion, tends to tell itself, just as life tends to develop in"
2046,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the world. The vitality of the clay it works in, is one of the curious"
2047,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"experiences of genius, and occasions that mood of mystery in relation to"
2048,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their creatures frequently observed in great writers. In fact, this mode"
2049,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of working in the concrete, which is characteristic of the creative"
2050,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imagination, gives to its activity an inductive and experimental"
2051,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character, not to be confounded with the demonstrative act of the"
2052,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intellect which states truth after knowing it, and not in the moment of"
2053,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its discovery. In literature this moment of discovery is what makes that
2054,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"flash which is sometimes called intuition, and is one of the great"
2055,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,charms of genius.
2056,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2057,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The concrete nature of ideal art, to touch conveniently here upon a"
2058,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"related though minor topic, is also the reason that it expresses more"
2059,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,than its creator is aware of. In imaging life he includes more reality
2060,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"than he attends to; but if his representation has been made with truth,"
2061,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,others may perceive phases of reality that he neglected. It is the mark
2062,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of genius, as has hitherto appeared, to grasp life, not fragmentarily,"
2063,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"but in the whole. So, in a scientific experiment, intended to illustrate"
2064,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"one particular form of energy, a spectator versed in another science may"
2065,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,detect some truth belonging in his own field. This richer significance
2066,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of great works is especially found where the union of the general and
2067,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the particular is strong; where the fusion is complete, as in Hamlet. In"
2068,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"a sense he is more real than living men, and we can analyze his nature,"
2069,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"have doubts about his motives, judge differently of his character, and"
2070,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,value his temperament more or less as one might with a friend. The more
2071,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imaginative a character is, in the sense that his personality and"
2072,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,experience are given in the whole so that one feels the bottom of
2073,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reality there, the more significance it has. Thus in the world of art"
2074,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,discoveries beyond the intention of the writer may be made as in the
2075,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,actual world; so much of reality does it contain.
2076,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2077,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Will it be said that, in making primary the universal contents and"
2078,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spiritual significance of type and plot, I have made literature"
2079,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"didactic, as if the word should stop my mouth? If it is meant by this"
2080,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that I maintain that literature conveys truth, it may readily be"
2081,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"admitted, since only thus can it interest the mind which has its whole"
2082,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,life in the pursuit and its whole joy in the possession of truth. But if
2083,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it be meant that abstract or moral instruction has been made the
2084,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"business of literature, the charge may be met with a disclaimer, as"
2085,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"should be evident, first, from the emphasis placed on its concrete"
2086,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"dealing with persons and actions. On the contrary, literature fails in"
2087,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,art precisely in proportion as it becomes expressly such a teacher.
2088,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Secondly, the life which literature organizes, the whole of human nature"
2089,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in its relation to the world, is many-sided; and imaginative genius, the"
2090,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"creative reason, grasps it in its totality. The moral aspect is but one"
2091,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"among many that life wears. If ethics are implicit in the mass of life,"
2092,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"so also are beauty and passion, pathos, humour, and terror; and in"
2093,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature any one of these may be the prominent phase at the moment,"
2094,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for literature gives out not only practical moral wisdom, but all the"
2095,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reality of life. Literature is didactic in the reproachful sense of the
2096,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,word only in proportion as type and plot are distinctly separated from
2097,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the truth they embody, and ceases to be so in proportion as these are"
2098,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,blended and unified. The fable is one of the most ancient forms of such
2099,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"didactic literature; in it a story is told to enforce a lesson, and"
2100,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"animals are made the characters, in consequence of which it has the"
2101,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,touch of humour inseparable from the spectacle of beasts playing at
2102,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,being men; but the very fact that the moral is of men and the tale is of
2103,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beasts involves a separation of the truth from its concrete embodiment,"
2104,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and besides the moral is stated by itself. In the Oriental apologue an
2105,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"advance is made. The parables of our Lord, in particular, are admirable"
2106,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"examples of its method. The characters are few, the situations common,"
2107,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the action simple, and the moral truth or lesson enforced is so"
2108,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,completely clothed in the tale that it needs no explanation; at the same
2109,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"time, the mind is aware of the teacher. In the higher forms of"
2110,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature, however, the fusion of ethics with life may be complete."
2111,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Here the poet works so subtly that the mind is not aware of the
2112,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,illumination of this light which comes without the violence of the
2113,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"preacher, until after the fact; and, indeed, the effect is wrought more"
2114,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"through the sympathies than the reason. In such a case literature,"
2115,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"though it conveys moral with other kinds of truth, is not open to the"
2116,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"charge of didacticism, which is valid only when teaching is explicit and"
2117,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"abstract. The educative power of literature, however, is not diminished"
2118,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"because in its art it dispenses with the didactic method, which by its"
2119,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"very definiteness is inelastic and narrow; in fact, the more imaginative"
2120,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"a character is, the more fruitful it may be even in moral truth; it may"
2121,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"teach, as has been said, what the poet never dreamed his work contained."
2122,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2123,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"If, then, to sum up the argument thus far, the subject-matter of"
2124,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature is life in the forms of personality and experience, and the"
2125,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,particular facts with respect to these are generalized by means of type
2126,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and plot in concrete form, and so are set forth as phases of an ordered"
2127,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world for the intelligence, to the end that man may know himself in the"
2128,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"same way as he knows nature in its living system--if this be so, what"
2129,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,standing have those who would restrict literature to the actual in life?
2130,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"who would replace ideal types of manhood by the men of the time, and"
2131,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the ordered drama of the stage by the medley of life? They deny art,"
2132,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the instrument of the creative reason, to literature; for as"
2133,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soon as art, which is the process of creating a rational world, begins,"
2134,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the necessity for selection arises, and with it the whole question of"
2135,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"values, facts being no longer equal among themselves on the score of"
2136,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"actuality, nor in fitness for the work in hand. The trivial, the"
2137,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"accidental, the unmeaning, are rejected, and there will be no stopping"
2138,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"short of the end; for art, being the handmaid of truth, can employ no"
2139,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"other than the method of all reason, wherefore idealism is to it what"
2140,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"abstraction is to logic and induction to natural science,--the breath of"
2141,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its rational being. Those who hold to realism in its extreme form, as a"
2142,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"representation of the actual only, behave as if one should say to the"
2143,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,philosopher--leave this formulation of general notions and be content
2144,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with sensible objects; or to the scientist--experiment no more, but"
2145,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"observe the course of nature as it may chance to arise, and describe it"
2146,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in its succession. They bid us be all eye, no mind; all sense, no"
2147,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thought; all chance, all confusion, no order, no organization, no"
2148,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fabric of the reason. But there are no such realists; though pure
2149,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"realism has its place, as will hereafter be shown, it is usually found"
2150,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,mixed with ideal method; and as commonly employed the word designates
2151,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the preference merely for types and plots of much detail, of narrow"
2152,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"application, of little meaning, in opposition to the highly generalized"
2153,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and significant types and plots usually associated with the term
2154,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,idealism. In what way such realism has its place will also appear at a
2155,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,later stage. Here it is necessary to say no more than that in proportion
2156,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as realism uses the ideal method only at the lowest, it narrows its"
2157,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"appeal, weakens its power, and takes from literature her highest"
2158,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,distinction by virtue of which she grasps the whole of character and
2159,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fate in her creation and informs man of the secrets of his human heart,"
2160,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the course of his mortal destiny, and the end of all his spiritual"
2161,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,effort and aspiration.
2162,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2163,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,I am aware that I have not proceeded so far without starting objections.
2164,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"To meet that which is most grave, what shall I say when it is alleged"
2165,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that there is no order such as I have assumed in life; or, if there be,"
2166,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that it is insufficiently known, too intangible and complex, too"
2167,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"various in different races and ages, to be made the subject of such an"
2168,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"exposition as obtains of natural order? Were this assertion true, yet"
2169,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,there would be good reason to retain our illusion; for the mind delights
2170,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in order, and will invent it. The mind is perplexed and disturbed until"
2171,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it finds this order; and in the progressive integration of its
2172,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,experience into an ordered world lies its work. Art gives pleasure to
2173,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the intellect, because in its structure whatever is superfluous and"
2174,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"extrinsic has been eliminated, so that the mind contemplates an artistic"
2175,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,work as a unity of relations bound each to each which it fully
2176,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"comprehends. Such works, we say, have form, which is just this"
2177,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,interdependence of parts wholly understood which appeals to the
2178,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intellect, and satisfies it: they would please the mind, though the"
2179,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"order they embody were purely imaginary, just as science would delight"
2180,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it, were the order of nature itself illusory. Creative art would thus"
2181,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,still have a ground of being under a sceptical philosophy; man would
2182,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,delight to dream his dream. But it is not necessary to take this lower
2183,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,line of argument.
2184,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2185,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It does not appear to me to be open to question that there is in the
2186,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,soul of man a nature and an order obtaining in it as permanent and
2187,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,universal as in the material world. The soul of man has a common being
2188,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in all. There could be no science of logic, psychology, or metaphysics"
2189,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"on the hypothesis of any uncertainty as to the identity of mind in all,"
2190,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nor any science of ethics on the hypothesis of any variation as to the
2191,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"identity of the will in all, nor any ground of expression even, of"
2192,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"communication between man and man, on the hypothesis of any radical"
2193,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difference in the experience and faculties to which all expression
2194,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,appeals for its intelligibility; neither could there be any system of
2195,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life in social groups, or plan for education, unless such a common basis"
2196,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is accepted. The postulate of a common human nature is analogous to that
2197,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the unity of matter in science; it finds its complete expression in
2198,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the doctrine of the brotherhood of man, for if race be fundamentally"
2199,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"distinguished from race as was once thought, it is only as element is"
2200,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"distinguished from element in the old chemistry. So, too, the postulate"
2201,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of an order obtaining in the soul, universal and necessary, independent"
2202,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of man's volition, analogous in all respects to the order of nature, is"
2203,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,parallel with that of the constancy of physical law. A rational life
2204,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"expects this order. The first knowledge of it comes to us, as that of"
2205,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"natural law, by experience; in the social world--the relations of men to"
2206,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,one another--and in the more important region of our own nature we learn
2207,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the issue of certain courses of action as well as in the external world;
2208,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in our own lives and in our dealings with others we come to a knowledge
2209,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of, and a conformity to, the conditions under which we live, the laws"
2210,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"operant in our being, as well as those of the physical world. Literature"
2211,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"assumes this order; in Aeschylus, Cervantes, or Shakspere, it is this"
2212,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that gives their work interest. Apart from natural science, the whole"
2213,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,authority of the past in its entire accumulation of wisdom rests upon
2214,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the permanence of this order, and its capacity to be known by man; that"
2215,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"virtue makes men noble and vice renders them base, is a statement without"
2216,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,meaning unless this order is continuous through ages; all principles of
2217,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"action, all schemes of culture, would be uncertain except on this"
2218,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,foundation.
2219,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2220,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,So near is this order to us that it was known long before science came
2221,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to any maturity. We have added, in truth, little to our knowledge of"
2222,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,humanity since the Greeks; and if one wonders why ethics came before
2223,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"science, let him own at least that its priority shows that it is near"
2224,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and vital in life as science is not. We can do, it seems, without"
2225,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Kepler's laws, but not without the Decalogue. The race acquires first"
2226,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what is most needful for life; and man's heart was always with him, and"
2227,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"his fate near. A second reason, it may be noted, for the later"
2228,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"development of science is that our senses, as used by science, are more"
2229,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mental now, and the object itself is observable only by the intervention"
2230,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the mind through the telescope or microscope or a hundred instruments
2231,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"into which, though physical, the mind enters. Our methods, too, as well"
2232,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as our instruments, are things of the mind. It behooves us to remember"
2233,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in an age which science is commonly thought to have materialized, that"
2234,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"more and more the mind enters into all results, and fills an ever larger"
2235,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,place in life; and this should serve to make materialism seem more and
2236,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,more what it is--a savage conception. But recognizing the great place of
2237,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mind in modern science, and its growing illumination of our earthly"
2238,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"system, I am not disposed to discredit its earliest results in art and"
2239,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,morals. I find in this penetration of the order of the world within us
2240,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,our most certain truth; and as our bodies exist only by virtue of
2241,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sharing in the general order of nature, so, I believe, our souls have"
2242,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"being only by sharing in this order of the inward, the spiritual world."
2243,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2244,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"What, then, is this order? We do not merely contemplate it: we are"
2245,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"immersed in it, it is vital in us, it is that wherein we live and move"
2246,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and have our being, ever more and more in proportion as the soul's life"
2247,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,outvalues the body in our experience. It is necessary to expand our
2248,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,conception of it. Hitherto it has been presented only as an order of
2249,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,truth appealing to the intellect: but the intellect is only one function
2250,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the soul, and thinkers are the merest fraction of mankind. We know"
2251,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this order not only as truth, but as righteousness; we know that certain"
2252,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"choices end in enlarging and invigorating our faculties, and other"
2253,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"choices in their enfeeblement and extinction; and the race adds, acting"
2254,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"under the profound motive of self-preservation, that it is a duty to do"
2255,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the one thing and avoid the other, and stores up this doctrine in"
2256,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conscience. We know this order again under the aspect of joy, for joy"
2257,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"attends some choices, and sorrow others; and again under the aspect of"
2258,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beauty, for certain choices result in beauty and others in deformity."
2259,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"What I maintain is that this order exists under four aspects, and may be"
2260,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"learned in any of them--as an order of truth in the reason, as an order"
2261,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of virtue in the will, as an order of joy in the emotions, as an order"
2262,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of beauty in the senses. It is the same order, the same body of law,"
2263,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"operating in each case; it is the vital force of our fourfold life,--it"
2264,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"has one unity in the intellect, the will, the emotions, the senses,--is"
2265,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"equal to the whole nature of man, and responds to him and sustains him"
2266,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,on every side. A lover of beauty in whom conscience is feeble cannot
2267,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wander if he follow beauty; nor a cold thinker err, though without a"
2268,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"moral sense, if he accept truth; nor a just man, nor a seeker after pure"
2269,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"joy merely, if they act according to knowledge each in his sphere. The"
2270,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,course of action that increases life may be selected because it is
2271,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reasonable, or joyful, or beautiful, or right; and therefore one may say"
2272,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fearlessly, choose the things that are beautiful, the things that are"
2273,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"joyful, the things that are reasonable, the things that are right, and"
2274,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,all else shall be added unto you. The binding force in this order is
2275,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what literature, ideal literature, most brings out and emphasizes in its"
2276,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"generalizations, that causal union which has hitherto been spoken of in"
2277,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the region of plot only; but it exists in every aspect of this order,"
2278,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and literature universalizes experience in all these realms, in the"
2279,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,provinces of beauty and passion no less than in those of virtue and
2280,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge, and its method is the same in all."
2281,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2282,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Is not our knowledge of this fourfold order in its principles, in those"
2283,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"relations of its phenomena which constitute its laws, of the highest"
2284,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"importance of anything of human concern? In harmony with these laws, and"
2285,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only thus, we ourselves, in whom this order is, become happy, righteous,"
2286,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wise, and beautiful. In ideal literature this knowledge is found,"
2287,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"expressed, and handed down age after age--the knowledge of necessary and"
2288,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"permanent relations in these great spheres which, taken together,"
2289,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,exhaust the capacities of life. Man's moral sense is strong in
2290,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,proportion as he apprehends necessity in the sequence of will and act;
2291,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"his intellect is strong, his emotions, his sense of beauty, are strong"
2292,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the same way in proportion as he apprehends necessity in each several
2293,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"field of experience. And conversely, the weakness of the intellect lies"
2294,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in a greater or less failure to realise relations of fact in their
2295,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"logic; and the other faculties, in proportion as they fail to realize"
2296,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"such relations in their own region, have a similar incapacity. Insanity,"
2297,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the broad sense, is involuntary error in a nature incapable of"
2298,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"effectual enlightenment, and hence abnormal or diseased; but the state"
2299,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of error, whether more or less, whether voluntary or involuntary,"
2300,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"whether curable or incurable, in itself is the same. To take an example"
2301,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"from one sphere, in the moral world the criminal through ignorance of or"
2302,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,distrust in or revolt from the supreme divine law seeks to maintain
2303,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,himself by his own power solitarily as if he might be a law unto
2304,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"himself; he experiences, without the intervention of any human judge,"
2305,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the condemnation which consigns him to enfeeblement and extinction
2306,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"through the decay and death of his nature, as a moral being, stage by"
2307,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"stage; this is God's justice, visiting sin with death. Similarly, and to"
2308,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"most more obviously, in society itself, the criminal against society,"
2309,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"because he does not understand, or believe, or prefers not to accept"
2310,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arbitrary social law as the means by which necessarily the general good,"
2311,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"including his own, is worked out, seeks to substitute for it his own"
2312,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligence, his cunning, in his search for prosperity, as he conceives"
2313,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it, by an adaptation of means to ends on his own account. This is why"
2314,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the imperfection of human law is sometimes a just excuse for social
2315,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"crime in those whom society does not benefit, its slaves and pariahs."
2316,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"But whether in God's world or in man's, the mind of the criminal,"
2317,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,disengaging itself from reliance on the whole fabric for whatever
2318,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reason, pulverizes because he fails to realize the necessary relations"
2319,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the world in which he lives in their normal operation, and has no"
2320,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,effectual belief in them as unavoidably operant in his nature or over
2321,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,his fortunes. This was the truth that lay in the Platonic doctrine that
2322,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,all sin is ignorance; but Plato did not take account of any possible
2323,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,depravity in the will. Nor is what has been illustrated above true of
2324,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind and the will only. In the region of emotion and of beauty,"
2325,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"there may be similar aberration, if these are not grasped in their vital"
2326,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature, in organic relation to the whole of life."
2327,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2328,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"These several parts of our being are not independent of one another, but"
2329,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,are in the closest alliance. They act conjointly and with one result in
2330,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the single soul in which they find their unity as various energies of
2331,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,one personal power. It cannot be that contradiction should arise among
2332,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"them in their right operation, nor the error of one continue undetected"
2333,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,by the others; that the base should be joyful or the wicked beautiful in
2334,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reality, is impossible. In the narrow view the lust of the eye and the"
2335,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pride of life may seem beautiful, but in the broad perspective of the"
2336,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,inward world they take on ugliness; in the moment they may seem
2337,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pleasurable, but in the backward reach of memory they take on pain; to"
2338,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"assert eternity against the moment, to see life in the whole, to live as"
2339,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"if all of life were concentrated in its instant, is the chief labour of"
2340,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind, the eye, the heart, the enduring will, all together. To"
2341,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"represent a villain as attractive is an error of art, which thus"
2342,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"misrepresents the harmony of our nature. Satan, as conceived by Milton,"
2343,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"may seem to be a majestic figure, but he was not so to Milton's"
2344,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imagination. ""The Infernal Serpent"" is the first name the poet gives"
2345,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,him; and though sublime imagery of gloom and terror is employed to
2346,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"depict his diminished brightness and inflamed malice, Milton repeatedly"
2347,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"takes pains to degrade him to the eye, as when in Paradise he is"
2348,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"surprised at the ear of Eve ""squat like a toad""; and when he springs up"
2349,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in his own form there, as the ""grisly king,"" he mourns most his beauty"
2350,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"lost; neither is his resolute courage long admirable. To me, at least,"
2351,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"so far from having any heroic quality, he seems always the malign fiend"
2352,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sacrificing innocence to an impotent revenge. In all great creations of
2353,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art it is necessary that this consistency of beauty, virtue, reason, and"
2354,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,joy should he preserved.
2355,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2356,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"It is true that the supremacy of law in this inward world, so"
2357,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"constituted, is less realized than in the physical world; but even in"
2358,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the latter the wide conviction of its supremacy is a recent thing, and"
2359,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in some parts of nature it is still lightly felt, especially in those"
2360,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which touch the brain most nearly, while under the stress of exceptional"
2361,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,calamity or strong desire or traditional religious beliefs it often
2362,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,breaks down. But if the order of the material universe seems now a more
2363,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"settled thing than the spiritual law of the soul, once the case was"
2364,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reversed; God was known and nature miraculous. It must be remembered,"
2365,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"too, in excuse of our feebleness of faith, that we are born bodily into"
2366,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the physical world and are forced to live under its law; but life in the
2367,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spiritual world is more a matter of choice, at least in respect to its"
2368,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"degree; its phenomena are, in part, contingent upon our development and"
2369,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"growth, on our living habitually and intelligently in our higher nature,"
2370,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the laws of which as communicated to us by other minds are in part
2371,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,prophecies of experience not yet actual in ourselves. It is the
2372,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"touchstone of experience, after all, that tries all things in both"
2373,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"worlds, and experience in the spiritual world may be long delayed; it is"
2374,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,power of mind that makes wide generalizations in both; and the
2375,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,conception of spiritual law is the most refined as perhaps it is the
2376,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,most daring of human thoughts.
2377,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2378,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The expansion of the conception of ideal literature so as to embrace
2379,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"these other aspects, in addition to that of rational knowledge which has"
2380,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thus far been exclusively dwelt upon, requires us to examine its nature"
2381,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the regions of beauty, joy, and conscience, in which, though"
2382,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"generalization remains its intellectual method, it does not make its"
2383,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,direct appeal to the mind. It is not enough to show that the creative
2384,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reason in its intellectual process employs that common method which is
2385,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the parent of all true knowledge, and by virtue of its high matter,"
2386,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the divine order in the soul, holds the primacy among man's"
2387,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"faculties; the story were then left half told, and the better part yet"
2388,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to come. To enlighten the mind is a great function; but in the mass of
2389,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mankind there are few who are accessible to ideas as such, especially on"
2390,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the unworldly side of life, or interested in them. Idealism does not"
2391,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,confine its service to the narrow bounds of intellectuality. It has a
2392,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"second and greater office, which is to charm the soul. So characteristic"
2393,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of it is this power, so eminent and shining, that thence only springs"
2394,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the sweet and almost sacred quality breathing from the word itself.
2395,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Idealism, indeed, by the garment of sense does not so much clothe wisdom"
2396,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as reveal her beauty; so the Greek sculptor discloses the living form by
2397,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the plastic folds. Truth made virtue is her work of power, and she"
2398,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,imposes upon man no harder task than the mere beholding of that sight--
2399,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2400,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""Virtue in her shape how lovely,"""
2401,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2402,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which since it first abashed the devil in Paradise makes wrong-doers
2403,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"aware of their deformity, and yet has such subtle and penetrating might,"
2404,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"such fascination for all finer spirits, that they have ever believed"
2405,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with their master, Plato, that should truth show her countenance"
2406,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unveiled and dwell on earth, all men would worship and follow her."
2407,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2408,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The images of Plato--those images in which alone he could adequately
2409,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,body forth his intuitions of eternity--present the twofold attitude of
2410,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our nature, in mind and heart, toward the ideal with vivid distinctness;"
2411,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and they illustrate the more intimate power of beauty, the more"
2412,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fundamental reach of emotion, and the richness of their mutual life in"
2413,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the soul. Under the aspect of truth he likens our knowledge of the ideal
2414,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to that which the prisoners of the cave had of the shadows on the wall;
2415,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,under the aspect of beauty he figures our love for it as that of the
2416,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passionate lover. As truth, again,--taking up in his earliest days what"
2417,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,seems the primitive impulse and first thought of man everywhere and at
2418,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all times,--under the image of the golden chain let down from the"
2419,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"throne of the god, he sets forth the heavenly origin of the ideal and"
2420,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its descent on earth by divine inspiration possessing the poet as its
2421,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passive instrument; and later, bringing in now the cooperation of man in"
2422,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the act, he again presents the ideal as known by reminiscence of the"
2423,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul's eternal life before birth, which is only a more defined and"
2424,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,rationalized conception of inspiration working normally instead of by
2425,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the special act and favour of God. As beauty, again, he shows forth the"
2426,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,enthusiasm evoked by the ideal in the image of the charioteer of the
2427,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,white and black horses mastering them to the goal of love. In these
2428,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,various ways the first idealist thought out these distinctions of truth
2429,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and beauty as having a real community, though a divided life in the mind"
2430,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and heart; and, as he developed,--and this is the significant"
2431,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"matter,--the poet in him controlling his speech told ever more"
2432,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eloquently of the charm with which beauty draws the soul unto itself,"
2433,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,for to the poet beauty is nearer than truth. It is the persuasion with
2434,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which he sets forth this charm, rather than his speculation, which has"
2435,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fastened upon him the love of later ages. He was the first to discern in
2436,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"truth and beauty equal powers of one divine being, and thus to effect"
2437,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the most important reconciliation ever made in human nature.
2438,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2439,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"So, too, from the other great source of the race's wisdom, we are told"
2440,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the Scriptures that though we be fallen men, yet is it left to us to"
2441,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,lift our eyes to the beauty of holiness and be healed; for every ray of
2442,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that outward loveliness which strikes upon the eye penetrates to the
2443,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"heart of man. Then are we moved, indeed, and incited to seek virtue with"
2444,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,true desire. Prophet and psalmist are here at one with the poet and the
2445,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,philosopher in spiritual sensitiveness. At the height of Hebrew genius
2446,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the personality of Christ, it is the sweet attractive grace, the"
2447,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"noble beauty of the present life incarnated in his acts and words, the"
2448,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"divine reality on earth and not, as Plato saw it, in a world removed,"
2449,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that has drawn all eyes to the Judean hill. The years lived under the
2450,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Syrian blue were a rending of the veil of spiritual beauty which has
2451,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,since shone in its purity on men's gaze. It is this loveliness which
2452,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"needs only to be seen that wins mankind. The emotions are enlisted; and,"
2453,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"however we may slight them in practice, the habit of emotion more than"
2454,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the habit of mind enters into and fixes inward character. More men are
2455,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,saved by the heart than by the head; more youths are drawn to excellence
2456,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,by noble feelings than are coldly reasoned into virtue on the ground of
2457,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,gain. Some there are among men so colourless in blood that they embrace
2458,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the right on the mere calculation of advantage, but they seem to possess"
2459,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only an earthly virtue; some, beholding the order of the world, desire"
2460,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to put themselves in tune with nature and the soul's law, and these are"
2461,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of a better sort; but most fortunate are they who, though well-nurtured,"
2462,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"find virtue not in profit, nor in the necessity of conforming to"
2463,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"implacable law, but in mere beauty, in the light of her face as it first"
2464,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,comes to them with ripening years in the sweet and noble nature of those
2465,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,they grow to love and honour among the living and the dead. For this is
2466,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Achilles made brave, that he may stir us to bravery; and surely it were"
2467,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,little to see the story of Pelops' line if the emotions were not
2468,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"awakened, not merely for a few moments of intense action of their own"
2469,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"play, but to form the soul. The emotional glow of the creative"
2470,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,imagination has been once mentioned in the point that it is often more
2471,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,absorbed in the beauty and passion than in the intellectual
2472,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"significance of its work; here, correspondingly, it is by the heart to"
2473,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which it appeals rather than by the mind it illumines that it takes hold
2474,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of youth.
2475,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2476,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"What, then, is the nature of this emotional appeal which surpasses so"
2477,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"much in intimacy, pleasure, and power the appeal to the intellect? It is"
2478,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the keystone of the inward nature, that which binds all together in the"
2479,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arch of life. Emotion has some ground, some incitement which calls it"
2480,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,forth; and it responds with most energy to beauty. In the strictest
2481,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sense beauty is a unity of relations of coexistence in coloured space
2482,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and appeals to the eye; it is in space what plot is in time. Like plot,"
2483,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it is deeply engaged in the outward world; it exists in the sensuous
2484,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"order, and it shadows forth the spiritual order in man only in so far as"
2485,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"a fair soul makes the body beautiful, as Spenser thought,--the mood, the"
2486,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"act, and the habit of heroism, love, and the like nobilities of man,"
2487,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"giving grace to form, feature, and attitude. It is primarily an outward"
2488,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thing, as emotion, which is a phase of personality, is an inward thing;"
2489,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what the necessary sequence of events, the chain of causation, is to"
2490,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"plot,--its cardinal idea,--that the necessary harmony of parts, the"
2491,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"chime of line and colour, is to beauty; thus beauty is as inevitable as"
2492,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fate, as structurally planted in the form and colour of the universe as"
2493,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fate is in its temporal movement. And as plot has its characteristic
2494,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unity in the impersonal order of God's will, shown in time's event, so"
2495,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,beauty has its characteristic unity in the same order shown in the
2496,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,visible creation of space. It is true that all phenomena are perceived
2497,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"by the mind, and are conditioned, as is said, by human modes of"
2498,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,perception; but within the limits of the relativity of all our
2499,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge, beauty is initially a sensuous, not a spiritual, thing, and"
2500,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,though the structure of the human eye arranges the harmonies of line and
2501,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"colour, it is no more than as the form of human thought arranges cause"
2502,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and effect and other primary relations in things; beauty does not in
2503,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"becoming humanly known cease to be known as a thing external,"
2504,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"independent of our will, and imposed on us from without. It is this"
2505,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"outward reality, the harmony of sense, that sculpture and painting add"
2506,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in their types to the interpretation they otherwise give of personality,"
2507,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and often in them this physical element is predominant; and in the
2508,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"purely decorative arts it may be exclusive. In landscape, which is in"
2509,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the realm of beauty, personality altogether disappears, unless, indeed,"
2510,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nature be interpreted in the mood of the Psalmist as declaring its
2511,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Creator; for the reflection which the presence of man may cast upon
2512,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nature as his shadow is not expressive of any true personality there
2513,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"abiding, but enters into the scene as the face of Narcissus into the"
2514,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,brook. The pleasure which the mind takes in beauty is only a part of its
2515,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,general delight in order of any sort; and visible artistic form as
2516,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,abstracted from the world of space is merely a species of organic form
2517,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and is included in it.
2518,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2519,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The eye, however, governs so large a part of the sensuous field, the"
2520,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,idea of beauty as a unity of space-relations giving pleasure is so
2521,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"simple, and the experience is so usual, that the word has been carried"
2522,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,over to the life of the more limited senses in which analogous phenomena
2523,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"arise, differing only in the fact that they exist in another sense. Thus"
2524,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the dominion of the ear especially, we speak commonly of the beauty"
2525,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of music; but the life of the minor senses, touch, taste, and smell, is"
2526,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,composed of too simple elements to allow of such combination as would
2527,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"constitute specific form in ordinary apprehension, though in the blind"
2528,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and deaf the possibility of high and intelligible complexity in these
2529,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"senses is proved. Similarly, the term is carried over to the invisible"
2530,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and inaudible world of the soul within itself, and we speak of the"
2531,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beauty of Sidney's act, of Romeo's nature, and, in the abstract, of the"
2532,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beauty of holiness, and, in a still more remote sphere, of the beauty of"
2533,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,a demonstration or a hypothesis; by this usage we do not so much
2534,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,describe the thing as convey the charm of the thing. This charm is more
2535,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,intimate and piercing to those of sensuous nature who rejoice in visible
2536,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,loveliness or in heard melodies; but to the spiritually minded it may be
2537,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as close and penetrating in the presence of what is to them dearer than
2538,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life and light, and is beheld only by the inner eye. It is this charm,"
2539,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whether flowing from the outward semblance or shining from the unseen
2540,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"light, that wins the heart, stirs emotion, wakes the desire to be one"
2541,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with this order manifest in truth and beauty, in the spirit and the body"
2542,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of things, to go out toward it in love, to identify one's being with it"
2543,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as the order of life, mortal and immortal; last the will quickens, and"
2544,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its effort to make this order prevail in us and possess us is virtue.
2545,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The act through all its phases is, as has been said, one act of the"
2546,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul, which first perceives, then loves, and finally wills. Emotion is"
2547,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the intermediary between the divine order and the human will; it
2548,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"responds to the beauty of the one and directs the choice of the other,"
2549,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and is felt in either function as love controlling life in the new
2550,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,births of the spirit.
2551,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2552,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The emotion, to return to the world of art, which is felt in the"
2553,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,presence of imaginary things is actual in us; but the attempt is made to
2554,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,fix upon it a special character differentiating it from the emotion felt
2555,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the presence of reality. One principle of difference is sought in the
2556,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"point that in literature, or in sculpture and painting, emotion entails"
2557,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"no action; it has no outlet, and is without practical consequences; the"
2558,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,will is paralyzed by the fatuity of trying to influence an unreal series
2559,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of events, and in the case of the object of beauty in statue or painting"
2560,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,by the impossibility of possession. The world of art is thus thought of
2561,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as one of pure contemplation, a place of escape from the difficulties,"
2562,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the pangs, and the incompleteness that beset all action. It is true that"
2563,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the imagined world creates special conditions for emotion, and that the"
2564,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,will does not act in respect to that world; but does this imply any
2565,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"radical difference in the emotion, or does it draw after it the"
2566,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"consequence that the will does not act at all? Checked emotion, emotion"
2567,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"dying in its own world, is common in life; and so, too, is contemplation"
2568,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as a mode of approach to beauty, as in landscape, or even in human"
2569,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,figures where there is no thought of any other possession than the
2570,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"presence of beauty before the eye and soul; escape, too, into a sphere"
2571,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of impersonality, in the love of nature or the spectacle of life, is a"
2572,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"common refuge. Art does not give us new faculties, generate unknown"
2573,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"habits, or in any way change our nature; it presents to us a new world"
2574,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only, toward which our mental behaviour is the same as in the rest of"
2575,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life. Why, then, should emotion, the most powerful element in life, be"
2576,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,regarded as a fruitless thing in that ideal art which has thus far
2577,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,appeared as a life in purer energy and higher intensity of being than
2578,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,life itself?
2579,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2580,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The distinction between emotion depicted and that felt in response must
2581,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"be kept in mind to avoid confusion, for both sorts are present at the"
2582,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,same time. In literature emotion may be set forth as a phase of the
2583,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,character or as a term in the plot; it may be a single moment of high
2584,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,feeling as in a lyric or a prolonged experience as in a drama; it may be
2585,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"shown in the pure type of some one passion as in Romeo, or in the"
2586,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"various moods of a rich nature as in Hamlet; but, whether it be"
2587,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"predominant or subordinate in any work, it is there treated in the same"
2588,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,way and for the same purpose as other materials of life. What happens
2589,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"when literature gives us, for instance, examples of moral experience? It"
2590,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"informs the mind of the normal course of certain lines of action, of the"
2591,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,inevitable issues of life; it breeds habits of right thinking in respect
2592,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to these; it is educative, and though we do not act at once upon this"
2593,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge, when the occasion arises we are prepared to act. So, when"
2594,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature presents examples of emotional experience, it informs us of"
2595,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the nature of emotion, its causes, occasions, and results, its value in"
2596,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character, its influence on action, the modes of its expression; it"
2597,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"breeds habits of right thinking in respect to these, and is educative;"
2598,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and, just as in the preceding case, though we do not act at once upon"
2599,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this knowledge, when the occasion arises we are prepared to act."
2600,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Concurrently with emotions thus objectively presented there arises in us
2601,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,a similar series of emotions in the beholding; by sympathy we ourselves
2602,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"feel what is before us, the emotions there are also in us in proportion"
2603,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as we identify ourselves with the character; or, in proportion as our"
2604,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"own individuality asserts itself by revolt, a contrary series arises of"
2605,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"hatred, indignation, or contempt, of pity for the character or of terror"
2606,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the feeling that what has happened to one may happen to us in our
2607,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,humanity. We are taught in a more intimate and vital way than through
2608,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ideas alone; the lesson has entered into our bosoms; we have lived the
2609,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,life. Literature is thus far more powerfully educative emotionally than
2610,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intellectually; and if the poet has worked with wisdom, he has bred in"
2611,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"us habits of right feeling in respect to life, he has familiarized our"
2612,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"hearts with love and anger, with compassion and fear, with courage, with"
2613,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"resolve, has exercised us in them upon their proper occasions and in"
2614,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their noble expression, has opened to us the world of emotion as it"
2615,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ought to be in showing us that world as it is in men with all its
2616,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"possibilities of baseness, ugliness, and destruction. This is the"
2617,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,service which literature performs in this field. Imagination shows us a
2618,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,scheme of emotion attending the scheme of events and presents it in its
2619,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"general connection with life, in simple, powerful, and complete"
2620,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"expression, on the lines of inevitable law in its sphere. We go out from"
2621,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the sway of this imagined world, more sensitive to life, more accessible"
2622,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to emotion, more likely and more capable, when the occasion arises, to"
2623,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"feel rightly, and to carry that feeling out into an act. In all"
2624,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literature the knowledge gained objectively, whether of action or"
2625,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"emotion, is a preparation for life; but this intimate experience of"
2626,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,emotion in connection with an imagined world is a more vital
2627,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"preparation, and enters more directly, easily, and effectually into"
2628,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,men's bosoms.
2629,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2630,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Two particular phases of this educative power should be specifically
2631,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mentioned. The objective presentation of emotion in literature, as has"
2632,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"been often observed, corrects the perspective of our own lives, as does"
2633,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,also the action which it envelops; and by showing to us emotion in
2634,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intense energy, which by this intensity corresponds to high type and"
2635,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"important plot, and in a compass far greater than is normal in ordinary"
2636,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life, the portrayal leads us better to bear and more justly to estimate"
2637,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the petty trials, the vexations, the insignificant experiences of our"
2638,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"career; we see our lives in a truer relation to life in general, and"
2639,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"avoid an overcharged feeling in regard to our private fortune. And,"
2640,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"secondly, the subjective emotion in ourselves is educative in the point"
2641,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that by this outlet we go out of ourselves in sympathy, lose our egoism,"
2642,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and become one with man in general. This is an escape; but not such as
2643,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"has been previously spoken of, for it is not a retreat. There is no"
2644,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"escape for us, except into the lives of others. In nature it is still"
2645,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,our own face we see; and before the ideal creations of art we are still
2646,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"aware, for all our contemplation, of the ineffable yearning of the"
2647,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thwarted soul, of the tender melancholy, the sadness in all beauty,"
2648,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the measure of our separation therefrom, and is fundamental in"
2649,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the poetic temperament. This is that pain, which Plato speaks of--the"
2650,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,pain of the growing of the wings of the spirit as they unfold. But in
2651,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passing into the lives of other men, in sharing their joys, in taking on"
2652,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ourselves the burden of humanity, we escape from our self-prison, we"
2653,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"leave individuality behind, we unite with man in common; so we die to"
2654,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ourselves in order to live in lives not ours. In literature, sympathy"
2655,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and that imagination by which we enter into and comprehend other lives
2656,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"are most trained and developed, made habitual, instinctive, and quick."
2657,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"It begins to appear, I trust, that ideal art is not only one with our"
2658,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature intellectually, but in all ways; it is the path of the spirit in"
2659,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all things. Moreover, emotion is in itself simple; it does not need"
2660,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"generalization, it is the same in all. It is rather a means of"
2661,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"universalizing the refinements of the intellect, the substantive"
2662,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"idealities of imagination, by enveloping them in an elementary,"
2663,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"primitive feeling which they call forth. Poetry, therefore, especially"
2664,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"deals, as Wordsworth pointed out, in the primary affections, the"
2665,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"elementary passions of mankind; and, whatever be its intellectual"
2666,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contents of nature or human events, calls these emotions forth as the"
2667,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,master-spirit of all our seeing. Emotion is more fundamental in us than
2668,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,knowledge; it is more powerful in its working; it underlies more
2669,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"deliberate and conscious life in the mind, and in most of us it rules,"
2670,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as it influences in all. It is natural, therefore, to find that its"
2671,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,operation in art is of graver importance than that of the intellectual
2672,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,faculty so far as the broad power of art over men is concerned.
2673,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2674,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Another special point arises from the fact that some emotions are
2675,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"painful, and the question is raised how in literature painful emotions"
2676,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,become a pleasure. Aristotle's doctrine in respect to certain of these
2677,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"emotions, tragic pity and terror, is well known, though variously"
2678,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"interpreted. He regards such emotions as a discharge of energy, an"
2679,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"exhaustion and a relief, in consequence of which their disturbing"
2680,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,presence is less likely to recur in actual life; it is as if emotional
2681,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"energy accumulated, as vital force is stored up and requires to be"
2682,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"loosed in bodily exercise; but this, except in the point that pity and"
2683,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"terror, if they do accumulate in their particular forms latently, are"
2684,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"specifically such as it is wise to be rid of, does not differentiate"
2685,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,emotion from the rest of our powers in all of which there is a similar
2686,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pleasure in exercising, an exhaustion and a relief, with less liability"
2687,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of immediate recurrence; this belongs to all expenditure of life. It is
2688,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"not credible to me that painful emotion, under the illusions of art, can"
2689,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,become pleasurable in the common sense; what pleasure there is arises
2690,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only in the climax and issue of the action, as in case of the drama when"
2691,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the restoration of the order that is joyful, beautiful, right, and wise"
2692,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"occurs; in other words, in the presence of the final poetic justice or"
2693,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reconciliation of the disturbed elements of life. But here we come upon
2694,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"darker and mysterious aspects of our general subject, now to be slightly"
2695,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,touched. Tragedy dealing with the discords of life must present painful
2696,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spectacles; and is saved to art only by its just ending. Comedy, which"
2697,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"similarly deals with discords, is endurable only while these remain"
2698,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"painless. Both imply a defect in order, and neither would have any place"
2699,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in a perfect world, which would be without pity, fear, or humour, all of"
2700,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which proceed from incongruities in the scheme. Tragedy and comedy
2701,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"belong alike to low civilizations, to wicked, brutal, or ridiculous"
2702,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"types of character and disorderly events, to the confusion, ignorance,"
2703,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and ignominies of mankind; the refinement of both is a mark of progress
2704,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in both art and civilization, and foretells their own extinction, unless"
2705,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,indeed the principle of evil be more deeply implanted in the universe
2706,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"than we fondly hope; pathos and humour, which are the milder and the"
2707,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"kindlier forms of tragedy and comedy, must also cease, for both are"
2708,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,equally near to tears. But before leaving this subject it is interesting
2709,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to observe how in the Aristotelian scheme of tragedy, where it was"
2710,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"little thought of, the appeal is made to man's whole nature as here"
2711,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"outlined--the plot replying to reason, the scene to the sense of beauty,"
2712,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the katharsis to the emotions, and poetic justice to the will, which"
2713,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,thus finds its model and exemplar in the supremacy of the moral law in
2714,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,all tragic art.
2715,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2716,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"This, then, being the nature of the ideal world in its whole range"
2717,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"commensurate with our being, and these the methods of its intellectual"
2718,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and emotional appeal, it remains to examine the world of art in itself,"
2719,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and especially its genesis out of life. The method by which it is built
2720,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"up has long been recognized to be that of imitation of the actual, as"
2721,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,has been assumed hitherto in the statement that all art is concrete. But
2722,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the concrete which art creates is not a copy of the concrete of life;
2723,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it is more than this. The mind takes the particulars of the world of
2724,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sense into itself, generalizes them, and frames therefrom a new"
2725,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"particular, which does not exist in nature; it is, in fact, nature made"
2726,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"perfect in an imagined instance, and so presented to the mind's eye, or"
2727,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to the eye of sense. The pleasure which imitation gives has been often
2728,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and diversely analyzed; it may be that of recognition, or that of new"
2729,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge satisfying our curiosity as if the original were present, or"
2730,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that of delight in the skill of the artist, or that of interest in"
2731,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"seeing how his view differs from our own, or that of the illusion"
2732,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,created for us; but all these modes of pleasure exist when the imitation
2733,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is an exact copy of the original, and they do not characterize the"
2734,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,artistic imitation in any way to differentiate its peculiar pleasure. It
2735,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is that element which artistic imitation adds to actuality, the"
2736,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difference between its created concrete and the original out of which
2737,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that was developed, which gives the special delight of art to the mind."
2738,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"It is the perfection of the type, the intensity of the emotion, the"
2739,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inevitability of the plot,--it is the pure and intelligible form"
2740,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"disclosed in the phases and movement of life, disengaged and set apart"
2741,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for the contemplation of the mind,--it is the purging of the sensual"
2742,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eye, enabling it to see through the mind as the mind first saw through"
2743,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it, which renders the world of art the new vision it is, the revelation"
2744,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,accomplished by the mind for the senses. If the world of art were only a
2745,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reduplication of life, it would give only the pleasures that have been"
2746,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,mentioned; but its true pleasure is that which it yields from its
2747,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"supersensual element, the reason which has entered into it with ordering"
2748,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,power. In the world thus created there will remain the imperfections
2749,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which are due to the limitation of the artist, in knowledge, skill, and"
2750,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,choice.
2751,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2752,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It will be said at once that all these concrete representations
2753,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"necessarily fail to realize the artist's thought, and are inadequate,"
2754,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inferior in exactness, to scientific and philosophic knowledge; in a"
2755,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"measure this is true, and would be important if the method of art were"
2756,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"demonstrative, instead of being, as has been said, experimental and"
2757,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inductive. So, too, all thinkers, using the actual world in their"
2758,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"processes, are at a disadvantage. The figures of the geometer, the"
2759,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"quantities of the chemist, the measurements of the astronomer, are"
2760,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inexact approximations to their equivalent in the mind. Art, as an"
2761,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"embodiment in mortal images, is subject to the conditions of mortality."
2762,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Hence arises its human history, the narrative of its rise, climax, and"
2763,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,decline in successive ages. The course of art is known; it has been run
2764,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"many times; it is a simple matter. At first art is archaic, the sensible"
2765,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"form being rudely controlled by the artist's hand; it becomes, in the"
2766,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"second stage, classical, the form being adequate to the thought, a"
2767,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"transparent expression; last, it is decadent, the form being more than"
2768,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the thought, dwarfing it by usurping attention on its own account. The"
2769,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,peculiar temptation of technique is always to elaboration of detail;
2770,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"technique is at first a hope, it becomes a power, it ends in being a"
2771,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,caprice; and always as it goes on it loses sight of the general in its
2772,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rendering, and dwells with a near eye on the specific. Nor is this"
2773,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,attention to detail confined to the manner; the hand of the artist draws
2774,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind after it, and it is no longer the great types of manhood, the"
2775,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"important fates of life, the primary emotions in their normal course,"
2776,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that are in the foreground of thought, but the individual is more and"
2777,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"more, the sensational in plot, the sentimental in feeling. This"
2778,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tendency to detail, which is the hallmark of realism, constitutes"
2779,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"decline. It arises partly from the exhaustion of general ideas, from the"
2780,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"search for novelty of subject and sensation, from the special phenomena"
2781,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of a decaying society; but, however manifold may be the causes, the fact"
2782,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of decline consists in the lessened scope of the matter and the
2783,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"increased importance of the form, both resulting in luxuriant detail."
2784,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Ideas as they lose generality gain in intensity, but in the history of"
2785,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,art this has not proved a compensation. In Greece the three stages are
2786,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"clearly marked both in matter and manner, in Aeschylus, Sophocles, and"
2787,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Euripides; in England less clearly in Marlowe, Shakspere, and Webster."
2788,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,How monstrous in the latter did tragedy necessarily become! yet more
2789,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"repulsive in his tenderer companion-spirit, Ford. In Greek sculpture,"
2790,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,passing into convulsed and muscular forms or forms of relaxed
2791,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"voluptuousness, in Italian painting, in the romantic poetry of this"
2792,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"century with us, the same stages are manifest. Age parallels age."
2793,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Tennyson in artistic technique is Virgilian, we are aware of the style;"
2794,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"but both Virgil and Tennyson remain classic in matter, in universality,"
2795,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and the elemental in man. Browning in substance is Euripidean, being"
2796,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"individualistic, psychologic, problematic, with special pleading;"
2797,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"classicism had departed from him, and left not even the style behind."
2798,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The great opposition lies in the subject of interest. Is it to know
2799,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ourselves in others? Then art which is widely interpretative of the
2800,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,common nature of man results. Is it to know others as different from
2801,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ourselves? Then art which is specially interpretative of abnormal
2802,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,individuals in extraordinary environments results. This is the
2803,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"opposition between realism and idealism, while both remain in the limits"
2804,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of art, as these terms are commonly used. It belongs to realism to tend"
2805,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to the concrete of narrow application, but with fulness of special trait"
2806,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,or detail. It belongs to idealism to tend to the concrete of broad
2807,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"application, but without peculiarity. The trivial on the one hand, the"
2808,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"criminal on the other, in the individual, are the extremes of realistic"
2809,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art, while idealism rises to an almost superhuman emphasis on that"
2810,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wisdom and virtue, and the beauty clothing them, which are the goal of a"
2811,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nation's effort. Race-ideas, or generalizations of a compact and"
2812,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"homogeneous people summing up their serious interpretations of life,"
2813,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their moral choices, their aspiration and hope in the lines of effort"
2814,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that seem to them highest, are the necessary matter of idealism; when"
2815,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"these are expressed they are the Greek spirit, the Roman genius, great"
2816,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"types of humanity on the impersonal, the national scale. As these"
2817,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"historic generalizations dissolve in national decay, art breaks up in"
2818,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,individual portrayal of less embracing types; the glorification of the
2819,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Greek man in Achilles yields place to the corruptions of the homunculus;
2820,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and in general the literature of nationality gives way to the unmeaning
2821,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and transitory literature of a society interested in its vices,"
2822,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"superstitions, and sensations. In each age some genius stands at the"
2823,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"centre of its expression, a shining nucleus amid its planetary stars;"
2824,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"such was Dante, such Virgil, such Shakspere. Few indeed are the races"
2825,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that present the spectacle of a double-sun in their history, as the"
2826,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Hebrews in Psalm and Gospel, the Greeks in Homer and in Plato. And yet,"
2827,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all this enormous range of life and death, this flowering in centuries"
2828,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the human spirit in its successive creations, reposes finally on the"
2829,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"more or less general nature of the concretes used in its art, on their"
2830,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"broad or narrow truth, on their human or individualistic significance."
2831,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The difference between idealism and realism is not more than a question
2832,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which to choose. At the further end and last remove, when all art has"
2833,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"been resolved into a sensation, an effect, lies impressionism, which, by"
2834,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its nature, is a single phase at a single moment as seen by a single"
2835,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"being; but even then, if the mind be normal, if the phase be veritable,"
2836,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"if the moment be that of universal beauty which Faust bade be eternal,"
2837,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the artistic work remains ideal; but on the other hand, it is usually"
2838,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the eccentric mind, the abnormal phase, the beauty of morbid sensation"
2839,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that are rendered; and impressionism becomes, as a term, the"
2840,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,vanishing-point of realism into the moment of sense.
2841,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2842,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The world of art, to reach its last limitation, through all this wide"
2843,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,range is in each creation passed through the mind of the artist and
2844,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,presented necessarily under all the conditions of his personality. His
2845,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature is a term in the process, and the question of imperfection or of"
2846,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"error, known as the personal equation, arises. Individual differences of"
2847,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"perceptive power in comprehending what is seen, and of narrative skill,"
2848,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"or in the plastic and pictorial arts of manual dexterity, import this"
2849,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personal element into all artistic works, the more in proportion to the"
2850,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,originality of the maker and the fulness of his self-expression. In
2851,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rendering from the actual such error is unavoidable, and is practically"
2852,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,admitted by all who would rather see for themselves than take the
2853,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"account of a witness, and prefer the original to any copy of it, though"
2854,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,they thereby only substitute their own error for that of the artist.
2855,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"This personal error, however, is easily corrected by the consensus of"
2856,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,human nature.
2857,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2858,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The differences in personality go far deeper than this common liability
2859,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of humanity to mere mistakes in sight and in representation. The
2860,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,isolating force that creates a solitude round every man lies in his
2861,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"private experience, and results from his original faculties and the"
2862,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"special conditions of his environment, his acquired habits of attending"
2863,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to some things rather than others open to him, the choices he has made"
2864,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,in the past by which his view of the world and his interest in it have
2865,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"been determined. Memory, the mother of the Muses, is supreme here; a"
2866,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"man's memory, which is the treasury of his chosen delights in life,"
2867,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"characterizes him, and differentiates his work from that of others,"
2868,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,because he must draw on that store for his materials. Thus a man's
2869,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"character, or, what is more profound, his temperament, acting in"
2870,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conjunction with the memory it has built up for itself, is a controlling"
2871,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"force in artistic work, and modifies it in the sense that it presents"
2872,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the universal truth only as it exists in his personality, in his"
2873,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,apprehension of it and its meaning.
2874,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2875,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Genius is this power of personality, and exists in proportion as the man"
2876,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,differs from the average in ways that find significant expression. This
2877,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difference may proceed along two lines. It may be aberration from normal
2878,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"human nature, due to circumstances or to inherent defect or to a"
2879,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thousand causes, but existing always in the form of an inward perversion"
2880,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,approaching disease of our nature; such types of genius are pathological
2881,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and may be neglected. It may, on the other hand, be development of"
2882,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"normal human nature in high power, and it then exists in the form of"
2883,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inward energy, showing itself in great sensitiveness to outward things,"
2884,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in mental power of comprehension, in creative force of recombination"
2885,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and expression. Of genius of this last sort the leaders of the human
2886,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spirit are made. The basis of it is still, human faculty dealing with"
2887,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the universe--the same faculty, the same universe, that are common to"
2888,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mankind; but with an extraordinary power, such that it can reveal to men"
2889,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"at large what they of themselves might never have arrived at, can"
2890,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"advance knowledge and show forth goals of human hope, can in a word"
2891,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"guide the race. The isolation of such a nature is necessarily profound,"
2892,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and intense loneliness has ever been a characteristic of genius. The
2893,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"solvent of all personality, however, lies at last in this fact of a"
2894,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"common world and a common faculty for all, resulting in an experience"
2895,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligible to all, even if unshared by them. The humanity of genius"
2896,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"constitutes its sanity, and is the ground of its usefulness; though it"
2897,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"lives in isolation, it does so only as an advanced outpost may; it"
2898,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"expects the advent of the race behind and below it, and shows there its"
2899,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,signal and sounds there its call. Its escape from personality lies in
2900,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its identifying itself with the common order in which all souls shall
2901,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,finally be merged and be at one. The limitations of genius are
2902,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,consequently not so much limitations as the abrogation of limits in the
2903,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ordinary sense; its originality of insight, interpretation, and"
2904,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,expression broadens the human horizons and enriches the fields within
2905,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"them; it tells us what we may not have known or felt or guessed, but"
2906,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what we shall at last understand. Thus, as the theory of art is most"
2907,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fixed in the doctrine of order, so here it is most flexible in the"
2908,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"doctrine of personality, through which that order is most variously set"
2909,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"forth and illustrated. Imitation, so far from becoming a defective or"
2910,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"false method because of personality, is really made catholic by it, and"
2911,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,gains the variety and breadth that characterizes the artistic world as a
2912,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whole.
2913,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2914,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The element of self which thus enters into every artistic work has
2915,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"different degrees of importance. In objective art, it is clear that it"
2916,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,enters valuably in proportion as the universe is seized by a mind of
2917,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"right reason, of profound penetration, of truthful imagination; and if"
2918,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the work be presented enveloped in a subjective mood, while it remains"
2919,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"objective in contents, as in Virgil the mood pervades the poem so deeply"
2920,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as to be a main part of it, then the mood must be one of those felt or"
2921,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"capable of being felt universally,--the profound moods of the meditative"
2922,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spirit in grand works, the common moods of simple joy and sorrow in less"
2923,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"serious works. In proportion as society develops, whether in historic"
2924,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"states singly or in the progress of mankind, the direct expression of"
2925,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,self for its own sake becomes more usual; literature becomes more
2926,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,personal or purely subjective. If the poet's private story be one of
2927,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"action, it is plain that it has interest only as if it were objectively"
2928,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rendered, from its being illustrative of life in general; so, too, if"
2929,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the felt emotion be given, this will have value from its being treated"
2930,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as typical; and, in so far as the intimate nature of the poet is"
2931,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"variously given as a whole in his entire works, it has real importance,"
2932,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"has its justification in art, only in so far as he himself is a high"
2933,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"normal type of humanity. The truth of the matter is, in fact, only a"
2934,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,detail of the general proposition that in art history has no value of
2935,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its own as such; for the poet is a part of life that is, and his nature"
2936,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and career, like that of any character or event in history, have no"
2937,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,artistic value beyond their universal significance. In such
2938,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,self-portraiture there may be sometimes the depicting of a depraved
2939,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature, such as Villon; but such a type takes its place with other"
2940,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"criminal types of the imagination, and belongs with them in another"
2941,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,sphere.
2942,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2943,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,This element of self finds its intense expression in lyrical
2944,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"love-poetry, one of the most enduring forms of literature because of its"
2945,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,elementariness and universality; but it is also found in other parts of
2946,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the emotional field. In seeking concrete material for lyrical use the
2947,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"poet may take some autobiographical incident, but commonly the world of"
2948,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,inanimate nature yields the most plastic mould. It is a marvellous
2949,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,victory of the spirit over matter when it takes the stars of heaven and
2950,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the flowers of earth and makes them utter forth its speech, less as it"
2951,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,seems in words of human language than in the pictured hieroglyph and
2952,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,symphonic movement of natural things; for in such poetry it is not the
2953,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"vision of nature, however beautiful, that holds attention; it is the"
2954,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"colour, form, and music of things externalizing, visualizing the inward"
2955,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mood, emotion, or passion of the singer. Nature is emptied of her"
2956,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,contents to become the pure inhabitancy of one human soul. The poet's
2957,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"method is that of life itself, which is first awakened by the beauty"
2958,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,without to thought and feeling; he expresses the state evoked by that
2959,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,beauty and absorbing it. He identifies himself with the objects before
2960,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"him through his joy in them, and entering there makes nature translucent"
2961,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,with his own spirit.
2962,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2963,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Shelley's Ode to the West Wind is the eminent example of such magical
2964,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"power. The three vast elements, earth, air, and water, are first brought"
2965,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"into a union through their connection with the west wind; and, the wind"
2966,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"still being the controlling centre of imagination, the poet, drawing all"
2967,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this limitless and majestic imagery with him, by gradual and spontaneous"
2968,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,approaches identifies himself at the climax of feeling with the object
2969,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of his invocation,--"
2970,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2971,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""Be thou me, impetuous one!"""
2972,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2973,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and thence the poem swiftly falls to its end in a lyric burst of
2974,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personality, in which, while the body of nature is retained, there is"
2975,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"only a spiritual meaning. So Burns in some songs, and Keats in some"
2976,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"odes, following the same method, make nature their own syllables, as of"
2977,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,some cosmic language. This is the highest reach of the artist's power
2978,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of conveying through the concrete image the soul in its pure emotional
2979,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,life; and in such poetry one feels that the whole material world seems
2980,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,lent to man to expand his nature and escape from the solitude in which
2981,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,he is born to that divine union to which he is destined. The evolution
2982,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of this one moment of passion is lyric form, whose unity lies in"
2983,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personality exclusively, however it may seem to involve the external"
2984,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world which is its imagery,--its body lifted from the dust, woven of"
2985,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"light and air, but alive only while the spirit abides there. And here,"
2986,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"too, as elsewhere, to whatever height the poet may rise, it must be one"
2987,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to which man can follow, to which, indeed, the poet lifts men. Nor is it"
2988,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,only nature which thus suffers spiritualization through the stress of
2989,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imagination interpreting life in definite and sensible forms of beauty,"
2990,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"but the imagery of action also may be similarly taken possession of,"
2991,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,though this is rare in merely lyrical expression.
2992,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
2993,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The ideal world, then, to present in full summary these views, is thus"
2994,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"built up, through personality in all its richness, by a perfected"
2995,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imitation of life itself, and is set forth in universal unities of"
2996,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"relation, causal or formal, to the intellect in its inward, to the sense"
2997,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of beauty in its outward, aspects; and thereby delighting the desire of"
2998,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the mind for lucid and lovely order, it generates joy, and thence is"
2999,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"born the will to conform one's self to this order. If, then, this order"
3000,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,be conceived as known in its principles and in operation in living
3001,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"souls, as existing in its completeness on the simplest scale in an"
3002,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"entire series of illustrative instances but without multiplicity,--if it"
3003,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"be conceived, that is, as the model of a world,--that would be to know"
3004,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it as it exists to the mind of God; that would be to contemplate the
3005,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,world of ideas as Plato conceived it seen by the soul before birth. That
3006,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is the beatific vision. If it be conceived in its mortal movement as a
3007,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"developing world on earth, that would be to know ""the plot of God,"" as"
3008,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Poe called the universe. Art endeavours to bring that vision, that plot,"
3009,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"however fragmentary, upon earth. It is a world of order clothing itself"
3010,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in beauty, with a charm to the soul, such is our nature,--operative upon"
3011,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the will to live. It is preeminently a vision of beauty. It is true that
3012,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,this beauty which thus wins and moves us seems something added by the
3013,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,mind in its great creations rather than anything actual in life; for it
3014,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is, in fact, heightened and refined from the best that man has seen in"
3015,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"himself, and it partakes more of hope than of memory. Here is that woven"
3016,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,robe of illusion which is so hard a matter to those who live in horizons
3017,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the eye and hand. Yet as idealism was found on its mental side
3018,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"harmonious with reason in all knowledge, and on its emotional side"
3019,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"harmonious with the heart in its outgoings, so this perfecting"
3020,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"temperament that belongs to it and most characterizes it, falls in with"
3021,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the natural faith of mankind. Idealism in this sense, too, existed in"
3022,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,life before it passed into literature. The youth idealizes the maiden he
3023,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"loves, his hero, and the ends of his life; and in age the old man"
3024,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,idealizes his youth. Who does not remember some awakening moment when he
3025,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,first saw virtue and knew her for what she is? Sweet was it then to
3026,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"learn of some Jason of the golden fleece, some Lancelot of the tourney,"
3027,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,some dying Sydney of the stricken field. There was a poignancy in this
3028,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,early knowledge that shall never be felt again; but who knows not that
3029,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,such enthusiasm which earliest exercised the young heart in noble
3030,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,feelings is the source of most of good that abides in us as years go on?
3031,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"In such boyish dreaming the soul learns to do and dare, hardens and"
3032,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"supples itself, and puts on youthful beauty; for here is its palaestra."
3033,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Who would blot these from his memory? who choke these fountain-heads,"
3034,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,remembering how often along life's pathway he has thirsted for them?
3035,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Such moments, too, have something singular in their nature, and almost"
3036,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"immortal, that carries them echoing far on into life where they strike"
3037,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,upon us in manhood at chosen moments when least expected; some of them
3038,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,are the real time in which we live. It was said of old that great men
3039,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"were creative in their souls, and left their works to be their race;"
3040,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"these ideal heroes have immortal souls for their children, age after"
3041,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"age. Shall we in our youth, then, in generous emulation idealize the"
3042,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"great of old times, and honour them as our fair example of what we most"
3043,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"would be? Shall we, in our hearts, idealize those we love,--so natural"
3044,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is it to believe in the perfection of those we love,--and even if the"
3045,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"time for forgiveness comes, and we show them the mercy that our own"
3046,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"frailty teaches us to exercise, shall we still idealize them, since love"
3047,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"continues only in the persuasion of perfection yet to come, and is the"
3048,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,tenderer because it comes with struggle? Whether in our acts or our
3049,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"emotions shall we give idealism this range, and deny it to literature"
3050,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which discloses the habits of our daily practice in more perfection and
3051,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,with greater beauty? There we find the purest types to raise and sustain
3052,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"us; to direct our choice, and reenforce us with that emotion, that"
3053,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passion, which most supports the will in its effort. There history"
3054,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"itself is taken up, transformed, and made immortal, the whole past of"
3055,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,human emotion and action contained and shown forth with convincing
3056,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,power. Nor is it only with the natural habit of mankind that idealism
3057,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"falls in, but with divine command. Were we not bid be perfect as our"
3058,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Father in heaven is perfect? And what is that image of the Christ, what"
3059,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is that world-ideal, the height of human thought, but the work of the"
3060,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"creative reason,--not of genius, not of the great in mind and fortunate"
3061,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in gifts, but of the race itself, in proud and humble, in saint and"
3062,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sinner, in the happy and the wretched, in all the vast range of the"
3063,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,millions of the dead whose thoughts live embodied in that great
3064,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tradition,--the supreme and perfected pattern of mankind?"
3065,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3066,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Is it nevertheless true that there is falsehood in all this? that men
3067,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"were never such as the heart believes them, nor ideal characters able to"
3068,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"breathe mortal air? by indulging our emotions, do we deceive ourselves,"
3069,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and end at last in cynicism or despair? Why, then, should we not boldly"
3070,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"affirm that the falsehood is rather in us, in the defects by which we"
3071,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fail of perfection, in our ignorant error and voluntary wrong? that in"
3072,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the ideal, free as it is from the accidental and the transitory,"
3073,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inclusive as it is of the common truth, lies, as Plato thought, the only"
3074,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reality, the truth which outlasts us all? But this may seem a subtle"
3075,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,evasion rather than a frank answer. Let us rather say that idealism is
3076,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"one of the necessary modes of man's faith, brings in the future, and"
3077,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,assumes the reality of that which shall be actual; that the reality it
3078,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"owns is that of the rose in the bud, the oak in the acorn, the planet in"
3079,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its fiery mist. I believe that ideal character in its perfection is
3080,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,potentially in every man who is born into the world. We forecast the
3081,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,future in other parts of life; why should we not forecast ourselves?
3082,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Would he not be thought foolish who should refuse to embark in great
3083,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"enterprises of trade, because he does not already hold the wealth to be"
3084,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"gained? The ideal is our infinite riches, more than any individual or"
3085,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,moment can hold. To refuse it is as if a man should neglect his estate
3086,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,because he can take but a handful of it in his grasp. It is the law of
3087,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our being to grow, and it is a necessity that we should have examples"
3088,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and patterns in advance of us, by which we can find our way. There is no"
3089,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,falsehood in such anticipation; there is only a faith in truth instead
3090,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of a possession of it. Will you limit us to one moment of time and
3091,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,place? will you say to the patriot that his country is a geographical
3092,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"term? and when he replies that rather is it the life of her sons, will"
3093,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"you point him to human nature as it seems at the period, to corruption,"
3094,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"folly, ignorance, strife, and crime, and tell him that is our actual"
3095,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"America? Will he not rather say that his America is a great past, a"
3096,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,future whose beneficence no man can sum? Is there any falsehood in this
3097,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ideal country that men have ever held precious? Did Pericles lie in his
3098,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"great oration, and Virgil in his noble poem, and Dante in his fervid"
3099,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Italian lines? And as there are ideals of country, so also of men, of"
3100,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the soldier, the priest, the king, the lover, the citizen, and beside"
3101,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"each of us does there not go one who mourns over our fall and pities us,"
3102,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"gladdens in our virtue, and shall not leave us till we die; an ideal"
3103,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"self, who is our judgment? and if it be yet answered that this in truth"
3104,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is so, and might be borne but for the errors of the idealizing"
3105,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"temperament, shall we not reply that the quack does not discredit the"
3106,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art of medicine, nor the demagogue the art of politics, and no more does"
3107,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the fool in all his motley the art of literature.
3108,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3109,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Must I, however, come back to my answer, and meet those who aver that"
3110,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"however stimulating idealism is to the soul, yet it must be remembered"
3111,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that in the world at large there is nothing corresponding to ideal
3112,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"order, to poetic ethics, and that to act these forth as the supremacy of"
3113,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"what ought to be is to misrepresent life, to raise expectations in youth"
3114,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"never to be realized, to pervert practical standards, and in brief to"
3115,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"make a false start that can be fruitful only in error, in subsequent"
3116,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"suffering of mind, and with material disadvantage? I must be frank: I"
3117,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"own that I can perceive in Nature no moral order, that in her world"
3118,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"there is no knowledge of us or of our ideals, and that in general her"
3119,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"order often breaks upon man's life with mere ruin, irrational and"
3120,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pitiful; and I acknowledge, also, the prominence of evil in the social,"
3121,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and its invasion in the individual, life of man. But, again, were we so"
3122,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,situated that there should be no external divine order apparent to our
3123,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"minds, were justice an accident and mercy the illusion of wasted prayer,"
3124,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,there would still remain in us that order whose workings are known
3125,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"within our own bosom, that law which compels us to be just and merciful"
3126,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in order to lead the life that we recognize to be best, and the whole"
3127,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imperative of our ideal, which, if we fail to ourselves, condemns us,"
3128,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,irrespective of what future attends us in the world. Ideal order as the
3129,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mind knows it, the mind must strive to realize, or stand dishonoured in"
3130,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its own forum. Within us, at least, it exists in hope and somewhat in"
3131,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reality, and following it in our effort, though we come merely to a"
3132,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"stoical idea of the just man on whom the heavens fall, we should yet be"
3133,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,nobler than the power that made us souls betrayed. But there is no such
3134,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difference between the world as it is and the world as ideal art
3135,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,presents it.
3136,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3137,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"What, then, is the difference between art and nature? Art is nature"
3138,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"regenerate, made perfect, suffering the new birth into what ought to be;"
3139,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,an ordered and complete world. But this is the vision of art as the
3140,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ultimate of good. Idealism has also another world, of which glimpses"
3141,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"have already appeared in the course of this argument, though in the"
3142,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,background. In the intellectual sphere evil is as subject to general
3143,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"statement as is good, and there is in the strict sense an idealization"
3144,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of evil, a universal statement of it, as in Mephistopheles, or in more"
3145,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"partial ways in Iago, Macbeth, Richard III. In the emotional sphere also"
3146,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"there is the throb of evil, felt as diabolic energy and presented as the"
3147,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,element in which these characters have their being. Even in the sphere
3148,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the will, who shall say that man does not knowingly choose evil as"
3149,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"his portion? So, too, as the method of idealism in the world of the good"
3150,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tends to erect man above himself, the same generalizing method in the"
3151,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,world of the evil tends to degrade human nature below itself; the
3152,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,extremes of the process are the divine and the devilish; both transcend
3153,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life, but are developed out of it. The difference between these two"
3154,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"poles of ideality is that the order of one is an order of life, that of"
3155,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the other an order of death. Between these two is the special province
3156,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the human will. What literature, what all art, presents is not the"
3157,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ultimate of good or the ultimate of evil separately; it is, taking into"
3158,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"account the whole range, the mixed world becoming what it ought to be in"
3159,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its evolution from what it is, and the laws of that progress. Hence"
3160,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tragedy on the one hand and comedy, or more broadly humour, on the other"
3161,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"hand, have their great place in literature; for they are forms of the"
3162,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,intermediate world of conflict. I speak of the spiritual world of man's
3163,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,will. We may conceive of the world optimistically as a place in which
3164,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all shall issue in good and nothing be lost; or as a place in which, by"
3165,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"alliance with or revolt from the forces of life, the will in its"
3166,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,voluntary and individual action may save or lose the soul at its choice.
3167,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"We may think of God as conserving all, or as permitting hell, which is"
3168,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"death. We do not know. But as shown to us in imagination, idealism,"
3169,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the race's dream of truth, hovers between these two worlds"
3170,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"known to us in tendency if not in conclusion,--the world of salvation on"
3171,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the one hand, in proportion as the order of life is made vital in us,"
3172,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the world of damnation on the other hand, in proportion as the order of"
3173,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,death prevails in our will; but the main effort of idealism is to show
3174,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"us the war between the two, with an emphasis on the becoming of the"
3175,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reality of beauty, joy, reason, and virtue in us. Not that prosperity"
3176,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"follows righteousness, not that poverty attends wickedness, in worldly"
3177,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"measure, but that life is the gift of a right will is her message; how"
3178,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"we, striving for eternal life, may best meet the chances and the bitter"
3179,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fates of mortal existence, is her brooding care; ideal characters, or"
3180,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"those ideal in some trait or phase, in the midst of a hostile"
3181,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"environment, are her fixed study. So far is idealism from ignoring the"
3182,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,actual state of man that it most affirms its pity and evil by setting
3183,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"them in contrast with what ought to be, by showing virtue militant not"
3184,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,only against external enemies but those inward weaknesses of our
3185,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mortality with its passion and ignorance, which are our most undermining"
3186,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and intimate foes. Here is no false world, but just that world which is"
3187,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our theatre of action, that confused struggle, represented in its"
3188,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligible elements in art, that world of evil, implicit in us and the"
3189,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"universe, which must be overcome; and this is revealed to us in the ways"
3190,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"most profitable for our instruction, who are bound to seek to realize"
3191,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the good through all the strokes of nature and the folly and sin of men.
3192,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Ideal literature in its broad compass, between its opposed poles of good"
3193,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and evil, is just this: a world of order emerging from disorder, of"
3194,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beauty and wisdom, of virtue and joy, emerging from the chaos of things"
3195,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that are, in selected and typical examples."
3196,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3197,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It follows from this that what remains in the world of observation in
3198,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"personality or experience, whether good or evil, whether particular or"
3199,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"general, not yet coordinated in rational knowledge as a whole, all for"
3200,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which no solution is found, all that cannot be or has not been made"
3201,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligible, must be the subject-matter of realism in the exact use of"
3202,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that term. This must be recorded by literature, or admitted into it, as"
3203,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,matter-of-fact which is to the mind still a problem. Earthly mystery
3204,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,therefore is the special sphere of realism. The borderland of the
3205,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unknown or the irreducible is its realm. This old residuum, this new"
3206,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"material, is not yet capable of art. Hence, too, realism in this sense"
3207,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,characterizes ages of expansion of knowledge such as ours. The new
3208,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"information which is the fruit of our wide travel, of our research into"
3209,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the past, has enlarged the problem of man's life by showing us both"
3210,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,primitive and historical humanity in its changeful phases of progress
3211,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,working out the beast; and this new interest has been reenforced by the
3212,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"attention paid, under influences of democracy and philanthropy, to the"
3213,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"lower and baser forms of life in the masses under civilization, which"
3214,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,has been a new revelation of persistent savagery in our midst. Here
3215,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,realism illustrates its service as a gatherer of knowledge which may
3216,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"hereafter be reduced to orderliness by idealistic processes, for"
3217,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,idealism is the organizer of all knowledge. But apart from this incoming
3218,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of facts, or of laws not yet harmonized in the whole body of law, for"
3219,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which we may have fair hope that a synthesis will be found, there"
3220,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"remains forever that residuum of which I spoke, which has resisted the"
3221,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligence of man, age after age, from the first throb of feeling,"
3222,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the first ray of thought; that involuntary evil, that unmerited"
3223,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"suffering, that impotent pain,--the human debris of the social"
3224,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"process,--which is a challenge to the power of God, and a cry to the"
3225,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"heart of man that broods over it in vain, yet cannot choose but hear. In"
3226,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this region the near affinity of realism to pessimism, to atheism, is"
3227,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"plain enough; its necessary dealing with the base, the brutal, the"
3228,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"unredeemed, the hopeless darkness of the infamies of heredity, criminal"
3229,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"education, and successful malignity, eating into the being as well as"
3230,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"controlling the fortune of their victims, is manifest; and what answer"
3231,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,has ever been found to the interrogation they make? It is not merely
3232,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that particular facts are here irreconcilable; but laws themselves are
3233,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"discernible, types even not of narrow application, which have not been"
3234,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,brought into any relation with what I have named the divine order.
3235,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Millions of men in thousands of years are included in this holocaust of
3236,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"past time,--eras of savagery, Assyrian civilizations, Christian"
3237,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"butcheries, the Czar yet supreme, the Turk yet alive."
3238,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3239,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"And how is it at the other pole of mystery, where life rises into a"
3240,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,heavenly vision of eternities of love to come? There is no place for
3241,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"realism here, where observation ceases and our only human outlook is by"
3242,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,inference from principles and laws of the ideal world as known to us;
3243,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"yet what problems are we aware of? Must,--to take the special problem of"
3244,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art,--must the sensuous scheme of life persist, since of it warp and"
3245,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"woof are woven all our possibilities of communication, all our"
3246,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,capabilities of knowledge? it is our language and our memory alike. Must
3247,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"God be still thought of in the image of man, since only in terms of our"
3248,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"humanity can we conceive even divine things, whether in forms of mortal"
3249,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pleasure as the Greeks framed their deities, or in shapes of spiritual"
3250,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"bliss as Christians fashion saint, angel, and archangel? These are"
3251,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rather philosophical problems. But in art, as at the realistic end of"
3252,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the scale, we admit the portraiture, as a part of life, of the bestial,"
3253,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the cruel, the unforgiven, and feel it debasing, so must we at the"
3254,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,idealistic end admit the representation of the celestial after human
3255,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"models, and feel it, even in Milton and in Dante, minimizing. The"
3256,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mysticism of the borderland at its supreme is a hope; at its nadir, it"
3257,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is a fear. We do not know. But within the narrow range of the
3258,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligible and ordered world of art, which has been achieved by the"
3259,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,creative reason of civilized man in his brief centuries and along the
3260,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"narrow path from Jerusalem and Athens to the western world, we do know"
3261,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that for the normal man born into its circle of light the order of life
3262,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is within our reach, the order of death within reach of us. Shut within"
3263,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,these limits of the victory of our intellect and the upreaching of our
3264,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"desires and the warfare of our will, we assert in art our faith that the"
3265,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"divine order is victorious, that the righteous man is not forsaken, that"
3266,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the soul cannot suffer wrong either from others or from nature or from
3267,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"God,--that the evil principle cannot prevail. It is faith, springing"
3268,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,from our experience of the working of that order in us; it transcends
3269,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"knowledge, but it grows with knowledge; and ideal literature asserts"
3270,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this faith against nature and against man in all their deformity, as the"
3271,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,centre about which life revolves so far as it has become subject to
3272,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"rational knowledge, to beautiful embodiment, to joyful being, to the"
3273,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,will to live.
3274,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3275,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Can the faith of which idealism is the holder of the keys, the faith as"
3276,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nigh to the intellect as to the heart, to the senses as to the spirit,"
3277,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"exceed even this limit, and affirm that if man were perfect in knowledge"
3278,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and saw the universe as we believe God sees it, he would behold it as an"
3279,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"artistic whole even now? Would it be that beatific vision, revolving"
3280,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"like God's kaleidoscope, momentarily falling at each new arrangement"
3281,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"into the perfect unities of art? and is our world of art, our brief"
3282,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"model of such a world in single examples of its scheme, only a way of"
3283,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,limiting the field to the compass of human faculties that we may see
3284,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"within our capacities as God sees, and hence have such faith? Is art"
3285,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"after all a lower creation than nature, a concession to our frail"
3286,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,powers? Has idealism such optimistic reach as that? Or must we see the
3287,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"evil principle encamped here, confusing truth, deforming beauty,"
3288,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"depraving joy, deflecting the will, with wages of death for its victims,"
3289,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and the hell of final destruction spreading beneath its sway? so that
3290,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the world as it now is cannot be thought of as the will of God exercised
3291,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in Omnipotence, but a human opportunity of union with or separation from"
3292,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the ideal order in conflict with the order of death. I recall Newman's
3293,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"picture: ""To consider the world in its length and breadth, its various"
3294,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"history, the many races of men, their starts, their fortunes, their"
3295,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mutual alienation, their conflicts, and then their ways, habits,"
3296,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"governments, forms of worship; their enterprises, their aimless courses,"
3297,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their random achievements and acquirements, the impotent conclusion of"
3298,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"long-standing facts, the tokens so faint and broken of a superintending"
3299,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"design, the blind evolution of what turn out to be great powers or"
3300,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"truths, the progress of things, as if from unreasoning elements, not"
3301,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"toward final causes, the greatness and littleness of man, his"
3302,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"far-reaching aims, his short duration, the curtain hung over his"
3303,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"futurity, the disappointments of life, the defeat of good, the success"
3304,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of evil, physical pain, mental anguish, the prevalence and intensity of"
3305,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sin, the pervading idolatries, the corruptions, the dreary hopeless"
3306,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"irreligion, that condition of the whole race, so fearfully yet exactly"
3307,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"described in the Apostle's words, 'having no hope and without God in the"
3308,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world,'--all this is a vision to dizzy and appall; and inflicts upon the"
3309,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,mind the sense of a profound mystery which is absolutely beyond human
3310,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"solution."" In the face of such a world, even when partially made"
3311,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"intelligible in ideal art, dare we assert that fatalistic optimism which"
3312,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,would have it that the universe is in God's eyes a perfect world? I can
3313,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"find no warrant for it in ideal art, though thence the ineradicable"
3314,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,effort arises in us to win to that world in the conviction that it is
3315,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,not indifferent in the sight of heaven whether we live in the order of
3316,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life or that of death, in the faith that victory in us is a triumph of"
3317,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that order itself which increases and prevails in us, is a bringing of"
3318,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Christ's kingdom upon earth. Art rather becomes in our mind a function
3319,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the world's progress, and were its goal achieved would cease; for"
3320,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"life would then itself be one with art, one with the divine order. So"
3321,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,much of truth there is in Ruskin's statement that art made perfect
3322,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"denies progress and is its ultimate. But perfection in life, as ideal"
3323,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art presents it, it is a prophecy which enlists us as soldiers militant"
3324,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in its fulfilment. Its optimism is that of the issue, and may be that of"
3325,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the process; but it surely is not that of the state that now is in the
3326,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,world.
3327,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3328,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It thus appears more and more that art is educative; it is the race's
3329,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"foreknowledge of what may be, of the objects of effort and the methods"
3330,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of their attainment under mortal conditions. The difficulty of men in
3331,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"respect to it is the lax power they have to see in it the truth, as"
3332,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contradistinguished from the fact, the continuous reality of the things"
3333,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the mind in opposition to the accidental and partial reality of the
3334,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"things of actuality. They think of it as an imagined, instead of as the"
3335,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"real world, the model of that which is in the evolution of that which"
3336,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ought to be. In history the climaxes of art have always outrun human
3337,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"realization; its crests in Greece, Italy, and England are crests of the"
3338,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,never-attained; but they still make on in their mass to the yet rising
3339,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wave, which shall be of mankind universal, if, indeed, in the"
3340,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"cosmopolitan civilization which we hope for, the elements of the past,"
3341,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,yet surviving from the accomplishment of single famous cities and great
3342,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"empires, shall be blended in a world-ideal, expressing the spiritual"
3343,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,uplifting to God of the reconciled and unified nations of the earth.
3344,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3345,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,There remains but one last resort; for it will yet be urged that the
3346,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,impossibility of any scientific knowledge of the spiritual order is
3347,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,proved by the transience of the ideals of the past; one is displaced by
3348,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"another, there is no permanence in them. It is true that the concrete"
3349,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world, which must be employed by art, is one of sense, and necessarily"
3350,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"imports into the form of art its own mortality; it is, even in art, a"
3351,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thing that passes away. It is also true that the world of knowledge,"
3352,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the subject-matter of art, is in process of being known, and"
3353,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"necessarily imports into the contents of art its errors, its hypotheses,"
3354,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"its imperfections of every kind; it is a thing that grows more and more,"
3355,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and in growing sheds its outworn shells, its past body. Let us consider"
3356,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the form and the contents separately. The element of mortality in the
3357,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,form is included in the transience of imagery. The poet uses the world
3358,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as he knows it, and reflects in successive ages of literature the"
3359,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"changing phases of civilization. The shepherd, the tiller of the soil,"
3360,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the warrior, the trader yield to him their language of the earth, the"
3361,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"battle, and the sea; from the common altar he learns the speech of the"
3362,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"gods; the elemental aspects of nature, the pursuits of men, and what is"
3363,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,believed of the supernatural are the great storehouses of imagery. The
3364,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fact that it is at first a living act or habit that the poet deals with,"
3365,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"gives to his work that original vivacity, that direct sense of"
3366,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"actuality, of contemporaneousness, which characterizes early"
3367,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"literatures, as in Homer or the Song of Roland: even the marvellous has"
3368,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in them the reality of being believed. This imagery, however, grows"
3369,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,remote with the course of time; it becomes capable of holding an inward
3370,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,meaning without resistance from too high a feeling of actuality; it
3371,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,becomes spiritualized. The process is the same already illustrated in
3372,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,lyric form as an expression of personality; but here man universal
3373,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,enters into the image and possesses it impersonally on the broad human
3374,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"scale. The pastoral life, for example, then yields the forms of art"
3375,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which hold either the simple innocence of happy earthly love, as in"
3376,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Daphnis and Chloe, or the natural grief of elegy made beautiful, as in"
3377,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Bion's dirge, or the shepherding of Christ in his church on earth, as in"
3378,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,many an English poet; the imagery has unclothed itself of actuality and
3379,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,shows a purely spiritual body.
3380,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3381,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,This growing inwardness of art is a main feature of literary history. It
3382,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is illustrated on the grand scale by the imagery of war. In the
3383,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beginning war for its own sake, mere fighting, is the subject; then war"
3384,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"for a cause, which ennobles it beyond the power of personal prowess and"
3385,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"justifies it as an element in national life; next, war for love, which"
3386,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,refines it and builds the paradox of the deeds of hate serving the will
3387,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of courtesy; last, war for the soul's salvation, which is unseen battle"
3388,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"within the breast. Achilles, Aeneas, Lancelot, the Red Cross Knight are"
3389,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the terms in this series; they mark the transformation of the most
3390,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,savage act of man into the symbol of his highest spiritual effort.
3391,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Nature herself is subject to this inwardness of art; at first merely
3392,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"objective as a condition, and usually a hostile, or at least dangerous,"
3393,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"condition of human life, she becomes the witness to omnipotent power in"
3394,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"illimitable beauty and majesty, its infinite unknowableness, and its"
3395,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"tender care for all creatures, as in the Scriptures; and at last the"
3396,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"words of our Lord concentrate, in some simple flower, the profoundest of"
3397,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"moral truths,--that the beauty of the soul is the gift of God, out of"
3398,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"whose eternal law it blossoms and has therein its ever living roots, its"
3399,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"air and light, its inherent grace and sweetness: ""Consider the lilies of"
3400,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I"
3401,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
3402,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"one of these. Shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?"""
3403,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Such is the normal development of all imagery; its actuality limits it,"
3404,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and in becoming remote it grows flexible. It is only by virtue of this
3405,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that man can retain the vast treasures of race-imagination, and continue"
3406,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to use them, such as the worlds of mythology, of chivalry, and romance."
3407,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The imagery is, in truth, a background, whose foreground is the ideal"
3408,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"meaning. Thus even fairyland, and the worlds of heaven and hell, have"
3409,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"their place in art. The actuality of the imagery is in fact irrelevant,"
3410,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"just as history is in the idealization of human events. Its transience,"
3411,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"then, cannot matter, except in so far as it loses intelligibility"
3412,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"through changes of time, place, and custom, and becomes a dead language."
3413,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,It follows that that imagery which keeps close to universal phases of
3414,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"nature, to pursuits always necessary in human life, and to ineradicable"
3415,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beliefs in respect to the supernatural, is most permanent as a language;"
3416,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and here art in its most immortal creations returns again to its
3417,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,omnipresent character as a thing of the common lot.
3418,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3419,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The transience of the contents of art may be of two kinds. There is a
3420,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passing away of error, as there is in all knowledge, but such a loss"
3421,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,need not detain attention. What is really in issue is the passing away
3422,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of the authority of precept and example fitted to one age but not to
3423,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"another, as in the case of the substitution of the ideal of humility for"
3424,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that of valour, owing to a changed emphasis in the scale of virtues. The"
3425,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contents of art, its general ideals, reproduce the successive periods of"
3426,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our earth-history as a race, by generalizing each in its own age. A"
3427,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"parallel exists in the subject-matter of the sciences; astronomy,"
3428,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"geology, paleontology are similar statements of past phases of the"
3429,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"evolution of the earth, its aspects in successive stages. Or, to take a"
3430,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"kindred example, just as the planets in their order set forth now the"
3431,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"history of our system from nascent life to complete death as earths, so"
3432,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,these ideals exhibit man's stages from savagery to such culture as has
3433,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,been attained. They have more than a descriptive and historical
3434,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,significance; they retain practical vitality because the unchangeable
3435,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,element in the universe and in man's nature is in the main their
3436,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,subject-matter. It is not merely that the child repeats in his
3437,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"education, in some measure at least, the history of the race, and hence"
3438,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,must still learn the value of bravery and humility in their order; nor
3439,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,that in the mass of men many remain ethically and emotionally in the
3440,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,characteristic stages of past culture; but these various ideals of what
3441,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is admirable have themselves identical elements, and in those points in"
3442,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which they differ respond to native varieties of human capacity and
3443,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"temperament. The living principles of Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and"
3444,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Christian thought and feeling are at work in the world, still formative;"
3445,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,it is only by such vitality that their results in art truly survive.
3446,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3447,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"There has been an expansion of the field, and some rearrangement within"
3448,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it; but the evolution of human ideals has been, in our civilization, the"
3449,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,growth of one spirit out of its dead selves carrying on into each
3450,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"reincarnation the true life that was in the form it leaves, and which is"
3451,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"immortal. The substance in each ideal, its embodiment of what is"
3452,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"cardinal in all humanity, remains integral. The alloy of mortality in a"
3453,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"work of art lies in so much of it as was limited in truth to time,"
3454,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"place, country, race, religion, its specific and contemporary part; so"
3455,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"great is this in detail that a strong power of historical imagination,"
3456,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the power to rebuild past conditions, is a main necessity of culture,"
3457,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"like the study of a dead language; an interpretative faculty, the power"
3458,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to translate into terms of our knowledge what was stated in terms of
3459,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"different beliefs, must go with this; and also a corrective power, if"
3460,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the work is to be truly useful and enter into our lives with effect.
3461,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Such an alloy there is in nearly all great works even; much in Homer,"
3462,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"something in Virgil, a considerable part of Dante, and an increasing"
3463,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,portion in Milton have this mixture of death in them; but if by keeping
3464,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to the primary, the permanent, the universal, they have escaped the"
3465,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"natural body of their age, the substance of the work is still living;"
3466,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"they have achieved such immortality as art allows. They have done so,"
3467,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,not so much by the personal power of their authors as by their
3468,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"representative character. These ideal works of the highest range, which"
3469,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,embody in themselves whole generations of effort and rise as the
3470,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"successive incarnations of human imagination, are products of race and"
3471,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"state, of world experience and social personality; they differ, race"
3472,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"from race, civilization from civilization, Hebrew or Greek, Pagan or"
3473,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Christian, just as on the individual scale persons differ; and they are"
3474,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"solved, as personality in its individual form is solved, in the element"
3475,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of the common reason, the common nature in the world and man, which they"
3476,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"contain,--in man,"
3477,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3478,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless"";"
3479,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3480,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the unity of the truth of his spirit they are freed from mortality,"
3481,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"they are mutually intelligible and interchangeable, they survive,--"
3482,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,racial and secular states and documents of a spiritual evolution yet
3483,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"going on in all its stages in the human mass, still barbarous, still"
3484,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"pagan, still Christian, but an evolution which at its highest point"
3485,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wastes nothing of the past, holds all its truth, its beauty, its vital"
3486,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"energy, in a forward reach."
3487,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3488,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,The nature of the changes which time brings may best be illustrated from
3489,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the epic, and thus the opposition of the transient and permanent"
3490,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"elements in art be, perhaps, more clearly shown. Epic action has been"
3491,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,defined as the working out of the Divine will in society; hence it
3492,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"requires a crisis of humanity as its subject, it involves the conflict"
3493,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of a higher with a lower civilization, and it is conducted by means of a"
3494,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"double plot, one in heaven, the other on earth. These are the"
3495,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"characteristic epic traits. In dealing with ideas of such importance,"
3496,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the poets in successive eras of civilization naturally found much
3497,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"adaptation to new conditions necessary, and met with ever fresh"
3498,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,difficulties; the result is a many-sided epic development. The idea of
3499,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the Divine will, the theory of its operation, and the conception of"
3500,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,society itself were all subject to change. Epics at first are
3501,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"historical; but, sharing with the tendency of all art toward inwardness"
3502,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of meaning, they become purely spiritual. The one thing that remains"
3503,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"common to all is the notion of a struggle between a higher and a lower,"
3504,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"overruled by Providence. They have two subjects of interest, one the"
3505,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"cause, the other the hero through whom the cause works; and between"
3506,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"these two interests the epic hovers, seldom if ever identifying them and"
3507,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,yet preserving their dual reality.
3508,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3509,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"The Iliad has all the traits that have been mentioned, but society is"
3510,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"still loose enough in its bonds to give the characters free play; it is,"
3511,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the main, a hero-epic. The Aeneid, on the contrary, exhibits the"
3512,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"enormous development of the social idea; its subject is Roman dominion,"
3513,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"which is the will of Zeus, localized in the struggle with Carthage and"
3514,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with Turnus, but felt in the poem pervasively as the general destiny of"
3515,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Rome in its victory over the world; and this interest is so overpowering
3516,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as to make Aeneas the slave of Jove and almost to extinguish the other
3517,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,characters; it is a state-epic. So long as the Divine will was conceived
3518,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as finding its operation through deities similar to man, the double plot"
3519,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"presented little difficulty; but in the coming of Christian thought,"
3520,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"even with its hierarchies of angels and legions of devils, the"
3521,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,interpretation became arduous. In the Jerusalem Delivered the social
3522,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conflict between Crusader and infidel is clear, the historical crisis in"
3523,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the wars of Palestine is rightly chosen, but the machinery of the"
3524,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"heavenly plot is weakened by the presence of magic, and is by itself"
3525,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ineffectual in inspiring a true belief. So in the Lusiads, while the"
3526,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conflict and the crisis, as shown in the national energy of colonization"
3527,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the East, are clear, the machinery of the heavenly plot frankly"
3528,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,reverts to mythologic and pagan forms and loses all credibility.
3529,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3530,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"In the Paradise Lost arises the spiritual epic, but still historically"
3531,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conceived; the crisis chosen, which is the fall of man in Adam, is the"
3532,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,most important conceivable by man; the powers engaged are the superior
3533,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"beings of heaven and hell in direct antagonism; but here, too, the"
3534,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"machinery of the heavenly plot is handled with much strain, and, however"
3535,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"strongly supported by the Scriptures, has little convincing power. The"
3536,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,truth is that the Divine will was coming to be conceived as implicit in
3537,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"society, being Providence there, and operating in secret but normal ways"
3538,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the guidance of events, not by special and interfering acts; and also"
3539,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as equally implicit in the individual soul, the influence of the Spirit,"
3540,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and working in the ways of spiritual law. One change, too, of vast"
3541,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"importance was announced by the words ""The Kingdom of Heaven is within"
3542,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"you."" This transferred the very scene of conflict, the theatre of"
3543,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"spiritual warfare, from an external to an internal world, and the social"
3544,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,significance of such individual battle lay in its being typical of all
3545,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"men's lives. The Faerie Queene, the most spiritual poem in all ways in"
3546,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"English, is an epic in essence, though its action is developed by a"
3547,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"revolution of the phases of the soul in succession to the eye, and not"
3548,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,by the progress of one main course of events. The conflict of the higher
3549,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,and the lower under Divine guidance in the implicit sense is there
3550,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"shown; the significance is for mankind, though not for a society in its"
3551,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,worldly fortunes; but there is little attempt to externalize the
3552,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"heavenly power in specific action in superhuman forms, though in mortal"
3553,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"ways the good knights, and especially Arthur, shadow it forth. The"
3554,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"celestial plot is humanized, and the poem becomes a hero-epic in almost"
3555,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,an exclusive way; though the knight's achievement is also an achievement
3556,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of God's will, the interest lies in the Divine power conceived as man's"
3557,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,moral victory. In the Idyls of the King there are several traits of the
3558,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,epic. There is the central idea of the conflict between the higher and
3559,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"lower, both on the social and the individual side; the victory of the"
3560,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,Round Table would have meant not only pure knights but a regenerate
3561,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"state. Here, however, the externalization of the Divine will in the Holy"
3562,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Grail, and, as in the Christian epic generally, its confusion on the"
3563,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,marvellous side with a world of enchantment passing here into the
3564,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"sensuous sphere of Merlin, are felt to be inadequate. The war of ""soul"
3565,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with sense"" was the subject-matter, as was Spenser's; the method of"
3566,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,revolution of its phases was also Spenser's; but the two poems differ in
3567,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the point that Spenser's knight wins, but Tennyson's king loses, so far"
3568,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as earth is concerned; nor can it be fairly pleaded that as in Milton
3569,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Adam loses, yet the final triumph of the cause is known and felt as a"
3570,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"divine issue of the action though outside the poem, so Arthur is saved"
3571,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,to the ideal by virtue of the faith he announces in the New Order coming
3572,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"on, for it is not so felt. The touch of pessimism invades the poem in"
3573,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"many details, but here at its heart; for Arthur alone of all the heroes"
3574,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,of epic in his own defeat drags down his cause. He is the hero of a lost
3575,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"cause, whose lance will never be raised again in mortal conflict to"
3576,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"bring the kingdom of Christ on earth, nor its victory be declared except"
3577,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,as the echo of a hope of some miraculous and merciful retrieval from
3578,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,beyond the barriers of the world to come. But in showing the different
3579,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conditions of the modern epic, its spirituality, its difficulties of"
3580,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"interpreting in sensuous imagery the working of the Divine will, its"
3581,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,relaxed hold on the social movement for which it substitutes man's
3582,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"universal nature, and the mist that settles round it in its latest"
3583,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"example, sufficient illustration has been given of the changes of time"
3584,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to which idealism is subject, and also of the essential truth surviving"
3585,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the works of the past, which in the epics is the vision of how the"
3586,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ends of God have been accomplished in the world and in the soul by the
3587,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"union of divine grace with heroic will,--the interpretation and"
3588,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"glorification, of history and of man's single conflict in himself ago"
3589,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"after age, asserting through all their range the supremacy of the ideal"
3590,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,order over its foes in the entire race-life of man.
3591,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3592,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Out of these changes of time, in response to the varying moods of men in"
3593,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"respect to the world they inhabit, arise those phases of art which are"
3594,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"described as classical and romantic, words of much confusion. It has"
3595,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,been attempted to distinguish the latter as having an element of
3596,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"remoteness, of surprise, of curiosity; but to me, at least, classical"
3597,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"art has the same remoteness, the same surprise, and answers the same"
3598,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,curiosity as romantic art. If I were to endeavour to oppose them I
3599,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"should say that classical art is clear, it is perfectly grasped in form,"
3600,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it satisfies the intellect, it awakes an emotion absorbed by itself, it"
3601,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"definitely guides the will; romantic art is touched with mystery, it has"
3602,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"richness and intricacy of form not fully comprehended, it suggests more"
3603,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"than it satisfies, it stirs an unconfined and wandering emotion, it"
3604,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,invigorates an adventurous will; classicism is whole in itself and lives
3605,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in the central region, the white light, of that star of ideality which"
3606,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,is the light of our knowledge; romanticism borders on something
3607,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"else,--the rosy corona round about our star, carrying on its dawning"
3608,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,power into those unknown infinities which embosom the spark of life. The
3609,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"two have always existed in conjunction, the romantic element in ancient"
3610,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,literature being large. But owing to the disclosure of the world to us
3611,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in later times, to the deeper sense of its mysteries which are our"
3612,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"bounding horizons round about, and especially to the impulse given to"
3613,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,emotion by the opening of the doors of immortality by Christianity to
3614,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"thought, revery, and dream, to hope and effort, the romantic element has"
3615,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"been more marked in modern art, has in fact characterized it, being fed"
3616,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"moreover by the ever increasing inwardness of human life, the greater"
3617,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"value and opportunity of personality in a free and high civilization,"
3618,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and by the uncertainty, confusion, and complexity of such masses of"
3619,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,human experience as our observation now controls. The romantic temper is
3620,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"inevitable in men whose lives are themselves thought of as, in form, but"
3621,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"fragments of the life to come, which shall find their completion an"
3622,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,eternal task. It is the natural ally of faith which it alone can render
3623,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,with an infinite outlook; and it is the complement of that mystery which
3624,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is required to supplement it, and which is an abiding presence in the"
3625,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,habit of the sensitive and serious mind. Yet in classical art the
3626,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"definite may still be rendered, the known, the conquered. Idealism has"
3627,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,its finished world therein; in romanticism it has rather its prophetic
3628,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,work.
3629,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3630,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Such, then, as best I can state it in brief and rapid strokes, is the"
3631,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world of art, its methods, its appeals, its significance to mankind."
3632,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Idealism, so presented, is in a sense a glorification of the"
3633,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,commonplace. Its realm lies in the common lot of men; its distinction is
3634,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to embrace truth for all, and truth in its universal forms of experience"
3635,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and personality, the primary, elementary, equally shared fates,"
3636,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"passions, beliefs of the race. Shakspere, our great example, as"
3637,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Coleridge wisely said, ""kept in the highway of life."" That is the royal"
3638,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"road of genius, the path of immortality, the way ever trodden by the"
3639,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,great who lead. I have ventured to speak at times of religious truth.
3640,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,What is the secret of Christ's undying power? Is it not that he stated
3641,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,universal truth in concrete forms of common experience so that it comes
3642,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,home to all men's bosoms? Genius is supreme in proportion as it does
3643,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"that, and becomes the interpreter of every man who is born into the"
3644,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world, makes him know his brotherhood with all, and the incorporation of"
3645,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"his fate in the scheme of law, and ideal achievement under it, which is"
3646,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,the common ground of humanity. Ideal literature is the treasury of such
3647,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"genius in the past; here, as I said in the beginning, the wisdom of the"
3648,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"soul is stored; and art, in all its forms, is immortal only in so far as"
3649,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"it has done its share in this same labour of illumination, persuasion,"
3650,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and command, forecasting the spirit to be, companioning the spirit that"
3651,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"is, sustaining us all in the effort to make ideal order actual in"
3652,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,ourselves.
3653,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3654,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"What, then, since I said that it is a question how to live as well as"
3655,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"how to express life,--what, then, is the ideal life? It is to make"
3656,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"one's life a poem, as Milton dreamed of the true poet; for as art works"
3657,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,through matter and takes on concrete and sensible shape with its mortal
3658,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"conditions, so the soul dips in life, is in material action, and,"
3659,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"suffering a similar fate, sinks into limitations and externals of this"
3660,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"world and this flesh, through which it must live. In such a life, mortal"
3661,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"in all ways, to bring down to earth the vision that floats in the soul's"
3662,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eyes, the ideal order as it is revealed to the poet's gaze,"
3663,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"incorporating it in deed and being, and to make it prevail, so far as"
3664,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"our lives have power, in the world of our life, is the task set for us."
3665,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"To disengage reason from the confusion of things, and behold the eternal"
3666,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,forms of the mind; to unveil beauty in the transitory sights of our
3667,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"eyes, and behold the eternal forms of sense; so to act that the will"
3668,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,within us shall take on this form of reason and our manifest life wear
3669,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"this form of beauty; and, more closely, to live in the primary"
3670,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"affections, the noble passions, the sweet emotions,--"
3671,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3672,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"""Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,"
3673,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Relations dear, and all the charities"
3674,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Of father, son, and brother,--"""
3675,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3676,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"and also in the general sorrows of mankind, thereby, in joy and grief,"
3677,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,entering sympathetically into the hearts of common men; to keep in the
3678,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"highway of life, not turning aside to the eccentric, the sensational,"
3679,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the abnormal, the brutal, the base, but seeing them, if they must come"
3680,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"within our vision, in their place only by the edges of true life; and,"
3681,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"if, being men, we are caught in the tragic coil, to seek the restoration"
3682,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"of broken order, learning also in such bitterness better to understand"
3683,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the dark conflict forever waging in the general heart, the terror of the"
3684,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"heavy clouds hanging on the slopes of our battle, the pathos that looks"
3685,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,down even from blue skies that have kept watch o'er man's
3686,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"mortality,--so, even through failure, to draw nearer to our race; this,"
3687,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as I conceive it, is to lead the ideal life. It is a message blended of"
3688,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"many voices of the poets whom Shelley called, whatever might be their"
3689,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"calamity on earth, the most fortunate of men; it rises from all lands,"
3690,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"all ages, all religions; it is the battle-cry of that one great idea"
3691,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,whose slow and hesitating growth is the unfolding of our long
3692,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"civilization, seeking to realize in democracy the earthly, and in"
3693,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Christianity the heavenly, hope of man,--the idea of the community of"
3694,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the soul, the sameness of it in all men. To lead this life is to be one"
3695,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"with man through love, one with the universe through knowledge, one with"
3696,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"God through the will; that is its goal, toward that we strive, in that"
3697,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,we believe.
3698,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,
3699,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"And Thou, O Youth, for whom these lines are written, fear not; idealize"
3700,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"your friend, for it is better to love and be deceived than not to love"
3701,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"at all; idealize your masters, and take Shelley and Sidney to your"
3702,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"bosom, so shall they serve you more nobly and you love them more sweetly"
3703,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,than if the touch and sight of their mortality had been yours indeed;
3704,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"idealize your country, remembering that Brutus in the dagger-stroke and"
3705,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"Cato in his death-darkness knew not the greater Rome, the proclaimer of"
3706,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the unity of our race, the codifier of justice, the establisher of our"
3707,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"church, and died not knowing,--but do you believe in the purpose of God,"
3708,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"so shall you best serve the times to be; and in your own life, fear not"
3709,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"to act as your ideal shall command, in the constant presence of that"
3710,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"other self who goes with you, as I have said, so shall you blend with"
3711,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,him at the end. Fear not either to believe that the soul is as eternal
3712,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"as the order that obtains in it, wherefore you shall forever pursue that"
3713,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"divine beauty which has here so touched and inflamed you,--for this is"
3714,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"the faith of man, your race, and those who were fairest in its records."
3715,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"And have recourse always to the fountains of this life in literature,"
3716,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,which are the wells of truth. How to live is the one matter; the wisest
3717,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"man in his ripe age is yet to seek in it; but Thou, begin now and seek"
3718,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,"wisdom in the beauty of virtue and live in its light, rejoicing in it;"
3719,A NEW DEFENCE OF POETRY,so in this world shall you live in the foregleam of the world to come.

3724,DEMOCRACY,DEMOCRACY
3725,DEMOCRACY,
3726,DEMOCRACY,
3727,DEMOCRACY,"Democracy is a prophecy, and looks to the future; it is for this reason"
3728,DEMOCRACY,that it has its great career. Its faith is the substance of things hoped
3729,DEMOCRACY,"for and the evidence of things unseen, whose realization will be the"
3730,DEMOCRACY,labour of a long age. The life of historic nations has been a pursuit
3731,DEMOCRACY,toward a goal under the impulse of ideas often obscurely
3732,DEMOCRACY,"comprehended,--world-ideas as we call them,--which they have embodied in"
3733,DEMOCRACY,"accomplished facts and in the institutions and beliefs of mankind,"
3734,DEMOCRACY,lasting through ages; and as each nation has slowly grown aware of the
3735,DEMOCRACY,"idea which animated it, it has become self-conscious and conscious of"
3736,DEMOCRACY,greatness. That men are born equal is still a doctrine openly derided;
3737,DEMOCRACY,that they are born free is not accepted without much nullifying
3738,DEMOCRACY,limitation; that they are born in brotherhood is less readily denied.
3739,DEMOCRACY,"These three, the revolutionary words, liberty, equality, fraternity, are"
3740,DEMOCRACY,"the substance of democracy, if the matter be well considered, and all"
3741,DEMOCRACY,else is but consequence.
3742,DEMOCRACY,
3743,DEMOCRACY,"It might seem singular that man should ever have found out this creed,"
3744,DEMOCRACY,"as that physical life could invent the brain, since the struggle for"
3745,DEMOCRACY,"existence in primitive and early times was so adverse to it, and rested"
3746,DEMOCRACY,"on a selfish and aggrandizing principle, in states as well as between"
3747,DEMOCRACY,races. In most parts of the world the first true governments were
3748,DEMOCRACY,"tyrannies, patriarchal or despotic; and where liberty was indigenous, it"
3749,DEMOCRACY,was confined to the race-blood. Aristotle speaks of slavery without
3750,DEMOCRACY,"repugnance save in Greeks, and serfdom was incorporated in the northern"
3751,DEMOCRACY,tribes as soon as they began to be socially organized. Some have alleged
3752,DEMOCRACY,"that religious equality was an Oriental idea, and borrowed from the"
3753,DEMOCRACY,"relation of subjects to an Asiatic despot, which paved the way for it;"
3754,DEMOCRACY,some attribute civil equality to the Roman law; some find the germ of
3755,DEMOCRACY,both in Stoical morals. But so great an idea as the equality of man
3756,DEMOCRACY,reaches down into the past by a thousand roots. The state of nature of
3757,DEMOCRACY,"the savage in the woods, which our fathers once thought a pattern, bore"
3758,DEMOCRACY,some outward resemblance to a freeman's life; but such a condition is
3759,DEMOCRACY,rather one of private independence than of the grounded social right
3760,DEMOCRACY,that democracy contemplates. How the ideas involved came into historical
3761,DEMOCRACY,"existence is a minor matter. Democracy has its great career, for the"
3762,DEMOCRACY,"first time, in our national being, and exhibits here most purely its"
3763,DEMOCRACY,"formative powers, and unfolds destiny on the grand scale. Nothing is"
3764,DEMOCRACY,"more incumbent on us than to study it, to turn it this way and that, to"
3765,DEMOCRACY,handle it as often and in as many phases as possible with lively
3766,DEMOCRACY,"curiosity, and not to betray ourselves by an easy assumption that so"
3767,DEMOCRACY,elementary a thing is comprehended because it seems simple. Fundamental
3768,DEMOCRACY,ideas are precisely those with which we should be most familiar.
3769,DEMOCRACY,
3770,DEMOCRACY,Democracy is not merely a political experiment; and its governmental
3771,DEMOCRACY,"theory, though so characteristic of it as not to be dissociated from it,"
3772,DEMOCRACY,is a result of underlying principles. There is always an ideality of the
3773,DEMOCRACY,"human spirit in all its works, if one will search them, which is the"
3774,DEMOCRACY,"main thing. The State, as a social aggregate with a joint life which"
3775,DEMOCRACY,"constitutes it a nation, is dynamically an embodiment of human"
3776,DEMOCRACY,"conviction, desire, and tendency, with a common basis of wisdom and"
3777,DEMOCRACY,"energy of action, seeking to realize life in accordance with its ideal,"
3778,DEMOCRACY,"whether traditional or novel, of what life should be; and government is"
3779,DEMOCRACY,no more than the mode of administration under which it achieves its
3780,DEMOCRACY,results both in national life and in the lives of its citizens. All
3781,DEMOCRACY,"society is a means of escape from personality, and its limitations of"
3782,DEMOCRACY,"power and wisdom, into this larger communal life; the individual, in so"
3783,DEMOCRACY,"far, loses his particularity, and at the same time intensifies and"
3784,DEMOCRACY,strengthens that portion of his life which is thus made one with the
3785,DEMOCRACY,"general life of men,--that universal and typical life which they have in"
3786,DEMOCRACY,common and which moulds them with similar characteristics. It is by this
3787,DEMOCRACY,"fusion of the individual with the mass, this identification of himself"
3788,DEMOCRACY,"with mankind in a joint activity, this reenforcement of himself by what"
3789,DEMOCRACY,"is himself in others, that a man becomes a social being. The process is"
3790,DEMOCRACY,"the same, whether in clubs, societies of all kinds, sects, political"
3791,DEMOCRACY,"parties, or the all-embracing body of the State. It is by making himself"
3792,DEMOCRACY,"one with human nature in America, its faith, its methods, and the"
3793,DEMOCRACY,"controlling purposes in our life among nations, and not by birth"
3794,DEMOCRACY,"merely, that a man becomes an American."
3795,DEMOCRACY,
3796,DEMOCRACY,"The life of society, however, includes various affairs, and man deals"
3797,DEMOCRACY,with them by different means; thus property is a mode of dealing with
3798,DEMOCRACY,things. Democracy is a mode of dealing with souls. Men commonly speak as
3799,DEMOCRACY,if the soul were something they expect to possess in another world; men
3800,DEMOCRACY,"are souls, and this is a fundamental conception of democracy. This"
3801,DEMOCRACY,"spiritual element is the substance of democracy, in the large sense; and"
3802,DEMOCRACY,"the special governmental theory which it has developed and organized,"
3803,DEMOCRACY,"and in which its ideas are partially included, is, like other such"
3804,DEMOCRACY,"systems, a mode of administration under which it seeks to realize its"
3805,DEMOCRACY,"ideal of what life ought to be, with most speed and certainty, and on"
3806,DEMOCRACY,the largest scale. What characterizes that ideal is that it takes the
3807,DEMOCRACY,soul into account in a way hitherto unknown; not that other governments
3808,DEMOCRACY,"have not had regard to the soul, but, in democracy, it is spirituality"
3809,DEMOCRACY,"that gives the law and rules the issue. Hence, a great preparation was"
3810,DEMOCRACY,needed before democracy could come into effective control of society.
3811,DEMOCRACY,"Christianity mainly afforded this, in respect to the ideas of equality"
3812,DEMOCRACY,"and fraternity, which were clarified and illustrated in the life of the"
3813,DEMOCRACY,"Church for ages, before they entered practically into politics and the"
3814,DEMOCRACY,general secular arrangements of state organization; the nations of
3815,DEMOCRACY,"progress, of which freedom is a condition, developed more definitely the"
3816,DEMOCRACY,"idea of liberty, and made it familiar to the thoughts of men. Democracy"
3817,DEMOCRACY,"belongs to a comparatively late age of the world, and to advanced"
3818,DEMOCRACY,"nations, because such ideas could come into action only after the crude"
3819,DEMOCRACY,material necessities of human progress--illustrated in the warfare of
3820,DEMOCRACY,"nations, in military organizations for the extension of a common rule"
3821,DEMOCRACY,"and culture among mankind, and in despotic impositions of order,"
3822,DEMOCRACY,"justice, and the general ideas of civilization--had relaxed, and a free"
3823,DEMOCRACY,"course, by comparison at least, was opened for the higher nature of man"
3824,DEMOCRACY,in both private and public action. A conception of the soul and its
3825,DEMOCRACY,"destiny, not previously applicable in society, underlies democracy; this"
3826,DEMOCRACY,"is why it is the most spiritual government known to man, and therefore"
3827,DEMOCRACY,"the highest reach of man's evolution; it is, in fact, the spiritual"
3828,DEMOCRACY,element in society expressing itself now in politics with an unsuspected
3829,DEMOCRACY,and incalculable force.
3830,DEMOCRACY,
3831,DEMOCRACY,"Democracy is contained in the triple statement that men are born free,"
3832,DEMOCRACY,"equal, and in brotherhood; and in this formula it is the middle term"
3833,DEMOCRACY,"that is cardinal, and the root of all. Yet it is the doctrine of the"
3834,DEMOCRACY,"equality of man, by virtue of the human nature with which he is clothed"
3835,DEMOCRACY,"entire at birth, that is most attacked, as an obvious absurdity, and"
3836,DEMOCRACY,"provocative more of laughter than of argument. What, then, is this"
3837,DEMOCRACY,equality which democracy affirms as the true state of all men among
3838,DEMOCRACY,"themselves? It is our common human nature, that identity of the soul in"
3839,DEMOCRACY,"all men, which was first inculcated by the preaching of Christ's death"
3840,DEMOCRACY,"for all equally, whence it followed that every human soul was of equal"
3841,DEMOCRACY,"value in the eyes of God, its Creator, and had the same title to the"
3842,DEMOCRACY,"rites of the Christian Church, and the same blessedness of an infinite"
3843,DEMOCRACY,immortality in the world to come; thence we derived it from the very
3844,DEMOCRACY,"fountain of our faith, and the first true democracy was that which"
3845,DEMOCRACY,"levelled king and peasant, barbarian and Roman, in the communion of our"
3846,DEMOCRACY,"Lord. Yet nature laughs at us, and ordains such inequalities at birth"
3847,DEMOCRACY,itself as make our peremptory charter of the value of men's souls seem a
3848,DEMOCRACY,"play of fancy. There are men of almost divine intelligence, men of"
3849,DEMOCRACY,"almost devilish instincts, men of more or less clouded mind; and they"
3850,DEMOCRACY,"are such at birth, so deeply has nature stamped into them heredity,"
3851,DEMOCRACY,"circumstance, and the physical conditions of sanity, morality and"
3852,DEMOCRACY,"wholesomeness, in the body which is her work. Such differences do exist,"
3853,DEMOCRACY,"and conditions vary the world over, whence nature, which accumulates"
3854,DEMOCRACY,"inequalities in the struggle for life, ""with ravin shrieks against our"
3855,DEMOCRACY,"creed."" But we have not now to learn for the first time that nature,"
3856,DEMOCRACY,"though not the enemy of the human spirit, is indifferent to all the soul"
3857,DEMOCRACY,"has erected in man's own realm, peculiar to humanity. What has nature"
3858,DEMOCRACY,contributed to the doctrine of freedom or of fraternity? Man's life to
3859,DEMOCRACY,"her is all one, tyrant or slave, friend or foe, wise or foolish,"
3860,DEMOCRACY,"virtuous or vicious, holy or profane, so long as her imperative physical"
3861,DEMOCRACY,"conditions of life, the mortal thing, are conformed to; society itself"
3862,DEMOCRACY,"is not her care, nor civilization, nor anything that belongs to man"
3863,DEMOCRACY,"above the brute. Her word, consequently, need not disturb us; she is"
3864,DEMOCRACY,"not our oracle. It rather belongs to us to win further victory over her,"
3865,DEMOCRACY,"if it may be, by our intelligence, and control her vital, as we are now"
3866,DEMOCRACY,"coming to control her material, powers and their operation."
3867,DEMOCRACY,
3868,DEMOCRACY,"This equality which democracy affirms--the identity of the soul, the"
3869,DEMOCRACY,"sameness of its capacities of energy, knowledge, and enjoyment--draws"
3870,DEMOCRACY,after it as a consequence the soul's right to opportunity for
3871,DEMOCRACY,self-development by virtue of which it may possess itself of what shall
3872,DEMOCRACY,"be its own fulness of life. In the inscrutable mystery of this world,"
3873,DEMOCRACY,"the soul at birth enters on an unequal struggle, made such both by"
3874,DEMOCRACY,"inherent conditions and by external limitations, in individuals,"
3875,DEMOCRACY,"classes, and races; but the determination of democracy is that, so far"
3876,DEMOCRACY,"as may be, it will secure equality of opportunity to every soul born"
3877,DEMOCRACY,"within its dominion, in the expectation that much in human conditions"
3878,DEMOCRACY,"which has hitherto fed and heightened inequality, in both heredity and"
3879,DEMOCRACY,"circumstance, may be lessened if not eradicated; and life after birth is"
3880,DEMOCRACY,subject to great control. This is the meaning of the first axiom of
3881,DEMOCRACY,"democracy, that all have a right to the pursuit of happiness, and its"
3882,DEMOCRACY,"early cries--""an open career,"" and ""the tools to him who can use them."""
3883,DEMOCRACY,In this effort society seems almost as recalcitrant as nature; for in
3884,DEMOCRACY,human history the accumulation of the selfish advantage of inequality
3885,DEMOCRACY,has told with as much effect as ever it did in the original struggle of
3886,DEMOCRACY,reptile and beast; and in our present complex and extended civilization
3887,DEMOCRACY,a slight gain over the mass entails a telling mortgage of the future to
3888,DEMOCRACY,"him who makes it and to his heirs, while efficiency is of such high"
3889,DEMOCRACY,value in such a society that it must needs be favoured to the utmost; on
3890,DEMOCRACY,the other hand a complex civilization encourages a vast variety of
3891,DEMOCRACY,"talent, and finds a special place for that individuation of capacity"
3892,DEMOCRACY,"which goes along with social evolution. The end, too, which democracy"
3893,DEMOCRACY,"seeks is not a sameness of specific results, but rather an equivalence;"
3894,DEMOCRACY,and its duty is satisfied if the child of its rule finds such
3895,DEMOCRACY,"development as was possible to him, has a free course, and cannot charge"
3896,DEMOCRACY,his deficiency to social interference and the restriction of established
3897,DEMOCRACY,law.
3898,DEMOCRACY,
3899,DEMOCRACY,The great hold that the doctrine of equality has upon the masses is not
3900,DEMOCRACY,"merely because it furnishes the justification of the whole scheme,"
3901,DEMOCRACY,"which is a logic they may be dimly conscious of, but that it establishes"
3902,DEMOCRACY,"their title to such good in human life as they can obtain, on the"
3903,DEMOCRACY,"broadest scale and in the fullest measure. What other claim, so rational"
3904,DEMOCRACY,"and noble in itself, can they put forth in the face of what they find"
3905,DEMOCRACY,established in the world they are born into? The results of past
3906,DEMOCRACY,"civilization are still monopolized by small minorities of mankind, who"
3907,DEMOCRACY,"receive by inheritance, under natural and civil law, the greater"
3908,DEMOCRACY,"individual share of material comfort, of large intelligence, of"
3909,DEMOCRACY,fortunate careers. It does not matter that the things which belong to
3910,DEMOCRACY,"life as such, the greater blessings essential to human existence, cannot"
3911,DEMOCRACY,be monopolized; all that man can take and appropriate they find
3912,DEMOCRACY,preoccupied so far as human discovery and energy have been able to
3913,DEMOCRACY,"reach, understand, and utilize it; and what proposition can they assert"
3914,DEMOCRACY,as against this sequestering of social results and material and
3915,DEMOCRACY,"intellectual opportunity, except to say, ""we, too, are men,"" and with"
3916,DEMOCRACY,the word to claim a share in such parts of social good as are not
3917,DEMOCRACY,"irretrievably pledged to men better born, better educated, better"
3918,DEMOCRACY,supplied with the means of subsistence and the accumulated hoard of the
3919,DEMOCRACY,"past, which has come into their hands by an award of fortune? It is not"
3920,DEMOCRACY,"a fanciful idea. It is founded in the unity of human nature, which is as"
3921,DEMOCRACY,"certain as any philosophic truth, and has been proclaimed by every"
3922,DEMOCRACY,master-spirit of our race time out of mind. It is supported by the
3923,DEMOCRACY,"universal faith, in which we are bred, that we are children of a common"
3924,DEMOCRACY,"Father, and saved by one Redeemer and destined to one immortality, and"
3925,DEMOCRACY,cannot be balked of the fulness of life which was our gift under divine
3926,DEMOCRACY,"providence. I emphasize the religious basis, because I believe it is the"
3927,DEMOCRACY,"rock of the foundation in respect to this principle, which cannot be"
3928,DEMOCRACY,successfully impeached by any one who accepts Christian truth; while in
3929,DEMOCRACY,"the lower sphere, on worldly grounds alone, it is plain that the immense"
3930,DEMOCRACY,"advantage of the doctrine of equality to the masses of men, justifies"
3931,DEMOCRACY,the advancement of it as an assumption which they call on the issue in
3932,DEMOCRACY,time to approve.
3933,DEMOCRACY,
3934,DEMOCRACY,It is in this portion of the field that democracy relies most upon its
3935,DEMOCRACY,prophetic power. Within the limits of nature and mortal life the hope
3936,DEMOCRACY,"of any equal development of the soul seems folly; yet, so far as my"
3937,DEMOCRACY,"judgment extends, in men of the same race and community it appears to me"
3938,DEMOCRACY,that the sameness in essentials is so great as to leave the differences
3939,DEMOCRACY,"inessential, so far as power to take hold of life and possess it in"
3940,DEMOCRACY,"thought, will, or feeling is in question. I do not see, if I may"
3941,DEMOCRACY,"continue to speak personally, that in the great affairs of life, in"
3942,DEMOCRACY,"duty, love, self-control, the willingness to serve, the sense of joy,"
3943,DEMOCRACY,"the power to endure, there is any great difference among those of the"
3944,DEMOCRACY,"same community; and this is reasonable, for the permanent relations of"
3945,DEMOCRACY,"life, in families, in social ties, in public service, and in all that"
3946,DEMOCRACY,"the belief in heaven and the attachments to home bring into men's lives,"
3947,DEMOCRACY,"are the same; and though, in the choicer parts of fortunate lives,"
3948,DEMOCRACY,aesthetic and intellectual goods may be more important than among the
3949,DEMOCRACY,"common people, these are less penetrating and go not to the core, which"
3950,DEMOCRACY,"remains life as all know it--a thing of affection, of resolve, of"
3951,DEMOCRACY,"service, of use to those to whom it may be of human use. Is it not"
3952,DEMOCRACY,"reasonable, then, on the ground of what makes up the substance of life"
3953,DEMOCRACY,"within our observation, to accept this principle of equality, fortified"
3954,DEMOCRACY,as it is by any conception of heaven's justice to its creatures? and to
3955,DEMOCRACY,"assume, if the word must be used, the principle primary in democracy,"
3956,DEMOCRACY,that all men are equally endowed with destiny? and thus to allow its
3957,DEMOCRACY,"prophetic claim, till disproved, that equal opportunity, linked with the"
3958,DEMOCRACY,"service of the higher to the lower, will justify its hope? At all"
3959,DEMOCRACY,"events, in this lies the possibility of greater achievement than would"
3960,DEMOCRACY,otherwise be attained within our national limits; and what is found to
3961,DEMOCRACY,be true of us may be extended to less developed communities and races in
3962,DEMOCRACY,their degree.
3963,DEMOCRACY,
3964,DEMOCRACY,"The doctrine of the equality of mankind by virtue of their birth as men,"
3965,DEMOCRACY,with its consequent right to equality of opportunity for
3966,DEMOCRACY,"self-development as a part of social justice, establishes a common basis"
3967,DEMOCRACY,"of conviction, in respect to man, and a definite end as one main object"
3968,DEMOCRACY,of the State; and these elements are primary in the democratic scheme.
3969,DEMOCRACY,"Liberty is the next step, and is the means by which that end is secured."
3970,DEMOCRACY,It is so cardinal in democracy as to seem hardly secondary to equality
3971,DEMOCRACY,"in importance. Every State, every social organization whatever, implies"
3972,DEMOCRACY,a principle of authority commanding obedience; it may be of the absolute
3973,DEMOCRACY,"type of military and ecclesiastical use, or limited, as in"
3974,DEMOCRACY,constitutional monarchies; but some obedience and some authority are
3975,DEMOCRACY,necessary in order that the will of the State may be realized. The
3976,DEMOCRACY,problem of democracy is to find that principle of authority which is
3977,DEMOCRACY,"most consistent with the liberty it would establish, and which acts with"
3978,DEMOCRACY,the greatest furtherance and the least interference in the
3979,DEMOCRACY,"accomplishment of the chief end in view. It composes authority,"
3980,DEMOCRACY,"therefore, of personal liberty itself, and derives it from the consent"
3981,DEMOCRACY,"of the governed, and not merely from their consent but from their active"
3982,DEMOCRACY,"decree. The social will is impersonal, generic, the will of man, not of"
3983,DEMOCRACY,"men; particular wills enter into it, and make it, so constituted,"
3984,DEMOCRACY,themselves in a larger and external form. The citizen has parted with no
3985,DEMOCRACY,portion of his freedom of will; the will of the State is still his own
3986,DEMOCRACY,"will, projected in unison with other wills, all jointly making up one"
3987,DEMOCRACY,"sum,--the authority of the nation. This is social self-government,--not"
3988,DEMOCRACY,"the anarchy of individuals each having his own way for himself, but"
3989,DEMOCRACY,"government through a delegated self, if one may use the phrase,"
3990,DEMOCRACY,organically combined with others in the single power of control
3991,DEMOCRACY,belonging to a State. This fusion is accomplished in the secondary
3992,DEMOCRACY,"stage, for the continuous action of the State, by representation,"
3993,DEMOCRACY,"technically; but, in its primary stage and original validity, by"
3994,DEMOCRACY,universal suffrage; for the characteristic trait of democracy is that in
3995,DEMOCRACY,"constituting this authority, which is social as opposed to personal"
3996,DEMOCRACY,"freedom,--personal freedom existing in its social form,--it includes"
3997,DEMOCRACY,"every unit of will, and gives to each equivalence. Democracy thus"
3998,DEMOCRACY,"establishes the will of society in its most universal form, lying"
3999,DEMOCRACY,between the opposite extremes of particularism in despotism and anarchy;
4000,DEMOCRACY,"it owns the most catholic organ of authority, and enters into it with"
4001,DEMOCRACY,the entire original force of the community.
4002,DEMOCRACY,
4003,DEMOCRACY,This universal will of democracy is distinguished from the more limited
4004,DEMOCRACY,forms of states partially embodying democratic principles by the fact
4005,DEMOCRACY,that nothing enters into it except man as such. The rival powers which
4006,DEMOCRACY,"seek to encroach upon this scheme, and are foreign elements in a pure"
4007,DEMOCRACY,"democracy, are education, property, and ancestry, which last has its"
4008,DEMOCRACY,claim as the custodian of education and property and the advantages
4009,DEMOCRACY,"flowing from their long possession; the trained mind, the accumulated"
4010,DEMOCRACY,"capital, and the fixed historic tradition of the nation in its most"
4011,DEMOCRACY,"intense and efficient personal form are summed up in these, and would"
4012,DEMOCRACY,appropriate to themselves in the structure of government a
4013,DEMOCRACY,representation not based on individual manhood but on other grounds. If
4014,DEMOCRACY,it be still allowed that all men should have a share in a
4015,DEMOCRACY,"self-government, it is yet maintained that a share should be granted, in"
4016,DEMOCRACY,"addition, to educated men and owners of property, and to descendants of"
4017,DEMOCRACY,"such men who have founded permanent families with an inherited capacity,"
4018,DEMOCRACY,"a tradition, and a material stake. Yet these three things, education,"
4019,DEMOCRACY,"property, and ancestry, are in the front rank of those inequalities in"
4020,DEMOCRACY,human conditions which democracy would minimize. They embody past custom
4021,DEMOCRACY,and present results which are a deposit of the past; they plead that
4022,DEMOCRACY,"they found men wards and were their guardians, and that under their own"
4023,DEMOCRACY,"domination progress was made, and all that now is came into being; but"
4024,DEMOCRACY,they must show farther some reason in present conditions under
4025,DEMOCRACY,democracy now why such potent inequalities and breeders of inequality
4026,DEMOCRACY,should be clothed with governing power.
4027,DEMOCRACY,
4028,DEMOCRACY,"Universal suffrage is the centre of the discussion, and the argument"
4029,DEMOCRACY,"against it is twofold. It is said that, though much in the theory of"
4030,DEMOCRACY,"democracy may be granted and its methods partially adopted, men at large"
4031,DEMOCRACY,"lack the wisdom to govern themselves for good in society, and also that"
4032,DEMOCRACY,they control by their votes much more than is rightfully their own. The
4033,DEMOCRACY,operation of the social will is in large concerns of men requiring
4034,DEMOCRACY,"knowledge and skill, and it has no limits. In state affairs education"
4035,DEMOCRACY,"should have authority reserved to it, and certain established interests,"
4036,DEMOCRACY,"especially the rights of property, should be exempted from popular"
4037,DEMOCRACY,control; and the effectual means of securing these ends is to magnify
4038,DEMOCRACY,the representatives of education and property to such a degree that they
4039,DEMOCRACY,will retain deciding power. But is this so? or if there be some truth in
4040,DEMOCRACY,"the premises, may it not be contained in the democratic scheme and"
4041,DEMOCRACY,"reconciled with it? And, to begin with, is education, in the special"
4042,DEMOCRACY,"sense, so important in the fundamental decisions which the suffrage"
4043,DEMOCRACY,"makes? I speak, of course, of literary education. It may well be the"
4044,DEMOCRACY,case that the judgment of men at large is sufficiently informed and
4045,DEMOCRACY,"sound to be safe, and is the safest, for the reason that the good of"
4046,DEMOCRACY,"society is for all in common, and being, from the political point of"
4047,DEMOCRACY,"view, in the main, a material good, comes home to their business and"
4048,DEMOCRACY,"bosoms in the most direct and universal way, in their comfort or"
4049,DEMOCRACY,"deprivation, in prosperity and hard times, in war and famine, and those"
4050,DEMOCRACY,wide-extended results of national policies which are the evidence and
4051,DEMOCRACY,"the facts. Politics is very largely, and one might almost say normally,"
4052,DEMOCRACY,a conflict of material interests; ideas dissociated from action are not
4053,DEMOCRACY,its sphere; the way in which policies are found immediately to affect
4054,DEMOCRACY,"human life is their political significance. On the broad scale, who is a"
4055,DEMOCRACY,better judge of their own material condition and the modifications of it
4056,DEMOCRACY,"from time to time, of what they receive and what they need from"
4057,DEMOCRACY,"political agencies, than the individual men who gain or suffer by what"
4058,DEMOCRACY,"is done, on so great a scale that, combined, these men make the masses?"
4059,DEMOCRACY,"Experience is their touchstone, and it is an experience universally"
4060,DEMOCRACY,"diffused. Education, too, is a word that will bear interpretation. It is"
4061,DEMOCRACY,"not synonymous with intelligence, for intelligence is native in men,"
4062,DEMOCRACY,"and, though increased by education, not conditioned upon it."
4063,DEMOCRACY,"Intelligence, in the limited sphere in which the unlearned man applies"
4064,DEMOCRACY,"it, in the things he knows, may be more powerful, more penetrating,"
4065,DEMOCRACY,"comprehensive, and quick, in him, than in the technically educated man;"
4066,DEMOCRACY,"for he is educated by things, and especially in those matters which"
4067,DEMOCRACY,"touch his own interests, widely shared. The school of life embodies a"
4068,DEMOCRACY,"compulsory education that no man escapes. If politics, then, be in the"
4069,DEMOCRACY,"main a conflict of material interests broadly affecting masses of men,"
4070,DEMOCRACY,"the people, both individually and as a body, may well be more competent"
4071,DEMOCRACY,"to deal with the matter in hand intelligently than those who, though"
4072,DEMOCRACY,"highly educated, are usually somewhat removed from the pressure of"
4073,DEMOCRACY,"things, and feel results and also conditions, even widely prevalent, at"
4074,DEMOCRACY,"a less early stage and with less hardship, and at best in very mild"
4075,DEMOCRACY,"forms. Besides, to put it grossly, it is often not brains that are"
4076,DEMOCRACY,required to diagnose a political situation so much as stomachs. The
4077,DEMOCRACY,"sphere of ideas, of reason and argument, in politics, is really"
4078,DEMOCRACY,"limited; in the main, politics is, as has been said, the selfish"
4079,DEMOCRACY,struggle of material interests in a vast and diversified State.
4080,DEMOCRACY,
4081,DEMOCRACY,"Common experience furnishes a basis of political fact, well known to the"
4082,DEMOCRACY,"people in their state of life, and also a test of any general policy"
4083,DEMOCRACY,once put into operation. The capacity of the people to judge the event
4084,DEMOCRACY,"in the long run must be allowed. But does broad human experience,"
4085,DEMOCRACY,"however close and pressing, contain that forecast of the future, that"
4086,DEMOCRACY,"right choice of the means of betterment, or even knowledge of the remedy"
4087,DEMOCRACY,"itself, which belong in the proper sphere of enlightened intelligence? I"
4088,DEMOCRACY,am not well assured that it is not so. The masses have been long in
4089,DEMOCRACY,"existence, and what affects them is seldom novel; they are of the breed"
4090,DEMOCRACY,that through
4091,DEMOCRACY,
4092,DEMOCRACY,"""old experience do attain"
4093,DEMOCRACY,"To something like prophetic strain."""
4094,DEMOCRACY,
4095,DEMOCRACY,"The sense of the people, learning from their fathers and their mothers,"
4096,DEMOCRACY,"sums up a vast amount of wisdom in common life, and more surely than in"
4097,DEMOCRACY,others the half-conscious tendencies of the times; for in them these are
4098,DEMOCRACY,"vital rather than reflective, and go on by the force of universal"
4099,DEMOCRACY,"conditions, hopes, and energies. In them, too, intelligence works in"
4100,DEMOCRACY,"precisely the same way as in other men, and in politics precisely as in"
4101,DEMOCRACY,"other parts of life. They listen to those they trust who, by"
4102,DEMOCRACY,"neighbourhood, by sympathetic knowledge of their own state, or actual"
4103,DEMOCRACY,"share in it, by superior powers of mind and a larger fund of"
4104,DEMOCRACY,"information, are qualified to be their leaders in forming opinion and"
4105,DEMOCRACY,their instruments in the policy they adopt. These leaders may be called
4106,DEMOCRACY,demagogues. They may be thought to employ only resources of trickery
4107,DEMOCRACY,"upon dupes for selfish ends; but such a view, generally, is a shallow"
4108,DEMOCRACY,"one, and not justified by facts. It is right in the masses to make men"
4109,DEMOCRACY,"like themselves and nigh to them, especially those born and bred in"
4110,DEMOCRACY,"their own condition of life, their leaders, in preference to men,"
4111,DEMOCRACY,"however educated, benevolent, and upright, who are not embodiments of"
4112,DEMOCRACY,"the social conditions, needs, and aspirations of the people in their"
4113,DEMOCRACY,"cruder life, if it in fact substantially be so, and to allow these men,"
4114,DEMOCRACY,"so chosen, to find a leader among themselves. Such a man is a true chief"
4115,DEMOCRACY,"of a party, who is not an individual holding great interests in trust"
4116,DEMOCRACY,and managing them with benevolent despotism by virtue of his own
4117,DEMOCRACY,"superior brain; he is the incarnation, as a party chief, of other brains"
4118,DEMOCRACY,"and wills, a representative exceeding by far in wisdom and power"
4119,DEMOCRACY,"himself, a man in whom the units of society, millions of them, have"
4120,DEMOCRACY,"their governmental life. No doubt he has great qualities of sympathy,"
4121,DEMOCRACY,"comprehension, understanding, tact, efficient power, in order to become"
4122,DEMOCRACY,"a chief; but he leads by following, he relies on his sense of public"
4123,DEMOCRACY,"support, he rises by virtue of the common will, the common sense, which"
4124,DEMOCRACY,store themselves in him. Such the leaders of the people have always
4125,DEMOCRACY,been.
4126,DEMOCRACY,
4127,DEMOCRACY,If this process--and it is to be observed that as the scale of power
4128,DEMOCRACY,rises the more limited elements of social influence enter into the
4129,DEMOCRACY,result with more determining force--be apparently crude in its early
4130,DEMOCRACY,"stages, and imperfect at the best, is it different from the process of"
4131,DEMOCRACY,social expansion in other parts of life? Wherever masses of men are
4132,DEMOCRACY,"entering upon a rising and larger life, do not the same phenomena occur?"
4133,DEMOCRACY,"in religion, for example, was there not a similar popular crudity, as it"
4134,DEMOCRACY,"is termed by some, a vulgarity as others name it, in the Methodist"
4135,DEMOCRACY,"movement, in the Presbyterian movement, in the Protestant movement,"
4136,DEMOCRACY,world-wide? Was English Puritanism free from the same sort of
4137,DEMOCRACY,"characteristics, the things that are unrefined as belong to democratic"
4138,DEMOCRACY,"politics in another sphere? The method, the phenomena, are those that"
4139,DEMOCRACY,"belong to life universal, if life be free and efficient in moving masses"
4140,DEMOCRACY,"of men upward into more noble ranges. Men of the people lead, because"
4141,DEMOCRACY,"the people are the stake. On the other hand, educated leaders, however"
4142,DEMOCRACY,"well-intentioned, may be handicapped if they are not rooted deeply in"
4143,DEMOCRACY,"the popular soil. Literary education, it must never be forgotten, is not"
4144,DEMOCRACY,specially a preparation for political good judgment. It is predominantly
4145,DEMOCRACY,"concerned, in its high branches, with matters not of immediate political"
4146,DEMOCRACY,"consequence--with books generally, science, history, language, technical"
4147,DEMOCRACY,"processes and trades, professional outfits, and the manifold activity of"
4148,DEMOCRACY,"life not primarily practical, or if practical not necessarily political."
4149,DEMOCRACY,"Men of education, scholars especially, even in the field of political"
4150,DEMOCRACY,"system, are not by the mere fact of their scholarship highly or"
4151,DEMOCRACY,"peculiarly fitted to take part in the active leadership of politics,"
4152,DEMOCRACY,unless they have other qualifications not necessarily springing from
4153,DEMOCRACY,their pursuits in learning; they are naturally more engaged with ideas
4154,DEMOCRACY,"in a free state, theoretical ideas, than with ideas which are in reality"
4155,DEMOCRACY,as much a part of life as of thought; and the method of dealing with
4156,DEMOCRACY,"these vitalized and, as it were, adulterated ideas has a specialty of"
4157,DEMOCRACY,its own.
4158,DEMOCRACY,
4159,DEMOCRACY,"It must be acknowledged, too, that in the past, the educated class as a"
4160,DEMOCRACY,whole has commonly been found to entertain a narrow view; it has been on
4161,DEMOCRACY,"the side of the past, not of the future; previous to the revolutionary"
4162,DEMOCRACY,era the class was not--though it is now coming to be--a germinating
4163,DEMOCRACY,"element in reform, except in isolated cases of high genius which"
4164,DEMOCRACY,foresees the times to come and develops principles by which they come;
4165,DEMOCRACY,"it has been, even during our era, normally in alliance with property and"
4166,DEMOCRACY,"ancestry, to which it is commonly an appurtenance, and like them is"
4167,DEMOCRACY,"deeply engaged in the established order, under which it is comfortable,"
4168,DEMOCRACY,"enjoying the places there made for its functions, and is conservative of"
4169,DEMOCRACY,"the past, doubtful of the changing order, a hindrance, a brake, often a"
4170,DEMOCRACY,note of despair. I do not forget the great exceptions; but revolutions
4171,DEMOCRACY,"have come from below, from the masses and their native leaders, however"
4172,DEMOCRACY,"they may occasionally find some preparation in thinkers, and some"
4173,DEMOCRACY,welcome in aristocrats. The power of intellectual education as an
4174,DEMOCRACY,"element in life is always overvalued; and, within its sphere, which is"
4175,DEMOCRACY,"less than is represented, it is subject to error, prejudice, and"
4176,DEMOCRACY,"arrogance of its own; and, being without any necessary connection with"
4177,DEMOCRACY,"love or conscience, it has often been a reactionary, disturbing, or"
4178,DEMOCRACY,"selfish force in politics and events, even when well acquainted with the"
4179,DEMOCRACY,"field of politics, as ever were any of the forms of demagogy in the"
4180,DEMOCRACY,"popular life. Intelligence, in the form of high education, can make no"
4181,DEMOCRACY,"authoritative claim, as such, either by its nature, its history, or, as"
4182,DEMOCRACY,"a rule, its successful examples in character. The suffrage, except as by"
4183,DEMOCRACY,natural modes it embodies the people's practical and general
4184,DEMOCRACY,"intelligence, in direct decisions and in the representatives of"
4185,DEMOCRACY,"themselves whom it elects to serve the State, need not look to high"
4186,DEMOCRACY,"education as it has been in the privileged past, for light and leading"
4187,DEMOCRACY,"in matters of fundamental concern; education remains useful, as expert"
4188,DEMOCRACY,knowledge is always useful in matters presently to be acted on; but in
4189,DEMOCRACY,"so far as it is separable from the business of the State, and stands by"
4190,DEMOCRACY,itself in a class not servants of the State and mainly critical and
4191,DEMOCRACY,"traditionary, it is deserving of no special political trust because of"
4192,DEMOCRACY,"any superiority of judgment it may allege. In fact, education has"
4193,DEMOCRACY,"entered with beneficent effect into political life with the more power,"
4194,DEMOCRACY,"in proportion as it has become a common and not a special endowment, and"
4195,DEMOCRACY,"the enfranchisement of education, if I may use the term, is rather a"
4196,DEMOCRACY,"democratic than an aristocratic trait. Education, high education even,"
4197,DEMOCRACY,is more respected and counts for more in a democracy than under the
4198,DEMOCRACY,"older systems. But in a democracy it remains true, that so far as"
4199,DEMOCRACY,"education deserves weight, it will secure it by its own resources, and"
4200,DEMOCRACY,"enter into political results, as property does, with a power of its own."
4201,DEMOCRACY,"There, least of all, does it need privilege. Education is one inequality"
4202,DEMOCRACY,which democracy seems already dissolving.
4203,DEMOCRACY,
4204,DEMOCRACY,"What suffrage records, in opposition it may be to educated opinion, as"
4205,DEMOCRACY,"such, is the mental state of the people, and their choices of the men"
4206,DEMOCRACY,they trust with the accomplishment of what is to be done. If the
4207,DEMOCRACY,suffrage is exposed to defect in wisdom by reason of its dulness and
4208,DEMOCRACY,"ignorance, which I by no means admit, the remedy lies not in a"
4209,DEMOCRACY,"guardianship of the people by the educated class, but in popular"
4210,DEMOCRACY,"education itself, in lower forms, and the diffusion of that general"
4211,DEMOCRACY,"information which, in conjunction with sound morals, is all that is"
4212,DEMOCRACY,required for the comprehension of the great questions decided by
4213,DEMOCRACY,"suffrage, and the choice of fit leaders who shall carry the decisions"
4214,DEMOCRACY,"into effect. The vast increase of this kind of intelligence, bred of"
4215,DEMOCRACY,such schools and such means for the spread of political information as
4216,DEMOCRACY,"have grown up here, has been a measureless gain to man in many other"
4217,DEMOCRACY,"than political ways. No force has been so great, except the discussion"
4218,DEMOCRACY,of religious dogma and practice under the Reformation in northern
4219,DEMOCRACY,"nations, in establishing a mental habit throughout the community. The"
4220,DEMOCRACY,"suffrage also has this invaluable advantage, that it brings about a"
4221,DEMOCRACY,"substitution of the principle of persuasion for that of force, as the"
4222,DEMOCRACY,normal mode of dealing with important differences of view in State
4223,DEMOCRACY,"affairs; it is, in this respect, the corollary of free speech and the"
4224,DEMOCRACY,"preservative of that great element of liberty, and progress under"
4225,DEMOCRACY,"liberty, which is not otherwise well safe-guarded. It is also a"
4226,DEMOCRACY,"continuous thing, and deals with necessities and disagreements as they"
4227,DEMOCRACY,"arise and by gradual means, and thus, by preventing too great an"
4228,DEMOCRACY,"accumulation of discontent, it avoids revolution, containing in itself"
4229,DEMOCRACY,"the right of revolution in a peaceable form under law. It is, moreover,"
4230,DEMOCRACY,a school into which the citizen is slowly received; and it is capable of
4231,DEMOCRACY,"receiving great masses of men and accustoming them to political thought,"
4232,DEMOCRACY,"free and efficient action in political affairs, and a civic life in the"
4233,DEMOCRACY,"State, breeding in them responsibility for their own condition and that"
4234,DEMOCRACY,of the State. It is the voice of the people always speaking; nor is it
4235,DEMOCRACY,"to be forgotten, especially by those who fear it, that the questions"
4236,DEMOCRACY,"which come before the suffrage for settlement are, in view of the whole"
4237,DEMOCRACY,"complex and historic body of the State, comparatively few; for society"
4238,DEMOCRACY,"and its institutions, as the fathers handed them down, are accepted at"
4239,DEMOCRACY,"birth and by custom and with real veneration, as our birthright,--the"
4240,DEMOCRACY,"birthright of a race, a nation, and a hearth. The suffrage does not"
4241,DEMOCRACY,undertake to rebuild from the foundations; the people are slow to remove
4242,DEMOCRACY,old landmarks; but it does mean to modify and strengthen this
4243,DEMOCRACY,inheritance of past ages for the better accomplishment of the ends for
4244,DEMOCRACY,"which society exists, and the better distribution among men of the goods"
4245,DEMOCRACY,which it secures.
4246,DEMOCRACY,
4247,DEMOCRACY,"Fraternity, the third constituent of democracy, enforces the idea of"
4248,DEMOCRACY,"equality through its doctrine of brotherhood, and enlarges the idea of"
4249,DEMOCRACY,"liberty, which thus becomes more than an instrument for obtaining"
4250,DEMOCRACY,"private ends, is inspired with a social spirit and has bounds set to its"
4251,DEMOCRACY,"exercise. Fraternity leads us, in general, to share our good, and to"
4252,DEMOCRACY,provide others with the means of sharing in it. This good is
4253,DEMOCRACY,"inexhaustible and makes up welfare in the State, the common weal. It is"
4254,DEMOCRACY,"in the sphere of fraternity, in particular, that humanitarian ideas, and"
4255,DEMOCRACY,"those expressions of the social conscience which we call moral issues,"
4256,DEMOCRACY,"generally arise, and enter more or less completely into political life."
4257,DEMOCRACY,"In defining politics as, in the main, a selfish struggle of material"
4258,DEMOCRACY,"interests, this was reserved, that, from time to time, questions of a"
4259,DEMOCRACY,"higher order do arise, such as that of slavery in our history, which"
4260,DEMOCRACY,"have in them a finer element; and, though it be true that government has"
4261,DEMOCRACY,in charge a race which is yet so near to the soil that it is never far
4262,DEMOCRACY,"from want, and therefore government must concern itself directly and"
4263,DEMOCRACY,"continuously with arrangements for our material welfare, yet the higher"
4264,DEMOCRACY,life has so far developed that matters which concern it more intimately
4265,DEMOCRACY,"are within the sphere of political action, and among these we reckon all"
4266,DEMOCRACY,"those causes which appeal immediately to great principles, to liberty,"
4267,DEMOCRACY,"justice, and manhood, as things apart from material gain or loss, and in"
4268,DEMOCRACY,"our consciousness truly spiritual; and such a cause, preeminently, was"
4269,DEMOCRACY,"the war for the Union, heavy as it was with the fate of mankind under"
4270,DEMOCRACY,"democracy. In such crises, which seldom arise, material good is"
4271,DEMOCRACY,"subordinated for the time being, and life and property, our great"
4272,DEMOCRACY,"permanent interests, are held cheap in the balance with that which is"
4273,DEMOCRACY,"their great charter of value, as we conceive our country."
4274,DEMOCRACY,
4275,DEMOCRACY,Yet even here material interests are not far distant. Such issues are
4276,DEMOCRACY,"commonly found to be involved with material interests in conflict, or"
4277,DEMOCRACY,are alloyed with them in the working out; and these interests are a
4278,DEMOCRACY,"constituent, though, it may be, not the controlling matter. It is"
4279,DEMOCRACY,"commonly felt, indeed, that some warrant of material necessity is"
4280,DEMOCRACY,"required in any great political act, for politics, as has been said, is"
4281,DEMOCRACY,"an affair of life, not of free ideas; and without such a plain"
4282,DEMOCRACY,authorization reform is regarded as an invasion of personal liberty of
4283,DEMOCRACY,"thought, expression, or action, which is the breeding-place of"
4284,DEMOCRACY,progressive life and therefore carefully guarded from intrusion. In
4285,DEMOCRACY,proportion as the material interests are less clearly affected
4286,DEMOCRACY,"injuriously, a cause is removed into the region of moral suasion, and"
4287,DEMOCRACY,loses political vigour. Religious issues constitute the extreme of
4288,DEMOCRACY,"political action without regard to material interests, wars of"
4289,DEMOCRACY,"conversion being their ultimate, and they are more potent with less"
4290,DEMOCRACY,developed races. For this reason the humanitarian and moral sphere of
4291,DEMOCRACY,"fraternity lies generally outside of politics, in social institutions"
4292,DEMOCRACY,"and habits, which political action may sometimes favour as in public"
4293,DEMOCRACY,"charities, but which usually rely on other resources for their support."
4294,DEMOCRACY,"On occasions of crisis, however, a great idea may marshal the whole"
4295,DEMOCRACY,"community in its cause; and, more and more, the cause so championed"
4296,DEMOCRACY,under democracy is the spiritual right of man.
4297,DEMOCRACY,
4298,DEMOCRACY,"But fraternity finds, perhaps, its great seal of sovereignty in that"
4299,DEMOCRACY,"principle of persuasion which has been spoken of already, and in that"
4300,DEMOCRACY,"substitution of it for force, in the conduct of human affairs, which"
4301,DEMOCRACY,"democracy has made, as truly as it has replaced tyranny with the"
4302,DEMOCRACY,"authority of a delegated and representative liberty. Persuasion, in its"
4303,DEMOCRACY,"moral form, outside of politics,--which is so largely resorted to in a"
4304,DEMOCRACY,"community that does not naturally regard the imposition of virtue, even,"
4305,DEMOCRACY,"with favour, but believes virtue should be voluntary in the man and"
4306,DEMOCRACY,"decreed by him out of his own soul,--need not be enlarged upon here; but"
4307,DEMOCRACY,"in its intellectual form, as a persuasion of the mind and will"
4308,DEMOCRACY,"necessarily precedent to political action, it may be glanced at, since"
4309,DEMOCRACY,"law thus becomes the embodied persuasion of the community, and is itself"
4310,DEMOCRACY,"no longer force in the objectionable sense; even minorities, to which it"
4311,DEMOCRACY,"is adversely applied, and on which it thus operates like tyranny,"
4312,DEMOCRACY,recognize the different character it bears to arbitrary power as that
4313,DEMOCRACY,has historically been. But outside of this refinement of thought in the
4314,DEMOCRACY,"analysis, the fact that the normal attitude of any cause in a democracy"
4315,DEMOCRACY,"is that men must be persuaded of its justice and expediency, before it"
4316,DEMOCRACY,"can impose itself as the will of the State on its citizens, marks a"
4317,DEMOCRACY,"regard for men as a brotherhood of equals and freemen, of the highest"
4318,DEMOCRACY,"consequence in State affairs, and with a broad overflow of moral habit"
4319,DEMOCRACY,upon the rest of life.
4320,DEMOCRACY,
4321,DEMOCRACY,"That portion of the community which is not reached by persuasion, and"
4322,DEMOCRACY,"remains in opposition, must obey the law, and submit, such is the nature"
4323,DEMOCRACY,"of society; but minorities have acknowledged rights, which are best"
4324,DEMOCRACY,"preserved, perhaps, by the knowledge that they may be useful to all in"
4325,DEMOCRACY,turn. Those rights are more respected under democracy than in any other
4326,DEMOCRACY,"form of government. The important question here, however, is not the"
4327,DEMOCRACY,"conduct of the State toward an opposition in general, which is at one"
4328,DEMOCRACY,"time composed of one element and at another time of a different element,"
4329,DEMOCRACY,"and is a shifting, changeable, and temporary thing; but of its attitude"
4330,DEMOCRACY,toward the more permanent and inveterate minority existing in class
4331,DEMOCRACY,"interests, which are exposed to popular attack. The capital instance is"
4332,DEMOCRACY,"property, especially in the form of wealth; and here belongs that"
4333,DEMOCRACY,"objection to the suffrage, which was lightly passed over, to the effect"
4334,DEMOCRACY,"that, since the social will has no limits, to constitute it by suffrage"
4335,DEMOCRACY,"is to give the people control of what is not their own. Property,"
4336,DEMOCRACY,"reenforced by the right of inheritance, is the great source of"
4337,DEMOCRACY,"inequality in the State and the continuer of it, and gives rise"
4338,DEMOCRACY,"perpetually to political and social questions, attended with violent"
4339,DEMOCRACY,"passions; but it is an institution common to civilization, it is very"
4340,DEMOCRACY,"old, and it is bound up intimately with the motive energies of"
4341,DEMOCRACY,"individual life, the means of supplying society on a vast scale with"
4342,DEMOCRACY,"production, distribution, and communication, and the process of taking"
4343,DEMOCRACY,possession of the earth for man's use. Its social service is
4344,DEMOCRACY,"incalculable. At times, however, when accumulated so as to congest"
4345,DEMOCRACY,"society, property has been confiscated in enormous amounts, as in"
4346,DEMOCRACY,"England under Henry VIII, in France at the Revolution, and in Italy in"
4347,DEMOCRACY,recent times. The principle of paramount right over it in society has
4348,DEMOCRACY,"been established in men's minds, and is modified only by the"
4349,DEMOCRACY,social conviction that this right is one to be exercised with the
4350,DEMOCRACY,highest degree of care and on the plainest dictates of a just necessity.
4351,DEMOCRACY,"Taxation, nevertheless, though a power to destroy and confiscate in its"
4352,DEMOCRACY,"extreme exercise, normally takes nothing from property that is not due."
4353,DEMOCRACY,"It is not a levy of contributions, but the collection of a just debt;"
4354,DEMOCRACY,"for property and its owners are the great gainers by society, under"
4355,DEMOCRACY,"whose bond alone wealth finds security, enjoyment, and increase,"
4356,DEMOCRACY,carrying with them untold private advantages. Property is deeply
4357,DEMOCRACY,"indebted to society in a thousand ways; and, besides, much of its"
4358,DEMOCRACY,"material cannot be said to be earned, but was given either from the"
4359,DEMOCRACY,"great stores of nature, or by the hand of the law, conferring privilege,"
4360,DEMOCRACY,or from the overflowing increments of social progress. If it is
4361,DEMOCRACY,"naturally selfish, acquisitive, and conservative, if it has to be"
4362,DEMOCRACY,"subjected to control, if its duties have to be thrust upon it"
4363,DEMOCRACY,"oftentimes, it has such powers of resistance that there need be little"
4364,DEMOCRACY,"fear lest it should suffer injustice. Like education, it has great"
4365,DEMOCRACY,"reserves of influence, and is assured of enormous weight in the life of"
4366,DEMOCRACY,the community. Other vested interests stand in a similar relation to the
4367,DEMOCRACY,"State. These minorities, which are important and lasting elements in"
4368,DEMOCRACY,"society, receive consideration, and bounds are set to liberty of dealing"
4369,DEMOCRACY,"adversely with them in practice, under that principle of fraternity"
4370,DEMOCRACY,which seeks the good of one in all and the good of all in one.
4371,DEMOCRACY,
4372,DEMOCRACY,"Fraternity, following lines whose general sense has been sufficiently"
4373,DEMOCRACY,"indicated, has, in particular, established out of the common fund public"
4374,DEMOCRACY,"education as a means of diffusing intellectual gain, which is the great"
4375,DEMOCRACY,"element of growth even in efficient toil, and also of extending into all"
4376,DEMOCRACY,parts of the body politic a comprehension of the governmental scheme and
4377,DEMOCRACY,"the organized life of the community, fusing its separate interests in a"
4378,DEMOCRACY,"mutual understanding and regard. It has established, too, protection in"
4379,DEMOCRACY,"the law, for the weak as against the strong, the poor as against the"
4380,DEMOCRACY,"rich, the citizen as against those who would trustee the State for their"
4381,DEMOCRACY,"own benefit; and, on the broad scale, it provides for the preservation"
4382,DEMOCRACY,"of the public health, relief of the unfortunate, the care of all"
4383,DEMOCRACY,"children, and in a thousand humane ways permeates the law with its"
4384,DEMOCRACY,"salutary justice. It has, again, in another great field, established"
4385,DEMOCRACY,"toleration, not in religion merely, but of opinion and practice in"
4386,DEMOCRACY,general; and thereby largely has built up a mutual and pervading faith
4387,DEMOCRACY,in the community as a body in all its parts and interests intending
4388,DEMOCRACY,democratic results under human conditions; it has thus bred a habit of
4389,DEMOCRACY,"reserve at moments of hardship or grave difficulty,--a respect that"
4390,DEMOCRACY,"awaits social justice giving time for it to be brought about,--which as"
4391,DEMOCRACY,a constituent of national character cannot be too highly prized.
4392,DEMOCRACY,
4393,DEMOCRACY,"The object of all government, and of every social system is, in its end"
4394,DEMOCRACY,"and summary, to secure justice among mankind. Justice is the most sacred"
4395,DEMOCRACY,"word of men; but it is a thing hard to find. Law, which is its social"
4396,DEMOCRACY,"instrument, deals with external act, general conditions, and mankind in"
4397,DEMOCRACY,"the mass. It is not, like conscience, a searcher of men's bosoms; its"
4398,DEMOCRACY,knowledge extends no farther than to what shall illuminate the nature of
4399,DEMOCRACY,the event it examines; it makes no true ethical award. It is in the main
4400,DEMOCRACY,"a method of procedure, largely inherited and wholly practical in intent,"
4401,DEMOCRACY,applied to recurring states of fact; it is a reasonable arrangement for
4402,DEMOCRACY,the peaceful facilitation of human business of all social kinds; and to
4403,DEMOCRACY,"a considerable degree it is a convention, an agreement upon what shall"
4404,DEMOCRACY,"be done in certain sets of circumstances, as an approximation, it may"
4405,DEMOCRACY,"be, to justice, but, at all events, as an advantageous solution of"
4406,DEMOCRACY,difficulties. This is as true of its criminal as of its civil branches.
4407,DEMOCRACY,"Its concern is with society rather than the individual, and it"
4408,DEMOCRACY,"sacrifices the individual to society without compunction, applying one"
4409,DEMOCRACY,"rule to all alike, with a view to social, not individual, results, on"
4410,DEMOCRACY,the broad scale. Those matters which make individual justice
4411,DEMOCRACY,"impossible,--especially the element of personal responsibility in"
4412,DEMOCRACY,"wrong-doing, how the man came to be what he is and his susceptibility to"
4413,DEMOCRACY,"motives, to reason and to passion, in their varieties, and all such"
4414,DEMOCRACY,"considerations,--law ignores in the main question, however it may admit"
4415,DEMOCRACY,"them in the imperfect form in which only they can be known, as"
4416,DEMOCRACY,circumstances in extenuation or aggravation. This large part of
4417,DEMOCRACY,"responsibility, it will seem to every reflective moralist, enters little"
4418,DEMOCRACY,"into the law's survey; and its penalties, at best, are ""the rack of"
4419,DEMOCRACY,"this rude world."" Death and imprisonment, as it inflicts them, are for"
4420,DEMOCRACY,"the protection of society, not for reformation, though the philanthropic"
4421,DEMOCRACY,element in the State may use the period of imprisonment with a view to
4422,DEMOCRACY,"reformation; nor in the history of the punishment of crime, of the"
4423,DEMOCRACY,vengeance as such taken on men in addition to the social protection
4424,DEMOCRACY,"sought, has society on the whole been less brutal in its repulse of its"
4425,DEMOCRACY,"enemies than they were in their attack, or shown any eminent justice"
4426,DEMOCRACY,toward its victims in the sphere of their own lives. It is a terrible
4427,DEMOCRACY,"and debasing record, up to this century at least, and uniformly"
4428,DEMOCRACY,corrupted those who were its own instruments. It was the application of
4429,DEMOCRACY,"force in its most material forms, and dehumanized those upon whom it was"
4430,DEMOCRACY,"exercised, placing them outside the pale of manhood as a preliminary to"
4431,DEMOCRACY,"its work. The lesson that the criminal remains a man, was one taught to"
4432,DEMOCRACY,"the law, not learned from it. On the civil side, likewise, similar"
4433,DEMOCRACY,"reservations must be made, both as regards its formulation and"
4434,DEMOCRACY,operation. The law as an instrument of justice is a rough way of dealing
4435,DEMOCRACY,"with the problems of the individual in society, but it is effective for"
4436,DEMOCRACY,"social ends; and, in its total body and practical results, it is a"
4437,DEMOCRACY,"priceless monument of human righteousness, sagacity, and mercy, and"
4438,DEMOCRACY,"though it lags behind opinion, as it must, and postpones to a new age"
4439,DEMOCRACY,"the moral and prudential convictions of the present, it is in its"
4440,DEMOCRACY,treasury that these at last are stored.
4441,DEMOCRACY,
4442,DEMOCRACY,"If such be the case within the law, what indifference to justice does"
4443,DEMOCRACY,the course of events exhibit in the world at large which comes under the
4444,DEMOCRACY,"law's inquisition so imperfectly! How continuous and inevitable, how"
4445,DEMOCRACY,"terrible and pitiful is this aspect of life, is shown in successive ages"
4446,DEMOCRACY,"by the unending story of ideal tragedy, in poem, drama, and tale, in"
4447,DEMOCRACY,"which the noble nature through some frailty, that was but a part, and by"
4448,DEMOCRACY,"the impulse of some moment of brief time, comes to its wreck; and, in"
4449,DEMOCRACY,"connection with this disaster to the best, lies the action of the"
4450,DEMOCRACY,villain everywhere overflowing in suffering and injury upon his victims
4451,DEMOCRACY,and all that is theirs. What is here represented as the general lot of
4452,DEMOCRACY,"mankind, in ideal works, exists, multiplied world-wide in the lives and"
4453,DEMOCRACY,"fortunes of mankind, an inestimable amount of injustice always"
4454,DEMOCRACY,present. The sacrifice of innocence is in no way lessened by aught of
4455,DEMOCRACY,vengeance that may overtake the wrong-doer; and it is constant. The
4456,DEMOCRACY,"murdered man, the wronged woman, can find no reparation. What shall one"
4457,DEMOCRACY,"say of the sufferings of children and of the old, and of the great curse"
4458,DEMOCRACY,that lies in heredity and the circumstances of early life under
4459,DEMOCRACY,"depraved, ignorant, or malicious conditions? These brutalities, like the"
4460,DEMOCRACY,"primeval struggle in the rise of life, seem in a world that never heard"
4461,DEMOCRACY,the name of justice. The main seat of individual justice and its
4462,DEMOCRACY,"operation is, after all, in the moral sense of men, governing their own"
4463,DEMOCRACY,conduct and modifying so far as possible the mass of injustice
4464,DEMOCRACY,"continually arising in the process of life, by such relief as they can"
4465,DEMOCRACY,give by personal influence and action both on persons and in the realm
4466,DEMOCRACY,of moral opinion.
4467,DEMOCRACY,
4468,DEMOCRACY,"But, such questions apart, and within the reach of the rude power of the"
4469,DEMOCRACY,"law over men in the mass, where individuality may be neglected, there"
4470,DEMOCRACY,remains that portion of the field in which the cause of justice may be
4471,DEMOCRACY,"advanced, as it was in the extinction of slavery, the confiscation of"
4472,DEMOCRACY,"the French lands, the abolition of the poor debtor laws, and in similar"
4473,DEMOCRACY,"great measures of class legislation, if you will. I confess I am one of"
4474,DEMOCRACY,those who hold that society is largely responsible even for crime and
4475,DEMOCRACY,"pauperism, and especially other less clearly defined conditions in the"
4476,DEMOCRACY,community by which there exists an inveterate injustice ingrained in the
4477,DEMOCRACY,structure of society itself. The process of freeing man from the fetters
4478,DEMOCRACY,"of the past is still incomplete, and democracy is a faith still early in"
4479,DEMOCRACY,its manifestation; social justice is the cry under which this progress
4480,DEMOCRACY,"is made, and, being grounded in material conditions and hot with men's"
4481,DEMOCRACY,"passions under wrong, it is a dangerous cry, and unheeded it becomes"
4482,DEMOCRACY,revolutionary; but in what has democracy been so beneficent to society
4483,DEMOCRACY,as in the ways without number that it has opened for the doing of
4484,DEMOCRACY,"justice to men in masses, for the moulding of safe and orderly methods"
4485,DEMOCRACY,"of change, and for the formation as a part of human character of a habit"
4486,DEMOCRACY,of philanthropy to those especially whose misfortunes may be partly laid
4487,DEMOCRACY,"to the door of society itself? Charity, great as it is, can but"
4488,DEMOCRACY,"alleviate, it cannot upon any scale cure poverty and its attendant ills;"
4489,DEMOCRACY,"nor can mercy, however humanely and wisely exerted, do more than"
4490,DEMOCRACY,mollify the misfortune that abides in the criminal. Social justice asks
4491,DEMOCRACY,"neither charity nor mercy, but such conditions, embodied in institutions"
4492,DEMOCRACY,"and laws, as shall diminish, so far as under nature and human nature is"
4493,DEMOCRACY,"possible, the differences of men at birth, and in their education, and"
4494,DEMOCRACY,"in their opportunity through life, to the end that all citizens shall be"
4495,DEMOCRACY,"equal in the power to begin and conduct their lives in morals, industry,"
4496,DEMOCRACY,"and the hope of happiness. Social justice, so defined, under temporal"
4497,DEMOCRACY,"conditions, democracy seeks as the sum and substance of its effort in"
4498,DEMOCRACY,governmental ways; some advance has been made; but it requires no wide
4499,DEMOCRACY,"survey, nor long examination, to see that what has been accomplished is"
4500,DEMOCRACY,"a beginning, with the end so far in the future as to seem a dream, such"
4501,DEMOCRACY,as the poets have sung almost from the dawn of hope. What matters it? It
4502,DEMOCRACY,is not only poets who dream; justice is the statesman's dream.
4503,DEMOCRACY,
4504,DEMOCRACY,Such in bold outline are the principles of democracy. They have been
4505,DEMOCRACY,"working now for a century in a great nation, not wholly unfettered and"
4506,DEMOCRACY,"on a complete scale even with us, but with wider acceptance and broader"
4507,DEMOCRACY,"application than elsewhere in the world, and with most prosperity in"
4508,DEMOCRACY,those parts of the country where they are most mastering; and the nation
4509,DEMOCRACY,"has grown great in their charge. What, in brief, are the results, so"
4510,DEMOCRACY,"clear, so grand, so vast, that they stand out like mountain ranges, the"
4511,DEMOCRACY,configuration of a national life? The diffusion of material comfort
4512,DEMOCRACY,"among masses of men, on a scale and to an amount abolishing peasantry"
4513,DEMOCRACY,"forever; the dissemination of education, which is the means of life to"
4514,DEMOCRACY,"the mind as comfort is to the body, in no more narrow bounds, but"
4515,DEMOCRACY,"through the State universal, abolishing ignorance; the development of"
4516,DEMOCRACY,"human capacity in intelligence, energy, and character, under the"
4517,DEMOCRACY,"stimulus of the open career, with a result in enlarging and"
4518,DEMOCRACY,concentrating the available talent of the State to a compass and with an
4519,DEMOCRACY,efficiency and diversity by which alone was possible the material
4520,DEMOCRACY,subjugation of the continent which it has made tributary to man's life;
4521,DEMOCRACY,"the planting of self-respect in millions of men, and of respect for"
4522,DEMOCRACY,"others grounded in self-respect, constituting a national characteristic"
4523,DEMOCRACY,"now first to be found, and to be found in the bosom of every child of"
4524,DEMOCRACY,"our soil, and, with this, of a respect for womanhood, making the common"
4525,DEMOCRACY,"ways safe and honourable for her, unknown before; the moulding of a"
4526,DEMOCRACY,"conservative force, so sure, so deep, so instinctive, that it has its"
4527,DEMOCRACY,seat in the very vitals of the State and there maintains as its blood
4528,DEMOCRACY,and bone the principles which the fathers handed down in institutions
4529,DEMOCRACY,"containing our happiness, security, and destiny, yet maintains them as a"
4530,DEMOCRACY,"living present, not as a dead past; the incorporation into our body"
4531,DEMOCRACY,"politic of millions of half-alien people, without disturbance, and with"
4532,DEMOCRACY,an assimilating power that proves the universal value of democracy as a
4533,DEMOCRACY,"mode of dealing with the race, as it now is; an enthronement of reason"
4534,DEMOCRACY,"as the sole arbiter in a free forum where every man may plead, and have"
4535,DEMOCRACY,the judgment of all men upon the cause; a rooted repugnance to use
4536,DEMOCRACY,force; an aversion to war; a public and private generosity that knows no
4537,DEMOCRACY,"bounds of sect, race, or climate; a devotion to public duty that excuses"
4538,DEMOCRACY,"no man and least of all the best, and has constantly raised the standard"
4539,DEMOCRACY,of character; a commiseration for all unfortunate peoples and warm
4540,DEMOCRACY,sympathy with them in their struggles; a love of country as
4541,DEMOCRACY,inexhaustible in sacrifice as it is unparalleled in ardour; and a will
4542,DEMOCRACY,to serve the world for the rise of man into such manhood as we have
4543,DEMOCRACY,"achieved, such prosperity as earth has yielded us, and such justice as,"
4544,DEMOCRACY,"by the grace of heaven, is established within our borders. Is it not a"
4545,DEMOCRACY,"great work? and all these blessings, unconfined as the element, belong"
4546,DEMOCRACY,"to all our people. In the course of these results, the imperfection of"
4547,DEMOCRACY,human nature and its institutions has been present; but a just
4548,DEMOCRACY,"comparison of our history with that of other nations, ages, and systems,"
4549,DEMOCRACY,"and of our present with our past, shows that such imperfection in"
4550,DEMOCRACY,"society has been a diminishing element with us, and that a steady"
4551,DEMOCRACY,"progress has been made in methods, measures, and men. No great issue, in"
4552,DEMOCRACY,"a whole century, has been brought to a wrong conclusion. Our public life"
4553,DEMOCRACY,"has been starred with illustrious names, famous for honesty, sagacity,"
4554,DEMOCRACY,"and humanity, and, above all, for justice. Our Presidents in particular"
4555,DEMOCRACY,"have been such men as democracy should breed, and some of them such men"
4556,DEMOCRACY,"as humanity has seldom bred. We are a proud nation, and justly; and,"
4557,DEMOCRACY,"looking to the future, beholding these things multiplied million-fold"
4558,DEMOCRACY,"in the lives of the children of the land to be, we may well humbly own"
4559,DEMOCRACY,"God's bounty which has earliest fallen upon us, the first fruits of"
4560,DEMOCRACY,democracy in the new ages of a humaner world.
4561,DEMOCRACY,
4562,DEMOCRACY,It will be plain to those who have read what has elsewhere been said of
4563,DEMOCRACY,"the ideal life, that democracy is for the nation a true embodiment of"
4564,DEMOCRACY,"that life, and wears its characteristics upon its sleeve. In it the"
4565,DEMOCRACY,"individual mingles with the mass, and becomes one with mankind, and"
4566,DEMOCRACY,mankind itself sums the totality of individual good in a well-nigh
4567,DEMOCRACY,perfect way. In it there is the slow embodiment of a future nobly
4568,DEMOCRACY,conceived and brought into existence on an ideal basis of the best that
4569,DEMOCRACY,"is, from age to age, in man's power. It includes the universal wisdom,"
4570,DEMOCRACY,"the reach of thought and aspiration, by virtue of which men climb, and"
4571,DEMOCRACY,here manhood climbs. It knows no limit; it rejects no man who wears the
4572,DEMOCRACY,form Christ wore; it receives all into its benediction. Through
4573,DEMOCRACY,"democracy, more readily and more plainly than through any other system"
4574,DEMOCRACY,"of government or conception of man's nature and destiny, the best of men"
4575,DEMOCRACY,"may blend with his race, and store in their common life the energies of"
4576,DEMOCRACY,"his own soul, looking for as much aid as he may give. Democracy, as"
4577,DEMOCRACY,"elsewhere has been said, is the earthly hope of men; and they who stand"
4578,DEMOCRACY,"apart, in fancied superiority to mankind, which is by creation equal in"
4579,DEMOCRACY,"destiny, and in fact equal in the larger part of human nature, however"
4580,DEMOCRACY,"obstructed by time and circumstance, are foolish withdrawers from the"
4581,DEMOCRACY,"ways of life. On the battle-field or in the senate, or in the humblest"
4582,DEMOCRACY,"cabin of the West, to lead an American life is to join heart and soul in"
4583,DEMOCRACY,this cause.

4588,THE RIDE,THE RIDE
4589,THE RIDE,
4590,THE RIDE,
4591,THE RIDE,"Mystery is the natural habitat of the soul. It is the child's element,"
4592,THE RIDE,"though he sees it not; for, year by year, acquiring the solid and"
4593,THE RIDE,"palpable, the visible and audible, the things of mortal life, he lives"
4594,THE RIDE,"in horizons of the senses, and though grown a youth he still looks"
4595,THE RIDE,intellectually for things definite and clear. Education in general
4596,THE RIDE,"through its whole period induces the contempt of all else, impressing"
4597,THE RIDE,"almost universally the positive element in life, whose realm in early"
4598,THE RIDE,years at least is sensual. So it was with me: the mind's eye saw all
4599,THE RIDE,"that was or might be in an atmosphere of scepticism, as my bodily eye"
4600,THE RIDE,beheld the world washed in colour. Yet the habitual sense of mystery in
4601,THE RIDE,"man's life is a measure of wisdom in the man; and, at last, if the mind"
4602,THE RIDE,"be open and turn upon the poles of truth, whether in the sage's"
4603,THE RIDE,knowledge or the poet's emotion or such common experience of the world
4604,THE RIDE,"as all have, mystery visibly envelops us, equally in the globed sky or"
4605,THE RIDE,"the unlighted spirit,"
4606,THE RIDE,
4607,THE RIDE,I well remember the very moment when a poetical experience precipitated
4608,THE RIDE,"this conviction out of moods long familiar, but obscurely felt and"
4609,THE RIDE,deeply distrusted. I was born and bred by the sea; its mystery had
4610,THE RIDE,"passed into my being unawares, and was there unconscious, or, at least,"
4611,THE RIDE,not to be separated from the moods of my own spirit. But on my first
4612,THE RIDE,"Italian voyage, day by day we rolled upon the tremendous billows of a"
4613,THE RIDE,"stormy sea, and all was strange and solemn--the illimitable tossing of a"
4614,THE RIDE,"wave-world, darkening night after night through weird sunsets of a"
4615,THE RIDE,"spectral and unknown beauty, enchantments that were doorways of a new"
4616,THE RIDE,"earth and new heavens; and, on the tenth day, when I came on deck in"
4617,THE RIDE,"this water-world, we had sighted Santa Maria, the southernmost of the"
4618,THE RIDE,"Azores, and gradually we drew near to it. I shall never forget the"
4619,THE RIDE,strangeness of that sight--that solitary island under the sunlit showers
4620,THE RIDE,of early morning; it lay in a beautiful atmosphere of belted mists and
4621,THE RIDE,"wreaths of rain, and tracts of soft sky, frequent with many near and"
4622,THE RIDE,distant rainbows that shone and faded and came again as we steamed
4623,THE RIDE,"through them, and the white wings of the birds, struck by the sun, were"
4624,THE RIDE,"the whitest objects I have ever seen; slowly we passed by, and I could"
4625,THE RIDE,not have told what it was in that island scene which had so arrested me.
4626,THE RIDE,"But when, some days afterward, at the harbor of Gibraltar I looked upon"
4627,THE RIDE,"the magnificent rock, and saw opposite the purple hills of Africa, again"
4628,THE RIDE,I felt through me that unknown thrill. It was the mystery of the land.
4629,THE RIDE,"It was altogether a discovery, a direct perception, a new sense of the"
4630,THE RIDE,natural world. Under the wild heights of Sangue di Christo I had dreamed
4631,THE RIDE,"that on the further side I should find the ""far west"" that had fled"
4632,THE RIDE,"before me beyond the river, the prairies, and the plains; but there was"
4633,THE RIDE,"no such mystery in the thought, or in the prospect, as this that saluted"
4634,THE RIDE,me coming landward for the first time from the ocean-world. Since that
4635,THE RIDE,"morning in the Straits, every horizon has been a mystery to me, to the"
4636,THE RIDE,spirit no less than to the eye; and truths have come to me like that
4637,THE RIDE,"lone island embosomed in eternal waters, like the capes and mountain"
4638,THE RIDE,"barriers of Africa thrusting up new continents unknown, untravelled, of"
4639,THE RIDE,a land men yet might tread as common ground.
4640,THE RIDE,
4641,THE RIDE,"""A poet's mood""--I know what once I should have said. But mystery I then"
4642,THE RIDE,"accepted as the only complement, the encompassment, of what we know of"
4643,THE RIDE,"our life. In many ways I had drawn near to this belief before, and I"
4644,THE RIDE,"have since many times confirmed it. One occasion, however, stands out in"
4645,THE RIDE,my memory even more intensely than those I have made bold to
4646,THE RIDE,"mention,--one experience that brought me near to my mother earth, as"
4647,THE RIDE,"that out of which I was formed and to which I shall return, and made"
4648,THE RIDE,these things seem as natural as to draw my breath from the sister
4649,THE RIDE,"element of air. I had returned to the West; and while there, wandering"
4650,THE RIDE,"in various places, I went to a small town, hardly more than a hamlet,"
4651,THE RIDE,"some few hundred miles beyond the Missouri, where the mighty railroad,"
4652,THE RIDE,"putting out a long feeler for the future, had halted its great steel"
4653,THE RIDE,branch--sinking like a thunderbolt into the ground for no imaginable
4654,THE RIDE,"reason, and affecting me vaguely with a sense of utmost limits. There a"
4655,THE RIDE,"younger friend, five years my junior, in his lonely struggle with life"
4656,THE RIDE,"bore to live, in such a camp of pioneer civilization as made my heart"
4657,THE RIDE,"fail at first sight, though not unused to the meagreness, crudity, and"
4658,THE RIDE,hardness of such a place; but there I had come to take the warm welcome
4659,THE RIDE,of his hands and look once more into his face before time should part
4660,THE RIDE,"us. He flung his arms about me, with a look of the South in his eyes,"
4661,THE RIDE,"full of happy dancing lights, and the barren scene was like Italy made"
4662,THE RIDE,real for one instant of golden time.
4663,THE RIDE,
4664,THE RIDE,"But if we had wandered momentarily, as if out of some quiet sunlit"
4665,THE RIDE,"gallery of Monte Beni, I soon found it was into the frontier of our"
4666,THE RIDE,"western border. A herd of Texas ponies were to be immediately on sale,"
4667,THE RIDE,"and I went to see them--wild animals, beautiful in their wildness, who"
4668,THE RIDE,"had never known bit or spur; they were lariated and thrown down, as the"
4669,THE RIDE,"buyers picked them out, and then led and pulled away to man's life. It"
4670,THE RIDE,"was a typical scene: the pen, the hundred ponies bunched together and"
4671,THE RIDE,"startled with the new surroundings, the cowboys whose resolute habit sat"
4672,THE RIDE,"on them like cotillion grace--athletes in the grain--with the gray,"
4673,THE RIDE,"close garb for use, the cigarette like a slow spark under the broad"
4674,THE RIDE,"sombrero, the belted revolver, the lasso hung loose-coiled in the hand,"
4675,THE RIDE,"quiet, careless, confident, with the ease of the master in his craft,"
4676,THE RIDE,"now pulling down a pony without a struggle, and now showing strength and"
4677,THE RIDE,"dexterity against frightened resistance; but the hour sped on, and our"
4678,THE RIDE,"spoil was two of these creatures, so attractive to me at least that"
4679,THE RIDE,"every moment my friend's eye was on me, and he kept saying, ""They're"
4680,THE RIDE,"wild, mind!"" The next morning in the dark dawn we had them in harness,"
4681,THE RIDE,"and drove out, when the stars were scarce gone from the sky, due north"
4682,THE RIDE,"to the Bad Lands, to give me a new experience of the vast American land"
4683,THE RIDE,"that bore us both, and made us, despite the thousands of miles that"
4684,THE RIDE,"stretched between ocean and prairie, brothers in blood and"
4685,THE RIDE,"brain,--brothers and friends."
4686,THE RIDE,
4687,THE RIDE,"Yet how to tell that ride, now grown a shining leaf of my book of"
4688,THE RIDE,"memory! for my eyes were fascinated with the land, in the high blowing"
4689,THE RIDE,"August wind, full of coolness and upland strength, like new breath in my"
4690,THE RIDE,"nostrils; and forward over the broken country, fenceless, illimitable,"
4691,THE RIDE,"ran the brown road, like a ploughed ribbon of soil, into the distance,"
4692,THE RIDE,"where pioneer and explorer and prospector had gone before, and now the"
4693,THE RIDE,"farmer was thinly settling,--the new America growing up before my eyes!"
4694,THE RIDE,"and him only by me to make me not a stranger there, with talk of absent"
4695,THE RIDE,"friends and old times, though scarce the long age of a college course"
4696,THE RIDE,"had gone by,--talk lapsing as of old on such rides into serious strains,"
4697,THE RIDE,"problems such as the young talk of together and keep their secret,"
4698,THE RIDE,"learning life,--the troubles of the heart of youth. And if now I recur"
4699,THE RIDE,"to some of the themes we touched on, and set down these memoranda,"
4700,THE RIDE,"fragments of life, thinking they may be of use to other youths as they"
4701,THE RIDE,"were then to us, I trust they will lose no privacy; for, as I write, I"
4702,THE RIDE,"see them in that place, with that noble prospect, that high sky, and him"
4703,THE RIDE,beside me whose young listening yet seems to woo them from my breast.
4704,THE RIDE,
4705,THE RIDE,"We mounted the five-mile ridge,--and, ""Poor Robin,"" he said, ""what of"
4706,THE RIDE,"him?"" ""Poor Robin sleeps in the Muses' graveyard,"" I laughed, ""in the"
4707,THE RIDE,soft gray ashes of my blazing hearth. One must live the life before he
4708,THE RIDE,"tells the tale."" ""I loved his 'awakening,'"" he replied, ""and I have"
4709,THE RIDE,"often thought of it by myself. And will nothing come of him now?"" ""Who"
4710,THE RIDE,"can tell?"" I said, looking hard off over the prairie. ""The Muses must"
4711,THE RIDE,"care for their own. That 'awakening,'"" I went on, after a moment of"
4712,THE RIDE,"wondering why the distant stream of the valley was called ""the"
4713,THE RIDE,"Looking-glass,"" and learning only that such was its name, ""was when"
4714,THE RIDE,after the bookish torpor of his mind--you remember he called books his
4715,THE RIDE,opiates--he felt the beauty of the spring and the marvel of human
4716,THE RIDE,service come back on him like a flood. It was the growing consciousness
4717,THE RIDE,of how little of life is our own. Youth takes life for granted; the hand
4718,THE RIDE,"that smoothed his pillow the long happy years, the springs that brought"
4719,THE RIDE,"new blossoms to his cheeks, the common words that martyr and patriot"
4720,THE RIDE,"have died to form on childish lips, and make them native there with"
4721,THE RIDE,"life's first breath, are natural to him as Christmas gifts, and bring no"
4722,THE RIDE,obligation. Our life from babyhood is only one long lesson in
4723,THE RIDE,indebtedness; and we best learn what we have received by what we give.
4724,THE RIDE,This was dawning on my hero then. I recall how he ran the new passion.
4725,THE RIDE,"That outburst you used to like, amid the green bloom of the prairies,"
4726,THE RIDE,"like the misted birches at home, under the heaven-wide warmth of April"
4727,THE RIDE,"breathing with universal mildness through the softened air--why, you can"
4728,THE RIDE,"remember the very day,"" I said. ""It was one--"" ""Yes, I can remember more"
4729,THE RIDE,"than that,"" he interrupted; ""I know the words, or some of them; what you"
4730,THE RIDE,"just said was the old voice--tang and colour--Poor Robin's voice;"" and"
4731,THE RIDE,"he began, and I listened to the words, which had once been mine, and now"
4732,THE RIDE,were his.
4733,THE RIDE,
4734,THE RIDE,"""By heaven, I never believed it. 'Clotho spins, Lachesis weaves, and"
4735,THE RIDE,"Atropos cuts,' I said, 'and the poor illusion vanishes; the loud"
4736,THE RIDE,"laughter, the fierce wailing, die on pale lips; the foolish and the"
4737,THE RIDE,"wise, the merciful and the pitiless, the workers in the vineyard and the"
4738,THE RIDE,"idlers in the market-place, are huddled into one grave, and the heart of"
4739,THE RIDE,Mary Mother and of Mary Magdalen are one dust.' Duly in those years the
4740,THE RIDE,sun rose to cheer me; the breath of the free winds was in my nostrils;
4741,THE RIDE,the grass made my pathways soft to my feet. Spring with its blossomed
4742,THE RIDE,"fruit trees, and the ungarnered summer, gladdened me; the flame of"
4743,THE RIDE,"autumn was my torch of memory, and winter lighted my lamp of solitude."
4744,THE RIDE,"Men tilled the fields to feed me, and worked the loom to clothe me, and"
4745,THE RIDE,"so far as in them was power and in me was need, brought to my doors"
4746,THE RIDE,sustenance for the body and whatsoever of divine truth was theirs for my
4747,THE RIDE,soul. Women ministered to me in blessed charities; and some among my
4748,THE RIDE,fellows gave me their souls in keeping. How true is that which my friend
4749,THE RIDE,"said to the poor boy-murderer condemned to die,--'I tell you, you cannot"
4750,THE RIDE,"escape the mercy of God;' and tears coursed down the imbruted face, and"
4751,THE RIDE,"once more the human soul, that the ministers of God could not reach,"
4752,THE RIDE,shone in its tabernacle. Now the butterfly has flown in at the
4753,THE RIDE,"tavern-window, and rebuked me. I go out, and on the broad earth the warm"
4754,THE RIDE,sun shines; the spring moves throughout our northern globe as when first
4755,THE RIDE,man looked upon it; the seasons keep their word; the birds know their
4756,THE RIDE,pathways through the air; the animals feed and multiply; the succession
4757,THE RIDE,of day and night has no shadow of turning; the stars keep their order in
4758,THE RIDE,the blue depths of infinite space; Sirius has not swerved from his
4759,THE RIDE,"course, nor Aldebaran flamed beyond his sphere; nature puts forth her"
4760,THE RIDE,"strength in all the vast compass of her domain, and is manifest in life"
4761,THE RIDE,"that continues and is increased in fuller measures of joy, heightened to"
4762,THE RIDE,"fairer beauty, instinct with love in the heart of man. Wiser were the"
4763,THE RIDE,ascetics whom I used to scorn; they made themselves ascetics of the
4764,THE RIDE,"body, but I have been an ascetic of the soul."""

4766,THE RIDE,*       *       *       *       *
4767,THE RIDE,
4768,THE RIDE,"""_Eccola!_"" I said, ""was it like that? But a heady rhetoric is not"
4769,THE RIDE,"inconsistent with sobriety of thought, as many a Victorian page we have"
4770,THE RIDE,read together testifies. The style tames with the spirit; and wild blood
4771,THE RIDE,is not the worst of faults in poets or boys. But I will change old coin
4772,THE RIDE,"for the new mintage with you, if you like, and it is not so very"
4773,THE RIDE,"different. There is a good stretch ahead, and the ponies never seem to"
4774,THE RIDE,"misbehave both at once."" In fact, these ponies, who seemed to enjoy the"
4775,THE RIDE,"broad, open world with us, had yet to learn the first lesson of"
4776,THE RIDE,"civilization, and unite their private wills in rebellion; for, while one"
4777,THE RIDE,or the other of them would from time to time fling back his heels and
4778,THE RIDE,"prepare to resist, the other dragged him into the course with the steady"
4779,THE RIDE,"pace, and, under hand and voice, they kept going in a much less"
4780,THE RIDE,adventurous way than I had anticipated. And so I read a page or two from
4781,THE RIDE,"the small blank-book in which I used to write, saying only, by way of"
4782,THE RIDE,"preface, that the April morning my friend so well remembered marked the"
4783,THE RIDE,time when I began that direct appeal to life of which these notes were
4784,THE RIDE,the first-fruits.
4785,THE RIDE,
4786,THE RIDE,The waters of the Looking-glass had been lost behind its bluffs to the
4787,THE RIDE,"west as we turned inland, though we still rose with the slope of the"
4788,THE RIDE,"valley; and now on higher land we saw the open country in a broad sweep,"
4789,THE RIDE,but with bolder configuration than was familiar to me in prairie
4790,THE RIDE,"regions, the rolling of the country being in great swells; and this"
4791,THE RIDE,"slight touch of strangeness, this accentuation of the motionless lines"
4792,THE RIDE,"of height and hollow, and the general lift of the land, perhaps, was"
4793,THE RIDE,"what first gave that life to the soil, that sense of a presence in the"
4794,THE RIDE,"earth itself, which was felt at a later time. Then I saw only the"
4795,THE RIDE,"outspread region, with here and there a gleam of grain on side-hills and"
4796,THE RIDE,"far-curved embrasures of the folded slopes, or great strands of Indian"
4797,THE RIDE,"corn, acres within acres, and hardly a human dwelling anywhere; the"
4798,THE RIDE,"loneliness, the majesty, the untouched primitiveness of it, were the"
4799,THE RIDE,"elements I remember; and the wind, and the unclouded great expanse of"
4800,THE RIDE,"the blue upper sky, like a separate element lifted in deep color over"
4801,THE RIDE,"the gold of harvest, the green of earth, and the touches of brown road"
4802,THE RIDE,"and soil. So, with pauses for common sights and things, and some word of"
4803,THE RIDE,comment and fuller statement and personal touches that do not matter
4804,THE RIDE,"now, I read my brief notes of life in its most sacred part."
4805,THE RIDE,
4806,THE RIDE,"""The gift of life at birth is only a little breath on a baby's lips; the"
4807,THE RIDE,"air asks no consent to fill the lungs, the heart beats, the senses"
4808,THE RIDE,"awaken, the mind begins, and the first handwriting of life is a child's"
4809,THE RIDE,"smile; but as boyhood gathers fuller strength, and youth hives a more"
4810,THE RIDE,"intimate sweetness, and manhood expands in richer values, life is not"
4811,THE RIDE,less entirely a gift. As well say a self-born as a self-made man. Nature
4812,THE RIDE,"does not intrust to us her bodily processes and functions, and the"
4813,THE RIDE,"fountains of feeling within well up, and the forms of thought define,"
4814,THE RIDE,without obligation to man's wisdom; body and soul alike are above his
4815,THE RIDE,"will--our garment of sense comes from no human loom, nor were the bones"
4816,THE RIDE,"of the spirit fashioned by any mortal hands; in our progress and growth,"
4817,THE RIDE,"too, bloom of health and charm of soul owe their loveliness to that law"
4818,THE RIDE,of grace that went forth with the creative word. Slow as men are to
4819,THE RIDE,"realize the fact and the magnitude of this great grant, and the supreme"
4820,THE RIDE,"value of it as life itself in all its abundance of blessings, there"
4821,THE RIDE,comes a time to every generous and open heart when the youth is made
4822,THE RIDE,aware of the stream of beneficence flowing in upon him from the forms
4823,THE RIDE,"and forces of nature with benedictions of beauty and vigour; he knows,"
4824,THE RIDE,"too, the cherishing of human service all about him in familiar love and"
4825,THE RIDE,"the large brothering of man's general toil; he begins to see, shaping"
4826,THE RIDE,"itself in him, the vast tradition of the past,--its mighty sheltering of"
4827,THE RIDE,"mankind in institution and doctrine and accepted hopes, its fostering"
4828,THE RIDE,"agencies, its driving energies. What a breaking out there is then in him"
4829,THE RIDE,"of the emotions that are fountain-heads of permanent life,--filial love,"
4830,THE RIDE,"patriotic duty, man's passion for humanity! It is then that he becomes a"
4831,THE RIDE,"man. Strange would it be, if, at such tidal moments, the youth should"
4832,THE RIDE,"not, in pure thankfulness, find out the Giver of all good!"
4833,THE RIDE,
4834,THE RIDE,"""As soon as man thus knows himself a creature, he has established a"
4835,THE RIDE,"direct relation with the Creator, did he but realize it,--not in mere"
4836,THE RIDE,"thought of some temporal creation, some antecedent fact of a beginning,"
4837,THE RIDE,but in immediate experience of that continuing act which keeps the
4838,THE RIDE,"universe in being,"
4839,THE RIDE,
4840,THE RIDE,"'Which wields the world with never wearied love,"
4841,THE RIDE,"Sustains it from beneath and kindles it above,'--"
4842,THE RIDE,
4843,THE RIDE,"felt and known now in the life which, moment to moment, is his own. The"
4844,THE RIDE,extreme sense of this may take on the expression of the pantheistic
4845,THE RIDE,"mood, as here in Shelley's words, without any logical irreverence: for"
4846,THE RIDE,"pantheism is that great mood of the human spirit which it is, permanent,"
4847,THE RIDE,"recurring in every age and race, as natural to Wordsworth as to Shelley,"
4848,THE RIDE,because of the fundamental character of these facts and the
4849,THE RIDE,inevitability of the knowledge of them. The most arrogant thought of
4850,THE RIDE,"man, since it identifies him with deity, it springs from that same sense"
4851,THE RIDE,of insignificance which makes humility the characteristic of religious
4852,THE RIDE,life in all its forms. A mind deeply penetrated with the feeling that
4853,THE RIDE,"all we take and all we are, our joys and the might and grace of life in"
4854,THE RIDE,"us, are the mere lendings of mortality like Lear's rags, may come to"
4855,THE RIDE,"think man the passive receptacle of power, and the instrument scarce"
4856,THE RIDE,distinguishable from the hand that uses it; the thought is as nigh to
4857,THE RIDE,St. Paul as to Plato. This intimate and infinite sense of obligation
4858,THE RIDE,"finds its highest expression, on the secular side, and takes on the"
4859,THE RIDE,"touch of mystery, in those great men of action who have believed"
4860,THE RIDE,"themselves in a special manner servants of God, and in great poets who"
4861,THE RIDE,"found some consecration in their calling. They, more than other men,"
4862,THE RIDE,know how small is any personal part in our labours and our wages alike.
4863,THE RIDE,"But in all men life comes to be felt to be, in itself and its"
4864,THE RIDE,"instruments, this gift, this debt; to continue to live is to contract a"
4865,THE RIDE,greater debt in proportion to the greatness of the life; it is greatest
4866,THE RIDE,in the greatest.
4867,THE RIDE,
4868,THE RIDE,"""This spontaneous gratitude is a vital thing. He who is most sensitive"
4869,THE RIDE,"to beauty and prizes it, who is most quick to love, who is most ardent"
4870,THE RIDE,"in the world's service, feels most constantly this power which enfolds"
4871,THE RIDE,him in its hidden infinity; he is overwhelmed by it: and how should
4872,THE RIDE,gratitude for such varied and constant and exhaustless good fail to
4873,THE RIDE,"become a part of the daily life of his spirit, deepening with every hour"
4874,THE RIDE,"in which the value, the power and sweetness of life, is made more plain?"
4875,THE RIDE,Yet at the same instant another and almost contrary mood is twin-born
4876,THE RIDE,"with this thankfulness,--the feeling of helplessness. Though the secret"
4877,THE RIDE,"and inscrutable power, sustaining and feeding life, be truly felt,--"
4878,THE RIDE,
4879,THE RIDE,'Closer is He than breathing and nearer than
4880,THE RIDE,"hands and feet,'--"
4881,THE RIDE,
4882,THE RIDE,though in moments of life's triumphs it evokes this natural burst of
4883,THE RIDE,"happy gratitude, yet who can free himself from mortal fear, or dispense"
4884,THE RIDE,"with human hope, however firm and irremovable may be his confidence in"
4885,THE RIDE,the beneficent order of God? And especially in the more strenuous trials
4886,THE RIDE,"of later ages for Christian perfection in a world not Christian, and"
4887,THE RIDE,"under the mysterious dispensation of nature, even the youth has lived"
4888,THE RIDE,"little, and that shallowly, who does not crave companionship, guidance,"
4889,THE RIDE,protection. Dependent as he feels himself to be for all he is and all
4890,THE RIDE,"he may become, the means of help--self-help even--and the law of it must"
4891,THE RIDE,"be from that same power, whose efficient working he has recognized with"
4892,THE RIDE,a thankful heart. Where else shall he look except to that experience of
4893,THE RIDE,exaltation during whose continuance he plucked a natural trust for the
4894,THE RIDE,"future, a reasonable belief in Providence, and a humble readiness to"
4895,THE RIDE,"accept the partial ills of life? In life's valleys, then, as on its"
4896,THE RIDE,"summits, in the darkness as in the light, he may retain that once"
4897,THE RIDE,"confided trust; not that he looks for miracle, or any specific and"
4898,THE RIDE,"particularizing care, it may be, but that in the normal course of things"
4899,THE RIDE,he believes in the natural alliance of that arm of infinite power with
4900,THE RIDE,"himself. In depression, in trouble, in struggle, such as all life"
4901,THE RIDE,"exhibits, he will be no more solitary than in his hours of blessing."
4902,THE RIDE,"Thus, through helplessness also, he establishes a direct relation with"
4903,THE RIDE,"God, which is also a reality of experience, as vital in the cry for aid"
4904,THE RIDE,as in the offering of thanks. The gratitude of the soul may be likened
4905,THE RIDE,to that morning prayer of the race which was little more than praise
4906,THE RIDE,with uplifted hands; the helplessness of man is rather the evening
4907,THE RIDE,"prayer of the Christian age, which with bowed head implores the grace of"
4908,THE RIDE,"God to shield him through the night. These two, in all times, among all"
4909,THE RIDE,"races, under ten thousand divinities, have been the voices of the heart."
4910,THE RIDE,
4911,THE RIDE,"""There is a third mood of direct experience by which one approaches the"
4912,THE RIDE,religious life. Surely no man in our civilization can grow far in years
4913,THE RIDE,"without finding out that, in the effort to live a life obeying his"
4914,THE RIDE,"desires and worthy of his hopes, his will is made one with Christ's"
4915,THE RIDE,"commands; and he knows that the promises of Christ, so far as they"
4916,THE RIDE,"relate to the life that now is, are fulfilled in himself day by day; he"
4917,THE RIDE,"can escape neither the ideal that Christ was, nor the wisdom of Christ"
4918,THE RIDE,in respect to the working of that ideal on others and within himself. He
4919,THE RIDE,"perceives the evil of the world, and desires to share in its redemption;"
4920,THE RIDE,"its sufferings, and would remove them; its injustice, and would abolish"
4921,THE RIDE,"it. He is, by the mere force of his own heart in view of mankind, a"
4922,THE RIDE,"humanitarian. But he is more than this in such a life. If he be sincere,"
4923,THE RIDE,he has not lived long before he knows in himself such default of duty
4924,THE RIDE,"that he recognizes it as the soul's betrayal; its times and occasions,"
4925,THE RIDE,"its degrees of responsibility, its character whether of mere frailty or"
4926,THE RIDE,"of an evil will, its greater or less offence, are indifferent matters;"
4927,THE RIDE,"for, as it is the man of perfect honour who feels a stain as a wound,"
4928,THE RIDE,"and a shadow as a stain, so poignancy of repentance is keenest in the"
4929,THE RIDE,"purest souls. It is death that is dull, it is life that is quick. It may"
4930,THE RIDE,"well be, in the world's history in our time, that the suffering caused"
4931,THE RIDE,in the good by slight defections from virtue far overbalances the
4932,THE RIDE,general remorse felt for definite and habitual crime. Thus none--those
4933,THE RIDE,"least who are most hearts of conscience--escapes this emotion, known in"
4934,THE RIDE,the language of religion as conviction of sin. It is the earliest moral
4935,THE RIDE,"crisis of the soul; it is widely felt,--such is the nature and such the"
4936,THE RIDE,"circumstances of men; and, as a man meets it in that hour, as he then"
4937,THE RIDE,"begins to form the habit of dealing with his failures sure to come, so"
4938,THE RIDE,runs his life to the end save for some great change. If then some
4939,THE RIDE,"restoring power enters in, some saving force, whether it be from the"
4940,THE RIDE,"memory and words of Christ, or from the example of those lives that"
4941,THE RIDE,"were lived in the spirit of that ideal, or from nearer love and more"
4942,THE RIDE,tender affection enforcing the supremacy of duty and the hope of
4943,THE RIDE,"struggle,--in whatever way that healing comes, it is well; and, just as"
4944,THE RIDE,the man of honest mind has recognized the identity of his virtue with
4945,THE RIDE,"Christ's rule, and has verified in practice the wisdom of its original"
4946,THE RIDE,"statement, so now he knows that this moral recovery, and its method, is"
4947,THE RIDE,what has been known on the lips of saint and sinner as the life of the
4948,THE RIDE,"Spirit in man, and even more specially he cannot discriminate it from"
4949,THE RIDE,what the servants of Christ call the life of Christ in them. He has
4950,THE RIDE,become more than a humanitarian through this experience; he is now
4951,THE RIDE,himself one of those whom in the mass he pities and would help; he has
4952,THE RIDE,entered into that communion with his kind and kin which is the earthly
4953,THE RIDE,seal of Christian faith.
4954,THE RIDE,
4955,THE RIDE,"""Yet it seems to me a profound error in life to concentrate attention"
4956,THE RIDE,"upon the moral experience here described; it is but initial; and, though"
4957,THE RIDE,"repeated, it remains only a beginning; as the vast force of nature is"
4958,THE RIDE,"put forth through health, and its curative power is an incident and"
4959,THE RIDE,"subordinate, so the spiritual energy of life is made manifest, in the"
4960,THE RIDE,"main, in the joy of the soul in so far as it has been made whole. A"
4961,THE RIDE,"narrow insistence on the fact of sin distorts life, and saddens it both"
4962,THE RIDE,in one's own conscience and in his love for others. Sin is but a part of
4963,THE RIDE,"life, and it is far better to fix our eyes on the measureless good"
4964,THE RIDE,achieved in those lines of human effort which have either never been
4965,THE RIDE,"deflected from right aims, or have been brought back to the paths of"
4966,THE RIDE,"advance, which I believe to be the greater part, both in individual"
4967,THE RIDE,"lives of noble intention, and in the Christian nations. Sin loses half"
4968,THE RIDE,"its dismaying power, and evil is stripped of its terrors, if one"
4969,THE RIDE,recognizes how far ideal motives enter with controlling influence into
4970,THE RIDE,"personal life, and to what a degree ideal destinies are already"
4971,THE RIDE,incarnate in the spirit of great nations.
4972,THE RIDE,
4973,THE RIDE,"""However this may be, I find on examination of man's common experience"
4974,THE RIDE,"these three things, which establish, it seems to me, a direct relation"
4975,THE RIDE,"between him and God: this spontaneous gratitude, this trustful"
4976,THE RIDE,"dependence, this noble practice, which is, historically, the Christian"
4977,THE RIDE,"life, and is characterized by its distinctive experiences. They are"
4978,THE RIDE,simple elements: a faith in God's being which has not cared further to
4979,THE RIDE,define the modes of that being; a hope which has not grown to specify
4980,THE RIDE,even a Resurrection; a love that has not concentrated itself through
4981,THE RIDE,"limitation upon any instrumental conversion of the world; but, inchoate"
4982,THE RIDE,"as they are, they remain faith, hope, love--these three. Are they not"
4983,THE RIDE,sufficient to be the beginnings of the religious life in the young? To
4984,THE RIDE,"theological learning, traditional creeds, and conventional worship they"
4985,THE RIDE,"may seem primitive, slight in substance, meagre in apparel; but one who"
4986,THE RIDE,"is seeking, not things to believe, but things to live, desires the"
4987,THE RIDE,"elementary. In setting forth first principles, the elaboration of a more"
4988,THE RIDE,"highly organized knowledge may be felt as an obscuration of truth, an"
4989,THE RIDE,"impediment to certainty, a hindrance in the effort to touch and handle"
4990,THE RIDE,the essential matter; and for this reason a teacher dispenses with much
4991,THE RIDE,"in his exposition, just as in talking to a child a grown man abandons"
4992,THE RIDE,"nine-tenths of his vocabulary. In the same way, learning as a child,"
4993,THE RIDE,"seeking in the life of the soul with God what is normal, vital, and"
4994,THE RIDE,"universal, the beginner need not feel poor and balked, because he does"
4995,THE RIDE,"not avail himself as yet of resources that belong to length of life,"
4996,THE RIDE,"breadth of scholarship, intellectual power, the saint's ardour, the"
4997,THE RIDE,seer's insight.
4998,THE RIDE,
4999,THE RIDE,"""The spiritual life here defined, elementary as it is, appears"
5000,THE RIDE,"inevitable, part and parcel of our natural being. Why should this be"
5001,THE RIDE,"surprising? Surely if there be a revelation of the divine at all, it"
5002,THE RIDE,must be one independent of external things; one that comes to all by
5003,THE RIDE,"virtue of their human nature; one that is direct, and not mediately"
5004,THE RIDE,given through others. Faith that is vital is not the fruit of things
5005,THE RIDE,"told of, but of things experienced. It follows that religion may be"
5006,THE RIDE,essentially free from any admixture of the past in its communication to
5007,THE RIDE,"the soul. It cannot depend on events of a long-past time now disputable,"
5008,THE RIDE,or on books of a far-off and now alien age. These things are the
5009,THE RIDE,"tradition and history of the spiritual life, but not the life. To the"
5010,THE RIDE,mass of men religion derived from such sources would be a belief in
5011,THE RIDE,"other men's experience, and for most of them would rest on proofs they"
5012,THE RIDE,"cannot scrutinize. It would be a religion of authority, not of personal"
5013,THE RIDE,"and intimate conviction. Just as creation may be felt, not as some"
5014,THE RIDE,"far-off event, but a continuing act, revelation itself is a present"
5015,THE RIDE,reality. Do not the heavens still declare the glory of God as when they
5016,THE RIDE,spoke to the Psalmist? and has the light that lighteth every man who is
5017,THE RIDE,born into the world ceased to burn in the spirit since the first candle
5018,THE RIDE,was lit on a Christian altar? If the revelation of glory and mercy be an
5019,THE RIDE,"everlasting thing, and inextinguishable save in the life itself, then"
5020,THE RIDE,"only is that direct relation of man with God, this vital certainty in"
5021,THE RIDE,"living truth,--living in us,--this personal religion, possible."
5022,THE RIDE,
5023,THE RIDE,"""What has reform in religion ever been other than the demolition of the"
5024,THE RIDE,"interfering barriers, the deposit of the past, between man and God? The"
5025,THE RIDE,theory of the office of the Holy Spirit in the Church expresses man's
5026,THE RIDE,need of direct contact with the divine; the doctrine of
5027,THE RIDE,"transubstantiation symbolizes it; and what is Puritanism in all ages,"
5028,THE RIDE,"affirming the pure spirit, denying all forms, but the heart of man in"
5029,THE RIDE,"his loneliness, seeking God face to face? what is its iconoclasm of"
5030,THE RIDE,"image and altar, of prayer-book and ritual, of the Councils and the"
5031,THE RIDE,"Fathers, but the assertion of the noble dignity in each individual soul"
5032,THE RIDE,"by virtue of which it demands a freeman's right of audience, a son's"
5033,THE RIDE,"right of presence with his father, and believes that such is God's way"
5034,THE RIDE,"with his own? This immediacy of the religious life, being once accepted"
5035,THE RIDE,"as the substance of vitality in it, relieves man at once of the greater"
5036,THE RIDE,mass of that burden in which scepticism thrives and labours. The
5037,THE RIDE,"theories of the past respecting God's government, no longer possible in"
5038,THE RIDE,"a humaner and Christianized age, the impaired genuineness of the"
5039,THE RIDE,"Scriptures and all questions of their text and accuracy, even the great"
5040,THE RIDE,"doctrine of miracles, cease to be of vital consequence. A man may"
5041,THE RIDE,approach divine truth without them. Simple and bare as the spiritual
5042,THE RIDE,"life here presented is, it is not open to such sceptical attack, being"
5043,THE RIDE,the fundamental revelation of God bound up in the very nature of man
5044,THE RIDE,"which has been recognized at so many critical times, in so many places"
5045,THE RIDE,"and ages, as the inward light. We may safely leave dogma and historical"
5046,THE RIDE,criticism and scientific discovery on one side; it is not in them that
5047,THE RIDE,"man finds this inward wisdom, but in the religious emotions as they"
5048,THE RIDE,naturally arise under the influence of life.
5049,THE RIDE,
5050,THE RIDE,"""This view is supported rather than weakened by such records of the"
5051,THE RIDE,"spiritual life in man as we possess. Man's nature is one; and, just as"
5052,THE RIDE,it is interpreted and illuminated by the poets from whom we derive
5053,THE RIDE,"direction in our general conduct, it is set forth and illustrated by"
5054,THE RIDE,saintly men and holy women in the special sphere of the soul's life with
5055,THE RIDE,God. Our nature is one with theirs; but as there are differences in the
5056,THE RIDE,"aptitudes, sensibilities, and fates of all men, so is it with spiritual"
5057,THE RIDE,"faculties and their growth; and, from time to time, men have arisen of"
5058,THE RIDE,"such intense nature, so sensitive to religious emotions, so developed in"
5059,THE RIDE,"religious experience, through instinct, circumstance, and power, that"
5060,THE RIDE,they can aid us by the example and precept of their lives. To them
5061,THE RIDE,belongs a respect similar to that paid to poets and thinkers. Yet it is
5062,THE RIDE,"because they tell us what they have seen and touched, not what they have"
5063,THE RIDE,"heard,--what they have lived and shown forth in acts that bear testimony"
5064,THE RIDE,"to their words, that they have this power. Such were St. Augustine, St."
5065,THE RIDE,"Francis of Assisi, St. Thomas à Kempis, and many a humbler name whose"
5066,THE RIDE,"life's story has come into our hands; such were the Apostles, and,"
5067,THE RIDE,"preeminently, Christ. It is the reality of the life in them, personal,"
5068,THE RIDE,"direct, fundamental, that preserves their influence in other lives. They"
5069,THE RIDE,help us by opening and directing the spiritual powers we have in common;
5070,THE RIDE,and beyond our own experience we believe in their counsels as leading to
5071,THE RIDE,what we in our turn may somewhat attain to in the life they followed. It
5072,THE RIDE,"is not what they believed of God, but what God accomplished in them,"
5073,THE RIDE,that holds our attention; and we interpret it only by what ourselves
5074,THE RIDE,"have known of his dealing with us. It is life, and the revelation of God"
5075,THE RIDE,"there contained, that in others or ourselves is the root of the"
5076,THE RIDE,"matter--God in us. This is the corner stone."""

5079,THE RIDE,
5080,THE RIDE,The sun was high in the heavens when we ceased talking of these matters
5081,THE RIDE,"and saw in a lowland before us a farmhouse, where we stopped. It was a"
5082,THE RIDE,"humble dwelling--almost the humblest--partly built of sod, with a barn"
5083,THE RIDE,"near by, and nothing to distinguish it except the sign, ""Post Office,"""
5084,THE RIDE,"which showed it was the centre of this neighborhood, if ""the blank miles"
5085,THE RIDE,"round about"" could be so called. We were made welcome, and, the ponies"
5086,THE RIDE,"being fed and cared for, we sat down with the farmer and his wife and"
5087,THE RIDE,"the small brood of young children, sharing their noonday meal. It was a"
5088,THE RIDE,"rude table and a lowly roof; but, when I arose, I was glad to have been"
5089,THE RIDE,"at such a board, taking a stranger's portion, but not like a stranger."
5090,THE RIDE,"It was to be near the common lot, and the sense of it was as primitive"
5091,THE RIDE,as the smell of the upturned earth in spring; it had the wholesomeness
5092,THE RIDE,"of life in it. Going out, I lay down on the ground and talked with the"
5093,THE RIDE,"little boy, some ten years old, to whom our coming was evidently an"
5094,THE RIDE,event of importance; and I remember asking him if he ever saw a city. He
5095,THE RIDE,"had been once, he said, to--the hamlet, as I thought it, which we had"
5096,THE RIDE,just left--with his father in the farm-wagon. That was his idea of the
5097,THE RIDE,magnificence of cities. I could not but look at him curiously. Here was
5098,THE RIDE,"the creature, just like other boys, who knew less of the look of man's"
5099,THE RIDE,world than any one I had ever encountered. To him this overstretching
5100,THE RIDE,"silent sky, this vacant rolling reach of earth, and home, were all of"
5101,THE RIDE,"life. What a waif of existence!--but the ponies being ready, we said our"
5102,THE RIDE,"good-byes and drove on along fainter tracks, still northward. We talked"
5103,THE RIDE,"for a while in that spacious atmosphere--the cheerful talk, half"
5104,THE RIDE,"personal, half literary, lightly humorous, too, which we always had"
5105,THE RIDE,"together; but tiring of it at last, and the boy still staying in my mind"
5106,THE RIDE,as a kind of accidental symbol of that isolated being whom my notes had
5107,THE RIDE,"described, and knowing that I had told but half my story and that my"
5108,THE RIDE,"friend would like the rest, I turned the talk again on the serious"
5109,THE RIDE,"things, saying--and there was nothing surprising in such a change with"
5110,THE RIDE,"us--""After all, you know, we can't live to ourselves alone or by"
5111,THE RIDE,"ourselves. How to enter life and be one with other men, how to be the"
5112,THE RIDE,"child of society, and a peer there, belongs to our duty; and to escape"
5113,THE RIDE,from the solitude of private life is the most important thing for men of
5114,THE RIDE,"lonely thought and feeling, such as meditation breeds. There is more of"
5115,THE RIDE,"it, if you will listen again;"" and he, with the sparkle in his eyes, and"
5116,THE RIDE,"the youthful happiness in the new things of life for us, new as if they"
5117,THE RIDE,"had not been lived a thousand years before,--listened like a child to a"
5118,THE RIDE,"story, grave as the matter was, which I read again from the memoranda I"
5119,THE RIDE,"had made, after that April morning, year by year."

5124,THE RIDE,"a sentiment of the soul. An obscure melancholy, the pathos of human"
5125,THE RIDE,"fate, mingles with this instinctive feeling. The fascination of the sea,"
5126,THE RIDE,"the sublimity of mountains, are indebted to it, as well as the beautiful"
5127,THE RIDE,"and solemn stars, which, like them, the mind does not distinguish from"
5128,THE RIDE,"eternal things, and has ever invested with sacred awe. It is the sense"
5129,THE RIDE,of our mortality that thus exalts nature. Yet before her antiquity
5130,THE RIDE,"merely, veneration is seldom full and perfect; her periods are too"
5131,THE RIDE,"impalpable, and, in contemplating their vastness, amazement dissipates"
5132,THE RIDE,"our faculties. Rather some sign of human occupancy, turning the desert"
5133,THE RIDE,"into a neglected garden, is necessary to give emotional colour and the"
5134,THE RIDE,substance of thought; some touch of man's hand that knows a writing
5135,THE RIDE,"beyond nature's can add what centuries could not give, and makes a rock"
5136,THE RIDE,a monument. The Mediterranean islet is older for the pirate tower that
5137,THE RIDE,"caps it, and for us the ivied church, with its shadowed graves, makes"
5138,THE RIDE,England ancestral soil. Nor is it only such landmarks of time that bring
5139,THE RIDE,"this obscure awe; occupations, especially, awake it, and customary"
5140,THE RIDE,"ceremonies, and all that enters into the external tradition of life,"
5141,THE RIDE,handed down from generation to generation. On the Western prairies I
5142,THE RIDE,have felt rather the permanence of human toil than the newness of the
5143,THE RIDE,land.
5144,THE RIDE,
5145,THE RIDE,"""The sense of age in man's life, relieved, as it is, on the seeming"
5146,THE RIDE,"agelessness of nature, is a meditation on death, deep-set far below"
5147,THE RIDE,"thought. We behold the sensible conquests of death, and the sight is so"
5148,THE RIDE,"habitual, and remains so mysterious, that it leaves its imprint less in"
5149,THE RIDE,"the conscious and reflective mind than in temperament, sentiment,"
5150,THE RIDE,"imagination, and their hidden stir; the pyramids then seem fossils of"
5151,THE RIDE,"mankind; Stonehenge, Indian mounds, and desolate cities are like broken"
5152,THE RIDE,"anchors caught in the sunken reef and dull ooze of time's ocean, lost"
5153,THE RIDE,"relics of their human charge long vanished away. Startling it is, when"
5154,THE RIDE,"the finger of time has touched what we thought living, and we find in"
5155,THE RIDE,some solitary place the face of stone. I learned this lesson on the low
5156,THE RIDE,"marshes of Ravenna, where, among the rice-fields and the thousands of"
5157,THE RIDE,"white pond lilies, stands a lonely cathedral, from whose ruined sides"
5158,THE RIDE,"Christianity, in the face and figure it wore before it put on the form"
5159,THE RIDE,"and garb of a world-wide religion, looked down on me with the unknown"
5160,THE RIDE,"eyes of an alien and Oriental faith. 'Stranger, why lingerest thou in"
5161,THE RIDE,"this broken tomb,' I seemed to hear from silent voices in that death of"
5162,THE RIDE,"time; and still, when my thoughts seek the Mother-Church of Christendom,"
5163,THE RIDE,"they go, not to St. John Lateran by the Roman wall, but are pilgrims to"
5164,THE RIDE,"the low marshes, the white water lilies, the lone Byzantine ruin that"
5165,THE RIDE,even the sea has long abandoned.
5166,THE RIDE,
5167,THE RIDE,"""The Mother-Church?--is then this personal religious life only a state"
5168,THE RIDE,of orphanage? Because true life necessarily begins in the independent
5169,THE RIDE,"self, must it continue without the sheltering of the traditional past,"
5170,THE RIDE,"the instructed guidance of older wisdom, and man's joint life in common"
5171,THE RIDE,which by association so enlarges and fortifies the individual good? Why
5172,THE RIDE,should one not behave with respect to religion as he does in other
5173,THE RIDE,parts of life? It is our habit elsewhere in all quarters to recognize
5174,THE RIDE,"beyond ourselves an ampler knowledge, a maturer judgment, a more"
5175,THE RIDE,efficient will enacting our own choice. To obey by force is a childish
5176,THE RIDE,"or a slavish act, but intelligently and willingly to accept authority"
5177,THE RIDE,within just limits is the reasonable and practical act of a free man in
5178,THE RIDE,society; the recognition of this by a youth marks his attainment of
5179,THE RIDE,"intellectual majority. Authority, in all its modes, is the bond of the"
5180,THE RIDE,commonwealth; until the youth comprehends it he is a ward; thereafter he
5181,THE RIDE,"is either a rebel or a citizen, as he lists. For us, born to the largest"
5182,THE RIDE,"measure of freedom society has ever known, there is little fear lest the"
5183,THE RIDE,principle of authority should prove a dangerous element. The right of
5184,THE RIDE,"private judgment, which is, I believe, the vital principle of the"
5185,THE RIDE,"intellectual life, is the first to be exercised by our young men who"
5186,THE RIDE,lead that life; and quite in the spirit of that education which would
5187,THE RIDE,"repeat in the child the history of the race, we are scarce out of the"
5188,THE RIDE,swaddling bands of the primer and catechism before we would remove all
5189,THE RIDE,questions to the court of our own jurisdiction. The mind is not a
5190,THE RIDE,"_tabula rasa_ at birth, we learn, but, so soon as may be, we will remedy"
5191,THE RIDE,"that, and erase all records copied there. The treasure doors of our"
5192,THE RIDE,fathers' inheritance are thrown open to us; but we will weigh each gold
5193,THE RIDE,"piece with balance and scale. All that libraries contain, all that"
5194,THE RIDE,"institutions embody, all the practice of life which, in its innocence,"
5195,THE RIDE,"mankind has adopted as things of use and wont, shall be certified by our"
5196,THE RIDE,"scrutiny. So in youth we say, and what results? What do the best become?"
5197,THE RIDE,"Incapables, detached from the sap of life, forced to escape to the"
5198,THE RIDE,"intellectual limbo of a suspension of judgment, extending till it fills"
5199,THE RIDE,heaven and earth. We no longer discuss opinions even; the most we can
5200,THE RIDE,attain to is an attitude of mind. In view of the vast variety of phases
5201,THE RIDE,"in which even man's great ideas have been held, a sense of indifference"
5202,THE RIDE,"among them, a vacuity in all, grows up. Pilate's question, 'What is"
5203,THE RIDE,truth?' ends all.
5204,THE RIDE,
5205,THE RIDE,"""This is the extreme penalty of the heroic sceptical resolve in strong"
5206,THE RIDE,and constant minds; commonly those who would measure man's large scope
5207,THE RIDE,by the gauge of their own ability and experience fall into such
5208,THE RIDE,"idiosyncrasy as is the fruitful mother of sects, abortive social"
5209,THE RIDE,"schemes, and all the various brood of dwarfed life; but, for most men,"
5210,THE RIDE,"the pressure of life itself, which compels them, like Descartes,"
5211,THE RIDE,"doubting the world, to live as if it were real, corrects their original"
5212,THE RIDE,method of independence. They find that to use authority is the better
5213,THE RIDE,"part of wisdom, much as to employ men belongs to practical statecraft;"
5214,THE RIDE,and they learn the reasonable share of the principle of authority in
5215,THE RIDE,"life. They accept, for example, the testimony of others in matters of"
5216,THE RIDE,"fact, and their mental results in those subjects with which such men are"
5217,THE RIDE,"conversant, on the ground of a just faith in average human capacity in"
5218,THE RIDE,"its own sphere; and, in particular, they accept provisional opinions,"
5219,THE RIDE,"especially such as are alleged to be verifiable in action, and they put"
5220,THE RIDE,them to the test. This is our habit in all parts of secular life--in
5221,THE RIDE,"scholarship and in practical affairs. 'If any man will do His will, he"
5222,THE RIDE,"shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God,' is only a special"
5223,THE RIDE,instance of this law of temporary acceptance and experiment in all life.
5224,THE RIDE,It is a reasonable command. The confusion of human opinion largely
5225,THE RIDE,"arises from the fact that the greater part of it is unverifiable, owing"
5226,THE RIDE,to the deficient culture or opportunity of those who hold it; and the
5227,THE RIDE,"persistency with which such opinion is argued, clung to, and cherished,"
5228,THE RIDE,is the cause of many of the permanent differences that array men in
5229,THE RIDE,opposition. The event would dispense with the argument; but in common
5230,THE RIDE,"life, which knows far more of the world than it has in its own"
5231,THE RIDE,"laboratory, much lies beyond the reach of such real solution. It is the"
5232,THE RIDE,distinction of vital religious truth that it is not so withdrawn from
5233,THE RIDE,"true proof, but is near at hand in the daily life open to all."
5234,THE RIDE,
5235,THE RIDE,"""Such authority, then, as is commonly granted in science, politics, or"
5236,THE RIDE,commerce to the past results and expectations of men bringing human life
5237,THE RIDE,"in these provinces down to our time and delivering it, not as a new, but"
5238,THE RIDE,"as an incomplete thing, into the hands of our generation, we may yield"
5239,THE RIDE,also in religion. The lives of the saints and all those who in history
5240,THE RIDE,"have illustrated the methods and results of piety, their convictions,"
5241,THE RIDE,"speculations, and hopes, their warning and encouragement, compose a"
5242,THE RIDE,"great volume of instruction, illustration, and education of the"
5243,THE RIDE,"religious life. It is folly to ignore this, as it would be to ignore"
5244,THE RIDE,"the alphabet of letters, the Arabic numerals, or the Constitution; for,"
5245,THE RIDE,as these are the monuments of past achievement and an advantage we have
5246,THE RIDE,"at our start over savage man, so in religion there are as well"
5247,THE RIDE,established results of life already lived. Though the religious life be
5248,THE RIDE,"personal, it is not more so than all life of thought and emotion; and in"
5249,THE RIDE,it we do not begin at the beginning of time any more than in other parts
5250,THE RIDE,"of life. We begin with an inheritance of many experiments hitherto, of"
5251,THE RIDE,"many methods, of a whole race-history of partial error, partial truth;"
5252,THE RIDE,"and we take up the matter where our fathers laid it down, with the"
5253,THE RIDE,"respect due to their earnest toil, their sincere effort and trial, their"
5254,THE RIDE,convictions; and the youth who does not feel their impressiveness as
5255,THE RIDE,enforcing his responsibility has as nascent a life in religion as he
5256,THE RIDE,"would have, in the similar case, in learning or in citizenship."
5257,THE RIDE,
5258,THE RIDE,"""The question of authority in the religious life, however, is more"
5259,THE RIDE,"specific than this, and is not to be met by an admission of the general"
5260,THE RIDE,"respect due to the human past and its choicer spirits, and our"
5261,THE RIDE,"dependence thereon for the fostering of instinctive impulses,"
5262,THE RIDE,"direction, and the confirmation of our experience. It is organized"
5263,THE RIDE,"religion that here makes its claim to fealty, as organized liberty,"
5264,THE RIDE,"organized justice do, in man's communal life. There is a joint and"
5265,THE RIDE,general consent in the masses of men with similar experience united
5266,THE RIDE,"into the Church, with respect to the religious way of life, similar to"
5267,THE RIDE,that of such masses united into a government with respect to secular
5268,THE RIDE,things. The history of the Church with its embodied dogmas--the past of
5269,THE RIDE,Christendom--contains that consent; and the Church founds its claim to
5270,THE RIDE,"veneration on this broad accumulation of experience, so gathered from"
5271,THE RIDE,all ages and all conditions of men as to have lost all traces of
5272,THE RIDE,individuality and become the conviction of mankind to a degree that no
5273,THE RIDE,free constitution and no legal code can claim. To substitute the simple
5274,THE RIDE,"faith of the young heart, however immediate, in the place of this hoary"
5275,THE RIDE,"and commanding tradition is a daring thing, and may seem both arrogance"
5276,THE RIDE,"and folly; to stand apart from it, though willing to be taught within"
5277,THE RIDE,"the free exercise of our own faculties, abashes us; and it is necessary,"
5278,THE RIDE,"for our own self-respect, to adopt some attitude toward the Church"
5279,THE RIDE,"definitely, not as a part of the common mass of race-tradition in a"
5280,THE RIDE,"diffused state like philosophy, but as an institution like the Throne or"
5281,THE RIDE,the Parliament.
5282,THE RIDE,
5283,THE RIDE,"""But may it not be pleaded that, however slight by comparison personal"
5284,THE RIDE,"life may seem, yet if it be true, the Church must include this in its"
5285,THE RIDE,"own mighty sum; and that what the Church adds to define, expand, and"
5286,THE RIDE,"elevate, to guide and support, belongs to growth in spiritual things,"
5287,THE RIDE,not to those beginnings which only are here spoken of? And in defence of
5288,THE RIDE,"a private view and hesitancy, such as is also felt in the organized"
5289,THE RIDE,"social life elsewhere, may it not be suggested that the past of"
5290,THE RIDE,"Christendom, great as it is in mental force, moral ardour, and spiritual"
5291,THE RIDE,"insight, and illustrious with triumphs over evil in man and in society,"
5292,THE RIDE,"and shining always with the leading of a great light, is yet a human"
5293,THE RIDE,"past, an imperfect stage of progress at every era? Is its historic life,"
5294,THE RIDE,"with all its accumulation of creed and custom, not a process of"
5295,THE RIDE,"Christianization, in which much has been sloughed off at every new birth"
5296,THE RIDE,of the world? In reading the Fathers we come on states of mind and forms
5297,THE RIDE,of emotion due to transitory influences and surroundings; and in the
5298,THE RIDE,"history of the Church, we come upon dogmas, ceremonials, methods of work"
5299,THE RIDE,"and aims of effort, which were of contemporary validity only. Such are"
5300,THE RIDE,"no longer rational or possible; they have passed out of life, belonging"
5301,THE RIDE,"to that body of man which is forever dying, not to the spirit that is"
5302,THE RIDE,"forever growing; and, too, as all men and bodies of men share in"
5303,THE RIDE,"imperfection, we come, in the Fathers and in the Church, upon passions,"
5304,THE RIDE,"persecutions, wars, vices, degradation, and failure, necessarily to be"
5305,THE RIDE,"accounted as a portion of the admixture of sin and wrong, of evil, in"
5306,THE RIDE,"the whole of man's historic life. In view of these obvious facts, and"
5307,THE RIDE,also of the great discrepancies of such organic bodies as are here
5308,THE RIDE,"spoken of in their total mass as the Church, and of their emphasis upon"
5309,THE RIDE,"such particularities, is not an attitude of reserve justifiable in a"
5310,THE RIDE,"young and conscientious heart? It may seem to be partial scepticism,"
5311,THE RIDE,especially as the necessity for rejection of some portion of this
5312,THE RIDE,embodied past becomes clearer in the growth of the mind's information
5313,THE RIDE,and the strengthening of moral judgment in a rightful independence. But
5314,THE RIDE,"if much must be cast away, let it not disturb us; it must be the more"
5315,THE RIDE,"in proportion as the nature of man suffers redemption. Let us own, then,"
5316,THE RIDE,and reverence the great tradition of the Church; but he has feebly
5317,THE RIDE,"grasped the idea of Christ leavening the world, and has read little in"
5318,THE RIDE,"the records of pious ages even, who does not know that even in the"
5319,THE RIDE,"Church it is needful to sift truth from falsehood, dead from living"
5320,THE RIDE,truth.
5321,THE RIDE,
5322,THE RIDE,"""If, however, a claim be advanced which forbids such a use of reason as"
5323,THE RIDE,"we make in regard to all other human institutions, viewing them"
5324,THE RIDE,historically with reference to their constant service to mankind and
5325,THE RIDE,"their particular adaptation to a changing social state; if, as was the"
5326,THE RIDE,"case with the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, the Church"
5327,THE RIDE,"proclaims a commission not subject to human control, by virtue of which"
5328,THE RIDE,"it would impose creed and ritual, and assumes those great offices,"
5329,THE RIDE,"reserved in Puritan thought to God only,--then does it not usurp the"
5330,THE RIDE,"function of the soul itself, suppress the personal revelation of the"
5331,THE RIDE,"divine by taking from the soul the seals of original sovereignty, remove"
5332,THE RIDE,"God to the first year of our era, relying on his mediate revelation in"
5333,THE RIDE,"time, and thus take from common man the evidence of religion and"
5334,THE RIDE,"therewith its certainty, and in general substitute faith in things for"
5335,THE RIDE,the vital faith? If the voice of the Church is to find only its own echo
5336,THE RIDE,"in the inner voice of life, if its evidences of religion involve more"
5337,THE RIDE,"than is near and present to every soul by virtue of its birth, if its"
5338,THE RIDE,rites have any other reality than that of the heart which expresses
5339,THE RIDE,"itself in them and so gives them life and significance, then its"
5340,THE RIDE,authority is external wholly and has nothing in common with that
5341,THE RIDE,authority which free men erect over themselves because it is themselves
5342,THE RIDE,embodied in an outward principle. If personality has any place in the
5343,THE RIDE,"soul, if the soul has any original office, then the authority that"
5344,THE RIDE,religion as an organic social form may take on must lie within limits
5345,THE RIDE,"that reserve to the soul its privacy with God, to truth an un-borrowed"
5346,THE RIDE,"radiance, and to all men its possession, simple or learned, lay or"
5347,THE RIDE,"cleric, through their common experience and ordinary faculties in the"
5348,THE RIDE,"normal course of life. Otherwise, it seems to me, personal experience"
5349,THE RIDE,"cannot be the beginning of Christian conviction, the true available test"
5350,THE RIDE,"of it, the underlying basis of it as we build the temple of God's"
5351,THE RIDE,"presence within us, and, as I have called it, the vitality of the whole"
5352,THE RIDE,matter.
5353,THE RIDE,
5354,THE RIDE,"""Within these limits, then, imposed by the earlier argument, what, under"
5355,THE RIDE,"such reserves of the great principles of liberty, democracy, and justice"
5356,THE RIDE,in which we are bred and which are forms of the cardinal fact of the
5357,THE RIDE,"value of the personal soul in all men,--what to us is the office of the"
5358,THE RIDE,"Church? In theology it defines a philosophy which, though an"
5359,THE RIDE,"interpretation of divine truth, takes its place in the intellectual"
5360,THE RIDE,"scheme of theory like other human philosophies, and has a similar value,"
5361,THE RIDE,"differing only in the gravity of its subject-matter, which is the most"
5362,THE RIDE,mysterious known to thought. In its specific rites it dignifies the
5363,THE RIDE,"great moments of life--birth, marriage, and death--with its solemn"
5364,THE RIDE,sanctions; and in its general ceremonies it affords appropriate forms in
5365,THE RIDE,which religious emotion finds noble and tender expression; especially it
5366,THE RIDE,enables masses of men to unite in one great act of the heart with the
5367,THE RIDE,"impressiveness that belongs to the act of a community, and to make that"
5368,THE RIDE,"act, though emotional in a multitude of hearts, single and whole in"
5369,THE RIDE,manifestation; and it does this habitually in the life of its least
5370,THE RIDE,"groups by Sabbath observances, and in the life of nations by public"
5371,THE RIDE,"thanksgivings, and in the life of entire Christendom by its general"
5372,THE RIDE,"feasts of Christmas and Easter, and, though within narrower limits, by"
5373,THE RIDE,its seasons of fasting and prayer. In its administration it facilitates
5374,THE RIDE,its daily work among men. The Church is thus a mighty organizer of
5375,THE RIDE,"thought in theology, of the forms of emotion in its ritual, and of"
5376,THE RIDE,"practical action in its executive. Its doctrines, however conflicting in"
5377,THE RIDE,"various divisions of the whole vast body, are the result of profound,"
5378,THE RIDE,"conscientious, and long-continued thought among its successive synods,"
5379,THE RIDE,"which are the custodians of creeds as senates are of constitutions, and"
5380,THE RIDE,whose affirmations and interpretations have a like weight in their own
5381,THE RIDE,speculative sphere as these possess in the province of political thought
5382,THE RIDE,age after age. Its counsels are ripe with a many-centuried knowledge of
5383,THE RIDE,human nature. Its joys and consolations are the most precious
5384,THE RIDE,"inheritance of the heart of man. Its saints open our pathways, and go"
5385,THE RIDE,"before, following in the ways of the spirit. Its doors concentrate"
5386,THE RIDE,"within their shelter the general faith, and give it there a home. Its"
5387,THE RIDE,"table is spread for all men. I do not speak of the Church Invisible,"
5388,THE RIDE,but mean to embrace with this catholicity of statement all
5389,THE RIDE,"organizations, howsoever divided, which own Christ as their Head."
5390,THE RIDE,"Temple, cathedral, and chapel have each their daily use to those who"
5391,THE RIDE,gather there with Christian hearts; each is a living fountain to its own
5392,THE RIDE,"fold. The village spire, wherever it rises on American or English"
5393,THE RIDE,"ground, bespeaks an association of families who find in this bond an"
5394,THE RIDE,inward companionship and outward expression of it in a public habit
5395,THE RIDE,"continuing from the fathers down, sanctified by the memories of"
5396,THE RIDE,"generations gone, and tender with the hope of the generation to come;"
5397,THE RIDE,and this is of measureless good within such families for young and old
5398,THE RIDE,"alike. It bespeaks also an instrument of charity, unobtrusive, friendly,"
5399,THE RIDE,"and searching, and growing more and more unconfined; it bespeaks a rock"
5400,THE RIDE,of public morality deep-set in the foundations of the state.
5401,THE RIDE,
5402,THE RIDE,"""It is true that in uniting with such a Church, under the specific"
5403,THE RIDE,"conditions natural to both temperament and residence, a man yields"
5404,THE RIDE,"something of private right, and sacrifices in a greater or less degree"
5405,THE RIDE,his personality; but this is the common condition of all social
5406,THE RIDE,"cooperation, whether in party action or any union to a common end. The"
5407,THE RIDE,"compromise, involved in any platform of principles, tolerates essential"
5408,THE RIDE,"differences in important matters, but matters not then important in view"
5409,THE RIDE,of what is to be gained in the main. The advantages of an organized
5410,THE RIDE,religious life are too plain to be ignored; it is reasonable to go to
5411,THE RIDE,"the very verge in order to avail of them, both for a man's self and for"
5412,THE RIDE,"his efficiency in society, just as it is to unite with a general party"
5413,THE RIDE,"in the state, and serve it in local primaries, for the ends of"
5414,THE RIDE,citizenship; such means of help and opportunities of accomplishment are
5415,THE RIDE,"not to be lightly neglected. Happy is he who, christened at the font,"
5416,THE RIDE,"naturally accepts the duties devolved upon him, and stands in his"
5417,THE RIDE,"parents' place; and fortunate I count the youth who, without stress and"
5418,THE RIDE,"trouble, undertakes in his turn his father's part. But some there are,"
5419,THE RIDE,"born of that resolute manliness of the fathers, which is finer than"
5420,THE RIDE,"tempered steel, and of the conscience of the mothers which is more"
5421,THE RIDE,"sensitive than the bare nerve,--the very flower of the Puritan"
5422,THE RIDE,"tradition, and my heart goes out to them. And if there be a youth in"
5423,THE RIDE,our days who feels hesitancy in such an early surrender into the bosom
5424,THE RIDE,"of a Church, however broadly inclusive of firm consciences, strong"
5425,THE RIDE,"heads, and free hearts; if primitive Puritanism is bred in his bone and"
5426,THE RIDE,blood and is there the large reserve of liberty natural to the American
5427,THE RIDE,heart; if the spirit is so living in him that he dispenses with the
5428,THE RIDE,"form, which to those of less strenuous strain is rather a support; if"
5429,THE RIDE,truth is so precious to him that he will not subscribe to more or less
5430,THE RIDE,"than he believes, or tolerate in inclusive statements speculative and"
5431,THE RIDE,"uncertain elements, traditional error, and all that body of rejected"
5432,THE RIDE,"doctrine which, though he himself be free from it, must yet be slowly"
5433,THE RIDE,uprooted from the general belief; if emotion is so sacred to him that
5434,THE RIDE,his native and habitual reticence becomes so sensitive in this most
5435,THE RIDE,private part of life as to make it here something between God and him
5436,THE RIDE,only; if his heart of charity and hand of friendship find out his
5437,THE RIDE,"fellow-men with no intervention; if for these reasons, or any of them,"
5438,THE RIDE,"or if from that modesty of nature, which is so much more common in"
5439,THE RIDE,"American youth than is believed, he hesitates, out of pure awe of the"
5440,THE RIDE,"responsibility before God and man which he incurs, to think himself"
5441,THE RIDE,"worthy of such vows, such hopes, such duties,--if in any way, being of"
5442,THE RIDE,"noble nature, he keeps by himself,--let him not think he thereby"
5443,THE RIDE,"withdraws from the life of Christendom, nor that in the Church itself he"
5444,THE RIDE,may not still take some portion of its great good. So far as its
5445,THE RIDE,"authority is of the heart only, so far as it has organized the religious"
5446,THE RIDE,"life itself without regard to other ends and free from intellectual,"
5447,THE RIDE,"historical, and governmental entanglements that are supplementary at"
5448,THE RIDE,"most, he needs no formal act to be one with its spirit; and, however"
5449,THE RIDE,"much he may deny himself by his self-limitation, he remains a"
5450,THE RIDE,"Christian."""

5454,THE RIDE,There was no doubt about it; we were lost. The faint tracks in the soil
5455,THE RIDE,"had long ago disappeared, and we followed, as was natural, the draws"
5456,THE RIDE,"between the slopes; and now, for the last quarter-hour, the grass had"
5457,THE RIDE,deepened till it was above the wheels and to the shoulders of the
5458,THE RIDE,ponies. They did not mind; they were born to it. What solitude there was
5459,THE RIDE,"in it, as we pulled up and came to a stand! What wildness was there!"
5460,THE RIDE,"Only the great blue sky, with a westward dropping sun of lonely"
5461,THE RIDE,"splendour, and green horizons, broken and nigh, of the waving prairie,"
5462,THE RIDE,"whispering with the high wind,--and no life but ours shut in among the"
5463,THE RIDE,"group of low, close hills all about, in that grassy gulf! The earth"
5464,THE RIDE,"seemed near, waiting for us; in such places, just like this, men lost"
5465,THE RIDE,had died and none knew it; half-unconsciously I found myself thinking of
5466,THE RIDE,"Childe Roland's Tower,--"
5467,THE RIDE,
5468,THE RIDE,"""those two hills on the right"
5469,THE RIDE,"Couched,""--"
5470,THE RIDE,
5471,THE RIDE,and the reality of crossing the prairie in old days came back on me.
5472,THE RIDE,That halt in the cup of the hills was our limit; it was a moment of
5473,THE RIDE,"life, an arrival, an end."
5474,THE RIDE,
5475,THE RIDE,The sun was too low for further adventuring. We struck due west on as
5476,THE RIDE,"straight a course as the rugged country permitted, thinking to reach the"
5477,THE RIDE,"Looking-glass creek, along which lay the beaten road of travel back to"
5478,THE RIDE,"mankind. An hour or two passed, and we saw a house in the distance to"
5479,THE RIDE,"which we drove,--a humble house, sod-built, like that we had made our"
5480,THE RIDE,"nooning in. We drove to the door, and called; it was long before any"
5481,THE RIDE,"answer came; but at last a woman opened the door, her face and figure"
5482,THE RIDE,"the very expression of dulled toil, hard work, bodily despair. Alone on"
5483,THE RIDE,"that prairie, one would have thought she would have welcomed a human"
5484,THE RIDE,"countenance; but she looked on us as if she wished we would be gone, and"
5485,THE RIDE,hardly answered to our question of the road. She was the type of the
5486,THE RIDE,"abandonment of human life. I did not speak to her; but I see her now, as"
5487,THE RIDE,"I saw her then, with a kind of surprise that a woman could come to be,"
5488,THE RIDE,"by human life, like that. There was no one else in the house; and she"
5489,THE RIDE,"shut the door upon us after one sullen look and one scant sentence, as"
5490,THE RIDE,"if we, and any other, were naught, and went back to her silence in that"
5491,THE RIDE,"green waste, now gilded by the level sun, miles on miles. I have often"
5492,THE RIDE,"thought of her since, and what life was to her there, and found some"
5493,THE RIDE,"image of other solitudes--and men and women in them--as expansive, as"
5494,THE RIDE,"alienating as the wild prairie, where life hides itself, grows"
5495,THE RIDE,"dehumanized, and dies."
5496,THE RIDE,
5497,THE RIDE,"We drove on, with some word of this; and, eating what we had with us in"
5498,THE RIDE,"case of famine, made our supper from biscuit and flask; and, before"
5499,THE RIDE,"darkness fell, we struck the creek road, and turned southward,--a"
5500,THE RIDE,"splendour of late sunset gleaming over the untravelled western bank, and"
5501,THE RIDE,dying out in red bloom and the purple of slow star-dawning overhead; and
5502,THE RIDE,"on we drove, with a hard road under us, having far to go. At the first"
5503,THE RIDE,"farmhouse we watered the willing ponies, who had long succumbed to our"
5504,THE RIDE,"control, and who went as if they could not tire, steadily and evenly,"
5505,THE RIDE,under the same strong hand and kindly voice they had felt day-long. It
5506,THE RIDE,"was then I took the reins for an easy stretch, giving my friend a"
5507,THE RIDE,"change, and felt what so unobservably he had been doing all day with"
5508,THE RIDE,"wrist and eye, while he listened. So we drove down, and knew the moon"
5509,THE RIDE,"was up by the changed heavens, though yet unseen behind the bluffs of"
5510,THE RIDE,"the creek upon our left; and far away southward, in the evening light,"
5511,THE RIDE,"lay the long valley like a larger river. We still felt the upland,"
5512,THE RIDE,"however, as a loftier air; and always as, when night comes, nature"
5513,THE RIDE,"exercises some mysterious magic of the dark hour in strange places,"
5514,THE RIDE,"there, as all day long, we seemed to draw closer to earth--not earth as"
5515,THE RIDE,"it is in landscape, a thing of beauty and colour and human kinship, but"
5516,THE RIDE,"earth, the soil, the element, the globe."
5517,THE RIDE,
5518,THE RIDE,"This was in both our minds, and I had thought of it before he spoke"
5519,THE RIDE,after a long pause over the briar pipes that had comraded our talk since
5520,THE RIDE,"morning. ""I can't talk of it now,"" he said; ""it's gone into me in an"
5521,THE RIDE,hour that you have been years in thinking; but that is what you are to
5522,THE RIDE,"us."" I say the things he said, for I cannot otherwise give his way, and"
5523,THE RIDE,that trust of love in which these thoughts were born on my lips; all
5524,THE RIDE,"those years, in many a distant place, I had thought for him almost as"
5525,THE RIDE,"much as for myself. ""You knighted us,"" he said, ""and we fight your"
5526,THE RIDE,"cause,""--not knowing that kingship, however great or humble, is but the"
5527,THE RIDE,"lowly knights made one in him who by God's grace can speak the word. ""I"
5528,THE RIDE,"have no doubt it's true, what you say; but it is different. I expected"
5529,THE RIDE,"it would be; but we used to speak of nature more than the soul, and of"
5530,THE RIDE,"nature's being a guide. Poor Robin, I remember, began with that."" ""There"
5531,THE RIDE,"is a sonnet of Arnold's you know,"" I answered, ""that tells another"
5532,THE RIDE,"tale. But I did not learn it from him. And, besides, what else he has to"
5533,THE RIDE,"say is not cheerful. Nothing is wise,"" I interjected, ""that is not"
5534,THE RIDE,"cheerful."""
5535,THE RIDE,
5536,THE RIDE,But without repeating the wandering talk of reality with its changeful
5537,THE RIDE,"tones,--and however serious the matter might be it was never far from a"
5538,THE RIDE,"touch of lightness shuttling in and out like sunshine,--I told him, as"
5539,THE RIDE,"we drove down the dark valley, my hand resting now on his shoulder near"
5540,THE RIDE,"me, how nature is antipodal to the soul; or, if not the antipodes, is"
5541,THE RIDE,"apart from us, and cares not for the virtues we have erected, for"
5542,THE RIDE,"authority and mercy, for justice, chastity, and sacrifice, for nothing"
5543,THE RIDE,"that is man's except the life of the body itself, the race-life, as if"
5544,THE RIDE,man were a chemical element or a wave-motion of ether that are parts of
5545,THE RIDE,"physics. ""I convinced myself,"" I said, ""that the soul is not a term in"
5546,THE RIDE,"the life of nature, but that nature is in it as a physical vigour and to"
5547,THE RIDE,"it an outward spectacle, whereby the soul acquires a preparation for"
5548,THE RIDE,"immortality, whether immortality come or not. And I have sometimes"
5549,THE RIDE,"thought,"" I continued, ""that on the spiritual side an explanation of the"
5550,THE RIDE,"inequalities of human conditions, both past and present, may be"
5551,THE RIDE,"contained in the idea that for all alike, lowly and lofty, wretched and"
5552,THE RIDE,"fortunate, simple and learned, life remains in all its conditions an"
5553,THE RIDE,"opportunity to know God and exercise the soul in virtue, and is an"
5554,THE RIDE,"education of the soul in all its essential knowledge and faculties, at"
5555,THE RIDE,"least within Christian times, broadly speaking, and in more than one"
5556,THE RIDE,"pagan civilization. Material success, fame, wealth, and power--birth"
5557,THE RIDE,"even, with all it involves of opportunity and fate--are insignificant,"
5558,THE RIDE,if the soul's life is thus secured. I do not mean that such a thought
5559,THE RIDE,clears the mystery of the different lots of mankind; but it suggests
5560,THE RIDE,another view of the apparent injustice of the world in its most rigid
5561,THE RIDE,"forms. This, however, is a wandering thought. The great reversal of the"
5562,THE RIDE,law of nature in the soul lies in the fact that whereas she proceeds by
5563,THE RIDE,"the selfish will of the strongest trampling out the weak, spiritual law"
5564,THE RIDE,"requires the best to sacrifice itself for the least. Scientific ethics,"
5565,THE RIDE,"which would chloroform the feeble, can never succeed until the race"
5566,THE RIDE,makes bold to amend what it now receives as the mysterious ways of
5567,THE RIDE,"heaven, and identifies a degenerate body with a dead soul. Such a code"
5568,THE RIDE,"is at issue with true democracy, which requires that every soul, being"
5569,THE RIDE,"equal in value in view of its unknown future, shall receive the benefit"
5570,THE RIDE,"of every doubt in earthly life, and be left as a being in the hands of"
5571,THE RIDE,the secret power that ordained its existence in the hour when nature was
5572,THE RIDE,"constituted to be its mode of birth, consciousness, and death. And if"
5573,THE RIDE,"the choice must be made on the broad scale, it is our practical faith"
5574,THE RIDE,"that the service of the best, even to the point of death, is due to the"
5575,THE RIDE,"least in the hope of bettering the lot of man. Hence, as we are willing"
5576,THE RIDE,"that in communities the noblest should die for a cause, we consent to"
5577,THE RIDE,"the death of high civilizations, if they spread in some Hellenization of"
5578,THE RIDE,"a Roman, some Romanizing of a barbaric world; and to the extinction of"
5579,THE RIDE,"aristocracies, if their virtues thereby are disseminated and the social"
5580,THE RIDE,goods they monopolized made common in a people; and to the falling of
5581,THE RIDE,"the flower of man's spirit everywhere, if its seeds be sown on all the"
5582,THE RIDE,winds of the future for the blessing of the world's fuller and more
5583,THE RIDE,"populous life. Such has been the history of our civilization, and still"
5584,THE RIDE,"is, and must be till the whole earth's surface be conquered for"
5585,THE RIDE,"mankind, embodied in its highest ideals, personal and social. This is"
5586,THE RIDE,"not nature's way, who raises her trophy over the slain; our trophy is"
5587,THE RIDE,"man's laurel upon our grave. So, everywhere except in the physical"
5588,THE RIDE,"sphere of life, if you would find the soul's commands, reverse nature's"
5589,THE RIDE,"will. This superiority to nature, as it seems to me, this living in an"
5590,THE RIDE,"element plainly antithetical to her sphere, is a sign of 'an ampler"
5591,THE RIDE,"ether, a diviner air.'"""
5592,THE RIDE,
5593,THE RIDE,"So I spoke, as the words came to me, while we were still driving down"
5594,THE RIDE,"the dark valley, in deeper shadows, under higher bluffs, looking out on"
5595,THE RIDE,"a levelled world westward, stretching off with low, white, wreathing"
5596,THE RIDE,mists and moonlit distances of plains beyond the further bunk. We turned
5597,THE RIDE,"a great shoulder of the hills, and the moon shone out bright and clear,"
5598,THE RIDE,"riding in heaven; and the southward reach unlocked, and gave itself for"
5599,THE RIDE,"miles to our eyes. At the instant, while the ponies came back upon their"
5600,THE RIDE,"haunches at the drop of the long descent ahead, we both cried out, ""the"
5601,THE RIDE,"Looking-glass!"" There it was, about a mile away before and below us, as"
5602,THE RIDE,"plain as a pikestaff,--a silvery reach, like a long narrow lake, smooth"
5603,THE RIDE,"as the floor of cloud seen from above among mountains, silent,"
5604,THE RIDE,"motionless,--for all the world like an immense, spectral looking-glass,"
5605,THE RIDE,set there in the half-darkened waste. It was evidently what gave the
5606,THE RIDE,"name to the creek, and I have since noticed the same name elsewhere in"
5607,THE RIDE,"the Western country, and I suppose the phenomenon is not uncommon. For"
5608,THE RIDE,an hour or more it remained; we never seemed to get nearer to it; it was
5609,THE RIDE,"an eerie thing--the earth-light of the moon on that side,--I saw it all"
5610,THE RIDE,the time.
5611,THE RIDE,
5612,THE RIDE,"""The difference you spoke of,"" I began, with my eyes upon that spectral"
5613,THE RIDE,"pool, ""is only that change which belongs to life, dissolving like"
5614,THE RIDE,"illusion, but not itself illusion. I am not aware of any break; it is"
5615,THE RIDE,"the old life in a higher form with clearer selfhood. Life, in the soul"
5616,THE RIDE,"especially, seems less a state of being than a thing of transformation,"
5617,THE RIDE,whose successive shapes we wear; and so far as that change is
5618,THE RIDE,"self-determined,"" I continued, making almost an effort to think, so"
5619,THE RIDE,"weird was that scene before us, ""the soul proceeds by foreknowledge of"
5620,THE RIDE,"itself in the ideal, and wills the change by ideal living, which is not"
5621,THE RIDE,"a conflict with the actual but a process out of it, conditioned in"
5622,THE RIDE,almost a Darwinian way on that brain-futuring which entered into the
5623,THE RIDE,struggle for animal existence even with such enormous modifying power.
5624,THE RIDE,"In our old days, under the sway of new scientific knowledge, we"
5625,THE RIDE,"instinctively saw man in the perspective of nature, and then man seemed"
5626,THE RIDE,"almost an after-thought of nature; but having been produced, late in her"
5627,THE RIDE,"material history, and gifted with foresight that distinguished him from"
5628,THE RIDE,"all else in her scheme, his own evolution gathered thereby that speed"
5629,THE RIDE,which is so perplexing a contrast to the inconceivable slowness of the
5630,THE RIDE,orbing of stars and the building of continents. He has used his powers
5631,THE RIDE,"of prescience for his own ends; but, fanciful as the thought is, might"
5632,THE RIDE,it happen that through his control of elemental forces and his
5633,THE RIDE,"acquaintance with infinite space, he should reach the point of applying"
5634,THE RIDE,"prescience in nature's own material frame, and wield the world for the"
5635,THE RIDE,"better accomplishment of her apparent ends,--that, though unimaginable"
5636,THE RIDE,"now, would constitute the true polarity to her blind and half-chaotic"
5637,THE RIDE,"motions,--chaotic in intelligence, I mean, and to the moral reason."
5638,THE RIDE,"Unreal as such a thought is, a glimpse of some such feeling toward"
5639,THE RIDE,nature is discernible in the work of some impressionist landscape
5640,THE RIDE,"painters, who present colour and atmosphere and space without human"
5641,THE RIDE,"intention, as a kind of artistry of science, having the same sort of"
5642,THE RIDE,elemental substance and interest that scientific truth has as an object
5643,THE RIDE,"of knowledge,--a curious form of the beauty of truth."""
5644,THE RIDE,
5645,THE RIDE,"We spoke of some illustrations of this, the scene before us lending"
5646,THE RIDE,"atmosphere and suggestion to the talk, and enforcing it like nature's"
5647,THE RIDE,"comment. ""But,"" I continued, ""what I had in mind to say was concerning"
5648,THE RIDE,"our dead selves. The old phrase, _life is a continual dying_, is true,"
5649,THE RIDE,"and, once gone life is death; and sometimes so much of it has been"
5650,THE RIDE,"gathered to the past, such definite portions of it are laid away, that"
5651,THE RIDE,"we can look, if we will, in the lake of memory on the faces of the dead"
5652,THE RIDE,"selves which once we were."" Instinctively we looked on the mystic"
5653,THE RIDE,"glamour in the low valley, as on that Lake of the Dead Souls I spoke of."
5654,THE RIDE,"I went on after the natural pause,--I could not help it,--""'I was a"
5655,THE RIDE,"different man, then,' we say, with a touch of sadness, perhaps, but"
5656,THE RIDE,"often with better thoughts, and always with a feeling of mystery. How"
5657,THE RIDE,old is the youth before he is aware of the fading away of vitality out
5658,THE RIDE,of early beliefs? and then he feels the quick passing of the enthusiasms
5659,THE RIDE,"of opening life, as one cause after another, one hero, one poet,"
5660,THE RIDE,"disclosing the great interests of life, in turn engages his heart. As"
5661,THE RIDE,"time goes on, and life comes out in its true perspective, one thing with"
5662,THE RIDE,"another, and he discovers the incompleteness of single elements of"
5663,THE RIDE,"ardour in the whole of life, and also the defects of wisdom, art, and"
5664,THE RIDE,action in those books and men that had won his full confidence and what
5665,THE RIDE,"he called perfect allegiance, there comes often a moment of pause, as if"
5666,THE RIDE,this growth had in it some thing irrational and derogatory. The thinkers
5667,THE RIDE,"whose words of light and leading were the precious truth itself, the"
5668,THE RIDE,"poets he idolized, the elders he trusted, fall away, and others stand in"
5669,THE RIDE,"their places, who better appeal to his older mind, his finer impulses,"
5670,THE RIDE,his sounder judgment; and what true validity can these last have in the
5671,THE RIDE,"end? After a decade he can almost see his youth as something dead, his"
5672,THE RIDE,"early manhood as something that will die. The poet, especially, who"
5673,THE RIDE,"gives expression to himself, and puts his life at its period into a"
5674,THE RIDE,"book, feels, as each work drops from his hand, that it is a portion of a"
5675,THE RIDE,"self that is dead, though it was life in the making; and so with the"
5676,THE RIDE,"embodiments of life in action, the man looks back on past greatness,"
5677,THE RIDE,"past romance; for all life, working itself out--desire into"
5678,THE RIDE,achievement--dies to the man. Vital life lies always before. It is a
5679,THE RIDE,"strange thought that only by the death of what we now are, can we enter"
5680,THE RIDE,into our own hopes and victories; that it is by the slaying of the self
5681,THE RIDE,which now is that the higher self takes life; that it is through such
5682,THE RIDE,"self-destruction that we live. The intermediate state seems a waste, and"
5683,THE RIDE,the knowledge that it is intermediate seems to impair its value; but
5684,THE RIDE,"this is the way ordained by which we must live, and such is life's magic"
5685,THE RIDE,"that in each stage, from childhood to age, it is lived with trustfulness"
5686,THE RIDE,"in itself. It is needful only, however much we outlive, to live more and"
5687,THE RIDE,"better, and through all to remain true to the high causes, the faithful"
5688,THE RIDE,"loves, the sacred impulses, that have given our imperfect life of the"
5689,THE RIDE,past whatever of nobility it may have; so shall death forever open into
5690,THE RIDE,"life. But,"" I ended, lifting my moist eyes toward the sweep of the dark"
5691,THE RIDE,"slopes, ""the wind blows, and leaves the mystic to inquire whence and"
5692,THE RIDE,"whither, the wild shrub blossoms and only the poet is troubled to excuse"
5693,THE RIDE,"its beauty, and happy is he who can live without too much thought of"
5694,THE RIDE,"life."""
5695,THE RIDE,
5696,THE RIDE,"The sheen of the river had died out, and the creek was only a common"
5697,THE RIDE,"stream lit with the high moon, and bordered far off to the west with the"
5698,THE RIDE,low indistinguishable country. We drove in silence down the valley along
5699,THE RIDE,that shelf of road under the land. The broken bluffs on the left rose
5700,THE RIDE,"into immense slopes of rolling prairie, and magnified by the night"
5701,THE RIDE,"atmosphere into majesty, heavy with deep darkness in their folds, stood"
5702,THE RIDE,"massive and vast in the dusk moonlight, like a sea. Then fell on me and"
5703,THE RIDE,grew with strange insistence the sense of this everlasting mounded power
5704,THE RIDE,"of the earth, like the rise and subsidence of ocean in an element of"
5705,THE RIDE,"slower and more awful might. The solid waste began to loom and lift,"
5706,THE RIDE,almost with the blind internal strength of the whirl of the planet
5707,THE RIDE,through space. Deeper into the shadow we plunged with every echoing
5708,THE RIDE,tread of the hoofs. The lair of some mysterious presence was about
5709,THE RIDE,"us,--unshaped, unrealized, as in some place of antique awe before the"
5710,THE RIDE,time of temples or of gods. It seemed a corporal thing. If I stretched
5711,THE RIDE,out my hand I should touch it like the ground. It came out from all the
5712,THE RIDE,"black rifts, it rolled from the moonlit distinct heights, it filled the"
5713,THE RIDE,"chill air,--it was an envelopment--it would be an engulfment--horse and"
5714,THE RIDE,man we were sinking in it. Then it was--most in all my days--that I felt
5715,THE RIDE,"dense mystery overwhelming me. ""O infinite earth,"" I thought, ""our"
5716,THE RIDE,"unknowing mother, our unknowing grave!""--""What is it?"" he said, feeling"
5717,THE RIDE,"my wrist straighten where it lay on his shoulder, and the tremor and the"
5718,THE RIDE,"hand seeking him. Was it a premonition? ""Nothing,"" I answered, and did"
5719,THE RIDE,"not tell him; but he began to cheer me with lighter talk, and win me"
5720,THE RIDE,"back to the levels of life, and under his sensitive and loving ways, the"
5721,THE RIDE,"excitement of the ride died out, and an hour later, after midnight, we"
5722,THE RIDE,"drove into the silent town. We put the ponies up, praising them with"
5723,THE RIDE,"hand and voice; and then he took both my hands in his and said, ""The"
5724,THE RIDE,"truest thing you ever said was what you wrote me, 'We live each others'"
5725,THE RIDE,"lives.'"" That was his thanks."
5726,THE RIDE,
5727,THE RIDE,"O brave and tender heart, now long lapped under the green fold of that"
5728,THE RIDE,far prairie in his niche of earth! How often I see him as in our first
5729,THE RIDE,"days,--the boy of seventeen summers, lying on his elbows over his"
5730,THE RIDE,"Thackeray, reading by the pictures, and laughing to himself hour after"
5731,THE RIDE,"hour; and many a prairie adventure, many happy days and fortunate"
5732,THE RIDE,"moments come back, with the strength and bloom of youth, as I recall the"
5733,THE RIDE,"manly figure, the sensitive and eager face, and all his resolute ways."
5734,THE RIDE,Who of us knows what he is to another? He could not know how much his
5735,THE RIDE,"life entered into mine, and still enters. But he is dead; and I have set"
5736,THE RIDE,"down these weak and stammering words of the life we began together, not"
5737,THE RIDE,"for the strong and sure, but for those who, though true hearts, find it"
5738,THE RIDE,"hard to lay hold of truth, and doubt themselves, in the hope that some"
5739,THE RIDE,"younger comrade of life, though unknown, may make them of avail and find"
5740,THE RIDE,in them the dark leading of a hand.
