29,PREFACE,
30,PREFACE,The method of studying poetry which I have followed in this book was
31,PREFACE,"sketched some years ago in my chapter on ""Poetry"" in _Counsel Upon the"
32,PREFACE,Reading of Books_. My confidence that the genetic method is the natural
33,PREFACE,way of approaching the subject has been shared by many lovers of poetry.
34,PREFACE,"I hope, however, that I have not allowed my insistence upon the threefold"
35,PREFACE,"process of ""impression, transforming imagination, and expression"" to"
36,PREFACE,harden into a set formula. Formulas have a certain dangerous usefulness
37,PREFACE,"for critics and teachers, but they are a very small part of one's training"
38,PREFACE,in the appreciation of poetry.
39,PREFACE,
40,PREFACE,I have allotted little or no space to the specific discussion of epic and
41,PREFACE,"drama, as these types are adequately treated in many books. Our own"
42,PREFACE,"generation is peculiarly attracted by various forms of the lyric, and in"
43,PREFACE,Part Two I have devoted especial attention to that field.
44,PREFACE,
45,PREFACE,"While I hope that the book may attract the traditional ""general reader,"""
46,PREFACE,I have also tried to arrange it in such a fashion that it may be utilized
47,PREFACE,"in the classroom. I have therefore ventured, in the Notes and"
48,PREFACE,"Illustrations and Appendix, to suggest some methods and material for the"
49,PREFACE,use of students.
50,PREFACE,
51,PREFACE,"I wish to express my obligations to Professor R. M. Alden, whose"
52,PREFACE,_Introduction to Poetry_ and _English Verse_ I have used in my own Harvard
53,PREFACE,courses in poetry. His views of metre have probably influenced mine even
54,PREFACE,"more than I am aware. The last decade, which has witnessed such an"
55,PREFACE,"extraordinary revival of interest in poetry, has produced many valuable"
56,PREFACE,contributions to poetic theory. I have found Professor Fairchild's _Making
57,PREFACE,"of Poetry_ particularly suggestive. Attention is called, in the Notes and"
58,PREFACE,"Bibliography, to many other recent books on the subject."
59,PREFACE,
60,PREFACE,Professors A. S. Cook of Yale and F. B. Snyder of Northwestern University
61,PREFACE,"have been kind enough to read in manuscript certain chapters of this book,"
62,PREFACE,and Dr. P. F. Baum of Harvard has assisted me most courteously. I am
63,PREFACE,indebted to several fellow-writers for their consent to the use of
64,PREFACE,"extracts from their books, particularly to Brander Matthews for a passage"
65,PREFACE,from _These Many Years_ and to Henry Osborn Taylor for a passage from his
66,PREFACE,_Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages_.
67,PREFACE,
68,PREFACE,I wish also to thank the publishers who have generously allowed me to use
69,PREFACE,"brief quotations from copyrighted books, especially Henry Holt & Co. for"
70,PREFACE,permission to use a quotation and drawing from William James's
71,PREFACE,"_Psychology_, and The Macmillan Company for permission to borrow from John"
72,PREFACE,La Farge's delightful _Considerations on Painting_.

139,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,begin the first chapter of this book about poetry. Outside the window
140,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,a woman is contentedly kneeling on the upturned brown earth of her
141,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"tulip-bed, patting lovingly with her trowel as she covers the bulbs"
142,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,for next spring's blossoming. Does she know Katharine Tynan's verses
143,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"about ""Planting Bulbs""? Probably not. But I find myself dropping the"

184,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"not write an opening paragraph, for better for worse, instead of looking"
185,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,out of the window and quoting Katharine Tynan? And then it flashes over
186,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"me, in lieu of answer, that I have just discovered one way of beginning"
187,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the chapter, after all! For what I should like to do in this book is to"
188,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,set forth in decent prose some of the strange potencies of verse: its
189,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"power, for instance, to seize upon a physical image like that of a woman"
190,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"planting bulbs, and transmute it into a symbol of the resurrection of the"
191,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,dead; its capacity for turning fact into truth and brown earth into
192,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,beauty; for remoulding the broken syllables of human speech into sheer
193,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"music; for lifting the mind, bowed down by wearying thought and haunting"
194,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"fear, into a brooding ecstasy wherein weeping is changed into laughter and"
195,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"autumnal premonitions of death into assurance of life, and the narrow"
196,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,paths of individual experience are widened into those illimitable spaces
197,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"where the imagination rules. Poetry does all this, assuredly. But how? And"
198,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,why? That is our problem.
199,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
200,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""The future of poetry is immense,"" declared Matthew Arnold, and there are"
201,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,few lovers of literature who doubt his triumphant assertion. But the past
202,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of poetry is immense also: impressive in its sheer bulk and in its
203,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"immemorial duration. At a period earlier than any recorded history, poetry"
204,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"seems to have occupied the attention of men, and some of the finest"
205,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,spirits in every race that has attained to civilization have devoted
206,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"themselves to its production, or at least given themselves freely to the"
207,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"enjoyment of reciting and reading verse, and of meditating upon its"
208,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,significance. A consciousness of this rich human background should
209,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,accompany each new endeavor to examine the facts about poetry and to
210,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"determine its essential nature. The facts are indeed somewhat complicated,"
211,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"and the nature of poetry, in certain aspects of it, at least, will remain"
212,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,as always a mystery. Yet in that very complication and touch of mystery
213,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,there is a fascination which has laid its spell upon countless generations
214,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of men, and which has been deepened rather than destroyed by the advance"
215,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of science and the results of scholarship. The study of folklore and
216,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,comparative literature has helped to explain some of the secrets of
217,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"poetry; the psychological laboratory, the history of criticism, the"
218,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"investigation of linguistics, the modern developments in music and the"
219,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"other arts, have all contributed something to our intelligent enjoyment of"
220,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the art of poetry and to our sense of its importance in the life of
221,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,humanity. There is no field of inquiry where the interrelations of
222,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,knowledge are more acutely to be perceived. The beginner in the study of
223,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,poetry may at once comfort himself and increase his zest by remembering
224,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"that any real training which he has already had in scientific observation,"
225,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"in the habit of analysis, in the study of races and historic periods, in"
226,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the use of languages, in the practice or interpretation of any of the fine"
227,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"arts, or even in any bodily exercise that has developed his sense of"
228,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"rhythm, will be of ascertainable value to him in this new study."
229,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
230,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,But before attempting to apply his specific knowledge or aptitude to the
231,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"new field for investigation, he should be made aware of some of the wider"
232,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,questions which the study of poetry involves. The first of these questions
233,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,has to do with the relations of the study of poetry to the general field
234,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of Aesthetics.
235,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
236,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
237,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,_1. The Study of Poetry and the Study of Aesthetics_
238,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
239,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,The Greeks invented a convenient word to describe the study of poetry:
240,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""Poetics."" Aristotle's famous fragmentary treatise bore that title, and it"
241,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,was concerned with the nature and laws of certain types of poetry and with
242,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the relations of poetry to the other arts. For the Greeks assumed, as we"
243,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"do, that poetry is an art: that it expresses emotion through words"
244,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,rhythmically arranged. But as soon as they began to inquire into the
245,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,particular kind of emotion which is utilized in poetry and the various
246,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"rhythmical arrangements employed by poets, they found themselves compelled"
247,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,to ask further questions. How do the other arts convey feeling? What
248,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,arrangement or rhythmic ordering of facts do they use in this process?
249,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"What takes place in us as we confront the work of art, or, in other words,"
250,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,what is our reaction to an artistic stimulus?
251,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
252,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"For an answer to such wider questions as these, we moderns turn to the"
253,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"so-called science of Aesthetics. This word, derived from the Greek"
254,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"_aisthanomai_ (to perceive), has been defined as ""anything having to do"
255,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"with perception by the senses."" But it was first used in its present sense"
256,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,by the German thinker Baumgarten in the middle of the eighteenth century.
257,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"He meant by it ""the theory of the fine arts."" It has proved a convenient"
258,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"term to describe both ""The Science of the Beautiful"" and ""The Philosophy"
259,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of Beauty""; that is, both the analysis and classification of beautiful"
260,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,things as well as speculation as to the origin and nature of Beauty
261,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,itself. But it should be borne in mind that aesthetic inquiry and answer
262,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,may precede by thousands of years the use of the formal language of
263,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"aesthetic theory. Mr. Kipling's ""Story of Ung"" cleverly represents the"
264,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,cave-men as discussing the very topics which the contemporary studio and
265,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"classroom strive in vain to settle,--in vain, because they are the eternal"
266,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"problems of art. Here are two faces, two trees, two colors, one of which"
267,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"seems preferable to the other. Wherein lies the difference, as far as the"
268,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,objects themselves are concerned? And what is it which the preferable face
269,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,or tree or color stirs or awakens within us as we look at it? These are
270,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"what we call aesthetic questions, but a man or a race may have a delicate"
271,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,and sure sense of beauty without consciously asking such questions at all.
272,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The awareness of beautiful objects in nature, and even the ability to"
273,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"create a beautiful work of art, may not be accompanied by any gift for"
274,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"aesthetic speculation. Conversely, many a Professor of aesthetics has"
275,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,contentedly lived in an ugly house and you would not think that he had
276,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,ever looked at river or sky or had his pulses quickened by a tune.
277,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Nevertheless, no one can turn the pages of a formal History of Aesthetics"
278,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,without being reminded that the oldest and apparently the most simple
279,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,inquiries in this field may also be the subtlest and in a sense the most
280,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"modern. For illustration, take the three philosophical contributions of"
281,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the Greeks to aesthetic theory, as they are stated by Bosanquet:"
282,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: Bosanquet, _History of Aesthetic_, chap. 3.]"
283,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"(1) the conception that art deals with images, not realities, i.e. with"
284,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"aesthetic ""semblance"" or things as they appear to the artist;"
285,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"(2) the conception that art consists in ""imitation,"" which they carried to"
286,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"an absurdity, indeed, by arguing that an imitation must be less ""valuable"""
287,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,than the thing imitated;
288,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"(3) the conception that beauty consists in certain formal relations, such"
289,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"as symmetry, harmony of parts--in a word, ""unity in variety."""
290,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
291,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Now no one can snap a Kodak effectively without putting into practice the
292,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"first of these conceptions: nor understand the ""new music"" and ""free"
293,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"verse"" without reckoning with both the second and the third. The value to"
294,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the student of poetry of some acquaintance with aesthetic theory is
295,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"sometimes direct, as in the really invaluable discussion contained in"
296,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Aristotle's _Poetics_, but more often, perhaps, it will be found in the"
297,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,indirect stimulus to his sympathy and taste. For he must survey the
298,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"widespread sense of beauty in the ancient world, the splendid periods of"
299,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"artistic creation in the Middle Ages, the growth of a new feeling for"
300,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"landscape and for the richer and deeper human emotions, and the emergence"
301,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of the sense of the ""significant"" or individually ""characteristic"" in"
302,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the work of art. Finally he may come to lose himself with Kant or Hegel or
303,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Coleridge in philosophical theories about the nature of beauty, or to"
304,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,follow the curious analyses of experimental aesthetics in modern
305,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"laboratories, where the psycho-physical reactions to aesthetic stimuli are"
306,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,cunningly registered and the effects of lines and colors and tones upon
307,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the human organism are set forth with mathematical precision. He need not
308,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,trouble himself overmuch at the outset with definitions of Beauty. The
309,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,chief thing is to become aware of the long and intimate preoccupation of
310,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,men with beautiful objects and to remember that any inquiry into the
311,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,nature and laws of poetry will surely lead him into a deeper curiosity as
312,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,to the nature and manifestations of aesthetic feeling in general.
313,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
314,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
315,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,_2. The Impulse to Artistic Production_
316,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
317,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Furthermore, no one can ask himself how it is that a poem comes into being"
318,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,unless he also raises the wider question as to the origin and working of
319,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the creative impulse in the other arts. It is clear that there is a gulf
320,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"between the mere sense of beauty--such as is possessed by primitive man,"
321,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or, in later stages of civilization, by the connoisseur in the fine"
322,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"arts--and the concrete work of art. Thousands enjoy the statue, the"
323,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"symphony, the ode; not one in a thousand can produce these objects."
324,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Mere connoisseurship is sterile. ""The ability to produce one fine line,"""
325,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"said Edward FitzGerald, ""transcends all the Able-Editor ability in this"
326,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"ably-edited universe."" What is the impulse which urges certain persons to"
327,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,create beautiful objects? How is it that they cross the gulf which
328,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,separates the enjoyer from the producer?
329,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
330,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,It is easier to ask this question than to find a wholly satisfactory
331,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"answer to it. Plato's explanation, in the case of the poet, is simple"
332,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"enough: it is the direct inspiration of the divinity,--the ""god"" takes"
333,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"possession of the poet. Perhaps this may be true, in a sense, and we shall"
334,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"revert to it later, but first let us look at some of the conditions for"
335,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the exercise of the creative impulse, as contemporary theorists have"
336,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,endeavored to explain them.
337,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
338,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Social relations, surely, afford one of the obvious conditions for the"
339,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,impulse to art. The hand-clapping and thigh-smiting of primitive savages
340,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"in a state of crowd-excitement, the song-and-dance before admiring"
341,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"spectators, the chorus of primitive ballads,--the crowd repeating and"
342,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"altering the refrains,--the rhythmic song of laboring men and of women at"
343,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"their weaving, sailors' ""chanties,"" the celebration of funeral rites,"
344,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"religious processional and pageant, are all expressions of communal"
345,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"feeling, and it is this communal feeling--""the sense of joy in widest"
346,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"commonalty spread""--which has inspired, in Greece and Italy, some of the"
347,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"greatest artistic epochs. It is true that as civilization has proceeded,"
348,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,this communal emotion has often seemed to fade away and leave us in the
349,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,presence of the individual artist only. We see Keats sitting at his garden
350,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"table writing the ""Ode to Autumn,"" the lonely Shelley in the Cascine at"
351,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Florence composing the ""West Wind,"" Wordsworth pacing the narrow walk"
352,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"behind Dove Cottage and mumbling verses, Beethoven in his garret writing"
353,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,music. But the creative act thus performed in solitude has a singular
354,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"potency, after all, for arousing that communal feeling which in the moment"
355,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of creation the artist seems to escape. What he produces in his loneliness
356,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the world does not willingly let die. His work, as far as it becomes"
357,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"known, really unites mankind. It fulfills a social purpose. ""Its function"
358,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"is social consolidation."""
359,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
360,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Tolstoy made so much of this ""transmission of emotion,"" this ""infectious"""
361,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"quality of art as a means of union among men, that he reduced a good case"
362,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"to an absurdity, for he argued himself into thinking that if a given work"
363,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of art does not infect the spectator--and preferably the uneducated
364,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""peasant"" spectator--with emotion, it is therefore not art at all. He"
365,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,overlooked the obvious truth that there are certain types of difficult
366,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or intricate beauty--in music, in architecture, and certainly in"
367,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,poetry--which so tax the attention and the analytical and reflective
368,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"powers of the spectator as to make the inexperienced, uncultured spectator"
369,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or hearer simply unaware of the presence of beauty. Debussy's music,"
370,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Browning's dramatic monologues, Henry James's short stories, were not"
371,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"written for Tolstoy's typical peasant. They would ""transmit"" to him"
372,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"nothing at all. But although Tolstoy, a man of genius, overstated his case"
373,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"with childlike perversity, he did valuable service in insisting upon"
374,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,emotion as a basis for the art-impulse. The creative instinct is
375,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"undeniably accompanied by strong feeling, by pleasure in the actual work"
376,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of production and in the resultant object, and something of this pleasure"
377,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,in the harmonious expression of emotion is shared by the competent
378,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,observer. The permanent vitality of a work of art does consist in its
379,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,capacity for stimulating and transmitting pleasure. One has only to think
380,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of Gray's ""Elegy"" and the delight which it has afforded to generations of"
381,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,men.
382,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
383,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Another conception of the artistic impulse seeks to ally it with the
384,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""play-instinct."" According to Kant and Schiller there is a free ""kingdom"
385,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of play"" between the urgencies of necessity and of duty, and in this"
386,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,sphere of freedom a man's whole nature has the chance to manifest itself.
387,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"He is wholly man only when he ""plays,"" that is, when he is free to create."
388,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Herbert Spencer and many subsequent theorists have pointed out the analogy
389,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"between the play of young animals, the free expression of their surplus"
390,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"energy, their organic delight in the exercise of their muscles, and that"
391,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""playful"" expenditure of a surplus of vitality which seems to characterize"
392,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the artist. This analogy is curiously suggestive, though it is"
393,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,insufficient to account for all the phenomena concerned in human artistic
394,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,production.
395,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
396,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The play theory, again, suggests that old and clairvoyant perception of"
397,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the Greeks that the art-impulse deals with aesthetic appearances rather
398,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,than with realities as such. The artist has to do with the semblance of
399,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"things; not with things as they ""are in themselves"" either physically or"
400,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"logically, but with things as they appear to him. The work of the"
401,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,impressionist painter or the imagist poet illustrates this conception. The
402,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"conventions of the stage are likewise a case in point. Stage settings,"
403,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"conversations, actions, are all affected by the ""_optique du théâtre_"""
404,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"they are composed in a certain ""key"" which seeks to give a harmonious"
405,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"impression, but which conveys frankly semblance and not reality. The"
406,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"craving for ""real"" effects upon the stage is anti-aesthetic, like those"
407,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,gladiatorial shows where persons were actually killed. I once saw an
408,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"unskilful fencer, acting the part of Romeo, really wound Tybalt: the"
409,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"effect was lifelike, beyond question, but it was shocking."
410,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
411,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"From this doctrine of aesthetic semblance or ""appearance"" many thinkers"
412,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,have drawn the conclusion that the pleasures afforded by art must in their
413,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"very nature be disinterested and sharable. Disinterested, because they"
414,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"consist so largely in delighted contemplation merely. Women on the stage,"
415,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"said Coquelin, should afford to the spectator ""a theatrical pleasure only,"
416,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"and not the pleasure of a lover."" Compare with this the sprightly egotism"
417,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of the lyric poet's
418,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
419,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""If she be not so to me,"
420,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"What care I how fair she be?"""
421,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
422,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,A certain aloofness is often felt to characterize great art: it is
423,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,perceived in the austerity and reserve of the Psyche of Naples and the
424,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Venus of Melos:
425,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
426,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""And music pours on mortals"
427,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Its beautiful disdain."""
428,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
429,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The lower pleasures of the senses of taste and touch, it is often pointed"
430,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"out, are less pleasurable than the other senses when revived by memory."
431,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Your dinner is _your_ dinner--your exclusive proprietorship of lower
432,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,pleasure--in a sense in which the snowy linen and gleaming silver and
433,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,radiant flowers upon the table are not yours only because they are
434,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"sharable. If music follows the dinner, though it be your favorite tune, it"
435,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,is nevertheless not yours as what you have eaten is yours. Acute observers
436,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"like Santayana have denied or minimized this distinction, but the general"
437,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,instinct of men persists in calling the pleasures of color and form and
438,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"sound ""sharable,"" because they exist for all who can appreciate them."
439,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The individual's happiness in these pleasures is not lessened, but rather"
440,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"increased, by the coexistent happiness of others in the same object."
441,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
442,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,There is one other aspect of the artistic impulse which is of peculiar
443,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,importance to the student of poetry. It is this: the impulse toward
444,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,artistic creation always works along lines of order. The creative impulse
445,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"may remain a mystery in its essence, the play of blind instinct, as many"
446,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,philosophers have supposed; a portion of the divine energy which is
447,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"somehow given to men. All sorts of men, good and bad, cultured and savage,"
448,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,have now and again possessed this vital creative power. They have been
449,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,able to say with Thomas Lovell Beddoes:
450,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
451,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""I have a bit of fiat in my soul,"
452,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"And can myself create my little world."""
453,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
454,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,The little world which their imagination has created may be represented
455,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,only by a totem pole or a colored basket or a few scratches on a piece of
456,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,bone; or it may be a temple or a symphony. But if it be anything more than
457,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the mere whittling of a stick to exercise surplus energy, it is ordered"
458,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,play or labor. It follows a method. It betrays  remeditation. It is the
459,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,expression of something in the mind. And even the mere whittler usually
460,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"whittles his stick to a point: that is, he is ""making"" something."
461,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"His knife, almost before he is aware of what he is doing, follows a"
462,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,pattern--invented in his brain on the instant or remembered from other
463,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"patterns. He gets pleasure from the sheer muscular activity, and from"
464,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,his tactile sense of the bronze or steel as it penetrates the softer wood.
465,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"But he gets a higher pleasure still from his pattern, from his sense of"
466,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"making something, no matter how idly. And as soon as the pattern or"
467,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"purpose or ""design"" is recognized by others the maker's pleasure is"
468,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"heightened, sharable. For he has accomplished the miracle: he has thrown"
469,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the raw material of feeling into form--and that form itself yields
470,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"pleasure. His ""bit of fiat"" has taken a piece of wood and transformed it:"
471,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"made it expressive of something. All the ""arts of design"" among primitive"
472,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,races show this pattern-instinct.
473,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
474,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,But the impulse toward an ordered expression of feeling is equally
475,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,apparent in the rudimentary stages of music and poetry. The striking of
476,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"hands or feet in unison, the rhythmic shout of many voices, the regular"
477,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"beat of the tom-tom, the excited spectators of a college athletic contest"
478,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,as they break spontaneously from individual shouting into waves of
479,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"cheering and of song, the quickened feet of negro stevedores as some one"
480,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"starts a tune, the children's delight in joining hands and moving in a"
481,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"circle, all serve to illustrate the law that as feeling gains in intensity"
482,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"it tends toward ordered expression. Poetry, said Coleridge, in one of his"
483,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"marvelous moments of insight, is the result of ""a more than usual state of"
484,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"emotion"" combined ""with more than usual order."""
485,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
486,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,What has been said about play and sharable pleasure and the beginning of
487,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,design has been well summarized by Sidney Colvin:
488,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: Article on ""The Fine Arts"" in _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.]"
489,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
490,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""There are some things which we do because we must; these are our"
491,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,necessities. There are other things which we do because we ought; these
492,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,are our duties. There are other things which we do because we like; these
493,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,are our play. Among the various kinds of things done by men only because
494,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"they like, the fine arts are those of which the results afford to many"
495,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"permanent and disinterested delight, and of which the performance, calling"
496,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"for premeditated skill, is capable of regulation up to a certain point,"
497,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"but that point passed, has secrets beyond the reach and a freedom beyond"
498,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the restraint of rules."""
499,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
500,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
501,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"_3. ""Form"" and ""Significance"" in the Arts_"
502,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
503,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"If the fine arts, then, deal with the ordered or harmonious expression of"
504,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"feeling, it is clear that any specific work of art may be regarded, at"
505,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"least theoretically, from two points of view. We may look at its ""outside"""
506,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or its ""inside""; that is to say at its ordering of parts, its pattern, its"
507,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""form,"" or else at the feeling or idea which it conveys. This distinction"
508,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"between form and content, between expression and that which is expressed,"
509,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"is temptingly convenient. It is a useful tool of analysis, but it is"
510,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,dangerous to try to make it anything more than that. If we were looking at
511,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"a water-pipe and the water which flows through it, it would be easy to"
512,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"keep a clear distinction between the form of the iron pipe, and its"
513,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"content of water. But in certain of the fine arts very noticeably, such as"
514,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"music, and in a diminished degree, poetry, and more or less in all of"
515,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"them, the form is the expression or content. A clear-cut dissection of the"
516,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"component elements of outside and inside, of water-pipe and water within"
517,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"it, becomes impossible. Listening to music is like looking at a brook;"
518,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"there is no inside and outside, it is all one intricately blended complex"
519,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of sensation. Music is a perfect example of ""embodied feeling,"" as"
520,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"students of aesthetics term it, and the body is here inseparable from the"
521,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"feeling. But in poetry, which is likewise embodied feeling, it is somewhat"
522,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"easier to attempt, for purposes of logical analysis, a separation of the"
523,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"component elements of thought (i.e. ""content"") and form. We speak"
524,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"constantly of the ""idea"" of a poem as being more or less adequately"
525,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""expressed,"" that is, rendered in terms of form. The actual form of a"
526,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"given lyric may or may not be suited to its mood,"
527,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: Certainly not, for instance, in Wordsworth's ""Reverie of Poor"
528,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Susan.""]"
529,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,or the poet may not have been a sufficiently skilful workman to achieve
530,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"success in the form or ""pattern"" which he has rightly chosen."
531,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
532,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Even in poetry, then, the distinction between inside and outside,"
533,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"content and form, has sometimes its value, and in other arts, like"
534,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"painting and sculpture, it often becomes highly interesting and"
535,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,instructive to attempt the separation of the two elements. The French
536,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"painter Millet, for instance, is said to have remarked to a pupil who"
537,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"showed him a well-executed sketch: ""You can paint. But what have you to"
538,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"say?"" The pupil's work had in Millet's eyes no ""significance."" The English"
539,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"painter G. F. Watts often expressed himself in the same fashion: ""I paint"
540,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,first of all because I have something to say.... My intention has not been
541,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,so much to paint pictures that will charm the eye as to suggest great
542,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,thoughts that will appeal to the imagination and the heart and kindle all
543,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,that is best and noblest in humanity.... My work is a protest against the
544,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"modern opinion that Art should have nothing to say intellectually."""
545,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
546,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"On the other hand, many distinguished artists and critics have given"
547,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"assent to what has been called the ""Persian carpet"" theory of painting."
548,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,According to them a picture should be judged precisely as one judges a
549,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Persian rug--by the perfection of its formal beauty, its harmonies of"
550,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"line, color and texture, its ""unity in variety."" It is evident that the"
551,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"men who hold this opinion are emphasizing form in the work of art, and"
552,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,that Millet and Watts emphasized significance. One school is thinking
553,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"primarily of expression, and the other of that which is expressed. The"
554,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,important point for the student of poetry to grasp is that this divergence
555,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of opinion turns upon the question of relative emphasis. Even pure form,"
556,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or ""a-priori form"" as it has sometimes been called,--such as a"
557,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"rectangle, a square, a cube,--carries a certain element of association"
558,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,which gives it a degree of significance. There is no absolutely bare or
559,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"blank pattern. ""Four-square"" means something to the mind, because it is"
560,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,intimately connected with our experience.
561,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: See Bosanquet, _Three Lectures on Aesthetic_, pp. 19, 29, 39,"
562,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"and Santayana, _The Sense of Beauty_, p. 83.]"
563,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"It cannot be a mere question of balance, parallelism and abstract ""unity"
564,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"in variety."" The acanthus design in architectural ornament, the Saracenic"
565,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"decoration on a sword-blade, aim indeed primarily at formal beauty and"
566,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,little more. The Chinese laundryman hands you a red slip of paper covered
567,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,with strokes of black ink in strange characters. It is undecipherable to
568,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"you, yet it possesses in its sheer charm of color and line, something of"
569,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"beauty, and the freedom and vigor of the strokes are expressive of"
570,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,vitality. It is impossible that Maud's face should really have been
571,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
572,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null,"
573,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Dead perfection, no more."""
574,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
575,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Nevertheless, though absolutely pure decorative beauty does not exist, the"
576,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"artist may push the decorative principle very far, so far, indeed, that"
577,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,his product lacks interest and proves tedious or nonsensical. There is
578,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""nonsense-verse,"" as we shall see later, which fulfills every condition"
579,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"for pure formal beauty in poetry. Yet it is not poetry, but only"
580,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,nonsense-verse.
581,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
582,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Now shift the interest from the form to the meaning contained in the work
583,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of art, that is, to its significance. An expressive face is one that"
584,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,reveals character. Its lines are suggestive of something. They are
585,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"associated, like the lines of purely decorative beauty, with more or less"
586,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"obscure tracts of our experience, but they arouse a keen mental interest."
587,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"They stimulate, they are packed closely with meaning, with fact, with"
588,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,representative quality. The same thing is true of certain landscapes.
589,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Witness Thomas Hardy's famous description of Egdon Heath in _The Return of
590,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the Native_. It is true of music. Certain modern music almost breaks down,"
591,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"as music, under the weight of meaning, of fact, of thought, which the"
592,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,composer has striven to make it carry.
593,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
594,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,There is no question that the principle of significance may be pushed too
595,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"far, just as the principle of decorative or purely formal beauty may be"
596,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,emphasized too exclusively. But is there any real antagonism between the
597,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"elements of form and significance, beauty and expressiveness? This"
598,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,question has been debated ever since the time of Winckelmann and Lessing.
599,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The controversy over the work of such artists as Wagner, Browning,"
600,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Whitman, Rodin has turned largely upon it."
601,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
602,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Browning himself strove to cut the difficult aesthetic knot with a rough
603,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,stroke of common sense:
604,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
605,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""Is it so pretty"
606,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"You can't discover if it means hope, fear,"
607,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Sorrow or joy? Won't beauty go with these?"""
608,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: ""Fra Lippo Lippi.""]"
609,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
610,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,He tried again in the well-known passage from _The Ring and the Book_:
611,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
612,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""So may you paint your picture, twice show truth,"
613,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Beyond mere imagery on the wall,--"
614,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,So note by note bring music from your mind
615,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Deeper than ever e'en Beethoven dived,--"
616,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"So write a book shall mean beyond the facts,"
617,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Suffice the eye and save the soul beside."""
618,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
619,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"How Whistler, the author of _Ten O'Clock_ and the creator of exquisitely"
620,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"lovely things, must have loathed that final line! But Bosanquet's"
621,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"carefully framed definition of the beautiful, in his _History of"
622,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Aesthetic_, endeavors, like Browning, to adjust the different claims of"
623,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"form and significance: ""The beautiful is that which has characteristic or"
624,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"individual expressiveness for sense-perception or imagination, subject to"
625,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the conditions of general or abstract expressiveness in the same medium."""
626,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"That is to say, in less philosophical language, that as long as you"
627,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,observe the laws of formal beauty which belong to the medium in which you
628,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"are working, you may be as expressive or significant as you like. But the"
629,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,artist must be obedient to the terms of his chosen medium of expression;
630,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,if he is composing music or poetry he must not break the general laws of
631,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,music or poetry in order to attempt that valiant enterprise of saving a
632,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,soul.
633,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
634,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
635,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,_4. The Man in the Work of Art_
636,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
637,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Though there is much in this matter of content and form which is baffling
638,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"to the student of general aesthetic theory, there is at least one aspect"
639,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,of the question which the student of poetry must grasp clearly. It is
640,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,this: there is nothing in any work of art except what some man has put
641,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,there. _What he has put in_ is our content question; _what shape he has
642,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,put it into_ is our form question. In Bosanquet's more technical language:
643,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""A man is the middle term between content and expression."" There is"
644,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"doubtless some element of mystery in what we call creative power, but this"
645,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,is a part of man's mystery. There is no mystery in the artist's material
646,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,as such: he is working in pigments or clay or vibrating sound or whatever
647,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,other medium he has chosen. The qualities and possibilities of this
648,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"particular medium fascinate him, preoccupy him. He comes, as we say, to"
649,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"think in terms of color or line or sound. He learns or may learn in time,"
650,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"as Whistler bade him, ""never to push a medium further than it will go."""
651,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"The chief value of Lessing's epoch-making discussion of ""time-arts"" and"
652,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""space-arts"" in his _Laokoon_ consisted in the emphasis laid upon the"
653,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"specific material of the different arts, and hence upon the varying"
654,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,opportunities which one medium or another affords to the artist. But
655,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,though human curiosity never wearies of examining the inexhaustible
656,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"possibilities of this or that material, it is chiefly concerned, after"
657,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"all, in the use of material as it has been moulded by the fingers and the"
658,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,brain of a particular artist. The material becomes transformed as it
659,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"passes through his ""shop,"" in some such way as iron is transformed into"
660,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"steel in a blast furnace. An apparatus called a ""transformer"" alters the"
661,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,wave-length of an electrical current and reduces high pressure to low
662,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"pressure, or the reverse. The brain of the artist seems to function in a"
663,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,somewhat similar manner as it reshapes the material furnished it by the
664,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"senses, and expresses it in new forms. Poetry furnishes striking"
665,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,illustrations of the transformations wrought in the crucible of the
666,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"imagination, and we must look at these in detail in a subsequent chapter."
667,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,But it may be helpful here to quote the testimony of two or three artists
668,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,and then to examine the psychological basis of this central function of
669,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the artist's mind.
670,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
671,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""Painting is the expression of certain sensations,"" said Carolus Duran."
672,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""You should not seek merely to copy the model that is posed before you,"
673,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,but rather to take into account the impression that is made upon the
674,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,mind.... Take careful account of the substances that you must
675,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"render--wood, metal, textures, for instance. When you fail to reproduce"
676,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"nature _as you feel it_, then you falsify it. _Painting is not done with"
677,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the eyes, but with the brain_."""
678,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
679,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"W. W. Story, the sculptor, wrote: ""Art is art because it is not nature...."
680,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,The most perfect imitation of nature is therefore not art. _It must pass
681,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,through the mind of the artist and be changed_. Art is nature reflected
682,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"through the spiritual mirror, and tinged with all the sentiment, feeling,"
683,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"passion of the spirit that reflects it."""
684,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
685,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"In John La Farge's _Considerations on Painting_, a little book which is"
686,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"full of suggestiveness to the student of literature, there are many"
687,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"passages illustrating the conception of art as ""the representation of the"
688,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"artist's view of the world."" La Farge points out that ""drawing from life"
689,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,is an exercise of memory. It might be said that the sight of the moment is
690,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"merely a theme upon which we embroider the memories of former likings,"
691,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"former aspirations, former habits, images that we have cared for, and"
692,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"through which we indicate to others our training, our race, the entire"
693,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"educated part of our nature."""
694,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
695,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,One of La Farge's concrete examples must be quoted at length:
696,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"[Footnote: _Considerations on Painting_, pp. 71-73. Macmillan.]"
697,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
698,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""I remember myself, years ago, sketching with two well-known men,"
699,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"artists who were great friends, great cronies, asking each other all"
700,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the time, how to do this and how to do that; but absolutely"
701,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,different in the texture of their minds and in the result that they
702,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"wished to obtain, so far as the pictures and drawings by which they"
703,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,were well known to the public are concerned.
704,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
705,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""What we made, or rather, I should say, what we wished to note, was"
706,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,merely a memorandum of a passing effect upon the hills that lay
707,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"before us. We had no idea of expressing ourselves, or of studying in"
708,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,any way the subject for any future use. We merely had the intention
709,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"to note this affair rapidly, and we had all used the same words to"
710,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,express to each other what we liked in it. There were big clouds
711,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"rolling over hills, sky clearing above, dots of trees and water and"
712,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"meadow-land below us, and the ground fell away suddenly before us."
713,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Well, our three sketches were, in the first place, different in"
714,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"shape; either from our physical differences, or from a habit of"
715,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"drawing certain shapes of a picture, which itself usually"
716,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"indicates--as you know, or ought to know--whether we are looking far"
717,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"or near. Two were oblong, but of different proportions; one was more"
718,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,nearly a square; the distance taken in to the right and left was
719,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"smaller in the latter case, and, on the contrary, the height up and"
720,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"down--that is to say, the portion of land beneath and the portion of"
721,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,sky above--was greater. In each picture the clouds were treated with
722,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,different precision and different attention. In one picture the open
723,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,sky above was the main intention of the picture. In two pictures the
724,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,upper sky was of no consequence--it was the clouds and the mountains
725,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"that were insisted upon. The drawing was the same, that is to say,"
726,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,the general make of things; but each man had involuntarily looked
727,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,upon what was most interesting to him in the whole sight; and though
728,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"the whole sight was what he meant to represent, he had unconsciously"
729,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,preferred a beauty or an interest of things different from what his
730,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,neighbour liked.
731,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
732,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""The colour of each painting was different--the vivacity of colour"
733,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"and tone, the distinctness of each part in relation to the whole;"
734,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,and each picture would have been recognized anywhere as a specimen
735,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"of work by each one of us, characteristic of our names. And we spent"
736,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,on the whole affair perhaps twenty minutes.
737,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
738,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"""I wish you to understand, again, that we each thought and felt as if"
739,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,we had been photographing the matter before us. We had not the first
740,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"desire of expressing _ourselves_, and I think would have been very"
741,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,much worried had we not felt that each one was true to nature. And
742,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,we were each one true to nature.... If you ever know how to paint
743,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"somewhat well, and pass beyond the position of the student who has"
744,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,not yet learned to use his hands as an expression of the memories of
745,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"his brain, you will always give to nature, that is to say, what is"
746,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"outside of you, the character of the lens through which you see"
747,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"it--which is yourself."""
748,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
749,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Such bits of testimony from painters help us to understand the brief
750,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"sayings of the critics, like Taine's well-known ""Art is nature seen"
751,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"through a temperament,"" G. L. Raymond's ""Art is nature made human,"" and"
752,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Croce's ""Art is the expression of impressions."" These painters and critics"
753,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"agree, evidently, that the mind of the artist is an organism which acts as"
754,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"a ""transformer."" It receives the reports of the senses, but alters these"
755,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,reports in transmission and it is precisely in this alteration that the
756,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,most personal and essential function of the  artist's brain is to be
757,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,found.
758,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
759,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,"Remembering this, let the student of poetry now recall the diagram used in"
760,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,handbooks of psychology to illustrate the process of sensory stimulus of a
761,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,nerve-centre and the succeeding motor reaction. The diagram is usually
762,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,drawn after this fashion:
763,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,
764,A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND,Sensory stimulus           Nerve-centre          Motor Reaction
765,________________________________O______________________________,________________________________O______________________________
766,________________________________O______________________________,-------------------->                 -------------------->
767,________________________________O______________________________,
768,________________________________O______________________________,The process is thus described by William James:
769,________________________________O______________________________,"[Footnote: _Psychology, Briefer Course_, American Science Series, p. 91."
770,________________________________O______________________________,Henry Holt.]
771,________________________________O______________________________,
772,________________________________O______________________________,"""The afferent nerves, when excited by some physical irritant, be this as"
773,________________________________O______________________________,gross in its mode of operation as a chopping axe or as subtle as the
774,________________________________O______________________________,"waves of light, convey the excitement to the nervous centres. The"
775,________________________________O______________________________,"commotion set up in the centres does not stop there, but discharges"
776,________________________________O______________________________,"through the efferent nerves, exciting movements which vary with the"
777,________________________________O______________________________,"animal and with the irritant applied."""
778,________________________________O______________________________,
779,________________________________O______________________________,The familiar laboratory experiment irritates with a drop of acid the hind
780,________________________________O______________________________,"leg of a frog. Even if the frog's brain has been removed, leaving the"
781,________________________________O______________________________,"spinal cord alone to represent the nervous system, the stimulus of the"
782,________________________________O______________________________,"acid results in an instant movement of the leg. Sensory stimulus,"
783,________________________________O______________________________,consequent excitement of the nerve centre and then motor reaction is the
784,________________________________O______________________________,law. Thus an alarmed cuttlefish secretes an inky fluid which colors the
785,________________________________O______________________________,sea-water and serves as his protection. Such illustrations may be
786,________________________________O______________________________,multiplied indefinitely.
787,________________________________O______________________________,"[Footnote: See the extremely interesting statement by Sara Teasdale,"
788,________________________________O______________________________,"quoted in Miss Wilkinson's _New Voices_, p. 199. Macmillan, 1919.]"
789,________________________________O______________________________,It may seem fanciful to insist upon the analogy between a frightened
790,________________________________O______________________________,cuttlefish squirting ink into sea-water and an agitated poet spreading ink
791,________________________________O______________________________,"upon paper, but in both cases, as I have said elsewhere, ""it is a question"
792,________________________________O______________________________,"of an organism, a stimulus and a reaction. The image of the solitary"
793,________________________________O______________________________,"reaper stirs a Wordsworth, and the result is a poem; a profound sorrow"
794,________________________________O______________________________,"comes to Alfred Tennyson, and he produces _In Memoriam_."""

797,________________________________O______________________________,
798,________________________________O______________________________,In the next chapter we must examine this process with more detail. But the
799,________________________________O______________________________,person who asks himself how poetry comes into being will find a
800,________________________________O______________________________,"preliminary answer by reflecting upon the relation of ""impression"" to"
801,________________________________O______________________________,"""expression"" in every nerve-organism, and in all the arts. Everywhere he"
802,________________________________O______________________________,"must reckon with this ceaseless current of impressions, ""the stream of"
803,________________________________O______________________________,"consciousness,"" sweeping inward to the brain; everywhere he will detect"
804,________________________________O______________________________,"modification, selections, alterations in the stream as it passes through"
805,________________________________O______________________________,the higher nervous centres; everywhere he will find these transformed
806,________________________________O______________________________,"""impressions"" expressed in the terms of some specific medium. Thus the"
807,________________________________O______________________________,temple of Karnak expresses in huge blocks of stone an imagination which
808,________________________________O______________________________,has brooded over the idea of the divine permanence. The Greek
809,________________________________O______________________________,"""discus-thrower"" is the idealized embodiment of a typical kind of athlete,"
810,________________________________O______________________________,a conception resulting from countless visual and tactile sensations. An
811,________________________________O______________________________,"American millionaire buys a ""Corot"" or a ""Monet,"" that is to say, a piece"
812,________________________________O______________________________,of colored canvas upon which a highly individualized artistic temperament
813,________________________________O______________________________,has recorded its vision or impression of some aspect of the world as it
814,________________________________O______________________________,has been interpreted by Corot's or Monet's eye and brain and hand. A
815,________________________________O______________________________,"certain stimulus or ""impression,"" an organism which reshapes impressions,"
816,________________________________O______________________________,"and then an ""expression"" of these transformed impressions into the terms"
817,________________________________O______________________________,permitted by some specific material: that is the threefold process which
818,________________________________O______________________________,seems to be valid in all of the fine arts. It is nowhere more intricately
819,________________________________O______________________________,fascinating than in poetry.

832,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"J. A. STEWART, _The Myths of Plato_"
833,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
834,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,In the previous chapter we have attempted a brief survey of some of the
835,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,general aesthetic questions which arise whenever we consider the form and
836,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,meaning of the fine arts. We must now try to look more narrowly at the
837,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"special field of poetry, asking ourselves how it comes into being, what"
838,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"material it employs, and how it uses this material to secure those"
839,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"specific effects which we all agree in calling ""poetical,"" however widely"
840,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,we may differ from one another in our analysis of the means by which the
841,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,effect is produced.
842,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
843,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Let us begin with a truism. It is universally admitted that poetry, like"
844,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"each of the fine arts, has a field of its own. To run a surveyor's"
845,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"line accurately around the borders of this field, determining what belongs"
846,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"to it rather than to the neighboring arts, is always difficult and"
847,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sometimes impossible. But the field itself is admittedly ""there,"" in all"
848,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"its richness and beauty, however bitterly the surveyors may quarrel about"
849,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,the boundary lines. (It is well to remember that professional surveyors do
850,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,not themselves own these fields or raise any crops upon them!) How much
851,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,map-making ingenuity has been devoted to this task of grouping and
852,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"classifying the arts: distinguishing between art and fine art, between"
853,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"artist, artificer and artisan; seeking to arrange a hierarchy of the arts"
854,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"on the basis of their relative freedom from fixed ends, their relative"
855,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"complexity or comprehensiveness of effect, their relative obligation to"
856,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,imitate or represent something that exists in nature! No one cares
857,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,particularly to-day about such matters of precedence--as if the arts were
858,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,walking in a carefully ordered ecclesiastical procession. On the other
859,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"hand, there is ever-increasing recognition of the soundness of the"
860,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,distinction made by Lessing in his _Laokoon: or the Limits of Painting and
861,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Poetry_; namely, that the fine arts differ, as media of expression,"
862,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"according to the nature of the material which they employ. That is to say,"
863,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the ""time-arts""--like poetry and music--deal primarily with actions that"
864,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"succeed one another in time. The space-arts--painting, sculpture,"
865,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,architecture--deal primarily with bodies that coexist in space. Hence
866,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"there are some subjects that belong naturally in the ""painting"" group, and"
867,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"others that belong as naturally in the ""poetry"" group. The artist should"
868,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"not ""confuse the genres,"" or, to quote Whistler again, he should not push"
869,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,a medium further than it will go. Recent psychology has more or less upset
870,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Lessing's technical theory of vision,"
871,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"[Footnote: F. E. Bryant, _The Limits of Descriptive Writing_, etc. Ann"
872,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Arbor, 1906.]"
873,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,but it has confirmed the value of his main contention as to the fields
874,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of the various arts.
875,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
876,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
877,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,_1. The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice_
878,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
879,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,An illustration will make this matter clear. Let us take the Greek myth of
880,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Orpheus and Eurydice, which has been utilized by many artists during more"
881,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"than two thousand years assuredly, and how much longer no one knows."
882,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Virgil told it in the _Georgics_ and Ovid in the _Metamorphoses_. It
883,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"became a favorite theme of medieval romance, and whether told in a French"
884,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"_lai_ or Scottish ballad like ""King Orfeo,"" it still keeps, among all the"
885,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"strange transformations which it has undergone, ""the freshness of the"
886,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"early world."" Let us condense the story from King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon"
887,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"version of Boethius's _De Consolatione Philosophiae_: ""There was once a"
888,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,famous Thracian harper named Orpheus who had a beautiful wife named
889,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Eurydice. She died and went to hell. Orpheus longed sorrowfully for her,"
890,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,harping so sweetly that the very woods and wild beasts listened to his
891,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"woe. Finally, he resolved to seek her in hell and win her back by his"
892,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,skill. And he played so marvelously there that the King of Hell to reward
893,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"him gave him back his wife again, only upon the condition that he should"
894,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"not turn back to look at her as he led her forth. But, alas, who can"
895,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"constrain love? When Orpheus came to the boundary of darkness and light,"
896,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"he turned round to see if his wife was following--and she vanished."""
897,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
898,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Such was the myth in one of its manifold European forms. It deals
899,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"obviously with a succession of events, with actions easily narratable by"
900,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"means of a ""time-art"" like poetry. The myth itself is one of fascinating"
901,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"human interest, and if a prose writer like Hawthorne had chosen to tell it"
902,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"in his _Wonder-Book_, we should doubtless speak of it as a ""poetic"" story."
903,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"We should mean, in using that adjective, that the myth contained"
904,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sentiment, imagination, passion, dramatic climax, pathos--the qualities"
905,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"which we commonly associate with poetry--and that Hawthorne, although a"
906,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"prose writer, had such an exquisite sympathy for Greek stories that his"
907,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"handling of the material would be as delicate, and the result possibly as"
908,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"lovely, as if the tale had been told in verse. But if we would realize the"
909,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"full value of Lessing's distinction, we must turn to one of the countless"
910,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"verse renderings of the myth. Here we have a succession of actions,"
911,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"indeed, quite corresponding to those of the prose story. But these images"
912,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"of action, succeeding one another in time, are now evoked by successive"
913,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"musical sounds,--the sounds being, as in prose, arbitrary word-symbols of"
914,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"image and idea,--only that in poetry the sounds have a certain ordered"
915,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,arrangement which heightens the emotional effect of the images evoked.
916,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Prose writer and poet might mean to tell precisely the same tale, but in"
917,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"reality they cannot, for one is composing, no matter how cunningly, in the"
918,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,tunes of prose and the other in the tunes of verse. The change in the
919,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,instrument means an alteration in the mental effect.
920,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
921,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Now turn to Lessing's other exemplar of the time-arts, the musician--for"
922,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"musicians as well as poets, painters and sculptors have utilized the myth"
923,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of Orpheus and Eurydice. What can the musician do with the theme? Gluck's
924,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"opera may serve for answer. He cannot, by the aid of music alone, call up"
925,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,very definite ideas or images. He cannot tell the Orpheus story clearly to
926,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"one who has never heard it. But to one who already knows the tale, a"
927,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,composer's overture--without stage accessories or singing actors or any
928,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""operatic"" devices as such--furnishes in its successions and combinations"
929,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"of musical sound, without the use of verbal symbols, a unique pleasurable"
930,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,emotion which strongly and powerfully reinforces the emotions suggested by
931,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the Orpheus myth itself. Certain portions of the story, such as those"
932,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"relating to the wondrous harping, can obviously be interpreted better"
933,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,through music than through the medium of any other art.
934,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
935,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"What can Lessing's ""space-arts,"" sculpture and painting, do with the"
936,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,material furnished by the Orpheus myth? It is clear that they cannot tell
937,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the whole story, since they are dealing with ""bodies that coexist"" rather"
938,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,than with successive actions. They must select some one instant of action
939,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"only, and preferably the most significant moment of the whole, the parting"
940,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of husband and wife. In the museum at Naples there is the wonderful Greek
941,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"treatment of this theme, in sculptured high relief. The sculptor has"
942,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"chosen the moment of parting. Hermes, the messenger of the gods to recall"
943,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Eurydice, has twined his hand gently around the left hand of the woman."
944,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"With her right hand she still touches her husband, but the dread instant"
945,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"is upon them all. The sculptor, representing the persons in three"
946,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"dimensions, as far as high relief allows, has sufficiently"
947,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"characterized their faces and figures, and with exquisite sense of rhythm"
948,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,and balance in his composition has fulfilled every requirement of formal
949,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,beauty that marble affords.
950,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
951,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,In Sir Frederick Leighton's painting of Orpheus and Eurydice and in many
952,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"another less famous painter's rendering of the theme, there is likewise"
953,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,the portrayal of an arrested moment. But the painter represents the
954,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,personages and the background in two dimensions. He can separate his
955,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"figures more completely than the sculptor, can make their instant of"
956,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"action more ""dramatic,"" can portray certain objects, such as the"
957,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"diaphanous robe of Eurydice as she vanishes into mist, which are beyond"
958,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the power of the sculptor to represent, and above all he can suggest the"
959,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"color of the objects themselves, the degree of light and shade, the"
960,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""atmosphere"" of the whole, in a fashion unapproachable by the rival arts."
961,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
962,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"The illustration need not be worked out more elaborately here, though the"
963,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,student may profitably reflect upon the resources of the modern moving
964,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"picture--which is a novel combination of the ""time"" and ""space"" arts--and"
965,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"of the mimetic dance, as affording still further opportunities for"
966,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,expressing the artistic possibilities of the Orpheus story. But the chief
967,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,lesson to be learned by one who is attempting in this way to survey the
968,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,provinces of the different arts is this: no two of all the artists who
969,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,have availed themselves of the Orpheus material have _really had the same
970,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"subject_, although the title of each of their productions, if catalogued,"
971,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"might conveniently be called ""Orpheus and Eurydice."" Each has had his own"
972,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"conception of the theme, each his own professional technique in handling"
973,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"his chosen medium, each his own habits of brain, each, in a word, has"
974,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"found his own subject. ""Are these children who are playing in the"
975,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sunlight,"" said Fromentin, ""or is it a place in the sunlight in"
976,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"which children are playing?"" One is a ""figure"" subject, that is to say,"
977,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,while the other is a landscape subject.
978,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
979,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"The whole topic of the ""provinces"" of the arts becomes hopelessly academic"
980,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"and sterile if one fails to keep his eye upon the individual artist, whose"
981,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,free choice of a subject is conditioned solely by his own artistic
982,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,interest in rendering such aspects of any theme as his own medium of
983,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,expression will allow him to represent. Take one of the most beautiful
984,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"objects in nature, a quiet sea. Is this a ""painter-like"" subject?"
985,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Assuredly, yet the etcher has often rendered the effect of a quiet sea in"
986,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"terms of line, as a pastellist has rendered it in terms of color, and a"
987,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"musician in terms of tone-feeling, and a poet in terms of tone-feeling"
988,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"plus thought. Each one of them finds something for himself, selects"
989,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"his own ""subject,"" from the material presented by the quiet sea, and"
990,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,whatever he may find belongs to him. We declaim against the confusion of
991,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the genres, the attempt to render in the terms of one art what belongs, as"
992,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"we had supposed, to another art, and we are often right in our protest."
993,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Yet artists have always been jumping each other's claims, and the sole"
994,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,test of the lawfulness of the procedure is the success of the result. If
995,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the border-foray of the impressionist or imagist proves successful, well"
996,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"and good, but a triumphant raid should not be mistaken for the steady"
997,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,lines of the main campaign.

1000,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,_2. The Special Field_
1001,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1002,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,What then do we mean by the province of poetry? Simply that there is a
1003,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"special field in which, for uncounted centuries, poets have produced a"
1004,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"certain kind of artistic effect. Strictly speaking, it is better to say"
1005,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""poets"" rather than ""the poet,"" just as William James confesses that"
1006,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"strictly speaking there is no such thing as ""the Imagination,"" there are"
1007,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"only imaginations. But ""the poet"" is a convenient expression to indicate a"
1008,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,man functioning _qua_ poet--i.e. a man poetizing; and we shall continue to
1009,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"use it. When we say that ""the poet"" in Sir Walter Scott inspires this or"
1010,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"that utterance, while ""the novelist"" or ""the historian"" or ""the critic"" in"
1011,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"him has prompted this or that other utterance, we are within our rights."
1012,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1013,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"The field of poetry, as commonly understood, is that portion of human"
1014,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,feeling which expresses itself through rhythmical and preferably metrical
1015,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"language. In this field ""the poet"" labors. The human feeling which he"
1016,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"embodies in verse comes to him originally, as feeling comes to all men, in"
1017,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"connection with a series of mental images. These visual, auditory, motor"
1018,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,or tactile images crowd the stream of consciousness as it sweeps inward to
1019,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the brain. There the images are subjected to a process of selection,"
1020,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"modification, transformation."
1021,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"[Footnote: ""The finest poetry was first experience; but the thought"
1022,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"has suffered a transformation since it was an experience."" Emerson,"
1023,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,_Shakespeare: The Poet_.]
1024,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"At some point in the process the poet's images tend to become verbal,--as"
1025,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the painter's or the musician's do not,--and these verbal images are then"
1026,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,discharged in rhythmical patterns. It is one type of the threefold process
1027,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,roughly described at the close of Chapter I. What is peculiar to the poet
1028,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,as compared with other men or other artists is to be traced not so much in
1029,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the peculiar nature of his visual, auditory, motor or tactile images--for"
1030,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,in this respect poets differ enormously among one another--as in the
1031,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,increasingly verbal form of these images as they are reshaped by his
1032,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"imagination, and in the strongly rhythmical or metrical character of the"
1033,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,final expression.
1034,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1035,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Let carbon represent the first of the stages, the excited feeling"
1036,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,resulting from sensory stimulus. That is the raw material of poetic
1037,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"emotion. Let the diamond represent the second stage, the chemical change,"
1038,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"as it were, produced in the mental images under the heat and pressure of"
1039,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the imagination. The final stage would be represented by the cutting,"
1040,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"polishing and setting of the diamond, by the arrangement of the"
1041,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,transformed and now purely verbal images into effective rhythmical or
1042,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,metrical designs.
1043,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1044,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Wordsworth once wrote of true poets who possessed
1045,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1046,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""The vision and the faculty divine,"
1047,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Though wanting the accomplishment of verse."""
1048,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1049,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Let us venture to apply Wordsworth's terminology to the process already
1050,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"described. The ""vision"" of the poet would mean his sense-impressions of"
1051,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"every kind, his experience, as Goethe said, of ""the outer world, the inner"
1052,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"world and the other world."" The ""faculty divine,"" into which vision blends"
1053,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"insensibly, would mean the mysterious change of these sense-impressions--"
1054,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"as they become subjected to reflection, comparison, memory, ""passion"
1055,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"recollected in tranquillity,""--into words possessing a peculiar life and"
1056,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"power. The ""accomplishment of verse"" is easier to understand. It is the"
1057,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"expression, by means of these words now pulsating with rhythm--the natural"
1058,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"language of excitement--of whatever the poet has seen and felt, modified"
1059,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"by his imagination. The result is a poem: ""embodied feeling."""
1060,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1061,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Browning says to his imaginary poet:
1062,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1063,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""Your brains beat into rhythm--you tell"
1064,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"What we felt only."""
1065,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1066,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"There is much virtue, for us, in this rudely vigorous description of ""the"
1067,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"poet."" Certainly all of us feel, and thus far we are all potential poets."
1068,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"But according to Browning there is, so to speak, a physiological"
1069,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,difference between the poet's brain and ours. His brain beats into rhythm;
1070,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"that is the simple but enormous difference in function, and hence it is"
1071,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"that he can tell what we only feel. That is, he becomes a ""singer"" as well"
1072,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"as ""maker,"" while we, conscious though we may be of the capacity for"
1073,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"intense feeling, cannot embody our feelings in the forms of verse. We may"
1074,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,indeed go so far as to reshape mental images in our heated brains--for all
1075,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"men do this under excitement, but to sing what we have thus made is denied"
1076,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,to us.

1079,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,_3. An Illustration from William James_
1080,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1081,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,No one can be more conscious than the present writer of the impossibility
1082,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of describing in plain prose the admittedly complicated and mysterious
1083,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,series of changes by which poetry comes into being. Those readers who find
1084,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,that even the lines just quoted from Wordsworth and Browning throw little
1085,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"new light upon the old difficulties, may nevertheless get a bit of help"
1086,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,here by turning back to William James's diagram of the working of the
1087,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,brain. It will be remembered that in Chapter I we used the simplest
1088,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,possible chart to represent the sensory stimulus of a nerve-centre and the
1089,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"succeeding motor reaction, and we compared the ""in-coming"" and ""out-going"""
1090,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,nerve processes with the function of Impression and Expression in the
1091,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,arts. But to understand something of what takes place in the making of
1092,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,poetry we must now substitute for our first diagram the slightly more
1093,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"complicated one which William James employs to represent, not those lower"
1094,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"nerve-centres which ""act from present sensational stimuli alone,"" but the"
1095,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"hemispheres of the human brain which ""act from considerations."""
1096,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"[Footnote: _Psychology, Briefer Course_, pp. 97, 98. Henry Holt.]"
1097,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Considerations are images constructed out of past experience, they are"
1098,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,reproductions of what has been felt or witnessed.
1099,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1100,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""They are, in short, _remote_ sensations; and the main difference"
1101,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,between the hemisphereless animal and the whole one may be concisely
1102,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"expressed by saying that _the one obeys absent, the other only present,"
1103,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,objects. The hemispheres would then seem to be the chief seat of
1104,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"memory._"""

1108,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""If we liken the nervous currents to electric currents, we can compare"
1109,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the nervous system, _C_, below the hemispheres to a direct circuit from"
1110,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sense-organ to muscle along the line _S... C... M_. The hemisphere, _H_,"
1111,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,adds the long circuit or loop-line through which the current may pass
1112,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,when for any reason the direct line is not used.

1117,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,beneath a maple-tree. The sensations of delicious rest and coolness
1118,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,pouring themselves through the direct line would naturally discharge
1119,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,into the muscles of complete extension: he would abandon himself to the
1120,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"dangerous repose. But the loop-line being open, part of the current is"
1121,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"drafted along it, and awakens rheumatic or catarrhal reminiscences,"
1122,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"which prevail over the instigations of sense, and make the man arise and"
1123,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"pursue his way to where he may enjoy his rest more safely."""
1124,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1125,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,William James's entire discussion of the value of the hemisphere
1126,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""loop-line"" as a reservoir of reminiscences is of peculiar suggestiveness"
1127,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"to the student of poetry. For it is along this loop-line of ""memories and"
1128,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"ideas of the distant"" that poetry wins its generalizing or universalizing"
1129,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,power. It is here that the life of reason enters into the life of mere
1130,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sensation, transforming the reports of the nerves into ideas and thoughts"
1131,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"that have coherence and general human significance. It is possible,"
1132,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"certainly, as the experiments of contemporary ""imagists"" prove, to write"
1133,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"poetry of a certain type without employing the ""loop-line."" But this is"
1134,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"pure sensorium verse, the report of retinal, auditory or tactile images,"
1135,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"and nothing more. ""Response to impressions and representation of those"
1136,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,impressions in their _original isolation_ are the marks of the new poetry.

1169,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"sensitive decapitated frog. It is ""hemisphereless"" poetry."
1170,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1171,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1172,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,_4. The Poet and Other Men_
1173,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1174,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,The mere physical vision of the poet may or may not be any keener than the
1175,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,vision of other men. There is an infinite variety in the bodily endowments
1176,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of habitual verse-makers: there have been near-sighted poets like
1177,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Tennyson, far-sighted poets like Wordsworth, and, in the well-known"
1178,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"case of Robert Browning, a poet conveniently far-sighted in one eye and"
1179,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,near-sighted in the other! No doubt the life-long practice of observing
1180,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"and recording natural phenomena sharpens the sense of poets, as it does"
1181,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the senses of Indians, naturalists, sailors and all outdoors men. The"
1182,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,quick eye for costume and character possessed by a Chaucer or a Shakspere
1183,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"is remarkable, but equally so is the observation of a Dickens or a Balzac."
1184,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,It is rather in what we call psychical vision that the poet is wont to
1185,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"excel, that is, in his ability to perceive the meaning of visual"
1186,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"phenomena. Here he ceases to be a mere reporter of retinal images, and"
1187,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,takes upon himself the higher and harder function of an interpreter of the
1188,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,visible world. He has no immunity from the universal human experiences: he
1189,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,loves and he is angry and he sees men born and die. He becomes according
1190,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,to the measure of his intellectual capacity a thinker. He strives to see
1191,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"into the human heart, to comprehend the working of the human mind. He"
1192,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,reads the divine justice in the tragic fall of Kings. He penetrates
1193,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"beneath the external forms of Nature and perceives her as a ""living"
1194,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"presence."" Yet the faculty of vision which the poet possesses in so"
1195,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,eminent a degree is shared by many who are not poets. Darwin's outward eye
1196,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,was as keen as Wordsworth's; St. Paul's sense of the reality of the
1197,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,invisible world is more wonderful than Shakspere's. The poet is indeed
1198,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"first of all a seer, but he must be something more than a seer before he"
1199,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,is wholly poet.
1200,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1201,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,Another mark of the poetic mind is its vivid sense of relations. The part
1202,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,suggests the whole. In the single instance there is a hint of the general
1203,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,law. The self-same Power that brings the fresh rhodora to the woods brings
1204,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"the poet there also. In the field-mouse, the daisy, the water-fowl, he"
1205,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,beholds types and symbols. His own experience stands for all men's. The
1206,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"conscience-stricken Macbeth is a poet when he cries, ""Life is a walking"
1207,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"shadow,"" and King Lear makes the same pathetic generalization when he"
1208,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"exclaims, ""What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?"" Through the"
1209,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,shifting phenomena of the present the poet feels the sweep of the
1210,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"universe; his mimic play and ""the great globe itself"" are alike an"
1211,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""insubstantial pageant,"" though it may happen, as Tennyson said of"
1212,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Wordsworth, that even in the transient he gives the sense of the"
1213,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"abiding, ""whose dwelling is the light of setting suns."""
1214,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1215,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"But this perception of relations, characteristic as it is of the poetic"
1216,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"temper, is also an attribute of the philosopher. The intellect of a"
1217,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Newton, too, leaps from the specific instance to the general law; every"
1218,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"man, in proportion to his intelligence and insight, feels that the world"
1219,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,is one; while Plato and Descartes play with the time and space world with
1220,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,all the grave sportiveness of Prospero.
1221,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1222,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Again, the poets have always been the ""genus irritabile""--the irritable"
1223,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"tribe. They not only see deeply, but feel acutely. Often they are too"
1224,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,highly sensitized for their own happiness. If they receive a pleasure more
1225,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"exquisite than ours from a flower, a glimpse of the sea, a gracious"
1226,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"action, they are correspondingly quick to feel dissonances, imperfections,"
1227,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"slights. Like Lamb, they are ""rather squeamish about their women and"
1228,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"children."" Like Keats, they are ""snuffed out by an article."" Keener"
1229,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"pleasures, keener pains, this is the law of their life; but it is"
1230,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,applicable to all persons of the so-called artistic temperament. It is one
1231,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,of the penalties of a fine organism. It does not of itself describe a
1232,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,poet.

1236,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,
1237,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"The real difference between ""the poet"" and other men is rather to be"
1238,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"traced, as the present chapter has tried to indicate, in his capacity for"
1239,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"making and employing verbal images of a certain kind, and combining these"
1240,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,images into rhythmical and metrical designs. In each of his functions--as
1241,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"""seer,"" as ""maker,"" and as ""singer""--he shows himself a true creator."
1242,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"Criticism no longer attempts to act as his ""law-giver,"" to assert what he"
1243,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"may or may not do. The poet is free, like every creative artist, to make a"
1244,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,beautiful object in any way he can. And nevertheless criticism--watching
1245,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"countless poets lovingly for many a century, observing their various"
1246,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"endowments, their manifest endeavors, their victories and defeats,"
1247,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"observing likewise the nature of language, that strange medium (so much"
1248,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,stranger than any clay or bronze!) through which poets are compelled to
1249,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"express their conceptions--criticism believes that poetry, like"
1250,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"each of the sister arts, has its natural province, its own field of the"
1251,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,beautiful. We have tried in this chapter to suggest the general direction
1252,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"of that field, without looking too narrowly for its precise boundaries. In"
1253,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,W. H. Hudson's _Green Mansions_ the reader will remember how a few sticks
1254,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"and stones, laid upon a hilltop, were used as markers to indicate the"
1255,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"outlines of a continent. Criticism, likewise, needs its poor sticks and"
1256,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"stones of commonplace, if it is to point out any roadway. Our own road"
1257,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,"leads first into the difficult territory of the poet's imaginings, and"
1258,THE PROVINCE OF POETRY,then into the more familiar world of the poet's words.

1278,WALT WHITMAN,"some moment or other, susceptible to poetic feeling. A small girl, the"
1279,WALT WHITMAN,"other day, spoke of a telegraph wire as ""that message-vine."" Her father"
1280,WALT WHITMAN,and mother smiled at this naive renaming of the world of fact. It was a
1281,WALT WHITMAN,"child's instinctive ""poetizing"" imagination, but the father and mother,"
1282,WALT WHITMAN,"while no longer capable, perhaps, of such daring verbal magic, were"
1283,WALT WHITMAN,"conscious that they had too often played with the world of fact, and, for"
1284,WALT WHITMAN,"the instant at least, remoulded it into something nearer the heart's"
1285,WALT WHITMAN,"desire. That is to say, they could still feel ""poetically,"" though their"
1286,WALT WHITMAN,wonderful chance of making up new names for everything had gone as soon as
1287,WALT WHITMAN,the gates were shut upon the Paradise of childhood.
1288,WALT WHITMAN,
1289,WALT WHITMAN,"All readers of poetry agree that it originates somehow in feeling, and"
1290,WALT WHITMAN,"that if it be true poetry, it stimulates feeling in the hearer. And all"
1291,WALT WHITMAN,readers agree likewise that feeling is transmitted from the maker of
1292,WALT WHITMAN,poetry to the enjoyer of poetry by means of the imagination. But the
1293,WALT WHITMAN,"moment we pass beyond these accepted truisms, difficulties begin."
1294,WALT WHITMAN,
1295,WALT WHITMAN,
1296,WALT WHITMAN,_1. Feeling and Imagination_
1297,WALT WHITMAN,
1298,WALT WHITMAN,"What is feeling, and exactly how is it bound up with the imagination? The"
1299,WALT WHITMAN,"psychology of feeling remains obscure, even after the labors of"
1300,WALT WHITMAN,generations of specialists; and it is obvious that the general theories
1301,WALT WHITMAN,"about the nature of imagination have shifted greatly, even within the"
1302,WALT WHITMAN,"memory of living men. Nevertheless there are some facts, in this"
1303,WALT WHITMAN,"constantly contested territory, which now seem indisputable. One of them,"
1304,WALT WHITMAN,"and of peculiar significance to students of poetry, is this: in the stream"
1305,WALT WHITMAN,of objects immediately present to consciousness there are no images of
1306,WALT WHITMAN,feeling itself.
1307,WALT WHITMAN,[Footnote: This point has been elaborated with great care in Professor A.
1308,WALT WHITMAN,"H. R. Fairchild's _Making of Poetry_. Putnam's, 1912.]"
1309,WALT WHITMAN,
1310,WALT WHITMAN,"""If I am asked to call up an image of a rose, of a tree, of a cloud, or of"
1311,WALT WHITMAN,"a skylark, I can readily do it; but if I am asked to feel loneliness or"
1312,WALT WHITMAN,"sorrow, to feel hatred or jealousy, or to feel joy on the return of"
1313,WALT WHITMAN,"spring, I cannot readily do it. And the reason why I cannot do it is"
1314,WALT WHITMAN,because I can call up no image of any one of these feelings. For
1315,WALT WHITMAN,"everything I come to know through my senses, for everything in connection"
1316,WALT WHITMAN,with what I do or feel I can call up some kind of mental image; but for no
1317,WALT WHITMAN,kind of feeling itself can I ever possibly have a direct image. The only
1318,WALT WHITMAN,effective way of arousing any particular feeling that is more than mere
1319,WALT WHITMAN,bodily feeling is to call up the images that are naturally connected with
1320,WALT WHITMAN,"that feeling."""
1321,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: Fairchild, pp. 24, 25.]"
1322,WALT WHITMAN,
1323,WALT WHITMAN,"If then, ""the raw material of poetry,"" as Professor Fairchild insists,"
1324,WALT WHITMAN,"is ""the mental image,"" we must try to see how these images are presented"
1325,WALT WHITMAN,to the mind of the poet and in turn communicated to us. Instead of
1326,WALT WHITMAN,"asserting, as our grandfathers did, that the imagination is a ""faculty"""
1327,WALT WHITMAN,"of the mind, like ""judgment,"" or accepting the theory of our fathers that"
1328,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination ""is the whole mind thrown into the process of imagining,"" the"
1329,WALT WHITMAN,"present generation has been taught by psychologists like Charcot, James"
1330,WALT WHITMAN,"and Ribot that we are chiefly concerned with ""imaginations,"" that is, a"
1331,WALT WHITMAN,"series of visual, auditory, motor or tactile images flooding in upon the"
1332,WALT WHITMAN,"mind, and that it is safer to talk about these ""imaginations"" than about"
1333,WALT WHITMAN,"""the Imagination."" Literary critics will continue to use this last"
1334,WALT WHITMAN,expression--as we are doing in the present chapter--because it is too
1335,WALT WHITMAN,convenient to be given up. But they mean by it something fairly definite:
1336,WALT WHITMAN,"namely, the images swarming in the stream of consciousness, and their"
1337,WALT WHITMAN,integration into wholes that satisfy the human desire for beauty. It is
1338,WALT WHITMAN,in its ultimate aim rather than in its immediate processes that the
1339,WALT WHITMAN,"""artistic"" imagination differs from the inventor's or scientist's or"
1340,WALT WHITMAN,"philosopher's imagination. We no longer assert, as did Stopford Brooke"
1341,WALT WHITMAN,"some forty years ago, that ""the highest scientific intellect is a joke"
1342,WALT WHITMAN,"compared with the power displayed by a Shakespeare, a Homer, a Dante."" We"
1343,WALT WHITMAN,are inclined rather to believe that in its highest exercise of power the
1344,WALT WHITMAN,scientific mind is attempting much the same feat as the highest type of
1345,WALT WHITMAN,"poetic mind, and that in both cases it is a feat of imaginative energy."

1348,WALT WHITMAN,_2. Creative and Artistic Imagination_
1349,WALT WHITMAN,
1350,WALT WHITMAN,The reader who has hitherto allowed himself to think of a poet as a sort
1351,WALT WHITMAN,"of freak of nature, abnormal in the very constitution of his mind, and"
1352,WALT WHITMAN,"achieving his results by methods so obscure that ""inspiration"" is our"
1353,WALT WHITMAN,"helpless name for indicating them, cannot do better than master such a"
1354,WALT WHITMAN,book as Ribot's _Essay on the Creative Imagination_.
1355,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: Th. Ribot, _Essai sur l'Imagination créatrice_. Paris, 1900."
1356,WALT WHITMAN,"English translation by Open Court Co., Chicago, 1906.]"
1357,WALT WHITMAN,"This famous psychologist, starting with the conception that the raw"
1358,WALT WHITMAN,"material for the creative imagination is images, and that its basis lies"
1359,WALT WHITMAN,"in a motor impulse, examines first the emotional factor involved in every"
1360,WALT WHITMAN,"act of the creative imagination. Then he passes to the unconscious factor,"
1361,WALT WHITMAN,"the involuntary ""coming"" of the idea, that ""moment of genius,"" as Buffon"
1362,WALT WHITMAN,"called it, which often marks the end of an unconscious elaboration of the"
1363,WALT WHITMAN,idea or the beginning of conscious elaboration.
1364,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: See the quotation from Sir William Rowan Hamilton, the"
1365,WALT WHITMAN,"mathematician, in the ""Notes and Illustrations"" for this chapter.]"
1366,WALT WHITMAN,"Ribot points out that certain organic changes, as in blood circulation--"
1367,WALT WHITMAN,the familiar rush of blood to the head--accompany imaginative activity.
1368,WALT WHITMAN,"Then he discusses the inventor's and artist's ""fixed idea,"" their ""will"
1369,WALT WHITMAN,"that it shall be so,"" ""the motor tendency of images engendering the"
1370,WALT WHITMAN,"ideal."" Ribot's distinction between the animal's revival of images and the"
1371,WALT WHITMAN,true creative combination of images in the mental life of children and of
1372,WALT WHITMAN,"primitive man bears directly upon poetry, but even more suggestive to us"
1373,WALT WHITMAN,is his diagram of the successive stages by which inventions come into
1374,WALT WHITMAN,"being. There are two types of this process, and three stages of each: (A)"
1375,WALT WHITMAN,"the ""idea,"" the ""discovery"" or invention, and then the verification or"
1376,WALT WHITMAN,"application; or else (B) the unconscious preparation, followed"
1377,WALT WHITMAN,"by the ""idea"" or ""inspiration,"" and then by the ""development"" or"
1378,WALT WHITMAN,"construction. Whether a man is inventing a safety-pin or a sonnet, the"
1379,WALT WHITMAN,series of imaginative processes seems to be much the same. There is of
1380,WALT WHITMAN,"course a typical difference between the ""plastic"" imagination, dealing"
1381,WALT WHITMAN,"with clear images, objective relations, and seen at its best in the arts"
1382,WALT WHITMAN,"of form like sculpture and architecture, and that ""diffluent"" imagination"
1383,WALT WHITMAN,"which prefers vaguely outlined images, which is markedly subjective and"
1384,WALT WHITMAN,"emotional, and of which modern music like Debussy's is a good example. But"
1385,WALT WHITMAN,"whatever may be the specific type of imagination involved, we find alike"
1386,WALT WHITMAN,"in inventor, scientist and artist the same general sequence of ""germ,"
1387,WALT WHITMAN,"incubation, flowering and completion,"" and the same fundamental motor"
1388,WALT WHITMAN,impulse as the driving power.
1389,WALT WHITMAN,
1390,WALT WHITMAN,"Holding in mind these general characteristics of the creative imagination,"
1391,WALT WHITMAN,"as traced by Ribot, let us now test our conception of the distinctively"
1392,WALT WHITMAN,"artistic imagination. Countless are the attempts to define or describe it,"
1393,WALT WHITMAN,"and it would be unwise for the student, at this point, to rest satisfied"
1394,WALT WHITMAN,with any single formulation of its functions. But it may be helpful to
1395,WALT WHITMAN,"quote a paragraph from Hartley B. Alexander's brilliant and subtle book,"
1396,WALT WHITMAN,_Poetry and the Individual_:
1397,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: Putnam's, 1906.]"
1398,WALT WHITMAN,
1399,WALT WHITMAN,"""The energy of the mind or of the soul--for it welds all psychical"
1400,WALT WHITMAN,activities--which is the agent of our world-winnings and the
1401,WALT WHITMAN,"procreator of our growing life, we term imagination. It is"
1402,WALT WHITMAN,distinguished from perception by its relative freedom from the
1403,WALT WHITMAN,dictation of sense; it is distinguished from memory by its power to
1404,WALT WHITMAN,acquire--memory only retains; it is distinguished from emotion in
1405,WALT WHITMAN,being a force rather than a motive; from the understanding in being
1406,WALT WHITMAN,an assimilator rather than the mere weigher of what is set before it;
1407,WALT WHITMAN,"from the will, because the will is but the wielder of the reins--the"
1408,WALT WHITMAN,"will is but the charioteer, the imagination is the Pharaoh in"
1409,WALT WHITMAN,"command. It is distinguished from all these, yet it includes them"
1410,WALT WHITMAN,"all, for it is the full functioning of the whole mind and in the"
1411,WALT WHITMAN,total activity drives all mental faculties to its one supreme
1412,WALT WHITMAN,end--the widening of the world wherein we dwell. Through beauty the
1413,WALT WHITMAN,"world grows, and it is the business of the imagination to create the"
1414,WALT WHITMAN,"beautiful. The imagination synthesises, humanises, personalises,"
1415,WALT WHITMAN,"illumines reality with the soul's most intimate moods, and so exalts"
1416,WALT WHITMAN,"with spiritual understandings."""
1417,WALT WHITMAN,
1418,WALT WHITMAN,"The value of such a description, presented without any context, will vary"
1419,WALT WHITMAN,"with the training of the individual reader, but its quickening power will"
1420,WALT WHITMAN,be recognized even by those who are incapable of grasping all the
1421,WALT WHITMAN,intellectual distinctions involved.
1422,WALT WHITMAN,
1423,WALT WHITMAN,
1424,WALT WHITMAN,_3. Poetic Imagination in Particular_
1425,WALT WHITMAN,
1426,WALT WHITMAN,"We are now ready, after this consideration of the creative and artistic"
1427,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination, to look more closely at some of the qualities of the poetic"
1428,WALT WHITMAN,imagination in particular. The specific formal features of that
1429,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination lie, as we have seen, in its use of verbal imagery, and in the"
1430,WALT WHITMAN,combination of verbal images into rhythmical patterns. But are there not
1431,WALT WHITMAN,functions of the poet's mind preceding the formation of verbal images? The
1432,WALT WHITMAN,"psychology of language is still unsettled, and whether a man can think"
1433,WALT WHITMAN,without the use of words is often doubted. But a painter can certainly
1434,WALT WHITMAN,"""think"" in terms of color, as an architect or mathematician can ""think"" in"
1435,WALT WHITMAN,"terms of form and space, or a musician in terms of sound, without"
1436,WALT WHITMAN,employing verbal symbols at all. And are there not characteristic
1437,WALT WHITMAN,activities of the poetic imagination which antedate the fixation and
1438,WALT WHITMAN,expression of images in words? Apparently there are.
1439,WALT WHITMAN,
1440,WALT WHITMAN,"The reader will find, in the ""Notes and Illustrations"" for this chapter, a"
1441,WALT WHITMAN,"quotation from Mr. Lascelles-Abercrombie, in which he refers to the"
1442,WALT WHITMAN,"""region where the outward radiations of man's nature combine with the"
1443,WALT WHITMAN,"irradiations of the world."" That is to say, the inward-sweeping stream of"
1444,WALT WHITMAN,consciousness is instantly met by an outward-moving activity of the brain
1445,WALT WHITMAN,which recognizes relationships between the objects proffered to the senses
1446,WALT WHITMAN,"and the personality itself. The ""I"" projects itself into these objects,"
1447,WALT WHITMAN,"claims them, appropriates them as a part of its own nature. Professor"
1448,WALT WHITMAN,"Fairchild, who calls this self-projecting process by the somewhat"
1449,WALT WHITMAN,"ambiguous name of ""personalizing,"" rightly insists, I believe, that poets"
1450,WALT WHITMAN,make a more distinctive use of this activity than other men. He quotes
1451,WALT WHITMAN,"some of the classic confidences of poets themselves: Keats's ""If a sparrow"
1452,WALT WHITMAN,come before my window I take part in its existence and pick about the
1453,WALT WHITMAN,"gravel""; and Goethe on the sheep pictured by the artist Roos, ""I always"
1454,WALT WHITMAN,"feel uneasy when I look at these beasts. Their state, so limited, dull,"
1455,WALT WHITMAN,"gaping, and dreaming, excites in me such sympathy that I fear I shall"
1456,WALT WHITMAN,"become a sheep, and almost think the artist must have been one."" I can"
1457,WALT WHITMAN,"match this Goethe story with the prayer of little Larry H., son of an"
1458,WALT WHITMAN,"eminent Harvard biologist. Larry, at the age of six, was taken by his"
1459,WALT WHITMAN,"mother to the top of a Vermont hill-pasture, where, for the first time in"
1460,WALT WHITMAN,"his life, he saw a herd of cows and was thrilled by their glorious bigness"
1461,WALT WHITMAN,"and nearness and novelty. When he said his prayers that night, he was"
1462,WALT WHITMAN,enough of a poet to change his usual formula into this:
1463,WALT WHITMAN,
1464,WALT WHITMAN,"""Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,"
1465,WALT WHITMAN,"Bless thy little _cow_ to-night""--"
1466,WALT WHITMAN,
1467,WALT WHITMAN,_Larry being the cow._
1468,WALT WHITMAN,
1469,WALT WHITMAN,"""There was a child went forth every day,"""
1470,WALT WHITMAN,
1471,WALT WHITMAN,"records Walt Whitman,"
1472,WALT WHITMAN,
1473,WALT WHITMAN,"""And the first object he look'd upon that object"
1474,WALT WHITMAN,"he became."""
1475,WALT WHITMAN,
1476,WALT WHITMAN,"Professor Fairchild quotes these lines from Whitman, and a few of the many"
1477,WALT WHITMAN,passages of the same purport from Coleridge and Wordsworth. They are all
1478,WALT WHITMAN,summed up in Coleridge's heart-broken
1479,WALT WHITMAN,
1480,WALT WHITMAN,"""Oh, Lady, we receive but what we give,"
1481,WALT WHITMAN,"And in our life alone does Nature live."""
1482,WALT WHITMAN,
1483,WALT WHITMAN,"This ""animism,"" or identifying imagination, by means of which the child or"
1484,WALT WHITMAN,the primitive man or the poet transfers his own life into the unorganic or
1485,WALT WHITMAN,"organic world, is one of the oldest and surest indications of poetic"
1486,WALT WHITMAN,"faculty, and as far as we can see, it is antecedent to the use of verbal"
1487,WALT WHITMAN,images or symbols.
1488,WALT WHITMAN,
1489,WALT WHITMAN,"Another characteristic of the poetic temperament, allied with the"
1490,WALT WHITMAN,"preceding, likewise seems to belong in the region where words are not as"
1491,WALT WHITMAN,yet emerging above the threshold of consciousness. I mean the strange
1492,WALT WHITMAN,"feeling, witnessed to by many poets, of the fluidity, fusibility,"
1493,WALT WHITMAN,transparency--the infinitely changing and interchangeable aspects--of the
1494,WALT WHITMAN,world as it appears to the senses. It is evident that poets are not
1495,WALT WHITMAN,"looking--at least when in this mood--at our ""logical"" world of hard, clear"
1496,WALT WHITMAN,"fact and law. They are gazing rather at what Whitman called ""the eternal"
1497,WALT WHITMAN,"float of solution,"" the ""flowing of all things"" of the Greeks, the"
1498,WALT WHITMAN,"""river within the river"" of Emerson. This tendency is peculiarly marked,"
1499,WALT WHITMAN,"of course, in artists possessing the ""diffluent"" type of imagination, and"
1500,WALT WHITMAN,"Romantic poets and critics have had much to say about it. The imagination,"
1501,WALT WHITMAN,"said Wordsworth, ""recoils from everything but the plastic, the pliant, the"
1502,WALT WHITMAN,"indefinite."""
1503,WALT WHITMAN,[Footnote: Preface to 1815 edition of his _Poems_.]
1504,WALT WHITMAN,"""Shakespeare, too,"" says Carlye,"
1505,WALT WHITMAN,[Footnote: Essay on Goethe's Works.]
1506,WALT WHITMAN,"""does not look _at_ a thing, but into it, through it; so that he"
1507,WALT WHITMAN,"constructively comprehends it, can take it asunder and put it together"
1508,WALT WHITMAN,"again; _the thing melts as it were, into light under his eye, and anew"
1509,WALT WHITMAN,"creates itself before him_. That is to say, he is a Poet. For Goethe, as"
1510,WALT WHITMAN,"for Shakespeare, _the world lies all translucent, all fusible_ we might"
1511,WALT WHITMAN,"call it, encircled with _Wonder_; the Natural in reality the Supernatural,"
1512,WALT WHITMAN,"for to the seer's eyes both become one."""
1513,WALT WHITMAN,
1514,WALT WHITMAN,In his essay on Tieck Carlyle remarks again upon this characteristic of
1515,WALT WHITMAN,"the mind of the typical poet: ""He is no mere observer and compiler;"
1516,WALT WHITMAN,"rendering back to us, with additions or subtractions, the Beauty which"
1517,WALT WHITMAN,"existing things have of themselves presented to him; but a true Maker, to"
1518,WALT WHITMAN,whom the actual and external is but the excitement for ideal creations
1519,WALT WHITMAN,"representing and ennobling its effects."""
1520,WALT WHITMAN,
1521,WALT WHITMAN,"Coleridge's formula is briefer still; the imagination ""dissolves,"
1522,WALT WHITMAN,"diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create."""
1523,WALT WHITMAN,[Footnote: _Biographia Literaria_.]
1524,WALT WHITMAN,
1525,WALT WHITMAN,Such passages help us to understand the mystical moments which many poets
1526,WALT WHITMAN,"have recorded, in which their feeling of ""diffusion"" has led them to doubt"
1527,WALT WHITMAN,"the existence of the external world. Wordsworth grasping ""at a wall or"
1528,WALT WHITMAN,"tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality,"" and"
1529,WALT WHITMAN,"Tennyson's ""weird seizures"" which he transferred from his own experience"
1530,WALT WHITMAN,"to his imaginary Prince in _The Princess_, are familiar examples of this"
1531,WALT WHITMAN,type of mysticism. But the sense of the infinite fusibility and change in
1532,WALT WHITMAN,the objective world is deeper than that revealed in any one type of
1533,WALT WHITMAN,diffluent imagination. It is a profound characteristic of the poetic
1534,WALT WHITMAN,mind as such. Yet it should be remembered that the philosopher and
1535,WALT WHITMAN,"the scientist likewise assert that ours is a vital, ever-flowing,"
1536,WALT WHITMAN,"onward-urging world, in the process of ""becoming"" rather than merely"
1537,WALT WHITMAN,"""being."" ""We are far from the noon of man"" sang Tennyson, in a"
1538,WALT WHITMAN,"late-Victorian and evolutionary version of St. John's ""It doth not"
1539,WALT WHITMAN,"yet appear what we shall be."" ""The primary imagination,"" asserted"
1540,WALT WHITMAN,"Coleridge, ""is a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of"
1541,WALT WHITMAN,"creation in the infinite _I am_."""
1542,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: _Biographia Literaria_, chap. 13.]"
1543,WALT WHITMAN,"Here, evidently, unless the ""God-intoxicated"" Coleridge is talking"
1544,WALT WHITMAN,"nonsense, we are in the presence of powers that do not need as yet any use"
1545,WALT WHITMAN,of verbal symbols.
1546,WALT WHITMAN,
1547,WALT WHITMAN,
1548,WALT WHITMAN,_4. Verbal Images_
1549,WALT WHITMAN,
1550,WALT WHITMAN,The plasticity of the world as it appears to the mind of the poet is
1551,WALT WHITMAN,clearly evidenced by the swarm of images which present themselves to the
1552,WALT WHITMAN,poet's consciousness. In the re-presentation of these pictures to us the
1553,WALT WHITMAN,"poet is forced, of course, to use verbal images. The precise point at"
1554,WALT WHITMAN,which he becomes conscious of employing words no doubt varies with the
1555,WALT WHITMAN,"individual, and depends upon the relative balance of auditory, visual or"
1556,WALT WHITMAN,tactile images in his mind. Swinburne often impresses us as working
1557,WALT WHITMAN,"primarily with the ""stuff"" of word-sounds, as Browning with the stuff of"
1558,WALT WHITMAN,"sharp-cut tactile or motor images, and Victor Hugo with the stuff of"
1559,WALT WHITMAN,visual impressions. But in each case the poet's sole medium of _expression
1560,WALT WHITMAN,"to us_ is through verbal symbols, and it is hard to get behind these into"
1561,WALT WHITMAN,the real workshop of the brain where each poet is busily minting his own
1562,WALT WHITMAN,peculiar raw material into the current coin of human speech.
1563,WALT WHITMAN,
1564,WALT WHITMAN,"Nevertheless, many poets have been sufficiently conscious of what is going"
1565,WALT WHITMAN,on within their workshop to tell us something about it. Professor
1566,WALT WHITMAN,Fairchild has made an interesting collection
1567,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: _The Making of Poetry_, pp. 78, 79.]"
1568,WALT WHITMAN,"of testimony relating to the tumultuous crowding of images, each"
1569,WALT WHITMAN,"clamoring, as it were, for recognition and crying ""take me!"" He instances,"
1570,WALT WHITMAN,"as other critics have done, the extraordinary succession of images by"
1571,WALT WHITMAN,which Shelley strives to portray the spirit of the skylark. The similes
1572,WALT WHITMAN,actually chosen by Shelley seem to have been merely the lucky candidates
1573,WALT WHITMAN,selected from an infinitely greater number. In Francis Thompson's
1574,WALT WHITMAN,captivating description of Shelley as a glorious child the reader is
1575,WALT WHITMAN,"conscious of the same initial rush of images, although the medium of"
1576,WALT WHITMAN,expression here is heightened prose instead of verse:
1577,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: _Dublin Review_, July, 1908.]"
1578,WALT WHITMAN,
1579,WALT WHITMAN,"""Coming to Shelley's poetry, we peep over the wild mask of"
1580,WALT WHITMAN,"revolutionary metaphysics, and we see the winsome face of the child."
1581,WALT WHITMAN,Perhaps none of his poems is more purely and typically Shelleian than
1582,WALT WHITMAN,"The Cloud, and it is interesting to note how essentially it springs"
1583,WALT WHITMAN,"from the faculty of make-believe. The same thing is conspicuous,"
1584,WALT WHITMAN,"though less purely conspicuous, throughout his singing; it is the"
1585,WALT WHITMAN,child's faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power. He is still
1586,WALT WHITMAN,"at play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch,"
1587,WALT WHITMAN,and his playthings are those which the gods give their children. The
1588,WALT WHITMAN,universe is his box of toys. He dabbles his fingers in the day-fall.
1589,WALT WHITMAN,He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars. He makes bright

1600,WALT WHITMAN,_5. The Selection and Control of Images_
1601,WALT WHITMAN,
1602,WALT WHITMAN,"It is easier, no doubt, to realize something of the swarming of images in"
1603,WALT WHITMAN,the stream of consciousness than it is to understand how these images are
1604,WALT WHITMAN,"selected, combined and controlled. Some principle of association, some law"
1605,WALT WHITMAN,"governing the synthesis, there must be; and English criticism has long"
1606,WALT WHITMAN,treasured some of the clairvoyant words of Coleridge and Wordsworth upon
1607,WALT WHITMAN,this matter. The essential problem is suggested by Wordsworth's phrase
1608,WALT WHITMAN,"""the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement."" Is the"
1609,WALT WHITMAN,"""excitement,"" then, the chief factor in the selection and combination of"
1610,WALT WHITMAN,"images, and do the ""feelings,"" as if with delicate tentacles,"
1611,WALT WHITMAN,instinctively choose and reject and integrate such images as blend with
1612,WALT WHITMAN,the poet's mood?
1613,WALT WHITMAN,
1614,WALT WHITMAN,"Coleridge, with his subtle builder's instinct, uses his favorite word"
1615,WALT WHITMAN,"""synthesis"" not merely as applied to images as such, but to all the"
1616,WALT WHITMAN,faculties of the soul:
1617,WALT WHITMAN,
1618,WALT WHITMAN,"""The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of man"
1619,WALT WHITMAN,"into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other"
1620,WALT WHITMAN,according to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses a tone and a
1621,WALT WHITMAN,"spirit of unity, that blends, and as it were fuses, each into each, by"
1622,WALT WHITMAN,that synthetic and magical power to which I would exclusively appropriate
1623,WALT WHITMAN,"the name of Imagination."" ""Synthetic and magical power,"" indeed, with a"
1624,WALT WHITMAN,Coleridge as Master of the Mysteries! But the perplexed student of poetry
1625,WALT WHITMAN,may well wish a more exact description of what really takes place.
1626,WALT WHITMAN,
1627,WALT WHITMAN,"An American critic, after much searching in recent psychological"
1628,WALT WHITMAN,"explanations of artistic creation, attempts to describe the genesis of a"
1629,WALT WHITMAN,poem in these words:
1630,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: Lewis E. Gates, _Studies and Appreciations_, p. 215. Macmillan,"

1632,WALT WHITMAN,
1633,WALT WHITMAN,"""The poet concentrates his thought on some concrete piece of life, on"
1634,WALT WHITMAN,"some incident, character, or bit of personal experience; because of"
1635,WALT WHITMAN,"his emotional temperament, this concentration of interest stirs in"
1636,WALT WHITMAN,him a quick play of feeling and prompts the swift concurrence of many
1637,WALT WHITMAN,"images. Under the incitement of these feelings, and in accordance"
1638,WALT WHITMAN,"with laws of association that may at least in part be described,"
1639,WALT WHITMAN,"these images grow bright and clear, take definite shapes, fall into"
1640,WALT WHITMAN,"significant groupings, branch and ramify, and break into sparkling"
1641,WALT WHITMAN,mimicry of the actual world of the senses--all the time delicately
1642,WALT WHITMAN,controlled by the poet's conscious purpose and so growing
1643,WALT WHITMAN,"intellectually significant, but all the time, if the work of art is"
1644,WALT WHITMAN,"to be vital, impelled also in their alert weaving of patterns by the"
1645,WALT WHITMAN,"moods of the poet, by his fine instinctive sense of the emotional"
1646,WALT WHITMAN,expressiveness of this or that image that lurks in the background of
1647,WALT WHITMAN,"his consciousness. For this intricate web of images, tinged with his"
1648,WALT WHITMAN,"most intimate moods, the poet through his intuitive command of words"
1649,WALT WHITMAN,finds an apt series of sound-symbols and records them with written
1650,WALT WHITMAN,characters. And so a poem arises through an exquisite distillation of
1651,WALT WHITMAN,"personal moods into imagery and into language, and is ready to offer"
1652,WALT WHITMAN,to all future generations its undiminishing store of spiritual joy
1653,WALT WHITMAN,"and strength."""
1654,WALT WHITMAN,
1655,WALT WHITMAN,"A better description than this we are not likely to find, although some"
1656,WALT WHITMAN,"critics would question the phrase, ""all the time delicately controlled by"
1657,WALT WHITMAN,"the poet's conscious purpose."""
1658,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: ""Poetry is not like reasoning, a power to be exerted according"
1659,WALT WHITMAN,"to the determination of the will. A man cannot say, 'I will compose"

1661,WALT WHITMAN,mind. ... Its birth and recurrence have no necessary connection with the
1662,WALT WHITMAN,"consciousness or will."" Shelley, _A Defense of Poetry_.]"
1663,WALT WHITMAN,
1664,WALT WHITMAN,"For sometimes, assuredly, the synthesis of images seems to take place"
1665,WALT WHITMAN,"without the volition of the poet. The hypnotic trance, the narcotic dream"
1666,WALT WHITMAN,"or revery, and even our experience of ordinary dreams, provide abundant"
1667,WALT WHITMAN,"examples. One dreams, for instance, of a tidal river, flowing in with a"
1668,WALT WHITMAN,gentle full current which bends in one direction all the water-weeds and
1669,WALT WHITMAN,the long grasses trailing from the banks; then somehow the tide seems to
1670,WALT WHITMAN,"change, and all the water and the weeds and grasses, even the fishes in"
1671,WALT WHITMAN,"the stream, turn slowly and flow out to sea. The current synthesizes,"
1672,WALT WHITMAN,"harmonizes, moves onward like music,--and we are aware that it is all a"
1673,WALT WHITMAN,"dream. Coleridge's ""Kubla Khan,"" composed in a deep opium slumber, moves"
1674,WALT WHITMAN,"like that, one train of images melting into another like the interwoven"
1675,WALT WHITMAN,"figures of a dance led by the ""damsel with a dulcimer."" There is no"
1676,WALT WHITMAN,"""conscious purpose"" whatever, and no ""meaning"" in the ordinary"
1677,WALT WHITMAN,interpretation of that word. Nevertheless it is perfect integration of
1678,WALT WHITMAN,"imagery, pure beauty to the senses. Something of this rapture in the sheer"
1679,WALT WHITMAN,release of control must have been in Charles Lamb's mind when he wrote to
1680,WALT WHITMAN,"Coleridge about the ""pure happiness""  of being insane. ""Dream not,"

1732,WALT WHITMAN,"Wordsworth's analysis of the processes of his own imagination, like Poe's"

1735,WALT WHITMAN,correctness in every detail. It is evident that we have to deal with an
1736,WALT WHITMAN,infinite variety of normal and abnormal minds. Some of these defy
1737,WALT WHITMAN,"classification; others fall into easily recognized types, such as ""the"

1762,WALT WHITMAN,"ourselves back to the recorded experience of individual men, and from"
1763,WALT WHITMAN,these make our comparisons and generalizations. It may even happen that
1764,WALT WHITMAN,some readers will get a clearer conception of the selection and synthesis
1765,WALT WHITMAN,of images if they turn for the moment away from poetry and endeavor to
1766,WALT WHITMAN,realize something of the same processes as they take place in imaginative
1767,WALT WHITMAN,"prose. In Hawthorne's _Scarlet Letter_, for example, the dominant image,"
1768,WALT WHITMAN,"which becomes the symbol of his entire theme, is the piece of scarlet"
1769,WALT WHITMAN,cloth which originally caught his attention. This physical object
1770,WALT WHITMAN,"becomes, after long brooding, subtly changed into a moral symbol of sin"
1771,WALT WHITMAN,"and its concealment. It permeates the book, it is borne openly upon the"
1772,WALT WHITMAN,"breast of one sufferer, it is written terribly in the flesh of another, it"
1773,WALT WHITMAN,flames at last in the very sky. All the lesser images and symbols of the
1774,WALT WHITMAN,"romance are mastered by it, subordinated to it; it becomes the dominant"
1775,WALT WHITMAN,"note in the composition. The romance of _The Scarlet Letter_ is, as we say"
1776,WALT WHITMAN,"of any great poem or drama, an ""ideal synthesis""; i.e. a putting together"
1777,WALT WHITMAN,of images in accordance with some central idea. The more significant the
1778,WALT WHITMAN,"idea or theme or master image, the richer and fuller are the possibilities"
1779,WALT WHITMAN,of beauty in detail. Apply this familiar law of complexity to a poet's
1780,WALT WHITMAN,conscious or unconscious choice of images. In the essay which we have
1781,WALT WHITMAN,already quoted
1782,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: _Studies and Appreciations_, p. 216.]"
1783,WALT WHITMAN,Lewis Gates remarks:
1784,WALT WHITMAN,
1785,WALT WHITMAN,"""In every artist there is a definite mental bias, a definite spiritual"
1786,WALT WHITMAN,"organization and play of instincts, which results in large measure from"
1787,WALT WHITMAN,"the common life of his day and generation, and which represents this"
1788,WALT WHITMAN,life--makes it potent--within the individuality of the artist. This
1789,WALT WHITMAN,so-called 'acquired constitution of the life of the soul'--it has been
1790,WALT WHITMAN,described by Professor Dilthey with noteworthy acuteness and
1791,WALT WHITMAN,thoroughness--determines in some measure the contents of the artist's
1792,WALT WHITMAN,"mind, for it determines his interests, and therefore the sensations and"
1793,WALT WHITMAN,perceptions that he captures and automatically stores up. It guides him in
1794,WALT WHITMAN,"his judgments of worth, in his instinctive likes and dislikes as regards"
1795,WALT WHITMAN,"conduct and character, and controls in large measure the play of his"
1796,WALT WHITMAN,imagination as he shapes the action of his drama or epic and the destinies
1797,WALT WHITMAN,of his heroes. Its prejudices interfiltrate throughout the molecules of
1798,WALT WHITMAN,"his entire moral and mental life, and give to each image and idea some"
1799,WALT WHITMAN,"slight shade of attractiveness or repulsiveness, so that when the artist's"
1800,WALT WHITMAN,"spirit is at work under the stress of feeling, weaving into the fabric of"
1801,WALT WHITMAN,"a poem the competing images and ideas in his consciousness, certain ideas"
1802,WALT WHITMAN,"and images come more readily and others lag behind, and the resulting work"
1803,WALT WHITMAN,of art gets a colour and an emotional tone and suggestions of value that
1804,WALT WHITMAN,"subtly reflect the genius of the age."""

1808,WALT WHITMAN,
1809,WALT WHITMAN,Such a conception of the association of images as reflecting not only this
1810,WALT WHITMAN,"""acquired constitution of the soul"" of the poet but also the genius of the"
1811,WALT WHITMAN,age is in marked contrast to some of the theories held by contemporary
1812,WALT WHITMAN,"""imagists."" As we have already noted, in Chapter II, they stress the"
1813,WALT WHITMAN,"individual reaction to phenomena, at some tense moment. They discard, as"
1814,WALT WHITMAN,"far as possible, the long ""loop-line"" of previous experience. As for"
1815,WALT WHITMAN,"diction, they have, like all true artists, a horror of the _cliché_--the"
1816,WALT WHITMAN,"rubber-stamp word, blurred by use. As for rhythm, they fear any"
1817,WALT WHITMAN,conventionality of pattern. In subsequent chapters we must look more
1818,WALT WHITMAN,"closely at these matters of diction and of rhythm, but they are both"
1819,WALT WHITMAN,involved in any statement of the principles of Imagist verse. Richard
1820,WALT WHITMAN,"Aldington sums up his article on ""The Imagists"""
1821,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: ""Greenwich Village,"" July 15, 1915.]"
1822,WALT WHITMAN,in these words:
1823,WALT WHITMAN,
1824,WALT WHITMAN,"""Let me resume the cardinal points of the Imagist style:"
1825,WALT WHITMAN,1. Direct treatment of the subject. 2. A hardness and economy of speech.
1826,WALT WHITMAN,3. Individuality of rhythm; vers libre. 4. The exact word. The Imagists
1827,WALT WHITMAN,"would like to possess 'le mot qui fait image, l'adjectif inattendu et"
1828,WALT WHITMAN,précis qui dessine de pied en cap et donne la senteur de la chose qu'il
1829,WALT WHITMAN,"est chargé de rendre, la touche juste, la couleur qui chatoie et vibre.'"""
1830,WALT WHITMAN,
1831,WALT WHITMAN,"In the preface to _Imagist Poets_ (1915), and in Miss Amy Lowell's"
1832,WALT WHITMAN,_Tendencies in Modern American Poetry_ (1917) the tenets of imagism are
1833,WALT WHITMAN,"stated briefly and clearly. Imagism, we are told, aims to use always the"
1834,WALT WHITMAN,"language of common speech, but to employ always the exact word, not the"
1835,WALT WHITMAN,nearly-exact nor the merely decorative word; to create new rhythms--as the
1836,WALT WHITMAN,"expression of new moods--and not to copy old rhythms, which merely echo"
1837,WALT WHITMAN,old moods; to allow absolute freedom in the choice of a subject; to
1838,WALT WHITMAN,"present an image, rendering particulars exactly; to produce poetry that is"
1839,WALT WHITMAN,"hard and clear, never blurred or indefinite; to secure condensation."
1840,WALT WHITMAN,
1841,WALT WHITMAN,It will be observed that in the special sort of picture-making which
1842,WALT WHITMAN,"Imagist poetry achieves, the question of free verse is merely incidental."
1843,WALT WHITMAN,"""We fight for it as a principle of liberty,"" says Miss Lowell, but she"
1844,WALT WHITMAN,does not insist upon it as the only method of writing poetry. Mr.
1845,WALT WHITMAN,Aldington admits frankly that about forty per cent of _vers libre_ is
1846,WALT WHITMAN,"prose. Mr. Lowes, as we have already remarked, has printed dozens of"
1847,WALT WHITMAN,passages from Meredith's novels in the typographical arrangement of free
1848,WALT WHITMAN,"verse so as to emphasize their ""imagist"" character. One of the most"
1849,WALT WHITMAN,effective is this:
1850,WALT WHITMAN,
1851,WALT WHITMAN,"""He was like a Tartar"
1852,WALT WHITMAN,Modelled by a Greek:

1858,WALT WHITMAN,"Suppose, however, that we agree to defer for the moment the vexed question"
1859,WALT WHITMAN,as to whether images of this kind are to be considered prose or verse.
1860,WALT WHITMAN,Examine simply for their vivid picture-making quality the collections
1861,WALT WHITMAN,"entitled _Imagist Poets_ (1915,1916,1917), or, in the _Anthology of"

1864,WALT WHITMAN,"Lowell's extraordinarily brilliant volume _Men, Women and Ghosts_ (1916),"
1865,WALT WHITMAN,"particularly the series of poems entitled ""Towns in Colour."" Then read the"
1866,WALT WHITMAN,"author's preface, in which her artistic purpose in writing ""Towns in"
1867,WALT WHITMAN,"Colour"" is set forth: ""In these poems, I have endeavoured to give the"
1868,WALT WHITMAN,"colour, and light, and shade, of certain places and hours, stressing _the"
1869,WALT WHITMAN,"purely pictorial effect_, and with little or no reference to any other"
1870,WALT WHITMAN,aspect of the places described. It is an enchanting thing to wander
1871,WALT WHITMAN,"through a city looking for its _unrelated beauty_, the beauty by which it"

1917,WALT WHITMAN,"portion of the poet's task, but in memorably great poetry it is only a"
1918,WALT WHITMAN,"detail in a  larger whole. Miss Lowell's ""Patterns"" is one of the most"
1919,WALT WHITMAN,"effective of contemporary poems, but it is far more than a document of"
1920,WALT WHITMAN,imagism. It is a triumph of structural imagination.

1923,WALT WHITMAN,_7. Genius and Inspiration_
1924,WALT WHITMAN,
1925,WALT WHITMAN,"Whatever may be the value, for students, of trying to analyse the"
1926,WALT WHITMAN,"image-making and image-combining faculty, every one admits that it is a"
1927,WALT WHITMAN,necessary element in the production of poetry. Let Coleridge have the
1928,WALT WHITMAN,"final statement of this mystery of his art: ""The power of reducing"
1929,WALT WHITMAN,"multitude into unity of effect, and modifying a series of thoughts by some"
1930,WALT WHITMAN,"one predominant thought or feeling, may be cultivated and improved, but"
1931,WALT WHITMAN,"can never be learnt. It is in this that _Poeta nascitur non fit_."" We"
1932,WALT WHITMAN,cannot avoid the difficulties of the question by attributing the poet's
1933,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination to ""genius."" Whether genius is a neurosis, as some think, or"
1934,WALT WHITMAN,"whether it is sanity at perfection, makes little difference here."
1935,WALT WHITMAN,Both a Poe and a Sophocles are equally capable of producing ideal
1936,WALT WHITMAN,"syntheses. Nor does the old word ""inspiration"" help much either."
1937,WALT WHITMAN,"Whatever we mean by inspiration--a something not ourselves, supernatural"
1938,WALT WHITMAN,"or sub-liminal--a ""vision"" of Blake, the ""voices"" of Joan of Arc, the"
1939,WALT WHITMAN,"""god"" that moved within the Corybantian revelers--it is an excitement of"
1940,WALT WHITMAN,"the image-making faculty, and not that faculty itself. Disordered ""genius"""
1941,WALT WHITMAN,and inspiration undisciplined by reason are alike powerless to produce
1942,WALT WHITMAN,images that permanently satisfy the sense of beauty. Tolstoy's common-
1943,WALT WHITMAN,"sense remark is surely sound: ""One's writing is good only where the"
1944,WALT WHITMAN,intelligence and the imagination are in equilibrium. As soon as one of
1945,WALT WHITMAN,"them over-balances the other, it's all up."""

1950,WALT WHITMAN,_8. A Summary_
1951,WALT WHITMAN,
1952,WALT WHITMAN,Let us now endeavor to summarize this testimony which we have taken
1953,WALT WHITMAN,"from poets and critics. Though they do not agree in all details, and"
1954,WALT WHITMAN,though they often use words that are either too vague or too highly
1955,WALT WHITMAN,"specialized, the general drift of the testimony is fairly clear. Poets"
1956,WALT WHITMAN,and critics agree that the imagination is something different from the
1957,WALT WHITMAN,mere memory-image; that by a process of selection and combination and
1958,WALT WHITMAN,"re-presentation of images something really new comes into being, and that"
1959,WALT WHITMAN,"we are therefore justified in using the term _constructive_, or _creative_"
1960,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination. This imagination embodies, as we say, or ""bodies forth,"" as"
1961,WALT WHITMAN,"Duke Theseus said, ""the forms of things unknown."" It ultimately becomes"
1962,WALT WHITMAN,"the poet's task to ""shape"" these forms with his ""pen,"" that is to say, to"
1963,WALT WHITMAN,"suggest them through word-symbols, arranged in a certain fashion. The"
1964,WALT WHITMAN,"selection of these word-symbols will be discussed in Chapter IV, and their"
1965,WALT WHITMAN,rhythmical arrangement in Chapter V. But we have tried in the present
1966,WALT WHITMAN,chapter to trace the functioning of the poetic imagination in those stages
1967,WALT WHITMAN,of its activity which precede the definite shaping of poems with the pen.
1968,WALT WHITMAN,"If we say, with Professor Fairchild,"
1969,WALT WHITMAN,"[Footnote: _Making of Poetry_, p. 34.]"
1970,WALT WHITMAN,"that ""the central processes or kinds of activity involved in the making of"
1971,WALT WHITMAN,"poetry are three: personalizing, combining and versifying,"" it is obvious"
1972,WALT WHITMAN,that we have been dealing with the first two. If we prefer to use the
1973,WALT WHITMAN,"famous terms employed by Ruskin in _Modern Painters_, we have been"
1974,WALT WHITMAN,"considering the penetrative, associative and contemplative types of"
1975,WALT WHITMAN,"imagination. But these Ruskinian names, however brilliantly and"
1976,WALT WHITMAN,"suggestively employed by the master, are dangerous tools for the beginner"
1977,WALT WHITMAN,in the study of poetry.
1978,WALT WHITMAN,
1979,WALT WHITMAN,"If the beginner desires to review, at this point, the chief matters"
1980,WALT WHITMAN,"brought to his attention in the present chapter, he may make a real test"
1981,WALT WHITMAN,of their validity by opening his senses to the imagery of a few lines of
1982,WALT WHITMAN,"poetry. Remember that poets are endeavoring to convey the ""sense"" of"
1983,WALT WHITMAN,things rather than the knowledge of things. Disregard for the moment the
1984,WALT WHITMAN,"precise words employed in the following lines, and concentrate the"
1985,WALT WHITMAN,"attention upon the images, as if the image were not made of words at all,"
1986,WALT WHITMAN,but were mere naked sense-stimulus.
1987,WALT WHITMAN,
1988,WALT WHITMAN,"In this line the poet is trying to make us _see_ something (""visual"""

2008,WALT WHITMAN,
2009,WALT WHITMAN,In these lines the poet is trying to make us feel certain bodily
2010,WALT WHITMAN,"sensations (""tactile"" image):"
2011,WALT WHITMAN,
2012,WALT WHITMAN,"""I closed my lids and kept them close,"
2013,WALT WHITMAN,_And the balls like pulses beat_;
2014,WALT WHITMAN,"For the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky,"
2015,WALT WHITMAN,"_Lay like a load on my weary eye_,"
2016,WALT WHITMAN,"And the dead were at my feet."""
2017,WALT WHITMAN,
2018,WALT WHITMAN,Do your eyes feel that pressure?
2019,WALT WHITMAN,
2020,WALT WHITMAN,You are sitting quite motionless in your chair as you read these lines
2021,WALT WHITMAN,"(""motor"" image):"
2022,WALT WHITMAN,
2023,WALT WHITMAN,"""I _sprang_ to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;"
2024,WALT WHITMAN,"I _galloped_, Dirck _galloped_, we _galloped_ all three!"""
2025,WALT WHITMAN,
2026,WALT WHITMAN,"Are you instantly on horseback? If you are, the poet has put you there by"
2027,WALT WHITMAN,"conveying from his mind to yours, through the use of verbal imagery and"
2028,WALT WHITMAN,"rhythm, his ""sense"" of riding, which has now become _your_ sense of"
2029,WALT WHITMAN,riding.
2030,WALT WHITMAN,
2031,WALT WHITMAN,If the reader can meet this test of realizing simple images through his
2032,WALT WHITMAN,"own body-and-mind reaction to their stimulus, the door of poetry is open"
2033,WALT WHITMAN,to him. He can enter into its limitless enjoyments. If he wishes to
2034,WALT WHITMAN,"analyse more closely the nature of the pleasure which poetry affords, he"
2035,WALT WHITMAN,"may select any lines he happens to like, and ask himself how the various"
2036,WALT WHITMAN,functions of the imagination are illustrated by them. Suppose the lines
2037,WALT WHITMAN,"are Coleridge's description of the bridal procession, already quoted in"
2038,WALT WHITMAN,part:
2039,WALT WHITMAN,
2040,WALT WHITMAN,"""The bride hath paced into the hall,"
2041,WALT WHITMAN,Red as a rose is she;
2042,WALT WHITMAN,Nodding their heads before her goes
2043,WALT WHITMAN,"The merry minstrelsy."""
2044,WALT WHITMAN,
2045,WALT WHITMAN,Here surely is imagination penetrative; the selection of some one
2046,WALT WHITMAN,"characteristic trait of the object; that trait (the ""redness"" or the"
2047,WALT WHITMAN,"""nodding"") re-presented to us, and emphasized by conferring, modifying or"
2048,WALT WHITMAN,abstracting whatever elements the poet wishes to stress or to suppress.
2049,WALT WHITMAN,"The result is a combination of imagery which forms an idealized picture,"
2050,WALT WHITMAN,presenting the shows of things as the mind would like to see them and thus
2051,WALT WHITMAN,satisfying our sense of beauty. For there is no question that the mind
2052,WALT WHITMAN,takes a supreme satisfaction in such an idealization of reality as
2053,WALT WHITMAN,"Coleridge's picture of the swift tropical sunset,"

2063,WALT WHITMAN,"a sense of beauty guides the ""shaping spirit of imagination"" in that dim"

2104,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Literary"" language is commonly distinguished from the language of"
2105,THE POET'S WORDS,ordinary life by certain heightenings or suppressions. The novelist or
2106,THE POET'S WORDS,"essayist, let us say, fashions his language more or less in accordance"
2107,THE POET'S WORDS,"with his own mood, with his immediate aim in writing, with the capacity of"
2108,THE POET'S WORDS,his expected readers. He is discoursing with a certain real or imaginary
2109,THE POET'S WORDS,"audience. He may put himself on paper, as Montaigne said, as if he were"
2110,THE POET'S WORDS,talking to the first man he happens to meet; or he may choose to address
2111,THE POET'S WORDS,himself to the few chosen spirits of his generation and of succeeding
2112,THE POET'S WORDS,generations. He trusts the arbitrary written or printed symbols of
2113,THE POET'S WORDS,word-sounds to carry his thoughts safely into the minds of other men.
2114,THE POET'S WORDS,"The ""literary"" user of language in modern times comes to depend upon"
2115,THE POET'S WORDS,"the written or printed page; he tends to become more or less ""eye-minded"";"
2116,THE POET'S WORDS,"whereas the typical orator remains ""ear-minded""--i.e. peculiarly sensitive"
2117,THE POET'S WORDS,"to a series of sounds, and composing for the ear of listeners rather than"
2118,THE POET'S WORDS,for the eye of readers.
2119,THE POET'S WORDS,
2120,THE POET'S WORDS,"Now as compared with the typical novelist, the poet is surely, like the"
2121,THE POET'S WORDS,"orator, ""ear-minded."" Tonal symbols of ideas and emotions, rather than"
2122,THE POET'S WORDS,"visual symbols of ideas and emotions, are the primary stuff with which he"
2123,THE POET'S WORDS,"is working, although as soon as the advancing civilization of his race"
2124,THE POET'S WORDS,brings an end to the primitive reciting of poetry and its transmission
2125,THE POET'S WORDS,"through oral repetition alone, it is obvious that he must depend, like"
2126,THE POET'S WORDS,"other literary artists, or like the modern musicians, upon the written or"
2127,THE POET'S WORDS,printed signs for the sounds which he has composed. But so stubborn are
2128,THE POET'S WORDS,the habits of our eyes that we tend always to confuse the look of the
2129,THE POET'S WORDS,poet's words upon the printed page with the sound of those words as they
2130,THE POET'S WORDS,are perceived by the ear. We are seldom guilty of this confusion in the
2131,THE POET'S WORDS,"case of the musician. His ""music"" is not identified with the arbitrary"
2132,THE POET'S WORDS,black marks which make up his printed score. For most of us there is
2133,THE POET'S WORDS,no music until those marks are actually translated into terms of tone--
2134,THE POET'S WORDS,although it is true that the trained reader of music can easily translate
2135,THE POET'S WORDS,to his inner ear without any audible rendering of the indicated sounds.
2136,THE POET'S WORDS,
2137,THE POET'S WORDS,This distinction is essential to the understanding of poetry. A poem is
2138,THE POET'S WORDS,not primarily a series of printed word-signs addressed to the eye; it is a
2139,THE POET'S WORDS,"series of sounds addressed to the ear, and the arbitrary symbols for these"
2140,THE POET'S WORDS,sounds do not convey the poem unless they are audibly rendered--except to
2141,THE POET'S WORDS,"those readers who, like the skilled readers of printed music, can"
2142,THE POET'S WORDS,instantly hear the indicated sounds without any actual rendition of them
2143,THE POET'S WORDS,into physical tone. Many professed lovers of poetry have no real ear for
2144,THE POET'S WORDS,"it. They are hopelessly ""eye-minded."" They try to decide questions of"
2145,THE POET'S WORDS,"metre and stanza, of free verse and of emotionally patterned prose by the"
2146,THE POET'S WORDS,appearance of the printed page instead of by the nerves of hearing. Poets
2147,THE POET'S WORDS,like Mr. Vachel Lindsay--who recites or chants his own verses after the
2148,THE POET'S WORDS,manner of the primitive bard--have rendered a true service by leading
2149,THE POET'S WORDS,"us away from the confusions wrought by typography, and back to that sheer"
2150,THE POET'S WORDS,delight in rhythmic oral utterance in which poetry originates.

2154,THE POET'S WORDS,
2155,THE POET'S WORDS,"For it must never be forgotten that poetry begins in excitement, in some"
2156,THE POET'S WORDS,"body-and-mind experience; that it is capable, through its rhythmic"
2157,THE POET'S WORDS,"utterance of words which suggest this experience, of transmitting emotion"
2158,THE POET'S WORDS,to the hearer; and that the nature of language allows the emotion to be
2159,THE POET'S WORDS,embodied in more or less permanent form. Let us look more closely at some
2160,THE POET'S WORDS,"of the questions involved in the origin, the transmission and embodiment"
2161,THE POET'S WORDS,"of poetic feeling, remembering that we are now trying to trace these"
2162,THE POET'S WORDS,processes in so far as they are revealed by the poet's use of words.
2163,THE POET'S WORDS,Rhythm will be discussed in the next chapter.
2164,THE POET'S WORDS,
2165,THE POET'S WORDS,We have already noted that there are no mental images of feeling itself.
2166,THE POET'S WORDS,The images recognized by the consciousness of poets are those of
2167,THE POET'S WORDS,experiences and objects associated with feeling. The words employed to
2168,THE POET'S WORDS,"revive and transmit these images are usually described as ""concrete"" or"
2169,THE POET'S WORDS,"""sensuous"" in distinction from abstract or purely conceptual. They are"
2170,THE POET'S WORDS,"""experiential"" words, arising out of bodily or spiritual contact with"
2171,THE POET'S WORDS,"objects or ideas that have been personalized, colored with individual"
2172,THE POET'S WORDS,"feeling. Such words have a ""fringe,"" as psychologists say. They are rich"
2173,THE POET'S WORDS,"in overtones of meaning; not bare, like words addressed to the sheer"
2174,THE POET'S WORDS,"intelligence, but covered with veils of association, with tokens of past"
2175,THE POET'S WORDS,"experience. They are like ships laden with cargoes, although the cargo"
2176,THE POET'S WORDS,varies with the texture and the history of each mind. It is probable that
2177,THE POET'S WORDS,"this very word ""ship,"" just now employed, calls up as many different"
2178,THE POET'S WORDS,mental images as there are readers of this page. Brander Matthews has
2179,THE POET'S WORDS,recorded a curious divergence of imagery aroused by the familiar word
2180,THE POET'S WORDS,"""forest."" Half a dozen well-known men of letters, chatting together in a"
2181,THE POET'S WORDS,"London club, tried to tell one another what ""forest"" suggested to each:"
2182,THE POET'S WORDS,
2183,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Until that evening I had never thought of forest as clothing itself"
2184,THE POET'S WORDS,in different colors and taking on different forms in the eyes of
2185,THE POET'S WORDS,different men; but I then discovered that even the most innocent
2186,THE POET'S WORDS,word may don strange disguises. To Hardy forest suggested the sturdy
2187,THE POET'S WORDS,oaks to be assaulted by the woodlanders of Wessex; and to Du Maurier
2188,THE POET'S WORDS,it evoked the trim and tidy avenues of the national domain of France.
2189,THE POET'S WORDS,To Black the word naturally brought to mind the low scrub of the
2190,THE POET'S WORDS,so-called deer-forests of Scotland; and to Gosse it summoned up a
2191,THE POET'S WORDS,view of the green-clad mountains that towered up from the
2192,THE POET'S WORDS,Scandinavian fiords. To Howells forest recalled the thick woods that
2193,THE POET'S WORDS,in his youth fringed the rivers of Ohio; and to me there came back
2194,THE POET'S WORDS,"swiftly the memory of the wild growths, bristling unrestrained by"
2195,THE POET'S WORDS,"man, in the Chippewa Reservation which I had crossed fourteen years"
2196,THE POET'S WORDS,before in my canoe trip from Lake Superior to the Mississippi. Simple
2197,THE POET'S WORDS,"as the word seemed, it was interpreted by each of us in accord with"
2198,THE POET'S WORDS,his previous personal experience. And these divergent experiences
2199,THE POET'S WORDS,exchanged that evening brought home to me as never before the
2200,THE POET'S WORDS,inherent and inevitable inadequacy of the vocabulary of every
2201,THE POET'S WORDS,"language, since there must always be two partners in any communication"
2202,THE POET'S WORDS,"by means of words, and the verbal currency passing from one to the other"
2203,THE POET'S WORDS,"has no fixed value necessarily the same to both of them."""

2206,THE POET'S WORDS,
2207,THE POET'S WORDS,But one need not journey to London town in order to test this matter. Let
2208,THE POET'S WORDS,half a dozen healthy young Americans stop before the window of a shop
2209,THE POET'S WORDS,"where sporting goods are exhibited. Here are fishing-rods, tennis"
2210,THE POET'S WORDS,"racquets, riding-whips, golf-balls, running-shoes, baseball bats,"
2211,THE POET'S WORDS,"footballs, oars, paddles, snow-shoes, goggles for motorists, Indian clubs"
2212,THE POET'S WORDS,and rifles. Each of these physical objects focuses the attention of the
2213,THE POET'S WORDS,observer in more or less exact proportion to his interest in the
2214,THE POET'S WORDS,particular sport suggested by the implement. If he is a passionate tennis
2215,THE POET'S WORDS,"player, a thousand motor-tactile memories are stirred by the sight of the"
2216,THE POET'S WORDS,"racquet. He is already balancing it in his fingers, playing his favorite"
2217,THE POET'S WORDS,"strokes with it, winning tournaments with it--though he seems to be"
2218,THE POET'S WORDS,standing quietly in front of the window. The man next him is already
2219,THE POET'S WORDS,"snowshoeing over the frozen hills. But if a man has never played lacrosse,"
2220,THE POET'S WORDS,"or been on horseback, or mastered a canoe, the lacrosse racquet or"
2221,THE POET'S WORDS,"riding-whip or paddle mean little to him emotionally, except that they may"
2222,THE POET'S WORDS,stir his imaginative curiosity about a sport whose pleasures he has never
2223,THE POET'S WORDS,experienced. His eye is likely to pass them over as indifferently as if he
2224,THE POET'S WORDS,were glancing at the window of a druggist or a grocer. These varying
2225,THE POET'S WORDS,responses of the individual to the visual stimulus of this or that
2226,THE POET'S WORDS,physical object in a heterogeneous collection may serve to illustrate his
2227,THE POET'S WORDS,capacity for feeling. Our chance group before the shop window thus becomes
2228,THE POET'S WORDS,a symbol of all human minds as they confront the actual visible universe.
2229,THE POET'S WORDS,"They hunger and thirst for this or that particular thing, while another"
2230,THE POET'S WORDS,object leaves them cold.

2235,THE POET'S WORDS,Not even the most vivid and picturesque word chosen by the best talker of
2236,THE POET'S WORDS,the company has the same meaning for them all. They all understand the
2237,THE POET'S WORDS,"word, approximately, but each _feels_ it in a way unexperienced by his"
2238,THE POET'S WORDS,"friend. The freightage of significance carried by each concrete, sensuous,"
2239,THE POET'S WORDS,picture-making word is bound to vary according to the entire physical and
2240,THE POET'S WORDS,mental history of the man who hears it. Even the commonest and most
2241,THE POET'S WORDS,"universal words for things and sensations--such as ""hand,"" ""foot,"" ""dark,"""
2242,THE POET'S WORDS,"""fear,"" ""fire,"" ""warm,"" ""home""--are suffused with personal emotions,"
2243,THE POET'S WORDS,"faintly or clearly felt; they have been or are _my_ hand, foot, fear,"
2244,THE POET'S WORDS,"darkness, warmth, happiness. Now the poet is like a man talking or singing"
2245,THE POET'S WORDS,"in the dark to a circle of friends. He cannot say to them ""See this"" or"
2246,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Feel that"" in the literal sense of ""see"" and ""feel""; he can only call up"
2247,THE POET'S WORDS,"by means of words and tunes what his friends have seen and felt already,"
2248,THE POET'S WORDS,"and then under the excitement of such memories suggest new combinations,"
2249,THE POET'S WORDS,"new weavings of the infinitely varied web of human experience, new voyages"
2250,THE POET'S WORDS,with fresh sails upon seas untried.
2251,THE POET'S WORDS,
2252,THE POET'S WORDS,It is true that we may picture the poet as singing or talking to himself
2253,THE POET'S WORDS,"in solitude and darkness, obeying primarily the impulse of expression"
2254,THE POET'S WORDS,rather than of communication. Hence John Stuart Mill's distinction between
2255,THE POET'S WORDS,"the orator and the poet: ""Eloquence is _heard_; poetry is _over_heard."
2256,THE POET'S WORDS,Eloquence supposes an audience. The peculiarity of poetry appears to us to
2257,THE POET'S WORDS,lie in the poet's utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling
2258,THE POET'S WORDS,"confessing itself to itself in moments of solitude, and embodying itself"
2259,THE POET'S WORDS,in symbols which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling
2260,THE POET'S WORDS,"in the exact shape in which it exists in the poet's mind."""

2396,THE POET'S WORDS,Now take the case of a Chinese boy who has come to an American school and
2397,THE POET'S WORDS,college. Just before writing this paragraph I have read the blue-book of
2398,THE POET'S WORDS,"such a boy, written in a Harvard examination on Tennyson. It was an"
2399,THE POET'S WORDS,"exceptionally well-expressed blue-book, in idiomatic English, and it"
2400,THE POET'S WORDS,revealed an unusual appreciation of Tennyson's delicate and sure
2401,THE POET'S WORDS,"felicities of speech. The Chinese boy, by dint of an intellectual effort"
2402,THE POET'S WORDS,"of which most of his American classmates were incapable, had mastered many"
2403,THE POET'S WORDS,"of the secrets of an alien tongue, and had taken possession of the rich"

2405,THE POET'S WORDS,"instead of writing a college blue-book, it is likely that he would have"
2406,THE POET'S WORDS,"preferred to use his own mother-tongue, as the more natural medium for the"
2407,THE POET'S WORDS,"expression of his intimate thoughts and feelings. But that expression, no"
2408,THE POET'S WORDS,"matter how artistic, would have ""communicated"" nothing whatever to an"
2409,THE POET'S WORDS,American professor ignorant of the Chinese language. It is clear that the

2415,THE POET'S WORDS,
2416,THE POET'S WORDS,And it is precisely here that we face one of the fundamental difficulties
2417,THE POET'S WORDS,"of the poet's task; a difficulty that affects, indeed, all human"
2418,THE POET'S WORDS,intercourse. For words are notoriously an imperfect medium of
2419,THE POET'S WORDS,"communication. They ""were not invented at first,"" says Professor Walter"
2420,THE POET'S WORDS,"Raleigh in his book on Wordsworth, ""and are very imperfectly adapted at"
2421,THE POET'S WORDS,"best, for the severer purposes of truth. They bear upon them all the"
2422,THE POET'S WORDS,"weaknesses of their origin, and all the maims inflicted by the"
2423,THE POET'S WORDS,prejudices and fanaticisms of generations of their employers. They
2424,THE POET'S WORDS,perpetuate the memory or prolong the life of many noble forms of human
2425,THE POET'S WORDS,"extravagance, and they are the monuments of many splendid virtues. But"
2426,THE POET'S WORDS,with all their abilities and dignities they are seldom well fitted for the
2427,THE POET'S WORDS,quiet and accurate statement of the thing that is.... Beasts fight with
2428,THE POET'S WORDS,"horns, and men, when the guns are silent, with words. The changes of"
2429,THE POET'S WORDS,"meaning in words from good to bad and from bad to good senses, which are"
2430,THE POET'S WORDS,"quite independent of their root meaning, is proof enough, without detailed"
2431,THE POET'S WORDS,"illustration, of the incessant nature of the strife. The question is not"
2432,THE POET'S WORDS,"what a word means, but what it imputes."""
2433,THE POET'S WORDS,"[Footnote: Raleigh's _Wordsworth_. London, 1903.]"
2434,THE POET'S WORDS,
2435,THE POET'S WORDS,Now if the quiet and accurate statement of things as they are is the ideal
2436,THE POET'S WORDS,"language of prose, it is obvious that the characteristic diction of poetry"
2437,THE POET'S WORDS,"is unquiet, inaccurate, incurably emotional. Herein lie its dangers and"
2438,THE POET'S WORDS,"its glories. No poet can keep for very long to the ""neutral style,"" to the"
2439,THE POET'S WORDS,"cool gray wallpaper words, so to speak; he wants more color---passionate"
2440,THE POET'S WORDS,"words that will ""stick fiery off"" against the neutral background of"
2441,THE POET'S WORDS,"conventional diction. In vain does Horace warn him against ""purple"
2442,THE POET'S WORDS,"patches""; for he knows that the tolerant Horace allowed himself to use"
2443,THE POET'S WORDS,purple patches whenever he wished. All employers of language for emotional
2444,THE POET'S WORDS,"effect--orators, novelists, essayists, writers of editorials--utilize in"
2445,THE POET'S WORDS,"certain passages these colored, heightened, figured words. It is as if"
2446,THE POET'S WORDS,they ordered their printers to set individual words or whole groups of
2447,THE POET'S WORDS,words in upper-case type.
2448,THE POET'S WORDS,
2449,THE POET'S WORDS,"And yet these ""upper-case words"" of heightened emotional value are not"
2450,THE POET'S WORDS,really isolated from their context. Their values are relative and not
2451,THE POET'S WORDS,"absolute. Like the high lights of a picture, their effectiveness depends"
2452,THE POET'S WORDS,upon the tone of the composition as a whole. To insert a big or violent
2453,THE POET'S WORDS,word for its own potency is like sewing the purple patch upon a faded
2454,THE POET'S WORDS,garment. The predominant thought and feeling of a passage give the
2455,THE POET'S WORDS,"richest individual words their penetrating power, just as the weight of"
2456,THE POET'S WORDS,"the axe-head sinks the blade into the wood. ""Futurist"" poets like"
2457,THE POET'S WORDS,"Marinetti have protested against the bonds of syntax, the necessity of"
2458,THE POET'S WORDS,"logical subject and predicate, and have experimented with nouns alone."
2459,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Words delivered from the fetters of punctuation,"" says Marinetti, ""will"
2460,THE POET'S WORDS,"flash against one another, will interlace their various forms of"
2461,THE POET'S WORDS,"magnetism, and follow the uninterrupted dynamics of force."""

2485,THE POET'S WORDS,5. _Predominant Tone-Feeling_
2486,THE POET'S WORDS,
2487,THE POET'S WORDS,"If each poem is composed in its own ""key,"" as we say of music, with its"
2488,THE POET'S WORDS,"own scale of ""values,"" as we say of pictures, it is obvious that the"
2489,THE POET'S WORDS,separate words tend to take on tones and hues from the predominant
2490,THE POET'S WORDS,"tone-feeling of the poem. It is a sort of protective coloration, like"
2491,THE POET'S WORDS,"Nature's devices for blending birds and insects into their background; or,"
2492,THE POET'S WORDS,"to choose a more prosaic illustration, like dipping a lump of sugar into a"
2493,THE POET'S WORDS,cup of coffee. The white sugar and the yellowish cream and the black
2494,THE POET'S WORDS,"coffee blend into something unlike any of the separate ingredients, yet"
2495,THE POET'S WORDS,the presence of each is felt. It is true that some words refuse to be
2496,THE POET'S WORDS,absorbed into the texture of the poem: they remain as it were foreign
2497,THE POET'S WORDS,"substances in the stream of imagery, something alien, stubborn, jarring,"
2498,THE POET'S WORDS,although expressive enough in themselves. All the pioneers in poetic
2499,THE POET'S WORDS,"diction assume this risk of using ""un-poetic"" words in their desire to"
2500,THE POET'S WORDS,"employ expressive words. Classic examples are Wordsworth's homely ""tubs"""
2501,THE POET'S WORDS,"and ""porringers,"" and Walt Whitman's catalogues of everyday implements"
2502,THE POET'S WORDS,used in various trades. _Othello_ was hissed upon its first appearance on
2503,THE POET'S WORDS,"the Paris stage because of that ""vulgar"" word handkerchief. Thus ""fork"""
2504,THE POET'S WORDS,"and ""spoon"" have almost purely utilitarian associations and are"
2505,THE POET'S WORDS,"consequently difficult terms for the service of poetry, but ""knife"" has a"
2506,THE POET'S WORDS,wider range of suggestion. Did not the peaceful Robert Louis Stevenson
2507,THE POET'S WORDS,"confess his romantic longing to ""knife a man""?"
2508,THE POET'S WORDS,
2509,THE POET'S WORDS,But it is not necessary to multiply illustrations of this law of
2510,THE POET'S WORDS,"connotation. The true poetic value of a word lies partly in its history,"
2511,THE POET'S WORDS,"in its past employments, and partly also in the new vitality which it"
2512,THE POET'S WORDS,receives from each brain which fills the word with its own life. It is
2513,THE POET'S WORDS,"like an old violin, with its subtle overtones, the result of many"
2514,THE POET'S WORDS,"vibrations of the past, but yet each new player may coax a new tune from"
2515,THE POET'S WORDS,it. When Wordsworth writes of
2516,THE POET'S WORDS,
2517,THE POET'S WORDS,"""The silence that is in the starry sky,"
2518,THE POET'S WORDS,"The sleep that is among the lonely hills,"""
2519,THE POET'S WORDS,
2520,THE POET'S WORDS,he is combining words that are immemorially familiar into a total effect
2521,THE POET'S WORDS,"that is peculiarly ""Wordsworthian."" Diction is obviously only a part of a"
2522,THE POET'S WORDS,greater whole in which ideas and emotions are also merged. A concordance
2523,THE POET'S WORDS,"of all the words employed by a poet teaches us much about him, and"
2524,THE POET'S WORDS,conversely a knowledge of the poet's personality and of his governing
2525,THE POET'S WORDS,ideas helps us in the study of his diction. Poets often have favorite

2527,THE POET'S WORDS,"Swinburne's ""fire."" Each of these words becomes suffused with the whole"
2528,THE POET'S WORDS,personality of the poet who employs it. It not only cannot be taken out of
2529,THE POET'S WORDS,"its context in the particular poem in which it appears, but it cannot be"
2530,THE POET'S WORDS,adequately _felt_ without some recognition of the particular sensational
2531,THE POET'S WORDS,and emotional experience which prompted its use. Many concordance-hunters
2532,THE POET'S WORDS,"thus miss the real game, and fall into the Renaissance error of"
2533,THE POET'S WORDS,"word-grubbing for its own sake, as if mere words had a value of their own"
2534,THE POET'S WORDS,independently of the life breathed into them by living men. I recall a
2535,THE POET'S WORDS,conversation at Bormes with the French poet Angellier. He was complaining
2536,THE POET'S WORDS,"humorously of his friend L., a famous scholar whose big book was ""carrying"
2537,THE POET'S WORDS,all the treasures of French literature down to posterity like a
2538,THE POET'S WORDS,"cold-storage transport ship."" ""But he published a criticism of one of my"
2539,THE POET'S WORDS,"poems,"" Angellier went on, ""which proved that he did not understand the"
2540,THE POET'S WORDS,poem at all. He had studied it too hard! The words of a poem are
2541,THE POET'S WORDS,"stepping-stones across a brook. If you linger on one of them too long, you"
2542,THE POET'S WORDS,"will get your feet wet! You must cross, _vite_!"" If the poets lead us from"
2543,THE POET'S WORDS,"one mood to another over a bridge of words, the words themselves are not"
2544,THE POET'S WORDS,the goal of the journey. They are instruments used in the transmission of
2545,THE POET'S WORDS,emotion.

2549,THE POET'S WORDS,
2550,THE POET'S WORDS,"It is obvious, then, that the full poetic value of a word cannot be"
2551,THE POET'S WORDS,ascertained apart from its context. The value is relative and not
2552,THE POET'S WORDS,"absolute. And nevertheless, just as the bit of colored glass may have a"
2553,THE POET'S WORDS,"certain interest and beauty of its own, independently of its possible"
2554,THE POET'S WORDS,"place in the rose-window, it is true that separate words possess special"
2555,THE POET'S WORDS,qualities of physical and emotional suggestiveness. Dangerous as it is to
2556,THE POET'S WORDS,characterize the qualities of the sound of a word apart from the sense of
2557,THE POET'S WORDS,"that word, there is undeniably such a thing as ""tone-color."" A piano and a"
2558,THE POET'S WORDS,"violin, striking the same note, are easily differentiated by the quality"
2559,THE POET'S WORDS,"of the sound, and of two violins, playing the same series of notes, it is"
2560,THE POET'S WORDS,usually possible to declare which instrument has the richer tone or
2561,THE POET'S WORDS,"timbre. Words, likewise, differ greatly in tone-quality. A great deal of"
2562,THE POET'S WORDS,"ingenuity has been devoted to the analysis of ""bright"" and ""dark"" vowels,"
2563,THE POET'S WORDS,"smooth and harsh consonants, with the aim of showing that each sound has"
2564,THE POET'S WORDS,"its special expressive force, its peculiar adaptability to transmit a"
2565,THE POET'S WORDS,certain kind of feeling. Says Professor A. H. Tolman:
2566,THE POET'S WORDS,"[Footnote: ""The Symbolic Value of Sounds,"" in _Hamlet and Other Essays_,"
2567,THE POET'S WORDS,"by A. H. Tolman. Boston, 1904.]"

2569,THE POET'S WORDS,
2570,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Let us arrange the English vowel sounds in the following scale:"
2571,THE POET'S WORDS,
2572,THE POET'S WORDS,[short i] (little)     [long i]   (I)         [short oo] (wood)
2573,THE POET'S WORDS,[short e] (met)        [long u]   (due)       [long ow]  (cow)
2574,THE POET'S WORDS,[short a] (mat)        [short ah] (what)      [long o]   (gold)
2575,THE POET'S WORDS,[long e]  (mete)       [long ah]  (father)    [long oo]  (gloom)

2578,THE POET'S WORDS,
2579,THE POET'S WORDS,"""The sounds at the beginning of this scale are especially fitted to"
2580,THE POET'S WORDS,"express uncontrollable joy and delight, gayety, triviality, rapid"
2581,THE POET'S WORDS,"movement, brightness, delicacy, and physical littleness; the sounds"
2582,THE POET'S WORDS,"at the end are peculiarly adapted to express horror, solemnity, awe,"
2583,THE POET'S WORDS,"deep grief, slowness of motion, darkness, and extreme or oppressive"
2584,THE POET'S WORDS,"greatness of size. The scale runs, then, from the little to the"

2588,THE POET'S WORDS,Robert Louis Stevenson in his _Some Technical Elements of Style in
2589,THE POET'S WORDS,"Literature_, and many other curious searchers into the secrets of words,"
2590,THE POET'S WORDS,have attempted to explain the physiological basis of these varying
2591,THE POET'S WORDS,"""tone-qualities."" Some of them are obviously imitative of sounds in"
2592,THE POET'S WORDS,nature; some are merely suggestive of these sounds through more or less
2593,THE POET'S WORDS,remote analogies; some are frankly imitative of muscular effort or of
2594,THE POET'S WORDS,"muscular relaxation. High-pitched vowels and low-pitched vowels, liquid"
2595,THE POET'S WORDS,"consonants and harsh consonants, are unquestionably associated with"
2596,THE POET'S WORDS,"muscular memories, that is to say, with individual body-and-mind"
2597,THE POET'S WORDS,experiences. Lines like Tennyson's famous
2598,THE POET'S WORDS,

2600,THE POET'S WORDS,"And murmuring of innumerable bees"""

2603,THE POET'S WORDS,"history of countless physical sensations, widely shared by innumerable"
2604,THE POET'S WORDS,"individuals, and it is to this fact that the ""transmission value"" of the"
2605,THE POET'S WORDS,lines is due.
2606,THE POET'S WORDS,
2607,THE POET'S WORDS,"Imitative effects are easily recognized, and need no comment:"

2617,THE POET'S WORDS,those rhythmical arrangements of words which we shall discuss in the next
2618,THE POET'S WORDS,"chapter, but poetry often employs the sound of single words to awaken dim"
2619,THE POET'S WORDS,or bright associations. Robert Bridges's catalogue of the Greek nymphs in
2620,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Eros and Psyche"" is an extreme example of risking the total effect of a"

2677,THE POET'S WORDS,"asserts bluntly: ""When you say Titan you mean something big, and when you"
2678,THE POET'S WORDS,say tittle you mean something small; but it is not the sound of either
2679,THE POET'S WORDS,"word that means either bigness or littleness, it is the sense. If you put"
2680,THE POET'S WORDS,"together a great many similar consonants in one sentence, they will"
2681,THE POET'S WORDS,"attract special attention to the words in which they occur, and the"
2682,THE POET'S WORDS,"significance of those words, whatever it may be, is thereby intensified;"
2683,THE POET'S WORDS,but whether the words are 'a team of little atomies' or 'a triumphant

2856,THE POET'S WORDS,"The use and the effectiveness of figures depend primarily, then, upon the"
2857,THE POET'S WORDS,"mood and intentions of the writer. Figures are figures, whether employed"
2858,THE POET'S WORDS,in prose or verse. Mr. Kipling does not lose his capacity for employing

2867,THE POET'S WORDS,8. _Words as Permanent Embodiment of Poetic Feeling_
2868,THE POET'S WORDS,
2869,THE POET'S WORDS,We have seen that the characteristic vocabulary of poetry originates in
2870,THE POET'S WORDS,emotion and that it is capable of transmitting emotion to the hearer or
2871,THE POET'S WORDS,reader. But how far are words capable of embodying emotion in permanent
2872,THE POET'S WORDS,"form? Poets themselves, in proud consciousness of the enduring character"
2873,THE POET'S WORDS,"of their creations, have often boasted that they were building monuments"
2874,THE POET'S WORDS,more enduring than bronze or marble. When Shakspere asserts this in his
2875,THE POET'S WORDS,"sonnets, he is following not only an Elizabethan convention, but a"
2876,THE POET'S WORDS,universal instinct of the men of his craft. Is it a delusion? Here are
2877,THE POET'S WORDS,"words--mere vibrating sounds, light and winged and evanescent things,"
2878,THE POET'S WORDS,assuming a meaning value only through the common consent of those who
2879,THE POET'S WORDS,"interchange them, altering that meaning more or less from year to year,"
2880,THE POET'S WORDS,"often passing wholly from the living speech of men, decaying when races"
2881,THE POET'S WORDS,"decay and civilizations change. What transiency, what waste and oblivion"
2882,THE POET'S WORDS,like that which waits upon millions on millions of autumn leaves!
2883,THE POET'S WORDS,
2884,THE POET'S WORDS,Yet nothing in human history is more indisputable than the fact that
2885,THE POET'S WORDS,"certain passages of poetry do survive, age after age, while empires pass,"
2886,THE POET'S WORDS,and philosophies change and science alters the mental attitude of men as
2887,THE POET'S WORDS,well as the outward circumstances of life upon this planet.
2888,THE POET'S WORDS,
2889,THE POET'S WORDS,"Some thoughts and feelings, then, eternalize themselves in human speech;"
2890,THE POET'S WORDS,most thoughts and feelings do not. Wherein lies the difference?
2891,THE POET'S WORDS,"If most words are perishable stuff, what is it that keeps other words from"
2892,THE POET'S WORDS,perishing? Is it superior organization and arrangement of this fragile
2893,THE POET'S WORDS,"material, ""fame's great antiseptic, style""? Or is it by virtue of some"
2894,THE POET'S WORDS,"secret passionate quality imparted to words by the poet, so that the"
2895,THE POET'S WORDS,apparently familiar syllables take on a life and significance which is
2896,THE POET'S WORDS,"really not their own, but his? And is this intimate personalized quality"
2897,THE POET'S WORDS,"of words ""style,"" also, as well as that more external ""style"" revealed in"
2898,THE POET'S WORDS,clear and orderly and idiomatic arrangement? Or does the mystery of
2899,THE POET'S WORDS,"permanence reside in the poet's generalizing power, by which he is able to"
2900,THE POET'S WORDS,"express universal, and hence permanently interesting human experience? And"
2901,THE POET'S WORDS,"therefore, was not the late Professor Courthope right when he declared, ""I"
2902,THE POET'S WORDS,"take all great poetry to be not so much what Plato thought it, the"
2903,THE POET'S WORDS,"utterance of individual genius, half inspired, half insane, as the"
2904,THE POET'S WORDS,"enduring voice of the soul and conscience of man living in society""?"
2905,THE POET'S WORDS,
2906,THE POET'S WORDS,"Answers to such questions as these depend somewhat upon the ""romantic"" or"
2907,THE POET'S WORDS,"""classic"" bias of the critics. Romantic criticism tends to stress the"
2908,THE POET'S WORDS,significance of the personality of the individual poet. The classic school
2909,THE POET'S WORDS,of criticism tends to emphasize the more general and universal qualities
2910,THE POET'S WORDS,revealed by the poet's work. But while the schools and  fashions of
2911,THE POET'S WORDS,criticism shift their ground and alter their verdicts as succeeding
2912,THE POET'S WORDS,"generations change in taste, the great poets continue as before to"
2913,THE POET'S WORDS,"particularize and also to generalize, to be ""romantic"" and ""classic"" by"
2914,THE POET'S WORDS,"turns, or even in the same poem. They defy critical augury, in their"
2915,THE POET'S WORDS,"unending quest of beauty and truth. That they succeed, now and then, in"
2916,THE POET'S WORDS,giving a permanently lovely embodiment to their vision is surely a more
2917,THE POET'S WORDS,important fact than the rightness or wrongness of whatever artistic theory
2918,THE POET'S WORDS,they may have invoked or followed.
2919,THE POET'S WORDS,
2920,THE POET'S WORDS,"For many a time, surely, their triumphs are a contradiction of their"
2921,THE POET'S WORDS,"theories. To take a very familiar example, Wordsworth's theory of poetic"
2922,THE POET'S WORDS,diction shifted like a weathercock. In the Advertisement to the _Lyrical
2923,THE POET'S WORDS,"Ballads_ (1798) he asserted: ""The following poems are to be considered as"
2924,THE POET'S WORDS,experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far
2925,THE POET'S WORDS,the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is
2926,THE POET'S WORDS,"adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure."" In the Preface of the second"
2927,THE POET'S WORDS,"edition (1800) he announced that his purpose had been ""to ascertain how"
2928,THE POET'S WORDS,"far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language"
2929,THE POET'S WORDS,"of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that"
2930,THE POET'S WORDS,"quantity of pleasure may be imparted, which a poet may rationally"
2931,THE POET'S WORDS,"endeavour to impart."" But in the famous remarks on poetic diction which"
2932,THE POET'S WORDS,"accompanied the third edition (1802) he inserted after the words ""A"
2933,THE POET'S WORDS,"selection of language really used by men"" this additional statement of his"
2934,THE POET'S WORDS,"intention: ""And at the same time to throw over them a certain colouring of"
2935,THE POET'S WORDS,the imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in
2936,THE POET'S WORDS,"an unusual aspect."" In place of the original statement about the"
2937,THE POET'S WORDS,"conversation of the middle and lower classes of society, we are now"
2938,THE POET'S WORDS,"assured that the language of poetry ""if selected truly and judiciously,"
2939,THE POET'S WORDS,must necessarily be dignified and variegated and alive with metaphors and
2940,THE POET'S WORDS,figures.... This selection will form a distinction ... and will entirely
2941,THE POET'S WORDS,separate the composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary
2942,THE POET'S WORDS,"life."""
2943,THE POET'S WORDS,
2944,THE POET'S WORDS,What an amazing change in theory in four years! Yet it is no more
2945,THE POET'S WORDS,remarkable than Wordsworth's successive emendations in the text of his
2946,THE POET'S WORDS,poems. In 1807 his blind Highland boy had gone voyaging in
2947,THE POET'S WORDS,
2948,THE POET'S WORDS,"""A Household Tub, like one of those"
2949,THE POET'S WORDS,Which women use to wash their clothes;

2951,THE POET'S WORDS,

2957,THE POET'S WORDS,
2958,THE POET'S WORDS,And in 1820 the worried and dissatisfied artist changes that unlucky

2969,THE POET'S WORDS,"""I've measured it from side to side,"
2970,THE POET'S WORDS,"'T is three feet long and two feet wide""--"
2971,THE POET'S WORDS,
2972,THE POET'S WORDS,became in 1820:
2973,THE POET'S WORDS,
2974,THE POET'S WORDS,"""Though but of compass small and bare"
2975,THE POET'S WORDS,"To thirsty suns and parching air."""
2976,THE POET'S WORDS,
2977,THE POET'S WORDS,"Like his friend Coleridge, Wordsworth forsook gradually his early"
2978,THE POET'S WORDS,"experiments with matter-of-fact phrases, with quaintly grotesque figures."
2979,THE POET'S WORDS,Revolt against conventional eighteenth-century diction had given him a
2980,THE POET'S WORDS,"blessed sense of freedom, but he found his real strength later in subduing"
2981,THE POET'S WORDS,"that freedom to a sense of law. Archaisms, queernesses, flatly"
2982,THE POET'S WORDS,naturalistic turns of speech gave place to a vocabulary of simple dignity
2983,THE POET'S WORDS,and austere beauty. Wordsworth attained his highest originality as an
2984,THE POET'S WORDS,"artist by disregarding singularity, by making familiar words reveal new"
2985,THE POET'S WORDS,potencies of expression.
2986,THE POET'S WORDS,
2987,THE POET'S WORDS,"For after all, we must come back to what William James called the long"
2988,THE POET'S WORDS,"""loop-line,"" to that reservoir of ideas and feelings which stores up the"
2989,THE POET'S WORDS,"experience of individuals and of the race, and to the words which most"
2990,THE POET'S WORDS,"effectively evoke that experience. Two classes at Columbia University, a"
2991,THE POET'S WORDS,"few years ago, were asked to select fifty English words of basic"
2992,THE POET'S WORDS,"importance in the expression of human life. In choosing these words, they"
2993,THE POET'S WORDS,were to aim at reality and strength rather than at beauty. When the two
2994,THE POET'S WORDS,"lists were combined, they presented these seventy-eight different words,"
2995,THE POET'S WORDS,"which are here arranged alphabetically: age, ambition, beauty, bloom,"
2996,THE POET'S WORDS,"country, courage, dawn, day, death, despair, destiny, devotion, dirge,"
2997,THE POET'S WORDS,"disaster, divine, dream, earth, enchantment, eternity, fair, faith,"
2998,THE POET'S WORDS,"fantasy, flower, fortune, freedom, friendship, glory, glow, god, grief,"
2999,THE POET'S WORDS,"happiness, harmony, hate, heart, heaven, honor, hope, immortality, joy,"
3000,THE POET'S WORDS,"justice, knell, life, longing, love, man, melancholy, melody, mercy, moon,"
3001,THE POET'S WORDS,"mortal, nature, noble, night, paradise, parting, peace, pleasure, pride,"
3002,THE POET'S WORDS,"regret, sea, sigh, sleep, solitude, song, sorrow, soul, spirit, spring,"
3003,THE POET'S WORDS,"star, suffer, tears, tender, time, virtue, weep, whisper, wind and youth."
3004,THE POET'S WORDS,"[Footnote: See Nation, February 23, 1911.]"
3005,THE POET'S WORDS,
3006,THE POET'S WORDS,"Surely these words, selected as they were for their significance, are not"
3007,THE POET'S WORDS,"lacking in beauty of sound. On the contrary, any list of the most"
3008,THE POET'S WORDS,beautiful words in English would include many of them. But it is the
3009,THE POET'S WORDS,"meaning of these ""long-loop"" words, rather than their formal beauty alone,"
3010,THE POET'S WORDS,which fits them for the service of poetry. And they acquire in that
3011,THE POET'S WORDS,"service a ""literary"" value, which is subtly blended with their ""sound"""
3012,THE POET'S WORDS,"value and logical ""meaning"" value. They connote so much! They suggest more"
3013,THE POET'S WORDS,than they actually say. They unite the individual mood of the moment with
3014,THE POET'S WORDS,the soul of mankind.
3015,THE POET'S WORDS,
3016,THE POET'S WORDS,And there is still another mode of union between the individual and the
3017,THE POET'S WORDS,"race, which we must attempt in the next chapter to regard more closely,"
3018,THE POET'S WORDS,but which should be mentioned here in connection with the permanent
3019,THE POET'S WORDS,"embodiment of feeling in words,--namely, the mysterious fact of rhythm."
3020,THE POET'S WORDS,"Single words are born and die, we learn them and forget them, they alter"
3021,THE POET'S WORDS,"their meanings, they always say less than we really intend, they are"
3022,THE POET'S WORDS,imperfect instruments for signaling from one brain to another. Yet these
3023,THE POET'S WORDS,crumbling particles of speech may be miraculously held together and built
3024,THE POET'S WORDS,"into a tune, and with the tune comes another element of law, order,"
3025,THE POET'S WORDS,permanence. The instinct for the drumbeat lies deep down in our bodies; it
3026,THE POET'S WORDS,"affects our mental life, the organization of our emotions, and our"
3027,THE POET'S WORDS,response to the rhythmical arrangement of words. For mere ideas and words
3028,THE POET'S WORDS,"are not poetry, but only part of the material for poetry. A poem does not"

3049,MILTON,_1. The Nature of Rhythm_
3050,MILTON,
3051,MILTON,And why must the words begin to dance? The answer is to be perceived in
3052,MILTON,"the very nature of Rhythm, that old name for the ceaseless pulsing or"
3053,MILTON,"""flowing"" of all living things. So deep indeed lies the instinct for"
3054,MILTON,rhythm in our consciousness that we impute it even to inanimate objects.
3055,MILTON,"We hear the ticking of the clock as tíck-tock, tíck-tock, or else"
3056,MILTON,"tick-tóck, tick-tóck, although psychologists assure us that the clock's"
3057,MILTON,"wheels are moving with indifferent, mechanical precision, and that it is"
3058,MILTON,simply our own focusing of attention upon alternate beats which creates
3059,MILTON,"the impression of rhythm. We hear a rhythm in the wheels of the train, and"
3060,MILTON,"in the purring of the motor-engine, knowing all the while that it"
3061,MILTON,"is we who impose or make-up the rhythm, in our human instinct for"
3062,MILTON,"organizing the units of attention. We cannot help it, as long as our own"
3063,MILTON,pulses beat. No two persons catch quite the same rhythm in the sounds of
3064,MILTON,"the animate and inanimate world, because no two persons have absolutely"
3065,MILTON,"identical pulse-beats, identical powers of attention, an identical"
3066,MILTON,psycho-physical organism. We all perceive that there is a rhythm in a
3067,MILTON,"racing crew, in a perfectly timed stroke of golf, in a fisherman's fly-"
3068,MILTON,"casting, in a violinist's bow, in a close-hauled sailboat fighting with"
3069,MILTON,the wind. But we appropriate and organize these objective impressions in
3070,MILTON,subtly different ways.
3071,MILTON,
3072,MILTON,"When, for instance, we listen to poetry read aloud, or when we read it"
3073,MILTON,"aloud ourselves, some of us are instinctive ""timers,"""
3074,MILTON,"[Footnote: See W. M. Patterson, _The Rhythm of Prose_. Columbia University"
3075,MILTON,"Press, 1916.]"
3076,MILTON,"paying primary attention to the spaced or measured intervals of time,"
3077,MILTON,although in so doing we are not wholly regardless of those points of
3078,MILTON,"""stress"" which help to make the time-intervals plainer. Others of us are"
3079,MILTON,"natural ""stressers,"" in that we pay primary attention to the ""weight"" of"
3080,MILTON,"words,--the relative loudness or pitch, by which their meaning or"
3081,MILTON,"importance is indicated,--and it is only secondarily that we think of"
3082,MILTON,"these weighted or ""stressed"" words as separated from one another by"
3083,MILTON,approximately equal intervals of time. Standing on the rocks at Gloucester
3084,MILTON,"after an easterly storm, a typical ""timer"" might be chiefly conscious of"
3085,MILTON,"the steady sequence of the waves, the measured intervals between"
3086,MILTON,"their summits; while the typical stresser, although subconsciously aware"
3087,MILTON,"of the steady iteration of the giant rollers, might watch primarily their"
3088,MILTON,"foaming crests, and listen chiefly to their crashing thunder. The point to"
3089,MILTON,"be remembered is this: that neither the ""timing"" instinct nor the"
3090,MILTON,"""stressing"" instinct excludes the other, although in most individuals one"
3091,MILTON,"or the other predominates. Musicians, for instance, are apt to be"
3092,MILTON,"noticeable ""timers,"" while many scholars who deal habitually with words in"
3093,MILTON,"their varied shifts of meaning, are professionally inclined to be"
3094,MILTON,"""stressers."""

3097,MILTON,_2. The Measurement of Rhythm_
3098,MILTON,
3099,MILTON,Let us apply these facts to some of the more simple of the vexed questions
3100,MILTON,"of prosody, No one disputes the universality of the rhythmizing impulse;"
3101,MILTON,the quarrel begins as soon as any prosodist attempts to dogmatize about
3102,MILTON,the nature and measurement of those flowing time-intervals whose
3103,MILTON,"arrangement we call rhythm. No one disputes, again, that the only arbiter"
3104,MILTON,"in matters of prosody is the trained ear, and not the eye. Infinitely"
3105,MILTON,deceptive is the printed page of verse when regarded by the eye. Verse may
3106,MILTON,"be made to look like prose and prose to look like verse. Capital letters,"
3107,MILTON,"lines, rhymes, phrases and paragraphs may be so cunningly or"
3108,MILTON,conventionally arranged by the printer as to disguise the real nature of
3109,MILTON,"the rhythmical and metrical pattern. When in doubt, close your eyes!"
3110,MILTON,
3111,MILTON,"We agree, then, that in all spoken language--and this is as true of prose"
3112,MILTON,"as it is of verse--there are time-intervals more or less clearly marked,"
3113,MILTON,and that the ear is the final judge as to the nature of these intervals.
3114,MILTON,But can the ear really measure the intervals with any approximation to
3115,MILTON,"certainty, so that prosodists, for instance, can agree that a given poem"
3116,MILTON,"is written in a definite metre? In one sense ""yes."" No one doubts that the"
3117,MILTON,"_Odyssey_ is written in ""dactylic hexameters,"" i.e., in lines made up of"
3118,MILTON,"six ""feet,"" each one of which is normally composed of a long syllable plus"
3119,MILTON,"two short syllables, or of an acceptable equivalent for that particular"
3120,MILTON,combination. But when we are taught in school that Longfellow's
3121,MILTON,"_Evangeline_ is also written in ""dactylic hexameters,"" trouble begins for"
3122,MILTON,"the few inquisitive, since it is certain that if you close your eyes and"
3123,MILTON,"listen carefully to a dozen lines of Homer's Greek, and then to a"
3124,MILTON,"dozen lines of Longfellow's English, each written in so-called"
3125,MILTON,"""hexameters,"" you are listening to two very different arrangements of"
3126,MILTON,"time-intervals, so different, in fact, that the two poems are really not"
3127,MILTON,"in the same ""measure"" or ""metre"" at all. For the Greek poet was, as a"
3128,MILTON,"metrist, thinking primarily of quantity, of the relative ""timing"" of his"
3129,MILTON,"syllables, and the American of the relative ""stress"" of his syllables."
3130,MILTON,"[Footnote: ""Musically speaking--because the musical terms are exact and"
3131,MILTON,not ambiguous--true dactyls are in 2-4 time and the verse of _Evangeline_
3132,MILTON,"is in 3-8 time."" T. D. Goodell, _Nation_, October 12, 1911.]"
3133,MILTON,
3134,MILTON,"That illustration is drearily hackneyed, no doubt, but it has a double"
3135,MILTON,"value. It is perfectly clear; and furthermore, it serves to remind us of"
3136,MILTON,the instinctive differences between different persons and different races
3137,MILTON,as regards the ways of arranging time-intervals so as to create the
3138,MILTON,rhythms of verse. The individual's standard of measurement--his poetic
3139,MILTON,"foot-rule, so to speak--is very elastic,--""made of rubber"" indeed, as the"
3140,MILTON,experiments of many psychological laboratories have demonstrated beyond a
3141,MILTON,"question. Furthermore, the composers of poetry build it out of very"
3142,MILTON,elastic units. They are simply putting syllables of words together into a
3143,MILTON,"rhythmical design, and these ""airy syllables,"" in themselves mere symbols"
3144,MILTON,"of ideas and feelings, cannot be weighed by any absolutely correct"
3145,MILTON,sound-scales. They cannot be measured in time by any absolutely accurate
3146,MILTON,"watch-dial, or exactly estimated in their meaning, whether that be literal"
3147,MILTON,"or figurative, by any dictionary of words and phrases. But this is only"
3148,MILTON,"saying that the syllables which make up the units of verse, whether the"
3149,MILTON,"units be called ""foot"" or ""line"" or ""phrase,"" are not dead, mechanical"
3150,MILTON,"things, but live things, moving rhythmically, entering thereby into the"
3151,MILTON,"pulsing, chiming life of the real world, and taking on more fullness of"
3152,MILTON,"life and beauty in elastic movement, in ordered but infinitely flexible"
3153,MILTON,"design, than they ever could possess as independent particles."
3154,MILTON,
3155,MILTON,
3156,MILTON,_3. Conflict and Compromise_
3157,MILTON,
3158,MILTON,And everywhere in the arrangement of syllables into the patterns of rhythm
3159,MILTON,"and metre we find conflict and compromise, the surrender of some values of"
3160,MILTON,sound or sense for the sake of a greater unity. To revert to
3161,MILTON,"considerations dealt with in an earlier chapter, we touch here upon the"
3162,MILTON,"old antinomy--or it may be, harmony--between ""form"" and ""significance,"""
3163,MILTON,"between the ""outside"" and the ""inside"" of the work of art. For words,"
3164,MILTON,"surely, have one kind of value as _pure sound_, as ""cadences"" made up of"
3165,MILTON,"stresses, slides, pauses, and even of silences when the expected syllable"
3166,MILTON,"is artfully withheld. It is this sound-value, for instance, which you"
3167,MILTON,"perceive as you listen to a beautifully recited poem in Russian, a"
3168,MILTON,language of which you know not a single word; and you may experience a
3169,MILTON,modification of the same pleasure in closing your mind wholly to the
3170,MILTON,"""sense"" of a richly musical passage in Swinburne, and delighting your ear"
3171,MILTON,by its mere beauty of tone. But words have also that other value as
3172,MILTON,"_meaning_, and we are aware how these meaning values shift with the stress"
3173,MILTON,"and turns of thought, so that a given word has a greater or less weight in"
3174,MILTON,different sentences or even in different clauses of the same sentence.
3175,MILTON,"""Meaning"" values, like sound values, are never precisely fixed in a"
3176,MILTON,"mechanical and universally agreed-upon scale, they are relative, not"
3177,MILTON,"absolute. Sometimes meaning and sound conflict with one another, and one"
3178,MILTON,"must be sacrificed in part, as when the normal accent of a word"
3179,MILTON,"refuses to coincide with the verse-accent demanded by a certain measure,"
3180,MILTON,"so that we ""wrench"" the accent a trifle, or make it ""hover"" over two"
3181,MILTON,syllables without really alighting upon either. And it is significant that
3182,MILTON,lovers of poetry have always found pleasure in such compromises.
3183,MILTON,"[Footnote: Compare the passage about Chopin's piano-playing, quoted from"
3184,MILTON,Alden in the Notes and Illustrations for this chapter.]
3185,MILTON,"They enjoy minor departures from and returns to the normal, the expected"
3186,MILTON,"measure of both sound and sense, just as a man likes to sail a boat as"
3187,MILTON,"closely into the wind as he conveniently can, making his actual course a"
3188,MILTON,"compromise between the line as laid by the compass, and the actual facts"
3189,MILTON,of wind and tide and the behavior of his particular boat. It is thus that
3190,MILTON,"the sailor ""makes it,"" triumphantly! And the poet ""makes it"" likewise, out"
3191,MILTON,"of deep, strong-running tides of rhythmic impulse, out of arbitrary words"
3192,MILTON,"and rebellious moods, out of"
3193,MILTON,
3194,MILTON,"""Thoughts hardly to be packed"
3195,MILTON,"Into a narrow act,"
3196,MILTON,"Fancies that broke through language and escaped,"""
3197,MILTON,
3198,MILTON,"until he compels rhythm and syllables to move concordantly, and blend into"
3199,MILTON,"that larger living whole--the dancing, singing crowd of sounds and"
3200,MILTON,meanings which make up a poem.

3203,MILTON,_4. The Rhythms of Prose_
3204,MILTON,
3205,MILTON,Just here it may be of help to us to turn away for a moment from verse
3206,MILTON,"rhythm, and to consider what Dryden called ""the other harmony"" of prose."
3207,MILTON,"For no one doubts that prose has rhythm, as well as verse. Vast and"
3208,MILTON,learned treatises have been written on the prose rhythms of the Greeks and
3209,MILTON,"Romans, and Saintsbury's _History of English Prose Rhythm_ is a monumental"
3210,MILTON,"collection of wonderful prose passages in English, with the scansion of"
3211,MILTON,"""long"" and ""short"" syllables and of ""feet"" marked after a fashion that"
3212,MILTON,seems to please no one but the author. But in truth the task of inventing
3213,MILTON,"an adequate system for notating the rhythm of prose, and securing a"
3214,MILTON,"working agreement among prosodists as to a proper terminology, is almost"
3215,MILTON,insuperable. Those of us who sat in our youth at the feet of German
3216,MILTON,masters were taught that the distinction between verse and prose was
3217,MILTON,"simple: verse was, as the Greeks had called it, ""bound speech"" and prose"
3218,MILTON,"was ""loosened speech."" But a large proportion of the poetry published in"
3219,MILTON,"the last ten years is ""free verse,"" which is assuredly of a ""loosened"""
3220,MILTON,"rather than a ""bound"" pattern."
3221,MILTON,
3222,MILTON,"Apparently the old fence between prose and verse has been broken down. Or,"
3223,MILTON,if one conceives of indubitable prose and indubitable verse as forming two
3224,MILTON,"intersecting circles, there is a neutral zone,"
3225,MILTON,
3226,MILTON,[Illustration:   Prose  /  Neutral Zone  /  Verse]
3227,MILTON,
3228,MILTON,"which some would call ""prose poetry"" and some ""free verse,"" and which,"
3229,MILTON,according to the experiments of Dr. Patterson
3230,MILTON,"[Footnote: _The Rhythm of Prose_, already cited.]"
3231,MILTON,"may be appropriated as ""prose experience"" or ""verse experience"" according"
3232,MILTON,to the rhythmic instinct of each individual. Indeed Mr. T. S. Omond has
3233,MILTON,"admitted that ""the very same words, with the very same natural stresses,"
3234,MILTON,may be prose or verse according as we treat them. The difference is in
3235,MILTON,"ourselves, in the mental rhythm to which we unconsciously adjust the"
3236,MILTON,"words."""
3237,MILTON,"[Footnote: Quoted in B. M. Alden, ""The Mental Side of Metrical Form,"""
3238,MILTON,"_Modern Language Review_, July, 1914.]"
3239,MILTON,"Many familiar sentences from the English Bible or Prayer-Book, such as the"
3240,MILTON,"words from the _Te Deum_, ""We, therefore, pray thee, help thy servants,"
3241,MILTON,"whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood,"" have a rhythm which may"
3242,MILTON,"be felt as prose or verse, according to the mental habit or mood or"
3243,MILTON,rhythmizing impulse of the hearer.
3244,MILTON,
3245,MILTON,Nevertheless it remains true in general that the rhythms of prose are more
3246,MILTON,"constantly varied, broken and intricate than the rhythms of verse. They"
3247,MILTON,"are characterized, according to the interesting experiments of Dr."
3248,MILTON,"Patterson, by syncopated time,"
3249,MILTON,"[Footnote: ""For a 'timer' the definition of prose as distinguished from"
3250,MILTON,verse experience depends upon a predominance of syncopation over
3251,MILTON,coincidence in the coordination of the accented syllables of the text with
3252,MILTON,"the measuring pulses."" _Rhythm of Prose_, p. 22.]"
3253,MILTON,whereas in normal verse there is a fairly clean-cut coincidence between
3254,MILTON,the pulses of the hearer and the strokes of the rhythm. Every one seems to
3255,MILTON,agree that there is a certain danger in mixing these infinitely subtle and
3256,MILTON,"""syncopated"" tunes of prose with the easily recognized tunes of verse."
3257,MILTON,"There is, unquestionably, a natural ""iambic"" roll in English prose, due to"
3258,MILTON,the predominant alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables in our
3259,MILTON,"native tongue, but when Dickens--to cite what John Wesley would call ""an"
3260,MILTON,"eminent sinner"" in this respect--inserts in his emotional prose line after"
3261,MILTON,"line of five-stress ""iambic"" verse, we feel instinctively that the"
3262,MILTON,presence of the blank verse impairs the true harmony of the prose.
3263,MILTON,"[Footnote:  Observe, in the ""Notes and Illustrations"" for this chapter,"
3264,MILTON,"the frequency of the blank-verse lines in Robert G. Ingersoll's ""Address"
3265,MILTON,"over a Little Boy's Grave.""]"
3266,MILTON,Delicate writers of English prose usually avoid this coincidence of
3267,MILTON,"pattern with the more familiar patterns of verse, but it is impossible to"
3268,MILTON,"avoid it wholly, and some of the most beautiful cadences of English prose"
3269,MILTON,"might, if detached from their context, be scanned for a few syllables as"
3270,MILTON,"perfect verse. The free verse of Whitman, Henley and Matthew Arnold is"
3271,MILTON,"full of these embedded fragments of recognized ""tunes of verse,"" mingled"
3272,MILTON,with the unidentifiable tunes of prose. There has seldom been a more
3273,MILTON,curious example of accidental coincidence than in this sentence from a
3274,MILTON,"prosaic textbook on ""The Parallelogram of Forces"": ""And hence no force,"
3275,MILTON,"however great, can draw a cord, however fine, into a horizontal line which"
3276,MILTON,"shall be absolutely straight."" This is precisely the ""four-stressed"
3277,MILTON,"iambic"" metre of _In Memoriam_, and it even preserves the peculiar rhyme"
3278,MILTON,order of the _In Memoriam_ stanza:
3279,MILTON,
3280,MILTON,"""And hence no force, however great,"
3281,MILTON,"Can draw a cord, however fine,"
3282,MILTON,Into a horizontal line
3283,MILTON,"Which shall be absolutely straight."""
3284,MILTON,
3285,MILTON,"We shall consider more closely, in the section on Free Verse in the"
3286,MILTON,"following chapter, this question of the coincidence and variation of"
3287,MILTON,pattern as certain types of loosened verse pass in and out of the zone
3288,MILTON,which is commonly recognized as pure prose. But it is highly important
3289,MILTON,"here to remember another fact, which professional psychologists in their"
3290,MILTON,laboratory experiments with the notation of verse and prose have
3291,MILTON,"frequently forgotten, namely, the existence of a type of ornamented prose,"
3292,MILTON,which has had a marked historical influence upon the development of
3293,MILTON,"English style. This ornamented prose, elaborated by Greek and Roman"
3294,MILTON,"rhetoricians, and constantly apparent in the pages of Cicero, heightened"
3295,MILTON,"its rhythm by various devices of alliteration, assonance, tone-color,"
3296,MILTON,"cadence, phrase and period. Greek oratory even employed rhyme in highly"
3297,MILTON,"colored passages, precisely as Miss Amy Lowell uses rhyme in her"
3298,MILTON,"polyphonic or ""many-voiced"" prose. Medieval Latin took over all of these"
3299,MILTON,"devices from Classical Latin, and in its varied oratorical, liturgical and"
3300,MILTON,epistolary forms it strove to imitate the various modes of _cursus_
3301,MILTON,"(""running"") and _clausula_ (""cadence"") which had characterized the rhythms"
3302,MILTON,of Isocrates and Cicero.
3303,MILTON,"[Footnote: A. C. Clark, _Prose Rhythm in English_. Oxford, 1913."

3306,MILTON,"Oliver W. Elton, ""English Prose Numbers,"" in _Essays and Studies_ by"
3307,MILTON,"members of the English Association, 4th Series. Oxford, 1913.]"
3308,MILTON,"From the Medieval Latin Missal and Breviary these devices of prose rhythm,"
3309,MILTON,"particularly those affecting the end of sentences, were taken over into"
3310,MILTON,the Collects and other parts of the liturgy of the English Prayer-Book.
3311,MILTON,They had a constant influence upon the rhythms employed by the translators
3312,MILTON,"of the English Bible, and through the Bible the cadences of this ancient"
3313,MILTON,ornamented prose have passed over into the familiar but intricate
3314,MILTON,"harmonies of our ""heightened"" modern prose."
3315,MILTON,
3316,MILTON,"While this whole matter is too technical to be dealt with adequately here,"
3317,MILTON,it may serve at least to remind the reader that an appreciation of English
3318,MILTON,"prose rhythms, as they have been actually employed for many centuries,"
3319,MILTON,requires a sensitiveness to the rhetorical position of phrases and
3320,MILTON,"clauses, and to ""the use of sonorous words in the places of rhetorical"
3321,MILTON,"emphasis, which cannot be indicated by the bare symbols of prosody."""
3322,MILTON,"[Footnote: New York _Nation_, February 27, 1913.]"
3323,MILTON,For that sonority and cadence and balance which constitute a harmonious
3324,MILTON,prose sentence cannot be adequately felt by a possibly illiterate
3325,MILTON,"scientist in his laboratory for acoustics; the ""literary"" value of words,"
3326,MILTON,"in all strongly emotional prose, is inextricably mingled with the bare"
3327,MILTON,"sound values: it is thought-units that must be delicately ""balanced"" as"
3328,MILTON,well as stresses and slides and final clauses; it is the elevation of
3329,MILTON,"ideas, the nobility and beauty of feeling, as discerned by the trained"
3330,MILTON,"literary sense, which makes the final difference between enduring prose"
3331,MILTON,"harmonies and the mere tinkling of the ""musical glasses."""
3332,MILTON,"[Footnote: This point is suggestively discussed by C. E. Andrews,"
3333,MILTON,"_The Writing and Reading of Verse_, chap. 5. New York, 1918.]"
3334,MILTON,The student of verse may very profitably continue to exercise himself with
3335,MILTON,the rhythms of prose. He should learn to share the unwearied enthusiasm of
3336,MILTON,Professor Saintsbury for the splendid cadences of our sixteenth-century
3337,MILTON,"English, for the florid decorative period of Thomas Browne and Jeremy"
3338,MILTON,"Taylor, for the eloquent ""prose poetry"" of De Quincey and Ruskin and"
3339,MILTON,"Charles Kingsley, and for the strangely subtle effects wrought by Pater"
3340,MILTON,and Stevenson. But he must not imagine that any laboratory system of
3341,MILTON,"tapping syncopated time, or any painstaking marking of macrons (-) breves"
3342,MILTON,(u) and caesuras (||) will give him full initiation into the mysteries of
3343,MILTON,"prose cadences which have been built, not merely out of stressed and"
3344,MILTON,"unstressed syllables, but out of the passionate intellectual life of many"
3345,MILTON,generations of men. He may learn to feel that life as it pulsates in
3346,MILTON,"words, but no one has thus far devised an adequate scheme for its"
3347,MILTON,notation.
3348,MILTON,
3349,MILTON,
3350,MILTON,"_5. Quantity, Stress and Syllable_"
3351,MILTON,
3352,MILTON,"The notation of verse, however, while certainly not a wholly simple"
3353,MILTON,"matter, is far easier. It is practicable to indicate by conventional"
3354,MILTON,"printer's devices the general rhythmical and metrical scheme of a poem,"
3355,MILTON,"and to indicate the more obvious, at least, of its incidental variations"
3356,MILTON,from the expected pattern. It remains as true of verse as it is of prose
3357,MILTON,"that the ""literary"" values of words--their connotations or emotional"
3358,MILTON,overtones--are too subtle to be indicated by any marks invented by a
3359,MILTON,"printer; but the alternation or succession of long or short syllables, of"
3360,MILTON,"stressed or unstressed syllables, the nature of particular feet"
3361,MILTON,"and lines and stanzas, the order and interlacing of rhymes, and even the"
3362,MILTON,"devices of tone-color, are sufficiently external elements of verse to"
3363,MILTON,allow easy methods of indication.
3364,MILTON,
3365,MILTON,"When you and I first began to study Virgil and Horace, for instance, we"
3366,MILTON,"were taught that the Roman poets, imitating the Greeks, built heir verses"
3367,MILTON,"upon the principle of _Quantity_. The metrical unit was the foot, made up"
3368,MILTON,"of long and short syllables in various combinations, two short syllables"
3369,MILTON,being equivalent to one long one. The feet most commonly used were the
3370,MILTON,"Iambus [short-long], the Anapest [short-short-long], the Trochee"
3371,MILTON,"[long-short], the Dactyl [long-short-short], and the Spondee [long-long]."
3372,MILTON,"Then we were instructed that a ""verse"" or line consisting of one foot was"
3373,MILTON,"called a monometer, of two feet, a dimeter, of three, a trimeter, of four,"
3374,MILTON,"a tetrameter, of five, a pentameter, of six, a hexameter. This looked like"
3375,MILTON,"a fairly easy game, and before long we were marking the quantities in the"
3376,MILTON,"first line of the Aeneid, as other school-children had done ever since the"
3377,MILTON,time of St. Augustine:
3378,MILTON,
3379,MILTON,_Arma vi¦rumque ca¦no  Tro¦jae qui ¦ primus ab¦oris_.
3380,MILTON,
3381,MILTON,Or perhaps it was Horace's
3382,MILTON,
3383,MILTON,"_Maece¦nas, atavis ¦¦ edite reg¦ibus_."
3384,MILTON,
3385,MILTON,"We were told, of course, that it was not all quite as simple as this: that"
3386,MILTON,"there were frequent metrical variations, such as trochees changing places"
3387,MILTON,"with dactyls, and anapests with iambi; that feet could be inverted, so"
3388,MILTON,"that a trochaic line might begin with an iambus, an anapestic line with a"
3389,MILTON,"dactyl, or _vice versa_; that syllables might be omitted at the beginning"
3390,MILTON,"or the end or even in the middle of a line, and that this ""cutting-off"""
3391,MILTON,was called _catalexis_; that syllables might even be added at the
3392,MILTON,beginning or end of certain lines and that these syllables were called
3393,MILTON,"_hypermetric_; and that we must be very watchful about pauses,"
3394,MILTON,"particularly about a somewhat mysterious chief pause, liable to occur"
3395,MILTON,"about the middle of a line, called a _caesura_. But the magic password to"
3396,MILTON,admit us to this unknown world of Greek and Roman prosody was after all
3397,MILTON,the word _Quantity_.
3398,MILTON,
3399,MILTON,If a few of us were bold enough to ask the main difference between this
3400,MILTON,Roman system of versification and the system which governed modern English
3401,MILTON,poetry--even such rude playground verse as
3402,MILTON,
3403,MILTON,"""Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,"
3404,MILTON,"Catch a nigger by the toe""--"
3405,MILTON,
3406,MILTON,we were promptly told by the teacher that the difference was a very plain
3407,MILTON,"one, namely, that English, like all the Germanic languages, obeyed in its"
3408,MILTON,"verse the principles of _Stress_. Instead of looking for ""long"" and"
3409,MILTON,"""short"" syllables, we had merely to look for ""stressed"" and ""unstressed"""
3410,MILTON,"syllables. It was a matter, not of quantity, but of accent; and if we"
3411,MILTON,"remembered this fact, there was no harm but rather a great convenience, in"
3412,MILTON,retaining the technical names of classical versification. Only we must be
3413,MILTON,"careful that by ""iambus,"" in English poetry, we _meant_ an unstressed"
3414,MILTON,"syllable, rather than a short syllable followed by a long one. And so with"
3415,MILTON,"""trochee,"" ""dactyl,"" ""anapest"" and the rest; if we knew that accent and"
3416,MILTON,"not quantity was what we really had in mind, it was proper enough to speak"
3417,MILTON,"of _Paradise Lost_ as written in ""iambic pentameter,"" and _Evangeline_ in"
3418,MILTON,"""dactylic hexameter,"" etc. The trick was to count stresses and not"
3419,MILTON,"syllables, for was not Coleridge's _Christabel_ written in a metre which"
3420,MILTON,"varied its syllables anywhere from four to twelve for the line, yet"
3421,MILTON,maintained its music by regularity of stress?
3422,MILTON,
3423,MILTON,Nothing could be plainer than all this. Yet some of us discovered when we
3424,MILTON,went to college and listened to instructors who grew strangely excited
3425,MILTON,"over prosody, that it was not all as easy as this distinction between"
3426,MILTON,_Quantity_ and _Stress_ would seem to indicate. For we were now told that
3427,MILTON,the Greek and Roman habits of daily speech in prose had something to do
3428,MILTON,with their instinctive choice of verse-rhythms: that at the very time when
3429,MILTON,"the Greek heroic hexameters were being composed, there was a natural"
3430,MILTON,dactylic roll in spoken prose; that Roman daily speech had a stronger
3431,MILTON,"stress than Greek, so that Horace, in imitating Greek lyric measures, had"
3432,MILTON,stubborn natural word-accents to reconcile with his quantitative measures;
3433,MILTON,"that the Roman poets, who had originally allowed normal word-accent and"
3434,MILTON,"verse-pulse to coincide for the most part, came gradually to enjoy a"
3435,MILTON,"certain clash between them, keeping all the while the quantitative"
3436,MILTON,principle dominant; so that when Virgil and Horace read their verses
3437,MILTON,"aloud, and word-accent and verse-pulse fell upon different syllables, the"
3438,MILTON,"verse-pulse yielded slightly to the word-accent, thus adding something of"
3439,MILTON,the charm of conversational prose to the normal time-values of the rhythm.
3440,MILTON,"In a word, we were now taught--if I may quote from a personal letter of a"
3441,MILTON,"distinguished American Latinist--that ""the almost universal belief that"
3442,MILTON,Latin verse is a matter of quantity only is a mistake. Word-accent was not
3443,MILTON,"lost in Latin verse."""
3444,MILTON,
3445,MILTON,"And then, as if this undermining of our schoolboy faith in pure Quantity"
3446,MILTON,"were not enough, came the surprising information that the Romans had kept,"
3447,MILTON,"perhaps from the beginning of their poetizing, a popular type of accented"
3448,MILTON,"verse, as seen in the rude chant of the Roman legionaries,"
3449,MILTON,
3450,MILTON,_Mílle Fráncos mílle sémel Sármatás occídimús_.
3451,MILTON,"[Footnote: See C. M. Lewis, _Foreign Sources of Modern English"
3452,MILTON,"Versification_. Halle, 1898.]"
3453,MILTON,
3454,MILTON,"Certainly those sun-burnt ""doughboys"" were not bothering themselves"
3455,MILTON,"about trochees and iambi and such toys of cultivated ""literary"" persons;"
3456,MILTON,they were amusing themselves on the march by inventing words to fit the
3457,MILTON,"""goose-step."" Their"
3458,MILTON,
3459,MILTON,_Unus homo mille mille mille decollavimus_
3460,MILTON,
3461,MILTON,"which Professor Courthope scans as trochaic verse,"
3462,MILTON,"[Footnote: _History of English Poetry_, vol. 1, p. 73.]"
3463,MILTON,"seems to me nothing but ""stress"" verse, like"
3464,MILTON,
3465,MILTON,"_""Hay-foot, straw-foot, belly full of bean-soup--Hep--Hep!""_"
3466,MILTON,
3467,MILTON,"Popular accentual verse persisted, then, while the more cultivated Roman"
3468,MILTON,"public acquired and then gradually lost, in the course of centuries, its"
3469,MILTON,ear for the quantitative rhythms which originally had been copied from the
3470,MILTON,Greeks.
3471,MILTON,
3472,MILTON,"Furthermore, according to our ingenious college teachers, there was still"
3473,MILTON,"a third principle of versification to be reckoned with, not depending on"
3474,MILTON,"Quantity or Stress, but merely _Syllabic_, or syllable-counting. This was"
3475,MILTON,"immemorially old, it seemed, and it had reappeared mysteriously in Europe"
3476,MILTON,in the Dark Ages.
3477,MILTON,
3478,MILTON,Dr. Lewis cites from a Latin manuscript poem of the ninth century:
3479,MILTON,"[Footnote: _Foreign Sources_, etc., p. 3.]"
3480,MILTON,
3481,MILTON,"_""Beatissimus namque Dionysius ¦ Athenis quondam episcopus,"
3482,MILTON,Quem Sanctus Clemens direxit in Galliam ¦ propter praedicandi
3483,MILTON,"gratiam_,"" etc."
3484,MILTON,
3485,MILTON,"""Each verse contains 21 syllables, with a caesura after the 12th. No"
3486,MILTON,"further regularity, either metrical or rhythmical, can be perceived."
3487,MILTON,"Such a verse could probably not have been written except for music."""
3488,MILTON,"Church-music, apparently, was also a factor in the development of"
3489,MILTON,"versification,--particularly that ""Gregorian"" style which demanded neither"
3490,MILTON,"quantitative nor accentual rhythm, but simply a fair count of syllables in"
3491,MILTON,"the libretto, note matching syllable exactly. But when the great medieval"
3492,MILTON,"Latin hymns, like _Dies ire_, were written, the Syllabic principle of"
3493,MILTON,"versification, like the Quantitative principle, dropped out of sight,"
3494,MILTON,"and we witness once more the emergence of the Stress or accentual system,"
3495,MILTON,heavily ornamented with rhymes.
3496,MILTON,[Footnote: See the quotation from Taylor's _Classical Heritage of the
3497,MILTON,"Middle Ages_ printed in the ""Notes and Illustrations"" for this chapter.]"
3498,MILTON,"Yet the Syllabic method reappears once more, we were told, in French"
3499,MILTON,"prosody, and thus affects the verse of Chaucer and of subsequent English"
3500,MILTON,"poetry, and it still may be studied, isolated as far as may be from"
3501,MILTON,"considerations of quantity and stress, in certain English songs written"
3502,MILTON,"for music, where syllable carefully matches note. The ""long metre"""
3503,MILTON,"(8 syllables), ""short metre"" (6 syllables) and ""common metre"""
3504,MILTON,"(7 syllables, 6 syllables) of the hymn books is a convenient"
3505,MILTON,illustration of thinking of metre in terms of syllables alone.
3506,MILTON,
3507,MILTON,
3508,MILTON,_6. The Appeal to the Ear_
3509,MILTON,
3510,MILTON,"At this point, perhaps, having set forth the three theories of _Quantity,"
3511,MILTON,"Stress_ and _Syllable_, our instructors were sensible enough to make an"
3512,MILTON,appeal to the ear. Reminding us that stress was the controlling principle
3513,MILTON,"in Germanic poetry,--although not denying that considerations of quantity"
3514,MILTON,"and number of syllables might have something to do with the effect,--they"
3515,MILTON,read aloud to us some Old English verse. Perhaps it was that _Song of the
3516,MILTON,Battle of Brunanburh_ which Tennyson has so skilfully rendered into modern
3517,MILTON,"English words while preserving the Old English metre. And here, though the"
3518,MILTON,"Anglo-Saxon words were certainly uncouth, we caught the chief stresses"
3519,MILTON,"without difficulty, usually four beats to the line. If the instructor,"
3520,MILTON,"while these rude strokes of rhythm were still pounding in our ears,"
3521,MILTON,"followed the Old English with a dozen lines of Chaucer, we could all"
3522,MILTON,"perceive the presence of a newer, smoother, more highly elaborated"
3523,MILTON,"verse-music, where the number of syllables had been cunningly"
3524,MILTON,"reckoned, and the verse-accent seemed always to fall upon a syllable long"
3525,MILTON,"and strong enough to bear the weight easily, and the rhymes rippled like a"
3526,MILTON,brook. Whether we called the metre of the _Prologue_ rhymed couplets of
3527,MILTON,"iambic pentameter, or rhymed couplets of ten-syllabled, five-stressed"
3528,MILTON,"verse, the music, at least, was clear enough. And so was the music of the"
3529,MILTON,"""blank"" or unrhymed five-stress lines of Marlowe and Shakspere and Milton,"
3530,MILTON,"and as we listened it was easy to believe that ""stress"" and ""quantity"" and"
3531,MILTON,"""syllable,"" all playing together like a chime of bells, are concordant and"
3532,MILTON,"not quarrelsome elements in the harmony of modern English verse. Only, to"
3533,MILTON,"be richly concordant, each must be prepared to yield a little if need be,"
3534,MILTON,to the other!
3535,MILTON,
3536,MILTON,"I have taken too many pages, perhaps, in thus sketching the rudimentary"
3537,MILTON,"education of a college student in the elements of rhythm and metre, and in"
3538,MILTON,showing how the theoretical difficulties of the subject--which are
3539,MILTON,admittedly great--often disappear as soon as one resolves to let the ear
3540,MILTON,decide. A satisfied ear may soothe a dissatisfied mind. I have quoted from
3541,MILTON,"a letter of an American scholar about quantity being the ""controlling"""
3542,MILTON,"element of cultivated Roman verse, and I now quote from a personal letter"
3543,MILTON,"of an American poet, emphasizing the necessity of ""reading poetry as it"
3544,MILTON,"was meant to be read"": ""My point is _not_ that English verse has no"
3545,MILTON,"quantity, but that the controlling element is not quantity but accent. The"
3546,MILTON,lack of fixed _syllabic _quantity is just what I emphasize. This lack
3547,MILTON,makes definite _beat _impossible: or at least it makes it absurd to
3548,MILTON,attempt to scan English verse by feet. The proportion of 'irregularities'
3549,MILTON,and 'exceptions' becomes painful to the student and embarrassing to the
3550,MILTON,professor. He is put to fearful straits to explain his prosody and make it
3551,MILTON,"fit the verse. And when he has done all this, the student, if he has a"
3552,MILTON,"good ear, forthwith forgets it all, and reads the verse as it was meant to"
3553,MILTON,"be read, as a succession of musical bars (without pitch, of course), in"
3554,MILTON,"which the accent marks the rhythm, and pauses and _rests _often take the"
3555,MILTON,place of missing syllables. To this ingenuous student I hold out my hand
3556,MILTON,and cast in my lot with him. He is the man for whom English poetry is
3557,MILTON,"written."""
3558,MILTON,
3559,MILTON,"It may be objected, of course, that the phrase ""reading poetry as it was"
3560,MILTON,"meant to be read"" really begs the question. For English poets have often"
3561,MILTON,"amused themselves by composing purely quantitative verse, which they wish"
3562,MILTON,us to read as quantitative. The result may be as artificial as the
3563,MILTON,"painfully composed Latin quantitative verse of English schoolboys, but the"
3564,MILTON,"thing can be done. Tennyson's experiments in quantity are well known, and"
3565,MILTON,should be carefully studied. He was proud of his hexameter:
3566,MILTON,
3567,MILTON,"""High winds roaring above me, dark leaves falling about me,"""
3568,MILTON,
3569,MILTON,and of his pentameter:
3570,MILTON,
3571,MILTON,"""All men alike hate slops, particularly gruel."""
3572,MILTON,
3573,MILTON,"Here the English long and short syllables--as far as ""long"" and ""short"""
3574,MILTON,can be definitely distinguished in English--correspond precisely to the
3575,MILTON,"rules of Roman prosody. The present Laureate, Robert Bridges, whose"
3576,MILTON,"investigations in English and Roman prosody have been incessant, has"
3577,MILTON,recently published a book of experiments in writing English quantitative
3578,MILTON,hexameters.
3579,MILTON,"[Footnote: _Ibant Obscuri_. New York, Oxford University Press, 1917.]"
3580,MILTON,Here are half a dozen lines:
3581,MILTON,
3582,MILTON,"""Midway of all this tract, with secular arms an immense elm"
3583,MILTON,"Reareth a crowd of branches, aneath whose lofty protection"
3584,MILTON,"Vain dreams thickly nestle, clinging unto the foliage on high:"
3585,MILTON,And many strange creatures of monstrous form and features
3586,MILTON,"Stable about th' entrance, Centaur and Scylla's abortion,"
3587,MILTON,"And hundred-handed Briareus, and Lerna's wild beast...."""
3588,MILTON,
3589,MILTON,"These are lines interesting to the scholar, but they are somehow"
3590,MILTON,"""non-English"" in their rhythm--not in accordance with ""the genius of the"
3591,MILTON,"language,"" as we vaguely but very sensibly say. Neither did the stressed"
3592,MILTON,"""dactylic"" hexameters of Longfellow, written though they were by a skilful"
3593,MILTON,"versifier, quite conform to ""the nature of the language."""
3594,MILTON,
3595,MILTON,
3596,MILTON,_7. The Analogy with Music_
3597,MILTON,
3598,MILTON,One other attempt to explain the difficulties of English rhythm and metre
3599,MILTON,"must at least be mentioned here, namely the ""musical"" theory of the"
3600,MILTON,"American poet and musician, Sidney Lanier. In his _Science of English"
3601,MILTON,"Verse_, an acute and very suggestive book, he threw over the whole theory"
3602,MILTON,"of stress--or at least, retained it as a mere element of assistance, as in"
3603,MILTON,"music, to the marking of time, maintaining that the only necessary element"
3604,MILTON,"in rhythm is equal time-intervals, corresponding to bars of music."
3605,MILTON,"According to Lanier, the structure of English blank verse, for instance,"
3606,MILTON,"is not an alternation of unstressed with stressed syllables, but a series"
3607,MILTON,"of bars of 3/8 time, thus:"
3608,MILTON,
3609,MILTON,"[Illustration: Five bars of 3/8 time, each with a short and a long note.]"
3610,MILTON,
3611,MILTON,"Thomson, Dabney and other prosodists have followed Lanier's general"
3612,MILTON,"theory, without always agreeing with him as to whether blank verse is"
3613,MILTON,"written in 3/8 or 2/4 time. Alden, in a competent summary of these various"
3614,MILTON,"musical theories as to the basis of English verse,"
3615,MILTON,"[Footnote: _Introduction to Poetry_, pp. 190-93. See also Alden's _English"
3616,MILTON,"Verse_, Part 3. ""The Time-Element in English Verse.""]"
3617,MILTON,"quotes with approval Mr. T. S. Omond's words: ""Musical notes are almost"
3618,MILTON,"pure symbols. In theory at least, and no doubt substantially in practice,"
3619,MILTON,"they can be divided with mathematical accuracy--into fractions of 1/2,"
3620,MILTON,"1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc.--and the ideal of music is absolute accordance with"
3621,MILTON,time. Verse has other methods and another ideal. Its words are concrete
3622,MILTON,"things, not readily carved to such exact pattern.... The perfection of"
3623,MILTON,"music lies in absolute accordance with time, that of verse is continual"
3624,MILTON,slight departures from time. This is why no musical representations of
3625,MILTON,"verse ever seem satisfactory. They assume regularity where none exists."""
3626,MILTON,
3627,MILTON,
3628,MILTON,_8. Prosody and Enjoyment_
3629,MILTON,
3630,MILTON,"It must be expected then, that there will be different preferences in"
3631,MILTON,"choosing a nomenclature for modern English metres, based upon the"
3632,MILTON,"differences in the individual physical organism of various metrists, and"
3633,MILTON,"upon the strictness of their adherence to the significance of stress,"
3634,MILTON,quantity and number of syllables in the actual forms of verse. Adherents
3635,MILTON,of musical theories in the interpretation of verse may prefer to speak of
3636,MILTON,"""duple time"" instead of iambic-trochaic metres, and of ""triple"" time for"
3637,MILTON,"anapests and dactyls. Natural ""stressers"" may prefer to call iambic and"
3638,MILTON,"anapestic units ""rising"" feet, to indicate the ascent of stress as one"
3639,MILTON,"passes from the weaker to the stronger syllables; and similarly, to call"
3640,MILTON,"trochaic and dactylic units ""falling"" feet, to indicate the descent or"
3641,MILTON,decline of stress as the weaker syllable or syllables succeed the
3642,MILTON,"stronger. Or, combining these two modes of nomenclature, one may"
3643,MILTON,"legitimately speak of iambic feet as ""duple rising,"""
3644,MILTON,
3645,MILTON,"""And never lifted up a single stone"";"
3646,MILTON,
3647,MILTON,"trochaic as ""duple falling,"""
3648,MILTON,
3649,MILTON,"""Here they are, my fifty perfect poems"";"
3650,MILTON,
3651,MILTON,"anapestic as ""triple rising,"""
3652,MILTON,
3653,MILTON,"""But he lived with a lot of wild mates, and they never would let him be"
3654,MILTON,"good"";"
3655,MILTON,
3656,MILTON,"and dactylic as ""triple falling"";"
3657,MILTON,
3658,MILTON,"""Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them."""
3659,MILTON,
3660,MILTON,"If a line is felt as ""metrical,"" i.e. divided into approximately equal"
3661,MILTON,"time-intervals, the particular label employed to indicate the nature of"
3662,MILTON,the metre is unimportant. It may be left to the choice of each student of
3663,MILTON,"metre, provided he uses his terms consistently. The use of the traditional"
3664,MILTON,"terminology ""iambic,"" ""trochaic,"" etc., is convenient, and is open to no"
3665,MILTON,objection if one is careful to make clear the sense in which he employs
3666,MILTON,such ambiguous terms.
3667,MILTON,
3668,MILTON,"It should also be added, as a means of reconciling the apparently warring"
3669,MILTON,"claims of stress and quantity in English poetry, that recent"
3670,MILTON,investigations in recording through delicate instruments the actual
3671,MILTON,time-intervals used by different persons in reading aloud the same lines
3672,MILTON,"of poetry, prove what has long been suspected, namely, the close"
3673,MILTON,affiliation of quantity with stress.
3674,MILTON,"[Footnote: ""Syllabic Quantity in English Verse,"" by Ada F. Snell, _Pub. Of"
3675,MILTON,"Mod, Lang. Ass_., September, 1918.]"
3676,MILTON,Miss Snell's experiments show that the foot in English verse is made up of
3677,MILTON,"syllables 90 per cent of which are, in the stressed position, longer than"
3678,MILTON,"those in the unstressed. The average relation of short to long syllables,"
3679,MILTON,"is, in spite of a good deal of variation among the individual readers,"
3680,MILTON,almost precisely as 2 to 4--which has always been the accepted ratio for
3681,MILTON,the relation of short to long syllables in Greek and Roman verse. If one
3682,MILTON,"examines English words in a dictionary, the quantities of the syllables"
3683,MILTON,"are certainly not ""fixed"" as they are in Greek and Latin, but the moment"
3684,MILTON,"one begins to read a passage of English poetry aloud, and becomes"
3685,MILTON,"conscious of its underlying type of rhythm, he fits elastic units of"
3686,MILTON,"""feet"" into the steadily flowing or pulsing intervals of time."
3687,MILTON,"The ""foot"" becomes, as it were, a rubber link in a moving bicycle chain."
3688,MILTON,The revolutions of the chain mark the rhythm; and the stressed or
3689,MILTON,"unstressed or lightly stressed syllables in each ""link"" or foot,"
3690,MILTON,"accommodate themselves, by almost unperceived expansion and contraction,"
3691,MILTON,to the rhythmic beat of the passage as a whole.
3692,MILTON,
3693,MILTON,"Nor should it be forgotten that the ""sense"" of words, their"
3694,MILTON,"meaning-weight, their rhetorical value in certain phrases, constantly"
3695,MILTON,affects the theoretical number of stresses belonging to a given line. In
3696,MILTON,"blank verse, for instance, the theoretical five chief stresses are often"
3697,MILTON,"but three or four in actual practice, lighter stresses taking their place"
3698,MILTON,"in order to avoid a pounding monotony, and conversely, as in Milton's"
3699,MILTON,"famous line,"
3700,MILTON,
3701,MILTON,"""Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens, and shades of death,"""
3702,MILTON,
3703,MILTON,the rhetorical significance of the monosyllables compels an overloading of
3704,MILTON,stresses which heightens the desired poetic effect. Corson's _Primer of
3705,MILTON,English Verse_ and Mayor's _English Metres_ give numerous examples from
3706,MILTON,the blank verse of Milton and Tennyson to illustrate the constant
3707,MILTON,substitution and shifting of stresses in order to secure variety of music
3708,MILTON,and suggestive adaptations of sound to sense. It is well known that
3709,MILTON,"Shakspere's blank verse, as he developed in command of his artistic"
3710,MILTON,"resources, shows fewer ""end-stopped"" lines and more ""run-on"" lines, with"
3711,MILTON,an increasing proportion of light and weak endings. But the same principle
3712,MILTON,applies to every type of English rhythm. As soon as the dominant
3713,MILTON,"beat--which is commonly, but not always, apparent in the opening measures"
3714,MILTON,"of the poem--once asserts itself, the poet's mastery of technique is"
3715,MILTON,revealed through his skill in satisfying the ear with a verbal music which
3716,MILTON,"is never absolutely identical in its time-intervals, its stresses or its"
3717,MILTON,"pitch, with the fixed, wooden pattern of the rhythm he is using."
3718,MILTON,
3719,MILTON,"For the human voice utters syllables which vary their duration, stress and"
3720,MILTON,"pitch with each reader. Photographs of voice-waves, as printed by Verrier,"
3721,MILTON,"Scripture, and many other laboratory workers, show how great is the"
3722,MILTON,difference between individuals in the intervals covered by the upward and
3723,MILTON,"downward slides or ""inflections"" which indicate doubt or affirmation. And"
3724,MILTON,"these ""rising"" and ""falling"" and ""circumflex"" and ""suspended"" inflections,"
3725,MILTON,"which make up what is called ""pitch-accent,"" are constantly varied, like"
3726,MILTON,"the duration and stress of syllables, by the emotions evoked in reading."
3727,MILTON,"Words, phrases, lines and stanzas become colored with emotional overtones"
3728,MILTON,due to the feeling of the instant. Poetry read aloud as something sensuous
3729,MILTON,and passionate cannot possibly conform exactly to a set mechanical pattern
3730,MILTON,"of rhythm and metre. Yet the hand-woven Oriental rug, though lacking the"
3731,MILTON,"geometrical accuracy of a rug made by machinery, reveals a more vital and"
3732,MILTON,intimate beauty of design and execution. Many well-known poets--Tennyson
3733,MILTON,being perhaps the most familiar example--have read aloud their own verses
3734,MILTON,with a peculiar chanting sing-song which seemed to over-emphasize the
3735,MILTON,fundamental rhythm. But who shall correct them? And who is entitled to say
3736,MILTON,that a line like Swinburne's
3737,MILTON,
3738,MILTON,"""Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly forever asway"""
3739,MILTON,
3740,MILTON,"is irregular according to the foot-rule of traditional prosody, when it is"
3741,MILTON,"probable, as Mr. C. E. Russell maintains, that Swinburne was here"
3742,MILTON,composing in purely musical and not prosodical rhythm?
3743,MILTON,"[Footnote: ""Swinburne and Music,"" by Charles E. Russell, _North American"
3744,MILTON,"Review_, November, 1907. See the quotation in the ""Notes and"
3745,MILTON,"Illustrations"" for this chapter.]"
3746,MILTON,
3747,MILTON,"Is it not true, furthermore, as some metrical sceptics like to remind us,"
3748,MILTON,"that if we once admit the principle of substitution and equivalence, of"
3749,MILTON,"hypermetrical and truncated syllables, of pauses taking the place of"
3750,MILTON,"syllables, we can very often make one metre seem very much like another?"
3751,MILTON,"The question of calling a given group of lines ""iambic"" or ""trochaic,"" for"
3752,MILTON,"instance, can be made quite arbitrary, depending upon where you begin to"
3753,MILTON,"count syllables. ""Iambic"" with initial truncation or ""trochaic"" with final"
3754,MILTON,truncation? Tweedle-dum or tweedle-dee? Do you count waves from crest to
3755,MILTON,crest or from hollow to hollow? When you count the links in a bicycle
3756,MILTON,"chain, do you begin with the slender middle of each link or with one of"
3757,MILTON,"the swelling ends? So is it with this ""iambic"" and ""trochaic"" matter."
3758,MILTON,"Professor Alden, in a suggestive pamphlet,"
3759,MILTON,"[Footnote: ""The Mental Side of Metrical Form,"" already cited.]"
3760,MILTON,confesses that these contrasting concepts of rising and falling metre are
3761,MILTON,"nothing more than concepts, alterable at will."
3762,MILTON,
3763,MILTON,"But while the experts in prosody continue to differ and to dogmatize, the"
3764,MILTON,lover of poetry should remember that versification is far older than the
3765,MILTON,"science of prosody, and that the enjoyment of verse is, for millions of"
3766,MILTON,"human beings, as unaffected by theories of metrics as the stars are"
3767,MILTON,unaffected by the theories of astronomers. It is a satisfaction to the
3768,MILTON,"mind to know that the stars in their courses are amenable to law, even"
3769,MILTON,though one be so poor a mathematician as to be incapable of grasping and
3770,MILTON,"stating the law. The mathematics of music and of poetry, while heightening"
3771,MILTON,"the intellectual pleasure of those capable of comprehending it, is"
3772,MILTON,admittedly too difficult for the mass of men. But no lover of poetry
3773,MILTON,should refuse to go as far in theorizing as his ear will carry him. He
3774,MILTON,will find that his susceptibility to the pulsations of various types of
3775,MILTON,"rhythm, and his delight in the intricacies of metrical device, will be"
3776,MILTON,heightened by the mental effort of attention and analysis. The danger is
3777,MILTON,"that the lover of poetry, wearied by the quarrels of prosodists, and"
3778,MILTON,"forgetting the necessity of patience, compromise and freedom from"
3779,MILTON,"dogmatism, will lose his curiosity about the infinite variety of metrical"
3780,MILTON,"effects. But it is this very curiosity which makes his ear finer, even if"
3781,MILTON,his theories may be wrong. Hundreds of metricists admire and envy
3782,MILTON,Professor Saintsbury's ear for prose and verse rhythms while
3783,MILTON,"disagreeing wholly with his dogmatic theories of the ""foot,"" and his"
3784,MILTON,system of notation. There are sure to be some days and hours when the
3785,MILTON,reader of poetry will find himself bored and tired with the effort of
3786,MILTON,"attention to the technique of verse. Then he can stop analysing, close his"
3787,MILTON,"eyes, and drift out to sea upon the uncomprehended music."

3823,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3824,WILLIAM BLAKE,As we pass from the general consideration of Rhythm and Metre to some of
3825,WILLIAM BLAKE,"the special questions involved in Rhyme, Stanza and Free Verse, it may be"
3826,WILLIAM BLAKE,well to revert to the old distinction between what we called for
3827,WILLIAM BLAKE,"convenience the ""outside"" and the ""inside"" of a work of art. In the field"
3828,WILLIAM BLAKE,"of music we saw that this distinction is almost, if not quite,"
3829,WILLIAM BLAKE,"meaningless, and in poetry it ought not to be pushed too far. Yet it is"
3830,WILLIAM BLAKE,"useful in explaining the differences among men as they regard, now the"
3831,WILLIAM BLAKE,"external form of verse, and now its inner spirit, and as they ask"
3832,WILLIAM BLAKE,"themselves how these two elements are related. Professor Butcher, in his"
3833,WILLIAM BLAKE,"_Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art_,"
3834,WILLIAM BLAKE,[Footnote: Page 147.]
3835,WILLIAM BLAKE,"describes the natural tendencies of two sorts of men, who are quite as"
3836,WILLIAM BLAKE,persistent to-day as ever they were in Greece in looking at one side only
3837,WILLIAM BLAKE,of the question:
3838,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3839,WILLIAM BLAKE,"""We need not agree with a certain modern school who would empty all"
3840,WILLIAM BLAKE,poetry of poetical thought and etherealize it till it melts into a
3841,WILLIAM BLAKE,"strain of music; who sing to us we hardly know of what, but in such a"
3842,WILLIAM BLAKE,"way that the echoes of the real world, its men and women, its actual"
3843,WILLIAM BLAKE,"stir and conflict, are faint and hardly to be discerned. The poetry,"
3844,WILLIAM BLAKE,"we are told, resides not in the ideas conveyed, not in the blending"
3845,WILLIAM BLAKE,"of soul and sense, but in the sound itself, in the cadence of the"
3846,WILLIAM BLAKE,"verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it is not perhaps more false"
3847,WILLIAM BLAKE,than that other which wholly ignores the effect of musical sound and
3848,WILLIAM BLAKE,looks only to the thought that is conveyed. Aristotle comes
3849,WILLIAM BLAKE,"perilously near this doctrine."""
3850,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3851,WILLIAM BLAKE,But it is not Aristotle only who permits himself at times to undervalue
3852,WILLIAM BLAKE,"the formal element in verse. It is also Sir Philip Sidney, with his famous"
3853,WILLIAM BLAKE,"""verse being but an ornament and no cause to poetry"" and ""it is not riming"
3854,WILLIAM BLAKE,"and versing that maketh a poet."" It is Shelley with his ""The distinction"
3855,WILLIAM BLAKE,between poets and prose writers in a vulgar error.... Plato was
3856,WILLIAM BLAKE,"essentially a poet--the truth and splendor of his imagery, and the melody"
3857,WILLIAM BLAKE,"of his language, are the most intense that it is possible to conceive...."
3858,WILLIAM BLAKE,"Lord Bacon was a poet."" It is Coleridge with his ""The writings of Plato,"
3859,WILLIAM BLAKE,"and Bishop Taylor, and the _Theoria Sacra_ of Burnet, furnish undeniable"
3860,WILLIAM BLAKE,"proofs that poetry of the highest kind may be written without metre."""
3861,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3862,WILLIAM BLAKE,"In such passages as these, how generous are Sidney, Shelley, and Coleridge"
3863,WILLIAM BLAKE,"to the prose-men! And yet these same poet-critics, in dozens of other"
3864,WILLIAM BLAKE,"passages, have explained the fundamental justification of metre, rhyme and"
3865,WILLIAM BLAKE,"stanza as elements in the harmony of verse. Harmony may be attained, it is"
3866,WILLIAM BLAKE,"true, by rhythms too complicated to be easily scanned in metrical feet,"
3867,WILLIAM BLAKE,"and by measures which disregard rhyme and stanza; and poets, as well as"
3868,WILLIAM BLAKE,"critics, by giving exclusive attention to a single element in harmony, are"
3869,WILLIAM BLAKE,able to persuade themselves for the moment that all other elements are
3870,WILLIAM BLAKE,"relatively negligible. Milton, in his zeal for blank verse, attacked"
3871,WILLIAM BLAKE,"rhyme, in which he had already proved himself a master, quite as fiercely"
3872,WILLIAM BLAKE,"as any of our contemporary champions of free verse. Campion, a trained"
3873,WILLIAM BLAKE,"musician, argued for a quantitative system of English prosody during the"
3874,WILLIAM BLAKE,"very period when he was composing, in the accentual system, some of the"
3875,WILLIAM BLAKE,"most exquisite songs in the language. Daniel, whose _Defense of Rhyme_"
3876,WILLIAM BLAKE,"(1603) was a triumphant reply to Campion's theory, gave courteous"
3877,WILLIAM BLAKE,"praise to his opponent's practice. Dryden, most flexible-minded of"
3878,WILLIAM BLAKE,"critics, argues now for, and now against the use of rhymed heroic couplets"
3879,WILLIAM BLAKE,"in the drama, fitting his theories to the changing currents of"
3880,WILLIAM BLAKE,"contemporary taste as well as to the varying, self-determined technique of"
3881,WILLIAM BLAKE,"his own plays. ""Never wholly out of the way, nor in it,"" was Dryden's"
3882,WILLIAM BLAKE,"happy phrase to describe the artist's freedom, a freedom always conscious"
3883,WILLIAM BLAKE,of underlying law.

3887,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3888,WILLIAM BLAKE,"However theory and practice may happen to coincide or to drift apart, the"
3889,WILLIAM BLAKE,fundamental law which justifies rhyme and stanza seems to be this: if
3890,WILLIAM BLAKE,"rhythm is a primary fact in poetry, and metre is, as Aristotle called it,"
3891,WILLIAM BLAKE,"sections of rhythm, any device of repeating identical or nearly identical"
3892,WILLIAM BLAKE,sounds at measured intervals is an aid to rhythmical effect. Rhyme is thus
3893,WILLIAM BLAKE,"a form, an ""externalizing"" of rhythm. It is structural as well as"
3894,WILLIAM BLAKE,"decorative, or rather, it is _one way_ of securing structure, of building"
3895,WILLIAM BLAKE,"verse. There are other devices, of course, for attaining symmetrical"
3896,WILLIAM BLAKE,"patterns, for conveying an impression of unity in variety. The ""parallel"""

3904,WILLIAM BLAKE,"phrase or idea is repeated at the close, after the insertion of"
3905,WILLIAM BLAKE,"illustrative matter, thus securing a pattern by the ""return"" of the main"
3906,WILLIAM BLAKE,"idea--the closing of the ""curve""--may serve to illustrate the universality"
3907,WILLIAM BLAKE,of the principle of balance and contrast and repetition in the
3908,WILLIAM BLAKE,"architecture of verse. For Hebrew poetry, like the poetry of many"

3953,WILLIAM BLAKE,"""dead and done with,"" ""to have and to hold,"" and it is utilized in modern"
3954,WILLIAM BLAKE,verse to give further emphasis to accentual syllables. But masters of
3955,WILLIAM BLAKE,"alliterative effects, like Keats, Tennyson and Verlaine, constantly employ"
3956,WILLIAM BLAKE,alliteration in unaccented syllables so as to color the tone-quality of a
3957,WILLIAM BLAKE,line without a too obvious assault upon the ear. The unrhymed songs of
3958,WILLIAM BLAKE,_The Princess_ are full of these delicate modulations of sound.
3959,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3960,WILLIAM BLAKE,"In Common rhyme, or ""end-rhyme"" (found--abound), the accented vowel and"
3961,WILLIAM BLAKE,"all succeeding sounds are repeated, while the consonants preceding the"
3962,WILLIAM BLAKE,"accented vowel vary. Assonance, in its stricter sense, means the"
3963,WILLIAM BLAKE,"repetition of an accented vowel (blackness--dances), while the succeeding"
3964,WILLIAM BLAKE,"sounds vary, but the terms ""assonance"" and ""consonance"" are often employed"
3965,WILLIAM BLAKE,loosely to signify harmonious effects of tone-color within a line or group
3966,WILLIAM BLAKE,"of lines. Complete or ""identical"" rhymes (fair--affair), which were"
3967,WILLIAM BLAKE,"legitimate in Chaucer's time, are not now considered admissible in"
3968,WILLIAM BLAKE,"English. ""Masculine"" rhymes are end-rhymes of one syllable; ""feminine"""
3969,WILLIAM BLAKE,rhymes are end-rhymes of two syllables (uncertain--curtain); internal or
3970,WILLIAM BLAKE,"""middle-rhymes"" are produced by the repetition at the end of a line of a"

3994,WILLIAM BLAKE,
3995,WILLIAM BLAKE,If all the various forms of rhyme are only different ways of emphasizing
3996,WILLIAM BLAKE,"rhythm through the repetition of accordant sounds, it follows that the"
3997,WILLIAM BLAKE,varying rhythmical impulses of poets and of readers will demand now a
3998,WILLIAM BLAKE,greater and now a less dependence upon this particular mode of rhythmical
3999,WILLIAM BLAKE,satisfaction. Chaucer complained of the scarcity of rhymes in English as
4000,WILLIAM BLAKE,"compared with their affluence in Old French, and it is true that rhyming"
4001,WILLIAM BLAKE,is harder in our tongue than in the Romance languages. We have had
4002,WILLIAM BLAKE,"magicians of rhyme, like Swinburne, whose very profusion of rhyme-sounds"
4003,WILLIAM BLAKE,"ends by cloying the taste of many a reader, and sending him back to blank"
4004,WILLIAM BLAKE,"verse or on to free verse. The Spenserian stanza, which calls for one"
4005,WILLIAM BLAKE,"fourfold set of rhymes, one threefold, and one double, all cunningly"
4006,WILLIAM BLAKE,"interlaced, is as complicated a piece of rhyme-harmony as the ear of"
4007,WILLIAM BLAKE,the average lover of poetry can carry. It is needless to say that there
4008,WILLIAM BLAKE,"are born rhymers, who think in rhyme and whose fecundity of imagery is"
4009,WILLIAM BLAKE,multiplied by the excitement of matching sound with sound. They are often
4010,WILLIAM BLAKE,"careless in their prodigality, inexact in their swift catching at any"

4177,II,corresponding to the units of ideas; and when ideas are organized by
4178,II,"emotion, there are waves, gusts, or ripples of words, matching the waves"
4179,II,"of feeling. In the ideal poetic ""pattern,"" these waves of idea, feeling"
4180,II,and rhythmic speech would coincide more or less completely; we should have
4181,II,"a union of ""emotional law"" with ""stanzaic law,"" the soul of poetry would"
4182,II,find its perfect embodiment.
4183,II,
4184,II,"But if we turn the pages of any collection of English poetry, say the"
4185,II,"_Golden Treasury_ or the _Oxford Book of English Verse_, we find something"
4186,II,very different from this ideal embodiment of each poetic emotion in a form
4187,II,delicately moulded to the particular species of emotion revealed. We
4188,II,discover that precisely similar stanzaic patterns--like similar metrical
4189,II,"patterns--are often used to express diametrically opposite feelings,--let"
4190,II,"us say, joy and sorrow, doubt and exultation, victory and defeat. The"
4191,II,"""common metre"" of English hymnology is thus seen to be a rough mould into"
4192,II,"which almost any kind of religious emotion may be poured. If ""trochaic"""
4193,II,"measures do not always trip it on a light fantastic toe, neither do"
4194,II,"""iambic"" measures always pace sedately. Doubtless there is a certain"
4195,II,"general fitness, in various stanza forms, for this or that poetic purpose:"
4196,II,the stanzas employed by English or Scotch balladry are admittedly
4197,II,excellent for story-telling; Spenser's favorite stanza is unrivalled
4198,II,"for painting dream-pictures and rendering dream-music, but less available"
4199,II,"for pure narration; Chaucer's seven-line stanza, so delicately balanced"
4200,II,"upon that fourth, pivotal line, can paint a picture and tell a story too;"
4201,II,"Byron's _ottava rima_ has a devil-may-care jauntiness, borrowed, it is"
4202,II,"true, from his Italian models, but perfectly fitted to Byron's own mood;"
4203,II,"the rhymed couplets of Pope sting and glitter like his antitheses, and the"
4204,II,"couplets of Dryden have their ""resonance like a great bronze coin thrown"
4205,II,"down on marble""; each great artist in English verse, in short, chooses by"
4206,II,"instinct the general stanza form best suited to his particular purpose,"
4207,II,and then moulds its details with whatever cunning he may possess. But the
4208,II,"significant point is this: ""stanzaic law"" makes for uniformity, for the"
4209,II,"endless repetition of the chosen pattern, which must still be recognized"
4210,II,"as a pattern, however subtly the artist modulates his details; and in"
4211,II,"adjusting the infinitely varied material of thought and feeling, phrase"
4212,II,"and image, picture and story to the fixed stanzaic design, there are bound"
4213,II,"to be gaps and patches, stretchings and foldings of the thought-stuff,--"
4214,II,"for even as in humble tailor-craft, this many-colored coat of poetry must"
4215,II,be cut according to the cloth as well as according to the pattern. How
4216,II,many pages of even the _Oxford Book of English Verse_ are free from some
4217,II,"touch of feebleness, of redundancy, of constraint due to the remorseless"
4218,II,"requirements of the stanza? The line must be filled out, whether or not"
4219,II,"the thought is quite full enough for it; rhyme must match rhyme, even if"
4220,II,"the thought becomes as far-fetched as the rhyming word; the stanza, in"
4221,II,"short, demands one kind of perfection as a constantly repeated musical"
4222,II,"design, as beauty of form; and another kind of perfection as the"
4223,II,"expression of human emotion. Sometimes these two perfections of ""form"" and"
4224,II,"""significance"" are miraculously wedded, stanza after stanza, and we have"
4225,II,"our ""Ode to a Nightingale,"" or ""Ode to Autumn"" as the result. (And perhaps"
4226,II,"the best, even in this kind, are but shadows, when compared with the"
4227,II,absolute union of truth and beauty as the poetic idea first took rhythmic
4228,II,form in the brain of the poet.)
4229,II,
4230,II,"Yet more often lovers of poetry must content themselves, not with such"
4231,II,"""dictates of nature"" as these poems, but with approximations. Each"
4232,II,"stanzaic form has its conveniences, its ""fatal facility,"" its natural"
4233,II,fitness for singing a song or telling a story or turning a thought over
4234,II,and over into music. Intellectual readers will always like the
4235,II,"epigrammatic ""snap"" of the couplet, and Spenser will remain, largely"
4236,II,"because of his choice of stanza, the ""poet's poet."" Perhaps"
4237,II,the very necessity of fitting rhymes together stimulates as much poetic
4238,II,activity as it discourages; for many poets have testified that the delight
4239,II,"of rhyming adds energy to the imagination. If, as Shelley said, ""the mind"
4240,II,"in creation is as a fading coal, which some invisible influence, like an"
4241,II,"inconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness,"" why may it not be the"
4242,II,"breath of rhyme, as well as any other form of rhythmic energy, which"
4243,II,"quickens its drooping flame? And few poets, furthermore, will admit that"
4244,II,they are really in bondage to their stanzas. They love to dance in these
4245,II,"fetters, and even when wearing the same fetters as another poet, they"
4246,II,"nevertheless invent movements of their own, so that Mr. Masefield's"
4247,II,"""Chaucerian"" stanzas are really not so much Chaucer's as Masefield's."
4248,II,
4249,II,"Each Ulysses makes and bends his own bow, after all; it is only the"
4250,II,unsuccessful suitors for the honors of poetic craftsmanship who complain
4251,II,of its difficulties. Something of our contemporary impatience with fixed
4252,II,stanzaic forms is due perhaps to the failure to recognize that the greater
4253,II,poets succeed in making over every kind of poetic pattern in the act of
4254,II,"employing it, just as a Chopin minuet differs from a Liszt minuet,"
4255,II,although both composers are using the same fundamental form of dance
4256,II,"music. We must allow for the infinite variety of creative intention,"
4257,II,technique and result. The true defence of rhyme and stanza against the
4258,II,arguments of extreme advocates of free verse is to point out that
4259,II,rhyme and stanza are natural structural devices for securing certain
4260,II,effects. There are various types of bridges for crossing different kinds
4261,II,of streams; no one type of bridge is always and everywhere the best. To do
4262,II,away with rhyme and stanza is to renounce some modes of poetic beauty; it
4263,II,is to resolve that there shall be one less way of crossing the stream. An
4264,II,advocate of freedom in the arts may well admit that the artist may bridge
4265,II,"his particular stream in any way he can,--or he may ford it or swim it or"
4266,II,go over in an airplane if he chooses. But some method must be found of
4267,II,"getting his ideas and emotions ""across"" into the mind and feelings of the"
4268,II,readers of his poetry. If this can adequately be accomplished without
4269,II,"recourse to rhyme and stanza, very well; there is _Paradise Lost_, for"
4270,II,"instance, and _Hamlet_. But here we are driven back again upon the"
4271,II,countless varieties of artistic intention and craftsmanship and effect.
4272,II,Each method--and there are as many methods as there are poets and far
4273,II,"more, for craftsmen like Milton and Tennyson try hundreds of methods in"
4274,II,their time--is only a medium through which the artist is endeavoring to
4275,II,"attain a special result. It is one way--only one, and perhaps not the best"
4276,II,way--of trying to cross the stream.

4279,II,_4. Free Verse_
4280,II,
4281,II,Recalling now the discussion of the rhythms of prose in the previous
4282,II,"chapter, and remembering that rhyme and stanza are special forms of"
4283,II,"reinforcing the impulse of rhythm, what shall be said of free verse? It"
4284,II,"belongs, unquestionably, in that ""neutral zone"" which some readers, in Dr."
4285,II,"Patterson's phrase, instinctively appropriate as ""prose experience,"" and"
4286,II,"others as ""verse experience."" It renounces metre--or rather endeavors to"
4287,II,"renounce it, for it does not always succeed. It professes to do away with"
4288,II,"rhyme and stanza, although it may play cunningly upon the sounds of like"
4289,II,"and unlike words, and it may arrange phrases into poetic paragraphs,"
4290,II,"which, aided by the art of typography, secure a kind of stanzaic effect."
4291,II,"It cannot, however, do away with the element of rhythm, with ordered time."
4292,II,"The moment free verse ceases to be felt as rhythmical, it ceases to be"
4293,II,felt as poetry. This is admitted by its advocates and its opponents
4294,II,"alike. The real question at issue then, is the manner in which free verse"
4295,II,"may secure the effects of rhythmic unity and variety, without, on the one"
4296,II,"hand, resorting to the obvious rhythms of prose, or on the other hand,"
4297,II,without repeating the recognized patterns of verse. There are many
4298,II,"competent critics who maintain with Edith Wyatt that ""on an earth where"
4299,II,"there is nothing to wear but clothes, nothing to eat but food, there is"
4300,II,"also nothing to read but prose and poetry."" ""According to the results of"
4301,II,"our experiments,"" testifies Dr. Patterson, ""there is no psychological"
4302,II,"meaning to claims for a third _genre_ between regular verse and prose,"
4303,II,except in the sense of a jumping back and forth from one side of the fence
4304,II,"to the other."""
4305,II,"[Footnote: _The Rhythm of Prose_, p. 77.]"
4306,II,"And in the preface to his second edition, after having listened to Miss"
4307,II,"Amy Lowell's readings of free verse, Dr. Patterson remarks: ""What is"
4308,II,"achieved, as a rule, in Miss Lowell's case, is emotional prose,"
4309,II,"emphatically phrased, excellent and moving. _Spaced prose_, we may call"
4310,II,"it."""
4311,II,
4312,II,"Now ""spaced prose"" is a useful expression, inasmuch as it calls attention"
4313,II,to the careful emphasis and balance of phrases which up so much of the
4314,II,"rhetorical structure of free verse, and it also serves to remind us of the"
4315,II,"part which typography plays in ""spacing"" these phrases, and stressing for"
4316,II,"the eye their curves and ""returns."" But we are all agreed that"
4317,II,typographical appeals to the eye are infinitely deceptive in blurring the
4318,II,"distinction between verse and prose, and that the trained ear must be the"
4319,II,only arbiter as to poetical and pseudo-poetical effects. Ask a lover of
4320,II,"Walt Whitman whether ""spaced prose"" is the right label for ""Out of the"
4321,II,"Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"" and he will scoff at you. He will maintain that"
4322,II,"following the example of the rich broken rhythms of the English Bible, the"
4323,II,"example of Ossian, Blake, and many another European experimenter during"
4324,II,"the Romantic epoch, Whitman really succeeded in elaborating a mode of"
4325,II,"poetical expression, nearer for the most part to recitative than to"
4326,II,"aria, yet neither pure declamation nor pure song: a unique embodiment of"
4327,II,"passionate feeling, a veritable ""neutral zone,"" which refuses to let"
4328,II,"itself be annexed to either ""prose"" or ""verse"" as those terms are"
4329,II,"ordinarily understood, but for which ""free verse"" is precisely the right"
4330,II,expression. _Leaves of Grass_ (1855) remains the most interesting of all
4331,II,"experiments with free verse, written as it was by an artist whose natural"
4332,II,"rhythmical endowment was extraordinary, and whose technical curiosity and"
4333,II,patience in modulating his tonal effects was unwearied by failures and
4334,II,"undiscouraged by popular neglect. But the case for free verse does not,"
4335,II,"after all, stand or fall with Walt Whitman. His was merely the most"
4336,II,powerful poetic personality among the countless artificers who have
4337,II,endeavored to produce rhythmic and tonal beauty through new structural
4338,II,devices.
4339,II,
4340,II,Readers who are familiar with the experiments of contemporary poets will
4341,II,"easily recognize four prevalent types of ""free verse"":"
4342,II,
4343,II,"(a) Sometimes what is printed as ""free verse"" is nothing but prose"
4344,II,"disguised by the art of typography, i.e. judged by the ear, it is made up"
4345,II,wholly of the rhythms of prose.
4346,II,
4347,II,"(b) Sometimes the prose rhythms predominate, without excluding a mixture"
4348,II,of the recognized rhythms of verse.
4349,II,

4351,II,allowed to appear here and there.
4352,II,

4354,II,new combinations which disguise or break up the metrical pattern.

4401,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"statement. It also reproduces the neat, polished, perhaps epigrammatic"

4615,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,_5. Discovery and Rediscovery_
4616,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,
4617,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,It is not pretended that the four types of free verse which have been
4618,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,illustrated are marked by clear-cut generic differences. They shade into
4619,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,one another. But they are all based upon a common sensitiveness to the
4620,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"effects of rhythmic prose, a common restlessness under what is felt to be"
4621,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"the restraint of metre and rhyme, and a common endeavor to break down the"
4622,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,conventional barrier which separates the characteristic beauty of prose
4623,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,speech from the characteristic beauty of verse. In this endeavor to
4624,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"obliterate boundary lines, to secure in one art the effects hitherto"
4625,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"supposed to be the peculiar property of another, free verse is only one"
4626,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"more evidence of the widespread ""confusion of the genres"" which marks"
4627,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"contemporary artistic effort. It is possible, with the classicists, to"
4628,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,condemn outright this blurring of values.
4629,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"[Footnote: See, for instance, Irving Babbitt, _The New Laokoon_. Houghton"
4630,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"Mifflin Company, 1910.]"
4631,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"One may legitimately maintain, with Edith Wyatt, that the traditional"
4632,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,methods of English verse are to the true artist not oppressions but
4633,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"liberations. She calls it ""a fallacious idea that all individual and all"
4634,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,realistic expression in poetry is annulled by the presence of distinctive
4635,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"musical discernment, by the movement of rhyme with its keen heightening of"
4636,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"the impulse of rhythm, by the word-shadows of assonance, by harmonies,"
4637,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"overtones and the still beat of ordered time, subconsciously perceived but"
4638,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"precise as the sense of the symphony leader's flying baton. To readers, to"
4639,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,writers for whom the tonal quality of every language is an intrinsic value
4640,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"these faculties of poetry serve not at all as cramping oppressions, but as"
4641,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"great liberations for the communication of truth."""
4642,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"[Footnote: _New Republic_, August 24, 1918.]"
4643,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,But many practitioners of free verse would reply that this is not a matter
4644,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"for theorizing, but of individual preference, and that in their endeavor"
4645,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"to communicate new modes of feeling, new aspects of beauty, they have a"
4646,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"right to the use of new forms, even if those new forms be compounded out"
4647,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,of the wreck of old ones. This argument for freedom of experiment is
4648,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,unanswerable; the true test of its validity lies in the results secured.
4649,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,That free verse has now and then succeeded in creating lovely flowering
4650,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,hybrids seems to me as indubitable as the magical tricks which Mr. Burbank
4651,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,has played with flowers and fruits. But the smiling Dame Nature sets her
4652,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"inexorable limits to ""Burbanking""; she allows it to go about so far, and"
4653,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"no farther. Freakish free verse, like freakish plants and animals, gets"
4654,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"punished by sterility. Some of the ""imagist"" verse patterns are uniquely"
4655,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,and intricately beautiful. Wrought in a medium which is neither wholly
4656,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"verse nor wholly prose, but which borrows some of the beauty peculiar to"
4657,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"each art, they are their own excuse for being. And nevertheless they may"
4658,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"not prove fertile. It may be that they have been produced by ""pushing a"
4659,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"medium farther than it will go."""
4660,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,
4661,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"It must be admitted, furthermore, that a great deal of contemporary free"
4662,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,verse has been written by persons with an obviously incomplete command
4663,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"over the resources of expression. Max Eastman has called it ""Lazy Verse,"""
4664,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"the product of ""aboriginal indolence""; and he adds this significant"
4665,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"distinction, ""In all arts it is the tendency of those who are ungrown to"
4666,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,confuse the expression of intense feeling with the intense expression of
4667,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"feeling--which last is all the world will long listen to."" Shakspere,"
4668,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"Milton, Keats are masters of concentrated, intensest expression: their"
4669,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"verse, at its best, is structural as an oak. Those of us who have read"
4670,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"with keen momentary enjoyment thousands of pages of the ""New Verse,"""
4671,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,are frequently surprised to find how little of it stamps itself upon the
4672,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"memory. Intense feeling has gone into these formless forms, very"
4673,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"certainly, but the medium soaks up the feeling like blotting-paper. In"
4674,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"order to live, poetry must be plastic, a stark embodiment of emotion, and"
4675,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,not a solution of emotion.
4676,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,
4677,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"That fragile, transient fashions of expression have their own evanescent"
4678,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,type of beauty no one who knows the history of Euphuism will deny. And
4679,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"much of the New Verse is Euphuistic, not merely in its self-conscious"
4680,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"cleverness, its delightful toying with words and phrases for their own"
4681,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"sake, its search of novel cadences and curves, but also in its naive"
4682,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,pleasure in rediscovering and parodying what the ancients had discovered
4683,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"long before. ""Polyphonic prose,"" for instance, as announced and"
4684,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"illustrated by Mr. Paul Fort and Miss Amy Lowell, is prose that"
4685,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"makes use of all the ""voices"" of poetry,--viz. metre, _vers libre_,"
4686,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"assonances, alliteration, rhyme and return. ""Metrical verse,"" says Miss"
4687,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"Lowell in the Preface to _Can Grande's Castle_, ""has one set of laws,"
4688,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,cadenced verse another; 'polyphonic prose' can go from one to the other in
4689,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,the same poem with no sense of incongruity.... I finally decided to base
4690,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"my form upon the long, flowing cadence of oratorical prose. The variations"
4691,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,permitted to this cadence enable the poet to change the more readily into
4692,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"those of _vers libre_, or even to take the regular beat of metre, should"
4693,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,such a marked time seem advisable.... Rhyme is employed to give a richness
4694,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"of effect, to heighten the musical feeling of a passage, but ... the"
4695,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,rhymes should seldom come at the ends of the cadences.... Return in
4696,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,'polyphonic prose' is usually achieved by the recurrence of a dominant
4697,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"thought or image, coming in irregularly and in varying words, but still"
4698,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,giving the spherical effect which I have frequently spoken of as
4699,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"imperative in all poetry."""
4700,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,
4701,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,Now every one of these devices is at least as old as Isocrates. It was in
4702,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,this very fashion that Euphues and his Friends delighted to serve and
4703,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,return their choicest tennis balls of Elizabethan phrase. But little De
4704,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,Quincey could pull out the various stops of polyphonic prose even more
4705,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,cleverly than John Lyly; and if one will read the admirable description of
4706,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"St. Mark's in _Can Grandels Castle_, and then re-read Ruskin's"
4707,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"description of St. Mark's, he will find that the Victorian's orchestration"
4708,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,of many-voiced prose does not suffer by comparison.
4709,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,
4710,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"Yet though it is true enough of the arts, as Chaucer wrote suavely long"
4711,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"ago, that ""There nys no newe thing that is not olde,"" we must remember"
4712,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,that the arts are always profiting by their naive rediscoveries. It is
4713,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,more important that the thing should seem new than that it should really
4714,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"be new, and the fresh sense of untried possibilities, the feeling that"
4715,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,"much land remains to be possessed, has given our contemporaries the"

4717,ADD SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY,antiquaries can trace on old maps the very rivers and harbors which the

4776,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4777,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Passing over the question of the historical origins of those various
4778,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"species of poetry, such as the relation of early hymnic songs and"
4779,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"hero-songs to the epic, and the relation of narrative material and method"
4780,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"to the drama, let us try to arrange in some sort of order the kinds of"
4781,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"poetry with which we are familiar. Suppose we follow Watts-Dunton's hint,"
4782,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and start, as if it were from a central point, with the Pure Lyric, the"
4783,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"expression of the Ego in song. Shelley's ""Stanzas Written in Dejection"
4784,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"near Naples,"" Coleridge's ""Ode to Dejection,"" Wordsworth's ""She dwelt"
4785,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"among the untrodden ways,"" Tennyson's ""Break--Break"" will serve for"
4786,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"illustrations. These are subjective, personal poems. Their vision"
4787,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"is ""relative"" to the poet's actual circumstances. Yet in a ""dramatic"
4788,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"lyric"" like Byron's ""Isles of Greece"" or Tennyson's ""Sir Galahad"" it is"
4789,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"clear that the poet's vision is not occupied primarily with himself, but"
4790,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"with another person. In a dramatic monologue like Tennyson's ""Simeon"
4791,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Stylites"" or Browning's ""The Bishop orders his Tomb in St. Praxed's"
4792,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Church"" it is not Tennyson and Browning themselves who are talking, but"
4793,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"imaginary persons viewed objectively, as far as Tennyson and Browning were"
4794,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"capable of such objectivity. The next step would be the Drama, preoccupied"
4795,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"with characters in action--the ""world of men,"" in short, and not the"
4796,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,personal subjective world of the highly sensitized lyric poet.
4797,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4798,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Let us now move away from that pure lyric centre in another direction. In
4799,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"a traditional ballad like ""Sir Patrick Spens,"" a modern ballad like"
4800,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Tennyson's ""The Revenge,"" or Coleridge's ""Ancient Mariner,"" is not the"

4802,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"of the circle of his own subjective emotion? In modern epic verse, like"
4803,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Tennyson's ""Morte d'Arthur,"" Arnold's ""Sohrab and Rustum,"" Morris's"
4804,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Sigurd the Volsung,"" and certainly in the ""Aeneid"" and the ""Song of"
4805,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Roland,"" the poet sinks his own personality, as far as possible, in the"
4806,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"objective narration of events. And in like manner, the poet may turn from"
4807,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the world of action to the world of repose, and portray Nature as"
4808,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"enfolding and subduing the human element in his picture. In Keats's ""Ode"
4809,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"to Autumn,"" Shelley's ""Autumn,"" in Wordsworth's ""Solitary Reaper,"""
4810,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Browning's ""Where the Mayne Glideth,"" we find poets absorbed in the"

4814,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,unquiet spirits. They cannot keep themselves wholly out of the story they
4815,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,are telling or the picture they are painting; and it is for this reason
4816,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"that we speak of ""lyrical"" passages even in the great objective dramas,"
4817,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,passages colored with the passionate personal feelings of the poet. For he
4818,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"cannot be wholly ""absolute"" even if he tries: he will invent favorite"
4819,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,characters and make them the mouthpiece of his own fancies: he will devise
4820,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"favorite situations, and use them to reveal his moral judgment of men and"

4824,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,_2. Definitions_
4825,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4826,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"While we must recognize, then, that the meaning of the word ""lyrical"" has"
4827,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"been broadened so as to imply, frequently, a quality of poetry rather than"
4828,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"a mere form of poetry, let us go back for a moment to the original"
4829,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"significance of the word. Derived from ""lyre,"" it meant first a song"
4830,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"written for musical accompaniment, say an ode of Pindar; then a poem whose"
4831,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"form suggests this original musical accompaniment; then, more loosely, a"
4832,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"poem which has the quality of music, and finally, purely personal poetry."
4833,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"[Footnote: See the definitions in John Erskine's _Elizabethan Lyric_, E."

4840,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"with the poet, his thoughts, his emotions, his moods, and his passions...."
4841,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"With the lyric subjective poetry begins,"" says Professor Schelling. ""The"
4842,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,characteristic of the lyric is that it is the product of the pure poetic
4843,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"energy unassociated with other energies,"" says Mr. Drinkwater. These are"
4844,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"typical recent definitions. Francis T. Palgrave, in the Preface to the"
4845,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"_Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics_, while omitting to stress"
4846,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the elements of musical quality and of personal emotion, gives a working"
4847,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,rule for anthologists which has proved highly useful. He held the term
4848,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""lyrical"" ""to imply that each poem shall turn on a single thought, feeling"
4849,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"or situation."" The critic Scherer also gave an admirable practical"

4857,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,_3. General Characteristics_
4858,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4859,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"But the lyric, however it may be defined, has certain general"
4860,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"characteristics which are indubitable. The lyric ""vision,"" that is to say,"
4861,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the experience, thought, emotion which gives its peculiar quality to lyric"
4862,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"verse, making it ""simple, sensuous, passionate"" beyond other species of"
4863,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"poetry, is always marked by freshness, by egoism, and by genuineness."
4864,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4865,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"To the lyric poet all must seem new; each sunrise ""_herrlich wie am ersten"
4866,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Tag._"" ""Thou know'st 'tis common,"" says Hamlet's mother, speaking of his"
4867,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"father's death, ""Why seems it so particular with thee?"" But to men of the"
4868,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"lyrical temperament everything is ""particular."" Age does not alter their"
4869,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"exquisite sense of the novelty of experience. Tennyson's lines on ""Early"
4870,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Spring,"" written at seventy-four, Browning's ""Never the Time and the"
4871,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Place"" written at seventy-two, Goethe's love-lyrics written when he was"
4872,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"eighty, have all the delicate bloom of adolescence. Sometimes this"
4873,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,freshness seems due in part to the poet's early place in the development
4874,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"of his national literature: he has had, as it were, the first chance at"
4875,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"his particular subject. There were countless springs, of course, before a"
4876,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"nameless poet, about 1250, wrote one of the first English lyrics for which"
4877,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,we have a contemporary musical score:
4878,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4879,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Sumer is icumen in,"
4880,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Lhude sing cuccu."""
4881,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4882,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"But the words thrill the reader, even now, as he hears in fancy that"
4883,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"cuckoo's song,"
4884,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4885,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Breaking the silence of the seas"
4886,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Beyond the farthest Hebrides."""
4887,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4888,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Or, the lyric poet may have the luck to write at a period when settled,"
4889,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,stilted forms of poetical expression are suddenly done away with. Perhaps
4890,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"he may have helped in the emancipation, like Wordsworth and Coleridge in"
4891,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the English Romantic Revival, or Victor Hugo in the France of 1830. The"
4892,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,new sense of the poetic possibilities of language reacts upon the
4893,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"imaginative vision itself. Free verse, in our own time, has profited by"
4894,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"this rejuvenation of the poetic vocabulary, by new phrases and cadences to"
4895,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,match new moods. Sometimes an unwonted philosophical insight makes all
4896,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,things new to the poet who possesses it. Thus Emerson's vision of the
4897,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Eternal Unity,"" or Browning's conception of Immortality, afford the very"
4898,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"stuff out of which poetry may be wrought. Every new experience, in short,"
4899,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"like falling in love, like having a child, like getting ""converted,"""
4900,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"[Footnote: See William James, _The Varieties of Religious Experience_.]"
4901,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,gives the lyric poet this rapturous sense of living in a world hitherto
4902,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"unrealized. The old truisms of the race become suddenly ""particular"" to"
4903,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"him. ""As for man, his days are as grass. As a flower of the field, so he"
4904,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"flourisheth."" That was first a ""lyric cry"" out of the depths of some fresh"
4905,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"individual experience. It has become stale through repetition, but many a"
4906,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"man, listening to those words read at the burial of a friend, has seemed,"
4907,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"in his passionate sense of loss, to hear them for the first time."
4908,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4909,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Egoism is another mark of the lyric poet. ""Of every poet of this class,"""
4910,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"remarks Watts-Dunton, ""it may be said that his mind to him 'a kingdom is,'"
4911,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and that the smaller the poet the bigger to him is that kingdom."" He"
4912,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,celebrates himself. Contemporary lyrists have left no variety of physical
4913,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,sensation unnoted: they tell us precisely how they feel and look when they
4914,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"take their morning tub. Far from avoiding that ""pathetic fallacy"" which"
4915,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Ruskin analysed in a famous chapter,"
4916,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"[Footnote: _Modern Painters_, vol. 3, chap. 12.]"
4917,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,and which attributes to the external world qualities which belong only to
4918,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the mind itself, they revel in it. ""Day, like our souls, is _fiercely"
4919,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"dark_,"" sang Elliott, the Corn-Law Rhymer. Hamlet, it will be remembered,"
4920,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"could be lyrical enough upon occasion, but he retained the power of"
4921,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,distinguishing between things as they actually were and things as they
4922,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"appeared to him in his weakness and his melancholy. ""This goodly frame,"
4923,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the earth, seems _to me_ a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,"
4924,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof"
4925,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing _to me_ than a"
4926,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man!
4927,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty!... And yet, _to me_,"
4928,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"what is this quintessence of dust?"""
4929,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4930,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Nevertheless this lyric egoism has certain moods in which the individual
4931,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,identifies himself with his family or tribe:
4932,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4933,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""O Keith of Ravelstone,"
4934,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"The sorrows of thy line!"""
4935,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4936,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"School and college songs are often, in reality, tribal lyrics. The"
4937,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,choruses of Greek tragedies dealing with the guilt and punishment of a
4938,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"family, the Hebrew lyrics chanting, like ""The Song of Deborah,"" the"
4939,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"fortunes of a great fight, often broaden their sympathies so as to"
4940,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"include, as in ""The Persians"" of Aeschylus, the glory or the downfall of a"
4941,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,race. And this sense of identification with a nation or race implies no
4942,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"loss, but often an amplification of the lyric impulse. Alfred Noyes's"
4943,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"songs about the English, D'Annunzio's and Hugo's splendid chants of the"
4944,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Latin races, Kipling's glorification of the White Man, lose nothing of"
4945,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,their lyric quality because of their nationalistic or racial inspiration.
4946,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Read Wilfrid Blunt's sonnet on ""Gibraltar"" (_Oxford Book of Verse_,"

4954,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"To see her red coats marching from the hill!"""
4955,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4956,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Are patriotic lyrics of this militant type destined to disappear, as"

4958,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"barriers of nationality, or rather with the coming of"

4961,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Lifting mankind again"""
4962,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4963,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,over the barriers of nationality? Certainly there is already a type of
4964,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"purely humanitarian, altruistic lyric, where the poet instinctively thinks"
4965,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"in terms of ""us men"" rather than of ""I myself."" It appeared long ago in"
4966,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"that rebellious ""Titanic"" verse which took the side of oppressed mortals"
4967,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"as against the unjust gods. Tennyson's ""Lotos-Eaters"" is a modern echo of"
4968,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"this defiant or despairing cry of the ""ill-used race of men."" The songs of"
4969,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Burns reveal ever-widening circles of sympathy,--pure personal egoism,"
4970,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"then songs of the family and of clan and of country-side, then passion for"
4971,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Scotland, and finally this fierce peasant affection for his own passes"

4995,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,_4. The Objects of the Lyric Vision_
4996,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
4997,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Let us look more closely at some of the objects of the lyric vision; the
4998,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"sources or material, that is to say, for the lyric emotion. Goethe's"
4999,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"often-quoted classification is as convenient as any: the poet's vision, he"
5000,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"says, may be directed upon Nature, Man or God."
5001,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5002,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"And first, then, upon Nature. One characteristic of lyric poetry is the"
5003,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,clearness with which single details or isolated objects in Nature may be
5004,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"visualized and reproduced. The modern reflective lyric, it is true, often"
5005,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,depends for its power upon some philosophical generalization from a single
5006,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"instance, like Emerson's ""Rhodora"" or Wordsworth's ""Small Celandine."" It"
5007,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,may even attempt a sort of logical or pseudo-logical deduction from given
5008,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"premises, like Browning's famous"
5009,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5010,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Morning's at seven;"
5011,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The hillside's dew-pearled;
5012,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The lark's on the wing:
5013,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The snail's on the thorn;
5014,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,God's in his Heaven--
5015,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"_All's right with the world!_"""
5016,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5017,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The imagination cannot be denied this right to synthesize and to
5018,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"interpret, and nevertheless Nature offers even to the most unphilosophical"
5019,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,her endless profusion of objects that awaken delight. She does not insist
5020,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,that the lyric poet should generalize unless he pleases. Moth and snail
5021,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and skylark, daisy and field-mouse and water-fowl, seized by an eye that"
5022,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"is quick to their poetic values, their interest to men, furnish material"
5023,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,enough for lyric feeling. The fondness of Romantic poets for isolating a
5024,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,single object has been matched in our day by the success of the Imagists
5025,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,in painting a single aspect of some phenomenon--
5026,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5027,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Light as the shadow of the fish"
5028,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"That falls through the pale green water--"""
5029,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5030,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"any aspect, in short, provided it affords the ""romantic quiver,"" the"
5031,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"quick, keen sense of the beauty in things. What an art-critic said of the"
5032,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,painter W. M. Chase applies equally well to many contemporary Imagists who
5033,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"use the forms of lyric verse: ""He saw the world as a display of beautiful"
5034,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,surfaces which challenged his skill. It was enough to set him painting to
5035,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"note the nacreous skin of a fish, or the satiny bloom of fruit, or the"
5036,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"wind-smoothed dunes about Shinnecock, or the fine specific olive of a"
5037,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"woman's face.... He took objects quite at their face value, and rarely"
5038,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"invested them with the tenderness, mystery and understanding that comes"
5039,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"from meditation and remembered feelings.... We get in him a fine, bare"
5040,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"vision, and must not expect therewith much contributary enrichment from"
5041,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"mind and mood."""
5042,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"[Footnote: _The Nation_, November 2, 1916.]"
5043,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Our point is that this ""fine, bare vision"" is often enough for a lyric. It"
5044,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"has no time for epic breadth of detail, for the rich accumulation of"
5045,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"harmonious images which marks Arnold's ""Sohrab and Rustum"" or Keats's ""Eve"
5046,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"of St. Agnes."""
5047,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5048,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The English Romantic poets were troubled about the incursion of scientific
5049,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,fact into the poet's view of nature. The awful rainbow in heaven might be
5050,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"turned, they thought, through the curse of scientific knowledge, into the"
5051,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""dull catalogue of common things."" But Wordsworth was wiser than this. He"
5052,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"saw that if the scientific fact were emotionalized, it could still serve"
5053,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,as the stuff of poetry. Facts could be transformed into truths. No aspect
5054,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,of Tennyson's lyricism is more interesting than his constant employment of
5055,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the newest scientific knowledge of his day, for instance, in geology,"
5056,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,chemistry and astronomy. He set his facts to music. Eugene Lee-Hamilton's
5057,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,poignant sonnet about immortality is an illustration of the ease with
5058,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"which a lyric poet may find material in scientific fact, if appropriated"
5059,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,and made rich by feeling.
5060,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"[Footnote: Quoted in chap. VIII, section 7.]"
5061,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5062,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"If lyric poetry shows everywhere this tendency to humanize its ""bare"
5063,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"vision"" of Nature, it is also clear that the lyric, as the most highly"
5064,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"personalized species of poetry, exhibits an infinite variety of visions of"
5065,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"human life. Any anthology will illustrate the range of observation, the"
5066,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"complexity of situations and desires, the constant changes in key, as the"
5067,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,lyric attempts to interpret this or that aspect of human emotion. Take for
5068,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"example, the Elizabethan love-lyric. Here is a single human passion,"
5069,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,expressing itself in the moods and lyric forms of one brief generation of
5070,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"our literature. Yet what variety of personal accent, what kaleidoscopic"
5071,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"shiftings of mind and imagination, what range of lyric beauty! Or take the"
5072,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"passion for the wider interests of Humanity, expressed in the lyrics of"
5073,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Schiller and Burns, running deep and turbid through Revolutionary"
5074,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and Romantic verse, and still coloring--perhaps now more strongly than"
5075,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,ever--the stream of twentieth-century poetry. Here is a type of lyric
5076,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"emotion where self-consciousness is lost, absorbed in the wider"
5077,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"consciousness of kinship, in the dawning recognition of the oneness of the"
5078,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,blood and fate of all nations of the earth.
5079,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5080,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The purest type of lyric vision is indicated in the third word of Goethe's
5081,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,triad. It is the vision of God. Here no physical fact intrudes or mars.
5082,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Here thought, if it be complete thought, is wholly emotionalized. Such"
5083,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"transcendent vision, as in the Hebrew lyrists and in Dante, is itself"
5084,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"worship, and the lyric cry of the most consummate artist among English"
5085,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,poets of the last generation is simply an echo of the ancient voices:
5086,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5087,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Hallowed be Thy Name--Hallelujah!"""
5088,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5089,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"If Tennyson could not phrase anew the ineffable, it is no wonder that most"
5090,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,hymn-writers fail. They are trying to express in conventionalized
5091,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"religious terminology and in ""long and short metre"" what can with"
5092,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"difficulty be expressed at all, and if at all, by the unconscious art of"
5093,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the Psalms or by a sustained metaphor, like ""Crossing the Bar"" or the"
5094,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Recessional."" The medieval Latin hymns clothed their transcendent themes,"
5095,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"their passionate emotions, in the language of imperial Rome. The modern"
5096,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"sectaries succeed best in their hymnology when they choose simple ideas,"
5097,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"not too definite in content, and clothe them, as Whittier did, in words of"
5098,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"tender human association, in parables of longing and of consolation."

5101,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,_5. The Lyric Imagination_
5102,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5103,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"The material thus furnished by the lyric poet's experience, thought and"
5104,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,emotion is reshaped by an imagination working simply and spontaneously.
5105,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"The lyrist is born and not made, and he cannot help transforming the"

5153,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The verbal felicity and richness of fancy that characterized the

5156,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"plunge. In the familiar song from _The Tempest_, for example, we have in"

5193,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"discussed in an earlier chapter, we may assert that there are certain"
5194,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,general laws of lyric form. One of them is the law of brevity. It is
5195,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,impossible to keep the lyric pitch for very long. The rapture turns to
5196,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"pain. ""I need scarcely observe,"" writes Poe in his essay on ""The Poetic"
5197,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Principle,"" ""that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites,"
5198,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this
5199,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychical"
5200,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle"
5201,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a"
5202,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the"
5203,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is, in"
5204,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"effect, and in fact, no longer such."""
5205,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5206,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"In another passage, from the essay on ""Hawthorne's 'Twice-Told Tales,'"""
5207,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Poe emphasizes this law of brevity in connection with the law of unity of
5208,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,impression. It is one of the classic passages of American literary
5209,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,criticism:
5210,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5211,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Were we bidden to say how the highest genius could be most"
5212,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"advantageously employed for the best display of its own powers, we"
5213,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"should answer, without hesitation--in the composition of a rhymed poem,"
5214,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,not to exceed in length what might be perused in an hour. Within this
5215,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,limit alone can the highest order of true poetry exist. We need only
5216,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"here say, upon this topic, that, in almost all classes of composition,"
5217,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,the unity of effect or impression is a point of the greatest importance.
5218,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"It is clear, moreover, that this unity cannot be thoroughly preserved in"
5219,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,productions whose perusal cannot be completed at one sitting. We may
5220,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"continue the reading of a prose composition, from the very nature of"
5221,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"prose itself, much longer than we can preserve, to any good purpose, in"
5222,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the perusal of a poem. This latter, if truly fulfilling the demands of"
5223,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"the poetic sentiment, induces an exaltation of the soul which cannot be"
5224,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,long sustained. All high excitements are necessarily transient. Thus a
5225,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"long poem is a paradox. And, without unity of impression, the deepest"
5226,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,effects cannot be brought about. Epics were the offspring of an
5227,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"imperfect sense of Art, and their reign is no more. A poem _too_ brief"
5228,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"may produce a vivid, but never an intense or enduring impression."

5231,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,

5242,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and only stuck on a diamond (borrowed from her sister) here and there,"

5246,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5247,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,It is evident that the laws of brevity and unity cannot be disassociated.
5248,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The unity of emotion which characterizes the successful lyric corresponds
5249,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"to the unity of action in the drama, and to the unity of effect in the"
5250,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,short story. It is this fact which Palgrave stressed in his emphasis upon
5251,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""some single thought, feeling, or situation."" The sonnets, for instance,"
5252,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,that most nearly approach perfection are those dominated by one thought.
5253,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"This thought may be turned over, indeed, as the octave passes into the"
5254,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"sextet, and may be viewed from another angle, or applied in an unexpected"
5255,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"way. And yet the content of a sonnet, considered as a whole, must be as"
5256,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,integral as the sonnet's form. So must it be with any song. The various
5257,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"devices of rhyme, stanza and refrain help to bind into oneness of form a"
5258,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,single emotional reflection of some situation or desire.
5259,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5260,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Watts-Dunton points out that there is also a law of simplicity of
5261,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,grammatical structure which the lyric disregards at its peril. Browning
5262,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"and Shelley, to mention no lesser names, often marred the effectiveness of"
5263,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,their lyrics by a lack of perspicuity. If the lyric cry is not easily
5264,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"intelligible, the sympathy of the listener is not won. Riddle-poems have"
5265,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"been loved by the English ever since Anglo-Saxon times, but the"
5266,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,intellectual satisfaction of solving a puzzle may be purchased at the cost
5267,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"of true poetic pleasure. Let us quote Gray once more, for he had an"

5270,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5271,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"""Extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous, and musical,"

5365,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"Let the reader choose at random a dozen lyrics from the _Golden Treasury_,"
5366,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,and see how far this orderly arrangement of the thought-stuff of the lyric
5367,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,is approximated in practice. My own impression is that the critic
5368,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"postulates more of an ""intellectual element"" than the average English song"
5369,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,will supply. But at least here is a clear-cut statement of what one may
5370,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,look for in a lyric. It shows how the lyric impulse tends to mould lyric
5371,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,expression into certain lines of order.
5372,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,
5373,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Most of the narrower precepts governing lyric form follow from the general
5374,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"principles already discussed. The lyric vocabulary, every one admits,"
5375,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"should not seem studied or consciously ornate, for that breaks the law of"
5376,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"spontaneity. It may indeed be highly finished, the more highly in"
5377,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"proportion to its brevity, but the clever word-juggling of such"
5378,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,prestidigitators as Poe and Verlaine is perilous. Figurative language must
5379,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"spring only from living, figurative thought, otherwise the lyric falls"
5380,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"into verbal conceits, frigidity, conventionality. Stanzaic law must follow"
5381,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"emotional law, just as Kreisler's accompanist must keep time with"
5382,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,Kreisler. All the rich devices of rhyme and tone-color must heighten
5383,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,and not cloy the singing quality. But why lengthen this list of truisms?
5384,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,The combination of genuine lyric emotion with expertness of technical
5385,THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY,"expression is in reality very rare. Goethe's ""Ueber alien Gipfeln ist Ruh"""

5407,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"drama, i.e. song, story and play, have obviously different functions to"
5408,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,perform. They may indeed deal with a common fund of material. A given
5409,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"event, say the settlement of Virginia, or the episode of Pocahontas,"
5410,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,provides situations and emotions which may take either lyric or narrative
5411,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"or dramatic shape. The mental habits and technical experience of the poet,"
5412,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"or the prevalent literary fashions of his day, may determine which general"
5413,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"type of poetry he will employ. There were born lyrists, like Greene in the"
5414,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Elizabethan period, who wrote plays because the public demanded drama, and"
5415,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"there have been natural dramatists who were compelled, in a period when"
5416,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the theatre fell into disrepute, to give their material a narrative form."
5417,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,But we must also take into account the dominant mood or quality of certain
5418,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"poetic minds. Many passages in narrative and dramatic verse, for instance,"
5419,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,while fulfilling their primary function of telling a story or throwing
5420,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"characters into action, are colored by what we have called the lyric"
5421,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"quality, by that passionate, personal feeling whose natural mode of"
5422,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"expression is in song. In Marlowe's _Tamburlaine_, for instance, or Victor"
5423,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Hugo's _Hernani_, there are superb pieces of lyric declamation, in which"
5424,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,we feel that Marlowe and Hugo themselves--not the imaginary Tamburlaine
5425,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,and Hernani--are chanting the desires of their own hearts. Arnold's
5426,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"""Sohrab and Rustum,"" after finishing its tragic story of the son slain by"
5427,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the unwitting father, closes with a lyric description of the majestic Oxus"
5428,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"stream flowing on to the Aral sea. Objective as it all seems, this close"
5429,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"is intensely personal, permeated with the same tender stoicism which"
5430,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"colors Arnold's ""Dover Beach"" and ""A Summer Night."" The device of using a"
5431,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Nature picture at the end of a narrative, to heighten, by harmony or"
5432,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"contrast, the mood induced by the story itself, was freely utilized"
5433,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"by Tennyson in his _English Idylls_, such as ""Audley Court,"" ""Edwin"
5434,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Morris,"" ""Love and Duty,"" and ""The Golden Year."" It adds the last touch of"
5435,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"poignancy to Robert Frost's ""Death of the Hired Man."" These descriptive"
5436,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"passages, though lacking the song form, are as purely lyrical in their"
5437,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,function as the songs in _The Princess _or the songs in _The Winter's
5438,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Tale_.

5441,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,_1. The Blending of Types_
5442,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5443,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"While the scope of the present volume, as explained in the Preface,"
5444,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"precludes any specific study of drama and epic, the reader must bear in"
5445,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"mind that the three main types of poetry are not separated, in actual"
5446,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"practice, by immovably hard and fast lines. Pigeonhole classifications of"
5447,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"drama, epic and lyric types are highly convenient to the student for"
5448,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"purposes of analysis. But the moment one reads a ballad like ""Edward,"
5449,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Edward"" (_Oxford_, No. 373) or ""Helen of Kirconnell"" (_Oxford_, No. 387)"
5450,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,the pigeon-hole distinctions must be subordinated to the actual fact that
5451,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"these ballads are a blend of drama, story and song. The ""form"" is lyrical,"
5452,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the stuff is narrative, the mode of presentation is often that of purely"
5453,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,dramatic dialogue.
5454,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5455,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Take a contemporary illustration of this blending of types. Mr. Vachel
5456,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Lindsay has told us the origins of his striking poem ""The Congo."" He was"
5457,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"already in a ""national-theme mood,"" he says, when he listened to a sermon"
5458,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"about missionaries on the Congo River. The word ""Congo"" began to haunt"
5459,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"him. ""It echoed with the war-drums and cannibal yells of Africa."" Then,"
5460,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"for a list of colors for his palette, he had boyish memories of Stanley's"
5461,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"_Darkest Africa_, and of the dances of the Dahomey Amazons at the World's"
5462,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Fair in Chicago. He had seen the anti-negro riots in Springfield,"
5463,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Illinois. He had gone through a score of negro-saloons--""barrel-houses""--"
5464,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"on Eleventh Avenue, New York, and had ""accumulated a jungle impression"
5465,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"that remains with me yet."" Above all, there was Conrad's _Heart of"
5466,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Darkness_. ""I wanted to reiterate the word Congo--and the several refrains"
5467,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,in a way that would echo stories like that. I wanted to suggest
5468,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the terror, the reeking swamp-fever, the forest splendor, the"
5469,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"black-lacquered loveliness, and above all the eternal fatality of Africa,"
5470,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"that Conrad has written down with so sure a hand. I do not mean to say,"
5471,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"now that I have done, that I recorded all these things in rhyme. But every"
5472,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,time I rewrote 'The Congo' I reached toward them. I suppose I rewrote it
5473,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"fifty times in these two months, sometimes three times in one day."""
5474,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5475,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,It is not often that we get so veracious an account of the making
5476,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of a poem, so clear a conception of the blending of sound-motives,"
5477,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"color-motives, story-stuff, drama-stuff, personal emotion, into a single"
5478,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,whole.
5479,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5480,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Nor is there any clear separation of types when we strive to look back to
5481,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,the primitive origins of these various forms of poetry. In the opinion of
5482,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"many scholars, the origins are to be traced to a common source in the"
5483,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"dance. ""Dances, as overwhelming evidence, ethnological and sociological,"
5484,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"can prove, were the original stuff upon which dramatic, lyric and epic"
5485,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,impulses wove a pattern that is traced in later narrative ballads mainly
5486,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"as incremental repetition. Separation of its elements, and evolution to"
5487,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"higher forms, made the dance an independent art, with song, and then"
5488,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"music, ancillary to the figures and the steps; song itself passed to lyric"
5489,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,triumphs quite apart from choral voice and choral act; epic went its
5490,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"artistic way with nothing but rhythm as memorial of the dance, and the"
5491,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"story instead of dramatic situation; drama retained the situation, the"
5492,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"action, even the chorus and the dance, but submitted them to the shaping"
5493,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"and informing power of individual genius."""
5494,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"[Footnote: Gummere, _The Popular Ballad_, p. 106.]"
5495,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"In another striking passage, Professor Gummere asks us to visualize ""a"
5496,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"throng of people without skill to read or write, without ability to"
5497,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"project themselves into the future, or to compare themselves with the"
5498,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"past, or even to range their experience with the experience of other"
5499,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"communities, gathered in festal mood, and by loud song, perfect rhythm and"
5500,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"energetic dance, expressing their feelings over an event of quite local"
5501,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"origin, present appeal and common interest. Here, in point of evolution,"
5502,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"is the human basis of poetry, the foundation courses of the pyramid."""

5504,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5505,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,_2. Lyrical Element in Drama_
5506,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5507,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"We cannot here attempt to trace, even in outline, the course of this"
5508,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,historic evolution of genres. But in contemporary types of both dramatic
5509,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"and narrative poetry, there may still be discovered the influence of lyric"
5510,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"form and mood. We have already noted how the dramatist, for all of his"
5511,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"supposed objectivity, cannot refrain from coloring certain persons and"
5512,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"situations with the hues of his own fancy. Ibsen, for instance, injects"
5513,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"his irony, his love for symbolism, his theories for the reconstruction of"
5514,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"society, into the very blood and bone of his characters and into the"
5515,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"structure of his plots. So it is with Shaw, with Synge, with Hauptmann,"
5516,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"with Brieux. Even if their plays are written in prose, these men"
5517,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"are still ""makers,"" and the prose play may be as highly subjective in"
5518,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"mood, as definitely individual in phrasing, as full of atmosphere, as if"
5519,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,it were composed in verse.
5520,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5521,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,But the lyric possibilities of the drama are more easily realized if we
5522,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"turn from the prose play to the play in verse, and particularly to those"
5523,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Elizabethan dramas which are not only poetical in essence, but which"
5524,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,utilize actual songs for their dramatic value. No less than thirty-six of
5525,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Shakspere's plays contain stage-directions for music, and his marvelous"
5526,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,command of song-words is universally recognized. The English stage had
5527,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"made use of songs, in fact, ever since the liturgical drama of the Middle"
5528,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Ages. But Shakspere's unrivalled knowledge of _stage-craft_, as well as"
5529,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"his own instinct for harmonizing lyrical with theatrical effects, enabled"
5530,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,him to surpass all of his contemporaries in the art of using songs to
5531,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"bring actors on and off the stage, to anticipate following action, to"
5532,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"characterize personages, to heighten climaxes, and to express motions"
5533,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,beyond the reach of spoken words.
5534,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,[Footnote: These points are fully discussed in J. Robert Moore's Harvard
5535,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,dissertation (unpublished) on The Songs in the English Drama.]
5536,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"The popularity of such song-forms as the ""madrigal,"" which was sung"
5537,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"without musical accompaniment, made it easy for the public stage to cater"
5538,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"to the prevalent taste. The ""children of the Chapel"" or ""of Paul's,"" who"
5539,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"served as actors in the early Elizabethan dramas, were trained choristers,"
5540,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,and songs were a part of their stock in trade. Songs for sheer
5541,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"entertainment, common enough upon the stage when Shakspere began to write,"
5542,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,turned in his hands into exquisite instruments of character revelation and
5543,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of dramatic passion, until they became, on the lips of an Ophelia or a"
5544,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Desdemona, the most touching and poignant moments of the drama. ""Music"
5545,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"within"" is a frequent stage direction in the later Elizabethan plays, and"
5546,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"if one remembers the dramatic effectiveness of the Easter music,"
5547,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"off-stage, in Goethe's _Faust_, or the horn in _Hernani_, one can"
5548,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,understand how Wagner came to believe that a blending of music with poetry
5549,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"and action, as exhibited in his ""music-dramas,"" was demanded by the ideal"
5550,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,requirements of dramatic art. Wagner's theory and practice need not be
5551,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,rehearsed here. It is sufficient for our purpose to recall the
5552,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"indisputable fact that in some of the greatest plays ever written, lyric"
5553,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,forms have contributed richly and directly to the total dramatic effect.

5555,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5556,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,_3. The Dramatic Monologue_
5557,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5558,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"There is still another _genre_ of poetry, however, where the"
5559,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"inter-relations of drama, of narrative, and of lyric mood are peculiarly"
5560,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,interesting. It is the dramatic monologue. The range of expressiveness
5561,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,allowed by this type of poetry was adequately shown by Browning and
5562,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Tennyson, and recent poets like Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost"
5563,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,and Amy Lowell have employed it with consummate skill. The dramatic
5564,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"monologue is a dynamic revelation of a soul in action, not a mere static"
5565,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,bit of character study. It chooses some representative and specific
5566,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"occasion,--let us say a man's death-bed view of his career, as in ""The"
5567,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Bishop orders his Tomb"" or the first ""Northern Farmer."" It is something"
5568,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"more than a soliloquy overheard. There is a listener, who, though without"
5569,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"a speaking part, plays a very real role in the dialogue. For the dramatic"
5570,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,monologue is in essence a dialogue of which we hear only the chief
5571,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"speaker's part, as in ""My Last Duchess,"" or in E. A. Robinson's ""Ben"
5572,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford."" It is as if we were watching and"
5573,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"listening to a man telephoning. Though we see and hear but one person, we"
5574,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,are aware that the talk is shaped to a certain extent by the personality
5575,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"at the other end of the line. In Tennyson's ""Rizpah,"" for example, the"
5576,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"characteristics of the well-meaning, Bible-quoting parish visitor"
5577,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,determine some of the finest lines in the old mother's response. In
5578,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Browning's ""Andrea del Sarto"" the painter's wife, Lucrezia, says never a"
5579,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"word, but she has a more intense physical presence in that poem than many"
5580,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of the _dramatis personae_ of famous plays. Tennyson's ""Ulysses"" and ""Sir"
5581,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Galahad"" and ""The Voyage of Maeldune"" are splendid soliloquies and nothing"
5582,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"more. The first ""Locksley Hall"" is likewise a soliloquy, but in the second"
5583,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"""Locksley Hall"" and ""To-Morrow,"" where scraps of talk from the unseen"
5584,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,interlocutor are caught up and repeated by the speaker in passionate
5585,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"rebuttal, we have true drama of the ""confrontation"" type. We see a whole"
5586,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,soul in action.
5587,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5588,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Now this intense, dynamic fashion of revealing character through narrative"
5589,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,talk--and it is commonly a whole life-story which is condensed within the
5590,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,few lines of a dramatic monologue--touches lyricism at two points. The
5591,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,first is the fact that many dramatic monologues use distinctively lyric
5592,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,measures. The six-stress anapestic line which Tennyson preferred for his
5593,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"later dramatic monologues like ""Rizpah"" is really a ballad measure, and is"
5594,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"seen as such to its best advantage in ""The Revenge."" But in his monologues"
5595,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of the pure soliloquy type, like ""St. Agnes"" and ""Sir Galahad,"" the metre"
5596,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"is brilliantly lyrical, and the lyric associations of the verse are"
5597,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,carried over into the mood of the poem. And the other fact to be
5598,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,remembered is that the poignant self-analysis and self-betrayal of the
5599,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"dramatic monologue, its ""egoism"" and its ultimate and appalling"
5600,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"sincerities, are a part of the very nature of the lyric impulse. These"
5601,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"revealers of their souls may use the speaking, rather than the singing"
5602,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"voice, but their tones have the deep, rich lyric intimacy."
5603,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5604,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5605,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,4. _Lyric and Narrative_
5606,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5607,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"In narrative poetry, no less than in drama, we must note the intrusion of"
5608,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the lyric mood, as well as the influence of lyric forms. Theoretically,"
5609,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"narrative or ""epic"" poetry is based upon an objective experience."
5610,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Something has happened, and the poet tells us about it. He has heard or"
5611,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"read, or possibly taken part in, an event, and the event, rather than the"
5612,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"poet's thought or feeling about it, is the core of the poem. But as soon"
5613,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"as he begins to tell his tale, we find that he is apt to ""set it out"" with"
5614,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,vivid description. He is obliged to paint a picture as well as to spin a
5615,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"yarn, and not even Homer and Virgil--""objective"" as they are supposed to"
5616,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,be---can draw a picture without betraying something of their attitude and
5617,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"feeling towards their material. Like the messenger in Greek drama,"
5618,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,their voices are shaken by what they have seen or heard. In the popular
5619,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"epic like the Nibelungen story, there is more objectivity than in the epic"
5620,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,of art like _Jerusalem Delivered_ or _Paradise Lost_. We do not know who
5621,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,put together in their present form such traditional tales as the _Lay of
5622,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the Nibelungs_ and _Beowulf_, and the personal element in the narrative is"
5623,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"only obscurely felt, whereas _Jerusalem Delivered_ is a constant"
5624,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"revelation of Tasso, and the personality of Milton colors every line in"
5625,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"_Paradise Lost_. When Matthew Arnold tells us that Homer is rapid, plain,"
5626,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"simple and noble, he is depicting the characteristics of a poet as well as"
5627,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,the impression made by the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. Those general traits
5628,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of epic poetry which have been discussed ever since the Renaissance, like"
5629,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"""breadth,"" and ""unity"" and the sustained ""grand"" style, turn ultimately"
5630,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,upon the natural qualities of great story-tellers. They are not mere
5631,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,rhetorical abstractions.
5632,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5633,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"The narrative poet sees man as accomplishing a deed, as a factor in an"
5634,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"event. His primary business is to report action, not to philosophize or to"
5635,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,dissect character or to paint landscape. Yet so sensitive is he to the
5636,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"environing circumstances of action, and so bent upon displaying the"
5637,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"varieties of human motive and conduct, that he cannot help reflecting in"
5638,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,his verse his own mental attitude toward the situations which he depicts.
5639,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"He may surround these situations, as we have seen, with all the beauties"
5640,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"and pomps and terrors of the visible world. In relating ""God's ways to"
5641,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"man"" he instinctively justifies or condemns. He cannot even tell a story"
5642,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"exactly as it was told to him: he must alter it, be it ever so slightly,"
5643,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,to make it fit his general conceptions of human nature and human fate. He
5644,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,gives credence to one witness and not to another. His imagination plays
5645,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,around the noble and base elements in his story until their original
5646,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,proportions are altered to suit his mind and purpose. Study the Tristram
5647,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"story, as told by Gottfried of Strassburg, by Malory, Tennyson,"
5648,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Arnold, Swinburne and Wagner, and you will see how each teller betrays his"
5649,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,own personality through these instinctive processes of transformation of
5650,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,his material. It is like the Roman murder story told so many times over in
5651,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Browning's _Ring and the Book_: the main facts are conceded by each
5652,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"witness, and yet the inferences from the facts range from Heaven to Hell."
5653,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5654,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Browning is of course an extreme instance of this irruption of the poet's
5655,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,personality upon the stuff of his story. He cannot help lyricising and
5656,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"dramatizing his narrative material, any more than he can help making all"
5657,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"his characters talk ""Browningese."" But Byron's tales in verse show the"
5658,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,same subjective tendency. He was so little of a dramatist that all of his
5659,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"heroes, like Poe's, are images of himself. No matter what the raw material"
5660,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of his narrative poems may be, they become uniformly ""Byronic"" as he"
5661,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"writes them down. And all this is ""lyricism,"" however disguised. William"
5662,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Morris, almost alone among modern English poets, seemed to stand gravely"
5663,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"aloof from the tales he told, as his master Chaucer stood smilingly aloof."

5718,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"The word ""ballad,"" like ""ode"" and ""sonnet,"" is very ancient and has been"

5725,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,lyric specifically. In the Elizabethan period the word was used loosely
5726,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"for ""song."" Only after the revival of interest in English and Scottish"
5727,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,popular ballads in the eighteenth century has the word come gradually to

5773,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"they omit to assign dialogue to a specific person, leaving you to guess"
5774,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,who is talking. Over certain bits of action or situation they linger as if

5779,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"of choral collaboration implies a constant use of repetition and refrain,"
5780,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"as in a sailor's ""chanty."" One of their chief ways of building a situation"

5937,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,and gloriously than in the irregular ode: there may be any number of lines
5938,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"in each strophe, and often the strophe itself becomes dissolved into"
5939,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"something corresponding to the ""movement"" of a symphony. Masterpieces like"
5940,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"William Vaughn Moody's ""Ode in Time of Hesitation"" and Francis Thompson's"
5941,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"""Hound of Heaven"" reveal of course a firm intellectual grasp upon the"
5942,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,underlying theme of the ode and upon the logical processes of its
5943,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,development. But although we may follow with keen intellectual

5945,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,readers of poetry whose susceptibility to complicated combinations of

5948,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Urn,"" who remembers that the rhyme scheme of the first stanza is unlike"
5949,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"that of the following stanzas? Or that the second stanza of the ""Ode to a"

5965,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5966,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"The sonnet, likewise, is a lyric form which illustrates the delicate"
5967,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"balance between freedom and restraint. Let us look first at its structure,"
5968,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,and then at its capacity for expressing thought and feeling.
5969,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5970,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Both name and structure are Italian in origin, ""sonetto"" being the"
5971,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"diminutive of ""suono,"" sound. Dante and Petrarch knew it as a special"
5972,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,lyric form intended for musical accompaniment. It must have fourteen
5973,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"lines, neither more nor less, with five beats or ""stresses"" to the line."
5974,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Each line must end with a rhyme. In the arrangement of the rhymes the
5975,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"sonnet is made up of two parts, or rhyme-systems: the first eight lines"
5976,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"forming the ""octave,"" and the last six the ""sestet."" The octave is made up"
5977,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,of two quatrains and the sestet of two tercets. There is a main pause in
5978,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"passing from the octave to the sestet, and frequently there are minor"
5979,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"pauses in passing from the first quatrain to the second, and from the"
5980,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,first tercet to the last.
5981,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5982,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Almost all of Petrarch's sonnets follow this rhyme-scheme: for the octave,"
5983,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"_a b b a a b b a_; for the sestet, either _c d e c d e_ or _c d c d c d_."
5984,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"This strict ""Petrarchan"" form has endured for six centuries. It has been"
5985,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"adopted by poets of every race and language, and it is used to-day as"
5986,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,widely or more widely than ever. While individual poets have constantly
5987,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"experimented with different rhyme-schemes, particularly in the sestet, the"
5988,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,only really notable invention of a new sonnet form was made by the
5989,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Elizabethans. Puttenham's _Arte of English Poesie_ (1589) declares that
5990,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"""Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder and Henry Earl of Surrey, having travelled"
5991,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,into Italy and there tasted the sweet and stately measures and style of
5992,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"the Italian poesie,... greatly polished our rude and homely manner of"
5993,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"vulgar poesie.... Their conceits were lofty, their style stately, their"
5994,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"conveyance cleanly, their terms proper, their metre sweet and"
5995,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"well-proportioned, in all imitating very naturally and studiously their"
5996,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Master Francis Petrarch."""
5997,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
5998,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"This is charming, but as a matter of fact both Wyatt and Surrey, with"
5999,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"natural English independence, broke away from the strict Petrarchan rhyme"
6000,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"form. Wyatt liked a final couplet, and Surrey used a rhyme-scheme which"
6001,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"was later adopted by Shakspere and is known to-day as the ""Shaksperean"""
6002,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"form of sonnet: namely, three quatrains made up of alternate rhymes--a"
6003,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,separate rhyme-scheme for each quatrain--and a closing couplet. The rhymes
6004,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,consequently run thus: _a b a b c d c d e f e f g g_. To the Petrarchan
6005,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"purist this is clearly no sonnet at all, in spite of its fourteen"
6006,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"five-beat, rhyming lines. For the distinction between octave and sestet"
6007,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"has disappeared, there is a threefold division of the first twelve lines,"
6008,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"and the final couplet gives an epigrammatic summary or ""point"" which"
6009,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,Petrarch took pains to avoid.
6010,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,
6011,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,The difference will be still more clearly manifest if we turn from a
6012,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,comparison of rhyme-structure to the ordering of the thought in the
6013,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"Petrarchan sonnet. Mark Pattison, a stout ""Petrarchan,"" lays down these"
6014,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,rules in the Preface to his edition of Milton's Sonnets:
6015,RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC,"[Footnote: D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1883.]"

6216,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","endeavors to classify races in simple terms, as Madame de Staël attempted"
6217,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","to do, for instance, in her famous book on Germany. We endeavor to"
6218,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","distinguish, more accurately than of old, between ethnic, linguistic and"
6219,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",political divisions of men. We try to look behind the name at the thing
6220,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","itself: we remember that ""Spanish"" architecture is Arabian, and a good"
6221,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","deal of ""Gothic"" is Northern French. We confess that we are only at the"
6222,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","beginning of a true science of ethnology. ""It is only in their degree of"
6223,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","physical and mental evolution that the races of men are different,"""
6224,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","says Professor W. Z. Ripley, author of _Races in Europe_. The late"
6225,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Professor Josiah Royce admitted: ""I am baffled to discover just what the"
6226,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",results of science are regarding the true psychological and moral meaning
6227,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of race differences.... All men in prehistoric times are surprisingly
6228,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","alike in their minds, their morals and their arts....  We do not"

6232,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6233,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","I have often thought of these utterances of my colleagues, as I have"
6234,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",attempted to teach something about lyric poetry in Harvard classrooms
6235,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","where Chinese, Japanese, Jewish, Irish, French, German, Negro, Russian,"
6236,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Italian and Armenian students appear in bewildering and stimulating
6237,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",confusion. Precisely what is their racial reaction to a lyric of Sappho?
6238,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",To an Anglo-Saxon war-song of the tenth century? To a Scotch ballad? To
6239,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","one of Shakspere's songs? Some specific racial reaction there must be,"
6240,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","one imagines, but such capacity for self-expression as the student"
6241,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",commands is rarely capable of giving more than a hint of it.
6242,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6243,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","And what real response is there, among the majority of contemporary"
6244,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","lovers of poetry, to the delicate shades of feeling which color the"
6245,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",verse of specific periods in the various national literatures? We all use
6246,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","catch-words, and I shall use them myself later in this chapter, in the"
6247,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","attempt to indicate the changes in lyric atmosphere as we pass, for"
6248,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","instance, from the Elizabethan to the Jacobean age, or from the ""Augustan"""
6249,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",to the Romantic epoch in English literature. Is this sensitiveness to the
6250,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",temper of various historic periods merely the possession of a few hundred
6251,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","professional scholars, who have trained themselves, like Walter Pater, to"
6252,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",live in some well-chosen moment of the past and to find in their
6253,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",hyper-sensitized responsiveness to its voices a sort of consolation prize
6254,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","for their isolation from the present? Race-mindedness is common, no doubt,"
6255,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","but difficult to express in words: historic-mindedness, though more"
6256,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","capable of expression, is necessarily confined to a few. Is the response"
6257,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","to the poetry of past epochs, then, chiefly a response of the individual"
6258,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","reader to an individual poet, and do we cross the frontiers of race and"
6259,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",language and historic periods with the main purpose of finding a man after
6260,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",our own heart? Or is the secret of our pleasure in the poetry of alien
6261,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","races and far-off times simply this: that nothing human is really alien,"
6262,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and that poetry through its generalizing, universalizing power, reveals to"
6263,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",us the essential oneness of mankind?

6266,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_2. Graphic Arts and the Lyric_
6267,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6268,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",A specific illustration may suggest an answer. An American collector of
6269,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Japanese prints recognizes in these specimens of Oriental craftsmanship
6270,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",that mastery of line and composition which are a part of the universal
6271,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","language of the graphic arts. Any human being, in fact, who has developed"
6272,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",a sensitiveness to artistic beauty will receive a measure of delight from
6273,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the work of Japanese masters. A few strokes of the brush upon silk, a bit"
6274,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of lacquer work, the decoration of a sword-hilt, are enough to set his eye"
6275,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",dancing. But the expert collector soon passes beyond this general
6276,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",enthusiasm into a quite particular interest in the handicraft of special
6277,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","artists,--a Motonobu, let us say, or a Sesshiu. The collector finds his"
6278,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","pleasure in their individual handling of artistic problems, their unique"
6279,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","faculties of eye and hand. He responds, in a word, both to the"
6280,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","cosmopolitan language employed by every practitioner of the fine arts, and"
6281,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","to the local idiom, the personal accent, of, let us say, a certain"
6282,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Japanese draughtsman of the eighteenth century.
6283,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6284,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","And now take, by way of confirmation and also of contrast, the attitude of"
6285,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",an American lover of poetry toward those specimens of Japanese and Chinese
6286,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",lyrics which have recently been presented to us in English translations.
6287,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",The American's ignorance of the riental languages cuts him off from any
6288,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",appreciation of the individual handling of diction and metre. A Lafcadio
6289,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Hearn may write delightfully about that special seventeen syllable form of
6290,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Japanese verse known as the _hokku_. Here is a _hokku_ by Basho, one of"
6291,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",the most skilled composers in that form. Hearn prints it with the
6292,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","translation,"
6293,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","[Footnote: _Kwaidan_, p. 188. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1904.]"
6294,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",and explains that the verses are intended to suggest the joyous feeling of
6295,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",spring-time:
6296,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6297,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""Oki, oki yo!"
6298,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Waga tomo ni sen
6299,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Néru--kocho!"""
6300,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6301,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","(Wake up! Wake up!--I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly.)"
6302,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","An Occidental reader may recognize, through the translation, the charm of"
6303,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the poetic image, and he may be interested in a technical lyric form"
6304,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","hitherto new to him, but beyond this, in his ignorance of Japanese, he"
6305,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","cannot go. Here is a lyric by Wang Ch'ang-Ling, a Chinese poet of the"
6306,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",eighth century:
6307,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6308,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_Tears in the Spring_
6309,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from _The Lute of Jade_,"
6310,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","London, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]"
6311,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6312,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""Clad in blue silk and bright embroidery"
6313,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","At the first call of Spring the fair young bride,"
6314,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","On whom as yet Sorrow has laid no scar,"
6315,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Climbs the Kingfisher's Tower. Suddenly
6316,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","She sees the bloom of willows far and wide,"
6317,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","And grieves for him she lent to fame and war."""
6318,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6319,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","And here is another spring lyric by Po Chü-I (A.D. 772-846), as clear and"
6320,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",simple as anything in the Greek Anthology:
6321,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6322,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_The Grass_
6323,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from _The Lute of Jade_,"
6324,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","London, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]"
6325,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",

6332,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",The blue sky storms the ruined city walls;
6333,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Yet since Wang Sun departed long ago,"
6334,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","When the grass blooms both joy and fear I know."""
6335,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6336,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","The Western reader, although wholly at the mercy of the translator,"
6337,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",recognizes the pathos and beauty of the scene and thought expressed by the
6338,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Chinese poet. But all that is specifically Chinese in lyric form is lost
6339,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",to him.
6340,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6341,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",I have purposely chosen these Oriental types of lyric because they
6342,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",represent so clearly the difference between the universal language of the
6343,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",graphic arts and the more specialized language of poetry. The latter is
6344,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","still able to convey, even through translation, a suggestion of the"
6345,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",emotions common to all men; and this is true of the verse which lies
6346,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",wholly outside the line of that Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition which has
6347,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",affected so profoundly the development of modern European literature. Yet
6348,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","to express ""_ce que tout le monde pense_""--which was Boileau's version of"
6349,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Horace's ""_propria communia dicere_""--is only part of the function of"
6350,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",lyric poetry. To give the body of the time the form and pressure of
6351,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","individual feeling, of individual artistic mastery of the language of"
6352,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","one's race and epoch;--this, no less than the other, is the task and the"
6353,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",opportunity of the lyric poet.

6356,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_3. Decay and Survival_
6357,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6358,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","To appreciate the triumph of whatever lyrics have survived, even when"
6359,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","sheltered by the protection of common racial or cultural traditions, one"
6360,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","must remember that the overwhelming majority of lyrics, like the majority"
6361,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of artistic products of all ages and races and stages of civilization, are"
6362,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",irretrievably lost. Weak-winged is song! A book like Gummere's _Beginnings
6363,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of Poetry_, glancing as it does at the origins of so many national"
6364,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",literatures and at the rudimentary poetic efforts of various races that
6365,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","have never emerged from barbarism, gives one a poignant sense of the"
6366,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",prodigality of the song-impulse compared with the slenderness of the
6367,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",actual survivals. Autumn leaves are not more fugitive. Even when preserved
6368,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","by sacred ritual, like the Vedas and the Hebrew Psalter, what we possess"
6369,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",is only an infinitesimal fraction of what has perished. The Sibyl tears
6370,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",leaf after leaf from her precious volume and scatters them to the winds.
6371,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","How many glorious Hebrew war-songs of the type presented in the ""Song of"
6372,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Deborah"" were chanted only to be forgotten! We have but a handful of the"
6373,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","lyrics of Sappho and of the odes of Pindar, while the fragments of lyric"
6374,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",verse gathered up in the _Greek Anthology_ tantalize us with their
6375,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",reminder of what has been lost beyond recall.
6376,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6377,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Yet if we keep to the line of Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition, we are equally"
6378,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",impressed with the enduring influence of the few lyrics that have
6379,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","survived. The Hebrew lyric, in its diction, its rhythmical patterns, and"
6380,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","above all in its flaming intensity of spirit, bears the marks of racial"
6381,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","purity, of mental vigor and moral elevation. It became something even more"
6382,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","significant, however, than the spiritual expression of a chosen race. The"
6383,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",East met the West when these ancient songs of the Hebrew Psalter were
6384,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","adopted and sung by the Christian Church. They were translated, in the"
6385,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","fourth century, into the Latin of the Vulgate. Many an Anglo-Saxon gleeman"
6386,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",knew that Latin version. It moulded century after century the liturgy of
6387,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the European world. It influenced Tyndale's English version of the Psalms,"
6388,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",and this has in turn affected the whole vocabulary and style of the modern
6389,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",English lyric. There is scarcely a page of the _Oxford Book of English
6390,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Verse_ which does not betray in word or phrase the influence of the
6391,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Hebrew Psalter.
6392,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6393,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Or take that other marvelous example of the expression of emotion in terms
6394,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of bodily sensation, the lyric of the Greeks. Its clarity and unity, its"
6395,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","dislike of vagueness and excess, its finely artistic restraint, are"
6396,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",characteristic of the race. The simpler Greek lyrical measures were taken
6397,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","over by Catullus, Horace and Ovid, and though there were subtle qualities"
6398,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of the Greek models which escaped the Roman imitators, the Greco-Roman or"

6409,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","abstention from irrelevancy, the frank love for all that is beautiful or"
6410,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","charming, for the beauty of the body and for everything connected with the"
6411,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","joy of mortal life, the antique reticence as to hopes or fears of what was"

6417,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",The racial characteristics of the peoples of Western Europe began to show
6418,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","themselves even in their Latin poetry, but it is naturally in the rise of"

6420,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","signs of thnic differentiation. Teuton and Frank and Norseman, Spaniard or"
6421,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Italian, betray their blood as soon as they begin to sing in their own"
6422,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",tongue. The scanty remains of Anglo-Saxon lyrical verse are colored with
6423,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the love of battle and of the sea, with the desolateness of lonely wolds,"

6510,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",authority. It stimulated intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm. Literary
6511,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",criticism awoke to life in the trenchant discussions of the art of poetry
6512,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","by Gascoigne and Sidney, by Puttenham, Campion and Daniel. The very titles"
6513,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of the collections of lyrics which followed the famous _Tottel's
6514,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Miscellany_ of 1557 flash with the spirit of the epoch: _A Paradise of
6515,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Dainty Devices, A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions, A Handfull"
6516,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of Pleasant Delights, The Phoenix Nest, England's Helicon_, Davison's"
6517,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_Poetical Rhapsody._
6518,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6519,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Bullen, Schelling, Rhys, Braithwaite, and other modern collectors of the"
6520,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Elizabethan lyric have ravaged these volumes and many more, and have shown"
6521,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","how the imported Italian pastoral tallied with the English idyllic mood,"
6522,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","how the study of prosody yielded rich and various stanzaic effects, how"
6523,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",the diffusion of the passion for song through all classes of the community
6524,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","gave a marvelous singing quality to otherwise thin and mere ""dildido"""
6525,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",lines. Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch and his friends have revived the music of the
6526,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Elizabethan song-books, and John Erskine and other scholars have"
6527,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",investigated the relation of the song-books--especially the songs composed
6528,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","by musicians such as Byrd, Dowland and Campion--to the form and quality of"
6529,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",the surviving lyric verse. But one does not need a knowledge of the
6530,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Elizabethan lute and viol, and of the precise difference between a"
6531,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""madrigal"" and a ""catch"" or ""air"" in order to perceive the tunefulness"
6532,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of a typical Elizabethan song:
6533,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6534,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""I care not for these ladies,"
6535,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",That must be woode and praide:
6536,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Give me kind Amarillis,"
6537,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",The wanton countrey maide.
6538,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Nature art disdaineth,"
6539,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Here beautie is her owne.
6540,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Her when we court and kisse,"
6541,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","She cries, Forsooth, let go:"
6542,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","But when we come where comfort is,"
6543,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","She never will say No."""
6544,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6545,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","It is not that the spirit of Elizabethan lyric verse is always care-free,"
6546,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",even when written by prodigals such as Peele and Greene and Marlowe. Its
6547,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","childlike grasping after sensuous pleasure is often shadowed by the sword,"
6548,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",and by quick-coming thoughts of the brevity of mortal things. Yet it is
6549,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","always spontaneous, swift, alive. Its individual voices caught the tempo"
6550,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and cadence of the race and epoch, so that men as unlike personally as"
6551,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Spenser, Marlowe and Donne are each truly ""Elizabethan."" Spenser's"
6552,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""vine-like"" luxuriance, Marlowe's soaring energy, Donne's grave realistic"
6553,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","subtleties, illustrate indeed that note of individualism which is never"
6554,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",lacking in the great poetic periods. This individualism betrays itself in
6555,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","almost every song of Shakspere's plays. For here is English race, surely,"
6556,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and the very echo and temper of the Renaissance, but with it all there is"
6557,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the indescribable, inimitable _timbre_ of one man's singing voice."

6559,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6560,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_6. The Reaction_
6561,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6562,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","If we turn, however, from the lyrics of Shakspere to those of Ben Jonson"
6563,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and of the ""sons of Ben"" who sang in the reigns of James I and Charles I,"
6564,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",we become increasingly conscious of a change in atmosphere. The moment of
6565,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","expansion has passed. The ""first fine careless rapture"" is over. Classical"
6566,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""authority"" resumes its silent, steady pressure. Scholars like to remember"
6567,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","that the opening lines of Ben Jonson's ""Drink to me only with thine eyes"""
6568,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","are a transcript from the Greek. In his ""Ode to Himself upon the Censure"
6569,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of his _New Inn_"" in 1620 Jonson, like Landor long afterward, takes"
6570,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",scornful refuge from the present in turning back to Greece and Rome:
6571,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6572,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""Leave things so prostitute,"
6573,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",And take the Alcaic lute;
6574,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon's lyre;"
6575,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Warm thee by Pindar's fire."""
6576,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6577,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","The reaction in lyric form showed itself in the decay of sonnet, pastoral"
6578,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and madrigal, in the neglect of blank verse, in the development of the"
6579,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","couplet. Milton, in such matters as these, was a solitary survival of the"
6580,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Elizabethans. Metrical experimentation almost ceased, except in the hands"
6581,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of ingenious recluses like George Herbert. The popular metre of the
6582,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Caroline poets was the rhymed eight and six syllable quatrain:
6583,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6584,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""Yet this inconstancy is such"
6585,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",As thou too shalt adore;
6586,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","I could not love thee, Dear, so much"
6587,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Loved I not Honour more."""
6588,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6589,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","The mystics like Crashaw, Vaughan and Traherne wished and secured a wider"
6590,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","metrical liberty, and it is, in truth, these complicated patterns of the"
6591,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",devotional lyric of the seventeenth century that are of greatest interest
6592,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","to the poets of our own day. But contemporary taste, throughout the"
6593,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","greater portion of that swiftly changing epoch, preferred verse that"
6594,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","showed a conservative balance in thought and feeling, in diction and"
6595,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","versification. Waller, with his courtier-like instinct for what was"
6596,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","acceptable, took the middle of the road, letting Cowley and Quarles"
6597,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","experiment as fantastically as they pleased. Andrew Marvell, too, a"
6598,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Puritan writing in the Restoration epoch, composed as ""smoothly"""
6599,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","as Waller. Herrick, likewise, though fond of minor metrical experiments,"
6600,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",celebrated his quiet garden pleasures and his dalliance with amorous
6601,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","fancies in verse of the true Horatian type. ""Intensive rather than"
6602,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","expansive, fanciful rather than imaginative, and increasingly restrictive"
6603,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","in its range and appeal"": that is Professor Schelling's expert summary of"
6604,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",the poetic tendencies of the age.
6605,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6606,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",And then the lyric impulse died away in England. Dryden could be
6607,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","magnificently sonorous in declamation and satire, but he lacked the"
6608,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","singing voice. Pope likewise, though he ""lisped in numbers,"" could never,"
6609,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","for all of his cleverness, learn to sing. The age of the Augustans, in the"
6610,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","first quarter of the eighteenth century, was an age of prose, of reason,"
6611,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of good sense, of ""correctness."" The decasyllabic couplet, so resonant in"
6612,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Dryden, so admirably turned and polished by Pope, was its favorite"
6613,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","measure. The poets played safe. They took no chances with ""enthusiasm,"""
6614,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",either in mood or metrical device. What could be said within the
6615,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","restraining limits of the couplet they said with admirable point, vigor"
6616,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and grace. But it was speech, not song."
6617,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6618,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6619,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",7. _The Romantic Lyric_
6620,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6621,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","The revolt came towards the middle of the century, first in the lyrics of"
6622,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Collins, then in Gray. The lark began to soar and sing once more in"
6623,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",English skies. New windows were opened in the House of Life. Men looked
6624,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","out again with curiosity, wonder and a sense of strangeness in the"
6625,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",presence of beauty. They saw Nature with new eyes; found a new richness in
6626,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the Past, a new picturesque and savor in the life of other races,"
6627,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",particularly in the wild Northern and Celtic strains of blood. Life grew
6628,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","again something mysterious, not to be comprehended by the ""good sense"" of"
6629,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the Augustans, or expressible in the terms of the rhymed couplet. Instead"
6630,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of the normal, poets sought the exceptional, then the strange, the"
6631,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","far-away in time or place, or else the familiar set in some unusual"
6632,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",fantastic light. The mood of poetry changed from tranquil sentiment to
6633,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","excited sentiment or ""sensibility,"" and then to sheer passion. The forms"
6634,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of poetry shifted from the conventional to the revival of old measures
6635,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","like blank verse and the Spenserian stanza, then to the invention of new"
6636,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and freer forms, growing ever more lyrical. Poetic diction rebelled"
6637,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","against the Augustan conventions, the stereotyped epithets, the frigid"
6638,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",personifications. It abandoned the abstract and general for the specific
6639,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and the picturesque. It turned to the language of real life, and then,"
6640,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","dissatisfied, to the heightened language of passion. If one reads Cowper,"
6641,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Blake, Burns and Wordsworth, to say nothing of poets like Byron and"
6642,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Shelley who wrote in the full Romantic tide of feeling, one finds that"
6643,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","this poetry has discovered new themes. It portrays the child, the peasant,"
6644,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the villager, the outcast, the slave, the solitary person, even the idiot"
6645,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and the lunatic. There is a new human feeling for the individual, and for"
6646,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the endless, the poignant variety of ""states of soul."" Browning, by and"
6647,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","by, is to declare that ""states of soul"" are the only things worth a poet's"
6648,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",attention.
6649,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6650,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Now this new individuality of themes, of language, of moods, assisted in"
6651,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the free expression of lyricism, the release of the song-impulse of the"
6652,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""single, separate person."" The Romantic movement was revelatory, in a"
6653,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","double sense. ""Creation widened in man's view""; and there was equally a"
6654,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",revelation of individual poetic energy which gave the Romantic lyric an
6655,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",extraordinary variety and beauty of form. There was an exaggerated
6656,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","individualism, no doubt, which marked the weak side of the whole movement:"
6657,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","a deliberate extravagance, a cultivated egoism. Vagueness has its"
6658,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","legitimate poetic charm, but in England no less than in Germany or France"
6659,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",lyric vagueness often became incoherence. Symbolism degenerated into
6660,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",meaninglessness. But the fantastic and grotesque side of Romantic
6661,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",individualism should not blind us to the central fact that a rich
6662,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","personality may appear in a queer garb. Victor Hugo, like his young"
6663,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","friends of the 1830's, loved to make the gray-coated citizens of Paris"
6664,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","stare at his scarlet, but the personality which could create such lyric"
6665,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",marvels as the _Odes et Ballades_ may be forgiven for its eccentricities.
6666,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","William Blake was eccentric to the verge of insanity, yet he opened, like"
6667,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Whitman and Poe, new doors of ivory into the wonder-world."
6668,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6669,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Yet a lyrist like Keats, it must be remembered, betrayed his personality"
6670,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",not so much through any external peculiarity of the Romantic temperament
6671,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",as through the actual texture of his word and phrase and rhythm. Examine
6672,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","his brush-work microscopically, as experts in Italian painting examine the"
6673,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",brushstrokes and pigments of some picture attributed to this or that
6674,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","master: you will see that Keats, like all the supreme masters of poetic"
6675,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","diction, enciphered his lyric message in a language peculiarly his own. It"
6676,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","is for us to decipher it as we may. He used, of course, particularly in"
6677,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","his earlier work, some of the stock-epithets, the stock poetic"
6678,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""properties"" of the Romantic school, just as the young Tennyson, in his"
6679,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","volume of 1827, played with the ""owl"" and the ""midnight"" and the ""solitary"
6680,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","mere,"" stock properties of eighteenth-century romance. Yet Tennyson, like"
6681,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Keats, and for that matter like Shakspere, passed through this imitative"
6682,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",phase into an artistic maturity where without violence or extravagance or
6683,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",eccentricity he compelled words to do his bidding. Each word bears the
6684,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",finger-print of a personality.
6685,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6686,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Now it is precisely this revelation of personality which gave zest,"
6687,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","throughout the Romantic period, to the curiosity about the poetry of alien"
6688,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",races. It will be remembered that Romanticism followed immediately upon a
6689,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","period of cosmopolitanism, and that it preceded that era of intense"
6690,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",nationalism which came after the Napoleonic wars. Even in that
6691,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","intellectual ""United States of Europe,"" about 1750--when nationalistic"
6692,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","differences were minimized, ""enlightenment"" was supreme and ""propria"
6693,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","communia dicere"" was the literary motto--there was nevertheless a rapidly"
6694,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",growing curiosity about races and literatures outside the charmed circle
6695,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","of Western Europe. It was the era of the Oriental tale, of Northern"
6696,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","mythology. Then the poets of England, France and Germany began their"
6697,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",fruitful interchange of inspiration. Walter Scott turned poet when he
6698,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","translated Burger's ""Lenore."" Goethe read Marlowe's _Dr. Faustus_."
6699,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Wordsworth and Coleridge visited Germany not in search of general
6700,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","eighteenth-century ""enlightenment,"" but rather in quest of some peculiar"
6701,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","revelation of truth and beauty. In the full tide of Romanticism,"
6702,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Protestant Germany sought inspiration in Italy and Spain, as Catholic"
6703,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",France sought it in Germany and England. A new sense of race-values
6704,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","was evident in poetry. It may be seen in Southey, Moore, and Byron, in"
6705,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Hugo's _Les Orientales_ and in Leconte de Lisle's _Poèmes Barbares_.
6706,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Modern music has shown the same tendency: Strauss of Vienna writes waltzes
6707,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","in Arab rhythms, Grieg composes a Scotch symphony, Dvorák writes an"
6708,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",American national anthem utilizing negro melodies. As communication
6709,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","between races has grown easier, and the interest in race-characteristics"
6710,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","more intense, it would be strange indeed if lovers of lyric poetry did not"
6711,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",range far afield in their search for new complexities of lyric feeling.

6714,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",_8. The Explorer's Pleasure_
6715,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6716,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",This explorer's pleasure in discovering the lyrics of other races was
6717,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",never more keen than it is to-day. Every additional language that one
6718,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","learns, every new sojourn in a foreign country, enriches one's own"
6719,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","capacity for sharing the lyric mood. It is impossible, of course, that any"
6720,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",race or period should enter fully into the lyric impulses of another.
6721,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Educated Englishmen have known their Horace for centuries, but it can be"
6722,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","only a half-knowledge, delightful as it is. France and England, so near in"
6723,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","miles, are still so far away in instinctive comprehension of each other's"
6724,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",mode of poetical utterance! No two nations have minds of quite the same
6725,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""fringe."" No man, however complete a linguist, has more than one real"
6726,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","mother tongue, and it is only in one's mother tongue that a lyric"
6727,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","sings with all its over-tones. And nevertheless, life offers few purer"
6728,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",pleasures than may be found in listening to the half-comprehended songs
6729,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","uttered by alien lips indeed, but from hearts that we know are like our"
6730,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",own.
6731,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6732,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,"
6733,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",It seems to me there are other men in other lands
6734,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","yearning and thoughtful,"
6735,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",It seems to me I can look over and behold them in
6736,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Germany, Italy, France, Spain,"
6737,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or Japan,"
6738,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","talking other dialects,"
6739,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",And it seems to me if I could know those men I
6740,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",should become attached to them as I do to
6741,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","men in my own lands,"
6742,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","O I know we should be brethren and lovers,"
6743,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","I know I should be happy with them."""

6746,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",9. _A Test_
6747,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6748,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","If the reader is willing to test his own responsiveness, not to the alien"
6749,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","voices, but to singers of his own blood in other epochs, let him now read"
6750,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","aloud--or better, recite from memory--three of the best-known English"
6751,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","poems: Milton's ""Lycidas,"" Gray's ""Elegy"" and Wordsworth's ""Ode to"
6752,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","Immortality."" The first was published in 1638, the second in 1751, and the"
6753,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","third in 1817. Each is a ""central"" utterance of a race, a period and an"
6754,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","individual. Each is an open-air poem, written by a young Englishman; each"
6755,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","is lyrical, elegiac--a song of mourning and of consolation. ""Lycidas"" is"
6756,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","the last flawless music of the English Renaissance, an epitome of"
6757,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","classical and pastoral convention, yet at once Christian, political and"
6758,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","personal. Beneath the quiet perfection of Gray's ""Elegy"" there is the"
6759,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","undertone of passionate sympathy for obscure lives: passionate, but"
6760,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",restrained. Wordsworth knows no restraint of form or feeling in
6761,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","his great ""Ode""; its germinal idea is absurd to logic, but not to the"
6762,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","imagination. This elegy, like the others, is a ""lyric cry"" of a man, an"
6763,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","age, and a race; ""enciphered"" like them, with all the cunning of which the"
6764,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",artist was capable; and decipherable only to those who know the language
6765,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",of the English lyric.
6766,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6767,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","There may be readers who find these immortal elegies wearisome, staled by"
6768,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","repetition, spoiled by the critical glosses of generations of"
6769,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","commentators. In that case, one may test his sense of race, period"
6770,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","and personality by a single quatrain of Landor, who is surely not"
6771,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",over-commented upon to-day:
6772,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
6773,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL","""From you, Ianthe, little troubles pass"
6774,"RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",Like little ripples down a sunny river;

6820,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Certainly they cannot be ranked until their work is finished. Nor is it

6825,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,and Mr. Lowes's _Convention and Revolt_. I wish rather to remind the
6826,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"reader, first, of the long-standing case against the lyric, a case"
6827,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,which has been under trial in the court of critical opinion from Plato's
6828,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"day to our own; and then to indicate, even more briefly, the lines of"
6829,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"defence. It will be clear, as we proceed, that contemporary verse in"
6830,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,America and England is illustrating certain general tendencies which not
6831,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"only sharpen the point of the old attack, but also hearten the spirit of"
6832,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,the defenders of lyric poetry.

6844,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,instead of withering and starving them; she lets them rule instead of
6845,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"ruling them."" ""Did we not imply,"" asks the Athenian Stranger in Plato's"
6846,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"_Laws_, ""that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing what is"
6847,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"good or evil?"" ""There is also,"" says Socrates in the Phoedrus, ""a third"
6848,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"kind of madness, which is the possession of the Muses; this enters into a"
6849,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"delicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring frenzy, awakens lyric and"
6850,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"all other members."" This Platonic notion of lyric ""inspiration"" and"
6851,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""possession"" permeates the immortal passage of the _Ion_:"
6852,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
6853,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""For all good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful"
6854,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"poems not as works of art, but because they are inspired and possessed."
6855,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,And as the Corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right
6856,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"mind, so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are"
6857,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,composing their beautiful strains: but when falling under the power of
6858,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,music and metre they are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens
6859,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"who draw milk and honey from the rivers, when they are under the"

6861,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"the soul of the lyric poet does the same, as they themselves tell us;"
6862,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,for they tell us that they gather their strains from honied fountains
6863,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"out of the gardens and dells of the Muses; thither, like the bees, they"
6864,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,wing their way. And this is true. For the poet is a light and winged and
6865,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired"
6866,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when he has"
6867,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"not attained to this state, he is powerless and is to utter his oracles."
6868,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Many are the noble words in which poets speak of actions like your own
6869,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Words about Homer; but they do not speak of them by any rules of art:
6870,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,only when they make that to which the Muse impels them are their
6871,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"inventions inspired; and then one of them will make dithyrambs, another"
6872,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"hymns of praise, another choral strains, another epic or iambic"
6873,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,verses--and he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of
6874,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"verse: for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine. Had he"
6875,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"learned by rules of art, he would have known how to speak not of one"
6876,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the minds of poets,"
6877,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy"
6878,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"prophets, in order that we who hear them may know that they speak not of"

6936,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
6937,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""We think that as civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily"

6941,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Hence the vocabulary of an enlightened society is philosophical, that of"
6942,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,a half-civilized people is poetical....  In proportion as men know more

6960,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""A poet in our times is a semi-barbarian in a civilized community. He"

6963,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,exploded superstitions. The march of his intellect is like that of a

6966,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"exaggerated feeling, and the cant of factitious sentiment; and can"

7032,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"so much an argument against the lyric as such, as it is an explanation of"
7033,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,the ineffectiveness of certain lyric poems. This defect is not primarily
7034,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"that they lack ""magnitude,"" but rather that they lack an adequate basis in"
7035,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,our emotional adjustment to the fact or situation upon which they turn.
7036,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,The reader is not prepared for the effect which they convey. The art of
7037,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,the drama was defined by the younger Dumas as the art of preparation. Now
7038,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"the lyrics which are most effective in primarily dramatic compositions,"
7039,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"let us say the songs in ""Pippa Passes"" or Ariel's songs in _The Tempest_,"
7040,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,are those where the train of emotional association or contrast has been
7041,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,carefully laid and is waiting to be touched off. So it is with the
7042,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"markedly lyrical passages in narrative verse--say the close of ""Sohrab and"
7043,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Rustum."" When a French actress sings the ""Marseillaise"" to a theatre"
7044,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"audience in war-time, or Sir Harry Lauder, dressed in kilts, sings"

7047,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,of a mood already stimulated. But when one comes upon an isolated lyric
7048,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"printed as a ""filler"" at the bottom of a magazine page, there is no train"
7049,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,of emotional association whatever. There is no lyric mood waiting to
7050,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"respond to a ""lyric cry."" To overcome this obstacle, Walter Page and other"

7052,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"all the verse together, instead of scattering it according to the"
7053,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"exigencies of the ""make-up."" Miss Monroe's _Poetry_, _Contemporary Verse_,"
7054,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"and the other periodicals devoted exclusively to poetry, easily avoid this"
7055,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,handicap of intruding prose. One turns their pages as he turns leaves of
7056,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,music until he finds some composition in accordance with his mood of the

7058,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"in which the lyrical mood may easily come to its own, based and reinforced"
7059,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"as it is by the larger poetical structure. The isolated magazine lyric, on"

7082,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"handling of local and historic American material, was far healthier stuff"
7083,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,for a poet to work with.
7084,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7085,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"This objection to the lyric as an encourager of subjective excitement, of"
7086,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"egoistic introspection, like the other objections already stated, is one"
7087,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,of old standing. Goethe remarked that the subjectivity of the smaller
7088,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"poets was of no significance, but that they were interested in nothing"
7089,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,really objective. But though this indictment of over-individualism has
7090,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"often been drawn, our own times are a fresh proof of its validity. If the"
7091,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"revelation of personality unites men, the stress upon mere individuality"
7092,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"separates them, and there are countless poets of the day who glory in"
7093,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,their eccentric individualism without remembering that it is only through
7094,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,a richly developed personality that poetry gains any universal values.
7095,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""Nothing in literature is so perishable as eccentricity, with regard to"
7096,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,which each generation has its own requirements and its own standard of
7097,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,taste; and the critic who urges contemporary poets to make their work as
7098,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,individual as possible is deliberately inviting them to build their
7099,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"structures on sand instead of rock."""
7100,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"[Footnote: Edmond Holmes, _What is Poetry_, p. 68.]"
7101,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Every reader of contemporary poetry is aware that along with its
7102,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,exhilarating freshness and force there has been a display of singularity
7103,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,and of silly nudity both of body and mind. Too intimate confidences have
7104,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,been betrayed in the lyric confessional. It is a fine thing to see a
7105,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Varsity eight take their dip in the river at the end of an afternoon's
7106,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,spin. Those boys strip well. But there are middle-aged poets who strip
7107,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,very badly. Nature never intended them to play the role of Narcissus.
7108,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Dickens wrote great novels in a room so hung with mirrors that he could
7109,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,watch himself in the act of composition. But that is not the best sort of
7110,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"writing-room for lyric poets, particularly in a decade when acute"
7111,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"self-consciousness, race-consciousness and even coterie-consciousness are"
7112,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"exploited for commercial purposes, and the ""lutanists of October"" are duly"
7113,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,photographed at their desks.

7116,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,5. _Mere Technique_
7117,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7118,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,There is one other count in the old indictment of the lyric which is sure
7119,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"to be emphasized whenever any generation, like our own, shows a new"
7120,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,technical curiosity about lyric forms. It is this: that mere technique
7121,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"will ""carry"" a lyric, even though thought, passion and imagination be"
7122,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"lacking. This charge will inevitably be made from time to time, and not"
7123,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,merely by the persons who naturally tend to stress the content-value of
7124,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"poetry as compared with its form-value. It was Stedman, who was peculiarly"
7125,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"susceptible to the charm of varied lyric form, who remarked of some of"
7126,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Poe's lyrics, ""The libretto (i.e. the sense) is nothing, the score is all"
7127,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"in all."" And it must be admitted that the ""libretto"" of ""Ulalume,"" for"
7128,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"instance, is nearly or quite meaningless to many lovers of poetry who"
7129,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"value the ""score"" very highly. In a period marked by enthusiasm for new"
7130,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"experiments in versification, new feats of technique, the borderland"
7131,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,between real conquests of novel territory and sheer nonsense verse
7132,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"becomes very hazy. The _Spectra_ hoax, perpetrated so cleverly in 1916 by"
7133,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Mr. Ficke and Mr. Witter Bynner, fooled many of the elect."
7134,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"[Footnote: See Untermeyer's _New Era_, etc., pp. 320-23.]"
7135,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,I have never believed that Emerson meant to decry Poe when he referred to
7136,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"him as ""the jingle-man."" Emerson's memory for names was faulty, and he was"
7137,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,trying to indicate the author of the
7138,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7139,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"""tintinnabulation of the bells."""
7140,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7141,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"That Poe was a prestidigitator with verse, and may be regarded solely with"
7142,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"a view to his professional expertness, is surely no ground for disparaging"
7143,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,him as a poet. But it is the kind of penalty which extraordinary technical
7144,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,expertness has to pay in all the arts. Many persons remember Paganini only
7145,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"as the violinist who could play upon a single string. Every ""_amplificolor"
7146,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"imperii_""--every widener of the bounds of the empire of poetry, like"
7147,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Vachel Lindsay with his experiments in chanted verse, Robert Frost with"
7148,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"his subtle renderings of the cadences of actual speech, Miss Amy Lowell"
7149,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"with her doctrine of ""curves"" and ""returns"" and polyphony--runs the risk"
7150,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,of being regarded for a while as a technician and nothing more. Ultimately
7151,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,a finer balance is struck between the claims of form and content: the
7152,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"ideas of a poet, his total vision of life, his contribution to the thought"
7153,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"as well as to the craftsmanship of his generation, are thrown into the"
7154,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,scale. Victor Hugo is now seen to be something far other than the mere
7155,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,amazing lyric virtuoso of the _Odes et Ballades_ of 1826. Walt Whitman
7156,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"ultimately gets judged as Walt Whitman, and not merely as the inventor"
7157,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"of a new type of free verse in 1855. A rough justice is done at last, no"
7158,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"doubt, but for a long time the cleverest and most original manipulators of"
7159,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,words and tunes are likely to be judged by their virtuosity alone.

7162,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,_6. The Lines of Defence_
7163,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7164,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,The objections to lyric poetry which have just been rehearsed are of
7165,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,varying degrees of validity. They have been mentioned here because they
7166,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"still affect, more or less, the judgment of the general public as it"
7167,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,endeavors to estimate the value of the contemporary lyric. I have little
7168,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,confidence in the taste of professed admirers of poetry who can find no
7169,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"pleasure in contemporary verse, and still less confidence in the taste of"
7170,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"our contemporaries whose delight in the ""new era"" has made them deaf to"
7171,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,the great poetic voices of the past. I am sorry for the traditionalist who
7172,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,cannot enjoy Robert Frost and Edwin Arlington Robinson and Edgar Lee
7173,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Masters and Carl Sandburg. He is, in my opinion, in a parlous state. But"
7174,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"the state of the young rebel who cannot enjoy ""Lycidas"" and ""The Progress"
7175,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"of Poesy"" and the ""Ode to Dejection"" is worse than parlous. It is"
7176,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,hopeless.
7177,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7178,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"It is not for him, therefore, that these final paragraphs are written, but"
7179,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,rather for those lovers of poetry who recognize that it transcends all
7180,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"purely moralistic and utilitarian, as it does all historical and technical"
7181,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"considerations,--that it lifts the reader into a serene air where beauty"
7182,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"and truth abide, while the perplexed generations of men appear and"
7183,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,disappear. Sidney and Campion and Daniel pleaded its cause for the
7184,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Elizabethans, Coleridge and Wordsworth and Shelley defended it against the"
7185,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Georgian Philistines, Carlyle, Newman and Arnold championed it through"
7186,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"every era of Victorian materialism. In the twentieth century, critics like"
7187,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Mackail and A. C. Bradley and Rhys, poets like Newbolt and Drinkwater and"
7188,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,Masefield--to say nothing of living poets and critics among our own
7189,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"countrymen--have spoken out for poetry with a knowledge, a sympathy and an"
7190,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"eloquence unsurpassed in any previous epoch. The direct ""Defence of"
7191,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"Poetry"" may safely be left to such men as these."
7192,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,
7193,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"I have chosen, rather, the line of indirect vindication of poetry, and"
7194,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"particularly of the lyric, which has been attempted in this book. We have"
7195,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,seen that the same laws are perpetually at work in poetry as in all the
7196,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,other arts; that we have to do with the transmission of a certain kind of
7197,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,feeling through a certain medium; that the imagination remoulds the
7198,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"material proffered by the senses, and brings into order the confused and"
7199,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"broken thoughts of the mind, until it presents the eternal aspect of"
7200,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,things through words that dance to music. We have seen that the study of
7201,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"poetry leads us back to the psychic life of primitive races, to the"
7202,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"origins of language and of society, and to the underlying spirit of"
7203,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"institutions and nationalities, so that even a fragment of surviving lyric"
7204,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,verse may be recognized as a part of those unifying and dividing
7205,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"forces that make up the life of the world. We have found poetry,"
7206,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"furthermore, to be the great personal mode of literary expression, a"
7207,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"revelation of noble personality as well as base, and that this personal"
7208,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,mode of expression has continued to hold its own in the modern world. The
7209,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"folk-epic is gone, the art-epic has been outstripped by prose fiction, and"
7210,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"the drama needs a theatre. But the lyric needs only a _poet_, who can"
7211,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,compose in any of its myriad forms. No one who knows contemporary
7212,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,literature will deny that the lyric is now interpreting the finer spirit
7213,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"of science, the drift of social progress, and above all, the instincts of"
7214,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"personal emotion. Through it to-day, as never before in the history of"
7215,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"civilization, the heart of a man can reach the heart of mankind. It is"
7216,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,inconceivable that the lyric will not grow still more significant
7217,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"with time, freighted more and more deeply with thought and passion and"
7218,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"touched with a richer and more magical beauty. Some appreciation of it, no"
7219,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,"matter how inadequate, should be a part of the spiritual possessions of"
7220,THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC,every civilized man.'

7233,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,I add here some suggestions to teachers who may wish to use this book in
7234,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,the classroom. In connection with each chapter I have indicated the more
7235,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,important discussions of the special topic. There is also some additional
7236,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"illustrative material, and I have indicated a few hints for classroom"

7239,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,
7240,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,I have tried to keep in mind the needs of two kinds of college courses in
7241,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"poetry. One of them is the general introductory course, which usually"
7242,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"begins with the lyric rather than with the epic or the drama, and which"
7243,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,utilizes some such collection as the _Golden Treasury_ or the _Oxford Book
7244,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"of English Verse_. Any such collection of standard verse, or any of the"
7245,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"anthologies of recent poetry, like those selected by Miss Jessie B."
7246,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"Rittenhouse or Mr. W. S. Braithwaite, should be constantly in use in the"
7247,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,classroom as furnishing concrete illustration of the principles discussed
7248,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,in books like mine.
7249,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,
7250,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,The other kind of course which I have had in mind is the one dealing with
7251,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"the works of a single poet. Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Tennyson,"
7252,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"Browning, are among the poets most frequently chosen for this sort of"
7253,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,study. I have found it an advantage to carry on the discussion of the
7254,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,general principles of poetic imagination and expression in connection with
7255,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,the close textual study of the complete work of any one poet. It is hoped
7256,NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS,that this book may prove helpful for such a purpose.

7264,CHAPTER I,"_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, and Sidney Colvin's article on ""The Fine"

7269,CHAPTER I,commended to those advanced students who have not time to read his
7270,CHAPTER I,"voluminous _History of Aesthetic_, just as Lane Cooper's translation of"

7272,CHAPTER I,the more elaborate discussions in Butcher's _Aristotle's Theory of Poetry
7273,CHAPTER I,"and Fine Art_. In the same way, Spingarn's _Creative Criticism_ is a good"
7274,CHAPTER I,preparation for Croce's monumental _Aesthetics_. The student should
7275,CHAPTER I,"certainly make some acquaintance with Lessing's _Laokoon_, and he will"

7282,CHAPTER I,"classroom discussions may begin with chapter II. I have found, however,"

7298,CHAPTER II,"Hayes's ""Relation of Music to Poetry"" (_Atlantic_, January, 1914) is"
7299,CHAPTER II,pertinent to this chapter. But the student should certainly familiarize
7300,CHAPTER II,"himself with Theodore Watts-Dunton's famous article on ""Poetry"" in"
7301,CHAPTER II,"the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, now reprinted with additions in his"
7302,CHAPTER II,_Renascence of Wonder_. He should also read A. C. Bradley's chapter on

7349,CHAPTER III,The following quotation from Lascelles-Abercrombie's study of Thomas Hardy

7352,CHAPTER III,
7353,CHAPTER III,"""Man's intercourse with the world is necessarily formative. His"
7354,CHAPTER III,experience of things outside his consciousness is in the manner of a
7355,CHAPTER III,"chemistry, wherein some energy of his nature is mated with the energy"
7356,CHAPTER III,"brought in on his nerves from externals, the two combining into"
7357,CHAPTER III,"something which exists only in, or perhaps we should say closely around,"
7358,CHAPTER III,man's consciousness. Thus what man knows of the world is what has been
7359,CHAPTER III,_formed_ by the mixture of his own nature with the streaming in of the
7360,CHAPTER III,"external world. This formative energy of his, reducing the in-coming"
7361,CHAPTER III,world into some constant manner of appearance which may be appreciable
7362,CHAPTER III,"by consciousness, is most conveniently to be described, it seems, as an"
7363,CHAPTER III,"unaltering imaginative desire: desire which accepts as its material, and"
7364,CHAPTER III,"fashions itself forth upon, the many random powers sent by the world to"
7365,CHAPTER III,invade man's mind. That there is this formative energy in man may easily
7366,CHAPTER III,"be seen by thinking of certain dreams; those dreams, namely, in which"
7367,CHAPTER III,some disturbance outside the sleeping brain (such as a sound of knocking
7368,CHAPTER III,or a bodily discomfort) is completely formed into vivid trains of
7369,CHAPTER III,"imagery, and in that form only is presented to the dreamer's"
7370,CHAPTER III,"consciousness. This, however, merely shows the presence of the active"
7371,CHAPTER III,desire to shape sensation into what consciousness can accept; the dream
7372,CHAPTER III,is like an experiment done in the isolation of a laboratory; there are
7373,CHAPTER III,so many conflicting factors when we are awake that the events of sleep
7374,CHAPTER III,must only serve as a symbol or diagram of the intercourse of mind with
7375,CHAPTER III,that which is not mind--intercourse which only takes place in a region
7376,CHAPTER III,where the outward radiations of man's nature combine with the
7377,CHAPTER III,irradiations of the world. Perception itself is a formative act; and all
7378,CHAPTER III,"the construction of sensation into some orderly, coherent idea of the"
7379,CHAPTER III,world is a further activity of the central imaginative desire. Art is
7380,CHAPTER III,"created, and art is enjoyed, because in it man may himself completely"
7381,CHAPTER III,express and exercise those inmost desires which in ordinary experience
7382,CHAPTER III,are by no means to be completely expressed. Life has at last been
7383,CHAPTER III,perfectly formed and measured to man's requirements; and in art man
7384,CHAPTER III,knows himself truly the master of his existence. It is this sense of

8119,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,[Reference books for the study of the technique of the drama are easily
8120,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,available. As preparatory work it will be well to make a careful study of
8121,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"Tennyson's dramatic monologues, both in the earlier and later periods."
8122,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,These throw a good deal of light upon his skill in making characters
8123,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"delineate themselves, and they reveal incidentally some of his methods of"
8124,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"dramatic narrative. For this paper, however, please confine your criticism"
8125,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"to ""Queen Mary,"" ""Harold,"" ""Becket,"" ""The Cup,"" ""The Falcon,"" ""The Promise"
8126,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"of May,"" and ""The Foresters."" In studying ""Becket,"" compare Irving's stage"
8127,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,version of the play (Macmillan).]
8128,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8129,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,A. Classify the themes of Tennyson's dramas. Do you think that these
8130,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,themes offer promising dramatic material? Do you regard Tennyson's
8131,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,previous literary experience as a help or a hindrance to success in the
8132,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,drama?
8133,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8134,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"_Nature._ Apply what is suggested under this head in Topics I, II, and"
8135,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"III, to drama."
8136,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8137,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,_Man._ Apply to the dramas what is suggested under this head in Topics II
8138,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"and III, especially as regards the observation of character, the"
8139,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"conception of characters in collision, and the sense of the variety of"
8140,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,human relationships. Do these plays give evidence of a genuine comic
8141,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,sense? What tragic forces seem to have made the most impression upon
8142,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"Tennyson? Give illustrations, from the plays, of the conflict of the"
8143,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,individual with institutions.
8144,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8145,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,_God._ Comment upon Tennyson's doctrine of necessity and retribution. Does
8146,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,his allotment of poetic justice show a sympathy with the moral order of
8147,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"the world? Are these plays in harmony with Tennyson's theology, as"
8148,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,indicated elsewhere in his work? Do they contain any clear exposition of
8149,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,the problems of the religious life?
8150,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8151,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"B. Compare Topic II, B. In the historical dramas, can you trace the"
8152,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,influence of the poet's own personality in giving color to historical
8153,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,personages? Compare Tennyson's delineation of any of these personages with
8154,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"that of other poets, novelists, or historians. Do you think he has the"
8155,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"power of creating a character, in the same sense as Shakespeare had it?"
8156,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"How much of his dramatic work do you consider purely objective, i. e.,"
8157,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,untinged by what was called the lyric egoism?
8158,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,
8159,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,C. What may be said in general of Tennyson's handling of the dramatic
8160,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"form? Has he ""the dramatic sense""? Of his management of the web of"
8161,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,circumstance in which the characters are involved and brought into
8162,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,conflict? Comment upon his technical skill as displayed in the different
8163,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"""parts"" and ""moments"" of his dramas. Does his exhibition of action fulfill"
8164,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,dramatic requirements? Is his vocabulary suited to stage purposes? Give
8165,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,instances of his purely lyric and narrative gifts as incidentally
8166,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,illustrated in his dramas. Instance passages that cannot in your opinion
8167,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"be successfully acted. In your reading of these plays, or observation of"
8168,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"any of them that you have seen acted, are you conscious of the absence of"
8169,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,any quality or qualities that would heighten the pleasure they yield you?
8170,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,"Taken as a whole, is the form of the various plays artistically in"
8171,TENNYSON'S DRAMAS,harmony with the themes employed?
