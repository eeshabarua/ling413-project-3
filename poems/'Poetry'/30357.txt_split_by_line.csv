39,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
40,PREFACE.,
41,PREFACE.,
42,PREFACE.,"Many editions of Gray have been published in the last fifty years,"
43,PREFACE.,"some of them very elegant, and some showing considerable editorial"
44,PREFACE.,"labor, but not one, so far as I am aware, critically exact either in"
45,PREFACE.,text or in notes. No editor since Mathias (A.D. 1814) has given the
46,PREFACE.,2d line of the _Elegy_ as Gray wrote and printed it; while Mathias's
47,PREFACE.,"mispunctuation of the 123d line has been copied by his successors,"
48,PREFACE.,almost without exception. Other variations from the early editions
49,PREFACE.,are mentioned in the notes.
50,PREFACE.,
51,PREFACE.,It is a curious fact that the most accurate edition of Gray's
52,PREFACE.,"collected poems is the _editio princeps_ of 1768, printed under his"
53,PREFACE.,"own supervision. The first edition of the two Pindaric odes, _The"
54,PREFACE.,"Progress of Poesy_ and _The Bard_ (Strawberry-Hill, 1757), was"
55,PREFACE.,"printed with equal care, and the proofs were probably read by the"
56,PREFACE.,"poet. The text of the present edition has been collated, line by"
57,PREFACE.,"line, with that of these early editions, and in no instance have I"
58,PREFACE.,"adopted a later reading. All the MS. variations, and the various"
59,PREFACE.,"readings I have noted in the modern editions, are given in the notes."
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,"Pickering's edition of 1835, edited by Mitford, has been followed"
62,PREFACE.,"blindly in nearly all the more recent editions, and its many errors"
63,PREFACE.,"(see pp. 84 and 105, foot-notes) have been faithfully reproduced."
64,PREFACE.,"Even its blunders in the ""indenting"" of the lines in the"
65,PREFACE.,"corresponding stanzas of the two Pindaric odes, which any careful"
66,PREFACE.,"proof-reader ought to have corrected, have been copied again and"
67,PREFACE.,"again--as in the Boston (1853) reprint of Pickering, the pretty"
68,PREFACE.,"little edition of Bickers & Son (London, n. d.), the fac-simile of"
69,PREFACE.,"the latter printed at our University Press, Cambridge (1866), etc."
70,PREFACE.,
71,PREFACE.,"Of former editions of Gray, the only one very fully annotated is"
72,PREFACE.,"Mitford's (Pickering, 1835), already mentioned. I have drawn freely"
73,PREFACE.,"from that, correcting many errors, and also from Wakefield's and"
74,PREFACE.,"Mason's editions, and from Hales's notes (_Longer English Poems_,"
75,PREFACE.,"London, 1872) on the _Elegy_ and the Pindaric odes. To all this"
76,PREFACE.,material many original notes and illustrations have been added.
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,The facts concerning the first publication of the _Elegy_ are not
79,PREFACE.,"given correctly by any of the editors, and even the ""experts"" of"
80,PREFACE.,_Notes and Queries_ have not been able to disentangle the snarl of
81,PREFACE.,conflicting evidence. I am not sure that I have settled the question
82,PREFACE.,"myself (see p. 74 and foot-note), but I have at least shown that Gray"
83,PREFACE.,is a more credible witness in the case than any of his critics. Their
84,PREFACE.,testimony is obviously inconsistent and inconclusive; he may have
85,PREFACE.,"confounded the names of two magazines, but that remains to be"
86,PREFACE.,proved.[1]
87,PREFACE.,
88,PREFACE.,"[Footnote 1: Since writing the above to-day, I have found by the"
89,PREFACE.,"merest chance in my own library another bit of evidence in the case,"
90,PREFACE.,which fully confirms my surmise that the _Elegy_ was printed in _The
91,PREFACE.,Magazine of Magazines_ before it appeared in the _Grand Magazine of
92,PREFACE.,"Magazines_. _Chambers's Book of Days_ (vol. ii. p. 146), in an"
93,PREFACE.,"article on ""Gray and his Elegy,"" says:"
94,PREFACE.,
95,PREFACE.,"""It first saw the light in _The Magazine of Magazines_, February,"
96,PREFACE.,1751. Some imaginary literary wag is made to rise in a convivial
97,PREFACE.,"assembly, and thus announce it: 'Gentlemen, give me leave to soothe"
98,PREFACE.,"my own melancholy, and amuse you in a most noble manner, with a full"
99,PREFACE.,"copy of verses by the very ingenious Mr. Gray, of Peterhouse,"
100,PREFACE.,Cambridge. They are stanzas written in a country churchyard.' Then
101,PREFACE.,"follow the verses. A few days afterwards, Dodsley's edition"
102,PREFACE.,"appeared,"" etc."
103,PREFACE.,
104,PREFACE.,The same authority gives the four stanzas omitted after the 18th (see
105,PREFACE.,"p. 79) as they appear in the _North American Review_, except that the"
106,PREFACE.,"first line of the third is ""Hark how the sacred calm that _reigns_"
107,PREFACE.,"around,"" a reading which I have found nowhere else. The stanza ""There"
108,PREFACE.,"scattered oft,"" etc. (p. 81), is given as in the review. The reading"
109,PREFACE.,on p. 82 must be a later one.]
110,PREFACE.,
111,PREFACE.,"I have retained most of the ""parallel passages"" from the poets given"
112,PREFACE.,"by the editors, and have added others, without regard to the critics"
113,PREFACE.,who have sneered at this kind of annotations. Whether Gray borrowed
114,PREFACE.,"from the others, or the others from him, matters little; very likely,"
115,PREFACE.,"in most instances, neither party was consciously the borrower. Gray,"
116,PREFACE.,"in his own notes, has acknowledged certain debts to other poets, and"
117,PREFACE.,probably these were all that he was aware of. Some of these he
118,PREFACE.,contracted unwittingly (see what he says of one of them in a letter
119,PREFACE.,"to Walpole, quoted in the note on the _Ode on the Spring_, 31), and"
120,PREFACE.,the same may have been true of some apparently similar cases pointed
121,PREFACE.,"out by modern editors. To me, however, the chief interest of these"
122,PREFACE.,coincidences and resemblances of thought or expression is as studies
123,PREFACE.,"in the ""comparative anatomy"" of poetry. The teacher will find them"
124,PREFACE.,"useful as pegs to hang questions upon, or texts for oral instruction."
125,PREFACE.,"The pupil, or the young reader, who finds out who all these poets"
126,PREFACE.,"were, when they lived, what they wrote, etc., will have learned no"
127,PREFACE.,small amount of English literary history. If he studies the
128,PREFACE.,"quotations merely as illustrations of style and expression, or as"
129,PREFACE.,"examples of the poetic diction of various periods, he will have"
130,PREFACE.,learned some lessons in the history and the use of his mother-tongue.

178,THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.,
179,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.
180,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,
181,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,
182,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Thomas Gray, the author of the celebrated _Elegy written in a Country"
183,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Churchyard_, was born in Cornhill, London, December 26, 1716. His"
184,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"father, Philip Gray, an exchange broker and scrivener, was a wealthy"
185,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"and nominally respectable citizen, but he treated his family with"
186,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"brutal severity and neglect, and the poet was altogether indebted for"
187,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,the advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and
188,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"industry of his mother, whose maiden name was Antrobus, and who, in"
189,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"conjunction with a maiden sister, kept a millinery shop. A brother of"
190,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Mrs. Gray was assistant to the Master of Eton, and was also a fellow"
191,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under his protection the poet was"
192,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"educated at Eton, and from thence went to Peterhouse, attending"
193,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"college from 1734 to September, 1738. At Eton he had as"
194,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"contemporaries Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland,"
195,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"and Horace Walpole, son of the triumphant Whig minister, Sir Robert"
196,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Walpole. West died early in his 26th year, but his genius and virtues"
197,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,and his sorrows will forever live in the correspondence of his
198,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"friend. In the spring of 1739, Gray was invited by Horace Walpole to"
199,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,accompany him as travelling companion in a tour through France and
200,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Italy. They made the usual route, and Gray wrote remarks on all he"
201,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"saw in Florence, Rome, Naples, etc. His observations on arts and"
202,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"antiquities, and his sketches of foreign manners, evince his"
203,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"admirable taste, learning, and discrimination. Since Milton, no such"
204,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,accomplished English traveller had visited those classic shores. In
205,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"their journey through Dauphiny, Gray's attention was strongly"
206,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"arrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse,"
207,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"surrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir, its enormous"
208,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"precipices, cliffs, and cascades. He visited it a second time on his"
209,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"return, and in the album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous"
210,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,Alcaic Ode. At Reggio the travellers quarrelled and parted. Walpole
211,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,took the whole blame on himself. He was fond of pleasure and
212,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"amusements, ""intoxicated by vanity, indulgence, and the insolence of"
213,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"his situation as a prime minister's son""--his own confession--while"
214,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Gray was studious, of a serious disposition, and independent spirit."
215,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,The immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole's
216,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"clandestinely opening, reading, and resealing a letter addressed to"
217,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Gray, in which he expected to find a confirmation of his suspicions"
218,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,that Gray had been writing unfavourably of him to some friends in
219,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,England. A partial reconciliation was effected about three years
220,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"afterwards by the intervention of a lady, and Walpole redeemed his"
221,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,youthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his
222,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"friend. From Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice, and thence travelled"
223,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"homewards, attended by a _laquais de voyage_. He arrived in England"
224,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"in September, 1741, having been absent about two years and a half."
225,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"His father died in November, and it was found that the poet's fortune"
226,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,would not enable him to prosecute the study of the law. He therefore
227,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"retired to Cambridge, and fixed his residence at the university."
228,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"There he continued for the remainder of his life, with the exception"
229,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of about two years spent in London, when the treasures of the British"
230,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,Museum were thrown open. At Cambridge he had the range of noble
231,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"libraries. His happiness consisted in study, and he perused with"
232,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"critical attention the Greek and Roman poets, philosophers,"
233,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"historians, and orators. Plato and the Anthologia he read and"
234,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"annotated with great care, as if for publication. He compiled tables"
235,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of Greek chronology, added notes to Linnæus and other naturalists,"
236,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"wrote geographical disquisitions on Strabo; and, besides being"
237,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"familiar with French and Italian literature, was a zealous"
238,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"archæological student, and profoundly versed in architecture, botany,"
239,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"painting, and music. In all departments of human learning, except"
240,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"mathematics, he was a master. But it follows that one so studious, so"
241,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"critical, and so fastidious, could not be a voluminous writer. A few"
242,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,poems include all the original compositions of Gray--the
243,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"quintessence, as it were, of thirty years of ceaseless study and"
244,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"contemplation, irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of inspiration."
245,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"In 1742 Gray composed his _Ode to Spring_, his _Ode on a Distant"
246,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Prospect of Eton College_, and his _Ode to Adversity_--productions"
247,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,which most readers of poetry can repeat from memory. He commenced a
248,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"didactic poem, _On the Alliance of Education and Government_, but"
249,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,wrote only about a hundred lines. Every reader must regret that this
250,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,philosophical poem is but a fragment. It is in the style and measure
251,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of Dryden, of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close student. His"
252,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,_Elegy written in a Country Churchyard_ was completed and published
253,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"in 1751. In the form of a sixpenny _brochure_ it circulated rapidly,"
254,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,four editions being exhausted the first year. This popularity
255,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,surprised the poet. He said sarcastically that it was owing entirely
256,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"to the subject, and that the public would have received it as well if"
257,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,it had been written in prose. The solemn and affecting nature of the
258,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"poem, applicable to all ranks and classes, no doubt aided its sale;"
259,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,it required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to
260,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"appreciate the rapid transitions, the figurative language, and"
261,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,lyrical magnificence of the odes; but the elegy went home to all
262,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"hearts; while its musical harmony, originality, and pathetic train of"
263,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,sentiment and feeling render it one of the most perfect of English
264,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,poems. No vicissitudes of taste or fashion have affected its
265,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,popularity. When the original manuscript of the poem was lately
266,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"(1854) offered for sale, it brought the almost incredible sum of 131"
267,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"pounds. The two great odes of Gray, _The Progress of Poetry_ and _The"
268,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Bard_, were published in 1757, and were but coldly received. His"
269,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"name, however, stood high, and on the death of Cibber, the same year,"
270,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"he was offered the laureateship, which he wisely declined. He was"
271,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"ambitious, however, of obtaining the more congenial and dignified"
272,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,appointment of Professor of Modern History in the University of
273,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Cambridge, which fell vacant in 1762, and, by the advice of his"
274,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"friends, he made application to Lord Bute, but was unsuccessful. Lord"
275,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Bute had designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law, Sir James"
276,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Lowther. No one had heard of the tutor, but the Bute influence was"
277,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"all-prevailing. In 1765 Gray took a journey into Scotland,"
278,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,penetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of Killiecrankie;
279,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"and his account of his tour, in letters to his friends, is replete"
280,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,with interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic
281,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,description. One other poem proceeded from his pen. In 1768 the
282,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Professorship of Modern History was again vacant, and the Duke of"
283,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,Grafton bestowed it upon Gray. A sum of 400 pounds per annum was thus
284,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"added to his income; but his health was precarious--he had lost it,"
285,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"he said, just when he began to be easy in his circumstances. The"
286,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,nomination of the Duke of Grafton to the office of Chancellor of the
287,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,University enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on
288,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,himself. He thought it better that gratitude should sing than
289,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"expectation, and he honoured his grace's installation with an ode."
290,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,Such occasional productions are seldom happy; but Gray preserved his
291,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,poetic dignity and select beauty of expression. He made the founders
292,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of Cambridge, as Mr. Hallam has remarked, ""pass before our eyes like"
293,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"shadows over a magic glass."" When the ceremony of the installation"
294,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"was over, the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of"
295,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Cumberland and Westmoreland, and few of the beauties of the"
296,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"lake-country, since so famous, escaped his observation. This was to"
297,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,be his last excursion. While at dinner one day in the college-hall he
298,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"was seized with an attack of gout in his stomach, which resisted all"
299,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"the powers of medicine, and proved fatal in less than a week. He died"
300,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"on the 30th of July, 1771, and was buried, according to his own"
301,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"desire, beside the remains of his mother at Stoke-Pogis, near Slough,"
302,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"in Buckinghamshire, in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard"
303,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,that is supposed to have furnished the scene of his elegy.[1] The
304,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,literary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us
305,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,from the numerous representations and allusions of his friends. It is
306,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,easy to fancy the recluse-poet sitting in his college-chambers in the
307,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,old quadrangle of Pembroke Hall. His windows are ornamented with
308,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"mignonette and choice flowers in China vases, but outside may be"
309,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"discerned some iron-work intended to be serviceable as a fire-escape,"
310,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,for he has a horror of fire. His furniture is neat and select; his
311,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"books, rather for use than show, are disposed around him. He has a"
312,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,harpsichord in the room. In the corner of one of the apartments is a
313,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"trunk containing his deceased mother's dresses, carefully folded up"
314,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"and preserved. His fastidiousness, bordering upon effeminacy, is"
315,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"visible in his gait and manner--in his handsome features and small,"
316,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"well-dressed person, especially when he walks abroad and sinks the"
317,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"author and hard student in ""the gentleman who sometimes writes for"

321,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"nights feverish from ill-health, are spent in those chambers; he is"
322,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,often listless and in low spirits; yet his natural temper is not

324,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,learn or to communicate--some sally of humour or quiet stroke of
325,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,satire for his friends and correspondents--some note on natural
326,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,history to enter in his journal--some passage of Plato to unfold and
327,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,illustrate--some golden thought of classic inspiration to inlay on
328,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,his page--some bold image to tone down--some verse to retouch and

330,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,of thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over all.

337,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,and his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the place. Gray's
338,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,epitaph on his mother is characterized not only by the tenderness
339,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"with which he always regarded her memory, but by his style and cast"
340,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"of thought. It runs thus: ""Beside her friend and sister here sleep"
341,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"the remains of Dorothy Gray, widow, the careful, tender mother of"
342,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"many children, one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her."

344,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,which was perhaps an ample recompense for her maternal cares and
345,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,affection. Mrs. Gray's will commences in a similar touching strain:
346,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"""In the name of God, amen. This is the last will and desire of"
347,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"Dorothy Gray to her son Thomas Gray."" [Cunningham's edit. of"

350,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"made by the mother to maintain her son at the university, her pride"
351,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"in the talents and conduct of that son, and the increasing gratitude"
352,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"and affection of the latter, nursed in his scholastic and cloistered"
353,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,solitude--these form an affecting but noble record in the history of

356,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"[One would infer from the above that Mrs. Gray was _not_ ""interred in"

358,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,after shows that she _was_. Gray in his will directed that he should
359,BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS.,"be laid beside her there. The passage in the will reads thus: ""First,"

1549,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"This poem was begun in the year 1742, but was not finished until"
1550,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"1750, when Gray sent it to Walpole with a letter (dated June 12,"
1551,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"1750) in which he says: ""I have been here at Stoke a few days (where"
1552,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"I shall continue good part of the summer), and having put an end to a"
1553,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"thing, whose beginning you have seen long ago, I immediately send it"
1554,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"you. You will, I hope, look upon it in the light of a thing with an"
1555,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"end to it: a merit that most of my writings have wanted, and are like"
1556,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"to want."" It was shown in manuscript to some of the author's friends,"
1557,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,and was published in 1751 only because it was about to be printed
1558,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,surreptitiously.
1559,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1560,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"February 11, 1751, Gray wrote to Walpole that the proprietors of ""the"
1561,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Magazine of Magazines"" were about to publish his _Elegy_, and added,"
1562,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""I have but one bad way left to escape the honour they would inflict"
1563,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,upon me; and therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley
1564,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,print it immediately (which may be done in less than a week's time)
1565,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"from your copy, but without my name, in what form is most convenient"
1566,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"for him, but on his best paper and character; he must correct the"
1567,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"press himself,[1] and print it without any interval between the"
1568,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"stanzas, because the sense is in some places continued beyond them;"
1569,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"and the title must be--'Elegy, written in a Country Churchyard.' If"
1570,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by accident,"
1571,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"I should like it better."" Walpole did as requested, and wrote an"
1572,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,advertisement to the effect that accident alone brought the poem
1573,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"before the public, although an apology was unnecessary to any but the"
1574,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"author. On which Gray wrote, ""I thank you for your advertisement,"
1575,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"which saves my honour."""
1576,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1577,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,[Footnote 1: Dodsley's proof-reading must have been somewhat
1578,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"careless, for there are many errors of the press in this _editio"
1579,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"princeps_. Gray writes to Walpole, under date of ""Ash-Wednesday,"
1580,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Cambridge, 1751,"" as follows: ""Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or"
1581,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"two in the cradle, that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long"
1582,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,as it lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her
1583,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"hands before now; and besides, it will only look the more careless"
1584,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"and by _accident_ as it were."" Again, March 3, 1751, he writes: ""I do"
1585,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,not expect any more editions; as I have appeared in more magazines
1586,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,than one. The chief errata were _sacred_ for _secret_; _hidden_ for
1587,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,_kindred_ (in spite of dukes and classics); and '_frowning_ as in
1588,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"scorn' for _smiling_. I humbly propose, for the benefit of Mr."
1589,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Dodsley and his matrons, that take _awake_ [in line 92, which at"
1590,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"first read ""awake and faithful to her wonted fires""] for a verb, that"

1592,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Their _harrow_ oft the stubborn glebe,"" ""And read their _destiny_ in"
1593,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"a nation's eyes,"" ""With uncouth rhymes and shapeless _culture_"
1594,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"decked,"" ""Slow through the churchway _pass_,"" and many of minor"
1595,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,importance.]
1596,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1597,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"A writer in _Notes and Queries_, June 12, 1875, states that the poem"
1598,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"first appeared in the _London Magazine_, March, 1751, p. 134, and"
1599,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that ""the Magazine of Magazines"" is ""a gentle term of scorn used by"
1600,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Gray to indicate"" that periodical, and not the name of any actual"
1601,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"magazine. But in the next number of _Notes and Queries_ (June 19,"

1604,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"number for April, 1751, which contains the _Elegy_. The magazine is"
1605,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"said to be ""collected and digested by Roger Woodville, Esq.,"" and"
1606,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""published by Cooper at the Globe, in Pater Noster Row."""

1608,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,Gray says nothing in his letters of the appearance of the _Elegy_ in
1609,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the _London Magazine_. The full title of that periodical was ""The"
1610,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"London Magazine: or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer."" The editor's"
1611,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"name was not given; the publisher was ""R. Baldwin, jun. at the Rose"
1612,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"in Pater-Noster Row."" The volume for 1751 was the 20th, and the"
1613,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Preface (written at the close of the year) begins thus: ""As the two"

1617,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Reputation for Twenty Years."" A foot-note informs us that the"
1618,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Enemies"" are the ""_Magazine of Magazines_ and _Grand Magazine of"
1619,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Magazines_;"" from which it would appear that there were two"
1620,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,periodicals of similar name published in London in 1751.[2]
1621,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1622,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,[Footnote 2: May not the _Elegy_ have been printed in both of these?
1623,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,We do not know how otherwise to reconcile the conflicting statements
1624,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"concerning the ""Magazine of Magazines,"" as Gray calls it. In the"
1625,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"first place, Gray appears (from other portions of his letter to"
1626,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Walpole) to be familiar with this magazine, and would not be likely"
1627,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"to confound it with another of similar name. Then, as we have seen,"
1628,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,he writes _early in March_ to Walpole that the poem has been printed
1629,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""in more magazines than one."" This cannot refer to the _Grand"
1630,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Magazine of Magazines_, if, as Mr. Locker states, it was the _April_"
1631,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,number of that periodical in which the poem appeared. Nor can it
1632,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"refer to the _London Magazine_, as it is clear from internal evidence"
1633,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that the March number, containing the _Elegy_, was not issued until"
1634,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"early in April. It contains a summary of current news down to Sunday,"
1635,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"March 31, and the price of stocks in the London market for March 30."
1636,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"The _February_ number, in its ""monthly catalogue"" of new books,"
1637,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"records the publication of the _Elegy_ by Dodsley thus: ""An Elegy"

1642,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"case of the latter, perhaps two months) after Dodsley had issued it,"
1643,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,in what magazine was it that it _did_ appear just before he issued
1644,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"it? The _N. A. Review_ says that ""it was a close race between the"
1645,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Magazine and Dodsley; but the former, having a little the start, came"
1646,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"out a few days ahead."" If so, it must have been the _March_ number;"
1647,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"or the _February_ one, if it was published, like the _London_, at the"
1648,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"end of the month. Gray calls it ""the Magazine of Magazines,"" and we"
1649,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,shall take his word for it until we have reason for doubting it. What
1650,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"else was included in his ""more magazines than one"" we cannot even"

1659,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,The author's name is not given with the _Elegy_ as printed in the
1660,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"_London Magazine_. The poem is sandwiched between an ""Epilogue to"

1671,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"The ""Magazine of Magazines"" (as the writer in the _North American"
1672,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,Review_ tells us) printed the _Elegy_ with the author's name. The

1719,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""One peculiar and remarkable tribute to the merit of the _Elegy_,"""
1720,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"says Professor Henry Reed, ""is to be noticed in the great number of"
1721,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"translations which have been made of it into various languages, both"
1722,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,of ancient and modern Europe. It is the same kind of tribute which
1723,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,has been rendered to _Robinson Crusoe_ and to _The Pilgrim's
1724,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Progress_, and is proof of the same universality of interest,"
1725,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,transcending the limits of language and of race. To no poem in the

1731,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Livorno, 1843;' and Van Voorst's London edition."" Professor Reed adds"

1733,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"one in Hebrew, seven in Greek, twelve in Latin, thirteen in Italian,"
1734,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"fifteen in French, six in German, and one in Portuguese."

1736,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Had Gray written nothing but his _Elegy_,"" remarks Byron, ""high as"
1737,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"he stands, I am not sure that he would not stand higher; it is the"

1739,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1740,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"The tribute paid the poem by General Wolfe is familiar to all, but we"
1741,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,cannot refrain from quoting Lord Mahon's beautiful account of it in
1742,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"his _History of England_. On the night of September 13th, 1759, the"
1743,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"night before the battle on the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe was"
1744,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,descending the St. Lawrence with a part of his troops. The historian
1745,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"says: ""Swiftly, but silently, did the boats fall down with the tide,"
1746,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,unobserved by the enemy's sentinels at their posts along the shore.
1747,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Of the soldiers on board, how eagerly must every heart have throbbed"
1748,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,at the coming conflict! how intently must every eye have contemplated
1749,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the dark outline, as it lay pencilled upon the midnight sky, and as"
1750,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"every moment it grew closer and clearer, of the hostile heights! Not"
1751,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,a word was spoken--not a sound heard beyond the rippling of the
1752,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,stream. Wolfe alone--thus tradition has told us--repeated in a low
1753,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,tone to the other officers in his boat those beautiful stanzas with
1754,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"which a country churchyard inspired the muse of Gray. One noble line,"
1755,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1756,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"'The paths of glory lead but to the grave,'"
1757,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1758,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,must have seemed at such a moment fraught with mournful meaning. At
1759,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the close of the recitation Wolfe added, 'Now, gentlemen, I would"
1760,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"rather be the author of that poem than take Quebec.'"""
1761,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1762,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Hales, in his Introduction to the poem, remarks: ""The _Elegy_ is"
1763,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,perhaps the most widely known poem in our language. The reason of
1764,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,this extensive popularity is perhaps to be sought in the fact that it
1765,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,expresses in an exquisite manner feelings and thoughts that are
1766,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,universal. In the current of ideas in the _Elegy_ there is perhaps
1767,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"nothing that is rare, or exceptional, or out of the common way. The"
1768,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,musings are of the most rational and obvious character possible; it
1769,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,is difficult to conceive of any one musing under similar
1770,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,circumstances who should not muse so; but they are not the less deep
1771,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,and moving on this account. The mystery of life does not become
1772,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"clearer, or less solemn and awful, for any amount of contemplation."
1773,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Such inevitable, such everlasting questions as rise on the mind when"
1774,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"one lingers in the precincts of Death can never lose their freshness,"
1775,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"never cease to fascinate and to move. It is with such questions, that"
1776,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"would have been commonplace long ages since if they could ever be so,"
1777,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,that the _Elegy_ deals. It deals with them in no lofty philosophical
1778,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"manner, but in a simple, humble, unpretentious way, always with the"
1779,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,truest and the broadest humanity. The poet's thoughts turn to the
1780,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"poor; he forgets the fine tombs inside the church, and thinks only of"
1781,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,the 'mouldering heaps' in the churchyard. Hence the problem that
1782,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"especially suggests itself is the potential greatness, when they"
1783,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"lived, of the 'rude forefathers' that now lie at his feet. He does"
1784,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"not, and cannot solve it, though he finds considerations to mitigate"
1785,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,the sadness it must inspire; but he expresses it in all its awfulness
1786,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,in the most effective language and with the deepest feeling; and his
1787,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"expression of it has become a living part of our language."""
1788,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1789,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,The writer in the _North American Review_ (vol. 96) from whom we have
1790,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"elsewhere quoted says of the _Elegy_: ""It is upon this that Gray's"
1791,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,fame as a poet must chiefly rest. By this he will be known forever
1792,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"alike to the lettered and the unlettered. Many, in future ages, who"
1793,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"may never have heard of his classic Odes, his various learning, or"
1794,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"his sparkling letters, will revere him only as the author of the"
1795,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,_Elegy_. For this he will be enshrined through all time in the hearts
1796,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,of the myriads who shall speak our English tongue. For this his name
1797,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,will be held in glad remembrance in the far-off summer isles of the
1798,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Pacific, and amidst the waste of polar snows. If he had written"
1799,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"nothing else, his place as a leading poet in our language would still"
1800,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"be assured. Many have asserted, with Johnson, that he was a mere"
1801,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"mechanical poet--one who brought from without, but never found"
1802,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,within; that the gift of inspiration was not native to him; that his
1803,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"imagination was borrowed finery, his fancy tinsel, and his invention"
1804,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,the world's well-worn jewels; that whatever in his verse was poetic
1805,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"was not new, and what was new was not poetic; that he was only an"
1806,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"unworldly dyspeptic, living amid many books, and laboriously delving"
1807,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"for a lifetime between musty covers, picking out now and then"
1808,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"another's gems and bits of ore, and fashioning them into"
1809,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"ill-compacted mosaics, which he wrongly called his own. To all this"
1810,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,the _Elegy_ is a sufficient answer. It is not old--it is not bookish;
1811,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,it is new and human. Books could not make its maker: he was born of
1812,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the divine breath alone. Consider all the commentators, the"
1813,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"scholiasts, the interpreters, the annotators, and other like"
1814,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"book-worms, from Aristarchus down to Döderlein; and may it not be"
1815,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"said that, among them all, 'Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum?'"
1816,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1817,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Gray wrote but little, yet he wrote that little well. He might have"
1818,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"done far more for us; the same is true of most men, even of the"
1819,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,greatest. The possibilities of a life are always in advance of its
1820,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,performance. But we cannot say that his life was a wasted one. Even
1821,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"this little _Elegy_ alone should go for much. For, suppose that he"
1822,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"had never written this, but instead had done much else in other ways,"
1823,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,according to his powers: that he had written many learned treatises;
1824,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that he had, with keen criticism, expounded and reconstructed Greek"
1825,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"classics; that he had, perchance, sat upon the woolsack, and laid"
1826,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,rich offerings at the feet of blind Justice;--taking the years
1827,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"together, would it have been, on the whole, better for him or for us?"
1828,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,Would he have added so much to the sum of human happiness? He might
1829,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"thus have made himself a power for a time, to be dethroned by some"
1830,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,new usurper in the realm of knowledge; now he is a power and a joy

1833,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1834,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Two manuscripts of the _Elegy_, in Gray's handwriting, still exist."
1835,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Both were bequeathed by the poet, together with his library, letters,"
1836,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"and many miscellaneous papers, to his friends the Rev. William Mason"
1837,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"and the Rev. James Browne, as joint literary executors. Mason"
1838,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"bequeathed the entire trust to Mr. Stonhewer. The latter, in making"
1839,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"his will, divided the legacy into two parts. The larger share went to"
1840,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the Master and Fellows of Pembroke Hall. Among the papers, which are"
1841,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"still in the possession of the College, was found a copy of the"
1842,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,_Elegy_. An excellent fac-simile of this manuscript appears in

1849,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"The MS. of the _Elegy_ was bought by Mr. Granville John Penn, of"

1853,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Robert Charles Wrightson, of Birmingham, for 131 pounds. On the 29th"

1901,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Some village Cato, who, with dauntless breast,"
1902,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
1903,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Some mute inglorious Tully here may rest,"
1904,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Some Cæsar guiltless of his country's blood.""[4]"
1905,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1906,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"[Footnote 4: The _Saturday Review_ for June 19, 1875, has a long"
1907,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"article on the change made by Gray in this stanza, entitled, ""A"
1908,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Lesson from Gray's Elegy,"" from which we cull the following"
1909,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,paragraphs:
1910,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1911,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""Gray, having first of all put down the names of three Romans as"
1912,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"illustrations of his meaning, afterwards deliberately struck them out"
1913,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,and put the names of three Englishmen instead. This is a sign of a
1914,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"change in the taste of the age, a change with which Gray himself had"
1915,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"a good deal to do. The deliberate wiping out of the names of Cato,"
1916,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Tully, and Cæsar, to put in the names of Hampden, Milton, and"
1917,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Cromwell, seems to us so obviously a change for the better that there"
1918,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,seems to be no room for any doubt about it. It is by no means certain
1919,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,that Gray's own contemporaries would have thought the matter equally
1920,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,clear. We suspect that to many people in his day it must have seemed
1921,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"a daring novelty to draw illustrations from English history,"
1922,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"especially from parts of English history which, it must be"
1923,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"remembered, were then a great deal more recent than they are now. To"
1924,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"be sure, in choosing English illustrations, a poet of Gray's time was"
1925,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,in rather a hard strait. If he chose illustrations from the century
1926,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"or two before his own time, he could only choose names which had"
1927,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"hardly got free from the strife of recent politics. If, in a poem of"
1928,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the nature of the Elegy, he had drawn illustrations from earlier"
1929,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"times of English history, he would have found but few people in his"
1930,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,day likely to understand him....
1931,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
1932,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"""The change which Gray made in this well-known stanza is not only an"
1933,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"improvement in a particular poem, it is a sign of a general"
1934,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,improvement in taste. He wrote first according to the vicious taste
1935,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"of an earlier time, and he then changed it according to his own"
1936,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,better taste. And of that better taste he was undoubtedly a prophet
1937,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,to others. Gray's poetry must have done a great deal to open men's
1938,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"eyes to the fact that they were Englishmen, and that on them, as"
1939,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Englishmen, English things had a higher claim than Roman, and that to"
1940,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,them English examples ought to be more speaking than Roman ones. But
1941,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,there is another side of the case not to be forgotten. Those who
1942,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"would have regretted the change from Cato, Tully, and Cæsar to"
1943,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell, those who perhaps really did think"
1944,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that the bringing in of Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell was a"
1945,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"degradation of what they would have called the Muse, were certainly"
1946,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"not those who had the truest knowledge of Cato, Tully, and Cæsar. The"
1947,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,'classic' taste from which Gray helped to deliver us was a taste
1948,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,which hardly deserves to be called a taste. Pardonable perhaps in the
1949,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"first heat of the Renaissance, when 'classic' studies and objects had"
1950,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the charm of novelty, it had become by his day a mere silly"
1951,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"fashion.""]"

2049,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"made from any objection to the stanza in itself, but simply because"
2050,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,it was too long a parenthesis in this place; on the principle which

2152,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,Several localities have contended for the honor of being the scene of
2153,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"the _Elegy_, but the general sentiment has always, and justly, been"
2154,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,in favor of Stoke-Pogis. It was there that Gray began the poem in
2155,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"1742; and there, as we have seen, he finished it in 1750. In that"
2156,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"churchyard his mother was buried, and there, at his request, his own"
2157,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"remains were afterwards laid beside her. The scene is, moreover, in"
2158,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,all respects in perfect keeping with the spirit of the poem.
2159,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
2160,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"According to the common Cambridge tradition, Granchester, a parish"
2161,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"about two miles southwest of the University, to which Gray was in the"
2162,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"habit of taking his ""constitutional"" daily, is the locality of the"
2163,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"poem; and the great bell of St. Mary's is the ""curfew"" of the first"
2164,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"stanza. Another tradition makes a similar claim for Madingley, some"
2165,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,three miles and a half northwest of Cambridge. Both places have
2166,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,churchyards such as the _Elegy_ describes; and this is about all that
2167,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,can be said in favor of their pretensions. There is also a parish
2168,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"called Burnham Beeches, in Buckinghamshire, which one writer at least"
2169,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"has suggested as the scene of the poem, but for no better reason than"
2170,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that Gray once wrote a description of the place to Walpole, and"
2171,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"casually mentioned the existence of certain ""beeches,"" at the foot of"
2172,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"which he would ""squat,"" and ""there grow to the trunk a whole"
2173,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"morning."" Gray's uncle had a seat in the neighborhood, and the poet"
2174,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"often visited here, but the spot was not hallowed to him by the fond"
2175,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,and tender associations that gathered about Stoke.
2176,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
2177,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,
2178,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"1. _The curfew_. Hales remarks: ""It is a great mistake to suppose"
2179,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"that the ringing of the curfew was, at its institution, a mark of"

2242,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,indubitable error of the type in the entire volume. Certain
2243,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"peculiarities of spelling were probably intentional, as we find the"
2244,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,like in the fac-similes of the poet's manuscripts. The many

2246,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"(according to the received texts of the time), and the references to"
2247,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"authorities, so far as we have verified them, are equally exact. The"
2248,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,book throughout bears the marks of Gray's scholarly and critical

2250,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,"form which he meant they should retain. In doubtful cases, therefore,"
2251,ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.,we have generally followed this edition. Mason's (the _second_

3680,MDCCLVII.,uniform but symmetrical. The nine stanzas of each ode form three
3681,MDCCLVII.,"groups. A slight examination will show that the 1st, 4th, and 7th"
3682,MDCCLVII.,"stanzas are exactly inter-correspondent; so the 2d, 5th, and 8th; and"
3683,MDCCLVII.,so the remaining three. The technical Greek names for these three
3684,MDCCLVII.,"parts were [Greek: strophê] (strophe), [Greek: antistrophê]"
3685,MDCCLVII.,"(antistrophe), and [Greek: epôdos] (epodos)--the Turn, the"
3686,MDCCLVII.,"Counter-turn, and the After-song--names derived from the theatre; the"
3687,MDCCLVII.,Turn denoting the movement of the Chorus from one side of the [Greek:

3690,MDCCLVII.,after two such movements. Odes thus constructed were called by the
3691,MDCCLVII.,Greeks Epodic. Congreve is said to have been the first who so
3692,MDCCLVII.,constructed English odes. This system cannot be said to have
3693,MDCCLVII.,prospered with us. Perhaps no English ear would instinctively
3694,MDCCLVII.,recognize that correspondence between distant parts which is the
3695,MDCCLVII.,secret of it. Certainly very many readers of _The Progress of Poesy_

4273,(A.D. 1633):,of it:[4]
4274,(A.D. 1633):,
4275,(A.D. 1633):,"""My process has now brought me to the _wonderful_ 'Wonder of"
4276,(A.D. 1633):,"Wonders,' the two Sister Odes, by which, though either vulgar"
4277,(A.D. 1633):,"ignorance or common-sense at first universally rejected them, many"
4278,(A.D. 1633):,have been since persuaded to think themselves delighted. I am one of
4279,(A.D. 1633):,"those that are willing to be pleased, and therefore would gladly find"
4280,(A.D. 1633):,the meaning of the first stanza of 'The Progress of Poetry.'
4281,(A.D. 1633):,
4282,(A.D. 1633):,"""Gray seems in his rapture to confound the images of spreading sound"
4283,(A.D. 1633):,and running water. A 'stream of music' may be allowed; but where does
4284,(A.D. 1633):,"'music,' however 'smooth and strong,' after having visited the"
4285,(A.D. 1633):,"'verdant vales, roll down the steep amain,' so as that 'rocks and"
4286,(A.D. 1633):,"nodding groves rebellow to the roar?' If this be said of music, it is"
4287,(A.D. 1633):,"nonsense; if it be said of water, it is nothing to the purpose."
4288,(A.D. 1633):,
4289,(A.D. 1633):,"""The second stanza, exhibiting Mars's car and Jove's eagle, is"
4290,(A.D. 1633):,unworthy of further notice. Criticism disdains to chase a schoolboy
4291,(A.D. 1633):,to his commonplaces.
4292,(A.D. 1633):,
4293,(A.D. 1633):,"""To the third it may likewise be objected that it is drawn from"
4294,(A.D. 1633):,"mythology, though such as may be more easily assimilated to real"
4295,(A.D. 1633):,life. Idalia's 'velvet-green' has something of cant. An epithet or
4296,(A.D. 1633):,metaphor drawn from Nature ennobles Art; an epithet or metaphor drawn
4297,(A.D. 1633):,from Art degrades Nature. Gray is too fond of words arbitrarily
4298,(A.D. 1633):,compounded. 'Many-twinkling' was formerly censured as not analogical;
4299,(A.D. 1633):,"we may say 'many-spotted,' but scarcely 'many-spotting.' This stanza,"
4300,(A.D. 1633):,"however, has something pleasing."
4301,(A.D. 1633):,
4302,(A.D. 1633):,"""Of the second ternary of stanzas, the first endeavours to tell"
4303,(A.D. 1633):,"something, and would have told it, had it not been crossed by"
4304,(A.D. 1633):,Hyperion; the second describes well enough the universal prevalence
4305,(A.D. 1633):,of poetry; but I am afraid that the conclusion will not arise from
4306,(A.D. 1633):,the premises. The caverns of the North and the plains of Chili are
4307,(A.D. 1633):,not the residences of 'Glory and generous Shame.' But that Poetry and
4308,(A.D. 1633):,Virtue go always together is an opinion so pleasing that I can
4309,(A.D. 1633):,forgive him who resolves to think it true.
4310,(A.D. 1633):,
4311,(A.D. 1633):,"""The third stanza sounds big with 'Delphi,' and 'Ægean,' and"
4312,(A.D. 1633):,"'Ilissus,' and 'Mæander,' and with 'hallowed fountains,' and 'solemn"
4313,(A.D. 1633):,sound;' but in all Gray's odes there is a kind of cumbrous splendour
4314,(A.D. 1633):,which we wish away. His position is at last false: in the time of
4315,(A.D. 1633):,"Dante and Petrarch, from whom we derive our first school of poetry,"
4316,(A.D. 1633):,Italy was overrun by 'tyrant power' and 'coward vice;' nor was our

4318,(A.D. 1633):,
4319,(A.D. 1633):,"""Of the third ternary, the first gives a mythological birth of"
4320,(A.D. 1633):,Shakespeare. What is said of that mighty genius is true; but it is
4321,(A.D. 1633):,not said happily: the real effects of this poetical power are put out
4322,(A.D. 1633):,of sight by the pomp of machinery. Where truth is sufficient to fill

4335,(A.D. 1633):,poetry must be _felt_ before their causes are investigated. There is
4336,(A.D. 1633):,"a poetical sensibility, which in the progress of the mind becomes as"
4337,(A.D. 1633):,distinct a power as a musical ear or a picturesque eye. Without a

4339,(A.D. 1633):,the greatest understanding to speak of the higher beauties of poetry
4340,(A.D. 1633):,as it is for a blind man to speak of colours. To adopt the warmest

4342,(A.D. 1633):,"every impulse of enthusiasm, to submit to the illusions of fancy, to"
4343,(A.D. 1633):,"retire with the poet into his ideal worlds, were dispositions wholly"
4344,(A.D. 1633):,foreign from the worldly sagacity and stern shrewdness of Johnson. As
4345,(A.D. 1633):,"in his judgment of life and character, so in his criticism on poetry,"
4346,(A.D. 1633):,he was a sort of Free-thinker. He suspected the refined of
4347,(A.D. 1633):,"affectation, he rejected the enthusiastic as absurd, and he took it"
4348,(A.D. 1633):,for granted that the mysterious was unintelligible. He came into the
4349,(A.D. 1633):,world when the school of Dryden and Pope gave the law to English
4350,(A.D. 1633):,poetry. In that school he had himself learned to be a lofty and

4374,THE BARD.,
4375,THE BARD.,"""This ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales that Edward the"
4376,THE BARD.,"First, when he completed the conquest of that country, ordered all"
4377,THE BARD.,"the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death"" (Gray)."
4378,THE BARD.,
4379,THE BARD.,"The original argument of the ode, as Gray had set it down in his"
4380,THE BARD.,"commonplace-book, was as follows: ""The army of Edward I., as they"
4381,THE BARD.,"march through a deep valley, and approach Mount Snowdon, are suddenly"
4382,THE BARD.,stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the summit
4383,THE BARD.,"of an inaccessible rock, who, with a voice more than human,"
4384,THE BARD.,reproaches the king with all the desolation and misery which he had
4385,THE BARD.,"brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race,"
4386,THE BARD.,and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never
4387,THE BARD.,extinguish the noble ardour of poetic genius in this island; and that
4388,THE BARD.,men shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valour in
4389,THE BARD.,"immortal strains, to expose vice and infamous pleasure, and boldly"
4390,THE BARD.,"censure tyranny and oppression. His song ended, he precipitates"
4391,THE BARD.,"himself from the mountain, and is swallowed up by the river that"
4392,THE BARD.,"rolls at its feet."""
4393,THE BARD.,
4394,THE BARD.,"Mitford, in his ""Essay on the Poetry of Gray,"" says of this Ode: ""The"
4395,THE BARD.,tendency of _The Bard_ is to show the retributive justice that
4396,THE BARD.,"follows an act of tyranny and wickedness; to denounce on Edward, in"
4397,THE BARD.,"his person and his progeny, the effect of the crime he had committed"
4398,THE BARD.,in the massacre of the bards; to convince him that neither his power
4399,THE BARD.,nor situation could save him from the natural and necessary
4400,THE BARD.,consequences of his guilt; that not even the virtues which he
4401,THE BARD.,possessed could atone for the vices with which they were accompanied:
4402,THE BARD.,
4403,THE BARD.,"'Helm nor hauberk's twisted mail,"
4404,THE BARD.,"Nor e'en thy _virtues_, tyrant, shall avail.'"
4405,THE BARD.,
4406,THE BARD.,This is the real tendency of the poem; and well worthy it was of
4407,THE BARD.,being adorned and heightened by such a profusion of splendid images
4408,THE BARD.,and beautiful machinery. We must also observe how much this moral
4409,THE BARD.,feeling increases as we approach the close; how the poem rises in
4410,THE BARD.,dignity; and by what a fine gradation the solemnity of the subject
4411,THE BARD.,ascends. The Bard commenced his song with feelings of sorrow for his
4412,THE BARD.,"departed brethren and his desolate country. This despondence,"
4413,THE BARD.,"however, has given way to emotions of a nobler and more exalted"
4414,THE BARD.,nature. What can be more magnificent than the vision which opens
4415,THE BARD.,before him to display the triumph of justice and the final glory of
4416,THE BARD.,"his cause? And it may be added, what can be more forcible or emphatic"
4417,THE BARD.,than the language in which it is conveyed?
4418,THE BARD.,
4419,THE BARD.,"'But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height,"
4420,THE BARD.,Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?
4421,THE BARD.,"Visions of glory, spare my aching sight!"
4422,THE BARD.,"_Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!_'"
4423,THE BARD.,
4424,THE BARD.,The fine apostrophe to the shade of Taliessin completes the picture
4425,THE BARD.,of exultation:
4426,THE BARD.,
4427,THE BARD.,"'Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;"
4428,THE BARD.,They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.'
4429,THE BARD.,
4430,THE BARD.,"The triumph of justice, therefore, is now complete. The vanquished"
4431,THE BARD.,"has risen superior to his conqueror, and the reader closes the poem"
4432,THE BARD.,with feelings of content and satisfaction. He has seen the Bard
4433,THE BARD.,uplifted both by a divine energy and by the natural superiority of
4434,THE BARD.,virtue; and the conqueror has shrunk into a creature of hatred and
4435,THE BARD.,abhorrence:
4436,THE BARD.,
4437,THE BARD.,"'Be thine despair, and sceptred care;"
4438,THE BARD.,"To triumph, and to die, are mine.'"""
4439,THE BARD.,
4440,THE BARD.,"With regard to the _obscurity_ of the poem, the same writer remarks"
4441,THE BARD.,"that ""it is such only as of necessity arises from the plan and"
4442,THE BARD.,"conduct of a prophecy."" ""In the prophetic poem,"" he adds, ""one point"
4443,THE BARD.,"of history alone is told, and the rest is to be acquired previously"
4444,THE BARD.,"by the reader; as in the contemplation of an historical picture,"
4445,THE BARD.,"which commands only one moment of time, our memory must supply us"
4446,THE BARD.,with the necessary links of knowledge; and that point of time
4447,THE BARD.,selected by the painter must be illustrated by the spectator's
4448,THE BARD.,"knowledge of the past or future, of the cause or the consequences."""
4449,THE BARD.,
4450,THE BARD.,"He refers, for corroboration of this opinion, to Dr. Campbell, who in"
4451,THE BARD.,"his ""Philosophy of Rhetoric,"" says: ""I know no style to which"
4452,THE BARD.,darkness of a certain sort is more suited than to the prophetical:
4453,THE BARD.,many reasons might be assigned which render it improper that prophecy
4454,THE BARD.,"should be perfectly understood before it be accomplished. Besides, we"
4455,THE BARD.,are certain that a prediction may be very dark before the
4456,THE BARD.,"accomplishment, and yet so plain afterwards as scarcely to admit a"
4457,THE BARD.,doubt in regard to the events suggested. It does not belong to
4458,THE BARD.,"critics to give laws to prophets, nor does it fall within the"
4459,THE BARD.,confines of any human art to lay down rules for a species of
4460,THE BARD.,"composition so far above art. Thus far, however, we may warrantably"
4461,THE BARD.,"observe, that when the prophetic style is imitated in poetry, the"
4462,THE BARD.,"piece ought, as much as possible, to possess the character above"
4463,THE BARD.,"mentioned. This character, in my opinion, is possessed in a very"
4464,THE BARD.,eminent degree by Mr. Gray's ode called _The Bard_. It is all
4465,THE BARD.,darkness to one who knows nothing of the English history posterior to
4466,THE BARD.,"the reign of Edward the First, and all light to one who is acquainted"
4467,THE BARD.,with that history. But this is a kind of writing whose peculiarities
4468,THE BARD.,"can scarcely be considered as exceptions from ordinary rules."""
4469,THE BARD.,
4470,THE BARD.,"Farther on in the same essay, Mitford remarks: ""The skill of Gray is,"
4471,THE BARD.,"I think, eminently shown in the superior distinctness with which he"
4472,THE BARD.,has marked those parts of his prophecies which are speedily to be
4473,THE BARD.,"accomplished; and in the gradations by which, as he descends, he has"
4474,THE BARD.,insensibly melted the more remote into the deeper and deeper
4475,THE BARD.,shadowings of general language. The first prophecy is the fate of
4476,THE BARD.,Edward the Second. In that the Bard has pointed out the very night in
4477,THE BARD.,which he is to be destroyed; has named the river that flowed around
4478,THE BARD.,"his prison, and the castle that was the scene of his sufferings:"
4479,THE BARD.,
4480,THE BARD.,"'Mark the _year_, and mark the _night_,"
4481,THE BARD.,When _Severn_ shall re-echo with affright
4482,THE BARD.,"The shrieks of death thro' Berkeley's roofs that ring,"
4483,THE BARD.,Shrieks of an agonizing king.'
4484,THE BARD.,
4485,THE BARD.,How different is the imagery when Richard the Second is described;
4486,THE BARD.,and how indistinctly is the luxurious monarch marked out in the form
4487,THE BARD.,"of the morning, and his country in the figure of the vessel!"
4488,THE BARD.,
4489,THE BARD.,'The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born?
4490,THE BARD.,Gone to salute the rising morn.
4491,THE BARD.,"Fair laughs the morn,' etc."
4492,THE BARD.,
4493,THE BARD.,"The last prophecy is that of the civil wars, and of the death of the"
4494,THE BARD.,"two young princes. No place, no name is now noted: and all is seen"
4495,THE BARD.,through the dimness of figurative expression:
4496,THE BARD.,
4497,THE BARD.,"'Above, below, the rose of snow,"
4498,THE BARD.,"Twin'd with her blushing foe, we spread:"
4499,THE BARD.,The bristled boar in infant gore
4500,THE BARD.,"Wallows beneath the thorny shade.'"""
4501,THE BARD.,
4502,THE BARD.,"Hales remarks: ""It is perhaps scarcely now necessary to say that the"
4503,THE BARD.,tradition on which _The Bard_ is founded is wholly groundless. Edward
4504,THE BARD.,I. never did massacre Welsh bards. Their name is legion in the
4505,THE BARD.,"beginning of the 14th century. Miss Williams, the latest historian of"
4506,THE BARD.,"Wales, does not even mention the old story.""[1]"
4507,THE BARD.,
4508,THE BARD.,"[Footnote 1: The _Saturday Review_, for June 19, 1875, in the article"
4509,THE BARD.,"from which we have elsewhere quoted (p. 79, foot-note), refers to"
4510,THE BARD.,this point as follows:
4511,THE BARD.,
4512,THE BARD.,"""Gray was one of the first writers to show that earlier parts of"
4513,THE BARD.,"English history were not only worth attending to, but were capable of"
4514,THE BARD.,poetic treatment. We can almost forgive him for dressing up in his
4515,THE BARD.,"splendid verse a foul and baseless calumny against Edward the First,"
4516,THE BARD.,when we remember that to most of Gray's contemporaries Edward the
4517,THE BARD.,"First must have seemed a person almost mythical, a benighted Popish"
4518,THE BARD.,"savage, of whom there was very little to know, and that little hardly"
4519,THE BARD.,worth knowing. Our feeling towards Gray in this matter is much the
4520,THE BARD.,same as our feeling towards Mitford in the matter of Greek history.
4521,THE BARD.,We are angry with Mitford for misrepresenting Demosthenes and a crowd
4522,THE BARD.,"of other Athenian worthies, but we do not forget that he was the"
4523,THE BARD.,"first to deal with Demosthenes and his fellows, neither as mere names"
4524,THE BARD.,"nor as demi-gods, but as real living men like ourselves. It was a"
4525,THE BARD.,"pity to misrepresent Demosthenes, but even the misrepresentation was"
4526,THE BARD.,something; it showed that Demosthenes could be made the subject of
4527,THE BARD.,human feeling one way or another. It is unpleasant to hear the King
4528,THE BARD.,whose praise it was that
4529,THE BARD.,
4530,THE BARD.,"'Velox est ad veniam, ad vindictam tardus,'"
4531,THE BARD.,
4532,THE BARD.,"spoken of as 'ruthless,' and the rest of it. But Gray at least felt"
4533,THE BARD.,"that Edward was a real man, while to most of his contemporaries he"
4534,THE BARD.,"could have been little more than 'the figure of an old Gothic king,'"
4535,THE BARD.,such as Sir Roger de Coverley looked when he sat in Edward's own

4589,THE BARD.,"14. _Mortimer_. ""Edmond de Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore"" (Gray). It was"
4590,THE BARD.,"by one of his knights, named Adam de Francton, that Llewellyn, not at"
4591,THE BARD.,"first known to be he, was slain near Pont Orewyn (Hales)."
4592,THE BARD.,
4593,THE BARD.,"On _quivering lance_, cf. Virgil, _Æn._ xii. 94: ""hastam quassatque"

4597,THE BARD.,"aspiring rock, whose surly brow."""
4598,THE BARD.,
4599,THE BARD.,"The _rock_ is probably meant for Penmaen-mawr, the northern"
4600,THE BARD.,"termination of the Snowdon range. It is a mass of rock, 1545 feet"
4601,THE BARD.,"high, a few miles from the mouth of the Conway, the valley of which"
4602,THE BARD.,it overlooks. Towards the sea it presents a rugged and almost
4603,THE BARD.,"perpendicular front. On its summit is Braich-y-Dinas, an ancient"
4604,THE BARD.,"fortified post, regarded as the strongest hold of the Britons in the"
4605,THE BARD.,district of Snowdon. Here the reduced bands of the Welsh army were
4606,THE BARD.,stationed during the negotiation between their prince Llewellyn and
4607,THE BARD.,Edward I. Within the inner enclosure is a never-failing well of pure
4608,THE BARD.,water. The rock is now pierced with a tunnel 1890 feet long for the
4609,THE BARD.,Chester and Holyhead railway.
4610,THE BARD.,
4611,THE BARD.,17. _Rob'd in the sable garb of woe_. It would appear that Wharton
4612,THE BARD.,"had criticised this line, for in a letter to him, dated Aug. 21,"
4613,THE BARD.,"1757, Gray writes: ""You may alter that '_Robed in_ the sable,' etc.,"
4614,THE BARD.,"almost in your own words, thus,"
4615,THE BARD.,
4616,THE BARD.,"'With fury pale, and pale with woe,"
4617,THE BARD.,"Secure of Fate, the Poet stood,' etc."
4618,THE BARD.,
4619,THE BARD.,"Though _haggard_, which conveys to you the idea of a _witch_, is"
4620,THE BARD.,"indeed only a metaphor taken from an unreclaimed hawk, which is"
4621,THE BARD.,"called a _haggard_, and looks wild and _farouche_, and jealous of its"
4622,THE BARD.,"liberty."" Gray seems to have afterwards returned to his first (and we"
4623,THE BARD.,think better) reading.
4624,THE BARD.,
4625,THE BARD.,"19. ""The image was taken from a well-known picture of Raphael,"
4626,THE BARD.,representing the Supreme Being in the vision of Ezekiel. There are
4627,THE BARD.,"two of these paintings (both believed originals), one at Florence,"
4628,THE BARD.,"the other in the Duke of Orleans's collection at Paris"" (Gray)."
4629,THE BARD.,

4633,THE BARD.,"21, 22. Wakefield remarks: ""This is poetical language in perfection;"

4637,THE BARD.,"23. _Desert caves_. Cf. _Lycidas_, 39: ""The woods and desert caves."""
4638,THE BARD.,
4639,THE BARD.,"26. _Hoarser murmurs_. That is, perhaps, with continually increasing"
4640,THE BARD.,"hoarseness, hoarser and hoarser; or it may mean with unwonted"
4641,THE BARD.,"hoarseness, like the comparative sometimes in Latin (Hales)."
4642,THE BARD.,
4643,THE BARD.,"28. Hoel is called _high-born_, being the son of Owen Gwynedd, prince"
4644,THE BARD.,"of North Wales, by Finnog, an Irish damsel. He was one of his"
4645,THE BARD.,"father's generals in his wars against the English, Flemings, and"
4646,THE BARD.,"Normans, in South Wales; and was a famous bard, as his poems that are"
4647,THE BARD.,extant testify.
4648,THE BARD.,
4649,THE BARD.,"_Soft Llewellyn's lay_. ""The lay celebrating the mild Llewellyn,"""
4650,THE BARD.,"says Hales, though he afterwards remarks that, ""looking at the"
4651,THE BARD.,"context, it would be better to take _Llewellyn_ here for a bard."""
4652,THE BARD.,Many bards celebrated the warlike prowess and princely qualities of
4653,THE BARD.,"Llewellyn. A poem by Einion the son of Guigan calls him ""a"
4654,THE BARD.,"tender-hearted prince;"" and another, by Llywarch Brydydd y Moch,"
4655,THE BARD.,"says: ""Llewellyn, though in battle he killed with fury, though he"
4656,THE BARD.,"burned like an outrageous fire, yet was a mild prince when the"
4657,THE BARD.,"mead-horns were distributed."" In an ode by Llygard Gwr he is also"
4658,THE BARD.,"called ""Llewellyn the mild."""
4659,THE BARD.,
4660,THE BARD.,29. Cadwallo and Urien were bards of whose songs nothing has been
4661,THE BARD.,preserved. Taliessin (see 121 below) dedicated many poems to the
4662,THE BARD.,"latter, and wrote an elegy on his death: he was slain by treachery in"
4663,THE BARD.,the year 560.
4664,THE BARD.,
4665,THE BARD.,30. _That hush'd the stormy main_. Cf. Shakes. _M. N. D._ ii. 2:

4668,THE BARD.,"That the rude sea grew civil at her song."""
4669,THE BARD.,
4670,THE BARD.,33. _Modred_. This name is not found in the lists of the old bards.
4671,THE BARD.,"It may have been borrowed from the Arthurian legends; or, as Mitford"
4672,THE BARD.,"suggests, it may refer to ""the famous Myrddin ab Morvyn, called"
4673,THE BARD.,"Merlyn the Wild, a disciple of Taliessin, the form of the name being"
4674,THE BARD.,"changed for the sake of euphony."""
4675,THE BARD.,
4676,THE BARD.,"34. _Plinlimmon_. One of the loftiest of the Welsh mountains, being"
4677,THE BARD.,"2463 feet in height. It is really a group of mountains, three of"
4678,THE BARD.,"which tower high above the others, and on each of these is a"
4679,THE BARD.,"_carnedd_, or pile of stones. The highest of the three is further"
4680,THE BARD.,"divided into two peaks, and on these, as well as on another prominent"
4681,THE BARD.,"part of the same height, are other piles of stones. These five piles,"
4682,THE BARD.,"according to the common tradition, mark the graves of slain warriors,"
4683,THE BARD.,and serve as memorials of their exploits; but some believe that they
4684,THE BARD.,"were intended as landmarks or military signals, and that from them"
4685,THE BARD.,"the mountain was called _Pump-lumon_ or _Pum-lumon_, ""the five"
4686,THE BARD.,"beacons""--a name somehow corrupted into _Plinlimmon_. Five rivers"
4687,THE BARD.,"take their rise in the recesses of Plinlimmon--the Wye, the Severn,"
4688,THE BARD.,"the Rheidol, the Llyfnant, and the Clywedog."
4689,THE BARD.,
4690,THE BARD.,"35. _Arvon's shore_. ""The shores of Caernarvonshire, opposite the"
4691,THE BARD.,"isle of Anglesey"" (Gray). _Caernarvon_, or _Caer yn Arvon_, means the"
4692,THE BARD.,camp in Arvon.
4693,THE BARD.,
4694,THE BARD.,"38. ""Camden and others observe that eagles used annually to build"
4695,THE BARD.,"their aerie among the rocks of Snowdon, which from thence (as some"
4696,THE BARD.,"think) were named by the Welsh _Craigian-eryri_, or the crags of the"
4697,THE BARD.,eagles. At this day (I am told) the highest point of Snowdon is
4698,THE BARD.,called _the Eagle's Nest_. That bird is certainly no stranger to this
4699,THE BARD.,"island, as the Scots, and the people of Cumberland, Westmoreland,"

5119,THE BARD.,"As we have given Johnson's criticism on _The Progress of Poesy_, we"
5120,THE BARD.,"append his comments on this ""Sister Ode:"""
5121,THE BARD.,
5122,THE BARD.,"""'The Bard' appears, at the first view, to be, as Algarotti and"
5123,THE BARD.,"others have remarked, an imitation of the prophecy of Nereus."
5124,THE BARD.,"Algarotti thinks it superior to its original; and, if preference"
5125,THE BARD.,"depends only on the imagery and animation of the two poems, his"
5126,THE BARD.,"judgment is right. There is in 'The Bard' more force, more thought,"
5127,THE BARD.,"and more variety. But to copy is less than to invent, and the copy"
5128,THE BARD.,has been unhappily produced at a wrong time. The fiction of Horace
5129,THE BARD.,was to the Romans credible; but its revival disgusts us with apparent
5130,THE BARD.,and unconquerable falsehood. _Incredulus odi_.
5131,THE BARD.,
5132,THE BARD.,"""To select a singular event, and swell it to a giant's bulk by"
5133,THE BARD.,"fabulous appendages of spectres and predictions, has little"
5134,THE BARD.,difficulty; for he that forsakes the probable may always find the
5135,THE BARD.,marvellous. And it has little use; we are affected only as we
5136,THE BARD.,believe; we are improved only as we find something to be imitated or
5137,THE BARD.,"declined. I do not see that 'The Bard' promotes any truth, moral or"
5138,THE BARD.,political.
5139,THE BARD.,
5140,THE BARD.,"""His stanzas are too long, especially his epodes; the ode is finished"
5141,THE BARD.,"before the ear has learned its measures, and consequently before it"
5142,THE BARD.,can receive pleasure from their consonance and recurrence.
5143,THE BARD.,
5144,THE BARD.,"""Of the first stanza the abrupt beginning has been celebrated; but"
5145,THE BARD.,technical beauties can give praise only to the inventor. It is in the
5146,THE BARD.,"power of any man to rush abruptly upon his subject, that has read the"
5147,THE BARD.,"ballad of 'Johnny Armstrong,'"
5148,THE BARD.,
5149,THE BARD.,'Is there ever a man in all Scotland--'
5150,THE BARD.,
5151,THE BARD.,"""The initial resemblances, or alliterations, 'ruin, ruthless, helm or"

5153,THE BARD.,sublimity.
5154,THE BARD.,
5155,THE BARD.,"""In the second stanza the Bard is well described; but in the third we"
5156,THE BARD.,have the puerilities of obsolete mythology. When we are told that
5157,THE BARD.,"'Cadwallo hush'd the stormy main,' and that 'Modred made huge"
5158,THE BARD.,"Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head,' attention recoils from the"
5159,THE BARD.,"repetition of a tale that, even when it was first heard, was heard"
5160,THE BARD.,with scorn.
5161,THE BARD.,
5162,THE BARD.,"""The _weaving_ of the _winding-sheet_ he borrowed, as he owns, from"

5164,THE BARD.,"work of female powers, as the act of spinning the thread of life is"
5165,THE BARD.,another mythology. Theft is always dangerous; Gray has made weavers
5166,THE BARD.,of slaughtered bards by a fiction outrageous and incongruous. They
5167,THE BARD.,"are then called upon to 'Weave the warp, and weave the woof,' perhaps"
5168,THE BARD.,with no great propriety; for it is by crossing the _woof_ with the
5169,THE BARD.,_warp_ that men weave the _web_ or piece; and the first line was
5170,THE BARD.,"dearly bought by the admission of its wretched correspondent, 'Give"
5171,THE BARD.,"ample room and verge enough.' He has, however, no other line as bad."
5172,THE BARD.,
5173,THE BARD.,"""The third stanza of the second ternary is commended, I think, beyond"
5174,THE BARD.,its merit. The personification is indistinct. _Thirst_ and _Hunger_
5175,THE BARD.,"are not alike; and their features, to make the imagery perfect,"
5176,THE BARD.,"should have been discriminated. We are told, in the same stanza, how"
5177,THE BARD.,'towers are fed.' But I will no longer look for particular faults;
5178,THE BARD.,yet let it be observed that the ode might have been concluded with an
5179,THE BARD.,"action of better example; but suicide is always to be had, without"

5374,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"paper on ""Wordsworth and Gray."" After quoting Wordsworth's remark"
5375,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"that ""Gray was at the head of those poets who, by their reasonings,"
5376,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,have attempted to widen the space of separation between prose and
5377,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"metrical composition, and was, more than any other man, curiously"
5378,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"elaborate in the construction of his own poetic diction,"" the"
5379,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,reviewer remarks:
5380,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5381,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""The indictment, then, brought by Wordsworth against Gray is twofold."
5382,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Gray, it seems, had in the first place a false conception of the"
5383,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"nature of poetry; and, secondly, a false standard of poetical"
5384,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"diction. To begin with the first count, Gray, we are told, sought to"
5385,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition.
5386,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"What this charge amounts to we shall see hereafter. Meantime, did"
5387,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,Wordsworth think that between prose and poetry there was any line of
5388,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"demarcation at all? In the Preface [to the ""Lyrical Ballads""] from"
5389,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,which we have quoted we read:
5390,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5391,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""'There neither is nor can be any essential difference between the"
5392,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,language of prose and metrical composition. We are fond of tracing
5393,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and accordingly we call"
5394,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,them sisters; but where shall we find bonds of connection
5395,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,sufficiently strong to typify the connection betwixt prose and
5396,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,metrical composition?'
5397,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5398,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""Now this question admits of a very definite answer. Take the Iliad"
5399,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,of Homer and a proposition of Euclid. Is it conceivable that the
5400,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"latter could have been expressed at all in metre, or the former"
5401,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"expressed half so well in prose? If not, what is the reason? Is it"
5402,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,not plain that the poem contains a predominant element of imagination
5403,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,and feeling which is absolutely excluded from the proposition? And in
5404,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,the same way it may be shown that whenever a man expresses himself
5405,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"properly in metre, the subject-matter of his composition belongs to"
5406,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,imagination or feeling; whenever he writes in prose his subject
5407,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,belongs to or (if the prose be fiction) intimately resembles matter
5408,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,of fact. We may decide then with certainty that the sphere of poetry
5409,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"lies in Imagination, and that the larger the amount of _just_ liberty"
5410,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"the Imagination enjoys, the better will be the poetry it produces."
5411,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"But then a further question arises, and this is the key of the whole"
5412,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"position, How far does this liberty extend? Is Imagination absolute,"
5413,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"supreme, and uncontrolled in its own sphere, or is it under the"
5414,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,guidance and government of reason? That its dominion is not universal
5415,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"is obvious, but of its influence we are all conscious, and there is"
5416,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,no exaggeration in the eloquent words of Pascal:
5417,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5418,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""'This mighty power, the perpetual antagonist of reason, which"
5419,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,delights to show its ascendency by bringing her under its control and
5420,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"dominion, has created a second nature in man. It has its joys and its"
5421,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"sorrows; its health, its sickness; its wealth, its poverty; it"
5422,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"compels reason, in spite of herself, to believe, to doubt, to deny;"
5423,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"it suspends the exercise of the senses, and imparts to them again an"
5424,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,artificial acuteness; it has its follies and its wisdom; and the most
5425,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,perverse thing of all is that it fills its votaries with a
5426,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,complacency more full and complete even than that which reason can
5427,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,supply.'
5428,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5429,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""If such be the force of Imagination in active life, how absolute"
5430,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"must be its dominion in poetry! And absolute it is, if we are to"
5431,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"believe Wordsworth, who defines poetry to be 'the spontaneous"
5432,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,overflow of powerful emotion.' This definition coincides well with
5433,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,modern notions on the nature of the art. But how different is the
5434,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,view if we turn from theory to practice! It would surely be a serious
5435,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"mistake to describe the noblest poems, like the 'Æneid' or 'Paradise"
5436,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Lost,' as the product of mere spontaneous emotion. And even in lyric"
5437,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"verse, to which it may be said Wordsworth is specially alluding, we"
5438,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"find the greatest poets, like Pindar and Simonides, composing their"
5439,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"odes for set occasions like the public games, in honour of persons"
5440,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"with whom they were but little acquainted, and (most significant fact"
5441,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,of all) in the expectation of receiving liberal rewards. We need not
5442,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,say that such considerations detract nothing from the genius of these
5443,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,great poets; but they prove very conclusively that poetry is not what
5444,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Wordsworth's definition asserts, and what in these days it is too"
5445,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"often assumed to be, the mere gush of unconscious inspiration. The"
5446,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"definition of Wordsworth may perhaps suit short lyrics, such as he"
5447,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"was himself in the habit of composing, but it would be fatal to the"
5448,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"claims of poetry to rank among the higher arts, for it would exclude"
5449,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"that quality which, in poetry as in all art, is truly sovereign,"
5450,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Invention. The poet, no less than the mechanical inventor, excels by"
5451,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"the exercise of reason, by his knowledge of the required effect, his"
5452,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"power of adapting means to ends, and his skill in availing himself of"
5453,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,circumstances. Consider for a moment the external difficulties which
5454,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"restrict the poet's liberty, and require the most vigorous efforts of"
5455,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"reason to subdue them. To begin with, in order to secure the happy"
5456,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"result promised by Horace,"
5457,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5458,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,'Cui lecta potenter erit res
5459,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Nec facundia deseret hunc nec lucidus ordo,'"
5460,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5461,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,he has to take the exact measure of his own powers. How many a poet
5462,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,has failed for want of judgment by trespassing on a subject and style
5463,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"for which his genius is unfitted! Again, he is confronted by the most"
5464,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"obvious difficulties of language and metre, which limit his freedom"
5465,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"to a degree unknown to the prose-writer. And beyond this, if he"
5466,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,wishes to be read--and a poem without readers is no more than a
5467,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,musical instrument without a musician--he has to consider the
5468,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,character of his audience. He must have all the instinct of an
5469,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"orator, all the intuitive knowledge of the world, as well as all the"
5470,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"practical resource, which are required to gain command over the"
5471,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"hearts of men, and to subdue, by the charms of eloquence, their"
5472,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"passions, their prejudices, and their judgment. To achieve such"
5473,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,results something more is required than 'the spontaneous overflow of
5474,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,powerful feeling.'
5475,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5476,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""How far Wordsworth's own poetry illustrates his principles we shall"
5477,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,consider presently; meantime his definition helps us to understand
5478,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,what he meant by Gray's fault of widening the space of separation
5479,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,betwixt prose and metrical composition. Neither in respect of the
5480,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,quantity nor the quality of his verse could Gray's manner of
5481,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,composition be described as spontaneous. Compared with Wordsworth's
5482,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"numerous volumes of poetry, the slender volume that contains the"
5483,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,poetry of Gray looks meagre indeed; yet almost every poem in this
5484,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,small collection is a considered work of art. To begin with 'The
5485,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Bard.' Few readers, we suppose, would rise from this ode without a"
5486,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,sense of its poetical 'effect.' The details may be thought to require
5487,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"too much attention; the allusions, from the nature of the subject,"
5488,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"are, no doubt, difficult; but a feeling of loftiness, of harmony, of"
5489,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"proportion, remains in the mind at the close of the poem, which is"
5490,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"not likely to pass away. How, then, was this effect produced? First"
5491,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,of all we see that Gray had selected a good subject; his raw
5492,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"materials, so to speak, were poetical. The imagination, unembarrassed"
5493,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"by common associations, breathes freely in its own region, and is"
5494,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,instinctively elevated as it moves among the great events of the
5495,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"past, dwelling on the misfortunes of monarchs, the rise of dynasties,"
5496,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"and the splendours of literature. But, in the second place, when he"
5497,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"has chosen his subject, it is the part of the poet to impress the"
5498,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,great ideas derived from it on the feelings and the memory by the
5499,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,distinctness of the form under which he presents it; and here
5500,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,poetical invention first begins to work. By the imaginative fiction
5501,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"of 'The Bard,' Gray is enabled to cast the whole course of English"
5502,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"history into the form of a prophecy, and to excite the patriotic"
5503,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"feelings of the reader, as Virgil roused the pride of his own"
5504,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"countrymen by Anchises' forecast of the grandeur of Rome. Finally,"
5505,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"when the main design of the poem is thus conceived, observe with what"
5506,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,art all the different parts are made to emphasize the beauty of the
5507,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,general conception; with what dramatic propriety the calamities of
5508,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,the conquering Plantagenet are prophesied by his vanquished foe;
5509,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"while on the other hand, the literary glories of the Tudor Elizabeth"
5510,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,awaken the triumph of the patriot and the poet; how martial and
5511,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,spirited is the opening of the poem! how lofty and enthusiastic its
5512,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"close! Perhaps there is no English lyric which, animated by equal"
5513,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"fervour, displays so much architectural genius as 'The Bard.'"
5514,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5515,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""Take, again, the 'Ode on the Prospect of Eton College.' A subject"
5516,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"better adapted far the indulgence of personal feeling, or for those"
5517,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"sentimental confidences between the reader and the poet, in which the"
5518,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"modern muse so much delights, could not be imagined. But what do we"
5519,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,find? The theme is treated in the most general manner. Though
5520,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,emphasizing the irony of his reflection by the beautiful touch of
5521,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"memory in the second stanza, the poet speaks throughout as a moralist"
5522,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,or spectator; from first to last he seems to lose all thought of
5523,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,himself in contemplating the tragedies he foresees for others; the
5524,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"subject is in fact handled with the most skilful rhetoric, and every"
5525,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,stanza is made to strengthen and elaborate the leading thought. In
5526,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"the 'Progress of Poesy,' though the general constructive effect is"
5527,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"perhaps inferior to 'The Bard,' we see the same evidence of careful"
5528,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"preconsideration, while the course of the poem is particularly"
5529,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,distinguished by the beauty of the transitions. Of the form of the
5530,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,'Elegy' it is superfluous to speak; a poem so dignified and yet so
5531,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"tender, appeals immediately, and will continue to appeal, to the"
5532,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"heart of every Englishman, so long as the care of public liberty and"
5533,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"love of the soil maintain their hold in this country. In this poem,"
5534,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"as indeed in all that Gray ever wrote, we find it his first principle"
5535,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,_to prefer his subject to himself_; he never forgot that while he was
5536,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"a man he was also an artist, and he knew that the function of art was"
5537,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"not merely to indulge nature, but to dignify and refine it."
5538,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5539,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""Yet, in spite of his love of form, there is nothing frigid or"
5540,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"statuesque in the genius of Gray. A vein of deep melancholy,"
5541,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"evidently constitutional, runs through his poetry, and, considering"
5542,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"how little he produced, the number of personal allusions in his"
5543,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,verses is undoubtedly large. But he is entirely free from that
5544,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,egotism which we have had frequent occasion to blame as the
5545,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,prevailing vice of modern poetry. For whereas the modern poet thrusts
5546,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"his private feelings into prominence, and finds a luxury in the"
5547,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"confession of his sorrows, Gray's references to himself are"
5548,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"introduced on public grounds, or, in other words, with a view to"
5549,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"poetical effect. He, like our own bards, is 'condemned to groan,' but"
5550,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,for different reasons--
5551,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5552,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"'The tender for _another's_ pain,"
5553,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,The unfeeling for his own.'
5554,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5555,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""We have already remarked on the public character of the 'Ode on Eton"
5556,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,College;' but the second stanza of this poem is a pure expression of
5557,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,individual feeling:
5558,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5559,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"'Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!"
5560,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Ah, fields belov'd in vain!"
5561,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Where once my careless childhood play'd,"
5562,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,A stranger yet to pain!
5563,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,I feel the gales that from ye blow
5564,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"A momentary bliss bestow,"
5565,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"As waving fresh their gladsome wing,"
5566,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"My weary soul they seem to soothe,"
5567,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"And, redolent of joy and youth,"
5568,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,To breathe a second spring.'
5569,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5570,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,Every one will perceive the art which enforces the truth of the
5571,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,general reflections that follow by the personal experience of the
5572,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"speaker. Again, the 'Progress of Poesy' closes with a personal"
5573,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"allusion which, as it is a climax, might, if ill-managed, have"
5574,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"appeared arrogant, but which is, in fact, a masterpiece of oratory."
5575,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"After confessing his own inferiority to Pindar, the poet proceeds:"
5576,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5577,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,'Yet oft before his infant eyes would run
5578,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray,"
5579,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"With orient hues, unborrow'd of the sun;"
5580,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way,"
5581,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,"
5582,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,Beneath the Good how far--but far above the Great!'
5583,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5584,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,There is something very noble in the elevated manner in which the
5585,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"self-complacent triumph of genius, expressed by so many poets from"
5586,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Ennius downwards, is at once justified and chastened by the"
5587,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,reflection in these lines. We see in them that the poet alludes to
5588,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"himself in the third person, and he repeats this style in the"
5589,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"'Elegy,' where, after the fourth line, the first personal pronoun is"
5590,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"never again used. How just and beautiful is the turn where, after"
5591,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"contemplating the general lot of the lowly society he is celebrating,"
5592,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,he proceeds to identify his own fate with theirs:
5593,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5594,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"'For _thee_, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,"
5595,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,"
5596,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"If, chance, by lonely contemplation led,"
5597,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,"
5598,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5599,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"'Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,' etc."
5600,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,
5601,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"""The two great characteristics of Gray's poetry that we have"
5602,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,noticed--his self-suppression and his sense of form and dignity--are
5603,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,best described by the word 'classical.' What we particularly admire
5604,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,in the great authors of Greece and Rome is their public spirit. Their
5605,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"writings are full of patriotism, good-breeding, and common-sense, and"
5606,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,have that happy mixture of art and nature which is only acquired by
5607,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,men who have learned from liberty how to discipline individual
5608,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"instincts by social refinement. Their style is masculine, clear, and"
5609,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"moderate; they seem, as it were, never to lose the sense of being"
5610,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"before an audience, and, like orators who know that they are always"
5611,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"exposed to the judgment of their intellectual equals, they aim at"
5612,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,putting intelligible thoughts into the most natural and forcible
5613,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,words. Precisely the same qualities are observable in all the best
5614,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"English writers of the eighteenth century. Addison, Pope, and"
5615,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"Goldsmith are perhaps the most shining examples, but the rest are"
5616,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,'classical' in the sense which we have just indicated; and we can
5617,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,hardly be wrong in ascribing this common rhetorical instinct to the
5618,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"intimate connection between the men of thought and the men of action,"
5619,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"which existed both in the free states of antiquity, and in England"
5620,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,under the rule of the aristocracy. With the advance of the eighteenth
5621,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,century the instinct in English literature seems to grow weaker; the
5622,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"style of our authors becomes more formal and constrained, and"
5623,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,symptoms of that dislike of society encouraged by the philosophy of
5624,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,Rousseau more frequently betray themselves. As the poetry of Cowper
5625,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"shows less social instinct than that of Gray, so Gray himself is"
5626,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,inferior in this respect to Pope and Goldsmith. But his style has the
5627,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"same lofty public spirit that distinguishes his favourite models, and"
5628,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,no worthier form could be imagined to express the ardour excited in
5629,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,the heart of a patriotic poet by the rising fortunes of his native
5630,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,country. We feel that it is in every way fitting that the author of
5631,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,the 'Elegy' should have been the favourite of Wolfe and the
5632,APPENDIX TO NOTES.,"countryman of Chatham."""
