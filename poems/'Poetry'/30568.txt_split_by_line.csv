187,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,The deep and widespread interest which the writings of Mr. Rudyard
188,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,Kipling have excited has naturally led to curiosity concerning their
189,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,author and to a desire to know the conditions of his life. Much has
190,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,been written about him which has had little or no foundation in truth.
191,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"It seems, then, worth while, in order to prevent false or mistaken"
192,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"reports from being accepted as trustworthy, and in order to provide"
193,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,for the public such information concerning Mr. Kipling as it has a
194,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"right to possess, that a correct and authoritative statement of the"
195,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,chief events in his life should be given to it. This is the object of
196,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,the following brief narrative.
197,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
198,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,*       *       *       *       *
199,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
200,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Rudyard Kipling was born at Bombay on the 30th of December, 1865. His"
201,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"mother, Alice, daughter of the Rev. G. B. Macdonald, a Wesleyan"
202,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"preacher, eminent in that denomination, and his father, John Lockwood"
203,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Kipling, the son also of a Wesleyan preacher, were both of Yorkshire"
204,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"birth. They had been married in London early in the year, and they"
205,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,named their first-born child after the pretty lake in Staffordshire
206,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,on the borders of which their acquaintance had begun. Mr. Lockwood
207,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Kipling, after leaving school, had served his apprenticeship in one of"
208,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the famous Staffordshire potteries at Burslem, had afterward worked in"
209,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the studio of the sculptor, Mr. Birnie Philip, and from 1861 to 1865"
210,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,had been engaged on the decorations of the South Kensington Museum.
211,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"During our American war and in the years immediately following, the"
212,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"trade of Bombay was exceedingly flourishing, the city was immensely"
213,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"prosperous, a spirit of inflation possessed the Government and the"
214,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"people alike, there were great designs for the improvement and"
215,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"rebuilding of large portions of the town, and a need was felt for"
216,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,artistic oversight and direction of the works in hand and
217,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,contemplated. The distinction which Mr. Lockwood Kipling had already
218,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,won by his native ability and thorough training led to his being
219,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,appointed in 1865 to go to Bombay as the professor of Architectural
220,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,Sculpture in the British School of Art which had been established
221,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,there.
222,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
223,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,It was thus that Rudyard Kipling came to be born in the most
224,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"cosmopolitan city of the Eastern world, and it was there and in its"
225,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"neighbourhood that the first three years of the boy's life were spent,"
226,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"years in which every child receives ineffaceable impressions, shaping"
227,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"his conceptions of the world, and in which a child of peculiarly"
228,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"sensitive nature and active disposition, such as this boy possessed,"
229,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,lies open to myriad influences that quicken and give colour to the
230,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,imagination.
231,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
232,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,In the spring of 1868 he was taken by his mother for a visit to
233,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"England, and there, in the same year, his sister was born. In the next"
234,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"year his mother returned to India with both her children, and the"
235,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,boy's next two years were spent at and near Bombay.
236,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
237,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"He was a friendly and receptive child, eager, interested in all the"
238,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"various entertaining aspects of life in a city which, ""gleaning all"
239,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"races from all lands,"" presents more diversified and picturesque"
240,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"varieties of human condition than any other, East or West. A little"
241,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,incident which his mother remembers is not without a pretty allegoric
242,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"significance. It was at Nasik, on the Dekhan plain, not far from"
243,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Bombay: the little fellow trudging over the ploughed field, with his"
244,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"hand in that of the native husbandman, called back to her in the"
245,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Hindustani, which was as familiar to him as English, ""Good-bye, this"
246,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"is my brother."""
247,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
248,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"In 1871 Mr. and Mrs. Kipling went with their children to England, and"
249,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"being compelled to return to India the next year, they took up the"
250,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"sorrow common to Anglo-Indian lives, in leaving their children ""at"
251,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"home,"" in charge of friends at Southsea, near Portsmouth. It was a"
252,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,hard and sad experience for the boy. The originality of his nature and
253,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the independence of his spirit had already become clearly manifest,"
254,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,and were likely to render him unintelligible and perplexing to
255,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,whosoever might have charge of him unless they were gifted with
256,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"unusual perceptions and quick sympathies. Happily his mother's sister,"
257,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Mrs. (now Lady) Burne-Jones, was near at hand, in case of need, to"
258,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,care for him.
259,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
260,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,In the spring of 1877 Mrs. Kipling came to England to see her
261,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"children, and was followed the next year by her husband. The children"
262,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"were removed from Southsea, and Rudyard, grown into a companionable,"
263,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"active-minded, interesting boy, now in his thirteenth year, had the"
264,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"delight of spending some weeks in Paris, with his father, attracted"
265,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,thither by the exhibition of that year. His eyesight had been for some
266,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"time a source of trouble to him, and the relief was great from"
267,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"glasses, which were specially fitted to his eyes, and with which he"
268,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,has never since been able to dispense.
269,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
270,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"On the return of his parents to India, early in 1878, Rudyard was"
271,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"placed at the school of Westward Ho, at Bideford, in Devon. This"
272,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,school was one chiefly intended for the sons of members of the Indian
273,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"services, most of whom were looking forward to following their"
274,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,fathers' careers as servants of the Crown. It was in charge of an
275,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"admirable head-master, Mr. Cormell Price, whose character was such"
276,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,that he won the affection of his boys no less than their respect. The
277,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,young Kipling was not an easy boy to manage. He chose his own way. His
278,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,talents were such that he might have held a place near the highest in
279,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"his studies, but he was content to let others surpass him in lessons,"
280,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,while he yielded to his genius in devoting himself to original
281,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,composition and to much reading in books of his own choice. He became
282,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the editor of the school paper, he contributed to the columns of the"
283,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"local Bideford _Journal_, he wrote a quantity of verse, and was"
284,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"venturesome enough to send a copy of verses to a London journal,"
285,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"which, to his infinite satisfaction, was accepted and published. Some"
286,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"of his verses were afterward collected in a little volume, privately"
287,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"printed by his parents at Lahore, with the title ""Schoolboy Lyrics."""
288,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,All through his time at school his letters to his parents in India
289,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,were such as to make it clear to them that his future lay in the field
290,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,of literature.
291,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
292,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,His literary gifts came to him by inheritance from both the father and
293,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"mother, and they were nurtured and cultivated in the circle of"
294,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,relatives and family friends with whom his holidays were spent. A
295,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"sub-master at Westward Ho, though little satisfied with the boy's"
296,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"progress in the studies of the school, gave to him the liberty of his"
297,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"own excellent library. The holidays were spent at the Grange, in South"
298,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Kensington, the home of his aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Burne-Jones,"
299,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and here he came under the happiest possible domestic influences, and"
300,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"was brought into contact with men of highest quality, whose lives were"
301,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"given to letters and the arts, especially with William Morris, the"
302,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,closest intimate of the household of the Grange. Other homes were open
303,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,to him where the pervading influence was that of intellectual
304,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"pursuits, and where he had access to libraries through which he was"
305,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,allowed to wander and to browse at his will. The good which came to
306,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"him, directly and indirectly, from these opportunities can hardly be"
307,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"overstated. To know, to love, and to be loved by such a man as"
308,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,Burne-Jones was a supreme blessing in his life.
309,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
310,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"In the autumn of 1882, having finished his course at school, a"
311,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"position was secured for him on the _Civil and Military Gazette_,"
312,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Lahore, and he returned to his parents in India, who had meanwhile"
313,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"removed from Bombay to Lahore, where his father was at the head of the"
314,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,most important school of the arts in India. The _Civil and Military
315,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Gazette_ is the chief journal of northwestern India, owned and"
316,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"conducted by the managers and owners of the Allahabad _Pioneer_, the"
317,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,ablest and most influential of all Indian newspapers published in the
318,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,interior of the country.
319,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
320,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,For five years he worked hard and steadily on the _Gazette_. Much of
321,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,the work was simple drudgery. He shirked nothing. The editor-in-chief
322,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"was a somewhat grim man, who believed in snubbing his subordinates,"
323,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and who, though he recognized the talents of the ""clever pup,"" as he"
324,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"called him, and allowed him a pretty free hand in his contributions to"
325,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the paper, yet was inclined to exact from him the full tale of the"
326,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,heavy routine work of a newspaper office.
327,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
328,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,But these were happy years. For the youth was feeling the spring of
329,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"his own powers, was full of interest in life, was laying up stores of"
330,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"observation and experience, and found in his own home not only"
331,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"domestic happiness, but a sympathy in taste and a variety of talent"
332,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,and accomplishment which acted as a continual stimulus to his own
333,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"genius. Father, mother, sister, and brother all played and worked"
334,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,together with rare combination of sympathetic gifts. In 1885 some of
335,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,the verses with the writing of which he and his sister had amused
336,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"themselves were published at Lahore, in a little volume entitled"
337,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"""Echoes,"" because most of them were lively parodies on some of the"
338,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,poems of the popular poets of the day. The little book had its moment
339,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,of narrowly limited success and opened the way for the wider notoriety
340,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and success of a volume into which were gathered the ""Departmental"
341,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Ditties"" that had appeared from time to time in the _Gazette_. Many of"
342,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,the stories also which were afterward collected under the now familiar
343,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"title of ""Plain Tales from the Hills"" made their first appearance in"
344,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"the _Gazette_, and attracted wide attention in the Anglo-Indian"
345,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,community.
346,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
347,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,Kipling's work for five years at Lahore had indeed been of such
348,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,quality that it was not surprising that he was called down to
349,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Allahabad, in 1887, to take a place upon the editorial staff of the"
350,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,_Pioneer_. The training of an Anglo-Indian journalist is peculiar. He
351,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"has to master knowledge of many kinds, to become thoroughly acquainted"
352,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,with the affairs of the English administration and the conditions of
353,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Anglo-Indian life, and at the same time with the interests, the modes"
354,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"of life, and thought of the vast underlying native population. The"
355,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,higher positions in Indian journalism are places of genuine importance
356,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and of large emolument, worthy objects of ambition for a young man"
357,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,conscious of literary faculty and inspired with zeal for public ends.
358,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
359,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"The _Pioneer_ issued a weekly as well as a daily edition, and in"
360,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"addition to his regular work upon the daily paper, Kipling continued"
361,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,to write for the weekly issue stories similar to those which had
362,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"already won him reputation, and they now attracted wider attention"
363,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"than ever. His home at Allahabad was with Professor Hill, a man of"
364,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,science attached to the Allahabad College. But the continuity of his
365,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,life was broken by various journeys undertaken in the interest of the
366,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"paper--one through Rajputana, from which he wrote a series of"
367,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"descriptive letters, called ""Letters of Marque""; another to Calcutta"
368,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and through Bengal, which resulted in ""The City of Dreadful Night"" and"
369,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,other letters describing the little-known conditions of the vast
370,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"presidency; and, finally, in 1889, he was sent off by the _Pioneer_ on"
371,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"a tour round the world, on which he was accompanied by his friends,"
372,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Professor and Mrs. Hill. Going first to Japan, he thence came to"
373,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"America, writing on the way and in America the letters which appeared"
374,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"in the _Pioneer_ under the title of ""From Sea to Sea""; and in"
375,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"September, 1889, he arrived in London."
376,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,
377,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,His Indian repute had not preceded him to such degree as to make the
378,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,way easy for him through the London crowd. But after a somewhat dreary
379,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"winter, during which he had been making acquaintances and had found"
380,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"irregular employment upon newspapers and magazines, arrangements were"
381,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,made with Messrs. Macmillan & Co. for the publication of an edition of
382,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"""Plain Tales from the Hills."" The book appeared in June. Its success"
383,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"was immediate. It was republished at once in America, and was welcomed"
384,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,as warmly on this side of the Atlantic as on the other. The reprint of
385,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Kipling's other Indian stories and of his ""Departmental Ditties"""
386,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"speedily followed, together with the new tales and poems which showed"
387,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,the wide range of his creative genius. Each volume was a fresh
388,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"success; each extended the circle of Mr. Kipling's readers, till now"
389,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,he is the most widely known of English authors.

391,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"In 1891 Mr. Kipling left England for a long voyage to South Africa,"
392,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Australia, New Zealand, and Ceylon, and thence to visit his parents at"
393,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Lahore. On his return to England, he was married in London to Miss"
394,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Balestier, daughter of the late Mr. Wolcott Balestier of New York."
395,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Shortly after their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Kipling visited Japan, and"
396,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,in August they came to America. They established their home at
397,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"Brattleboro, Vermont, where Mrs. Kipling's family had a large estate:"
398,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"and here, in a pleasant and beautifully situated house which they had"
399,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"built for themselves, their two eldest children were born, and here"
400,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,"they continued to live till September, 1896."

402,BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON,During these four years Mr. Kipling made three brief visits to England

450,THE FIRST BAG,"""Punch-baba going to bye-lo?"" said the ayah suggestively."
451,THE FIRST BAG,

461,THE FIRST BAG,
462,THE FIRST BAG,Never had Punch secured the telling of that tale with so little

503,THE FIRST BAG,
504,THE FIRST BAG,"""The worst of it is that one can't be certain of anything,"" said Papa,"

507,THE FIRST BAG,
508,THE FIRST BAG,"""The worst of it is that the children will grow up away from me,"""
509,THE FIRST BAG,thought Mamma; but she did not say it aloud.
510,THE FIRST BAG,
511,THE FIRST BAG,"""We are only one case among hundreds,"" said Papa bitterly. ""You shall"

521,THE FIRST BAG,
522,THE FIRST BAG,"They were standing over the cots in the nursery late at night, and I"
523,THE FIRST BAG,"think that Mamma was crying softly. After Papa had gone away, she"
524,THE FIRST BAG,knelt down by the side of Judy's cot. The ayah saw her and put up a
525,THE FIRST BAG,prayer that the memsahib might never find the love of her children
526,THE FIRST BAG,taken away from her and given to a stranger.
527,THE FIRST BAG,
528,THE FIRST BAG,Mamma's own prayer was a slightly illogical one. Summarized it ran:
529,THE FIRST BAG,"""Let strangers love my children and be as good to them as I should be,"
530,THE FIRST BAG,but let me preserve their love and their confidence for ever and ever.
531,THE FIRST BAG,"Amen."" Punch scratched himself in his sleep, and Judy moaned a little."
532,THE FIRST BAG,"That seems to be the only answer to the prayer: and, next day, they"
533,THE FIRST BAG,"all went down to the sea, and there was a scene at the Apollo Bunder"
534,THE FIRST BAG,"when Punch discovered that Meeta could not come too, and Judy learned"
535,THE FIRST BAG,that the ayah must be left behind. But Punch found a thousand
536,THE FIRST BAG,"fascinating things in the rope, block, and steam-pipe line on the big"
537,THE FIRST BAG,"P. and O. Steamer, long before Meeta and the ayah had dried their"
538,THE FIRST BAG,tears.
539,THE FIRST BAG,
540,THE FIRST BAG,"""Come back, Punch-baba,"" said the ayah."
541,THE FIRST BAG,
542,THE FIRST BAG,"""Come back,"" said Meeta, ""and be a Burra Sahib."""
543,THE FIRST BAG,
544,THE FIRST BAG,"""Yes,"" said Punch, lifted up in his father's arms to wave good-bye."
545,THE FIRST BAG,"""Yes, I will come back, and I will be a Burra Sahib Bahadur!"""
546,THE FIRST BAG,
547,THE FIRST BAG,"At the end of the first day Punch demanded to be set down in England,"
548,THE FIRST BAG,which he was certain must be close at hand. Next day there was a merry
549,THE FIRST BAG,"breeze, and Punch was very sick. ""When I come back to Bombay,"" said"
550,THE FIRST BAG,"Punch on his recovery, ""I will come by the road--in a broom-gharri."
551,THE FIRST BAG,"This is a very naughty ship."""
552,THE FIRST BAG,
553,THE FIRST BAG,"The Swedish boatswain consoled him, and he modified his opinions as"
554,THE FIRST BAG,the voyage went on. There was so much to see and to handle and ask
555,THE FIRST BAG,questions about that Punch nearly forgot the ayah and Meeta and the
556,THE FIRST BAG,"hamal, and with difficulty remembered a few words of the Hindustani"
557,THE FIRST BAG,once his second-speech.
558,THE FIRST BAG,
559,THE FIRST BAG,But Judy was much worse. The day before the steamer reached
560,THE FIRST BAG,"Southampton, Mamma asked her if she would not like to see the ayah"
561,THE FIRST BAG,again. Judy's blue eyes turned to the stretch of sea that had
562,THE FIRST BAG,"swallowed all her tiny past, and she said: ""Ayah! What ayah?"""
563,THE FIRST BAG,
564,THE FIRST BAG,"Mamma cried over her, and Punch marveled. It was then that he heard"
565,THE FIRST BAG,for the first time Mamma's passionate appeal to him never to let Judy
566,THE FIRST BAG,"forget Mamma. Seeing that Judy was young, ridiculously young, and that"
567,THE FIRST BAG,"Mamma, every evening for four weeks past, had come into the cabin to"
568,THE FIRST BAG,sing her and Punch to sleep with a mysterious tune that he called
569,THE FIRST BAG,"""Sonny, my soul,"" Punch could not understand what Mamma meant. But he"
570,THE FIRST BAG,"strove to do his duty, for the moment Mamma left the cabin, he said to"
571,THE FIRST BAG,"Judy: ""Ju, you bemember Mamma?"""
572,THE FIRST BAG,
573,THE FIRST BAG,"""'Torse I do,"" said Judy."
574,THE FIRST BAG,
575,THE FIRST BAG,"""Then always bemember Mamma, 'r else I won't give you the paper ducks"
576,THE FIRST BAG,"that the red-haired Captain Sahib cut out for me."""
577,THE FIRST BAG,
578,THE FIRST BAG,"So Judy promised always to ""bemember Mamma."""
579,THE FIRST BAG,
580,THE FIRST BAG,"Many and many a time was Mamma's command laid upon Punch, and Papa"
581,THE FIRST BAG,would say the same thing with an insistence that awed the child.
582,THE FIRST BAG,
583,THE FIRST BAG,"""You must make haste and learn to write, Punch,"" said Papa, ""and then"
584,THE FIRST BAG,"you'll be able to write letters to us in Bombay."""
585,THE FIRST BAG,
586,THE FIRST BAG,"""I'll come into your room,"" said Punch, and Papa choked."
587,THE FIRST BAG,
588,THE FIRST BAG,Papa and Mamma were always choking in those days. If Punch took Judy
589,THE FIRST BAG,"to task for not ""bemembering,"" they choked. If Punch sprawled on the"
590,THE FIRST BAG,sofa in the Southampton lodging-house and sketched his future in
591,THE FIRST BAG,"purple and gold, they choked; and so they did if Judy put up her mouth"
592,THE FIRST BAG,for a kiss.
593,THE FIRST BAG,
594,THE FIRST BAG,Through many days all four were vagabonds on the face of the earth:
595,THE FIRST BAG,"Punch with no one to give orders to, Judy too young for anything, and"
596,THE FIRST BAG,"Papa and Mamma grave, distracted, and choking."
597,THE FIRST BAG,
598,THE FIRST BAG,"""Where,"" demanded Punch, wearied of a loathsome contrivance on four"
599,THE FIRST BAG,"wheels with a mound of luggage atop--""where is our broom-gharri? This"
600,THE FIRST BAG,thing talks so much that I can't talk. Where is our own broom-gharri?
601,THE FIRST BAG,"When I was at Bandstand before we comed away, I asked Inverarity Sahib"
602,THE FIRST BAG,"why he was sitting in it, and he said it was his own. And I said, 'I"
603,THE FIRST BAG,"will give it you'--I like Inverarity Sahib--and I said, 'Can you put"
604,THE FIRST BAG,your legs through the pully-wag loops by the windows? And Inverarity
605,THE FIRST BAG,"Sahib said No, and laughed. I can put my legs through the pully-wag"
606,THE FIRST BAG,"loops. I can put my legs through these pully-wag loops. Look! Oh,"
607,THE FIRST BAG,"Mamma's crying again! I did n't know. I was n't not to do so."""
608,THE FIRST BAG,
609,THE FIRST BAG,Punch drew his legs out of the loops of the four-wheeler: the door
610,THE FIRST BAG,"opened and he slid to the earth, in a cascade of parcels, at the door"
611,THE FIRST BAG,"of an austere little villa whose gates bore the legend ""Downe Lodge."""
612,THE FIRST BAG,Punch gathered himself together and eyed the house with disfavour. It
613,THE FIRST BAG,"stood on a sandy road, and a cold wind tickled his knickerbockered"
614,THE FIRST BAG,legs.
615,THE FIRST BAG,
616,THE FIRST BAG,"""Let us go away,"" said Punch. ""This is not a pretty place."""
617,THE FIRST BAG,
618,THE FIRST BAG,"But Mamma and Papa and Judy had quitted the cab, and all the luggage"
619,THE FIRST BAG,was being taken into the house. At the door-step stood a woman in
620,THE FIRST BAG,"black, and she smiled largely, with dry chapped lips. Behind her was a"
621,THE FIRST BAG,"man, big, bony, gray, and lame as to one leg--behind him a boy of"
622,THE FIRST BAG,"twelve, black-haired and oily in appearance. Punch surveyed the trio,"
623,THE FIRST BAG,"and advanced without fear, as he had been accustomed to do in Bombay"
624,THE FIRST BAG,when callers came and he happened to be playing in the veranda.
625,THE FIRST BAG,
626,THE FIRST BAG,"""How do you do?"" said he. ""I am Punch."" But they were all looking at"
627,THE FIRST BAG,"the luggage--all except the gray man, who shook hands with Punch and"
628,THE FIRST BAG,"said he was a ""smart little fellow."" There was much running about and"
629,THE FIRST BAG,"banging of boxes, and Punch curled himself up on the sofa in the"
630,THE FIRST BAG,dining-room and considered things.
631,THE FIRST BAG,
632,THE FIRST BAG,"""I don't like these people,"" said Punch. ""But never mind. We'll go"
633,THE FIRST BAG,away soon. We have always went away soon from everywhere. I wish we
634,THE FIRST BAG,"was gone back to Bombay soon."""
635,THE FIRST BAG,
636,THE FIRST BAG,"The wish bore no fruit. For six days Mamma wept at intervals, and"
637,THE FIRST BAG,showed the woman in black all Punch's clothes--a liberty which Punch
638,THE FIRST BAG,"resented. ""But p'raps she's a new white ayah,"" he thought. ""I'm to"
639,THE FIRST BAG,"call her Antirosa, but she does n't call me Sahib. She says just"
640,THE FIRST BAG,"Punch,"" he confided to Judy. ""What is Antirosa?"""
641,THE FIRST BAG,
642,THE FIRST BAG,Judy did n't know. Neither she nor Punch had heard anything of an
643,THE FIRST BAG,"animal called an aunt. Their world had been Papa and Mamma, who knew"
644,THE FIRST BAG,"everything, permitted everything, and loved everybody--even Punch when"
645,THE FIRST BAG,he used to go into the garden at Bombay and fill his nails with mold
646,THE FIRST BAG,"after the weekly nail-cutting, because, as he explained between two"
647,THE FIRST BAG,"strokes of the slipper to his sorely tried Father, his fingers ""felt"
648,THE FIRST BAG,"so new at the ends."""
649,THE FIRST BAG,
650,THE FIRST BAG,In an undefined way Punch judged it advisable to keep both parents
651,THE FIRST BAG,between himself and the woman in black and the boy in black hair. He
652,THE FIRST BAG,"did not approve of them. He liked the gray man, who had expressed a"
653,THE FIRST BAG,"wish to be called ""Uncleharri."" They nodded at each other when they"
654,THE FIRST BAG,"met, and the gray man showed him a little ship with rigging that took"
655,THE FIRST BAG,up and down.
656,THE FIRST BAG,
657,THE FIRST BAG,"""She is a model of the _Brisk_--the little _Brisk_ that was sore"
658,THE FIRST BAG,"exposed that day at Navarino."" The gray man hummed the last words and"
659,THE FIRST BAG,"fell into a reverie. ""I'll tell you about Navarino, Punch, when we go"
660,THE FIRST BAG,"for walks together; and you must n't touch the ship, because she's the"
661,THE FIRST BAG,"_Brisk_."""
662,THE FIRST BAG,
663,THE FIRST BAG,"Long before that walk, the first of many, was taken, they roused Punch"
664,THE FIRST BAG,and Judy in the chill dawn of a February morning to say Good-bye; and
665,THE FIRST BAG,of all people in the wide earth to Papa and Mamma--both crying this
666,THE FIRST BAG,time. Punch was very sleepy and Judy was cross.
667,THE FIRST BAG,
668,THE FIRST BAG,"""Don't forget us,"" pleaded Mamma. ""Oh, my little son, don't forget us,"
669,THE FIRST BAG,"and see that Judy remembers too."""
670,THE FIRST BAG,
671,THE FIRST BAG,"""I've told Judy to bemember,"" said Punch, wiggling, for his father's"
672,THE FIRST BAG,"beard tickled his neck. ""I've told Judy--ten--forty--'leven thousand"
673,THE FIRST BAG,"times. But Ju 's so young--quite a baby--is n't she?"""
674,THE FIRST BAG,
675,THE FIRST BAG,"""Yes,"" said Papa, ""Quite a baby, and you must be good to Judy, and"
676,THE FIRST BAG,"make haste to learn to write and--and--and----"""
677,THE FIRST BAG,
678,THE FIRST BAG,"Punch was back in his bed again. Judy was fast asleep, and there was"
679,THE FIRST BAG,the rattle of a cab below. Papa and Mamma had gone away. Not to
680,THE FIRST BAG,"Nassick; that was across the sea. To some place much nearer, of"
681,THE FIRST BAG,"course, and equally of course they would return. They came back after"
682,THE FIRST BAG,"dinner-parties, and Papa had come back after he had been to a place"
683,THE FIRST BAG,"called ""The Snows,"" and Mamma with him, to Punch and Judy at Mrs."
684,THE FIRST BAG,Inverarity's house in Marine Lines. Assuredly they would come back
685,THE FIRST BAG,"again. So Punch fell asleep till the true morning, when the"
686,THE FIRST BAG,black-haired boy met him with the information that Papa and Mamma had
687,THE FIRST BAG,"gone to Bombay, and that he and Judy were to stay at Downe Lodge"
688,THE FIRST BAG,"""forever."" Antirosa, tearfully appealed to for a contradiction, said"
689,THE FIRST BAG,"that Harry had spoken the truth, and that it behooved Punch to fold up"
690,THE FIRST BAG,his clothes neatly on going to bed. Punch went out and wept bitterly
691,THE FIRST BAG,"with Judy, into whose fair head he had driven some ideas of the"
692,THE FIRST BAG,meaning of separation.
693,THE FIRST BAG,
694,THE FIRST BAG,"When a matured man discovers that he has been deserted by Providence,"
695,THE FIRST BAG,"deprived of his God, and cast without help, comfort, or sympathy, upon"
696,THE FIRST BAG,"a world which is new and strange to him, his despair, which may find"
697,THE FIRST BAG,"expression in evil-living, the writing of his experiences, or the more"
698,THE FIRST BAG,"satisfactory diversion of suicide, is generally supposed to be"
699,THE FIRST BAG,"impressive. A child, under exactly similar circumstances as far as its"
700,THE FIRST BAG,"knowledge goes, cannot very well curse God and die. It howls till its"
701,THE FIRST BAG,"nose is red, its eyes are sore, and its head aches. Punch and Judy,"
702,THE FIRST BAG,"through no fault of their own, had lost all their world. They sat in"
703,THE FIRST BAG,the hall and cried; the black-haired boy looking on from afar.
704,THE FIRST BAG,
705,THE FIRST BAG,"The model of the ship availed nothing, though the gray man assured"
706,THE FIRST BAG,Punch that he might pull the rigging up and down as much as he
707,THE FIRST BAG,pleased; and Judy was promised free entry into the kitchen. They
708,THE FIRST BAG,"wanted Papa and Mamma, gone to Bombay beyond the seas, and their grief"
709,THE FIRST BAG,while it lasted was without remedy.
710,THE FIRST BAG,
711,THE FIRST BAG,When the tears ceased the house was very still. Antirosa had decided
712,THE FIRST BAG,"it was better to let the children ""have their cry out,"" and the boy"
713,THE FIRST BAG,had gone to school. Punch raised his head from the floor and sniffed
714,THE FIRST BAG,mournfully. Judy was nearly asleep. Three short years had not taught
715,THE FIRST BAG,"her how to bear sorrow with full knowledge. There was a distant, dull"
716,THE FIRST BAG,boom in the air--a repeated heavy thud. Punch knew that sound in
717,THE FIRST BAG,Bombay in the Monsoon. It was the sea--the sea that must be traversed
718,THE FIRST BAG,before anyone could get to Bombay.
719,THE FIRST BAG,
720,THE FIRST BAG,"""Quick, Ju!"" he cried, ""we're close to the sea. I can hear it! Listen!"
721,THE FIRST BAG,That's where they've went. P'raps we can catch them if we was in time.
722,THE FIRST BAG,"They did n't mean to go without us. They've only forgot."""
723,THE FIRST BAG,
724,THE FIRST BAG,"""Iss,"" said Judy. ""They've only forgotted. Less go to the sea."""
725,THE FIRST BAG,
726,THE FIRST BAG,The hall-door was open and so was the garden-gate.
727,THE FIRST BAG,
728,THE FIRST BAG,"""It's very, very big, this place,"" he said, looking cautiously down"
729,THE FIRST BAG,"the road, ""and we will get lost; but I will find a man and order him"
730,THE FIRST BAG,"to take me back to my house--like I did in Bombay."""
731,THE FIRST BAG,
732,THE FIRST BAG,"He took Judy by the hand, and the two fled hatless in the direction of"
733,THE FIRST BAG,the sound of the sea. Downe Villa was almost the last of a range of
734,THE FIRST BAG,"newly built houses running out, through a chaos of brick-mounds, to a"
735,THE FIRST BAG,heath where gypsies occasionally camped and where the Garrison
736,THE FIRST BAG,"Artillery of Rocklington practised. There were few people to be seen,"
737,THE FIRST BAG,"and the children might have been taken for those of the soldiery, who"
738,THE FIRST BAG,ranged far. Half an hour the wearied little legs tramped across
739,THE FIRST BAG,"heath, potato-field, and sand-dune."
740,THE FIRST BAG,
741,THE FIRST BAG,"""I'se so tired,"" said Judy, ""and Mamma will be angry."""
742,THE FIRST BAG,
743,THE FIRST BAG,"""Mamma's never angry. I suppose she is waiting at the sea now while"
744,THE FIRST BAG,"Papa gets tickets. We'll find them and go along with them. Ju, you"
745,THE FIRST BAG,"must n't sit down. Only a little more and we'll come to the sea. Ju,"
746,THE FIRST BAG,"if you sit down I'll thmack you!"" said Punch."
747,THE FIRST BAG,
748,THE FIRST BAG,"They climbed another dune, and came upon the great gray sea at low"
749,THE FIRST BAG,"tide. Hundreds of crabs were scuttling about the beach, but there was"
750,THE FIRST BAG,no trace of Papa and Mamma not even of a ship upon the waters--nothing
751,THE FIRST BAG,but sand and mud for miles and miles.
752,THE FIRST BAG,
753,THE FIRST BAG,"And ""Uncleharri"" found them by chance--very muddy and very"
754,THE FIRST BAG,"forlorn--Punch dissolved in tears, but trying to divert Judy with an"
755,THE FIRST BAG,"""ickle trab,"" and Judy wailing to the pitiless horizon for ""Mamma,"
756,THE FIRST BAG,"Mamma!""--and again ""Mamma!"""
757,THE FIRST BAG,
758,THE FIRST BAG,
759,THE SECOND BAG,THE SECOND BAG
760,THE SECOND BAG,
761,THE SECOND BAG,"Ah, well-a-day, for we are souls bereaved!"
762,THE SECOND BAG,Of all the creatures under Heaven's wide scope
763,THE SECOND BAG,"We are most hopeless, who had once most hope,"
764,THE SECOND BAG,"And most beliefless, who had most believed."
765,THE SECOND BAG,
766,THE SECOND BAG,--_The City of Dreadful Night._
767,THE SECOND BAG,
768,THE SECOND BAG,
769,THE SECOND BAG,"All this time not a word about Black Sheep. He came later, and Harry,"
770,THE SECOND BAG,"the black-haired boy, was mainly responsible for his coming."
771,THE SECOND BAG,"Judy--who could help loving little Judy?--passed, by special permit,"
772,THE SECOND BAG,into the kitchen and thence straight to Aunty Rosa's heart. Harry was
773,THE SECOND BAG,"Aunty Rosa's one child, and Punch was the extra boy about the house."
774,THE SECOND BAG,"There was no special place for him or his little affairs, and he was"
775,THE SECOND BAG,forbidden to sprawl on sofas and explain his ideas about the
776,THE SECOND BAG,manufacture of this world and his hopes for his future. Sprawling was
777,THE SECOND BAG,"lazy and wore out sofas, and little boys were not expected to talk."
778,THE SECOND BAG,"They were talked to, and the talking to was intended for the benefit"
779,THE SECOND BAG,"of their morals. As the unquestioned despot of the house at Bombay,"
780,THE SECOND BAG,Punch could not quite understand how he came to be of no account in
781,THE SECOND BAG,this new life.
782,THE SECOND BAG,
783,THE SECOND BAG,Harry might reach across the table and take what he wanted; Judy might
784,THE SECOND BAG,point and get what she wanted. Punch was forbidden to do either. The
785,THE SECOND BAG,gray man was his great hope and stand-by for many months after Mamma
786,THE SECOND BAG,"and Papa left, and he had forgotten to tell Judy to ""bemember Mamma."""
787,THE SECOND BAG,
788,THE SECOND BAG,"This lapse was excusable, because in the interval he had been"
789,THE SECOND BAG,introduced by Aunty Rosa to two very impressive things--an abstraction
790,THE SECOND BAG,"called God, the intimate friend and ally of Aunty Rosa, generally"
791,THE SECOND BAG,believed to live behind the kitchen-range because it was hot
792,THE SECOND BAG,there--and a dirty brown book filled with unintelligible dots and
793,THE SECOND BAG,"marks. Punch was always anxious to oblige everybody. He, therefore,"
794,THE SECOND BAG,welded the story of the Creation on to what he could recollect of his
795,THE SECOND BAG,"Indian fairy tales, and scandalized Aunty Rosa by repeating the result"
796,THE SECOND BAG,"to Judy. It was a sin, a grievous sin, and Punch was talked to for a"
797,THE SECOND BAG,quarter of an hour. He could not understand where the iniquity came
798,THE SECOND BAG,"in, but was careful not to repeat the offence, because Aunty Rosa told"
799,THE SECOND BAG,him that God had heard every word he had said and was very angry. If
800,THE SECOND BAG,"this were true why did n't God come and say so, thought Punch, and"
801,THE SECOND BAG,dismissed the matter from his mind. Afterward he learned to know the
802,THE SECOND BAG,Lord as the only thing in the world more awful than Aunty Rosa--as a
803,THE SECOND BAG,Creature that stood in the background and counted the strokes of the
804,THE SECOND BAG,cane.
805,THE SECOND BAG,
806,THE SECOND BAG,"But the reading was, just then, a much more serious matter than any"
807,THE SECOND BAG,creed. Aunty Rosa sat him upon a table and told him that A B meant ab.
808,THE SECOND BAG,
809,THE SECOND BAG,"""Why?"" said Punch. ""A is a and B is bee. Why does A B mean ab?"""
810,THE SECOND BAG,
811,THE SECOND BAG,"""Because I tell you it does,"" said Aunty Rosa ""and you've got to say"
812,THE SECOND BAG,"it."""
813,THE SECOND BAG,
814,THE SECOND BAG,"Punch said it accordingly, and for a month, hugely against his will,"
815,THE SECOND BAG,"stumbled through the brown book, not in the least comprehending what"
816,THE SECOND BAG,"it meant. But Uncle Harry, who walked much and generally alone, was"
817,THE SECOND BAG,wont to come into the nursery and suggest to Aunty Rosa that Punch
818,THE SECOND BAG,"should walk with him. He seldom spoke, but he showed Punch all"
819,THE SECOND BAG,"Rocklington, from the mud-banks and the sand of the back-bay to the"
820,THE SECOND BAG,"great harbours where ships lay at anchor, and the dockyards where the"
821,THE SECOND BAG,"hammers were never still, and the marine-store shops, and the shiny"
822,THE SECOND BAG,brass counters in the Offices where Uncle Harry went once every three
823,THE SECOND BAG,months with a slip of blue paper and received sovereigns in exchange;
824,THE SECOND BAG,"for he held a wound-pension. Punch heard, too, from his lips the story"
825,THE SECOND BAG,"of the battle of Navarino, where the sailors of the Fleet, for three"
826,THE SECOND BAG,"days afterward, were deaf as posts and could only sign to each other."
827,THE SECOND BAG,"""That was because of the noise of the guns,"" said Uncle Harry, ""and I"
828,THE SECOND BAG,"have got the wadding of a bullet somewhere inside me now."""
829,THE SECOND BAG,
830,THE SECOND BAG,Punch regarded him with curiosity. He had not the least idea what
831,THE SECOND BAG,"wadding was, and his notion of a bullet was a dockyard cannon-ball"
832,THE SECOND BAG,bigger than his own head. How could Uncle Harry keep a cannon-ball
833,THE SECOND BAG,"inside him? He was ashamed to ask, for fear Uncle Harry might be"
834,THE SECOND BAG,angry.
835,THE SECOND BAG,
836,THE SECOND BAG,Punch had never known what anger--real anger--meant until one terrible
837,THE SECOND BAG,"day when Harry had taken his paint-box to paint a boat with, and Punch"
838,THE SECOND BAG,had protested with a loud and lamentable voice. Then Uncle Harry had
839,THE SECOND BAG,"appeared on the scene and, muttering something about ""strangers'"
840,THE SECOND BAG,"children,"" had with a stick smitten the black-haired boy across the"
841,THE SECOND BAG,"shoulders till he wept and yelled, and Aunty Rosa came in and abused"
842,THE SECOND BAG,"Uncle Harry for cruelty to his own flesh and blood, and Punch"
843,THE SECOND BAG,"shuddered to the tips of his shoes. ""It was n't my fault,"" he"
844,THE SECOND BAG,"explained to the boy, but both Harry and Aunty Rosa said that it was,"
845,THE SECOND BAG,"and that Punch had told tales, and for a week there were no more walks"
846,THE SECOND BAG,with Uncle Harry.
847,THE SECOND BAG,
848,THE SECOND BAG,But that week brought a great joy to Punch.
849,THE SECOND BAG,
850,THE SECOND BAG,"He had repeated till he was thrice weary the statement that ""the Cat"
851,THE SECOND BAG,"lay on the Mat and the Rat came in."""
852,THE SECOND BAG,
853,THE SECOND BAG,"""Now I can truly read,"" said Punch, ""and now I will never read"
854,THE SECOND BAG,"anything in the world."""
855,THE SECOND BAG,
856,THE SECOND BAG,He put the brown book in the cupboard where his schoolbooks lived and
857,THE SECOND BAG,"accidentally tumbled out a venerable volume, without covers, labelled"
858,THE SECOND BAG,_Sharpe's Magazine_. There was the most portentous picture of a
859,THE SECOND BAG,"Griffin on the first page, with verses below. The Griffin carried off"
860,THE SECOND BAG,"one sheep a day from a German village, till a man came with a"
861,THE SECOND BAG,"""falchion"" and split the Griffin open. Goodness only knew what a"
862,THE SECOND BAG,"falchion was, but there was the Griffin, and his history was an"
863,THE SECOND BAG,improvement upon the eternal Cat.
864,THE SECOND BAG,
865,THE SECOND BAG,"""This,"" said Punch, ""means things, and now I will know all about"
866,THE SECOND BAG,"everything in all the world."" He read till the light failed, not"
867,THE SECOND BAG,"understanding a tithe of the meaning, but tantalized by glimpses of"
868,THE SECOND BAG,new worlds hereafter to be revealed.
869,THE SECOND BAG,
870,THE SECOND BAG,"""What is a 'falchion'? What is a 'e-wee lamb'? What is a 'base"
871,THE SECOND BAG,"ussurper'? What is a 'verdant me-ad'? he demanded, with flushed"
872,THE SECOND BAG,"cheeks, at bedtime, of the astonished Aunt Rosa."
873,THE SECOND BAG,
874,THE SECOND BAG,"""Say your prayers and go to sleep,"" she replied, and that was all the"
875,THE SECOND BAG,help Punch then or afterward found at her hands in the new and
876,THE SECOND BAG,delightful exercise of reading.
877,THE SECOND BAG,
878,THE SECOND BAG,"""Aunt Rosa only knows about God and things like that,"" argued Punch."
879,THE SECOND BAG,"""Uncle Harry will tell me."""
880,THE SECOND BAG,
881,THE SECOND BAG,The next walk proved that Uncle Harry could not help either; but he
882,THE SECOND BAG,"allowed Punch to talk, and even sat down on a bench to hear about the"
883,THE SECOND BAG,Griffin. Other walks brought other stories as Punch ranged farther
884,THE SECOND BAG,"afield, for the house held large store of old books that no one ever"
885,THE SECOND BAG,"opened--from Frank Fairlegh in serial numbers, and the earlier poems"
886,THE SECOND BAG,"of Tennyson, contributed anonymously to _Sharpe's Magazine_, to '62"
887,THE SECOND BAG,"Exhibition Catalogues, gay with colours and delightfully"
888,THE SECOND BAG,"incomprehensible, and odd leaves of ""Gulliver's Travels."""
889,THE SECOND BAG,
890,THE SECOND BAG,"As soon as Punch could string a few pot-hooks together, he wrote to"
891,THE SECOND BAG,"Bombay, demanding by return of post ""all the books in all the world."""
892,THE SECOND BAG,"Papa could not comply with this modest indent, but sent ""Grimm's Fairy"
893,THE SECOND BAG,"Tales"" and a ""Hans Andersen."" That was enough. If he were only left"
894,THE SECOND BAG,"alone Punch could pass, at any hour he chose, into a land of his own,"
895,THE SECOND BAG,"beyond reach of Aunty Rosa and her God, Harry and his teasements, and"
896,THE SECOND BAG,Judy's claims to be played with.
897,THE SECOND BAG,
898,THE SECOND BAG,"""Don't disturb me, I'm reading. Go and play in the kitchen,"" grunted"
899,THE SECOND BAG,"Punch. ""Aunty Rosa lets you go there."" Judy was cutting her second"
900,THE SECOND BAG,"teeth and was fretful. She appealed to Aunty Rosa, who descended on"
901,THE SECOND BAG,Punch.
902,THE SECOND BAG,
903,THE SECOND BAG,"""I was reading,"" he explained, ""reading a book. I want to read."""
904,THE SECOND BAG,
905,THE SECOND BAG,"""You're only doing that to show off,"" said Aunty Rosa. ""But we'll see."
906,THE SECOND BAG,"Play with Judy now, and don't open a book for a week."""
907,THE SECOND BAG,
908,THE SECOND BAG,"Judy did not pass a very enjoyable playtime with Punch, who was"
909,THE SECOND BAG,consumed with indignation. There was a pettiness at the bottom of the
910,THE SECOND BAG,prohibition which puzzled him.
911,THE SECOND BAG,
912,THE SECOND BAG,"""It's what I like to do,"" he said, ""and she's found out that and"
913,THE SECOND BAG,"stopped me. Don't cry, Ju--it was n't your fault--please don't cry, or"
914,THE SECOND BAG,"she'll say I made you."""
915,THE SECOND BAG,
916,THE SECOND BAG,"Ju loyally mopped up her tears, and the two played in their nursery, a"
917,THE SECOND BAG,"room in the basement and half underground, to which they were"
918,THE SECOND BAG,regularly sent after the midday dinner while Aunty Rosa slept. She
919,THE SECOND BAG,"drank wine--that is to say, something from a bottle in the"
920,THE SECOND BAG,"cellaret--for her stomach's sake, but if she did not fall asleep she"
921,THE SECOND BAG,would sometimes come into the nursery to see that the children were
922,THE SECOND BAG,"really playing. Now bricks, wooden hoops, ninepins, and chinaware"
923,THE SECOND BAG,"cannot amuse forever, especially when all Fairyland is to be won by"
924,THE SECOND BAG,"the mere opening of a book, and, as often as not, Punch would be"
925,THE SECOND BAG,discovered reading to Judy or tell her interminable tales. That was an
926,THE SECOND BAG,"offence in the eyes of the law, and Judy would be whisked off by Aunty"
927,THE SECOND BAG,"Rosa, while Punch was left to play alone, ""and be sure that I hear you"
928,THE SECOND BAG,"doing it."""
929,THE SECOND BAG,
930,THE SECOND BAG,"It was not a cheering employ, for he had to make a playful noise. At"
931,THE SECOND BAG,"last, with infinite craft, he devised an arrangement whereby the table"
932,THE SECOND BAG,"could be supported as to three legs on toy bricks, leaving the fourth"
933,THE SECOND BAG,clear to bring down on the floor. He could work the table with one
934,THE SECOND BAG,hand and hold a book with the other. This he did till an evil day when
935,THE SECOND BAG,"Aunty Rosa pounced upon him unawares and told him that he was ""acting"
936,THE SECOND BAG,"a lie."""
937,THE SECOND BAG,
938,THE SECOND BAG,"""If you're old enough to do that,"" she said--her temper was always"
939,THE SECOND BAG,"worst after dinner--""you're old enough to be beaten."""
940,THE SECOND BAG,
941,THE SECOND BAG,"""But--I'm--I'm not a animal!"" said Punch, aghast. He remembered Uncle"
942,THE SECOND BAG,"Harry and the stick, and turned white. Aunty Rosa had hidden a light"
943,THE SECOND BAG,"cane behind her, and Punch was beaten then and there over the"
944,THE SECOND BAG,"shoulders. It was a revelation to him. The room door was shut, and he"
945,THE SECOND BAG,was left to weep himself into repentance and work out his own Gospel
946,THE SECOND BAG,of Life.
947,THE SECOND BAG,
948,THE SECOND BAG,"Aunty Rosa, he argued, had the power to beat him with many stripes. It"
949,THE SECOND BAG,was unjust and cruel and Mamma and Papa would never have allowed it.
950,THE SECOND BAG,"Unless perhaps, as Aunty Rosa seemed to imply, they had sent secret"
951,THE SECOND BAG,orders. In which case he was abandoned indeed. It would be discreet in
952,THE SECOND BAG,"the future to propitiate Aunty Rosa, but, then, again, even in matters"
953,THE SECOND BAG,"in which he was innocent, he had been accused of wishing to ""show"
954,THE SECOND BAG,"off."" He had ""shown off"" before visitors when he had attacked a"
955,THE SECOND BAG,"strange gentleman--Harry's uncle, not his own--with requests for"
956,THE SECOND BAG,"information about the Griffin and the falchion, and the precise nature"
957,THE SECOND BAG,of the Tilbury in which Frank Fairlegh rode--all points of paramount
958,THE SECOND BAG,interest which he was bursting to understand. Clearly it would not do
959,THE SECOND BAG,to pretend to care for Aunty Rosa.
960,THE SECOND BAG,
961,THE SECOND BAG,"At this point Harry entered and stood afar off, eying Punch, a"
962,THE SECOND BAG,"disheveled heap in the corner of the room, with disgust."
963,THE SECOND BAG,
964,THE SECOND BAG,"""You're a liar--a young liar,"" said Harry, with great unction, ""and"
965,THE SECOND BAG,you're to have tea down here because you're not fit to speak to us.
966,THE SECOND BAG,And you're not to speak to Judy again till Mother gives you leave.
967,THE SECOND BAG,You'll corrupt her. You're only fit to associate with the servant.
968,THE SECOND BAG,"Mother says so."""
969,THE SECOND BAG,
970,THE SECOND BAG,Having reduced Punch to a second agony of tears Harry departed
971,THE SECOND BAG,upstairs with the news that Punch was still rebellious.
972,THE SECOND BAG,
973,THE SECOND BAG,"Uncle Harry sat uneasily in the dining-room. ""D---- it all, Rosa,"""
974,THE SECOND BAG,"said he at last, ""can't you leave the child alone? He's a good enough"
975,THE SECOND BAG,"little chap when I meet him."""
976,THE SECOND BAG,
977,THE SECOND BAG,"""He puts on his best manners with you, Henry,"" said Aunty Rosa, ""but"
978,THE SECOND BAG,"I'm afraid, I'm very much afraid, that he is the Black Sheep of the"
979,THE SECOND BAG,"family."""
980,THE SECOND BAG,
981,THE SECOND BAG,Harry heard and stored up the name for future use. Judy cried till she
982,THE SECOND BAG,"was bidden to stop, her brother not being worth tears; and the evening"
983,THE SECOND BAG,concluded with the return of Punch to the upper regions and a private
984,THE SECOND BAG,sitting at which all the blinding horrors of Hell were revealed to
985,THE SECOND BAG,Punch with such store of imagery as Aunty Rosa's narrow mind
986,THE SECOND BAG,possessed.
987,THE SECOND BAG,
988,THE SECOND BAG,"Most grievous of all was Judy's round-eyed reproach, and Punch went to"
989,THE SECOND BAG,bed in the depths of the Valley of Humiliation. He shared his room
990,THE SECOND BAG,with Harry and knew the torture in store. For an hour and a half he
991,THE SECOND BAG,had to answer that young gentleman's question as to his motives for
992,THE SECOND BAG,"telling a lie, and a grievous lie, the precise quantity of punishment"
993,THE SECOND BAG,"inflicted by Aunty Rosa, and had also to profess his deep gratitude"
994,THE SECOND BAG,for such religious instruction as Harry thought fit to impart.
995,THE SECOND BAG,
996,THE SECOND BAG,"From that day began the downfall of Punch, now Black Sheep."
997,THE SECOND BAG,
998,THE SECOND BAG,"""Untrustworthy in one thing, untrustworthy in all,"" said Aunty Rosa,"
999,THE SECOND BAG,and Harry felt that Black Sheep was delivered into his hands. He
1000,THE SECOND BAG,would wake him up in the night to ask him why he was such a liar.
1001,THE SECOND BAG,
1002,THE SECOND BAG,"""I don't know,"" Punch would reply."
1003,THE SECOND BAG,
1004,THE SECOND BAG,"""Then don't you think you ought to get up and pray to God for a new"
1005,THE SECOND BAG,"heart?"""
1006,THE SECOND BAG,
1007,THE SECOND BAG,"""Y-yess."""
1008,THE SECOND BAG,
1009,THE SECOND BAG,"""Get out and pray, then!"" And Punch would get out of bed with raging"
1010,THE SECOND BAG,"hate in his heart against all the world, seen and unseen. He was"
1011,THE SECOND BAG,always tumbling into trouble. Harry had a knack of cross-examining him
1012,THE SECOND BAG,"as to his day's doings, which seldom failed to lead him, sleepy and"
1013,THE SECOND BAG,"savage, into half a dozen contradictions--all duly reported to Aunty"
1014,THE SECOND BAG,Rosa next morning.
1015,THE SECOND BAG,
1016,THE SECOND BAG,"""But it was n't a lie,"" Punch would begin, charging into a laboured"
1017,THE SECOND BAG,"explanation that landed him more hopelessly in the mire. ""I said that"
1018,THE SECOND BAG,"I did n't say my prayers twice over in the day, and that was on"
1019,THE SECOND BAG,"Tuesday. Once I did, I know I did, but Harry said I did n't,"" and so"
1020,THE SECOND BAG,"forth, till the tension brought tears, and he was dismissed from the"
1021,THE SECOND BAG,table in disgrace.
1022,THE SECOND BAG,
1023,THE SECOND BAG,"""You use n't to be as bad as this?"" said Judy, awe-stricken at the"
1024,THE SECOND BAG,"catalogue of Black Sheep's crimes. ""Why are you so bad now?"""
1025,THE SECOND BAG,
1026,THE SECOND BAG,"""I don't know,"" Black Sheep would reply. ""I'm not, if I only was n't"
1027,THE SECOND BAG,"bothered upside down. I knew what I did, and I want to say so; but"
1028,THE SECOND BAG,"Harry always makes it out different somehow, and Aunty Rosa does n't"
1029,THE SECOND BAG,"believe a word I say. Oh, Ju! don't you say I'm bad too."""
1030,THE SECOND BAG,
1031,THE SECOND BAG,"""Aunty Rosa says you are,"" said Judy. ""She told the Vicar so when he"
1032,THE SECOND BAG,"came yesterday."""
1033,THE SECOND BAG,
1034,THE SECOND BAG,"""Why does she tell all the people outside the house about me? It is"
1035,THE SECOND BAG,"n't fair,"" said Black Sheep. ""When I was in Bombay, and was bad--doing"
1036,THE SECOND BAG,"bad, not made-up bad like this--Mamma told Papa, and Papa told me he"
1037,THE SECOND BAG,"knew, and that was all. Outside people did n't know too--even Meeta"
1038,THE SECOND BAG,"did n't know."""
1039,THE SECOND BAG,
1040,THE SECOND BAG,"""I don't remember,"" said Judy wistfully. ""I was all little then. Mamma"
1041,THE SECOND BAG,"was just as fond of you as she was of me, was n't she?"""
1042,THE SECOND BAG,
1043,THE SECOND BAG,"""'Course she was. So was Papa. So was everybody."""
1044,THE SECOND BAG,
1045,THE SECOND BAG,"""Aunty Rosa likes me more than she does you. She says that you are a"
1046,THE SECOND BAG,"Trial and a Black Sheep, and I'm not to speak to you more than I can"
1047,THE SECOND BAG,"help."""
1048,THE SECOND BAG,
1049,THE SECOND BAG,"""Always? Not outside of the times when you must n't speak to me at"
1050,THE SECOND BAG,"all?"""
1051,THE SECOND BAG,
1052,THE SECOND BAG,"Judy nodded her head mournfully. Black Sheep turned away in despair,"
1053,THE SECOND BAG,but Judy's arms were round his neck.
1054,THE SECOND BAG,
1055,THE SECOND BAG,"""Never mind, Punch,"" she whispered. ""I will speak to you just the same"
1056,THE SECOND BAG,"as ever and ever. You're my own, own brother though you are--though"
1057,THE SECOND BAG,"Aunty Rosa says you're Bad, and Harry says you're a little coward. He"
1058,THE SECOND BAG,"says that if I pulled your hair hard, you'd cry."""
1059,THE SECOND BAG,
1060,THE SECOND BAG,"""Pull, then,"" said Punch."
1061,THE SECOND BAG,
1062,THE SECOND BAG,Judy pulled gingerly.
1063,THE SECOND BAG,
1064,THE SECOND BAG,"""Pull harder--as hard as you can! There! I don't mind how much you"
1065,THE SECOND BAG,pull it now. If you'll speak to me same as ever I'll let you pull it
1066,THE SECOND BAG,as much as you like--pull it out if you like. But I know if Harry came
1067,THE SECOND BAG,"and stood by and made you do it I'd cry."""
1068,THE SECOND BAG,
1069,THE SECOND BAG,"So the two children sealed the compact with a kiss, and Black Sheep's"
1070,THE SECOND BAG,"heart was cheered within him, and by extreme caution and careful"
1071,THE SECOND BAG,avoidance of Harry he acquired virtue and was allowed to read
1072,THE SECOND BAG,undisturbed for a week. Uncle Harry took him for walks and consoled
1073,THE SECOND BAG,"him with rough tenderness, never calling him Black Sheep. ""It's good"
1074,THE SECOND BAG,"for you, I suppose, Punch,"" he used to say. ""Let us sit down. I'm"
1075,THE SECOND BAG,"getting tired."" His steps led him now not to the beach, but to the"
1076,THE SECOND BAG,"Cemetery of Rocklington, amid the potato-fields. For hours the gray"
1077,THE SECOND BAG,"man would sit on a tombstone, while Black Sheep read epitaphs, and"
1078,THE SECOND BAG,then with a sigh would stump home again.
1079,THE SECOND BAG,
1080,THE SECOND BAG,"""I shall lie there soon,"" said he to Black Sheep; one winter evening,"
1081,THE SECOND BAG,when his face showed white as a worn silver coin under the lights of
1082,THE SECOND BAG,"the chapel-lodge. ""You need n't tell Aunty Rosa."""
1083,THE SECOND BAG,
1084,THE SECOND BAG,"A month later, he turned sharp round, ere half a morning walk was"
1085,THE SECOND BAG,"completed, and stumped back to the house. ""Put me to bed, Rosa,"" he"
1086,THE SECOND BAG,"muttered. ""I've walked my last. The wadding has found me out."""
1087,THE SECOND BAG,
1088,THE SECOND BAG,"They put him to bed, and for a fortnight the shadow of his sickness"
1089,THE SECOND BAG,"lay upon the house, and Black Sheep went to and fro unobserved. Papa"
1090,THE SECOND BAG,"had sent him some new books, and he was told to keep quiet. He retired"
1091,THE SECOND BAG,"into his own world, and was perfectly happy. Even at night his"
1092,THE SECOND BAG,felicity was unbroken. He could lie in bed and string himself tales of
1093,THE SECOND BAG,travel and adventure while Harry was downstairs.
1094,THE SECOND BAG,
1095,THE SECOND BAG,"""Uncle Harry's going to die,"" said Judy, who now lived almost entirely"
1096,THE SECOND BAG,with Aunty Rosa.
1097,THE SECOND BAG,
1098,THE SECOND BAG,"""I'm very sorry,"" said Black Sheep soberly. ""He told me that a long"
1099,THE SECOND BAG,"time ago."""
1100,THE SECOND BAG,
1101,THE SECOND BAG,"Aunty Rosa heard the conversation. ""Will nothing check your wicked"
1102,THE SECOND BAG,"tongue?"" she said angrily. There were blue circles round her eyes."
1103,THE SECOND BAG,
1104,THE SECOND BAG,"Black Sheep retreated to the nursery and read ""Cometh up as a Flower"""
1105,THE SECOND BAG,with deep and uncomprehending interest. He had been forbidden to read
1106,THE SECOND BAG,"it on account of its ""sinfulness,"" but the bonds of the Universe were"
1107,THE SECOND BAG,"crumbling, and Aunty Rosa was in great grief."
1108,THE SECOND BAG,
1109,THE SECOND BAG,"""I'm glad,"" said Black Sheep. ""She 's unhappy now. It was n't a lie,"
1110,THE SECOND BAG,"though. I knew. He told me not to tell."""
1111,THE SECOND BAG,
1112,THE SECOND BAG,"That night Black Sheep woke with a start. Harry was not in the room,"
1113,THE SECOND BAG,and there was a sound of sobbing on the next floor. Then the voice of
1114,THE SECOND BAG,"Uncle Harry, singing the song of the Battle of Navarino, cut through"
1115,THE SECOND BAG,the darkness:
1116,THE SECOND BAG,
1117,THE SECOND BAG,"""Our vanship was the Asia--"
1118,THE SECOND BAG,"The Albion and Genoa!"""
1119,THE SECOND BAG,
1120,THE SECOND BAG,"""He 's getting well,"" thought Black Sheep, who knew the song through"
1121,THE SECOND BAG,all its seventeen verses. But the blood froze at his little heart as
1122,THE SECOND BAG,he thought. The voice leapt an octave and rang shrill as a boatswain's
1123,THE SECOND BAG,pipe:
1124,THE SECOND BAG,
1125,THE SECOND BAG,"""And next came on the lovely Rose,"
1126,THE SECOND BAG,"The Philomel, her fire-ship, closed,"
1127,THE SECOND BAG,And the Little Brisk was sore exposed
1128,THE SECOND BAG,"That day at Navarino."""
1129,THE SECOND BAG,
1130,THE SECOND BAG,"""That day at Navarino, Uncle Harry!"" shouted Black Sheep, half wild"
1131,THE SECOND BAG,with excitement and fear of he knew not what.
1132,THE SECOND BAG,
1133,THE SECOND BAG,"A door opened and Aunty Rosa screamed up the staircase: ""Hush! For"
1134,THE SECOND BAG,"God's sake hush, you little devil. Uncle Harry is dead!"""
1135,THE SECOND BAG,
1136,THE SECOND BAG,
1137,THE THIRD BAG,THE THIRD BAG
1138,THE THIRD BAG,
1139,THE THIRD BAG,"Journeys end in lovers' meeting,"
1140,THE THIRD BAG,Every wise man's son doth know.
1141,THE THIRD BAG,
1142,THE THIRD BAG,
1143,THE THIRD BAG,"""I wonder what will happen to me now,"" thought Black Sheep, when the"
1144,THE THIRD BAG,semi-pagan rites peculiar to the burial of the Dead in middle-class
1145,THE THIRD BAG,"houses had been accomplished, and Aunty Rosa, awful in black crape,"
1146,THE THIRD BAG,"had returned to this life. ""I don't think I've done anything bad that"
1147,THE THIRD BAG,she knows of. I suppose I will soon. She will be very cross after
1148,THE THIRD BAG,"Uncle Harry's dying, and Harry will be cross too. I 'll keep in the"
1149,THE THIRD BAG,"nursery."""
1150,THE THIRD BAG,
1151,THE THIRD BAG,"Unfortunately for Punch's plans, it was decided that he should be sent"
1152,THE THIRD BAG,to a day-school which Harry attended. This meant a morning walk with
1153,THE THIRD BAG,"Harry, and perhaps an evening one; but the prospect of freedom in the"
1154,THE THIRD BAG,"interval was refreshing. ""Harry 'll tell everything I do, but I won't"
1155,THE THIRD BAG,"do anything,"" said Black Sheep. Fortified with this virtuous"
1156,THE THIRD BAG,"resolution, he went to school only to find that Harry's version of his"
1157,THE THIRD BAG,"character had preceded him, and that life was a burden in consequence."
1158,THE THIRD BAG,"He took stock of his associates. Some of them were unclean, some of"
1159,THE THIRD BAG,"them talked in dialect, many dropped their h's, and there were two"
1160,THE THIRD BAG,"Jews and a Negro, or someone quite as dark, in the assembly. ""That's a"
1161,THE THIRD BAG,"hubshi,"" said Black Sheep to himself. ""Even Meeta used to laugh at a"
1162,THE THIRD BAG,"hubshi. I don't think this is a proper place."" He was indignant for at"
1163,THE THIRD BAG,"least an hour, till he reflected that any expostulation on his part"
1164,THE THIRD BAG,"would be by Aunty Rosa construed into ""showing off,"" and that Harry"
1165,THE THIRD BAG,would tell the boys.
1166,THE THIRD BAG,
1167,THE THIRD BAG,"""How do you like school?"" said Aunty Rosa at the end of the day."
1168,THE THIRD BAG,
1169,THE THIRD BAG,"""I think it is a very nice place,"" said Punch quietly."
1170,THE THIRD BAG,
1171,THE THIRD BAG,"""I suppose you warned the boys of Black Sheep's character?"" said Aunty"
1172,THE THIRD BAG,Rosa to Harry.
1173,THE THIRD BAG,
1174,THE THIRD BAG,"""Oh, yes!"" said the censor of Black Sheep's morals. ""They know all"
1175,THE THIRD BAG,"about him."""
1176,THE THIRD BAG,
1177,THE THIRD BAG,"""If I was with my father,"" said Black Sheep, stung to the quick, ""I"
1178,THE THIRD BAG,should n't speak to those boys. He would n't let me. They live in
1179,THE THIRD BAG,shops. I saw them go into shops--where their fathers live and sell
1180,THE THIRD BAG,"things."""
1181,THE THIRD BAG,
1182,THE THIRD BAG,"""You're too good for that school, are you?"" said Aunty Rosa, with a"
1183,THE THIRD BAG,"bitter smile. ""You ought to be grateful, Black Sheep, that those boys"
1184,THE THIRD BAG,"speak to you at all. It is n't every school that takes little liars."""
1185,THE THIRD BAG,
1186,THE THIRD BAG,Harry did not fail to make much capital out of Black Sheep's
1187,THE THIRD BAG,"ill-considered remark; with the result that several boys, including"
1188,THE THIRD BAG,"the hubshi, demonstrated to Black Sheep the eternal equality of the"
1189,THE THIRD BAG,"human race by smacking his head, and his consolation from Aunty Rosa"
1190,THE THIRD BAG,"was that it ""served him right for being vain."" He learned, however, to"
1191,THE THIRD BAG,"keep his opinions to himself, and by propitiating Harry in carrying"
1192,THE THIRD BAG,books and the like to secure a little peace. His existence was not too
1193,THE THIRD BAG,"joyful. From nine till twelve he was at school, and from two to four,"
1194,THE THIRD BAG,except on Saturdays. In the evenings he was sent down into the nursery
1195,THE THIRD BAG,"to prepare his lessons for the next day, and every night came the"
1196,THE THIRD BAG,dreaded cross-questionings at Harry's hand. Of Judy he saw but little.
1197,THE THIRD BAG,She was deeply religious--at six years of age Religion is easy to come
1198,THE THIRD BAG,by--and sorely divided between her natural love for Black Sheep and
1199,THE THIRD BAG,"her love for Aunty Rosa, who could do no wrong."
1200,THE THIRD BAG,
1201,THE THIRD BAG,"The lean woman returned that love with interest, and Judy, when she"
1202,THE THIRD BAG,"dared, took advantage of this for the remission of Black Sheep's"
1203,THE THIRD BAG,penalties. Failures in lessons at school were furnished at home by a
1204,THE THIRD BAG,"week without reading other than schoolbooks, and Harry brought the"
1205,THE THIRD BAG,"news of such a failure with glee. Further, Black Sheep was then bound"
1206,THE THIRD BAG,"to repeat his lessons at bedtime to Harry, who generally succeeded in"
1207,THE THIRD BAG,"making him break down, and consoled him by gloomiest forebodings for"
1208,THE THIRD BAG,"the morrow. Harry was at once spy, practical joker, inquisitor, and"
1209,THE THIRD BAG,Aunty Rosa's deputy executioner. He filled his many posts to
1210,THE THIRD BAG,"admiration. From his actions, now that Uncle Harry was dead, there was"
1211,THE THIRD BAG,no appeal. Black Sheep had not been permitted to keep any self-respect
1212,THE THIRD BAG,"at school; at home he was of course utterly discredited, and grateful"
1213,THE THIRD BAG,for any pity that the servant-girls--they changed frequently at Downe
1214,THE THIRD BAG,"Lodge because they, too, were liars--might show. ""You 're just fit to"
1215,THE THIRD BAG,"row in the same boat with Black Sheep,"" was a sentiment that each new"
1216,THE THIRD BAG,"Jane or Eliza might expect to hear, before a month was over, from"
1217,THE THIRD BAG,Aunty Rosa's lips; and Black Sheep was used to ask new girls whether
1218,THE THIRD BAG,"they had yet been compared to him. Harry was ""Master Harry"" in their"
1219,THE THIRD BAG,"mouths; Judy was officially ""Miss Judy""; but Black Sheep was never"
1220,THE THIRD BAG,anything more than Black Sheep _tout court_.
1221,THE THIRD BAG,
1222,THE THIRD BAG,As time went on and the memory of Papa and Mamma became wholly
1223,THE THIRD BAG,overlaid by the unpleasant task of writing them letters under Aunty
1224,THE THIRD BAG,"Rosa's eye, each Sunday, Black Sheep forgot what manner of life he had"
1225,THE THIRD BAG,"led in the beginning of things. Even Judy's appeals to ""try and"
1226,THE THIRD BAG,"remember about Bombay"" failed to quicken him."
1227,THE THIRD BAG,
1228,THE THIRD BAG,"""I can't remember,"" he said. ""I know I used to give orders and Mamma"
1229,THE THIRD BAG,"kissed me."""
1230,THE THIRD BAG,
1231,THE THIRD BAG,"""Aunty Rosa will kiss you if you are good,"" pleaded Judy."
1232,THE THIRD BAG,
1233,THE THIRD BAG,"""Ugh! I don't want to be kissed by Aunty Rosa. She'd say I was doing"
1234,THE THIRD BAG,"it to get something more to eat."""
1235,THE THIRD BAG,
1236,THE THIRD BAG,"The weeks lengthened into months, and the holidays came; but just"
1237,THE THIRD BAG,before the holidays Black Sheep fell into deadly sin.
1238,THE THIRD BAG,
1239,THE THIRD BAG,"Among the many boys whom Harry had incited to ""punch Black Sheep's"
1240,THE THIRD BAG,"head because he dare n't hit back,"" was one more aggravating than the"
1241,THE THIRD BAG,"rest, who, in an unlucky moment, fell upon Black Sheep when Harry was"
1242,THE THIRD BAG,"not near. The blows stung, and Black Sheep struck back at random with"
1243,THE THIRD BAG,all the power at his command. The boy dropped and whimpered. Black
1244,THE THIRD BAG,"Sheep was astounded at his own act, but, feeling the unresisting body"
1245,THE THIRD BAG,"under him, shook it with both his hands in blind fury and then began"
1246,THE THIRD BAG,to throttle his enemy; meaning honestly to slay him. There was a
1247,THE THIRD BAG,"scuffle, and Black Sheep was torn off the body by Harry and some"
1248,THE THIRD BAG,"colleagues, and cuffed home tingling but exultant. Aunty Rosa was out;"
1249,THE THIRD BAG,pending her arrival Harry set himself to lecture Black Sheep on the
1250,THE THIRD BAG,sin of murder--which he described as the offence of Cain.
1251,THE THIRD BAG,
1252,THE THIRD BAG,"""Why did n't you fight him fair? What did you hit him when he was down"
1253,THE THIRD BAG,"for, you little cur?"""
1254,THE THIRD BAG,
1255,THE THIRD BAG,Black Sheep looked up at Harry's throat and then at a knife on the
1256,THE THIRD BAG,dinner-table.
1257,THE THIRD BAG,
1258,THE THIRD BAG,"""I don't understand,"" he said wearily. ""You always set him on me and"
1259,THE THIRD BAG,told me I was a coward when I blubbed. Will you leave me alone until
1260,THE THIRD BAG,Aunty Rosa comes in? She'll beat me if you tell her I ought to be
1261,THE THIRD BAG,"beaten; so it's all right."""
1262,THE THIRD BAG,
1263,THE THIRD BAG,"""It's all wrong,"" said Harry magisterially. ""You nearly killed him,"
1264,THE THIRD BAG,"and I should n't wonder if he dies."""
1265,THE THIRD BAG,
1266,THE THIRD BAG,"""Will he die?"" said Black Sheep."
1267,THE THIRD BAG,
1268,THE THIRD BAG,"""I daresay,"" said Harry, ""and then you'll be hanged."""
1269,THE THIRD BAG,
1270,THE THIRD BAG,"""All right,"" said Black Sheep, possessing himself of the table-knife."
1271,THE THIRD BAG,"""Then I'll kill you now. You say things and do things and--and I"
1272,THE THIRD BAG,"don't know how things happen, and you never leave me alone--and I"
1273,THE THIRD BAG,"don't care what happens!"""
1274,THE THIRD BAG,
1275,THE THIRD BAG,"He ran at the boy with the knife, and Harry fled upstairs to his room,"
1276,THE THIRD BAG,promising Black Sheep the finest thrashing in the world when Aunty
1277,THE THIRD BAG,"Rosa returned. Black Sheep sat at the bottom of the stairs, the"
1278,THE THIRD BAG,"table-knife in his hand, and wept for that he had not killed Harry."
1279,THE THIRD BAG,"The servant-girl came up from the kitchen, took the knife away, and"
1280,THE THIRD BAG,consoled him. But Black Sheep was beyond consolation. He would be
1281,THE THIRD BAG,badly beaten by Aunty Rosa; then there would be another beating at
1282,THE THIRD BAG,Harry's hands; then Judy would not be allowed to speak to him; then
1283,THE THIRD BAG,the tale would be told at school and then----
1284,THE THIRD BAG,
1285,THE THIRD BAG,"There was no one to help and no one to care, and the best way out of"
1286,THE THIRD BAG,"the business was by death. A knife would hurt, but Aunty Rosa had told"
1287,THE THIRD BAG,"him, a year ago, that if he sucked paint he would die. He went into"
1288,THE THIRD BAG,"the nursery, unearthed the now-disused Noah's Ark, and sucked the"
1289,THE THIRD BAG,"paint off as many animals as remained. It tasted abominable, but he"
1290,THE THIRD BAG,had licked Noah's Dove clean by the time Aunty Rosa and Judy returned.
1291,THE THIRD BAG,"He went upstairs and greeted them with: ""Please, Aunty Rosa, I believe"
1292,THE THIRD BAG,"I've nearly killed a boy at school, and I've tried to kill Harry, and"
1293,THE THIRD BAG,"when you've done all about God and Hell, will you beat me and get it"
1294,THE THIRD BAG,"over?"""
1295,THE THIRD BAG,
1296,THE THIRD BAG,The tale of the assault as told by Harry could only be explained on
1297,THE THIRD BAG,the ground of possession by the Devil. Wherefore Black Sheep was not
1298,THE THIRD BAG,"only most excellently beaten, once by Aunty Rosa and once, when"
1299,THE THIRD BAG,"thoroughly cowed down, by Harry, but he was further prayed for at"
1300,THE THIRD BAG,"family prayers, together with Jane, who had stolen a cold rissole from"
1301,THE THIRD BAG,the pantry and snuffled audibly as her enormity was brought before the
1302,THE THIRD BAG,"Throne of Grace. Black Sheep was sore and stiff, but triumphant. He"
1303,THE THIRD BAG,"would die that very night and be rid of them all. No, he would ask for"
1304,THE THIRD BAG,"no forgiveness from Harry, and at bedtime would stand no questioning"
1305,THE THIRD BAG,"at Harry's hands, even though addressed as ""Young Cain."""
1306,THE THIRD BAG,
1307,THE THIRD BAG,"""I've been beaten,"" said he, ""and I've done other things. I don't care"
1308,THE THIRD BAG,"what I do. If you speak to me to-night, Harry, I'll get out and try to"
1309,THE THIRD BAG,"kill you. Now you can kill me if you like."""
1310,THE THIRD BAG,
1311,THE THIRD BAG,"Harry took his bed into the spare-room, and Black Sheep lay down to"
1312,THE THIRD BAG,die.
1313,THE THIRD BAG,
1314,THE THIRD BAG,It may be that the makers of Noah's Arks know that their animals are
1315,THE THIRD BAG,"likely to find their way into young mouths, and paint them"
1316,THE THIRD BAG,"accordingly. Certain it is that the common, weary next morning broke"
1317,THE THIRD BAG,through the windows and found Black Sheep quite well and a good deal
1318,THE THIRD BAG,"ashamed of himself, but richer by the knowledge that he could, in"
1319,THE THIRD BAG,"extremity, secure himself against Harry for the future."
1320,THE THIRD BAG,
1321,THE THIRD BAG,"When he descended to breakfast on the first day of the holidays, he"
1322,THE THIRD BAG,"was greeted with the news that Harry, Aunty Rosa, and Judy were going"
1323,THE THIRD BAG,"away to Brighton, while Black Sheep was to stay in the house with the"
1324,THE THIRD BAG,servant. His latest outbreak suited Aunty Rosa's plans admirably. It
1325,THE THIRD BAG,"gave her good excuse for leaving the extra boy behind. Papa in Bombay,"
1326,THE THIRD BAG,"who really seemed to know a young sinner's wants to the hour, sent,"
1327,THE THIRD BAG,"that week, a package of new books. And with these, and the society of"
1328,THE THIRD BAG,"Jane on board-wages, Black Sheep was left alone for a month."
1329,THE THIRD BAG,
1330,THE THIRD BAG,"The books lasted for ten days. They were eaten too quickly, in long"
1331,THE THIRD BAG,gulps of four-and-twenty hours at a time. Then came days of doing
1332,THE THIRD BAG,"absolutely nothing, of dreaming dreams and marching imaginary armies"
1333,THE THIRD BAG,"up and down stairs, of counting the number of banisters, and of"
1334,THE THIRD BAG,measuring the length and breadth of every room in handspans--fifty
1335,THE THIRD BAG,"down the side, thirty across, and fifty back again. Jane made many"
1336,THE THIRD BAG,"friends, and, after receiving Black Sheep's assurance that he would"
1337,THE THIRD BAG,"not tell of her absences, went out daily for long hours. Black Sheep"
1338,THE THIRD BAG,would follow the rays of the sinking sun from the kitchen to the
1339,THE THIRD BAG,dining-room and thence upward to his own bedroom until all was gray
1340,THE THIRD BAG,"dark, and he ran down to the kitchen fire and read by its light. He"
1341,THE THIRD BAG,was happy in that he was left alone and could read as much as he
1342,THE THIRD BAG,"pleased. But, later, he grew afraid of the shadows of window-curtains"
1343,THE THIRD BAG,and the flapping of doors and the creaking of shutters. He went out
1344,THE THIRD BAG,"into the garden, and the rustling of the laurel-bushes frightened him."
1345,THE THIRD BAG,
1346,THE THIRD BAG,"He was glad when they all returned--Aunty Rosa, Harry, and Judy--full"
1347,THE THIRD BAG,"of news, and Judy laden with gifts. Who could help loving loyal little"
1348,THE THIRD BAG,"Judy? In return for all her merry babblement, Black Sheep confided to"
1349,THE THIRD BAG,her that the distance from the hall-door to the top of the first
1350,THE THIRD BAG,landing was exactly one hundred and eighty-four handspans. He had
1351,THE THIRD BAG,found it out himself.
1352,THE THIRD BAG,
1353,THE THIRD BAG,"Then the old life recommenced; but with a difference, and a new sin."
1354,THE THIRD BAG,To his other iniquities Black Sheep had now added a phenomenal
1355,THE THIRD BAG,clumsiness--was as unfit to trust in action as he was in word. He
1356,THE THIRD BAG,"himself could not account for spilling everything he touched,"
1357,THE THIRD BAG,"upsetting glasses as he put his hand out, and bumping his head against"
1358,THE THIRD BAG,doors that were manifestly shut. There was a gray haze upon all his
1359,THE THIRD BAG,"world, and it narrowed month by month, until at last it left Black"
1360,THE THIRD BAG,Sheep almost alone with the flapping curtains that were so like
1361,THE THIRD BAG,"ghosts, and the nameless terrors of broad daylight that were only"
1362,THE THIRD BAG,coats on pegs after all.
1363,THE THIRD BAG,
1364,THE THIRD BAG,"Holidays came and holidays went, and Black Sheep was taken to see many"
1365,THE THIRD BAG,people whose faces were all exactly alike; was beaten when occasion
1366,THE THIRD BAG,"demanded, and tortured by Harry on all possible occasions; but"
1367,THE THIRD BAG,"defended by Judy through good and evil report, though she hereby drew"
1368,THE THIRD BAG,upon herself the wrath of Aunty Rosa.
1369,THE THIRD BAG,
1370,THE THIRD BAG,The weeks were interminable and Papa and Mamma were clean forgotten.
1371,THE THIRD BAG,Harry had left school and was a clerk in a Banking-Office. Freed from
1372,THE THIRD BAG,"his presence, Black Sheep resolved that he should no longer be"
1373,THE THIRD BAG,"deprived of his allowance of pleasure-reading. Consequently, when he"
1374,THE THIRD BAG,"failed at school he reported that all was well, and conceived a large"
1375,THE THIRD BAG,"contempt for Aunty Rosa as he saw how easy it was to deceive her. ""She"
1376,THE THIRD BAG,"says I'm a little liar when I don't tell lies, and now I do, she does"
1377,THE THIRD BAG,"n't know,"" thought Black Sheep. Aunty Rosa had credited him in the"
1378,THE THIRD BAG,past with petty cunning and stratagem that had never entered into his
1379,THE THIRD BAG,head. By the light of the sordid knowledge that she had revealed to
1380,THE THIRD BAG,him he paid her back full tale. In a household where the most innocent
1381,THE THIRD BAG,"of his motives, his natural yearning for a little affection, had been"
1382,THE THIRD BAG,interpreted into a desire for more bread and jam or to ingratiate
1383,THE THIRD BAG,"himself with strangers and so put Harry into the background, his work"
1384,THE THIRD BAG,"was easy. Aunty Rosa could penetrate certain kinds of hypocrisy, but"
1385,THE THIRD BAG,not all. He set his child's wits against hers and was no more beaten.
1386,THE THIRD BAG,"It grew monthly more and more of a trouble to read the schoolbooks,"
1387,THE THIRD BAG,and even the pages of the open-print story-books danced and were dim.
1388,THE THIRD BAG,So Black Sheep brooded in the shadows that fell about him and cut him
1389,THE THIRD BAG,"off from the world, inventing horrible punishments for ""dear Harry,"""
1390,THE THIRD BAG,or plotting another line of the tangled web of deception that he
1391,THE THIRD BAG,wrapped round Aunty Rosa.
1392,THE THIRD BAG,
1393,THE THIRD BAG,Then the crash came and the cobwebs were broken. It was impossible to
1394,THE THIRD BAG,foresee everything. Aunty Rosa made personal inquiries as to Black
1395,THE THIRD BAG,Sheep's progress and received information that startled her. Step by
1396,THE THIRD BAG,"step, with a delight as keen as when she convicted an underfed"
1397,THE THIRD BAG,"housemaid of the theft of cold meats, she followed the trail of Black"
1398,THE THIRD BAG,"Sheep's delinquencies. For weeks and weeks, in order to escape"
1399,THE THIRD BAG,"banishment from the book-shelves, he had made a fool of Aunty Rosa, of"
1400,THE THIRD BAG,"Harry, of God, of all the world. Horrible, most horrible, and evidence"
1401,THE THIRD BAG,of an utterly depraved mind.
1402,THE THIRD BAG,
1403,THE THIRD BAG,"Black Sheep counted the cost. ""It will only be one big beating, and"
1404,THE THIRD BAG,"then she'll put a card with 'Liar' on my back, same as she did before."
1405,THE THIRD BAG,"Harry will whack me and pray for me, and she will pray for me at"
1406,THE THIRD BAG,prayers and tell me I'm a Child of the Devil and give me hymns to
1407,THE THIRD BAG,learn. But I've done all my reading and she never knew. She'll say she
1408,THE THIRD BAG,"knew all along. She's an old liar, too,"" said he."
1409,THE THIRD BAG,
1410,THE THIRD BAG,For three days Black Sheep was shut in his own bedroom--to prepare his
1411,THE THIRD BAG,"heart. ""That means two beatings. One at school and one here. That one"
1412,THE THIRD BAG,"will hurt most."" And it fell even as he thought. He was thrashed at"
1413,THE THIRD BAG,"school before the Jews and the hubshi, for the heinous crime of"
1414,THE THIRD BAG,bringing home false reports of progress. He was thrashed at home by
1415,THE THIRD BAG,"Aunty Rosa on the same count, and then the placard was produced. Aunty"
1416,THE THIRD BAG,Rosa stitched it between his shoulders and bade him go for a walk with
1417,THE THIRD BAG,it upon him.
1418,THE THIRD BAG,
1419,THE THIRD BAG,"""If you make me do that,"" said Black Sheep very quietly, ""I shall burn"
1420,THE THIRD BAG,"this house down, and perhaps I'll kill you. I don't know whether I can"
1421,THE THIRD BAG,"kill you--you 're so bony--but I'll try."""
1422,THE THIRD BAG,
1423,THE THIRD BAG,"No punishment followed this blasphemy, though Black Sheep held himself"
1424,THE THIRD BAG,"ready to work his way to Aunty Rosa's withered throat, and grip there"
1425,THE THIRD BAG,"till he was beaten off. Perhaps Aunty Rosa was afraid, for Black"
1426,THE THIRD BAG,"Sheep, having reached the Nadir of Sin, bore himself with a new"
1427,THE THIRD BAG,recklessness.
1428,THE THIRD BAG,
1429,THE THIRD BAG,In the midst of all the trouble there came a visitor from over the
1430,THE THIRD BAG,"seas to Downe Lodge, who knew Papa and Mamma, and was commissioned to"
1431,THE THIRD BAG,see Punch and Judy. Black Sheep was sent to the drawing-room and
1432,THE THIRD BAG,charged into a solid tea-table laden with china.
1433,THE THIRD BAG,
1434,THE THIRD BAG,"""Gently, gently, little man,"" said the visitor turning Black Sheep's"
1435,THE THIRD BAG,"face to the light slowly. ""What's that big bird on the palings?"""
1436,THE THIRD BAG,
1437,THE THIRD BAG,"""What bird?"" asked Black Sheep."
1438,THE THIRD BAG,
1439,THE THIRD BAG,The visitor looked deep down into Black Sheep's eyes for a half a
1440,THE THIRD BAG,"minute, and then said suddenly: ""Good God, the little chap's nearly"
1441,THE THIRD BAG,"blind."""
1442,THE THIRD BAG,
1443,THE THIRD BAG,"It was a most business-like visitor. He gave orders, on his own"
1444,THE THIRD BAG,"responsibility, that Black Sheep was not to go to school or open a"
1445,THE THIRD BAG,"book until Mamma came home. ""She'll be here in three weeks, as you"
1446,THE THIRD BAG,"know of course,"" said he, ""and I'm Inverarity Sahib. I ushered you"
1447,THE THIRD BAG,"into this wicked world, young man, and a nice use you seem to have"
1448,THE THIRD BAG,"made of your time. You must do nothing whatever. Can you do that?"""
1449,THE THIRD BAG,
1450,THE THIRD BAG,"""Yes,"" said Punch in a dazed way. He had known that Mamma was coming."
1451,THE THIRD BAG,"There was a chance, then, of another beating. Thank Heaven, Papa was"
1452,THE THIRD BAG,n't coming too. Aunty Rosa had said of late that he ought to be beaten
1453,THE THIRD BAG,by a man.
1454,THE THIRD BAG,
1455,THE THIRD BAG,For the next three weeks Black Sheep was strictly allowed to do
1456,THE THIRD BAG,nothing. He spent his time in the old nursery looking at the broken
1457,THE THIRD BAG,"toys, for all of which account must be rendered to Mamma. Aunty Rosa"
1458,THE THIRD BAG,hit him over the hands if even a wooden boat were broken. But that sin
1459,THE THIRD BAG,"was of small importance compared to the other revelations, so darkly"
1460,THE THIRD BAG,"hinted at by Aunty Rosa. ""When your mother comes, and hears what I"
1461,THE THIRD BAG,"have to tell her, she may appreciate you properly,"" she said grimly,"
1462,THE THIRD BAG,and mounted guard over Judy lest that small maiden should attempt to
1463,THE THIRD BAG,"comfort her brother, to the peril of her own soul."
1464,THE THIRD BAG,
1465,THE THIRD BAG,And Mamma came--in a four-wheeler and a flutter of tender excitement.
1466,THE THIRD BAG,"Such a Mamma! She was young, frivolously young, and beautiful, with"
1467,THE THIRD BAG,"delicately flushed cheeks, eyes that shone like stars, and a voice"
1468,THE THIRD BAG,that needed no additional appeal of outstretched arms to draw little
1469,THE THIRD BAG,"ones to her heart. Judy ran straight to her, but Black Sheep"
1470,THE THIRD BAG,"hesitated. Could this wonder be ""showing off""? She would not put out"
1471,THE THIRD BAG,her arms when she knew of his crimes. Meantime was it possible that by
1472,THE THIRD BAG,fondling she wanted to get anything out of Black Sheep? Only all his
1473,THE THIRD BAG,love and all his confidence; but that Black Sheep did not know. Aunty
1474,THE THIRD BAG,"Rosa withdrew and left Mamma, kneeling between her children, half"
1475,THE THIRD BAG,"laughing, half crying, in the very hall where Punch and Judy had wept"
1476,THE THIRD BAG,five years before.
1477,THE THIRD BAG,
1478,THE THIRD BAG,"""Well, chicks, do you remember me?"""
1479,THE THIRD BAG,
1480,THE THIRD BAG,"""No,"" said Judy frankly, ""but I said 'God bless Papa and Mamma,' ev'vy"
1481,THE THIRD BAG,"night."""
1482,THE THIRD BAG,
1483,THE THIRD BAG,"""A little,"" said Black Sheep. ""Remember I wrote to you every week,"
1484,THE THIRD BAG,"anyhow. That is n't to show off, but 'cause of what comes afterward."""
1485,THE THIRD BAG,
1486,THE THIRD BAG,"""What comes after! What should come after, my darling boy?"" And she"
1487,THE THIRD BAG,"drew him to her again. He came awkwardly, with many angles. ""Not used"
1488,THE THIRD BAG,"to petting,"" said the quick Mother-soul. ""The girl is."""
1489,THE THIRD BAG,
1490,THE THIRD BAG,"""She's too little to hurt anyone,"" thought Black Sheep, ""and if I said"
1491,THE THIRD BAG,"I'd kill her, she'd be afraid. I wonder what Aunty Rosa will tell."""
1492,THE THIRD BAG,
1493,THE THIRD BAG,"There was a constrained late dinner, at the end of which Mamma picked"
1494,THE THIRD BAG,up Judy and put her to bed with endearments manifold. Faithless little
1495,THE THIRD BAG,Judy had shown her defection from Aunty Rosa already. And that lady
1496,THE THIRD BAG,resented it bitterly. Black Sheep rose to leave the room.
1497,THE THIRD BAG,
1498,THE THIRD BAG,"""Come and say good night,"" said Aunty Rosa, offering a withered cheek."
1499,THE THIRD BAG,
1500,THE THIRD BAG,"""Huh!"" said Black Sheep. ""I never kiss you, and I'm not going to show"
1501,THE THIRD BAG,"off. Tell that woman what I've done, and see what she says."""
1502,THE THIRD BAG,
1503,THE THIRD BAG,Black Sheep climbed into bed feeling that he had lost Heaven after a
1504,THE THIRD BAG,"glimpse through the gates. In half an hour ""that woman"" was bending"
1505,THE THIRD BAG,over him. Black Sheep flung up his right arm. It was n't fair to come
1506,THE THIRD BAG,and hit him in the dark. Even Aunty Rosa never tried that. But no blow
1507,THE THIRD BAG,followed.
1508,THE THIRD BAG,
1509,THE THIRD BAG,"""Are you showing off? I won't tell you anything more than Aunty Rosa"
1510,THE THIRD BAG,"has, and she does n't know everything,"" said Black Sheep as clearly as"
1511,THE THIRD BAG,he could for the arms round his neck.
1512,THE THIRD BAG,
1513,THE THIRD BAG,"""Oh, my son--my little, little son! It was my fault--my fault,"
1514,THE THIRD BAG,"darling--and yet how could we help it? Forgive me, Punch."" The voice"
1515,THE THIRD BAG,"died out in a broken whisper, and two hot tears fell on Black Sheep's"
1516,THE THIRD BAG,forehead.
1517,THE THIRD BAG,
1518,THE THIRD BAG,"""Has she been making you cry, too?"" he asked. ""You should see Jane"
1519,THE THIRD BAG,"cry. But you're nice, and Jane is a Born Liar--Aunty Rosa says so."""
1520,THE THIRD BAG,
1521,THE THIRD BAG,"""Hush, Punch, hush! My boy, don't talk like that. Try to love me a"
1522,THE THIRD BAG,"little bit--a little bit. You don't know how I want it. Punch-baba,"
1523,THE THIRD BAG,come back to me! I am your Mother--your own Mother--and never mind the
1524,THE THIRD BAG,"rest. I know--yes, I know, dear. It does n't matter now. Punch, won't"
1525,THE THIRD BAG,"you care for me a little?"""
1526,THE THIRD BAG,
1527,THE THIRD BAG,It is astonishing how much petting a big boy of ten can endure when he
1528,THE THIRD BAG,is quite sure that there is no one to laugh at him. Black Sheep had
1529,THE THIRD BAG,"never been made much of before, and here was this beautiful woman"
1530,THE THIRD BAG,"treating him--Black Sheep, the Child of the Devil and the Inheritor of"
1531,THE THIRD BAG,Undying Flame--as though he were a small God.
1532,THE THIRD BAG,
1533,THE THIRD BAG,"""I care for you a great deal, Mother dear,"" he whispered at last, ""and"
1534,THE THIRD BAG,I'm glad you've come back; but are you sure Aunty Rosa told you
1535,THE THIRD BAG,"everything?"""
1536,THE THIRD BAG,
1537,THE THIRD BAG,"""Everything. What does it matter? But----"" the voice broke with a sob"
1538,THE THIRD BAG,"that was also laughter--""Punch, my poor, dear, half-blind darling,"
1539,THE THIRD BAG,"don't you think it was a little foolish of you?"""
1540,THE THIRD BAG,
1541,THE THIRD BAG,"""No. It saved a lickin'."""
1542,THE THIRD BAG,
1543,THE THIRD BAG,Mamma shuddered and slipped away in the darkness to write a long
1544,THE THIRD BAG,letter to Papa. Here is an extract:
1545,THE THIRD BAG,
1546,THE THIRD BAG,"""... Judy is a dear, plump little prig who adores the woman, and wears"
1547,THE THIRD BAG,"with as much gravity as her religious opinions--only eight, Jack!--a"
1548,THE THIRD BAG,venerable horsehair atrocity which she calls her Bustle. I have just
1549,THE THIRD BAG,"burned it, and the child is asleep in my bed as I write. She will come"
1550,THE THIRD BAG,"to me at once. Punch I cannot quite understand. He is well nourished,"
1551,THE THIRD BAG,but seems to have been worried into a system of small deceptions which
1552,THE THIRD BAG,the woman magnifies into deadly sins. Don't you recollect our own
1553,THE THIRD BAG,"up-bringing, dear, when the Fear of the Lord was so often the"
1554,THE THIRD BAG,beginning of falsehood? I shall win Punch to me before long. I am
1555,THE THIRD BAG,"taking the children away into the country to get them to know me, and,"
1556,THE THIRD BAG,"on the whole, I am content, or shall be when you come home, dear boy,"
1557,THE THIRD BAG,"and then, thank God, we shall be all under one roof again at last!"""
1558,THE THIRD BAG,
1559,THE THIRD BAG,*       *       *       *       *
1560,THE THIRD BAG,
1561,THE THIRD BAG,"Three months later, Punch, no longer Black Sheep, has discovered that"
1562,THE THIRD BAG,"he is the veritable owner of a real, live, lovely Mamma, who is also a"
1563,THE THIRD BAG,"sister, comforter, and friend, and that he must protect her till the"
1564,THE THIRD BAG,"Father comes home. Deception does not suit the part of a protector,"
1565,THE THIRD BAG,"and, when one can do anything without question, where is the use of"
1566,THE THIRD BAG,deception?
1567,THE THIRD BAG,
1568,THE THIRD BAG,"""Mother would be awfully cross if you walked through that ditch,"" says"
1569,THE THIRD BAG,"Judy, continuing a conversation."
1570,THE THIRD BAG,
1571,THE THIRD BAG,"""Mother's never angry,"" says Punch. ""She'd just say, 'You're a little"
1572,THE THIRD BAG,"pagal'; and that's not nice, but I'll show."""
1573,THE THIRD BAG,
1574,THE THIRD BAG,"Punch walks through the ditch and mires himself to the knees. ""Mother,"
1575,THE THIRD BAG,"dear,"" he shouts, ""I'm just as dirty as I can pos-sib-ly be!"""
1576,THE THIRD BAG,
1577,THE THIRD BAG,"""Then change your clothes as quickly as you pos-sib-ly can!"" rings out"
1578,THE THIRD BAG,"Mother's clear voice from the house. ""And don't be a little pagal!"""
1579,THE THIRD BAG,
1580,THE THIRD BAG,"""There! Told you so,"" says Punch. ""It's all different now, and we are"
1581,THE THIRD BAG,"just as much Mother's as if she had never gone."""
1582,THE THIRD BAG,
1583,THE THIRD BAG,"Not altogether, O Punch, for when young lips have drunk deep of the"
1584,THE THIRD BAG,"bitter waters of Hate, Suspicion, and Despair, all the Love in the"
1585,THE THIRD BAG,world will not wholly take away that knowledge; though it may turn
1586,THE THIRD BAG,"darkened eyes for a while to the light, and teach Faith where no Faith"

1597,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1598,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1599,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"His full name was Percival William Williams, but he picked up the"
1600,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"other name in a nursery-book, and that was the end of the christened"
1601,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"titles. His mother's ayah called him Willie-Baba, but as he never paid"
1602,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the faintest attention to anything that the ayah said, her wisdom did"
1603,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,not help matters.
1604,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1605,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"His father was the Colonel of the 195th, and as soon as Wee Willie"
1606,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Winkie was old enough to understand what Military Discipline meant,"
1607,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Colonel Williams put him under it. There was no other way of managing
1608,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the child. When he was good for a week, he drew good-conduct pay; and"
1609,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"when he was bad, he was deprived of his good-conduct-stripe. Generally"
1610,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"he was bad, for India offers so many chances to little six-year-olds"
1611,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,of going wrong.
1612,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1613,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Children resent familiarity from strangers, and Wee Willie Winkie was"
1614,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"a very particular child. Once he accepted an acquaintance, he was"
1615,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"graciously pleased to thaw. He accepted Brandis, a subaltern of the"
1616,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"195th, on sight. Brandis was having tea at the Colonel's, and Wee"
1617,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Willie Winkie entered, strong in the possession of a good-conduct"
1618,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,badge won for not chasing the hens round the compound. He regarded
1619,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Brandis with gravity for at least ten minutes, and then delivered"
1620,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,himself of his opinion.
1621,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1622,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I like you,"" said he slowly, getting off his chair and coming over to"
1623,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Brandis. ""I like you. I shall call you Coppy, because of your hair. Do"
1624,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"you mind being called Coppy? It is because of ve hair, you know."""
1625,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1626,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Here was one of the most embarrassing of Wee Willie Winkie's
1627,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"peculiarities. He would look at a stranger for some time, and then,"
1628,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"without warning or explanation, would give him a name. And the name"
1629,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,stuck. No regimental penalties could break Wee Willie Winkie of this
1630,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,habit. He lost his good-conduct badge for christening the
1631,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Commissioner's wife ""Pobs""; but nothing that the Colonel could do made"
1632,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the Station forego the nickname, and Mrs. Collen remained Mrs. ""Pobs"""
1633,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"till the end of her stay. So Brandis was christened ""Coppy,"" and rose,"
1634,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"therefore, in the estimation of the regiment."
1635,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1636,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"If Wee Willie Winkie took an interest in anyone, the fortunate man was"
1637,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,envied alike by the mess and the rank and file. And in their envy lay
1638,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"no suspicion of self-interest. ""The Colonel's son"" was idolized on his"
1639,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,own merits entirely. Yet Wee Willie Winkie was not lovely. His face
1640,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"was permanently freckled, as his legs were permanently scratched, and"
1641,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,in spite of his mother's almost tearful remonstrances he had insisted
1642,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,upon having his long yellow locks cut short in the military fashion.
1643,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I want my hair like Sergeant Tummil's,"" said Wee Willie Winkie, and,"
1644,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"his father abetting, the sacrifice was accomplished."
1645,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1646,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on
1647,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Lieutenant Brandis--henceforward to be called ""Coppy"" for the sake of"
1648,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,brevity--Wee Willie Winkie was destined to behold strange things and
1649,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,far beyond his comprehension.
1650,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1651,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Coppy returned his liking with interest. Coppy had let him wear for
1652,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,five rapturous minutes his own big sword--just as tall as Wee Willie
1653,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Winkie. Coppy had promised him a terrier puppy; and Coppy had
1654,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"permitted him to witness the miraculous operation of shaving. Nay,"
1655,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"more--Coppy had said that even he, Wee Willie Winkie, would rise in"
1656,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"time to the ownership of a box of shiny knives, a silver soap-box and"
1657,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"a silver-handled ""sputter-brush,"" as Wee Willie Winkie called it."
1658,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Decidedly, there was no one, except his father, who could give or take"
1659,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"away good-conduct badges at pleasure, half so wise, strong, and"
1660,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,valiant as Coppy with the Afghan and Egyptian medals on his breast.
1661,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Why, then, should Coppy be guilty of the unmanly weakness of"
1662,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"kissing--vehemently kissing--a ""big girl,"" Miss Allardyce to wit? In"
1663,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the course of a morning ride, Wee Willie Winkie had seen Coppy so"
1664,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"doing, and, like the gentleman he was, had promptly wheeled round and"
1665,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"cantered back to his groom, lest the groom should also see."
1666,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1667,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father, but"
1668,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,he felt instinctively that this was a matter on which Coppy ought
1669,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,first to be consulted.
1670,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1671,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Coppy,"" shouted Wee Willie Winkie, reining up outside that"
1672,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"subaltern's bungalow early one morning--""I want to see you, Coppy!"""
1673,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1674,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Come in, young 'un,"" returned Coppy, who was at early breakfast in"
1675,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the midst of his dogs. ""What mischief have you been getting into now?"""
1676,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1677,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Wee Willie Winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days, and"
1678,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,so stood on a pinnacle of virtue.
1679,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1680,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I've been doing nothing bad,"" said he, curling himself into a long"
1681,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,chair with a studious affectation of the Colonel's langour after a hot
1682,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"parade. He buried his freckled nose in a tea-cup and, with eyes"
1683,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"staring roundly over the rim, asked: ""I say, Coppy, is it pwoper to"
1684,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"kiss big girls?"""
1685,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1686,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""By Jove! You're beginning early. Who do you want to kiss?"""

1691,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1692,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Coppy's brow wrinkled. He and Miss Allardyce had with great craft
1693,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,managed to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight. There were
1694,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,urgent and imperative reasons why Major Allardyce should not know how
1695,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"matters stood for at least another month, and this small marplot had"
1696,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,discovered a great deal too much.
1697,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1698,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I saw you,"" said Wee Willie Winkle calmly. ""But ve groom did n't see."
1699,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"I said, 'Hut jao.'"""
1700,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1701,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Oh, you had that much sense, you young Rip,"" groaned poor Coppy, half"
1702,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"amused and half angry. ""And how many people may you have told about"
1703,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"it?"""
1704,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1705,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Only me myself. You did n't tell when I twied to wide ve buffalo ven"
1706,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"my pony was lame; and I fought you would n't like."""
1707,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1708,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Winkie,"" said Coppy enthusiastically, shaking the small hand, ""you're"
1709,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the best of good fellows. Look here, you can't understand all these"
1710,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"things. One of these days--hang it, how can I make you see it!--I'm"
1711,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"going to marry Miss Allardyce, and then she'll be Mrs. Coppy, as you"
1712,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,say. If your young mind is so scandalized at the idea of kissing big
1713,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"girls, go and tell your father."""
1714,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1715,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""What will happen?"" said Wee Willie Winkie, who firmly believed that"
1716,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,his father was omnipotent.
1717,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1718,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I shall get into trouble,"" said Coppy, playing his trump card with"
1719,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,an appealing look at the holder of the ace.
1720,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1721,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Ven I won't,"" said Wee Willie Winkie briefly. ""But my faver says it's"
1722,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"un-man-ly to be always kissing, and I did n't fink you'd do vat,"
1723,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Coppy."""
1724,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1725,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I'm not always kissing, old chap. It's only now and then, and when"
1726,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,you're bigger you'll do it too. Your father meant it's not good for
1727,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"little boys."""
1728,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1729,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Ah!"" said Wee Willie Winkle, now fully enlightened. ""It's like ve"
1730,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"sputter-brush?"""
1731,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1732,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Exactly,"" said Coppy gravely."
1733,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1734,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""But I don't fink I'll ever want to kiss big girls, nor no one, 'cept"
1735,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"my muvver. And I must vat, you know."""
1736,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1737,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"There was a long pause, broken by Wee Willie Winkie."
1738,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1739,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Are you fond of vis big girl, Coppy?"""
1740,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1741,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Awfully!"" said Coppy."
1742,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1743,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Fonder van you are of Bell or ve Butcha--or me?"""
1744,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1745,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""It's in a different way,"" said Coppy. ""You see, one of these days"
1746,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Miss Allardyce will belong to me, but you'll grow up and command the"
1747,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Regiment and--all sorts of things. It's quite different, you see."""
1748,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1749,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Very well,"" said Wee Willie Winkie, rising. ""If you're fond of ve big"
1750,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"girl, I won't tell anyone. I must go now."""
1751,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1752,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door, adding: ""You're"
1753,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the best of little fellows, Winkie. I tell you what. In thirty days"
1754,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"from now you can tell if you like--tell anyone you like."""
1755,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1756,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Thus the secret of the Brandis-Allardyce engagement was dependent on a
1757,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"little child's word. Coppy, who knew Wee Willie Winkie's idea of"
1758,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"truth, was at ease, for he felt that he would not break promises. Wee"
1759,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Willie Winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in Miss
1760,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Allardyce, and, slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady,"
1761,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,was used to regard her gravely with unwinking eye. He was trying to
1762,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,discover why Coppy should have kissed her. She was not half so nice as
1763,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"his own mother. On the other hand she was Coppy's property, and would"
1764,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,in time belong to him. Therefore it behooved him to treat her with as
1765,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,much respect as Coppy's big sword or shiny pistol.
1766,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1767,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The idea that he shared a great secret in common with Coppy kept Wee
1768,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Willie Winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks. Then the Old Adam
1769,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"broke out, and he made what he called a ""camp-fire"" at the bottom of"
1770,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,the garden. How could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would
1771,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,have lighted the Colonel's little hay-rick and consumed a week's store
1772,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,for the horses? Sudden and swift was the punishment--deprivation of
1773,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the good-conduct badge and, most sorrowful of all, two days'"
1774,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,confinement to barracks--the house and veranda--coupled with the
1775,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,withdrawal of the light of his father's countenance.
1776,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1777,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"He took the sentence like the man he strove to be, drew himself up"
1778,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"with a quivering under-lip, saluted, and, once clear of the room, ran"
1779,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"to weep bitterly in his nursery--called by him ""my quarters."" Coppy"
1780,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,came in the afternoon and attempted to console the culprit.
1781,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1782,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I'm under awwest,"" said Wee Willie Winkie mournfully, ""and I did n't"
1783,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"ought to speak to you."""
1784,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1785,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the
1786,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,house--that was not forbidden--and beheld Miss Allardyce going for a
1787,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,ride.
1788,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1789,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Where are you going?"" cried Wee Willie Winkie."
1790,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1791,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Across the river,"" she answered, and trotted forward."
1792,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1793,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by
1794,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"a river--dry in the winter. From his earliest years, Wee Willie Winkie"
1795,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"had been forbidden to go across the river, and had noted that even"
1796,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Coppy--the almost almighty Coppy--had never set foot beyond it. Wee
1797,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Willie Winkie had once been read to, out of a big blue book, the"
1798,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,history of the Princess and the Goblins--a most wonderful tale of a
1799,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,land where the Goblins were always warring with the children of men
1800,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,until they were defeated by one Curdie. Ever since that date it seemed
1801,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,to him that the bare black and purple hills across the river were
1802,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"inhabited by Goblins, and, in truth, everyone had said that there"
1803,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,lived the Bad Men. Even in his own house the lower halves of the
1804,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,windows were covered with green paper on account of the Bad Men who
1805,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"might, if allowed clear view, fire into peaceful drawing-rooms and"
1806,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"comfortable bedrooms. Certainly, beyond the river, which was the end"
1807,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"of all the Earth, lived the Bad Men. And here was Major Allardyce's"
1808,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"big girl, Coppy's property, preparing to venture into their borders!"
1809,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,What would Coppy say if anything happened to her? If the Goblins ran
1810,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,off with her as they did with Curdie's Princess? She must at all
1811,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,hazards be turned back.
1812,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1813,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The house was still. Wee Willie Winkie reflected for a moment on the
1814,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,very terrible wrath of his father; and then--broke his arrest! It was
1815,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"a crime unspeakable. The low sun threw his shadow, very large and very"
1816,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"black, on the trim garden-paths, as he went down to the stables and"
1817,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,ordered his pony. It seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that all
1818,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,the big world had been bidden to stand still and look at Wee Willie
1819,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Winkie guilty of mutiny. The drowsy groom handed him his mount, and"
1820,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"since the one great sin made all others insignificant, Wee Willie"
1821,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Winkie said that he was going to ride over to Coppy Sahib, and went"
1822,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"out at a foot-pace, stepping on the soft mould of the flower-borders."
1823,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1824,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The devastating track of the pony's feet was the last misdeed that cut
1825,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"him off from all sympathy of Humanity. He turned into the road, leaned"
1826,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"forward, and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the ground in"
1827,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,the direction of the river.
1828,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1829,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,But the liveliest of twelve-two ponies can do little against the long
1830,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"canter of a Waler. Miss Allardyce was far ahead, had passed through"
1831,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the crops, beyond the Police-post, when all the guards were asleep,"
1832,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,and her mount was scattering the pebbles of the river bed as Wee
1833,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Willie Winkie left the cantonment and British India behind him. Bowed,"
1834,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"forward and still flogging, Wee Willie Winkie shot into Afghan"
1835,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"territory, and could just see Miss Allardyce a black speck, flickering"
1836,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,across the stony plain. The reason of her wandering was simple enough.
1837,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Coppy, in a tone of too-hastily-assumed authority, had told her over"
1838,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,night that she must not ride out by the river. And she had gone to
1839,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,prove her own spirit and teach Coppy a lesson.
1840,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1841,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills Wee Willie Winkie saw the
1842,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Waler blunder and come down heavily. Miss Allardyce struggled clear,"
1843,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"but her ankle had been severely twisted, and she could not stand."
1844,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Having thus demonstrated her spirit, she wept copiously, and was"
1845,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"surprised by the apparition of a white, wide-eyed child in khaki, on a"
1846,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,nearly spent pony.
1847,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1848,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Are you badly, badly hurted?"" shouted Wee Willie Winkie, as soon as"
1849,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"he was within range. ""You did n't ought to be here."""
1850,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1851,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I don't know,"" said Miss Allardyce ruefully ignoring the reproof."
1852,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Good gracious, child, what are you doing here?"""
1853,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1854,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""You said you was going acwoss ve wiver,"" panted Wee Willie Winkie,"
1855,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"throwing himself off his pony. ""And nobody--not even Coppy--must go"
1856,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"acwoss ve wiver, and I came after you ever so hard, but you would n't"
1857,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"stop, and now you 've hurted yourself, and Coppy will be angry wiv me,"
1858,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"and--I've bwoken my awwest! I've bwoken my awwest!"""
1859,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1860,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The future Colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed. In spite of the
1861,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,pain in her ankle the girl was moved.
1862,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1863,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Have you ridden all the way from cantonments, little man? What for?"""
1864,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1865,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""You belonged to Coppy. Coppy told me so!"" wailed Wee Willie Winkie"
1866,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"disconsolately. ""I saw him kissing you, and he said he was fonder of"
1867,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,you van Bell or ve Butcha or me. And so I came. You must get up and
1868,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"come back. You did n't ought to be here. Vis is a bad place, and I 've"
1869,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"bwoken my awwest."""
1870,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1871,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I can't move, Winkie,"" said Miss Allardyce, with a groan. ""I've hurt"
1872,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"my foot. What shall I do?"""
1873,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1874,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,She showed a readiness to weep afresh which steadied Wee Willie
1875,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Winkie, who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth"
1876,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"of unmanliness. Still, when one is as great a sinner as Wee Willie"
1877,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Winkie, even a man may be permitted to break down."
1878,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1879,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Winkie,"" said Miss Allardyce, ""when you've rested a little, ride back"
1880,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,and tell them to send out something to carry me back in. It hurts
1881,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"fearfully."""
1882,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1883,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The child sat still for a little time and Miss Allardyce closed her
1884,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,eyes; the pain was nearly making her faint. She was roused by Wee
1885,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Willie Winkie tying up the reins on his pony's neck and setting it
1886,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,free with a vicious cut of his whip that made it whicker. The little
1887,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,animal headed toward the cantonments.
1888,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1889,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Oh, Winkie! What are you doing?"""
1890,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1891,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Hush!"" said Wee Willie Winkie. ""Vere's a man coming--one of ve Bad"
1892,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Men. I must stay wiv you. My faver says a man must always look after a
1893,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"girl. Jack will go home, and ven vey 'll come and look for us. Vat 's"
1894,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"why I let him go."""
1895,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1896,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Not one man, but two or three, had appeared from behind the rocks of"
1897,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the hills, and the heart of Wee Willie Winkie sank within him, for"
1898,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,just in this manner were the Goblins wont to steal out and vex
1899,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Curdie's soul. Thus had they played in Curdie's garden, he had seen"
1900,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the picture, and thus had they frightened the Princess's nurse. He"
1901,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"heard them talking to each other, and recognized with joy the bastard"
1902,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Pushto that he had picked up from one of his father's grooms lately
1903,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,dismissed. People who spoke that tongue could not be the Bad Men. They
1904,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"were only natives, after all."
1905,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1906,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,They came up to the boulders on which Miss Allardyce's horse had
1907,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,blundered.
1908,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1909,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Then rose from the rock Wee Willie Winkie, child of the Dominant Race,"
1910,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"aged six and three-quarters, and said briefly and emphatically ""Jao!"""
1911,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,The pony had crossed the river-bed.
1912,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1913,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"The men laughed, and laughter from natives was the one thing Wee"
1914,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Willie Winkie could not tolerate. He asked them what they wanted and
1915,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,why they did not depart. Other men with most evil faces and
1916,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"crooked-stocked guns crept out of the shadows of the hills, till,"
1917,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"soon, Wee Willie Winkie was face to face with an audience some twenty"
1918,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,strong. Miss Allardyce screamed.
1919,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1920,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Who are you?"" said one of the men."
1921,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1922,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""I am the Colonel Sahib's son, and my order is that you go at once."

1925,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"and that the Colonel's son is here with her."""
1926,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1927,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Put our feet into the trap?"" was the laughing reply. ""Hear this boy's"

1929,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,

1936,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1937,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,These were the Bad Men--worse than Goblins--and it needed all Wee

1939,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"he felt that to cry before a native, excepting only his mother's ayah,"
1940,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"would be an infamy greater than any mutiny. Moreover, he, as future"
1941,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Colonel of the 195th, had that grim regiment at his back."
1942,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1943,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""Are you going to carry us away?"" said Wee Willie Winkie, very"

1983,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"afternoon. Devlin, the Colour Sergeant of E Company, glanced at the"
1984,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"empty saddle and tumbled through the barrack-rooms, kicking up each"
1985,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Room Corporal as he passed. ""Up, ye beggars! There's something"

1988,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""He could n't fall off! S'elp me, 'e could n't fall off,"" blubbered a"

1995,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
1996,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"So E Company, in its shirt-sleeves mainly, doubled for the dear life,"
1997,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"and in the rear toiled the perspiring Sergeant, adjuring it to double"
1998,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,yet faster. The cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th hunting
1999,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"for Wee Willie Winkie, and the Colonel finally overtook E Company, far"
2000,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"too exhausted to swear, struggling in the pebbles of the river-bed."

2002,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,Up the hill under which Wee Willie Winkie's Bad Men were discussing
2003,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"the wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl, a lookout fired two"

2012,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
2013,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""The wegiment is coming,"" said Wee Willie Winkie confidently to Miss"

2023,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
2024,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,But there was balm for his dignity. His father assured him that not

2026,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,good-conduct badge would be restored as soon as his mother could sew

2028,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,that made him proud of his son.
2029,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,
2030,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"""She belonged to you, Coppy,"" said Wee Willie Winkie, indicating Miss"
2031,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"Allardyce with a grimy forefinger. ""I knew she did n't ought to go"
2032,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,"acwoss ve wiver, and I knew ve wegiment would come to me if I sent"

2034,WEE WILLIE WINKIE,

2699,THE GALLEY SLAVE,"The leg-bar chafed the ankle, and we gasped for cooler air,"
2700,THE GALLEY SLAVE,But no galley on the water with our galley could compare!
2701,THE GALLEY SLAVE,
2702,THE GALLEY SLAVE,Our bulkheads bulged with cotton and our masts were stepped in gold--
2703,THE GALLEY SLAVE,We ran a mighty merchandise of Negroes in the hold;
2704,THE GALLEY SLAVE,"The white foam spun behind us, and the black shark swam below,"
2705,THE GALLEY SLAVE,As we gripped the kicking sweep-head and we made that galley go.
2706,THE GALLEY SLAVE,

2753,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"It was her first voyage, and though she was but a cargo-steamer of"
2754,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"twenty-five hundred tons, she was the very best of her kind, the"
2755,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in framework
2756,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,and machinery; and her designers and owner thought as much of her as
2757,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,though she had been the _Lucania_. Anyone can make a floating hotel
2758,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"that will pay expenses, if he puts enough money into the saloon, and"
2759,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"charges for private baths, suites of rooms, and such like; but in"
2760,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,these days of competition and low freights every square inch of a
2761,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"cargo-boat must be built for cheapness, great hold-capacity, and a"
2762,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"certain steady speed. This boat was, perhaps, two hundred and forty"
2763,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"feet long and thirty-two feet wide, with arrangements that enabled her"
2764,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted
2765,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,to; but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store
2766,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,away in her holds. Her owners--they were a very well-known Scotch
2767,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"firm--came round with her from the north, where she had been launched"
2768,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"and christened and fitted, to Liverpool, where she was to take cargo"
2769,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"for New York; and the owner's daughter, Miss Frazier, went to and fro"
2770,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"on the clean decks, admiring the new paint and the brass work, and the"
2771,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"patent winches, and particularly the strong, straight bow, over which"
2772,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,she had cracked a bottle of champagne when she named the steamer the
2773,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"_Dimbula_. It was a beautiful September afternoon, and the boat in all"
2774,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,her newness--she was painted lead-colour with a red funnel--looked
2775,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"very fine indeed. Her house-flag was flying, and her whistle from time"
2776,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"to time acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats, who saw that she"
2777,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,was new to the High and Narrow Seas and wished to make her welcome.
2778,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2779,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""And now,"" said Miss Frazier, delightedly, to the captain, ""she's a"

2784,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2785,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""Oh, she's no so bad,"" the skipper replied cautiously. ""But I'm sayin'"

2790,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""I thought father said she was exceptionally well found."""
2791,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2792,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""So she is,"" said the skipper, with a laugh. ""But it's this way wi'"
2793,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"ships, Miss Frazier. She's all here, but the parrts of her have not"

2796,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""The engines are working beautifully. I can hear them."""

2806,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"For a ship, ye'll obsairve, Miss Frazier, is in no sense a reegid body"
2807,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,closed at both ends. She's a highly complex structure o' various an'

2814,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""Well enough--true by plumb an' rule, o' course; but there's no"

2816,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,and maybe ye'll comprehend later; even after a pretty girl's
2817,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,christened a ship it does not follow that there's such a thing as a

2819,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2820,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""I was sayin' the very same, Mr. Buchanan,"" the skipper interrupted."
2821,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2822,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""That's more metaphysical than I can follow,"" said Miss Frazier,"
2823,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,laughing.
2824,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2825,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""Why so? Ye're good Scotch, an'--I knew your mother's father, he was"

2827,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"just as ye have in the _Dimbula_,"" the engineer said."

2829,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""Eh, well, we must go down to the deep watters, an' earn Miss Frazier"
2830,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"her deevidends. Will you not come to my cabin for tea?"" said the"
2831,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"skipper. ""We'll be in dock the night, and when you're goin' back to"
2832,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,Glasgie ye can think of us loadin' her down an' drivin' her forth--all
2833,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"for your sake."""
2834,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2835,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,In the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons' dead weight
2836,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"into the _Dimbula_, and took her out from Liverpool. As soon as she"
2837,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"met the lift of the open water, she naturally began to talk. If you"
2838,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"lay your ear to the side of the cabin next time you are in a steamer,"
2839,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"you will hear hundreds of little voices in every direction, thrilling"
2840,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"and buzzing, and whispering and popping, and gurgling and sobbing and"
2841,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,squeaking exactly like a telephone in a thunder-storm. Wooden ships
2842,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"shriek and growl and grunt, but iron vessels throb and quiver through"
2843,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets. The _Dimbula_ was
2844,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"very strongly built, and every piece of her had a letter or number, or"
2845,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"both, to describe it; and every piece had been hammered, or forged,"
2846,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"or rolled, or punched by man, and had lived in the roar and rattle of"
2847,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"the shipyard for months. Therefore, every piece had its own separate"
2848,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,voice in exact proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it.
2849,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"Cast-iron as a rule, says very little; but mild steel plates and"
2850,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"wrought-iron, and ribs and beams that have been much bent and welded"
2851,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"and riveted, talk continuously. Their conversation, of course, is not"
2852,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"half as wise as our human talk, because they are all, though they do"
2853,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"not know it, bound down one to the other in a black darkness, where"
2854,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"they cannot tell what is happening near them, nor what will overtake"

2856,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2857,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,As soon as she had cleared the Irish coast a sullen gray-headed old
2858,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight bows, and sat"
2859,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,down on her steam-capstan used for hauling up the anchor. Now the
2860,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and

2862,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2863,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""Don't you do that again,"" the capstan sputtered through the teeth of"

2865,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2866,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"The wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle; but ""Plenty"

2868,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"over the capstan, who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron"
2869,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,deck-beams below.
2870,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,

2894,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"called ribs in a wooden ship) in place, and also help to hold the ends"
2895,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"of the deck-beams, which go from side to side of the ship. Stringers"
2896,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"always consider themselves most important, because they are so long."
2897,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2898,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"""You will take steps--will you?"" This was a long echoing rumble. It"

2906,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,

2909,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,and she shook like a rat in a terrier's mouth.
2910,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,
2911,THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF,"An unusually severe pitch, for the sea was rising, had lifted the big"

3515,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],The six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and
3516,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come"
3517,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],later. The heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they
3518,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],turned east to the Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in
3519,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the utter drought and glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's"
3520,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"neck, and toiled up the long, long grades, past Ash Fork, toward"
3521,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"Flagstaff, where the forests and quarries are, under the dry, remote"
3522,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],skies. The needle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and
3523,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"fro, the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after"
3524,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the whirling wheels. The crew of the combination sat on their bunks,"
3525,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"panting in their shirt-sleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them"
3526,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"shouting old, old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows,"
3527,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"above the roar of the car. He told them about his son, and how the sea"
3528,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"had given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him;"
3529,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"asked after ""her, back there,"" and whether she could stand it if the"
3530,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"engineer ""let her out a piece,"" and Cheyne thought she could."
3531,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"Accordingly the great fire-horse was ""let out"" from Flagstaff to"
3532,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"Winslow, till a division superintendent protested."
3533,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],
3534,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"But Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir stateroom, where the French maid,"
3535,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"sallow-white with fear, clung to the silver door-handle, only moaned a"

3537,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the dry sands and moon-struck rocks of Arizona behind them, and"
3538,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],grilled on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the

3544,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"to Glorietta and beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the"
3545,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"State line, whence they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of"
3546,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the Arkansaw, and tore down the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne"
3547,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],took comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead.
3548,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],
3549,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],There was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter
3550,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],sat together on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the
3551,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"plate-glass observation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and"
3552,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"ripple of the ties crowded back behind them, and, it is believed,"
3553,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],making notes of the scenery. Cheyne moved nervously between his own

3558,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all
3559,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the"
3560,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],emptiness of abject desolation. Now they heard the swish of a
3561,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"water-tank, and the guttural voice of a Chinaman, the clink-clink of"
3562,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels, and the oath of a tramp"
3563,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],chased off the rear-platform; now the solid crash of coal shot into
3564,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],the tender; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a
3565,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"waiting train. Now they looked out into great abysses, a trestle"
3566,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"purring beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred out half the"

3568,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"mountains on the horizon's edge, and now broke into hills lower and"
3569,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"lower, till at last came the true plains."
3570,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],
3571,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper

3574,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"The joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy,"
3575,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while. Her one word ""hurry"" was"

3577,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"Marceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed the Continent"
3578,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"behind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a man"

3592,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"giant bee. Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat,"
3593,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"the remorseless August heat, was making her giddy; the clock-hands"
3594,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"would not move, and when, oh, when would they be in Chicago?"
3595,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],
3596,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"It is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne"
3597,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],passed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an

3599,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],equal terms for evermore. He paid his obligations to engineers and
3600,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],"firemen as he believed they deserved, and only his bank knows what he"
3601,A TRIP ACROSS A CONTINENT[1],gave the crews who had sympathized with him. It is on record that the

3653,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Thousands of years ago, when men were greater than they are to-day,"
3654,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the Children of the Zodiac lived in the world. There were six Children

3656,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"and they were afraid of the Six Houses which belonged to the Scorpion,"
3657,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Balance, the Crab, the Fishes, the Goat, and the Waterman. Even"
3658,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],when they first stepped down upon the earth and knew that they were
3659,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"immortal Gods, they carried this fear with them; and the fear grew as"
3660,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],they became better acquainted with mankind and heard stories of the
3661,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Six Houses. Men treated the Children as Gods and came to them with
3662,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"prayers and long stories of wrong, while the Children of the Zodiac"

3786,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"with his head bent down, and the sweat streaming from his flanks. The"
3787,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],countryman was urging him forward with a goad.
3788,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3789,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Gore that insolent to death,"" cried Leo, ""and for the sake of our"
3790,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"family honour come out of the mire."""
3791,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3792,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I cannot,"" said the Bull, ""the Scorpion has told me that some day, of"
3793,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"which I cannot be sure, he will sting me where my neck is set on my"
3794,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"shoulders, and that I shall die bellowing."""
3795,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3796,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What has that to do with this disgraceful exhibition?"" said Leo,"
3797,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],standing on the dyke that bounded the wet field.
3798,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3799,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Everything. This man could not plough without my help. He thinks that"
3800,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"I am a stray bullock."""
3801,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3802,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""But he is a mud-crusted cottar with matted hair,"" insisted Leo. ""We"
3803,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"are not meant for his use."""
3804,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3805,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You may not be; I am. I cannot tell when the Scorpion may choose to"
3806,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"sting me to death--perhaps before I have turned this furrow."" The Bull"
3807,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"flung his bulk into the yoke, and the plough tore through the wet"
3808,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"ground behind him, and the countryman goaded him till his flanks were"
3809,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],red.
3810,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3811,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Do you like this?"" Leo called down the dripping furrows."
3812,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3813,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No,"" said the Bull over his shoulder as he lifted his hind legs from"
3814,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the clinging mud and cleared his nostrils.
3815,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3816,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo left him scornfully and passed to another country, where he found"
3817,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],his brother the Ram in the centre of a crowd of country people who
3818,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],were hanging wreaths round his neck and feeding him on freshly plucked
3819,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],green corn.
3820,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3821,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""This is terrible,"" said Leo. ""Break up that crowd and come away, my"
3822,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"brother. Their hands are spoiling your fleece."""
3823,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3824,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I cannot,"" said the Ram. ""The Archer told me that on some day of"
3825,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"which I had no knowledge, he would send a dart through me, and that I"
3826,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"should die in very great pain."""
3827,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3828,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What has that to do with this?"" said Leo, but he did not speak as"
3829,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],confidently as before.
3830,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3831,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Everything in the world,"" said the Ram. ""These people never saw a"
3832,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"perfect sheep before. They think that I am a stray, and they will"
3833,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"carry me from place to place as a model to all their flocks."""
3834,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3835,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""But they are greasy shepherds, we are not intended to amuse them,"""
3836,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],said Leo.
3837,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3838,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You may not be; I am,"" said the Ram. ""I cannot tell when the Archer"
3839,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],may choose to send his arrow at me--perhaps before the people a mile
3840,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"down the road have seen me."" The Ram lowered his head that a yokel"
3841,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"newly arrived might throw a wreath of wild garlic-leaves over it, and"
3842,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],waited patiently while the farmers tugged his fleece.
3843,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3844,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Do you like this?"" cried Leo over the shoulders of the crowd."
3845,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3846,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No,"" said the Ram, as the dust of the trampling feet made him sneeze,"
3847,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],and he snuffed at the fodder piled before him.
3848,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3849,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo turned back, intending to retrace his steps to the Houses, but as"
3850,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"he was passing down a street he saw two small children, very dusty,"
3851,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"rolling outside a cottage door, and playing with a cat. They were the"
3852,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Twins.
3853,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3854,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What are you doing here?"" said Leo, indignant."
3855,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3856,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Playing,"" said the Twins calmly."
3857,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3858,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Cannot you play on the banks of the Milky Way?"" said Leo."
3859,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3860,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""We did,"" said they, ""till the Fishes swam down and told us that some"
3861,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],day they would come for us and not hurt us at all and carry us away.
3862,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"So now we are playing at being babies down here. The people like it."""
3863,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3864,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Do you like it?"" said Leo."
3865,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3866,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No,"" said the Twins, ""but there are no cats in the Milky Way,"" and"
3867,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],they pulled the cat's tail thoughtfully. A woman came out of the
3868,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"doorway and stood behind them, and Leo saw in her face a look that he"
3869,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],had sometimes seen in the Girl's.
3870,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3871,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""She thinks that we are foundlings,"" said the Twins, and they trotted"
3872,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],indoors to the evening meal.
3873,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3874,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Then Leo hurried as swiftly as possible to all the Houses one after
3875,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],another; for he could not understand the new trouble that had come to
3876,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"his brethren. He spoke to the Archer, and the Archer assured him that"
3877,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],so far as that House was concerned Leo had nothing to fear. The
3878,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Waterman, the Fishes, and the Goat, gave the same answer. They knew"
3879,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"nothing of Leo, and cared less. They were the Houses, and they were"
3880,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],busied in killing men.
3881,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3882,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],At last he came to that very dark House where Cancer the Crab lies so
3883,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],still that you might think he was asleep if you did not see the
3884,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],ceaseless play and winnowing motion of the feathery branches round his
3885,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],mouth. That movement never ceases. It is like the eating of a
3886,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],smothered fire into rotten timber in that it is noiseless and without
3887,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],haste.
3888,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3889,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo stood in front of the Crab, and the half darkness allowed him a"
3890,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"glimpse of that vast blue-black back, and the motionless eyes. Now and"
3891,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"again he thought that he heard some one sobbing, but the noise was"
3892,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],very faint.
3893,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3894,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Why do you trouble the children of men?"" said Leo. There was no"
3895,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"answer, and against his will Leo cried, ""Why do you trouble us? What"
3896,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"have we done that you should trouble us?"""
3897,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3898,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"This time Cancer replied, ""What do I know or care? You were born into"
3899,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"my House, and at the appointed time I shall come for you."""
3900,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3901,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""When is the appointed time?"" said Leo, stepping back from the"
3902,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],restless movement of the mouth.
3903,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3904,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""When the full moon fails to call the full tide,"" said the Crab, ""I"
3905,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],shall come for the one. When the other has taken the earth by the
3906,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"shoulders, I shall take that other by the throat."""
3907,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3908,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo lifted his hand to the apple of his throat, moistened his lips,"
3909,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"and recovering himself, said:"
3910,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3911,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Must I be afraid for two, then?"""
3912,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3913,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""For two,"" said the Crab, ""and as many more as may come after."""
3914,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3915,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""My brother, the Bull, had a better fate,"" said Leo, sullenly. ""He is"
3916,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"alone."""
3917,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3918,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"A hand covered his mouth before he could finish the sentence, and he"
3919,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"found the Girl in his arms. Woman-like, she had not stayed where Leo"
3920,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"had left her, but had hastened off at once to know the worst, and"
3921,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"passing all the other Houses, had come straight to Cancer."
3922,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3923,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""That is foolish,"" said the Girl whispering. ""I have been waiting in"
3924,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the dark for long and long before you came. _Then_ I was afraid. But
3925,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"now----"" She put her head down on his shoulder and sighed a sigh of"
3926,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],contentment.
3927,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3928,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I am afraid now,"" said Leo."
3929,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3930,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""That is on my account,"" said the Girl. ""I know it is, because I am"
3931,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"afraid for your sake. Let us go, husband."""
3932,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3933,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"They went out of the darkness together and came back to the Earth,"
3934,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo very silent, and the Girl striving to cheer him. ""My brother's"
3935,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"fate is the better one,"" Leo would repeat from time to time, and at"
3936,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"last he said: ""Let us each go our own way and live alone till we die."
3937,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"We were born into the House of Cancer, and he will come for us."""
3938,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3939,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I know; I know. But where shall I go? And where will you sleep in the"
3940,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"evening? But let us try. I will stay here. Do you go on."""
3941,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3942,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo took six steps forward very slowly, and three long steps backward"
3943,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"very quickly, and the third step set him again at the Girl's side."
3944,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"This time it was she who was begging him to go away and leave her, and"
3945,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],he was forced to comfort her all through the night. That night decided
3946,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"them both never to leave each other for an instant, and when they had"
3947,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],come to this decision they looked back at the darkness of the House of
3948,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Cancer high above their heads, and with their arms round each other's"
3949,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"necks laughed, ""Ha! ha! ha!"" exactly as the children of men laughed."
3950,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],And that was the first time in their lives that they had ever laughed.
3951,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3952,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Next morning they returned to their proper home and saw the flowers
3953,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],and the sacrifices that had been laid before their doors by the
3954,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],villagers of the hills. Leo stamped down the fire with his heel and
3955,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Girl flung the flower-wreaths out of sight, shuddering as she did"
3956,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"so. When the villagers re-returned, as of custom, to see what had"
3957,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"become of their offerings, they found neither roses nor burned flesh"
3958,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"on the altars, but only a man and a woman, with frightened white faces"
3959,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],sitting hand in hand on the altar-steps.
3960,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3961,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Are you not Virgo?"" said a woman to the Girl. ""I sent you flowers"
3962,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"yesterday."""
3963,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3964,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Little sister,"" said the Girl, flushing to her forehead, ""do not send"
3965,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"any more flowers, for I am only a woman like yourself."" The man and"
3966,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the woman went away doubtfully.
3967,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3968,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Now, what shall we do?"" said Leo."
3969,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3970,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""We must try to be cheerful, I think,"" said the Girl. ""We know the"
3971,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"very worst that can happen to us, but we do not know the best that"
3972,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"love can bring us. We have a great deal to be glad of."""
3973,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3974,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""The certainty of death?"" said Leo."
3975,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3976,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""All the children of men have that certainty also; yet they laughed"
3977,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"long before we ever knew how to laugh. We must learn to laugh, Leo. We"
3978,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"have laughed once, already."""
3979,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3980,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"People who consider themselves Gods, as the Children of the Zodiac"
3981,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"did, find it hard to laugh, because the Immortals know nothing worth"
3982,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"laughter or tears. Leo rose up with a very heavy heart, and he and the"
3983,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],girl together went to and fro among men; their new fear of death
3984,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],behind them. First they laughed at a naked baby attempting to thrust
3985,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],its fat toes into its foolish pink mouth; next they laughed at a
3986,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],kitten chasing her own tail; and then they laughed at a boy trying to
3987,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"steal a kiss from a girl, and getting his ears boxed. Lastly, they"
3988,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],laughed because the wind blew in their faces as they ran down a
3989,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"hill-side together, and broke panting and breathless into a knot of"
3990,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"villagers at the bottom. The villagers laughed, too, at their flying"
3991,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],clothes and wind-reddened faces; and in the evening gave them food and
3992,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"invited them to a dance on the grass, where everybody laughed through"
3993,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the mere joy of being able to dance.
3994,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3995,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"That night Leo jumped up from the Girl's side crying: ""Every one of"
3996,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"those people we met just now will die----"""
3997,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
3998,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""So shall we,"" said the Girl sleepily. ""Lie down again, dear."" Leo"
3999,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],could not see that her face was wet with tears.
4000,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4001,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"But Leo was up and far across the fields, driven forward by the fear"
4002,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"of death for himself and for the Girl, who was dearer to him than"
4003,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],himself. Presently he came across the Bull drowsing in the moonlight
4004,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"after a hard day's work, and looking through half-shut eyes at the"
4005,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],beautiful straight furrows that he had made.
4006,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4007,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Ho!"" said the Bull. ""So you have been told these things too. Which of"
4008,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Houses holds your death?"""
4009,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4010,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo pointed upward to the dark House of the Crab and groaned. ""And he"
4011,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"will come for the Girl too,"" he said."
4012,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4013,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Well,"" said the Bull, ""what will you do?"""
4014,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4015,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Leo sat down on the dike and said that he did not know.
4016,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4017,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You cannot pull a plough,"" said the Bull, with a little touch of"
4018,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"contempt. ""I can, and that prevents me from thinking of the Scorpion."""
4019,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4020,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo was angry, and said nothing till the dawn broke, and the"
4021,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],cultivator came to yoke the Bull to his work.
4022,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4023,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Sing,"" said the Bull, as the stiff, muddy ox-bow creaked and"
4024,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"strained. ""My shoulder is galled. Sing one of the songs that we sang"
4025,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"when we thought we were all Gods together."""
4026,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4027,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo stepped back into the canebrake, and lifted up his voice in a song"
4028,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],of the Children of the Zodiac--the war-whoop of the young Gods who are
4029,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"afraid of nothing. At first he dragged the song along unwillingly, and"
4030,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"then the song dragged him, and his voice rolled across the fields, and"
4031,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Bull stepped to the tune, and the cultivator banged his flanks out"
4032,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"of sheer light-heartedness, and the furrows rolled away behind the"
4033,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],plough more and more swiftly. Then the Girl came across the fields
4034,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"looking for Leo, and found him singing in the cane. She joined her"
4035,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"voice to his, and the cultivator's wife brought her spinning into the"
4036,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],open and listened with all her children round her. When it was time
4037,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"for the nooning, Leo and the Girl had sung themselves both thirsty and"
4038,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"hungry, but the cultivator and his wife gave them rye bread and milk,"
4039,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],and many thanks; and the Bull found occasion to say:
4040,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4041,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You have helped me to do a full half field more than I should have"
4042,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"done. But the hardest part of the day is to come, brother."""
4043,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4044,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Leo wished to lie down and brood over the words of the Crab. The Girl
4045,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"went away to talk to the cultivator's wife and baby, and the afternoon"
4046,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],ploughing began.
4047,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4048,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Help us now,"" said the Bull. ""The tides of the day are running down."
4049,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"My legs are very stiff. Sing, if you never sang before."""
4050,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4051,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""To a mud-spattered villager?"" said Leo."
4052,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4053,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""He is under the same doom as ourselves. Are you a coward?"" said the"
4054,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Bull.
4055,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4056,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo flushed, and began again with a sore throat and a bad temper."
4057,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Little by little he dropped away from the songs of the Children and
4058,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],made up a song as he went along; and this was a thing he could never
4059,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],have done had he not met the Crab face to face. He remembered facts
4060,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],concerning cultivators and bullocks and rice-fields that he had not
4061,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"particularly noticed before the interview, and he strung them all"
4062,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"together, growing more interested as he sang, and he told the"
4063,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],cultivator much more about himself and his work than the cultivator
4064,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],knew. The Bull grunted approval as he toiled down the furrows for the
4065,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"last time that day, and the song ended, leaving the cultivator with a"
4066,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],very good opinion of himself in his aching bones. The Girl came out of
4067,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the hut where she had been keeping the children quiet, and talking"
4068,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"woman-talk to the wife, and they all ate the evening meal together."
4069,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4070,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Now yours must be a very pleasant life,"" said the cultivator;"
4071,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""sitting as you do on a dyke all day and singing just what comes into"
4072,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"your head. Have you been at it long, you two--gipsies?"""
4073,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4074,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Ah!"" lowed the Bull from his byre. ""That's all the thanks you will"
4075,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"ever get from men, brother."""
4076,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4077,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No. We have only just begun it,"" said the Girl; ""but we are going to"
4078,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"keep to it as long as we live. Are we not, Leo?"""
4079,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4080,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Yes,"" said he; and they went away hand in hand."
4081,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4082,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You can sing beautifully, Leo,"" said she, as a wife will to her"
4083,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],husband.
4084,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4085,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What were you doing?"" said he."
4086,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4087,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I was talking to the mother and the babies,"" she said. ""You would not"
4088,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"understand the little things that make us women laugh."""
4089,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4090,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""And--and I am to go on with this--this gipsy work?"" said Leo."
4091,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4092,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Yes, dear, and I will help you."""
4093,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4094,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"There is no written record of the life of Leo and of the Girl, so we"
4095,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],cannot tell how Leo took to his new employment which he detested. We
4096,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],are only sure that the Girl loved him when and wherever he sang; even
4097,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"when, after the song was done, she went round with the equivalent of a"
4098,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],tambourine and collected the pence for the daily bread. There were
4099,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"times, too, when it was Leo's very hard task to console the Girl for"
4100,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the indignity of horrible praise that people gave him and her--for the
4101,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"silly wagging peacock feathers that they stuck in his cap, and the"
4102,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"buttons and pieces of cloth that they sewed on his coat. Woman-like,"
4103,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"she could advise and help to the end, but the meanness of the means"
4104,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],revolted.
4105,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4106,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What does it matter,"" Leo would say, ""so long as the songs make them"
4107,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"a little happier?"" And they would go down the road and begin again on"
4108,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the old, old refrain--that whatever came or did not come the children"
4109,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"of men must not be afraid. It was heavy teaching at first, but in"
4110,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],process of years Leo discovered that he could make men laugh and hold
4111,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],them listening to him even when the rain fell. Yet there were people
4112,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"who would sit down and cry softly, though the crowd was yelling with"
4113,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"delight, and there were people who maintained that Leo made them do"
4114,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],this; and the Girl would talk to them in the pauses of the performance
4115,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"and do her best to comfort them. People would die, too, while Leo was"
4116,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],talking and singing and laughing; for the Archer and the Scorpion and
4117,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the Crab and the other Houses were as busy as ever. Sometimes the
4118,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"crowd broke, and were frightened, and Leo strove to keep them steady"
4119,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],by telling them that this was cowardly; and sometimes they mocked at
4120,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Houses that were killing them, and Leo explained that this was"
4121,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],even more cowardly than running away.
4122,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4123,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"In their wanderings they came across the Bull, or the Ram, or the"
4124,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Twins, but all were too busy to do more than nod to each other across"
4125,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the crowd, and go on with their work. As the years rolled on even that"
4126,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"recognition ceased, for the Children of the Zodiac had forgotten that"
4127,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],they had ever been Gods working for the sake of men. The star
4128,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Aldebaran was crusted with caked dirt on the Bull's forehead, the"
4129,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Ram's fleece was dusty and torn, and the Twins were only babies"
4130,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"fighting over the cat on the door-step. It was then that Leo said,"
4131,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Let us stop singing and making jokes."" And it was then that the Girl"
4132,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"said, ""No."" But she did not know why she said ""No"" so energetically."
4133,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo maintained that it was perversity, till she herself, at the end of"
4134,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"a dusty day, made the same suggestion to him, and he said, ""Most"
4135,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"certainly not!"" and they quarrelled miserably between the hedgerows,"
4136,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],forgetting the meaning of the stars above them. Other singers and
4137,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"other talkers sprang up in the course of the years, and Leo,"
4138,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"forgetting that there could never be too many of these, hated them for"
4139,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"dividing the applause of the children of men, which he thought should"
4140,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"be all his own. The Girl would grow angry too, and then the songs"
4141,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"would be broken, and the jests fall flat for weeks to come, and the"
4142,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"children of men would shout: ""Go home, you two gipsies. Go home and"
4143,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"learn something worth singing!"""
4144,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4145,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"After one of these sorrowful, shameful days, the Girl, walking by"
4146,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo's side through the fields, saw the full moon coming up over the"
4147,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"trees, and she clutched Leo's arm, crying: ""The time has come now. Oh,"
4148,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo, forgive me!"""
4149,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4150,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What is it?"" said Leo. He was thinking of the other singers."
4151,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4152,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""My husband!"" she answered, and she laid his hand upon her breast, and"
4153,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the breast that he knew so well was hard as stone. Leo groaned,"
4154,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],remembering what the Crab had said.
4155,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4156,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Surely we were Gods once,"" he cried."
4157,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4158,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Surely we are Gods still,"" said the Girl. ""Do you not remember when"
4159,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],you and I went to the House of the Crab and--were not very much
4160,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],afraid? And since then ... we have forgotten what we were singing
4161,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"for--we sang for the pence, and, oh, we fought for them!--We, who are"
4162,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Children of the Zodiac!"""
4163,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4164,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""It was my fault,"" said Leo."
4165,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4166,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""How can there be any fault of yours that is not mine too?"" said the"
4167,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Girl. ""My time has come, but you will live longer, and...."" The look"
4168,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],in her eyes said all she could not say.
4169,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4170,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Yes, I will remember that we are Gods,"" said Leo."
4171,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4172,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"It is very hard, even for a child of the Zodiac who has forgotten his"
4173,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Godhead, to see his wife dying slowly, and to know that he cannot help"
4174,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],her. The Girl told Leo in those last months of all that she had said
4175,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],and done among the wives and the babies at the back of the roadside
4176,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"performances, and Leo was astonished that he knew so little of her who"
4177,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],had been so much to him. When she was dying she told him never to
4178,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"fight for pence or quarrel with the other singers; and, above all, to"
4179,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],go on with his singing immediately after she was dead.
4180,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4181,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Then she died, and after he had buried her he went down the road to a"
4182,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"village that he knew, and the people hoped that he would begin"
4183,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],quarrelling with a new singer that had sprung up while he had been
4184,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"away. But Leo called him ""my brother."" The new singer was newly"
4185,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],married--and Leo knew it--and when he had finished singing Leo
4186,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"straightened himself, and sang the ""Song of the Girl,"" which he had"
4187,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"made coming down the road. Every man who was married, or hoped to be"
4188,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"married, whatever his rank or colour, understood that song--even the"
4189,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],bride leaning on the new husband's arm understood it too--and
4190,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"presently when the song ended, and Leo's heart was bursting in him,"
4191,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the men sobbed. ""That was a sad tale,"" they said at last, ""now make us"
4192,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"laugh."" Because Leo had known all the sorrow that a man could know,"
4193,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],including the full knowledge of his own fall who had once been a
4194,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"God--he, changing his song quickly, made the people laugh till they"
4195,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],could laugh no more. They went away feeling ready for any trouble in
4196,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"reason, and they gave Leo more peacock feathers and pence than he"
4197,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],could count. Knowing that pence led to quarrels and that peacock
4198,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"feathers were hateful to the Girl, he put them aside and went away to"
4199,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"look for his brothers, to remind them that they too were Gods."
4200,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4201,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"He found the Bull goring the undergrowth in a ditch, for the Scorpion"
4202,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"had stung him, and he was dying, not slowly, as the Girl had died, but"
4203,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],quickly.
4204,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4205,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I know all,"" the Bull groaned, as Leo came up. ""I had forgotten, too,"
4206,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],but I remember now. Go and look at the fields I ploughed. The furrows
4207,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"are straight. I forgot that I was a God, but I drew the plough"
4208,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"perfectly straight, for all that. And you, brother?"""
4209,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4210,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I am not at the end of the ploughing,"" said Leo. ""Does Death hurt?"""
4211,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4212,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No; but dying does,"" said the Bull, and he died. The cultivator who"
4213,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"then owned him was much annoyed, for there was a field still"
4214,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],unploughed.
4215,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4216,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],It was after this that Leo made the Song of the Bull who had been a
4217,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"God and forgotten the fact, and he sang it in such a manner that half"
4218,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the young men in the world conceived that they too might be Gods
4219,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"without knowing it. A half of that half grew impossibly conceited, and"
4220,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"died early. A half of the remainder strove to be Gods and failed, but"
4221,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],the other half accomplished four times more work than they would have
4222,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],done under any other delusion.
4223,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4224,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Later, years later, always wandering up and down, and making the"
4225,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"children of men laugh, he found the Twins sitting on the bank of a"
4226,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],stream waiting for the Fishes to come and carry them away. They were
4227,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"not in the least afraid, and they told Leo that the woman of the House"
4228,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"had a real baby of her own, and that when that baby grew old enough to"
4229,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],be mischievous he would find a well-educated cat waiting to have its
4230,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"tail pulled. Then the Fishes came for them, but all that the people"
4231,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],saw was two children drowning in a brook; and though their
4232,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"foster-mother was very sorry, she hugged her own real baby to her"
4233,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"breast, and was grateful that it was only the foundlings."
4234,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4235,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Then Leo made the Song of the Twins who had forgotten that they were
4236,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Gods, and had played in the dust to amuse a foster-mother. That song"
4237,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],was sung far and wide among the women. It caused them to laugh and cry
4238,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],and hug their babies closer to their hearts all in one breath; and
4239,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"some of the women who remembered the Girl said: ""Surely that is the"
4240,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"voice of Virgo. Only she could know so much about ourselves."""
4241,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4242,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"After those three songs were made, Leo sang them over and over again,"
4243,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"till he was in danger of looking upon them as so many mere words, and"
4244,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the people who listened grew tired, and there came back to Leo the"
4245,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],old temptation to stop singing once and for all. But he remembered the
4246,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Girl's dying words and went on.
4247,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4248,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"One of his listeners interrupted him as he was singing. ""Leo,"" said"
4249,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"he, ""I have heard you telling us not to be afraid for the past forty"
4250,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"years. Can you not sing something new now?"""
4251,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4252,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""No,"" said Leo; ""it is the only song that I am allowed to sing. You"
4253,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"must not be afraid of the Houses, even when they kill you."""
4254,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4255,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"The man turned to go, wearily, but there came a whistling through the"
4256,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"air, and the arrow of the Archer was seen skimming low above the"
4257,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"earth, pointing to the man's heart. He drew himself up, and stood"
4258,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],still waiting till the arrow struck home.
4259,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4260,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I die,"" he said, quietly. ""It is well for me, Leo, that you sang for"
4261,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"forty years."""
4262,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4263,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Are you afraid?"" said Leo, bending over him."
4264,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4265,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I am a man, not a God,"" said the man. ""I should have run away but for"
4266,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"your Songs. My work is done, and I die without making a show of my"
4267,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"fear."""
4268,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4269,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I am very well paid,"" said Leo to himself. ""Now that I see what my"
4270,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"songs are doing, I will sing better ones."""
4271,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4272,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"He went down the road, collected his little knot of listeners, and"
4273,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],began the Song of the Girl. In the middle of his singing he felt the
4274,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],cold touch of the Crab's claw on the apple of his throat. He lifted
4275,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"his hand, choked, and stopped for an instant."
4276,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4277,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Sing on, Leo,"" said the crowd. ""The old song runs as well as ever it"
4278,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"did."""
4279,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4280,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo went on steadily till the end, with the cold fear at his heart."
4281,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"When his song was ended, he felt the grip on his throat tighten. He"
4282,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"was old, he had lost the Girl, he knew that he was losing more than"
4283,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"half his power to sing, he could scarcely walk to the diminishing"
4284,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"crowds that waited for him, and could not see their faces when they"
4285,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],stood about him. None the less he cried angrily to the Crab:
4286,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4287,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Why have you come for me _now_?"""
4288,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4289,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You were born under my care. How can I help coming for you?"" said the"
4290,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Crab, wearily. Every human being whom the Crab killed had asked that"
4291,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],same question.
4292,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4293,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""But I was just beginning to know what my songs were doing,"" said Leo."
4294,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4295,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Perhaps that is why,"" said the Crab, and the grip tightened."
4296,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4297,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""You said you would not come till I had taken the world by the"
4298,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"shoulders,"" gasped Leo, falling back."
4299,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4300,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""I always keep my word. You have done that three times, with three"
4301,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"songs. What more do you desire?"""
4302,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4303,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Let me live to see the world know it,"" pleaded Leo. ""Let me be sure"
4304,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"that my songs----"""
4305,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4306,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""Make men brave?"" said the Crab. ""Even then there would be one man who"
4307,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"was afraid. The Girl was braver than you are. Come."""
4308,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4309,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Leo was standing close to the restless, insatiable mouth. ""I forgot,"""
4310,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"said he, simply. ""The Girl was braver. But I am a God too, and I am"
4311,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"not afraid."""
4312,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4313,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"""What is that to me?"" said the Crab."
4314,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4315,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"Then Leo's speech was taken from him, and he lay still and dumb,"
4316,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],watching Death till he died.
4317,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4318,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Leo was the last of the Children of the Zodiac. After his death there
4319,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"sprang up a breed of little mean men, whimpering and flinching and"
4320,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"howling because the Houses killed them and theirs, who wished to live"
4321,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"forever without any pain. They did not increase their lives, but they"
4322,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"increased their own torments miserably, and there were no Children of"
4323,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"the Zodiac to guide them, and the greater part of Leo's songs were"
4324,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],lost.
4325,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4326,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],Only he had carved on the Girl's tombstone the last verse of the Song
4327,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"of the Girl, which stands at the head of this story."
4328,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4329,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"One of the children of men, coming thousands of years later, rubbed"
4330,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"away the lichen, read the lines, and applied them to a trouble other"
4331,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"than the one Leo meant. Being a man, men believed that he had made the"
4332,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"verses himself; but they belong to Leo, the Child of the Zodiac, and"
4333,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],"teach, as he taught, that what comes or does not come, we must not be"
4334,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],afraid.
4335,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],
4336,THE CHILDREN OF THE ZODIAC[2],

4342,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4343,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4344,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The least that Findlayson, of the Public Works Department, expected"
4345,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,was a C.I.E.; he dreamed of a C.S.I.: indeed his friends told him that
4346,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"he deserved more. For three years he had endured heat and cold,"
4347,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"disappointment, discomfort, danger, and disease, with responsibility"
4348,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"almost too heavy for one pair of shoulders; and day by day, through"
4349,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"that time, the great Kashi Bridge over the Ganges had grown under his"
4350,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"charge. Now, in less than three months, if all went well, His"
4351,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Excellency the Viceroy would open the bridge in state, an archbishop"
4352,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"would bless it, the first train-load of soldiers would come over it,"
4353,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and there would be speeches.
4354,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4355,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson, C. E., sat in his trolley on a construction-line that ran"
4356,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"along one of the main revetments--the huge, stone-faced banks that flared"
4357,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,away north and south for three miles on either side of the river--and
4358,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"permitted himself to think of the end. With its approaches, his work was"
4359,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"one mile and three-quarters in length; a lattice-girder bridge, trussed"
4360,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"with the Findlayson truss, standing on seven-and-twenty brick piers. Each"
4361,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"one of those piers was twenty-four feet in diameter, capped with red Agra"
4362,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the Ganges' bed.
4363,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Above them ran the railway-line fifteen feet broad; above that, again, a"
4364,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"cart-road of eighteen feet, flanked with footpaths. At either end rose"
4365,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"towers of red brick, loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns, and"
4366,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches. The raw
4367,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,earth-ends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny
4368,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,asses climbing out of the yawning borrow-pit below with sackfuls of stuff;
4369,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves, the rattle"
4370,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of the drivers' sticks, and the swish and roll-down of the dirt. The river"
4371,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was very low, and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre"
4372,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"piers stood squat cribs of railway-sleepers, filled within and daubed"
4373,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"without with mud, to support the last of the girders as those were riveted"
4374,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"up. In the little deep water left by the drought, an overhead-crane"
4375,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"travelled to and fro along its spile-pier, jerking sections of iron into"
4376,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"place, snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the"
4377,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,timber-yard. Riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice side-work
4378,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and the iron roof of the railway-line, hung from invisible staging under"
4379,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the bellies of the girders, clustered round the throats of the piers, and"
4380,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,rode on the overhang of the footpath-stanchions; their fire-pots and the
4381,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,spurts of flame that answered each hammer-stroke showing no more than pale
4382,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,yellow in the sun's glare. East and west and north and south the
4383,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"construction-trains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments, the"
4384,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the
4385,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"side-boards were unpinned, and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand"
4386,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,tons more material were thrown out to hold the river in place.
4387,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4388,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson, C. E., turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the"
4389,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,country that he had changed for seven miles around. Looked back on the
4390,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"humming village of five thousand workmen; up stream and down, along the"
4391,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"vista of spurs and sand; across the river to the far piers, lessening in"
4392,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the haze; overhead to the guard-towers--and only he knew how strong those
4393,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,were--and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good. There
4394,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stood his bridge before him in the sunlight, lacking only a few weeks'"
4395,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"work on the girders of the three middle piers--his bridge, raw and ugly as"
4396,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"original sin, but _pukka_--permanent--to endure when all memory of the"
4397,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"builder, yea, even of the splendid Findlayson truss, had perished."
4398,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Practically, the thing was done."
4399,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4400,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hitchcock, his assistant, cantered along the line on a little"
4401,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"switch-tailed Kabuli pony, who, through long practice, could have"
4402,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"trotted securely over a trestle, and nodded to his chief."
4403,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4404,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All but,"" said he, with a smile."
4405,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4406,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I've been thinking about it,"" the senior answered, ""Not half a bad"
4407,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"job for two men, is it?"" ""One--and a half. 'Gad, what a Cooper's Hill"
4408,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"cub I was when I came on the works!"" Hitchcock felt very old in the"
4409,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"crowded experiences of the past three years, that had taught him power"
4410,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and responsibility.
4411,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4412,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""You _were_ rather a colt,"" said Findlayson. ""I wonder how you'll like"
4413,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"going back to office work when this job's over."""
4414,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4415,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I shall hate it!"" said the young man, and as he went on his eye"
4416,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"followed Findlayson's, and he muttered, ""Is n't it good?"""
4417,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4418,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I think we'll go up the service together,"" Findlayson said to"
4419,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"himself. ""You're too good a youngster to waste on another man. Cub"
4420,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"thou wast; assistant thou art. Personal assistant, and at Simla, thou"
4421,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"shalt be, if any credit comes to me out of the business!"""
4422,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4423,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Indeed, the burden of the work had fallen altogether on Findlayson and"
4424,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"his assistant, the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness"
4425,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,to break to his own needs. There were labour-contractors by the
4426,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"half-hundred--fitters and riveters, European, borrowed from the"
4427,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"railway workshops, with perhaps twenty white and half-caste"
4428,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"subordinates to direct, under direction, the bevies of workmen--but"
4429,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"none knew better than these two, who trusted each other, how the"
4430,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,underlings were not to be trusted. They had been tried many times in
4431,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"sudden crises--by slipping of booms, by breaking of tackle, failure"
4432,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of cranes, and the wrath of the river--but no stress had brought to"
4433,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,light any man among them whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have
4434,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves.
4435,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Findlayson thought it over from the beginning: the months of office
4436,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India, at the last"
4437,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge, under the"
4438,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought to ruin"
4439,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"at least half an acre of calculations--and Hitchcock, new to"
4440,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the"
4441,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,heart-breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in England;
4442,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commission if
4443,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"one, only one, rather doubtful consignment were passed; the war that"
4444,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"followed the refusal; the careful, polite obstruction at the other end"
4445,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"that followed the war, till young Hitchcock, putting one month's leave"
4446,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to another month, and borrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his"
4447,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to London, and there, as"
4448,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"his own tongue asserted, and the later consignments proved, put the"
4449,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Fear of God into a man so great that he feared only Parliament, and"
4450,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"said so till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner-table,"
4451,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and--he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name. Then
4452,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the
4453,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,bridge-works; and after the cholera smote the small-pox. The fever
4454,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,they had always with them. Hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate
4455,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of the third class with whipping powers, for the better government of"
4456,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the community, and Findlayson watched him wield his powers"
4457,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"temperately, learning what to overlook and what to look after. It was"
4458,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"a long, long reverie, and it covered storm, sudden freshets, death in"
4459,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"every manner and shape, violent and awful rage against red tape half"
4460,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things;
4461,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"drought, sanitation, finance; birth, wedding, burial, and riot in the"
4462,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"village of twenty warring castes; argument, expostulation, persuasion,"
4463,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon, thankful that his"
4464,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,rifle is all in pieces in the gun-case. Behind everything rose the
4465,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"black frame of the Kashi Bridge--plate by plate, girder by girder,"
4466,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"span by span--and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock, the all-round"
4467,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"man, who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to"
4468,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"this last. So the bridge was two men's work--unless one counted Peroo,"
4469,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"as Peroo certainly counted himself. He was a lascar, a Kharva from"
4470,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Bulsar, familiar with every port between Rockhampton and London, who"
4471,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"had risen to the rank of serang on the British India boats, but"
4472,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"wearying of routine musters and clean clothes, had thrown up the"
4473,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"service and gone inland, where men of his calibre were sure of"
4474,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,employment. For his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy
4475,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"weights, Peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put"
4476,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"upon his services; but custom decreed the wage of the overhead-men,"
4477,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and Peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value.
4478,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid; and, as an"
4479,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"ex-serang, he knew how to hold authority. No piece of iron was so big"
4480,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,or so badly placed that Peroo could not devise a tackle to lift it--a
4481,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"loose-ended, sagging arrangement, rigged with a scandalous amount of"
4482,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"talking, but perfectly equal to the work in hand. It was Peroo who had"
4483,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,saved the girder of Number Seven Pier from destruction when the new
4484,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"wire rope jammed in the eye of the crane, and the huge plate tilted in"
4485,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"its slings, threatening to slide out sideways. Then the native workmen"
4486,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"lost their heads with great shoutings, and Hitchcock's right arm was"
4487,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"broken by a falling T-plate, and he buttoned it up in his coat and"
4488,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"swooned, and came to and directed for four hours till Peroo, from the"
4489,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"top of the crane reported, ""All's well,"" and the plate swung home."
4490,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"There was no one like Peroo, serang, to lash and guy and hold, to"
4491,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"control the donkey-engines, to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out"
4492,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of the borrow-pit into which it had tumbled; to strip and dive, if"
4493,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"need be, to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the"
4494,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"scouring of Mother Gunga, or to adventure up-stream on a monsoon night"
4495,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and report on the state of the embankment-facings. He would interrupt
4496,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the field-councils of Findlayson and Hitchcock without fear, till his"
4497,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"wonderful English, or his still more wonderful _lingua-franca_, half"
4498,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Portuguese and half Malay, ran out and he was forced to take string"
4499,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and show the knots that he would recommend. He controlled his own gang
4500,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,of tacklemen--mysterious relatives from Kutch Mandvi gathered month by
4501,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,month and tried to the uttermost. No consideration of family or kin
4502,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"allowed Peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the pay-roll. ""My"
4503,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"honour is the honour of this bridge,"" he would say to the about-to-be"
4504,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"dismissed. ""What do I care for your honour? Go and work on a steamer."
4505,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"That is all you are fit for."""
4506,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4507,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,The little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round
4508,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the tattered dwelling of a sea-priest--one who had never set foot on
4509,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Black Water, but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two"
4510,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"generations of sea-rovers, all unaffected by port missions or those"
4511,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along Thames' bank.
4512,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The priest of the lascars had nothing to do with their caste, or"
4513,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"indeed with anything at all. He ate the offerings of his church, and"
4514,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"slept and smoked, and slept again, ""for,"" said Peroo, who had haled"
4515,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"him a thousand miles inland, ""he is a very holy man. He never cares"
4516,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"what you eat so long as you do not eat beef, and that is good, because"
4517,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"on land we worship Shiva, we Kharvas; but at sea on the Kumpani's"
4518,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,boats we attend strictly to the orders of the Burra Malum (the first
4519,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"mate), and on this bridge we observe what Finlinson Sahib says."""
4520,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4521,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Findlayson Sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding
4522,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"from the guard-tower on the right bank, and Peroo with his mates was"
4523,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly
4524,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster.
4525,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4526,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,From his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serang's silver pipe
4527,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and the creak and clatter of the pulleys. Peroo was standing on the
4528,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"topmost coping of the tower, clad in the blue dungaree of his"
4529,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"abandoned service, and as Findlayson motioned to him to be careful,"
4530,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"for his was no life to throw away, he gripped the last pole, and,"
4531,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"shading his eyes ship-fashion, answered with the long-drawn wail of"
4532,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the fo'c'sle lookout: ""_Ham dekhta hai_"" (""I am looking out"")."
4533,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson laughed, and then sighed. It was years since he had seen a"
4534,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"steamer, and he was sick for home. As his trolley passed under the"
4535,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"tower, Peroo descended by a rope, ape-fashion, and cried: ""It looks"
4536,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"well now, Sahib. Our bridge is all but done. What think you Mother"
4537,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Gunga will say when the rail runs over?"""
4538,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4539,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""She has said little so far. It was never Mother Gunga that delayed"
4540,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"us."""
4541,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4542,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""There is always time for her; and none the less there has been delay."
4543,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Has the Sahib forgotten last autumn's flood, when the stone-boats"
4544,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"were sunk without warning--or only a half-day's warning?"""
4545,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4546,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Yes, but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now. The spurs are"
4547,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"holding well on the west bank."""
4548,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4549,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Mother Gunga eats great allowances. There is always room for more"
4550,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stone on the revetments. I tell this to the Chota Sahib""--he meant"
4551,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hitchcock--""and he laughs."""
4552,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4553,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""No matter, Peroo. Another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in"
4554,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"thine own fashion."""
4555,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4556,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The lascar grinned. ""Then it will not be in this way--with stonework"
4557,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"sunk under water, as the _Quetta_ was sunk. I like sus-sus-pen-sheen"
4558,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"bridges that fly from bank to bank, with one big step, like a"
4559,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,gang-plank. Then no water can hurt. When does the Lord Sahib come to
4560,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"open the bridge?"""
4561,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4562,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""In three months, when the weather is cooler."""
4563,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4564,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Ho! ho! He is like the Burra Malum. He sleeps below while the work is"
4565,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,being done. Then he comes upon the quarter-deck and touches with his
4566,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"finger and says: 'This is not clean! Jiboon-wallah!'"""
4567,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4568,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""But the Lord Sahib does not call me a jiboon-wallah, Peroo."""
4569,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4570,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""No, Sahib; but he does not come on deck till the work is all"
4571,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,finished. Even the Burra Malum of the _Nerbudda_ said once at
4572,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Tuticorin----"""
4573,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4574,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Bah! Go! I am busy."""
4575,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4576,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I, also!"" said Peroo, with an unshaken countenance. ""May I take the"
4577,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"light dinghy now and row along the spurs?"""
4578,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4579,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""To hold them with thy hands? They are, I think, sufficiently heavy."""
4580,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4581,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Nay, Sahib. It is thus. At sea, on the Black Water, we have room to"
4582,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,be blown up and down without care. Here we have no room at all. Look
4583,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"you, we have put the river into a dock, and run her between stone"
4584,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"sills."""
4585,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4586,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson smiled at the ""we."""
4587,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4588,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""We have bitted and bridled her. She is not like the sea, that can"
4589,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"beat against a soft beach. She is Mother Gunga--in irons."" His voice"
4590,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,fell a little.
4591,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4592,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Peroo, thou hast been up and down the world more even than I. Speak"
4593,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"true talk, now. How much dost thou in thy heart believe of Mother"
4594,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Gunga?"""
4595,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4596,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All that our priest says. London is London, Sahib. Sydney is Sydney,"
4597,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and Port Darwin is Port Darwin. Also Mother Gunga is Mother Gunga, and"
4598,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,when I come back to her banks I know this and worship. In London I did
4599,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the God
4600,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"within.... Yes, I will not take the cushions in the dinghy."""
4601,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4602,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow
4603,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that he shared with his assistant. The place had become home to him in
4604,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the last three years. He had grilled in the heat, sweated in the"
4605,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"rains, and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof; the"
4606,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"lime-wash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulæ,"
4607,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and the sentry-path trodden in the matting of the veranda showed where
4608,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,he had walked alone. There is no eight-hour limit to an engineer's
4609,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"work, and the evening meal with Hitchcock was eaten booted and"
4610,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,spurred: over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as
4611,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the gangs came up from the river-bed and the lights began to twinkle.
4612,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4613,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy. He's taken a couple of"
4614,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"nephews with him, and he's lolling in the stern like a commodore,"""
4615,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,said Hitchcock.
4616,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4617,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""That's all right. He's got something on his mind. You 'd think that"
4618,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,ten years in the British India boats would have knocked most of his
4619,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"religion out of him."""
4620,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4621,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""So it has,"" said Hitchcock, chuckling. ""I over-heard him the other"
4622,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old _guru_
4623,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,of theirs. Peroo denied the efficacy of prayer; and wanted the _guru_
4624,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to go to sea and watch a gale out with him, and see if he could stop a"
4625,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"monsoon."""
4626,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4627,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All the same, if you carried off his _guru_ he'd leave us like a"
4628,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,shot. He was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of St.
4629,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Paul's when he was in London."""
4630,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4631,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""He told me that the first time he went into the engine-room of a"
4632,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"steamer, when he was a boy, he prayed to the low-pressure cylinder."""
4633,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4634,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Not half bad a thing to pray to, either. He's propitiating his own"
4635,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Gods now, and he wants to know what Mother Gunga will think of a"
4636,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"bridge being run across her. Who's there?"" A shadow darkened the"
4637,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"doorway, and a telegram was put into Hitchcock's hand."
4638,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4639,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""She ought to be pretty well used to it by this time. Only a _tar_. It"
4640,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"ought to be Ralli's answer about the new rivets.... Great Heavens!"""
4641,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Hitchcock jumped to his feet.
4642,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4643,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What is it?"" said the senior, and took the form. ""_That's_ what"
4644,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Mother Gunga thinks, is it,"" he said, reading. ""Keep cool, young 'un."
4645,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"We've got all our work cut out for us. Let's see. Muir wires, half an"
4646,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"hour ago: '_Floods on the Ramgunga. Look out._' Well, that gives"
4647,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"us--one, two--nine and a half for the flood to reach Melipur Ghaut and"
4648,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,seven's sixteen and a half to Latodi--say fifteen hours before it
4649,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"comes down to us."""
4650,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4651,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Curse that hill-fed sewer of a Ramgunga! Findlayson, this is two"
4652,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"months before anything could have been expected, and the left bank is"
4653,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"littered up with stuff still. Two full months before the time!"""
4654,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4655,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""That's why it happens. I've only known Indian rivers for five and"
4656,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"twenty years, and I don't pretend to understand. Here comes another"
4657,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"_tar_."" Findlayson opened the telegram. ""Cockran, this time, from the"
4658,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Ganges Canal: '_Heavy rains here. Bad._' He might have saved the last
4659,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"word. Well, we don't want to know any more. We've got to work the"
4660,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,gangs all night and clean up the river-bed. You'll take the east bank
4661,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and work out to meet me in the middle. Get everything that floats
4662,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,below the bridge: we shall have quite enough river-craft coming down
4663,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"adrift anyhow, without letting the stone-boats ram the piers. What"
4664,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"have you got on the east bank that needs looking after?"""
4665,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4666,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Pontoon, one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it. T'other"
4667,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"overhead crane on the mended pontoon, with the cart-road rivets from"
4668,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Twenty to Twenty-three piers--two construction lines, and a"
4669,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"turning-spur. The pile-work must take its chance,"" said Hitchcock."
4670,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4671,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All right. Roll up everything you can lay hands on. We'll give the"
4672,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub."""
4673,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4674,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Close to the veranda stood a big night-gong, never used except for"
4675,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"flood, or fire in the village. Hitchcock had called for a fresh horse,"
4676,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and was off to his side of the bridge when Findlayson took the
4677,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,cloth-bound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out
4678,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the full thunder of the metal.
4679,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4680,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Long before the last rumble ceased every night-gong in the village had
4681,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,taken up the warning. To these were added the hoarse screaming of
4682,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,conches in the little temples; the throbbing of drums and tom-toms;
4683,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and from the European quarters, where the riveters lived, McCartney's"
4684,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"bugle, a weapon of offence on Sundays and festivals, brayed"
4685,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"desperately, calling to ""Stables."" Engine after engine toiling home"
4686,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,along the spurs after her day's work whistled in answer till the
4687,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,whistles were answered from the far bank. Then the big gong thundered
4688,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire; conch, drum, and"
4689,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"whistle echoed the call, and the village quivered to the sound of bare"
4690,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,feet running upon soft earth. The order in all cases was to stand by
4691,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the day's work and wait instructions. The gangs poured by in the dusk;
4692,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,men stopping to knot a loin-cloth or fasten a sandal; gang-foremen
4693,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the tool-issue
4694,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,sheds for bars and mattocks; locomotives creeping down their tracks
4695,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"wheel-deep in the crowd, till the brown torrent disappeared into the"
4696,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"dusk of the river-bed, raced over the pile-work, swarmed along the"
4697,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"lattices, clustered by the cranes, and stood still, each man in his"
4698,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,place.
4699,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4700,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up
4701,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"everything and bear it beyond high-water mark, and the flare-lamps"
4702,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters
4703,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,began a night's work racing against the flood that was to come. The
4704,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,girders of the three centre piers--those that stood on the cribs--were
4705,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,all but in position. They needed just as many rivets as could be
4706,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"driven into them, for the flood would assuredly wash out the supports,"
4707,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were
4708,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,not blocked at the ends. A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers
4709,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers. It was heaved up
4710,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"in lengths, loaded into trucks, and backed up the bank beyond"
4711,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,flood-level by the groaning locomotives. The tool-sheds on the sands
4712,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"melted away before the attack of shouting armies, and with them went"
4713,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the stacked ranks of Government stores, iron-bound boxes of rivets,"
4714,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"pliers, cutters, duplicate parts of the rivet-machines, spare pumps"
4715,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and chains. The big crane would be the last to be shifted, for she was"
4716,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge.
4717,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The concrete blocks on the fleet of stone-boats were dropped overside,"
4718,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"where there was any depth of water, to guard the piers, and the empty"
4719,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,boats themselves were poled under the bridge down-stream. It was here
4720,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"that Peroo's pipe shrilled loudest, for the first stroke of the big"
4721,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"gong had brought aback the dinghy at racing speed, and Peroo and his"
4722,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"people were stripped to the waist, working for the honour and credit"
4723,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,which are better than life.
4724,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4725,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I knew she would speak,"" he cried. ""_I_ knew, but the telegraph gave"
4726,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,us good warning. O sons of unthinkable begetting--children of
4727,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"unspeakable shame--are we here for the look of the thing?"" It was two"
4728,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"feet of wire rope frayed at the ends, and it did wonders as Peroo"
4729,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"leaped from gunnel to gunnel, shouting the language of the sea."
4730,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4731,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Findlayson was more troubled for the stone-boats than anything else.
4732,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"McCartney, with his gangs, was blocking up the ends of the three"
4733,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"doubtful spans, but boats adrift, if the flood chanced to be a high"
4734,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"one, might endanger the girders; and there was a very fleet in the"
4735,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,shrunken channels.
4736,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4737,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Get them behind the swell of the guard-tower,"" he shouted down to"
4738,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Peroo. ""It will be dead-water there; get them below the bridge."""
4739,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4740,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""_Accha!_ [Very good.] _I_ know. We are mooring them with wire rope,"""
4741,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was the answer. ""Hah! Listen to the Chota Sahib. He is working hard."""
4742,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4743,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,From across the river came an almost continuous whistling of
4744,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"locomotives, backed by the rumble of stone. Hitchcock at the last"
4745,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of Tarakee stone in
4746,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,reinforcing his spurs and embankments.
4747,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4748,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""The bridge challenges Mother Gunga,"" said Peroo, with a laugh. ""But"
4749,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"when _she_ talks I know whose voice will be the loudest."""
4750,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4751,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"For hours the naked men worked, screaming and shouting under the"
4752,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"lights. It was a hot, moonless night; the end of it was darkened by"
4753,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,clouds and a sudden squall that made Findlayson very grave.
4754,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4755,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""She moves!"" said Peroo, just before the dawn. ""Mother Gunga is awake!"
4756,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hear!"" He dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current"
4757,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,mumbled on it. A little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp
4758,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,slap.
4759,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4760,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Six hours before her time,"" said Findlayson, mopping his forehead"
4761,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"savagely. ""Now we can't depend on anything. We'd better clear all"
4762,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"hands out of the river-bed."""
4763,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4764,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Again the big gong beat, and a second time there was the rushing of"
4765,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,naked feet on earth and ringing iron; the clatter of tools ceased. In
4766,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the silence, men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty"
4767,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,sand.
4768,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4769,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Foreman after foreman shouted to Findlayson, who had posted himself by"
4770,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the guard-tower, that his section of the river-bed had been cleaned"
4771,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"out, and when the last voice dropped Findlayson hurried over the"
4772,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the
4773,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"temporary plank-walk over the three centre piers, and there he met"
4774,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Hitchcock.
4775,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4776,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All clear your side?"" said Findlayson. The whisper rang in the box of"
4777,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,latticework.
4778,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4779,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Yes, and the east channel's filling now. We're utterly out of our"
4780,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"reckoning. When is this thing down on us?"""
4781,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4782,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""There's no saying. She's filling as fast as she can. Look!"""
4783,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet, where the sand,"
4784,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"burned and defiled by months of work, was beginning to whisper and"
4785,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,fizz.
4786,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4787,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What orders?"" said Hitchcock."
4788,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4789,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Call the roll--count stores--sit on your bunkers--and pray for the"
4790,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,bridge. That's all I can think of. Good night. Don't risk your life
4791,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"trying to fish out anything that may go down-stream."""
4792,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4793,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Oh, I'll be as prudent as you are! 'Night. Heavens, how she's"
4794,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"filling! Here's the rain in earnest!"" Findlayson picked his way back"
4795,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to his bank, sweeping the last of McCartney's riveters before him. The"
4796,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"gangs had spread themselves along the embankments, regardless of the"
4797,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"cold rain of the dawn, and there they waited for the flood. Only Peroo"
4798,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"kept his men together behind the swell of the guard-tower, where the"
4799,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stone-boats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers, wire-ropes, and"
4800,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,chains.
4801,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4802,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"A shrill wail ran along the line, growing to a yell, half fear and"
4803,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,half wonder: the face of the river whitened from bank to bank between
4804,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the stone facings, and the far-away spurs went out in spouts of foam."
4805,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Mother Gunga had come bank-high in haste, and a wall of"
4806,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,chocolate-coloured water was her messenger. There was a shriek above
4807,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the roar of the water, the complaint of the spans coming down on their"
4808,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies. The
4809,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,stone-boats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round
4810,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the abutment, and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against"
4811,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the dim sky-line.
4812,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4813,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do."
4814,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Now she is thus cramped God only knows what she will do!"" said Peroo,"
4815,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"watching the furious turmoil round the guard-tower. ""Ohé! Fight, then!"
4816,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Fight hard, for it is thus that a woman wears herself out."""
4817,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4818,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,But Mother Gunga would not fight as Peroo desired. After the first
4819,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"down-stream plunge there came no more walls of water, but the river"
4820,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"lifted herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in mid-summer,"
4821,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"plucking and fingering along the revetments, and banking up behind the"
4822,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,piers till even Findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his
4823,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,work.
4824,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4825,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"When day came the village gasped. ""Only last night,"" men said, turning"
4826,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to each other, ""it was as a town in the river-bed! Look now!"""
4827,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4828,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"And they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water, the racing"
4829,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,water that licked the throat of the piers. The farther bank was veiled
4830,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"by rain, into which the bridge ran out and vanished; the spurs"
4831,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"up-stream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings, and"
4832,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"down-stream the pent river, once freed of her guide-lines, had spread"
4833,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"like a sea to the horizon. Then hurried by, rolling in the water, dead"
4834,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"men and oxen together, with here and there a patch of thatched roof"
4835,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that melted when it touched a pier.
4836,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4837,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Big flood,"" said Peroo, and Findlayson nodded. It was as big a flood"
4838,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,as he had any wish to watch. His bridge would stand what was upon her
4839,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"now, but not very much more; and if by any of a thousand chances there"
4840,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"happened to be a weakness in the embankments, Mother Gunga would carry"
4841,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"his honour to the sea with the other raffle. Worst of all, there was"
4842,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,nothing to do except to sit still; and Findlayson sat still under his
4843,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head, and his boots were"
4844,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"over ankle in mire. He took no count of time, for the river was"
4845,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"marking the hours, inch by inch and foot by foot, along the"
4846,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"embankment, and he listened, numb and hungry, to the straining of the"
4847,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stone-boats, the hollow thunder under the piers, and the hundred"
4848,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,noises that make the full note of a flood. Once a dripping servant
4849,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"brought him food, but he could not eat; and once he thought that he"
4850,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river, and then he"
4851,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"smiled. The bridge's failure would hurt his assistant not a little,"
4852,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,but Hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do. For himself
4853,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the crash meant everything--everything that made a hard life worth the
4854,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"living. They would say, the men of his own profession--he remembered"
4855,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the half-pitying things that he himself had said when Lockhart's big
4856,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"water-works burst and broke down in brick heaps and sludge, and"
4857,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Lockhart's spirit broke in him and he died. He remembered what he
4858,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,himself had said when the Sumao Bridge went out in the big cyclone by
4859,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the sea; and most he remembered poor Hartopp's face three weeks
4860,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"later, when the shame had marked it. His bridge was twice the size of"
4861,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hartopp's, and it carried the Findlayson truss as well as the new"
4862,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,pier-shoe--the Findlayson bolted shoe. There were no excuses in his
4863,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"service. Government might listen, perhaps, but his own kind would"
4864,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"judge him by his bridge, as that stood or fell. He went over it in his"
4865,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"head, plate by plate, span by span, brick by brick, pier by pier,"
4866,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"remembering, comparing, estimating, and recalculating, lest there"
4867,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,should be any mistake; and through the long hours and through the
4868,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"nights of formulæ that danced and wheeled before him, a cold fear"
4869,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,would come to pinch his heart. His side of the sum was beyond
4870,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,question; but what man knew Mother Gunga's arithmetic? Even as he was
4871,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"making all sure by the multiplication-table, the river might be"
4872,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,scooping pot-holes to the very bottom of any one of those eighty-foot
4873,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,piers that carried his reputation. Again a servant came to him with
4874,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"food, but his mouth was dry, and he could only drink and return to the"
4875,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"decimals in his brain. And the river was still rising. Peroo, in a mat"
4876,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"shelter-coat, crouched at his feet, watching now his face and now the"
4877,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"face of the river, but saying nothing."
4878,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4879,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,At last the lascar rose and floundered through the mud toward the
4880,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"village, but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats."
4881,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4882,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Presently he returned, most irreverently driving before him the"
4883,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,priest of his creed--a fat old man with a gray beard that whipped the
4884,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder. Never was seen so
4885,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,lamentable a _guru_.
4886,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4887,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain,"""
4888,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"shouted Peroo, ""if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do?"
4889,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Thou hast dealt long with the Gods when they were contented and
4890,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"well-wishing. Now they are angry. Speak to them!"""
4891,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4892,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What is a man against the wrath of Gods?"" whined the priest, cowering"
4893,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"as the wind took him. ""Let me go to the temple, and I will pray"
4894,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"there."""
4895,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4896,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Son of a pig, pray _here_! Is there no return for salt fish and curry"
4897,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,powder and dried onions? Call aloud! Tell Mother Gunga we have had
4898,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"enough. Bid her be still for the night. I cannot pray, but I have"
4899,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"served in the Kumpani's boats, and when men did not obey my orders"
4900,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"I----"" A flourish of the wire-rope colt rounded the sentence, and the"
4901,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"priest, breaking from his disciple, fled to the village."
4902,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4903,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Fat pig!"" said Peroo. ""After all that we have done for him! When the"
4904,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,flood is down I will see to it that we get a new _guru_. Finlinson
4905,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Sahib, it darkens for night now, and since yesterday nothing has been"
4906,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"eaten. Be wise, Sahib. No man can endure watching and great thinking"
4907,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"on an empty belly. Lie down, Sahib. The river will do what the river"
4908,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"will do."""
4909,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4910,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""The bridge is mine; I cannot leave it."""
4911,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4912,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Wilt thou hold it up with thy hands, then?"" said Peroo, laughing. ""I"
4913,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,was troubled for my boats and sheers _before_ the flood came. Now we
4914,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,are in the hands of the Gods. The Sahib will not eat and lie down?
4915,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Take these, then. They are meat and good toddy together, and they kill"
4916,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"all weariness, besides the fever that follows the rain. I have eaten"
4917,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"nothing else to-day at all."""
4918,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4919,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,He took a small tin tobacco-box from his sodden waist-belt and thrust
4920,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"it into Findlayson's hand, saying, ""Nay, do not be afraid. It is no"
4921,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"more than opium--clean Malwa opium!"""
4922,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4923,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson shook two or three of the dark-brown pellets into his hand,"
4924,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and hardly knowing what he did, swallowed them. The stuff was at least"
4925,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,a good guard against fever--the fever that was creeping upon him out
4926,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,of the wet mud--and he had seen what Peroo could do in the stewing
4927,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box.
4928,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4929,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Peroo nodded with bright eyes. ""In a little--in a little the Sahib"
4930,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"will find that he thinks well again. I too will----"" He dived into his"
4931,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"treasure-box, resettled the rain-coat over his head, and squatted down"
4932,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to watch the boats. It was too dark now to see beyond the first pier,"
4933,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and the night seemed to have given the river new strength. Findlayson
4934,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stood with his chin on his chest, thinking. There was one point about"
4935,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,one of the piers--the Seventh--that that he had not fully settled in
4936,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,his mind. The figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one
4937,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"by one and at enormous intervals of time. There was a sound, rich and"
4938,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"mellow in his ears, like the deepest note of a double-bass--an"
4939,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours, as it"
4940,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"seemed. Then Peroo was at his elbow, shouting that a wire hawser had"
4941,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,snapped and the stone-boats were loose. Findlayson saw the fleet open
4942,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and swing out fanwise to a long-drawn shriek of wire straining across
4943,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,gunnels.
4944,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4945,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""A tree hit them. They will all go,"" cried Peroo. ""The main hawser has"
4946,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"parted. What does the Sahib do?"""
4947,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4948,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,An immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into Findlayson's mind.
4949,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and
4950,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,angles--each rope a line of white fire. But there was one rope which
4951,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was the master-rope. He could see that rope. If he could pull it once,"
4952,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet
4953,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guard-tower. But
4954,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"why, he wondered, was Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he"
4955,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"hastened down the bank? It was necessary to put the lascar aside,"
4956,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"gently and slowly, because it was necessary to save the boats, and,"
4957,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"further, to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so"
4958,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,difficult. And then--but it was of no conceivable importance--a wire
4959,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"rope raced through his hand burning it, the high bank disappeared, and"
4960,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem. He was
4961,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"sitting in the rainy darkness--sitting in a boat that spun like a top,"
4962,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and Peroo was standing over him.
4963,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4964,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I had forgotten,"" said the lascar slowly, ""that to those fasting and"
4965,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,unused the opium is worse than any wine. Those who die in Gunga go to
4966,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the Gods. Still, I have no desire to present myself before such great"
4967,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"ones. Can the Sahib swim?"""
4968,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4969,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What need? He can fly--fly as swiftly as the wind,"" was the thick"
4970,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,answer.
4971,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4972,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""He is mad!"" muttered Peroo under his breath. ""And he threw me aside"
4973,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"like a bundle of dung-cakes. Well, he will not know his death. The"
4974,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing. It is not
4975,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"good to look at death with a clear eye."""
4976,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
4977,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"He refreshed himself again from the tin box, squatted down in the bows"
4978,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of the reeling, pegged, and stitched craft staring through the mist at"
4979,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the nothing that was there. A warm drowsiness crept over Findlayson,"
4980,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the Chief Engineer, whose duty was with his bridge. The heavy"
4981,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills, and the"
4982,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids. He
4983,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure, for the water was"
4984,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"so solid that a man could surely step out upon it, and standing still"
4985,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,with his legs apart to keep his balance--this was the most important
4986,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,point--would be borne with great and easy speed to the shore. But yet
4987,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,a better plan came to him. It needed only an exertion of will for the
4988,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper; to waft it
4989,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,kite-fashion to the bank. Thereafter--the boat spun dizzily--suppose
4990,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the high wind got under the freed body? Would it tower up like a kite
4991,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and pitch headlong on the far-away sands, or would it duck about"
4992,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,beyond control through all eternity? Findlayson gripped the gunnel to
4993,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"anchor himself, for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the"
4994,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,flight before he had settled all his plans. Opium has more effect on
4995,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the white man than the black. Peroo was only comfortably indifferent
4996,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to accidents. ""She cannot live,"" he grunted. ""Her seams open already."
4997,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,If she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out; but a
4998,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"box with holes is no good. Finlinson Sahib, she fills."""
4999,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5000,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""_Accha!_ I am going away. Come thou also."""
5001,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5002,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"In his mind Findlayson had already escaped from the boat, and was"
5003,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot. His
5004,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,body--he was really sorry for its gross helplessness--lay in the
5005,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stern, the water rushing about its knees."
5006,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5007,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""How very ridiculous!"" he said to himself, from his eyrie; ""that--is"
5008,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Findlayson--chief of the Kashi Bridge. The poor beast is going to be
5009,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"drowned, too. Drowned when it's close to shore. I'm--I'm on shore"
5010,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"already. Why does n't it come along?"""
5011,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5012,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"To his intense disgust, he found his soul back in his body again, and"
5013,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that body spluttering and choking in deep water. The pain of the
5014,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"reunion was atrocious, but it was necessary, also, to fight for the"
5015,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"body. He was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand, and striding"
5016,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"prodigiously, as one strides in a dream, to keep foothold in the"
5017,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"swirling water, till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of"
5018,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the river, and dropped, panting, on wet earth."
5019,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5020,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Not this night,"" said Peroo in his ear. ""The Gods have protected us."""
5021,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The lascar moved his feet cautiously, and they rustled among dried"
5022,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stumps. ""This is some island of last year's indigo crop,"" he went on."
5023,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""We shall find no men here; but have great care, Sahib; all the snakes"
5024,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"of a hundred miles have been flooded out. Here comes the lightning, on"
5025,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the heels of the wind. Now we shall be able to look; but walk
5026,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"carefully."""
5027,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5028,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes, or indeed any"
5029,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"merely human emotion. He saw, after he had rubbed the water from his"
5030,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"eyes, with an immense clearness, and trod, so it seemed to himself,"
5031,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,with world-encompassing strides. Somewhere in the night of time he had
5032,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,built a bridge--a bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining
5033,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"seas; but the Deluge had swept it away, leaving this one island under"
5034,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"heaven for Findlayson and his companion, sole survivors of the breed"
5035,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,of man.
5036,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5037,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"An incessant lightning, forked and blue, showed all that there was to"
5038,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"be seen on the little patch in the flood--a clump of thorn, a clump of"
5039,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"swaying, creaking bamboos, and a gray, gnarled peepul over-shadowing a"
5040,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hindoo shrine, from whose dome floated a tattered red flag. The holy"
5041,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"man whose summer resting-place it was had long since abandoned it, and"
5042,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the weather had broken the red-daubed image of his God. The two men
5043,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"stumbled, heavy-limbed and heavy-eyed, over the ashes of a brick-set"
5044,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"cooking-place, and dropped down under the shelter of the branches,"
5045,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,while the rain and river roared together.
5046,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5047,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The stumps of the indigo crackled, and there was a smell of cattle, as"
5048,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,a huge and dripping Brahminee Bull shouldered his way under the tree.
5049,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The flashes revealed the trident mark of Shiva on his flank, the"
5050,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"insolence of head and hump, the luminous stag-like eyes, the brow"
5051,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap
5052,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that night swept the ground. There was a noise behind him of other
5053,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"beasts coming up from the flood-line through the thicket, a sound of"
5054,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,heavy feet and deep breathing.
5055,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5056,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Here be more beside ourselves,"" said Findlayson, his head against the"
5057,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"tree-pole, looking through half-shut eyes, wholly at ease."
5058,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5059,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Truly,"" said Peroo thickly, ""and no small ones."""
5060,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5061,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What are they, then? I do not see clearly."""
5062,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5063,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""The Gods. Who else? Look!"""
5064,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5065,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Ah, true! The Gods surely--the Gods."" Findlayson smiled as his head"
5066,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"fell forward on his chest. Peroo was eminently right. After the Flood,"
5067,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,who should be alive in the land except the Gods that made it--the Gods
5068,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,to whom his village prayed nightly--the Gods who were in all men's
5069,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,mouths and about all men's ways? He could not raise his head or stir a
5070,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"finger for the trance that held him, and Peroo was smiling vacantly at"
5071,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the lightning.
5072,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5073,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The Bull paused by the shrine, his head lowered to the damp earth. A"
5074,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,green Parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed
5075,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the
5076,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,shifting shadows of beasts. There was a Black-buck at the Bull's
5077,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,heels--such a buck as Findlayson in his far-away life upon earth might
5078,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"have seen in dreams--a buck with a royal head, ebon back, silver"
5079,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"belly, and gleaming straight horns. Beside him, her head bowed to the"
5080,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"ground, the green eyes burning under the heavy brows, with restless"
5081,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"tail switching the dead grass, paced a Tigress, full-bellied and"
5082,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,deep-jowled.
5083,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5084,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,The Bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness
5085,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"a monstrous gray Ape, who seated himself man-wise in the place of the"
5086,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"fallen image, and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his"
5087,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,neck and shoulders.
5088,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5089,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Other shadows came and went behind the circle, among them a drunken"
5090,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Man flourishing staff and drinking-bottle. Then a hoarse bellow broke
5091,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"out from near the ground. ""The flood lessens even now,"" it cried."
5092,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Hour by hour the water falls, and their bridge still stands!"""
5093,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5094,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""My bridge,"" said Findlayson to himself. ""That must be very old work"
5095,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"now. What have the Gods to do with my bridge?"""
5096,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5097,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,His eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar. A Crocodile--the
5098,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"blunt-nosed, ford-haunting Mugger of the Ganges--draggled herself"
5099,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"before the beasts, lashing furiously to right and left with her tail."
5100,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5101,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""They have made it too strong for me. In all this night I have only"
5102,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,torn away a handful of planks. The walls stand! The towers stand! They
5103,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"have chained my flood, and my river is not free any more. Heavenly"
5104,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Ones, take this yoke away! Give me clear water between bank and bank!"
5105,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"It is I, Mother Gunga, that speak. The Justice of the Gods! Deal me"
5106,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the Justice of the Gods!"""
5107,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5108,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""What said I?"" whispered Peroo. ""This is in truth a Punchayet of the"
5109,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Gods. Now we know that all the world is dead, save you and I, Sahib."""
5110,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5111,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The Parrot screamed and fluttered again, and the Tigress, her ears"
5112,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"flat to her head, snarled wickedly."
5113,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5114,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to
5115,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and fro, and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the"
5116,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,snarl.
5117,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5118,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""We be here,"" said a deep voice, ""the Great Ones. One only and very"
5119,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"many. Shiv, my father, is here, with Indra. Kali has spoken already."
5120,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Hanuman listens also."""
5121,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5122,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Kashi is without her Kotwal to-night,"" shouted the Man with the"
5123,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"drinking-bottle, flinging his staff to the ground, while the island"
5124,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"rang to the baying of hounds. ""Give her the Justice of the Gods."""
5125,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5126,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Ye were still when they polluted my waters,"" the great Crocodile"
5127,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"bellowed. ""Ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the"
5128,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"walls. I had no help save my own strength, and that failed--the"
5129,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,strength of Mother Gunga failed--before their guard-towers. What could
5130,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"I do? I have done everything. Finish now, Heavenly Ones!"""
5131,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5132,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I brought the death; I rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of"
5133,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"their workmen, and yet they would not cease."" A nose-slitten,"
5134,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"hide-worn Ass, lame, scissor-legged, and galled, limped forward. ""I"
5135,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"cast the death at them out of my nostrils, but they would not cease."""
5136,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5137,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Peroo would have moved, but the opium lay heavy upon him."
5138,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5139,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Bah!"" he said, spitting. ""Here is Sitala herself; Mata--the"
5140,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"small-pox. Has the Sahib a handkerchief to put over his face?"""
5141,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5142,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Small help! They fed me the corpses for a month, and I flung them"
5143,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"out on my sand-bars, but their work went forward! Demons they are, and"
5144,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,so sons of demons! And ye left Mother Gunga alone for their

5146,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"bridge-builders!"""
5147,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5148,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The Bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly, ""If the"

5150,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"would be many dark altars in the land, mother."""
5151,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5152,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""But this goes beyond a mock,"" said the Tigress, darting forward a"
5153,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"griping paw. ""Thou knowest, Shiv, and ye, too, Heavenly Ones; ye know"
5154,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that they have defiled Gunga. Surely they must come to the Destroyer.
5155,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Let Indra judge."""
5156,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5157,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"The Buck made no movement as he answered, ""How long has this evil"
5158,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"been?"""
5159,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,

5168,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,

5170,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,stood up above the dripping trees.
5171,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,

5597,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"galley where the rice is cooked, nor Bombay, nor Calcutta, nor even"
5598,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"London, will be any more for me. 'How shall I be sure,' I said, 'that"
5599,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"the Gods to whom I pray will abide at all?' This I thought, and the"
5600,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"_Rewah_ dropped her nose as a hammer falls, and all the sea came in"
5601,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and slid me backward along the fo'c'sle and over the break of the
5602,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"fo'c'sle, and I very badly bruised my shin against the donkey-engine:"
5603,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"but I did not die, and I have seen the Gods. They are good for live"
5604,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"men, but for the dead----They have spoken Themselves. Therefore, when"
5605,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,I come to the village I will beat the _guru_ for talking riddles which
5606,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"are no riddles. When Brahm ceases to dream, the Gods go."""
5607,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5608,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Look up-stream. The light blinds. Is there smoke yonder?"""
5609,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5610,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Peroo shaded his eyes with his hands. ""He is a wise man and quick."
5611,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Hitchcock Sahib would not trust a rowboat. He has borrowed the Rao
5612,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Sahib's steam-launch, and comes to look for us. I have always said"
5613,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,that there should have been a steam-launch on the bridge-works for
5614,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"us."""
5615,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5616,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,The territory of the Rao of Baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge;
5617,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,and Findlayson and Hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty
5618,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,leisure in playing billiards and shooting Black-buck with the young
5619,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,man. He had been bear-led by an English tutor of sporting tastes for
5620,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"some five or six years, and was now royally wasting the revenues"
5621,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,accumulated during his minority by the Indian Government. His
5622,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"steam-launch, with its silver-plated rails, striped silk awning, and"
5623,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"mahogany decks, was a new toy which Findlayson had found horribly in"
5624,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the way when the Rao came to look at the bridge-works.
5625,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5626,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""It's great luck,"" murmured Findlayson, but he was none the less"
5627,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"afraid, wondering what news might be of the bridge."
5628,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5629,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,The gaudy blue and white funnel came down-stream swiftly. They could
5630,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"see Hitchcock in the bows, with a pair of opera-glasses, and his face"
5631,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was unusually white. Then Peroo hailed, and the launch made for the"
5632,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"tail of the island. The Rao Sahib, in tweed shooting-suit and a"
5633,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"seven-hued turban, waved his royal hand, and Hitchcock shouted. But he"
5634,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"need have asked no questions, for Findlayson's first demand was for"
5635,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,his bridge.
5636,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5637,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""All serene! 'Gad, I never expected to see you again, Findlayson."
5638,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"You're seven koss down-stream. Yes, there's not a stone shifted"
5639,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"anywhere; but how are you? I borrowed the Rao Sahib's launch, and he"
5640,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was good enough to come along. Jump in."""
5641,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5642,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Ah, Finlinson, you are very well, eh? That was most unprecedented"
5643,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"calamity last night, eh? My royal palace, too, it leaks like the"
5644,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"devil, and the crops will also be short all about my country. Now you"
5645,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"shall back her out, Hitchcock. I--I do not understand steam-engines."
5646,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"You are wet? You are cold Finlinson? I have some things to eat here,"
5647,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"and you will take a good drink."""
5648,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5649,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""I'm immensely grateful, Rao Sahib. I believe you've saved my life."
5650,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"How did Hitchcock----"""
5651,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5652,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"""Oho! His hair was upon end. He rode to me in the middle of the night and"
5653,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"woke me up in the arms of Morphus. I was most truly concerned, Finlinson,"
5654,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"so I came too. My head-priest he is very angry just now. We will go quick,"
5655,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,Mister Hitchcock. I am due to attend at twelve-forty-five in the state
5656,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"temple, where we sanctify some new idol. If not so I would have asked you"
5657,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"to spend the day with me. They are dam-bore, these religious ceremonies,"
5658,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Finlinson, eh?"""
5659,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,
5660,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"Peroo, well known to the crew, had possessed himself of the wheel, and"
5661,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"was taking the launch craftily up-stream. But while he steered he was,"
5662,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,"in his mind, handling two feet of partially untwisted wire-rope; and"
5663,THE BRIDGE BUILDERS,the back upon which he beat was the back of his _guru_.

5693,THE MIRACLES,"Afar, I hailed the land at night--"

5696,THE MIRACLES,Had flashed my Love the word of me.
5697,THE MIRACLES,
5698,THE MIRACLES,Earth gave her chosen men of strength
5699,THE MIRACLES,(They lived and strove and died for me)

5704,THE MIRACLES,Too slow their fleetest flew for me--
5705,THE MIRACLES,"I tired twenty smoking steeds,"
5706,THE MIRACLES,And bade them bait a new for me.
5707,THE MIRACLES,
5708,THE MIRACLES,I sent the lightnings forth to see
5709,THE MIRACLES,Where hour by hour she waited me.
5710,THE MIRACLES,"Among ten million one was she,"
