165,"MY LORD,","The wishes and desires of all good men, which have attended your"
166,"MY LORD,","lordship from your first appearance in the world, are at length"
167,"MY LORD,","accomplished, from your obtaining those honours and dignities which you"
168,"MY LORD,","have so long deserved. There are no factions, though irreconcileable"
169,"MY LORD,","to one another, that are not united in their affection to you, and the"
170,"MY LORD,","respect they pay you. They are equally pleased in your prosperity, and"
171,"MY LORD,",would be equally concerned in your afflictions. Titus Vespasian was not
172,"MY LORD,",more the delight of human kind. The universal empire made him only more
173,"MY LORD,","known, and more powerful, but could not make him more beloved. He had"
174,"MY LORD,","greater ability of doing good, but your inclination to it is not less;"
175,"MY LORD,","and though you could not extend your beneficence to so many persons,"
176,"MY LORD,",yet you have lost as few days as that excellent emperor; and never had
177,"MY LORD,","his complaint to make when you went to bed, that the sun had shone upon"
178,"MY LORD,","you in vain, when you had the opportunity of relieving some unhappy"
179,"MY LORD,","man. This, my lord, has justly acquired you as many friends as there"
180,"MY LORD,",are persons who have the honour to be known to you. Mere acquaintance
181,"MY LORD,",you have none; you have drawn them all into a nearer line; and they
182,"MY LORD,",who have conversed with you are for ever after inviolably yours. This
183,"MY LORD,","is a truth so generally acknowledged, that it needs no proof: it is of"
184,"MY LORD,","the nature of a first principle, which is received as soon as it is"
185,"MY LORD,",proposed; and needs not the reformation which Descartes used to his;
186,"MY LORD,","for we doubt not, neither can we properly say, we think we admire and"
187,"MY LORD,","love you above all other men; there is a certainty in the proposition,"
188,"MY LORD,","and we know it. With the same assurance I can say, you neither have"
189,"MY LORD,","enemies, nor can scarce have any; for they who have never heard of you,"
190,"MY LORD,","can neither love or hate you; and they who have, can have no other"
191,"MY LORD,","notion of you, than that which they receive from the public, that you"
192,"MY LORD,","are the best of men. After this, my testimony can be of no farther use,"
193,"MY LORD,",than to declare it to be day-light at high-noon; and all who have the
194,"MY LORD,","benefit of sight, can look up as well, and see the sun."
195,"MY LORD,",
196,"MY LORD,","It is true, I have one privilege which is almost particular to myself,"
197,"MY LORD,",that I saw you in the east at your first arising above the hemisphere:
198,"MY LORD,","I was as soon sensible as any man of that light, when it was but just"
199,"MY LORD,","shooting out, and beginning to travel upwards to the meridian. I made"
200,"MY LORD,","my early addresses to your lordship, in my ""Essay of Dramatic Poetry;"""
201,"MY LORD,","and therein bespoke you to the world, wherein I have the right of a"
202,"MY LORD,","first discoverer.[2] When I was myself in the rudiments of my poetry,"
203,"MY LORD,","without name or reputation in the world, having rather the ambition of"
204,"MY LORD,","a writer, than the skill; when I was drawing the outlines of an art,"
205,"MY LORD,",without any living master to instruct me in it; an art which had been
206,"MY LORD,","better praised than studied here in England, wherein Shakespeare, who"
207,"MY LORD,","created the stage among us, had rather written happily, than knowingly"
208,"MY LORD,","and justly, and Jonson, who, by studying Horace, had been acquainted"
209,"MY LORD,","with the rules, yet seemed to envy to posterity that knowledge,"
210,"MY LORD,","and, like an inventor of some useful art, to make a monopoly of his"
211,"MY LORD,","learning; when thus, as I may say, before the use of the load-stone, or"
212,"MY LORD,","knowledge of the compass, I was sailing in a vast ocean, without other"
213,"MY LORD,","help than the pole-star of the ancients, and the rules of the French"
214,"MY LORD,","stage amongst the moderns, which are extremely different from ours, by"
215,"MY LORD,","reason of their opposite taste; yet even then, I had the presumption to"
216,"MY LORD,","dedicate to your lordship--a very unfinished piece, I must confess, and"
217,"MY LORD,","which only can be excused by the little experience of the author, and"
218,"MY LORD,","the modesty of the title--""An Essay."" Yet I was stronger in prophecy"
219,"MY LORD,","than I was in criticism; I was inspired to foretell you to mankind, as"
220,"MY LORD,","the restorer of poetry, the greatest genius, the truest judge, and the"
221,"MY LORD,",best patron.
222,"MY LORD,",
223,"MY LORD,","Good sense and good nature are never separated, though the ignorant"
224,"MY LORD,","world has thought otherwise. Good nature, by which I mean beneficence"
225,"MY LORD,","and candour, is the product of right reason; which of necessity will"
226,"MY LORD,","give allowance to the failings of others, by considering that there"
227,"MY LORD,",is nothing perfect in mankind; and by distinguishing that which comes
228,"MY LORD,","nearest to excellency, though not absolutely free from faults, will"
229,"MY LORD,",certainly produce a candour in the judge. It is incident to an elevated
230,"MY LORD,","understanding, like your lordship's, to find out the errors of other"
231,"MY LORD,",men; but it is your prerogative to pardon them; to look with pleasure
232,"MY LORD,","on those things, which are somewhat congenial, and of a remote kindred"
233,"MY LORD,","to your own conceptions; and to forgive the many failings of those,"
234,"MY LORD,","who, with their wretched art, cannot arrive to those heights that you"
235,"MY LORD,","possess, from a happy, abundant, and native genius: which are as inborn"
236,"MY LORD,","to you, as they were to Shakespeare; and, for aught I know, to Homer;"
237,"MY LORD,","in either of whom we find all arts and sciences, all moral and natural"
238,"MY LORD,","philosophy, without knowing that they ever studied them."
239,"MY LORD,",
240,"MY LORD,","There is not an English writer this day living, who is not perfectly"
241,"MY LORD,","convinced, that your lordship excels all others in all the several"
242,"MY LORD,","parts of poetry which you have undertaken to adorn. The most vain,"
243,"MY LORD,","and the most ambitious of our age, have not dared to assume so much,"
244,"MY LORD,",as the competitors of Themistocles: they have yielded the first place
245,"MY LORD,",without dispute; and have been arrogantly content to be esteemed as
246,"MY LORD,","second to your lordship; and even that also, with a _longo, sed proximi"
247,"MY LORD,","intervallo_. If there have been, or are any, who go farther in their"
248,"MY LORD,","self-conceit, they must be very singular in their opinion; they must"
249,"MY LORD,","be like the officer in a play, who was called Captain, Lieutenant,"
250,"MY LORD,","and Company. The world will easily conclude, whether such unattended"
251,"MY LORD,",generals can ever be capable of making a revolution in Parnassus.
252,"MY LORD,",
253,"MY LORD,","I will not attempt, in this place, to say any thing particular of"
254,"MY LORD,","your Lyric Poems, though they are the delight and wonder of this"
255,"MY LORD,","age, and will be the envy of the next.[3] The subject of this book"
256,"MY LORD,","confines me to satire; and in that, an author of your own quality,"
257,"MY LORD,","(whose ashes I will not disturb,) has given you all the commendation"
258,"MY LORD,","which his self-sufficiency could afford to any man: ""The best good"
259,"MY LORD,","man, with the worst-natured muse.""[4] In that character, methinks, I"
260,"MY LORD,","am reading Jonson's verses to the memory of Shakespeare; an insolent,"
261,"MY LORD,","sparing, and invidious panegyric: where good nature, the most godlike"
262,"MY LORD,","commendation of a man, is only attributed to your person, and denied"
263,"MY LORD,","to your writings; for they are every where so full of candour, that,"
264,"MY LORD,","like Horace, you only expose the follies of men, without arraigning"
265,"MY LORD,","their vices; and in this excel him, that you add that pointedness of"
266,"MY LORD,","thought, which is visibly wanting in our great Roman. There is more of"
267,"MY LORD,","salt in all your verses, than I have seen in any of the moderns, or"
268,"MY LORD,","even of the ancients; but you have been sparing of the gall, by which"
269,"MY LORD,","means you have pleased all readers, and offended none. Donne alone,"
270,"MY LORD,","of all our countrymen, had your talent; but was not happy enough to"
271,"MY LORD,","arrive at your versification; and were he translated into numbers,"
272,"MY LORD,","and English, he would yet be wanting in the dignity of expression."
273,"MY LORD,","That which is the prime virtue, and chief ornament, of Virgil, which"
274,"MY LORD,","distinguishes him from the rest of writers, is so conspicuous in your"
275,"MY LORD,","verses, that it casts a shadow on all your contemporaries; we cannot"
276,"MY LORD,","be seen, or but obscurely, while you are present. You equal Donne in"
277,"MY LORD,","the variety, multiplicity, and choice of thoughts; you excel him in"
278,"MY LORD,","the manner and the words. I read you both with the same admiration,"
279,"MY LORD,","but not with the same delight. He affects the metaphysics, not only"
280,"MY LORD,","in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should"
281,"MY LORD,",reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations
282,"MY LORD,","of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them"
283,"MY LORD,",with the softnesses of love. In this (if I may be pardoned for so bold
284,"MY LORD,","a truth) Mr Cowley has copied him to a fault; so great a one, in my"
285,"MY LORD,","opinion, that it throws his Mistress infinitely below his Pindarics,"
286,"MY LORD,","and his latter compositions, which are undoubtedly the best of his"
287,"MY LORD,","poems, and the most correct. For my own part, I must avow it freely to"
288,"MY LORD,","the world, that I never attempted any thing in satire, wherein I have"
289,"MY LORD,",not studied your writings as the most perfect model. I have continually
290,"MY LORD,","laid them before me; and the greatest commendation, which my own"
291,"MY LORD,","partiality can give to my productions, is, that they are copies, and no"
292,"MY LORD,","farther to be allowed, than as they have something more or less of the"
293,"MY LORD,","original. Some few touches of your lordship, some secret graces which"
294,"MY LORD,","I have endeavoured to express after your manner, have made whole poems"
295,"MY LORD,","of mine to pass with approbation; but take your verses altogether,"
296,"MY LORD,","and they are inimitable. If therefore I have not written better, it"
297,"MY LORD,",is because you have not written more. You have not set me sufficient
298,"MY LORD,","copy to transcribe; and I cannot add one letter of my own invention, of"
299,"MY LORD,",which I have not the example there.
300,"MY LORD,",
301,"MY LORD,","It is a general complaint against your lordship, and I must have leave"
302,"MY LORD,","to upbraid you with it, that, because you need not write, you will"
303,"MY LORD,","not. Mankind, that wishes you so well in all things that relate to"
304,"MY LORD,","your prosperity, have their intervals of wishing for themselves, and"
305,"MY LORD,",are within a little of grudging you the fulness of your fortune: they
306,"MY LORD,","would be more malicious if you used it not so well, and with so much"
307,"MY LORD,",generosity.
308,"MY LORD,",
309,"MY LORD,","Fame is in itself a real good, if we may believe Cicero, who was"
310,"MY LORD,","perhaps too fond of it; but even fame, as Virgil tells us, acquires"
311,"MY LORD,",strength by going forward. Let Epicurus give indolency as an attribute
312,"MY LORD,","to his gods, and place in it the happiness of the blest; the divinity"
313,"MY LORD,","which we worship has given us not only a precept against it, but his"
314,"MY LORD,","own example to the contrary. The world, my lord, would be content to"
315,"MY LORD,","allow you a seventh day for rest; or if you thought that hard upon you,"
316,"MY LORD,","we would not refuse you half your time: if you came out, like some"
317,"MY LORD,","great monarch, to take a town but once a year, as it were for your"
318,"MY LORD,","diversion, though you had no need to extend your territories. In short,"
319,"MY LORD,","if you were a bad, or, which is worse, an indifferent poet, we would"
320,"MY LORD,","thank you for our own quiet, and not expose you to the want of yours."
321,"MY LORD,","But when you are so great and so successful, and when we have that"
322,"MY LORD,","necessity of your writing, that we cannot subsist entirely without it,"
323,"MY LORD,",any more (I may almost say) than the world without the daily course of
324,"MY LORD,","ordinary providence, methinks this argument might prevail with you, my"
325,"MY LORD,","lord, to forego a little of your repose for the public benefit. It is"
326,"MY LORD,","not that you are under any force of working daily miracles, to prove"
327,"MY LORD,","your being; but now and then somewhat of extraordinary, that is, any"
328,"MY LORD,","thing of your production, is requisite to refresh your character."
329,"MY LORD,",
330,"MY LORD,","This, I think, my lord, is a sufficient reproach to you; and should I"
331,"MY LORD,","carry it as far as mankind would authorise me, would be little less"
332,"MY LORD,","than satire. And, indeed, a provocation is almost necessary, in behalf"
333,"MY LORD,","of the world, that you might be induced sometimes to write; and in"
334,"MY LORD,","relation to a multitude of scribblers, who daily pester the world with"
335,"MY LORD,","their insufferable stuff, that they might be discouraged from writing"
336,"MY LORD,","any more. I complain not of their lampoons and libels, though I have"
337,"MY LORD,",been the public mark for many years. I am vindictive enough to have
338,"MY LORD,","repelled force by force, if I could imagine that any of them had ever"
339,"MY LORD,","reached me; but they either shot at rovers,[5] and therefore missed,"
340,"MY LORD,","or their powder was so weak, that I might safely stand them, at the"
341,"MY LORD,","nearest distance. I answered not the ""Rehearsal,"" because I knew the"
342,"MY LORD,","author sat to himself when he drew the picture, and was the very Bayes"
343,"MY LORD,","of his own farce: because also I knew, that my betters[6] were more"
344,"MY LORD,","concerned than I was in that satire: and, lastly, because Mr Smith and"
345,"MY LORD,","Mr Johnson, the main pillars of it, were two such languishing gentlemen"
346,"MY LORD,","in their conversation, that I could liken them to nothing but to their"
347,"MY LORD,","own relations, those noble characters of men of wit and pleasure about"
348,"MY LORD,",the town. The like considerations have hindered me from dealing with
349,"MY LORD,",the lamentable companions of their prose and doggrel. I am so far from
350,"MY LORD,","defending my poetry against them, that I will not so much as expose"
351,"MY LORD,","theirs. And for my morals, if they are not proof against their attacks,"
352,"MY LORD,","let me be thought by posterity, what those authors would be thought,"
353,"MY LORD,","if any memory of them, or of their writings, could endure so long as"
354,"MY LORD,","to another age. But these dull makers of lampoons, as harmless as they"
355,"MY LORD,","have been to me, are yet of dangerous example to the public. Some"
356,"MY LORD,","witty men may perhaps succeed to their designs, and, mixing sense with"
357,"MY LORD,","malice, blast the reputation of the most innocent amongst men, and the"
358,"MY LORD,",most virtuous amongst women.
359,"MY LORD,",
360,"MY LORD,","Heaven be praised, our common libellers are as free from the imputation"
361,"MY LORD,",of wit as of morality; and therefore whatever mischief they have
362,"MY LORD,","designed, they have performed but little of it. Yet these ill writers,"
363,"MY LORD,","in all justice, ought themselves to be exposed; as Persius has given us"
364,"MY LORD,","a fair example in his first satire, which is levelled particularly at"
365,"MY LORD,","them;[7] and none is so fit to correct their faults, as he who is not"
366,"MY LORD,","only clear from any in his own writings, but is also so just, that he"
367,"MY LORD,","will never defame the good; and is armed with the power of verse, to"
368,"MY LORD,",punish and make examples of the bad. But of this I shall have occasion
369,"MY LORD,","to speak further, when I come to give the definition and character of"
370,"MY LORD,",true satires.
371,"MY LORD,",
372,"MY LORD,","In the mean time, as a counsellor bred up in the knowledge of the"
373,"MY LORD,","municipal and statute laws, may honestly inform a just prince how far"
374,"MY LORD,","his prerogative extends; so I may be allowed to tell your lordship,"
375,"MY LORD,","who, by an undisputed title, are the king of poets, what an extent of"
376,"MY LORD,","power you have, and how lawfully you may exercise it, over the petulant"
377,"MY LORD,","scribblers of this age. As lord chamberlain, I know, you are absolute"
378,"MY LORD,","by your office, in all that belongs to the decency and good manners"
379,"MY LORD,","of the stage. You can banish from thence scurrility and profaneness,"
380,"MY LORD,","and restrain the licentious insolence of poets, and their actors, in"
381,"MY LORD,","all things that shock the public quiet, or the reputation of private"
382,"MY LORD,","persons, under the notion of humour. But I mean not the authority,"
383,"MY LORD,",which is annexed to your office; I speak of that only which is inborn
384,"MY LORD,",and inherent to your person; what is produced in you by an excellent
385,"MY LORD,","wit, a masterly and commanding genius over all writers: whereby you"
386,"MY LORD,","are empowered, when you please, to give the final decision of wit; to"
387,"MY LORD,",put your stamp on all that ought to pass for current; and set a brand
388,"MY LORD,","of reprobation on clipped poetry, and false coin. A shilling dipped"
389,"MY LORD,","in the Bath may go for gold amongst the ignorant, but the sceptres on"
390,"MY LORD,",the guineas show the difference.[8] That your lordship is formed by
391,"MY LORD,","nature for this supremacy, I could easily prove, (were it not already"
392,"MY LORD,","granted by the world,) from the distinguishing character of your"
393,"MY LORD,","writing: which is so visible to me, that I never could be imposed on"
394,"MY LORD,","to receive for yours, what was written by any others; or to mistake"
395,"MY LORD,","your genuine poetry for their spurious productions. I can farther add,"
396,"MY LORD,","with truth, (though not without some vanity in saying it,) that in the"
397,"MY LORD,","same paper, written by divers hands, whereof your lordship's was only"
398,"MY LORD,","part, I could separate your gold from their copper; and though I could"
399,"MY LORD,","not give back to every author his own brass, (for there is not the"
400,"MY LORD,","same rule for distinguishing betwixt bad and bad, as betwixt ill and"
401,"MY LORD,","excellently good,) yet I never failed of knowing what was yours, and"
402,"MY LORD,","what was not; and was absolutely certain, that this, or the other part,"
403,"MY LORD,","was positively yours, and could not possibly be written by any other."
404,"MY LORD,",
405,"MY LORD,","True it is, that some bad poems, though not all, carry their owners'"
406,"MY LORD,","marks about them. There is some peculiar awkwardness, false grammar,"
407,"MY LORD,","imperfect sense, or, at the least, obscurity; some brand or other on"
408,"MY LORD,","this buttock, or that ear, that it is notorious who are the owners of"
409,"MY LORD,","the cattle, though they should not sign it with their names. But your"
410,"MY LORD,","lordship, on the contrary, is distinguished, not only by the excellency"
411,"MY LORD,","of your thoughts, but by your style and manner of expressing them. A"
412,"MY LORD,","painter, judging of some admirable piece, may affirm, with certainty,"
413,"MY LORD,","that it was of Holbein, or Vandyck; but vulgar designs, and common"
414,"MY LORD,","draughts, are easily mistaken, and misapplied. Thus, by my long study"
415,"MY LORD,","of your lordship, I am arrived at the knowledge of your particular"
416,"MY LORD,","manner. In the good poems of other men, like those artists, I can only"
417,"MY LORD,","say, this is like the draught of such a one, or like the colouring"
418,"MY LORD,","of another. In short, I can only be sure, that it is the hand of a"
419,"MY LORD,","good master; but in your performances, it is scarcely possible for me"
420,"MY LORD,","to be deceived. If you write in your strength, you stand revealed at"
421,"MY LORD,","the first view; and should you write under it, you cannot avoid some"
422,"MY LORD,","peculiar graces, which only cost me a second consideration to discover"
423,"MY LORD,","you: for I may say it, with all the severity of truth, that every line"
424,"MY LORD,","of yours is precious. Your lordship's only fault is, that you have not"
425,"MY LORD,","written more; unless I could add another, and that yet greater, but I"
426,"MY LORD,","fear for the public the accusation would not be true,--that you have"
427,"MY LORD,","written, and out of a vicious modesty will not publish."
428,"MY LORD,",
429,"MY LORD,",Virgil has confined his works within the compass of eighteen thousand
430,"MY LORD,","lines, and has not treated many subjects; yet he ever had, and ever"
431,"MY LORD,","will have, the reputation of the best poet. Martial says of him, that"
432,"MY LORD,","he could have excelled Varius in tragedy, and Horace in lyric poetry,"
433,"MY LORD,","but out of deference to his friends, he attempted neither.[9]"
434,"MY LORD,",
435,"MY LORD,","The same prevalence of genius is in your lordship, but the world cannot"
436,"MY LORD,",pardon your concealing it on the same consideration; because we have
437,"MY LORD,","neither a living Varius, nor a Horace, in whose excellencies, both of"
438,"MY LORD,","poems, odes, and satires, you had equalled them, if our language had"
439,"MY LORD,","not yielded to the Roman majesty, and length of time had not added a"
440,"MY LORD,",reverence to the works of Horace. For good sense is the same in all or
441,"MY LORD,","most ages; and course of time rather improves nature, than impairs her."
442,"MY LORD,","What has been, may be again: another Homer, and another Virgil, may"
443,"MY LORD,",possibly arise from those very causes which produced the first; though
444,"MY LORD,","it would be impudence to affirm, that any such have yet appeared."
445,"MY LORD,",
446,"MY LORD,","It is manifest, that some particular ages have been more happy than"
447,"MY LORD,","others in the production of great men, in all sorts of arts and"
448,"MY LORD,","sciences; as that of Euripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes, and the rest,"
449,"MY LORD,","for stage poetry amongst the Greeks; that of Augustus, for heroic,"
450,"MY LORD,","lyric, dramatic, elegiac, and indeed all sorts of poetry, in the"
451,"MY LORD,","persons of Virgil, Horace, Varius, Ovid, and many others; especially"
452,"MY LORD,","if we take into that century the latter end of the commonwealth,"
453,"MY LORD,","wherein we find Varo, Lucretius, and Catullus; and at the same time"
454,"MY LORD,","lived Cicero, and Sallust, and Cæsar. A famous age in modern times, for"
455,"MY LORD,","learning in every kind, was that of Lorenzo de Medici, and his son Leo"
456,"MY LORD,","the Tenth; wherein painting was revived, and poetry flourished, and the"
457,"MY LORD,",Greek language was restored.
458,"MY LORD,",
459,"MY LORD,",Examples in all these are obvious: but what I would infer is this;
460,"MY LORD,","that in such an age, it is possible some great genius may arise, to"
461,"MY LORD,",equal any of the ancients; abating only for the language. For great
462,"MY LORD,","contemporaries whet and cultivate each other; and mutual borrowing, and"
463,"MY LORD,","commerce, makes the common riches of learning, as it does of the civil"
464,"MY LORD,",government.
465,"MY LORD,",
466,"MY LORD,","But suppose that Homer and Virgil were the only of their species, and"
467,"MY LORD,","that nature was so much worn out in producing them, that she is never"
468,"MY LORD,","able to bear the like again, yet the example only holds in heroic"
469,"MY LORD,","poetry: in tragedy and satire, I offer myself to maintain against some"
470,"MY LORD,","of our modern critics, that this age and the last, particularly in"
471,"MY LORD,","England, have excelled the ancients in both those kinds; and I would"
472,"MY LORD,","instance in Shakespeare of the former, of your lordship in the latter"
473,"MY LORD,",sort.[10]
474,"MY LORD,",
475,"MY LORD,",Thus I might safely confine myself to my native country; but if I
476,"MY LORD,","would only cross the seas, I might find in France a living Horace and"
477,"MY LORD,","a Juvenal, in the person of the admirable Boileau; whose numbers are"
478,"MY LORD,","excellent, whose expressions are noble, whose thoughts are just, whose"
479,"MY LORD,","language is pure, whose satire is pointed, and whose sense is close;"
480,"MY LORD,","what he borrows from the ancients, he repays with usury of his own,"
481,"MY LORD,","in coin as good, and almost as universally valuable: for, setting"
482,"MY LORD,","prejudice and partiality apart, though he is our enemy, the stamp of a"
483,"MY LORD,","Louis, the patron of all arts, is not much inferior to the medal of an"
484,"MY LORD,",Augustus Cæsar. Let this be said without entering into the interests of
485,"MY LORD,","factions and parties, and relating only to the bounty of that king to"
486,"MY LORD,","men of learning and merit; a praise so just, that even we, who are his"
487,"MY LORD,","enemies, cannot refuse it to him."
488,"MY LORD,",
489,"MY LORD,",Now if it may be permitted me to go back again to the consideration of
490,"MY LORD,","epic poetry, I have confessed, that no man hitherto has reached, or"
491,"MY LORD,","so much as approached, to the excellencies of Homer, or of Virgil; I"
492,"MY LORD,","must farther add, that Statius, the best versificator next to Virgil,"
493,"MY LORD,","knew not how to design after him, though he had the model in his eye;"
494,"MY LORD,","that Lucan is wanting both in design and subject, and is besides too"
495,"MY LORD,","full of heat and affectation; that amongst the moderns, Ariosto neither"
496,"MY LORD,","designed justly, nor observed any unity of action, or compass of time,"
497,"MY LORD,","or moderation in the vastness of his draught: his style is luxurious,"
498,"MY LORD,","without majesty or decency, and his adventures without the compass"
499,"MY LORD,","of nature and possibility. Tasso, whose design was regular, and who"
500,"MY LORD,","observed the rules of unity in time and place more closely than Virgil,"
501,"MY LORD,",yet was not so happy in his action; he confesses himself to have been
502,"MY LORD,","too lyrical, that is, to have written beneath the dignity of heroic"
503,"MY LORD,","verse, in his Episodes of Sophronia, Erminia, and Armida. His story"
504,"MY LORD,","is not so pleasing as Ariosto's; he is too flatulent sometimes, and"
505,"MY LORD,","sometimes too dry; many times unequal, and almost always forced; and,"
506,"MY LORD,","besides, is full of conceipts, points of epigram, and witticisms; all"
507,"MY LORD,","which are not only below the dignity of heroic verse, but contrary"
508,"MY LORD,",to its nature: Virgil and Homer have not one of them. And those who
509,"MY LORD,","are guilty of so boyish an ambition in so grave a subject, are so far"
510,"MY LORD,","from being considered as heroic poets, that they ought to be turned"
511,"MY LORD,","down from Homer to the Anthologia, from Virgil to Martial and Owen's"
512,"MY LORD,","Epigrams, and from Spenser to Flecno; that is, from the top to the"
513,"MY LORD,",bottom of all poetry. But to return to Tasso: he borrows from the
514,"MY LORD,","invention of Boiardo, and in his alteration of his poem, which is"
515,"MY LORD,","infinitely for the worse, imitates Homer so very servilely, that (for"
516,"MY LORD,","example) he gives the king of Jerusalem fifty sons, only because Homer"
517,"MY LORD,",had bestowed the like number on king Priam; he kills the youngest in
518,"MY LORD,","the same manner, and has provided his hero with a Patroclus, under"
519,"MY LORD,","another name, only to bring him back to the wars, when his friend"
520,"MY LORD,",was killed.[11] The French have performed nothing in this kind which
521,"MY LORD,","is not far below those two Italians, and subject to a thousand more"
522,"MY LORD,","reflections, without examining their St Lewis, their Pucelle, or their"
523,"MY LORD,","Alarique.[12] The English have only to boast of Spenser and Milton, who"
524,"MY LORD,",neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect
525,"MY LORD,","poets, and yet both of them are liable to many censures. For there is"
526,"MY LORD,",no uniformity in the design of Spenser: he aims at the accomplishment
527,"MY LORD,",of no one action; he raises up a hero for every one of his adventures;
528,"MY LORD,","and endows each of them with some particular moral virtue, which"
529,"MY LORD,","renders them all equal, without subordination, or preference. Every one"
530,"MY LORD,",is most valiant in his own legend: only we must do him that justice to
531,"MY LORD,","observe, that magnanimity, which is the character of Prince Arthur,"
532,"MY LORD,","shines throughout the whole poem; and succours the rest, when they are"
533,"MY LORD,",in distress. The original of every knight was then living in the court
534,"MY LORD,","of Queen Elizabeth; and he attributed to each of them that virtue,"
535,"MY LORD,",which he thought was most conspicuous in them; an ingenious piece of
536,"MY LORD,","flattery, though it turned not much to his account. Had he lived to"
537,"MY LORD,","finish his poem, in the six remaining legends, it had certainly been"
538,"MY LORD,","more of a piece; but could not have been perfect, because the model was"
539,"MY LORD,","not true. But Prince Arthur, or his chief patron Sir Philip Sydney,"
540,"MY LORD,","whom he intended to make happy by the marriage of his Gloriana, dying"
541,"MY LORD,","before him, deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish"
542,"MY LORD,","his design.[13] For the rest, his obsolete language,[14] and the ill"
543,"MY LORD,","choice of his stanza, are faults but of the second magnitude; for,"
544,"MY LORD,","notwithstanding the first, he is still intelligible, at least after"
545,"MY LORD,","a little practice; and for the last, he is the more to be admired,"
546,"MY LORD,","that, labouring under such a difficulty, his verses are so numerous,"
547,"MY LORD,","so various, and so harmonious, that only Virgil, whom he professedly"
548,"MY LORD,","imitated, has surpassed him among the Romans; and only Mr Waller among"
549,"MY LORD,",the English.
550,"MY LORD,",
551,"MY LORD,","As for Mr Milton, whom we all admire with so much justice, his subject"
552,"MY LORD,","is not that of an heroic poem, properly so called. His design is the"
553,"MY LORD,","losing of our happiness; his event is not prosperous, like that of all"
554,"MY LORD,","other epic works; his heavenly machines are many, and his human persons"
555,"MY LORD,",are but two. But I will not take Mr Rymer's work out of his hands: he
556,"MY LORD,","has promised the world a critique on that author;[15] wherein, though"
557,"MY LORD,","he will not allow his poem for heroic, I hope he will grant us, that"
558,"MY LORD,","his thoughts are elevated, his words sounding, and that no man has so"
559,"MY LORD,","happily copied the manner of Homer, or so copiously translated his"
560,"MY LORD,","Grecisms, and the Latin elegancies of Virgil. It is true, he runs into"
561,"MY LORD,","a flat of thought, sometimes for a hundred lines together, but it is"
562,"MY LORD,",when he has got into a track of scripture. His antiquated words were
563,"MY LORD,","his choice, not his necessity; for therein he imitated Spenser, as"
564,"MY LORD,","Spenser did Chaucer. And though, perhaps, the love of their masters may"
565,"MY LORD,","have transported both too far, in the frequent use of them, yet, in"
566,"MY LORD,","my opinion, obsolete words may then be laudably revived, when either"
567,"MY LORD,","they are more sounding, or more significant, than those in practice;"
568,"MY LORD,","and when their obscurity is taken away, by joining other words to"
569,"MY LORD,","them, which clear the sense; according to the rule of Horace, for"
570,"MY LORD,",the admission of new words.[16] But in both cases a moderation is
571,"MY LORD,","to be observed in the use of them: for unnecessary coinage, as well"
572,"MY LORD,","as unnecessary revival, runs into affectation; a fault to be avoided"
573,"MY LORD,","on either hand. Neither will I justify Milton for his blank verse,"
574,"MY LORD,","though I may excuse him, by the example of Hannibal Caro, and other"
575,"MY LORD,","Italians, who have used it; for whatever causes he alleges for the"
576,"MY LORD,","abolishing of rhyme, (which I have not now the leisure to examine,) his"
577,"MY LORD,","own particular reason is plainly this, that rhyme was not his talent;"
578,"MY LORD,","he had neither the ease of doing it, nor the graces of it; which is"
579,"MY LORD,","manifest in his ""Juvenilia,"" or verses written in his youth, where his"
580,"MY LORD,","rhyme is always constrained and forced, and comes hardly from him, at"
581,"MY LORD,","an age when the soul is most pliant, and the passion of love makes"
582,"MY LORD,","almost every man a rhymer, though not a poet."
583,"MY LORD,",
584,"MY LORD,","By this time, my lord, I doubt not but that you wonder, why I have run"
585,"MY LORD,","off from my bias so long together, and made so tedious a digression"
586,"MY LORD,","from satire to heroic poetry. But if you will not excuse it, by the"
587,"MY LORD,","tattling quality of age, which, as Sir William D'Avenant says, is"
588,"MY LORD,","always narrative, yet I hope the usefulness of what I have to say on"
589,"MY LORD,",this subject will qualify the remoteness of it; and this is the last
590,"MY LORD,","time I will commit the crime of prefaces, or trouble the world with my"
591,"MY LORD,","notions of any thing that relates to verse.[17] I have then, as you"
592,"MY LORD,","see, observed the failings of many great wits amongst the moderns,"
593,"MY LORD,","who have attempted to write an epic poem. Besides these, or the like"
594,"MY LORD,","animadversions of them by other men, there is yet a farther reason"
595,"MY LORD,","given, why they cannot possibly succeed so well as the ancients,"
596,"MY LORD,","even though we could allow them not to be inferior, either in genius"
597,"MY LORD,","or learning, or the tongue in which they write, or all those other"
598,"MY LORD,",wonderful qualifications which are necessary to the forming of a true
599,"MY LORD,","accomplished heroic poet. The fault is laid on our religion; they say,"
600,"MY LORD,",that Christianity is not capable of those embellishments which are
601,"MY LORD,",afforded in the belief of those ancient heathens.
602,"MY LORD,",
603,"MY LORD,","And it is true, that, in the severe notions of our faith, the fortitude"
604,"MY LORD,","of a Christian consists in patience, and suffering, for the love of"
605,"MY LORD,","God, whatever hardships can befall in the world; not in any great"
606,"MY LORD,","attempts, or in performance of those enterprizes which the poets call"
607,"MY LORD,","heroic, and which are commonly the effects of interest, ostentation,"
608,"MY LORD,","pride, and worldly honour: that humility and resignation are our prime"
609,"MY LORD,","virtues; and that these include no action, but that of the soul;"
610,"MY LORD,","when as, on the contrary, an heroic poem requires to its necessary"
611,"MY LORD,","design, and as its last perfection, some great action of war, the"
612,"MY LORD,",accomplishment of some extraordinary undertaking; which requires the
613,"MY LORD,","strength and vigour of the body, the duty of a soldier, the capacity"
614,"MY LORD,","and prudence of a general, and, in short, as much, or more, of the"
615,"MY LORD,","active virtue, than the suffering. But to this the answer is very"
616,"MY LORD,",obvious. God has placed us in our several stations; the virtues of
617,"MY LORD,","a private Christian are patience, obedience, submission, and the"
618,"MY LORD,","like; but those of a magistrate, or general, or a king, are prudence,"
619,"MY LORD,","counsel, active fortitude, coercive power, awful command, and the"
620,"MY LORD,","exercise of magnanimity, as well as justice. So that this objection"
621,"MY LORD,","hinders not, but that an epic poem, or the heroic action of some great"
622,"MY LORD,","commander, enterprized for the common good, and honour of the Christian"
623,"MY LORD,","cause, and executed happily, may be as well written now, as it was of"
624,"MY LORD,",old by the heathens; provided the poet be endued with the same talents;
625,"MY LORD,","and the language, though not of equal dignity, yet as near approaching"
626,"MY LORD,","to it, as our modern barbarism will allow; which is all that can be"
627,"MY LORD,","expected from our own, or any other now extant, though more refined;"
628,"MY LORD,","and therefore we are to rest contented with that only inferiority,"
629,"MY LORD,",which is not possibly to be remedied.
630,"MY LORD,",
631,"MY LORD,",I wish I could as easily remove that other difficulty which yet
632,"MY LORD,","remains. It is objected by a great French critic, as well as an"
633,"MY LORD,","admirable poet, yet living, and whom I have mentioned with that honour"
634,"MY LORD,","which his merit exacts from me, I mean Boileau, that the machines"
635,"MY LORD,","of our Christian religion, in heroic poetry, are much more feeble"
636,"MY LORD,","to support that weight than those of heathenism. Their doctrine,"
637,"MY LORD,","grounded as it was on ridiculous fables, was yet the belief of the"
638,"MY LORD,","two victorious monarchies, the Grecian and Roman. Their gods did not"
639,"MY LORD,","only interest themselves in the event of wars, (which is the effect of"
640,"MY LORD,","a superior providence,) but also espoused the several parties, in a"
641,"MY LORD,","visible corporeal descent, managed their intrigues, and fought their"
642,"MY LORD,",battles sometimes in opposition to each other: though Virgil (more
643,"MY LORD,",discreet than Homer in that last particular) has contented himself
644,"MY LORD,","with the partiality of his deities, their favours, their counsels or"
645,"MY LORD,","commands, to those whose cause they had espoused, without bringing them"
646,"MY LORD,","to the outrageousness of blows. Now, our religion (says he) is deprived"
647,"MY LORD,",of the greatest part of those machines; at least the most shining
648,"MY LORD,","in epic poetry. Though St Michael, in Ariosto, seeks out Discord,"
649,"MY LORD,","to send her among the Pagans, and finds her in a convent of friars,"
650,"MY LORD,","where peace should reign, which indeed is fine satire; and Satan, in"
651,"MY LORD,","Tasso, excites Solyman to an attempt by night on the Christian camp,"
652,"MY LORD,","and brings an host of devils to his assistance; yet the archangel, in"
653,"MY LORD,","the former example, when Discord was restive, and would not be drawn"
654,"MY LORD,","from her beloved monastery with fair words, has the whip-hand of her,"
655,"MY LORD,","drags her out with many stripes, sets her, on God's name, about her"
656,"MY LORD,","business, and makes her know the difference of strength betwixt a"
657,"MY LORD,","nuncio of heaven, and a minister of hell. The same angel, in the latter"
658,"MY LORD,","instance from Tasso, (as if God had never another messenger belonging"
659,"MY LORD,","to the court, but was confined like Jupiter to Mercury, and Juno to"
660,"MY LORD,","Iris,) when he sees his time, that is, when half of the Christians"
661,"MY LORD,","are already killed, and all the rest are in a fair way to be routed,"
662,"MY LORD,","stickles betwixt the remainders of God's host, and the race of fiends;"
663,"MY LORD,","pulls the devils backward by the tails, and drives them from their"
664,"MY LORD,","quarry; or otherwise the whole business had miscarried, and Jerusalem"
665,"MY LORD,","remained untaken. This, says Boileau, is a very unequal match for the"
666,"MY LORD,","poor devils, who are sure to come by the worst of it in the combat;"
667,"MY LORD,","for nothing is more easy, than for an Almighty Power to bring his old"
668,"MY LORD,","rebels to reason, when he pleases. Consequently, what pleasure, what"
669,"MY LORD,","entertainment, can be raised from so pitiful a machine, where we see"
670,"MY LORD,","the success of the battle from the very beginning of it; unless that,"
671,"MY LORD,","as we are Christians, we are glad that we have gotten God on our side,"
672,"MY LORD,","to maul our enemies, when we cannot do the work ourselves? For, if the"
673,"MY LORD,","poet had given the faithful more courage, which had cost him nothing,"
674,"MY LORD,","or at least have made them exceed the Turks in number, he might have"
675,"MY LORD,","gained the victory for us Christians, without interesting heaven in"
676,"MY LORD,","the quarrel, and that with as much ease, and as little credit to the"
677,"MY LORD,","conqueror, as when a party of a hundred soldiers defeats another which"
678,"MY LORD,",consists only of fifty.
679,"MY LORD,",
680,"MY LORD,","This, my lord, I confess, is such an argument against our modern"
681,"MY LORD,","poetry, as cannot be answered by those mediums which have been used. We"
682,"MY LORD,","cannot hitherto boast, that our religion has furnished us with any such"
683,"MY LORD,","machines, as have made the strength and beauty of the ancient buildings."
684,"MY LORD,",
685,"MY LORD,","But what if I venture to advance an invention of my own, to supply"
686,"MY LORD,",the manifest defect of our new writers? I am sufficiently sensible
687,"MY LORD,",of my weakness; and it is not very probable that I should succeed in
688,"MY LORD,","such a project, whereof I have not had the least hint from any of my"
689,"MY LORD,","predecessors, the poets, or any of their seconds and coadjutors, the"
690,"MY LORD,","critics. Yet we see the art of war is improved in sieges, and new"
691,"MY LORD,","instruments of death are invented daily; something new in philosophy,"
692,"MY LORD,","and the mechanics, is discovered almost every year; and the science of"
693,"MY LORD,",former ages is improved by the succeeding. I will not detain you with a
694,"MY LORD,","long preamble to that, which better judges will, perhaps, conclude to"
695,"MY LORD,",be little worth.
696,"MY LORD,",
697,"MY LORD,","It is this, in short--that Christian poets have not hitherto been"
698,"MY LORD,",acquainted with their own strength. If they had searched the Old
699,"MY LORD,","Testament as they ought, they might there have found the machines"
700,"MY LORD,",which are proper for their work; and those more certain in their
701,"MY LORD,","effect, than it may be the New Testament is, in the rules sufficient"
702,"MY LORD,","for salvation. The perusing of one chapter in the prophecy of Daniel,"
703,"MY LORD,",and accommodating what there they find with the principles of Platonic
704,"MY LORD,","philosophy, as it is now christianized, would have made the ministry of"
705,"MY LORD,","angels as strong an engine, for the working up heroic poetry, in our"
706,"MY LORD,","religion, as that of the ancients has been to raise theirs by all the"
707,"MY LORD,","fables of their gods, which were only received for truths by the most"
708,"MY LORD,",ignorant and weakest of the people.[18]
709,"MY LORD,",
710,"MY LORD,","It is a doctrine almost universally received by Christians, as well"
711,"MY LORD,","Protestants as Catholics, that there are guardian angels, appointed by"
712,"MY LORD,","God Almighty, as his vicegerents, for the protection and government"
713,"MY LORD,","of cities, provinces, kingdoms, and monarchies; and those as well of"
714,"MY LORD,","heathens, as of true believers. All this is so plainly proved from"
715,"MY LORD,","those texts of Daniel, that it admits of no farther controversy. The"
716,"MY LORD,","prince of the Persians, and that other of the Grecians, are granted"
717,"MY LORD,",to be the guardians and protecting ministers of those empires. It
718,"MY LORD,","cannot be denied, that they were opposite, and resisted one another."
719,"MY LORD,","St Michael is mentioned by his name as the patron of the Jews,[19]"
720,"MY LORD,","and is now taken by the Christians, as the protector-general of our"
721,"MY LORD,","religion. These tutelar genii, who presided over the several people"
722,"MY LORD,","and regions committed to their charge, were watchful over them for"
723,"MY LORD,","good, as far as their commissions could possibly extend. The general"
724,"MY LORD,","purpose, and design of all, was certainly the service of their Great"
725,"MY LORD,","Creator. But it is an undoubted truth, that, for ends best known to the"
726,"MY LORD,","Almighty Majesty of heaven, his providential designs for the benefit"
727,"MY LORD,","of his creatures, for the debasing and punishing of some nations, and"
728,"MY LORD,","the exaltation and temporal reward of others, were not wholly known to"
729,"MY LORD,","these his ministers; else why those factious quarrels, controversies,"
730,"MY LORD,","and battles amongst themselves, when they were all united in the same"
731,"MY LORD,","design, the service and honour of their common master? But being"
732,"MY LORD,","instructed only in the general, and zealous of the main design; and, as"
733,"MY LORD,","finite beings, not admitted into the secrets of government, the last"
734,"MY LORD,","resorts of providence, or capable of discovering the final purposes"
735,"MY LORD,","of God, who can work good out of evil as he pleases, and irresistibly"
736,"MY LORD,","sways all manner of events on earth, directing them finally for the"
737,"MY LORD,","best, to his creation in general, and to the ultimate end of his own"
738,"MY LORD,","glory in particular; they must, of necessity, be sometimes ignorant"
739,"MY LORD,","of the means conducing to those ends, in which alone they can jar and"
740,"MY LORD,","oppose each other. One angel, as we may suppose--the Prince of Persia,"
741,"MY LORD,","as he is called, judging, that it would be more for God's honour,"
742,"MY LORD,","and the benefit of his people, that the Median and Persian monarchy,"
743,"MY LORD,","which delivered them from the Babylonish captivity, should still be"
744,"MY LORD,","uppermost; and the patron of the Grecians, to whom the will of God"
745,"MY LORD,","might be more particularly revealed, contending, on the other side,"
746,"MY LORD,","for the rise of Alexander and his successors, who were appointed to"
747,"MY LORD,","punish the backsliding Jews, and thereby to put them in mind of their"
748,"MY LORD,","offences, that they might repent, and become more virtuous, and more"
749,"MY LORD,","observant of the law revealed. But how far these controversies, and"
750,"MY LORD,","appearing enmities, of those glorious creatures may be carried; how"
751,"MY LORD,","these oppositions may be best managed, and by what means conducted,"
752,"MY LORD,",is not my business to show or determine; these things must be left
753,"MY LORD,",to the invention and judgement of the poet: if any of so happy a
754,"MY LORD,","genius be now living, or any future age can produce a man, who, being"
755,"MY LORD,","conversant in the philosophy of Plato, as it is now accommodated to"
756,"MY LORD,","Christian use, (for, as Virgil gives us to understand by his example,"
757,"MY LORD,","that is the only proper, of all others, for an epic poem,) who, to his"
758,"MY LORD,","natural endowments, of a large invention, a ripe judgment, and a strong"
759,"MY LORD,","memory, has joined the knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences, and"
760,"MY LORD,","particularly moral philosophy, the mathematics, geography, and history,"
761,"MY LORD,","and with all these qualifications is born a poet; knows, and can"
762,"MY LORD,","practise the variety of numbers, and is master of the language in which"
763,"MY LORD,","he writes;--if such a man, I say, be now arisen, or shall arise, I am"
764,"MY LORD,","vain enough to think, that I have proposed a model to him, by which he"
765,"MY LORD,","may build a nobler, a more beautiful, and more perfect poem, than any"
766,"MY LORD,",yet extant since the ancients.
767,"MY LORD,",
768,"MY LORD,","There is another part of these machines yet wanting; but, by what I"
769,"MY LORD,","have said, it would have been easily supplied by a judicious writer. He"
770,"MY LORD,",could not have failed to add the opposition of ill spirits to the good;
771,"MY LORD,","they have also their design, ever opposite to that of heaven; and this"
772,"MY LORD,",alone has hitherto been the practice of the moderns: but this imperfect
773,"MY LORD,","system, if I may call it such, which I have given, will infinitely"
774,"MY LORD,",advance and carry farther that hypothesis of the evil spirits
775,"MY LORD,","contending with the good. For, being so much weaker, since their fall,"
776,"MY LORD,","than those blessed beings, they are yet supposed to have a permitted"
777,"MY LORD,","power from God of acting ill, as, from their own depraved nature, they"
778,"MY LORD,",have always the will of designing it. A great testimony of which we
779,"MY LORD,","find in holy writ, when God Almighty suffered Satan to appear in the"
780,"MY LORD,","holy synod of the angels, (a thing not hitherto drawn into example by"
781,"MY LORD,","any of the poets,) and also gave him power over all things belonging to"
782,"MY LORD,","his servant Job, excepting only life."
783,"MY LORD,",
784,"MY LORD,","Now, what these wicked spirits cannot compass, by the vast"
785,"MY LORD,","disproportion of their forces to those of the superior beings, they"
786,"MY LORD,","may, by their fraud and cunning, carry farther, in a seeming league,"
787,"MY LORD,","confederacy, or subserviency to the designs of some good angel, as far"
788,"MY LORD,","as consists with his purity to suffer such an aid, the end of which"
789,"MY LORD,","may possibly be disguised, and concealed from his finite knowledge."
790,"MY LORD,","This is, indeed, to suppose a great error in such a being: yet since"
791,"MY LORD,",a devil can appear like an angel of light; since craft and malice
792,"MY LORD,","may sometimes blind, for a while, a more perfect understanding; and,"
793,"MY LORD,","lastly, since Milton has given us an example of the like nature, when"
794,"MY LORD,","Satan, appearing like a cherub to Uriel, the intelligence of the"
795,"MY LORD,","sun, circumvented him even in his own province, and passed only for"
796,"MY LORD,","a curious traveller through those new-created regions, that he might"
797,"MY LORD,","observe therein the workmanship of God, and praise him in his works,--I"
798,"MY LORD,","know not why, upon the same supposition, or some other, a fiend may not"
799,"MY LORD,","deceive a creature of more excellency than himself, but yet a creature;"
800,"MY LORD,","at least, by the connivance, or tacit permission, of the Omniscient"
801,"MY LORD,",Being.
802,"MY LORD,",
803,"MY LORD,","Thus, my lord, I have, as briefly as I could, given your lordship, and"
804,"MY LORD,","by you the world, a rude draught of what I have been long labouring"
805,"MY LORD,","in my imagination, and what I had intended to have put in practice,"
806,"MY LORD,","(though far unable for the attempt of such a poem,) and to have left"
807,"MY LORD,","the stage, (to which my genius never much inclined me,) for a work"
808,"MY LORD,","which would have taken up my life in the performance of it. This,"
809,"MY LORD,","too, I had intended chiefly for the honour of my native country, to"
810,"MY LORD,","which a poet is particularly obliged. Of two subjects, both relating"
811,"MY LORD,","to it, I was doubtful whether I should choose that of King Arthur"
812,"MY LORD,","conquering the Saxons, which, being farther distant in time, gives the"
813,"MY LORD,","greater scope to my invention; or that of Edward, the Black Prince, in"
814,"MY LORD,","subduing Spain, and restoring it to the lawful prince, though a great"
815,"MY LORD,","tyrant, Don Pedro the Cruel: which, for the compass of time, including"
816,"MY LORD,","only the expedition of one year; for the greatness of the action,"
817,"MY LORD,","and its answerable event; for the magnanimity of the English hero,"
818,"MY LORD,",opposed to the ingratitude of the person whom he restored; and for the
819,"MY LORD,","many beautiful episodes, which I had interwoven with the principal"
820,"MY LORD,","design, together with the characters of the chiefest English persons;"
821,"MY LORD,","(wherein, after Virgil and Spenser, I would have taken occasion to"
822,"MY LORD,","represent my living friends and patrons of the noblest families, and"
823,"MY LORD,","also shadowed the events of future ages, in the succession of our"
824,"MY LORD,","imperial line,)--with these helps, and those of the machines, which"
825,"MY LORD,","I have mentioned, I might perhaps have done as well as some of my"
826,"MY LORD,","predecessors, or at least chalked out a way for others to amend my"
827,"MY LORD,",errors in a like design; but being encouraged only with fair words
828,"MY LORD,","by King Charles II., my little salary ill paid, and no prospect of"
829,"MY LORD,","a future subsistence, I was then discouraged in the beginning of my"
830,"MY LORD,","attempt; and now age has overtaken me, and want, a more insufferable"
831,"MY LORD,","evil, through the change of the times, has wholly disenabled me. Though"
832,"MY LORD,","I must ever acknowledge, to the honour of your lordship, and the"
833,"MY LORD,","eternal memory of your charity, that, since this revolution, wherein"
834,"MY LORD,","I have patiently suffered the ruin of my small fortune, and the loss"
835,"MY LORD,","of that poor subsistence which I had from two kings, whom I had served"
836,"MY LORD,","more faithfully than profitably to myself,--then your lordship was"
837,"MY LORD,","pleased, out of no other motive but your own nobleness, without any"
838,"MY LORD,","desert of mine, or the least solicitation from me, to make me a most"
839,"MY LORD,","bountiful present, which, at that time, when I was most in want of it,"
840,"MY LORD,","came most seasonably and unexpectedly to my relief. That favour, my"
841,"MY LORD,","lord, is of itself sufficient to bind any grateful man to a perpetual"
842,"MY LORD,","acknowledgment, and to all the future service, which one of my mean"
843,"MY LORD,",condition can ever be able to perform. May the Almighty God return it
844,"MY LORD,","for me, both in blessing you here, and rewarding you hereafter! I must"
845,"MY LORD,","not presume to defend the cause for which I now suffer, because your"
846,"MY LORD,","lordship is engaged against it; but the more you are so, the greater is"
847,"MY LORD,","my obligation to you, for your laying aside all the considerations of"
848,"MY LORD,","factions and parties, to do an action of pure disinterested charity."
849,"MY LORD,","This is one amongst many of your shining qualities, which distinguish"
850,"MY LORD,","you from others of your rank. But let me add a farther truth, that,"
851,"MY LORD,","without these ties of gratitude, and abstracting from them all, I"
852,"MY LORD,","have a most particular inclination to honour you; and, if it were"
853,"MY LORD,","not too bold an expression, to say, I love you. It is no shame to"
854,"MY LORD,","be a poet, though it is to be a bad one. Augustus Cæsar of old, and"
855,"MY LORD,","Cardinal Richlieu of late, would willingly have been such; and David"
856,"MY LORD,","and Solomon were such. You who, without flattery, are the best of the"
857,"MY LORD,","present age in England, and would have been so, had you been born in"
858,"MY LORD,","any other country, will receive more honour in future ages, by that one"
859,"MY LORD,","excellency, than by all those honours to which your birth has entitled"
860,"MY LORD,","you, or your merits have acquired you."
861,"MY LORD,",
862,"MY LORD,","_Ne, fortè, pudori"
863,"MY LORD,","Sit tibi Musa lyræ solers, et cantor Apollo._"
864,"MY LORD,",
865,"MY LORD,","I have formerly said in this epistle, that I could distinguish your"
866,"MY LORD,",writings from those of any others; it is now time to clear myself
867,"MY LORD,",from any imputation of self-conceit on that subject. I assume not to
868,"MY LORD,",myself any particular lights in this discovery; they are such only as
869,"MY LORD,","are obvious to every man of sense and judgment, who loves poetry, and"
870,"MY LORD,",understands it. Your thoughts are always so remote from the common way
871,"MY LORD,","of thinking, that they are, as I may say, of another species, than the"
872,"MY LORD,",conceptions of other poets; yet you go not out of nature for any of
873,"MY LORD,","them. Gold is never bred upon the surface of the ground, but lies so"
874,"MY LORD,","hidden, and so deep, that the mines of it are seldom found; but the"
875,"MY LORD,","force of waters casts it out from the bowels of mountains, and exposes"
876,"MY LORD,","it amongst the sands of rivers; giving us of her bounty, what we could"
877,"MY LORD,",not hope for by our search. This success attends your lordship's
878,"MY LORD,","thoughts, which would look like chance, if it were not perpetual, and"
879,"MY LORD,","always of the same tenor. If I grant that there is care in it, it is"
880,"MY LORD,",such a care as would be ineffectual and fruitless in other men. It
881,"MY LORD,",is the _curiosa felicitas_ which Petronius ascribes to Horace in his
882,"MY LORD,","Odes. We have not wherewithal to imagine so strongly, so justly, and"
883,"MY LORD,","so pleasantly; in short, if we have the same knowledge, we cannot draw"
884,"MY LORD,","out of it the same quintessence; we cannot give it such a turn, such a"
885,"MY LORD,","propriety, and such a beauty; something is deficient in the manner, or"
886,"MY LORD,","the words, but more in the nobleness of our conception. Yet when you"
887,"MY LORD,","have finished all, and it appears in its full lustre, when the diamond"
888,"MY LORD,","is not only found, but the roughness smoothed, when it is cut into a"
889,"MY LORD,","form, and set in gold, then we cannot but acknowledge, that it is the"
890,"MY LORD,","perfect work of art and nature; and every one will be so vain, to think"
891,"MY LORD,","he himself could have performed the like, until he attempts it. It is"
892,"MY LORD,",just the description that Horace makes of such a finished piece: it
893,"MY LORD,","appears so easy,"
894,"MY LORD,",
895,"MY LORD,",----_Ut sibi quivis
896,"MY LORD,","Speret idem, sudet multum, frustraque laboret,"
897,"MY LORD,",Ausus idem._
898,"MY LORD,",
899,"MY LORD,","And, besides all this, it is your lordship's particular talent to"
900,"MY LORD,","lay your thoughts so close together, that, were they closer, they"
901,"MY LORD,","would be crowded, and even a due connection would be wanting. We are"
902,"MY LORD,","not kept in expectation of two good lines, which are to come after a"
903,"MY LORD,",long parenthesis of twenty bad; which is the April poetry of other
904,"MY LORD,","writers, a mixture of rain and sunshine by fits: you are always bright,"
905,"MY LORD,","even almost to a fault, by reason of the excess. There is continual"
906,"MY LORD,","abundance, a magazine of thought, and yet a perpetual variety of"
907,"MY LORD,","entertainment; which creates such an appetite in your reader, that he"
908,"MY LORD,","is not cloyed with any thing, but satisfied with all. It is that which"
909,"MY LORD,","the Romans call, _cæna dubia_; where there is such plenty, yet withal"
910,"MY LORD,","so much diversity, and so good order, that the choice is difficult"
911,"MY LORD,","betwixt one excellency and another; and yet the conclusion, by a due"
912,"MY LORD,","climax, is evermore the best; that is, as a conclusion ought to be,"
913,"MY LORD,","ever the most proper for its place. See, my lord, whether I have not"
914,"MY LORD,","studied your lordship with some application; and, since you are so"
915,"MY LORD,","modest that you will not be judge and party, I appeal to the whole"
916,"MY LORD,","world, if I have not drawn your picture to a great degree of likeness,"
917,"MY LORD,","though it is but in miniature, and that some of the best features are"
918,"MY LORD,",yet wanting. Yet what I have done is enough to distinguish you from any
919,"MY LORD,","other, which is the proposition that I took upon me to demonstrate."
920,"MY LORD,",
921,"MY LORD,","And now, my lord, to apply what I have said to my present business. The"
922,"MY LORD,","Satires of Juvenal and Persius appearing in this new English dress,"
923,"MY LORD,","cannot so properly be inscribed to any man as to your lordship, who are"
924,"MY LORD,","the first of the age in that way of writing. Your lordship, amongst"
925,"MY LORD,","many other favours, has given me your permission for this address; and"
926,"MY LORD,",you have particularly encouraged me by your perusal and approbation of
927,"MY LORD,","the Sixth and Tenth Satires of Juvenal, as I have translated them. My"
928,"MY LORD,","fellow-labourers have likewise commissioned me, to perform, in their"
929,"MY LORD,","behalf, this office of a dedication to you; and will acknowledge, with"
930,"MY LORD,","all possible respect and gratitude, your acceptance of their work."
931,"MY LORD,",Some of them have the honour to be known to your lordship already;
932,"MY LORD,","and they who have not yet that happiness, desire it now. Be pleased"
933,"MY LORD,","to receive our common endeavours with your wonted candour, without"
934,"MY LORD,",entitling you to the protection of our common failings in so difficult
935,"MY LORD,","an undertaking. And allow me your patience, if it be not already tired"
936,"MY LORD,","with this long epistle, to give you, from the best authors, the origin,"
937,"MY LORD,","the antiquity, the growth, the change, and the completement of satire"
938,"MY LORD,","among the Romans; to describe, if not define, the nature of that poem,"
939,"MY LORD,","with its several qualifications and virtues, together with the several"
940,"MY LORD,","sorts of it; to compare the excellencies of Horace, Persius, and"
941,"MY LORD,","Juvenal, and show the particular manners of their satires; and, lastly,"
942,"MY LORD,","to give an account of this new way of version, which is attempted in"
943,"MY LORD,","our performance: all which, according to the weakness of my ability,"
944,"MY LORD,","and the best lights which I can get from others, shall be the subject"
945,"MY LORD,",of my following discourse.
946,"MY LORD,",
947,"MY LORD,","The most perfect work of poetry, says our master Aristotle, is tragedy."
948,"MY LORD,","His reason is, because it is the most united; being more severely"
949,"MY LORD,","confined within the rules of action, time, and place. The action is"
950,"MY LORD,","entire, of a piece, and one, without episodes; the time limited to a"
951,"MY LORD,",natural day; and the place circumscribed at least within the compass of
952,"MY LORD,","one town, or city. Being exactly proportioned thus, and uniform in all"
953,"MY LORD,","its parts, the mind is more capable of comprehending the whole beauty"
954,"MY LORD,",of it without distraction.
955,"MY LORD,",
956,"MY LORD,","But, after all these advantages, an heroic poem is certainly the"
957,"MY LORD,",greatest work of human nature. The beauties and perfections of the
958,"MY LORD,",other are but mechanical; those of the epic are more noble: though
959,"MY LORD,","Homer has limited his place to Troy, and the fields about it; his"
960,"MY LORD,","actions to forty-eight natural days, whereof twelve are holidays, or"
961,"MY LORD,","cessation from business, during the funeral of Patroclus.--To proceed;"
962,"MY LORD,",the action of the epic is greater; the extention of time enlarges
963,"MY LORD,","the pleasure of the reader, and the episodes give it more ornament,"
964,"MY LORD,",and more variety. The instruction is equal; but the first is only
965,"MY LORD,","instructive, the latter forms a hero, and a prince."
966,"MY LORD,",
967,"MY LORD,","If it signifies any thing which of them is of the more ancient family,"
968,"MY LORD,",the best and most absolute heroic poem was written by Homer long before
969,"MY LORD,","tragedy was invented. But if we consider the natural endowments, and"
970,"MY LORD,","acquired parts, which are necessary to make an accomplished writer"
971,"MY LORD,","in either kind, tragedy requires a less and more confined knowledge;"
972,"MY LORD,","moderate learning, and observation of the rules, is sufficient, if a"
973,"MY LORD,","genius be not wanting. But in an epic poet, one who is worthy of that"
974,"MY LORD,","name, besides an universal genius, is required universal learning,"
975,"MY LORD,",together with all those qualities and acquisitions which I have named
976,"MY LORD,","above, and as many more as I have, through haste or negligence,"
977,"MY LORD,","omitted. And, after all, he must have exactly studied Homer and Virgil,"
978,"MY LORD,","as his patterns; Aristotle and Horace, as his guides; and Vida and"
979,"MY LORD,","Bossu, as their commentators; with many others, both Italian and"
980,"MY LORD,","French critics, which I want leisure here to recommend."
981,"MY LORD,",
982,"MY LORD,","In a word, what I have to say in relation to this subject, which"
983,"MY LORD,","does not particularly concern satire, is, that the greatness of an"
984,"MY LORD,","heroic poem, beyond that of a tragedy, may easily be discovered, by"
985,"MY LORD,",observing how few have attempted that work in comparison to those
986,"MY LORD,","who have written dramas; and, of those few, how small a number have"
987,"MY LORD,","succeeded. But leaving the critics, on either side, to contend about"
988,"MY LORD,","the preference due to this or that sort of poetry, I will hasten to"
989,"MY LORD,","my present business, which is the antiquity and origin of satire,"
990,"MY LORD,",according to those informations which I have received from the learned
991,"MY LORD,","Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, Dacier, and the Dauphin's Juvenal; to"
992,"MY LORD,",which I shall add some observations of my own.
993,"MY LORD,",
994,"MY LORD,","There has been a long dispute among the modern critics, whether the"
995,"MY LORD,","Romans derived their satire from the Grecians, or first invented it"
996,"MY LORD,","themselves. Julius Scaliger, and Heinsius, are of the first opinion;"
997,"MY LORD,","Casaubon, Rigaltius, Dacier, and the publisher of the Dauphin's"
998,"MY LORD,","Juvenal, maintain the latter. If we take satire in the general"
999,"MY LORD,","signification of the word, as it is used in all modern languages, for"
1000,"MY LORD,","an invective, it is certain that it is almost as old as verse; and"
1001,"MY LORD,","though hymns, which are praises of God, may be allowed to have been"
1002,"MY LORD,","before it, yet the defamation of others was not long after it. After"
1003,"MY LORD,","God had cursed Adam and Eve in Paradise, the husband and wife excused"
1004,"MY LORD,","themselves, by laying the blame on one another; and gave a beginning to"
1005,"MY LORD,","those conjugal dialogues in prose, which the poets have perfected in"
1006,"MY LORD,",verse. The third chapter of Job is one of the first instances of this
1007,"MY LORD,","poem in holy scripture; unless we will take it higher, from the latter"
1008,"MY LORD,","end of the second, where his wife advises him to curse his Maker."
1009,"MY LORD,",
1010,"MY LORD,","This original, I confess, is not much to the honour of satire; but here"
1011,"MY LORD,","it was nature, and that depraved: when it became an art, it bore better"
1012,"MY LORD,","fruit. Only we have learnt thus much already, that scoffs and revilings"
1013,"MY LORD,","are of the growth of all nations: and, consequently, that neither the"
1014,"MY LORD,","Greek poets borrowed from other people their art of railing, neither"
1015,"MY LORD,","needed the Romans to take it from them. But, considering satire as a"
1016,"MY LORD,","species of poetry, here the war begins amongst the critics. Scaliger,"
1017,"MY LORD,","the father, will have it descend from Greece to Rome; and derives the"
1018,"MY LORD,","word satire from _Satyrus_, that mixed kind of animal, or, as the"
1019,"MY LORD,","ancients thought him, rural god, made up betwixt a man and a goat; with"
1020,"MY LORD,","a human head, hooked nose, pouting lips, a bunch, or struma, under the"
1021,"MY LORD,","chin, pricked ears, and upright horns; the body shagged with hair,"
1022,"MY LORD,","especially from the waist, and ending in a goat, with the legs and feet"
1023,"MY LORD,","of that creature. But Casaubon, and his followers, with reason, condemn"
1024,"MY LORD,","this derivation; and prove, that from _Satyrus_, the word _satira_,"
1025,"MY LORD,","as it signifies a poem, cannot possibly descend. For _satira_ is not"
1026,"MY LORD,","properly a substantive, but an adjective; to which the word _lanx_ (in"
1027,"MY LORD,","English, a charger, or large platter) is understood; so that the Greek"
1028,"MY LORD,","poem, made according to the manners of a Satyr, and expressing his"
1029,"MY LORD,","qualities, must properly be called satyrical, and not satire. And thus"
1030,"MY LORD,",far it is allowed that the Grecians had such poems; but that they were
1031,"MY LORD,",wholly different in species from that to which the Romans gave the name
1032,"MY LORD,",of satire.
1033,"MY LORD,",
1034,"MY LORD,","Aristotle divides all poetry, in relation to the progress of it, into"
1035,"MY LORD,","nature without art, art begun, and art completed. Mankind, even the"
1036,"MY LORD,","most barbarous, have the seeds of poetry implanted in them. The first"
1037,"MY LORD,","specimen of it was certainly shown in the praises of the Deity, and"
1038,"MY LORD,","prayers to him; and as they are of natural obligation, so they are"
1039,"MY LORD,","likewise of divine institution: which Milton observing, introduces"
1040,"MY LORD,",Adam and Eve every morning adoring God in hymns and prayers. The first
1041,"MY LORD,","poetry was thus begun, in the wild notes of natural poetry, before"
1042,"MY LORD,","the invention of feet, and measures. The Grecians and Romans had no"
1043,"MY LORD,",other original of their poetry. Festivals and holidays soon succeeded
1044,"MY LORD,","to private worship, and we need not doubt but they were enjoined by"
1045,"MY LORD,","the true God to his own people, as they were afterwards imitated by"
1046,"MY LORD,","the heathens; who, by the light of reason, knew they were to invoke"
1047,"MY LORD,","some superior Being in their necessities, and to thank him for his"
1048,"MY LORD,","benefits. Thus, the Grecian holidays were celebrated with offerings to"
1049,"MY LORD,","Bacchus, and Ceres, and other deities, to whose bounty they supposed"
1050,"MY LORD,","they were owing for their corn and wine, and other helps of life; and"
1051,"MY LORD,","the ancient Romans, as Horace tells us, paid their thanks to mother"
1052,"MY LORD,","Earth, or Vesta, to Silvanus, and their Genius, in the same manner. But"
1053,"MY LORD,","as all festivals have a double reason of their institution, the first"
1054,"MY LORD,","of religion, the other of recreation, for the unbending of our minds,"
1055,"MY LORD,","so both the Grecians and Romans agreed, after their sacrifices were"
1056,"MY LORD,","performed, to spend the remainder of the day in sports and merriments;"
1057,"MY LORD,","amongst which, songs and dances, and that which they called wit, (for"
1058,"MY LORD,","want of knowing better,) were the chiefest entertainments. The Grecians"
1059,"MY LORD,","had a notion of Satyrs, whom I have already described; and taking them,"
1060,"MY LORD,","and the Sileni, that is, the young Satyrs and the old, for the tutors,"
1061,"MY LORD,","attendants, and humble companions of their Bacchus, habited themselves"
1062,"MY LORD,","like those rural deities, and imitated them in their rustic dances, to"
1063,"MY LORD,","which they joined songs, with some sort of rude harmony, but without"
1064,"MY LORD,",certain numbers; and to these they added a kind of chorus.
1065,"MY LORD,",
1066,"MY LORD,","The Romans, also, (as nature is the same in all places,) though they"
1067,"MY LORD,","knew nothing of those Grecian demi-gods, nor had any communication with"
1068,"MY LORD,","Greece, yet had certain young men, who, at their festivals, danced and"
1069,"MY LORD,","sung, after their uncouth manner, to a certain kind of verse, which"
1070,"MY LORD,","they called Saturnian. What it was, we have no certain light from"
1071,"MY LORD,","antiquity to discover; but we may conclude, that, like the Grecian, it"
1072,"MY LORD,","was void of art, or, at least, with very feeble beginnings of it. Those"
1073,"MY LORD,","ancient Romans, at these holidays, which were a mixture of devotion and"
1074,"MY LORD,","debauchery, had a custom of reproaching each other with their faults,"
1075,"MY LORD,","in a sort of extempore poetry, or rather of tunable hobbling verse; and"
1076,"MY LORD,",they answered in the same kind of gross raillery; their wit and their
1077,"MY LORD,","music being of a piece. The Grecians, says Casaubon, had formerly done"
1078,"MY LORD,","the same, in the persons of their petulant Satyrs. But I am afraid"
1079,"MY LORD,","he mistakes the matter, and confounds the singing and dancing of the"
1080,"MY LORD,","Satyrs, with the rustical entertainments of the first Romans. The"
1081,"MY LORD,","reason of my opinion is this; that Casaubon, finding little light from"
1082,"MY LORD,","antiquity of these beginnings of poetry amongst the Grecians, but only"
1083,"MY LORD,","these representations of Satyrs, who carried canisters and cornucopias"
1084,"MY LORD,","full of several fruits in their hands, and danced with them at their"
1085,"MY LORD,","public feasts; and afterwards reading Horace, who makes mention of his"
1086,"MY LORD,","homely Romans jesting at one another in the same kind of solemnities,"
1087,"MY LORD,",might suppose those wanton Satyrs did the same; and especially because
1088,"MY LORD,","Horace possibly might seem to him, to have shown the original of all"
1089,"MY LORD,","poetry in general, including the Grecians as well as Romans; though it"
1090,"MY LORD,","is plainly otherwise, that he only described the beginning, and first"
1091,"MY LORD,","rudiments, of poetry in his own country. The verses are these, which he"
1092,"MY LORD,","cites from the First Epistle of the Second Book, which was written to"
1093,"MY LORD,",Augustus:
1094,"MY LORD,",
1095,"MY LORD,","_Agricolæ prisci, fortes, parvoque beati,"
1096,"MY LORD,","Condita post frumenta, levantes tempore festo"
1097,"MY LORD,","Corpus, et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,"
1098,"MY LORD,","Cum sociis operum, et pueris, et conjuge fidâ,"
1099,"MY LORD,","Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant;"
1100,"MY LORD,",Floribus et vino Genium memorem brevis ævi.
1101,"MY LORD,",Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem
1102,"MY LORD,",Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit._
1103,"MY LORD,",
1104,"MY LORD,","Our brawny clowns, of old, who turned the soil,"
1105,"MY LORD,","Content with little, and inured to toil,"
1106,"MY LORD,","At harvest-home, with mirth and country cheer,"
1107,"MY LORD,",Restored their bodies for another year;
1108,"MY LORD,","Refreshed their spirits, and renewed their hope"
1109,"MY LORD,","Of such a future feast, and future crop."
1110,"MY LORD,","Then, with their fellow-joggers of the ploughs,"
1111,"MY LORD,","Their little children, and their faithful spouse,"
1112,"MY LORD,","A sow they slew to Vesta's deity,"
1113,"MY LORD,","And kindly milk, Silvanus, poured to thee;"
1114,"MY LORD,","With flowers, and wine, their Genius they adored;"
1115,"MY LORD,","A short life, and a merry, was the word."
1116,"MY LORD,","From flowing cups, defaming rhymes ensue,"
1117,"MY LORD,",And at each other homely taunts they threw.
1118,"MY LORD,",
1119,"MY LORD,","Yet since it is a hard conjecture, that so great a man as Casaubon"
1120,"MY LORD,","should misapply what Horace writ concerning ancient Rome, to the"
1121,"MY LORD,","ceremonies and manners of ancient Greece, I will not insist on this"
1122,"MY LORD,","opinion; but rather judge in general, that since all poetry had its"
1123,"MY LORD,","original from religion, that of the Grecians and Rome had the same"
1124,"MY LORD,","beginning. Both were invented at festivals of thanksgiving, and both"
1125,"MY LORD,","were prosecuted with mirth and raillery, and rudiments of verses:"
1126,"MY LORD,","amongst the Greeks, by those who represented Satyrs; and amongst the"
1127,"MY LORD,","Romans, by real clowns."
1128,"MY LORD,",
1129,"MY LORD,","For, indeed, when I am reading Casaubon on these two subjects, methinks"
1130,"MY LORD,",I hear the same story told twice over with very little alteration. Of
1131,"MY LORD,","which Dacier taking notice, in his interpretation of the Latin verses"
1132,"MY LORD,","which I have translated, says plainly, that the beginning of poetry was"
1133,"MY LORD,","the same, with a small variety, in both countries; and that the mother"
1134,"MY LORD,","of it, in all nations, was devotion. But, what is yet more wonderful,"
1135,"MY LORD,","that most learned critic takes notice also, in his illustrations"
1136,"MY LORD,","on the First Epistle of the Second Book, that as the poetry of the"
1137,"MY LORD,","Romans, and that of the Grecians, had the same beginning, (at feasts"
1138,"MY LORD,","and thanksgiving, as it has been observed,) and the old comedy of"
1139,"MY LORD,","the Greeks, which was invective, and the satire of the Romans, which"
1140,"MY LORD,","was of the same nature, were begun on the very same occasion, so the"
1141,"MY LORD,","fortune of both, in process of time, was just the same; the old comedy"
1142,"MY LORD,","of the Grecians was forbidden, for its too much licence in exposing of"
1143,"MY LORD,",particular persons; and the rude satire of the Romans was also punished
1144,"MY LORD,","by a law of the Decemviri, as Horace tells us, in these words:"
1145,"MY LORD,",
1146,"MY LORD,",_Libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos
1147,"MY LORD,",Lusit amabiliter; donec jam sævus apertam
1148,"MY LORD,","In rabiem verti coepit jocus, et per honestas"
1149,"MY LORD,",Ire domos impune minax: doluere cruento
1150,"MY LORD,",Dente lacessiti; fuit intactis quoque cura
1151,"MY LORD,","Conditione super communi: quinetiam lex,"
1152,"MY LORD,","Poenaque lata, malo quæ nollet carmine quenquam"
1153,"MY LORD,","Describi: vertere modum, formidine fustis"
1154,"MY LORD,",Ad benedicendum delectandumque redacti._
1155,"MY LORD,",
1156,"MY LORD,","The law of the Decemviri was this: _Siquis occentassit malum carmen,"
1157,"MY LORD,","sive condidisit, quod infamiam faxit, flagitiumve alteri, capital"
1158,"MY LORD,","esto_.--A strange likeness, and barely possible; but the critics being"
1159,"MY LORD,","all of the same opinion, it becomes me to be silent, and to submit to"
1160,"MY LORD,",better judgments than my own.
1161,"MY LORD,",
1162,"MY LORD,","But, to return to the Grecians, from whose satiric dramas the elder"
1163,"MY LORD,","Scaliger and Heinsius will have the Roman satire to proceed, I am to"
1164,"MY LORD,","take a view of them first, and see if there be any such descent from"
1165,"MY LORD,",them as those authors have pretended.
1166,"MY LORD,",
1167,"MY LORD,","Thespis, or whoever he were that invented tragedy, (for authors"
1168,"MY LORD,","differ,) mingled with them a chorus and dances of Satyrs, which had"
1169,"MY LORD,",before been used in the celebration of their festivals; and there they
1170,"MY LORD,","were ever afterwards retained. The character of them was also kept,"
1171,"MY LORD,","which was mirth and wantonness; and this was given, I suppose, to the"
1172,"MY LORD,","folly of the common audience, who soon grow weary of good sense, and,"
1173,"MY LORD,","as we daily see in our own age and country, are apt to forsake poetry,"
1174,"MY LORD,","and still ready to return to buffoonery and farce. From hence it came,"
1175,"MY LORD,","that, in the Olympic games, where the poets contended for four prizes,"
1176,"MY LORD,","the satiric tragedy was the last of them; for, in the rest, the Satyrs"
1177,"MY LORD,",were excluded from the chorus. Among the plays of Euripides which are
1178,"MY LORD,","yet remaining, there is one of these SATYRICS, which is called ""The"
1179,"MY LORD,","Cyclops;"" in which we may see the nature of those poems, and from"
1180,"MY LORD,","thence conclude, what likeness they have to the Roman SATIRE."
1181,"MY LORD,",
1182,"MY LORD,","The story of this Cyclops, whose name was Polyphemus, so famous in the"
1183,"MY LORD,","Grecian fables, was, that Ulysses, who, with his company, was driven"
1184,"MY LORD,","on the coast of Sicily, where those Cyclops inhabited, coming to ask"
1185,"MY LORD,","relief from Silenus, and the Satyrs, who were herdsmen to that one-eyed"
1186,"MY LORD,","giant, was kindly received by them, and entertained; till, being"
1187,"MY LORD,","perceived by Polyphemus, they were made prisoners against the rites of"
1188,"MY LORD,","hospitality, (for which Ulysses eloquently pleaded,) were afterwards"
1189,"MY LORD,","put down into the den, and some of them devoured; after which Ulysses,"
1190,"MY LORD,","having made him drunk, when he was asleep, thrust a great firebrand"
1191,"MY LORD,","into his eye, and so, revenging his dead followers, escaped with the"
1192,"MY LORD,",remaining party of the living; and Silenus and the Satyrs were freed
1193,"MY LORD,","from their servitude under Polyphemus, and remitted to their first"
1194,"MY LORD,","liberty of attending and accompanying their patron, Bacchus."
1195,"MY LORD,",
1196,"MY LORD,","This was the subject of the tragedy; which, being one of those that end"
1197,"MY LORD,","with a happy event, is therefore, by Aristotle, judged below the other"
1198,"MY LORD,","sort, whose success is unfortunate. Notwithstanding which, the Satyrs,"
1199,"MY LORD,","who were part of the _dramatis personæ_, as well as the whole chorus,"
1200,"MY LORD,","were properly introduced into the nature of the poem, which is mixed"
1201,"MY LORD,",of farce and tragedy. The adventure of Ulysses was to entertain the
1202,"MY LORD,","judging part of the audience; and the uncouth persons of Silenus, and"
1203,"MY LORD,","the Satyrs, to divert the common people with their gross railleries."
1204,"MY LORD,",
1205,"MY LORD,","Your lordship has perceived by this time, that this SATIRIC tragedy,"
1206,"MY LORD,","and the Roman SATIRE, have little resemblance in any of their"
1207,"MY LORD,",features. The very kinds are different; for what has a pastoral tragedy
1208,"MY LORD,",to do with a paper of verses satirically written? The character and
1209,"MY LORD,",raillery of the Satyrs is the only thing that could pretend to a
1210,"MY LORD,","likeness, were Scaliger and Heinsius alive to maintain their opinion."
1211,"MY LORD,","And the first farces of the Romans, which were the rudiments of their"
1212,"MY LORD,","poetry, were written before they had any communication with the Greeks,"
1213,"MY LORD,",or indeed any knowledge of that people.
1214,"MY LORD,",
1215,"MY LORD,",And here it will be proper to give the definition of the Greek satyric
1216,"MY LORD,","poem from Casaubon, before I leave this subject. ""The SATIRIC,"" says"
1217,"MY LORD,","he, ""is a dramatic poem, annexed to a tragedy, having a chorus, which"
1218,"MY LORD,",consists of Satyrs. The persons represented in it are illustrious men;
1219,"MY LORD,","the action of it is great; the style is partly serious, and partly"
1220,"MY LORD,","jocular; and the event of the action most commonly is happy."""
1221,"MY LORD,",
1222,"MY LORD,","The Grecians, besides these SATIRIC tragedies, had another kind of"
1223,"MY LORD,","poem, which they called Silli, which were more of kin to the Roman"
1224,"MY LORD,","satire. Those Silli were indeed invective poems, but of a different"
1225,"MY LORD,","species from the Roman poems of Ennius, Pacuvius, Lucilius, Horace, and"
1226,"MY LORD,","the rest of their successors. They were so called, says Casaubon in"
1227,"MY LORD,","one place, from Silenus, the foster-father of Bacchus; but, in another"
1228,"MY LORD,","place, bethinking himself better, he derives their name, #apo tou"
1229,"MY LORD,","sillainein#, from their scoffing and petulancy. From some fragments of"
1230,"MY LORD,","the Silli, written by Timon, we may find, that they were satiric poems,"
1231,"MY LORD,","full of parodies; that is, of verses patched up from great poets,"
1232,"MY LORD,","and turned into another sense than their author intended them. Such,"
1233,"MY LORD,","amongst the Romans, is the famous Cento of Ausonius; where the words"
1234,"MY LORD,","are Virgil's, but, by applying them to another sense, they are made"
1235,"MY LORD,",a relation of a wedding-night; and the act of consummation fulsomely
1236,"MY LORD,",described in the very words of the most modest amongst all poets. Of
1237,"MY LORD,","the same manner are our songs, which are turned into burlesque, and"
1238,"MY LORD,",the serious words of the author perverted into a ridiculous meaning.
1239,"MY LORD,","Thus in Timon's Silli the words are generally those of Homer, and the"
1240,"MY LORD,","tragic poets; but he applies them, satirically, to some customs and"
1241,"MY LORD,","kinds of philosophy, which he arraigns. But the Romans, not using any"
1242,"MY LORD,","of these parodies in their satires,--sometimes, indeed, repeating"
1243,"MY LORD,","verses of other men, as Persius cites some of Nero's, but not turning"
1244,"MY LORD,","them into another meaning,--the Silli cannot be supposed to be the"
1245,"MY LORD,","original of Roman satire. To these Silli, consisting of parodies, we"
1246,"MY LORD,",may properly add the satires which were written against particular
1247,"MY LORD,","persons; such as were the Iambics of Archilochus against Lycambes,"
1248,"MY LORD,","which Horace undoubtedly imitated in some of his Odes and Epodes, whose"
1249,"MY LORD,",titles bear sufficient witness of it. I might also name the invective
1250,"MY LORD,","of Ovid against Ibis, and many others; but these are the under-wood"
1251,"MY LORD,","of satire, rather than the timber-trees: they are not of general"
1252,"MY LORD,","extension, as reaching only to some individual person. And Horace seems"
1253,"MY LORD,",to have purged himself from those splenetic reflections in those Odes
1254,"MY LORD,","and Epodes, before he undertook the noble work of Satires, which were"
1255,"MY LORD,",properly so called.
1256,"MY LORD,",
1257,"MY LORD,","Thus, my lord, I have at length disengaged myself from those"
1258,"MY LORD,","antiquities of Greece; and have proved, I hope, from the best critics,"
1259,"MY LORD,","that the Roman satire was not borrowed from thence, but of their own"
1260,"MY LORD,","manufacture. I am now almost gotten into my depth; at least, by the"
1261,"MY LORD,","help of Dacier, I am swimming towards it. Not that I will promise"
1262,"MY LORD,","always to follow him, any more than he follows Casaubon; but to keep"
1263,"MY LORD,","him in my eye, as my best and truest guide; and where I think he may"
1264,"MY LORD,","possibly mislead me, there to have recourse to my own lights, as I"
1265,"MY LORD,",expect that others should do by me.
1266,"MY LORD,",
1267,"MY LORD,","Quintilian says, in plain words, _Satira quidem tota nostra est_; and"
1268,"MY LORD,","Horace had said the same thing before him, speaking of his predecessor"
1269,"MY LORD,","in that sort of poetry,--_Et Græcis intacti carminis auctor_. Nothing"
1270,"MY LORD,","can be clearer than the opinion of the poet, and the orator, both the"
1271,"MY LORD,","best critics of the two best ages of the Roman empire, that satire was"
1272,"MY LORD,","wholly of Latin growth, and not transplanted to Rome from Athens.[20]"
1273,"MY LORD,","Yet, as I have said, Scaliger, the father, according to his custom,"
1274,"MY LORD,","that is, insolently enough, contradicts them both; and gives no better"
1275,"MY LORD,","reason, than the derivation of _satyrus_ from #sathy#, _salacitas_; and"
1276,"MY LORD,","so, from the lechery of those fauns, thinks he has sufficiently proved,"
1277,"MY LORD,",that satire is derived from them: as if wantonness and lubricity were
1278,"MY LORD,","essential to that sort of poem, which ought to be avoided in it. His"
1279,"MY LORD,","other allegation, which I have already mentioned, is as pitiful; that"
1280,"MY LORD,",the Satyrs carried platters and canisters full of fruit in their
1281,"MY LORD,","hands. If they had entered empty-handed, had they been ever the less"
1282,"MY LORD,","Satyrs? Or were the fruits and flowers, which they offered, any thing"
1283,"MY LORD,",of kin to satire? Or any argument that this poem was originally
1284,"MY LORD,","Grecian? Casaubon judged better, and his opinion is grounded on sure"
1285,"MY LORD,","authority, that satire was derived from _satura_, a Roman word, which"
1286,"MY LORD,","signifies--full and abundant, and full also of variety, in which"
1287,"MY LORD,","nothing is wanting to its due perfection. It is thus, says Dacier, that"
1288,"MY LORD,","we say--a full colour, when the wool has taken the whole tincture,"
1289,"MY LORD,",and drunk in as much of the dye as it can receive. According to this
1290,"MY LORD,","derivation, from _satur_ comes _satura_, or _satyra_, according to"
1291,"MY LORD,",the new spelling; as _optumus_ and _maxumus_ are now spelled _optimus_
1292,"MY LORD,","and _maximus_. _Satura_, as I have formerly noted, is an adjective,"
1293,"MY LORD,","and relates to the word _lanx_ which is understood; and this _lanx_,"
1294,"MY LORD,","in English a charger, or large platter, was yearly filled with all"
1295,"MY LORD,","sorts of fruits, which were offered to the gods at their festivals, as"
1296,"MY LORD,","the _premices_, or first gatherings. These offerings of several sorts"
1297,"MY LORD,","thus mingled, it is true, were not unknown to the Grecians, who called"
1298,"MY LORD,","them #pankarpon thysian#, a sacrifice of all sorts of fruits; and"
1299,"MY LORD,","#panpermian#, when they offered all kinds of grain."
1300,"MY LORD,",
1301,"MY LORD,","Virgil has mentioned these sacrifices in his ""Georgics:"""
1302,"MY LORD,",
1303,"MY LORD,",_Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta_:
1304,"MY LORD,",
1305,"MY LORD,","and in another place, _lancesque et liba feremus_: that is, We offer"
1306,"MY LORD,","the smoaking entrails in great platters, and we will offer the chargers"
1307,"MY LORD,",and the cakes.
1308,"MY LORD,",
1309,"MY LORD,",The word _satura_ has been afterwards applied to many other sort of
1310,"MY LORD,","mixtures; as Festus calls it a kind of _olla_, or hotchpotch, made of"
1311,"MY LORD,","several sorts of meats. Laws were also called _leges saturæ_, when they"
1312,"MY LORD,","were of several heads and titles, like our tacked bills of parliament:"
1313,"MY LORD,","and _per saturam legem ferre_, in the Roman senate, was to carry a law"
1314,"MY LORD,","without telling the senators, or counting voices, when they were in"
1315,"MY LORD,","haste. Sallust uses the word,--_per saturam sententias exquirere_;"
1316,"MY LORD,",when the majority was visible on one side. From hence it may probably
1317,"MY LORD,","be conjectured, that the Discourses, or Satires, of Ennius, Lucilius,"
1318,"MY LORD,","and Horace, as we now call them, took their name; because they are"
1319,"MY LORD,","full of various matters, and are also written on various subjects, as"
1320,"MY LORD,","Porphyrius says. But Dacier affirms, that it is not immediately from"
1321,"MY LORD,",thence that these satires are so called; for that name had been used
1322,"MY LORD,","formerly for other things, which bore a nearer resemblance to those"
1323,"MY LORD,","discourses of Horace. In explaining of which, continues Dacier, a"
1324,"MY LORD,","method is to be pursued, of which Casaubon himself has never thought,"
1325,"MY LORD,","and which will put all things into so clear a light, that no farther"
1326,"MY LORD,",room will be left for the least dispute.
1327,"MY LORD,",
1328,"MY LORD,","During the space of almost four hundred years, since the building"
1329,"MY LORD,","of their city, the Romans had never known any entertainments of the"
1330,"MY LORD,",stage. Chance and jollity first found out those verses which they
1331,"MY LORD,","called _Saturnian_, and _Fescennine_; or rather human nature, which"
1332,"MY LORD,","is inclined to poetry, first produced them, rude and barbarous,"
1333,"MY LORD,","and unpolished, as all other operations of the soul are in their"
1334,"MY LORD,","beginnings, before they are cultivated with art and study. However, in"
1335,"MY LORD,",occasions of merriment they were first practised; and this rough-cast
1336,"MY LORD,","unhewn poetry was instead of stage-plays, for the space of an hundred"
1337,"MY LORD,","and twenty years together. They were made _extempore_, and were, as the"
1338,"MY LORD,","French call them, _impromptùs_; for which the Tarsians of old were much"
1339,"MY LORD,",renowned; and we see the daily examples of them in the Italian farces
1340,"MY LORD,","of Harlequin and Scaramucha. Such was the poetry of that savage people,"
1341,"MY LORD,","before it was turned into numbers, and the harmony of verse. Little"
1342,"MY LORD,","of the Saturnian verses is now remaining; we only know from authors,"
1343,"MY LORD,","that they were nearer prose than poetry, without feet, or measure."
1344,"MY LORD,","They were #enrythmoi#, but not #emmetroi#. Perhaps they might be used"
1345,"MY LORD,","in the solemn part of their ceremonies; and the Fescennine, which were"
1346,"MY LORD,","invented after them, in the afternoon's debauchery, because they were"
1347,"MY LORD,",scoffing and obscene.
1348,"MY LORD,",
1349,"MY LORD,",The Fescennine and Saturnian were the same; for as they were called
1350,"MY LORD,","Saturnian from their ancientness, when Saturn reigned in Italy, they"
1351,"MY LORD,","were also called Fescennine, from Fescennia, a town in the same"
1352,"MY LORD,","country, where they were first practised. The actors, with a gross and"
1353,"MY LORD,","rustic kind of raillery, reproached each other with their failings;"
1354,"MY LORD,",and at the same time were nothing sparing of it to their audience.
1355,"MY LORD,","Somewhat of this custom was afterwards retained in the Saturnalia, or"
1356,"MY LORD,","feasts of Saturn, celebrated in December; at least all kind of freedom"
1357,"MY LORD,","in speech was then allowed to slaves, even against their masters; and"
1358,"MY LORD,",we are not without some imitation of it in our Christmas gambols.
1359,"MY LORD,","Soldiers also used those Fescennine verses, after measure and numbers"
1360,"MY LORD,","had been added to them, at the triumph of their generals: of which we"
1361,"MY LORD,","have an example, in the triumph of Julius Cæsar over Gaul, in these"
1362,"MY LORD,","expressions: _Cæsar Gallias subegit, Nicomedes Cæsarem. Ecce Cæsar"
1363,"MY LORD,","nunc triumphat, qui subegit Gallias: Nicomedes non triumphat, qui"
1364,"MY LORD,",subegit Cæsarem_. The vapours of wine made those first satirical poets
1365,"MY LORD,","amongst the Romans; which, says Dacier, we cannot better represent,"
1366,"MY LORD,","than by imagining a company of clowns on a holiday, dancing lubberly,"
1367,"MY LORD,","and upbraiding one another, in _extempore_ doggrel, with their defects"
1368,"MY LORD,","and vices, and the stories that were told of them in bake houses and"
1369,"MY LORD,",barbers' shops.
1370,"MY LORD,",
1371,"MY LORD,","When they began to be somewhat better bred, and were entering, as I may"
1372,"MY LORD,","say, into the first rudiments of civil conversation, they left these"
1373,"MY LORD,","hedge-notes for another sort of poem, somewhat polished, which was"
1374,"MY LORD,","also full of pleasant raillery, but without any mixture of obscenity."
1375,"MY LORD,","This sort of poetry appeared under the name of satire, because of its"
1376,"MY LORD,","variety; and this satire was adorned with compositions of music, and"
1377,"MY LORD,",with dances; but lascivious postures were banished from it. In the
1378,"MY LORD,","Tuscan language, says Livy, the word _hister_ signifies a player;"
1379,"MY LORD,","and therefore those actors, which were first brought from Etruria to"
1380,"MY LORD,","Rome, on occasion of a pestilence, when the Romans were admonished to"
1381,"MY LORD,","avert the anger of the Gods by plays, in the year _ab urbe condita_"
1382,"MY LORD,","CCCXC.,--those actors, I say, were therefore called _histriones_; and"
1383,"MY LORD,","that name has since remained, not only to actors Roman born, but to all"
1384,"MY LORD,",others of every nation. They played not the former _extempore_ stuff of
1385,"MY LORD,","Fescennine verses, or clownish jests; but what they acted was a kind"
1386,"MY LORD,","of civil, cleanly farce, with music and dances, and motions that were"
1387,"MY LORD,",proper to the subject.
1388,"MY LORD,",
1389,"MY LORD,","In this condition Livius Andronicus found the stage, when he attempted"
1390,"MY LORD,","first, instead of farces, to supply it with a nobler entertainment of"
1391,"MY LORD,","tragedies and comedies. This man was a Grecian born, and being made a"
1392,"MY LORD,","slave by Livius Salinator, and brought to Rome, had the education of"
1393,"MY LORD,",his patron's children committed to him; which trust he discharged so
1394,"MY LORD,","much to the satisfaction of his master, that he gave him his liberty."
1395,"MY LORD,",
1396,"MY LORD,","Andronicus, thus become a freeman of Rome, added to his own name"
1397,"MY LORD,","that of Livius his master; and, as I observed, was the first author"
1398,"MY LORD,","of a regular play in that commonwealth. Being already instructed,"
1399,"MY LORD,","in his native country, in the manners and decencies of the Athenian"
1400,"MY LORD,","theatre, and conversant in the _Archæa Comoedia_, or old comedy of"
1401,"MY LORD,","Aristophanes, and the rest of the Grecian poets, he took from that"
1402,"MY LORD,",model his own designing of plays for the Roman stage; the first of
1403,"MY LORD,","which was represented in the year CCCCCXIV., since the building of"
1404,"MY LORD,","Rome, as Tully, from the commentaries of Atticus, has assured us: it"
1405,"MY LORD,","was after the end of the first Punic war, the year before Ennius was"
1406,"MY LORD,",born. Dacier has not carried the matter altogether thus far; he only
1407,"MY LORD,","says, that one Livius Andronicus was the first stage-poet at Rome. But"
1408,"MY LORD,","I will adventure on this hint, to advance another proposition, which"
1409,"MY LORD,",I hope the learned will approve. And though we have not any thing of
1410,"MY LORD,","Andronicus remaining to justify my conjecture, yet it is exceedingly"
1411,"MY LORD,","probable, that, having read the works of those Grecian wits, his"
1412,"MY LORD,","countrymen, he imitated not only the ground work, but also the manner"
1413,"MY LORD,","of their writing; and how grave soever his tragedies might be, yet,"
1414,"MY LORD,","in his comedies, he expressed the way of Aristophanes, Eupolis, and"
1415,"MY LORD,","the rest, which was to call some persons by their own names, and to"
1416,"MY LORD,",expose their defects to the laughter of the people: the examples of
1417,"MY LORD,","which we have in the forementioned Aristophanes, who turned the wise"
1418,"MY LORD,","Socrates into ridicule, and is also very free with the management of"
1419,"MY LORD,","Cleon, Alcibiades, and other ministers of the Athenian government."
1420,"MY LORD,","Now, if this be granted, we may easily suppose, that the first hint of"
1421,"MY LORD,",satirical plays on the Roman stage was given by the Greeks: not from
1422,"MY LORD,","the Satirica, for that has been reasonably exploded in the former part"
1423,"MY LORD,","of this discourse: but from their old comedy, which was imitated first"
1424,"MY LORD,",by Livius Andronicus. And then Quintilian and Horace must be cautiously
1425,"MY LORD,","interpreted, where they affirm, that satire is wholly Roman, and a sort"
1426,"MY LORD,","of verse, which was not touched on by the Grecians. The reconcilement"
1427,"MY LORD,","of my opinion to the standard of their judgment is not, however, very"
1428,"MY LORD,","difficult, since they spoke of satire, not as in its first elements,"
1429,"MY LORD,","but as it was formed into a separate work; begun by Ennius, pursued by"
1430,"MY LORD,","Lucilius, and completed afterwards by Horace. The proof depends only"
1431,"MY LORD,","on this _postulatum_,--that the comedies of Andronicus, which were"
1432,"MY LORD,","imitations of the Greek, were also imitations of their railleries, and"
1433,"MY LORD,","reflections on particular persons. For, if this be granted me, which is"
1434,"MY LORD,","a most probable supposition, it is easy to infer, that the first light"
1435,"MY LORD,","which was given to the Roman theatrical satire, was from the plays of"
1436,"MY LORD,","Livius Andronicus; which will be more manifestly discovered, when I"
1437,"MY LORD,",come to speak of Ennius. In the meantime I will return to Dacier.
1438,"MY LORD,",
1439,"MY LORD,","The people, says he, ran in crowds to these new entertainments of"
1440,"MY LORD,","Andronicus, as to pieces which were more noble in their kind, and more"
1441,"MY LORD,","perfect than their former satires, which for some time they neglected"
1442,"MY LORD,","and abandoned. But not long after, they took them up again, and then"
1443,"MY LORD,",they joined them to their comedies; playing them at the end of every
1444,"MY LORD,","drama, as the French continue at this day to act their farces, in"
1445,"MY LORD,",the nature of a separate entertainment from their tragedies. But more
1446,"MY LORD,","particularly they were joined to the _Atellane_ fables, says Casaubon;"
1447,"MY LORD,","which were plays invented by the Osci. Those fables, says Valerius"
1448,"MY LORD,","Maximus, out of Livy, were tempered with the Italian severity, and free"
1449,"MY LORD,","from any note of infamy, or obsceneness; and, as an old commentator"
1450,"MY LORD,","of Juvenal affirms, the _Exodiarii_, which were singers and dancers,"
1451,"MY LORD,","entered to entertain the people with light songs, and mimical gestures,"
1452,"MY LORD,","that they might not go away oppressed with melancholy, from those"
1453,"MY LORD,",serious pieces of the theatre. So that the ancient satire of the Romans
1454,"MY LORD,","was in _extempore_ reproaches; the next was farce, which was brought"
1455,"MY LORD,","from Tuscany; to that succeeded the plays of Andronicus, from the"
1456,"MY LORD,",old comedy of the Grecians; and out of all these sprung two several
1457,"MY LORD,","branches of new Roman satire, like different scions from the same root,"
1458,"MY LORD,",which I shall prove with as much brevity as the subject will allow.
1459,"MY LORD,",
1460,"MY LORD,","A year after Andronicus had opened the Roman stage with his new dramas,"
1461,"MY LORD,","Ennius was born; who, when he was grown to man's estate, having"
1462,"MY LORD,","seriously considered the genius of the people, and how eagerly they"
1463,"MY LORD,","followed the first satires, thought it would be worth his pains to"
1464,"MY LORD,","refine upon the project, and to write Satires, not to be acted on the"
1465,"MY LORD,","theatre, but read. He preserved the ground-work of their pleasantry,"
1466,"MY LORD,","their venom, and their raillery on particular persons, and general"
1467,"MY LORD,","vices; and by this means, avoiding the danger of any ill success in a"
1468,"MY LORD,","public representation, he hoped to be as well received in the cabinet,"
1469,"MY LORD,",as Andronicus had been upon the stage. The event was answerable to his
1470,"MY LORD,","expectation. He made discourses in several sorts of verse, varied often"
1471,"MY LORD,",in the same paper; retaining still in the title their original name of
1472,"MY LORD,","Satire. Both in relation to the subjects, and the variety of matters"
1473,"MY LORD,","contained in them, the Satires of Horace are entirely like them; only"
1474,"MY LORD,","Ennius, as I said, confines not himself to one sort of verse, as Horace"
1475,"MY LORD,","does; but, taking example from the Greeks, and even from Homer himself"
1476,"MY LORD,","in his MARGITES, which is a kind of Satire, as Scaliger observes,"
1477,"MY LORD,","gives himself the licence, when one sort of numbers comes not easily,"
1478,"MY LORD,","to run into another, as his fancy dictates. For he makes no difficulty"
1479,"MY LORD,","to mingle hexameter with iambick trimeters, or with trochaick"
1480,"MY LORD,",tetrameters; as appears by those fragments which are yet remaining of
1481,"MY LORD,",him. Horace has thought him worthy to be copied; inserting many things
1482,"MY LORD,","of his into his own Satires, as Virgil has done into his Æneids."
1483,"MY LORD,",
1484,"MY LORD,",Here we have Dacier making out that Ennius was the first satirist
1485,"MY LORD,","in that way of writing, which was of his invention; that is, satire"
1486,"MY LORD,","abstracted from the stage, and new modelled into papers of verses"
1487,"MY LORD,",on several subjects. But he will have Ennius take the ground-work
1488,"MY LORD,","of satire from the first farces of the Romans, rather than from the"
1489,"MY LORD,","formed plays of Livius Andronicus, which were copied from the Grecian"
1490,"MY LORD,",comedies. It may possibly be so; but Dacier knows no more of it than
1491,"MY LORD,","I do. And it seems to me the more probable opinion, that he rather"
1492,"MY LORD,","imitated the fine railleries of the Greeks, which he saw in the pieces"
1493,"MY LORD,","of Andronicus, than the coarseness of his old countrymen, in their"
1494,"MY LORD,",clownish extemporary way of jeering.
1495,"MY LORD,",
1496,"MY LORD,","But besides this, it is universally granted, that Ennius, though an"
1497,"MY LORD,","Italian, was excellently learned in the Greek language. His verses"
1498,"MY LORD,","were stuffed with fragments of it, even to a fault; and he himself"
1499,"MY LORD,","believed, according to the Pythagorean opinion, that the soul of"
1500,"MY LORD,","Homer was transfused into him; which Persius observes, in his Sixth"
1501,"MY LORD,",Satire:--_Postquam destertuit esse Mæonides_. But this being only
1502,"MY LORD,","the private opinion of so inconsiderable a man as I am, I leave it to"
1503,"MY LORD,","the farther disquisition of the critics, if they think it worth their"
1504,"MY LORD,","notice. Most evident it is, that whether he imitated the Roman farce,"
1505,"MY LORD,","or the Greek comedies, he is to be acknowledged for the first author of"
1506,"MY LORD,","Roman satire, as it is properly so called, and distinguished from any"
1507,"MY LORD,",sort of stage-play.
1508,"MY LORD,",
1509,"MY LORD,","Of Pacuvius, who succeeded him, there is little to be said, because"
1510,"MY LORD,",there is so little remaining of him; only that he is taken to be
1511,"MY LORD,","the nephew of Ennius, his sister's son; that in probability he was"
1512,"MY LORD,","instructed by his uncle, in his way of satire, which we are told he has"
1513,"MY LORD,",copied: but what advances he made we know not.
1514,"MY LORD,",
1515,"MY LORD,","Lucilius came into the world, when Pacuvius flourished most. He also"
1516,"MY LORD,","made satires after the manner of Ennius, but he gave them a more"
1517,"MY LORD,","graceful turn, and endeavoured to imitate more closely the _vetus"
1518,"MY LORD,","comoedia_ of the Greeks, of the which the old original Roman satire had"
1519,"MY LORD,","no idea, till the time of Livius Andronicus. And though Horace seems"
1520,"MY LORD,",to have made Lucilius the first author of satire in verse amongst the
1521,"MY LORD,","Romans, in these words,--"
1522,"MY LORD,",
1523,"MY LORD,",----_Quid? cum est Lucilius ausus
1524,"MY LORD,","Primus in hunc, operis componere carmina morem_,--"
1525,"MY LORD,",
1526,"MY LORD,",he is only thus to be understood; that Lucilius had given a more
1527,"MY LORD,","graceful turn to the satire of Ennius and Pacuvius, not that he"
1528,"MY LORD,",invented a new satire of his own: and Quintilian seems to explain this
1529,"MY LORD,",passage of Horace in these words: _Satira quidem tota nostra est; in
1530,"MY LORD,",quâ primus insignem laudem adeptus est Lucilius_.
1531,"MY LORD,",
1532,"MY LORD,","Thus, both Horace and Quintilian give a kind of primacy of honour to"
1533,"MY LORD,","Lucilius, amongst the Latin satirists.[21] For, as the Roman language"
1534,"MY LORD,","grew more refined, so much more capable it was of receiving the"
1535,"MY LORD,","Grecian beauties, in his time. Horace and Quintilian could mean no"
1536,"MY LORD,","more, than that Lucilius writ better than Ennius and Pacuvius; and on"
1537,"MY LORD,",the same account we prefer Horace to Lucilius. Both of them imitated
1538,"MY LORD,",the old Greek comedy; and so did Ennius and Pacuvius before them. The
1539,"MY LORD,","polishing of the Latin tongue, in the succession of times, made the"
1540,"MY LORD,","only difference; and Horace himself, in two of his Satires, written"
1541,"MY LORD,","purposely on this subject, thinks the Romans of his age were too"
1542,"MY LORD,","partial in their commendations of Lucilius; who writ not only loosely,"
1543,"MY LORD,","and muddily, with little art, and much less care, but also in a time"
1544,"MY LORD,",when the Latin tongue was not yet sufficiently purged from the dregs of
1545,"MY LORD,","barbarism; and many significant and sounding words, which the Romans"
1546,"MY LORD,","wanted, were not admitted even in the times of Lucretius and Cicero, of"
1547,"MY LORD,",which both complain.
1548,"MY LORD,",
1549,"MY LORD,","But to proceed:--Dacier justly taxes Casaubon, saying, that the Satires"
1550,"MY LORD,","of Lucilius were wholly different in specie, from those of Ennius"
1551,"MY LORD,",and Pacuvius. Casaubon was led into that mistake by Diomedes the
1552,"MY LORD,","grammarian, who in effect says this: ""Satire amongst the Romans, but"
1553,"MY LORD,","not amongst the Greeks, was a biting invective poem, made after the"
1554,"MY LORD,","model of the ancient comedy, for the reprehension of vices; such as"
1555,"MY LORD,","were the poems of Lucilius, of Horace, and of Persius. But in former"
1556,"MY LORD,","times, the name of Satire was given to poems, which were composed of"
1557,"MY LORD,","several sorts of verses, such as were made by Ennius and Pacuvius;"
1558,"MY LORD,","more fully expressing the etymology of the word satire, from _satura_,"
1559,"MY LORD,","which we have observed."" Here it is manifest, that Diomedes makes a"
1560,"MY LORD,","specifical distinction betwixt the Satires of Ennius, and those of"
1561,"MY LORD,","Lucilius. But this, as we say in English, is only a distinction without"
1562,"MY LORD,","a difference; for the reason of it is ridiculous, and absolutely"
1563,"MY LORD,","false. This was that which cozened honest Casaubon, who, relying on"
1564,"MY LORD,","Diomedes, had not sufficiently examined the origin and nature of those"
1565,"MY LORD,","two satires; which were entirely the same, both in the matter and the"
1566,"MY LORD,","form: for all that Lucilius performed beyond his predecessors, Ennius"
1567,"MY LORD,","and Pacuvius, was only the adding of more politeness, and more salt,"
1568,"MY LORD,",without any change in the substance of the poem. And though Lucilius
1569,"MY LORD,","put not together in the same satire several sorts of verses, as Ennius"
1570,"MY LORD,","did, yet he composed several satires, of several sorts of verses, and"
1571,"MY LORD,","mingled them with Greek verses: one poem consisted only of hexameters,"
1572,"MY LORD,",and another was entirely of iambicks; a third of trochaicks; as is
1573,"MY LORD,","visible by the fragments yet remaining of his works. In short, if the"
1574,"MY LORD,",Satires of Lucilius are therefore said to be wholly different from
1575,"MY LORD,","those of Ennius, because he added much more of beauty and polishing"
1576,"MY LORD,","to his own poems, than are to be found in those before him, it will"
1577,"MY LORD,","follow from hence, that the Satires of Horace are wholly different from"
1578,"MY LORD,","those of Lucilius, because Horace has not less surpassed Lucilius in"
1579,"MY LORD,","the elegancy of his writing, than Lucilius surpassed Ennius in the turn"
1580,"MY LORD,","and ornament of his. This passage of Diomedes has also drawn Dousa, the"
1581,"MY LORD,","son, into the same error of Casaubon, which I say, not to expose the"
1582,"MY LORD,","little failings of those judicious men, but only to make it appear,"
1583,"MY LORD,","with how much diffidence and caution we are to read their works, when"
1584,"MY LORD,","they treat a subject of so much obscurity, and so very ancient, as is"
1585,"MY LORD,",this of satire.
1586,"MY LORD,",
1587,"MY LORD,",Having thus brought down the history of Satire from its original to
1588,"MY LORD,","the times of Horace, and shown the several changes of it, I should"
1589,"MY LORD,","here discover some of those graces which Horace added to it, but that"
1590,"MY LORD,","I think it will be more proper to defer that undertaking, till I make"
1591,"MY LORD,","the comparison betwixt him and Juvenal. In the mean while, following"
1592,"MY LORD,","the order of time, it will be necessary to say somewhat of another"
1593,"MY LORD,","kind of satire, which also was descended from the ancients; it is that"
1594,"MY LORD,","which we call the Varronian satire, (but which Varro himself calls the"
1595,"MY LORD,","Menippean,) because Varro, the most learned of the Romans, was the"
1596,"MY LORD,","first author of it, who imitated, in his works, the manner of Menippus"
1597,"MY LORD,","the Gadarenian, who professed the philosophy of the Cynicks."
1598,"MY LORD,",
1599,"MY LORD,","This sort of satire was not only composed of several sorts of verse,"
1600,"MY LORD,","like those of Ennius, but was also mixed with prose; and Greek was"
1601,"MY LORD,","sprinkled amongst the Latin. Quintilian, after he had spoken of the"
1602,"MY LORD,","satire of Lucilius, adds what follows; ""There is another and former"
1603,"MY LORD,","kind of satire, composed by Terentius Varro, the most learned of"
1604,"MY LORD,",the Romans; in which he was not satisfied alone with mingling in it
1605,"MY LORD,","several sorts of verse."" The only difficulty of this passage is,"
1606,"MY LORD,","that Quintilian tells us, that this satire of Varro was of a former"
1607,"MY LORD,","kind. For how can we possibly imagine this to be, since Varro, who"
1608,"MY LORD,","was contemporary to Cicero, must consequently be after Lucilius?"
1609,"MY LORD,","But Quintilian meant not, that the satire of Varro was in order of"
1610,"MY LORD,","time before Lucilius; he would only give us to understand, that the"
1611,"MY LORD,","Varronian satire, with mixture of several sorts of verses, was more"
1612,"MY LORD,","after the manner of Ennius and Pacuvius, than that of Lucilius, who was"
1613,"MY LORD,","more severe, and more correct; and gave himself less liberty in the"
1614,"MY LORD,",mixture of his verses in the same poem.
1615,"MY LORD,",
1616,"MY LORD,","We have nothing remaining of those Varronian satires, excepting some"
1617,"MY LORD,","inconsiderable fragments, and those for the most part much corrupted."
1618,"MY LORD,","The titles of many of them are indeed preserved, and they are generally"
1619,"MY LORD,","double; from whence, at least, we may understand, how many various"
1620,"MY LORD,","subjects were treated by that author. Tully, in his ""Academics,"""
1621,"MY LORD,",introduces Varro himself giving us some light concerning the scope and
1622,"MY LORD,","design of those works. Wherein, after he had shown his reasons why"
1623,"MY LORD,","he did not _ex professo_ write of philosophy, he adds what follows:"
1624,"MY LORD,","""Notwithstanding,"" says he, ""that those pieces of mine, wherein I have"
1625,"MY LORD,","imitated Menippus, though I have not translated him, are sprinkled"
1626,"MY LORD,","with a kind of mirth and gaiety, yet many things are there inserted,"
1627,"MY LORD,","which are drawn from the very entrails of philosophy, and many things"
1628,"MY LORD,","severely argued; which I have mingled with pleasantries on purpose,"
1629,"MY LORD,",that they may more easily go down with the common sort of unlearned
1630,"MY LORD,","readers."" The rest of the sentence is so lame, that we can only make"
1631,"MY LORD,","thus much out of it,--that in the composition of his satires, he so"
1632,"MY LORD,","tempered philology with philosophy, that his work was a mixture of"
1633,"MY LORD,","them both.[22] And Tully himself confirms us in this opinion, when a"
1634,"MY LORD,","little after he addresses himself to Varro in these words:--""And you"
1635,"MY LORD,",yourself have composed a most elegant and complete poem; you have
1636,"MY LORD,","begun philosophy in many places; sufficient to incite us, though too"
1637,"MY LORD,","little to instruct us."" Thus it appears, that Varro was one of those"
1638,"MY LORD,","writers whom they called #spoudogeloioi#, studious of laughter; and"
1639,"MY LORD,","that, as learned as he was, his business was more to divert his reader,"
1640,"MY LORD,",than to teach him. And he entitled his own satires--Menippean; not
1641,"MY LORD,","that Menippus had written any satires, (for his were either dialogues"
1642,"MY LORD,","or epistles,) but that Varro imitated his style, his manner, his"
1643,"MY LORD,","facetiousness. All that we know farther of Menippus and his writings,"
1644,"MY LORD,","which are wholly lost, is, that by some he is esteemed, as, amongst"
1645,"MY LORD,","the rest, by Varro; by others he is noted of cynical impudence, and"
1646,"MY LORD,","obscenity: that he was much given to those parodies, which I have"
1647,"MY LORD,","already mentioned; that is, he often quoted the verses of Homer and the"
1648,"MY LORD,","tragic poets, and turned their serious meaning into something that"
1649,"MY LORD,","was ridiculous; whereas Varro's satires are by Tully called absolute,"
1650,"MY LORD,","and most elegant, and various poems. Lucian, who was emulous of this"
1651,"MY LORD,","Menippus, seems to have imitated both his manners and his style in"
1652,"MY LORD,",many of his dialogues; where Menippus himself is often introduced as a
1653,"MY LORD,","speaker in them, and as a perpetual buffoon; particularly his character"
1654,"MY LORD,","is expressed in the beginning of that dialogue, which is called"
1655,"MY LORD,","#Nekyomantia#. But Varro, in imitating him, avoids his impudence and"
1656,"MY LORD,","filthiness, and only expresses his witty pleasantry."
1657,"MY LORD,",
1658,"MY LORD,","This we may believe for certain,--that as his subjects were various, so"
1659,"MY LORD,",most of them were tales or stories of his own invention. Which is also
1660,"MY LORD,","manifest from antiquity, by those authors who are acknowledged to have"
1661,"MY LORD,","written Varronian satires, in imitation of his; of whom the chief is"
1662,"MY LORD,","Petronius Arbiter, whose satire, they say, is now printed in Holland,"
1663,"MY LORD,","wholly recovered, and made complete: when it is made public, it will"
1664,"MY LORD,","easily be seen by any one sentence, whether it be supposititious, or"
1665,"MY LORD,",genuine.[23] Many of Lucian's dialogues may also properly be called
1666,"MY LORD,","Varronian satires, particularly his True History; and consequently the"
1667,"MY LORD,","""Golden Ass"" of Apuleius, which is taken from him. Of the same stamp"
1668,"MY LORD,","is the mock deification of Claudius, by Seneca: and the Symposium or"
1669,"MY LORD,","""Cæsars"" of Julian, the Emperor. Amongst the moderns, we may reckon"
1670,"MY LORD,","the ""Encomium Moriæ"" of Erasmus, Barclay's ""Euphormio,"" and a volume"
1671,"MY LORD,","of German authors, which my ingenious friend, Mr Charles Killegrew,"
1672,"MY LORD,","once lent me.[24] In the English, I remember none which are mixed with"
1673,"MY LORD,","prose, as Varro's were; but of the same kind is ""Mother Hubbard's Tale"""
1674,"MY LORD,","in Spenser; and (if it be not too vain to mention any thing of my own,)"
1675,"MY LORD,","the poems of ""Absalom"" and ""Mac Flecnoe.""[25]"
1676,"MY LORD,",
1677,"MY LORD,","This is what I have to say in general of satire: only, as Dacier has"
1678,"MY LORD,","observed before me, we may take notice, that the word satire is of a"
1679,"MY LORD,","more general signification in Latin, than in French, or English. For"
1680,"MY LORD,",amongst the Romans it was not only used for those discourses which
1681,"MY LORD,","decried vice, or exposed folly, but for others also, where virtue was"
1682,"MY LORD,",recommended. But in our modern languages we apply it only to invective
1683,"MY LORD,","poems, where the very name of satire is formidable to those persons,"
1684,"MY LORD,",who would appear to the world what they are not in themselves; for in
1685,"MY LORD,","English, to say satire, is to mean reflection, as we use that word in"
1686,"MY LORD,","the worst sense; or as the French call it, more properly, _medisance_."
1687,"MY LORD,","In the criticism of spelling, it ought to be with _i_, and not with"
1688,"MY LORD,","_y_, to distinguish its true derivation from _satura_, not from"
1689,"MY LORD,","_satyrus_. And if this be so, then it is false spelled throughout this"
1690,"MY LORD,",book; for here it is written SATYR: which having not considered at
1691,"MY LORD,","the first, I thought it not worth correcting afterwards. But the French"
1692,"MY LORD,","are more nice, and never spell it any other way than SATIRE."
1693,"MY LORD,",
1694,"MY LORD,","I am now arrived at the most difficult part of my undertaking, which"
1695,"MY LORD,","is, to compare Horace with Juvenal and Persius. It is observed by"
1696,"MY LORD,","Rigaltius, in his preface before Juvenal, written to Thuanus, that"
1697,"MY LORD,","these three poets have all their particular partisans, and favourers."
1698,"MY LORD,","Every commentator, as he has taken pains with any of them, thinks"
1699,"MY LORD,",himself obliged to prefer his author to the other two; to find out
1700,"MY LORD,","their failings, and decry them, that he may make room for his own"
1701,"MY LORD,","darling.[26] Such is the partiality of mankind, to set up that interest"
1702,"MY LORD,","which they have once espoused, though it be to the prejudice of truth,"
1703,"MY LORD,","morality, and common justice; and especially in the productions of the"
1704,"MY LORD,","brain. As authors generally think themselves the best poets, because"
1705,"MY LORD,",they cannot go out of themselves to judge sincerely of their betters;
1706,"MY LORD,","so it is with critics, who, having first taken a liking to one of these"
1707,"MY LORD,","poets, proceed to comment on him, and to illustrate him; after which,"
1708,"MY LORD,","they fall in love with their own labours, to that degree of blind"
1709,"MY LORD,","fondness, that at length they defend and exalt their author, not so"
1710,"MY LORD,","much for his sake as for their own. It is a folly of the same nature,"
1711,"MY LORD,","with that of the Romans themselves, in the games of the Circus. The"
1712,"MY LORD,","spectators were divided in their factions, betwixt the Veneti and the"
1713,"MY LORD,","Prasini; some were for the charioteer in blue, and some for him in"
1714,"MY LORD,",green. The colours themselves were but a fancy; but when once a man
1715,"MY LORD,","had taken pains to set out those of his party, and had been at the"
1716,"MY LORD,","trouble of procuring voices for them, the case was altered; he was"
1717,"MY LORD,","concerned for his own labour, and that so earnestly, that disputes and"
1718,"MY LORD,","quarrels, animosities, commotions, and bloodshed, often happened; and"
1719,"MY LORD,","in the declension of the Grecian empire, the very sovereigns themselves"
1720,"MY LORD,","engaged in it, even when the barbarians were at their doors; and"
1721,"MY LORD,","stickled for the preference of colours, when the safety of their people"
1722,"MY LORD,",was in question. I am now myself on the brink of the same precipice;
1723,"MY LORD,",I have spent some time on the translation of Juvenal and Persius; and
1724,"MY LORD,","it behoves me to be wary, lest, for that reason, I should be partial"
1725,"MY LORD,","to them, or take a prejudice against Horace. Yet, on the other side,"
1726,"MY LORD,","I would not be like some of our judges, who would give the cause for"
1727,"MY LORD,","a poor man, right or wrong; for though that be an error on the better"
1728,"MY LORD,","hand, yet it is still a partiality: and a rich man, unheard, cannot"
1729,"MY LORD,",be concluded an oppressor. I remember a saying of King Charles II. on
1730,"MY LORD,","Sir Matthew Hale, (who was doubtless an uncorrupt and upright man,)"
1731,"MY LORD,","that his servants were sure to be cast on a trial, which was heard"
1732,"MY LORD,","before him; not that he thought the judge was possibly to be bribed,"
1733,"MY LORD,",but that his integrity might be too scrupulous; and that the causes of
1734,"MY LORD,","the crown were always suspicious, when the privileges of subjects were"
1735,"MY LORD,",concerned.[27]
1736,"MY LORD,",
1737,"MY LORD,","It had been much fairer, if the modern critics, who have embarked in"
1738,"MY LORD,","the quarrels of their favourite authors, had rather given to each"
1739,"MY LORD,","his proper due; without taking from another's heap, to raise their"
1740,"MY LORD,","own. There is praise enough for each of them in particular, without"
1741,"MY LORD,","encroaching on his fellows, and detracting from them, or enriching"
1742,"MY LORD,",themselves with the spoils of others. But to come to particulars.
1743,"MY LORD,","Heinsius and Dacier are the most principal of those, who raise Horace"
1744,"MY LORD,","above Juvenal and Persius. Scaliger the father, Rigaltius, and many"
1745,"MY LORD,","others, debase Horace, that they may set up Juvenal; and Casaubon,[28]"
1746,"MY LORD,","who is almost single, throws dirt on Juvenal and Horace, that he may"
1747,"MY LORD,","exalt Persius, whom he understood particularly well, and better than"
1748,"MY LORD,","any of his former commentators; even Stelluti, who succeeded him. I"
1749,"MY LORD,","will begin with him, who, in my opinion, defends the weakest cause,"
1750,"MY LORD,","which is that of Persius; and labouring, as Tacitus professes of his"
1751,"MY LORD,","own writing, to divest myself of partiality, or prejudice, consider"
1752,"MY LORD,","Persius, not as a poet whom I have wholly translated, and who has cost"
1753,"MY LORD,","me more labour and time than Juvenal, but according to what I judge"
1754,"MY LORD,","to be his own merit; which I think not equal, in the main, to that of"
1755,"MY LORD,","Juvenal or Horace, and yet in some things to be preferred to both of"
1756,"MY LORD,",them.
1757,"MY LORD,",
1758,"MY LORD,","First, then, for the verse; neither Casaubon himself, nor any for him,"
1759,"MY LORD,","can defend either his numbers, or the purity of his Latin. Casaubon"
1760,"MY LORD,","gives this point for lost, and pretends not to justify either the"
1761,"MY LORD,","measures, or the words of Persius; he is evidently beneath Horace and"
1762,"MY LORD,",Juvenal in both.
1763,"MY LORD,",
1764,"MY LORD,","Then, as his verse is scabrous, and hobbling, and his words not every"
1765,"MY LORD,","where well chosen, the purity of Latin being more corrupted than in"
1766,"MY LORD,","the time of Juvenal,[29] and consequently of Horace, who writ when"
1767,"MY LORD,","the language was in the height of its perfection, so his diction is"
1768,"MY LORD,","hard, his figures are generally too bold and daring, and his tropes,"
1769,"MY LORD,","particularly his metaphors, insufferably strained."
1770,"MY LORD,",
1771,"MY LORD,","In the third place, notwithstanding all the diligence of Casaubon,"
1772,"MY LORD,","Stelluti, and a Scotch gentleman,[30] whom I have heard extremely"
1773,"MY LORD,","commended for his illustrations of him, yet he is still obscure:"
1774,"MY LORD,","whether he affected not to be understood, but with difficulty; or"
1775,"MY LORD,",whether the fear of his safety under Nero compelled him to this
1776,"MY LORD,",darkness in some places; or that it was occasioned by his close way of
1777,"MY LORD,","thinking, and the brevity of his style, and crowding of his figures;"
1778,"MY LORD,","or lastly, whether, after so long a time, many of his words have been"
1779,"MY LORD,","corrupted, and many customs, and stories relating to them, lost to"
1780,"MY LORD,","us: whether some of these reasons, or all, concurred to render him so"
1781,"MY LORD,","cloudy, we may be bold to affirm, that the best of commentators can but"
1782,"MY LORD,","guess at his meaning, in many passages; and none can be certain that he"
1783,"MY LORD,",has divined rightly.
1784,"MY LORD,",
1785,"MY LORD,","After all, he was a young man, like his friend and contemporary Lucan;"
1786,"MY LORD,","both of them men of extraordinary parts, and great acquired knowledge,"
1787,"MY LORD,",considering their youth:[31] But neither of them had arrived to that
1788,"MY LORD,","maturity of judgment, which is necessary to the accomplishing of a"
1789,"MY LORD,","formed poet. And this consideration, as, on the one hand, it lays"
1790,"MY LORD,","some imperfections to their charge, so, on the other side, it is a"
1791,"MY LORD,","candid excuse for those failings, which are incident to youth and"
1792,"MY LORD,","inexperience; and we have more reason to wonder how they, who died"
1793,"MY LORD,","before the thirtieth year of their age, could write so well, and think"
1794,"MY LORD,","so strongly, than to accuse them of those faults, from which human"
1795,"MY LORD,","nature, and more especially in youth, can never possibly be exempted."
1796,"MY LORD,",
1797,"MY LORD,",To consider Persius yet more closely: he rather insulted over vice and
1798,"MY LORD,","folly, than exposed them, like Juvenal and Horace; and as chaste and"
1799,"MY LORD,","modest as he is esteemed, it cannot be denied, but that in some places"
1800,"MY LORD,","he is broad and fulsome, as the latter verses of the fourth Satire, and"
1801,"MY LORD,","of the sixth, sufficiently witnessed. And it is to be believed that he"
1802,"MY LORD,","who commits the same crime often, and without necessity, cannot but do"
1803,"MY LORD,",it with some kind of pleasure.
1804,"MY LORD,",
1805,"MY LORD,","To come to a conclusion: he is manifestly below Horace, because he"
1806,"MY LORD,",borrows most of his greatest beauties from him; and Casaubon is so far
1807,"MY LORD,","from denying this, that he has written a treatise purposely concerning"
1808,"MY LORD,","it; wherein he shews a multitude of his translations from Horace, and"
1809,"MY LORD,","his imitations of him, for the credit of his author; which he calls"
1810,"MY LORD,",_Imitatio Horatiana_.[32]
1811,"MY LORD,",
1812,"MY LORD,","To these defects, which I casually observed, while I was translating"
1813,"MY LORD,","this author, Scaliger has added others; he calls him, in plain terms, a"
1814,"MY LORD,","silly writer, and a trifler, full of ostentation of his learning, and,"
1815,"MY LORD,","after all, unworthy to come into competition with Juvenal and Horace."
1816,"MY LORD,",
1817,"MY LORD,","After such terrible accusations, it is time to hear what his patron"
1818,"MY LORD,","Casaubon can allege in his defence. Instead of answering, he excuses"
1819,"MY LORD,","for the most part; and, when he cannot, accuses others of the same"
1820,"MY LORD,","crimes. He deals with Scaliger, as a modest scholar with a master."
1821,"MY LORD,","He compliments him with so much reverence, that one would swear he"
1822,"MY LORD,",feared him as much at least as he respected him. Scaliger will not
1823,"MY LORD,",allow Persius to have any wit; Casaubon interprets this in the mildest
1824,"MY LORD,","sense, and confesses his author was not good at turning things into"
1825,"MY LORD,","a pleasant ridicule; or, in other words, that he was not a laughable"
1826,"MY LORD,","writer. That he was _ineptus_, indeed, but that was _non aptissimus"
1827,"MY LORD,","ad jocandum_; but that he was ostentatious of his learning, that, by"
1828,"MY LORD,","Scaliger's good favour, he denies. Persius shewed his learning, but"
1829,"MY LORD,","was no boaster of it; he did _ostendere_, but not _ostentare_; and so,"
1830,"MY LORD,","he says, did Scaliger:--where, methinks, Casaubon turns it handsomely"
1831,"MY LORD,","upon that supercilious critic, and silently insinuates that he himself"
1832,"MY LORD,","was sufficiently vain-glorious, and a boaster of his own knowledge. All"
1833,"MY LORD,","the writings of this venerable censor, continues Casaubon, which are"
1834,"MY LORD,","#chrysou chrysotera#, more golden than gold itself, are every where"
1835,"MY LORD,","smelling of that thyme, which, like a bee, he has gathered from ancient"
1836,"MY LORD,",authors; but far be ostentation and vain-glory from a gentleman so
1837,"MY LORD,","well born, and so nobly educated as Scaliger. But, says Scaliger, he"
1838,"MY LORD,","is so obscure, that he has got himself the name of Scotinus, a dark"
1839,"MY LORD,","writer; now, says Casaubon, it is a wonder to me that any thing could"
1840,"MY LORD,","be obscure to the divine wit of Scaliger, from which nothing could"
1841,"MY LORD,","be hidden. This is indeed a strong compliment, but no defence; and"
1842,"MY LORD,","Casaubon, who could not but be sensible of his author's blind side,"
1843,"MY LORD,",thinks it time to abandon a post that was untenable. He acknowledges
1844,"MY LORD,","that Persius is obscure in some places; but so is Plato, so is"
1845,"MY LORD,","Thucydides; so are Pindar, Theocritus, and Aristophanes, amongst the"
1846,"MY LORD,","Greek poets; and even Horace and Juvenal, he might have added, amongst"
1847,"MY LORD,","the Romans. The truth is, Persius is not sometimes, but generally,"
1848,"MY LORD,","obscure; and therefore Casaubon, at last, is forced to excuse him,"
1849,"MY LORD,","by alledging that it was _se defendendo_, for fear of Nero; and that"
1850,"MY LORD,","he was commanded to write so cloudily by Cornutus,[33] in virtue of"
1851,"MY LORD,",holy obedience to his master. I cannot help my own opinion; I think
1852,"MY LORD,",Cornutus needed not to have read many lectures to him on that subject.
1853,"MY LORD,",Persius was an apt scholar; and when he was bidden to be obscure in
1854,"MY LORD,","some places, where his life and safety were in question, took the"
1855,"MY LORD,",same counsel for all his books; and never afterwards wrote ten lines
1856,"MY LORD,","together clearly. Casaubon, being upon this chapter, has not failed,"
1857,"MY LORD,","we may be sure, of making a compliment to his own dear comment. If"
1858,"MY LORD,","Persius, says he, be in himself obscure, yet my interpretation has"
1859,"MY LORD,",made him intelligible. There is no question but he deserves that
1860,"MY LORD,","praise, which he has given to himself; but the nature of the thing, as"
1861,"MY LORD,","Lucretius says, will not admit of a perfect explanation. Besides many"
1862,"MY LORD,","examples which I could urge, the very last verse of his last satire,"
1863,"MY LORD,","upon which he particularly values himself in his preface, is not yet"
1864,"MY LORD,","sufficiently explicated. It is true, Holyday has endeavoured to"
1865,"MY LORD,","justify his construction; but Stelluti is against it; and, for my part,"
1866,"MY LORD,",I can have but a very dark notion of it. As for the chastity of his
1867,"MY LORD,","thoughts, Casaubon denies not but that one particular passage, in the"
1868,"MY LORD,","fourth satire, _At si unctus cesses_, &c. is not only the most obscure,"
1869,"MY LORD,",but the most obscene of all his works. I understood it; but for that
1870,"MY LORD,","reason turned it over. In defence of his boisterous metaphors, he"
1871,"MY LORD,","quotes Longinus, who accounts them as instruments of the sublime; fit"
1872,"MY LORD,","to move and stir up the affections, particularly in narration. To which"
1873,"MY LORD,","it may be replied, that where the trope is far fetched and hard, it is"
1874,"MY LORD,",fit for nothing but to puzzle the understanding; and may be reckoned
1875,"MY LORD,","amongst those things of Demosthenes which Æschines called #thaumata#,"
1876,"MY LORD,","not #rhêmata#, that is, prodigies, not words. It must be granted to"
1877,"MY LORD,","Casaubon, that the knowledge of many things is lost in our modern ages,"
1878,"MY LORD,",which were of familiar notice to the ancients; and that satire is a
1879,"MY LORD,","poem of a difficult nature in itself, and is not written to vulgar"
1880,"MY LORD,","readers: and through the relation which it has to comedy, the frequent"
1881,"MY LORD,","change of persons makes the sense perplexed, when we can but divine who"
1882,"MY LORD,","it is that speaks; whether Persius himself, or his friend and monitor;"
1883,"MY LORD,","or, in some places, a third person. But Casaubon comes back always to"
1884,"MY LORD,","himself, and concludes, that if Persius had not been obscure, there had"
1885,"MY LORD,",been no need of him for an interpreter. Yet when he had once enjoined
1886,"MY LORD,","himself so hard a task, he then considered the Greek proverb, that he"
1887,"MY LORD,","must #chelônes phagein ê mê phagein#, either eat the whole snail, or"
1888,"MY LORD,","let it quite alone; and so he went through with his laborious task, as"
1889,"MY LORD,",I have done with my difficult translation.
1890,"MY LORD,",
1891,"MY LORD,","Thus far, my lord, you see it has gone very hard with Persius: I"
1892,"MY LORD,",think he cannot be allowed to stand in competition either with Juvenal
1893,"MY LORD,","or Horace. Yet for once I will venture to be so vain, as to affirm,"
1894,"MY LORD,","that none of his hard metaphors, or forced expressions, are in my"
1895,"MY LORD,","translation. But more of this in its proper place, where I shall say"
1896,"MY LORD,","somewhat in particular, of our general performance, in making these"
1897,"MY LORD,","two authors English. In the mean time, I think myself obliged to give"
1898,"MY LORD,","Persius his undoubted due, and to acquaint the world, with Casaubon, in"
1899,"MY LORD,","what he has equalled, and in what excelled, his two competitors."
1900,"MY LORD,",
1901,"MY LORD,","A man who is resolved to praise an author, with any appearance of"
1902,"MY LORD,","justice, must be sure to take him on the strongest side, and where"
1903,"MY LORD,",he is least liable to exceptions. He is therefore obliged to chuse
1904,"MY LORD,","his mediums accordingly. Casaubon, who saw that Persius could not"
1905,"MY LORD,","laugh with a becoming grace, that he was not made for jesting, and"
1906,"MY LORD,","that a merry conceit was not his talent, turned his feather, like an"
1907,"MY LORD,","Indian, to another light, that he might give it the better gloss."
1908,"MY LORD,","Moral doctrine, says he, and urbanity, or well-mannered wit, are the"
1909,"MY LORD,","two things which constitute the Roman satire; but of the two, that"
1910,"MY LORD,","which is most essential to this poem, and is, as it were, the very"
1911,"MY LORD,","soul which animates it, is the scourging of vice, and exhortation to"
1912,"MY LORD,","virtue. Thus wit, for a good reason, is already almost out of doors;"
1913,"MY LORD,","and allowed only for an instrument, a kind of tool, or a weapon, as"
1914,"MY LORD,","he calls it, of which the satirist makes use in the compassing of his"
1915,"MY LORD,",design. The end and aim of our three rivals is consequently the same.
1916,"MY LORD,","But by what methods they have prosecuted their intention, is farther to"
1917,"MY LORD,","be considered. Satire is of the nature of moral philosophy, as being"
1918,"MY LORD,","instructive: he, therefore, who instructs most usefully, will carry"
1919,"MY LORD,",the palm from his two antagonists. The philosophy in which Persius
1920,"MY LORD,","was educated, and which he professes through his whole book, is the"
1921,"MY LORD,","Stoick; the most noble, most generous, most beneficial to human kind,"
1922,"MY LORD,","amongst all the sects, who have given us the rules of ethics, thereby"
1923,"MY LORD,",to form a severe virtue in the soul; to raise in us an undaunted
1924,"MY LORD,",courage against the assaults of fortune; to esteem as nothing the
1925,"MY LORD,","things that are without us, because they are not in our power; not to"
1926,"MY LORD,","value riches, beauty, honours, fame, or health, any farther than as"
1927,"MY LORD,","conveniencies, and so many helps to living as we ought, and doing good"
1928,"MY LORD,","in our generation: in short, to be always happy, while we possess our"
1929,"MY LORD,","minds with a good conscience, are free from the slavery of vices, and"
1930,"MY LORD,",conform our actions and conversations to the rules of right reason.
1931,"MY LORD,","See here, my lord, an epitome of Epictetus; the doctrine of Zeno, and"
1932,"MY LORD,","the education of our Persius: and this he expressed, not only in all"
1933,"MY LORD,","his satires, but in the manner of his life. I will not lessen this"
1934,"MY LORD,","commendation of the Stoick philosophy, by giving you an account of"
1935,"MY LORD,","some absurdities in their doctrine, and some perhaps impieties, if we"
1936,"MY LORD,",consider them by the standard of christian faith. Persius has fallen
1937,"MY LORD,",into none of them; and therefore is free from those imputations. What
1938,"MY LORD,","he teaches might be taught from pulpits, with more profit to the"
1939,"MY LORD,","audience, than all the nice speculations of divinity, and controversies"
1940,"MY LORD,","concerning faith; which are more for the profit of the shepherd, than"
1941,"MY LORD,","for the edification of the flock. Passions, interest, ambition, and all"
1942,"MY LORD,","their bloody consequences of discord, and of war, are banished from"
1943,"MY LORD,",this doctrine. Here is nothing proposed but the quiet and tranquillity
1944,"MY LORD,","of the mind; virtue lodged at home, and afterwards diffused in her"
1945,"MY LORD,","general effects, to the improvement and good of human kind. And"
1946,"MY LORD,",therefore I wonder not that the present Bishop of Salisbury[34] has
1947,"MY LORD,","recommended this our author, and the Tenth Satire of Juvenal, in his"
1948,"MY LORD,","Pastoral Letter, to the serious perusal and practice of the divines"
1949,"MY LORD,","in his diocese, as the best common-places for their sermons, as the"
1950,"MY LORD,","store-houses and magazines of moral virtues, from whence they may"
1951,"MY LORD,","draw out, as they have occasion, all manner of assistance for the"
1952,"MY LORD,","accomplishment of a virtuous life, which the stoicks have assigned"
1953,"MY LORD,","for the great end and perfection of mankind. Herein then it is, that"
1954,"MY LORD,",Persius has excelled both Juvenal and Horace. He sticks to his own
1955,"MY LORD,","philosophy; he shifts not sides, like Horace, who is sometimes an"
1956,"MY LORD,","Epicurean, sometimes a Stoick, sometimes an Eclectic, as his present"
1957,"MY LORD,","humour leads him; nor declaims like Juvenal against vices, more like an"
1958,"MY LORD,","orator, than a philosopher. Persius is every where the same; true to"
1959,"MY LORD,","the dogmas of his master. What he has learnt, he teaches vehemently;"
1960,"MY LORD,","and what he teaches, that he practises himself. There is a spirit of"
1961,"MY LORD,","sincerity in all he says; you may easily discern that he is in earnest,"
1962,"MY LORD,",and is persuaded of that truth which he inculcates. In this I am of
1963,"MY LORD,","opinion that he excels Horace, who is commonly in jest, and laughs"
1964,"MY LORD,","while he instructs; and is equal to Juvenal, who was as honest and"
1965,"MY LORD,","serious as Persius, and more he could not be."
1966,"MY LORD,",
1967,"MY LORD,","Hitherto I have followed Casaubon, and enlarged upon him, because I"
1968,"MY LORD,",am satisfied that he says no more than truth; the rest is almost all
1969,"MY LORD,","frivolous. For he says that Horace, being the son of a tax-gatherer,"
1970,"MY LORD,","or a collector, as we call it, smells every where of the meanness of"
1971,"MY LORD,","his birth and education: his conceipts are vulgar, like the subjects"
1972,"MY LORD,","of his satires; that he does _plebeium sapere_, and writes not with"
1973,"MY LORD,","that elevation, which becomes a satirist: that Persius, being nobly"
1974,"MY LORD,","born, and of an opulent family, had likewise the advantage of a better"
1975,"MY LORD,","master; Cornutus being the most learned of his time, a man of the most"
1976,"MY LORD,","holy life, the chief of the Stoick sect at Rome, and not only a great"
1977,"MY LORD,","philosopher, but a poet himself, and in probability a coadjutor of"
1978,"MY LORD,","Persius: that, as for Juvenal, he was long a declaimer, came late to"
1979,"MY LORD,","poetry, and has not been much conversant in philosophy."
1980,"MY LORD,",
1981,"MY LORD,","It is granted that the father of Horace was _libertinus_, that is, one"
1982,"MY LORD,","degree removed from his grandfather, who had been once a slave. But"
1983,"MY LORD,","Horace, speaking of him, gives him the best character of a father,"
1984,"MY LORD,","which I ever read in history; and I wish a witty friend of mine, now"
1985,"MY LORD,","living, had such another.[35] He bred him in the best school, and with"
1986,"MY LORD,","the best company of young noblemen; and Horace, by his gratitude to his"
1987,"MY LORD,","memory, gives a certain testimony that his education was ingenuous."
1988,"MY LORD,","After this, he formed himself abroad, by the conversation of great"
1989,"MY LORD,","men. Brutus found him at Athens, and was so pleased with him, that he"
1990,"MY LORD,","took him thence into the army, and made him _tribunus militum_, a"
1991,"MY LORD,","colonel in a legion, which was the preferment of an old soldier. All"
1992,"MY LORD,","this was before his acquaintance with Mecænas, and his introduction"
1993,"MY LORD,","into the court of Augustus, and the familiarity of that great emperor;"
1994,"MY LORD,","which, had he not been well-bred before, had been enough to civilize"
1995,"MY LORD,","his conversation, and render him accomplished and knowing in all the"
1996,"MY LORD,","arts of complacency and good behaviour; and, in short, an agreeable"
1997,"MY LORD,","companion for the retired hours and privacies of a favourite, who"
1998,"MY LORD,","was first minister. So that, upon the whole matter, Persius may be"
1999,"MY LORD,","acknowledged to be equal with him in those respects, though better"
2000,"MY LORD,","born, and Juvenal inferior to both. If the advantage be any where,"
2001,"MY LORD,",it is on the side of Horace; as much as the court of Augustus Cæsar
2002,"MY LORD,","was superior to that of Nero. As for the subjects which they treated,"
2003,"MY LORD,","it will appear hereafter, that Horace writ not vulgarly on vulgar"
2004,"MY LORD,","subjects, nor always chose them. His style is constantly accommodated"
2005,"MY LORD,","to his subject, either high or low. If his fault be too much lowness,"
2006,"MY LORD,","that of Persius is the fault of the hardness of his metaphors, and"
2007,"MY LORD,",obscurity: and so they are equal in the failings of their style; where
2008,"MY LORD,",Juvenal manifestly triumphs over both of them.
2009,"MY LORD,",
2010,"MY LORD,",The comparison betwixt Horace and Juvenal is more difficult; because
2011,"MY LORD,","their forces were more equal. A dispute has always been, and ever will"
2012,"MY LORD,","continue, betwixt the favourers of the two poets. _Non nostrum est"
2013,"MY LORD,","tantas componere lites._ I shall only venture to give my own opinion,"
2014,"MY LORD,",and leave it for better judges to determine. If it be only argued in
2015,"MY LORD,","general, which of them was the better poet, the victory is already"
2016,"MY LORD,",gained on the side of Horace. Virgil himself must yield to him in the
2017,"MY LORD,","delicacy of his turns, his choice of words, and perhaps the purity"
2018,"MY LORD,","of his Latin. He who says that Pindar is inimitable, is himself"
2019,"MY LORD,",inimitable in his Odes. But the contention betwixt these two great
2020,"MY LORD,","masters, is for the prize of Satire; in which controversy, all the Odes"
2021,"MY LORD,","and Epodes of Horace are to stand excluded. I say this, because Horace"
2022,"MY LORD,","has written many of them satyrically, against his private enemies; yet"
2023,"MY LORD,","these, if justly considered, are somewhat of the nature of the Greek"
2024,"MY LORD,","Silli, which were invectives against particular sects and persons. But"
2025,"MY LORD,","Horace has purged himself of this choler, before he entered on those"
2026,"MY LORD,","discourses, which are more properly called the Roman Satire. He has"
2027,"MY LORD,","not now to do with a Lyce, a Canidia, a Cassius Severus, or a Menas;"
2028,"MY LORD,","but is to correct the vices and the follies of his time, and to give"
2029,"MY LORD,","the rules of a happy and virtuous life. In a word, that former sort"
2030,"MY LORD,","of satire, which is known in England by the name of lampoon, is a"
2031,"MY LORD,","dangerous sort of weapon, and for the most part unlawful. We have no"
2032,"MY LORD,",moral right on the reputation of other men. It is taking from them
2033,"MY LORD,","what we cannot restore to them. There are only two reasons, for which"
2034,"MY LORD,",we may be permitted to write lampoons; and I will not promise that
2035,"MY LORD,","they can always justify us. The first is revenge, when we have been"
2036,"MY LORD,","affronted in the same nature, or have been any ways notoriously abused,"
2037,"MY LORD,","and can make ourselves no other reparation. And yet we know, that, in"
2038,"MY LORD,","christian charity, all offences are to be forgiven, as we expect the"
2039,"MY LORD,",like pardon for those which we daily commit against Almighty God. And
2040,"MY LORD,",this consideration has often made me tremble when I was saying our
2041,"MY LORD,",Saviour's prayer; for the plain condition of the forgiveness which we
2042,"MY LORD,","beg, is the pardoning of others the offences which they have done to"
2043,"MY LORD,",us; for which reason I have many times avoided the commission of that
2044,"MY LORD,","fault, even when I have been notoriously provoked. Let not this, my"
2045,"MY LORD,","lord, pass for vanity in me; for it is truth. More libels have been"
2046,"MY LORD,","written against me, than almost any man now living; and I had reason"
2047,"MY LORD,","on my side, to have defended my own innocence. I speak not of my"
2048,"MY LORD,","poetry, which I have wholly given up to the critics: let them use it"
2049,"MY LORD,","as they please: posterity, perhaps, may be more favourable to me; for"
2050,"MY LORD,","interest and passion will lie buried in another age, and partiality"
2051,"MY LORD,","and prejudice be forgotten. I speak of my morals, which have been"
2052,"MY LORD,",sufficiently aspersed: that only sort of reputation ought to be dear
2053,"MY LORD,","to every honest man, and is to me. But let the world witness for me,"
2054,"MY LORD,",that I have been often wanting to myself in that particular; I have
2055,"MY LORD,","seldom answered any scurrilous lampoon, when it was in my power to have"
2056,"MY LORD,","exposed my enemies: and, being naturally vindicative, have suffered in"
2057,"MY LORD,","silence, and possessed my soul in quiet."
2058,"MY LORD,",
2059,"MY LORD,","Any thing, though never so little, which a man speaks of himself, in"
2060,"MY LORD,","my opinion, is still too much; and therefore I will wave this subject,"
2061,"MY LORD,",and proceed to give the second reason which may justify a poet when he
2062,"MY LORD,","writes against a particular person; and that is, when he is become a"
2063,"MY LORD,","public nuisance. All those, whom Horace in his Satires, and Persius and"
2064,"MY LORD,","Juvenal have mentioned in theirs, with a brand of infamy, are wholly"
2065,"MY LORD,",such. It is an action of virtue to make examples of vicious men. They
2066,"MY LORD,",may and ought to be upbraided with their crimes and follies; both for
2067,"MY LORD,","their amendment, if they are not yet incorrigible, and for the terror"
2068,"MY LORD,","of others, to hinder them from falling into those enormities, which"
2069,"MY LORD,",they see are so severely punished in the persons of others. The first
2070,"MY LORD,",reason was only an excuse for revenge; but this second is absolutely
2071,"MY LORD,","of a poet's office to perform: but how few lampooners are now living,"
2072,"MY LORD,","who are capable of this duty![36] When they come in my way, it is"
2073,"MY LORD,","impossible sometimes to avoid reading them. But, good God! how remote"
2074,"MY LORD,","they are, in common justice, from the choice of such persons as are the"
2075,"MY LORD,",proper subject of satire! And how little wit they bring for the support
2076,"MY LORD,",of their injustice! The weaker sex is their most ordinary theme; and
2077,"MY LORD,",the best and fairest are sure to be the most severely handled. Amongst
2078,"MY LORD,","men, those who are prosperously unjust, are entitled to panegyric; but"
2079,"MY LORD,",afflicted virtue is insolently stabbed with all manner of reproaches;
2080,"MY LORD,","no decency is considered, no fulsomeness omitted; no venom is wanting,"
2081,"MY LORD,",as far as dulness can supply it: for there is a perpetual dearth of
2082,"MY LORD,",wit; a barrenness of good sense and entertainment. The neglect of the
2083,"MY LORD,",readers will soon put an end to this sort of scribbling. There can be
2084,"MY LORD,","no pleasantry where there is no wit; no impression can be made, where"
2085,"MY LORD,",there is no truth for the foundation. To conclude: they are like the
2086,"MY LORD,",fruits of the earth in this unnatural season; the corn which held up
2087,"MY LORD,",its head is spoiled with rankness; but the greater part of the harvest
2088,"MY LORD,","is laid along, and little of good income and wholesome nourishment is"
2089,"MY LORD,","received into the barns. This is almost a digression, I confess to your"
2090,"MY LORD,",lordship; but a just indignation forced it from me. Now I have removed
2091,"MY LORD,","this rubbish, I will return to the comparison of Juvenal and Horace."
2092,"MY LORD,",
2093,"MY LORD,","I would willingly divide the palm betwixt them, upon the two heads"
2094,"MY LORD,","of profit and delight, which are the two ends of poetry in general."
2095,"MY LORD,","It must be granted, by the favourers of Juvenal, that Horace is the"
2096,"MY LORD,","more copious and profitable in his instructions of human life; but,"
2097,"MY LORD,","in my particular opinion, which I set not up for a standard to better"
2098,"MY LORD,","judgements, Juvenal is the more delightful author. I am profited"
2099,"MY LORD,","by both, I am pleased with both; but I owe more to Horace for my"
2100,"MY LORD,","instruction, and more to Juvenal for my pleasure. This, as I said, is"
2101,"MY LORD,",my particular taste of these two authors: they who will have either
2102,"MY LORD,","of them to excel the other in both qualities, can scarce give better"
2103,"MY LORD,",reasons for their opinion than I for mine. But all unbiassed readers
2104,"MY LORD,","will conclude, that my moderation is not to be condemned: to such"
2105,"MY LORD,",impartial men I must appeal; for they who have already formed their
2106,"MY LORD,","judgment, may justly stand suspected of prejudice; and though all who"
2107,"MY LORD,","are my readers will set up to be my judges, I enter my _caveat_ against"
2108,"MY LORD,","them, that they ought not so much as to be of my jury; or, if they be"
2109,"MY LORD,","admitted, it is but reason that they should first hear what I have to"
2110,"MY LORD,",urge in the defence of my opinion.
2111,"MY LORD,",
2112,"MY LORD,","That Horace is somewhat the better instructor of the two, is proved"
2113,"MY LORD,","from hence,--that his instructions are more general, Juvenal's more"
2114,"MY LORD,","limited. So that, granting that the counsels which they give are"
2115,"MY LORD,","equally good for moral use, Horace, who gives the most various advice,"
2116,"MY LORD,",and most applicable to all occasions which can occur to us in the
2117,"MY LORD,","course of our lives,--as including in his discourses, not only all the"
2118,"MY LORD,","rules of morality, but also of civil conversation,--is undoubtedly to"
2119,"MY LORD,","be preferred to him who is more circumscribed in his instructions,"
2120,"MY LORD,","makes them to fewer people, and on fewer occasions, than the other. I"
2121,"MY LORD,","may be pardoned for using an old saying, since it is true, and to the"
2122,"MY LORD,","purpose: _Bonum quò communis, eò melius_. Juvenal, excepting only"
2123,"MY LORD,","his first Satire, is in all the rest confined to the exposing of some"
2124,"MY LORD,","particular vice; that he lashes, and there he sticks. His sentences"
2125,"MY LORD,",are truly shining and instructive; but they are sprinkled here and
2126,"MY LORD,","there. Horace is teaching us in every line, and is perpetually moral:"
2127,"MY LORD,","he had found out the skill of Virgil, to hide his sentences; to give"
2128,"MY LORD,","you the virtue of them, without shewing them in their full extent;"
2129,"MY LORD,","which is the ostentation of a poet, and not his art: and this Petronius"
2130,"MY LORD,","charges on the authors of his time, as a vice of writing which was then"
2131,"MY LORD,",growing on the age: _ne sententiæ extra corpus orationis emineant_:
2132,"MY LORD,","he would have them weaved into the body of the work, and not appear"
2133,"MY LORD,","embossed upon it, and striking directly on the reader's view. Folly was"
2134,"MY LORD,","the proper quarry of Horace, and not vice; and as there are but few"
2135,"MY LORD,","notoriously wicked men, in comparison with a shoal of fools and fops,"
2136,"MY LORD,",so it is a harder thing to make a man wise than to make him honest; for
2137,"MY LORD,","the will is only to be reclaimed in the one, but the understanding is"
2138,"MY LORD,","to be informed in the other. There are blind sides and follies, even"
2139,"MY LORD,",in the professors of moral philosophy; and there is not any one sect
2140,"MY LORD,","of them that Horace has not exposed: which, as it was not the design"
2141,"MY LORD,","of Juvenal, who was wholly employed in lashing vices, some of them the"
2142,"MY LORD,","most enormous that can be imagined, so, perhaps, it was not so much his"
2143,"MY LORD,",talent.
2144,"MY LORD,",
2145,"MY LORD,",_Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico
2146,"MY LORD,","Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit._"
2147,"MY LORD,",
2148,"MY LORD,","This was the commendation which Persius gave him: where, by _vitium_,"
2149,"MY LORD,","he means those little vices which we call follies, the defects of human"
2150,"MY LORD,","understanding, or, at most, the peccadillos of life, rather than the"
2151,"MY LORD,","tragical vices, to which men are hurried by their unruly passions"
2152,"MY LORD,","and exorbitant desires. But, in the word _omne_, which is universal,"
2153,"MY LORD,","he concludes with me, that the divine wit of Horace left nothing"
2154,"MY LORD,",untouched; that he entered into the inmost recesses of nature; found
2155,"MY LORD,","out the imperfections even of the most wise and grave, as well as of"
2156,"MY LORD,","the common people; discovering, even in the great Trebatius, to whom he"
2157,"MY LORD,","addresses the first Satire, his hunting after business, and following"
2158,"MY LORD,","the court, as well as in the persecutor Crispinus, his impertinence"
2159,"MY LORD,","and importunity. It is true, he exposes Crispinus openly, as a common"
2160,"MY LORD,","nuisance; but he rallies the other, as a friend, more finely. The"
2161,"MY LORD,",exhortations of Persius are confined to noblemen; and the stoick
2162,"MY LORD,",philosophy is that alone which he recommends to them; Juvenal exhorts
2163,"MY LORD,","to particular virtues, as they are opposed to those vices against which"
2164,"MY LORD,","he declaims; but Horace laughs to shame all follies, and insinuates"
2165,"MY LORD,","virtue, rather by familiar examples than by the severity of precepts."
2166,"MY LORD,",
2167,"MY LORD,",This last consideration seems to incline the balance on the side of
2168,"MY LORD,","Horace, and to give him the preference to Juvenal, not only in profit,"
2169,"MY LORD,","but in pleasure. But, after all, I must confess, that the delight which"
2170,"MY LORD,","Horace gives me is but languishing. Be pleased still to understand,"
2171,"MY LORD,",that I speak of my own taste only: he may ravish other men; but I am
2172,"MY LORD,","too stupid and insensible to be tickled. Where he barely grins himself,"
2173,"MY LORD,","and, as Scaliger says, only shows his white teeth, he cannot provoke"
2174,"MY LORD,","me to any laughter. His urbanity, that is, his good manners, are to"
2175,"MY LORD,","be commended, but his wit is faint; and his salt, if I may dare to"
2176,"MY LORD,","say so, almost insipid. Juvenal is of a more vigorous and masculine"
2177,"MY LORD,",wit; he gives me as much pleasure as I can bear; he fully satisfies
2178,"MY LORD,","my expectation; he treats his subject home: his spleen is raised, and"
2179,"MY LORD,",he raises mine: I have the pleasure of concernment in all he says;
2180,"MY LORD,",he drives his reader along with him; and when he is at the end of his
2181,"MY LORD,","way, I willingly stop with him. If he went another stage, it would be"
2182,"MY LORD,","too far; it would make a journey of a progress, and turn delight into"
2183,"MY LORD,","fatigue. When he gives over, it is a sign the subject is exhausted,"
2184,"MY LORD,",and the wit of man can carry it no farther. If a fault can be justly
2185,"MY LORD,","found in him, it is, that he is sometimes too luxuriant, too redundant;"
2186,"MY LORD,","says more than he needs, like my friend the _Plain-Dealer_,[37] but"
2187,"MY LORD,","never more than pleases. Add to this, that his thoughts are as just as"
2188,"MY LORD,","those of Horace, and much more elevated. His expressions are sonorous"
2189,"MY LORD,","and more noble; his verse more numerous, and his words are suitable"
2190,"MY LORD,","to his thoughts, sublime and lofty. All these contribute to the"
2191,"MY LORD,","pleasure of the reader; and the greater the soul of him who reads, his"
2192,"MY LORD,","transports are the greater. Horace is always on the amble, Juvenal on"
2193,"MY LORD,",the gallop; but his way is perpetually on carpet-ground. He goes with
2194,"MY LORD,","more impetuosity than Horace, but as securely; and the swiftness adds"
2195,"MY LORD,",a more lively agitation to the spirits. The low style of Horace is
2196,"MY LORD,","according to his subject, that is, generally grovelling. I question not"
2197,"MY LORD,","but he could have raised it; for the first epistle of the second book,"
2198,"MY LORD,","which he writes to Augustus, (a most instructive satire concerning"
2199,"MY LORD,","poetry,) is of so much dignity in the words, and of so much elegancy"
2200,"MY LORD,","in the numbers, that the author plainly shows, the _sermo pedestris_,"
2201,"MY LORD,","in his other Satires, was rather his choice than his necessity. He was"
2202,"MY LORD,","a rival to Lucilius, his predecessor, and was resolved to surpass him"
2203,"MY LORD,","in his own manner. Lucilius, as we see by his remaining fragments,"
2204,"MY LORD,","minded neither his style, nor his numbers, nor his purity of words,"
2205,"MY LORD,",nor his run of verse. Horace therefore copes with him in that humble
2206,"MY LORD,","way of satire, writes under his own force, and carries a dead-weight,"
2207,"MY LORD,","that he may match his competitor in the race. This, I imagine, was the"
2208,"MY LORD,","chief reason why he minded only the clearness of his satire, and the"
2209,"MY LORD,","cleanness of expression, without ascending to those heights to which"
2210,"MY LORD,","his own vigour might have carried him. But, limiting his desires only"
2211,"MY LORD,","to the conquest of Lucilius, he had his ends of his rival, who lived"
2212,"MY LORD,","before him; but made way for a new conquest over himself, by Juvenal,"
2213,"MY LORD,","his successor. He could not give an equal pleasure to his reader,"
2214,"MY LORD,","because he used not equal instruments. The fault was in the tools, and"
2215,"MY LORD,",not in the workman. But versification and numbers are the greatest
2216,"MY LORD,","pleasures of poetry: Virgil knew it, and practised both so happily,"
2217,"MY LORD,","that, for aught I know, his greatest excellency is in his diction. In"
2218,"MY LORD,","all other parts of poetry, he is faultless; but in this he placed his"
2219,"MY LORD,","chief perfection. And give me leave, my lord, since I have here an apt"
2220,"MY LORD,","occasion, to say, that Virgil could have written sharper satires than"
2221,"MY LORD,","either Horace or Juvenal, if he would have employed his talent that"
2222,"MY LORD,","way. I will produce a verse and half of his, in one of his Eclogues,"
2223,"MY LORD,","to justify my opinion; and with commas after every word, to show, that"
2224,"MY LORD,",he has given almost as many lashes as he has written syllables: it is
2225,"MY LORD,","against a bad poet, whose ill verses he describes:"
2226,"MY LORD,",
2227,"MY LORD,","----_non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas"
2228,"MY LORD,","Stridenti, miserum, stipulâ, disperdere carmen?_"
2229,"MY LORD,",
2230,"MY LORD,","But, to return to my purpose. When there is any thing deficient in"
2231,"MY LORD,","numbers and sound, the reader is uneasy and unsatisfied; he wants"
2232,"MY LORD,","something of his complement, desires somewhat which he finds not:"
2233,"MY LORD,","and this being the manifest defect of Horace, it is no wonder that,"
2234,"MY LORD,","finding it supplied in Juvenal, we are more delighted with him. And,"
2235,"MY LORD,","besides this, the sauce of Juvenal is more poignant, to create in us an"
2236,"MY LORD,",appetite of reading him. The meat of Horace is more nourishing; but the
2237,"MY LORD,","cookery of Juvenal more exquisite: so that, granting Horace to be the"
2238,"MY LORD,","more general philosopher, we cannot deny that Juvenal was the greater"
2239,"MY LORD,","poet, I mean in satire. His thoughts are sharper; his indignation"
2240,"MY LORD,",against vice is more vehement; his spirit has more of the commonwealth
2241,"MY LORD,","genius; he treats tyranny, and all the vices attending it, as they"
2242,"MY LORD,","deserve, with the utmost rigour: and consequently, a noble soul is"
2243,"MY LORD,","better pleased with a zealous vindicator of Roman liberty, than with a"
2244,"MY LORD,","temporising poet, a well-mannered court-slave, and a man who is often"
2245,"MY LORD,","afraid of laughing in the right place; who is ever decent, because he"
2246,"MY LORD,","is naturally servile. After all, Horace had the disadvantage of the"
2247,"MY LORD,","times in which he lived; they were better for the man, but worse for"
2248,"MY LORD,","the satirist. It is generally said, that those enormous vices which"
2249,"MY LORD,","were practised under the reign of Domitian, were unknown in the time of"
2250,"MY LORD,",Augustus Cæsar; that therefore Juvenal had a larger field than Horace.
2251,"MY LORD,","Little follies were out of doors, when oppression was to be scourged"
2252,"MY LORD,",instead of avarice: it was no longer time to turn into ridicule the
2253,"MY LORD,","false opinions of philosophers, when the Roman liberty was to be"
2254,"MY LORD,","asserted. There was more need of a Brutus in Domitian's days, to redeem"
2255,"MY LORD,","or mend, than of a Horace, if he had then been living, to laugh at a"
2256,"MY LORD,","fly-catcher.[38] This reflection at the same time excuses Horace, but"
2257,"MY LORD,","exalts Juvenal.--I have ended, before I was aware, the comparison of"
2258,"MY LORD,","Horace and Juvenal, upon the topics of instruction and delight; and,"
2259,"MY LORD,","indeed, I may safely here conclude that common-place; for, if we make"
2260,"MY LORD,","Horace our minister of state in satire, and Juvenal of our private"
2261,"MY LORD,","pleasures, I think the latter has no ill bargain of it. Let profit have"
2262,"MY LORD,","the pre-eminence of honour, in the end of poetry. Pleasure, though but"
2263,"MY LORD,","the second in degree, is the first in favour. And who would not chuse"
2264,"MY LORD,","to be loved better, rather than to be more esteemed? But I am entered"
2265,"MY LORD,","already upon another topic, which concerns the particular merits of"
2266,"MY LORD,","these two satirists. However, I will pursue my business where I left"
2267,"MY LORD,","it, and carry it farther than that common observation of the several"
2268,"MY LORD,",ages in which these authors flourished.
2269,"MY LORD,",
2270,"MY LORD,","When Horace writ his Satires, the monarchy of his Cæsar was in its"
2271,"MY LORD,","newness, and the government but just made easy to the conquered people."
2272,"MY LORD,",They could not possibly have forgotten the usurpation of that prince
2273,"MY LORD,","upon their freedom, nor the violent methods which he had used, in the"
2274,"MY LORD,","compassing that vast design: they yet remembered his proscriptions,"
2275,"MY LORD,","and the slaughter of so many noble Romans, their defenders: amongst"
2276,"MY LORD,","the rest, that horrible action of his, when he forced Livia from the"
2277,"MY LORD,","arms of her husband, who was constrained to see her married, as Dion"
2278,"MY LORD,","relates the story, and, big with child as she was, conveyed to the"
2279,"MY LORD,",bed of his insulting rival. The same Dion Cassius gives us another
2280,"MY LORD,",instance of the crime before mentioned; that Cornelius Sisenna being
2281,"MY LORD,","reproached, in full senate, with the licentious conduct of his wife,"
2282,"MY LORD,","returned this answer, ""that he had married her by the counsel of"
2283,"MY LORD,","Augustus;"" intimating, says my author, that Augustus had obliged him"
2284,"MY LORD,","to that marriage, that he might, under that covert, have the more free"
2285,"MY LORD,",access to her. His adulteries were still before their eyes: but they
2286,"MY LORD,",must be patient where they had not power. In other things that emperor
2287,"MY LORD,",was moderate enough: propriety was generally secured; and the people
2288,"MY LORD,","entertained with public shows and donatives, to make them more easily"
2289,"MY LORD,","digest their lost liberty. But Augustus, who was conscious to himself"
2290,"MY LORD,","of so many crimes which he had committed, thought, in the first place,"
2291,"MY LORD,","to provide for his own reputation, by making an edict against Lampoons"
2292,"MY LORD,","and Satires, and the authors of those defamatory writings, which my"
2293,"MY LORD,","author Tacitus, from the law-term, calls _famosos libellos_."
2294,"MY LORD,",
2295,"MY LORD,","In the first book of his Annals, he gives the following account of it,"
2296,"MY LORD,","in these words: _Primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis,"
2297,"MY LORD,","specie legis ejus, tractavit; commotus Cassii Severi libidine, quâ"
2298,"MY LORD,","viros fæminasque illustres, procacibus scriptis diffamaverat_."
2299,"MY LORD,","Thus in English: ""Augustus was the first, who under the colour of"
2300,"MY LORD,","that law took cognisance of lampoons; being provoked to it, by the"
2301,"MY LORD,","petulancy of Cassius Severus, who had defamed many illustrious persons"
2302,"MY LORD,","of both sexes, in his writings."" The law to which Tacitus refers,"
2303,"MY LORD,","was _Lex læsæ Majestatis_; commonly called, for the sake of brevity,"
2304,"MY LORD,","_Majestas_; or, as we say, high treason. He means not, that this law"
2305,"MY LORD,","had not been enacted formerly: for it had been made by the Decemviri,"
2306,"MY LORD,",and was inscribed amongst the rest in the Twelve Tables; to prevent
2307,"MY LORD,","the aspersion of the Roman majesty, either of the people themselves,"
2308,"MY LORD,","or their religion, or their magistrates: and the infringement of"
2309,"MY LORD,","it was capital; that is, the offender was whipt to death, with the"
2310,"MY LORD,","_fasces_, which were borne before their chief officers of Rome. But"
2311,"MY LORD,","Augustus was the first, who restored that intermitted law. By the"
2312,"MY LORD,","words, _under colour of that law_, he insinuates that Augustus caused"
2313,"MY LORD,","it to be executed, on pretence of those libels, which were written by"
2314,"MY LORD,","Cassius Severus, against the nobility; but, in truth, to save himself"
2315,"MY LORD,",from such defamatory verses. Suetonius likewise makes mention of it
2316,"MY LORD,","thus: _Sparsos de se in curiâ famosos libellos, nec expavit, et"
2317,"MY LORD,","magnâ curâ redarguit. Ac ne requisitis quidem auctoribus, id modo"
2318,"MY LORD,","censuit, cognoscendum posthac de iis qui libellos aut carmina ad"
2319,"MY LORD,","infamiam cujuspiam sub alieno nomine edant_. ""Augustus was not afraid"
2320,"MY LORD,","of libels,"" says that author; ""yet he took all care imaginable to have"
2321,"MY LORD,","them answered; and then decreed, that for the time to come, the authors"
2322,"MY LORD,","of them should be punished."" But Aurelius makes it yet more clear,"
2323,"MY LORD,","according to my sense, that this emperor for his own sake durst not"
2324,"MY LORD,","permit them: _Fecit id Augustus in speciem, et quasi gratificaretur"
2325,"MY LORD,","populo Romano, et primoribus urbis; sed revera ut sibi consuleret:"
2326,"MY LORD,","nam habuit in animo, comprimere nimiam quorundam procacitatem in"
2327,"MY LORD,","loquendo, à quâ nec ipse exemptus fuit. Nam suo nomine compescere"
2328,"MY LORD,","erat invidiosum, sub alieno facile et utile. Ergo specie legis"
2329,"MY LORD,","tractavit, quasi populi Romani majestas infamaretur._ This, I think,"
2330,"MY LORD,",is a sufficient comment on that passage of Tacitus. I will add only by
2331,"MY LORD,","the way, that the whole family of the Cæsars, and all their relations,"
2332,"MY LORD,","were included in the law; because the majesty of the Romans, in the"
2333,"MY LORD,","time of the empire, was wholly in that house; _omnia Cæsar erat_: they"
2334,"MY LORD,","were all accounted sacred who belonged to him. As for Cassius Severus,"
2335,"MY LORD,",he was contemporary with Horace; and was the same poet against whom he
2336,"MY LORD,","writes in his Epodes, under this title, _In Cassium Severum maledicum"
2337,"MY LORD,","poetam_; perhaps intending to kill two crows, according to our proverb,"
2338,"MY LORD,","with one stone, and revenge both himself and his emperor together."
2339,"MY LORD,",
2340,"MY LORD,","From hence I may reasonably conclude, that Augustus, who was not"
2341,"MY LORD,","altogether so good as he was wise, had some by-respect in the enacting"
2342,"MY LORD,","of this law; for to do any thing for nothing, was not his maxim."
2343,"MY LORD,","Horace, as he was a courtier, complied with the interest of his master;"
2344,"MY LORD,","and, avoiding the lashing of greater crimes, confined himself to the"
2345,"MY LORD,",ridiculing of petty vices and common follies; excepting only some
2346,"MY LORD,","reserved cases, in his Odes and Epodes, of his own particular quarrels,"
2347,"MY LORD,","which either with permission of the magistrate, or without it, every"
2348,"MY LORD,","man will revenge, though I say not that he should; for _prior læsit_ is"
2349,"MY LORD,","a good excuse in the civil law, if christianity had not taught us to"
2350,"MY LORD,","forgive. However, he was not the proper man to arraign great vices, at"
2351,"MY LORD,","least if the stories which we hear of him are true,--that he practised"
2352,"MY LORD,","some, which I will not here mention, out of honour to him. It was not"
2353,"MY LORD,","for a Clodius to accuse adulterers, especially when Augustus was of"
2354,"MY LORD,",that number; so that though his age was not exempted from the worst
2355,"MY LORD,","of villanies, there was no freedom left to reprehend them by reason"
2356,"MY LORD,",of the edict; and our poet was not fit to represent them in an odious
2357,"MY LORD,","character, because himself was dipt in the same actions. Upon this"
2358,"MY LORD,","account, without farther insisting on the different tempers of Juvenal"
2359,"MY LORD,","and Horace, I conclude, that the subjects which Horace chose for"
2360,"MY LORD,","satire, are of a lower nature than those of which Juvenal has written."
2361,"MY LORD,",
2362,"MY LORD,","Thus I have treated, in a new method, the comparison betwixt Horace,"
2363,"MY LORD,","Juvenal, and Persius; somewhat of their particular manner belonging"
2364,"MY LORD,","to all of them is yet remaining to be considered. Persius was grave,"
2365,"MY LORD,","and particularly opposed his gravity to lewdness, which was the"
2366,"MY LORD,","predominant vice in Nero's court, at the time when he published his"
2367,"MY LORD,","Satires, which was before that emperor fell into the excess of cruelty."
2368,"MY LORD,","Horace was a mild admonisher, a court-satirist, fit for the gentle"
2369,"MY LORD,","times of Augustus, and more fit, for the reasons which I have already"
2370,"MY LORD,","given. Juvenal was as proper for his times, as they for theirs; his"
2371,"MY LORD,",was an age that deserved a more severe chastisement; vices were more
2372,"MY LORD,","gross and open, more flagitious, more encouraged by the example of a"
2373,"MY LORD,","tyrant, and more protected by his authority. Therefore, wheresoever"
2374,"MY LORD,","Juvenal mentions Nero, he means Domitian, whom he dares not attack in"
2375,"MY LORD,","his own person, but scourges him by proxy. Heinsius urges in praise"
2376,"MY LORD,","of Horace, that, according to the ancient art and law of satire, it"
2377,"MY LORD,","should be nearer to comedy than tragedy; not declaiming against vice,"
2378,"MY LORD,",but only laughing at it. Neither Persius nor Juvenal were ignorant of
2379,"MY LORD,","this, for they had both studied Horace. And the thing itself is plainly"
2380,"MY LORD,","true. But as they had read Horace, they had likewise read Lucilius, of"
2381,"MY LORD,","whom Persius says,--_secuit urbem; ... et genuinum fregit in illis_;"
2382,"MY LORD,",meaning Mutius and Lupus; and Juvenal also mentions him in these words:
2383,"MY LORD,",
2384,"MY LORD,","_Ense velut stricto, quoties Lucilius ardens"
2385,"MY LORD,","Infremuit, rubet auditor, cui frigida mens est"
2386,"MY LORD,","Criminibus, tacitâ sudant præcordia culpa_."
2387,"MY LORD,",
2388,"MY LORD,",So that they thought the imitation of Lucilius was more proper to their
2389,"MY LORD,","purpose than that of Horace. ""They changed satire, (says Holyday) but"
2390,"MY LORD,",they changed it for the better; for the business being to reform great
2391,"MY LORD,","vices, chastisement goes farther than admonition; whereas a perpetual"
2392,"MY LORD,","grin, like that of Horace, does rather anger than amend a man."""
2393,"MY LORD,",
2394,"MY LORD,","Thus far that learned critic, Barten Holyday,[39] whose interpretation"
2395,"MY LORD,","and illustrations of Juvenal are as excellent, as the verse of his"
2396,"MY LORD,",translation and his English are lame and pitiful. For it is not enough
2397,"MY LORD,","to give us the meaning of a poet, which I acknowledge him to have"
2398,"MY LORD,","performed most faithfully, but he must also imitate his genius, and"
2399,"MY LORD,","his numbers, as far as the English will come up to the elegance of the"
2400,"MY LORD,","original. In few words, it is only for a poet to translate a poem."
2401,"MY LORD,","Holyday and Stapylton[40] had not enough considered this, when they"
2402,"MY LORD,",attempted Juvenal: but I forbear reflections; only I beg leave to take
2403,"MY LORD,","notice of this sentence, where Holyday says, ""a perpetual grin, like"
2404,"MY LORD,","that of Horace, rather angers than amends a man."" I cannot give him up"
2405,"MY LORD,",the manner of Horace in low satire so easily. Let the chastisement
2406,"MY LORD,",of Juvenal be never so necessary for his new kind of satire; let him
2407,"MY LORD,",declaim as wittily and sharply as he pleases; yet still the nicest
2408,"MY LORD,","and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine raillery. This,"
2409,"MY LORD,","my lord, is your particular talent, to which even Juvenal could not"
2410,"MY LORD,","arrive. It is not reading, it is not imitation of an author, which"
2411,"MY LORD,",can produce this fineness; it must be inborn; it must proceed from a
2412,"MY LORD,","genius, and particular way of thinking, which is not to be taught; and"
2413,"MY LORD,",therefore not to be imitated by him who has it not from nature. How
2414,"MY LORD,","easy is it to call rogue and villain, and that wittily! But how hard"
2415,"MY LORD,","to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave, without using"
2416,"MY LORD,","any of those opprobrious terms! To spare the grossness of the names,"
2417,"MY LORD,","and to do the thing yet more severely, is to draw a full face, and to"
2418,"MY LORD,","make the nose and cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depth"
2419,"MY LORD,","of shadowing. This is the mystery of that noble trade, which yet no"
2420,"MY LORD,","master can teach to his apprentice; he may give the rules, but the"
2421,"MY LORD,","scholar is never the nearer in his practice. Neither is it true, that"
2422,"MY LORD,",this fineness of raillery is offensive. A witty man is tickled while
2423,"MY LORD,","he is hurt in this manner, and a fool feels it not. The occasion of an"
2424,"MY LORD,","offence may possibly be given, but he cannot take it. If it be granted,"
2425,"MY LORD,",that in effect this way does more mischief; that a man is secretly
2426,"MY LORD,","wounded, and though he be not sensible himself, yet the malicious world"
2427,"MY LORD,",will find it out for him; yet there is still a vast difference betwixt
2428,"MY LORD,","the slovenly butchering of a man, and the fineness of a stroke that"
2429,"MY LORD,","separates the head from the body, and leaves it standing in its place."
2430,"MY LORD,","A man may be capable, as Jack Ketch's[41] wife said of his servant,"
2431,"MY LORD,","of a plain piece of work, a bare hanging; but to make a malefactor die"
2432,"MY LORD,","sweetly, was only belonging to her husband. I wish I could apply it to"
2433,"MY LORD,","myself, if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me."
2434,"MY LORD,","The character of Zimri in my ""Absalom,"" is, in my opinion, worth the"
2435,"MY LORD,","whole poem: it is not bloody, but it is ridiculous enough; and he, for"
2436,"MY LORD,","whom it was intended, was too witty to resent it as an injury.[42] If I"
2437,"MY LORD,","had railed, I might have suffered for it justly; but I managed my own"
2438,"MY LORD,","work more happily, perhaps more dexterously. I avoided the mention of"
2439,"MY LORD,","great crimes, and applied myself to the representing of blind-sides,"
2440,"MY LORD,","and little extravagancies; to which, the wittier a man is, he is"
2441,"MY LORD,",generally the more obnoxious. It succeeded as I wished; the jest went
2442,"MY LORD,","round, and he was laughed at in his turn who began the frolic."
2443,"MY LORD,",
2444,"MY LORD,","And thus, my lord, you see I have preferred the manner of Horace, and"
2445,"MY LORD,","of your lordship, in this kind of satire, to that of Juvenal, and I"
2446,"MY LORD,","think, reasonably. Holyday ought not to have arraigned so great an"
2447,"MY LORD,","author, for that which was his excellency and his merit: or if he"
2448,"MY LORD,","did, on such a palpable mistake, he might expect that some one might"
2449,"MY LORD,","possibly arise, either in his own time, or after him, to rectify his"
2450,"MY LORD,","error, and restore to Horace that commendation, of which he has so"
2451,"MY LORD,","unjustly robbed him. And let the manes of Juvenal forgive me, if I"
2452,"MY LORD,","say, that this way of Horace was the best for amending manners, as it"
2453,"MY LORD,",is the most difficult. His was an _ense rescindendum_; but that of
2454,"MY LORD,","Horace was a pleasant cure, with all the limbs preserved entire; and,"
2455,"MY LORD,","as our mountebanks tell us in their bills, without keeping the patient"
2456,"MY LORD,","within doors for a day. What they promise only, Horace has effectually"
2457,"MY LORD,",performed: yet I contradict not the proposition which I formerly
2458,"MY LORD,",advanced. Juvenal's times required a more painful kind of operation;
2459,"MY LORD,","but if he had lived in the age of Horace, I must needs affirm, that he"
2460,"MY LORD,",had it not about him. He took the method which was prescribed him by
2461,"MY LORD,","his own genius, which was sharp and eager; he could not rally, but he"
2462,"MY LORD,","could declaim; and as his provocations were great, he has revenged them"
2463,"MY LORD,","tragically. This notwithstanding, I am to say another word, which, as"
2464,"MY LORD,","true as it is, will yet displease the partial admirers of our Horace. I"
2465,"MY LORD,","have hinted it before, but it is time for me now to speak more plainly."
2466,"MY LORD,",
2467,"MY LORD,",This manner of Horace is indeed the best; but Horace has not executed
2468,"MY LORD,","it altogether so happily, at least not often. The manner of Juvenal is"
2469,"MY LORD,","confessed to be inferior to the former, but Juvenal has excelled him"
2470,"MY LORD,",in his performance. Juvenal has railed more wittily than Horace has
2471,"MY LORD,","rallied. Horace means to make his readers laugh, but he is not sure of"
2472,"MY LORD,","his experiment. Juvenal always intends to move your indignation, and"
2473,"MY LORD,","he always brings about his purpose. Horace, for aught I know, might"
2474,"MY LORD,",have tickled the people of his age; but amongst the moderns he is not
2475,"MY LORD,","so successful. They, who say he entertains so pleasantly, may perhaps"
2476,"MY LORD,","value themselves on the quickness of their own understandings, that"
2477,"MY LORD,",they can see a jest farther off than other men; they may find occasion
2478,"MY LORD,","of laughter in the wit-battle of the two buffoons, Sarmentus and"
2479,"MY LORD,","Cicerrus; and hold their sides for fear of bursting, when Rupilius and"
2480,"MY LORD,","Persius are scolding. For my own part, I can only like the characters"
2481,"MY LORD,","of all four, which are judiciously given; but for my heart I cannot so"
2482,"MY LORD,",much as smile at their insipid raillery. I see not why Persius should
2483,"MY LORD,",call upon Brutus to revenge him on his adversary; and that because he
2484,"MY LORD,","had killed Julius Cæsar, for endeavouring to be a king, therefore he"
2485,"MY LORD,","should be desired to murder Rupilius, only because his name was Mr"
2486,"MY LORD,","King.[43] A miserable clench, in my opinion, for Horace to record: I"
2487,"MY LORD,","have heard honest Mr Swan[44] make many a better, and yet have had"
2488,"MY LORD,",the grace to hold my countenance. But it may be puns were then in
2489,"MY LORD,","fashion, as they were wit in the sermons of the last age, and in the"
2490,"MY LORD,","court of King Charles II. I am sorry to say it, for the sake of Horace;"
2491,"MY LORD,","but certain it is, he has no fine palate who can feed so heartily on"
2492,"MY LORD,",garbage.
2493,"MY LORD,",
2494,"MY LORD,","But I have already wearied myself, and doubt not but I have tired your"
2495,"MY LORD,","lordship's patience, with this long, rambling, and, I fear, trivial"
2496,"MY LORD,","discourse. Upon the one half of the merits, that is, pleasure, I cannot"
2497,"MY LORD,","but conclude that Juvenal was the better satirist. They, who will"
2498,"MY LORD,","descend into his particular praises, may find them at large in the"
2499,"MY LORD,","Dissertation of the learned Rigaltius to Thuanus. As for Persius, I"
2500,"MY LORD,",have given the reasons why I think him inferior to both of them; yet I
2501,"MY LORD,",have one thing to add on that subject.
2502,"MY LORD,",
2503,"MY LORD,","Barten Holyday, who translated both Juvenal and Persius, has made this"
2504,"MY LORD,","distinction betwixt them, which is no less true than witty,--that in"
2505,"MY LORD,","Persius the difficulty is to find a meaning, in Juvenal to chuse a"
2506,"MY LORD,","meaning: so crabbed is Persius, and so copious is Juvenal; so much"
2507,"MY LORD,","the understanding is employed in one, and so much the judgment in the"
2508,"MY LORD,","other; so difficult it is to find any sense in the former, and the best"
2509,"MY LORD,",sense of the latter.
2510,"MY LORD,",
2511,"MY LORD,","If, on the other side, any one suppose I have commended Horace below"
2512,"MY LORD,","his merit, when I have allowed him but the second place, I desire"
2513,"MY LORD,","him to consider, if Juvenal, a man of excellent natural endowments,"
2514,"MY LORD,","besides the advantages of diligence and study, and coming after him,"
2515,"MY LORD,","and building upon his foundations, might not probably, with all these"
2516,"MY LORD,","helps, surpass him; and whether it be any dishonour to Horace to be"
2517,"MY LORD,","thus surpassed, since no art or science is at once begun and perfected,"
2518,"MY LORD,","but that it must pass first through many hands, and even through"
2519,"MY LORD,","several ages. If Lucilius could add to Ennius, and Horace to Lucilius,"
2520,"MY LORD,","why, without any diminution to the fame of Horace, might not Juvenal"
2521,"MY LORD,","give the last perfection to that work? Or, rather, what disreputation"
2522,"MY LORD,","is it to Horace, that Juvenal excels in the tragical satire, as Horace"
2523,"MY LORD,",does in the comical? I have read over attentively both Heinsius and
2524,"MY LORD,","Dacier, in their commendations of Horace; but I can find no more"
2525,"MY LORD,","in either of them, for the preference of him to Juvenal, than the"
2526,"MY LORD,","instructive part; the part of wisdom, and not that of pleasure; which,"
2527,"MY LORD,","therefore, is here allowed him, notwithstanding what Scaliger and"
2528,"MY LORD,","Rigaltius have pleaded to the contrary for Juvenal. And, to show that"
2529,"MY LORD,","I am impartial, I will here translate what Dacier has said on that"
2530,"MY LORD,",subject.
2531,"MY LORD,",
2532,"MY LORD,","""I cannot give a more just idea of the two books of Satires made by"
2533,"MY LORD,","Horace, than by comparing them to the statues of the Sileni, to which"
2534,"MY LORD,","Alcibiades compares Socrates in the Symposium. They were figures,"
2535,"MY LORD,","which had nothing of agreeable, nothing of beauty, on their outside;"
2536,"MY LORD,","but when any one took the pains to open them, and search into them,"
2537,"MY LORD,","he there found the figures of all the deities. So, in the shape that"
2538,"MY LORD,","Horace presents himself to us in his Satires, we see nothing, at the"
2539,"MY LORD,","first view, which deserves our attention: it seems that he is rather an"
2540,"MY LORD,","amusement for children, than for the serious consideration of men. But,"
2541,"MY LORD,","when we take away his crust, and that which hides him from our sight,"
2542,"MY LORD,","when we discover him to the bottom, then we find all the divinities in"
2543,"MY LORD,","a full assembly; that is to say, all the virtues which ought to be the"
2544,"MY LORD,","continual exercise of those, who seriously endeavour to correct their"
2545,"MY LORD,","vices."""
2546,"MY LORD,",
2547,"MY LORD,","It is easy to observe, that Dacier, in this noble similitude, has"
2548,"MY LORD,",confined the praise of his author wholly to the instructive part; the
2549,"MY LORD,","commendation turns on this, and so does that which follows."
2550,"MY LORD,",
2551,"MY LORD,","""In these two books of satire, it is the business of Horace to"
2552,"MY LORD,","instruct us how to combat our vices, to regulate our passions, to"
2553,"MY LORD,","follow nature, to give bounds to our desires, to distinguish betwixt"
2554,"MY LORD,","truth and falsehood, and betwixt our conceptions of things, and things"
2555,"MY LORD,","themselves; to come back from our prejudicate opinions, to understand"
2556,"MY LORD,",exactly the principles and motives of all our actions; and to avoid
2557,"MY LORD,","the ridicule, into which all men necessarily fall, who are intoxicated"
2558,"MY LORD,","with those notions which they have received from their masters, and"
2559,"MY LORD,","which they obstinately retain, without examining whether or no they be"
2560,"MY LORD,",founded on right reason.

2565,"MY LORD,","and to converse. To make his figures intelligible, to conduct his"
2566,"MY LORD,","readers through the labyrinth of some perplexed sentence, or obscure"
2567,"MY LORD,","parenthesis, is no great matter; and, as Epictetus says, there is"
2568,"MY LORD,","nothing of beauty in all this, or what is worthy of a prudent man. The"

2611,"MY LORD,","And thus I have given the history of Satire, and derived it as far as"
2612,"MY LORD,","from Ennius to your lordship; that is, from its first rudiments of"
2613,"MY LORD,","barbarity to its last polishing and perfection; which is, with Virgil,"
2614,"MY LORD,","in his address to Augustus,--"
2615,"MY LORD,",
2616,"MY LORD,","----_Nomen famâ tot ferre per annos,"
2617,"MY LORD,",Tithoni primâ quot abest ab origine Cæsar._
2618,"MY LORD,",
2619,"MY LORD,","I said only from Ennius; but I may safely carry it higher, as far as"
2620,"MY LORD,","Livius Andronicus, who, as I have said formerly, taught the first play"
2621,"MY LORD,","at Rome, in the year _ab urbe condita_ CCCCCXIV. I have since desired"
2622,"MY LORD,","my learned friend, Mr Maidwell,[45] to compute the difference of"
2623,"MY LORD,","times, betwixt Aristophanes and Livius Andronicus; and he assures me,"
2624,"MY LORD,","from the best chronologers, that ""Plutus,"" the last of Aristophanes's"
2625,"MY LORD,","plays, was represented at Athens, in the year of the 97th Olympiad;"
2626,"MY LORD,",which agrees with the year _urbis conditæ_ CCCLXIV. So that the
2627,"MY LORD,",difference of years betwixt Aristophanes and Andronicus is 150; from
2628,"MY LORD,","whence I have probably deduced, that Livius Andronicus, who was a"
2629,"MY LORD,","Grecian, had read the plays of the old comedy, which were satirical,"
2630,"MY LORD,","and also of the new; for Menander was fifty years before him, which"
2631,"MY LORD,","must needs be a great light to him in his own plays, that were of the"
2632,"MY LORD,",satirical nature. That the Romans had farces before this it is true;
2633,"MY LORD,",but then they had no communication with Greece; so that Andronicus was
2634,"MY LORD,",the first who wrote after the manner of the old comedy in his plays:
2635,"MY LORD,","he was imitated by Ennius, about thirty years afterwards. Though the"
2636,"MY LORD,","former writ fables, the latter, speaking properly, began the Roman"
2637,"MY LORD,","satire; according to that description, which Juvenal gives of it in his"
2638,"MY LORD,",first:
2639,"MY LORD,",
2640,"MY LORD,","_Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,"
2641,"MY LORD,","Gaudia, discursus, nostri est farrago libelli._"
2642,"MY LORD,",
2643,"MY LORD,","This is that in which I have made bold to differ from Casaubon,"
2644,"MY LORD,","Rigaltius, Dacier, and indeed from all the modern critics,--that not"
2645,"MY LORD,","Ennius, but Andronicus was the first, who, by the _Archæa Comoedia_ of"
2646,"MY LORD,","the Greeks, added many beauties to the first rude and barbarous Roman"
2647,"MY LORD,","satire: which sort of poem, though we had not derived from Rome, yet"
2648,"MY LORD,","nature teaches it mankind in all ages, and in every country."
2649,"MY LORD,",
2650,"MY LORD,","It is but necessary, that after so much has been said of Satire, some"
2651,"MY LORD,","definition of it should be given. Heinsius, in his ""Dissertations on"
2652,"MY LORD,","Horace,"" makes it for me, in these words: ""Satire is a kind of poetry,"
2653,"MY LORD,","without a series of action, invented for the purging of our minds; in"
2654,"MY LORD,","which human vices, ignorance, and errors, and all things besides, which"
2655,"MY LORD,","are produced from them in every man, are severely reprehended; partly"
2656,"MY LORD,","dramatically, partly simply, and sometimes in both kinds of speaking;"
2657,"MY LORD,","but, for the most part, figuratively, and occultly; consisting in a"
2658,"MY LORD,","low familiar way, chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of speech;"
2659,"MY LORD,","but partly, also, in a facetious and civil way of jesting; by which"
2660,"MY LORD,","either hatred, or laughter, or indignation, is moved.""--Where I cannot"
2661,"MY LORD,","but observe, that this obscure and perplexed definition, or rather"
2662,"MY LORD,","description, of satire, is wholly accommodated to the Horatian way;"
2663,"MY LORD,","and excluding the works of Juvenal and Persius, as foreign from that"
2664,"MY LORD,","kind of poem. The clause in the beginning of it (""without a series"
2665,"MY LORD,","of action"") distinguishes satire properly from stage-plays, which"
2666,"MY LORD,","are all of one action, and one continued series of action. The end"
2667,"MY LORD,",or scope of satire is to purge the passions; so far it is common to
2668,"MY LORD,",the satires of Juvenal and Persius. The rest which follows is also
2669,"MY LORD,","generally belonging to all three; till he comes upon us, with the"
2670,"MY LORD,","excluding clause--""consisting in a low familiar way of speech,""--which"
2671,"MY LORD,","is the proper character of Horace; and from which, the other two, for"
2672,"MY LORD,","their honour be it spoken, are far distant. But how come lowness"
2673,"MY LORD,","of style, and the familiarity of words, to be so much the propriety"
2674,"MY LORD,","of satire, that without them a poet can be no more a satirist, than"
2675,"MY LORD,",without risibility he can be a man? Is the fault of Horace to be made
2676,"MY LORD,",the virtue and standing rule of this poem? Is the _grande sophos_[46]
2677,"MY LORD,","of Persius, and the sublimity of Juvenal, to be circumscribed with"
2678,"MY LORD,",the meanness of words and vulgarity of expression? If Horace refused
2679,"MY LORD,","the pains of numbers, and the loftiness of figures, are they bound to"
2680,"MY LORD,","follow so ill a precedent? Let him walk a-foot, with his pad in his"
2681,"MY LORD,","hand, for his own pleasure; but let not them be accounted no poets, who"
2682,"MY LORD,","chuse to mount, and show their horsemanship. Holyday is not afraid to"
2683,"MY LORD,","say, that there was never such a fall, as from his Odes to his Satires,"
2684,"MY LORD,","and that he, injuriously to himself, untuned his harp. The majestic way"
2685,"MY LORD,","of Persius and Juvenal was new when they began it, but it is old to us;"
2686,"MY LORD,","and what poems have not, with time, received an alteration in their"
2687,"MY LORD,","fashion? ""which alteration,"" says Holyday, ""is to after times as good"
2688,"MY LORD,","a warrant as the first."" Has not Virgil changed the manners of Homer's"
2689,"MY LORD,","heroes in his Æneid? Certainly he has, and for the better: for Virgil's"
2690,"MY LORD,","age was more civilized, and better bred; and he writ according to the"
2691,"MY LORD,","politeness of Rome, under the reign of Augustus Cæsar, not to the"
2692,"MY LORD,","rudeness of Agamemnon's age, or the times of Homer. Why should we offer"
2693,"MY LORD,","to confine free spirits to one form, when we cannot so much as confine"
2694,"MY LORD,","our bodies to one fashion of apparel? Would not Donne's satires, which"
2695,"MY LORD,","abound with so much wit, appear more charming, if he had taken care of"
2696,"MY LORD,","his words, and of his numbers? But he followed Horace so very close,"
2697,"MY LORD,",that of necessity he must fall with him; and I may safely say it of
2698,"MY LORD,","this present age, that if we are not so great wits as Donne, yet,"
2699,"MY LORD,","certainly, we are better poets."
2700,"MY LORD,",
2701,"MY LORD,","But I have said enough, and it may be too much, on this subject. Will"
2702,"MY LORD,","your lordship be pleased to prolong my audience, only so far, till I"
2703,"MY LORD,","tell you my own trivial thoughts, how a modern satire should be made."
2704,"MY LORD,",I will not deviate in the least from the precepts and examples of the
2705,"MY LORD,","ancients, who were always our best masters. I will only illustrate"
2706,"MY LORD,","them, and discover some of the hidden beauties in their designs, that"
2707,"MY LORD,",we thereby may form our own in imitation of them. Will you please
2708,"MY LORD,","but to observe, that Persius, the least in dignity of all the three,"
2709,"MY LORD,","has notwithstanding been the first, who has discovered to us this"
2710,"MY LORD,","important secret, in the designing of a perfect satire,--that it"
2711,"MY LORD,",ought only to treat of one subject;--to be confined to one particular
2712,"MY LORD,","theme; or, at least, to one principally. If other vices occur in the"
2713,"MY LORD,","management of the chief, they should only be transiently lashed, and"
2714,"MY LORD,","not be insisted on, so as to make the design double. As in a play of"
2715,"MY LORD,","the English fashion, which we call a tragi-comedy, there is to be but"
2716,"MY LORD,","one main design; and though there be an underplot, or second walk of"
2717,"MY LORD,","comical characters and adventures, yet they are subservient to the"
2718,"MY LORD,","chief fable, carried along under it, and helping to it; so that the"
2719,"MY LORD,","drama may not seem a monster with two heads. Thus, the Copernican"
2720,"MY LORD,",system of the planets makes the moon to be moved by the motion of the
2721,"MY LORD,","earth, and carried about her orb, as a dependent of her's. Mascardi,"
2722,"MY LORD,","in his discourse of the _Doppia favola_, or double tale in plays,"
2723,"MY LORD,","gives an instance of it in the famous pastoral of Guarini, called _Il"
2724,"MY LORD,",Pastor Fido_; where Corisca and the Satyr are the under parts; yet
2725,"MY LORD,","we may observe, that Corisca is brought into the body of the plot, and"
2726,"MY LORD,","made subservient to it. It is certain, that the divine wit of Horace"
2727,"MY LORD,","was not ignorant of this rule,--that a play, though it consists of"
2728,"MY LORD,","many parts, must yet be one in the action, and must drive on the"
2729,"MY LORD,","accomplishment of one design; for he gives this very precept,--_Sit"
2730,"MY LORD,",quodvis simplex duntaxat et unum_; yet he seems not much to mind it
2731,"MY LORD,","in his Satires, many of them consisting of more arguments than one; and"
2732,"MY LORD,",the second without dependence on the first. Casaubon has observed this
2733,"MY LORD,","before me, in his preference of Persius to Horace; and will have his"
2734,"MY LORD,",own beloved author to be the first who found out and introduced this
2735,"MY LORD,",method of confining himself to one subject. I know it may be urged in
2736,"MY LORD,","defence of Horace, that this unity is not necessary; because the very"
2737,"MY LORD,",word _satura_ signifies a dish plentifully stored with all variety of
2738,"MY LORD,","fruit and grains. Yet Juvenal, who calls his poems a _farrago_, which"
2739,"MY LORD,","is a word of the same signification with _satura_, has chosen to follow"
2740,"MY LORD,","the same method of Persius, and not of Horace; and Boileau, whose"
2741,"MY LORD,","example alone is a sufficient authority, has wholly confined himself,"
2742,"MY LORD,","in all his satires, to this unity of design. That variety, which is"
2743,"MY LORD,","not to be found in any one satire, is, at least, in many, written on"
2744,"MY LORD,",several occasions. And if variety be of absolute necessity in every
2745,"MY LORD,","one of them, according to the etymology of the word, yet it may arise"
2746,"MY LORD,","naturally from one subject, as it is diversely treated, in the several"
2747,"MY LORD,","subordinate branches of it, all relating to the chief. It may be"
2748,"MY LORD,",illustrated accordingly with variety of examples in the subdivisions
2749,"MY LORD,","of it, and with as many precepts as there are members of it; which,"
2750,"MY LORD,","altogether, may complete that _olla_, or hotchpotch, which is properly"
2751,"MY LORD,",a satire.
2752,"MY LORD,",
2753,"MY LORD,","Under this unity of theme, or subject, is comprehended another rule"
2754,"MY LORD,","for perfecting the design of true satire. The poet is bound, and that"
2755,"MY LORD,","_ex officio_, to give his reader some one precept of moral virtue,"
2756,"MY LORD,",and to caution him against some one particular vice or folly. Other
2757,"MY LORD,","virtues, subordinate to the first, may be recommended under that chief"
2758,"MY LORD,","head; and other vices or follies may be scourged, besides that which"
2759,"MY LORD,","he principally intends. But he is chiefly to inculcate one virtue, and"
2760,"MY LORD,","insist on that. Thus Juvenal, in every satire excepting the first, ties"
2761,"MY LORD,","himself to one principal instructive point, or to the shunning of moral"
2762,"MY LORD,","evil. Even in the sixth, which seems only an arraignment of the whole"
2763,"MY LORD,","sex of womankind, there is a latent admonition to avoid ill women,"
2764,"MY LORD,","by showing how very few, who are virtuous and good, are to be found"
2765,"MY LORD,","amongst them. But this, though the wittiest of all his satires, has yet"
2766,"MY LORD,",the least of truth or instruction in it. He has run himself into his
2767,"MY LORD,","old declamatory way, and almost forgotten that he was now setting up"
2768,"MY LORD,",for a moral poet.
2769,"MY LORD,",
2770,"MY LORD,","Persius is never wanting to us in some profitable doctrine, and in"
2771,"MY LORD,","exposing the opposite vices to it. His kind of philosophy is one, which"
2772,"MY LORD,",is the stoick; and every satire is a comment on one particular dogma
2773,"MY LORD,","of that sect, unless we will except the first, which is against bad"
2774,"MY LORD,",writers; and yet even there he forgets not the precepts of the Porch.
2775,"MY LORD,","In general, all virtues are every where to be praised and recommended"
2776,"MY LORD,","to practice; and all vices to be reprehended, and made either odious or"
2777,"MY LORD,",ridiculous; or else there is a fundamental error in the whole design.
2778,"MY LORD,",
2779,"MY LORD,",I have already declared who are the only persons that are the adequate
2780,"MY LORD,","object of private satire, and who they are that may properly be exposed"
2781,"MY LORD,",by name for public examples of vices and follies; and therefore I will
2782,"MY LORD,",trouble your lordship no farther with them. Of the best and finest
2783,"MY LORD,","manner of satire, I have said enough in the comparison betwixt Juvenal"
2784,"MY LORD,","and Horace: it is that sharp, well-mannered way of laughing a folly"
2785,"MY LORD,","out of countenance, of which your lordship is the best master in this"
2786,"MY LORD,","age. I will proceed to the versification, which is most proper for it,"
2787,"MY LORD,",and add somewhat to what I have said already on that subject. The sort
2788,"MY LORD,","of verse which is called burlesque, consisting of eight syllables, or"
2789,"MY LORD,","four feet, is that which our excellent Hudibras has chosen. I ought to"
2790,"MY LORD,","have mentioned him before, when I spoke of Donne: but by a slip of an"
2791,"MY LORD,",old man's memory he was forgotten. The worth of his poem is too well
2792,"MY LORD,","known to need my commendation, and he is above my censure. His satire"
2793,"MY LORD,","is of the Varronian kind, though unmixed with prose. The choice of his"
2794,"MY LORD,","numbers is suitable enough to his design, as he has managed it; but"
2795,"MY LORD,","in any other hand, the shortness of his verse, and the quick returns"
2796,"MY LORD,","of rhyme, had debased the dignity of style. And besides, the double"
2797,"MY LORD,","rhyme, (a necessary companion of burlesque writing,) is not so proper"
2798,"MY LORD,","for manly satire; for it turns earnest too much to jest, and gives us"
2799,"MY LORD,","a boyish kind of pleasure. It tickles aukwardly with a kind of pain,"
2800,"MY LORD,","to the best sort of readers: we are pleased ungratefully, and, if I"
2801,"MY LORD,","may say so, against our liking. We thank him not for giving us that"
2802,"MY LORD,","unseasonable delight, when we know he could have given us a better, and"
2803,"MY LORD,","more solid. He might have left that task to others, who, not being able"
2804,"MY LORD,","to put in thought, can only make us grin with the excrescence of a word"
2805,"MY LORD,","of two or three syllables in the close. It is, indeed, below so great"
2806,"MY LORD,",a master to make use of such a little instrument.[47] But his good
2807,"MY LORD,",sense is perpetually shining through all he writes; it affords us not
2808,"MY LORD,","the time of finding faults. We pass through the levity of his rhyme,"
2809,"MY LORD,",and are immediately carried into some admirable useful thought. After
2810,"MY LORD,","all, he has chosen this kind of verse, and has written the best in it:"
2811,"MY LORD,","and had he taken another, he would always have excelled: as we say of"
2812,"MY LORD,","a court-favourite, that whatsoever his office be, he still makes it"
2813,"MY LORD,","uppermost, and most beneficial to himself."
2814,"MY LORD,",
2815,"MY LORD,","The quickness of your imagination, my lord, has already prevented"
2816,"MY LORD,","me; and you know before-hand, that I would prefer the verse of ten"
2817,"MY LORD,","syllables, which we call the English heroic, to that of eight. This is"
2818,"MY LORD,",truly my opinion; for this sort of number is more roomy; the thought
2819,"MY LORD,",can turn itself with greater ease in a larger compass. When the rhyme
2820,"MY LORD,","comes too thick upon us, it straitens the expression; we are thinking"
2821,"MY LORD,","of the close, when we should be employed in adorning the thought."
2822,"MY LORD,",It makes a poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for his
2823,"MY LORD,","imagination; he loses many beauties, without gaining one advantage. For"
2824,"MY LORD,","a burlesque rhyme I have already concluded to be none; or, if it were,"
2825,"MY LORD,",it is more easily purchased in ten syllables than in eight. In both
2826,"MY LORD,","occasions it is as in a tennis-court, when the strokes of greater force"
2827,"MY LORD,","are given, when we strike out and play at length. Tassoni and Boileau"
2828,"MY LORD,","have left us the best examples of this way, in the ""Secchia Rapita,"""
2829,"MY LORD,","and the ""Lutrin;"" and next them Merlin Cocaius in his ""Baldus."" I"
2830,"MY LORD,","will speak only of the two former, because the last is written in"
2831,"MY LORD,","Latin verse. The ""Secchia Rapita"" is an Italian poem, a satire of the"
2832,"MY LORD,","Varronian kind. It is written in the stanza of eight, which is their"
2833,"MY LORD,","measure for heroic verse. The words are stately, the numbers smooth,"
2834,"MY LORD,",the turn both of thoughts and words is happy. The first six lines of
2835,"MY LORD,",the stanza seem majestical and severe; but the two last turn them
2836,"MY LORD,","all into a pleasant ridicule. Boileau, if I am not much deceived, has"
2837,"MY LORD,","modelled from hence his famous ""Lutrin."" He had read the burlesque"
2838,"MY LORD,","poetry of Scarron,[48] with some kind of indignation, as witty as it"
2839,"MY LORD,","was, and found nothing in France that was worthy of his imitation; but"
2840,"MY LORD,","he copied the Italian so well, that his own may pass for an original."
2841,"MY LORD,","He writes it in the French heroic verse, and calls it an heroic poem;"
2842,"MY LORD,","his subject is trivial, but his verse is noble. I doubt not but he had"
2843,"MY LORD,","Virgil in his eye, for we find many admirable imitations of him, and"
2844,"MY LORD,",some parodies; as particularly this passage in the fourth of the Æneids:
2845,"MY LORD,",
2846,"MY LORD,","_Nec tibi diva parens, generis nec Dardanus auctor,"
2847,"MY LORD,",Perfide; sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens
2848,"MY LORD,",Caucasus; Hyrcanæque admorûnt ubera tigres_:
2849,"MY LORD,",
2850,"MY LORD,","which he thus translates, keeping to the words, but altering the sense:"
2851,"MY LORD,",
2852,"MY LORD,","Non, ton pere a Paris, ne fut point boulanger:"
2853,"MY LORD,","Et tu n'es point du sang de Gervais, l'horloger:"
2854,"MY LORD,",Ta mere ne fut point la maitresse d'un coché;
2855,"MY LORD,",Caucase dans ses flancs te forma d'une roché:
2856,"MY LORD,","Une tigresse affreuse, en quelque antre écarté,"
2857,"MY LORD,","Te fit, avec son lait, succer sa cruauté."
2858,"MY LORD,",
2859,"MY LORD,","And, as Virgil in his fourth Georgick, of the Bees, perpetually raises"
2860,"MY LORD,","the lowness of his subject, by the loftiness of his words, and ennobles"
2861,"MY LORD,","it by comparisons drawn from empires, and from monarchs;--"
2862,"MY LORD,",
2863,"MY LORD,","_Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum,"
2864,"MY LORD,","Magnanimosque duces, totiusque ordine gentis"
2865,"MY LORD,","Mores et studia, et populos, et proelia dicam._"
2866,"MY LORD,",
2867,"MY LORD,",And again:
2868,"MY LORD,",
2869,"MY LORD,",_At genus immortale manet; multosque per annos
2870,"MY LORD,","Stat fortuna domus, et avi numerantur avorum;_--"
2871,"MY LORD,",
2872,"MY LORD,","we see Boileau pursuing him in the same flights, and scarcely yielding"
2873,"MY LORD,","to his master. This, I think, my lord, to be the most beautiful, and"
2874,"MY LORD,","most noble kind of satire. Here is the majesty of the heroic, finely"
2875,"MY LORD,",mixed with the venom of the other; and raising the delight which
2876,"MY LORD,","otherwise would be flat and vulgar, by the sublimity of the expression."
2877,"MY LORD,",I could say somewhat more of the delicacy of this and some other of his
2878,"MY LORD,","satires; but it might turn to his prejudice, if it were carried back to"
2879,"MY LORD,",France.
2880,"MY LORD,",
2881,"MY LORD,","I have given your lordship but this bare hint, in what verse and in"
2882,"MY LORD,","what manner this sort of satire may be best managed. Had I time, I"
2883,"MY LORD,","could enlarge on the beautiful turns of words and thoughts, which"
2884,"MY LORD,","are as requisite in this, as in heroic poetry itself, of which the"
2885,"MY LORD,","satire is undoubtedly a species. With these beautiful turns, I confess"
2886,"MY LORD,","myself to have been unacquainted, till about twenty years ago, in a"
2887,"MY LORD,","conversation which I had with that noble wit of Scotland, Sir George"
2888,"MY LORD,","Mackenzie,[49] he asked me why I did not imitate in my verses the"
2889,"MY LORD,",turns of Mr Waller and Sir John Denham; of which he repeated many to
2890,"MY LORD,","me. I had often read with pleasure, and with some profit, those two"
2891,"MY LORD,",fathers of our English poetry; but had not seriously enough considered
2892,"MY LORD,",those beauties which give the last perfection to their works. Some
2893,"MY LORD,",sprinklings of this kind I had also formerly in my plays; but they were
2894,"MY LORD,","casual, and not designed. But this hint, thus seasonably given me,"
2895,"MY LORD,","first made me sensible of my own wants, and brought me afterwards to"
2896,"MY LORD,",seek for the supply of them in other English authors. I looked over the
2897,"MY LORD,","darling of my youth, the famous Cowley; there I found, instead of them,"
2898,"MY LORD,","the points of wit, and quirks of epigram, even in the ""Davideis,"" an"
2899,"MY LORD,","heroic poem, which is of an opposite nature to those puerilities; but"
2900,"MY LORD,",no elegant turns either on the word or on the thought. Then I consulted
2901,"MY LORD,","a greater genius, (without offence to the manes of that noble author,)"
2902,"MY LORD,","I mean Milton; but as he endeavours every where to express Homer, whose"
2903,"MY LORD,","age had not arrived to that fineness, I found in him a true sublimity,"
2904,"MY LORD,","lofty thoughts, which were cloathed with admirable Grecisms, and"
2905,"MY LORD,","ancient words, which he had been digging from the mines of Chaucer and"
2906,"MY LORD,","Spenser, and which, with all their rusticity, had somewhat of venerable"
2907,"MY LORD,",in them. But I found not there neither that for which I looked. At last
2908,"MY LORD,","I had recourse to his master, Spenser, the author of that immortal"
2909,"MY LORD,","poem, called the ""Fairy Queen;"" and there I met with that which I"
2910,"MY LORD,",had been looking for so long in vain. Spenser had studied Virgil to
2911,"MY LORD,",as much advantage as Milton had done Homer; and amongst the rest of
2912,"MY LORD,","his excellencies had copied that. Looking farther into the Italian, I"
2913,"MY LORD,","found Tasso had done the same; nay more, that all the sonnets in that"
2914,"MY LORD,","language are on the turn of the first thought; which Mr Walsh, in his"
2915,"MY LORD,","late ingenious preface to his poems, has observed. In short, Virgil"
2916,"MY LORD,",and Ovid are the two principal fountains of them in Latin poetry.
2917,"MY LORD,","And the French at this day are so fond of them, that they judge them"
2918,"MY LORD,","to be the first beauties: _delicate et bien tourné_, are the highest"
2919,"MY LORD,","commendations which they bestow, on somewhat which they think a"
2920,"MY LORD,",master-piece.
2921,"MY LORD,",
2922,"MY LORD,","An example of the turn on words, amongst a thousand others, is that in"
2923,"MY LORD,","the last book of Ovid's ""Metamorphoses:"""
2924,"MY LORD,",
2925,"MY LORD,","_Heu! quantum scelus est, in viscera, viscera condi!"
2926,"MY LORD,",Congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus;
2927,"MY LORD,",Alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto._
2928,"MY LORD,",
2929,"MY LORD,","An example on the turn both of thoughts and words, is to be found in"
2930,"MY LORD,","Catullus, in the complaint of Ariadne, when she was left by Theseus;"
2931,"MY LORD,",
2932,"MY LORD,",_Tum jam nulla viro juranti fæmina credat;
2933,"MY LORD,",Nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles;
2934,"MY LORD,","Qui, dum aliquid cupiens animus prægestit apisci,"
2935,"MY LORD,","Nil metuunt jurare, nihil promittere parcunt:"
2936,"MY LORD,","Sed simul ac cupidæ mentis satiata libido est,"
2937,"MY LORD,","Dicta nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant._"
2938,"MY LORD,",
2939,"MY LORD,","An extraordinary turn upon the words, is that in Ovid's ""Epistolæ"
2940,"MY LORD,","Heroidum,"" of Sappho to Phaon."
2941,"MY LORD,",
2942,"MY LORD,","_Si, nisi quæ formâ poterit te digna videri,"
2943,"MY LORD,","Nulla futura tua est, nulla futura tua est._"
2944,"MY LORD,",
2945,"MY LORD,","Lastly: A turn, which I cannot say is absolutely on words, for the"
2946,"MY LORD,","thought turns with them, is in the fourth Georgick of Virgil; where"
2947,"MY LORD,","Orpheus is to receive his wife from hell, on express condition not to"
2948,"MY LORD,",look on her till she was come on earth:
2949,"MY LORD,",
2950,"MY LORD,",_Cùm subita incautum dementia cepit amantem;
2951,"MY LORD,","Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere Manes._"
2952,"MY LORD,",
2953,"MY LORD,",I will not burthen your lordship with more of them; for I write
2954,"MY LORD,",to a master who understands them better than myself. But I may
2955,"MY LORD,",safely conclude them to be great beauties.--I might descend also to
2956,"MY LORD,",the mechanic beauties of heroic verse; but we have yet no English
2957,"MY LORD,","_prosodia_, not so much as a tolerable dictionary, or a grammar; so"
2958,"MY LORD,",that our language is in a manner barbarous; and what government will
2959,"MY LORD,","encourage any one, or more, who are capable of refining it, I know not:"
2960,"MY LORD,",but nothing under a public expence can go through with it. And I rather
2961,"MY LORD,","fear a declination of the language, than hope an advancement of it in"
2962,"MY LORD,",the present age.
2963,"MY LORD,",
2964,"MY LORD,","I am still speaking to you, my lord, though, in all probability, you"
2965,"MY LORD,","are already out of hearing. Nothing, which my meanness can produce, is"
2966,"MY LORD,",worthy of this long attention. But I am come to the last petition of
2967,"MY LORD,","Abraham; if there be ten righteous lines, in this vast preface, spare"
2968,"MY LORD,","it for their sake; and also spare the next city, because it is but a"
2969,"MY LORD,",little one.
2970,"MY LORD,",
2971,"MY LORD,","I would excuse the performance of this translation, if it were all my"
2972,"MY LORD,","own; but the better, though not the greater part, being the work of"
2973,"MY LORD,","some gentlemen, who have succeeded very happily in their undertaking,"
2974,"MY LORD,","let their excellencies atone for my imperfections, and those of my"
2975,"MY LORD,","sons. I have perused some of the satires, which are done by other"
2976,"MY LORD,","hands; and they seem to me as perfect in their kind, as any thing I"
2977,"MY LORD,","have seen in English verse. The common way which we have taken, is not"
2978,"MY LORD,","a literal translation, but a kind of paraphrase; or somewhat, which"
2979,"MY LORD,","is yet more loose, betwixt a paraphrase and imitation. It was not"
2980,"MY LORD,","possible for us, or any men, to have made it pleasant any other way."
2981,"MY LORD,","If rendering the exact sense of those authors, almost line for line,"
2982,"MY LORD,","had been our business, Barten Holyday had done it already to our hands:"
2983,"MY LORD,","and, by the help of his learned notes and illustrations, not only"
2984,"MY LORD,","Juvenal and Persius, but, what yet is more obscure, his own verses,"
2985,"MY LORD,",might be understood.
2986,"MY LORD,",
2987,"MY LORD,","But he wrote for fame, and wrote to scholars: we write only for the"
2988,"MY LORD,","pleasure and entertainment of those gentlemen and ladies, who, though"
2989,"MY LORD,","they are not scholars, are not ignorant: persons of understanding"
2990,"MY LORD,","and good sense, who, not having been conversant in the original, or"
2991,"MY LORD,",at least not having made Latin verse so much their business as to be
2992,"MY LORD,","critics in it, would be glad to find, if the wit of our two great"
2993,"MY LORD,",authors be answerable to their fame and reputation in the world. We
2994,"MY LORD,","have, therefore, endeavoured to give the public all the satisfaction we"
2995,"MY LORD,",are able in this kind.
2996,"MY LORD,",
2997,"MY LORD,","And if we are not altogether so faithful to our author, as our"
2998,"MY LORD,","predecessors Holyday and Stapylton, yet we may challenge to ourselves"
2999,"MY LORD,","this praise, that we shall be far more pleasing to our readers. We have"
3000,"MY LORD,","followed our authors at greater distance, though not step by step,"
3001,"MY LORD,","as they have done: for oftentimes they have gone so close, that they"
3002,"MY LORD,","have trod on the heels of Juvenal and Persius, and hurt them by their"
3003,"MY LORD,",too near approach. A noble author would not be pursued too close by a
3004,"MY LORD,","translator. We lose his spirit, when we think to take his body. The"
3005,"MY LORD,","grosser part remains with us, but the soul is flown away in some noble"
3006,"MY LORD,","expression, or some delicate turn of words, or thought. Thus Holyday,"
3007,"MY LORD,","who made this way his choice, seized the meaning of Juvenal; but the"
3008,"MY LORD,",poetry has always escaped him.
3009,"MY LORD,",
3010,"MY LORD,","They who will not grant me, that pleasure is one of the ends of"
3011,"MY LORD,","poetry, but that it is only a means of compassing the only end, which"
3012,"MY LORD,","is instruction, must yet allow, that, without the means of pleasure,"
3013,"MY LORD,",the instruction is but a bare and dry philosophy: a crude preparation
3014,"MY LORD,","of morals, which we may have from Aristotle and Epictetus, with more"
3015,"MY LORD,",profit than from any poet. Neither Holyday nor Stapylton have imitated
3016,"MY LORD,",Juvenal in the poetical part of him--his diction and his elocution.
3017,"MY LORD,","Nor had they been poets, as neither of them were, yet, in the way they"
3018,"MY LORD,","took, it was impossible for them to have succeeded in the poetic part."
3019,"MY LORD,",
3020,"MY LORD,","The English verse, which we call heroic, consists of no more than ten"
3021,"MY LORD,","syllables; the Latin hexameter sometimes rises to seventeen; as, for"
3022,"MY LORD,","example, this verse in Virgil:"
3023,"MY LORD,",
3024,"MY LORD,",_Pulverulenta putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum._
3025,"MY LORD,",
3026,"MY LORD,","Here is the difference of no less than seven syllables in a line,"
3027,"MY LORD,",betwixt the English and the Latin. Now the medium of these is about
3028,"MY LORD,",fourteen syllables; because the dactyle is a more frequent foot in
3029,"MY LORD,","hexameters than the spondee. But Holyday, without considering that he"
3030,"MY LORD,","wrote with the disadvantage of four syllables less in every verse,"
3031,"MY LORD,",endeavours to make one of his lines to comprehend the sense of one of
3032,"MY LORD,",Juvenal's. According to the falsity of the proposition was the success.
3033,"MY LORD,","He was forced to crowd his verse with ill-sounding monosyllables, of"
3034,"MY LORD,",which our barbarous language affords him a wild plenty; and by that
3035,"MY LORD,","means he arrived at his pedantic end, which was to make a literal"
3036,"MY LORD,","translation. His verses have nothing of verse in them, but only the"
3037,"MY LORD,","worst part of it--the rhyme; and that, into the bargain, is far from"
3038,"MY LORD,","good. But, which is more intolerable, by cramming his ill-chosen, and"
3039,"MY LORD,","worse-sounding monosyllables so close together, the very sense which"
3040,"MY LORD,","he endeavours to explain, is become more obscure than that of his"
3041,"MY LORD,","author; so that Holyday himself cannot be understood, without as large"
3042,"MY LORD,",a commentary as that which he makes on his two authors. For my own
3043,"MY LORD,","part, I can make a shift to find the meaning of Juvenal without his"
3044,"MY LORD,",notes: but his translation is more difficult than his author. And I
3045,"MY LORD,","find beauties in the Latin to recompense my pains; but, in Holyday and"
3046,"MY LORD,","Stapylton, my ears, in the first place, are mortally offended; and then"
3047,"MY LORD,","their sense is so perplexed, that I return to the original, as the more"
3048,"MY LORD,","pleasing task, as well as the more easy.[50]"
3049,"MY LORD,",
3050,"MY LORD,","This must be said for our translation, that, if we give not the whole"
3051,"MY LORD,","sense of Juvenal, yet we give the most considerable part of it: we give"
3052,"MY LORD,","it, in general, so clearly, that few notes are sufficient to make us"
3053,"MY LORD,",intelligible. We make our author at least appear in a poetic dress. We
3054,"MY LORD,","have actually made him more sounding, and more elegant, than he was"
3055,"MY LORD,",before in English; and have endeavoured to make him speak that kind
3056,"MY LORD,","of English, which he would have spoken had he lived in England, and"
3057,"MY LORD,",had written to this age. If sometimes any of us (and it is but seldom)
3058,"MY LORD,",make him express the customs and manners of our native country rather
3059,"MY LORD,","than of Rome, it is, either when there was some kind of analogy betwixt"
3060,"MY LORD,","their customs and ours, or when, to make him more easy to vulgar"
3061,"MY LORD,","understandings, we give him those manners which are familiar to us."
3062,"MY LORD,","But I defend not this innovation, it is enough if I can excuse it."
3063,"MY LORD,","For, to speak sincerely, the manners of nations and ages are not to be"
3064,"MY LORD,","confounded; we should either make them English, or leave them Roman. If"
3065,"MY LORD,","this can neither be defended nor excused, let it be pardoned at least,"
3066,"MY LORD,","because it is acknowledged; and so much the more easily, as being a"
3067,"MY LORD,",fault which is never committed without some pleasure to the reader.
3068,"MY LORD,",
3069,"MY LORD,","Thus, my lord, having troubled you with a tedious visit, the best"
3070,"MY LORD,",manners will be shewn in the least ceremony. I will slip away while
3071,"MY LORD,","your back is turned, and while you are otherwise employed; with great"
3072,"MY LORD,","confusion for having entertained you so long with this discourse, and"
3073,"MY LORD,","for having no other recompence to make you, than the worthy labours of"

4715,THE ARGUMENT.,"_This Satire, of almost double length to any of the rest, is"
4716,THE ARGUMENT.,"a bitter invective against the fair sex. It is, indeed, a"
4717,THE ARGUMENT.,"common-place, from whence all the moderns have notoriously"
4718,THE ARGUMENT.,"stolen their sharpest railleries. In his other satires,"
4719,THE ARGUMENT.,"the poet has only glanced on some particular women, and"
4720,THE ARGUMENT.,generally scourged the men; but this he reserved wholly for
4721,THE ARGUMENT.,"the ladies. How they had offended him, I know not; but,"
4722,THE ARGUMENT.,"upon the whole matter, he is not to be excused for imputing"
4723,THE ARGUMENT.,"to all, the vices of some few amongst them. Neither was"
4724,THE ARGUMENT.,"it generously done of him, to attack the weakest, as well"
4725,THE ARGUMENT.,"as the fairest, part of the creation; neither do I know"
4726,THE ARGUMENT.,what moral he could reasonably draw from it. It could not
4727,THE ARGUMENT.,"be to avoid the whole sex, if all had been true which he"
4728,THE ARGUMENT.,alleges against them; for that had been to put an end to
4729,THE ARGUMENT.,"human kind. And to bid us beware of their artifices, is"
4730,THE ARGUMENT.,"a kind of silent acknowledgment, that they have more wit"
4731,THE ARGUMENT.,"than men; which turns the satire upon us, and particularly"
4732,THE ARGUMENT.,"upon the poet, who thereby makes a compliment, where he"
4733,THE ARGUMENT.,"meant a libel. If he intended only to exercise his wit, he"
4734,THE ARGUMENT.,"has forfeited his judgment, by making the one half of his"
4735,THE ARGUMENT.,"readers his mortal enemies; and amongst the men, all the"
4736,THE ARGUMENT.,"happy lovers, by their own experience, will disprove his"
4737,THE ARGUMENT.,accusations. The whole world must allow this to be the
4738,THE ARGUMENT.,wittiest of his satires; and truly he had need of all his
4739,THE ARGUMENT.,"parts, to maintain, with so much violence, so unjust a"
4740,THE ARGUMENT.,charge. I am satisfied he will bring but few over to his
4741,THE ARGUMENT.,opinion; and on that consideration chiefly I ventured to
4742,THE ARGUMENT.,"trans late him. Though there wanted not another reason,"
4743,THE ARGUMENT.,"which was, that no one else would undertake it; at"
4744,THE ARGUMENT.,"least, Sir C. S., who could have done more right to the"
4745,THE ARGUMENT.,"author, after a long delay, at length absolutely refused"
4746,THE ARGUMENT.,"so ungrateful an employment; and every one will grant,"
4747,THE ARGUMENT.,"that the work must have been imperfect and lame, if it had"
4748,THE ARGUMENT.,appeared without one of the principal members belonging
4749,THE ARGUMENT.,"to it. Let the poet, therefore, bear the blame of his own"
4750,THE ARGUMENT.,"invention; and let me satisfy the world, that I am not of"
4751,THE ARGUMENT.,"his opinion. Whatever his Roman ladies were, the English"
4752,THE ARGUMENT.,are free from all his imputations. They will read with
4753,THE ARGUMENT.,"wonder and abhorrence the vices of an age, which was the"
4754,THE ARGUMENT.,most infamous of any on record. They will bless themselves
4755,THE ARGUMENT.,"when they behold those examples, related of Domitian's"
4756,THE ARGUMENT.,time; they will give back to antiquity those monsters it
4757,THE ARGUMENT.,"produced, and believe, with reason, that the species of"
4758,THE ARGUMENT.,"those women is extinguished, or, at least, that they were"
4759,THE ARGUMENT.,"never here propagated. I may safely, therefore, proceed"
4760,THE ARGUMENT.,"to the argument of a satire, which is no way relating to"
4761,THE ARGUMENT.,"them; and first observe, that my author makes their lust"
4762,THE ARGUMENT.,the most heroic of their vices; the rest are in a manner
4763,THE ARGUMENT.,"but digression. He skims them over, but he dwells on this;"
4764,THE ARGUMENT.,"when he seems to have taken his last leave of it, on the"
4765,THE ARGUMENT.,"sudden he returns to it: It is one branch of it in Hippia,"
4766,THE ARGUMENT.,"another in Messalina, but lust is the main body of the tree."
4767,THE ARGUMENT.,"He begins with this text in the first line, and takes it"
4768,THE ARGUMENT.,"up, with intermissions, to the end of the chapter. Every"
4769,THE ARGUMENT.,"vice is a loader, but that is a ten. The fillers, or"
4770,THE ARGUMENT.,"intermediate parts, are--their revenge; their contrivances"
4771,THE ARGUMENT.,of secret crimes; their arts to hide them; their wit to
4772,THE ARGUMENT.,"excuse them; and their impudence to own them, when they can"
4773,THE ARGUMENT.,no longer be kept secret. Then the persons to whom they
4774,THE ARGUMENT.,"are most addicted, and on whom they commonly bestow the"
4775,THE ARGUMENT.,"last favours, as stage-players, fiddlers, singing-boys, and"
4776,THE ARGUMENT.,"fencers. Those who pass for chaste amongst them, are not"
4777,THE ARGUMENT.,"really so; but only, for their vast doweries, are rather"
4778,THE ARGUMENT.,"suffered, than loved, by their own husbands. That they are"
4779,THE ARGUMENT.,"imperious, domineering, scolding wives; set up for learning,"
4780,THE ARGUMENT.,and criticism in poetry; but are false judges: Love to
4781,THE ARGUMENT.,"speak Greek, (which was then the fashionable tongue, as"
4782,THE ARGUMENT.,"French is now with us). That they plead causes at the bar,"
4783,THE ARGUMENT.,and play prizes at the bear-garden: That they are gossips
4784,THE ARGUMENT.,"and newsmongers; wrangle with their neighbours abroad,"
4785,THE ARGUMENT.,and beat their servants at home: That they lie-in for new
4786,THE ARGUMENT.,faces once a month; are sluttish with their husbands in
4787,THE ARGUMENT.,"private, and paint and dress in public for their lovers: That"
4788,THE ARGUMENT.,"they deal with Jews, diviners, and fortune-tellers; learn"
4789,THE ARGUMENT.,"the arts of miscarrying and barrenness; buy children, and"
4790,THE ARGUMENT.,"produce them for their own; murder their husbands' sons,"
4791,THE ARGUMENT.,"if they stand in their way to his estate, and make their"
4792,THE ARGUMENT.,adulterers his heirs. From hence the poet proceeds to show
4793,THE ARGUMENT.,"the occasions of all these vices, their original, and how"
4794,THE ARGUMENT.,"they were introduced in Rome by peace, wealth, and luxury."
4795,THE ARGUMENT.,"In conclusion, if we will take the word of our malicious"
4796,THE ARGUMENT.,"author, bad women are the general standing rule; and the"
4797,THE ARGUMENT.,"good, but some few exceptions to it._"

5858,THE ARGUMENT.,"He moves, in the dull ceremonial track,"
5859,THE ARGUMENT.,With Jove's embroidered coat upon his back!
5860,THE ARGUMENT.,A suit of hangings had not more opprest

6723,ARGUMENT.,"also bad orators, who began at that time (as Petronius"
6724,ARGUMENT.,in the beginning of his book tells us) to enervate manly
6725,ARGUMENT.,"eloquence by tropes and figures, ill placed, and worse"
6726,ARGUMENT.,"applied. Amongst the poets, Persius covertly strikes"
6727,ARGUMENT.,at Nero; some of whose verses he recites with scorn and
6728,ARGUMENT.,"indignation. He also takes notice of the noblemen, and"
6729,ARGUMENT.,"their abominable poetry, who, in the luxury of their"
6730,ARGUMENT.,"fortunes, set up for wits and judges. The Satire is in"
6731,ARGUMENT.,"dialogue betwixt the author, and his friend, or monitor;"
6732,ARGUMENT.,who dissuades him from this dangerous attempt of exposing
6733,ARGUMENT.,"great men. But Persius, who is of a free spirit, and has"
6734,ARGUMENT.,"not forgotten that Rome was once a commonwealth, breaks"
6735,ARGUMENT.,"through all those difficulties, and boldly arraigns the"
6736,ARGUMENT.,false judgment of the age in which he lives. The reader may

7576,SATIRE II.,
7577,SATIRE II.,"It was the opinion both of Grecians and Romans, that the gods, in"
7578,SATIRE II.,"visions and dreams, often revealed to their favourites a cure for"
7579,SATIRE II.,"their diseases, and sometimes those of others. Thus Alexander dreamed"
7580,SATIRE II.,of an herb which cured Ptolemy. These gods were principally Apollo
7581,SATIRE II.,"and Esculapius; but, in aftertimes, the same virtue and good-will was"
7582,SATIRE II.,attributed to Isis and Osiris. Which brings to my remembrance an odd
7583,SATIRE II.,"passage in Sir Thomas Brown's Religio Medici, or in his Vulgar Errors;"
7584,SATIRE II.,"the sense whereof is, that we are beholden, for many of our discoveries"
7585,SATIRE II.,"in physic, to the courteous revelation of spirits. By the expression,"
7586,SATIRE II.,"of ""visions purged from phlegm,"" our author means such dreams or"
7587,SATIRE II.,"visions as proceed not from natural causes, or humours of the body, but"
7588,SATIRE II.,"such as are sent from heaven; and are, therefore, certain remedies."

8122,THE ARGUMENT.,poem of his Pharsalia; for his very compliment looked
8123,THE ARGUMENT.,"asquint, as well as Nero.[219] Persius has been bolder,"
8124,THE ARGUMENT.,"but with caution likewise. For here, in the person of"
8125,THE ARGUMENT.,"young Alcibiades, he arraigns his ambition of meddling"
8126,THE ARGUMENT.,"with state-affairs without judgment, or experience. It is"
8127,THE ARGUMENT.,"probable, that he makes Seneca, in this satire, sustain"
8128,THE ARGUMENT.,"the part of Socrates, under a borrowed name; and, withal,"
8129,THE ARGUMENT.,"discovers some secret vices of Nero, concerning his lust,"
8130,THE ARGUMENT.,"his drunkenness, find his effeminacy, which had not yet"
8131,THE ARGUMENT.,arrived to public notice. He also reprehends the flattery
8132,THE ARGUMENT.,"of his courtiers, who endeavoured to make all his vices"
8133,THE ARGUMENT.,pass for virtues. Covetousness was undoubtedly none of his
8134,THE ARGUMENT.,faults; but it is here described as a veil cast over the true
8135,THE ARGUMENT.,"meaning of the poet, which was to satirize his prodigality"
8136,THE ARGUMENT.,and voluptuousness; to which he makes a transition. I find
8137,THE ARGUMENT.,"no instance in history of that emperor's being a Pathic,"
8138,THE ARGUMENT.,though Persius seems to brand him with it. From the two
8139,THE ARGUMENT.,"dialogues of Plato, both called ""Alcibiades,"" the poet"
8140,THE ARGUMENT.,took the arguments of the second and third satires; but he
8141,THE ARGUMENT.,"inverted the order of them, for the third satire is taken"
8142,THE ARGUMENT.,from the first of those dialogues._
8143,THE ARGUMENT.,
8144,THE ARGUMENT.,_The commentators before Casaubon were ignorant of our author's
8145,THE ARGUMENT.,secret meaning; and thought he had only written against

8148,THE ARGUMENT.,"unravelled the whole mystery, and made it apparent, that"

8396,SATIRE IV.,"performed in the circus, or public place ordained for them. These five"
8397,SATIRE IV.,"he reckons up in this manner: 1. The Cæstus, or Whirlbatts, described"
8398,SATIRE IV.,by Virgil in his fifth Æneid; and this was the most dangerous of all
8399,SATIRE IV.,"the rest. The 2d was the foot-race. The 3d, the discus; like the"
8400,SATIRE IV.,"throwing a weighty ball; a sport now used in Cornwall, and other parts"
8401,SATIRE IV.,"of England; we may see it daily practised in Red-Lyon Fields. The 4th,"

8457,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this reason I have selected it from all the others,"

8459,THE ARGUMENT.,I am not only obliged myself for the best part of my own

8461,THE ARGUMENT.,from him the first and truest taste of Persius. May he be
8462,THE ARGUMENT.,"pleased to find, in this translation, the gratitude, or at"
8463,THE ARGUMENT.,"least some small acknowledgment, of his unworthy scholar,"
8464,THE ARGUMENT.,at the distance of forty-two years from the time when I
8465,THE ARGUMENT.,departed from under his tuition. This Satire consists of
8466,THE ARGUMENT.,two distinct parts: The first contains the praises of
8467,THE ARGUMENT.,"the stoic philosopher, Cornutus, master and tutor to our"
8468,THE ARGUMENT.,Persius; it also declares the love and piety of Persius to
8469,THE ARGUMENT.,his well-deserving master; and the mutual friendship which
8470,THE ARGUMENT.,"continued betwixt them, after Persius was now grown a man;"
8471,THE ARGUMENT.,"as also his exhortation to young noblemen, that they would"
8472,THE ARGUMENT.,enter themselves into his institution. From hence he makes
8473,THE ARGUMENT.,an artful transition into the second part of his subject;
8474,THE ARGUMENT.,"wherein he first complains of the sloth of scholars, and"
8475,THE ARGUMENT.,afterwards persuades them to the pursuit of their true
8476,THE ARGUMENT.,liberty. Here our author excellently treats that paradox of
8477,THE ARGUMENT.,"the Stoics, which affirms, that the wise or virtuous man is"
8478,THE ARGUMENT.,"only free, and that all vicious men are naturally slaves;"

9109,THE ARGUMENT.,_This Sixth Satire treats an admirable common-place of moral
9110,THE ARGUMENT.,"philosophy, of the true use of riches. They are certainly"
9111,THE ARGUMENT.,"intended by the Power who bestows them, as instruments"
9112,THE ARGUMENT.,and helps of living commodiously ourselves; and of
9113,THE ARGUMENT.,"administering to the wants of others, who are oppressed"
9114,THE ARGUMENT.,by fortune. There are two extremes in the opinions of men
9115,THE ARGUMENT.,"concerning them. One error, though on the right hand,"
9116,THE ARGUMENT.,"yet a great one, is, that they are no helps to a virtuous"
9117,THE ARGUMENT.,life; the other places all our happiness in the acquisition
9118,THE ARGUMENT.,and possession of them; and this is undoubtedly the worse
9119,THE ARGUMENT.,"extreme. The mean betwixt these, is the opinion of the"
9120,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stoics, which is, that riches may be useful to the leading"
9121,THE ARGUMENT.,a virtuous life; in case we rightly understand how to give
9122,THE ARGUMENT.,"according to right reason, and how to receive what is"
9123,THE ARGUMENT.,"given us by others. The virtue of giving well, is called"
9124,THE ARGUMENT.,liberality; and it is of this virtue that Persius writes
9125,THE ARGUMENT.,"in this satire, wherein he not only shows the lawful use"
9126,THE ARGUMENT.,"of riches, but also sharply inveighs against the vices"
9127,THE ARGUMENT.,"which are opposed to it; and especially of those, which"
9128,THE ARGUMENT.,"consist in the defects of giving, or spending, or in the"
9129,THE ARGUMENT.,"abuse of riches. He writes to Cæsius Bassus, his friend,"
9130,THE ARGUMENT.,and a poet also. Enquires first of his health and studies;
9131,THE ARGUMENT.,"and afterwards informs him of his own, and where he is"

9133,THE ARGUMENT.,"endeavouring, by little and little, to wear off his vices;"
9134,THE ARGUMENT.,"and, particularly, that he is combating ambition, and the"
9135,THE ARGUMENT.,desire of wealth. He dwells upon the latter vice; and being
9136,THE ARGUMENT.,"sensible, that few men either desire, or use, riches as"

9376,SATIRE VI.,"All the studious, and particularly the poets, about the end of August,"
9377,SATIRE VI.,"began to set themselves on work, refraining from writing during the"
9378,SATIRE VI.,"heats of the summer. They wrote by night, and sat up the greatest part"
9379,SATIRE VI.,of it; for which reason the product of their studies was called their
9380,SATIRE VI.,"elucubrations, or nightly labours. They who had country-seats retired"
9381,SATIRE VI.,"to them while they studied, as Persius did to his, which was near"
9382,SATIRE VI.,"the port of the Moon in Etruria; and Bassus to his, which was in the"

9390,SATIRE VI.,"This proves Cæsius Bassus to have been a lyric poet. It is said of him,"
9391,SATIRE VI.,"that by an eruption of the flaming mountain Vesuvius, near which the"
9392,SATIRE VI.,"greatest part of his fortune lay, he was burnt himself, together with"
9393,SATIRE VI.,all his writings.

9400,SATIRE VI.,
9401,SATIRE VI.,"I call it a drunken dream of Ennius; not that my author, in this place,"
9402,SATIRE VI.,"gives me any encouragement for the epithet, but because Horace, and"
9403,SATIRE VI.,"all who mention Ennius, say he was an excessive drinker of wine. In"
9404,SATIRE VI.,"a dream, or vision, call you it which you please, he thought it was"
9405,SATIRE VI.,"revealed to him, that the soul of Pythagoras was transmigrated into"
9406,SATIRE VI.,"him; as Pythagoras before him believed, that himself had been Euphorbus"
9407,SATIRE VI.,in the wars of Troy. Commentators differ in placing the order of this
9408,SATIRE VI.,"soul, and who had it first. I have here given it to the peacock;"
9409,SATIRE VI.,"because it looks more according to the order of nature, that it should"
9410,SATIRE VI.,"lodge in a creature of an inferior species, and so by gradation rise to"
9411,SATIRE VI.,"the informing of a man. And Persius favours me, by saying, that Ennius"
9412,SATIRE VI.,was the fifth from the Pythagorean peacock.

9418,SATIRE VI.,
9419,SATIRE VI.,"Perhaps this is only a fine transition of the poet, to introduce the"
9420,SATIRE VI.,business of the satire; and not that any such accident had happened to
9421,SATIRE VI.,"one of the friends of Persius. But, however, this is the most poetical"
9422,SATIRE VI.,description of any in our author; and since he and Lucan were so great
9423,SATIRE VI.,"friends, I know not but Lucan might help him in two or three of these"
9424,SATIRE VI.,"verses, which seem to be written in his style; certain it is, that"
9425,SATIRE VI.,"besides this description of a shipwreck, and two lines more, which"
9426,SATIRE VI.,"are at the end of the second satire, our poet has written nothing"
9427,SATIRE VI.,"elegantly. I will, therefore, transcribe both the passages, to justify"
9428,SATIRE VI.,"my opinion. The following are the last verses, saving one, of the"
9429,SATIRE VI.,second satire:
9430,SATIRE VI.,
9431,SATIRE VI.,"_Compositum jus, fasque animi; sanctosque recessus"
9432,SATIRE VI.,"Mentis, et incoctum generoso pectus honesto._"

9447,SATIRE VI.,
9448,SATIRE VI.,"The Latin is, _Nunc et de cespite vivo, frange aliquid_. Casaubon only"
9449,SATIRE VI.,"opposes the _cespes vivus_, which, word for word, is the living turf,"
9450,SATIRE VI.,"to the harvest, or annual income; I suppose the poet rather means, sell"
9451,SATIRE VI.,"a piece of land already sown, and give the money of it to my friend,"
9452,SATIRE VI.,"who has lost all by shipwreck; that is, do not stay till thou hast"

9459,SATIRE VI.,
9460,SATIRE VI.,Holyday translates it a green table: the sense is the same; for the
9461,SATIRE VI.,"table was painted of the sea-colour, which the shipwrecked person"
9462,SATIRE VI.,"carried on his back, expressing his losses, thereby to excite the"
9463,SATIRE VI.,charity of the spectators.

9469,SATIRE VI.,
9470,SATIRE VI.,"The bodies of the rich, before they were burnt, were embalmed with"
9471,SATIRE VI.,spices; or rather spices were put into the urn with the relics of the
9472,SATIRE VI.,"ashes. Our author here names cinnamum and cassia, which cassia was"
9473,SATIRE VI.,"sophisticated with cherry-gum, and probably enough by the Jews, who"
9474,SATIRE VI.,adulterate all things which they sell. But whether the ancients were
9475,SATIRE VI.,"acquainted with the spices of the Molucca Islands, Ceylon, and other"
9476,SATIRE VI.,"parts of the Indies, or whether their pepper and cinnamon, &c. were the"
9477,SATIRE VI.,"same with ours, is another question. As for nutmegs and mace, it is"
9478,SATIRE VI.,plain that the Latin names for them are modern.

9489,SATIRE VI.,"and the Empress Cæsonia, whom I here call queen; though I know that"
9490,SATIRE VI.,name was not used amongst the Romans; but the word empress would not
9491,SATIRE VI.,"stand in that verse, for which reason I adjourned it to another. The"
9492,SATIRE VI.,"dust, which was to be swept away from the altars, was either the ashes"
9493,SATIRE VI.,"which were left there after the last sacrifice for victory, or might"
9494,SATIRE VI.,perhaps mean the dust or ashes which were left on the altars since some

9571,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"This great work was undertaken by Dryden, in 1694, and published,"
9572,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"by subscription, in 1697. One hundred and one subscribers gave five"
9573,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,guineas each to furnish the engravings for the work; if indeed this
9574,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,was any thing more than a genteel pretext for increasing the profit
9575,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"of the author; for Spence has informed us, that the old plates used"
9576,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"for Ogleby's ""Virgil,"" were retouched for that of his great successor."
9577,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"Another class of subscribers, two hundred and fifty-two in number,"
9578,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,contributed two guineas each. As the names of those who encouraged this
9579,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"great national labour have some claim to distinction, the reader will"
9580,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"find, prefixed to this edition, an accurate copy of both lists, as they"
9581,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"stand in the first folio edition. On 28th June, 1697, the following"
9582,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,advertisement appeared in the London Gazette:
9583,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,
9584,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"""The Works of Virgil; containing his Pastorals, Georgics, and Eneis,"
9585,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"translated into English verse, by Mr Dryden, and adorned with one"
9586,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"hundred cuts, will be finished this week, and be ready next week to be"
9587,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"delivered, as subscribed for, in quires, upon bringing the receipt for"
9588,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"the first payment, and paying the second. Printed for Jacob Tonson, &c."""
9589,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,
9590,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"In 1709, Tonson published a second edition of Dryden's ""Virgil,"""
9591,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"with the plates reduced, in three volumes, 8vo; and various others"
9592,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"have since appeared. In 1803, a new edition was given to the public,"
9593,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"revised and corrected by Henry Carey, LL.D. This is so correct, that,"
9594,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,although it has been uniformly compared with the original edition of
9595,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"Tonson, I have thought it advisable to follow the modern editor in some"
9596,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"corrections of the punctuation and reading. In other cases, where I"
9597,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"have adhered to the folio, I have placed Dr Carey's alteration at the"
9598,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,"bottom of the page. It is hardly worth while to notice, that there is"
9599,WORKS OF VIRGIL.,a slight alteration of the arrangement of Dryden's prolegomena; the

10552,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",exactly resembling the constellation called _Ursa Major_. But Virgil
10553,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","had other helps; the predictions of Cicero and Catulus,[272] and that"
10554,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","vote of the senate had gone abroad, that no child, born at Rome in the"

10569,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Saviour of the world, to the person of Octavius; it being a usual piece"

10572,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","probable, that Virgil predicted to him the empire at this time. And it"
10573,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","will appear yet the more, if we consider, that he assures him of his"
10574,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","being received into the number of the gods, in his First Pastoral, long"
10575,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",before the thing came to pass; which prediction seems grounded upon
10576,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",his former mistake. This was a secret not to be divulged at that time;
10577,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",and therefore it is no wonder that the slight story in Donatus was
10578,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","given abroad to palliate the matter. But certain it is, that Octavius"

10584,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","learned men; above all, he was a man of honour in those critical times."
10585,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",He had joined with Octavius and Antony in revenging the barbarous

10587,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","would neither follow Antony, whose courses he detested, nor join"
10588,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","with Octavius against him, out of a grateful sense of some former"

10670,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","of policy, had gained the veteran legions into his service, and, by"
10671,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","that step, outwitted all the republican senate. They grew now very"
10672,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","clamorous for their pay; the treasury being exhausted, he was forced"
10673,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",to make assignments upon land; and none but in Italy itself would
10674,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","content them. He pitched upon Cremona, as the most distant from Rome;"
10675,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","but that not sufficing, he afterwards threw in part of the state of"
10676,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Mantua. Cremona was a rich and noble colony, settled a little before"
10677,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","the invasion of Hannibal. During that tedious and bloody war, they"
10678,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","had done several important services to the commonwealth; and, when"
10679,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","eighteen other colonies, pleading poverty and depopulation, refused to"
10680,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","contribute money, or to raise recruits, they of Cremona voluntarily"
10681,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",paid a double quota of both. But past services are a fruitless plea;
10682,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",civil wars are one continued act of ingratitude. In vain did the
10683,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","miserable mothers, with their famishing infants in their arms, fill"
10684,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","the streets with their numbers, and the air with lamentations; the"
10685,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","craving legions were to be satisfied at any rate. Virgil, involved in"
10686,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","the common calamity, had recourse to his old patron, Pollio; but he"
10687,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","was, at this time, under a cloud; however, compassionating so worthy a"
10688,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","man, not of a make to struggle through the world, he did what he could,"
10689,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","and recommended him to Mæcenas, with whom he still kept a private"
10690,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",correspondence. The name of this great man being much better known
10691,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","than one part of his character, the reader, I presume, will not be"
10692,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",displeased if I supply it in this place.
10693,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",
10694,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Though he was of as deep reach, and easy dispatch of business, as any"
10695,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","in his time, yet he designedly lived beneath his true character. Men"
10696,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","had oftentimes meddled in public affairs, that they might have more"
10697,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","ability to furnish for their pleasures: Mæcenas, by the honestest"
10698,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","hypocrisy that ever was, pretended to a life of pleasure, that he"
10699,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",might render more effectual service to his master. He seemed wholly
10700,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","to amuse himself with the diversions of the town, but, under that"
10701,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","mask, was the greatest minister of his age. He would be carried in a"
10702,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","careless, effeminate posture through the streets in his chair, even to"
10703,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",the degree of a proverb; and yet there was not a cabal of ill-disposed
10704,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","persons which he had not early notice of, and that too in a city as"
10705,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","large as London and Paris, and perhaps two or three more of the most"
10706,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","populous, put together. No man better understood that art so necessary"
10707,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",to the great--the art of declining envy. Being but of a gentleman's
10708,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","family, not patrician, he would not provoke the nobility by accepting"
10709,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","invidious honours, but wisely satisfied himself, that he had the ear of"
10710,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Augustus, and the secret of the empire. He seems to have committed but"
10711,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","one great fault, which was, the trusting a secret of high consequence"
10712,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","to his wife; but his master, enough uxorious himself, made his own"
10713,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","frailty more excusable, by generously forgiving that of his favourite:"
10714,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","he kept, in all his greatness, exact measures with his friends;"
10715,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","and, chusing them wisely, found, by experience, that good sense and"
10716,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",gratitude are almost inseparable. This appears in Virgil and Horace.
10717,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","The former, besides the honour he did him to all posterity, re-toured"
10718,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","his liberalities at his death; the other, whom Mæcenas recommended with"
10719,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","his last breath, was too generous to stay behind, and enjoy the favour"
10720,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","of Augustus; he only desired a place in his tomb, and to mingle his"
10721,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",ashes with those of his deceased benefactor. But this was seventeen
10722,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","hundred years ago.[273] Virgil, thus powerfully supported, thought"
10723,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","it mean to petition for himself alone, but resolutely solicits the"
10724,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","cause of his whole country, and seems, at first, to have met with"
10725,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","some encouragement; but, the matter cooling, he was forced to sit"
10726,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",down contented with the grant of his own estate. He goes therefore to
10727,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Mantua, produces his warrant to a captain of foot, whom he found in"
10728,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","his house. Arius, who had eleven points of the law, and fierce[274]"
10729,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","of the services he had rendered to Octavius, was so far from yielding"
10730,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","possession, that, words growing betwixt them, he wounded him"
10731,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","dangerously, forced him to fly, and at last to swim the river Mincius"
10732,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","to save his life. Virgil, who used to say, that no virtue was so"
10733,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","necessary as patience, was forced to drag a sick body half the length"
10734,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","of Italy, back again to Rome, and by the way, probably, composed his"
10735,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Ninth Pastoral, which may seem to have been made up in haste, out of"
10736,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",the fragments of some other pieces; and naturally enough represents the
10737,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","disorder of the poet's mind, by its disjointed fashion, though there"
10738,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",be another reason to be given elsewhere of its want of connection.
10739,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","He handsomely states his case in that poem, and, with the pardonable"
10740,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","resentments of injured innocence, not only claims Octavius's promise,"
10741,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",but hints to him the uncertainty of human greatness and glory. All was
10742,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",taken in good part by that wise prince; at last effectual orders were
10743,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","given. About this time, he composed that admirable poem, which is set"
10744,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","first, out of respect to Cæsar; for he does not seem either to have"
10745,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","had leisure, or to have been in the humour of making so solemn an"
10746,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","acknowledgment, till he was possessed of the benefit. And now he was in"
10747,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","so great reputation and interest, that he resolved to give up his land"
10748,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","to his parents, and himself to the court. His Pastorals were in such"
10749,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","esteem, that Pollio, now again in high favour with Cæsar, desired him"
10750,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","to reduce them into a volume. Some modern writer, that has a constant"
10751,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","flux of verse, would stand amazed, how Virgil could employ three whole"
10752,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","years in revising five or six hundred verses, most of which, probably,"
10753,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","were made some time before; but there is more reason to wonder, how he"
10754,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",could do it so soon in such perfection. A coarse stone is presently
10755,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","fashioned; but a diamond, of not many carats, is many weeks in sawing,"
10756,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","and, in polishing, many more. He who put Virgil upon this, had a"
10757,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",politic good end in it.
10758,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",
10759,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",The continued civil wars had laid Italy almost waste; the ground
10760,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",was uncultivated and unstocked; upon which ensued such a famine and
10761,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","insurrection, that Cæsar hardly escaped being stoned at Rome; his"
10762,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",ambition being looked upon by all parties as the principal occasion of
10763,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",it. He set himself therefore with great industry to promote country
10764,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","improvements; and Virgil was serviceable to his design, as the good"
10765,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]","Keeper of the Bees, Georg. iv."
10766,"BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.[270]",

10773,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10774,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,which seems to be the motive that induced Mæcenas to put him upon
10775,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"writing his Georgics, or books of husbandry: a design as new in Latin"
10776,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"verse, as pastorals, before Virgil, were in Italy: which work took up"
10777,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"seven of the most vigorous years of his life; for he was now, at least,"
10778,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,thirty-four years of age; and here Virgil shines in his meridian.
10779,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,A great part of this work seems to have been rough-drawn before he
10780,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"left Mantua; for an ancient writer has observed, that the rules of"
10781,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"husbandry, laid down in it, are better calculated for the soil of"
10782,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Mantua, than for the more sunny climate of Naples; near which place,"
10783,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"and in Sicily, he finished it. But, lest his genius should be depressed"
10784,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"by apprehensions of want, he had a good estate settled upon him, and"
10785,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,a house in the pleasantest part of Rome; the principal furniture of
10786,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"which was a well-chosen library, which stood open to all comers of"
10787,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"learning and merit: and what recommended the situation of it most, was"
10788,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the neighbourhood of his Mæcenas; and thus he could either visit Rome,"
10789,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"or return to his privacy at Naples, through a pleasant road, adorned on"
10790,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"each side with pieces of antiquity, of which he was so great a lover,"
10791,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"and, in the intervals of them, seemed almost one continued street of"
10792,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,three days' journey.
10793,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10794,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Cæsar, having now vanquished Sextus Pompeius, (a spring-tide of"
10795,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"prosperities breaking in upon him, before he was ready to receive them"
10796,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"as he ought,) fell sick of the _imperial evil_, the desire of being"
10797,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,thought something more than man. Ambition is an infinite folly; when
10798,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"it has attained to the utmost pitch of human greatness, it soon falls"
10799,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,to making pretensions upon heaven. The crafty Livia would needs be
10800,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,drawn in the habit of a priestess by the shrine of the new god; and
10801,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,this became a fashion not to be dispensed with amongst the ladies.
10802,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,The devotion was wonderous great amongst the Romans; for it was their
10803,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"interest, and, which sometimes avails more, it was the mode. Virgil,"
10804,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"though he despised the heathen superstitions, and is so bold as to"
10805,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"call Saturn and Janus by no better a name than that of _old men_, and"
10806,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"might deserve the title of subverter of superstitions, as well as"
10807,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Varro, thought fit to follow the maxim of Plato his master, that every"
10808,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,one should serve the gods after the usage of his own country; and
10809,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"therefore was not the last to present his incense, which was of too"
10810,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"rich a composition for such an altar; and, by his address to Cæsar on"
10811,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"this occasion, made an unhappy precedent to Lucan and other poets which"
10812,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,came after him.--_Georg. i._ and _iii._ And this poem being now in
10813,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"great forwardness, Cæsar, who, in imitation of his predecessor Julius,"
10814,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"never intermitted his studies in the camp, and much less in other"
10815,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"places, refreshing himself by a short stay in a pleasant village of"
10816,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Campania would needs be entertained with the rehearsal of some part of
10817,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"it. Virgil recited with a marvellous grace, and sweet accent of voice,"
10818,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"but his lungs failing him, Mæcenas himself supplied his place for what"
10819,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,remained. Such a piece of condescension would now be very surprising;
10820,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"but it was no more than customary amongst friends, when learning passed"
10821,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"for quality.[275] Lælius, the second man of Rome in his time, had done"
10822,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"as much for that poet, out of whose dross Virgil would sometimes pick"
10823,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"gold, as himself said, when one found him reading Ennius; (the like"
10824,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"he did by some verses of Varro, and Pacuvius, Lucretius, and Cicero,"
10825,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,which he inserted into his works.) But learned men then lived easy
10826,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,and familiarly with the great: Augustus himself would sometimes sit
10827,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"down betwixt Virgil and Horace, and say jestingly, that he sat betwixt"
10828,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"sighing and tears, alluding to the asthma of one, and rheumatic eyes of"
10829,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the other. He would frequently correspond with them, and never leave"
10830,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,a letter of theirs unanswered; nor were they under the constraint of
10831,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"formal superscriptions in the beginning, nor of violent superlatives"
10832,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"at the close, of their letter: the invention of these is a modern"
10833,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"refinement; in which this may be remarked, in passing, that ""_humble"
10834,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"servant_"" is respect, but ""_friend_"" an affront; which notwithstanding"
10835,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"implies the former, and a great deal more. Nor does true greatness lose"
10836,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"by such familiarity; and those who have it not, as Mæcenas and Pollio"
10837,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"had, are not to be accounted proud, but rather very discreet, in their"
10838,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"reserves. Some playhouse beauties do wisely to be seen at a distance,"
10839,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,and to have the lamps twinkle betwixt them and the spectators.
10840,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10841,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"But now Cæsar, who, though he were none of the greatest soldiers, was"
10842,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"certainly the greatest traveller, of a prince, that had ever been, (for"
10843,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"which Virgil so dexterously compliments him, Æneid, vi.) takes a voyage"
10844,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"to Egypt, and, having happily finished the war, reduces that mighty"
10845,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"kingdom into the form of a province, over which he appointed Gallus"
10846,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,his lieutenant. This is the same person to whom Virgil addresses his
10847,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Tenth Pastoral; changing, in compliance to his request, his purpose"
10848,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,of limiting them to the number of the Muses. The praises of this
10849,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Gallus took up a considerable part of the Fourth Book of the Georgics,"
10850,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,according to the general consent of antiquity: but Cæsar would have it
10851,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,put out; and yet the seam in the poem is still to be discerned; and the
10852,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,matter of Aristæus's recovering his bees might have been dispatched
10853,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"in less compass, without fetching the causes so far, or interesting"
10854,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,so many gods and goddesses in that affair. Perhaps some readers may
10855,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"be inclined to think this, though very much laboured, not the most"
10856,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,entertaining part of that work; so hard it is for the greatest masters
10857,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"to paint against their inclination. But Cæsar was contented, that he"
10858,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"should be mentioned in the last Pastoral, because it might be taken for"
10859,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,a satirical sort of commendation; and the character he there stands
10860,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"under, might help to excuse his cruelty, in putting an old servant to"
10861,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,death for no very great crime.
10862,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10863,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"And now having ended, as he begins his Georgics, with solemn mention"
10864,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of Cæsar, (an argument of his devotion to him,) he begins his _Æneïs_,"
10865,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"according to the common account, being now turned of forty. But that"
10866,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"work had been, in truth, the subject of much earlier meditation."
10867,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Whilst he was working upon the first book of it, this passage, so very"
10868,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"remarkable in history, fell out, in which Virgil had a great share."
10869,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10870,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Cæsar, about this time, either cloyed with glory, or terrified by"
10871,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the example of his predecessor, or to gain the credit of moderation"
10872,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"with the people, or possibly to feel the pulse of his friends,"
10873,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"deliberated whether he should retain the sovereign power, or restore"
10874,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the commonwealth. Agrippa, who was a very honest man, but whose view"
10875,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"was of no great extent, advised him to the latter; but Mæcenas, who had"
10876,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"thoroughly studied his master's temper, in an eloquent oration gave"
10877,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,contrary advice. That emperor was too politic to commit the oversight
10878,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of Cromwell, in a deliberation something resembling this. Cromwell"
10879,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"had never been more desirous of the power, than he was afterwards"
10880,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of the title, of king; and there was nothing in which the heads of"
10881,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the parties, who were all his creatures, would not comply with him;"
10882,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"but, by too vehement allegation of arguments against it, he, who"
10883,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"had outwitted every body besides, at last outwitted himself by too"
10884,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"deep dissimulation; for his council, thinking to make their court"
10885,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"by assenting to his judgment, voted unanimously for him against his"
10886,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"inclination; which surprised and troubled him to such a degree, that,"
10887,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"as soon as he had got into his coach, he fell into a swoon.[276] But"
10888,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Cæsar knew his people better; and, his council being thus divided,"
10889,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,he asked Virgil's advice. Thus a poet had the honour of determining
10890,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the greatest point that ever was in debate, betwixt the son-in-law"
10891,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,and favourite of Cæsar. Virgil delivered his opinion in words to this
10892,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,effect:
10893,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10894,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"""The change of a popular into an absolute government has generally been"
10895,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of very ill consequence; for, betwixt the hatred of the people and"
10896,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"injustice of the prince, it, of necessity, comes to pass, that they"
10897,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"live in distrust, and mutual apprehensions. But, if the commons knew"
10898,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"a just person, whom they entirely confided in, it would be for the"
10899,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"advantage of all parties, that such a one should be their sovereign;"
10900,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"wherefore, if you shall continue to administer justice impartially, as"
10901,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"hitherto you have done, your power will prove safe to yourself, and"
10902,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"beneficial to mankind."" This excellent sentence, which seems taken"
10903,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"out of Plato, (with whose writings the grammarians were not much"
10904,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"acquainted, and therefore cannot reasonably be suspected of forgery in"
10905,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"this matter,) contains the true state of affairs at that time: for the"
10906,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,commonwealth maxims were now no longer practicable; the Romans had
10907,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"only the haughtiness of the old commonwealth left, without one of its"
10908,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"virtues. And this sentence we find, almost in the same words, in the"
10909,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"First Book of the ""Æneïs,"" which at this time he was writing; and one"
10910,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,might wonder that none of his commentators have taken notice of it. He
10911,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"compares a tempest to a popular insurrection, as Cicero had compared a"
10912,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"sedition to a storm, a little before:"
10913,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10914,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"_Ac veluti, magno in populo, cum sæpe coorta est"
10915,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Seditio, sævitque animis ignobile vulgus,"
10916,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Jamque faces, et saxa volant; furor arma ministrat:"
10917,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem
10918,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant:"
10919,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Ille regit dictis animos, et pectora mulcet._"
10920,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10921,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Piety and merit were the two great virtues which Virgil every where
10922,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"attributes to Augustus, and in which that prince, at least politicly,"
10923,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"if not so truly, fixed his character, as appears by the _Marmor Ancyr._"
10924,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"and several of his medals. Franshemius, the learned supplementor of"
10925,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Livy, has inserted this relation into his history; nor is there any"
10926,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"good reason, why Ruæus should account it fabulous. The title of a"
10927,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"poet in those days did not abate, but heighten, the character of the"
10928,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"gravest senator. Virgil was one of the best and wisest men of his time,"
10929,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"and in so popular esteem, that one hundred thousand Romans rose when"
10930,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"he came into the theatre, and paid him the same respect they used to"
10931,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Cæsar himself, as Tacitus assures us. And, if Augustus invited Horace"
10932,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"to assist him in writing his letters, (and every body knows that the"
10933,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"""_Rescripta Imperatorum_"" were the laws of the empire,) Virgil might"
10934,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,well deserve a place in the cabinet-council.
10935,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10936,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"And now he prosecutes his ""Æneïs,"" which had anciently the title of"
10937,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the ""Imperial Poem,"" or ""Roman History,"" and deservedly: for, though"
10938,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,he were too artful a writer to set down events in exact historical
10939,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"order, for which Lucan is justly blamed; yet are all the most"
10940,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,considerable affairs and persons of Rome comprised in this poem. He
10941,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,deduces the history of Italy from before Saturn to the reign of King
10942,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Latinus; and reckons up the successors of Æneas, who reigned at Alba,"
10943,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"for the space of three hundred years, down to the birth of Romulus;"
10944,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"describes the persons and principal exploits of all the kings, to their"
10945,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"expulsion, and the settling of the commonwealth. After this, he touches"
10946,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"promiscuously the most remarkable occurrences at home and abroad, but"
10947,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,insists more particularly upon the exploits of Augustus; insomuch
10948,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"that, though this assertion may appear at first a little surprising,"
10949,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,he has in his works deduced the history of a considerable part of
10950,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the world from its original, through the fabulous and heroic ages,"
10951,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"through the monarchy and commonwealth of Rome, for the space of four"
10952,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"thousand years, down to within less than forty of our Saviour's time,"
10953,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of whom he has preserved a most illustrious prophecy. Besides this,"
10954,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,he points at many remarkable passages of history under feigned names:
10955,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the destruction of Alba and Veii, under that of Troy; the star Venus,"
10956,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"which, Varro says, guided Æneas in his voyage to Italy, in that verse,"
10957,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10958,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,_Matre deâ monstrante viam._
10959,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10960,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Romulus's lance taking root, and budding, is described in that passage"
10961,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"concerning Polydorus, Æneïd, iii."
10962,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10963,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,----_Confixum ferrea texit
10964,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Telorum seges, et jaculis increvit acutis_--"
10965,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10966,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"The stratagem of the Trojans boring holes in their ships, and sinking"
10967,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"them, lest the Latins should burn them, under that fable of their"
10968,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,being transformed into sea-nymphs; and therefore the ancients had no
10969,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,such reason to condemn that fable as groundless and absurd. Cocles
10970,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"swimming the river Tyber, after the bridge was broken down behind him,"
10971,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"is exactly painted in the four last verses of the ninth book, under the"
10972,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"character of Turnus: Marius hiding himself in the morass of Minturnæ,"
10973,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,under the person of Sinon:
10974,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10975,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,_Limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulvâ
10976,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Delitui_.[277]
10977,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10978,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Those verses in the second book concerning Priam,"
10979,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10980,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"----_jacet ingens littore truncus, &c._"
10981,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10982,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,seem originally made upon Pompey the Great. He seems to touch the
10983,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"imperious and intriguing humour of the Empress Livia, under the"
10984,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,character of Juno. The irresolute and weak Lepidus is well represented
10985,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,under the person of King Latinus; Augustus with the character of _Pont.
10986,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Max._ under that of Æneas; and the rash courage (always unfortunate
10987,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"in Virgil) of Marc Antony, in Turnus; the railing eloquence of Cicero"
10988,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"in his ""Philippics"" is well imitated in the oration of Drances; the"
10989,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"dull faithful Agrippa, under the person of Achates; accordingly this"
10990,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"character is flat: Achates kills but one man, and himself receives one"
10991,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"slight wound, but neither says nor does any thing very considerable"
10992,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"in the whole poem. Curio, who sold his country for about two hundred"
10993,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"thousand pounds, is stigmatized in that verse,--"
10994,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10995,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"_Vendidit hic auro patriam, dominumque potentem"
10996,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Imposuit._
10997,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
10998,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Livy relates, that, presently after the death of the two Scipios in"
10999,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Spain, when Martius took upon him the command, a blazing meteor shone"
11000,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"around his head, to the astonishment of his soldiers. Virgil transfers"
11001,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,this to Æneas:
11002,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11003,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,_Lætasque vomunt duo tempora flammas._
11004,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11005,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"It is strange, that the commentators have not taken notice of this."
11006,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,Thus the ill omen which happened a little before the battle of
11007,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Thrasymen, when some of the centurions' lances took fire miraculously,"
11008,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"is hinted in the like accident which befel Acestes, before the burning"
11009,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,of the Trojan fleet in Sicily. The reader will easily find many
11010,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"more such instances. In other writers, there is often well-covered"
11011,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"ignorance; in Virgil, concealed learning."
11012,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11013,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,His silence of some illustrious persons is no less worth observation.
11014,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"He says nothing of Scævola, because he attempted to assassinate a king,"
11015,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,though a declared enemy; nor of the younger Brutus; for he effected
11016,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"what the other endeavoured; nor of the younger Cato, because he was"
11017,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,an implacable enemy of Julius Cæsar; nor could the mention of him be
11018,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"pleasing to Augustus; and that passage,"
11019,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11020,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,_His dantem jura Catonem_----
11021,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11022,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"may relate to his office, as he was a very severe censor. Nor would he"
11023,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"name Cicero, when the occasion of mentioning him came full in his way,"
11024,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,when he speaks of Catiline; because he afterwards approved the murder
11025,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"of Cæsar, though the plotters were too wary to trust the orator with"
11026,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,their design. Some other poets knew the art of speaking well; but
11027,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Virgil, beyond this, knew the admirable secret, of being eloquently"
11028,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"silent. Whatsoever was most curious in Fabius Pictor, Cato the elder,"
11029,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Varro, in the Egyptian antiquities, in the form of sacrifice, in the"
11030,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"solemnities of making peace and war, is preserved in this poem. Rome is"
11031,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"still above ground, and flourishing in Virgil. And all this he performs"
11032,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"with admirable brevity. The ""Æneïs"" was once near twenty times bigger"
11033,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"than he left it; so that he spent as much time in blotting out, as some"
11034,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,moderns have done in writing whole volumes. But not one book has his
11035,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"finishing strokes. The sixth seems one of the most perfect, the which,"
11036,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"after long entreaty, and sometimes threats, of Augustus, he was at last"
11037,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,prevailed upon to recite. This fell out about four years before his
11038,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"own death: that of Marcellus, whom Cæsar designed for his successor,"
11039,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"happened a little before this recital: Virgil therefore, with his usual"
11040,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"dexterity, inserted his funeral panegyric in those admirable lines,"
11041,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"beginning,"
11042,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11043,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"_O nate, ingentem luctum ne quære tuorum, &c._"
11044,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11045,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"His mother, the excellent Octavia, the best wife of the worst husband"
11046,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"that ever was, to divert her grief, would be of the auditory. The poet"
11047,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"artificially deferred the naming Marcellus, till their passions were"
11048,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,raised to the highest; but the mention of it put both her and Augustus
11049,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"into such a passion of weeping, that they commanded him to proceed"
11050,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"no further. Virgil answered, that he had already ended that passage."
11051,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Some relate, that Octavia fainted away; but afterwards she presented"
11052,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"the poet with two thousand one hundred pounds, odd money: a round"
11053,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,sum for twenty-seven verses; but they were Virgil's. Another writer
11054,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"says, that, with a royal magnificence, she ordered him massy plate,"
11055,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"unweighed, to a great value."
11056,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11057,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"And now he took up a resolution of travelling into Greece, there to set"
11058,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,the last hand to this work; proposing to devote the rest of his life
11059,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"to philosophy, which had been always his principal passion. He justly"
11060,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"thought it a foolish figure for a grave man to be overtaken by death,"
11061,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"whilst he was weighing the cadence of words, and measuring verses,"
11062,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"unless necessity should constrain it, from which he was well secured"
11063,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"by the liberality of that learned age. But he was not aware, that,"
11064,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"whilst he allotted three years for the revising of his poem, he drew"
11065,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"bills upon a failing bank: for, unhappily meeting Augustus at Athens,"
11066,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"he thought himself obliged to wait upon him into Italy; but, being"
11067,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"desirous to see all he could of the Greek antiquities, he fell into"
11068,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"a languishing distemper at Megara. This, neglected at first, proved"
11069,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"mortal. The agitation of the vessel (for it was now autumn, near the"
11070,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"time of his birth,) brought him so low, that he could hardly reach"
11071,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Brindisi. In his sickness, he frequently, and with great importunity,"
11072,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"called for his scrutoir, that he might burn his ""Æneïs:"" but, Augustus"
11073,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"interposing by his royal authority, he made his last will, (of which"
11074,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"something shall be said afterwards;) and, considering probably how much"
11075,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Homer had been disfigured by the arbitrary compilers of his works,"
11076,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"obliged Tucca and Varius to add nothing, nor so much as fill up the"
11077,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,breaks he left in his poem. He ordered that his bones should be carried
11078,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"to Naples, in which place he had passed the most agreeable part of his"
11079,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"life. Augustus, not only as executor and friend, but according to the"
11080,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"duty of the _Pontifex Maximus_, when a funeral happened in his family,"
11081,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,took care himself to see the will punctually executed. He went out
11082,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,of the world with all that calmness of mind with which the ancient
11083,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,writer of his life says he came into it; making the inscription of his
11084,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,monument himself; for he began and ended his poetical compositions
11085,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"with an epitaph. And this he made, exactly according to the law of his"
11086,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"master Plato on such occasions, without the least ostentation:"
11087,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,
11088,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"I sung flocks, tillage, heroes; Mantua gave"
11089,REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS--,"Me life, Brundusium death, Naples a grave."

11461,"MY LORD,","MY LORD,"
11462,"MY LORD,",
11463,"MY LORD,","I have found it not more difficult to translate Virgil, than to find"
11464,"MY LORD,","such patrons as I desire for my translation. For, though England is not"
11465,"MY LORD,","wanting in a learned nobility, yet such are my unhappy circumstances,"
11466,"MY LORD,",that they have confined me to a narrow choice.[283] To the greater
11467,"MY LORD,",part I have not the honour to be known; and to some of them I cannot
11468,"MY LORD,","show at present, by any public act, that grateful respect which I"
11469,"MY LORD,",shall ever bear them in my heart. Yet I have no reason to complain of
11470,"MY LORD,","fortune, since, in the midst of that abundance, I could not possibly"
11471,"MY LORD,","have chosen better, than the worthy son of so illustrious a father."
11472,"MY LORD,","He was the patron of my manhood, when I flourished in the opinion"
11473,"MY LORD,","of the world; though with small advantage to my fortune, till he"
11474,"MY LORD,","awakened the remembrance of my royal master. He was that Pollio, or"
11475,"MY LORD,","that Varus,[284] who introduced me to Augustus: and, though he soon"
11476,"MY LORD,","dismissed himself from state affairs, yet, in the short time of his"
11477,"MY LORD,","administration, he shone so powerfully upon me, that, like the heat of"
11478,"MY LORD,","a Russian summer, he ripened the fruits of poetry in a cold climate,"
11479,"MY LORD,","and gave me wherewithal to subsist, at least, in the long winter which"
11480,"MY LORD,","succeeded. What I now offer to your lordship, is the wretched remainder"
11481,"MY LORD,","of a sickly age, worn out with study, and oppressed by fortune; without"
11482,"MY LORD,","other support than the constancy and patience of a Christian. You, my"
11483,"MY LORD,","lord, are yet in the flower of your youth, and may live to enjoy the"
11484,"MY LORD,",benefits of the peace which is promised Europe: I can only hear of that
11485,"MY LORD,","blessing; for years, and, above all things, want of health, have shut"
11486,"MY LORD,","me out from sharing in the happiness. The poets, who condemn their"
11487,"MY LORD,","Tantalus to hell, had added to his torments, if they had placed him in"
11488,"MY LORD,","Elysium, which is the proper emblem of my condition. The fruit and the"
11489,"MY LORD,","water may reach my lips, but cannot enter; and, if they could, yet I"
11490,"MY LORD,",want a palate as well as a digestion. But it is some kind of pleasure
11491,"MY LORD,","to me, to please those whom I respect; and I am not altogether out"
11492,"MY LORD,","of hope, that these Pastorals of Virgil may give your lordship some"
11493,"MY LORD,","delight, though made English by one who scarce remembers that passion"
11494,"MY LORD,",which inspired my author when he wrote them. These were his first essay
11495,"MY LORD,","in poetry, if the ""Ceiris""[285] was not his: and it was more excusable"
11496,"MY LORD,","in him to describe love when he was young, than for me to translate"
11497,"MY LORD,",him when I am old. He died at the age of fifty-two; and I began this
11498,"MY LORD,","work in my great climacteric. But, having perhaps a better constitution"
11499,"MY LORD,","than my author, I have wronged him less, considering my circumstances,"
11500,"MY LORD,","than those who have attempted him before, either in our own, or any"
11501,"MY LORD,","modern language. And, though this version is not void of errors, yet"
11502,"MY LORD,","it comforts me, that the faults of others are not worth finding. Mine"
11503,"MY LORD,","are neither gross nor frequent in those Eclogues, wherein my master"
11504,"MY LORD,","has raised himself above that humble style in which pastoral delights,"
11505,"MY LORD,","and which, I must confess, is proper to the education and converse"
11506,"MY LORD,","of shepherds: for he found the strength of his genius betimes, and"
11507,"MY LORD,","was, even in his youth, preluding to his ""Georgics"" and his ""Æneïs."""
11508,"MY LORD,","He could not forbear to try his wings, though his pinions were not"
11509,"MY LORD,",hardened to maintain a long laborious flight; yet sometimes they bore
11510,"MY LORD,",him to a pitch as lofty as ever he was able to reach afterwards.
11511,"MY LORD,","But, when he was admonished by his subject to descend, he came down"
11512,"MY LORD,","gently, circling in the air, and singing, to the ground; like a lark,"
11513,"MY LORD,","melodious in her mounting, and continuing her song till she alights,"
11514,"MY LORD,","still preparing for a higher flight at her next sally, and tuning her"
11515,"MY LORD,","voice to better music. The fourth, the sixth, and the eighth Pastorals,"
11516,"MY LORD,","are clear evidences of this truth. In the three first, he contains"
11517,"MY LORD,","himself within his bounds: but, addressing to Pollio, his great patron,"
11518,"MY LORD,","and himself no vulgar poet, he no longer could restrain the freedom"
11519,"MY LORD,","of his spirit, but began to assert his native character, which is"
11520,"MY LORD,","sublimity--putting himself under the conduct of the same Cumæan Sibyl,"
11521,"MY LORD,","whom afterwards he gave for a guide to his Æneas. It is true, he was"
11522,"MY LORD,","sensible of his own boldness; and we know it by the _paulo majora_,"
11523,"MY LORD,","which begins his fourth Eclogue. He remembered, like young Manlius,"
11524,"MY LORD,",that he was forbidden to engage; but what avails an express command
11525,"MY LORD,","to a youthful courage, which presages victory in the attempt?[286]"
11526,"MY LORD,","Encouraged with success, he proceeds farther in the sixth, and invades"
11527,"MY LORD,","the province of philosophy. And, notwithstanding that Phoebus had"
11528,"MY LORD,","forewarned him of singing wars, as he there confesses, yet he presumed,"
11529,"MY LORD,","that the search of nature was as free to him as to Lucretius, who, at"
11530,"MY LORD,","his age, explained it according to the principles of Epicurus. In his"
11531,"MY LORD,","eighth Eclogue, he has innovated nothing; the former part of it being"
11532,"MY LORD,","the complaint and despair of a forsaken lover; the latter, a charm of"
11533,"MY LORD,","an enchantress, to renew a lost affection. But the complaint perhaps"
11534,"MY LORD,",contains some topics which are above the condition of his persons; and
11535,"MY LORD,",our author seems to have made his herdsmen somewhat too learned for
11536,"MY LORD,",their profession: the charms are also of the same nature; but both were
11537,"MY LORD,","copied from Theocritus, and had received the applause of former ages in"
11538,"MY LORD,",their original.
11539,"MY LORD,",
11540,"MY LORD,",There is a kind of rusticity in all those pompous verses; somewhat of
11541,"MY LORD,",a holiday shepherd strutting in his country buskins. The like may be
11542,"MY LORD,","observed both in the ""Pollio"" and the ""Silenus,"" where the similitudes"
11543,"MY LORD,",are drawn from the woods and meadows. They seem to me to represent our
11544,"MY LORD,","poet betwixt a farmer and a courtier, when he left Mantua for Rome, and"
11545,"MY LORD,","drest himself in his best habit to appear before his patron, somewhat"
11546,"MY LORD,","too fine for the place from whence he came, and yet retaining part"
11547,"MY LORD,","of its simplicity. In the ninth Pastoral, he collects some beautiful"
11548,"MY LORD,","passages, which were scattered in Theocritus, which he could not insert"
11549,"MY LORD,","into any of his former Eclogues, and yet was unwilling they should"
11550,"MY LORD,","be lost. In all the rest, he is equal to his Sicilian master, and"
11551,"MY LORD,","observes, like him, a just decorum both of the subject and the persons;"
11552,"MY LORD,","as particularly in the third Pastoral, where one of his shepherds"
11553,"MY LORD,","describes a bowl, or mazer, curiously carved:"
11554,"MY LORD,",
11555,"MY LORD,","_In medio duo signa: Conon, et quis fuit alter,"
11556,"MY LORD,","Descripsit radio, totum qui gentibus orbem?_"
11557,"MY LORD,",
11558,"MY LORD,","He remembers only the name of Conon, and forgets the other on set"
11559,"MY LORD,","purpose. Whether he means Anaximander, or Eudoxus, I dispute not; but"
11560,"MY LORD,","he was certainly forgotten, to show his country swain was no great"
11561,"MY LORD,",scholar.
11562,"MY LORD,",
11563,"MY LORD,","After all, I must confess, that the boorish dialect of Theocritus has"
11564,"MY LORD,","a secret charm in it, which the Roman language cannot imitate, though"
11565,"MY LORD,",Virgil has drawn it down as low as possibly he could; as in the _cujum
11566,"MY LORD,","pecus_, and some other words, for which he was so unjustly blamed by"
11567,"MY LORD,","the bad critics of his age, who could not see the beauties of that"
11568,"MY LORD,","_merum rus_, which the poet described in those expressions. But"
11569,"MY LORD,","Theocritus may justly be preferred as the original, without injury"
11570,"MY LORD,","to Virgil, who modestly contents himself with the second place, and"
11571,"MY LORD,",glories only in being the first who transplanted pastoral into his own
11572,"MY LORD,","country, and brought it there to bear as happily as the cherry-trees"
11573,"MY LORD,",which Lucullus brought from Pontus.
11574,"MY LORD,",
11575,"MY LORD,","Our own nation has produced a third poet in this kind, not inferior to"
11576,"MY LORD,","the two former: for the ""Shepherd's Kalendar"" of Spenser is not to be"
11577,"MY LORD,","matched in any modern language, not even by Tasso's ""Aminta,"" which"
11578,"MY LORD,","infinitely transcends Guarini's ""Pastor Fido,"" as having more of nature"
11579,"MY LORD,","in it, and being almost wholly clear from the wretched affectation of"
11580,"MY LORD,","learning. I will say nothing of the ""Piscatory Eclogues,"" because no"
11581,"MY LORD,","modern Latin can bear criticism.[287] It is no wonder, that, rolling"
11582,"MY LORD,","down, through so many barbarous ages, from the spring of Virgil, it"
11583,"MY LORD,",bears along with it the filth and ordures of the Goths and Vandals.
11584,"MY LORD,","Neither will I mention Monsieur Fontenelle, the living glory of the"
11585,"MY LORD,","French. It is enough for him to have excelled his master Lucian,"
11586,"MY LORD,","without attempting to compare our miserable age with that of Virgil, or"
11587,"MY LORD,","Theocritus. Let me only add, for his reputation,"
11588,"MY LORD,",
11589,"MY LORD,",----_Si Pergama dextrâ
11590,"MY LORD,","Defendi possint, etiam hâc defensa fuissent._"
11591,"MY LORD,",
11592,"MY LORD,","But Spenser, being master of our northern dialect, and skilled in"
11593,"MY LORD,","Chaucer's English, has so exactly imitated the Doric of Theocritus,"
11594,"MY LORD,",that his love is a perfect image of that passion which God infused into
11595,"MY LORD,","both sexes, before it was corrupted with the knowledge of arts, and the"
11596,"MY LORD,",ceremonies of what we call good manners.
11597,"MY LORD,",
11598,"MY LORD,","My lord, I know to whom I dedicate; and could not have been induced, by"
11599,"MY LORD,","any motive, to put this part of Virgil, or any other, into unlearned"
11600,"MY LORD,","hands. You have read him with pleasure, and, I dare say, with"
11601,"MY LORD,","admiration, in the Latin, of which you are a master. You have added"
11602,"MY LORD,","to your natural endowments, which, without flattery, are eminent, the"
11603,"MY LORD,","superstructures of study, and the knowledge of good authors. Courage,"
11604,"MY LORD,","probity, and humanity, are inherent in you. These virtues have ever"
11605,"MY LORD,","been habitual to the ancient house of Cumberland, from whence you are"
11606,"MY LORD,","descended, and of which our chronicles make so honourable mention"
11607,"MY LORD,",in the long wars betwixt the rival families of York and Lancaster.
11608,"MY LORD,","Your forefathers have asserted the party which they chose till death,"
11609,"MY LORD,","and died for its defence in the fields of battle. You have, besides,"
11610,"MY LORD,","the fresh remembrance of your noble father, from whom you never can"
11611,"MY LORD,",degenerate:
11612,"MY LORD,",
11613,"MY LORD,",----_Nec imbellem feroces
11614,"MY LORD,",Progenerant aquilæ columbam._
11615,"MY LORD,",
11616,"MY LORD,",It being almost morally impossible for you to be other than you
11617,"MY LORD,","are by kind, I need neither praise nor incite your virtue. You are"
11618,"MY LORD,","acquainted with the Roman history, and know, without my information,"
11619,"MY LORD,",that patronage and clientship always descended from the fathers to
11620,"MY LORD,","the sons, and that the same plebeian houses had recourse to the same"
11621,"MY LORD,","patrician line which had formerly protected them, and followed their"
11622,"MY LORD,",principles and fortunes to the last. So that I am your lordship's by
11623,"MY LORD,","descent, and part of your inheritance. And the natural inclination"
11624,"MY LORD,","which I have to serve you, adds to your paternal right; for I was"
11625,"MY LORD,",wholly yours from the first moment when I had the happiness and honour
11626,"MY LORD,",of being known to you. Be pleased therefore to accept the rudiments
11627,"MY LORD,","of Virgil's poetry, coarsely translated, I confess, but which yet"
11628,"MY LORD,","retain some beauties of the author, which neither the barbarity of our"
11629,"MY LORD,","language, nor my unskilfulness, could so much sully, but that they"
11630,"MY LORD,",appear sometimes in the dim mirror which I hold before you. The subject
11631,"MY LORD,","is not unsuitable to your youth, which allows you yet to love, and is"
11632,"MY LORD,","proper to your present scene of life. Rural recreations abroad, and"
11633,"MY LORD,","books at home, are the innocent pleasures of a man who is early wise,"
11634,"MY LORD,","and gives Fortune no more hold of him, than of necessity he must. It"
11635,"MY LORD,","is good, on some occasions, to think before-hand as little as we can;"
11636,"MY LORD,",to enjoy as much of the present as will not endanger our futurity; and
11637,"MY LORD,","to provide ourselves of the virtuoso's saddle, which will be sure to"
11638,"MY LORD,","amble, when the world is upon the hardest trot. What I humbly offer to"
11639,"MY LORD,","your lordship, is of this nature. I wish it pleasant, and am sure it is"
11640,"MY LORD,","innocent. May you ever continue your esteem for Virgil, and not lessen"
11641,"MY LORD,","it for the faults of his translator; who is, with all manner of respect"
11642,"MY LORD,","and sense of gratitude,"
11643,"MY LORD,",

11703,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","As the writings of greatest antiquity are in verse, so, of all sorts"

11705,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","model of the first innocence and simplicity, which the moderns, better"
11706,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to dispense themselves from imitating, have wisely thought fit to"
11707,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","treat as fabulous, and impracticable. And yet they, by obeying the"
11708,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","unsophisticated dictates of nature, enjoyed the most valuable blessings"
11709,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of life; a vigorous health of body, with a constant serenity and"
11710,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","freedom of mind; whilst we, with all our fanciful refinements, can"
11711,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","scarcely pass an autumn without some access of a fever, or a whole"

11713,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","as a very old man, who reached to a greater number of years, than in"
11714,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",these times an ancient family can reasonably pretend to; and we know
11715,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the names of several, who saw and practised the world for a longer"
11716,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","space of time, than we can read the account of in any one entire body"
11717,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of history. In short, they invented the most useful arts, pasturage,"
11718,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","tillage, geometry, writing, music, astronomy, &c. whilst the moderns,"
11719,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","like extravagant heirs made rich by their industry, ungratefully deride"
11720,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",the good old gentleman who left them the estate. It is not therefore to
11721,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","be wondered at, that pastorals are fallen into disesteem, together with"
11722,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","that fashion of life, upon which they were grounded. And methinks I see"
11723,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the reader already uneasy at this part of Virgil, counting the pages,"
11724,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and posting to the ""Æneïs:"" so delightful an entertainment is the very"
11725,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",relation of public mischief and slaughter now become to mankind. And
11726,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",yet Virgil passed a much different judgment on his own works: he valued
11727,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","most this part, and his ""Georgics,"" and depended upon them for his"
11728,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",reputation with posterity; but censures himself in one of his letters
11729,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to Augustus, for meddling with heroics, the invention of a degenerating"
11730,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","age. This is the reason that the rules of pastoral are so little known,"
11731,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","or studied. Aristotle, Horace, and the Essay of Poetry, take no notice"
11732,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of it; and Monsieur Boileau, one of the most accurate of the moderns,"
11733,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","because he never loses the ancients out of his sight, bestows scarce"
11734,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",half a page on it.
11735,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11736,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","It is the design therefore of the few following pages, to clear this"
11737,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",sort of writing from vulgar prejudices; to vindicate our author from
11738,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",some unjust imputations; to look into some of the rules of this sort
11739,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of poetry, and enquire what sort of versification is most proper for"
11740,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","it; in which point we are so much inferior to the ancients, that this"
11741,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",consideration alone were enough to make some writers think as they
11742,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","ought, that is meanly, of their own performances."

11744,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","As all sorts of poetry consist in imitation, pastoral is the _imitation"
11745,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of a Shepherd, considered under that character_. It is requisite"
11746,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",therefore to be a little informed of the condition and qualification of
11747,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",these shepherds.

11757,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",in more esteem than the refinements of pleasure; and it was accounted
11758,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","a great deal more honourable to till the ground, or keep a flock of"

11769,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","lives as freely for their diversion, as they had done before for their"
11770,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",necessary subsistence. The English gave this usage the sacred stamp of
11771,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",fashion; and from hence it is that most of our terms of hunting are
11772,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","French.[290] The reader will, I hope, give me his pardon for my freedom"
11773,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","on this subject, since an ill accident, occasioned by hunting, has"
11774,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","kept England in pain, these several months together, for one of the"
11775,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",best and greatest peers[291] which she has bred for some ages; no less
11776,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","illustrious for civil virtues and learning, than his ancestors were for"
11777,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",all their victories in France.
11778,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11779,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",But there are some prints still left of the ancient esteem for
11780,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","husbandry, and their plain fashion of life, in many of our surnames,"
11781,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and in the escutcheons of the most ancient families, even those of the"
11782,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","greatest kings, the roses, the lilies, the thistle, &c. It is generally"
11783,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","known, that one of the principal causes of the deposing of Mahomet the"
11784,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Fourth, was, that he would not allot part of the day to some manual"
11785,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","labour, according to the law of Mahomet, and ancient practice of his"
11786,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","predecessors. He that reflects on this, will be the less surprised to"
11787,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","find that Charlemagne, eight hundred years ago, ordered his children to"
11788,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","be instructed in some profession; and, eight hundred years yet higher,"
11789,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",that Augustus wore no clothes but such as were made by the hands of the
11790,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",empress and her daughters; and Olympias did the same for Alexander the
11791,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Great. Nor will he wonder, that the Romans, in great exigency, sent"
11792,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","for their dictator from the plough, whose whole estate was but of four"
11793,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","acres; too little a spot now for the orchard, or kitchen-garden, of a"
11794,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","private gentleman. It is commonly known, that the founders of three the"
11795,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",most renowned monarchies in the world were shepherds; and the subject
11796,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",of husbandry has been adorned by the writings and labour of more than
11797,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",twenty kings. It ought not therefore to be matter of surprise to a
11798,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","modern writer, that kings, the shepherds of the people in Homer, laid"
11799,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",down their first rudiments in tending their mute subjects; nor that
11800,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the wealth of Ulysses consisted in flocks and herds, the intendants"
11801,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",over which were then in equal esteem with officers of state in latter
11802,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",times. And therefore Eumæus is called #dios hyphorbos# in Homer; not so
11803,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","much because Homer was a lover of a country life, to which he rather"
11804,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","seems averse, but by reason of the dignity and greatness of his trust,"
11805,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and because he was the son of a king, stolen away, and sold by the"
11806,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Phoenician pirates; which the ingenious Mr Cowley seems not to have
11807,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","taken notice of. Nor will it seem strange, that the master of the horse"
11808,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to king Latinus, in the ninth Æneïd, was found in the homely employment"
11809,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of cleaving blocks, when news of the first skirmish betwixt the"
11810,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Trojans and Latins was brought to him.
11811,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11812,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Being therefore of such quality, they cannot be supposed so very"
11813,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",ignorant and unpolished: the learning and good-breeding of the world
11814,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",was then in the hands of such people. He who was chosen by the consent
11815,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of all parties to arbitrate so delicate an affair as, which was the"
11816,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",fairest of the three celebrated beauties of heaven--he who had the
11817,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","address to debauch away Helen from her husband, her native country,"
11818,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",and from a crown--understood what the French call by the too soft name
11819,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of _galanterie_; he had accomplishments enough, how ill use soever he"
11820,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","made of them. It seems, therefore, that M. Fontenelle had not duly"
11821,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","considered the matter, when he reflected so severely upon Virgil, as"
11822,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","if he had not observed the laws of decency in his Pastorals, in making"
11823,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","shepherds speak to things beside their character, and above their"
11824,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","capacity. He stands amazed, that shepherds should thunder out, as he"
11825,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","expresses himself, the formation of the world, and that too according"
11826,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to the system of Epicurus. ""In truth,"" says he, page 176, ""I cannot"
11827,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","tell what to make of this whole piece, (the sixth Pastoral.) I can"
11828,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","neither comprehend the design of the author, nor the connection of"
11829,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the parts. First come the ideas of philosophy, and presently after"
11830,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","those incoherent fables, &c."" To expose him yet more, he subjoins,"
11831,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","""It is Silenus himself who makes all this absurd discourse. Virgil"
11832,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","says indeed, that he had drank too much the day before; perhaps the"
11833,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","debauch hung in his head when he composed this poem,"" &c. Thus far M."
11834,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Fontenelle, who, to the disgrace of reason, as himself ingenuously"
11835,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","owns, first built his house, and then studied architecture; I mean,"
11836,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","first composed his Eclogues, and then studied the rules. In answer to"
11837,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","this, we may observe, first, that this very pastoral which he singles"
11838,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","out to triumph over, was recited by a famous player on the Roman"
11839,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","theatre, with marvellous applause; insomuch that Cicero, who had heard"
11840,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","part of it only, ordered the whole to be rehearsed, and, struck with"
11841,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","admiration of it, conferred then upon Virgil the glorious title of"
11842,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11843,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",_Magnæ spes altera Romæ._
11844,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11845,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Nor is it old Donatus only who relates this; we have the same
11846,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",account from another very credible and ancient author; so that here
11847,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","we have the judgment of Cicero, and the people of Rome, to confront"
11848,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",the single opinion of this adventurous critic. A man ought to be
11849,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","well assured of his own abilities, before he attacks an author of"
11850,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",established reputation. If Mr Fontenelle had perused the fragments of
11851,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the Phoenician antiquity, traced the progress of learning through the"
11852,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","ancient Greek writers, or so much as consulted his learned countryman"
11853,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Huetius, he would have found, (which falls out unluckily for him,)"
11854,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",that a Chaldæan shepherd discovered to the Egyptians and Greeks the
11855,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","creation of the world. And what subject more fit for such a pastoral,"
11856,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",than that great affair which was first notified to the world by one
11857,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of that profession? Nor does it appear, (what he takes for granted,)"
11858,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",that Virgil describes the original of the world according to the
11859,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",hypothesis of Epicurus. He was too well seen in antiquity to commit
11860,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",such a gross mistake; there is not the least mention of _chance_ in
11861,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","that whole passage, nor of the _clinamen principiorum_, so peculiar to"
11862,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Epicurus's hypothesis. Virgil had not only more piety, but was of too"
11863,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",nice a judgment to introduce a god denying the power and providence of
11864,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the Deity, and singing a hymn to the atoms and blind chance. On the"
11865,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","contrary, his description agrees very well with that of Moses; and"
11866,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the eloquent commentator Dacier, who is so confident that Horace had"
11867,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","perused the sacred history, might with greater reason have affirmed the"
11868,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","same thing of Virgil; for, besides that famous passage in the sixth"
11869,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Æneïd, (by which this may be illustrated,) where the word _principio_"
11870,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","is used in the front of both by Moses and Virgil, and the seas are"
11871,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","first mentioned, and the _spiritus intus alit_, which might not"
11872,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","improbably, as M. Dacier would suggest, allude to the ""_Spirit moving"
11873,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","upon the face of the waters_;"" but, omitting this parallel place, the"
11874,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","successive formation of the world is evidently described in these words,"
11875,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11876,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",_Rerum paulatim sumere formas_:
11877,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11878,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","And it is hardly possible to render more literally that verse of Moses,"
11879,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","""_Let the waters be gathered into one place, and let the dry land"
11880,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","appear_,"" than in this of Virgil,"
11881,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11882,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Jam durare solum, et discludere Nerea ponto._"
11883,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11884,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","After this, the formation of the sun is described, (exactly in the"
11885,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Mosaical order,) and, next, the production of the first living"
11886,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","creatures, and that too in a small number, (still in the same method,)"
11887,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11888,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",_Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes._
11889,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11890,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","And here the foresaid author would probably remark, that Virgil keeps"
11891,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","more exactly to the Mosaic system, than an ingenious writer, who will"
11892,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",by no means allow mountains to be coeval with the world. Thus much
11893,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","will make it probable at least, that Virgil had Moses in his thoughts"
11894,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","rather than Epicurus, when he composed this poem. But it is further"
11895,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","remarkable, that this passage was taken from a song attributed to"
11896,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Apollo, who himself, too, unluckily had been a shepherd; and he took"
11897,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","it from another yet more ancient, composed by the first inventor of"
11898,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","music, and at that time a shepherd too; and this is one of the noblest"
11899,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","fragments of Greek antiquity. And, because I cannot suppose the"
11900,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","ingenious M. Fontenelle one of their number, who pretend to censure"
11901,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the Greeks, without being able to distinguish Greek from Ephesian"
11902,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","characters, I shall here set down the lines from which Virgil took this"
11903,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","passage, though none of the commentators have observed it:"
11904,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11905,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","#----eratê d' hoi hespeto phônê,"
11906,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Krainôn athanatous te theous, kai gaian eremnên,"
11907,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Hôs ta prôta genonto, kai hôs lache moiran hekastos#, &c."
11908,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11909,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Thus Linus too began his poem, as appears by a fragment of it preserved"
11910,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",by Diogenes Laertius; and the like may be instanced in Musæus himself;
11911,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","so that our poet here, with great judgment, as always, follows the"
11912,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","ancient custom of beginning their more solemn songs with the creation,"
11913,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",and does it too most properly under the person of a shepherd. And thus
11914,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the first and best employment of poetry was, to compose hymns in honour"
11915,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",of the great Creator of the universe.
11916,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11917,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Few words will suffice to answer his other objections. He demands why
11918,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",those several transformations are mentioned in that poem:--And is not
11919,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",fable then the life and soul of poetry? Can himself assign a more
11920,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","proper subject of pastoral than the _Saturnia regna_, the age and scene"
11921,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of this kind of poetry? What theme more fit for the song of a god, or"
11922,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to imprint religious awe, than the omnipotent power of transforming"
11923,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",the species of creatures at their pleasure? Their families lived in
11924,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","groves, near the clear springs; and what better warning could be given"
11925,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to the hopeful young shepherds, than that they should not gaze too much"
11926,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","into the liquid dangerous looking-glass, for fear of being stolen by"
11927,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the water-nymphs, that is, falling and being drowned, as Hylas was?"
11928,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Pasiphaë's monstrous passion for a bull is certainly a subject enough
11929,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",fitted for bucolics. Can M. Fontenelle tax Silenus for fetching too far
11930,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the transformation of the sisters of Phaëton into trees, when perhaps"
11931,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",they sat at that very time under the hospitable shade of those alders
11932,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",and poplars--or the metamorphosis of Philomela into that ravishing
11933,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","bird, which makes the sweetest music of the groves? If he had looked"
11934,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","into the ancient Greek writers, or so much as consulted honest Servius,"
11935,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","he would have discovered, that, under the allegory of this drunkenness"
11936,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of Silenus, the refinement and exaltation of men's minds by philosophy"
11937,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","was intended. But, if the author of these reflections can take such"
11938,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","flights in his wine, it is almost pity that drunkenness should be a"
11939,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","sin, or that he should ever want good store of burgundy and champaign."
11940,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","But indeed he seems not to have ever drank out of Silenus's tankard,"
11941,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",when he composed either his Critique or Pastorals.
11942,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11943,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",His censure on the fourth seems worse grounded than the other. It is
11944,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","entitled, in some ancient manuscripts, the ""History of the Renovation"
11945,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of the World."" He complains, that he ""cannot understand what is meant"
11946,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","by those many figurative expressions:"" but, if he had consulted the"
11947,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","younger Vossius's dissertation on this Pastoral, or read the excellent"
11948,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","oration of the emperor Constantine, made French by a good pen of their"
11949,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","own, he would have found there the plain interpretation of all those"
11950,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","figurative expressions; and, withal, very strong proofs of the truth"
11951,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of the Christian religion; such as converted heathens, as Valerianus,"
11952,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and others. And, upon account of this piece, the most learned of all"
11953,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the Latin fathers calls Virgil a Christian, even before Christianity."
11954,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Cicero takes notice of it in his books of Divination; and Virgil
11955,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",probably had put it in verse a considerable time before the edition of
11956,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","his Pastorals. Nor does he appropriate it to Pollio, or his son, but"
11957,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","complimentally dates it from his consulship; and therefore some one,"
11958,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","who had not so kind thoughts of M. Fontenelle as I, would be inclined"
11959,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",to think him as bad a Catholic as critic in this place.
11960,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11961,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","But, in respect to some books he has wrote since, I pass by a great"
11962,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","part of this, and shall only touch briefly some of the rules of this"
11963,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",sort of poem.
11964,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11965,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The first is, that an air of piety, upon all occasions, should be"
11966,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",maintained in the whole poem. This appears in all the ancient Greek
11967,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","writers, as Homer, Hesiod, Aratus, &c. And Virgil is so exact in the"
11968,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","observation of it, not only in this work, but in his ""Æneïs"" too, that"
11969,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",a celebrated French writer taxes him for permitting Æneas to do nothing
11970,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","without the assistance of some god. But by this it appears, at least,"
11971,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",that M. St Evremont is no Jansenist.
11972,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11973,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",M. Fontenelle seems a little defective in this point: he brings in
11974,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","a pair of shepherdesses disputing very warmly, whether _Victoria_"
11975,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","be a goddess or a woman. Her great condescension and compassion,"
11976,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","her affability and goodness, (none of the meanest attributes of the"
11977,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","divinity,) pass for convincing arguments, that she could not possibly"
11978,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",be a goddess.
11979,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11980,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Les Déesses, toûjours fières et méprisantes,"
11981,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Ne rassureroient point les bergères tremblantes

11983,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Mais tu l'as vu: cette auguste personne,"
11984,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Qui vient de paroître en ces lieux,"
11985,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Prend soin de rassurer au moment qu'elle étonne;
11986,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Sa bonté descendant sans peine jusqu' à nous._
11987,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11988,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","In short, she has too many divine perfections to be a deity, and"
11989,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",therefore she is a mortal; which was the thing to be proved. It is
11990,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","directly contrary to the practice of all ancient poets, as well as to"
11991,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the rules of decency and religion, to make such odious preferences. I"
11992,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","am much surprised, therefore, that he should use such an argument as"
11993,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",this:
11994,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11995,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Cloris, as-tu vu des déesses"
11996,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Avoir un air si facile et si doux?_
11997,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
11998,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Was not Aurora, and Venus, and Luna, and I know not how many more of"
11999,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the heathen deities, too easy of access to Tithonus, to Anchises, and"
12000,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",to Endymion? Is there any thing more sparkish and better-humoured
12001,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",than Venus's accosting her son in the deserts of Libya? or than the
12002,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","behaviour of Pallas to Diomedes, one of the most perfect and admirable"
12003,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",pieces of all the Iliads; where she condescends to _raillé_ him so
12004,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","agreeably; and, notwithstanding her severe virtue, and all the ensigns"
12005,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of majesty with which she so terribly adorns herself, condescends to"
12006,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",ride with him in his chariot? But the Odysseys are full of greater
12007,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",instances of condescension than this.
12008,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12009,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","This brings to mind that famous passage of Lucan, in which he prefers"
12010,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Cato to all the gods at once:
12011,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12012,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa Catoni_--"
12013,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12014,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","which Breboeuf has rendered so flatly, and which may be thus"
12015,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",paraphrased:
12016,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12017,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Heaven meanly with the conqueror did comply;
12018,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","But Cato, rather than submit, would die.[292]"
12019,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12020,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","It is an unpardonable presumption in any sort of religion, to"
12021,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",compliment their princes at the expence of their deities.
12022,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12023,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","But, letting that pass, this whole Eclogue is but a long paraphrase of"

12036,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",P. Rapin has gathered many instances of this out of Theocritus and
12037,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Virgil; and the reader can do it as well as himself. But M. Fontenelle
12038,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","transgressed this rule, when he hid himself in the thicket to listen"
12039,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",to the private discourse of the two shepherdesses. This is not only
12040,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",ill breeding at Versailles; the Arcadian shepherdesses themselves would
12041,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",have set their dogs upon one for such an unpardonable piece of rudeness.
12042,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12043,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","A third rule is, that there should be some _ordonnance_, some design,"
12044,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","or little plot, which may deserve the title of a pastoral scene. This"
12045,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","is everywhere observed by Virgil, and particularly remarkable in the"
12046,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","first Eclogue, the standard of all pastorals. A beautiful landscape"
12047,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","presents itself to your view; a shepherd, with his flock around him,"
12048,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","resting securely under a spreading beech, which furnished the first"
12049,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",food to our ancestors; another in a quite different situation of
12050,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",mind and circumstances; the sun setting; the hospitality of the more
12051,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","fortunate shepherd, &c. And here M. Fontenelle seems not a little"
12052,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",wanting.
12053,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12054,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","A fourth rule, and of great importance in this delicate sort of"
12055,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","writing, is, that there be choice diversity of subjects; that the"
12056,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Eclogue, like a beautiful prospect, should charm by its variety. Virgil"
12057,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","is admirable in this point, and far surpasses Theocritus, as he does"
12058,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","everywhere, when judgment and contrivance have the principal part. The"
12059,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",subject of the first Pastoral is hinted above.
12060,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12061,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Second contains the love of Corydon for Alexis, and the seasonable"
12062,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","reproach he gives himself, that he left his vines half pruned, (which,"
12063,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","according to the Roman rituals, derived a curse upon the fruit that"
12064,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","grew upon it,) whilst he pursued an object undeserving his passion."
12065,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12066,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Third, a sharp contention of two shepherds for the prize of poetry."
12067,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12068,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Fourth contains the discourse of a shepherd comforting himself, in"
12069,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","a declining age, that a better was ensuing."
12070,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12071,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Fifth, a lamentation for a dead friend, the first draught of which"
12072,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",is probably more ancient than any of the pastorals now extant; his
12073,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",brother being at first intended; but he afterwards makes his court to
12074,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Augustus, by turning it into an apotheosis of Julius Cæsar."
12075,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12076,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",The Sixth is the Silenus.
12077,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12078,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Seventh, another poetical dispute, first composed at Mantua."
12079,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12080,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","The Eighth is the description of a despairing lover, and a magical"
12081,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",charm.
12082,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12083,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","He sets the Ninth after all these, very modestly, because it was"
12084,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","particular to himself; and here he would have ended that work, if"
12085,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Gallus had not prevailed upon him to add one more in his favour.
12086,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12087,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Thus curious was Virgil in diversifying his subjects. But M. Fontenelle
12088,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","is a great deal too uniform: begin where you please, the subject is"
12089,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","still the same. We find it true what he says of himself,"
12090,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12091,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Toûjours, toûjours de l'amour._"
12092,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12093,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",He seems to take pastorals and love-verses for the same thing. Has
12094,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","human nature no other passion? Does not fear, ambition, avarice,"
12095,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","pride, a capriccio of honour, and laziness itself, often triumph over"
12096,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","love? But this passion does all, not only in pastorals, but in modern"
12097,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","tragedies too. A hero can no more fight, or be sick, or die, than he"
12098,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","can be born, without a woman. But dramatics have been composed in"
12099,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","compliance to the humour of the age, and the prevailing inclination of"
12100,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the great, whose example has a more powerful influence, not only in the"
12101,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","little court behind the scenes, but on the great theatre of the world."
12102,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","However, this inundation of love-verses is not so much an effect of"
12103,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","their amorousness, as of immoderate self-love; this being the only"
12104,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","sort of poetry, in which the writer can, not only without censure,"
12105,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","but even with commendation, talk of himself. There is generally more"
12106,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of the passion of Narcissus, than concern for Chloris and Corinna, in"
12107,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","this whole affair. Be pleased to look into almost any of those writers,"
12108,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and you shall meet everywhere that eternal _Moi_, which the admirable"
12109,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",Pascal so judiciously condemns. Homer can never be enough admired
12110,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","for this one so particular quality, that he never speaks of himself,"
12111,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","either in the Iliad or the Odysseys: and, if Horace had never told us"
12112,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","his genealogy, but left it to the writer of his life, perhaps he had"
12113,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",not been a loser by it. This consideration might induce those great
12114,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","critics, Varius and Tucca, to raze out the four first verses of the"
12115,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","""Æneïs,"" in great measure, for the sake of that unlucky _Ille ego_. But"
12116,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","extraordinary geniuses have a sort of prerogative, which may dispense"
12117,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","them from laws, binding to subject wits. However, the ladies have the"
12118,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","less reason to be pleased with those addresses, of which the poet"
12119,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",takes the greater share to himself. Thus the beau presses into their
12120,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","dressing-room; but it is not so much to adore their fair eyes, as to"
12121,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","adjust his own steenkirk and peruke, and set his countenance in their"
12122,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",glass.
12123,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12124,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","A fifth rule (which one may hope will not be contested) is, that the"
12125,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",writer should show in his compositions some competent skill of the
12126,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","subject matter, that which makes the character of persons introduced."
12127,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","In this, as in all other points of learning, decency, and oeconomy"
12128,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of a poem, Virgil much excels his master Theocritus. The poet is"
12129,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",better skilled in husbandry than those that get their bread by it. He
12130,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","describes the nature, the diseases, the remedies, the proper places,"
12131,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and seasons, of feeding, of watering their flocks; the furniture, diet,"
12132,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the lodging and pastimes, of his shepherds. But the persons brought"
12133,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","in by M. Fontenelle are shepherds in masquerade, and handle their"
12134,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",sheep-hook as aukwardly as they do their oaten reed. They saunter about
12135,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",with their _chers moutons_; but they relate as little to the business
12136,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","in hand, as the painter's dog, or a Dutch ship, does to the history"
12137,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","designed. One would suspect some of them, that, instead of leading out"
12138,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","their sheep into the plains of Mont-Brison and Marcilli, to the flowery"
12139,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","banks of Lignon, or the Charante, they are driving directly _à la"
12140,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","boucherie_, to make money of them. I hope hereafter M. Fontenelle will"
12141,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",chuse his servants better.
12142,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12143,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","A sixth rule is, that, as the style ought to be natural, clear, and"
12144,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","elegant, it should have some peculiar relish of the ancient fashion"
12145,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of writing. Parables in those times were frequently used, as they"
12146,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","are still by the eastern nations; philosophical questions, ænigmas,"
12147,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","&c.; and of this we find instances in the sacred writings, in Homer,"
12148,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","contemporary with king David, in Herodotus, in the Greek tragedians."
12149,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",This piece of antiquity is imitated by Virgil with great judgment and
12150,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","discretion. He has proposed one riddle, which has never yet been solved"
12151,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",by any of his commentators. Though he knew the rules of rhetoric as
12152,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","well as Cicero himself, he conceals that skill in his Pastorals, and"
12153,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",keeps close to the character of antiquity. Nor ought the connections
12154,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",and transitions to be very strict and regular; this would give the
12155,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Pastorals an air of novelty; and of this neglect of exact connections,"
12156,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","we have instances in the writings of the ancient Chineses, of the"
12157,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Jews and Greeks, in Pindar, and other writers of dithyrambics, in the"
12158,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","choruses of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. If M. Fontenelle and"
12159,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Ruæus had considered this, the one would have spared his critique of"
12160,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the sixth, and the other, his reflections upon the ninth Pastoral."
12161,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",The over-scrupulous care of connections makes the modern compositions
12162,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",oftentimes tedious and flat: and by the omission of them it comes to
12163,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","pass, that the _Pensées_ of the incomparable M. Pascal, and perhaps of"
12164,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","M. Bruyère, are two of the most entertaining books which the modern"
12165,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","French can boast of. Virgil, in this point, was not only faithful to"
12166,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the character of antiquity, but copies after Nature herself. Thus"
12167,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","a meadow, where the beauties of the spring are profusely blended"
12168,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","together, makes a more delightful prospect, than a curious _parterre_"
12169,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",of sorted flowers in our gardens: and we are much more transported with
12170,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the beauty of the heavens, and admiration of their Creator, in a clear"
12171,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","night, when we behold stars of all magnitudes promiscuously moving"
12172,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","together, than if those glorious lights were ranked in their several"
12173,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","orders, or reduced into the finest geometrical figures."
12174,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12175,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Another rule omitted by P. Rapin, as some of his are by me, (for I do"
12176,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","not design an entire treatise in this preface,) is, that not only the"
12177,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","sentences should be short and smart, (upon which account he justly"
12178,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","blames the Italian and French, as too talkative,) but that the whole"
12179,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",piece should be so too. Virgil transgressed this rule in his first
12180,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Pastorals, (I mean those which he composed at Mantua,) but rectified"
12181,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the fault in his riper years. This appears by the _Culex_, which is"
12182,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",as long as five of his Pastorals put together. The greater part of
12183,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",those he finished have less than a hundred verses; and but two of them
12184,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","exceed that number. But the ""Silenus,"" which he seems to have designed"
12185,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","for his master-piece, in which he introduces a god singing, and he,"
12186,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","too, full of inspiration, (which is intended by that ebriety, which"
12187,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","M. Fontenelle so unreasonably ridicules,) though it go through so vast"
12188,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","a field of matter, and comprises the mythology of near two thousand"
12189,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","years, consists but of fifty lines; so that its brevity is no less"
12190,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","admirable, than the subject matter, the noble fashion of handling it,"
12191,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",and the deity speaking. Virgil keeps up his characters in this respect
12192,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","too, with the strictest decency: for poetry and pastime was not the"
12193,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","business of men's lives in those days, but only their seasonable"
12194,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",recreation after necessary labours. And therefore the length of some
12195,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",of the modern Italian and English compositions is against the rules of
12196,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",this kind of poesy.
12197,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12198,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","I shall add something very briefly, touching the versification of"
12199,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Pastorals, though it be a mortifying consideration to the moderns."
12200,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Heroic verse, as it is commonly called, was used by the Greeks in this"
12201,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","sort of poem, as very ancient and natural; lyrics, iambics, &c. being"
12202,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",invented afterwards: but there is so great a difference in the numbers
12203,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of which it may be compounded, that it may pass rather for a genus,"
12204,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","than species, of verse. Whosoever shall compare the numbers of the"
12205,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","three following verses, will quickly be sensible of the truth of this"
12206,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",observation:
12207,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12208,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Tityre, tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi_--"
12209,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12210,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","the first of the Georgics,"
12211,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12212,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Quid faciat lætas segetes, quo sidere terram_--"
12213,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12214,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","and of the Æneïs,"
12215,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12216,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Arma, virumque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris._"
12217,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12218,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",The sound of the verses is almost as different as the subjects. But
12219,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",the Greek writers of Pastoral usually limited themselves to the
12220,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","example of the first; which Virgil found so exceedingly difficult,"
12221,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","that he quitted it, and left the honour of that part to Theocritus. It"
12222,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","is indeed probable, that what we improperly call rhyme, is the most"
12223,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",ancient sort of poetry; and learned men have given good arguments for
12224,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","it; and therefore a French historian commits a gross mistake, when he"
12225,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","attributes that invention to a king of Gaul, as an English gentleman"
12226,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","does, when he makes a Roman emperor the inventor of it. But the Greeks,"
12227,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","who understood fully the force and power of numbers, soon grew weary"
12228,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of this childish sort of verse, as the younger Vossius justly calls"
12229,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","it, and therefore those rhyming hexameters, which Plutarch observes in"
12230,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Homer himself, seem to be the remains of a barbarous age. Virgil had"
12231,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","them in such abhorrence, that he would rather make a false syntax, than"
12232,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","what we call a rhyme. Such a verse as this,"
12233,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12234,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Vir, precor_, uxori, _frater succurre_ sorori,"
12235,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12236,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",was passable in Ovid; but the nicer ears in Augustus's court could not
12237,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",pardon Virgil for
12238,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12239,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",_At regina pyrâ...._
12240,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12241,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",so that the principal ornament of modern poetry was accounted
12242,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",deformity by the Latins and Greeks. It was they who invented the
12243,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","different terminations of words, those happy compositions, those"
12244,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","short monosyllables, those transpositions for the elegance of the"
12245,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","sound and sense, which are wanting so much in modern languages. The"
12246,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",French sometimes crowd together ten or twelve monosyllables into
12247,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","one disjointed verse. They may understand the nature of, but cannot"
12248,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","imitate, those wonderful spondees of Pythagoras, by which he could"
12249,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",suddenly pacify a man that was in a violent transport of anger; nor
12250,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","those swift numbers of the priests of Cybele, which had the force to"
12251,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",enrage the most sedate and phlegmatic tempers. Nor can any modern put
12252,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","into his own language the energy of that single poem of Catullus,"
12253,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12254,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Super alta vectus Atys_, &c."
12255,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12256,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Latin is but a corrupt dialect of Greek; and the French, Spanish, and"
12257,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Italian, a corruption of Latin; and therefore a man might as well go"
12258,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","about to persuade me that vinegar is a nobler liquor than wine, as"
12259,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",that the modern compositions can be as graceful and harmonious as the
12260,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Latin itself. The Greek tongue very naturally falls into iambics, and"
12261,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",therefore the diligent reader may find six or seven-and-twenty of them
12262,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",in those accurate orations of Isocrates. The Latin as naturally falls
12263,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",into heroic; and therefore the beginning of Livy's History is half a
12264,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","hexameter, and that of Tacitus an entire one. The Roman historian[293],"
12265,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",describing the glorious effort of a colonel to break through a brigade
12266,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of the enemy's, just after the defeat at Cannæ, falls, unknowingly,"
12267,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",into a verse not unworthy Virgil himself--
12268,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12269,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Hæc ubi dicta dedit, stringit gladium, cuneoque"
12270,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Facto, per medios...._ &c."
12271,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12272,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Ours and the French can at best but fall into blank verse, which is"
12273,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",a fault in prose. The misfortune indeed is common to us both; but we
12274,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","deserve more compassion, because we are not vain of our barbarities."
12275,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","As age brings men back into the state and infirmities of childhood,"
12276,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","upon the fall of their empire, the Romans doted into rhyme, as appears"
12277,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",sufficiently by the hymns of the Latin church; and yet a great deal of
12278,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",the French poetry does hardly deserve that poor title. I shall give an
12279,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",instance out of a poem which had the good luck to gain the prize in
12280,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",1685; for the subject deserved a nobler pen:
12281,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12282,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","_Tous les jours ce grand roy, des autres roys l' exemple,"
12283,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","S'ouvre un nouveau chemin au faîte de ton temple_, &c."
12284,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12285,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",The judicious Malherbe exploded this sort of verse near eighty
12286,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",years ago. Nor can I forbear wondering at that passage of a famous
12287,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","academician, in which he, most compassionately, excuses the ancients"
12288,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",for their not being so exact in their compositions as the modern
12289,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","French, because they wanted a dictionary, of which the French are at"
12290,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",last happily provided. If Demosthenes and Cicero had been so lucky as
12291,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","to have had a dictionary, and such a patron as cardinal Richelieu,"
12292,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",perhaps they might have aspired to the honour of Balzac's legacy of ten
12293,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","pounds, _Le prix de l'éloquence_."
12294,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12295,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","On the contrary, I dare assert, that there are hardly ten lines in"
12296,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","either of those great orators, or even in the catalogue of Homer's"
12297,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","ships, which are not more harmonious, more truly rhythmical, than most"
12298,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","of the French or English sonnets; and therefore they lose, at least,"
12299,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",one half of their native beauty by translation.
12300,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",
12301,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","I cannot but add one remark on this occasion,--that the French verse is"
12302,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","oftentimes not so much as rhyme, in the lowest sense; for the childish"
12303,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.",repetition of the same note cannot be called music. Such instances are
12304,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","infinite, as in the forecited poem:"

12309,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","M. Boileau himself has a great deal of this #monotonia#, not by his own"

12311,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","M. Fontenelle at last goes into the excessive paradoxes of M. Perrault,"

12315,"BY WILLIAM WALSH, ESQ.","Greek odes; but a few weeks would be sufficient, if a man were so very"

14151,ARGUMENT.,"Now I to fighting fields am sent afar,"
14152,ARGUMENT.,And strive in winter camps with toils of war;
14153,ARGUMENT.,"While you, (alas, that I should find it so!)                       }"
14154,ARGUMENT.,"To shun my sight, your native soil forego,                         }"
14155,ARGUMENT.,"And climb the frozen Alps, and tread the eternal snow.             }"
14156,ARGUMENT.,"Ye frosts and snows, her tender body spare!"
14157,ARGUMENT.,Those are not limbs for icicles to tear.
14158,ARGUMENT.,"For me, the wilds and deserts are my choice;"
14159,ARGUMENT.,"The Muses, once my care; my once harmonious voice."
14160,ARGUMENT.,"There will I sing, forsaken, and alone:"
14161,ARGUMENT.,The rocks and hollow caves shall echo to my moan.
14162,ARGUMENT.,The rind of every plant her name shall know;
14163,ARGUMENT.,"And, as the rind extends, the love shall grow."
14164,ARGUMENT.,Then on Arcadian mountains will I chase
14165,ARGUMENT.,(Mixed with the woodland nymphs) the savage race;
14166,ARGUMENT.,"Nor cold shall hinder me, with horns and hounds"
14167,ARGUMENT.,"To thrid the thickets, or to leap the mounds."
14168,ARGUMENT.,"And now methinks o'er steepy rocks I go,"
14169,ARGUMENT.,"And rush through sounding woods, and bend the Parthian bow;"
14170,ARGUMENT.,"As if with sports my sufferings I could ease,"
14171,ARGUMENT.,Or by my pains the god of love appease.
14172,ARGUMENT.,My frenzy changes: I delight no more
14173,ARGUMENT.,On mountain tops to chase the tusky boar:
14174,ARGUMENT.,No game but hopeless love my thoughts pursue:
14175,ARGUMENT.,"Once more, ye nymphs, and songs, and sounding woods, adieu!"
14176,ARGUMENT.,"Love alters not for us his hard decrees,"
14177,ARGUMENT.,"Not though beneath the Thracian clime we freeze,"
14178,ARGUMENT.,"Or Italy's indulgent heaven forego,"
14179,ARGUMENT.,And in mid-winter tread Sithonian snow;
14180,ARGUMENT.,"Or, when the barks of elms are scorched, we keep"
14181,ARGUMENT.,On Meroë's burning plains the Libyan sheep.
14182,ARGUMENT.,"In hell, and earth, and seas, and heaven above,"
14183,ARGUMENT.,"Love conquers all; and we must yield to Love."""
14184,ARGUMENT.,
14185,ARGUMENT.,"My Muses, here your sacred raptures end:"
14186,ARGUMENT.,The verse was what I owed my suffering friend.
14187,ARGUMENT.,"This while I sung, my sorrows I deceived,"
14188,ARGUMENT.,And bending osiers into baskets weaved.
14189,ARGUMENT.,"The song, because inspired by you, shall shine;"
14190,ARGUMENT.,"And Gallus will approve, because 'tis mine--"
14191,ARGUMENT.,"Gallus, for whom my holy flames renew,"
14192,ARGUMENT.,"Each hour, and every moment rise in view;"
14193,ARGUMENT.,"As alders, in the spring, their boles extend,"
14194,ARGUMENT.,"And heave so fiercely, that the bark they rend."
14195,ARGUMENT.,
14196,ARGUMENT.,Now let us rise; for hoarseness oft invades
14197,ARGUMENT.,"The singer's voice, who sings beneath the shades."
14198,ARGUMENT.,"From juniper unwholesome dews distil,                              }"
