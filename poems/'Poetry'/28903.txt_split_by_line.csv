185,UNTIL SHE DIED,Until she died we never knew
186,UNTIL SHE DIED,The beauty of our faith in God.
187,UNTIL SHE DIED,We'd seen the summer roses nod
188,UNTIL SHE DIED,"And wither as the tempests blew,"
189,UNTIL SHE DIED,Through many a spring we'd lived to see
190,UNTIL SHE DIED,The buds returning to the tree.
191,UNTIL SHE DIED,
192,UNTIL SHE DIED,We had not felt the touch of woe;
193,UNTIL SHE DIED,"What cares had come, had lightly flown;"
194,UNTIL SHE DIED,Our burdens we had borne alone--
195,UNTIL SHE DIED,The need of God we did not know.
196,UNTIL SHE DIED,It seemed sufficient through the days
197,UNTIL SHE DIED,To think and act in worldly ways.
198,UNTIL SHE DIED,
199,UNTIL SHE DIED,And then she closed her eyes in sleep;
200,UNTIL SHE DIED,She left us for a little while;
201,UNTIL SHE DIED,No more our lives would know her smile.
202,UNTIL SHE DIED,"And oh, the hurt of it went deep!"
203,UNTIL SHE DIED,It seemed to us that we must fall
204,UNTIL SHE DIED,Before the anguish of it all.
205,UNTIL SHE DIED,
206,UNTIL SHE DIED,"Our faith, which had not known the test,"
207,UNTIL SHE DIED,"Then blossomed with its comfort sweet,"
208,UNTIL SHE DIED,Promised that some day we should meet
209,UNTIL SHE DIED,"And whispered to us: ""He knows best."""
210,UNTIL SHE DIED,"And when our bitter tears were dried,"
211,UNTIL SHE DIED,We found our faith was glorified.

250,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"Mother and the baby! Oh, I know no lovelier pair,"
251,MOTHER AND THE BABY,For all the dreams of all the world are hovering 'round them there;
252,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"And be the baby in his cot or nestling in her arms,"
253,MOTHER AND THE BABY,The picture they present is one with never-fading charms.
254,MOTHER AND THE BABY,
255,MOTHER AND THE BABY,Mother and the baby--and the mother's eye aglow
256,MOTHER AND THE BABY,With joys that only mothers see and only mothers know!
257,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"And here is all there is to strife and all there is to fame,"
258,MOTHER AND THE BABY,And all that men have struggled for since first a baby came.
259,MOTHER AND THE BABY,
260,MOTHER AND THE BABY,I never see this lovely pair nor hear the mother sing
261,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"The lullabies of babyhood, but I start wondering"
262,MOTHER AND THE BABY,How much of every man to-day the world thinks wise or brave
263,MOTHER AND THE BABY,Is of the songs his mother sang and of the strength she gave.

272,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"And every care that she bestows, it is the man she makes."
273,MOTHER AND THE BABY,
274,MOTHER AND THE BABY,Mother and the baby! And in fancy I can see
275,MOTHER AND THE BABY,"Her life being given gladly to the man that is to be,"

277,MOTHER AND THE BABY,She dreams and hopes and nightly prays a strong man shall arise.

283,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,
284,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,
285,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Old-fashioned letters! How good they were!
286,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And nobody writes them now;
287,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Never at all comes in the scrawl
288,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,On the written pages which told us all
289,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"The news of town and the folks we knew,"
290,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And what they had done or were going to do.
291,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,It seems we've forgotten how
292,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,To spend an hour with our pen in hand
293,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,To write in the language we understand.
294,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,
295,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Old-fashioned letters we used to get
296,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And ponder each fond line o'er;
297,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"The glad words rolled like running gold,"
298,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"As smoothly their tales of joy they told,"
299,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And our hearts beat fast with a keen delight
300,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,As we read the news they were pleased to write
301,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And gathered the love they bore.
302,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,But few of the letters that come to-day
303,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Are penned to us in the old-time way.
304,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,
305,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Old-fashioned letters that told us all
306,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,The tales of the far away;
307,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Where they'd been and the folks they'd seen;
308,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And better than any fine magazine
309,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"Was the writing too, for it bore the style"
310,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"Of a simple heart and a sunny smile,"
311,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And was pure as the breath of May.
312,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"Some of them oft were damp with tears,"
313,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,But those were the letters that lived for years.
314,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,
315,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Old-fashioned letters! How good they were!
316,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"And, oh, how we watched the mails;"
317,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,But nobody writes of the quaint delights
318,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Of the sunny days and the merry nights
319,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,Or tells us the things that we yearn to know--
320,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"That art passed out with the long ago,"
321,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,And lost are the simple tales;
322,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,"Yet we all would happier be, I think,"
323,OLD-FASHIONED LETTERS,If we'd spend more time with our pen and ink.

334,THIS DAY FOR ME,"On a sea o' smooth blue water. Oh, I ain't an egotist,"
335,THIS DAY FOR ME,"With an ""I"" in all my thinkin', but I'm willin' to insist"
336,THIS DAY FOR ME,That the Lord that made us humans an' the birds in every tree
337,THIS DAY FOR ME,Knows my special sort o' weather an' He made this day fer me.
338,THIS DAY FOR ME,
339,THIS DAY FOR ME,"This is jes' my style o' weather--sunshine floodin' all the place,"
340,THIS DAY FOR ME,An' the breezes from the eastward blowin' gently on my face.
341,THIS DAY FOR ME,An' the woods chock-full o' singin' till you'd think birds never had
342,THIS DAY FOR ME,A single care to fret 'em or a grief to make 'em sad.

353,THIS DAY FOR ME,"Like a weddin' celebration. Why, I've plumb fergot my care"
354,THIS DAY FOR ME,"An' the tasks I should be doin' fer the rainy days to be,"

363,FORGETFUL PA,My Pa says that he used to be
364,FORGETFUL PA,A bright boy in geography;
365,FORGETFUL PA,An' when he went to school he knew
366,FORGETFUL PA,"The rivers an' the mountains, too,"
367,FORGETFUL PA,An' all the capitals of states
368,FORGETFUL PA,An' bound'ry lines an' all the dates
369,FORGETFUL PA,They joined the union. But last night
370,FORGETFUL PA,When I was studyin' to recite
371,FORGETFUL PA,I asked him if he would explain
372,FORGETFUL PA,The leading industries of Maine--
373,FORGETFUL PA,"He thought an' thought an' thought a lot,"
374,FORGETFUL PA,"An' said, ""I knew, but I've forgot."""
375,FORGETFUL PA,
376,FORGETFUL PA,My Pa says when he was in school
377,FORGETFUL PA,He got a hundred as a rule;
378,FORGETFUL PA,An' grammar was a thing he knew
379,FORGETFUL PA,Becoz he paid attention to
380,FORGETFUL PA,"His teacher, an' he learned the way"
381,FORGETFUL PA,"To write good English, an' to say"
382,FORGETFUL PA,"The proper things, an' I should be"
383,FORGETFUL PA,As good a boy in school as he.

816,A BOY AND HIS DAD,Father and son and the open sky
817,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"And the white clouds lazily drifting by,"
818,A BOY AND HIS DAD,And the laughing stream as it runs along
819,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"With the clicking reel like a martial song,"
820,A BOY AND HIS DAD,And the father teaching the youngster gay
821,A BOY AND HIS DAD,How to land a fish in the sportsman's way.
822,A BOY AND HIS DAD,
823,A BOY AND HIS DAD,I fancy I hear them talking there
824,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"In an open boat, and the speech is fair."
825,A BOY AND HIS DAD,And the boy is learning the ways of men
826,A BOY AND HIS DAD,From the finest man in his youthful ken.
827,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"Kings, to the youngster, cannot compare"
828,A BOY AND HIS DAD,With the gentle father who's with him there.
829,A BOY AND HIS DAD,And the greatest mind of the human race
830,A BOY AND HIS DAD,Not for one minute could take his place.
831,A BOY AND HIS DAD,
832,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"Which is happier, man or boy?"
833,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"The soul of the father is steeped in joy,"
834,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"For he's finding out, to his heart's delight,"
835,A BOY AND HIS DAD,That his son is fit for the future fight.
836,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"He is learning the glorious depths of him,"
837,A BOY AND HIS DAD,And the thoughts he thinks and his every whim;
838,A BOY AND HIS DAD,"And he shall discover, when night comes on,"
839,A BOY AND HIS DAD,How close he has grown to his little son.

877,BREAD AND GRAVY,"Like breast o' guinea under glass, or curried turkey wings--"
878,BREAD AND GRAVY,You want just plain home cookin' an' the chance to sit an' wait

884,BREAD AND GRAVY,"An' the mother an' the father handing all the good things out,"
885,BREAD AND GRAVY,"An' the knowledge in their presence that I needn't fear to state,"

2021,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,
2022,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,
2023,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"Bill Jones, who goes to school with me,"
2024,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,Is the saddest boy I ever see.
2025,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,He's just so 'fraid he runs away
2026,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"When all of us fellows want to play,"
2027,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' says he dassent stay about
2028,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,Coz if his father found it out
2029,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,He'd wallop him. An' he can't go
2030,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,With us to see a picture show
2031,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"On Saturdays, an' it's too bad,"
2032,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,But he's afraid to ask his dad.
2033,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,
2034,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"When he gets his report card, he"
2035,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"Is just as scared as scared can be,"
2036,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' once I saw him when he cried
2037,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,Becoz although he'd tried an' tried
2038,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"His best, the teacher didn't care"
2039,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"An' only marked his spelling fair,"
2040,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' he told me there'd be a fight
2041,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,When his dad saw his card that night.
2042,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,It seems to me it's awful bad
2043,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,To be so frightened of your dad.
2044,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,
2045,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,My Dad ain't that way--I can go
2046,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"An' tell him everything I know,"
2047,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"An' ask him things, an' when he comes"
2048,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,Back home at night he says we're chums;
2049,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"An' we go out an' take a walk,"
2050,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' all the time he lets me talk.
2051,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,I ain't scared to tell him what
2052,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,I've done to-day that I should not;
2053,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,When I get home I'm always glad
2054,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,To stay around an' play with Dad.
2055,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,
2056,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"Bill Jones, he says, he wishes he"
2057,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"Could have a father just like me,"
2058,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"But his dad hasn't time to play,"
2059,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' so he chases him away
2060,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' scolds him when he makes a noise
2061,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,An' licks him if he breaks his toys.
2062,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,Sometimes Bill says he's got to lie
2063,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,"Or else get whipped, an' that is why"
2064,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,It seems to me it's awful bad
2065,AFRAID OF HIS DAD,To be so frightened of your dad.
