37,ADVERTISEMENT.,"As far as the seventy-fourth page, these Poems have been printed about"
38,ADVERTISEMENT.,two years; during which many things happened likely to prevent their
39,ADVERTISEMENT.,"ever appearing. The time, however, is now come, and I have to-day found"
40,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the remainder, up to where the lines end with"
41,ADVERTISEMENT.,
42,ADVERTISEMENT.,"""Its unpolluted birthright."""
43,ADVERTISEMENT.,
44,ADVERTISEMENT.,"On reading the whole over, they struck me with much surprise, as they"
45,ADVERTISEMENT.,"appear in a singular manner prophetic. I wrote them with a general, and"
46,ADVERTISEMENT.,somewhat undefined view; and they now take the aspect of speaking on
47,ADVERTISEMENT.,"what has since happened to myself--a long seclusion, during which I was"
48,ADVERTISEMENT.,"bereft of the common means of study, having given rise to one that has"
49,ADVERTISEMENT.,"turned out far more important than I at first imagined, and which I have"
50,ADVERTISEMENT.,"continued since, to the exclusion of every other pursuit."

63,I.,
64,I.,
65,I.,"If writing Journals were my task,"
66,I.,From cottagers to kings--
67,I.,"A little book I'd only ask,"
68,I.,And fill it full of wings!
69,I.,
70,I.,Each pair should represent a day:
71,I.,"On some the sun should rise,"
72,I.,While others bent their mournful way
73,I.,Through cold and cloudy skies.
74,I.,
75,I.,And here I would the light'ning bring
76,I.,"With threatening, forked glare;"
77,I.,And there the hallowed rainbow fling
78,I.,Across the troubled air.
79,I.,
80,I.,Some faint and wearily should glide
81,I.,Their broken flight along--
82,I.,While some high in the air should ride
83,I.,"Dilated, bold, and strong."
84,I.,
85,I.,"Some agitated and adrift,"
86,I.,Against their will should rove;
87,I.,"Some, steering forward, sure and swift,"
88,I.,Should scarcely seem to move--
89,I.,
90,I.,"While others, happiest of their kind!"
91,I.,"Should in the ether soar,"
92,I.,"As if no care would ever find,"
93,I.,No sorrow reach them more;
94,I.,
95,I.,When soon an arrow from below
96,I.,"Should wound them in their flight,"
97,I.,And many a crimson drop should flow
98,I.,Before they fell in sight.
99,I.,
100,I.,"The rapid and abrupt descent,"
101,I.,"The stain'd and ruffled plume,"
102,I.,Would seem as if they were not meant
103,I.,Their ardour to resume.
104,I.,
105,I.,But soon their beauty and their force
106,I.,Sweet hours of rest renew;
107,I.,"Full soon their light, their varied course"
108,I.,Careering they pursue.
109,I.,
110,I.,"Alternately to rise and fall,"
111,I.,Or float along the day--
112,I.,And this is Fortune--This is all
113,I.,I would vouchsafe to say!

121,II.,"Lucy, I think not of thy beauty,"
122,II.,I praise not each peculiar grace;
123,II.,"To see thee in the path of duty,"
124,II.,"And with that happy, smiling face,"
125,II.,"Conveys more pleasure to thy friend,"
126,II.,Than any outward charm could lend.
127,II.,
128,II.,"I see thy graceful babes caress thee,"
129,II.,"I mark thy wise, maternal care,"
130,II.,"And sadly do the words impress me,"
131,II.,The magic words--that thou art fair.
132,II.,I wonder that a tongue is found
133,II.,To utter the unfeeling sound!
134,II.,
135,II.,"For, art thou not above such praises?"
136,II.,And is this all that they can see?
137,II.,"Poor is the joy such flattery raises,"
138,II.,"And, oh! how much unworthy thee!"
139,II.,Unworthy one whose heart can feel
140,II.,"The voice of truth, the warmth of zeal!"
141,II.,
142,II.,"O Lucy, thou art snatch'd from folly,"
143,II.,"Become too tender to be vain,"
144,II.,"The world, it makes me melancholy,"
145,II.,The world would lure thee back again!
146,II.,"And it would cost me many sighs,"
147,II.,To see it win so bright a prize!
148,II.,
149,II.,"Though passing apprehensions move me,"
150,II.,I know thou hast a noble heart;
151,II.,"But, Lucy, I so truly love thee,"
152,II.,"So much admire thee as thou art,"
153,II.,"That, but the shadow of a fear,"
154,II.,Wakes in my breast a pang sincere.

170,THE ARTISAN.,"My sinking heart its freedom gains,"
171,THE ARTISAN.,Which poverty had bound in chains!
172,THE ARTISAN.,
173,THE ARTISAN.,For here unheard the moments fly--
174,THE ARTISAN.,"And so secure, so happy I,"
175,THE ARTISAN.,"That, often at the very last,"

177,THE ARTISAN.,"The little hour of bliss I spend,"
178,THE ARTISAN.,"With thee, my chosen, only friend!"
179,THE ARTISAN.,"That transient hour the heart sustains,"
180,THE ARTISAN.,Which poverty has bound in chains!
181,THE ARTISAN.,
182,THE ARTISAN.,"And for this dear, this precious hour,"
183,THE ARTISAN.,"I would not, if I had the power,"
184,THE ARTISAN.,"Exchange a worldling's life of ease,"
185,THE ARTISAN.,Whom all around him seek to please.
186,THE ARTISAN.,"I have no other friend beside,"
187,THE ARTISAN.,But here I safely may confide.
188,THE ARTISAN.,"Suspicion ne'er the bosom stains,"
189,THE ARTISAN.,Which poverty has bound in chains!
190,THE ARTISAN.,
191,THE ARTISAN.,How oft I wonder at my lot!
192,THE ARTISAN.,How oft are all but thee forgot!
193,THE ARTISAN.,"While in this half-despairing breast,"
194,THE ARTISAN.,"Love builds a little, quiet nest,"
195,THE ARTISAN.,"To hover o'er with joyous wing,"
196,THE ARTISAN.,"Nay, sometimes soar aloft and sing!"

231,IV.,"""And when I met with foreign dames"

235,IV.,
236,IV.,"""My early playmate! oft I humm'd"

703,XVIII.,
704,XVIII.,"Believing love was all a bubble,"
705,XVIII.,"And wooing but a needless trouble,"
706,XVIII.,"Damon grew fond of posied rings,"
707,XVIII.,And many such romantic things;
708,XVIII.,"But whether it were Fortune's spite,"
709,XVIII.,"That study wound his brain too tight,"

711,XVIII.,He could not on the lady fix.
712,XVIII.,"He look'd around,"
713,XVIII.,"And often found,"
714,XVIII.,A damsel passing fair;
715,XVIII.,"""_She's good enough,_"" he then would cry,"
716,XVIII.,"And rub his hands, and wink his eye,"
717,XVIII.,"""_I'll be enamour'd there!_"""
718,XVIII.,
719,XVIII.,He thus resolved; but had not power
720,XVIII.,"To hold the humour ""_half an hour_""--"
721,XVIII.,"And critics, vers'd in Cupid's laws,"
722,XVIII.,"Pretended they had found a clause,"
723,XVIII.,In an old volume on the shelf;--
724,XVIII.,"Which said, if arrows chanc'd to fly,"
725,XVIII.,"When no bright nymph was passing by,"
726,XVIII.,And lighted on a vacant breast;
727,XVIII.,"The swain, Narcissus-like possest,"
728,XVIII.,Strait doated on himself!
729,XVIII.,
730,XVIII.,"If so, his anxious friends declar'd"

732,XVIII.,"A heart thus pierc'd would never rove,"

734,XVIII.,No distance e'er could give him pain--
735,XVIII.,No rivalry torment his brain.
736,XVIII.,"Self-love will bear a many knocks,"

738,XVIII.,"One moment languish in despair,"
739,XVIII.,The next alert and debonair.

741,XVIII.,"Poor Damon bit his nails and sigh'd,"

745,XVIII.,"Of rules establish'd in the place,"
746,XVIII.,"Or, how to enter with a grace,"
747,XVIII.,"He own'd he neither knew nor car'd,"
748,XVIII.,"But thought _such nonsense better spar'd_,"
749,XVIII.,And went undaunted and alone

751,XVIII.,"He kiss'd no hand, he bent no knee,"
752,XVIII.,"Nor measur'd steps of one, two, three,"
753,XVIII.,"But made a careless, slouching bow,"
754,XVIII.,"And said, ""Your highness will allow,"

781,XVIII.,But still we very much admire
782,XVIII.,Your entering in such strange attire!

784,XVIII.,"And countenance--It should appear,"
785,XVIII.,You know not we are sovereign here!
786,XVIII.,The soldiers of our chosen band
787,XVIII.,Approach not till we give command.
788,XVIII.,"We every look and action sway,"
789,XVIII.,And they with prompt delight obey.
790,XVIII.,"For height, and size, and such like things,"
791,XVIII.,We care far less than other kings;
792,XVIII.,"But station, learning, no pretence,"
793,XVIII.,Can make us with our power dispense.
794,XVIII.,"The warrior must not here look big,"
795,XVIII.,"The lawyer doffs his forked wig,"
796,XVIII.,"The portly merchant rich and free,"
797,XVIII.,Forgets his pride and bends the knee;
798,XVIII.,"The doctor gives his terrors scope,"
799,XVIII.,"And, like a patient, whines for hope;"
800,XVIII.,"In short the wise have childish fits,"
801,XVIII.,And fools and madmen find their wits.
802,XVIII.,"""Then go--this silly pride subdue,"
803,XVIII.,And thou shall be our servant too!
804,XVIII.,"Acquire the courtly way of speech,"
805,XVIII.,"Not, 'do you hear?' but, 'I beseech.'"

808,XVIII.,"We never scorn a humble prayer!"""
809,XVIII.,
810,XVIII.,"Expecting then a heart submiss,"
811,XVIII.,He held him forth his hand to kiss;
812,XVIII.,"For petrified the while he spoke,"
813,XVIII.,With troubled wonder in his look
814,XVIII.,"Poor Damon stood; aghast, suspended,"
815,XVIII.,But gain'd his senses as he ended;
816,XVIII.,"Abruptly turning on his toe,"
817,XVIII.,"""I thank you, Master Cupid, no!"
818,XVIII.,"I am a freeman and a brave,"
819,XVIII.,And will not stoop to be a slave.
820,XVIII.,"Your rules will never do for me,"
821,XVIII.,I'd rather learn the rule of three--
822,XVIII.,"""And since I find it is the plan,"
823,XVIII.,"To make me an automaton,"
824,XVIII.,"I'll case my heart in triple mail,"
825,XVIII.,"And fence it so completely round,"
826,XVIII.,"That all this vaunted skill shall fail,"
827,XVIII.,Those blunted arrows back rebound;
828,XVIII.,"For know, usurper! from this hour,"
829,XVIII.,"I scorn thy laws, abjure thy power!"
830,XVIII.,From this dear moment I despise
831,XVIII.,The whole artillery of eyes;
832,XVIII.,"Reason alone shall be my guide,"
833,XVIII.,And Reason's voice shall win my bride.
834,XVIII.,Some bonny lass shall say I can
835,XVIII.,Love you as well as any man;
836,XVIII.,"I will the self-same troth accord,"
837,XVIII.,Most gladly take her at her word;
838,XVIII.,And we may just as happy prove
839,XVIII.,Without the fooleries of love.
840,XVIII.,"She must not ask so much attention,"
841,XVIII.,As many ladies I could mention;
842,XVIII.,"But when I do not want to sway,"
843,XVIII.,I'll always let her have her way;
844,XVIII.,"And study to oblige her too,"
845,XVIII.,When I have nothing else to do;
846,XVIII.,"And am not tired, or wish to rest,"
847,XVIII.,"Or like some other plan the best,"
848,XVIII.,"For, more than this would be a task,"
849,XVIII.,None but thy votaries would ask.
850,XVIII.,"She must have riches, beauty, grace,"
851,XVIII.,"And modest sweetness in her face."""
852,XVIII.,Just then he saw a scornful sneer
853,XVIII.,Upon Dan Cupid's face appear;
854,XVIII.,"While courtiers whispered with a grin,"
855,XVIII.,"""Poor fellow, he'll be taken in!"
856,XVIII.,"The finest birds are always shy,"
857,XVIII.,"The rarest at a distance fly,"
858,XVIII.,"And Reason cannot soar so high."""
859,XVIII.,"""Aye, you may laugh, to prove her mind"
860,XVIII.,"At once exalted and refined,"
861,XVIII.,I'll watch her skill in music's art;
862,XVIII.,"By ear and fingers judge the heart,"
863,XVIII.,And then it will not be believ'd
864,XVIII.,I can be easily deceiv'd.
865,XVIII.,I only grieve that in my prime
866,XVIII.,"I've wasted so much precious time,"
867,XVIII.,"For long ere this I might have married,"
868,XVIII.,"Had I not so unwisely tarried,"

874,XVIII.,"Thou hast no friend in Common Sense,"

876,XVIII.,"To stand aside without pretence,"
877,XVIII.,And sanction laws which thou despisest.
878,XVIII.,"But try the plan, it merits praise,"
879,XVIII.,Success may crown its winning ways!
880,XVIII.,"The lady must be blind indeed,"
881,XVIII.,"With whom such offers of neglect,"
882,XVIII.,"And cool, habitual disrespect"
