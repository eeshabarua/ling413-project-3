10,VAGABONDIA.,VAGABONDIA. 
11,VAGABONDIA.,"Off with the fetters That chafe and restrain! Off with the chain! Here Art and Letters, Music and wine, And Myrtle and Wanda, The winsome witches, Blithely combine. Here are true riches, Here is Golconda, Here are the Indies, Here we are free-- Free as the wind is, Free, as the sea. Free! "
12,VAGABONDIA.,Houp-la! 
13,VAGABONDIA.,"What have we To do with the way Of the Pharisee? We go or we stay At our own sweet will; We think as we say, And we say or keep still At our own sweet will, At our own sweet will. "
14,VAGABONDIA.,"Here we are free To be good or bad, Sane or mad, Merry or grim As the mood may be,-- Free as the whim Of a spook on a spree,-- Free to be oddities, Not mere commodities, Stupid and salable, Wholly available, Ranged upon shelves; Each with his puny form In the same uniform, Cramped and disabled; We are not labelled, We are ourselves. "
15,VAGABONDIA.,"Here is the real, Here the ideal; Laughable hardship Met and forgot, Glory of bardship-- World's bloom and world's blot; The shock and the jostle, The mock and the push, But hearts like the throstle A-joy in the bush; Wits that would merrily Laugh away wrong, Throats that would verily Melt Hell in Song. "
16,VAGABONDIA.,"What though the dimes be Elusive as rhymes be, And Bessie, with finger Uplifted, is warning That breakfast next morning (A subject she's scorning) Is mighty uncertain! "
17,VAGABONDIA.,What care we? Linger A moment to kiss-- No time's amiss To a vagabond's ardor-- Thee finish the larder And pull down the curtain. 
18,VAGABONDIA.,"Unless ere the kiss come, Black Richard or Bliss come, Or Tom with a flagon, Or Karl with a jag on-- Then up and after The joy of the night With the hounds of laughter To follow the flight Of the fox-foot hours That double and run Through brakes and bowers Of folly and fun. "
19,VAGABONDIA.,"With the comrade heart For a moment's play, And the comrade heart For a heavier day, And the comrade heart Forever and aye. "
20,VAGABONDIA.,For the joy of wine Is not for long; And the joy of song Is a dream of shine; But the comrade heart Shall outlast art And a woman's love The fame thereof. 
21,VAGABONDIA.,"But wine for a sign Of the love we bring! And song for an oath That Love is king! And both, and both For his worshipping! "
22,VAGABONDIA.,"Then up and away Till the break of day, With a heart that's merry, And a Tom-and-Jerry, And a derry-down-derry-- What's that you say. You highly respectable Buyers and sellers? We should be decenter? Not as we please inter Custom, frugality, Use and morality In the delectable Depths of wine-cellars? "
23,VAGABONDIA.,"Midnights of revel, And noondays of song! Is it so wrong? Go to the Devil! "
24,VAGABONDIA.,"I tell you that we, While you are smirking And lying and shirking life's duty of duties, Honest sincerity, We are in verity Free! Free to rejoice In blisses and beauties! Free as the voice Of the wind as it passes! Free as the bird In the weft of the grasses! Free as the word Of the sun to the sea-- Free! "
25,A WAIF.,A WAIF. 
26,A WAIF.,"Do you know what it is to be vagrant born? A waif is only a waif. And so, For another idle hour I sit, In large content while the fire burns low. "
27,A WAIF.,"I gossip here to my crony heart Of the day just over, and count it one Of the royal elemental days, Though its dreams were few and its deeds were none. "
28,A WAIF.,"Outside, the winter; inside, the warmth And a sweet oblivion of turmoil. Why? All for a gentle girlish hand With its warm and lingering good-bye. "
29,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD. 
30,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,Now the joys of the road are chiefly these: A crimson touch on the hard-wood trees; 
31,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A vagrant's morning wide and blue, In early fall when the wind walks, too; "
32,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A shadowy highway cool and brown, Alluring up and enticing down "
33,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"From rippled water to dappled swamp, From purple glory to scarlet pomp; "
34,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"The outward eye, the quiet will, And the striding heart from hill to hill; "
35,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,The tempter apple over the fence; The cobweb bloom on the yellow quince; 
36,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"The palish asters along the wood,-- A lyric touch of the solitude; "
37,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"An open hand, an easy shoe. And a hope to make the day go through,-- "
38,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Another to sleep with, and a third To wake me up at the voice of a bird; "
39,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"The resonant far-listening morn, And the hoarse whisper of the corn; "
40,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"The crickets mourning their comrades lost, In the night's retreat from the gathering frost; "
41,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"(Or is it their slogan, plaintive and shrill, As they beat on their corselets, valiant still?) "
42,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A hunger fit for the kings of the sea, And a loaf of bread for Dickon and me; "
43,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A thirst like that of the Thirsty Sword, And a jug of cider on the board; "
44,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"An idle noon, a bubbling spring, The sea in the pine-tops murmuring; "
45,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A scrap of gossip at the ferry; A comrade neither glum nor merry, "
46,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Asking nothing, revealing naught, But minting his words from a fund of thought, "
47,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A keeper of silence eloquent, Needy, yet royally well content, "
48,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Of the mettled breed, yet abhorring strife, And full of the mellow juice of life; "
49,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A taster of wine, with an eye for a maid, Never too bold, and never afraid, "
50,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Never heart-whole, never heart-sick, (These are the things I worship in Dick) "
51,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"No fidget and no reformer, just A calm observer of ought and must, "
52,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A lover of books, but a reader of man, No cynic and no charlatan, "
53,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Who never defers and never demands, But, smiling, takes the world in his hands,-- "
54,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,Seeing it good as when God first saw And gave it the weight of his will for law. 
55,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"And O the joy that is never won, But follows and follows the journeying sun, "
56,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"By marsh and tide, by meadow and stream, A will-o'-the-wind, a light-o'-dream, "
57,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"Delusion afar, delight anear, From morrow to morrow, from year to year, "
58,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"A jack-o'-lantern, a fairy fire, A dare, a bliss, and a desire! "
59,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"The racy smell of the forest loam, When the stealthy, sad-heart leaves go home; "
60,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,"(O leaves, O leaves, I am one with you, Of the mould and the sun and the wind and the dew!) "
61,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,The broad gold wake of the afternoon; The silent fleck of the cold new moon; 
62,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,The sound of the hollow sea's release From stormy tumult to starry peace; 
63,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,With only another league to wend; And two brown arms at the journey's end! 
64,THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.,These are the joys of the open road-- For him who travels without a load. 
65,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC. 
66,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"The fervid breath of our flushed Southern May Is sweet upon the city's throat and lips, As a lover's whose tired arm slips Listlessly over the shoulder of a queen. "
67,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Far away The river melts in the unseen. Oh, beautiful Girl-City, how she dips Her feet in the stream With a touch that is half a kiss and half a dream! Her face is very fair, With flowers for smiles and sunlight in her hair. "
68,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"My westland flower-town, how serene she is! Here on this hill from which I look at her, All is still as if a worshipper Left at some shrine his offering. "
69,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Soft winds kiss My cheek with a slow lingering. A luring whisper where the laurels stir Wiles my heart back to woodland-ward again. 
70,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"But lo, Across the sky the sunset couriers run, And I remain To watch the imperial pageant of the Sun Mock me, an impotent Cortez here below, With splendors of its vaster Mexico. "
71,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,O Eldorado of the templed clouds! O golden city of the western sky! Not like the Spaniard would I storm thy gates; Not like the babe stretch chubby hands and cry 
72,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"To have thee for a toy; but far from crowds, Like my Faun brother in the ferny glen, Peer from the wood's edge while thy glory waits, And in the darkening thickets plunge again. "
73,SPRING SONG.,SPRING SONG. 
74,SPRING SONG.,"Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! When thy flowery hand delivers All the mountain-prisoned rivers, And thy great heart beats and quivers, To revive the days that were, Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! "
75,SPRING SONG.,"Take my dust and all my dreaming, Count my heart-beats one by one, Send them where the winters perish; Then some golden noon recherish And restore them in the sun, Flower and scent and dust and dreaming, With their heart-beats every one! "
76,SPRING SONG.,"Set me in the urge and tide-drift Of the streaming hosts a-wing! Breast of scarlet, throat of yellow, Raucous challenge, wooings mellow-- Every migrant is my fellow, Making northward with the spring. Loose me in the urge and tide-drift Of the streaming hosts a-wing! "
77,SPRING SONG.,"Shrilling pipe or fluting whistle, In the valleys come again; Fife of frog and call of tree-toad, All my brothers, five or three-toed, With their revel no more vetoed, Making music in the rain; Shrilling pipe or fluting whistle, In the valleys come again. "
78,SPRING SONG.,"Make me of thy seed to-morrow, When the sap begins to stir! Tawny light-foot, sleepy bruin, Bright-eyes in the orchard ruin, Gnarl the good life goes askew in, Whiskey-jack, or tanager,-- Make me anything to-morrow, When the sap begins to stir! "
79,SPRING SONG.,"Make me even (How do I know?) Like my friend the gargoyle there; It may be the heart within him Swells that doltish hands should pin him Fixed forever in mid-air. Make me even sport for swallows, Like the soaring gargoyle there! "
80,SPRING SONG.,"Give me the old clue to follow, Through the labyrinth of night! Clod of clay with heart of fire, Things that burrow and aspire, With the vanishing desire, For the perishing delight,-- Only the old clue to follow, Through the labyrinth of night! "
81,SPRING SONG.,"Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! Fashion me from swamp or meadow, Garden plot or ferny shadow, Hyacinth or humble burr! Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! "
82,SPRING SONG.,"Let me hear the far, low summons, When the silver winds return; Rills that run and streams that stammer, Goldenwing with his loud hammer, Icy brooks that brawl and clamor, Where the Indian willows burn; Let me hearken to the calling, When the silver winds return, "
83,SPRING SONG.,"Till recurring and recurring, Long since wandered and come back, Like a whim of Grieg's or Gounod's, This same self, bird, bud, or Bluenose, Some day I may capture (Who knows?) Just the one last joy I lack, Waking to the far new summons, When the old spring winds come back. "
84,SPRING SONG.,"For I have no choice of being, When the sap begins to climb,-- Strong insistence, sweet intrusion, Vasts and verges of illusion,-- So I win, to time's confusion, The one perfect pearl of time, Joy and joy and joy forever, Till the sap forgets to climb! "
85,SPRING SONG.,"Make me over in the morning From the rag-bag of the world! Scraps of dream and duds of daring, Home-brought stuff from far sea-faring, Faded colors once so flaring, Shreds of banners long since furled! Hues of ash and glints of glory, In the rag-bag of the world! "
86,SPRING SONG.,"Let me taste the old immortal Indolence of life once more; Not recalling nor foreseeing, Let the great slow joys of being Well my heart through as of yore! Let me taste the old immortal Indolence of life once more! "
87,SPRING SONG.,"Give me the old drink for rapture, The delirium to drain, All my fellows drank in plenty At the Three Score Inns and Twenty From the mountains to the main! Give me the old drink for rapture, The delirium to drain! "
88,SPRING SONG.,"Only make me over, April, When the sap begins to stir! Make me man or make me woman, Make me oaf or ape or human, Cup of flower or cone of fir; Make me anything but neuter When the sap begins to stir! "
89,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT. 
90,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"I will go out to grass with that old King, For I am weary of clothes and cooks. I long to lie along the banks of brooks, And watch the boughs above me sway and swing. Come, I will pluck off custom's livery, Nor longer be a lackey to old Time. Time shall serve me, and at my feet shall fling The spoil of listless minutes. I shall climb The wild trees for my food, and run Through dale and upland as a fox runs free, Laugh for cool joy and sleep i' the warm sun, And men will call me mad, like that old King. "
91,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"For I am woodland-natured, and have made Dryads my bedfellows, And I have played With the sleek Naiads in the splash of pools And made a mock of gowned and trousered fools. Helen, none knows Better than thou how like a Faun I strayed. And I am half Faun now, and my heart goes Out to the forest and the crack of twigs, The drip of wet leaves and the low soft laughter Of brooks that chuckle o'er old mossy jests And say them over to themselves, the nests Of squirrels and the holes the chipmunk digs, Where through the branches the slant rays Dapple with sunlight the leaf-matted ground, And the wind comes with blown vesture rustling after, And through the woven lattice of crisp sound A bird's song lightens like a maiden's face. "
92,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"O wildwood Helen, let them strive and fret, Those goggled men with their dissecting-knives! "
93,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"Let them in charnel-houses pass their lives And seek in death life's secret! And let Those hard-faced worldlings prematurely old Gnaw their thin lips with vain desire to get Portia's fair fame or Lesbia's carcanet, Or crown of Caesar or Catullus, Apicius' lampreys or Crassus' gold! For these consider many things--but yet By land nor sea They shall not find the way to Arcady, The old home of the awful heart-dear Mother, Whereto child-dreams and long rememberings lull us, Far from the cares that overlay and smother The memories of old woodland out-door mirth In the dim first life-burst centuries ago, The sense of the freedom and nearness of Earth-- Nay, this they shall not know; For who goes thither, Leaves all the cark and clutch of his soul behind, The doves defiled and the serpents shrined, The hates that wax and the hopes that wither; Nor does he journey, seeking where it be, But wakes and finds himself in Arcady. "
94,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"Hist! there's a stir in the brush. Was it a face through the leaves? Back of the laurels a skurry and rush Hillward, then silence except for the thrush That throws one song from the dark of the bush And is gone; and I plunge in the wood, and the swift soul cleaves Through the swirl and the flow of the leaves, As a swimmer stands with his white limbs bare to the sun For the space that a breath is held, and drops in the sea; And the undulant woodland folds round me, intimate, fluctuant, free, Like the clasp and the cling of waters, and the reach and the effort is done,-- There is only the glory of living, exultant to be. "
95,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"O goodly damp smell of the ground! O rough sweet bark of the trees! O clear sharp cracklings of sound! O life that's a-thrill and a-bound With the vigor of boyhood and morning, and the noontide's rapture of ease! Was there ever a weary heart in the world? A lag in the body's urge or a flag of the spirit's wings? Did a man's heart ever break For a lost hope's sake? For here there is lilt in the quiet and calm in the quiver of things. Ay, this old oak, gray-grown and knurled, Solemn and sturdy and big, Is as young of heart, as alert and elate in his rest, As the nuthatch there that clings to the tip of the twig And scolds at the wind that it buffets too rudely its nest. "
96,THE FAUN. A FRAGMENT.,"Oh, what is it breathes in the air? Oh, what is it touches my cheek? There's a sense of a presence that lurks in the branches. But where? Is it far, is it far to seek? "
97,A ROVER'S SONG.,A ROVER'S SONG. 
98,A ROVER'S SONG.,"Snowdrift of the mountains, Spindrift of the sea, We who down the border Rove from gloom to glee,-- "
99,A ROVER'S SONG.,"Snowdrift of the mountains, Spindrift of the sea, There be no such gypsies Over earth as we. "
100,A ROVER'S SONG.,"Snowdrift of the mountains, Spindrift of the sea, Let us part the treasure Of the world in three. "
101,A ROVER'S SONG.,"Snowdrift of the mountains, Spindrift of the sea, You shall keep your kingdoms; Joscelyn for me! "
102,DOWN THE SONGO.,DOWN THE SONGO. 
103,I.,I. 
104,I.,"Floating! Floating--and all the stillness waits And listens at the ivory gates, Full of a dim uncertain presage Of some strange, undelivered message. There is no sound save from the bush The alto of the shy wood-thrush, And ever and anon the dip Of a lazy oar. "
105,I.,"The rhythmic drowsiness keeps time To hazy subtleties of rhyme That seem to slip Through the lulled soul to seek the sleepy shore. The idle clouds go floating by; Above us sky, beneath us sky; The sun shines on us as we lie Floating. "
106,I.,"It is a dream. It is a dream, my love; see how The ripples quiver at the prow, And all the long reflections shake Unsteadily beneath the lake. The mists about the uplands show Dim violet towers that come and go. Phantasmagoric palaces Rise trembling there, As though one breath of waking weather Would crash their airy walls together With sudden stress, While silent detonations shook the air-- Vast fabrics toppling to the ground And vanishing without a sound. Ah, love, these are not what we deem; It is a dream. "
107,II.,II. 
108,II.,"Let us dream on, then,----dream and die Ere the dream pass. Let us for once, like idle flowers, Let slip the unregarded hours, Like the wise flowers that lie Unfretted by a feeble thought, Future and past alike forgot, Drinking the dew contentedly In the cool grass. "
109,III.,III. 
110,III.,"Look yonder where the clouds float; could we glide As they, across the sky's blue shoreless tide, What better were it than to dream Across yon lake and into this still stream? "
111,IV.,IV. 
112,IV.,"Trees and a glimpse of sky! And the slow river, quiet as a pool! And thou and I--and thou and I-- Kiss me! How soft the air is and how cool! "
113,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,THE WANDER-LOVERS. 
114,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Down the world with Marna! That's the life for me! Wandering with the wandering wind, Vagabond and unconfined! Roving with the roving rain Its unboundaried domain! Kith and kin of wander-kind, Children of the sea! "
115,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Petrels of the sea-drift! Swallows of the lea! Arabs of the whole wide girth Of the wind-encircled earth! In all climes we pitch our tents, Cronies of the elements, With the secret lords of birth Intimate and free. "
116,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"All the seaboard knows us From Fundy to the Keys; Every bend and every creek Of abundant Chesapeake; Ardise hills and Newport coves And the far-off orange groves, Where Floridian oceans break, Tropic tiger seas. "
117,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Down the world with Marna, Tarrying there and here! Just as much at home in Spain As in Tangier or Touraine! Shakespeare's Avon knows us well, And the crags of Neufchâtel; And the ancient Nile is fain Of our coming near. "
118,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Down the world with Marna, Daughter of the air! Marna of the subtle grace, And the vision in her face! Moving in the measures trod By the angels before God! With her sky-blue eyes amaze And her sea-blue hair! "
119,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Marna with the trees' life In her veins a-stir! Marna of the aspen heart Where the sudden quivers start! Quick-responsive, subtle, wild! Artless as an artless child, Spite of all her reach of art! Oh, to roam with her! "
120,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Marna with the wind's will, Daughter of the sea! Marna of the quick disdain, Starting at the dream of stain! At a smile with love aglow, At a frown a statued woe, Standing pinnacled in pain Till a kiss sets free! "
121,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Down the world with Marna, Daughter of the fire! Marna of the deathless hope, Still alert to win new scope Where the wings of life may spread For a flight unhazarded! Dreaming of the speech to cope With the heart's desire! "
122,THE WANDER-LOVERS.,"Marna of the far quest After the divine! Striving ever for some goal Past the blunder-god's control! Dreaming of potential years When no day shall dawn in fears! That's the Marna of my soul, Wander-bride of mine! "
123,DISCOVERY.,DISCOVERY. 
124,DISCOVERY.,"When the bugler morn shall wind his horn, And we wake to the wild to be, Shall we open our eyes on the selfsame skies And stare at the selfsame sea? O new, new day! though you bring no stay To the strain of the sameness grim, You are new, new, new--new through and through, And strange as a lawless dream. "
125,DISCOVERY.,"Will the driftwood float by the lonely boat And our prisoner hearts unbar, As it tells of the strand of an unseen land That lies not far, not far? O new, new hope! O sweep and scope Of the glad, unlying sea! You are new, new, new--with the promise true Of the dreamland isles to be. "
126,DISCOVERY.,"Will the land-birds fly across the sky, Though the land is not to see? Have they dipped and passed in the sea-line vast? Have we left the land a-lee? O new despair! I though the hopeless air Grow foul with the calm and grieves, You are new, new, new--and we cleave to you As a soul to its freedom cleaves. "
127,DISCOVERY.,"Does the falling night hide fiends to fight And phantoms to affray? What demons lurk in the grisly mirk, As the night-watch waits for day? O strange new gloom! we await the doom, And what doom none may deem; But it's new, new, new--and we'll sail it through, While the mocking sea-gulls scream. "
128,DISCOVERY.,"A light, a light, in the dead of night, That lifts and sinks in the waves! What folk are they who have kindled its ray,-- Men or the ghouls of graves? O new, new fear! near, near and near, And you bear us weal or woe! But you're new, new, new--so a cheer for you! And onward--friend or foe! "
129,DISCOVERY.,"Shall the lookout call from the foretop tall, ""Land, land!"" with a maddened scream, And the crew in glee from the taffrail see Where the island palm-trees dream? New heart, new eyes! For the morning skies Are a-chant with their green and gold! New, new, new, new--new through and through! New, new till the dawn is old! "
130,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER. 
131,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"The swarthy bee is a buccaneer, A burly velveted rover, Who loves the booming wind in his ear As he sails the seas of clover. "
132,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"A waif of the goblin pirate crew, With not a soul to deplore him, He steers for the open verge of blue With the filmy world before him. "
133,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,His flimsy sails abroad on the wind Are shivered with fairy thunder; On a line that sings to the light of his wings He makes for the lands of wonder. 
134,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He harries the ports of the Hollyhocks, And levies on poor Sweetbrier; He drinks the whitest wine of Phlox, And the Rose is his desire. "
135,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,He hangs in the Willows a night and a day; He rifles the Buckwheat patches; Then battens his store of pelf galore Under the tautest hatches. 
136,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He woos the Poppy and weds the Peach, Inveigles Daffodilly, And then like a tramp abandons each For the gorgeous Canada Lily. "
137,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"There's not a soul in the garden world But wishes the day were shorter, When Mariner B. puts out to sea With the wind in the proper quarter. "
138,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"Or, so they say! But I have my doubts; For the flowers are only human, And the valor and gold of a vagrant bold Were always dear to woman. "
139,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He dares to boast, along the coast, The beauty of Highland Heather,-- How he and she, with night on the sea, Lay out on the hills together. "
140,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He pilfers from every port of the wind, From April to golden autumn; But the thieving ways of his mortal days Are those his mother taught him. "
141,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"His morals are mixed, but his will is fixed; He prospers after his kind, And follows an instinct, compass-sure, The philosophers call blind. "
142,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"And that is why, when he comes to die, He'll have an easier sentence Than some one I know who thinks just so, And then leaves room for repentance. "
143,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He never could box the compass round; He doesn't know port from starboard; But he knows the gates of the Sundown Straits, Where the choicest goods are harbored. "
144,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He never could see the Rule of Three, But he knows a rule of thumb Better than Euclid's, better than yours, Or the teachers' yet to come. "
145,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,He knows the smell of the hydromel As if two and two were five; And hides it away for a year and a day In his own hexagonal hive. 
146,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"Out in the day, hap-hazard, alone, Booms the old vagrant hummer, With only his whim to pilot him Through the splendid vast of summer. "
147,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He steers and steers on the slant of the gale, Like the fiend or Vanderdecken; And there's never an unknown course to sail But his crazy log can reckon. "
148,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He drones along with his rough sea-song And the throat of a salty tar, This devil-may-care, till he makes his lair By the light of a yellow star. "
149,A MORE ANCIENT MARINER.,"He looks like a gentleman, lives like a lord, And works like a Trojan hero; Then loafs all winter upon his hoard, With the mercury at zero. "
150,A SONG BY THE SHORE.,A SONG BY THE SHORE. 
151,A SONG BY THE SHORE.,"""Lose and love"" is love's first art; So it was with thee and me, For I first beheld thy heart On the night I last saw thee. Pine-woods and mysteries! Sea-sands and sorrows! Hearts fluttered by a breeze That bodes dark morrows, morrows,-- Bodes dark morrows! "
152,A SONG BY THE SHORE.,"Moonlight in sweet overflow Poured upon the earth and sea! Lovelight with intenser glow In the deeps of thee and me! Clasped hands and silences! Hearts faint and throbbing! The weak wind sighing in the trees! The strong surf sobbing, sobbing,-- The strong surf sobbing! "
153,A HILL SONG.,A HILL SONG. 
154,A HILL SONG.,"Hills where once my love and I Let the hours go laughing by! All your woods and dales are sad,-- You have lost your Oread. Falling leaves! Silent woodlands! Half your loveliness is fled. Golden-rod, wither now! Winter winds, come hither now! All the summer joy is dead. "
155,A HILL SONG.,"There's a sense of something gone In the grass I linger on. There's an under-voice that grieves In the rustling of the leaves. Pine-clad peaks! Rushing waters! Glens where we were once so glad! There's a light passed from you, There's a joy outcast from you,-- You have lost your Oread. "
156,AT SEA.,AT SEA. 
157,AT SEA.,"As a brave man faces the foe, Alone against hundreds, and sees Death grin in his teeth, But, shutting his lips, fights on to the end Without speech, without hope, without flinching,-- So, silently, grimly, the steamer Lurches ahead through the night. "
158,AT SEA.,"A beacon-light far off, Twinkling across the waves like a star! But no star in the dark overhead! The splash of waters at the prow, and the evil light Of the death-fires flitting like will-o'-the-wisps beneath! And beyond Silence and night! "
159,AT SEA.,"I sit by the taffrail, Alone in the dark and the blown cold mist and the spray, Feeling myself swept on irresistibly, Sunk in the night and the sea, and made one with their footfall-less onrush, Letting myself be borne like a spar adrift Helplessly into the night. "
160,AT SEA.,"Without fear, without wish, Insensate save of a dull, crushed ache in my heart, Careless whither the steamer is going, Conscious only as in a dream of the wet and the dark And of a form that looms and fades indistinctly Everywhere out of the night. "
161,AT SEA.,"O love, how came I here? Shall I wake at thy side and smile at my dream? The dream that grips me so hard that I cannot wake nor stir! O love! O my own love, found but to be lost! My soul sends over the waters a wild inarticulate cry, Like a gull's scream heard in the night. "
162,AT SEA.,"The mist creeps closer. The beacon Vanishes astern. The sea's monotonous noises Lapse through the drizzle with a listless, subsiding cadence. And thou, O love, and the sea throb on in my brain together, While the steamer plunges along, Butting its way through the night. "
163,ISABEL.,ISABEL. 
164,ISABEL.,"In her body's perfect sweet Suppleness and languor meet,-- Arms that move like lapsing billows, Breasts that Love would make his pillows, Eyes where vision melts in bliss, Lips that ripen to a kiss. "

166,CONTEMPORARIES.,"""A barbered woman's man,""--yes, so He seemed to me a twelvemonth since; And so he may be--let it go-- Admit his flaws--we need not wince To find our noblest not all great. What of it? He is still the prince, And we the pages of his state. "
167,CONTEMPORARIES.,"The world applauds his words; his fame Is noised wherever knowledge be; Even the trader hears his name, As one far inland hears the sea; The lady quotes him to the beau Across a cup of Russian tea; They know him and they do not know. "
168,CONTEMPORARIES.,"I know him. In the nascent years Men's eyes shall see him as one crowned; His voice shall gather in their ears With each new age prophetic sound; And you and I and all the rest, Whose brows to-day are laurel-bound, Shall be but plumes upon his crest. "
169,CONTEMPORARIES.,"A year ago this man was poor,-- This Alfred whom the nations praise; He stood a beggar at my door For one mere word to help him raise From fainting limbs and shoulders bent The burden of the weary days; And I withheld it--and he went. "
170,CONTEMPORARIES.,"I knew him then, as I know now, Our largest heart, our loftiest mind; Yet for the curls upon his brow And for his lisp, I could not find The helping word, the cheering touch. Ah, to be just, as well as kind,-- It costs so little and so much! "
171,CONTEMPORARIES.,"It seemed unmanly in my sight That he, whose spirit was so strong To lead the blind world to the light, Should look so like the mincing throng Who advertise the tailor's art. It angered me--I did him wrong-- I grudged my groat and shut my heart. "
172,CONTEMPORARIES.,"I might have been the prophet's friend, Helped him who is to help the world! Now, when the striving is at end, The reek-stained battle-banners furled, And the age hears its muster-call, Then I, because his hair was curled, I shall have lost my chance--that's all. "
173,THE TWO BOBBIES.,THE TWO BOBBIES.

176,THE TWO BOBBIES.,"Poor North Bobbie was the bad boy,-- Bad, bad, bad, bad Bobbie Burns! Loved and made the world his lover, Kissed and barleycomed by turns. "
177,THE TWO BOBBIES.,"London's dweller, child of wisdom, Kept his counsel, took his toll; Ayrshire's vagrant paid the piper, Lost the game--God save his soul! "
178,THE TWO BOBBIES.,"Bobbie Burns and Bobbie Browning, What's the difference, you see? Bob the lover, Bob the lawyer; Bobbie is the boy for me! "

185,THE KAVANAGH.,THE KAVANAGH. 
186,THE KAVANAGH.,"A stone jug and a pewter mug, And a table set for three! A jug and a mug at every place, And a biscuit or two with Brie! Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn, And a cheese like crusted foam! The Kavanagh receives to-night! McMurrough is at home! "
187,THE KAVANAGH.,"We three and the barley-bree! And a health to the one away, Who drifts down careless Italy, God's wanderer and estray! For friends are more than Arno's store Of garnered charm, and he Were blither with us here the night Than Titian bids him be. "
188,THE KAVANAGH.,"Throw ope the window to the stars, And let the warm night in! Who knows what revelry in Mars May rhyme with rouse akin? Fill up and drain the loving cup And leave no drop to waste! The moon looks in to see what's up-- Begad, she'd like a taste! "
189,THE KAVANAGH.,"What odds if Leinster's kingly roll Be now an idle thing? The world is his who takes his toll, A vagrant or a king. What though the crown be melted down, And the heir a gypsy roam? The Kavanagh receives to-night! McMurrough is at home! "
190,THE KAVANAGH.,"We three and the barley-bree! And the moonlight on the floor! Who were a man to do with less? What emperor has more? Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn, And three stout hearts to drain A slanter to the truth in the heart of youth And the joy of the love of men. "

195,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,I've aboard a hundred messmates Better than these 'long-shore knaves. There is wreckage on the shallows; It's the open sea that saves. 
196,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,"Hark, lad, dost not hear it calling? That's the voice thy father knew, When he took the King's good cutlass In his grip, and fought it through. "
197,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,"Who would palter at press-money When he heard that sea-cry vast? That's the call makes lords of lubbers, When they ship before the mast. "
198,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,"Let thy cronies of the tavern Keep their kisses bought with gold; On the high seas there are regions Where the heart is never old, "
199,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,"Where the great winds every morning Sweep the sea-floor clean and white, And upon the steel-blue arches Burnish the great stars of night; "
200,A CAPTAIN OF THE PRESS-GANG.,"There the open hand will lose not, Nor the loosened tongue betray. Signed, and with our sailing orders, We will clear before the day; "

204,THE BUCCANEERS.,"No long caresses give us ease, No lazy languors warm, We seize our mates as the sea-gulls seize, And leave them to the storm. But in the bridal halls of gloom The couch is stern and strait; For us the marriage rite of Doom, The nuptial joy of Fate. "
205,THE BUCCANEERS.,"Wine for the weaklings of the town, Their lucky toasts to drain! Our skoal for them whose star goes down, Our drink the drink of men! No Bacchic ivy for our brows! Like vikings, we await The grim, ungarlanded carouse We keep to-night with Fate. "
206,THE BUCCANEERS.,"Ho, gamesters of the pampered court! What stakes are those at strife? Your thousands are but paltry sport To them that play for life. You risk doubloons, and hold your breath. Win groats, and wax elate; But we throw loaded dice with Death, And call the turn on Fate. "
207,THE BUCCANEERS.,"The kings of earth are crowned with care, Their poets wail and sigh; Our music is to do and dare, Our empire is to die. Against the storm we fling our glee And shout, till Time abate The exultation of the sea, The fearful joy of Fate. "

It is not. That is the Earth. See, I will stretch my hand Between it and the sun; the passing shadow Gives its poor dwellers a glacial period. Let it but stand an hour, it would dissolve, Intangible as the color of the wine. There, throw it away now! Lift it from the sweet Enveloping flood it has enjoyed so well;"" (He smiled as only those who live can smile) ""Its time is done, its revelry complete, Its being accomplished. Let us drink again.""
