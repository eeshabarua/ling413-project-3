55,,What little is known of the life of Samuel Cobb (1675-1713) may be found
56,,in the brief article in the _Dictionary of National Biography_ by W.P.
57,,"Courtney. He was born in London, and educated at Christ's Hospital and"
58,,"at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degrees of B.A.,"
59,,"1698, and M.A., 1702. He was appointed ""under grammar master"" at"
60,,Christ's Hospital in 1702 and continued his connection with this school
61,,"until his early death. He had a reputation for wit and learning, and"
62,,also for imbibing somewhat too freely. In his poetry he especially
63,,"cultivated the style of the free Pindaric ode, a predilection which won"
64,,him a mention without honor in Johnson's life of Pope (_Lives of the
65,,"Poets_, ed. Birkbeck Hill, III, 227). Even the heroic couplets of his"
66,,"poem on ""Poetry"" aim rather at pseudo-Pindaric diffuseness than at"
67,,epigrammatic concentration of statement. As a critic Cobb deserves
68,,"attention in spite of his mediocrity, or even because of it. He helps to"
69,,"fill out the picture of the literary London of his time, and his"
70,,opinions and tastes provide valuable side-lights on such greater men as
71,,"Dennis, Addison, and Pope. ""Of Poetry"" belongs to the prolific literary"
72,,"type of ""progress poems,"" in which the modern student finds illuminating"
73,,statements as to how the eighteenth century surveyed and evaluated past
74,,literary traditions. The list of Cobb's publications in the _Cambridge
75,,Bibliography_ suggests that he enjoyed some degree of popularity. His
76,,"volume, _Poems on Several Occasions_, was published in 1707, and"
77,,reprinted in enlarged form in 1709 and 1710. The reproduction herewith
78,,"of the Preface ""On Criticism"" and the versified discourse ""Of Poetry"" is"
79,,"from a copy of the 1707 edition in the Newberry Library, in Chicago."

95,"SIR,","SIR,"
96,"SIR,",
97,"SIR,",_The_ Muses _are said to be the Daughters of Memory: A Poet therefore
98,"SIR,","must lay down his Title to their Favour, who can be forgetful of a"
99,"SIR,","Friend, like You, whose polite Knowledge, instructive Conversation, and"
100,"SIR,","particulur Generosity to my self, have left such strong Impressions upon"
101,"SIR,","my Mind, as defy the Power of Absence to remove them. I scarce believe"
102,"SIR,","Death it self can blot out an_ Idea _so firmly imprinted. The Soul, when"
103,"SIR,","it leaves this earthly Habitation, and has no more Use for those"
104,"SIR,","Vertues, which were serviceable in the Conduct of human Life, such as_"
105,"SIR,","Temperance, Fortitude _and the like, will certainly carry_ Love _and_"
106,"SIR,",Gratitude _along with it to Heaven. This may suffice to let the World
107,"SIR,",know what Obligations you have laid upon me.
108,"SIR,",
109,"SIR,","By this Letter (the room of which, for your sake I could willingly have"
110,"SIR,","supply'd) you will plainly see, that no Place, however remote, is able"
111,"SIR,","to secure you from the Zeal of a_ Friend, _and the Vanity of a_ Poet."
112,"SIR,",
113,"SIR,",
114,"SIR,","For tho' retiring to the _Western Isles_,"
115,"SIR,","At the long Distance of five thousand Miles,"
116,"SIR,","You've chang'd _dear London_ for your Native Seat,"
117,"SIR,",And think _Barbadoes_ is a safe Retreat;
118,"SIR,",You highly err: Nor is the _Wat'ry Fence_
119,"SIR,",Sufficient Guard against Impertinence.
120,"SIR,","The _Muse_, which smiles on jingling Bards, like Me,"
121,"SIR,",Has always Winds to waft her o'er the Sea.
122,"SIR,","Blow on, ye Winds, and o'er th' _Atlantick Main_,"
123,"SIR,",Bear to my Gen'rous Friend this thankful Strain.
124,"SIR,",
125,"SIR,","_You see, Sir, I have not left off that rhyming Trick of Youth; but"
126,"SIR,","knowing You to be a Gentleman who loves Variety in every thing, I"
127,"SIR,",thought it would not be ungrateful if I checquer'd my Prose with a
128,"SIR,",little Verse._
129,"SIR,",
130,"SIR,","_After this Preamble, it is presum'd, that one who lives on the Other"
131,"SIR,","side of the Globe, will expect by every Pacquet-boat to know what is"
132,"SIR,","done on This. Since Your Departure, Affairs have had a surprizing Turn"
133,"SIR,","every where, and particularly in_ Italy; _which Success of our Armies"
134,"SIR,","and Allies abroad, have given a manifest Proof of our wise Counsels at"
135,"SIR,",home.--Parties still run between_ High _and_ Low. _I shall make no
136,"SIR,","Remarks on either; thinking it always more prudent, as well as more"
137,"SIR,","safe, to live peaceably under the Government in which I was born, rather"
138,"SIR,",than peevishly to quarrel with it._
139,"SIR,",
140,"SIR,","_But You will cry,_ Who expects any thing from the Politicks of a Poet?"
141,"SIR,",How goes the State of _Parnassus_? What has the Battle of _Ramillies_
142,"SIR,","produc'd? _What Battles generally do; bad Poets, and worse Criticks. I"
143,"SIR,","could not perswade my self to attempt any thing above six Lines, which"
144,"SIR,","had not been made, were it not at the Request of a Musical Gentleman."
145,"SIR,",You will look upon them with the same Countenance you us'd to do on
146,"SIR,",things of a larger Size._
147,"SIR,",
148,"SIR,","Born to surprize the World, and teach the Great"
149,"SIR,","The slippery Danger of exalted State,"
150,"SIR,",Victorious _Marlbr√¥_ to _Ramilly_ flies;
151,"SIR,",Arm'd with new Lightning from bright _ANNA's_ Eyes.
152,"SIR,","Wonders like These, no former Age has seen;"
153,"SIR,","Subjects are _Heroes_, where a Saint's the _QUEEN_."
154,"SIR,",
155,"SIR,","_Mr._ Congreve _has given the World an Ode, and prefix'd to it a"
156,"SIR,","Discourse on the_ Pindaric Verse, _of which more, when I come to speak"
157,"SIR,","on the same Argument: There are several others on that Subject, and some"
158,"SIR,","which will bear the Test; one particularly, written in imitation of the"
159,"SIR,",Style of_ Spencer; _and goes under the Name of Mr._ Prior; _I have not
160,"SIR,","read it through, but_ ex pede Herculem. _He is a Gentleman who cannot"
161,"SIR,","write ill. Yet some of our_ Criticks _have fell upon it, as the Viper"
162,"SIR,","did on the File, to the detriment of their Teeth. So that Criticism,"
163,"SIR,","which was formerly the Art of judging well, is now become the pure"
164,"SIR,","Effect of Spleen, Passion and Self-conceit. Nothing is perfect in every"
165,"SIR,","Part. He that expects to see any thing so, must have patience till_"
166,"SIR,","Dooms-day. _The Worship we pay to our own Opinion, generally leads its"
167,"SIR,",to the Contempt of another's. This blind Idolatry of_ Self _is the
168,"SIR,",Mother of Errour; and this begets a secret Vanity in our_ Modern
169,"SIR,","Censurers, _who, when they please to_ think a Meaning _for an Author,"
170,"SIR,",would thereby insinuate how much his Judgment is inferiour to their
171,"SIR,","inlighten'd Sagacity. When, perhaps, the Failings they expose are a"
172,"SIR,",plain Evidence of their own Blindness._
173,"SIR,",
174,"SIR,","For to display our Candour and our Sence,"
175,"SIR,",Is to discover some deep _Excellence_.
176,"SIR,","The Critick's faulty, while the Poet's free;"
177,"SIR,","They raise the _Mole hill, who want Eyes to see_."
178,"SIR,",
179,"SIR,",_Excrescences are easily perceiv'd by an ordinary Eye; but it requires
180,"SIR,",the Penetration of a_ Lynceus _to discern the Depth of a good Poem; the
181,"SIR,",secret Artfulness and Contrivance of it being conceal'd from a Vulgar
182,"SIR,",Apprehension._
183,"SIR,",
184,"SIR,",_I remember somewhere an Observation of St._ Evremont _(an Author whom
185,"SIR,","you us'd to praise, and whom therefore I admire) that some Persons, who"
186,"SIR,","would be Poets, which they cannot be, become Criticks which they can be."
187,"SIR,","The censorious Grin, and the loud Laugh, are common and easy things,"
188,"SIR,","according to_ Juvenal; _and according to_ Scripture, _the Marks of a_"
189,"SIR,","Fool. _These Men are certainly in a deplorable Condition, who cannot be"
190,"SIR,","witty, but at another's Expence, and who take an unnatural kind of"
191,"SIR,",Pleasure in being uneasy at their Own._
192,"SIR,",
193,"SIR,","Rules they can write, but, like the _College Tribe_,"
194,"SIR,",Take not that Physick which their Rules prescribe.
195,"SIR,","I scorn to praise a plodding, formal Fool,"
196,"SIR,","_Insipidly_ correct, and _dull_ by Rule:"
197,"SIR,","_Homer_, with all his _Nodding_, I would chuse,"
198,"SIR,",Before the more exact _Sicilian_ Muse.
199,"SIR,","Who'd not be _Dryden_; tho' his Faults are great,"
200,"SIR,",Sooner than our Laborious _Laureat_?
201,"SIR,","Not but a decent Neatness, I confess,"
202,"SIR,","In _Writing_ is requir'd, as well as _Dress_."
203,"SIR,",Yet still in both the _unaffected Air_
204,"SIR,",Will always please the _Witty_ and the _Fair_.
205,"SIR,",
206,"SIR,",_I would not here be thought to be a Patron of slovenly Negligence; for
207,"SIR,",there is nothing which breeds a greater Aversion in Men of a_ Delicate
208,"SIR,","Taste. _Yet you know, Sir, that, after all our Care and Caution, the"
209,"SIR,",Weakness of our Nature will eternally mix it self in every thing we
210,"SIR,","write; and an over curious Study of being correct, enervates the Vigour"
211,"SIR,","of the Mind, slackens the Spirits, and cramps the Genius of a_ Free"
212,"SIR,","Writer. _He who creeps by the Shore, may shelter himself from a Storm,"
213,"SIR,","but likely to make very few Discoveries: And the cautious Writer, who is"
214,"SIR,","timorous of disobliging the captious Reader, may produce you true"
215,"SIR,","Grammar, and unexceptionable_ Prosodia, _but most stupid Poetry._"
216,"SIR,",
217,"SIR,","In vitium culp√¶ ducit fuga, si caret arte."
218,"SIR,",
219,"SIR,","_A slavish Fear of committing an Oversight, betrays a Man to more"
220,"SIR,","inextricable Errours, than the Boldness of an enterprizing Author, whose"
221,"SIR,",artful Carelesness is more instructive and delightful than all the Pains
222,"SIR,",and Sweat of the Poring and Bookish Critick._
223,"SIR,",
224,"SIR,","_Some Failings, like Moles in a beautiful Countenance, take nothing from"
225,"SIR,","the Charms of a happy Composure, but rather heighten and improve their"
226,"SIR,",Value. Were our modern Reflecters Masters of more Humanity than
227,"SIR,","Learning, and of more Discernment than both, the Authors of the Past and"
228,"SIR,","Present Ages, would have no reason to complain of Injustice; nor would"
229,"SIR,","that Reflection be cast upon the_ best-natur'd Nation _in the World,"
230,"SIR,","that, when rude and ignorant, we were unhospitable to Strangers, and"
231,"SIR,","now, being civiliz'd, we expend our Barbarity on one another_. Homer"
232,"SIR,","_would not be so much the Ridicule of our_ Beaux Esprits; _when, with"
233,"SIR,","all his Sleepiness, he is propos'd as the most exquisite Pattern of"
234,"SIR,","Heroic Writing, by the Greatest of Philosophers, and the Best of Judges."
235,"SIR,",Nor is_ Longinus _behind hand with_ Aristotle _in his Character of the
236,"SIR,","same Author, when he tells us that the Greatness of_ Homer's _Soul"
237,"SIR,",look'd above little Trifles (which are Faults in meaner Capacities) and
238,"SIR,",hurry'd on to his Subject with a Freedom of Spirit peculiar to himself.
239,"SIR,","A Racer at_ New-market _or the_ Downs, _which has been fed and drest,"
240,"SIR,","and with the nicest Caution prepared for the Course, will stumble"
241,"SIR,",perhaps at a little Hillock; while the Wings of_ Pegasus _bear him o'er
242,"SIR,","Hills and Mountains,_"
243,"SIR,",
244,"SIR,",Sub pedibusq; videt nubes & sydera--
245,"SIR,",
246,"SIR,",_Such was the Soul of_ Homer: _who is more justly admir'd by those who
247,"SIR,","understand him, than he is derided by the Ignorant: Whose Writings"
248,"SIR,","partake as much of that Spirit, as he attributes to the Actions of his_"
249,"SIR,","Heroes; _and whose Blindness is more truly chargeable on his_ Criticks,"
250,"SIR,","_than on_ Himself: _who, as he wrote without a Rule, was himself a Rule"
251,"SIR,",to succeeding Ages. Who as much deserves that Commendation which_
252,"SIR,","Alcibiades _gave to_ Socrates, _when he compar'd him to the Statues of"
253,"SIR,","the_ Sileni, _which to look upon, had nothing beautiful and ornamental;"
254,"SIR,","but open them, and there you might discover the Images of all the Gods"
255,"SIR,",and Goddesses._
256,"SIR,",
257,"SIR,","_Who knows the secret Springs of the Soul, and those sudden Emotions,"
258,"SIR,","which excite illustrious Men, to act and speak out of the_ Common Road?"
259,"SIR,",_They seem irregular to Us by reason of the Fondness and Bigottry we pay
260,"SIR,","to_ Custom, _which is no Standard to the Brave and the Wise. The Rules"
261,"SIR,","we receive in our first Education, are laid down with this Purpose, to"
262,"SIR,",restrain the_ Mind; _which by reason of the Tenderness of our Age and
263,"SIR,","the ungovernable Disposition of Young Nature, is apt to start out into"
264,"SIR,","Excess and Extravagance. But when Time has ripen'd us, and Observation"
265,"SIR,","has fortify'd the Soul, we ought to lay aside those common Rules with"
266,"SIR,","our Leading strings; and exercise our Reason with a free, generous and"
267,"SIR,",manly Spirit. Thus a_ Good Poet _should make use of a Discretionary
268,"SIR,","Command; like a_ Good General, _who may rightly wave the vulgar Precepts"
269,"SIR,","of the Military School (which may confine an ordinary Capacity, and curb"
270,"SIR,","the Rash and Daring) if by a new and surprizing Method of Conduct, he"
271,"SIR,",find out an uncommon Way to Glory and Success._
272,"SIR,",
273,"SIR,","Bocalin, _the_ Italian _Wit, among his other odd Advertisements, has"
274,"SIR,","this remarkable one, which is parallel to the present Discourse. When_"
275,"SIR,","Tasso _(says he) had presented_ Apollo _with his_ Poem, _call'd_"
276,"SIR,","Giurasalemme Liberata; _the_ Reformer _of the_ Delphic Library, _to"
277,"SIR,","whose Perusal it was committed, found fault with it, because it was not"
278,"SIR,",written according to the Rules of_ Aristotle; _which affront being
279,"SIR,","complain'd of,_ Apollo _was highly incens'd, and chid_ Aristotle _for"
280,"SIR,",his Presumption in daring to prescribe Laws and Rules to the high
281,"SIR,","Conceptions of the_ Virtuosi, _whose Liberty of Writing and Inventing,"
282,"SIR,",enrich'd the Schools and Libraries with gallant Composures; and to
283,"SIR,","enslave the Wits of Learned Men, was to rob the World of those alluring"
284,"SIR,","Charms which daily flow'd from the Productions of Poets, who follow the"
285,"SIR,",Dint of their own unbounded Imagination. You will find the rest in the
286,"SIR,",28th Advertisement._
287,"SIR,",
288,"SIR,","_The Moral is instructive; because to judge well and candidly, we must"
289,"SIR,","wean our selves from a slavish Bigotry to the Ancients. For, tho'_ Homer"
290,"SIR,","_and_ Virgil, Pindar _and_ Horace _be laid before us as Examples of"
291,"SIR,","exquisite Writing in the Heroic and Lyric Kind, yet, either thro' the"
292,"SIR,","Distance of Time, or Diversity of Customs, we can no more expect to find"
293,"SIR,","like Capacities, than like Complexions. Let a Man follow the Talent that"
294,"SIR,","Nature has furnish'd him with, and his own Observation has improv'd, we"
295,"SIR,","may hope to see Inventions in all Arts, which may dispute Superiority"
296,"SIR,",with the best of the_ Athenian _and_ Roman _Excellencies_.
297,"SIR,",
298,"SIR,",Nec minimum meru√™re decus vestigia Gr√¶ca
299,"SIR,",Ausi deserere.----
300,"SIR,",
301,"SIR,","_It is another Rule of the same Gentleman, that we should attempt"
302,"SIR,",nothing beyond our Strength: There are some modern_ Milo's _who have
303,"SIR,",been wedg'd in that Timber which they strove to rend. Some have fail'd
304,"SIR,","in the Lyric Way who have been excellent in the Dramatic. And, Sir,"
305,"SIR,",would you not think a Physician would gain more Profit and Reputation
306,"SIR,","by_ Hippocrates _and_ Galen _well-studied, than by_ Homer _and_ Virgil"
307,"SIR,",_ill-copied?_
308,"SIR,",
309,"SIR,","Horace, _who was as great a Master of Judgment, as he was an Instance of"
310,"SIR,","Wit, would have laid the Errours of an establish'd Writer on a"
311,"SIR,","pardonable Want of Care, or excus'd them by the Infirmity of Human"
312,"SIR,","Nature; he would have wondred at the corrupt Palates now a-days, who"
313,"SIR,","quarrel with their Meat, when the Fault is in their Taste. To reform"
314,"SIR,","which, if our Moderns would lay aside the malicious Grin and drolling"
315,"SIR,","Sneer, the Passions and Prejudices to Persons and Circumstances, we"
316,"SIR,","should have better Poems, and juster Criticisms. Nothing casts a greater"
317,"SIR,",Cloud on the Judgment than the Inclination (or rather Resolution) to
318,"SIR,","praise or condemn, before we see the Object. The Rich and the Great lay"
319,"SIR,","a Trap for Fame, and have always a numerous Crowd of servile Dependants,"
320,"SIR,","to clap their Play, or admire their Poem._"
321,"SIR,",
322,"SIR,","For noble Scriblers are with Flattery fed,"
323,"SIR,",And none dare tell their Fault who eat their Bread.

333,"SIR,",
334,"SIR,",_To conquer Prejudice is the part of a Philosopher; and to discern a
335,"SIR,",Beauty is an Argument of good Sense and Sagacity; and to find a Fault

337,"SIR,",
338,"SIR,","_Who then is this Critick? You will find him in_ Quintilius Varus, _of_"
339,"SIR,","Cremona, _who when any Author shew'd him his Composure, laid aside the_"

343,"SIR,","_Such is the Critick I would find, and such would I prove my self to"

346,"SIR,","Value of their Judgment, by dashing it with some splenetick Reflections."
347,"SIR,","Like a certain Nobleman mention'd by my Lord_ Verulam, _who when he"

362,"SIR,","Bibliotheque Choisie, _Tom._ 9. _p._ 328.) _commends St._ Evremont's"
363,"SIR,","_Discourses on_ Salust _and_ Tacitus, _as also his Judgment on the"

365,"SIR,","of Antiquity after his Method, which would invite our Polite Gentlemen"
366,"SIR,","to study it with a greater Appetite. Whereas their Manner of Writing,"
367,"SIR,","which takes Notice only of Words, Customs, and chiefly Chronology, with"
368,"SIR,","a blind Admiration of all they read, is unpleasant to a fine Genius, and"

371,"SIR,","_I shall say no more at present on this Head, but proceed to give you an"

375,"SIR,","rather err with Mr._ Cowley, _who shew'd us the Way, than be flat and in"

377,"SIR,",
378,"SIR,","_Mr._ Congreve, _an ingenious Gentleman, has affirm'd, I think too"
379,"SIR,","hastily, that in each particular Ode the Stanza's are alike, whereas the"

381,"SIR,",of Lines._
382,"SIR,",
383,"SIR,","_The Pacquet-boat is just going off, I am afraid of missing Tide. You"
