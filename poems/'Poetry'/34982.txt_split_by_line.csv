138,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,To trace down your ancestors' name;

140,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,"Where the winds sweep over the plains,"

151,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,Re-echo their laughter and glee.
152,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,
153,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,In the East ye build up great mansions
154,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,"And sky-scrapers gaunt and high,"
155,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,That shut out the glory and grandeur
156,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,Of the infinite tender sky;

192,THE DELUGE,(A Berthold Indian Legend)
193,THE DELUGE,
194,THE DELUGE,
195,THE DELUGE,"Long ago, yes, oh, so long since,--"
196,THE DELUGE,"When the world was young and fair,"
197,THE DELUGE,All the animals were friendly;
198,THE DELUGE,E'en the bison and the bear
199,THE DELUGE,"Aided man with all their cunning,"
200,THE DELUGE,"Helped him with their counsels grave,"
201,THE DELUGE,Helped him as the gods alone can--
202,THE DELUGE,Made him wise and strong and brave.
203,THE DELUGE,And the flowers on the prairies
204,THE DELUGE,"Blossomed ever, shy and sweet,"
205,THE DELUGE,For the land of the Dakotas
206,THE DELUGE,"Knew not frost, nor killing heat."
207,THE DELUGE,
208,THE DELUGE,"But there lived a dread god, North Wind,"
209,THE DELUGE,"Cruel was he, with heart of stone,"
210,THE DELUGE,"Feared of all and loved by no one,"
211,THE DELUGE,Living to himself alone
212,THE DELUGE,"In the land of snow and blizzard,"
213,THE DELUGE,"In the land of deadening cold,"
214,THE DELUGE,"Plotting ever some new mischief,"
215,THE DELUGE,"Some new ravage, cruel and bold."
216,THE DELUGE,And one day this mighty North Wind
217,THE DELUGE,"Left his throne of ice and snow,"
218,THE DELUGE,"In the cold, far distant northland"
219,THE DELUGE,Where the wriggling ice-worms glow;
220,THE DELUGE,"Southward came he, and the flowers"
221,THE DELUGE,"Bent their lovely heads in death,"
222,THE DELUGE,For from out his icy nostrils
223,THE DELUGE,Came an all-destroying breath.--
224,THE DELUGE,"At the mighty, stately forests"
225,THE DELUGE,"Angrily his teeth he gnashed,"
226,THE DELUGE,With one mighty blow he felled them
227,THE DELUGE,And with chains the rivers lashed;
228,THE DELUGE,"Ceased their laughter and their murmur,"
229,THE DELUGE,Ceased their sweet life-giving flow.--
230,THE DELUGE,All the birds and beasts in terror
231,THE DELUGE,"Fled, and knew not where to go;"
232,THE DELUGE,"Food they found not, and no shelter,"
233,THE DELUGE,"Dying were the mortals all,"
234,THE DELUGE,And a slow relentless snow shroud
235,THE DELUGE,Draped the earth as with a pall.--
236,THE DELUGE,Death supreme reigned; loud the North Wind
237,THE DELUGE,Roared defiance to the gods!--
238,THE DELUGE,Birds and beasts and man in terror
239,THE DELUGE,"Fled, and, dying, called the gods"
240,THE DELUGE,"To avenge their death and suffering,"
241,THE DELUGE,To unite them one and all
242,THE DELUGE,"In the holy cause of vengeance,"
243,THE DELUGE,To secure the North Wind's fall.--
244,THE DELUGE,"And the South Wind, fairest maiden"
245,THE DELUGE,"Of the gods, took up their cause;"
246,THE DELUGE,"Girded now herself for battle,"
247,THE DELUGE,And after a moment's pause
248,THE DELUGE,"Called unto her loyal brothers,"
249,THE DELUGE,"The strong East Wind, and the West,"
250,THE DELUGE,"""Help revenge the suffering mortals""--"
251,THE DELUGE,And they granted her request.
252,THE DELUGE,
253,THE DELUGE,Strong the fight raged in Dakota
254,THE DELUGE,"'Twixt the North Wind and his foes,"
255,THE DELUGE,"Now one side yields, now the other,"
256,THE DELUGE,Fierce and loud the tempest blows;--
257,THE DELUGE,Savagely the monster charges
258,THE DELUGE,Grappling with his unseen foes
259,THE DELUGE,"While a wild, chaotic blizzard,"
260,THE DELUGE,"Such as ne'er was seen, arose,"
261,THE DELUGE,"Hiding all within its fury,"
262,THE DELUGE,"Made the daylight dark as night,"
263,THE DELUGE,For the very gods were grappling
264,THE DELUGE,In a last terrific fight.--
265,THE DELUGE,
266,THE DELUGE,Ages long the battle lasted--
267,THE DELUGE,"Then the maiden fair and lovely,"

750,MEN ARE THREE,As we travel along life's way;
751,MEN ARE THREE,And some are surly and some are grave
752,MEN ARE THREE,And others are jolly and gay.
753,MEN ARE THREE,"And some folks are short, while others are tall,"
754,MEN ARE THREE,Still others are skinny and thin--
755,MEN ARE THREE,"And some skip along, a-humming a song,"
756,MEN ARE THREE,But others are simply all in.
757,MEN ARE THREE,"But where'er they come from, or whither they go,"
758,MEN ARE THREE,"We pigeon-hole each of them so,"

761,MEN ARE THREE,
762,MEN ARE THREE,"There's the man or the woman, the boy or the girl,"
763,MEN ARE THREE,That's always a-wishing a share
764,MEN ARE THREE,"In somebody's fortune, or somebody's fame,"
765,MEN ARE THREE,"Yes, they wish for the moon 'way up there.--"
766,MEN ARE THREE,Then there's that group of persons
767,MEN ARE THREE,"Who talk, talk, and talk,"
768,MEN ARE THREE,You simply don't know what they say--
769,MEN ARE THREE,"From morning till night they keep talking away,"
770,MEN ARE THREE,And the night is like unto the day.--
771,MEN ARE THREE,"But quietly along, on the very same road,"
772,MEN ARE THREE,"Walk others, with little to say,"
773,MEN ARE THREE,"And if they have wishes (What mortals have not?),"
774,MEN ARE THREE,They put them discreetly away.
775,MEN ARE THREE,"They're the workers, the lifters of burdens,--who dare"
776,MEN ARE THREE,"To fight for the right if need be,"
777,MEN ARE THREE,Alone 'gainst a world--
778,MEN ARE THREE,And defiance they hurl
779,MEN ARE THREE,To all tyrants wherever they be.

781,MEN ARE THREE,"You have met these three classes of people, I'm sure,"
782,MEN ARE THREE,As you've traveled adown life's way--
783,MEN ARE THREE,"The folks with their wish-bone enormously grown,"
784,MEN ARE THREE,"And the ""jaw-bones,"" who talk all the day.--"
785,MEN ARE THREE,"And I know you have shunned them,"
786,MEN ARE THREE,As others have done
787,MEN ARE THREE,"From the day that time began,"
788,MEN ARE THREE,"But you've hailed with delight,"
