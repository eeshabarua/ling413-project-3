65,RESURGAM.,"Swift pass the hours, or lengthened by our hearts"
66,RESURGAM.,"Uncertain measurement of time,"
67,RESURGAM.,"And when we dream the year has just awoke,"
68,RESURGAM.,We wake to find her in her prime.
69,RESURGAM.,
70,RESURGAM.,"We sadden with the dying Autumn leaves,"
71,RESURGAM.,Yet falling seeds their promise bring;
72,RESURGAM.,Through long dark Winter days we only wait
73,RESURGAM.,A resurrection in the coming Spring.
74,RESURGAM.,
75,RESURGAM.,Within each hour the precious minutes lie
76,RESURGAM.,"Like seeds awaiting Spring's first breath,"
77,RESURGAM.,God's harvest-time shall show us if they bear
78,RESURGAM.,The flowers of life or death.

114,MARCH VIOLETS.,"This busy, dusty wind that blows"
115,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Along the cruel streets,"
116,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Right to the heart of violets goes,"
117,MARCH VIOLETS.,And robs them of their sweets.
118,MARCH VIOLETS.,And as along the cruel street
119,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The keen wind robs the flowers,"
120,MARCH VIOLETS.,So the cold kindness that we meet
121,MARCH VIOLETS.,Blights these poor hearts of ours.
122,MARCH VIOLETS.,
123,MARCH VIOLETS.,"But if you tend with warmth, you know,"
124,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Your violets, they give"
125,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Sweet scent again, as if to show"
126,MARCH VIOLETS.,How glad they are to live.
127,MARCH VIOLETS.,We think if some one loved us too
128,MARCH VIOLETS.,Our hearts would break to prove
129,MARCH VIOLETS.,"By all that we could say or do,"
130,MARCH VIOLETS.,How glad we were to love!

138,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep,"
139,MARCH VIOLETS.,"A restless presence stirring with the light,"
140,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The cry of waters where the snow was white,"
141,MARCH VIOLETS.,A violet's whisper where dead leaves lay deep;
142,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The dim wood's music makes a sudden leap,"
143,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Broken notes, blending in a wild delight,"
144,MARCH VIOLETS.,And lo! the whole world changes in our sight.
145,MARCH VIOLETS.,Promise is ended--we must turn and reap
146,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Fulfilment, for the Spring with all her wealth"
147,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Is with us, and compels us to her will."
148,MARCH VIOLETS.,Yet if the sun-dawn we should shun by stealth
149,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Yearning for shadows and the darkened hours,"
150,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Sweet Lord, be pitiful, remembering still"
151,MARCH VIOLETS.,One lieth low beneath the budding flowers.

161,MARCH VIOLETS.,"My days grow old, and I watch no more"
162,MARCH VIOLETS.,The cowslips gold and the may-buds white.
163,MARCH VIOLETS.,Primroses nestle beneath the hedge
164,MARCH VIOLETS.,Where we kissed and wept and said good-bye--
165,MARCH VIOLETS.,"For twenty years I have watched them bud,"
166,MARCH VIOLETS.,For twenty years I have seen them die.
167,MARCH VIOLETS.,
168,MARCH VIOLETS.,Yet now that the Spring once more has turned
169,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The sea to silver, the earth to gold,"
170,MARCH VIOLETS.,"I shall watch no more from the primrose lane,"
171,MARCH VIOLETS.,Where I waited and watched in the days of old.
172,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Yet the children weave me their daisy chains,"
173,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The woodland music is sweet and clear,"
174,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Though the footsteps have wandered beyond recall,"
175,MARCH VIOLETS.,That I watched and waited so long to hear!

185,MARCH VIOLETS.,"So should true lovers ever be,"
186,MARCH VIOLETS.,Together ever--ever free.
187,MARCH VIOLETS.,
188,MARCH VIOLETS.,"A chain upon the white swan's neck,"
189,MARCH VIOLETS.,What were it good for--save to break?
190,MARCH VIOLETS.,And swans who wear and break a chain
191,MARCH VIOLETS.,Swim never side by side again.

198,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The woods are green and life is good,"
199,MARCH VIOLETS.,Come out with me and let us tread
200,MARCH VIOLETS.,By field and fold and sweet wet wood--
201,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The wind-flower blanches all the copse,"
202,MARCH VIOLETS.,"With hyacinth the hedge is blue,"
203,MARCH VIOLETS.,"And every wakened leaf is fair,"
204,MARCH VIOLETS.,But not so fair as you!
205,MARCH VIOLETS.,
206,MARCH VIOLETS.,The black-birds sing on hazel boughs
207,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Beneath the overarching trees,"
208,MARCH VIOLETS.,The cuckoo's distant song is borne
209,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Across the meadow by the breeze,"
210,MARCH VIOLETS.,The thrush's song is sweetest far

224,MARCH VIOLETS.,How the Spring grows each day from dawn to dark.

228,MARCH VIOLETS.,"When forth she moves, her dainty foot is set,"

231,MARCH VIOLETS.,Changes of measure for her pleasuring.
232,MARCH VIOLETS.,
233,MARCH VIOLETS.,And all night long a passionate music stirs
234,MARCH VIOLETS.,Without her walls--the darkened belt of firs;
235,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Hushed in their waving boughs the low winds brood,"
236,MARCH VIOLETS.,Murmuring the sea's song for an interlude.

244,MARCH VIOLETS.,The last bright relic of the moon's full gold
245,MARCH VIOLETS.,Burns on the swiftly flowing river's breast;
246,MARCH VIOLETS.,No sound but restless dipping of strong oars
247,MARCH VIOLETS.,To break the charm of nature's perfect rest.
248,MARCH VIOLETS.,
249,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Far off the town's faint mingled clamours stir,"
250,MARCH VIOLETS.,And through the silence of the nearer light
251,MARCH VIOLETS.,The incense of the evening mist floats up--
252,MARCH VIOLETS.,The day's last lingering love-word to the night.
253,MARCH VIOLETS.,
254,MARCH VIOLETS.,A sudden shiver of regretful change
255,MARCH VIOLETS.,Sighs through the whispering boughs that overhead
256,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Sway in the wind's breath: down the red sun dips,"
257,MARCH VIOLETS.,And in the twilight's arms the day lies dead.
258,MARCH VIOLETS.,
259,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Then rain, and after, moonshine cold and fair,"
260,MARCH VIOLETS.,"And scent of earth, sweet with the evening rain,"
261,MARCH VIOLETS.,"And slow soft speech beneath the rain-washed trees,"
262,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Ah, that such things should never come again!"
263,MARCH VIOLETS.,

265,MARCH VIOLETS.,
266,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Oh listening trees, where are the words we spoke?"
267,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Where are our sighs, wind whom those sighs caressed?"

279,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Blow, blow, blow, and away they go--"
280,MARCH VIOLETS.,But they do not tell us the time you know!
281,MARCH VIOLETS.,
282,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Say, what month is it, children dear?"
283,MARCH VIOLETS.,We think it is August because we hear
284,MARCH VIOLETS.,"The swing of the sickle, restless and slow,"
285,MARCH VIOLETS.,"And that's a sign of the month, you know."
286,MARCH VIOLETS.,
287,MARCH VIOLETS.,[Illustration]
288,MARCH VIOLETS.,
289,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Where are you going, children dear?"
290,MARCH VIOLETS.,Where the lane winds deep and the stream runs clear--
291,MARCH VIOLETS.,There are plenty of beautiful ways to go--
292,MARCH VIOLETS.,But only one way that two only know.
293,MARCH VIOLETS.,
294,MARCH VIOLETS.,"Where are _we_ going, children dear?"

309,HOP PICKING.,And breathe God's blessed air again;
310,HOP PICKING.,Where glorious yellow corn-fields blaze
311,HOP PICKING.,And nuts hang over woodland ways.
312,HOP PICKING.,
313,HOP PICKING.,"To pick the sweet keen-scented hops,"

328,HOP PICKING.,And what was the loveliest thing we met?
329,HOP PICKING.,Ah--we forget!
330,HOP PICKING.,
331,HOP PICKING.,We remember though all the firelit glow
332,HOP PICKING.,"Of a great hearth's gleam and glare,"
