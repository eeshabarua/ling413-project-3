4,THE DALBY BEAR,THE DALBY BEAR 
5,THE DALBY BEAR,"There goes a bear on Dalby moors, Oxen and horses he devours. "
6,THE DALBY BEAR,The peasants are in deep distress The laidly bear should them oppress. 
7,THE DALBY BEAR,"Their heads together at length they lay, How they the bear might seize and slay. "
8,THE DALBY BEAR,"They drove their porkers through the wood, The bear turn'd round as he lay at food. "
9,THE DALBY BEAR,"Outspoke as best he could the bear: ""What kind of guests approach my lair?"" "
10,THE DALBY BEAR,"Uprose the bear amain from his food, A christian man before him stood. "
11,THE DALBY BEAR,"A little hour together they fought, The bear to the earth the man has brought. "
12,THE DALBY BEAR,"Fast came a knight as he could make, He heard the heart of the peasant break. "
13,THE DALBY BEAR,"The bear upon him fiercely glar'd; ""Thou needst not hurry, I'm prepar'd."" "
14,THE DALBY BEAR,"""And thou by me shalt be stoutly met, So thou may'st vapour and thou may'st threat. "
15,THE DALBY BEAR,"""If thou hast spear and nimble hand, I've claws and teeth at my command."" "
16,THE DALBY BEAR,"They fought for a day, they fought for two, And so on the third they continu'd to do. "
17,THE DALBY BEAR,"But when to night the fourth day drew, The bear to the earth the warrior threw. "
18,THE DALBY BEAR,"""Thou wilt no victory gain from me, Thou haughty knight, thou may'st certain be. "
19,THE DALBY BEAR,"""I late was the son of a powerful King, A Queen me into the world did bring. "
20,THE DALBY BEAR,"""My Step-dame chang'd me, as you see, She'd ruin me to eternity. "
21,THE DALBY BEAR,"""About the wild forest I have run, To the boors much scathe and violence done. "
22,THE DALBY BEAR,"""In winter and in summer's tide In peace for me they could not bide. "
23,THE DALBY BEAR,"""But they may thank my cruel Dame, For 'twas through her I a bear became. "
24,THE DALBY BEAR,"""She plac'd around my neck so tight An iron band in wrath and spite. "
25,THE DALBY BEAR,"""If thou this accursed band canst break Thy life from thee I will not take."" "
26,THE DALBY BEAR,"""O I will help thee from thy thrall; Maria's son who has power for all "
27,THE DALBY BEAR,"""Will loosen from thee this stubborn band, Full able thereto is his right hand."" "
28,THE DALBY BEAR,"O'er him the cross the knight did make, The iron burst from the bruin's neck. "
29,THE DALBY BEAR,"He became a youth as fair as day, His father's realm he went to sway. "
30,THE DALBY BEAR,"A noble maid awaits the knight, The hand of the Monarch's sister bright. "
31,THE DALBY BEAR,"They liv'd together in honor and joy, To the cruel Stepdame's great annoy. "
32,THE DALBY BEAR,"A hard flint rock she soon became, For herself she earn'd both woe and shame. "
33,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,TYGGE HERMANDSEN 
34,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Down o'er the isle in torrents fell On a Thursday morn the rain; To fetch his bride now forth shall ride Sir Tygge Hermandsen. 
35,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Sir Tygge out of the window look'd, The brooks ran boisterously; ""To ride out now would bring me woe, So dear no bride I'll buy. "
36,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""But hear thou, Nilaus Benditson, Long shanks has thy good steed; I beg for the love of the God above You'll fetch my bride with speed."" "
37,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then answer'd Nilaus Benditson, In his sleeve thus answer'd he: ""If me thou dispatch thy bride to fetch I'll trick thee certainly."" "
38,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"It was Nilaus Benditson, He rode the bride to meet; There hung silk sheen and sendal green Before his courser's feet. "
39,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"They clad themselves in silken cloth, And in cloth of gold beside; In long array to the Kirk their way They took with the youthful bride. "
40,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"The bride before the holy Kirk door Like a blooming rose did stand; Oft did she turn to the water, to learn If the bridegroom was at hand. "
41,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then answer'd Nilaus Benditson, He stood by the bride so close: ""The brooks so roar'd that to cross the ford He fear'd would wet his hose."" "
42,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,They plac'd the bride on the bridal bench With pomp and honor high; Oft would they turn to the water to learn If the bridegroom bold drew nigh. 
43,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"In the silver cup they skink the ale, And the nut-brown mead they pour; Thus things they sped till day was fled, And until of bed the hour. "
44,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"They lifted up the youthful bride, In the bride-bed her they set; And there sat she for hours three, There came no bridegroom yet. "
45,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"The priests before the bride-bed stood, And sang with all their might: ""Who in the bed in the bridegroom's stead Shall sleep with the bride tonight?"" "
46,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then forth stepp'd Nilaus Benditson, His lac'd shoe off flung he: ""With the bride so bright I'll sleep tonight, And give her my troth with glee."" "
47,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"So they the bridal solemnized, And glad themselves they made; At home was then Tygge Hermandsen, To cross the brooks afraid. "
48,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"It chanc'd upon a Wednesday, The waters began to fall; Across came then Tygge Hermandsen With his gay bridesmen all. "
49,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"And he came to the bridal house Where the feast was spread in state, Then up and cried the youthful bride: ""Ride back, you come too late."" "
50,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Now hear, thou beauteous Sidselil, I've this to complain of thee, That thou hast ta'en another swain And broke thy troth with me."" "
51,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Now hear, thou Tygge Hermandsen, Thou might'st have been aware, I would disdain to wed the swain To wet his feet had fear. "
52,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""If thou hadst been a Lady's swain, And hadst thou lov'd me true, With thy sword's stroke thou wouldst have broke Thy way through the billows blue."" "
53,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""To the cloyster I'll myself betake, And the monkish vow I'll swear; For good or ill, proud Sidselil, I'll never more come here."" "
54,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""But if hereby thy way shall lie When the brooks shall calmly run, If cheeses two in my store I view In thy sack I'll drop thee one."" {13} "

56,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"Sir Ove he has no daughter but one, _All underneath a green hill's side_, He bestow'd her the Lord of Elling upon. _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "

68,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"Stig took her so tenderly by the waist, _All underneath a green hill's side_. And her in the gilded coach he plac'd. _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
69,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"He set her down on the cushions gray, _All underneath a green hill's side_, And he himself drove the coach away. _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
70,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"And when they came under the green wood bough, _All underneath a green hill's side_, Her chariot broke her weight below. _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
71,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"""A wondrous woman I sure must be, _All underneath a green hill's side_, Since my own coach won't carry me."" _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
72,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"""My dearest, my dearest, be not dismay'd, _All underneath a green hill's side_, Thou back canst walk with thy husband's aid."" _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
73,THE WICKED STEPMOTHER,"And when to the castle gate they won, _All underneath a green hill's side_, His sister stood and lean'd thereon. _In such peril through the forest they ride_. "
