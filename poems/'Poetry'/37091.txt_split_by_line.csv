78,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
79,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
80,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,Our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees;
81,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Our loins are battered 'neath us by the swinging, smoking seas."
82,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"From reef and rock and skerry--over headland ness, and voe--"
83,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,The Coastwise Lights of England watch the ships of England go!
84,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
85,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Through the endless summer evenings, on the lineless, level floors;"
86,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,Through the yelling Channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars--
87,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,By day the dipping house-flag and by night the rocket's trail--
88,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,As the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail.
89,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
90,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"We bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care,"
91,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,The flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer;
92,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"From our vexed eyries, head to gale, we bind in burning chains"
93,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,The lover from the sea-rim drawn--his love in English lanes.
94,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
95,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,We greet the clippers wing-and-wing that race the Southern wool;
96,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"We warn the crawling cargo-tanks of Bremen, Leith, and Hull;"
97,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,To each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea--
98,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,The white wall-sided warships or the whalers of Dundee!
99,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
100,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,[Illustration: THE COASTWISE LIGHTS OF ENGLAND.
101,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Come up, come in from Eastward, from the guardports of the Morn!"
102,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Beat up, beat in from Southerly, O gipsies of the Horn!"
103,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Swift shuttles of an Empire's loom that weave us, main to main,"
104,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,The Coastwise Lights of England give you welcome back again!]

110,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,
111,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Go, get you gone up-Channel with the sea-crust on your plates;"
112,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Go, get you into London with the burden of your freights!"
113,THE COASTWISE LIGHTS,"Haste, for they talk of Empire there, and say, if any seek,"

125,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,
126,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,
127,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,_Hear now the Song of the Dead--in the North by the torn berg-edges--
128,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,"They that look still to the Pole, asleep by their hide-stripped"
129,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,sledges.
130,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,"Song of the Dead in the South--in the sun by their skeleton horses,"
131,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,Where the warrigal whimpers and bays through the dust of the sere
132,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,river-courses._
133,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,
134,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,"_Song of the Dead in the East--in the heat-rotted jungle hollows,"
135,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,Where the dog-ape barks in the kloof--in the brake of the
136,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,buffalo-wallows.
137,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,"Song of the Dead in the West--in the Barrens, the waste that"
138,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,"betrayed them,"
139,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,Where the wolverine tumbles their packs from the camp and the
140,THE SONG OF THE DEAD,grave-mound they made them;

146,I,"We were dreamers, dreaming greatly, in the man-stifled town;"
147,I,We yearned beyond the sky-line where the strange roads go down.
148,I,"Came the Whisper, came the Vision, came the Power with the Need,"
149,I,Till the Soul that is not man's soul was lent us to lead.
150,I,As the deer breaks--as the steer breaks--from the herd where
151,I,"they graze,"
152,I,In the faith of little children we went on our ways.
153,I,
154,I,Then the wood failed--then the food failed--then the last water dried--
155,I,In the faith of little children we lay down and died.
156,I,"On the sand-drift--on the veldt-side--in the fern-scrub we lay,"
157,I,That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way.
158,I,"Follow after--follow after! We have watered the root,"
159,I,And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit!
160,I,
161,I,"Follow after--we are waiting, by the trails that we lost,"
162,I,"For the sounds of many footsteps, for the tread of a host."
163,I,Follow after--follow after--for the harvest is sown:
164,I,By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own!
165,I,
166,I,[Illustration: FOLLOW AFTER.

170,I,_When Drake went down to the Horn
171,I,"And England was crowned thereby,"
172,I,'Twixt seas unsailed and shores unhailed
173,I,Our Lodge--our Lodge was born
174,I,(And England was crowned thereby!)_
175,I,
176,I,_Which never shall close again
177,I,"By day nor yet by night,"
178,I,While man shall take his life to stake
179,I,At risk of shoal or main
180,I,(By day nor yet by night)_
181,I,
182,I,_But standeth even so
183,I,"As now we witness here,"
184,I,"While men depart, of joyful heart"
185,I,Adventure for to know
186,I,(As now bear witness here!)_

189,II,II
190,II,
191,II,We have fed our sea for a thousand years
192,II,"And she calls us, still unfed,"
193,II,Though there's never a wave of all her waves
194,II,But marks our English dead:
195,II,We have strawed our best to the weed's unrest
196,II,To the shark and the sheering gull.
197,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
198,II,"Lord God, we ha' paid in full!"

200,II,"[Illustration: LORD GOD, WE HA' PAID IN FULL!"
201,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
202,II,"Lord God, we ha' paid in full!]"
203,II,
204,II,There's never a flood goes shoreward now
205,II,But lifts a keel we manned;
206,II,There's never an ebb goes seaward now
207,II,But drops our dead on the sand--
208,II,"But slinks our dead on the sands forlore,"
209,II,From the Ducies to the Swin.
210,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
211,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
212,II,"Lord God, we ha' paid it in!"
213,II,
214,II,"We must feed our sea for a thousand years,"
215,II,"For that is our doom and pride,"
216,II,"As it was when they sailed with the _Golden Hind_,"
217,II,Or the wreck that struck last tide--
218,II,Or the wreck that lies on the spouting reef
219,II,Where the ghastly blue-lights flare.
220,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
221,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
222,II,"If blood be the price of admiralty,"
223,II,"Lord God, we ha' bought it fair!"

232,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,"Down to the dark, to the utter dark, where the blind white"
233,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,sea-snakes are.
234,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,"There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,"
235,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,Or the great grey level plains of ooze where the shell-buried
236,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,cables creep.
237,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,
238,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,Here in the womb of the world--here on the tie-ribs of earth

240,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,"Warning, sorrow and gain, salutation and mirth--"
241,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.
242,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,
243,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,They have wakened the timeless Things; they have killed their
244,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,father Time;
245,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,"Joining hands in the gloom, a league from the last of the sun."
246,THE DEEP-SEA CABLES,"Hush! Men talk to-day o'er the waste of the ultimate slime,"
