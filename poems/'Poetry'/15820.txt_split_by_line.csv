101,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.
102,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
103,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
104,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"A heartfelt greeting to you, my young friends; a merry Christmas and a"
105,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,happy New Year to you all. Of all the three hundred and sixty-five
106,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,days none are fraught with the same interest--there is not one on
107,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"which all mankind expect so great an amount of enjoyment, as those we"
108,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"now celebrate: for all now try not only to be happy themselves, but to"
109,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,make others so too. All consider themselves called on to endeavour to
110,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,add to the aggregate of human happiness. Those who have been
111,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"estranged, now forget their differences and hold out the hand of"
112,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,amity; even the wretched criminal and incarcerated are not forgotten.
113,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
114,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Yes, to both the Christian and the worlding, it is equally the season"
115,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"for rejoicing. Oh yes! view them in any of their bearings, joyful are"
116,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"the days that mark the anniversary of the Redeemer's Nativity, and the"
117,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,commencement of the New Year. Fast as the last twelve months have sped
118,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"their circling course, yet they have, brought changes to many. Numbers"
119,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"of those we so gaily greeted at their beginning, now sleep in the"
120,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"silent dust, and the places they filled know them no more! And we are"
121,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"spared, the monuments of God's mercy; and how have we improved that"
122,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"mercy, I would ask? or how do we purpose doing it? Have such of us as"
123,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"have enjoyed great and perhaps increased blessings, been taught by"
124,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,them to feel more gratitude to the Giver of all good. If the sun of
125,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"prosperity has shone more brightly, has our desire to do good been in"
126,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,any way proportionate. Has God in his infinite wisdom seen fit to send
127,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"us trials,--have they done their work, have they brought us nearer to"
128,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Him, have they told us this is not our abiding place, have they shown"
129,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,us the instability of earthly happiness? Have you reflected for one
130,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"moment, amidst your late rejoicings, of the hundreds whose hearths"
131,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"have been desolated by cruel but necessary war, and then with a full"
132,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,and grateful heart humbly thanked the God who has not only spared you
133,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"these heavy inflictions, but preserved all near and dear to you."
134,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
135,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,Oh ye young and happy! have you looked around you and thought of all
136,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"this, and then knelt in thankfulness for the blessings spared you?"
137,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Remembering _all this_, have ye on bended knees prayed, and fervently,"
138,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,that this day may be the epoch on which to date your resolves to be
139,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"and to do better. Oh, may the present period be eventful, greatly"
140,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"eventful, for time and eternity."
141,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
142,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Let us pause awhile ere we commence another year, and take a"
143,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"retrospective glance at the past. Can we bear to do so, or will day"
144,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"after day, and hour after hour, rise up in judgment against us? Can we"
145,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"bear to bring them into debtor and creditor account,--what offsets can"
146,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,we make against those devoted to sin and frivolity?
147,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
148,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Has every blessing and every mercy been taken as a matter of course,"
149,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,and every pleasure been enjoyed with a thankless forgetfulness of the
150,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"hand from which it flowed? If such has been the case, let it be so no"
151,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"longer; but awake and rouse ye from your lethargic slumber, be true to"
152,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"yourselves, and remember that you are responsible beings, and will"
153,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,have to account for all the time and talents misspent and misapplied.
154,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,Reflect seriously on the true end of existence and no longer fritter
155,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,it away in vanity and folly. Think of all the good you might have
156,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"done, not only by individual exertion, but by the influence of your"
157,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,example. Then reverse the picture and ask if much evil may not
158,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,actually have occurred through these omissions in you.
159,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
160,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"To many of you too, life now presents a very different aspect to what"
161,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,it did in the commencement of the year. A most important day has
162,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"dawned, and momentous duties devolved on you. The ties that bound you"
163,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"to the homes of your youth have been severed, and new ones formed, aye"
164,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"stronger ones than even to the mother that bare you. Yes, there is one"
165,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"who is now _dearer_ than the parent who cherished, or the sister who"
166,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"grew up with you, and shared your father's hearth. Oh! could I now but"
167,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"impress upon your minds, how much, how _very much_ of your happiness"
168,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,depends on the way you begin. If I could but make you sensible how
169,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,greatly doing so might soften the trials of after life. Trials? I hear
170,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"each of you exclaim in joyous doubt, What trials? I am united to the"
171,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"object of my dearest affections; friends all smile on, and approve my"
172,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,choice; plenty crowns our board: have I not made a league with sorrow
173,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,that it should not come near our dwelling? I hope not; for it might
174,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,lead you to forget the things that belong to your peace. I should
175,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"tremble for you, could I fancy a life-long period without a trouble."
176,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"You are mortal and could not bear it, with safety to your eternal"
177,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"well-being. This life being probationary, God has wisely ordained it a"
178,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"chequered one. Happy, thoroughly happy as you may be now, you are not"
179,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,invulnerable to the shafts of sorrow;--think how very many are the
180,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"inlets through which trial may enter, and pray that whenever and"
181,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"however assailed, you may as a Christian, sanctify whatever befalls"
182,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,you to your future good.
183,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
184,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"But while prepared to meet those ills ""the flesh is heir to"" as"
185,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"becomes a Christian, it is well to remember that you may greatly"
186,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"diminish many of the troubles of life, by forbearance and"
187,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"self-command, for certain it is, that more than one half of mankind"
188,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"make a great deal of what they suffer, and which they might avoid."
189,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Yes, much of what they endure are actually self inflictions."
190,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
191,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"There is a general, and alas! too true an outcry, that trouble is the"
192,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"lot of all, and that ""man is born to trouble as the sparks fly"
193,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"upward;"" but let me ask, Is there not a vast amount made by ourselves?"
194,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"and do we not often take it up in anticipation, too often indulge and"
195,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"give way to it, when by cheerful resignation, we might, if not wholly"
196,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"avert, yet greatly nullify its power to mar our peace. Mind, I now"
197,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,speak of self-created and minor troubles; not those coming immediately
198,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,from God. Are we not guilty of ingratitude in acting thus; in throwing
199,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"away, or as it were thrusting from us the blessings he has sent--merely"
200,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"by indulging in, or giving way to these minor trials. It may be said"
201,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"of these sort of troubles, as of difficulties, ""Stare them in the"
202,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"face, and you conquer them; yield to, and they overcome you, and form"
203,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"unnecessary suffering."""
204,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
205,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"If we could only consider a little when things annoy us, and reflect"
206,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"how much worse they might be, and how differently they would affect us"
207,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,even under less favourable circumstances than those in which we are
208,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"placed; but instead of making the best of every thing, we only dwell"
209,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"on the annoyance, regardless of many extenuations that may attend it."
210,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
211,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"As one of the means to happiness, I would beg of you, my fair young"
212,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"Brides, not to fix too high a standard by which to measure either the"
213,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,perfections of your beloved partners or your own hopes of being happy.
214,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,Bear in mind that those to whom you are united are subject to the same
215,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,infirmities as yourself. Look well to what are your requirements as
216,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"wives, and then prayerfully and steadily act up to them, and if your"
217,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"hopes are not built too high, you may, by acting rightly and"
218,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"rationally, find a well spring of peace and enjoyment that _must_"
219,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"increase. Think what very proud feelings will be yours, to find you"
220,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,are appreciated and esteemed for the good qualities of the heart and
221,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"endowments of the mind, and to hear after months of trial, the _wife_"
222,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,pronounced _dearer_ than the _bride_.
223,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
224,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,Look around at the many who have entered the pale of matrimony before
225,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"you, equally buoyant with hope; with the same loving hearts and the"
226,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"same bright prospects as you had,--and yet the stern realities of life"
227,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,have sobered down that romance of feeling with which they started; yet
228,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"they are perhaps more happy, though it is a quiet happiness, founded"
229,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"on esteem. Oh, you know not the extent to which the conduct I have"
230,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"urged you to pursue, may affect your well-being, and that of him to"
231,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,whom you are united.
232,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,
233,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"And now with the same greeting I commenced with, will I take my"
234,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"leave--a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all, and may each"
235,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,succeeding return find you progressing in all that can give you peace
236,AN ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG.,"and happiness, not only here but hereafter!"

242,THE DYING HORSE.,
243,THE DYING HORSE.,
244,THE DYING HORSE.,Heaven! what enormous strength does death possess!
245,THE DYING HORSE.,How muscular the giant's arm must be
246,THE DYING HORSE.,"To grasp that strong boned horse, and, spite of all"
247,THE DYING HORSE.,"His furious efforts, fix him to the earth!"
248,THE DYING HORSE.,"Yet, hold, he rises!--no--the struggle's vain;"
249,THE DYING HORSE.,His strength avails him not. Beneath the gripe
250,THE DYING HORSE.,"Of the remorseless monster, stretched at length"
251,THE DYING HORSE.,He lies with neck extended; head hard pressed
252,THE DYING HORSE.,Upon the very turf where late he fed.
253,THE DYING HORSE.,His writhing fibres speak his inward pain!
254,THE DYING HORSE.,His smoking nostrils speak his inward fire!
255,THE DYING HORSE.,Oh! how he glares! and hark! methinks I hear
256,THE DYING HORSE.,"His bubbling blood, which seems to burst the veins."
257,THE DYING HORSE.,"Amazement! Horror! What a desperate plunge,"
258,THE DYING HORSE.,See! where his ironed hoof has dashed a sod
259,THE DYING HORSE.,With the velocity of lightning. Ah!--
260,THE DYING HORSE.,"He rises,--triumphs;--yes, the victory's his!"
261,THE DYING HORSE.,No--the wrestler Death again has thrown him
262,THE DYING HORSE.,And--oh! with what a murdering dreadful fall!
263,THE DYING HORSE.,"Soft!--he is quiet. Yet whence came that groan,"
264,THE DYING HORSE.,"Was't from his chest, or from the throat of death"
265,THE DYING HORSE.,"Exulting in his conquest! I know not,"
266,THE DYING HORSE.,"But if 'twas his, it surely was his last;"
267,THE DYING HORSE.,"For see, he scarcely stirs! Soft! Does he breathe?"
268,THE DYING HORSE.,Ah no! he breathes no more. 'Tis very strange!
269,THE DYING HORSE.,
270,THE DYING HORSE.,How still he's now! how fiery hot--how cold
271,THE DYING HORSE.,How terrible! How lifeless! all within
272,THE DYING HORSE.,A few brief moments!--My reason staggers!
273,THE DYING HORSE.,"Philosophy, thy poor enlightened dotard,"
274,THE DYING HORSE.,"Who canst for every thing assign a cause,"
275,THE DYING HORSE.,"Here take thy stand beside me, and explain"
276,THE DYING HORSE.,This hidden mystery. Bring with thee
277,THE DYING HORSE.,The head strong Atheist; who laughs at heaven
278,THE DYING HORSE.,"And impiously ascribes events to chance,"
279,THE DYING HORSE.,To help to solve this wonderful enigma!
280,THE DYING HORSE.,"First, tell me, ye proud haughty reasoners,"
281,THE DYING HORSE.,Where the vast strength this creature late possessed
282,THE DYING HORSE.,"Has fled to? how the bright sparkling fire,"
283,THE DYING HORSE.,Which flashed but now from those dim rayless eyes
284,THE DYING HORSE.,Has been extinguished? Oh--he's dead you say.
285,THE DYING HORSE.,"I know it well:--but how, and by what means?"
286,THE DYING HORSE.,"Was it the arm of chance that struck him down,"
287,THE DYING HORSE.,"In height of vigor, and in pride of strength,"
288,THE DYING HORSE.,"To stiffen in the blast? Come, come, tell me:"
289,THE DYING HORSE.,Nay shake not thus the head's that are enriched
290,THE DYING HORSE.,"With eighty years of wisdom, gleaned from books,"
291,THE DYING HORSE.,"From nights of study, and the magazines"
292,THE DYING HORSE.,"Of knowledge, which your predecessors left."
293,THE DYING HORSE.,"What! not a word!--I ask you, once again,"
294,THE DYING HORSE.,"How comes it that the wond'rous essence,"
295,THE DYING HORSE.,Which gave such vigour to these strong nerved limbs
296,THE DYING HORSE.,"Has leaped from its enclosure, and compelled"
297,THE DYING HORSE.,"This noble workmanship of nature, thus"
298,THE DYING HORSE.,To sink Into a cold inactive clod?
299,THE DYING HORSE.,Nay sneak not off thus cowardly--poor fools
300,THE DYING HORSE.,Ye are as destitute of information
301,THE DYING HORSE.,As is the lifeless subject of my thoughts!
302,THE DYING HORSE.,
303,THE DYING HORSE.,The _subject of my thoughts_? Yes--there he lies
304,THE DYING HORSE.,"As free from life, as if he ne'er had lived."
305,THE DYING HORSE.,Where are his friends and where his old acquaintance
306,THE DYING HORSE.,"Who borrowed from his strength, when in the yoke,"
307,THE DYING HORSE.,With weary pace the steep ascent they climbed?
308,THE DYING HORSE.,"Where are the gay companions of his prime,"
309,THE DYING HORSE.,"Who with him ambled o'er the flowery turf,"
310,THE DYING HORSE.,"And proudly snorting, passed the way worn hack,"
311,THE DYING HORSE.,"With haughty brow; and, on his ragged coat"
312,THE DYING HORSE.,"Looked with contemptuous scorn? Oh yonder see,"
313,THE DYING HORSE.,Carelessly basking in the mid-day sun
314,THE DYING HORSE.,"They lie, and heed him not;--little thinking"
315,THE DYING HORSE.,While there they triumph in the blaze of noon.
316,THE DYING HORSE.,How soon the dread annihilating hour
317,THE DYING HORSE.,"Will come, and death seal up their eyes,"
318,THE DYING HORSE.,"Like his, forever. Now moralizer"
319,THE DYING HORSE.,Retire! yet first proclaim this sacred truth;
320,THE DYING HORSE.,"_Chance_ rules not over Death; but, when a fly"
321,THE DYING HORSE.,"Falls to the earth, 'tis _Heaven_ that gives the blow."

330,COQUETRY.,
331,COQUETRY.,"It was in one of the most picturesque parts of South Wales, on the"
332,COQUETRY.,"banks of the lovely Towy, that two ladies sat working at an open"
333,COQUETRY.,"casement, which led into a veranda, covered with clematis and"
334,COQUETRY.,"honey-suckle. The elder of the two might be about fifty, perhaps not"
335,COQUETRY.,"so much, for her features bore traces of suffering and sadness, which"
336,COQUETRY.,"plainly told, that sorrow had planted far deeper wrinkles there than"
337,COQUETRY.,"time alone could have done. The younger, an interesting girl of"
338,COQUETRY.,"nineteen, bore a strong resemblance to her mother; they were both"
339,COQUETRY.,"dressed in deep mourning. The room which they occupied, though plainly"
340,COQUETRY.,"and simply furnished, had yet an air of taste and elegance."
341,COQUETRY.,
342,COQUETRY.,"Mrs. Fortescue was the widow of an officer, who died of cholera in the"
343,COQUETRY.,"East Indies, leaving her with one daughter, and no other means of"
344,COQUETRY.,support than a small annuity and her pension. An old servant of her
345,COQUETRY.,"own had married a corporal in the same regiment, who having purchased"
346,COQUETRY.,"his discharge, now followed the trade of a carpenter, to which he had"
347,COQUETRY.,"been brought up, previous to enlisting, and was settled in his native"
348,COQUETRY.,"place, and the faithful Hannah, hearing of the Captain's death wrote"
349,COQUETRY.,"to Mrs. Fortescue, telling her, not only of the beauty of the spot,"
350,COQUETRY.,"but the cheapness of living in that part of the world, concluding by"
351,COQUETRY.,"saying, a house was then vacant, and could be had on very reasonable"
352,COQUETRY.,terms. Mrs. Fortescue immediately wrote and engaged it. Though a
353,COQUETRY.,"common looking building, yet by putting a veranda round, and making a"
354,COQUETRY.,"few alterations inside, it soon, with a little painting and papering,"
355,COQUETRY.,was transformed into a pretty cottage. The work required was an
356,COQUETRY.,"advantage to Mrs. Fortescue, inasmuch as it occupied her mind and thus"
357,COQUETRY.,"prevented her dwelling on her recent affliction, in other respects"
358,COQUETRY.,"too, she felt that a kind providence had directed her steps to the"
359,COQUETRY.,"little village in which we find her--and the good she found to do, was"
360,COQUETRY.,the greatest balm her wounded spirit could receive: for though her
361,COQUETRY.,"means were so limited, still, a wide field of usefulness lay before"
362,COQUETRY.,her.
363,COQUETRY.,
364,COQUETRY.,"Mrs. Fortescue had a strong mind, and though her trial was hard, very"
365,COQUETRY.,"hard to bear, she remembered from whom it came, and not a murmur"
366,COQUETRY.,"escaped her. Devotedly attached to her husband, she deeply lamented"
367,COQUETRY.,"her loss, still she sorrowed not as one without hope: she had the"
368,COQUETRY.,consolation of knowing few were better prepared for the change; and
369,COQUETRY.,she strove to take comfort in reflecting how greatly her grief would
370,COQUETRY.,"have been augmented, were not such the case. But she felt that her"
371,COQUETRY.,shield had been taken from her; and knowing how precarious was her own
372,COQUETRY.,"health, she saw how desolate would be her child, should it please God"
373,COQUETRY.,"to remove her also, but a true Christian cannot mourn long; and as the"
374,COQUETRY.,"tears of agony would force themselves down her cheek, and her feelings"
375,COQUETRY.,"almost overpower her, she flew to her bible and in its gracious"
376,COQUETRY.,"promises to the afflicted, found that support and consolation, the"
377,COQUETRY.,"mere worldling can neither judge of, nor taste. Some delay, though no"
378,COQUETRY.,"actual doubt, as to ultimately obtaining her pension, had caused"
379,COQUETRY.,"inconvenience, as all their ready money had been absorbed in the"
380,COQUETRY.,"alterations of their house, though they had observed the utmost"
381,COQUETRY.,"economy, and demands were made which they had not at the time funds to"
382,COQUETRY.,"meet. Ethelind was miserable, but Mrs. Fortescue bore against all,"
383,COQUETRY.,"trusting something would turn up,--and so it did; for while discussing"
384,COQUETRY.,"the matter, a letter came, with an enclosure, from an old school"
385,COQUETRY.,"fellow, begging them to procure her board and lodging in the village"
386,COQUETRY.,"for a few months, intimating how much she would like it, if they could"
387,COQUETRY.,accommodate her themselves. The terms for the first quarter were
388,COQUETRY.,highly remunerative and they gladly acceded to Miss Trevor's
389,COQUETRY.,"proposition, and the few requisite preparations being made, we will,"
390,COQUETRY.,"if our reader pleases, go back to the evening when mother and daughter"
391,COQUETRY.,sat awaiting the arrival of their new inmate.
392,COQUETRY.,
393,COQUETRY.,"Mrs. Fortescue had never seen Beatrice Trevor, but Ethelind was loud"
394,COQUETRY.,in her praises. They sat in anxious expectation much beyond the usual
395,COQUETRY.,"time for the arrival of the stage, and were just giving her up for the"
396,COQUETRY.,"night, when the rumbling of wheels was heard, and a post chaise drove"
397,COQUETRY.,"up, out of which sprang a young lady who in another moment was clasped"
398,COQUETRY.,"in Ethelind's arms, and introduced to her mother, who welcomed her"
399,COQUETRY.,most kindly.
400,COQUETRY.,
401,COQUETRY.,"""Oh what a little Paradise!"" said Beatrice, looking round her, ""how"
402,COQUETRY.,happy you must be here. Do Ethelind let me have one peep outside ere
403,COQUETRY.,"daylight is gone;"" so saying, she darted through the French casement,"
404,COQUETRY.,"on to the lawn, which sloped down to the water's edge. ""Well I"
405,COQUETRY.,"declare, this is a perfect Elysium, I am so glad I made up my mind to"
406,COQUETRY.,"come here, instead of going with the Fultons to Cheltenham."""
407,COQUETRY.,
408,COQUETRY.,"""I am indeed rejoiced that you are so pleased with our retreat, my"
409,COQUETRY.,"dear Miss Trevor, it is indeed a lovely spot."""
410,COQUETRY.,
411,COQUETRY.,"""No Miss Trevor, if you please, my dear madam: it must be plain"
412,COQUETRY.,"Beatrice, and you must regard me as you do Ethelind, and be a mother"
413,COQUETRY.,"to me; for I know I greatly need a monitress; for you will find me, I"
414,COQUETRY.,"fear a sad giddy mad-cap."""
415,COQUETRY.,
416,COQUETRY.,"Mrs. Fortescue smiling benignly promised acquiescence, and taking her"
417,COQUETRY.,"hand, which she grasped affectionately; led her into the next room,"
418,COQUETRY.,"where tea was waiting. After which, Ethelind took her up stairs, and"
419,COQUETRY.,showed her the little bedroom prepared for her. They remained here
420,COQUETRY.,"some time, chatting over their old school days, till summoned to"
421,COQUETRY.,"prayers. On taking leave for the night, Mrs. Fortescue begged if at"
422,COQUETRY.,"all heavy in the morning, that Beatrice would not hurry up. But she"
423,COQUETRY.,"arose early, much refreshed and delighted with all she saw. Ethelind"
424,COQUETRY.,"soon joined her, and offered to help her unpack, and arrange her"
425,COQUETRY.,"things, while the only servant they had, prepared the breakfast."
426,COQUETRY.,
427,COQUETRY.,"Soon as the morning meal was over, and little necessary arrangements"
428,COQUETRY.,"made, Ethelind proposed a ramble, which was gladly acceded to on the"
429,COQUETRY.,"part of Beatrice. They passed through an orchard into a lane, and as"
430,COQUETRY.,"they crossed a rustic bridge, the village church came in view. It was"
431,COQUETRY.,"a small gothic structure, standing in the burial ground, and as they"
432,COQUETRY.,"approached it, Beatrice was struck with admiration at the beds of"
433,COQUETRY.,"flowers, then blooming in full perfection on the graves; this is a"
434,COQUETRY.,"very beautiful, and, by no means, uncommon sight in South Wales; but"
435,COQUETRY.,"she had never seen it before. ""Well, I declare, this is lovely;"
436,COQUETRY.,"really, Ethelind, to render the charm of romance complete, you ought"
437,COQUETRY.,"to have a very interesting young curate, with pale features and dark"
438,COQUETRY.,"hair and eyes."""
439,COQUETRY.,
440,COQUETRY.,"""And so we have,"" said Ethelind, ""and had he sat for his picture, you"
441,COQUETRY.,"could not have drawn a more correct likeness; but I regret to say, Mr."
442,COQUETRY.,"Barclay's stay is not likely to be permanent, as one of Lord Eardly's"
443,COQUETRY.,"sons is to have the living, soon as the family returns from the"
444,COQUETRY.,"Continent, which we are all sorry for; as short as the time is, that"
445,COQUETRY.,"Mr. Barclay has been among us, he is generally liked, and from his"
446,COQUETRY.,"manner, we think the curacy, little as it is, an object to him; though"
447,COQUETRY.,"even now, he does a great deal of good, and you would hardly believe"
448,COQUETRY.,"all he has accomplished. I wish he were here, for I am sure you would"
449,COQUETRY.,"like him."""
450,COQUETRY.,
451,COQUETRY.,"""I think,"" said Beatrice, ""it is well he is not, for I might fall in"
452,COQUETRY.,"love with him, and then--"""
453,COQUETRY.,
454,COQUETRY.,"""And then, what?"" asked Ethelind."
455,COQUETRY.,
456,COQUETRY.,"""Why it must end in disappointment to both; for if he is poor and I am"
457,COQUETRY.,"poor, it would be little use our coming together; but were I rich, as"
458,COQUETRY.,"I expected to have been, then I might have set my cap at your young"
459,COQUETRY.,"curate, and rewarded his merit."""
460,COQUETRY.,
461,COQUETRY.,"""Oh!"" said Ethelind, ""he deserves to be rich, he would make such good"
462,COQUETRY.,"use of wealth, for even now, he is very charitable."""
463,COQUETRY.,
464,COQUETRY.,"""Charitable!"" re-echoed Beatrice, ""a curate, on perhaps less than a"
465,COQUETRY.,"hundred a year, must have a deal to be charitable with. Absurd: I"
466,COQUETRY.,"grant you he may have the heart, but certainly not the means."""
467,COQUETRY.,
468,COQUETRY.,"""I know not,"" said Ethelind, ""but I hear continually of the good he"
469,COQUETRY.,"does, and his kindness to the poor, and doubt if the Honourable"
470,COQUETRY.,"Frederic Eardly will do as much."""
471,COQUETRY.,
472,COQUETRY.,"""Out upon these proud scions of nobility, I have not common patience"
473,COQUETRY.,"with the younger members of the aristocracy, taking holy orders solely"
474,COQUETRY.,for the sake of aggrandizing the elder branches of the family; they
475,COQUETRY.,"are rarely actuated by pious motives."""
476,COQUETRY.,
477,COQUETRY.,"""We had only one service a-day till Mr. Barclay came, and now he"
478,COQUETRY.,"officiates morning and evening, besides managing to do duty, in the"
479,COQUETRY.,"afternoon, for a sick clergyman, who lives five miles off, and has a"
480,COQUETRY.,"large family, two of whom our worthy curate educates,--"""
481,COQUETRY.,
482,COQUETRY.,"""No more,"" Ethelind, or my heart will be irrecoverably gone; but what"
483,COQUETRY.,"large house is that I see among the trees?"""
484,COQUETRY.,
485,COQUETRY.,"""That is Eardly House."""
486,COQUETRY.,
487,COQUETRY.,"""And do the family ever reside there?"""
488,COQUETRY.,
489,COQUETRY.,"""They have not, since we have been in this part of the world, but when"
490,COQUETRY.,"in England, I am told, they spend part of every summer here."""
491,COQUETRY.,
492,COQUETRY.,"""And if they come, they will spoil both our pleasure and our privacy;"
493,COQUETRY.,"say what you will, great people are a nuisance in a small village."""
494,COQUETRY.,
495,COQUETRY.,"""To those who are situated like us, I grant it is unpleasant, but they"
496,COQUETRY.,"may do a great deal of good to their poor tenants. But, hark, it is"
497,COQUETRY.,"striking two,--our dinner hour,--mamma will wonder what is become of"
498,COQUETRY.,"us; there is a short cut through the Park, which we will take, it will"
499,COQUETRY.,"save, at least, a quarter of a mile."" So through the Park they went,"
500,COQUETRY.,"and as they left it, to cross the road, a gentleman suddenly turned"
501,COQUETRY.,"the corner, and Mr. Barclay stood full before them."
502,COQUETRY.,
503,COQUETRY.,"""Why, Mr. Barclay,"" exclaimed Ethelind, ""where, in the name of wonder,"
504,COQUETRY.,"did you come from? did you rise from the lake, or drop from the"
505,COQUETRY.,"clouds? I thought you were many miles away."""
506,COQUETRY.,
507,COQUETRY.,"""And so I expected to be,"" said he, shaking hands with her, and bowing"
508,COQUETRY.,"to Beatrice, ""but circumstances wholly unexpected, compelled me to"
509,COQUETRY.,"return."""
510,COQUETRY.,
511,COQUETRY.,"""And are you going to remain?"""
512,COQUETRY.,
513,COQUETRY.,"""For some months, I believe."""
514,COQUETRY.,
515,COQUETRY.,"""I am really glad to hear it, and so, I am sure, will mamma be; but in"
516,COQUETRY.,"the agreeable surprise your unlooked for return gave, I forgot to"
517,COQUETRY.,"introduce Miss Trevor."" The conversation now took a general turn, and"
518,COQUETRY.,"Mr. Barclay accompanied them to their door, where he only staid to"
519,COQUETRY.,"shake hands with Mrs. Fortescue, and then took his leave, promising to"
520,COQUETRY.,return in the evening.
521,COQUETRY.,
522,COQUETRY.,"As may naturally be supposed, many weeks followed of delightful"
523,COQUETRY.,"intercourse; Mr. Barclay, when ever it did not interfere with his"
524,COQUETRY.,"duties, was the constant attendant of Ethelind, and Beatrice; he spent"
525,COQUETRY.,"every evening at Mrs. Fortescue's cottage, affording much speculation"
526,COQUETRY.,"to the village gossips, as to which of the two young ladies would"
527,COQUETRY.,ultimately become the curate's choice. With their aid he carried out
528,COQUETRY.,"his much cherished object of establishing a Sunday School, and"
529,COQUETRY.,"everything was going on quietly, till, at length, an unusual bustle"
530,COQUETRY.,was observed in the village; artizans of every description were sent
531,COQUETRY.,"from London, and the news was soon spread, that after the necessary"
532,COQUETRY.,"repairs and preparations were completed, the family might be expected."
533,COQUETRY.,
534,COQUETRY.,"This was anything but welcome intelligence to Ethelind and Beatrice,"
535,COQUETRY.,who feared all their enjoyment would be disturbed. When Mr. Barclay
536,COQUETRY.,"came in the evening, he confirmed the report and little else was"
537,COQUETRY.,talked of.
538,COQUETRY.,
539,COQUETRY.,"""It is really provoking,"" said Ethelind ""I am quite of Beatrice's"
540,COQUETRY.,"opinion, and think great folks anything but desirable in such a small"
541,COQUETRY.,"place, at least, to people circumstanced as we are."""
542,COQUETRY.,
543,COQUETRY.,"""I am of opinion,"" said Mr. Barclay, ""you will find it quite the"
544,COQUETRY.,"reverse."""
545,COQUETRY.,
546,COQUETRY.,"""Shall you remain as curate,"" asked Mrs. Fortescue."
547,COQUETRY.,
548,COQUETRY.,"""Frederic Eardly purposes to make poor Bennet his curate."""
549,COQUETRY.,
550,COQUETRY.,"""But if he is so ill he will not be able to do the duty,"" said"
551,COQUETRY.,Beatrice.
552,COQUETRY.,
553,COQUETRY.,"""It is not hard, and Eardly is well able to do it himself."""
554,COQUETRY.,
555,COQUETRY.,"""But will he,"" said she, ""I really feel curious, to see how this"
556,COQUETRY.,"embryo bishop will get on, as I suppose nothing less is the object of"
557,COQUETRY.,"his taking orders."""
558,COQUETRY.,
559,COQUETRY.,"""Oh, Miss Trevor, judge not so harshly. Is it not possible that in"
560,COQUETRY.,"singleness of heart, he may have gone into the Church, unmindful of"
561,COQUETRY.,"all but the sacred calling? I do not pretend to judge, but I believe"
562,COQUETRY.,"no worldly honour or pecuniary consideration influenced his choice, as"
563,COQUETRY.,"I know his grandfather left him quite independent."""
564,COQUETRY.,
565,COQUETRY.,"""Oh, don't tell me, Mr. Barclay, it is very unlikely; but it is"
566,COQUETRY.,"natural that you should take his part because--"""
567,COQUETRY.,
568,COQUETRY.,"""Because, what?"" responded Mr. Barclay, ""do you think money or"
569,COQUETRY.,"interest would prompt me to say what I don't think or mean?"""
570,COQUETRY.,
571,COQUETRY.,"""No,"" said Beatrice, ""I think you the last person in the world to"
572,COQUETRY.,"truckle to the great,--but no more of this; what kind of a being is"
573,COQUETRY.,"this Frederic Eardly?"""
574,COQUETRY.,
575,COQUETRY.,"""I am a poor judge of character, besides, you would hardly give me"
576,COQUETRY.,credit for being impartial. They say he is spoilt by his mother and
577,COQUETRY.,"sisters, by whom he is perfectly idolized and to whom he is, in"
578,COQUETRY.,"return, devotedly attached."""
579,COQUETRY.,
580,COQUETRY.,"""Come, that and helping poor Bennet, are certainly very redeeming"
581,COQUETRY.,"traits; but will his giving him a preference be doing justice to you,"
582,COQUETRY.,"who have done so much, and will it not--"" here feeling she was going"
583,COQUETRY.,"too far, she coloured."
584,COQUETRY.,
585,COQUETRY.,"Mr. Barclay too, was much confused; and Beatrice was greatly relieved"
586,COQUETRY.,when Mrs. Fortescue turned the conversation. She had long remarked to
587,COQUETRY.,"herself, there was a mystery about Mr. Barclay which she could not"
588,COQUETRY.,"understand. There was, at times, a reserve she attributed to pride. If"
589,COQUETRY.,"not well born, he was quite _au fait_ in all the usages of well-bred"
590,COQUETRY.,"society. He never spoke of his family, but Mrs. Fortescue once asked"
591,COQUETRY.,"him if he had any sisters, when he replied, ""Two, such as any brother"
592,COQUETRY.,"might be proud of;"" but, while he spoke, the blood mantled in his"
593,COQUETRY.,"forehead, and fearing it might result from pride, she dropped the"
594,COQUETRY.,"subject, and, for the future, avoided saying anything that might"
595,COQUETRY.,"recall it, trusting that, in time, she might win his confidence."
596,COQUETRY.,
597,COQUETRY.,"Almost unconsciously to herself, was Ethelind, under the garb of"
598,COQUETRY.,"friendship, indulging a preference from which her delicacy shrank. She"
599,COQUETRY.,"could plainly see a growing attachment in Mr. Barclay to Beatrice, and"
600,COQUETRY.,"could not, for a moment, suppose he could be insensible to her"
601,COQUETRY.,"friend's fascinations, which certainly were very great. She was the"
602,COQUETRY.,"more convinced that Mr. Barclay loved Beatrice, for his manners"
603,COQUETRY.,"evidently changed, and, at times, he was absent and thoughtful, and"
604,COQUETRY.,"she sometimes fancied unhappy. Once it struck her, his affections"
605,COQUETRY.,"might be engaged elsewhere, and that Beatrice had shaken his faith to"
606,COQUETRY.,her to whom it was plighted. She observed Beatrice using all her
607,COQUETRY.,"efforts to attract and win Mr. Barclay, and yet she doubted if she"
608,COQUETRY.,"were sincere. Many things in her conduct led to this conclusion, and"
609,COQUETRY.,"showed no little coquetry in her disposition. Be it as it may, she met"
610,COQUETRY.,"Mr. Barclay's attentions more than half way, and seemed never in such"
611,COQUETRY.,"spirits as when with him; at any rate, poor Ethelind's delicacy took"
612,COQUETRY.,"the alarm, and she resolved to crush her own growing attachment in the"
613,COQUETRY.,"bud, and hide her feelings in reserve, and so great was her"
614,COQUETRY.,"self-command, that her love for Mr. Barclay, was unsuspected by all"
615,COQUETRY.,save her mother.
616,COQUETRY.,
617,COQUETRY.,"As Beatrice and Ethelind were returning one evening from a long walk,"
618,COQUETRY.,"and being very tired, they sat down on a bank facing the Towy to rest"
619,COQUETRY.,"themselves, and watch the setting sun sink behind the undulating"
620,COQUETRY.,"mountains that almost surrounded them. They were, for some minutes, so"
621,COQUETRY.,"absorbed in the scene before them, that neither spoke; at last"
622,COQUETRY.,Beatrice exclaimed:--
623,COQUETRY.,
624,COQUETRY.,"""What a pity it is, Ethelind, that you and Mr. Barclay never took it"
625,COQUETRY.,into your heads to fall in love with each other; you would make such a
626,COQUETRY.,"capital clergyman's wife."""
627,COQUETRY.,
628,COQUETRY.,"""Beatrice!"" said Ethelind, ""why talk thus; do you mean to say that you"
629,COQUETRY.,"have been insensible to his attachment to you?"""
630,COQUETRY.,
631,COQUETRY.,"""I do not mean to say that,"" replied she, ""but I can assure you, that"
632,COQUETRY.,"if there is such a feeling, it is only on his side."""
633,COQUETRY.,
634,COQUETRY.,"""And yet, you have not only received, but met his attentions with such"
635,COQUETRY.,"evident pleasure, and given him such decided encouragement."""
636,COQUETRY.,
637,COQUETRY.,"""Now, Ethy, how could I resist a flirtation with such an interesting"
638,COQUETRY.,"character?"""
639,COQUETRY.,
640,COQUETRY.,"""Oh, Beatrice, did you never think of the pain you might inflict by"
641,COQUETRY.,"leading him to suppose his affection was reciprocated."""
642,COQUETRY.,
643,COQUETRY.,"""Never, my consciencious little Ethelind, he is too poor, nay, too"
644,COQUETRY.,"good, for me to think seriously of becoming his wife."""
645,COQUETRY.,
646,COQUETRY.,"""Oh, Beatrice! I thought you had a more noble heart than to trifle"
647,COQUETRY.,"with the affections of such a man, particularly now there is a chance"
648,COQUETRY.,"of recovering your property; you might be so happy, and make him so"
649,COQUETRY.,"too."""
650,COQUETRY.,
651,COQUETRY.,"""And do, you think, if I do recover it, I should throw myself away on"
652,COQUETRY.,"a poor curate, and that I should like to lead such a quiet hum-drum"
653,COQUETRY.,"life. No, my dear girl, I was never made to appreciate such goodness"
654,COQUETRY.,"or imitate it either."""
655,COQUETRY.,
656,COQUETRY.,"""Then, of course, you will alter your conduct, ere you go too far, and"
657,COQUETRY.,"not render him wretched, perhaps for life."""
658,COQUETRY.,
659,COQUETRY.,"""Of course, I shall do no such thing, his attentions are too pleasing;"
660,COQUETRY.,"it does not appear he will be here long, so I must make the most of"
661,COQUETRY.,"the time."""
662,COQUETRY.,
663,COQUETRY.,"""Oh, Beatrice, think what havoc you may make in the happiness of a"
664,COQUETRY.,worthy man; look at his character; see his exemplary conduct; and
665,COQUETRY.,"could you, for the paltry gratification of your vanity, condemn him to"
666,COQUETRY.,"the pangs of unrequited love. He has now, I fear, the ills of poverty"
667,COQUETRY.,to struggle against; did you notice his emotion when speaking of his
668,COQUETRY.,"mother and sisters? perhaps they are dependant on him,--you must not,"
669,COQUETRY.,"shall not trifle with him thus."""
670,COQUETRY.,
671,COQUETRY.,"""And why not, dearest Ethelind; I shall really begin to suspect you"
672,COQUETRY.,"like him yourself; oh, that tell tale blush, how it becomes you."""
673,COQUETRY.,
674,COQUETRY.,"""I think,"" said Ethelind, ""any one would colour at such an"
675,COQUETRY.,"accusation."""
676,COQUETRY.,
677,COQUETRY.,"""Well then, to be honest, I have no heart to give."""
678,COQUETRY.,
679,COQUETRY.,"""No heart to give! surely you are not engaged, and act thus?"""
680,COQUETRY.,
681,COQUETRY.,"""I am, indeed."""
682,COQUETRY.,
683,COQUETRY.,"""Cruel, heartless Beatrice,"" said Ethelind, ""you cannot mean what you"
684,COQUETRY.,"say."""
685,COQUETRY.,
686,COQUETRY.,"""I do most solemnly affirm it; but I will tell you all bye and bye:"
687,COQUETRY.,"now I cannot. I am smarting too much under you severe philippic, you"
688,COQUETRY.,"shall indeed know all,--but,"" said the thoughtless girl, ""let us go"
689,COQUETRY.,"home, as your mother will be waiting tea, and Mr. Barclay with her."""
690,COQUETRY.,
691,COQUETRY.,"""How can you face one you have so injured,"" said Ethelind, ""I could"
692,COQUETRY.,"not."""
693,COQUETRY.,
694,COQUETRY.,"""When you see a little more of the world, you will call these little"
695,COQUETRY.,"flirtations very venial errors."""
696,COQUETRY.,
697,COQUETRY.,"""I hope,"" said Ethelind, ""I shall never call _wrong right_, or _right"
698,COQUETRY.,"wrong_; neither, I trust, shall I ever act as if I thought so."""
699,COQUETRY.,
700,COQUETRY.,"They reached home, and found tea ready, but Mr. Barclay was not there,"
701,COQUETRY.,"nor did he visit them that evening, but about eight o'clock Mrs."
702,COQUETRY.,"Fortescue received a note, begging her to excuse him, as he had so"
703,COQUETRY.,"much to attend to, preparatory to the family coming to the Park."
704,COQUETRY.,
705,COQUETRY.,"They saw no more of him during the week. On Sunday, he looked,"
706,COQUETRY.,"Ethelind thought, very pale. Coming out of church he spoke to her"
707,COQUETRY.,"mother, and she thought there was a tremor in his voice as he spoke,"
708,COQUETRY.,as if concealing some internal emotion. They made many conjectures as
709,COQUETRY.,"to the cause of this extraordinary conduct, but both Mrs. Fortescue"
710,COQUETRY.,"and Ethelind felt certain there must be some good reason, as caprice"
711,COQUETRY.,"had, never since they had known him, formed any part of his conduct;"
712,COQUETRY.,"they were, therefore, obliged to come to the conclusion, that if they"
713,COQUETRY.,"knew it, they would find he had good reason for his conduct."
714,COQUETRY.,
715,COQUETRY.,"To Ethelind, when he met her alone, his manner was friendly as ever,"
716,COQUETRY.,"but she fancied he had often avoided them, when she and Beatrice were"
717,COQUETRY.,together; sometimes she suspected he doubted Beatrice's sincerity. He
718,COQUETRY.,"sent books and fruit to Mrs. Fortescue, as usual, but rarely went to"
719,COQUETRY.,"the cottage, and if he did, always timed his visits, so as to go when"
720,COQUETRY.,"the younger ladies were out. He would however, saunter home with"
721,COQUETRY.,"Ethelind, if alone, after the duties of the Sunday School, and consult"
722,COQUETRY.,"her on many of his plans; in short, he daily became more like his"
723,COQUETRY.,former self.
724,COQUETRY.,
725,COQUETRY.,"The fact was, that the day on which Beatrice and Ethelind held the"
726,COQUETRY.,"discussion, he had started to meet them, but feeling tired, sat down"
727,COQUETRY.,to rest on the very same bank they afterwards occupied: but the sun
728,COQUETRY.,"shining fully on it, he had retreated behind a large tree, and having"
729,COQUETRY.,"fallen asleep, was awakened by their talking, and thus became an"
730,COQUETRY.,unintentional auditor of their conversation.
731,COQUETRY.,
732,COQUETRY.,"It was a thunderbolt to him, to hear Beatrice acknowledge herself"
733,COQUETRY.,"positively engaged, and yet wilfully resolve to encourage his"
734,COQUETRY.,"attentions, and thus trifle with his feelings. Before Beatrice came,"
735,COQUETRY.,"he had been much pleased with the unaffected manner of Ethelind, whose"
736,COQUETRY.,character he highly respected; but her reserve made him conclude she
737,COQUETRY.,"was indifferent to him, but how did she rise in his estimation, as he"
738,COQUETRY.,heard the conversation. Not a word of her advice to Beatrice was lost
739,COQUETRY.,"on him, and he only wondered he had not done her more justice; how"
740,COQUETRY.,grateful he felt for the noble indignation she expressed at her
741,COQUETRY.,"friend's levity, and the honest warmth with which she took his part,"
742,COQUETRY.,"and strove, as it were, to prevent his being betrayed by the heartless"
743,COQUETRY.,coquetry of Beatrice. He regarded all that had occurred as a special
744,COQUETRY.,intervention of Providence to save him from future misery. His regard
745,COQUETRY.,"for Beatrice was daily increasing and believing her good and amiable,"
746,COQUETRY.,"he desired to win the affection, which he fully thought was"
747,COQUETRY.,reciprocal; and how did the discovery of her treachery dash the cup of
748,COQUETRY.,happiness from his lips; but as it was because he believed her truly
749,COQUETRY.,"amiable that he loved her, he thought, now the veil was drawn aside,"
750,COQUETRY.,"he should soon get over his disappointment. But, unworthy as she was,"
751,COQUETRY.,"she had so entwined herself in his heart, that it was no easy task to"
752,COQUETRY.,"tear her image from it--however, he was strong-minded, and soon"
753,COQUETRY.,"reflected that instead of grieving, he ought to be thankful for his"
754,COQUETRY.,"escape. Ethelind saw he was wretched, and fancied Beatrice was, some"
755,COQUETRY.,"how or other, the cause. She pitied him, and prayed for him, but it"
756,COQUETRY.,was all she could do; but she was not sorry to hear Beatrice say she
757,COQUETRY.,"had an invitation to Miss Fulton's wedding, which she was determined"
758,COQUETRY.,"to accept. The night previous to her departure, Mr. Barclay, unasked,"
759,COQUETRY.,"remained to tea, and when he took leave, he put a letter into the hand"
760,COQUETRY.,"of Beatrice, which she slipped into her pocket, she thought, unseen by"
761,COQUETRY.,"any one, but Ethelind saw it, though she took no notice, nor did"
762,COQUETRY.,"Beatrice mention it Before retiring to rest, she read as follows:--"

771,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","narrowly escaped being wrecked; and that, from your own lips, I"
772,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","learnt such was the case. Believing you good and amiable, as you"
773,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","seemed, I was fascinated, and allowed my feelings to outrun my"
774,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","judgment, and yet I can hardly say that such was the case, for I"

787,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","cost me, it had passed in silence. I will candidly own, that while"
788,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","my respect is lessened, I cannot forget what my feelings towards"
789,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,",you have been. Time alone can heal the peace of mind you have so
790,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,",recklessly wounded; but I again advise you to reflect seriously on
791,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","the past, and be assured, that she who pursues such a line of"

794,"""MY DEAR MISS TREVOR,","so in the present instance, for while smarting under the bitter"

1387,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Having business at Gravesend, I arrived there late at night, and took"
1388,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,a bed at an Inn in one of the thoroughfares of that place; I retired
1389,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"early to rest, and was awakened in the morning by the sound of martial"
1390,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"music; and ever delighting in the ""soul-stirring fife and drum,"" I"
1391,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"jumped out of bed and found it was troops, about to sail for India; I"
1392,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"therefore, dressed myself and strolled down to the beach to witness"
1393,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"what, to me, was quite a novel sight, the embarkation."
1394,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1395,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"It was a clear bright morning in June, and the sun was shining in full"
1396,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"splendor, while the calm bosom of the beautiful Thames reflected back"
1397,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"all its dazzling effulgence. The river was studded with shipping, and"
1398,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"to add to the beauty of the scene, two or three East Indiamen had just"
1399,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"anchored there, and as I viewed them majestically riding, I could"
1400,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"easily fancy the various feelings their arrival would create, not only"
1401,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"in the breasts of those who were in these stately barks, but of the"
1402,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"hundreds of expectant friends, who were anxiously awaiting their"
1403,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,return. With how many momentous meetings was that day to be filled.
1404,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"How many a fond and anxious mother, who had, perhaps, for years,"
1405,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"nightly closed her eyes in praying for a beloved son, was in a few"
1406,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"hours to clasp him to the maternal breast. Here, too, might be"
1407,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"pictured, the husband and father returning, not as he left his wife"
1408,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"and children, in the vigour of health and manhood, but with his cheeks"
1409,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,pallid and his constitution enfeebled by hard service in a tropical
1410,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"climate. Some few had, doubtless, realized those gorgeous dreams of"
1411,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,affluence and greatness which first tempted them to leave their native
1412,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"land. I once knew one myself, whose hardy sinews had for nearly sixty"
1413,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"years, braved the fervid heat of the torrid sun; but he returned to"
1414,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"_endure_ life, not to _enjoy_ it. He told me, he had left England at"
1415,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"the early age of fourteen. He had, as it were, out grown his young"
1416,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,friendships. Eastern habits and associations had usurped the place of
1417,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"those domestic feelings, which his early banishment had not allowed to"
1418,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"take root, we might question if the seeds were even sown in his young"
1419,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"breast, for he was an orphan, with no other patrimony than the"
1420,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"interest of connexions, which procured him a cadetcy in the East India"
1421,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Company's Service. On his departure, he earned no parent's blessing"
1422,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"for him, no anxious father sighed, no fond indulgent mother wept and"
1423,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"prayed. As I stood musing on the scene, a gentleman, a seeming idler,"
1424,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"like myself, joined me, and after many judicious remarks on what was"
1425,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"passing around, informed me he was there to meet a widowed sister, who"
1426,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"only three years before, had gone out in the very ship in which she"
1427,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"now returned, to join her husband,--the long affianced of her early"
1428,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"choice. For a short period, she had enjoyed all earthly happiness, but"
1429,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"it was only for a brief space; for soon, alas! was she taught in the"
1430,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"school of sorrow, that this world is not our abiding place."
1431,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1432,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"But the Blue Peter,[1] gently floating in the scarcely perceptible"
1433,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"breeze, betokened the vessel from which it streamed, destined for a"
1434,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,far different purpose. It told not of restoring the fond husband to
1435,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"his wife, the father to his children, or the lover to his mistress; it"
1436,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"was, in this instance, to sever, for a time, all these endearing ties;"
1437,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"for very soon would the father, the husband, and the lover be borne"
1438,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"many miles on the trackless ocean, far, very far, from all they hold"
1439,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"dear, and some with feelings so deep and true, that for a time, not"
1440,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"all the brilliant prospects of wealth or glory, will restore their"
1441,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,spirits to their wonted tone.
1442,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1443,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,[1] A flag hoisted always when a ship is preparing to sail.
1444,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1445,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,There was one detachment which greatly struck me; it consisted of
1446,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"about one hundred and fifty fine athletic young men, who though only"
1447,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"recruits, were particularly soldier-like in appearance. There was"
1448,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"throughout, a sort of determined firmness in their countenances, which"
1449,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"seemed to say, ""Away with private feelings! we go on glory's errand,"
1450,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"and at her imperious bidding, and of her alone we think!"" Yet to"
1451,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"fancy's eye, might be read an interesting tale in every face. We might"
1452,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"trace, in all, some scarcely perceptible relaxation of muscle, that"
1453,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"would say, ""With the deportment of the _hero_, we have the feelings of"
1454,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"the _man_. One young officer was there, belonging to a different"
1455,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"regiment, who, certainly, seemed to have none of those amiable"
1456,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"weaknesses, none of those home feelings, which characterize the"
1457,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,husband or the father. He had not even pains of the lover to contend
1458,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"with. Glory was indeed _his_ mistress, the all absorbing ruling"
1459,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"passion of his mind; he dreamt not, talked not of, thought not of"
1460,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"aught, but glory!"""
1461,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1462,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Panting to distinguish himself with his corps, he would gladly have"
1463,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"annihilated time and space to have reached it, without spending so"
1464,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,many tedious months in making the voyage. Led away by his military
1465,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"ardor, he thought not of his anxious parents; little recked he of his"
1466,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"mother's sleepless nights, and how her maternal fears would fancy"
1467,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"every breeze a gale, and every gale a storm, while he was subject to"
1468,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,their influence.
1469,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1470,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Among those waiting to embark, was one who had just parted from his"
1471,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,wife and children; care and anxiety had set their marks on him. He was
1472,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"a man of domestic habits, and was now, perhaps, to be severed for"
1473,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"years, from all that gave any charm to life; but the fiat for"
1474,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"separation had gone forth, and was inevitable! Soon would immense"
1475,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"oceans roll between them; their resources, which, while they were"
1476,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"together, were barely sufficient for their wants, were now to be"
1477,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"divided; and the pang of parting, severe enough in itself, was"
1478,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"sharpened by the fear that poverty and privation might overtake them,"
1479,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,ere he could send remittances to his family.
1480,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1481,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"A post chaise now came in sight, when an officer stepped forward, as"
1482,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"it drove to the water's edge, and assisted a lady to alight from it."
1483,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,Her eyes were red with weeping and her trembling limbs seemed scarcely
1484,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"able to support her sinking frame. Her husband, for such I found he"
1485,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"was, who had gone towards the vehicle, showed little less emotion than"
1486,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"herself, which he, however, strove hard to suppress. These were"
1487,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"parents, whom each successive wave would bear still further from their"
1488,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"lovely offspring, towards whom their aching hearts would yearn, long"
1489,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"after their childish tears had ceased to flow. They, poor little"
1490,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"things, knew not the blessings they were about to lose, but their fond"
1491,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"and anxious father and mother could not forget, that they had"
1492,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"consigned them to strangers, who might or who might not be kind to"
1493,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"them, and who had too many under their care, to feel, or even show the"
1494,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,endearing tenderness that marks parental love.
1495,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1496,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"In regimental costume, also, stood one, quite aloof, and from his"
1497,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"history, (which I afterwards learnt,) I found that his position on the"
1498,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,beach corresponded with that in which he stood in the world--alone;
1499,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"cared for by none, himself indifferent to all around him; every"
1500,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,kindlier affection had withered in his breast. He was careless whither
1501,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"he went or what became of him. Yet was he not always so, for he had"
1502,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,known a parent's and a husband's love. His now blighted heart had
1503,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"often beaten with rapture, as the babe, on which he doted, first"
1504,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"lisped a father's name, taught by a mother, whose smile of affection"
1505,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"was, for years, the sun that gladdened his existence. But these bright"
1506,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,visions of happiness had all flown; that being whom he had so fondly
1507,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"loved had dishonoured him, and neglected his boy, and on his return,"
1508,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"he found one in the grave, the other living in infamy."
1509,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1510,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Among the soldiers, I noticed one, on whom not more than nineteen"
1511,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"summers had shone; nay, less than that. His light and joyous heart"
1512,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"seemed bounding with delight, as he witnessed the busy scene that met"
1513,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"his wondering eyes. An aged woman stood near him, whose blanched and"
1514,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,withered cheek but ill accorded with the cheerful look of her
1515,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"light-hearted thoughtless son. She took his hand, and sobbed out, ""Oh,"
1516,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"George, my poor boy, little thought I to see the day when I should be"
1517,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"thus forsaken; I did hope you would now have staid with me, and been a"
1518,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"comfort in my old days."""
1519,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1520,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Hush, hush! grand-mother, the boys are all looking at you. Come, now,"
1521,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"don't be blubbering so foolishly, I shall soon come back again."""
1522,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1523,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Come back again, boy! afore that day comes, these poor old bones will"
1524,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"be mouldering in the dust. But God's will be done, and may his"
1525,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"blessings be upon you; I know there must be soldiers, but oh, 'tis"
1526,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"hard, so very hard, to part with one's only child. Oh, after the care"
1527,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"I have taken to bring you up decently, to lose you thus; and how I"
1528,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"worked, day and night, to buy you off before, and yet you listed"
1529,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"again, though a month had not passed over your head. God help me,"""
1530,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"said she sighing, ""for even this trial could not be without God's"
1531,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"will, for without that, not a sparrow could fell to the ground. But"
1532,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"stay, do wait a bit longer,"" said she, catching him by the belt, as he"
1533,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,was manifesting a restless impatience to join the busy throng.
1534,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1535,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""You will promise to write to me, George, you will not forget that?"""
1536,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1537,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Yes, yes, to be sure, mother, I'll write."""
1538,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1539,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"The sergeant now began to call the muster roll, and the poor old"
1540,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,creature's cheek grew whiter still as the lad exclaimed:
1541,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1542,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Now, mother, I must fall into the ranks; good bye, good bye."""
1543,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1544,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""May God Almighty preserve thee, my child; you may one day be a parent"
1545,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"yourself, and will then know what your poor old grandmother feels this"
1546,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"day."""
1547,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1548,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"The lad had by this time passed muster, and was soon after on board."
1549,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"The afflicted grand-mother stood, with her eyes transfixed on the"
1550,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"vessel, gazing on her unheeding boy, who, insensible to the agonizing"
1551,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"feelings that rent her breast, felt not one single throe of regret,"
1552,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"his mind being entirely engrossed in contemplating the bright future,"
1553,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"which the sergeant, who enlisted him, had drawn."
1554,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1555,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Captain Ormsby, who commanded the detachment, was a man of feeling; he"
1556,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,had particularly noticed the poor woman's distress.
1557,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1558,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Be comforted,"" said he, ""I will watch over the lad, for your sake,"
1559,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"and will try and take him under my immediate charge, and if he behaves"
1560,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"well, I may be able to serve him. I will see that he writes to you."""
1561,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1562,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Heaven bless and reward your honour,"" she exclaimed, ""surely you are"
1563,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"a parent yourself. Oh, yes, I knew it,"" said she, as she saw him wipe"
1564,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"off the starting tear. ""May God spare you such a trial as has this day"
1565,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"been my lot."""
1566,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1567,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Thank you, thank you, my good woman,"" said he hardly able to speak."
1568,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1569,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"She had touched a tender chord, and its vibration shook his very"
1570,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"frame, for he had in the last few days, taken leave of four motherless"
1571,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"girls, pledges of love by a wife whom he had fondly loved, and of whom"
1572,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,he had been suddenly bereaved. Well might he feel for this poor
1573,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"wretch, for _he_ had known parting in all its bitterness."
1574,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1575,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"A soldier and his wife stood side by side, apparently ready to embark,"
1576,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"whose looks told unutterable things; they both seemed young, but their"
1577,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,faces betokened the extreme of agony. The name of Patrick Morgan being
1578,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"called, the distracted wife clung to her husband, uttering the most"
1579,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,piercing and heartrending cries.
1580,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1581,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Sure, and what'll become of me,"" cried she, ""will you then lave me,"
1582,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Pat, dear, lave your own poor Norah to die, as, sure I will, when you"
1583,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"go in that big ship? Oh, my dear Captain, and where will I go if your"
1584,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"honour isn't plazed to go without him this time? Oh, do forgive me,"
1585,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"but do not, oh, do not, in pity, part us. Sure, an' its your honours"
1586,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,dear self as knows what it is to part from them ye loves; an' so you
1587,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"thought, when ye tuk lave of the dear childer, t'other day, an' saw"
1588,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"the mother's swate face, God rest her sowl, in the biggest of 'em, for"
1589,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"sure they're like, as two pays in a bushel, only one is little an'"
1590,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"t'other big, barring she's in heaven. Sure, and if your honour's self"
1591,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"had to bid 'em good bye over agin you'd, may be, think how hard it was"
1592,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"for me to stay behind when Pat goes."""
1593,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1594,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Patrick, who, with national keen-sightedness, saw the internal working"
1595,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"which his wife's home appeal had created, now came forward, and said,"
1596,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Oh, yer honour, if as how I dare be so bowld as jist to ax you this"
1597,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"wan'st, to take compassion on us; may be, next time, we could go"
1598,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"together, and if Norah was but wid me, what do I care where I goes."
1599,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Here's Jem O'Connor wouldn't mind going in my stead, and he's neither"
1600,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"wife, as I have, nor childer, like your honour to part from."" Jem"
1601,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,O'Conner now came forward and testified his readiness to go all the
1602,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,world over to serve a comrade.
1603,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1604,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,Words could but poorly convey an idea of the looks of the anxious
1605,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"couple, as they watched the varying countenance of the Captain. The"
1606,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"situation of the soldier and his wife touched him to the quick, and"
1607,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,the appeal proved irresistible. Jem O'Connor was permitted to go
1608,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"instead of Pat. Morgan, who, triumphantly led off his wife, both of"
1609,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"them invoking blessings on his head, whose humanity had thus spared"
1610,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,them the pangs of separation.
1611,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1612,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"I stood, perhaps, twenty minutes musing on the scenes that had just"
1613,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"been passing before me and was returning, to retrace my steps to the"
1614,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"inn breakfast, when I noticed a wretched looking woman, with a baby in"
1615,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"her arms. She was walking very fast, towards the water's edge, where"
1616,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,the boats were still waiting to take the last of the soldiers on board
1617,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"ship. She had an anxious, nay, a despairing look as she looked around,"
1618,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"as I judged, for the Captain, who was not to be seen."
1619,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1620,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"Hushing her little one, whose piteous cry would almost have made one"
1621,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,think it was uttered in sympathy with its mother's distress. Casting
1622,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"one more despairing glance, she was, apparently, about to retrace her"
1623,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"weary steps with a look that completely baffles description, when her"
1624,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"eye fell on a boat returning from the vessel, which that moment neared"
1625,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"the water's edge, and she saw Captain Ormsby jump out. Hastily going"
1626,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"up to him, she exclaimed, in a tone that seemed almost to forbid"
1627,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,comfort.
1628,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1629,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Oh, Sir, I am ashamed to be so troublesome, indeed I am, and I fear"
1630,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"to ask you if I have any chance this time?"""
1631,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,
1632,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Why Kitty, my good girl, had you asked me that question half, nay, a"
1633,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"quarter of an hour ago, I could not have given you any hope, but I can"

1637,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"""Sergeant Browne,"" cried he, ""here is Hewson's wife, who went out in"
1638,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"the 'Boyne.' Do the best you can for her, she can take Hetty Brennan's"

1640,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,"lad who was holding a small deal box, which he placed beside her; but"
1641,AN EMBARKATION SCENE.,she seemed as if she could hardly believe herself about to follow her

1678,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And how he smote the Campbell clan
1679,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,By Inverlocky's shore.
1680,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,I've told thee how we swept Dundee
1681,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And tamed the Lindsay's pride;
1682,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,But never have I told thee yet
1683,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,How the great Marquis died.
1684,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1685,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,A traitor sold him to his foes:
1686,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Oh, deed of deathless shame!"
1687,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"I charge thee, boy, if e'er thou meet"
1688,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"With one of Assynt's name,"
1689,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Be it upon the mountain side,"
1690,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Or yet within the glen,"
1691,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Stand he in martial gear alone,"
1692,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Or backed by armed men;
1693,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Face him as thou wouldst face a man
1694,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,That wronged thy sire's renown;
1695,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Remember of what blood thou art,"
1696,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And strike the caitiff down
1697,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1698,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,They brought him to the watergate
1699,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Hard bound, with hempen span."
1700,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"As though they held a lion there,"
1701,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And not a 'fenceless man:
1702,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"They set him high upon a cart,"
1703,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The hangman rode below,"
1704,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,They drew his hands behind his back
1705,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And bared his noble brow.
1706,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Then as a hound is slipped from leash
1707,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"They cheered the common throng,"
1708,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And blew the note with yell and shout
1709,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And bade him pass along.
1710,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1711,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,It would have made a brave man's heart
1712,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Grow sad and sick that day,"
1713,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,To watch the keen malignant eyes
1714,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Bent down on that array.
1715,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,There stood the whig west country lord
1716,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,In Balcony and Bow;
1717,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,There sat three gaunt and withered Dames
1718,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And daughters in a row,"
1719,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And every open window
1720,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Was full, as full might be,"
1721,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"With black robed covenanting carles,"
1722,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,That goodly sport to see.
1723,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1724,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And when he came, so pale and wan"
1725,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"He looked, so great and High,"
1726,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"So noble was his manly front,"
1727,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"So calm his steadfast eye,"
1728,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The rabble rout, forbore to shout,"
1729,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And each man held his breath,"
1730,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,For well they knew the hero's soul
1731,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Was face to face with death.
1732,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And then a mournful shuddering
1733,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Through all the people crept,"
1734,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And some that came to scoff at him
1735,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Now turned aside and wept.
1736,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1737,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"But onward, always onward,"
1738,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"In silence and in gloom,"
1739,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The dreary pageant labored
1740,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Till it reached the house of doom.
1741,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Then first a woman's voice was heard
1742,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"In jeer and laughter loud,"
1743,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"An angry cry and hiss arose,"
1744,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,From the lips of the angry crowd.
1745,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Then as the Græme looked upward
1746,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,He saw the bitter smile
1747,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Of him who sold his king for gold,"
1748,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The master fiend Argyle.
1749,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1750,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The Marquis gazed a moment
1751,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And nothing did he say;
1752,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"But Argyle's cheek grew deadly pale,"
1753,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And he turned his eyes away.
1754,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The painted frail one by his side,"
1755,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"She shook through every limb,"
1756,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"For warlike thunder swept the streets,"
1757,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And hands were clenched at him,"
1758,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And a Saxon soldier cried, aloud,"
1759,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Back coward, from thy place!"
1760,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,For seven long years thou hast not dared
1761,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,To look him in the face!
1762,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1763,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Had I been there with sword in hand
1764,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And fifty Cameron's by,"
1765,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"That day, through high Dunadin's streets,"
1766,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Had pealed the Slogan cry
1767,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Not all their troops of trampling horse,"
1768,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Nor might of mailed men;
1769,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Nor all the rebels of the South
1770,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Had borne us backward then.
1771,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Once more his, foot on highland heath"
1772,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Had trod, as free as air,"
1773,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Or I and all who bore my name,"
1774,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Been laid around him there.
1775,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1776,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"It might not be! they placed him next,"
1777,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Within the solemn hall,"
1778,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Where once the Scottish kings were throned
1779,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Amidst their nobles all.
1780,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,But there was dust of vulgar feet
1781,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,On that polluted floor
1782,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And perjured traitors filled the place,"
1783,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Where good men sat before.
1784,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"With savage glee came there,"
1785,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,To read the murderous doom
1786,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And then up rose the great Montrose
1787,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"In the middle of the room,--"
1788,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1789,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Now by my faith as belted knight,"
1790,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And by the name I bear,"
1791,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And by the bright St. Andrew's Cross,"
1792,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,That waves above us there;
1793,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Yea, by a greater mightier oath,"
1794,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And oh! that such should be--
1795,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"By that dark stream of royal blood,"
1796,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"That lies 'twixt you and me,"
1797,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,I have not sought in battle field
1798,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"A wreath of such renown,"
1799,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Or dared to hope my dying day
1800,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Would win a martyr's crown.
1801,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1802,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There is a chamber far away,"
1803,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Where sleeps the good and brave
1804,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,But a better place ye have named for me
1805,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Than by my fathers grave,"
1806,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,For truth and right 'gainst treason's might
1807,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"This hand has always striven,"
1808,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And ye raise it up for a witness still
1809,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,For the eye of earth and heaven.
1810,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Then nail my heart on yonder tower,"
1811,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Give every town a limb
1812,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And God who made, shall gather them;--"
1813,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,I go from you to him!
1814,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1815,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The morning dawned full darkly,"
1816,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The rain came flashing down
1817,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And the forky streak of lightning's bolt,"
1818,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Lit up the gloomy town.
1819,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The thunders' crashed across the heaven,"
1820,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The fatal hour was come;
1821,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Yet aye broke in with muffled beat
1822,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The 'larum of the drum:
1823,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There was madness on the earth below,"
1824,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And anger in the sky,"
1825,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And young and old and rich and poor
1826,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Came forth to see him die.
1827,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1828,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Oh God! that ghastly gibbet,"
1829,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"How dismal 't is to see,"
1830,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The great spectral skeleton--
1831,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The ladder and the tree.
1832,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Hark! hark! the clash of arms
1833,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"The bells begin to toll,--"
1834,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,He is coming! He is coming!
1835,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,God have mercy on his soul!
1836,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"One last long peal of thunder,--"
1837,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The clouds are cleared away
1838,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And the glorious sun once more look'd down
1839,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Upon the dazzling day.
1840,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1841,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,He is coming! he is coming!--
1842,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Like a bridegroom from his room,"
1843,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Came the hero, from his prison"
1844,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,To the scaffold and the doom.
1845,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There was glory on his forehead,--"
1846,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There was lustre in his eye,"
1847,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And he never walked to battle
1848,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,More proudly than to'die.
1849,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There was colour in _his_ visage,"
1850,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Though the cheeks of all were wan,"
1851,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And they marvelled as he passed them,"
1852,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,That great and goodly man.
1853,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1854,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"He mounted up the scaffold,"
1855,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And he turned him to the crowd;
1856,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"But they dared not trust the people,"
1857,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,So he might not speak aloud.
1858,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"But he look'd up toward heaven,"
1859,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And it all was clear and blue,"
1860,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And in the liquid ether
1861,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The eye of God shone through.
1862,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Yet a black and murky battlement
1863,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Lay resting on the hill,"
1864,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"As though the thunder slept therein,"
1865,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,All else was calm and still.
1866,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1867,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Then radiant and serene he rose,"
1868,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,And cast his cloak away;
1869,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,For he had taken his latest look
1870,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Of earth and sun and day.
1871,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,
1872,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"A beam of light fell o'er him,"
1873,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Like a glory round the shriven,"
1874,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And he climbed the lofty ladder,"
1875,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,As it were a path to heaven.
1876,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"Then came a flash from out the cloud,"
1877,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And a stunning thunder's roll,"
1878,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And no man dared to look aloft,"
1879,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,Fear was on every soul.
1880,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"There was another heavy sound,"
1881,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"A hush!--and then--a groan,"
1882,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,"And darkness swept across the sky,--"
1883,THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.,The work of death was done!

1892,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1893,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"When I promised to write to you during the holidays, I little thought"
1894,MY DEAR CHARLES--,I should have so much to put in my letter. I actually fancied it would
1895,MY DEAR CHARLES--,be difficult to find enough to fill one sheet; and now I do really
1896,MY DEAR CHARLES--,believe two will not be sufficient for all I have to say: but to
1897,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"commence my story, which you must know, is a real Ghost Story! But to"
1898,MY DEAR CHARLES--,begin:--
1899,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1900,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"While we were at breakfast the other morning, papa showed mamma an"
1901,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"advertisement in the ""Times"" newspaper, remarking, at the same time,"
1902,MY DEAR CHARLES--,that it appeared just the thing he had long wanted; and that he would
1903,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"go to the Solicitor's and make enquiries, and if it seemed still"
1904,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"eligible, would go immediately and see about it. Upon asking what it"
1905,MY DEAR CHARLES--,was;
1906,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1907,MY DEAR CHARLES--,I was told it was an estate in South Wales to be disposed of; on which
1908,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"was a large commodious dwelling house, which at a trifling expence,"
1909,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"might be converted into a family mansion. It commanded, the paper"
1910,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"said, a picturesque view, with plenty of shooting and fishing.--It"
1911,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"further stated, that on one part of the grounds, were the ruins of a"
1912,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"castle, and a great deal more, in its favor, but you know the glowing"
1913,MY DEAR CHARLES--,descriptions with which these great London auctioneers always set off
1914,MY DEAR CHARLES--,any property they have to dispose of.
1915,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1916,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Papa had every reason to be satisfied, that it was what he desired; so"
1917,MY DEAR CHARLES--,it was settled he should start by railway that very evening. And you
1918,MY DEAR CHARLES--,may judge how delighted I was when he asked if I should like to
1919,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"accompany him. You may be sure I did not refuse; so we got ready, and"
1920,MY DEAR CHARLES--,started by the eight o'clock train.
1921,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1922,MY DEAR CHARLES--,We travelled all night and arrived at our destination about four next
1923,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"day. Papa thought I should sleep during the night, but I found it"
1924,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"impossible, for a gentleman, whom we met in the cars, knew the place,"
1925,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and said so much in favour of it, that I could think of nothing else,"
1926,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"but he admitted there was a drawback, and that a great prejudice"
1927,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"existed against it, which caused no little difficulty in the disposal"
1928,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"of. It was reported to be haunted, and one or two people, who had"
1929,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"bought it, had actually paid money to get off the bargain. Of course,"
1930,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"hearing this, my mind dwelt much on it, though I said nothing, lest I"
1931,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"might be suspected of being afraid. Now, you know, it is not a little,"
1932,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"frightens me at school, but I was greatly puzzled at all I heard, and"
1933,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"determined I would rally my courage. After dinner, we strolled out to"
1934,MY DEAR CHARLES--,take a look at the proposed purchase. Papa was very much pleased with
1935,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"all he saw. House, grounds, and prospect were, he said, all he could"
1936,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"wish, and not even the report of a ghost, did he consider, any"
1937,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"disadvantage, but quite the contrary, as he certainly would never else"
1938,MY DEAR CHARLES--,be able to buy it for double the sum they now asked for it.
1939,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1940,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"By the time we got back to the inn, Mrs. Davis, our landlady, had"
1941,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"learnt the purport of our visit, and we, consequently, found her in"
1942,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"great consternation. We had hardly entered, than she exclaimed:--"
1943,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1944,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Why surely, Sir, you are not going to buy Castle Hill? Why it is"
1945,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"haunted, as sure as my name is Peggy Davis!"""
1946,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1947,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well, my dear madam,"" said Papa, ""haunted or not, such is my present"
1948,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"intention."""
1949,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1950,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Why, sir, nobody can live there. Don't you know there's a ghost seen"
1951,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"there every night."""
1952,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1953,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Oh,"" replied papa, ""we shall soon, I think, send the ghost off"
1954,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"packing."""
1955,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1956,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Send a ghost off packing! really, sir, you must pardon me, but you"
1957,MY DEAR CHARLES--,are a strange gentleman. Dear! dear! why do you know that four or five
1958,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"have tried to live there and couldn't, for the ghost wouldn't let 'em."
1959,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"You may laugh, but it's a real truth, that it drove every mother's son"
1960,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"away; yes not one of them could stay."""
1961,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1962,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well, my good Mrs. Davis, we shall soon see whether I can or not; at"
1963,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"any rate I shall try."""
1964,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1965,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well you certainly are a stout-hearted gentleman, and you must please"
1966,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"remember, whatever comes of it, I warned you. Why, there was James"
1967,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Reece, a bold reckless fellow and a very wicked one into the bargain,"
1968,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"who feared nothing nor nobody, agreed, for five pounds to stay the"
1969,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"night, and was never heard of any more, and some go so far as to say,"
1970,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"his ghost has been seen alongside the others once or twice."""
1971,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1972,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""The others,"" repeated papa, ""why you don't mean to say there is more"
1973,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"than one?"""
1974,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1975,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Yes, sure sir, two or three; but 'tis no use telling you, for I"
1976,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"really think you are unbelieving as a Jew,"" and away trotted the old"
1977,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"dame, talking to herself as fast as she chatted to papa."
1978,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1979,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"The next morning, after another ineffectual effort from Mrs. Davis, to"
1980,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"persuade him to give it up, papa went and concluded, what appeared to"
1981,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"him, an excellent bargain, with the lawyer, who was too anxious to"
1982,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"serve his employer, not to try and make light of the reports, and not"
1983,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"only this, but to fix papa so, that he could not possibly retract."
1984,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1985,MY DEAR CHARLES--,He came to the Inn and dined with us. Poor Mrs. Davis appeared rather
1986,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"in awe of him; as she never spoke a word, but as she came in and out"
1987,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"with different things, she gave papa some very significant looks; but"
1988,MY DEAR CHARLES--,always behind Mr. Crawford's back. No sooner had that gentleman left
1989,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"us, than papa told me, he had made up his mind to take possession of"
1990,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"his new purchase, by passing the night in the haunted house."
1991,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1992,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Charles you are my most intimate friend; and therefore, I may open my"
1993,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"heart to you, and tell you honestly, (but mind, not a word to the other"
1994,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"boys, when we get back to school) that my heart began to fail me; I"
1995,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"know it ought not, for I had been taught better things, and should not"
1996,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"have suffered myself to have been influenced, by an ignorant old"
1997,MY DEAR CHARLES--,woman.
1998,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
1999,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"There was a bedstead left in one of the rooms, put up by a gentleman"
2000,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"who had nearly bought the place, and who, hearing such dreadful"
2001,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"stories, determined to try and pass a night there, ere he finally"
2002,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"closed:--but people said he heard such strange noises, and saw such"
2003,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"odd sights, that he ran away and never returned; the bed and bedding"
2004,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"had, the country people believed, all vanished at the bidding of the"
2005,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"ghost; indeed, some scrupled not to say, that he had himself been"
2006,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"spirited away. Papa said when _he_ heard it, that most likely he was"
2007,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"ashamed of his cowardice, and that this prevented his going again to"
2008,MY DEAR CHARLES--,the village.
2009,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2010,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Papa sent for Mr. Davis, or Griffy Davis, as his wife was pleased to"
2011,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"call him; but the old body herself came, and entreated of papa not to"
2012,MY DEAR CHARLES--,try and entice him to accompany us; for it seems that papa's cool and
2013,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"determined manner had made a great impression on Griffy, who, perhaps,"
2014,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"got more sceptical on these matters, on account of it. Mrs. Davis was"
2015,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"so importunate on the subject, that she obtained the desired"
2016,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"assurance, viz., that Griffeth Davis should not be directly or"
2017,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"indirectly tempted to encounter the ghost or ghosts, as the case might"
2018,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"be. The old man soon came, and you would have laughed to see the old"
2019,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"dame's rubicond face, with her large grey eyes, peering over his"
2020,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"shoulder; for, notwithstanding; the promise given, she had some doubts"
2021,MY DEAR CHARLES--,that he might be induced to try his prowess in the haunted chamber.
2022,MY DEAR CHARLES--,Papa asked him if he knew any strong bodied young man whom a good sum
2023,MY DEAR CHARLES--,of money would induce to accompany him and stay the night. Griffy
2024,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"scratched his head, and pondered some short time; till at length, he"
2025,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"said he knew, but one at all likely; they were he said all so plaguey"
2026,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"timerous, or timmersome I believe was the word; but he thought Davy"
2027,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Evans might go if well paid, if he were certain papa would remain too;"
2028,MY DEAR CHARLES--,but another doubt was started; Davy had talked of taking some cattle
2029,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"to a fair some miles off, and might be gone: however, it turned out,"
2030,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"that he was on hand, and agreeable to go, with the understanding, that"
2031,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"he was to have his money, even if papa was conquered by the ghost, or"
2032,MY DEAR CHARLES--,had to run for his ghostship. This was soon obviated; by papa's
2033,MY DEAR CHARLES--,depositing the money in Mrs. Davis' hands; an arrangement that seemed
2034,MY DEAR CHARLES--,to give great satisfaction to Davy. The next difficulty was the
2035,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"bedding necessary, this, as Mrs. Davis never expected to see it again,"
2036,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"had to be paid for. Davy Evans, seemed a stout stalwart fellow, who"
2037,MY DEAR CHARLES--,had rather a good countenance. Papa who had put the same question
2038,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"before; again asked, ""if he were sure he was not afraid."""
2039,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2040,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Oh no, sir,"" said Davy, ""not a bit, thank God, I never intentionally"
2041,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"harmed man, woman, or child, or wronged them, that I of, in any way,"
2042,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and therefore, I may trust in Providence, go wherever I will, and I"
2043,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"certainly ain't afraid of the ghosts up there."""
2044,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2045,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""But your courage may fail you, my friend, at the last."""
2046,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2047,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""There's nothing like trying, sir, I haven't been in these parts long;"
2048,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and I know there's strange noises to be heard, but then a little noise"
2049,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"breaks no bones and can't hurt me; and as to a ghost, why, seeing its"
2050,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"made of air, that can't do much mischief either, especially to flesh"
2051,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and blood, can it now?"""
2052,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2053,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well, my friend, we'll try the question, however, very soon,"" said my"
2054,MY DEAR CHARLES--,father.
2055,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2056,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"I must own, Charles, I again began to feel a little queer, and I think"
2057,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"papa noticed it, for he told me to please myself as to going with him"
2058,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"or staying at the inn. I was nervous, though I felt sure nothing could"
2059,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"really harm me, and then, I recollected, I should always repent, if my"
2060,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"courage failed me, so I said boldly out,"
2061,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2062,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""I shall certainly go with you, papa."""
2063,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2064,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Very well, my son, but even now, if you had rather stay behind, I do"
2065,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"promise not to reflect on you afterwards, therefore, act just as your"
2066,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"feelings prompt you. I am, myself, so fully persuaded that not"
2067,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"anything supernatural can or will harm us, that I am determined to"
2068,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"find out what can have led to such extraordinary reports."""
2069,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2070,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""But papa, do you not think ghosts are sometimes to be seen?"""
2071,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2072,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Frederic,"" said he, ""I will not pretend to say what a guilty"
2073,MY DEAR CHARLES--,conscience or over-heated imagination may have conjured up and
2074,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"fancied, but as I have neither, I do not expect to see anything"
2075,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"supernatural; but, as I said before, having heard so much about the"
2076,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"mysteries of this place, I think, that even had I not made the"
2077,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"purchase, I should like to find them out."""
2078,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2079,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""But if you see the ghost, papa, will you then believe in such"
2080,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"things?"""
2081,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2082,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Wait till, to-morrow, Fred; these are silly suppositions for a"
2083,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"religious well educated boy to make, from whom far better things might"
2084,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"be expected. Now, only reflect a moment, and then ask yourself what"
2085,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"good can these appearances do."""
2086,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2087,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"I really now began to be quite ashamed of myself, and thought I was"
2088,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"not only foolish, but wicked, in giving credence to the superstitious"
2089,MY DEAR CHARLES--,nonsense I had heard.
2090,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2091,MY DEAR CHARLES--,Mrs. Davis now coming in with some things papa had ordered to take
2092,MY DEAR CHARLES--,with him; again ventured to say she hoped he would not repent going to
2093,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Castle Hill, adding she would pay every attention to the young"
2094,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"gentleman, meaning myself, in his absence."
2095,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2096,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""If I am not mistaken, he would rather accompany me Mrs. Davis, he has"
2097,MY DEAR CHARLES--,been early taught to fear nothing but acting wickedly; and I feel very
2098,MY DEAR CHARLES--,sure be will not shrink from passing the night where I do; however he
2099,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"can please himself."""
2100,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2101,MY DEAR CHARLES--,Mrs. Davis actually looked aghast! and though I again expressed my
2102,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"readiness and determination to go, I own I was a _little, a very"
2103,MY DEAR CHARLES--,little_ afraid.
2104,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2105,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well, it must be as you please, I see you are a gentleman not very"
2106,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"soon turned, when you make up your mind to do a thing."""
2107,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2108,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""What time may we expect, this said ghost to visit us. When does it"
2109,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"usually appear?"""
2110,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2111,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Why, Sir, generally they say from twelve till two; well you may"
2112,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"smile,"" said she seeing papa unable to control his features, ""but its"
2113,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"not once I have warned you, nor twice either."""
2114,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2115,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""You have done so"" said papa ""and I feel certainly much obliged by"
2116,MY DEAR CHARLES--,your kind intentions. I always heard the Welsh were superstitious; but
2117,MY DEAR CHARLES--,could not have believed they carried it to such an extent as you do in
2118,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"this neighbourhood."""
2119,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2120,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""It may be so; but you are so very unbelieving. May be you don't"
2121,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"believe in corpse candles."""
2122,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2123,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Oh yes, when they're lighted I do."""
2124,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2125,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""And ain't they always lighted."""
2126,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2127,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""What do you mean,"" said papa, ""are they not the lights you burn"
2128,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"during the night, while a dead body lies unburied."""
2129,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2130,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Bless your innocent heart! No. The corpse candies, are seen burning"
2131,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and moving of themselves, afore people die; coming down the roads from"
2132,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"the houses they live in as a warning."""
2133,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2134,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""A warning for what my dear Mrs. Davis? what earthly purpose can they"
2135,MY DEAR CHARLES--,answer? have we not warning enough in the daily events of our lives to
2136,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"impress us with the instability of life, and yet how rarely does death"
2137,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"find us prepared."""
2138,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2139,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Well, well; you may be as unbelieving as you like, and talk as you"
2140,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"will: I shall always believe when I see a corpse candle, there'll be a"
2141,MY DEAR CHARLES--,death but just wait till you pass one night in Castle Hill; may be
2142,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"you'll tell a different story then!"""
2143,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2144,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""The long and the short of the matter, Mrs. Davis is this, I liked the"
2145,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"property, and have bought it; and am determined to reside in it if"
2146,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"God, spares my life. As to the ghost or ghosts, I am well persuaded"
2147,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"that, although some natural causes may render the house and premises"
2148,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"untenable; supernatural ones I am sure have nothing to do with it."""
2149,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2150,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Time passed on and the clock struck eight; the hour fixed on, to leave"
2151,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"the inn, for Castle Hill: when papa brought a large trunk and basket,"
2152,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"which he had tried to fix on Davy's shoulders; but strong as he was,"
2153,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"he was unable to carry them both, he therefore got a wheel barrow, for"
2154,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"the trunk; while papa and I carried the basket between us, and off we"
2155,MY DEAR CHARLES--,started. A great concourse of people were at the door; many of whom
2156,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"accompanied us to the foot of the hill, and there left us."
2157,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2158,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"We went in and took up our quarters in the room, in which was the"
2159,MY DEAR CHARLES--,bedstead and which was considered to be the most constant rendezvous
2160,MY DEAR CHARLES--,of the ghost. Davy lighted a good fire and found a table and three
2161,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"chairs one of which however proved rickety, so Davy had to seat"
2162,MY DEAR CHARLES--,himself on the trunk. To our surprise we found the bedstead not in the
2163,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"same place in which we saw it in the morning. This rather, at least so"
2164,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"I thought, astonished papa; however he made no comment on the"
2165,MY DEAR CHARLES--,circumstance.
2166,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2167,MY DEAR CHARLES--,Papa had taken care to bring a good supper; He also brought a large
2168,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"pair of pistols, and we had a blunderbuss, the latter, the property of"
2169,MY DEAR CHARLES--,our friend Davy. These with a sword he arranged to his own
2170,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"satisfaction under the pillow, and in about an hour, we sat down to a"
2171,MY DEAR CHARLES--,good and substantial supper. Davy offered to replace what was left in
2172,MY DEAR CHARLES--,the basket but papa jokingly told him to leave it for the ghost. We
2173,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"now sat for nearly an hour and a half, and except some occasional out"
2174,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"burst of merriment, as Davy told us some droll things, about the"
2175,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"ghost, which were current in the village, we were as still as we well"
2176,MY DEAR CHARLES--,could be.
2177,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2178,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"At last I got very sleepy, as well I might, for it was nearly twelve"
2179,MY DEAR CHARLES--,o'clock. Papa made me lie down and said he thought he would do so
2180,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"himself; not thinking he said, it was necessary to shew so much"
2181,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"courtesy to the ghost, as wait for it. We did not undress. Davy fixed"
2182,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"himself before the, fire and soon gave proof, that he was asleep, by"
2183,MY DEAR CHARLES--,snoring most loudly.
2184,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2185,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Mind my dear Charles, in giving you this account, that papa told me"
2186,MY DEAR CHARLES--,about it afterwards; for I had fallen asleep too.
2187,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2188,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Till five minutes to twelve all was quiet as the grave, and then"
2189,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"commenced the slamming of the doors and knockings, and thumpings, as"
2190,MY DEAR CHARLES--,if done with the instrument the paviours use to beat down the stones
2191,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"they pave with. This continued some minutes, and then the door"
2192,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"gradually opened, and a female, tall and thin, entered, dressed in an"
2193,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"old fashioned yellow brocade, with a sweeping train. Over her head was"
2194,MY DEAR CHARLES--,thrown an immense gauze veil; her features were sharp and she was very
2195,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"pale. She paused as she entered, and advancing half way from the door"
2196,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"to the bed she again made a full stop, upon which papa rose up and sat"
2197,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"on the bed, when she threw out her arms, exclaiming:"
2198,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2199,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Impious and daring mortal; why presumest thou to intrude here, where"
2200,MY DEAR CHARLES--,none like thee are permitted to come? Of all those who have attempted
2201,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"it. None have ever been left to tell the tale!"""
2202,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2203,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Indeed!"" said my father advancing towards her. ""I trust you will make"
2204,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"me an exception, however."""
2205,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2206,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Hold!"" said she ""nor dare come nigh to one, whose nature is so"
2207,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"different to thine own."""
2208,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2209,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Aye!"" said my father ""who then and what art thou?"""
2210,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2211,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Not flesh and blood as thou art; again I ask, rash mortal, why are"
2212,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"_thou_ here?"""
2213,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2214,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""I remained this night, madam, in the hopes of meeting you, that I"
2215,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"might inform you that having purchased this property, I purpose"
2216,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"residing on it, at least six months of the year, consequently, I must"
2217,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"request you and your friends, supernatural or human, to quit the place"
2218,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"altogether."""
2219,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2220,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Many before,"" said she, ""have tried, but vainly, to retain possession"
2221,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and to attempt it would be fatal."""
2222,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2223,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Enough,"" said my father drawing a pistol from a belt under his coat,"
2224,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""if you are really of a spiritual nature, my weapon will be harmless,"
2225,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"if you are not, the consequences be upon your own head."" As he spoke"
2226,MY DEAR CHARLES--,he pointed the pistol at her heart. With a courage worthy a better
2227,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"cause, she darted by him and tried one or two of the wainscot panels"
2228,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"as if seeking a private spring, which Davy who, was fully awake by"
2229,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"this time perceiving, sprang up, and caught hold of her, grasping her"
2230,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"tightly; she wrestled with him with the strength of a lioness, and but"
2231,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"for papa's help, she must have escaped; he now fired the pistol at the"
2232,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"wainscot, to show her it really contained a slug, which he thought she"
2233,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"might doubt, and taking the fellow instrument from his pocket, told"
2234,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"her it was loaded like the other and that, unless she that moment"
2235,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"really and truly confessed who and what she was, and by whom employed,"
2236,MY DEAR CHARLES--,her hours were numbered.
2237,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2238,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Trembling and almost gasping for breath, she fell on her knees and"
2239,MY DEAR CHARLES--,implored mercy.
2240,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2241,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""It can be shown,"" said my father ""only on one condition, a full"
2242,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"confession of every thing connected with your being here."""
2243,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2244,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""But,"" faltered she, ""if I do shall I be given up to _them_ and they"
2245,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"will surely kill me if I am."""
2246,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2247,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Tell the truth,"" said my father, ""and if, as I judge from your last"
2248,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"words; you are the tool of others, you shall be protected, and if"
2249,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"deserving, or even repentant, shall be cared for: but stay,"" said he,"
2250,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"pouring out a glass of wine, ""you are greatly agitated, take this and"
2251,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"then sit down. Now, if you will tell the truth, you may dismiss your"
2252,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"fears, and by making the only reparation in your power, a full"
2253,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"disclosure, you may also make a friend of me."""
2254,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2255,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Indeed Sir I will, for I feel sure you will keep your word."""
2256,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2257,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""You see before you one, who till the last few years, knew not the"
2258,MY DEAR CHARLES--,ways of sin. I was carefully and tenderly brought up some miles from
2259,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"here; but forming an acquaintance with a young man, I married him"
2260,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"against the wishes of my parents. I soon found out he was a smuggler,"
2261,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"for he brought me to these parts, where I have been compelled to act"
2262,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"the character you saw this evening, to prevent any body buying the"
2263,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"place, it being so near the sea and having a passage under ground it"
2264,MY DEAR CHARLES--,just suited for the purpose. The gang consists of six men who are all
2265,MY DEAR CHARLES--,but one gone out with a boat to fetch a cargo; the moon sets about
2266,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"half past three, when they will bring it in. Had you been here last"
2267,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"night they were all in the cave."""
2268,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2269,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Would you like to return to the paths of duty and virtue?"" asked my"
2270,MY DEAR CHARLES--,father.
2271,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2272,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Oh yes Sir, but how can I, who will now look on me, how can I leave"
2273,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"one, who though so wicked and I fear hardened in wickedness is still"
2274,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"very dear to me?"""
2275,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2276,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Only purpose to do rightly,"" said my father, and God will surely open"
2277,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"a way for you. All you have to do, is to pray to and trust in him."""
2278,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2279,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Oh Sir that is what my poor old father would say, that is just how he"
2280,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"used to talk to me;"" and she fell to crying bitterly."
2281,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2282,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""Is he still living?"""
2283,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2284,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"""He is Sir, for a letter I wrote begging his forgiveness, was returned"
2285,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"to a neighbouring post-office, only the other day."""
2286,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2287,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Papa then insisted on her taking some more refreshment, and looking at"
2288,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"his watch perceived it was nearly one o'clock: much was to be done,"
2289,MY DEAR CHARLES--,ere the smugglers returned. The woman informed him that only one then
2290,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"remained who ought to have been on the watch, to light a beacon"
2291,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"prepared in case of any danger, but that there was so little fear of"
2292,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"any thing of the kind, that he had freely indulged in spirits, of"
2293,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"which there were plenty in the cave and was now fast asleep, in a"
2294,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"state of intoxication, consequently, could be secured without any"
2295,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"difficulty. She accompanied papa and Davy to the bed, but on reaching"
2296,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"it started back with horror, and would have fallen, had not the latter"
2297,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"caught her; for the wretched being that lay before them, was her"
2298,MY DEAR CHARLES--,husband who had returned wounded and from the state of exhaustion he
2299,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"was in, it appeared dangerously so. She was alarmed, and both papa and"
2300,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"Davy were so too, least the man they expected to find had escaped, and"
2301,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"given the alarm; but it was not the case; for at a little distance,"
2302,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"they found him lying on the ground, so completely under the influence"
2303,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"of drink, that he was easily secured. Papa now concluded it better to"
2304,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"light the beacon, particularly when he learnt that doing so would"
2305,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"deter the smugglers from running their cargo, till another signal was"
2306,MY DEAR CHARLES--,given. The poor creature entreated that something might be done for
2307,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"her husband, and papa much moved by her distress, told her a surgeon"
2308,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"should be sent for, but that he did not consider it safe for either"
2309,MY DEAR CHARLES--,Davy Evans or himself to remain alone. She then pointed to a door
2310,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"which contained the arms and ammunition of the gang, in case of being"
2311,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"discovered. He secured the key of this, and then despatched Davy to"
2312,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"the village, who soon roused Griffy Davis to whom he triumphantly"
2313,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"announced the capture of the ghost, and speedily returned with several"
2314,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"of the villagers, whom he assured should be well rewarded from the"
2315,MY DEAR CHARLES--,spoils of the smugglers. The latter soon after seeing the light
2316,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"announcing danger sent a secret emissary, who finding all was"
2317,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"discovered, returned to the others, who immediately left the country;"
2318,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"and although a strict search has been made, no tidings have yet been"
2319,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"heard of them, and it is supposed they have flown to foreign parts."
2320,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2321,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"It was ludicrous to see and hear Mrs. Davis, she thought papa an"
2322,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"extraordinary man before, but now, she knew not how to express her"
2323,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"admiration of his courage and discernment even I, fell in for a share"
2324,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"of her praises. ""Who could,"" she said ""have thought it!"" indeed, every"
2325,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"one seemed surprised, and wondered they never suspected the truth, as"
2326,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"papa did, but I must leave all their surmises and curious remarks till"
2327,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"we meet, only telling you, Jenkins the wounded man lived long enough"
2328,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"to testify sincere repentance and poor Mary his wife, was restored to"
2329,MY DEAR CHARLES--,her parents through the intercession of papa who thinks she will
2330,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"now-become a respectable character. The man who was taken, was"
2331,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"doubtless more guilty than could be proved, however he was found"
2332,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"sufficiently so, to be sent to hard labour for three months in the"
2333,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"neighbouring Penitentiary. He proved to be the identical Jamie Reece,"
2334,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"who was said to have been spirited away by the ghost, but who, in"
2335,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"fact, joined the gang which had just lost one of their number."
2336,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2337,MY DEAR CHARLES--,An immense quantity of contraband goods were found secreted.
2338,MY DEAR CHARLES--,
2339,MY DEAR CHARLES--,I must now conclude this voluminous epistle and trust we shall soon
2340,MY DEAR CHARLES--,"meet, when I have a great deal more to say. And next summer you will I"

2367,LORD BYRON.,"In prime of youth, he bent his eagle eye."
2368,LORD BYRON.,"No cost was spared--what books he wished, he read;"
2369,LORD BYRON.,"What sage to hear, he heard; what scenes to see"
2370,LORD BYRON.,He saw. And first in rambling school-boy days
2371,LORD BYRON.,"Britannia's mountain walks and heath girt lakes,"
2372,LORD BYRON.,"And story telling glens, and founts, and brooks,"
2373,LORD BYRON.,"And maids as dew-drops pure and fair, his soul,"
2374,LORD BYRON.,"With grandeur filled, and melody, and love."
2375,LORD BYRON.,Then travel came and took him where he wished;
2376,LORD BYRON.,"He cities saw, and courts, and princely pomp,"
2377,LORD BYRON.,"And mused alone on ancient mountain brows,"
2378,LORD BYRON.,"And mused on battle fields, where valor fought"
2379,LORD BYRON.,"In other days: and mused on men, grey"
2380,LORD BYRON.,"With years: and drank from old and fabulous wells,"
2381,LORD BYRON.,And plucked the vine that first-born prophets plucked;
2382,LORD BYRON.,"And mused on famous tombs, and on the wave"
2383,LORD BYRON.,"Of ocean mused, and on the desert waste,"
2384,LORD BYRON.,The heavens and earth of every country; saw
2385,LORD BYRON.,"Where'er the old inspiring genii dwelt,"
2386,LORD BYRON.,"Aught that could expand, refine the soul,"
2387,LORD BYRON.,"Thither he went, and meditated there."
2388,LORD BYRON.,"He touched his harp and nations heard, entranced,"
2389,LORD BYRON.,As some vast river of unfailing source.
2390,LORD BYRON.,"Rapid, exhaustless, deep, his numbers flowed"
2391,LORD BYRON.,And ope'd new fountains in the human heart
2392,LORD BYRON.,"Where fancy halted, weary in her flight,"
2393,LORD BYRON.,"In other men, _his_ fresh as morning rose,"
2394,LORD BYRON.,"And soared untrodden heights, and seemed at home"
2395,LORD BYRON.,"Where angels bashful looked. Others, though great,"
2396,LORD BYRON.,"Beneath their arguments seemed struggling, while"
2397,LORD BYRON.,"He from above descending, stopped to touch"
2398,LORD BYRON.,"The loftiest thought, and proudly stooped as though"
2399,LORD BYRON.,It scarce deserved his verse. With nature's self
2400,LORD BYRON.,"He seemed an old acquaintance, free to jest"
2401,LORD BYRON.,"At will, with all her glorious Majesty;"
2402,LORD BYRON.,"He laid his hand upon ""the ocean's wave,"""
2403,LORD BYRON.,And played familiar with his hoary locks;
2404,LORD BYRON.,"Stood on the Alps, stood on the Apennines,"
2405,LORD BYRON.,"And with the thunder talked, as friend to friend,"
2406,LORD BYRON.,"And wove his garland of the light'ning's wing,"
2407,LORD BYRON.,"In sportive twist;--the light'ning's fiery wing,"
2408,LORD BYRON.,"Which, as the footsteps of the dreadful God,"
2409,LORD BYRON.,"Marching up the storm in vengeance, seemed"
2410,LORD BYRON.,"Then turned: and with the grasshopper, who song"
2411,LORD BYRON.,"His evening song beneath his feet, conversed,"
2412,LORD BYRON.,"Suns, moons, and stars, and clouds, his sisters were,"
2413,LORD BYRON.,"Rocks, mountains, meteors, seas, and winds, and storms,"
2414,LORD BYRON.,"His brothers; younger brothers, whom he scarce"
2415,LORD BYRON.,"As equals deemed. All passions of all men,"
2416,LORD BYRON.,"The wild, the same, the gentle, the severe;"
2417,LORD BYRON.,"All thoughts, all maxims, sacred and profane,"
2418,LORD BYRON.,"All creeds, all seasons, time, eternity:"
2419,LORD BYRON.,"All that was hated, and all that was dear,"
2420,LORD BYRON.,"All that was hoped, all that was feared by man,"
2421,LORD BYRON.,He tossed about as tempest withered leaves.
2422,LORD BYRON.,Then smiling looked upon the wreck he made.
2423,LORD BYRON.,"With terror now he froze the cowering blood,"
2424,LORD BYRON.,"And now dissolved the heart in tenderness,"
2425,LORD BYRON.,"Yet would not tremble, would not weep himself,"
2426,LORD BYRON.,"But back into his soul retired, alone."
2427,LORD BYRON.,"Dark sullen, proud, gazing contemptuously"
2428,LORD BYRON.,"On hearts and passions prostrate at his feet,"
2429,LORD BYRON.,"So ocean from the plains, his waves had late"
2430,LORD BYRON.,"To desolation swept, retired in pride,"
2431,LORD BYRON.,"Exulting in the glory of his might,"
2432,LORD BYRON.,"And seemed to mock the ruin he had wrought,"
2433,LORD BYRON.,"As some fierce comet of tremendous size,"
2434,LORD BYRON.,"To which the stars did reverence as it passed,"
2435,LORD BYRON.,"So he, through learning and through fancy took"
2436,LORD BYRON.,"His flight sublime, and on the loftiest top"
2437,LORD BYRON.,Of fame's dread mountain sat. Not soiled and worn
2438,LORD BYRON.,"As if he from the earth had labored up,"
2439,LORD BYRON.,But as some bird of heavenly plumage fair
2440,LORD BYRON.,"He looked, which down from higher regions came,"
2441,LORD BYRON.,And perched it there to see what lay beneath.
2442,LORD BYRON.,The nations gazed and wondered much and praised;
2443,LORD BYRON.,"Critics before him fell in humble plight,"
2444,LORD BYRON.,Confounded fell and made debasing signs
2445,LORD BYRON.,"To catch his eye; and stretched, and swelled themselves"
2446,LORD BYRON.,"To bursting nigh, to utter bulky words"
2447,LORD BYRON.,"Of admiration vast: and many, too"
2448,LORD BYRON.,"Many, that aimed to imitate his flight,"
2449,LORD BYRON.,"With weaker wing, unearthly fluttering made,"
2450,LORD BYRON.,And gave abundant sport to after days.
2451,LORD BYRON.,
2452,LORD BYRON.,"Great man! the nations gazed and wondered much,"
2453,LORD BYRON.,And praised and many called his evil good.
2454,LORD BYRON.,Wits wrote in favor of his wickedness;
2455,LORD BYRON.,And kings to do him honor took delight:
2456,LORD BYRON.,"Thus full of titles, flattery, honor, fame,"
2457,LORD BYRON.,"Beyond desire, beyond ambition, full;"
2458,LORD BYRON.,He died!--he died of what? of wretchedness!
2459,LORD BYRON.,"Drank every cup of joy, heard every trump"
2460,LORD BYRON.,"Of fame; drank early, deeply drank, drank draughts"
2461,LORD BYRON.,"That millions might have quenched, then died"
2462,LORD BYRON.,"Of thirst, because there was no more to drink."
2463,LORD BYRON.,"His goddess, nature, woo'd, embrac'd, enjoy'd;"
2464,LORD BYRON.,Fell from his arms abhorred!
2465,LORD BYRON.,
2466,LORD BYRON.,
2467,LORD BYRON.,
2468,LORD BYRON.,
2469,SELF-RELIANCE.,SELF-RELIANCE.
2470,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2471,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2472,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""Well, my dear Miss Willoughby, how is your mother this morning,"" said"
2473,SELF-RELIANCE.,a venerable looking clergyman as he pressed the hand of a fair young
2474,SELF-RELIANCE.,"girl, apparently, not more than eighteen. Her face was pale with"
2475,SELF-RELIANCE.,"watching, and her eyes were red with weeping, and though she seemed in"
2476,SELF-RELIANCE.,"deep distress, there was a subdued and resigned manner about her, as"
2477,SELF-RELIANCE.,she replied:
2478,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2479,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""Not any better, sir, I fear; she has had a very bad night, her cough"
2480,SELF-RELIANCE.,"has been so very troublesome."" Saying this, she opened a door which"
2481,SELF-RELIANCE.,"led to an inner apartment, into which Mr. Montgomery entered, and"
2482,SELF-RELIANCE.,"approached the bed, followed by the afflicted daughter, who now tried"
2483,SELF-RELIANCE.,"to assume a composure of manner, very foreign to her feelings, as"
2484,SELF-RELIANCE.,"faintly smiling, she exclaimed, ""Here, dear mamma, is our kind friend"
2485,SELF-RELIANCE.,"again."" The poor sufferer looked anxiously at him. Her attenuated"
2486,SELF-RELIANCE.,"frame and sharpened features told the sad tale, that consumption had"
2487,SELF-RELIANCE.,"done its work, and the hand of death was upon her."
2488,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2489,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""Well, my dear madam,"" said the good pastor, ""I will not ask if you"
2490,SELF-RELIANCE.,are better; I will only hope the same spirit of resignation to the
2491,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Divine Will fills your mind as when I left you, yesterday. Remember in"
2492,SELF-RELIANCE.,"_whom_ you trust, and for _whom_. There are never-failing promises"
2493,SELF-RELIANCE.,"recorded there,"" pointing to a Bible that lay on the bed, ""and thrice"
2494,SELF-RELIANCE.,happy are they who can rely on them in affliction's hour. I have read
2495,SELF-RELIANCE.,"them to you, and your own eye, you tell me, has often rested on them;"
2496,SELF-RELIANCE.,"you have only, therefore, to 'commit your way unto the Lord, and he"
2497,SELF-RELIANCE.,"shall bring it to pass.'"""
2498,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2499,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""Oh, yes,"" replied the suffering woman, in a feeble tone, ""I know it"
2500,SELF-RELIANCE.,all; I know He is able and willing to take care of my hapless
2501,SELF-RELIANCE.,children. I _can_ and _do_ trust them to Him; feeling sure He will
2502,SELF-RELIANCE.,"more than supply the place of the only parent left them; but, oh, my"
2503,SELF-RELIANCE.,"dear sir, convinced, as I am, of all this, it is, nevertheless, hard"
2504,SELF-RELIANCE.,"to leave them; may He forgive my weakness; but human nature is such,"
2505,SELF-RELIANCE.,"that--"" here she paused from exhaustion."
2506,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2507,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""It is, my dear madam, meant that we should do so; and trial would"
2508,SELF-RELIANCE.,"lose the object for which it is sent, did we not feel its bitterness;"
2509,SELF-RELIANCE.,"but you must try, and rejoice that you are allowed to manifest both"
2510,SELF-RELIANCE.,"faith and hope, under so severe and trying a dispensation. Let me"
2511,SELF-RELIANCE.,"entreat you to remember the many instances recorded in scripture,"
2512,SELF-RELIANCE.,where answer has been given from on high to the prayers of those who
2513,SELF-RELIANCE.,"can faithfully cling to them."" But while the worthy man strove to lead"
2514,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the sufferer beyond this sublunary sphere, his heart bled for the poor"
2515,SELF-RELIANCE.,"children she was leaving. The first blow she received, was the sudden"
2516,SELF-RELIANCE.,"news of her husband's death in the Crimea, which came to her ears so"
2517,SELF-RELIANCE.,"abruptly, that her nerves received a shock, from which she did not"
2518,SELF-RELIANCE.,"rally for months. This was followed by a letter, informing her that"
2519,SELF-RELIANCE.,some property which had been left to her a few months previous to
2520,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Captain Willoughby's departure, had been claimed by a distant branch"
2521,SELF-RELIANCE.,"of the family, as heir at law, the testamentary document being found"
2522,SELF-RELIANCE.,"invalid. These circumstances, joined to delicate health, following"
2523,SELF-RELIANCE.,"each other so quickly, proved too much for feeble nature, and she sunk"
2524,SELF-RELIANCE.,under them.
2525,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2526,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Her excellent daughter, whose fragile form seemed little calculated to"
2527,SELF-RELIANCE.,"breast the storms of adversity that now threatened her, was unwearied"
2528,SELF-RELIANCE.,in attention to her dying parent. She saw there were heavy trials
2529,SELF-RELIANCE.,"before her, and knew they could not be averted, though she could not"
2530,SELF-RELIANCE.,tell how she was to meet them; but there was a trusting feeling in her
2531,SELF-RELIANCE.,"young heart, that must ever be inseparable from a trust in God's"
2532,SELF-RELIANCE.,"over-ruling providence; and as she sat through the long nights,"
2533,SELF-RELIANCE.,"watching by her mother's bed, a thousand vague shadows of the future"
2534,SELF-RELIANCE.,"flitted before her, and many schemes offered themselves to her mind;"
2535,SELF-RELIANCE.,"she tried to drive them off, for it seemed to her sinful. She durst"
2536,SELF-RELIANCE.,"not _think_, but she could _pray_; and she did so; and oh! the"
2537,SELF-RELIANCE.,"eloquence of that simple trusting prayer, that her God would protect"
2538,SELF-RELIANCE.,"and bless her and the two young beings, whose sole dependance she was"
2539,SELF-RELIANCE.,soon to be. How widely changed was her position in a few short months!
2540,SELF-RELIANCE.,"The petted, and almost idolized child of doting parents, whose every"
2541,SELF-RELIANCE.,"wish had been anticipated, must now soon exert herself to support her"
2542,SELF-RELIANCE.,orphan brother and sister.
2543,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2544,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Mrs. Willoughby, as is often the case with those suffering from"
2545,SELF-RELIANCE.,"pulmonary affection, went off very suddenly; and now was every"
2546,SELF-RELIANCE.,threatened evil likely to burst on poor Helen's devoted head; but
2547,SELF-RELIANCE.,"though weak in the flesh, she was strong in faith. Relying, as she had"
2548,SELF-RELIANCE.,"been early led to do, on her God, she seemed to rise with fresh energy"
2549,SELF-RELIANCE.,under accumulated trials. She soothed and kissed the weeping children
2550,SELF-RELIANCE.,"by turns, but their grief was so violent, they refused to be"
2551,SELF-RELIANCE.,comforted.
2552,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2553,SELF-RELIANCE.,"The night her mother was consigned to the grave, was indeed a trying"
2554,SELF-RELIANCE.,"one to Helen. The good clergyman, who had gone back to the house after"
2555,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the funeral, now knelt in prayer with the bereaved ones, and"
2556,SELF-RELIANCE.,"commending them to the care of their Heavenly Father, took leave,"
2557,SELF-RELIANCE.,promising to be with them early next day.
2558,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2559,SELF-RELIANCE.,"""Farewell, my child,"" said he, to Helen, ""fear not for the future, for"
2560,SELF-RELIANCE.,it is a merciful and loving God who lays his rod upon you; and though
2561,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the clouds of darkness loom heavily around you, with Him nothing is"
2562,SELF-RELIANCE.,"impossible; and He could, in one moment, disperse them, if it were"
2563,SELF-RELIANCE.,better for you. May you be purified by the affliction He sends. Good
2564,SELF-RELIANCE.,"night, once more, and remember that not a sparrow falls to the ground"
2565,SELF-RELIANCE.,"unheeded by Him who made it."""
2566,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2567,SELF-RELIANCE.,"How was it that this feeble child of affliction, went to bed that"
2568,SELF-RELIANCE.,night in some degree composed? For every earthly hope seemed blighted.
2569,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Her parents, one by one were re-called; her little patrimony taken"
2570,SELF-RELIANCE.,away; and she and the little ones left almost friendless. Was it to
2571,SELF-RELIANCE.,make her the better feel where she could and must place her sole
2572,SELF-RELIANCE.,dependance? Doubtless it was. Oh! ye happy sons and daughters of
2573,SELF-RELIANCE.,"prosperity, do you read this description, which many an afflicted one"
2574,SELF-RELIANCE.,"is now realizing, with apathy? Do ye regard it as an over-wrought"
2575,SELF-RELIANCE.,scene of trial? Believe me it is no such thing. While you are
2576,SELF-RELIANCE.,"surrounded by every earthly comfort, I will say by every earthly"
2577,SELF-RELIANCE.,"luxury; lolling, perhaps, on your sofas, or in your easy chairs, your"
2578,SELF-RELIANCE.,"cup filled to overflowing with every blessing, hundreds of your fellow"
2579,SELF-RELIANCE.,"creatures, young as you, are suffering privations, you hardly like to"
2580,SELF-RELIANCE.,"_think_ of, but which they, alas! have _to bear_."
2581,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2582,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Helen rose early, refreshed by a long sleep, brought on by many nights"
2583,SELF-RELIANCE.,of broken rest. She kissed the tears off her sleeping brother and
2584,SELF-RELIANCE.,"sister's cheeks, and having recommended herself and them to God,"
2585,SELF-RELIANCE.,proceeded to commence the arduous duties that now devolved on her.
2586,SELF-RELIANCE.,"When Mr. Montgomery came, he found her doing that which he was about"
2587,SELF-RELIANCE.,"to suggest, viz., preparing for an immediate sale of the furniture, by"
2588,SELF-RELIANCE.,"taking an inventory, while the faithful servant was busily employed"
2589,SELF-RELIANCE.,"cleaning the house, for which a tenant was luckily found. The two"
2590,SELF-RELIANCE.,young ones were doing their best to aid their sister. Mr. Montgomery
2591,SELF-RELIANCE.,"wished them sent to the vicarage, but Helen would not hear of it till"
2592,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the day of, or after the sale. Well has it been said, that God tempers"
2593,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the wind to the shorn lamb; and so did she find it; for on applying,"
2594,SELF-RELIANCE.,"through Mr. Montgomery, to a neighbouring auctioneer, he,"
2595,SELF-RELIANCE.,"gratuitously, attended, and did all in his power to dispose of the"
2596,SELF-RELIANCE.,things to advantage. Mr. Willoughby had taken the house on coming into
2597,SELF-RELIANCE.,"possession of the property and furnished it throughout, so that being"
2598,SELF-RELIANCE.,"in good order, most of the furniture fetched a fair price. The day"
2599,SELF-RELIANCE.,after Mrs. Willoughby died Mr. Montgomery had written to a sister of
2600,SELF-RELIANCE.,"his, who lived twenty miles off, to enquire for a small house, should"
2601,SELF-RELIANCE.,there be such in her neighbourhood. She sent word there was a cottage
2602,SELF-RELIANCE.,"in the suburbs, which she thought would just suit, and, therefore, had"
2603,SELF-RELIANCE.,"taken it for one year certain, it being a very moderate rent. Although"
2604,SELF-RELIANCE.,"greater part of the things sold, had obtained a fair price, there were"
2605,SELF-RELIANCE.,"several useful articles that would have gone for little, and but for"
2606,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the good clergyman, have been completely sacrificed, these he bought"
2607,SELF-RELIANCE.,in; among them was a large carpet and the piano; he thought they
2608,SELF-RELIANCE.,"might, if the money were needed, be privately and more advantageously"
2609,SELF-RELIANCE.,"disposed of. The funeral expenses were, comparatively, small; for"
2610,SELF-RELIANCE.,"although Helen desired to pay every respect to her mother's memory,"
2611,SELF-RELIANCE.,"Mr. Montgomery convinced her it was an imperative duty on her, to"
2612,SELF-RELIANCE.,"avoid unnecessary expenditure, as she knew not what calls might yet be"
2613,SELF-RELIANCE.,made on her resources. It next became a consideration how the things
2614,SELF-RELIANCE.,"reserved from the sale, could be got, with the least expense, to their"
2615,SELF-RELIANCE.,new place of residence; but Nancy who was present said there was a
2616,SELF-RELIANCE.,"distant relative of hers, a farmer, who volunteered to take them in"
2617,SELF-RELIANCE.,"his large waggon, which he said, by starting at midnight, could be"
2618,SELF-RELIANCE.,"accomplished in one day, and as it was anything but a busy time, he"
2619,SELF-RELIANCE.,"could do it with little loss; added to which, he expressed himself"
2620,SELF-RELIANCE.,"right glad to be able to serve a young lady, who, with her mother, had"
2621,SELF-RELIANCE.,"been so uncommonly kind to his only parent, during a long illness."
2622,SELF-RELIANCE.,When did a good action ever lose its reward? Helen thankfully accepted
2623,SELF-RELIANCE.,Mr. Montgomery's kind offer of taking the young ones to stay with him
2624,SELF-RELIANCE.,"till she was settled in their new abode, but Henry would not hear of"
2625,SELF-RELIANCE.,it; he insisted on remaining with his sister and doing all he could to
2626,SELF-RELIANCE.,"help her. So that not liking to leave Fanny alone, it was agreed they"
2627,SELF-RELIANCE.,"both should accompany her. She was not sorry for this, as she thought"
2628,SELF-RELIANCE.,the bustle and novelty would divert their minds from their sorrow; for
2629,SELF-RELIANCE.,"herself, so much was required of her, both to think and to do, that"
2630,SELF-RELIANCE.,she had no time to dwell on the desolation of her position.
2631,SELF-RELIANCE.,
2632,SELF-RELIANCE.,"I must not here forget to state, that, though only eighteen, Helen had"
2633,SELF-RELIANCE.,experienced other troubles than those which now bowed her down; and
2634,SELF-RELIANCE.,"they were such as the youthful mind ever feels most keenly. She had,"
2635,SELF-RELIANCE.,"with the sanction of her parents, been engaged to Edward Cranston; he"
2636,SELF-RELIANCE.,"was himself considered unexceptionable, and the match was thought a"
2637,SELF-RELIANCE.,"very eligible one; he was five years Helen's senior, and had just"
2638,SELF-RELIANCE.,"entered the practice of the law, with every prospect of being called"
2639,SELF-RELIANCE.,to the bar. He was first attracted by her beauty and afterwards won by
2640,SELF-RELIANCE.,"her amiable and pleasing manner. Idolized by his own family, where she"
2641,SELF-RELIANCE.,"first met him, and unremitting in his attention to herself, she soon"
2642,SELF-RELIANCE.,"felt attached, and, confidingly, plighted her troth, and all seemed"
2643,SELF-RELIANCE.,"the _couleur de rose_. His stay was some time prolonged, but he had,"
2644,SELF-RELIANCE.,"at length, to leave; it was a hard struggle to him to part from her;"
2645,SELF-RELIANCE.,and he did not do so without many promises of fidelity. To see him
2646,SELF-RELIANCE.,"leave her, was the first trial she knew. The pang was severe; but his"
2647,SELF-RELIANCE.,"devotion was such, that she doubted not his faith, and most"
2648,SELF-RELIANCE.,indignantly would she have repudiated the idea that his love for her
2649,SELF-RELIANCE.,"could lessen; but his disposition was naturally volatile, and once"
2650,SELF-RELIANCE.,"away from her, and within the blandishments of other beauty, he could"
2651,SELF-RELIANCE.,not resist its power. He became enslaved by the fascinations of
2652,SELF-RELIANCE.,"another, and poor Helen was almost forgotten. Painfully did the"
2653,SELF-RELIANCE.,"conviction force itself upon her, as his letters became first, less"
2654,SELF-RELIANCE.,"frequent, and then less affectionate. Love is generally quicksighted;"
2655,SELF-RELIANCE.,"but Helen's own heart was so pure, and so devoted, that it was hard to"
2656,SELF-RELIANCE.,"believe she was no longer beloved. Hers was, indeed, a delicate"
2657,SELF-RELIANCE.,position. She noticed the alteration in Edward Cranston's style of
2658,SELF-RELIANCE.,"writing, and fancied it proceeded from any cause but diminution of"
2659,SELF-RELIANCE.,"regard for her; that, she thought, could not be possible; but soon,"
2660,SELF-RELIANCE.,"alas! did she learn, the (to her) sad truth, that her affianced lover"
2661,SELF-RELIANCE.,"was devoted to another, a most beautiful girl, residing in the same"
2662,SELF-RELIANCE.,"town, and it was said, they were engaged, and too true were the"
2663,SELF-RELIANCE.,"reports, which the following letter confirmed."

2698,"""EDWARD.""","keenly in these matters,--females in particular,--and, if"

2705,"""EDWARD.""","the heart is _her world_; it is there, her ambition strives for"

2707,"""EDWARD.""","her sympathies on adventures, and embarks her all in the traffic of"
2708,"""EDWARD.""","affection, and, if shipwrecked, unless she be strongly supported by"
2709,"""EDWARD.""","religious principles, it is a complete bankruptcy of her happiness."""
2710,"""EDWARD.""",
2711,"""EDWARD.""","But let the young remember, there is often in these disappointments,"
2712,"""EDWARD.""","so hard to meet, the most wholesome and salutary chastenings. How very"

2714,"""EDWARD.""","all directing hand of providence, that, by a blasting of their"
2715,"""EDWARD.""","seemingly fair prospects, they are directed to happier fate, than"
2716,"""EDWARD.""",their own inexperience would lead them. How often does their Heavenly
2717,"""EDWARD.""","Father manifest his care, by leading them from the shoals and rocks of"

2719,"""EDWARD.""",from the anxious eye of parental vigilance.
2720,"""EDWARD.""",
2721,"""EDWARD.""","When Helen had paid the funeral expenses and some trifling debts, she"
2722,"""EDWARD.""",found she had but a small sum left. It was now her all for the present
2723,"""EDWARD.""",support of three individuals; and for the future? poor girl! did she
2724,"""EDWARD.""",think of that? it did indeed cross her mind; but she suppressed the
2725,"""EDWARD.""",murmuring sigh that arose; and her beloved mother's precepts were
2726,"""EDWARD.""","remembered, and her injunctions, that in every trial, she would cling"
2727,"""EDWARD.""","to her God for help. And truly, and wonderfully was this lone girl"
2728,"""EDWARD.""",supported; and almost superhuman were the efforts she was enabled to
2729,"""EDWARD.""","make. Fortunately, much manual labour was saved by the faithful"
2730,"""EDWARD.""","servant, Nancy, whom no entreaties could force to quit. She insisted"
2731,"""EDWARD.""",on accompanying the children of her beloved mistress to their new
2732,"""EDWARD.""","home. She, therefore, went with the waggon, and the next day, Mr."
2733,"""EDWARD.""",Montgomery drove the three young ones to their destination. They were
2734,"""EDWARD.""","to spend the first night with Mrs. Cameron, whom Helen found the"
2735,"""EDWARD.""","counterpart of her worthy brother. Less refined in manner, it is true,"
2736,"""EDWARD.""","and with few advantages of education, but she had much common sense,"
2737,"""EDWARD.""","and a most benevolent disposition, and was able to judge most sensibly"
2738,"""EDWARD.""",of things passing around her. Greatly prepossessed by all she had
2739,"""EDWARD.""","heard of Helen, she received her with the warmth of an old friend."
2740,"""EDWARD.""",Little Henry soon became an especial favourite; he was delighted with
2741,"""EDWARD.""","the change, and the natural buoyancy of his disposition, soon led him"
2742,"""EDWARD.""","to forget past sorrows; the farm yard, the garden, the promised"
2743,"""EDWARD.""","fishing from the neighbouring trout stream, were all novelties that"
2744,"""EDWARD.""","enchanted him. Nancy was up early, and with the aid of Mrs. Cameron's"
2745,"""EDWARD.""","servant, had got nearly everything into the different rooms, ere that"
2746,"""EDWARD.""","lady and Helen could get there. The cottage was very small, but nature"
2747,"""EDWARD.""","had done much for the situation, which was indeed beautiful. There was"
2748,"""EDWARD.""","a small bed room off Helen's that was exactly the thing for Henry, and"
2749,"""EDWARD.""","a back one, which Nancy took for granted would be hers, and had,"
2750,"""EDWARD.""","accordingly, put all her things in it."
2751,"""EDWARD.""",
2752,"""EDWARD.""","Everything was soon nicely arranged, and but little had to be bought."
2753,"""EDWARD.""","Mrs. Cameron sent a great many things from her house that, she said,"
2754,"""EDWARD.""","were superfluous, causing much extra trouble to keep in order. This,"
2755,"""EDWARD.""","Helen knew, was only intended to lessen the sense of obligation."
2756,"""EDWARD.""","Naturally active in her habits, she soon made the little place"
2757,"""EDWARD.""","comfortable, and while she thought how different it was, to what she"
2758,"""EDWARD.""","had been used to, she also remembered how much better it was, far"
2759,"""EDWARD.""",better than she could expect under existing circumstances.
2760,"""EDWARD.""",
2761,"""EDWARD.""",Her next consideration was the possibility of getting something to do
2762,"""EDWARD.""",for their support before their little money was expended. She
2763,"""EDWARD.""","consulted with Mrs. Cameron, as to the probability of obtaining"
2764,"""EDWARD.""","needlework, at which she was very expert; though she feared the"
2765,"""EDWARD.""","confinement might injure her health, of which, it behoved, her to take"
2766,"""EDWARD.""","especial care, for the sake of little Fanny and Henry. However, if any"
2767,"""EDWARD.""","could be obtained, at once, she resolved to take it, till she could"
2768,"""EDWARD.""",fix on something else; and early the next day Mrs. Cameron called to
2769,"""EDWARD.""","say, Mrs. Sherman, the Doctor's wife, would have some ready, if Miss"
2770,"""EDWARD.""","Willoughby would call at three in the afternoon. Helen's pride rose,"
2771,"""EDWARD.""","and her heart beat high; was she to go for it herself? She, for the"
2772,"""EDWARD.""","moment, revolted at the idea; but principle soon came to her aid, and"
2773,"""EDWARD.""",she accused herself of want of moral courage.
2774,"""EDWARD.""",
2775,"""EDWARD.""","""What!"" said she to Mrs. Cameron, ""has it pleased God to place me in a"
2776,"""EDWARD.""","position, at which I dare to murmur? oh, my dear friend, what would my"
2777,"""EDWARD.""","beloved mother say, could she witness my foolish struggle between"
2778,"""EDWARD.""","principle and pride. Were it not for my good, should I be called on to"
2779,"""EDWARD.""","do it?"""
2780,"""EDWARD.""",
2781,"""EDWARD.""","""No, my dear girl; and that Being who sees principle triumph, will"
2782,"""EDWARD.""","reward it. Go then, my child; you see and feel what you ought to do,"
2783,"""EDWARD.""","therefore, act up to it. It is only when the right path is rugged,"
2784,"""EDWARD.""","there is any merit in walking in it."""
2785,"""EDWARD.""",
2786,"""EDWARD.""","""You are right, my excellent friend; may God direct this rebellious"
2787,"""EDWARD.""","heart of mine. Oh, how unlike am I to that dear departed one,"
2788,"""EDWARD.""","who,----"" here she burst into tears. Mrs. Cameron now rose to go, and"
2789,"""EDWARD.""",Helen promised to call after she had been to Mrs. Sherman's.
2790,"""EDWARD.""",
2791,"""EDWARD.""","In the afternoon, she dressed herself to go for the work. Her deep"
2792,"""EDWARD.""","mourning added, if possible, to her lady-like appearance. When in"
2793,"""EDWARD.""","health, she was extremely lovely; but it was a beauty, one can hardly"
2794,"""EDWARD.""","describe, since it arose not from regularity of feature. Suffice it to"
2795,"""EDWARD.""","say, she found Mrs. Sherman alone, who received her, not only kindly,"
2796,"""EDWARD.""","but with a degree of feeling and respect, that is rarely accorded"
2797,"""EDWARD.""","those, whom adversity has depressed. She apologized for not having"
2798,"""EDWARD.""","sent the work, and said, that indisposition, alone, induced her to"
2799,"""EDWARD.""","trouble Helen to call for the directions as to making the shirts,"
2800,"""EDWARD.""",about which the doctor was very particular. While pointing out how
2801,"""EDWARD.""","they were to be done, a little girl, about eleven, burst into the"
2802,"""EDWARD.""","room, and threw herself on the sofa. On her mother desiring her to"
2803,"""EDWARD.""","leave, she cried out in a wayward tone, ""No, I shan't, I want to stay"
2804,"""EDWARD.""","here, because I like it, and I will, too; papa would let me if he was"
2805,"""EDWARD.""","at home, and if you turn me out, I'll tell him, so I will."""
2806,"""EDWARD.""",
2807,"""EDWARD.""","""Susan, my child, you must, indeed you must leave me, I want to speak"

2812,"""EDWARD.""",
2813,"""EDWARD.""","""Fie! my dear, how can you act thus perversely,"" said Mrs. Sherman, as"
2814,"""EDWARD.""","she forcibly led her to the door, which had no sooner closed on the"
2815,"""EDWARD.""","petulant child, than she apologized, with much feeling, and seemed"
2816,"""EDWARD.""","greatly mortified at this _contre temps_ of her little girl. ""In fact,"
2817,"""EDWARD.""","my dear Miss Willoughby,"" she said, ""she is, with several others,"
2818,"""EDWARD.""","running almost wild, for want of a good school in the place."""
2819,"""EDWARD.""",
2820,"""EDWARD.""","""Oh, madam!"" cried Helen, in almost breathless haste, ""do you say a"

2822,"""EDWARD.""","I were deemed capable, which I feel I am; for my beloved mother spared"
2823,"""EDWARD.""","no pains in grounding me thoroughly in the essential points, and, for"
2824,"""EDWARD.""","accomplishments, I have had the best masters."""
2825,"""EDWARD.""",
2826,"""EDWARD.""","""Indeed!"" said Mrs. Sherman, ""could you undertake to impart the"

2828,"""EDWARD.""",
2829,"""EDWARD.""","""I am sure I could,"" said Helen, blushing as she spoke, at the idea of"

2836,"""EDWARD.""","""Oh,"" replied the enthusiastic girl, cheered by these opening"

2841,"""EDWARD.""","""It is, indeed, a lucky thought, my dear Miss Willoughby, and may be,"

2844,"""EDWARD.""",
2845,"""EDWARD.""","""Indeed! indeed! I will be both. Only permit me to make the trial,"""

2851,"""EDWARD.""","you could not manage to get your room in order by Monday, could you?"""
2852,"""EDWARD.""",
2853,"""EDWARD.""","""At any rate,"" said Helen, ""I would take the few who would attend, at"

2855,"""EDWARD.""",
2856,"""EDWARD.""","Helen, then after thanking Mrs. Sherman for the suggestion, rose to"

2858,"""EDWARD.""","insight into her plans and capability, before she ventured to"
2859,"""EDWARD.""","recommend her to others; and she wished that her husband the Doctor,"
2860,"""EDWARD.""","should see and converse with Helen, for whom she began to feel great"
2861,"""EDWARD.""","interest, as she had much reliance on his judgment, and penetration"
2862,"""EDWARD.""",into character. Having gleaned from the early part of her conversation
2863,"""EDWARD.""","with Mrs. Sherman, her anxiety about the shirts, which were a new, and"
2864,"""EDWARD.""","difficult pattern, Helen insisted on taking and doing them at her"

2866,"""EDWARD.""",
2867,"""EDWARD.""","In returning home, she called, agreeably to her promise, on Mrs."

2871,"""EDWARD.""","""See, my dear Miss Willoughby,"" said she, ""how your conduct was"
2872,"""EDWARD.""","rewarded, as I was sure it would be, for adhering to the right. Had"
2873,"""EDWARD.""","you sent Nancy for the work, perhaps you would never have got it, and"
2874,"""EDWARD.""",your qualification as a teacher might never been known. Was there not
2875,"""EDWARD.""","my dear Helen, a special providence here? yes indeed there was."""
2876,"""EDWARD.""",
2877,"""EDWARD.""","Here, I must beg to digress a little, to urge the advantage of a"
2878,"""EDWARD.""","thorough education; which can never be too highly appreciated, or too"
2879,"""EDWARD.""","strongly enforced. Under any reverse of fortune, who can calculate on"
2880,"""EDWARD.""",the benefits? to say nothing of the gratification it affords in so
2881,"""EDWARD.""","many ways. ""Knowledge is power,"" and always secures its possessor, a"
2882,"""EDWARD.""","degree of influence, that wealth can never command. Oh! would that all"
2883,"""EDWARD.""","mothers, as well as daughters, could but be duly impressed, with a"
2884,"""EDWARD.""","sense of its _vital_ importance. Then we should not see girls, day"
2885,"""EDWARD.""","after day, permitted on any frivolous excuse, to absent themselves"
2886,"""EDWARD.""","from school: for if time be so truly valuable, as we know it really"
2887,"""EDWARD.""","is; how doubly, nay trebly, is it, in the period devoted to education."
2888,"""EDWARD.""","If we could only rightly reflect, on the true end of education, this"
2889,"""EDWARD.""",serious waste could never be. What is it I ask? is it merely to
2890,"""EDWARD.""","acquire a certain amount of rudimental information, and perhaps a"
2891,"""EDWARD.""",superficial acquaintance with showy accomplishments? assuredly not: it
2892,"""EDWARD.""","is to learn how to think rightly, that we may by thinking rightly,"
2893,"""EDWARD.""",know how to act so. Rudimental instruction is necessarily the
2894,"""EDWARD.""","foundation; and as such, must be duly and _fully_ appreciated; but it"
2895,"""EDWARD.""","is the _application_ of knowledge that education is meant to teach,"
2896,"""EDWARD.""","and this must be acquired by ""line upon line and precept upon precept;"
2897,"""EDWARD.""","here a little and there a little,"" it is not the work of a day; nor is"
2898,"""EDWARD.""",it to be gained by alternate periods at school. Who know but those who
2899,"""EDWARD.""","teach, half the time that is required to recover what is lost in these"
2900,"""EDWARD.""","frequently recurring, temporary absences. It is not only a large"
2901,"""EDWARD.""",portion of rudimental instruction that is lost; but those _many_
2902,"""EDWARD.""","opportunities, which every conscientious teacher eagerly, and"
2903,"""EDWARD.""","anxiously, avails herself of, to enforce good principles. This can be"
2904,"""EDWARD.""","done at no stated periods, but they must be seized as circumstances"

2909,"""EDWARD.""","account, then there is both time and money thrown away by those who"

2931,"""EDWARD.""","The Doctor was in to tea, and his frank good humoured manner,"

3403,"""GEORGE.""","he had made up his mind to propose for Helen--it must be so, else why"
3404,"""GEORGE.""","Dr. Sherman and Mrs. Cameron present?--this point, therefore, was"
3405,"""GEORGE.""","settled--at least with the Falkners, of her acceptance of him, a rich"
3406,"""GEORGE.""","East Indian, oh there could be no doubt of that. And the elder Miss"

3422,"""GEORGE.""","wait quietly, till he came. Early the next day, she sent for Mrs."

3427,"""GEORGE.""",his determination to go alone. Mrs. Cameron was equally perplexed with
3428,"""GEORGE.""","Helen, as to his object. She thought perhaps he had mistaken Helen's"

3430,"""GEORGE.""",applying her favorite well-founded maxim and belief in an over-ruling
