98,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,
99,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,
100,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"The design was, to trace the progress of a Poetical Genius, born in a"
101,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"rude age, from the first dawning of fancy and reason, till that period"
102,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,at which he may be supposed capable of appearing in the world as a
103,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"MINSTREL, that is, as an itinerant Poet and Musician;--a character,"
104,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"which, according to the notions of our fore-fathers, was not only"
105,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"respectable, but sacred."
106,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,
107,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"I have endeavoured to imitate SPENSER in the measure of his verse, and"
108,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"in the harmony, simplicity, and variety, of his composition. Antique"
109,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"expressions I have avoided; admitting, however, some old words, where"
110,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,they seemed to suit the subject; but I hope none will be found that
111,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"are now obsolete, or in any degree unintelligible to a reader of"
112,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,English poetry.
113,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,
114,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"To those, who may be disposed to ask, what could induce me to write in"
115,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"so difficult a measure, I can only answer, that it pleases my ear, and"
116,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"seems, from its Gothic structure and original, to bear some relation"
117,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,to the subject and spirit of the Poem. It admits both of simplicity
118,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"and magnificence of sound and of language, beyond any other stanza"
119,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,that I am acquainted with. It allows the sententiousness of the
120,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"couplet, as well as the more complex modulation of blank verse. What"
121,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"some critics have remarked, of its uniformity growing at last tiresome"
122,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,"to the ear, will be found to hold true, only when the poetry is faulty"
123,PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.,in other respects.

154,I.,
155,I.,Ah! who can tell how hard it is to climb
156,I.,"The steep, where Fame's proud temple shines afar!"
157,I.,Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime
158,I.,"Has felt the influence of malignant star,"
159,I.,And waged with Fortune an eternal war!
160,I.,"Checked by the scoff of Pride, by Envy's frown,"
161,I.,"And Poverty's unconquerable bar,"
162,I.,"In life's low vale remote has pined alone,"
163,I.,"Then dropt into the grave, unpitied and unknown!"
164,I.,
165,I.,
166,II.,II.
167,II.,
168,II.,"And yet, the languor of inglorious days"
169,II.,Not equally oppressive is to all.
170,II.,"Him, who ne'er listened to the voice of praise,"
171,II.,The silence of neglect can ne'er appal.
172,II.,"There are, who, deaf to mad Ambition's call,"
173,II.,Would shrink to hear th' obstreperous trump of Fame;
174,II.,"Supremely blest, if to their portion fall"
175,II.,"Health, competence, and peace. Nor higher aim"
176,II.,"Had He, whose simple tale these artless lines proclaim."
177,II.,
178,II.,
179,III.,III.
180,III.,
181,III.,This sapient age disclaims all classic lore;
182,III.,"Else I should here, in cunning phrase, display,"
183,III.,"How forth THE MINSTREL fared in days of yore,"
184,III.,"Right glad of heart, though homely in array;"
185,III.,His waving locks and beard all hoary grey:
186,III.,"And, from his bending shoulder, decent hung"
187,III.,"His harp, the sole companion of his way,"
188,III.,Which to the whistling wind responsive rung:
189,III.,And ever as he went some merry lay he sung.
190,III.,
191,III.,
192,IV.,IV.
193,IV.,
194,IV.,"Fret not yourselves, ye silken sons of pride,"
195,IV.,That a poor Wanderer should inspire my strain.
196,IV.,"The Muses fortune's fickle smile deride,"
197,IV.,Nor ever bow the knee in Mammon's fane;
198,IV.,"For their delights are with the village-train,"
199,IV.,"Whom Nature's laws engage, and Nature's charms:"
200,IV.,"They hate the sensual, and scorn the vain;"
201,IV.,"The parasite their influence never warms,"
202,IV.,Nor him whose sordid soul the love of wealth alarms.
203,IV.,
204,IV.,
205,V.,V.
206,V.,
207,V.,"Though richest hues the peacock's plumes adorn,"
208,V.,Yet horror screams from his discordant throat.
209,V.,"Rise, sons of harmony, and hail the morn,"
210,V.,While warbling larks on russet pinions float;
211,V.,"Or seek, at noon, the woodland scene remote,"
212,V.,Where the grey linnets carol from the hill.
213,V.,"O let them ne'er, with artificial note,"
214,V.,"To please a tyrant, strain the little bill!"
215,V.,"But sing what heaven inspires, and wander where they will."
216,V.,
217,V.,
218,VI.,VI.
219,VI.,
220,VI.,"Liberal, not lavish, is kind Nature's hand;"
221,VI.,Nor was perfection made for man below.
222,VI.,"Yet all her schemes with nicest art are planned,"
223,VI.,"Good counteracting ill, and gladness woe."
224,VI.,"With gold and gems if Chilian mountains glow,"
225,VI.,If bleak and barren Scotia's hills arise;
226,VI.,"There, plague and poison, lust and rapine grow;"
227,VI.,"Here, peaceful are the vales, and pure the skies,"
228,VI.,"And freedom fires the soul, and sparkles in the eyes."
229,VI.,
230,VI.,
231,VII.,VII.
232,VII.,
233,VII.,"Then grieve not, thou, to whom the indulgent Muse"
234,VII.,Vouchsafes a portion of celestial fire;
235,VII.,"Nor blame the partial fates, if they refuse"
236,VII.,"The imperial banquet, and the rich attire."
237,VII.,"Know thine own worth, and reverence the lyre."
238,VII.,Wilt thou debase the heart which God refined?
239,VII.,"No; let thy heaven-taught soul to heaven aspire,"
240,VII.,"To fancy, freedom, harmony, resigned;"
241,VII.,Ambition's grovelling crew for ever left behind.
242,VII.,
243,VII.,
244,VIII.,VIII.
245,VIII.,
246,VIII.,Canst thou forego the pure ethereal soul
247,VIII.,"In each fine sense so exquisitely keen,"
248,VIII.,"On the dull couch of Luxury to loll,"
249,VIII.,"Stung with disease, and stupified with spleen;"
250,VIII.,"Fain to implore the aid of Flattery's screen,"
251,VIII.,"Even from thyself thy loathsome heart to hide,"
252,VIII.,"(The mansion, then, no more of joy serene)"
253,VIII.,"Where fear, distrust, malevolence, abide,"
254,VIII.,"And impotent desire, and disappointed pride?"
255,VIII.,
256,VIII.,
257,IX.,IX.
258,IX.,
259,IX.,"O, how canst thou renounce the boundless store"
260,IX.,Of charms which Nature to her votary yields!
261,IX.,"The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,"
262,IX.,"The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;"
263,IX.,"All that the genial ray of morning gilds,"
264,IX.,"And all that echoes to the song of even,"
265,IX.,"All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields,"
266,IX.,"And all the dread magnificence of heaven,"
267,IX.,"O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!"
268,IX.,
269,IX.,
270,X.,X.
271,X.,
272,X.,"These charms shall work thy soul's eternal health,"
273,X.,"And love, and gentleness, and joy, impart."
274,X.,"But these thou must renounce, if lust of wealth"
275,X.,E'er win its way to thy corrupted heart;
276,X.,For ah! it poisons like a scorpion's dart;
277,X.,"Prompting the ungenerous wish, the selfish scheme,"
278,X.,"The stern resolve, unmoved by pity's smart,"
279,X.,"The troublous day, and long distressful dream."
280,X.,"Return, my roving Muse! resume thy purposed theme."
281,X.,
282,X.,
283,XI.,XI.
284,XI.,
285,XI.,"There lived, in Gothic days, as legends tell,"
286,XI.,"A shepherd-swain, a man of low degree;"
287,XI.,"Whose sires, perchance, in Fairyland might dwell,"
288,XI.,"Sicilian groves, or vales of Arcady;"
289,XI.,"But he, I ween, was of the North Countrie:"
290,XI.,"A nation famed for song, and beauty's charms;"
291,XI.,"Zealous, yet modest; innocent, though free;"
292,XI.,Patient of toil; serene amidst alarms;
293,XI.,Inflexible in faith; invincible in arms.
294,XI.,
295,XI.,
296,XII.,XII.
297,XII.,
298,XII.,"The shepherd-swain, of whom I mention made,"
299,XII.,On Scotia's mountains fed his little flock;
300,XII.,"The sickle, scythe, or plough, he never swayed;"
301,XII.,An honest heart was almost all his stock;
302,XII.,His drink the living water from the rock:
303,XII.,"The milky dams supplied his board, and lent"
304,XII.,Their kindly fleece to baffle winter's shock;
305,XII.,"And he, though oft with dust and sweat besprent,"
306,XII.,"Did guide and guard their wanderings, wheresoe'er they went."
307,XII.,
308,XII.,
309,XIII.,XIII.
310,XIII.,
311,XIII.,"From labour health, from health contentment springs."
312,XIII.,Contentment opes the source of every joy.
313,XIII.,"He envied not, he never thought of kings;"
314,XIII.,"Nor from those appetites sustained annoy,"
315,XIII.,"Which chance may frustrate, or indulgence cloy:"
316,XIII.,Nor fate his calm and humble hopes beguiled;
317,XIII.,"He mourned no recreant friend, nor mistress coy,"
318,XIII.,"For on his vows the blameless Phoebe smiled,"
319,XIII.,"And her alone he loved, and loved her from a child."
320,XIII.,
321,XIII.,
322,XIV.,XIV.
323,XIV.,
324,XIV.,"No jealousy their dawn of love o'ercast,"
325,XIV.,Nor blasted were their wedded days with strife;
326,XIV.,"Each season looked delightful, as it past,"
327,XIV.,"To the fond husband, and the faithful wife."
328,XIV.,Beyond the lowly vale of shepherd life
329,XIV.,They never roamed; secure beneath the storm
330,XIV.,"Which in Ambition's lofty land is rife,"
331,XIV.,Where peace and love are cankered by the worm
332,XIV.,"Of pride, each bud of joy industrious to deform."
333,XIV.,
334,XIV.,
335,XV.,XV.
336,XV.,
337,XV.,"The wight, whose tale these artless lines unfold,"
338,XV.,Was all the offspring of this simple pair.
339,XV.,His birth no oracle or seer foretold:
340,XV.,"No prodigy appeared in earth or air,"
341,XV.,Nor aught that might a strange event declare.
342,XV.,You guess each circumstance of EDWIN'S birth;
343,XV.,"The parent's transport, and the parent's care;"
344,XV.,"The gossip's prayer for wealth, and wit, and worth;"
345,XV.,And one long summer-day of indolence and mirth.
346,XV.,
347,XV.,
348,XVI.,XVI.
349,XVI.,
350,XVI.,And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy;
351,XVI.,Deep thought oft seemed to fix his infant eye.
352,XVI.,"Dainties he heeded not, nor gaude, nor toy,"
353,XVI.,Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy.
354,XVI.,"Silent when glad; affectionate, though shy;"
355,XVI.,"And now his look was most demurely sad,"
356,XVI.,"And now he laughed aloud, yet none knew why."
357,XVI.,"The neighbours stared and sighed, yet blessed the lad:"
358,XVI.,"Some deemed him wondrous wise, and some believed him mad."
359,XVI.,
360,XVI.,
361,XVII.,XVII.
362,XVII.,
363,XVII.,But why should I his childish feats display?
364,XVII.,"Concourse, and noise, and toil, he ever fled;"
365,XVII.,Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray
366,XVII.,"Of squabbling imps; but to the forest sped,"
367,XVII.,Or roamed at large the lonely mountain's head;
368,XVII.,"Or, where the maze of some bewildered stream"
369,XVII.,"To deep untrodden groves his footsteps led,"
370,XVII.,"There would he wander wild, 'till Phoebus' beam,"
371,XVII.,"Shot from the western cliff, released the weary team."
372,XVII.,
373,XVII.,
374,XVIII.,XVIII.
375,XVIII.,
376,XVIII.,"The exploit of strength, dexterity, or speed,"
377,XVIII.,To him nor vanity nor joy could bring.
378,XVIII.,"His heart, from cruel sport estranged, would bleed"
379,XVIII.,"To work the woe of any living thing,"
380,XVIII.,"By trap, or net; by arrow, or by sling;"
381,XVIII.,"These he detested, those he scorned to wield:"
382,XVIII.,"He wished to be the guardian, not the king,"
383,XVIII.,"Tyrant, far less, or traitor, of the field."
384,XVIII.,And sure the sylvan reign unbloody joy might yield.
385,XVIII.,
386,XVIII.,
387,XIX.,XIX.
388,XIX.,
389,XIX.,"Lo! where the stripling, wrapt in wonder, roves"
390,XIX.,Beneath the precipice o'erhung with pine;
391,XIX.,"And sees, on high, amidst the encircling groves,"
392,XIX.,From cliff to cliff the foaming torrents shine:
393,XIX.,"While waters, woods, and winds, in concert join,"
394,XIX.,And Echo swells the chorus to the skies.
395,XIX.,Would Edwin this majestic scene resign
396,XIX.,For aught the huntsman's puny craft supplies?
397,XIX.,Ah! no: he better knows great Nature's charms to prize.
398,XIX.,
399,XIX.,
400,XX.,XX.
401,XX.,
402,XX.,"And oft he traced the uplands, to survey,"
403,XX.,"When o'er the sky advanced the kindling dawn,"
404,XX.,"The crimson cloud, blue main, and mountain grey,"
405,XX.,"And lake, dim-gleaming on the smoky lawn;"
406,XX.,"Far to the west the long, long vale withdrawn,"
407,XX.,Where twilight loves to linger for a while;
408,XX.,"And now he faintly kens the bounding fawn,"
409,XX.,And villager abroad at early toil.
410,XX.,"But, lo! the sun appears! and heaven, earth, ocean, smile."
411,XX.,
412,XX.,
413,XXI.,XXI.
414,XXI.,
415,XXI.,"And oft the craggy cliff he loved to climb,"
416,XXI.,When all in mist the world below was lost.
417,XXI.,"What dreadful pleasure! there to stand sublime,"
418,XXI.,"Like shipwrecked mariner on desert coast,"
419,XXI.,"And view the enormous waste of vapour, tost"
420,XXI.,"In billows, lengthening to the horizon round,"
421,XXI.,"Now scooped in gulfs, with mountains now embossed!"
422,XXI.,"And hear the voice of mirth and song rebound,"
423,XXI.,"Flocks, herds, and waterfalls, along the hoar profound!"
424,XXI.,
425,XXI.,
426,XXII.,XXII.
427,XXII.,
428,XXII.,"In truth he was a strange and wayward wight,"
429,XXII.,"Fond of each gentle, and each dreadful scene."
430,XXII.,"In darkness, and in storm, he found delight:"
431,XXII.,"Nor less, than when on ocean-wave serene"
432,XXII.,The southern sun diffused his dazzling shene.
433,XXII.,Even sad vicissitude amused his soul:
434,XXII.,"And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,"
435,XXII.,"And down his cheek a tear of pity roll,"
436,XXII.,"A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wished not to controul."
437,XXII.,
438,XXII.,
439,XXIII.,XXIII.
440,XXIII.,
441,XXIII.,"'O ye wild groves, O where is now your bloom!'"
442,XXIII.,(The Muse interprets thus his tender thought.)
443,XXIII.,"'Your flowers, your verdure, and your balmy gloom,"
444,XXIII.,'Of late so grateful in the hour of drought!
445,XXIII.,"'Why do the birds, that song and rapture brought"
446,XXIII.,"'To all your bowers, their mansions now forsake?"
447,XXIII.,'Ah! why has fickle chance this ruin wrought!
448,XXIII.,"'For now the storm howls mournful through the brake,"
449,XXIII.,'And the dead foliage flies in many a shapeless flake.
450,XXIII.,
451,XXIII.,
452,XXIV.,XXIV.
453,XXIV.,
454,XXIV.,"'Where now the rill, melodious, pure, and cool,"
455,XXIV.,"'And meads, with life, and mirth, and beauty, crowned!"
456,XXIV.,"'Ah! see, the unsightly slime, and sluggish pool,"
457,XXIV.,'Have all the solitary vale imbrowned;
458,XXIV.,"'Fled each fair form, and mute each melting sound."
459,XXIV.,'The raven croaks forlorn on naked spray:
460,XXIV.,"'And, hark! the river, bursting every mound,"
461,XXIV.,"'Down the vale thunders; and, with wasteful sway,"
462,XXIV.,"'Uproots the grove, and rolls the shattered rocks away."
463,XXIV.,
464,XXIV.,
465,XXV.,XXV.
