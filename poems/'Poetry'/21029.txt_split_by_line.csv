1398,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,For it's chimney-sweepers' dancing day.
1399,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1400,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And red as a rose, and blue as the sky,"
1401,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"With teeth as white as their faces are black,"
1402,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"The master-sweeps go dancing by,"
1403,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,With a gridiron painted on every back.
1404,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1405,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"But when they are ranged in the market-place,"
1406,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"The clown's wife comes with an iron spoon,"
1407,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,And cozens a penny for her sweet face
1408,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,To keep their golden throats in tune.
1409,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1410,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Then, hushing the riot of that mad throng,"
1411,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And sweet as the voice of a long-dead May,"
1412,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"A wandering pedlar lifts 'em a song,"
1413,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,Of chimney-sweepers' dancing day;

1415,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And the sooty faces, they try to recall...."
1416,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,As they gather around in their spell-struck rings....
1417,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,But nobody knows that singer at all
1418,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,Or the curious old-time air he sings:--
1419,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1420,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Why are you dancing, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,"
1421,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,And where did you win you these may-coats so fine;
1422,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"For some are red as roses, and some are gold as daffodils,"
1423,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"But who, ah, who remembers, now, a little lad of mine?"
1424,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1425,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Lady, we are dancing, as we danced in old England"
1426,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"When the may was more than may, very long ago:"
1427,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"As for our may-coats, it was your white hands, lady,"
1428,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Filled our sooty hearts and minds with blossom, white as snow."
1429,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1430,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"It was a beautiful face we saw, wandering through Cheltenham."
1431,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"It was a beautiful song we heard, very far away,"
1432,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Weeping for a little lad stolen by the gipsies,"
1433,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,Broke our hearts and filled 'em with the glory of the may.
1434,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1435,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Many a little lad had we, chirruping in the chimney-tops,"
1436,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Twirling out a sooty broom, a blot against the blue."
1437,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Ah, but when we called to him, and when he saw and ran to her,"
1438,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"All our winter ended, and our world was made anew."
1439,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1440,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Then she gave us may-coats of gold and green and crimson,"
1441,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Then, with a long garland, she led our hearts away,"
1442,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Whispering, ""Remember, though the boughs forget the hawthorn,"
1443,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Yet shall I return to you, that was your lady May.""--"
1444,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1445,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"But why are you dancing now, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,"
1446,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,And why are you singing of a May that is fled?--
1447,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"O, there's music to be born, though we pluck the old fiddle-strings,"
1448,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,And a world's May awaking where the fields lay dead.
1449,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,
1450,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And we dance, dance, dreaming of a lady most beautiful"
1451,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"That shall walk the green valleys of this dark earth one day,"
1452,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And call to us gently, ""O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham,"
1453,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"I am looking for my children. Awake, and come away."""

1564,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1565,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1566,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Your thoughts are for the poor and weak?
1567,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Ah, no, the picturesque's your passion!"
1568,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Your tongue is always in your cheek
1569,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,At poverty that's not in fashion.
1570,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1571,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You like a ploughman's rugged face,"
1572,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Or painted eyes in Piccadilly;
1573,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"But bowler hats are commonplace,"
1574,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,And thread-bare tradesmen simply silly.
1575,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1576,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The clerk that sings ""God save the King,"""
1577,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And still believes his Tory paper,--"
1578,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,You hate the anæmic fool? I thought
1579,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,You loved the weak! Was that all vapour?
1580,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1581,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Ah, when you sneer, dear democrat,"
1582,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,At such a shiny-trousered Tory
1583,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Because he doffs his poor old hat
1584,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"To what he thinks his country's glory,"
1585,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1586,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,To you it's just a coloured rag.
1587,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You hate the ""patriots"" that bawl so."
1588,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Well, my Ulysses, there's a flag"
1589,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,That lifts men in Republics also.
1590,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1591,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,No doubt his thoughts are cruder far;
1592,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And, where those linen folds are shaking,"
1593,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Perhaps he sees a kind of star
1594,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Because his eyes are tired and aching.
1595,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1596,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Banal enough! Banal as truth!
1597,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,But I'm not thinking of his banners.
1598,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,I'm thinking of his pinched white youth
1599,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And your disgusting ""new art"" manners."
1600,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1601,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,His meek submission stirs your hate?
1602,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Better, my lad, if you're so fervent,"
1603,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Turn your cold steel against the State
1604,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Instead of sneering at the servant.
1605,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1606,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,He does his job. He draws his pay.
1607,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You sneer, and dine with those that pay him;"
1608,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,And then you write a snobbish play
1609,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"For democrats, in which you play him."
1610,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1611,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Ah, yes, you like simplicity"
1612,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,That sucks its cheeks to make the dimple.
1613,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,But this domestic bourgeoisie
1614,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You hate,--because it's all too simple."
1615,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1616,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You hate the hearth, the wife, the child,"
1617,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,You hate the heavens that bend above them.
1618,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Your simple folk must all run wild
1619,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Like jungle-beasts before you love them.
1620,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1621,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You own a house in Cheyne Walk,"
1622,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,(You say it costs three thousand fully)
1623,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Where subtle snobs can talk and talk
1624,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,And play the intellectual bully.
1625,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1626,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Yes. I say ""snobs."" Are names alone"
1627,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Free from all change? Your word ""Victorian"""
1628,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Could bite and sting in ninety one
1629,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,But now--it's deader than the saurian.
1630,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1631,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You think I live in yesterday,"
1632,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Because I think your way the wrong one;
1633,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"But I have hewed and ploughed my way,"
1634,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,And--unlike yours--it's been a long one.
1635,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1636,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I let Victoria toll her bell,"
1637,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And went with Strindberg for a ride, sir."
1638,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I've fought through your own day as well,"
1639,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And come out on the other side, sir,--"
1640,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1641,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The further side, the morning side,"
1642,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,I read free verse (the Psalms) on Sunday.
1643,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,But I've decided (you'll decide)
1644,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,That there is room for song on Monday.
1645,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1646,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I've seen the new snob on his way,"
1647,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The intellectual snob I mean, sir,"
1648,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The artist snob, in book and play,"
1649,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Kicking his mother round the scene, sir."
1650,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1651,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,I've heard the Tories talk like fools;
1652,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,And the rich fool that apes the Tory.
1653,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,I've seen the shopmen break your rules
1654,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"And die like Christ, in Christ's own glory."
1655,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,
1656,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"But, as for you, that liberal sneer"
1657,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,Reminds me of the poor old Kaiser.

3014,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And quickened, as with quivering battle-stains,"
3015,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The printed ships that decked the parlour wall.
3016,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3017,THE PHANTOM FLEET,From oaken frames old admirals looked down:
3018,THE PHANTOM FLEET,They saw the lonely slumberer at their feet:
3019,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"They saw the paper, headed _Talk from Town;"
3020,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Our rusting trident, and our phantom fleet_:"
3021,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3022,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And from a neighbouring tavern surged a song
3023,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Of England laughing in the face of war,"
3024,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"With eyes unconquerably proud and strong,"
3025,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And lips triumphant from her Trafalgar.
3026,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3027,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"But he, the slumberer in that glimmering room,"
3028,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Saw distant waters glide and heave and gleam;
3029,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Around him in the softly coloured gloom
3030,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The pictures clustered slowly to a dream.
3031,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3032,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"He saw how England, resting on her past,"
3033,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Among the faded garlands of her dead,"
3034,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Woke; for a whisper reached her heart at last,"
3035,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And once again she raised her steel-clad head.
3036,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3037,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Her eyes were filled with sudden strange alarms;
3038,THE PHANTOM FLEET,She heard the westering waters change and chime;
3039,THE PHANTOM FLEET,She heard the distant tumult of her arms
3040,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Defeated, not by courage, but by Time."
3041,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3042,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Knowledge had made a deadlier pact with death,"
3043,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Nor strength nor steel availed against that bond:
3044,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Slowly approached--and Britain held her breath--
3045,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The battle booming from the deeps beyond.
3046,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3047,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"O, then what darkness rolled upon the wind,"
3048,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Threatening the torch that Britain held on high?
3049,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Where all her navies, baffled, broken, blind,"
3050,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Slunk backward, snarling in their agony!"
3051,THE PHANTOM FLEET,_Who guards the gates of Freedom now?_ The cry
3052,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Stabbed heaven! _England, the shattered ramparts fall!_"
3053,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Then, like a trumpet shivering through the sky"
3054,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"O, like white lightning rending the black pall"
3055,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Of heaven, an answer pealed: _Her dead shall hear that call._"
3056,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3057,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Then came a distant light of great waves breaking
3058,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"That brought the sunset on each crumbling crest,"
3059,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"A rumour as of buried ages waking,"
3060,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And mighty spirits rising from their rest;
3061,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Then ghostly clouds arose, with billowing breast,"
3062,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"White clouds that turned to sails upon their way,"
3063,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Red clouds that burned like flags against the West,"
3064,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Till even the conquering fleet in silence lay
3065,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Dazed with that strange old light, and night grew bright as day."
3066,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3067,THE PHANTOM FLEET,_We come to fight for Freedom!_ The great East
3068,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Heard, and was rent asunder like a veil."
3069,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Host upon host out of the night increased
3070,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Its towering clouds and crowded zones of sail:
3071,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_England, our England, canst thou faint or fail?"
3072,THE PHANTOM FLEET,We come to fight for Freedom yet once more!_
3073,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"This, this is ours at least! Count the great tale"
3074,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Of all these dead that rise to guard thy shore
3075,THE PHANTOM FLEET,By right of the red life they never feared to pour.
3076,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3077,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_We come to fight for Freedom!_ On they came,"
3078,THE PHANTOM FLEET,One cloud of beauty sweeping the wild sea;
3079,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And there, through all their thousands, flashed like flame"
3080,THE PHANTOM FLEET,That star-born signal of the Victory:
3081,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_Duty_, that deathless lantern of the free;"
3082,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_Duty_, that makes a god of every man."
3083,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And there was Nelson, watching silently"
3084,THE PHANTOM FLEET,As through the phantom fleet the message ran;
3085,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And his tall frigate rushed before the stormy van.
3086,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3087,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Nelson, our Nelson, frail and maimed and blind,"
3088,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Stretched out his dead cold face against the foe:
3089,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And England's Raleigh followed hard behind,"
3090,THE PHANTOM FLEET,With all his eager fighting heart aglow;
3091,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Glad, glad for England's sake once more to know"
3092,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The old joy of battle and contempt of pain;
3093,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Glad, glad to die, if England willed it so,"
3094,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The traitor's and the coward's death again;
3095,THE PHANTOM FLEET,But hurl the world back now as once he hurled back Spain.
3096,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3097,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And there were all those others, Drake and Blake,"
3098,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Rodney and Howard, Byron, Collingwood;"
3099,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"With deathless eyes aflame for England's sake,"
3100,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"As on their ancient decks they proudly stood,--"
3101,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Decks washed of old with England's purplest blood;
3102,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And there, once more, each rushing oaken side"
3103,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Bared its dark-throated, thirsty, gleaming brood"
3104,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Of cannon, watched by laughing lads who died"
3105,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Long, long ago for England and her ancient pride."
3106,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3107,THE PHANTOM FLEET,_We come to fight for England!_ The great sea
3108,THE PHANTOM FLEET,In a wild light of song began to break
3109,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Round that tall phantom of the Victory
3110,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And all the foam was music in her wake:
3111,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Ship after phantom ship, with guns a-rake"
3112,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And shot-rent flags a-stream from every mast
3113,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Moved in a deepening splendour, not to make"
3114,THE PHANTOM FLEET,A shield for England of her own dead past;
3115,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"But, with a living dream to arm her soul at last."
3116,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3117,THE PHANTOM FLEET,_We come to die for England_: through the hush
3118,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Of gathered nations rose that regal cry,"
3119,THE PHANTOM FLEET,From naked oaken walls one word could crush
3120,THE PHANTOM FLEET,If those vast armoured throats dared to reply:
3121,THE PHANTOM FLEET,But there the most implacable enemy
3122,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Felt his eyes fill with gladder, prouder tears,"
3123,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"As Nelson's calm eternal face went by,"
3124,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Gazing beyond all perishable fears
3125,THE PHANTOM FLEET,To some diviner goal above the waste of years.
3126,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3127,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Through the hushed fleets the vision streamed away,"
3128,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Then slowly turned once more to that deep West,"
3129,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"While voices cried, O, England, the new day"
3130,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Is dawning, but thy soul can take no rest."
3131,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3132,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Thy freedom and thy peace are only thine
3133,THE PHANTOM FLEET,By right of toil on every land and sea
3134,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And by that crimson sacrificial wine
3135,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Of thine own heart and thine own agony.
3136,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3137,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Peace is not slumber. Peace, in every hour,"
3138,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Throbs like the heart of music. This alone
3139,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Can save thy heritage and confirm that power
3140,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Whereof the past is but the cushioned throne.
3141,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3142,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Look to the fleet! Again and yet again,"
3143,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Hear us who storm thy heart with this one cry.
3144,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Hear us, who cannot help, though fair and fain,"
3145,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"To hold thy seas before thee, and to die."
3146,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3147,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Look to the fleet! Thy fleet, the first, last line:"
3148,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"The sword of Liberty, her strength, her shield,"
3149,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Her food, her life-blood! Britain, it is thine,"
3150,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Here, now, to hold that birth-right, or to yield."
3151,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3152,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"So, through the dark, those phantom ships of old"
3153,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Faded, it seemed, through mists of blood and tears."
3154,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Sails turned to clouds, and slowly westward rolled"
3155,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The sad returning pageant of the years.
3156,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"On tides of light, where all our tumults cease,"
3157,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Through that rich West, the Victory returned;"
3158,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And all the waves around her whispered ""peace,"""
3159,THE PHANTOM FLEET,And from her mast no battle-message burned.
3160,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3161,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Like clouds, like fragments of those fading skies,"
3162,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"The pageant passed, with all its misty spars,"
3163,THE PHANTOM FLEET,While the hushed nations raised their dreaming eyes
3164,THE PHANTOM FLEET,To that great light which brings the end of wars.
3165,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3166,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Ship after ship, in some strange glory drowned,"
3167,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Cloud after cloud, was lost in that deep light"
3168,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Each with a sovran stillness haloed round.
3169,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Then--that high fleet of stars led on the night.
3170,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3171,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3172,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3173,THE PHANTOM FLEET,
3174,MICHAEL OAKTREE,MICHAEL OAKTREE
3175,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3176,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3177,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Under an arch of glorious leaves I passed
3178,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Out of the wood and saw the sickle moon
3179,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Floating in daylight o'er the pale green sea.
3180,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3181,MICHAEL OAKTREE,It was the quiet hour before the sun
3182,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Gathers the clouds to prayer and silently
3183,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Utters his benediction on the waves
3184,MICHAEL OAKTREE,That whisper round the death-bed of the day.
3185,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The labourers were returning from the farms
3186,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And children danced to meet them. From the doors
3187,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of cottages there came a pleasant clink
3188,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Where busy hands laid out the evening meal.
3189,MICHAEL OAKTREE,From smouldering elms around the village spire
3190,MICHAEL OAKTREE,There soared and sank the caw of gathering rooks.
3191,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The faint-flushed clouds were listening to the tale
3192,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The sea tells to the sunset with one sigh.
3193,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The last white wistful sea-bird sought for peace,"
3194,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And the last fishing-boat stole o'er the bar,"
3195,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And fragrant grasses, murmuring a prayer,"
3196,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Bowed all together to the holy west,"
3197,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Bowed all together thro' the golden hush,"
3198,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The breathing hush, the solemn scented hush,"
3199,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The holy, holy hush of eventide."
3200,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3201,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And, in among the ferns that crowned the hill"
3202,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"With waving green and whispers of the wind,"
3203,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"A boy and girl, carelessly linking hands,"
3204,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Into their golden dream drifted away.
3205,MICHAEL OAKTREE,On that rich afternoon of scent and song
3206,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Old Michael Oaktree died. It was not much
3207,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He wished for; but indeed I think he longed
3208,MICHAEL OAKTREE,To see the light of summer once again
3209,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Blossoming o'er the far blue hills. I know
3210,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He used to like his rough-hewn wooden bench
3211,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Placed in the sun outside the cottage door
3212,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Where in the listening stillness he could hear,"
3213,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Across the waving gilly-flowers that crowned
3214,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"His crumbling garden wall, the long low sigh"
3215,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills
3216,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The sacred consolation of the sea.
3217,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He did not hope for much: he longed to live
3218,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Until the winter came again, he said;"
3219,MICHAEL OAKTREE,But on the last sweet eve of May he died.
3220,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3221,MICHAEL OAKTREE,I wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes
3222,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Down to the cottage on that afternoon;
3223,MICHAEL OAKTREE,For I had known old Michael Oaktree now
3224,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"So many years, so many happy years."
3225,MICHAEL OAKTREE,When I was little he had carried me
3226,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"High on his back to see the harvest home,"
3227,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And given me many a ride upon his wagon
3228,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Among the dusty scents of sun and hay.
3229,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He showed me how to snare the bulky trout
3230,MICHAEL OAKTREE,That lurked under the bank of yonder brook.
3231,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Indeed, he taught me many a country craft,"
3232,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"For I was apt to learn, and, as I learnt,"
3233,MICHAEL OAKTREE,I loved the teacher of that homely lore.
3234,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad
3235,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Influence of the suns and winds and waves,"
3236,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Giving my childhood what it hungered for--
3237,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The rude earth-wisdom of the primal man.
3238,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3239,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He had retained his childhood: Death for him
3240,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Had no more terror than his bed. He walked
3241,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"With wind and sunlight like a brother, glad"
3242,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of their companionship and mutual aid.
3243,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"We, toilers after truth, are weaned too soon"
3244,MICHAEL OAKTREE,From earth's dark arms and naked barbarous breast.
3245,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Too soon, too soon, we leave the golden feast,"
3246,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown
3247,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of roses from the dreaming brow. We pass
3248,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Our lives in most laborious idleness.
3249,MICHAEL OAKTREE,For we have lost the meaning of the world;
3250,MICHAEL OAKTREE,We have gone out into the night too soon;
3251,MICHAEL OAKTREE,We have mistaken all the means of grace
3252,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And over-rated our small power to learn.
3253,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And the years move so swiftly over us:
3254,MICHAEL OAKTREE,We have so little time to live in worlds
3255,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Unrealised and unknown realms of joy,"
3256,MICHAEL OAKTREE,We are so old before we learn how vain
3257,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Our effort was, how fruitlessly we cast"
3258,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Our Bread upon the waters, and how weak"
3259,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Our hearts were, but our chance desires how strong!"
3260,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Then, in the dark, our sense of light decays;"
3261,MICHAEL OAKTREE,We cannot cry to God as once we cried!
3262,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Lost in the gloom, our faith, perhaps our love,"
3263,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Lies dead with years that never can return.
3264,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3265,MICHAEL OAKTREE,But Michael Oaktree was a man whose love
3266,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Had never waned through all his eighty years.
3267,MICHAEL OAKTREE,His faith was hardly faith. He seemed a part
3268,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of all that he believed in. He had lived
3269,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"In constant conversation with the sun,"
3270,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The wind, the silence and the heart of peace;"
3271,MICHAEL OAKTREE,In absolute communion with the Power
3272,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"That rules all action and all tides of thought,"
3273,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And all the secret courses of the stars;
3274,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The Power that still establishes on earth
3275,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Desire and worship, through the radiant laws"
3276,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of Duty, Love and Beauty; for through these"
3277,MICHAEL OAKTREE,As through three portals of the self-same gate
3278,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The soul of man attains infinity,"
3279,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And enters into Godhead. So he gained
3280,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"On earth a fore-taste of Nirvana, not"
3281,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The void of eastern dream, but the desire"
3282,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And goal of all of us, whether thro' lives"
3283,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Innumerable, by slow degrees, we near"
3284,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The death divine, or from this breaking body"
3285,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of earthly death we flash at once to God.
3286,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Through simple love and simple faith, this man"
3287,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Attained a height above the hope of kings.
3288,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3289,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Yet, as I softly shut the little gate"
3290,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And walked across the garden, all the scents"
3291,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of mingling blossom ached like inmost pain
3292,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Deep in my heart, I know not why. They seemed"
3293,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Distinct, distinct as distant evening bells"
3294,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Tolling, over the sea, a secret chime"
3295,MICHAEL OAKTREE,That breaks and breaks and breaks upon the heart
3296,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"In sorrow rather than in sound, a chime"
3297,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Strange as a streak of sunset to the moon,"
3298,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Strange as a rose upon a starlit grave,"
3299,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Strange as a smile upon a dead man's lips;
3300,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"A chime of melancholy, mute as death"
3301,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"But strong as love, uttered in plangent tones"
3302,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers,"
3303,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves,"
3304,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Lilac and lilies to the rose-wreathed porch.
3305,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3306,MICHAEL OAKTREE,At last I tapped and entered and was drawn
3307,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Into the bedroom of the dying man,"
3308,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Who lay, propped up with pillows, quietly"
3309,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Gazing; for through his open casement far
3310,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Beyond the whispers of the gilly-flowers
3311,MICHAEL OAKTREE,He saw the mellow light of eventide
3312,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Hallow the west once more; and, as he gazed,"
3313,MICHAEL OAKTREE,I think I never saw so great a peace
3314,MICHAEL OAKTREE,On any human face. There was no sound
3315,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock,"
3316,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The whisper of the garden and, far off,"
3317,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The sacred consolation of the sea.
3318,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3319,MICHAEL OAKTREE,His wife sat at his bed-side: she had passed
3320,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Her eightieth year; her only child was dead.
3321,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"She had been wedded more than sixty years,"
3322,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And she sat gazing with the man she loved
3323,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Quietly, out into that unknown Deep."
3324,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3325,MICHAEL OAKTREE,A butterfly floated into the room
3326,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And back again, pausing awhile to bask"
3327,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And wink its painted fans on the warm sill;
3328,MICHAEL OAKTREE,A bird piped in the roses and there came
3329,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Into the childless mother's ears a sound
3330,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of happy laughing children, far away."
3331,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3332,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Then Michael Oaktree took his wife's thin hand
3333,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Between his big rough hands. His eyes grew dark,"
3334,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And, as he turned to her and died, he spoke"
3335,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Two words of perfect faith and love--_Come soon_!
3336,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3337,MICHAEL OAKTREE,O then in all the world there was no sound
3338,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock,"
3339,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The whisper of the leaves and far away,"
3340,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The infinite compassion of the sea.
3341,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"But, as I softly passed out of the porch"
3342,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And walked across the garden, all the scents"
3343,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of mingling blossoms ached like inmost joy,"
3344,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Distinct no more, but like one heavenly choir"
3345,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Pealing one mystic music, still and strange"
3346,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"As voices of the holy Seraphim,"
3347,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"One voice of adoration, mute as love,"
3348,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Stronger than death, and pure with wedded tones"
3349,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers,"
3350,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves,"
3351,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Lilac and lilies to the garden gate.
3352,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3353,MICHAEL OAKTREE,O then indeed I knew how closely knit
3354,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"To stars and flowers we are, how many means"
3355,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Of grace there are for those that never lose
3356,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Their sense of membership in this divine
3357,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Body of God; for those that all their days
3358,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Have walked in quiet communion with the Life
3359,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"That keeps the common secret of the sun,"
3360,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The wind, the silence and the heart of man."
3361,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"There is one God, one Love, one everlasting"
3362,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Mystery of Incarnation, one creative"
3363,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Passion behind the many-coloured veil.
3364,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3365,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"We have obscured God's face with partial truths,"
3366,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The cause of all our sorrow and sin, our wars"
3367,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Of force and thought, in this unheavened world."
3368,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Yet, by the battle of our partial truths,"
3369,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The past against the present and the swift
3370,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Moment of passing joy against the deep
3371,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Eternal love, ever the weaker truth"
3372,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Falls to the stronger, till once more we near"
3373,MICHAEL OAKTREE,The enfolding splendour of the whole. Our God
3374,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Has been too long a partial God. We are all
3375,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Made in His image, men and birds and beasts,"
3376,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Mountains and clouds and cataracts and suns,"
3377,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"With those great Beings above our little world,"
3378,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"A height beyond for every depth below,"
3379,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Those long-forgotten Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,"

3381,MICHAEL OAKTREE,As far beyond our thought as Europe lies
3382,MICHAEL OAKTREE,With all its little arts and sciences
3383,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Beyond the comprehension of the worm.
3384,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"We are all partial images, we need"
3385,MICHAEL OAKTREE,What lies beyond us to complete our souls;

3393,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"But, as I paused upon the whispering hill"
3394,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"The mellow light still lingered in the west,"

3396,MICHAEL OAKTREE,A boy and girl stood knee-deep in the ferns.
3397,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Dreams of the dead man's youth were in my heart,"
3398,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Yet I was very glad; and as the moon
3399,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Brightened, they kissed; and, linking hand in hand,"
3400,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Down to their lamp-lit home drifted away.
3401,MICHAEL OAKTREE,
3402,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Under an arch of leaves, into the gloom"
3403,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"I went along the little woodland road,"
3404,MICHAEL OAKTREE,And through the breathless hedge of hawthorn heard

3420,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,From Ludgate Hill to World's End. It was he!
3421,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"Despite the broadcloth and the bowler hat,"
3422,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"I knew him, Touchstone, the wild flower of folly,"
3423,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"The whetstone of his age, the scourge of kings,"
3424,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"The madcap morning star of elfin-land,"
3425,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,Who used to wrap his legs around his neck
3426,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"For warmth on winter nights. He had slipped back,"
3427,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,To see what men were doing in a world
3428,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"That should be wiser. He had watched a play,"
3429,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"Read several books, heard men discourse of art"
3430,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,And life; and he sat bubbling like a spring
3431,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"In Arden. Never did blackbird, drenched with may,"
3432,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,Chuckle as Touchstone chuckled on that ride.
3433,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"_Lord, what a world! Lord, what a mad, mad world!_"
3434,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"Then, to the jolt and jingle of the engine,"
3435,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,He burst into this bunch of madcap rhymes:--
