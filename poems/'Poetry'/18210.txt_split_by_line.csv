112,IN A NUTSHELL,
113,IN A NUTSHELL,"One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, is:"
114,IN A NUTSHELL,Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly this.
115,IN A NUTSHELL,
116,IN A NUTSHELL,"What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and under:"
117,IN A NUTSHELL,"If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without thunder."
118,IN A NUTSHELL,
119,IN A NUTSHELL,"Doubt is faith in the main: but faith, on the whole, is doubt:"
120,IN A NUTSHELL,We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe without?
121,IN A NUTSHELL,
122,IN A NUTSHELL,"Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not clover:"
123,IN A NUTSHELL,Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and over.
124,IN A NUTSHELL,
125,IN A NUTSHELL,Two and two may be four: but four and four are not eight:
126,IN A NUTSHELL,Fate and God may be twain: but God is the same thing as fate.
127,IN A NUTSHELL,
128,IN A NUTSHELL,"Ask a man what he thinks, and get from a man what he feels:"
129,IN A NUTSHELL,"God, once caught in the fact, shows you a fair pair of heels."
130,IN A NUTSHELL,
131,IN A NUTSHELL,Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is which:
132,IN A NUTSHELL,"The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk in a ditch."
133,IN A NUTSHELL,
134,IN A NUTSHELL,More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the whole:
135,IN A NUTSHELL,"Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the soul?"
136,IN A NUTSHELL,
137,IN A NUTSHELL,One and two are not one: but one and nothing is two:
138,IN A NUTSHELL,"Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be true."
139,IN A NUTSHELL,
140,IN A NUTSHELL,Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as cocks:
141,IN A NUTSHELL,Then the mammoth was God: now is He a prize ox.
142,IN A NUTSHELL,
143,IN A NUTSHELL,Parallels all things are: yet many of these are askew:
144,IN A NUTSHELL,You are certainly I: but certainly I am not you.
145,IN A NUTSHELL,
146,IN A NUTSHELL,"Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the rock:"
147,IN A NUTSHELL,Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the cock.
148,IN A NUTSHELL,
149,IN A NUTSHELL,"God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we see:"
150,IN A NUTSHELL,"Fiddle, we know, is diddle: and diddle, we take it, is dee."

938,THE KID,"My spirit, in the doorway's pause,"
939,THE KID,Fluttered with fancies in my breast;
940,THE KID,"Obsequious to all decent laws,"
941,THE KID,I felt exceedingly distressed.
942,THE KID,I knew it rude to enter there
943,THE KID,With Mrs. V. in such a state;
944,THE KID,"And, 'neath a magisterial air,"
945,THE KID,Felt actually indelicate.
946,THE KID,I knew the nurse began to grin;
947,THE KID,I turned to greet my Love. Said she--
948,THE KID,"""Confound your modesty, come in!"
949,THE KID,"--What shall we call the darling, V.?"""
950,THE KID,(There are so many charming names!
951,THE KID,"Girls'--Peg, Moll, Doll, Fan, Kate, Blanche, Bab:"
952,THE KID,"Boys'--Mahershahal-hashbaz, James,"
953,THE KID,"Luke, Nick, Dick, Mark, Aminadab.)"
954,THE KID,
955,THE KID,"Lo, as the acorn to the oak,"

959,THE KID,Such is the baby to the man.
960,THE KID,"There, straddling one red arm and leg,"
961,THE KID,"Lay my last work, in length a span,"
962,THE KID,"Half hatched, and conscious of the egg."
963,THE KID,"A creditable child, I hoped;"
964,THE KID,And half a score of joys to be
965,THE KID,Through sunny lengths of prospect sloped
966,THE KID,Smooth to the bland futurity.
967,THE KID,"O, fate surpassing other dooms,"
968,THE KID,"O, hope above all wrecks of time!"
969,THE KID,"O, light that fills all vanquished glooms,"
970,THE KID,"O, silent song o'ermastering rhyme!"
971,THE KID,"I covered either little foot,"
972,THE KID,I drew the strings about its waist;
973,THE KID,"Pink as the unshell'd inner fruit,"
974,THE KID,"But barely decent, hardly chaste,"
975,THE KID,Its nudity had startled me;
976,THE KID,"But when the petticoats were on,"
977,THE KID,"""I know,"" I said; ""its name shall be"
978,THE KID,"Paul Cyril Athanasius John."""
979,THE KID,"""Why,"" said my wife, ""the child's a girl."""
980,THE KID,"My brain swooned, sick with failing sense;"
981,THE KID,"With all perception in a whirl,"
982,THE KID,How could I tell the difference?
983,THE KID,"""Nay,"" smiled the nurse, ""the child's a boy."""
984,THE KID,And all my soul was soothed to hear
985,THE KID,That so it was: then startled Joy
986,THE KID,Mocked Sorrow with a doubtful tear.
987,THE KID,And I was glad as one who sees
988,THE KID,For sensual optics things unmeet:
989,THE KID,"As purity makes passion freeze,"
990,THE KID,So faith warns science off her beat.
991,THE KID,"Blessed are they that have not seen,"
992,THE KID,"And yet, not seeing, have believed:"

997,THE KID,"Truth pins her trust on falsehood's sleeve,"
998,THE KID,While reason blunders by the book.
