40,MRS. HELEN BELL,
41,MRS. HELEN BELL,
42,MRS. HELEN BELL,"There is a room upstairs in the old house at Fruitlands in Harvard,"
43,MRS. HELEN BELL,"Massachusetts, where the visitors pause and look about them with a"
44,MRS. HELEN BELL,"softening glance and often with visible emotion, as though they felt a"
45,MRS. HELEN BELL,sudden nearness to something infinitely intimate and personal. They have
46,MRS. HELEN BELL,come to see the place where Bronson Alcott and the group of
47,MRS. HELEN BELL,transcendentalists cut themselves off from the world in the spring of
48,MRS. HELEN BELL,"1843 and tried to found a New Eden where Evil could find no entrance,"
49,MRS. HELEN BELL,and where all might share in common the peace of an industrious simple
50,MRS. HELEN BELL,"life, intermixed with study and close to the heart of Nature; a"
51,MRS. HELEN BELL,spiritual and intellectual center where mind and soul could grow in
52,MRS. HELEN BELL,"quiet seclusion, yet with sympathetic companionship. This was Alcott's"
53,MRS. HELEN BELL,dream.
54,MRS. HELEN BELL,
55,MRS. HELEN BELL,The comedy and tragedy of the experiment have been the theme of many a
56,MRS. HELEN BELL,"magazine article, and years have come and gone; yet hundreds of people"
57,MRS. HELEN BELL,"cross the pastures to the lonely spot each year, and wander through the"
58,MRS. HELEN BELL,"house, and listen to the story of the joy of the first glad, hopeful"
59,MRS. HELEN BELL,days and the pitiful ending of this philosopher's plan for an earthly
60,MRS. HELEN BELL,Paradise.
61,MRS. HELEN BELL,
62,MRS. HELEN BELL,"There is so much that is quaint to see and seemingly impossible to hear,"
63,MRS. HELEN BELL,for there were some strange theories worked out by this group of learned
64,MRS. HELEN BELL,"men, that a sudden outburst of surprise and amusement will break into"
65,MRS. HELEN BELL,the recital of the tale; but in the room upstairs they are wont to grow
66,MRS. HELEN BELL,"quiet and speak in lowered voices, for they seem to feel the pathos"
67,MRS. HELEN BELL,there of the final disillusionment. It is the room where at the end of a
68,MRS. HELEN BELL,"laborious day Mrs. Alcott, with tired eyes, sewed and sewed, night after"
69,MRS. HELEN BELL,"night, by the light of her one flickering lamp, and where Bronson"
70,MRS. HELEN BELL,"Alcott, deserted by his followers, lay in his bed, with his face turned"
71,MRS. HELEN BELL,"to the wall, and in his despair over the bitter failure of his most"
72,MRS. HELEN BELL,"cherished dream, called upon death to release him."
73,MRS. HELEN BELL,
74,MRS. HELEN BELL,The visitors stand and look at Mrs. Alcott's lace cap on the table by
75,MRS. HELEN BELL,"the window, and the little cuffs that fell over her busy, useful hands;"
76,MRS. HELEN BELL,"at the sewing basket, left where she might have laid it when she was too"
77,MRS. HELEN BELL,wearied to thread another needle; at all the many personal things
78,MRS. HELEN BELL,belonging to them both that speak so clearly of them and seem to bring
79,MRS. HELEN BELL,them very near. And then they turn to read the manuscripts and letters
80,MRS. HELEN BELL,that hang upon the walls; for on the walls at Fruitlands hang various
81,MRS. HELEN BELL,"original manuscripts that as yet have never been published, and among"
82,MRS. HELEN BELL,them are three poems by Louisa Alcott--Bronson Alcott's noted daughter.
83,MRS. HELEN BELL,"These are now put before the public for the first time, and surely they"
84,MRS. HELEN BELL,must stir a warm response in the most indifferent heart.
85,MRS. HELEN BELL,
86,MRS. HELEN BELL,Indelibly impressed upon Louisa Alcott's memory were those days at
87,MRS. HELEN BELL,"Fruitlands, when her childish feet ran swiftly over the pastures and"
88,MRS. HELEN BELL,"through the pine grove, and where in the early mornings she sat upon a"
89,MRS. HELEN BELL,"granite boulder far up on the hill and ""thought thoughts""--so her diary"
90,MRS. HELEN BELL,tells us. She afterwards was frequently heard to say that it was in
91,MRS. HELEN BELL,those days at Fruitlands that the seeds of her literary talents were
92,MRS. HELEN BELL,"sown, which were to meet with such heartfelt appreciation from the"
93,MRS. HELEN BELL,"reading public, and were to give such solace and comfort to the old age"
94,MRS. HELEN BELL,of her gifted father and devoted mother. Her love and reverence for her
95,MRS. HELEN BELL,father and her pride in his attainments were very beautiful: and in
96,MRS. HELEN BELL,order to appreciate what it was in him that inspired this great
97,MRS. HELEN BELL,"sentiment, not only in his daughter, but in so many leading men of that"
98,MRS. HELEN BELL,"time, the eccentricities of the man whom the world called unpractical"
99,MRS. HELEN BELL,"and visionary must be forgotten, so as to get a glimpse of the Alcott"
100,MRS. HELEN BELL,"who was the intimate friend of Emerson--a genius, a philosopher, an"
101,MRS. HELEN BELL,"optimist, in spite of failure and in spite of opposition. Therefore it"
102,MRS. HELEN BELL,seems best to give some extracts from his own writings first that will
103,MRS. HELEN BELL,reveal the tenor of his mind and the largeness of his heart and
104,MRS. HELEN BELL,"intellect, in order that the poems of the daughter may be more fully"
105,MRS. HELEN BELL,"understood. The following extracts are from his book entitled ""Tablets."""
106,MRS. HELEN BELL,
107,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""If one's life is not worshipful,"" he writes, ""no one cares for his"
108,MRS. HELEN BELL,professions.... We recognize goodness wherever we find it. 'Tis the
109,MRS. HELEN BELL,same helpful influence beautifying the meanest as the greatest
110,MRS. HELEN BELL,"service by its manners, as if it did it not."""
111,MRS. HELEN BELL,
112,MRS. HELEN BELL,*       *       *       *       *
113,MRS. HELEN BELL,
114,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""Enthusiasm is existence; earnestness, life's exceeding great"
115,MRS. HELEN BELL,reward....
116,MRS. HELEN BELL,
117,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""Our dispositions are the atmosphere we breathe, and we carry our"
118,MRS. HELEN BELL,"climate and world in ourselves. Good humor, gay spirits, are the"
119,MRS. HELEN BELL,"liberators, ... the sure cure for spleen and melancholy ... and he"
120,MRS. HELEN BELL,"who smiles is never beyond redemption."""
121,MRS. HELEN BELL,
122,MRS. HELEN BELL,*       *       *       *       *
123,MRS. HELEN BELL,
124,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""The liberal mind is of no sect; it shows to sects their departure"
125,MRS. HELEN BELL,"from the ideal standard, and thus maintains pure religion in the"
126,MRS. HELEN BELL,"world. But there are those whose minds, like the pupil of the eye,"
127,MRS. HELEN BELL,contract as the light increases. 'Tis a poor egotism that sees only
128,MRS. HELEN BELL,"its own image reflected in its vision.... 'Only as thou beest it,"
129,MRS. HELEN BELL,"thou seest it!'"""
130,MRS. HELEN BELL,
131,MRS. HELEN BELL,*       *       *       *       *
132,MRS. HELEN BELL,
133,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""One cannot be well read unless well seasoned in thought and"
134,MRS. HELEN BELL,experience. Life makes the man. And he must have lived in all his
135,MRS. HELEN BELL,gifts and become acclimated herein to profit by his readings.
136,MRS. HELEN BELL,"Living at the breadth of Shakespeare, the depth of Plato, the"
137,MRS. HELEN BELL,"height of Christ gives the mastery, ... or if not that, a worthy"
138,MRS. HELEN BELL,"discipleship."""
139,MRS. HELEN BELL,
140,MRS. HELEN BELL,And here is a quotation that reveals his great and beautiful love of
141,MRS. HELEN BELL,Nature:
142,MRS. HELEN BELL,
143,MRS. HELEN BELL,"""Nature is the good Baptist, plunging us in her Jordan streams to"
144,MRS. HELEN BELL,be purified of our stains and fulfil all righteousness. And
145,MRS. HELEN BELL,"wheresoever our lodge, there is but the thin casement between us"
146,MRS. HELEN BELL,"and immensity.... Nature without, Mind within, inviting us forth"
147,MRS. HELEN BELL,"into the solacing air, the blue ether, if we will but shake our"
148,MRS. HELEN BELL,"sloth and cares aside and step forth into her great contentments."""
149,MRS. HELEN BELL,
150,MRS. HELEN BELL,These are enough to show the rarified atmosphere of his thought world.
151,MRS. HELEN BELL,"He lived upon the hilltops, so to speak. And it is curious to note that"
152,MRS. HELEN BELL,"in spite of its derision, the world has come to value many of his ideas"
153,MRS. HELEN BELL,which at first were deemed but foolishness. The importance of taste and
154,MRS. HELEN BELL,"beauty in the schoolroom, for instance, is now accepted throughout the"
155,MRS. HELEN BELL,"world. Yet when he first preached this, what was then a new idea, and"
156,MRS. HELEN BELL,"had the walls of his Temple School in Boston tinted in restful colors,"
157,MRS. HELEN BELL,and placed the busts of Socrates and Plato and other learned
158,MRS. HELEN BELL,philosophers where they could be looked upon with reverence by his
159,MRS. HELEN BELL,"pupils, it was thought to be absurd and even dangerous, for the old"
160,MRS. HELEN BELL,"regime of ill-lighted, ill-ventilated schoolrooms, with bare, forbidding"
161,MRS. HELEN BELL,"walls, was at its height."
162,MRS. HELEN BELL,
163,MRS. HELEN BELL,So also with one of his much-laughed-at theories of farming. He
164,MRS. HELEN BELL,advocated growing buckwheat and turning the crop back into the soil in
165,MRS. HELEN BELL,"order to enrich the land, and all the farmers threw their hands up as"
166,MRS. HELEN BELL,"though he had lost his reason. Yet only a year ago, when the nations"
167,MRS. HELEN BELL,"were at war, the Agricultural Department in Washington sent out"
168,MRS. HELEN BELL,bulletins urging farmers to do this very thing as an admirable and
169,MRS. HELEN BELL,inexpensive method to pursue.
170,MRS. HELEN BELL,
171,MRS. HELEN BELL,"[Illustration: _Picture of Bronson Alcott's famous Temple School,"
172,MRS. HELEN BELL,"Boston, Mass., where he taught his philosophy to young boys and girls."
173,MRS. HELEN BELL,It was the first school to be decorated and furnished with artistic
174,MRS. HELEN BELL,"taste, and he believed it developed a sense of beauty and refinement."
175,MRS. HELEN BELL,1830-1834. The school was in the Masonic Temple._]
176,MRS. HELEN BELL,
177,MRS. HELEN BELL,The fundamental principle of his dietary system was the exclusive use of
178,MRS. HELEN BELL,"fruits, vegetables, and all kinds of grain, eliminating all animal food."
179,MRS. HELEN BELL,"While this was carried to excess, the idea of it does not sound so very"
180,MRS. HELEN BELL,"strange to modern ears, there being plenty of vegetarians now to"
181,MRS. HELEN BELL,commend the theory. These things are mentioned in order to show that in
182,MRS. HELEN BELL,"spite of much that was wholly unpractical, he advocated many theories"
183,MRS. HELEN BELL,"that have not died, but have taken root."
184,MRS. HELEN BELL,
185,MRS. HELEN BELL,It was the intuitive consciousness of the sincerity of his appeal to the
186,MRS. HELEN BELL,world that drew his daughter Louisa so closely to him and led her to
187,MRS. HELEN BELL,express herself so touchingly in the following poems:
188,MRS. HELEN BELL,
189,MRS. HELEN BELL,

213,A. B. A.,He neither asked nor sought;
214,A. B. A.,"Only to serve his fellowmen,"
215,A. B. A.,With heart and word and thought.
216,A. B. A.,"A pilgrim still, but in his pack"
217,A. B. A.,No sins to frighten or oppress;
218,A. B. A.,"But wisdom, morals, piety,"
219,A. B. A.,"To teach, to warn and bless."
220,A. B. A.,
221,A. B. A.,"The world passed by, nor cared to take"
222,A. B. A.,The treasure he could give;
223,A. B. A.,"Apart he sat, content to wait"
224,A. B. A.,And beautifully live;

237,A. B. A.,"Outshines, outlives them all."
238,A. B. A.,
239,A. B. A.,The explanation of the following poem seems to give added color to it.
240,A. B. A.,Mr. Alcott had a habit of cutting his own hair--a feat that can
241,A. B. A.,certainly be called unusual!--and it was after one of these occasions
242,A. B. A.,that Miss Alcott picked up the curl and pasted it on the corner of the
243,A. B. A.,paper upon which the poem is written.

249,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
250,A LITTLE GREY CURL,A little grey curl from my father's head
251,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"I find unburned on the hearth,"
252,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"And give it a place in my diary here,"
253,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"With a feeling half sadness, half mirth."
254,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"For the long white locks are our special pride,"
255,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Though he smiles at his daughter's praise;
256,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"But, oh, they have grown each year more thin,"
257,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Till they are now but a silvery haze.
258,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
259,A LITTLE GREY CURL,That wise old head! (though it does grow bald
260,A LITTLE GREY CURL,With the knocks hard fortune may give)
261,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Has a store of faith and hope and trust,"
262,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Which have taught him how to live.
263,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Though the hat be old, there's a face below"
264,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Which telleth to those who look
265,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"The history of a good man's life,"
266,A LITTLE GREY CURL,And it cheers like a blessed book.
267,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
268,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"[A]A peddler of jewels, of clocks, and of books,"
269,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Many a year of his wandering youth;
270,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"A peddler still, with a far richer pack,"
271,A LITTLE GREY CURL,His wares are wisdom and love and truth.
272,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"But now, as then, few purchase or pause,"
273,A LITTLE GREY CURL,For he cannot learn the tricks of trade;
274,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Little silver he wins, but that which time"
275,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Is sprinkling thick on his meek old head.
276,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
277,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"But there'll come a day when the busy world,"
278,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Grown sick with its folly and pride,"
279,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Will remember the mild-faced peddler then
280,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Whom it rudely had set aside;
281,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Will remember the wares he offered it once
282,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"And will seek to find him again,"
283,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Eager to purchase truth, wisdom, and love,"
284,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"But, oh, it will seek him in vain."
285,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
286,A LITTLE GREY CURL,It will find but his footsteps left behind
287,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Along the byways of life,"
288,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"Where he patiently walked, striving the while"
289,A LITTLE GREY CURL,To quiet its tumult and strife.
290,A LITTLE GREY CURL,But the peddling pilgrim has laid down his pack
291,A LITTLE GREY CURL,And gone with his earnings away;
292,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"How small will they seem, remembering the debt"
293,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Which the world too late would repay.
294,A LITTLE GREY CURL,
295,A LITTLE GREY CURL,God bless the dear head! and crown it with years
296,A LITTLE GREY CURL,Untroubled and calmly serene;
297,A LITTLE GREY CURL,That the autumn of life more golden may be
298,A LITTLE GREY CURL,For the heats and the storms that have been.
299,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"My heritage none can ever dispute,"
300,A LITTLE GREY CURL,My fortune will bring neither strife nor care;
301,A LITTLE GREY CURL,"'Tis an honest name, 'tis a beautiful life,"
302,A LITTLE GREY CURL,And the silver lock of my father's hair.
