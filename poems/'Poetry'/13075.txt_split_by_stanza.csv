47,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The girls were amazed At this great display of speech. Into the great mans eyes they gazed As he proceeded to teach.

49,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The freak was appalled Watching innocence beguiled. The girls were enthralled While the great man smiled. 
50,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Who was being deceived? The freak felt some dismay. The great man the girls believed. And the freak just walked away. 
51,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,It seemed childish to contest. He saw no reason to fight. He thought best not to protest. Both of their answers were right.

53,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"A few weeks quickly went by During which time came a threat. No rain had fallen from the sky, But the ground seemed to be wet. _________________________________________________________________ "
54,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Water trickled like blood from a gash. Soon the streets turned to mud. People could not walk without a splash. There was fear that the town would flood. 
55,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Slowly, this problem would develop. The water would continue to run. Eventually, the whole town it would envelop If something was not soon done. "
56,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Water does not feel sorrow nor care Wherever it trickles and roams. The people were becoming more aware, For it was soon in their homes. "

59,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"I will stop this silly little flood. Upon the great man you can rely. The ground may be covered in mud But, somewhere, must a solution lie! "
60,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"In his office the great man sat Staring at the water on the floor. He knew not how to deal with that, But he knew there would be more. _________________________________________________________________ "
61,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Desperately trying to think of a plan He repeatedly read the plaque on the wall, Here is a Great Man He will save us all! "
62,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The sparkling water had a sense of beauty As it reflected in the plaque. A painful reminder of his duty, A leader must never slack. "
63,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"So, eagerly, he donned his heavy boots, And ventured forth for a walk Through a series of muddy routes, For to the people he must talk. "
64,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The great man noticed one man solitary As he trekked a turbid trail. To the woods with buckets he did carry In a struggling effort his home to bail. 
65,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Though his face he could not see, He knew that this man to be clever and brave. He could not dwell on who it could be For the great man had a town to save. "

67,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Together we must pull! This I must accent! So each man scooped a bucket full And into the woods with the water they went. _________________________________________________________________ 
68,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Soon this method had no effect. The water continued to rise. The people were beginning to suspect, This is not where the solution lies. "
69,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The great man saw this method would fail But he knew he must not quit. Again he trekked the turbid trail To this problem he did commit. 
70,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Then the great man saw a lone man dig A trench in which the water would drop. He dug it deep and he dug it big. Perhaps, in this trench, the water would stop! "
71,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"He thought of the people, as his duty required To give them this instruction. By this site he was again inspired To save the town from destruction. "
72,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,We must dig a great ditch In which the water will drop. Into this we all must pitch If the water we are to stop! 
73,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"A solution to this we must seek. Look to me in your time of need. Though the situation may now look bleak, We will succeed with my lead! "
74,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Upon his shoulder, he felt a hand. It was, in fact, the odd man. The great man, at first, did not understand. Then the freak thus began, _________________________________________________________________ "
75,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"You may be great and the people strong, But this wont stop the waters force. This will not work for very long. We must stop it at the source. "
76,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The great man let out a great big laugh, And to the odd man he talked down. You think you can speak on the peoples behalf? A great man must save this town! We all share the same concern. Your offer I do appreciate, However, to experience, we must now turn. This issue is too great. "
77,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,As the great man continued to give his speech The freak had turned and walked away. A solution soon someone must reach No matter what the great man would say. 
78,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Soon the town will certainly be Just a huge pool of mud. It is not really hard to see That nothing is stopping this great flood. 
79,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"His mind was cloudy and his feet were muddy. While the great man talked and talked, The freak used this time to think and study, So in search of the source he walked. "
80,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The freak followed the water alone. Deep into the woods he was led. There he found a slab of stone. On the stone it read, _________________________________________________________________ "
81,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"In the event of a flood This lesson should be learned Unless you like to live in mud, The valve must be turned. "
82,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Below these words there was an arrow And it was pointing to the creek. The creek had begun to overflow. This was, no doubt, the source of the leak. "
83,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The freak was indeed happy to learn How the flood had been produced. He found the valve and gave it a turn. And the water immediately was reduced. 
84,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"He went back up the muddy trail And told the people what he had done. But no one would believe his tale, Not a single, solitary one. "
85,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Afraid of being deceived, The people showed only doubt, Why should he be believed? What is he all about? "
86,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Skepticism and emotion Were sparked by the freaks word. His story caused quite a commotion, And the great man, of course, overheard. He said, I will solve this dispute. Whatever the problem, there must be a plan. Of the truth, we are in pursuit. A great problem requires a great man! _________________________________________________________________ "
87,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Id like a word, please come with me, To the freak the great man said. The freak complied with his plea. To the great mans office he was led. "
88,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Once in his office, he closed the door. He could not wait to ask, What did you do, I want to hear more, About how you pursued this task. "
89,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,As the freak began to describe The valve at the creek and slab of stone. The great man was not willing to subscribe To this story by a man who lives alone. 
90,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The great man was in disbelief. He began to give the freak a speech. His talk was not short, nor was it brief. To the freak, a lesson he would teach. "
91,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"He told the freak about being great, And that by his word he would rule. Being a master at debate, He made the freak look like a fool. "
92,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"From the office the freak went, Stuck on the words the great man had said. He walked the path back home in resent, As the great mans voice he heard in his head. "
93,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Its obvious that the town is his. He could hear the people as he walked through. Who in the world does he think he is? He thinks he is a great man too! _________________________________________________________________ 
94,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The farther he walked the angrier he became, To think that words could outshine skill. Great man, bah...what a name! Ill show them all, I will! "
95,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Into the forest, he marched in retaliation. He felt the need to settle the score. He could not bear this indignation. This town was not his home anymore. "
96,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,He found again the slab of stone. He found again the valve by the creek. Never before had he felt so alone. Revenge now did he seek. 
97,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"In his anger, he turned the valve back. The water began to overflow. He thought, for a moment, about this attack. Then he decided the people must know. "
98,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"On the way back, he felt some guilt. His conscience was big and his mind was young. Upon action his existence was built. Once back in town, he held his tongue. "
99,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The town again began to flood. And the people again began to worry. The ground again had turned to mud. To their buckets again the people would hurry. 
100,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The efforts again the great man would direct, But an effort repeated is a lesson taught. Soon the bucket method had no effect, And this sent the great man into thought. _________________________________________________________________ "
101,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The man with the bucket, he only saw from afar. And the man in the trench, never showed his face. He began to feel that this was bizarre, And then this pattern, he began to trace. "
102,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"These men were indeed one and the same! The great man was struck with revelation. This peculiar freak, with no name, Had been the source of his inspiration! "
103,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"He headed down the muddy trail, Into the forest he would withdraw. There he dropped his water pale. He could not believe what he saw. "
104,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"There he found a slab of stone Just as the freak had said. He wondered how this could go unknown As the words on the stone he read, "
105,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"In the event of a flood This lesson should be learned Unless you like to live in mud, The valve must be turned. "
106,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,Below these words there was an arrow And it was pointing to the creek. The creek had begun to overflow. No doubt this was the source of the leak. 
107,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,The great man was indeed happy to learn How the flood had been produced. He found the valve and gave it a turn. And the water immediately was reduced. _________________________________________________________________ 
108,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"He went back up the muddy trail, And told the people what he had done. The people all gathered to hear his tale, And all were intrigued, but one. "
109,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Knowledge is power, the great man began. A man who knows power is a man who is wise. The greater the problem, the greater the man Who can find the answer thats little in size. "
110,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"Great men do heroic deeds. Over the common men they tower. Great men are what this town needs... Men who face danger, and do not cower. "
111,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"I am a great man, but a hero am I? Thats a title I cannot claim. There are those whose talent we may deny, But they are heroes just the same. "
112,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"As they heard those words so profound, The people hailed the great man and cheered. The freak looked down at the ground. He knew to them he would always seem weird. "
113,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The girls who argued about the sun walked by. They offered him words so sweet, Youre a nice man, theres no need to cry. Hes a great man, and he cant be beat. "
114,ISBN 0-9746226-0-5,"The freak looked at the girls and smiled. He could see that a leader is all they need. Its noble to protect the innocence of a child. Yes, he said, He is a great man indeed. "
