116,SONG: MY SPIRIT LIKE A SHEPHERD BOY,Goes dancing down the lane.

134,CONVALESCENCE,"WHEN I am in the Orient once again,"
135,CONVALESCENCE,"And turn into the gay and squalid street,"
136,CONVALESCENCE,"One side in the shadow, one in vivid heat,"
137,CONVALESCENCE,"The thought of England, fresh beneath the rain,"
138,CONVALESCENCE,Will rise unbidden as a gently pain.
139,CONVALESCENCE,"The lonely hours of illness, as they beat"
140,CONVALESCENCE,"Crawling through days with slow laborious feet,"
141,CONVALESCENCE,"And I lay gazing through the leaded pane,"
142,CONVALESCENCE,"Idle, and listened to the swallows' cry"
143,CONVALESCENCE,"After the flitting insect swiftly caught,"
144,CONVALESCENCE,"--Those all-too-leisured hours as they went by,"
145,CONVALESCENCE,Stamped as their heritage upon my thought
146,CONVALESCENCE,The memory of a square of summer sky
147,CONVALESCENCE,Jagged by the gables of a Gothic court.

152,TO KNOLE,"October 1, 1913"
153,TO KNOLE,
154,I,I
155,I,"I LEFT thee in the crowds and in the light,"
156,I,And if I laughed or sorrowed none could tell.
157,I,They could not know our true and deep farewell
158,I,Was spoken in the long preceding night.
159,I,
160,I,Thy mighty shadow in the garden's dip!
161,I,"To others dormant, but to me awake;"
162,I,"I saw a window in the moonlight shake,"
163,I,"And traced the angle of the gable's lip,"
164,I,
165,I,"And knew thy soul, benign and grave and mild,"
166,I,"Towards me, morsel of morality,"
167,I,"And grieving at the parting soon to be,"
168,I,A patriarch about to lose a child.
169,I,
170,I,"For many come and soon their tale is told,"
171,I,"And thou remainest, dimly feeling pain,"
172,I,Aware the time draws near to don again
173,I,The sober mourning of the very old.
174,I,
175,II,II
176,II,Pictures and galleries and empty rooms!
177,II,Small wonder that my games were played alone;
178,II,"Half of the rambling house to call my own,"
179,II,And wooded gardens with mysterious glooms.
180,II,
181,II,My fingers ran among the tassels faded;
182,II,My playmates moved in arrases brocaded;
183,II,I slept beside the canopied and shaded
184,II,Beds of forgotten kings.
185,II,I wandered shoeless in the galleries;
186,II,"I contemplated long the tapestries,"
187,II,And loved the ladies for their histories
188,II,And hands with many rings.
189,II,
190,II,Beneath an oriel window facing south
191,II,Through which the unniggard sun poured morning
192,II,"streams,"
193,II,"I daily stood and laughing drank the beams,"
194,II,"And, catching fistfuls, pressed them in my mouth."
195,II,
196,II,"This I remember, and the carven oak,"
197,II,"The long and polished floors, the many stairs,"
198,II,"Th' heraldic windows, and the velvet chairs,"
199,II,"And portraits that I knew so well, they almost spoke."
200,II,
201,III,III
202,III,"So I have loved thee, as a lonely child"
203,III,Might love the kind and venerable sire
204,III,"With whom he lived, and whom at youthful fire"
205,III,"Had ever sagely, tolerantly smiled;"
206,III,
207,III,In whose old weathered brain a boundless store
208,III,Lay hid of riches never to be spent;
209,III,Who often to the coaxing child unbent
210,III,In hours' enchantment of delightful lore.
211,III,
212,III,"So in the night we parted, friend of years,"
213,III,I rose a stranger to thee on the morrow;
214,III,"Thy stateliness knows neither joy nor sorrow,--"
215,III,I will not wound such dignity by tears.

219,DISILLUSION,DISILLUSION
220,DISILLUSION,
221,DISILLUSION,I WROTE the burning words to you
222,DISILLUSION,That meant so much to me.
223,DISILLUSION,"I sent them speeding straight to you,"
224,DISILLUSION,To you across the sea;
225,DISILLUSION,I waited with sure reckoning
226,DISILLUSION,For your reply to me.
227,DISILLUSION,
228,DISILLUSION,"I waited, and the counted day"
229,DISILLUSION,Fruitlessly came and went;
230,DISILLUSION,"I made excuse for the delay,"
231,DISILLUSION,Pitiable confident.
232,DISILLUSION,I knew to-morrow's light must bring
233,DISILLUSION,The words you must have sent.
234,DISILLUSION,
235,DISILLUSION,And still I stand on that dim verge
236,DISILLUSION,And look across the sea;
237,DISILLUSION,The waves have changed into a dirge
238,DISILLUSION,Their volubility.
239,DISILLUSION,And in my disillusioned heart
240,DISILLUSION,Is a little grave for me.
241,DISILLUSION,
242,DISILLUSION,But still with shaded eyes I gaze
243,DISILLUSION,"As mournfully I sing,"
244,DISILLUSION,"And one by one the trailing days,"
245,DISILLUSION,"As they no message bring,"
246,DISILLUSION,Fall with their slow monotony
247,DISILLUSION,As beads fall from a string.

251,THE BANQUET,THE BANQUET
252,THE BANQUET,
253,THE BANQUET,WINE ran; rich yellow wine upon the marble floor
254,THE BANQUET,Recklessly spilled; the Nubians ran to pour
255,THE BANQUET,A fresh libation; and to scatter showers
256,THE BANQUET,Of red rose petals; candles overturned
257,THE BANQUET,"Smouldered among the ruins of the flowers,"
258,THE BANQUET,And overhead swung heavy shadowy bowers
259,THE BANQUET,"Of blue and purple grapes,"
260,THE BANQUET,And strange fantastic shapes
261,THE BANQUET,"Of varied birds, where lanterns hung and dimly burned."
262,THE BANQUET,
263,THE BANQUET,"The melon and the orange, turned to use"
264,THE BANQUET,"As golden balls with laughter lightly tossed,"
265,THE BANQUET,"Lay burst and drained of their sweet juice,"
266,THE BANQUET,Uselessly ripened and for ever lost;
267,THE BANQUET,"All glowing as they lay upon the ground,"
268,THE BANQUET,"As envious of their fellows,"
269,THE BANQUET,"Who, piled in luscious reds and yellows,"
270,THE BANQUET,"Enriched the tables all around,"
271,THE BANQUET,"The tables low,"
272,THE BANQUET,Sheltering the reclining grace;
273,THE BANQUET,"Here, through the curling smoke, a swarthy face,"
274,THE BANQUET,"And jewelled turban bound about the head,"
275,THE BANQUET,And here the glow
276,THE BANQUET,Of red carnation pressed to lips as warmly red.
277,THE BANQUET,
278,THE BANQUET,"And as they lay in their luxurious ease,"
279,THE BANQUET,"Playing with grapes and rose-leaves, slim"
280,THE BANQUET,"And willowy slave-girls, in the hope to please,"
281,THE BANQUET,"Twisted and danced before them, to the dim"
282,THE BANQUET,Uncertain music in the shadows played;
283,THE BANQUET,"Some came with supple limb,"
284,THE BANQUET,With Mystery's aid
285,THE BANQUET,"And snake-like creep,"
286,THE BANQUET,Others with riotous leap
287,THE BANQUET,And made festivity to Bacchus wed;
288,THE BANQUET,"Others with stiff Egyptian tread,"
289,THE BANQUET,"And straight black hair hanging in glossy braid,"
290,THE BANQUET,"They danced, unnoted, and exhausted fled."
291,THE BANQUET,*      *      *      *      *
292,THE BANQUET,Still floated from beneath the acacia-tree
293,THE BANQUET,The droning Eastern music's minor key.

297,MCMXIII,
298,MCMXIII,"SO prodigal was I of youth,"
299,MCMXIII,Forgetting I was young;
300,MCMXIII,"I worshipped dead men for their strength,"
301,MCMXIII,Forgetting I was strong.
302,MCMXIII,
303,MCMXIII,"I cherished old, jejune advice;"
304,MCMXIII,I thought I groped for truth;
305,MCMXIII,Those dead old languages I learned
306,MCMXIII,When I was prodigal of youth!
307,MCMXIII,
308,MCMXIII,"Then in the sunlight stood a boy,"
309,MCMXIII,"Outstretching either hand,"
310,MCMXIII,"Palm upwards, cup-like, and between"
311,MCMXIII,The fingers trickled sand.
312,MCMXIII,
313,MCMXIII,"""Oh, why so grave"" he cried to me,"
314,MCMXIII,"""Laugh, stern lips, laugh at last!"
315,MCMXIII,Let wisdom come when wisdom may.
316,MCMXIII,"The sand is running fast."""
317,MCMXIII,
318,MCMXIII,"I followed him into the sun,"
319,MCMXIII,"And laughed as he desired,"
320,MCMXIII,And every day upon the grass
321,MCMXIII,We play till we are tired.

326,A CREED,
327,A CREED,THAT I should live and look with open eyes
328,A CREED,I count as half my claim to Paradise.
329,A CREED,"I have not crept beneath cathedral arches,"
330,A CREED,But bathed in streams beneath the silver larches;
331,A CREED,
332,A CREED,"And have not grovelled to the Sunday priest,"
333,A CREED,But found an unconfined and daily feast;
334,A CREED,"Was called ungodly, and to those who blamed"
335,A CREED,Laughed back defiance and was not ashamed.
336,A CREED,
337,A CREED,Some hold their duty to be mournful; why?
338,A CREED,I cannot love your weeping poets; I
339,A CREED,"Am sad in winter, but in summer gay,"
340,A CREED,And vary with each variable day.
341,A CREED,
342,A CREED,"And though the pious cavilled at my mirth,"
343,A CREED,"At least I rendered thanks for God's fair earth,"
344,A CREED,"Grateful that I, among the murmuring rest,"
345,A CREED,Was not an unappreciative guest.

446,THE DANCING ELF*,
447,THE DANCING ELF*,"I WOKE to daylight, and to find"
448,THE DANCING ELF*,"A wreath of fading vine-leaves, rough entwined,"
449,THE DANCING ELF*,"Lying, as dropped in hasty flight, upon my floor."
450,THE DANCING ELF*,
451,THE DANCING ELF*,"Dropped from thy head, sweet Spirit of the night,"
452,THE DANCING ELF*,"Who cam'st, with footstep light,"
453,THE DANCING ELF*,"Blown in by the soft breeze, as thistledown,"
454,THE DANCING ELF*,In through my open door.
455,THE DANCING ELF*,"Whence? From the woodland, from the fields of corn,"
456,THE DANCING ELF*,"From flirting airily with the bright moon,"
457,THE DANCING ELF*,"Playing throughout the hours that go too soon,"
458,THE DANCING ELF*,"Ready to fly at the approach of morn,"
459,THE DANCING ELF*,"Thou cam'st,"
460,THE DANCING ELF*,Bent on the curious quest
461,THE DANCING ELF*,To see what mortal guest
462,THE DANCING ELF*,Dwelt in the one-roomed cottage built to face the
463,THE DANCING ELF*,dawn.
464,THE DANCING ELF*,
465,THE DANCING ELF*,Thou didst pause
466,THE DANCING ELF*,"Shy, timid, on the threshold, though there laughed"
467,THE DANCING ELF*,"The mischief in thy roguish eyes, then soft,"
468,THE DANCING ELF*,"Thou crosst the room on tiptoe to my bed,"
469,THE DANCING ELF*,"One finger on thy lip,"
470,THE DANCING ELF*,"Cautious to make no slip,"
471,THE DANCING ELF*,--I saw the wreath of vine-leaves on thy head.
472,THE DANCING ELF*,
473,THE DANCING ELF*,Then with a twirl
474,THE DANCING ELF*,"Thinking I slept,"
475,THE DANCING ELF*,"And a joyous whirl,"
476,THE DANCING ELF*,Into a dance leapt
477,THE DANCING ELF*,The careless spirit too long restrained;
478,THE DANCING ELF*,"The purest dancing,"
479,THE DANCING ELF*,Feet sometimes chancing
480,THE DANCING ELF*,To touch the ground;
481,THE DANCING ELF*,"Then starting up with a fresh high bound,"
482,THE DANCING ELF*,"To hang for a moment poised in the air,"
483,THE DANCING ELF*,And a glimpse of white teeth glancing
484,THE DANCING ELF*,And a laughing face beneath tossing hair;
485,THE DANCING ELF*,"An orgy, a revel, a living joy,"
486,THE DANCING ELF*,"Embodied in one slim woodland boy,"
487,THE DANCING ELF*,"Dancing forward, backward, now here, now there,"
488,THE DANCING ELF*,Swaying to every impulse unconstrained.
489,THE DANCING ELF*,
490,THE DANCING ELF*,"Thou wert too pure for Bacchus, and too young for"
491,THE DANCING ELF*,Pan.
492,THE DANCING ELF*,What wert thou? In the daytime dost thou sleep
493,THE DANCING ELF*,In a cave
