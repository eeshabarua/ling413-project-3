109,INTRODUCTION,
110,INTRODUCTION,From time immemorial it has been assumed that poetry is something which
111,INTRODUCTION,"is caviare to the general public. A ""poem"" even to-day is supposed to be"
112,INTRODUCTION,a literary composition that is in artificial language arranged in a
113,INTRODUCTION,"metrical pattern, often conveying a trite idea or enshrining an"
114,INTRODUCTION,ineffective image. Thousands of volumes and essays have been written on
115,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, and instead of fathoming a true conception of its nature, they"
116,INTRODUCTION,have dealt with the trappings and garments which clothe it; these indeed
117,INTRODUCTION,"have often been confused with poetry itself. As a result, there has"
118,INTRODUCTION,grown around the pathway leading to poetry an endless maze of shrubbery.
119,INTRODUCTION,"The reader who has no knowledge of rules and laws relating to verse, who"
120,INTRODUCTION,"is ignorant of technical requirements and established uses, labors under"
121,INTRODUCTION,the delusion that he does not like poetry. Though he reads many works in
122,INTRODUCTION,"prose that stir a deep emotional appeal within him, he does not regard"
123,INTRODUCTION,himself as one of those lovers who haunt the foot of Parnassus Hill.
124,INTRODUCTION,
125,INTRODUCTION,I wish in this volume to present a conception of poetry freed from
126,INTRODUCTION,academic and conventional standards. I wish to restore to the term
127,INTRODUCTION,poetry its primary and fundamental significance as a verbal composition
128,INTRODUCTION,in which the predominating feature is ecstasy. Poetry is an emotional
129,INTRODUCTION,atmosphere that pervades all literature in its finest parts; it
130,INTRODUCTION,characterizes any purely personal expression of the creative
131,INTRODUCTION,"imagination. As the reader perceives, my definition of poetry includes"
132,INTRODUCTION,prose literature in which ecstasy is present. I do not think of poetry
133,INTRODUCTION,"as a branch of literature couched in a metrical form, following regular"
134,INTRODUCTION,"rules of rhythm, diction, figures of speech or rhyme. My conception of"
135,INTRODUCTION,"poetry then, is not that of a department of literature which is opposed"
136,INTRODUCTION,"to prose, but of an emotional spirit hovering over any kind of writing,"
137,INTRODUCTION,"whether in verse or prose, which conveys ecstasy."
138,INTRODUCTION,
139,INTRODUCTION,I shall try to show especially that the prose literature of ecstasy
140,INTRODUCTION,fulfils all the intrinsic conditions which have been associated with
141,INTRODUCTION,"poetry. I shall consider the question of how much, or rather how little,"
142,INTRODUCTION,the element of rhythm or any other pattern is essential in determining
143,INTRODUCTION,"the nature of poetry. In fact, I shall even maintain that prose"
144,INTRODUCTION,"irregularly rhythmical or even unrhythmical,[10:A] just as the"
145,INTRODUCTION,"exigencies of the emotion require, is the natural language of the"
146,INTRODUCTION,"emotions, that it was so at the very beginnings of literary history, and"
147,INTRODUCTION,has in fact never ceased being used as such a vehicle. I shall further
148,INTRODUCTION,take the position that the set forms of verse which have grown up among
149,INTRODUCTION,"all nations as a vesture for emotional writing, have been more or less"
150,INTRODUCTION,pervaded with artificiality. The final judgment as to the nature of
151,INTRODUCTION,poetry resides in the appeal to the emotions. The test of poetry is not
152,INTRODUCTION,"in the form which the writer uses, or in compliance with rules of"
153,INTRODUCTION,"prosody, but in the soul of the reader or hearer. If two emotional"
154,INTRODUCTION,"passages, one in a set pattern and one in prose have the same effect"
155,INTRODUCTION,"upon the responsive mechanism of the human soul, if they both arouse"
156,INTRODUCTION,"ecstasy, it matters not if you refuse to call the prose passage poetry;"
157,INTRODUCTION,"its effect is however that of poetry. It stirs and moves you to rapture,"
158,INTRODUCTION,"it is a product of the author's unconscious, it speaks from soul to"
159,INTRODUCTION,"soul, it is beautiful in its expressiveness, it has a rhythm of its own."
160,INTRODUCTION,I shall not be concerned if you refuse to call this emotional prose
161,INTRODUCTION,"passage poetry, but it does belong to the literature of ecstasy, and"
162,INTRODUCTION,ecstasy was and is the first condition of poetic composition. The poetry
163,INTRODUCTION,in verse is but part of the literature of ecstasy.
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,I shall hence deal in this volume largely with emotional or impassioned
166,INTRODUCTION,"prose; for it belongs to the literature of ecstasy, although it is often"
167,INTRODUCTION,"termed poetic prose, or sometimes disparagingly, prose poetry. Under"
168,INTRODUCTION,"this term I shall include not only the so-called ""fine writing"" but"
169,INTRODUCTION,"emotional passages in the language of the average man, dialogues from"
170,INTRODUCTION,"prose dramas, novels and short stories, and I shall also regard"
171,INTRODUCTION,"criticism, essays and works on science and philosophy highly charged"
172,INTRODUCTION,with feeling as part of the province of the literature of ecstasy.
173,INTRODUCTION,
174,INTRODUCTION,"This work becomes thus a treatise on poetics, and will present a new"
175,INTRODUCTION,definition of poetry which will include all emotional prose writing.
176,INTRODUCTION,
177,INTRODUCTION,A very important phase of the subject will take in the connection
178,INTRODUCTION,"between poetry or the literature of ecstasy, and various spheres of"
179,INTRODUCTION,"human thought, such as ethical and social questions. The _idea_ will be"
180,INTRODUCTION,"shown to be an important factor in the literature of ecstasy, for"
181,INTRODUCTION,ecstasy does not preclude the intellectual and moral activities. The
182,INTRODUCTION,notion of art for art's sake thus assumes a rather trivial aspect. Any
183,INTRODUCTION,"idea whether scientific or philosophic, moral or social, if ecstatically"
184,INTRODUCTION,"presented, becomes itself literature of ecstasy, or poetry."
185,INTRODUCTION,
186,INTRODUCTION,Should the reader conclude to accept the prose literature of ecstasy as
187,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, he will find there was much poetry in the world's prose"
188,INTRODUCTION,literature that he has never recognized as such. He will also be
189,INTRODUCTION,"compelled to admit that much of what has been called poetry, because"
190,INTRODUCTION,"written in verse, does not properly belong to poetry, as not being of"
191,INTRODUCTION,the literature of ecstasy. He will also see that the artificial
192,INTRODUCTION,"classifications of the different kinds of poetry, such as epic,"
193,INTRODUCTION,"dramatic, pastoral, satirical, the ode, the sonnet, the ballad, the"
194,INTRODUCTION,"didactic poem, the idyl, the elegy, etc., were based on fallacies and"
195,INTRODUCTION,"were confusing and erroneous. There is only one species of poetry, the"
196,INTRODUCTION,"utterance of the ecstatic state, and this is always personal, whether in"
197,INTRODUCTION,"verse or prose, and hence, has a lyrical quality. If the poet gives the"
198,INTRODUCTION,"utterances of other people in ecstatic states, these also are lyrics."
199,INTRODUCTION,"Hence every composition whether in verse or prose, that records ecstasy"
200,INTRODUCTION,"here and there, is lyrical in those parts where the ecstasy is depicted."
201,INTRODUCTION,
202,INTRODUCTION,"The distinction between prose and verse will be more clearly defined, if"
203,INTRODUCTION,we refer to the poetry that is written in both these forms as poetry in
204,INTRODUCTION,"verse, and poetry in prose."
205,INTRODUCTION,
206,INTRODUCTION,"Sidney, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Whitman, all of whom, besides"
207,INTRODUCTION,"being great poets themselves, were probably the greatest critics of"
208,INTRODUCTION,"poetry in the English language, took cognizance of the fact that the"
209,INTRODUCTION,great emotional prose writers of the world were poets. But most of the
210,INTRODUCTION,critics have resented this attitude and have gone on in the unjust
211,INTRODUCTION,"classifications that recognize as a poet the petty rhymster, who is"
212,INTRODUCTION,often barren of both emotions and ideas. They also deny the glorious
213,INTRODUCTION,epithet of poet to many great prose masters of the delineation of human
214,INTRODUCTION,passions.
215,INTRODUCTION,
216,INTRODUCTION,"The question of free verse, naturally will come in for consideration. I"
217,INTRODUCTION,shall show that it is really rhythmical prose arranged so as to call
218,INTRODUCTION,"attention to the rhythms. I believe, however, that the free verse"
219,INTRODUCTION,writers have a right to make such linear arrangement. The bulk of the
220,INTRODUCTION,"poetry of the future may very likely be written in free verse forms, or"
221,INTRODUCTION,"in prose. If much of the free verse of to-day fails in being poetry, it"
222,INTRODUCTION,"is not because of the form, but because there is no ecstasy in it, or in"
223,INTRODUCTION,the poet's soul. Most of the poetry of the Bible is really in free
224,INTRODUCTION,"verse; it is poetry, however, not because of the free verse, but because"
225,INTRODUCTION,it presents universal phases of human ecstasy.
226,INTRODUCTION,
227,INTRODUCTION,I have expressly ignored most of the great authors who wrote epics and
228,INTRODUCTION,"dramas in verse, and also most of the great English verse poets, for I"
229,INTRODUCTION,wish to arrive at a conception of poetry chiefly from prose examples.
230,INTRODUCTION,Most critics have assumed that they could never learn what poetry was
231,INTRODUCTION,"unless they gave examples from men like Homer and Shakespeare, Sophocles"
232,INTRODUCTION,"and Dante, Spenser and Milton. I rarely quote from them, not because I"
233,INTRODUCTION,"do not recognize the greatest poetry in these authors, but because I"
234,INTRODUCTION,wish to show that one may arrive at a true conception of the nature of
235,INTRODUCTION,poetry by illustrations from prose writers of ecstatic literature alone.
236,INTRODUCTION,
237,INTRODUCTION,Although I feel that the artificial verse forms hamper instead of
238,INTRODUCTION,"beautify the expression of the poet's emotions, I do not think that such"
239,INTRODUCTION,"forms ever will be, nor need be utterly abandoned. Man will always love"
240,INTRODUCTION,"a ringing, rhyming ballad or song."
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"I have devoted a chapter to the poetry of the most poetical nation, the"
243,INTRODUCTION,Arabs; their poets produced the anomaly of utilizing the most artificial
244,INTRODUCTION,"metres, and yet never lost sight of the fact that ecstasy was the very"
245,INTRODUCTION,life of the poem. Probably no poets in the world have produced such
246,INTRODUCTION,exquisite love poetry as the Arabs; they have also had great influence
247,INTRODUCTION,"on modern European poetry, for it is being recognized that modern"
248,INTRODUCTION,"romantic fiction, especially in its employment of the tenderness of the"
249,INTRODUCTION,"love sentiment as a frequent theme, was transplanted from them."
250,INTRODUCTION,
251,INTRODUCTION,"Poetry is the soul of literature, and we should cease limiting the term"
252,INTRODUCTION,"to rhythmical or patterned productions, and apply it to emotional"
253,INTRODUCTION,writing in general. No term for the word poet in any language that I am
254,INTRODUCTION,acquainted with includes in its etymological significance the idea of
255,INTRODUCTION,rhythm or metrical pattern. The Hebrew word for poet is one who utters
256,INTRODUCTION,"prophecies or parables; the Greek word signifies a ""maker""; the Latin"
257,INTRODUCTION,"word ""seer,"" the Arabian word ""one who knows."" Critics of the Bible have"
258,INTRODUCTION,especially recognized that the chief characteristic of both the true and
259,INTRODUCTION,the false prophet (Nabi) was the ecstatic state; the Bible itself is of
260,INTRODUCTION,"course authority for this fact. The inferior prophet was one, however,"
261,INTRODUCTION,"in whom the ecstatic state was hypnotically produced, in whom the"
262,INTRODUCTION,rational and moral faculties were suspended; the great prophets were
263,INTRODUCTION,those in whom a powerful sense of social justice was illuminated by the
264,INTRODUCTION,ecstatic state; hence the prophecies of the Bible are not orations
265,INTRODUCTION,"wherein rhetoric is a factor, but genuine literature of ecstasy, or"
266,INTRODUCTION,"poetry in rhythmical prose, using parallelism."
267,INTRODUCTION,
268,INTRODUCTION,"I need not continue to give analyses of the Greek ""poetes,"" the Latin"
269,INTRODUCTION,"""vates,"" or the Arabian ""shair,"" for it has been usually conceded that"
270,INTRODUCTION,these words all refer in their primary significance to the imaginative
271,INTRODUCTION,"work, or ecstatic state of the author, and not to the mere dabbler in"
272,INTRODUCTION,verse forms.
273,INTRODUCTION,
274,INTRODUCTION,"With theories of poetry being a product of the unconscious, as"
275,INTRODUCTION,"developed by Freud and his disciples, or as being expression as advanced"
276,INTRODUCTION,"by Croce, my task does not become so utterly devoid of reason as may"
277,INTRODUCTION,appear at first sight. One must not forget that the critics of poetry
278,INTRODUCTION,have formed their conceptions of poetry by deducing rules from the verse
279,INTRODUCTION,"poems of the world's literature. Instead of looking ahead, they have"
280,INTRODUCTION,"always looked back. Whenever a new great poet appeared, like Wordsworth,"
281,INTRODUCTION,"Whitman or Ibsen for instance, they had to modify their theories, and to"
282,INTRODUCTION,revise their books on poetics and rhetoric. If the productions of Homer
283,INTRODUCTION,"and Æschylus had been entirely different, we no doubt would have had"
284,INTRODUCTION,other conceptions of poetry prevailing. Yet it is only by mere accident
285,INTRODUCTION,"that Homer dealt with gods, wars, mythical events and employed dactylic"
286,INTRODUCTION,hexameter. It is again also by pure chance that Æschylus used various
287,INTRODUCTION,"metres, made Prometheus and the Furies living beings, was sponsor for a"
288,INTRODUCTION,philosophy of divine punishment and often indulged in artificial
289,INTRODUCTION,"diction. Had these poets written novels instead, conveying just as much"
290,INTRODUCTION,"genius and ecstasy as they did in their verse works, the critics of"
291,INTRODUCTION,poetry would have deduced an entirely different conception of it.
292,INTRODUCTION,
293,INTRODUCTION,To Democritus belongs the honor of having first recognized among the
294,INTRODUCTION,Greeks that ecstasy is the condition of the poet. To Plato goes the
295,INTRODUCTION,distinction for having fully developed this theory. Aristotle accepted
296,INTRODUCTION,also the view that poetry is ecstasy. The author of the ancient treatise
297,INTRODUCTION,_On the Sublime_ perceived that the characteristic of poetic genius is
298,INTRODUCTION,"in the arousing of the ecstatic state. He says, in a passage which"
299,INTRODUCTION,"deserves citation: ""For it is not to persuasion (i. e., rhetoric) but to"
300,INTRODUCTION,"ecstasy that passages of extraordinary genius carry the hearer."""
301,INTRODUCTION,
302,INTRODUCTION,But the ultimate significance of my volume is not concerned with the
303,INTRODUCTION,"prose form of poetry, but with poetry as a psychological process, as a"
304,INTRODUCTION,social force and as a philosophical expression.
305,INTRODUCTION,
306,INTRODUCTION,"Ecstasy, imagination, and the unconscious are all convertible and"
307,INTRODUCTION,synonymous terms for the primary source of poetry. They are the fruitage
308,INTRODUCTION,"of the turmoil of the soul, due to the apparently forgotten memories in"
309,INTRODUCTION,us of the emotional lives in all our ancestors. They represent also the
310,INTRODUCTION,"impassioned activities of our logical and rational faculties, the sum of"
311,INTRODUCTION,"the views of life of the past. They emanate from the dream life of man,"
312,INTRODUCTION,whether this occurs in the waking or sleeping state. They are the
313,INTRODUCTION,workings of the force we call inspiration.
314,INTRODUCTION,
315,INTRODUCTION,"My view of poetry as emotional prose literature enables me, I hope, to"
316,INTRODUCTION,eliminate many of the so-called conflicts between poetry and philosophy
317,INTRODUCTION,and between poetry and morals. Philosophical and moral essays become
318,INTRODUCTION,poetry in those parts lit up by ecstasy or emotion. If philosophy deals
319,INTRODUCTION,"with rare and profound truths in regard to the universe, if morals treat"
320,INTRODUCTION,"of the noblest relations between man and man, then I know of no higher"
321,INTRODUCTION,"form of poetry than a philosophical truth, or a moral or social"
322,INTRODUCTION,"conception, when ecstatically stated; I can think of no higher"
323,INTRODUCTION,literature of ecstasy than the imaginative utterance of great
324,INTRODUCTION,intellectual conceptions or impassioned expression of the love of
325,INTRODUCTION,"justice. Shakespeare's line, ""We are but such stuff as dreams are made"
326,INTRODUCTION,"of,"" is but a metaphysical theory emotionally put; Isaiah's rebuke to"
327,INTRODUCTION,"the corrupt rich is but a didactic saw, ecstatically delivered. Poetry"
328,INTRODUCTION,finds its best material in metaphysical and ethical truths emotionally
329,INTRODUCTION,"presented. Lofty ideas, however, and not commonplace deductions or"
330,INTRODUCTION,conclusions are the best material for poetry.
331,INTRODUCTION,
332,INTRODUCTION,"I recognize, then, as great poetry, all writings in which metaphysical"
333,INTRODUCTION,or scientific truth and the spirit of social service are ecstatically
334,INTRODUCTION,"formulated in prose, though I make no terms with dry didactic works that"
335,INTRODUCTION,pretend to be poetry. I see the workings of the intellect in a product
336,INTRODUCTION,of the imagination and I try to show that logic and morality have not
337,INTRODUCTION,been so hostile to the poetic faculty as they have been usually deemed.
338,INTRODUCTION,At the same time I find that all poetry is a product or expression of
339,INTRODUCTION,the unconscious.
340,INTRODUCTION,
341,INTRODUCTION,"This is, then, not a book to teach the writing of poetry, but a study of"
342,INTRODUCTION,"the poetic faculty in literature, not in rhetorical terms, but by an"
343,INTRODUCTION,appeal to the emotional life of the reader. It aims to point out the
344,INTRODUCTION,best examples of the literature of ecstasy (or poetry) whether in verse
345,INTRODUCTION,"or prose. It shows that poetry is the very life of man's soul, that he"
346,INTRODUCTION,"has always loved it, that he has in lieu of gratification of a good and"
347,INTRODUCTION,true poetic faculty often spent himself in cultivating substitutes for
348,INTRODUCTION,it. What a superficial assumption that because people do not like verse
349,INTRODUCTION,"or read verse (especially trivial, lifeless, unhuman verse) they"
350,INTRODUCTION,"therefore do not care for poetry! Furthermore, I try to relate the"
351,INTRODUCTION,"poet's own literary revelation back to himself, just as the poet sought"
352,INTRODUCTION,to reveal his soul to the reader.

369,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"""The primal and danger-breeding gift of ecstasy,"" says Huneker in his"
370,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"essay ""Anarchs and Ecstasy"" in _Bedouins_, ""is bestowed upon few. Keats"
371,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"had it, and Shelley; despite his passion, Byron missed it, as did the"
372,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"austere Wordsworth[18:A]--who had, perhaps, loftier compensations."
373,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Swinburne had it from the first. Not Tennyson and Browning, only in"
374,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"occasional exaltation. Like the cold devils of Felicien Rops, coiled in"
375,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"frozen ecstasy, the winds of hell booming about them, the poetry of"
376,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Charles Baudelaire is ecstatic. Poe and Heine knew ecstasy. . . .
377,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"William Blake and his figures, rushing down the secret pathway of the"
378,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"mystic, which zigzags from the Fourth Dimension to the bottomless pit of"
379,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"materialism, was a creator of the darker nuances of pain and ecstasy."""
380,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
381,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Ecstasy is derived from the Greek word which means _to make stand out_;
382,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the mind makes sensible things stand out because it is concentrated on
383,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"particular emotions, and on the ideas associated with and springing from"
384,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,these emotions. We must not make the mistake of thinking that ecstasy
385,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"has nothing to do with thought. On the contrary, it is too much occupied"
386,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,with thought. It in fact represents a form of monomania connected with a
387,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,certain idea. It is a rapturous state in which the person is governed by
388,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,preoccupation with a definite viewpoint. The poetic condition of
389,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy to which I refer is that mentioned by the poet Gray, in his"
390,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"famous _Elegy_, when he speaks of one of the dead who might have ""waked"
391,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"to ecstasy the living lyre."" He again uses the word in his _Progress of"
392,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Poesie_, when he speaks of Milton, who rode ""upon the seraph wings of"
393,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy."" Undoubtedly Gray understood by ecstasy the poetic emotion"
394,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"primarily. In fact, any emotion that grips a man strongly may be called"
395,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy. Great grief or joy, pleasure or pain, passion or tragedy,"
396,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"enthusiasm for an idea or a cause, are all ecstatic conditions. The"
397,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"passion for social justice, an intense love for humanity, devotion to"
398,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"art, beauty, knowledge, the emotions of a happy or an unhappy lover, all"
399,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,constitute important subjects in the literature of ecstasy.
400,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
401,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,But the ecstasy must be a universal and secular ecstasy. There are two
402,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,kinds of ecstasies which though universal may manifest themselves in
403,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,such primitive forms as to appear only to limited circles. I refer to
404,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the ecstasy of chauvinism, or fanatical, local, unjust patriotism, and"
405,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,to the ecstasy of the pathologically religious victim whose views border
406,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"on hallucination. For example, if a man goes into extreme rhapsodies"
407,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"about his particular race or country, and vituperates the people of"
408,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"other races or countries, and justifies tyrannical measures towards"
409,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"them; if, furthermore, he writes under the assumption that all the"
410,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"intellectual and moral virtues reside in his people,--in short, if he is"
411,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,purely clannish one can scarcely expect his literary product to appeal
412,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"to other people than his own. Again, if we hear or read the outburst of"
413,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"a devotee of a particular religious sect, and we find that we can agree"
414,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"with him in none of the views or dogmas he entertains; if, moreover, we"
415,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,observe there is something also anti-human in the attitude that he takes
416,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"towards life, we are revolted by his passionate outpourings."
417,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
418,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Though every nation and every religion is and should be to some extent
419,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"clannish and sectarian, still no literature that is purely so can have a"
420,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"universal appeal. Hence, morbidly mystical poems, celebrating union with"
421,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"an anthropomorphic God, poems chanting the praises of conquest and"
422,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"imperialism, poems seething with hatred for people of other races or"
423,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"religions, poems poisoned by hatred for humanity, are all examples of"
424,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the literature of ecstasy of a low order.
425,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
426,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"On the contrary, however, the literature of ecstasy may be both"
427,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"religious and patriotic, and still appeal to the world at large. I"
428,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,suppose the best illustration of such kind of literature is the psalms
429,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"in the Old Testament. They strike a universal note and move Christians,"
430,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Mohammedans, Jews, free thinkers alike. The ecstasy here does not depend"
431,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"upon the author's attachment to a dogma, but springs most frequently"
432,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,from a love of righteousness and humanity; hence the emotional appeal of
433,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the poet touches even those who are not deists. There are also fine
434,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,touches and poignant prayers here and there that move even the
435,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"non-Christian in some of the works of St. Augustine, Thomas à Kempis,"
436,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Pascal and Bunyan.
437,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
438,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,We are not concerned here with the idea of ecstasy as a state that is
439,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"supposed to give us glimpses of the deity, nor with any attempt to"
440,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,purify us by divesting our soul from the imperfect body and liberating
441,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"it from the frailties of the flesh. On the contrary, ecstasy is nothing"
442,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,more than accumulated ordinary emotions and it speaks not only with the
443,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"body, but with all the memories of the body. It makes use in its"
444,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,communications to us of those very physical infirmities that mystics
445,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"assume it shuns, those residing in the body as a medium. Ecstasy employs"
446,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the mind, and thus depends on the brain, the nerves, the physical"
447,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"senses, which are unconsciously active even in a trance, and speak out"
448,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of the past. Ecstasy is the voice of the body.[21:A]
449,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
450,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Generally speaking the ecstasy we mean in speaking of poetry is not the
451,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"same as that known to mysticism. However, the ecstasy in both springs"
452,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,from the unconscious and is the fruit of an emotional soul because of
453,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"inherited memories of past emotions. In the ecstasy of the mystic, which"
454,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"is usually what is called ""religious experience,"" there is really little"
455,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,application of the reason. It is even often pathological and is both the
456,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,product and the cause of a belief in absurd dogmas. It is often merely a
457,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"sublimated passion for morality, or the result, as Freudians have shown,"
458,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of a hysterical attachment to parents, or the idealization of a father."
459,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,It is often a sublimated sex love due to repression. Every one has been
460,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,struck with the sensuous images in the conceptions of the mystics.
461,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Broadly speaking, mysticism seeks a condition of being united to a"
462,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,personal God who is supposed to exist outside of nature; it craves to
463,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"partake of His holiness, and to cultivate purity and be rid of the"
464,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,earthy. He who rejects belief in an anthropomorphic God or to the
465,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,mystics' particular religions can have little of the mystics' feelings.
466,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"He does not enter into sympathy with their ideas, and this militates"
467,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"against the university of mystic poetry. The ecstasy does not ""catch."""
468,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Most of the mystic poetry of the world, especially that centering around"
469,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"asceticism and dogma, has importance only for the believer in the"
470,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"mystic's philosophy. Very little of it has literary value, although it"
471,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,often is presented in an emotional and effective manner.
472,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
473,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,But there is a form of ecstasy in a species of mysticism that is
474,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"universal and modern, and will appeal to all in spite of their religious"
475,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,beliefs. When the poet recognizing God in nature seeks to identify
476,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"himself with nature by love and admiration for her, by a passion for a"
477,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"life that is in accordance with her commands, his poetry embodying such"
478,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy is universal and is lifted into a high plane. It becomes a sort
479,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of ecstatic statement of pantheistic philosophy that even the believer
480,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"may accept. That is why the Persian poet, Jalalu 'l-Din Rumi, for"
481,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"example, appeals to us and why his works are of such high order."
482,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
483,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Sufism or Persian mysticism began in asceticism and ended in pantheism.
484,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"It became a desire of a union with nature. In fact, it was an ecstatic"
485,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"state of love for man, nature, God. It had its roots however in physical"
486,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"love, and a story is told of a man who, wanting to become a Sufi, was"
487,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,told first to love some woman. Some critics even declare that many of
488,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the Persian love poems are really mystical poems, and though this is"
489,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"only partly true, it is certain that the Persian mystical poems are"
490,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,really love poems.
491,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
492,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The mystic poems of the later Mohammedan Sufis are in fact
493,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"anti-Mohammedan, and yet by a curious paradox they become after much"
494,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,controversy acceptable to the Church.
495,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
496,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,There is also much that is modern in the Pre-buddhistic _Vedas_ and
497,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"_Upanishads_, and in some Buddhistic works, because of the pantheistic"
498,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,character of the ideas and the universality of the emotions.
499,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
500,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The ecstasy of the pantheistic mystic is a secular feeling that we all
501,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"experience, and is the substance of literature in prose and verse. We"
502,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,have much modern mystical poetry that has a universal appeal; it is also
503,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,pantheistic in character and shows the poet's desire for union not with
504,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"an anthropomorphic God, but with nature whom he recognizes as his God."
505,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The best illustration of it is the famous passage in Wordsworth's lines
506,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"composed above Tintern Abbey, in which he tells us he hears in nature"
507,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"""the still, sad music of humanity."" The entire passage is great poetry,"
508,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,not because of the blank verse but because of the mystical pantheistic
509,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy.
510,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
511,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Sane mystical poetry may then be of a very high order. You will find
512,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"examples of it in Blake, Emerson, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold."
513,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Shelley's _Hymn to Intellectual Beauty_, Browning's _Rabbi Ben Ezra_,"
514,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Whitman's _Chanting the Square Deific_ and Swinburne's _Hertha_ are
515,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,great mystical poems. These and others will be found in the _Oxford Book
516,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of Mystical Verse_, collected by D. H. S. Nicholson and A. H. E. Lee."
517,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
518,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Some years ago Arthur Machen produced a curious and illogical book,"
519,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"_Hieroglyphics_, where he touched the borders of the truth of the"
520,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"distinction between the literature of ecstasy and general literature,"
521,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,but he introduced too many unbalanced views about literature being
522,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,unrelated to life. He was also thinking too exclusively of that
523,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,religious ecstasy that is found in the Catholic Church only. He also
524,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"took as his model for an example of ecstasy, _Pickwick Papers_, where"
525,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"there is really little ecstasy, but he found none in _Vanity Fair_ where"
526,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"there is much. He also, strange to relate, found no ecstasy in Meredith"
527,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"or the later Hardy novels, and in no intellectual productions marked"
528,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,with liberal thought except those of Rabelais. He showed no insight into
529,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the real greatness of literature, because of his narrow conception of"
530,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy.
531,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
532,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Ecstasy in the broad sense is any excited condition of the emotions.
533,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Besides the meaning the word has in a narrow mystic and a medical sense,"
534,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"with neither of which significances are we here concerned, it is"
535,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,understood generally as referring to any condition where man is
536,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,overpowered by his feelings. It is this condition which makes the poet
537,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"write, and the reader is brought into a similar state with the poet by"
538,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,reading the poems. Hence when the prose writer describes his ecstatic
539,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"state, or draws people into such a state, he is also a poet. The"
540,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"critical or philosophical essay, the novel and short story when"
541,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstatical, are therefore poetry."
542,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
543,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,It is not necessary that a literary production should be a protracted
544,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,piece of ecstatical writing.
545,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
546,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Many people are under the impression that when we speak of ecstasy we
547,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"mean a state where reason is utterly dethroned. Yet the Greeks, who make"
548,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"inspiration the source of art, never let the passions so rule that utter"
549,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,chaos resulted in the poet's creation. In Greek literature we have a
550,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,blending of reason and ecstasy. Professor Butcher has pointed out in his
551,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"excellent essay on ""Art and Inspiration,"" in his _Harvard Lectures on"
552,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Greek Subjects_, the potency of reason in Greek poetry. The ideas of the"
553,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Greek writers were emotionalized, and there were ideas in their"
554,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"emotional products. Demosthenes was like Plato, a passionate thinker;"
555,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Pindar, Æschylus and Sophocles were reasoning poets."
556,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
557,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The Greeks used the word ecstasy in a modern secular sense rather than
558,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,in a spiritual or pathological one. It was the unconscious memory of the
559,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poet coming to the fore and utilizing the intellect to pour light on the
560,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,soul. It was not the mystic's ecstasy where irrational conclusions were
561,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,arrived at because of some abnormality in the seer. The poet was always
562,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"a critic and a philosopher who tamed his wildest thoughts. ""Moderns are"
563,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"prone,"" says Butcher, ""to believe that the action of poetic genius"
564,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,abdicates its rights and descends to the lower level of talent when it
565,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,begins to reason. Greek literature decisively refutes such a notion. It
566,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,exhibits the critical faculty as a great underlying element in the
567,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"creative faculty."""
568,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
569,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Greek poetry then is the portrayal of reasoning passion, using at the"
570,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,same time a conscious technique. It was the outpouring of the
571,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,personality of the poet made up of his intellect and passions. It
572,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"represented the breaking forth of the unconscious into expression,"
573,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,controlled by a censorship on the part of the poet.
574,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
575,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Plato's idea about poetry being a form of madness may, however, still be"
576,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"accepted, when we understand by madness the being imbued with one's"
577,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,emotions in a manner not depriving the poet of his intellectual powers.
578,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Poetry is only the result of inspiration, if by this term we mean that"
579,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,rationalized emotions have so accumulated as suddenly to seek
580,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"expression. Every poet, in prose or verse, writes from the unconscious"
581,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and he usually gets lost in his own characters or speaks directly in his
582,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"own person. The writer, however, is not mad, nor is his art allied to"
583,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"madness. He is usually too sane, using his judgment at the same time"
584,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,that his emotions are aroused. So we can still subscribe to Plato's idea
585,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of unconscious art, put in the mouth of Socrates in the dialogue _Ion_:"
586,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
587,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"All good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful"
588,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poems not by art, but because they are inspired and possessed;"
589,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"like the Corybantian revellers in their dances, who are not in"
590,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,their right mind when they are composing their beautiful
591,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"strains, yet who, when falling under the power of music and"
592,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,metre are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens who
593,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under the
594,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"influence of Dionysus, but not when they are in possession of"
595,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"their mind. And the soul of the lyric poets does the same, as"
596,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,they themselves say; for they tell us that they bring songs
597,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"from the honeyed fountains, culling them out of the gardens"
598,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"and dells of the Muses; they are like bees, winging their way"
599,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,from flower to flower. And this is true. For the poet is a
600,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"light winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him"
601,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"until he has been inspired and is out of his senses, and the"
602,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,mind is no longer in him: when he has not attained to this
603,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"state, he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles."
604,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
605,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,*       *       *       *       *
606,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
607,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The expressions referring to being out of the mind and senses
608,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,must not be taken literally.
609,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
610,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,As long as we bear in mind that Plato's idea of madness is merely the
611,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"concentration on one topic, his idea of poetry is true."
612,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
613,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,A remark of Socrates in the _Phaedrus_ should be well pondered by
614,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"disciples of art for art's sake. ""He who having no touch of the Muses'"
615,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,madness in his soul comes to the door and thinks that he will get into
616,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the temple by the help of art--he, I say, and his poetry are not"
617,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"admitted."""
618,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
619,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Plato himself was one of the finest of ancient poets, in spite of the"
620,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,fact that he wanted to exclude poets from his ideal commonwealth. Some
621,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of the finest prose poems and allegories of ancient literature are found
622,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"in his _Republic_, the _Phaedrus_ and _Symposium_. Most of these are"
623,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"known to us, and need no mention. When Plato speaks of love, he does so"
624,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"as a poet, and the passages on the subject in the last two named"
625,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,dialogues are full of poetry.
626,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
627,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"I wish to give, besides the above passage, as an illustration of Plato's"
628,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"own prose poetry, part of a speech by Alcibiades. It is at the"
629,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"conclusion of the _Symposium_, and is part of Alcibiades's tribute to"
630,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Socrates and his speeches. Socrates, himself, thinks the speech is"
631,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"delivered to create trouble between him and Agathon, of whom Alcibiades"
632,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,is jealous. The speech is ruined also by a reference at length to a
633,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,phase of Greek life which is repulsive to us. After likening Socrates to
634,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Silenus and to Marsyas, Alcibiades continues in the following prose"
635,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poem:
636,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
637,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,For my heart leaps within me fore than that of any Corybantian
638,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"reveller, and my eyes rain tears when I hear them. And I"
639,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,observe that many others are affected in the same manner. I
640,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"have heard Pericles and other great orators, and I thought"
641,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"that they spoke well, but I never had any similar feeling; my"
642,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"soul was not stirred by them, nor was I angry at the thought"
643,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of my own slavish state. But this Marsyas has often brought me
644,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,to such a pass that I have felt as if I could hardly endure
645,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the life which I am leading (this, Socrates, you will admit);"
646,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and I am conscious that if I did not shut my ears against him
647,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and fly as from the voice of the siren my fate would be like
648,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"that of others--he would transfix me, and I should grow old"
649,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,sitting at his feet. For he makes me confess that I ought not
650,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"to live as I do, neglecting the wants of my own soul, and"
651,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,busying myself with the concerns of the Athenians; therefore I
652,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,hold my ears and tear myself away from him. And he is the only
653,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"person who ever made me ashamed, which you might think not to"
654,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"be in my nature, and there is no one else who does the same."
655,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,For I know that I cannot answer him or say that I ought not to
656,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"do as he bids, but when I leave his presence the love of"
657,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,popularity gets the better of me. And therefore I run away and
658,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"fly from him, and when I see him I am ashamed of what I have"
659,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"confessed to him. Many a time have I wished that he were dead,"
660,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"and yet I know that I should be more sorry than glad, if he"
661,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,were to die; so that I am at my wit's end.
662,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
663,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Symonds tells us that Æschylus was the great example of unconscious art
664,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"among Greek playwrights, and that he exemplifies Plato's theory of"
665,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetry.
666,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
667,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Æschylus's creation Cassandra is a good illustration of a character in
668,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"an ecstatic state. Cassandra is both prophetess and poetess, and her"
669,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"cries move us to this day, when much of Æschylus's moral and religious"
670,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,philosophy bores and irritates us. She is the incarnation of woman
671,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,suffering. She was ravished at Troy by Ajax and was given to Agamemnon
672,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"as prisoner of war, she the princess, daughter of Priam and Hecuba. She"
673,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,had lost most of the members of her family and now anticipated great
674,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,trouble for Agamemnon whose wife Claetemnestrae was unfaithful to him.
675,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"She also foresaw her own death at the queen's hands, but it was her"
676,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"punishment that her prophecies would not be heeded. She is partly mad,"
677,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"but hers is the poetic frenzy, tempered by logic. Her most meaningless"
678,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ravings are full of meaning. They are poetry not because of the metre in
679,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"which they are rendered, but because of the rational ecstasy. This"
680,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy remains intact even in the English prose translation.
681,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
682,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Nietzsche divided art into Apollonian and Dionysian. He found that the
683,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Dionysian state depended on emotional or orgiastic intoxication. He
684,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,perceived that the ecstasy in this state was largely of a sexual
685,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"character. As he boldly put it, ""The desire for art and beauty is an"
686,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"indirect longing for the ecstasy of sexual desire, which gets"
687,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"communicated to the brain."" This is the thesis that Freud developed."
688,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Croce, who has, however, something of the metaphysician and mystic in"
689,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"him, is not in sympathy with this view, for he ridicules the idea that"
690,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the genesis of aesthetism lies in the desire of the male for the female.
691,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Yet he agrees with Freud in the conception that art is a means of curing
692,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"oneself of sexual neurosis. ""By elaborating his impressions,"" says"
693,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Croce, ""man frees himself from them. By objectifying them, he removes"
694,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,them from him and makes himself their superior. The liberating and
695,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,purifying function of art is another aspect and another formula of its
696,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"character and activity. Activity is the deliverer, just because it"
697,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"drives away passivity."""
698,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
699,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Finely put, indeed, are the words of Nietzsche's views on ecstasy. ""To"
700,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the existence of art, to the existence of any aesthetic activity or"
701,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"perception whatsoever, a preliminary psychological condition is"
702,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"indispensable, namely ecstasy. Ecstasy must first have intensified the"
703,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,sensitiveness of the whole mechanism; until this takes place art is not
704,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,realized.
705,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
706,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"""All kinds of ecstasy, however differently conditioned, possess this"
707,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"power; above all the ecstasy of sexual excitement, the oldest and most"
708,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"primitive form of ecstasy."""
709,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
710,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Plato, it will be recalled, compared the state of the poet to that of"
711,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the reveller in the Bacchanalian rites. The favorable side of the
712,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,worship of Dionysius or the Bacchic revels has been shown by Euripides
713,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,in his play the _Bacchae_. He shows how King Pentheus was torn to pieces
714,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,in mistake by his own mother for his hostility to the bacchic rites.
715,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Bacchus himself is the hero of the play. As the chorus says, Bacchus is"
716,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,innately modest and modest women will not be corrupted at the revels.
717,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Who is not moved by the song of the Chorus? ""Would that I could go to"
718,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Cyprus, the island of Venus, where the lovers dwell, soothing the minds"
719,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of mortals, and to Paphos, which the waters of a foreign river flowing"
720,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,with an hundred mouths fertilize without rain--and to the land of
721,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Pieria, where is the beautiful seat of the Muses, the holy hill of"
722,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Olympus. Lead me thither, O Bromius, Bromius, O master thou of"
723,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Bacchanals. There are the Graces and there is Love and there is it
724,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"lawful for the Bacchae to celebrate their orgies."""
725,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
726,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"The ecstasy of the revellers at the rites was poetic ecstasy, for it was"
727,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,an unconscious or conscious erotic nature manifesting itself in the form
728,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of a religious rite. Bacchus, aside from being god of wine, was the"
729,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"symbol of productiveness and was accompanied by Priapus, and the phallus"
730,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,was carried about. He was youthful and his symbols were animals like the
731,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"goat, ass, bull, tiger, lion, all of which had erotic significance. The"
732,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstatic rites with which he was worshipped were introduced from Thrace.
733,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
734,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Aristotle attributes the origin of tragedy to the use of the dithyramb
735,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of the revellers, and comedy to the phallic songs sung by them. The"
736,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"point is that love frenzy leads to poetry, and we have an illustration"
737,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of it in the connection between the Bacchic rites and poetry, between"
738,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,love and art. The rites degenerated under the Romans and were soon
739,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,suppressed by law.
740,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
741,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Nietzsche gives us a profound interpretation of Euripides's play in the
742,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,twelfth section of _The Birth of Tragedy_. It is the old story of the
743,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"battle between the emotions and reason, the instinct and the intellect,"
744,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"problems which men as different as Hearn, Bergson, Nietzsche, Pater and"
745,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Freud solved by seeking liberties for the instinct. Pentheus, who"
746,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"represents reason, is the enemy of Bacchus, but fascinated by him, loses"
747,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,his life; reason leads to death when it makes no concession to the
748,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,instincts. The play was a protest by Euripides against his own
749,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"moralizing tendencies. The lesson of the sages Cadmus and Tiresius is,"
750,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"in the words of Nietzsche, that we must display a diplomatically"
751,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,cautious concern in the presence of the emotional forces. Don't trifle
752,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,with poetry and the ecstasies that produce it.
753,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
754,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"The older interpretation, which even Pater adopted in his _Greek"
755,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Studies_, that Euripides wrote the play as a repentance for his liberal"
756,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,views and to signify his return to the conservatism of the Greek
757,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"religion, is no longer held. Gilbert Murray and others have also shown"
758,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the fallacy of this view, but Nietzsche anticipated them."
759,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
760,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The most primitive and universal ecstasy is that which is concerned with
761,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the attraction of the sexes. Poetry after all deals chiefly with love,"
762,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,for in the relations of the sexes we have the source of most of the
763,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,pleasurable and painful emotions of humanity. Sexual love even when most
764,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,hidden is at the root of all love between the sexes. It is for this
765,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,reason that we can still appreciate the oldest lyric poetry of different
766,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,nations.
767,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
768,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"True, two of our greatest of modern poets, Wordsworth and Whitman,"
769,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"dealt hardly at all with romantic love, and other poets like Shelley and"
770,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Swinburne have written besides love poetry, passionate defences of"
771,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,liberty and republicanism. But still it is the relations of the sexes
772,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"which most interests people in a play, a novel or a poem."
773,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
774,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,And the love poetry of the world is naturally to be found in prose as
775,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,well as in verse. Many of our modern poets in their love poetry have not
776,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,given us any better poetry than some of Heloise's love letters in prose.
777,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
778,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Love is the foundation of poetry and for this reason poetry always will
779,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"be with us, and probably more so in prose than in verse. We want"
780,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"literature that deals with it, and we like love poetry whether in the"
781,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"prose letters of Keats, the Carlyles, the Brownings and Madame"
782,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Lespinasse, or in the novels of Hardy, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Balzac, or in"
783,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the verse of Hafiz, Burns, Shelley, Browning, Heine or Verlaine."
784,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
785,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Professor Woodberry has made a special plea in his _Inspiration of
786,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Poetry_ for a return of poetry to poetic madness. Emotion is the chief
787,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"and most important element of poetry. ""Emotion"" as Woodberry says, ""is"
788,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the condition of their (the poets') existence; passion is the element of
789,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"their being."" When we think of the great figures in fiction who are to"
790,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"us the most poetic, we think of Oedipus, Orestes, Hamlet, Lear, Macbeth,"
791,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Goriot, Grandet, Arthur Dimmesdale, Jean Valjean, Anna Karenina, Oswald"
792,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Alving. Passion is the element that makes a character poetic. But any
793,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"emotion in which the poet steeps his poems, interests us. We read Heine,"
794,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Byron, Burns, Verlaine, because we wish to find our own emotions"
795,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"expressed. But not every petty feeling, like the shades and nuances we"
796,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"find in much verse, is great poetry, nor is the record of every trivial"
797,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,event important poetry.
798,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
799,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,But emotions described by the poet affect people differently. I may
800,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,find great emotion in reading about a man who sacrifices himself for a
801,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"great and unpopular idea, but others may not be interested in that man"
802,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,or his idea and hence will not be moved by the work. Such a work is
803,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poetry to me and like minded readers. Further, differences of"
804,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,intellectual outlook on the part of the readers count in determining
805,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poetry. Socrates, Buddha, Bruno and Galileo are poetic figures to us"
806,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,to-day; they have been enshrined in poetry and history and we accept
807,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,many of their ideas. But to their contemporaries who rejected them they
808,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,were not poetic figures. Who knows but that there are figures to-day we
809,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,scoff at who may have a halo of poetry in history?
810,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
811,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,A distinct but by no means essential quality of the literature of
812,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy is that of pain. There is more pain depicted in the world's
813,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"literature than pleasure. In his _The Nature of Poetry_, Edmund Clarence"
814,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Stedman speaks of a certain sadness or melancholy in the poetry of the
815,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,nineteenth century but he might have said this was true of the poetry of
816,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"any century. Most poetry is sad, for life often is, and the poet is"
817,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,naturally interested in and pays most attention to the painful emotions
818,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,that trouble him. Tragedy and elegy (and the term elegy was used by the
819,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Romans not only to bemoan the dead, but to deplore sad love affairs) are"
820,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"predominant in all literature, prose and verse."
821,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
822,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,We always find a poet's outburst of sorrow interesting. The poems of the
823,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Hebrews, Persians, Arabians, Chinese and Japanese may be read by us"
824,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,because they voice the sorrows that are universal to man. Grief is the
825,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,substance of poetry and in the public mind there has always been an
826,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"association between poetry and sadness; as Shelley said--""our sweetest"
827,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"songs are those that told the saddest thought."""
828,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
829,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"It is assumed that Christianity made poetry sad but this is not so, for"
830,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,there is sad poetry in the Old Testament and among the Romans and the
831,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Orientals who never embraced Christianity. Poetry is sad because it is
832,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,intertwined with human nerves. The most frequent note in poetry is
833,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"wailing and lamentation, self-pity and passionate rebuke."
834,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
835,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"In Professor William A. Neilson's _Essentials of Poetry_, there is an"
836,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"interesting chapter on sentimentalism in poetry, in which the author"
837,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,dwells on the sentimentalism in the poetry of the English Romantic
838,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,School. He defines it as the cultivation of an emotion for the sake of
839,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the thrill. Most certainly there can be no great poetry where the
840,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"sentimentalism is forced, where it becomes ridiculous, where it bubbles"
841,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,over and becomes monotonous. Sentimentalism often characterizes popular
842,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetry and if the public is likely to err in judging poetry it is
843,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,particularly likely to confuse sentimentalism with normal human
844,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,emotions. Yet it is hard often to draw the line between sham emotions
845,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and genuine sentiment.
846,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
847,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The poet is bound to be always sentimental to an extent because he must
848,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,wear his heart on his sleeve. No one need be ashamed of unadulterated
849,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"emotions, for life is made up of them."
850,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
851,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Besides, nationalities differ. The Irish, the Jews and the Russians, for"
852,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"example, do not consider their own poems sentimental because these are"
853,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,genuine records of actual feelings characteristic of sentimental
854,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"peoples; to be sure, such expressed emotions may appear as sentimental"
855,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"to the rest of the world. Many think that the emotion of pity, and also"
856,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,sympathy for the criminal that we find in Russian novels is rather
857,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"sentimental and nauseating, but it is genuine Russian emotion."
858,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
859,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"We should be on our guard, however, in regarding sentimentalism as"
860,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetry. The public loves cheap popular songs and mushy lachrymose
861,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"verses. The many poems, stories and plays about ""mother,"" ""baby,"" ""the"
862,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"flag,"" ""home,"" ""our country,"" etc., are often drivelling sentimentalism"
863,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and not poetry.
864,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
865,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Ecstasy was the keynote of Oriental poetry. We are fortunate in having a
866,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,translation in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_ for 1901 and
867,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"1902 by Duncan B. Macdonald, of a book on the laws of music and singing"
868,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of ecstasy from Al Ghazzali's work on the _Re-vivifying of the Sciences
869,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,of the Faith_. Ghazzali (1060-1111) was the greatest apologist for Islam
870,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"and is known as ""The Proof of Islam."" He was held to be the only man who"
871,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"was worthy of being a prophet, next to Mohammed himself. He"
872,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,unfortunately dealt the death blow to Mohammedan philosophy and Averroes
873,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,wrote against him. But no one among Arabs had as grand a conception of
874,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy in connection with poetry as he did. He was influenced by the
875,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Persian Sufis and defined ecstasy in a very modern manner. We may
876,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,dispense with his mystic conception of it and pay attention only to his
877,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,definition of it in its relation to poetry. Great admirer as he was of
878,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the _Koran_ he recognized that poetry is more in accord with human
879,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"nature than that work, and he quotes an authority to the effect that our"
880,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,being constituted of fanciful desires makes us more moved by poets than
881,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,by the word of God. He finds various reasons for the power of poetry
882,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"over us, the principal one being its quality of ecstasy. He sees that"
883,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetry has a mission in conveying ecstasy; that one of its uses is to
884,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"arouse us to lamentation, to joy, to love, to courage and to religion."
885,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"He analyzes the tender longing caused by love poetry, though, good"
886,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Moslem that he was, he is always discriminating between poetry that"
887,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"arouses a lawful love, and that which has mere lust as its object."
888,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
889,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"His main contribution, however, to the philosophy of ecstasy is his"
890,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,recognition of its identity with the unconscious. He quotes some one to
891,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the effect that music and singing do not produce in the heart what is
892,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,not in it but stir up what exists there. Ecstasy to him is the result of
893,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,hearing and of understanding what is heard and applying it to an idea
894,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,which occurs to the hearer. It is a condition produced in the hearer's
895,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"soul due to knowledge or emotion, and the condition is varied. The"
896,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"following passage is especially worthy of quotation: ""As for the states,"
897,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"how many a man gets so far as to perceive in his heart, on some occasion"
898,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"which may appear in it, a contraction or an expansion, yet he does not"
899,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"know its cause! And a man sometimes thinks about a thing, and it makes"
900,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"an impression on his soul. Then he forgets the cause, but the impression"
901,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"remains upon his soul, and he feels it. And, sometimes, the condition"
902,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,which he feels is a joy which arose in his soul on his thinking about a
903,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,cause which produces joy; or it may have been a sorrow; then he who was
904,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"thinking about it forgets it, but feels in the impression its"
905,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,consequence. And sometimes that condition is a strong condition which a
906,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,word expressing joy or sorrow does not indicate clearly and for which he
907,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"cannot come upon a suitable expression for what was intended."""
908,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
909,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Al Ghazzali gives then, as the essence of ecstasy, its unconscious"
910,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,nature. Ecstasy is related to longing for something unknown. All people
911,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,experience in their hearts states demanding things unknown to them. He
912,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,compares the situation to that of the innocent and ignorant youth in
913,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,puberty who is in a state unexplained to him. Al Ghazzali is one of the
914,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,first of modern critics to formulate the theory of ecstasy as the end of
915,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poetry, and his argument explains the vogue of love and mystic poetry."
916,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"He recurs, it is true, to the influence of metre in poetry in inducing"
917,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy, but he is always thinking of the ecstasy of love of man and"
918,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"God as the element of poetry, and in this he is a predecessor of"
919,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Tolstoy. He also gives rules as to one's behavior in the ecstatic state
920,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and does not sanction undue madness.
921,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
922,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,A much higher form of the literature of ecstasy than the product of the
923,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,immoral rites of Dionysus or the mystic poetry of Persia is the prophecy
924,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"as it was known and delivered among the ancient Hebrews. Indeed,"
925,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,prophecy is the ideal form of the literature of ecstasy and represents
926,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the zenith of its achievement. It is the emotional verbal utterance of
927,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the unconscious of the poet, who is usually in a state of ecstasy, and"
928,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"who, as passages in the Bible testify, receives his message in a vision"
929,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,or dream. The act of prophesying was even contagious. The early prophets
930,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,were like dancing dervishes in their prophesying and influenced others
931,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,to do as they did. We recall how Saul stripped himself naked. The Hebrew
932,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,word prophecy means utterance and the idea of foretelling the future was
933,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"incidental to it. If the idea of futurity emanated from prophets, it was"
934,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,such insight as any gifted person may experience when he notes certain
935,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,facts from which he can predict inevitable results. But the ecstatic
936,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"state was always associated with the idea of prophecy, the only person,"
937,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"according to the account of the Bible, exempt from this state being"
938,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Moses. The prophetic state was not allied to divination but resulted
939,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,from moral and aesthetic inspiration such as we find in modern poets.
940,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"When the Bible says, God spoke to the prophet, or the hand of God"
941,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"touched him, it means that the prophet was in a state of ecstasy due to"
942,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,a highly developed moral and social viewpoint. The true prophet's
943,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,ecstasy was not accompanied by immorality or superduced by drugs or
944,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"physical abuse. Music, however, was at one time used to produce the"
945,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,prophetic state. The aesthetic mechanism of the ancient prophets was no
946,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,different from that of any great poet with a message of modern times.
947,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Moses Maimonides in his _Guide to the Perplexed_ analyzes the ecstatic
948,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,state of prophecy and his analysis may be applied to any high form of
949,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetic inspiration.
950,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
951,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Prophecy was, according to Maimonides, an emanation sent forth to man's"
952,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,rational faculty and then to his imaginative faculty; it consisted in
953,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the most perfect development of the imaginative faculty; the logical and
954,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,imaginative faculties had to be balanced in the prophet; he overflowed
955,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,with the frenzy of ecstasy to help his fellow-men and could not rest
956,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,even at risk of personal suffering; he had courage and intuition; he
957,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,reserved his message in a dream or a vision.
958,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
959,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The psychology of the prophetic inspiration has been studied by many of
960,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the higher critics of the Bible. One of the best books on the subject is
961,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"_The Psychology of Prophecy_ by Dr. Jacob H. Kaplan, Philadelphia 1908,"
962,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,(Julius H. Greenstone) who says:
963,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
964,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The ecstasy of the wild and mad kind was seen only in the
965,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"early days of Hebrew prophecy, when wine and dance and music"
966,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,and other external means were used for bringing about this
967,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"state, but the subdued elevated ecstasy due to religious"
968,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"temperament and patriotic fervor, due to constant and profound"
969,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"contemplation, was certainly the characteristic of the later"
970,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,prophets. . . . Ecstasy is usually the spring whence all the
971,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,other prophetic streams flow.
972,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
973,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"While the Greeks mingled reason with inspiration to produce poetry, the"
974,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"prophets went further, and interpenetrated their ecstasy with a high"
975,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"sense of social justice. An ecstatic state, with a keen intellect, a"
976,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"high moral outlook, and a noble social ideal characterized the prophet."
977,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,His state of ecstasy was due to this highly developed social
978,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,conscience. He was not so much concerned with religious rites as with
979,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,the decline of the nation's ideals of justice. The prophet of that day
980,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,fulminated against the economic evils of society. He was possessed of an
981,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"exalted type of aesthetic soul, the ecstasy to social justice. No"
982,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,literature gives us such types of men who rebuke unjust kings as we find
983,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"in the stories of Nathan and David, Elijah and Ahab, Jeremiah and"
984,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Hezekiah. No literature shows us such courageous types as Amos and
985,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Isaiah. They were not flatterers, these men who risked their lives in"
986,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,shouting back to eastern autocratic monarchs their iniquities. They did
987,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,not say what society or public opinion wanted them to say but what they
988,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,felt was their duty. They overflowed not with the immoral and insane
989,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy of the rites of Dionysius, but the ecstasy of the man who loves"
990,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"his neighbor as himself, of the man who would not have the rich crush"
991,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the poor, of the man who sought kindness for the stranger, the"
992,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"oppressed, the widow, the fatherless."
993,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
994,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"And the prophets, in spite of their virulency, produced the highest"
995,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,forms of artistic beauty. Not all the revolutions of opinions and
996,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"changes in religious beliefs have made them obsolete. Shaw once said,"
997,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"substitute the word ideals for the word idols, in the Bible, and you"
998,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,have messages that are still true.
999,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1000,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"So the prophets instead of being miracle performers, foretellers of the"
1001,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"future, preachers of theology, are really poets of ecstasy, with a"
1002,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"social message revealed in a dream. The old word of God, in the form of"
1003,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"a high social ideal, to-day is still making prophets. Shelley, Ibsen and"
1004,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Ruskin have done work that is akin to the prophets of old; they have
1005,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,given us works of art inspired by a state of ecstasy springing from the
1006,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"possession of social ideals. Santayana rightly regards the prophet, one"
1007,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"who portrays the ideals of experience and destiny, as the greatest"
1008,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poet. (See _Poetry and Religion._)
1009,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1010,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Nor did the prophets of old sing their messages in artificial form. They
1011,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"did not count their syllables and give us metre, though they indulged in"
1012,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,parallelisms. They wrote in rhythmical prose.[39:A]
1013,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1014,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The prophets had a true conception of what constituted a high form of
1015,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poetry, an ecstatic production in prose with a social ideal behind it."
1016,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Ecstasy was the first condition of their poetry but it was not
1017,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"pathological as with monks who tortured their bodies, or decadent poets"
1018,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,who resorted to drugs.
1019,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1020,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,If there is a high form of the literature of ecstasy it surely is that
1021,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,in which the ecstasy of humanitarianism is described. It is that which
1022,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"shows a man with a highly developed sense of social justice, who is"
1023,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,making sacrifices because he observes the misery of many due to the
1024,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,privileged few. _Don Quixote_ is one of the greatest poems because the
1025,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"knight wants to help mankind, even though he is insane and never recks"
1026,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"his own bruises, but persists and is laughed at by all."
1027,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1028,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"In speaking of the literature of ecstasy, something should be said about"
1029,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,De Quincey's famous distinction of the literature of knowledge and the
1030,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,literature of power. He defined the former as that which teaches and the
1031,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,latter as that which moves. In the literature of power he included also
1032,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"that which taught by means of passions, desires and emotions and that"
1033,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,which had its field of action in relation to the great moral capacities
1034,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"of man. The literature of power, according to De Quincey, includes that"
1035,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,which appeals to the reason and understanding through the affections.
1036,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"It restores ""to man's mind the ideals of justice, of hope, of truth, of"
1037,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"mercy, of retribution."" De Quincey included under the literature of"
1038,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"power, prose as well as verse, fairy tales and romances as well as"
1039,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,tragedies and epic poems.
1040,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1041,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"The question is, what relation is there between De Quincey's idea of the"
1042,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,literature of power and that of the literature of ecstasy. Of course he
1043,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,included under the literature of power his masterly prose poems; also
1044,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"all his imaginative writings. Now, the _Confessions of an Opium Eater_,"
1045,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"for instance, belongs only in parts to the literature of ecstasy,"
1046,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,noticeably in the dream phantasies. By the literature of power De
1047,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,Quincey meant all literature except science. The only illustration of
1048,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"the literature of knowledge he gives is Newton's _Principia_, and the"
1049,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,marked characteristics he finds in this as in all literature of
1050,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,knowledge is that it may be and usually is superseded by later
1051,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,discoveries. The literature of power in his opinion is permanent; this
1052,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,statement is not true when we think of the many imaginative works of the
1053,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,past that have no longer any message or appeal to us.
1054,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1055,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,The point is that De Quincey's literature of power includes not only
1056,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"poetry in verse and prose, but the entire field of general literature"
1057,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"which hovers on poetry, or in which the poetry is diffused so that we"
1058,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,call it prose literature. The literature of ecstasy then is the more
1059,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"emotional literature of power, that section of it where the ecstasy is"
1060,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,concentrated. It would include chiefly the impassioned prose and prose
1061,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,phantasies of De Quincey's own work.
1062,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1063,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"De Quincey was no art-for-art's-sake man, and he recognized the"
1064,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,importance of the rational and the moral element in the sphere of the
1065,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,literature of power.
1066,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1067,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,There remains a distinction between power and ecstasy. De Quincey does
1068,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,not identify power with ecstasy (a term he does not even use) even
1069,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,though he demands a moving effect in the literature of power. He does
1070,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,not contend that the emotion should be concentrated and hold complete
1071,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"sway over the author. His literature of power would include, for"
1072,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"example, all good novels or histories in their entirety. To us only"
1073,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,those portions of such novels and histories where the passion is
1074,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,concentrated belong to the literature of ecstasy or poetry.
1075,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1076,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Literature of ecstasy is always poetry, literature of power is not,"
1077,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"being rather the equivalent of _belles lettres_, reaching the heights of"
1078,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,poetry only at times.
1079,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,
1080,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"The literature of ecstasy is all writing, in verse or prose, wherever an"
1081,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"emotional atmosphere hovers, where a feeling is concentrated, and hence"
1082,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,it is really poetry. Poetry is the language of ecstasy and ecstasy is
1083,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"that possessive faculty of the imagination capable ""of projecting itself"
1084,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"into the very consciousness of its object, and again of being so wholly"
1085,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,possessed by the emotion of its object that in expression it takes
1086,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"unconsciously the tone, the color and the temperature thereof."" (James"
1087,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY,"Russell Lowell: _The Function of the Poet._ ""The Imagination."" P. 70.)"

1117,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Aristotle was the first critic who placed little stress on the
1118,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","importance of metre in poetry. If the critics had followed him, instead"
1119,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of merely referring to his _Poetics_ and trying to discover the
1120,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","""borderland between prose and poetry,"" there probably would have been"
1121,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",little confusion as to what is poetry. He saw there was poetry in the
1122,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and in the dialogues of Socrates,"
1123,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",though these were not classified as poetry. Incidentally he found little
1124,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry in Empedocles, who in spite of his metre was primarily a"
1125,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",physicist. The passage from the _Poetics_ is worth quoting entire for it
1126,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",contains the nucleus of all arguments for prose poetry. I quote from S.
1127,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",H. Butcher's translation:
1128,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1129,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",For there is no common term we could apply to the mimes of
1130,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one
1131,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","hand; and, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic,"
1132,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","elegaic, or any similar metre. People, do, indeed, add the"
1133,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","word ""make"" or ""poet"" to the name of the metre, and speak of"
1134,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","elegaic poets, or epic (that is, hexameter) poets, _as if it"
1135,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","were not the imitation that makes the poet, but the verse that"
1136,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",entitles them all indiscriminately to the name_.[42:A] Even
1137,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out
1138,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author;"
1139,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the
1140,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","metre, so that it would be right to call the one poet, the"
1141,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","other physicist rather than poet. On the same principle, even"
1142,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",if a writer in his poetic imitation were to combine all
1143,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","metres, as Chaeremon did in his _Centaur_, which is a medley"
1144,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","composed of metres of all kinds, we should bring him too under"
1145,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the general term poet.
1146,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1147,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","He also says: ""The Poet or maker should be the maker of plots rather"

1150,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1151,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Aristotle's idea that metre is an unessential element in determining
1152,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry has never really taken root in literary criticism. It was voiced
1153,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","by men like Erasmus and Savonarola, and was again restated by the"
1154,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Italian critic Castelvetro, who in his commentary on Aristotle's"
1155,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Poetics_ (1570) said that verse is not the essence of poetry, that it"
1156,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","does not distinguish it but clothes it, and that therefore matter and"
1157,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","not metre is the test of poetry. He believes like Aristotle, that metre"
1158,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","aids poetry, but that the imitation or creation itself determines it."
1159,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1160,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",George Saintsbury in his scholarly and fascinating _History of Criticism
1161,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in Europe_ cannot forgive Aristotle for this ""pestilent heresy,"" as he"
1162,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",calls it. He severely berates Wordsworth and Coleridge for having
1163,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",supported it. He attacks all the critics who countenance it. He adulates
1164,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Dante's treatise _De Vulgari Eloquentia_ as an antidote to the heresy,"
1165,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",because Dante wants the rhythm (as well as the diction) of poetry to be
1166,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",different from that of prose.
1167,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1168,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",But we are learning to-day that metre is not only an unnecessary element
1169,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in poetry, but often an artificial, hampering encumbrance, frequently"
1170,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",vitiating the poetical quality of a poem.
1171,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1172,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Yet Professor Saintsbury has given us in his _History of English Prose
1173,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Rhythm_ some of the finest emotional and rhythmical passages from
1174,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",English prose writers. He chose the selections primarily for their
1175,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","rhythm and not for their emotional qualities, yet most of the passages"
1176,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",are poems. His book practically convinces one that nearly all the great
1177,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","English writers of prose wrote not only rhythmical prose, but emotional"
1178,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","or ecstatic prose, or poetry. Professor Saintsbury finds the essence of"
1179,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose rhythm, in variety and divergence, and he divides prose into three"
1180,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","kinds, according to the rhythm. These are hybrid verse-prose, pure"
1181,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","highly rhythmed prose, and prose in general. In the first class he"
1182,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","includes much of the Bible, especially where the parallelisms are"
1183,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","present, Anglo Saxon poetry, Ossian, Blake's _Prophetic Books_ and Walt"
1184,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Whitman. He no doubt would include free verse here. But this so-called
1185,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","""hybrid verse prose"" is really highly rhythmed prose generally arranged"
1186,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in verse form. There is no real distinction between the two forms.
1187,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1188,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Poetry in prose, however, does not depend on the rhythm. The only effect"
1189,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","on the reader of reading the chapter on ""Rhythm as the Essential Fact of"
1190,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Poetry"" in Professor Gummere's book _The Beginnings of Poetry_ is to"
1191,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",convince him that the learning amassed there does not prove the
1192,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","professor's thesis. For example Gummere cites Bagehot's statement, ""the"
1193,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",exact line which separates grave novels in verse like _Aylmer's Field_
1194,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",or _Enoch Arden_ from grave novels not in verse like _Silas Marner_ and
1195,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Adam Bede_, we own we cannot draw with any confidence,"" and thus"
1196,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","comments: ""Adam Bede remains prose, and Enoch Arden is commonly set down"
1197,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","as poetry and there an end."" This impatient remark does not do away with"
1198,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the fact that the story of Hetty's troubles after she had met Arthur
1199,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Dimmesdale, and the scene of the interview with her in prison by Dinah"
1200,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Morris are two examples that fulfill every definition of poetry, even to"
1201,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",irregular rhythm. Some of the free verse poets have given us
1202,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","compositions made up of the outbursts of people in distress, with their"
1203,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",story in simple language like Hetty Sorrel's tale.
1204,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1205,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",My contention then is that what decides whether a composition is poetry
1206,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",is not the rhythm but the ecstasy. The academic critics have found an
1207,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","argument for rhythm in the fact that when a man is moved, the expression"
1208,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of his emotions tends towards rhythmical language. This is certainly
1209,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","very often true, but the rhythmical character of language in these cases"
1210,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","is entirely different from that in verse, for in verse you have a"
1211,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","patterned regular rhythm obeying an artificial law of accents, a"
1212,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",continued series of rise and ebb of the voice that must not break down
1213,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",for hundreds and even thousands of monotonous lines. In the rhythm of
1214,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the natural language of emotion you have no rules or fetters on how the
1215,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",accents should be distributed. You have rhythmical and unrhythmical
1216,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","lines, regular and irregular arrangements of accents, all thrown"
1217,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","together. No pattern is present, and no uniformity or similarity of any"
1218,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",kind is kept up. This is the language of poetic prose.
1219,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1220,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","If I say that rhythm is not necessary in poetry, I merely mean that no"
1221,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","patterned or strong rhythm is necessary, for all prose is more or less"
1222,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",irregularly rhythmical. Often the prose rhythm is more marked than the
1223,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","rhythm of metre, as you may find out by comparing passages from Whitman"
1224,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",or Pater with let us say some of the blank verse of Wordsworth.
1225,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Professor Patterson claimed that all prose has rhythm, and he called"
1226,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose ""syncopated rhythm."" He rightly pointed out that passages of prose"
1227,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",have a rhythm which in nowise differs from the rhythm of free verse. He
1228,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","refuses to regard free verse, as some seek to do, as a third medium for"
1229,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetic expression. He shows that the arrangement of free verse into
1230,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",irregular lines merely calls attention to the rhythms. All prose may be
1231,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",arranged as free verse and all free verse as prose. Since such is the
1232,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","case, all literature of ecstasy in prose has rhythm besides ecstasy and"
1233,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","should certainly be called poetry. Dr. Patterson made one error,"
1234,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","however, to which Dr. Cary F. Jacob calls attention in her _Foundations"
1235,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and Nature of Verse_. Prose may have rhythm but it has no continuity of
1236,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","progress in the rhythms, which must eventually break down; it has no"
1237,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","intention of continuous rhythmic flow. But poetry, I urge, may exist in"
1238,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose without a continuity of progress of rhythms or even without rhythm
1239,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","at all--(after all, in spite of Dr. Patterson, there is unrhythmical"
1240,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose).
1241,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1242,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The view that rhythm is vital to poetry is fallacious. Accentuation at
1243,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",unequal intervals of time no more creates or heightens poetic fervor
1244,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","than, as was formerly supposed, measured stress on syllables did so. If"
1245,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the prime motive of an unrhythmical prose work, in whole or part, is the"
1246,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","communication of an emotion or the ecstatic treatment of an idea, that"
1247,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",production is emphatically a poem; or at least some portions of it are
1248,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",separately entitled to that name. If you deny it you will be compelled
1249,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",to maintain that the able unrhythmical prose translations we have of the
1250,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Greek and Latin poets contain no poetry. In fact the best way to judge
1251,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","if a composition in verse is poetry is, as Goethe and Hearn said, to"
1252,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",translate it into the prose of another language; if poetic emotions are
1253,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","not then revealed, rest assured that they were never present in the"
1254,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","original work. When the rhyme, metre and rhythm have been abstracted and"
1255,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the poetic fire still glows almost undiminished, we have the best proof,"
1256,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",first that its existence did not depend upon the use of verbal measures
1257,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and sounds, and secondly, that the poetry is not lost even when"
1258,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",transferred into the prose of another tongue.
1259,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1260,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","The first question the reader will now ask is: ""Well, what then"
1261,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",constitutes the difference between prose and poetry if you take away
1262,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the distinguishing feature of rhythm?"" And some misguided critics assert"
1263,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that the term prose poetry is a hybrid and a contradiction in terms. The
1264,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",embarrassment of the former and the misconception of the latter will
1265,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","disappear if they remember that the opposite of prose is not poetry, but"
1266,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse or metre. As Coleridge said, science is the proper antithesis of"
1267,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry. An unemotional presentation of dull facts is, however, the real"
1268,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",antithesis.
1269,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1270,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Poetry is absolutely independent of any adornment it may be given, such"
1271,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","as rhyme, metre, or, as I am especially trying to show, rhythm; even"
1272,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",though it is true that emotional language may tend to become rhythmical.
1273,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Verse is simply an ordering of words so that the modulation by the voice
1274,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",especially attracts the ear by the regularity of stress. We have
1275,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","stories, dramas and essays in different measures of verse just as we"
1276,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","have them in prose. Description, narration, exposition, even argument"
1277,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and exclamation, appear in verse as well as in prose. There are, as it"
1278,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","has always been recognized, innumerable products in verse that from the"
1279,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",nature of their contents are destitute of the attributes of poetry.
1280,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Humorous and didactic efforts, mere jokes or commonplace sermons, do not"
1281,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",become poetical because they are put in metre or rhythm. Abstract
1282,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","philosophy, concrete science and barren theology remain arid and"
1283,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",unemotional discourses even in the epics of Dante and Milton. A bare and
1284,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",not particularly interesting statement of facts or a procession of dull
1285,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and platitudinous ideas is, even in verse, anything but poetry. In the"
1286,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",range of the world's metrical writings the poems are few and far
1287,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",between.
1288,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1289,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","On the other hand, it has always been recognized that there were prose"
1290,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",compositions that partook of the nature of poetry or were replete with
1291,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetical parts. It was difficult to classify this literature, for the"
1292,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",extreme beauty and emotion which pervaded it lifted it above ordinary
1293,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose and yet because of the absence of measure it was not classified as
1294,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry. The first English critic who perceived that the authors of such
1295,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",work were really poets and should be designated by their appropriate
1296,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",name was Sir Philip Sidney. He showed that verse was but an ornament and
1297,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","did not make poetry, and that there were many poets, among whom he named"
1298,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Xenophon, who never versified. Shelley, however, has given the widest"
1299,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",vogue to the feeling that the distinction between poets and prose
1300,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",writers was a vulgar error. He maintained that philosophers like Bacon
1301,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and Plato, historians like Herodotus, Plutarch and Livy, authors of"
1302,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","revolutions in opinion such as Jesus and Rousseau, were poets."
1303,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1304,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Coleridge held that the object of poetry was to communicate pleasure,"
1305,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and remarked: ""But the communication of pleasure may be the immediate"

1307,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in a high degree attained, as in novels and romance. Would then the mere"
1308,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","superaddition of metre, with or without rhyme, entitle these to the name"
1309,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of poems? The answer is, that nothing can permanently please, which does"
1310,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","not contain in itself the reason why it is so, and not otherwise. . . ."
1311,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","The writings of Plato, and Bishop Taylor, and the _Theoria Sacra_ of"
1312,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Burnet, furnish undeniable proof that poetry of the highest kind may"

1327,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Emerson also said he heard the Germans considered the author of

1331,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1332,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Hazlitt stated that there were some prose works that approached poetry

1339,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Balzac considered himself a poet and Ibsen in mentioning his prose
1340,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","dramas often used the word ""poems."""
1341,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1342,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The habit of calling productions in metre or rhythm poetry has been so
1343,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",strongly ingrained in us that we denominate every lengthy performance in
1344,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse a poem _in toto_. Before Poe, Coleridge said that ""a poem of any"
1345,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","length neither can be nor ought to be all poetry."" Poe gave us the"
1346,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",reasons for this proposition and demonstrated to us that a long epic
1347,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poem is but a series of short poems connected by uninspired passages in
1348,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",metre. The same thing may be said of literary verse performances of
1349,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","moderate length. To those who object to using the word ""poem"" in"
1350,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","connection with any prose composition one may reply that these, like"
1351,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse productions, are also often made up of poetical parts here and"
1352,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",there; they simply lack regular rhythm and this is not a sufficient
1353,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",line of demarcation as to what constitutes poetry and what does not.
1354,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1355,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",There are many short stories in verse which are known as poems while
1356,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",there are many poetical tales and sketches in prose which no one finds
1357,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","to be poetry, although they often contain more of it than many specimens"
1358,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in measure. I think Poe's _Eleonora_ with its description of the Valley
1359,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of Many Colored Grass and Hawthorne's _Haunted Mind_ are greater poems,"
1360,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","though in prose, than most of Holmes' and Bryant's verse poems are. I"
1361,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","see no reason why we should not designate as poetry, prose tales where"
1362,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",ecstasy and emotion predominate. Kipling's _Brushwood Boy_ or Bret
1363,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Harte's _Outcasts of Poker Flat_ is as poetical, I believe, as any tale"
1364,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in Longfellow's _Tales of a Wayside Inn_. The same laws of emotional
1365,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",appeal are working in the one as in the other; a similar artistic stamp
1366,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","is printed on all these stories. In fact, Longfellow's tales are"
1367,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",inferior in the quality and quantity of poetry to the stories specified.
1368,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",His compositions could easily be arranged in prose and the stories of
1369,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Kipling or Harte could be transposed into metrical verse. The transfer

1371,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1372,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",It is a confused system of literary classification which does not permit

1376,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1377,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",To bring sharply before the reader's mind the idea that a piece in verse
1378,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","is often not poetry and that a prose passage frequently is a poem, I"
1379,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",will quote at random two passages.

1381,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",One is from a work that is rich with poetry and written by one of
1382,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","England's greatest poets and yet the particular section, though in"
1383,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","metre, is but a dry statement of facts. I quote from Wordsworth's"
1384,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Michael_, one of the finest things in English literature, yet"
1385,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",unpoetical in the first part:
1386,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1387,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Upon the forest side in Grasmere Vale
1388,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name."
1389,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","An old man stout of heart, and strong of limb."
1390,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",His bodily frame had been from youth to age
1391,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Of an unusual strength; his mind was keen,"
1392,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",And in his Shepherd calling he was prompt
1393,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",And watchful more than ordinary men.
1394,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1395,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Here are unpoetical lines which might have been written in prose, but"
1396,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Wordsworth had to give us some preliminary information so that we could
1397,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","follow his story. Incidentally, he has the reputation for having much"
1398,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prosy material in the body of his work.
1399,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1400,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The other passage I quote is purposely a translation from a foreign
1401,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","novel and yet it has not lost any of its poetry. The paragraph, of which"
1402,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","I give part, is a poem and part of a larger one in prose. It is from"
1403,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",D'Annunzio's _Triumph of Death_ and describes the music in Wagner's

1412,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",expressed a continual and ever vain effort to attain the
1413,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",inaccessible. In the impetuosity of the chromatic progressions
1414,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",there was the mad pursuit of a happiness that eluded every
1415,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","grasp, although it shone ever so near, etc."
1416,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1417,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I shall show more fully that our definitions of what is poetry and what
1418,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",is a poem have been faulty. The error is so perceptible that it is
1419,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",surprising that so few critics have detected it. Meanwhile I will give
1420,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",my definitions:
1421,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1422,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",_Poetry is not a department of literature in the sense that the novel or
1423,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the essay or the drama is, but is an atmosphere which bathes literature"
1424,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whenever ecstasy and emotion are present. It is not a distinct division
1425,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of art as literature, music or painting is, for poetry is the very"
1426,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","essence of all these arts whether it is transmitted by words, sounds or"
1427,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",colors. It is the ecstatic emotional spirit which pervades all good
1428,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","literature (or any of the arts) whether in verse or prose, in their"
1429,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",finest parts. It is an aesthetic quality which gives tone to a literary
1430,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",work or any portion or portions of it. It may exist without figures of
1431,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","speech, rhyme, metre or rhythm.[52:A] Its most natural language is prose"
1432,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",or free verse._ Let us have no more such classification of literature as
1433,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","fiction, drama, essay, criticism, _poetry_, etc. There is fiction in"
1434,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse and there is prose fiction; there are verse dramas and prose
1435,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","plays, etc., and any of these may be steeped in poetry. However, the"
1436,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",customary lyric verse may be comprised under the heading of poetry not
1437,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","because of the measure, but on account of the poetic emotion that"
1438,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","usually characterizes it. Let us also not speak of the arts like music,"
1439,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","painting, sculpture and poetry when instead of the last we mean"
1440,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","literature, for poetry is a quality of all the arts including"
1441,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",literature. Poetry is the spirit of ecstasy and emotion which pervades
1442,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the arts like music, painting, sculpture and literature, and hence it"
1443,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","may be found in every branch of literature whether in verse or prose,"
1444,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","like the drama, fiction and the essay."
1445,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1446,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",We are now in a position to define what a poem is. Critics are agreed
1447,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that it must consist of the artistic expression of words which arouse
1448,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the reader's emotion, but they have insisted that these words be"
1449,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","rhythmically arranged. I think if the latter limitation is withdrawn,"
1450,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",all our confusion as to what is a poem will disappear. _A poem is any
1451,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","literary composition, whether in verse or prose, which as a whole is an"
1452,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","imaginative creation, a vehicle of emotion, an expression of ecstasy; or"
1453,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that portion or every portion of such a composition where the emotion or
1454,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",ecstasy has been concentrated. It does not follow that the work as a
1455,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whole is necessarily poetry. Its most natural language is prose or free
1456,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse._
1457,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1458,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Poems may therefore be found in imaginative philosophical works like
1459,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Plato's _Symposium_, _Phaedrus_, _Republic_ and other dialogues, Bacon's"
1460,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Essays_, Schopenhauer's _World as Will and Idea_, Nietzsche's _Thus"
1461,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Spake Zarathustra_, Emerson's _Essays_, in critical works like Pater's"
1462,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Renaissance_, Ruskin's _Modern Painters_, Wilde's _Intentions_, in"
1463,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",histories like Thucydides's _Peloponnesian War_ and Carlyle's _French
1464,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Revolution_, in autobiographies like St. Augustine's _Confessions_ and"
1465,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Rousseau's _Confessions_, in letters like Madame Lespinasse's and Mrs."
1466,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Browning's, in diaries like those of Amiel, in novels by Balzac,"
1467,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Dickens, Hawthorne, Hardy, Tolstoy, etc."
1468,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1469,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Some of the best poetry is found in the world's prose fiction. For
1470,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","example, _The Scarlet Letter_ has as good poetry in it as the _Aeneid_."
1471,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Like the old epic, it is made up of great poems connected by extended"
1472,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","portions that belongs to general literature, sections that have not"
1473,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",enough emotion to be regarded as poetry nor are yet arid or passionless
1474,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",enough to be termed science. But the story of Hester Prynne is poetry as
1475,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","truly as the tale of Dido, and undoubtedly you cannot refuse the"
1476,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",appellation poetry to the chapter in Hawthorne's novel which describes
1477,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",how Arthur Dimmesdale gets up in the pulpit and confesses to the
1478,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",congregation his part in Hester Prynne's guilt. The _Aeneid_ is really a
1479,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",novel in verse.
1480,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1481,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",We are not often moved by metrical writing as we are by the last part of
1482,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the chapter in _David Copperfield_ entitled, ""A Greater Loss,"" where we"
1483,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",see the agonizing grief of the elder Pegotty and of Ham over the
1484,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","elopement of Emily, Ham's betrothed. You recall the love scene telling"
1485,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of the meeting of Richard and Lucy in Meredith's novel _The Ordeal of
1486,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Richard Feverel_, only as poetry. This is how the passage, which being"
1487,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","rhythmical besides, begins:"
1488,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1489,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Golden lie the meadows; golden run the streams; red gold is on
1490,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the pine-stems. The sun is coming down to earth, and walks the"
1491,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",fields and the waters.
1492,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1493,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","The sun is coming down to earth, and the fields and the waters"
1494,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",shout to him golden shouts. He comes and his heralds run
1495,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","before him, and touch the leaves of oaks and the planes and"
1496,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the beeches lucid green, and the pine stems redder gold;"
1497,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","leaving the brightest footprints upon thickly-weeded barks,"
1498,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","where the foxglove's last upper-bells incline, and the bramble"
1499,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","shoots wander amid moist rich herbage, etc."
1500,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1501,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",If the sphere of poetry has thus been widened to include many
1502,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","compositions in prose formerly excluded, it has, on the other hand, been"
1503,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",narrowed by omitting much in verse that was formerly admitted into the
1504,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",domain of the Muses. I refer especially to the whole body of unecstatic
1505,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","philosophical, scientific and theological discourses in verse which"
1506,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",usurp a name not belonging to them; I refer to much descriptive and
1507,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",narrative verse that lacks the poetic glow; I would exclude nearly all
1508,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of the so-called ""light,"" ""occasional"" and ""humorous"" verse. Winnow the"
1509,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",voluminous verse writers and but a modicum of poetry remains.
1510,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1511,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Critics as a rule agree that neither rhythm nor metre makes a literary
1512,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","performance poetical if the author's soul does not enter into the work,"
1513,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",but they refuse to countenance the corollary that when unrhythmical
1514,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose is used as a medium for the singer's poetical sentiments the
1515,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",result should also be called poetry. It is an easy matter to arrange any
1516,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",fine poetical prose in blank verse or irregular rhythmical lines. Just a
1517,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",few slight verbal changes are necessary. The new product then fulfills
1518,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the conditions of the old theory which demands metre or rhythm. Does it
1519,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","become poetry because of these unimportant changes? No, these do not"
1520,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",work so miraculous an effect upon the writing. It acquires no higher
1521,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",qualities than it had before in prose.
1522,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1523,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I hence fail to see why the _Idylls of the King_ should be alone called
1524,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poems and not also parts of Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, which Tennyson"
1525,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","paraphrased in blank verse. Malory has, however, been deemed a poet by"
1526,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",some critics and any one who will read the lament over the death of Sir
1527,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Lancelot will not begrudge the author that title. One admits that the
1528,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",_Tales_ of La Fontaine and Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_ are very rich in
1529,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry, but why say that the original prose stories which these poets"
1530,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",often re-tell in verse (undoubtedly improving them by their own genius)
1531,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",are not? And who will deny the statement that the best of Scott's
1532,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","novels, say _The Heart of Midlothian_, contains as much, if not more,"
1533,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry than some of his novels in verse like the _Lady of the Lake_?
1534,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Even in his day the reviewers saw that there was no difference between
1535,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Scott's verse and prose stories as far as the quality of the poetry was
1536,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",concerned; indeed they saw that there was more of the divine afflatus in
1537,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the latter than there was in the former. In fact the _Quarterly Review_
1538,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",referred to Scott's novels as poems.
1539,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1540,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","One may even say that the great Shakespeare found in the dramas, tales"
1541,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and chronicles that were his sources some of the poetry we note in his
1542,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",plays. Especially is this true in regard to his use of Plutarch. Brandes
1543,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",has pointed out that _Julius Cæsar_ is found in every detail in
1544,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Plutarch's Lives of Cæsar, Brutus and Mark Anthony. The dramatist"
1545,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","followed the biographer point for point, repeating word for word"
1546,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","passages of North's translation, accepting the characters as they stood"
1547,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",there and repeating all the leading incidents. If _Julius Cæsar_
1548,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","contains poetry, as it certainly does in abundance, then surely those"
1549,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",lives of Plutarch which were followed by Shakespeare must also possess
1550,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",it.
1551,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1552,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Nor can I understand why the parts of Shakespeare's plays which are in
1553,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose and are often superior to many portions in blank verse should also
1554,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",not be called poetry. Take the first scene of the fifth act of
1555,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Macbeth_, where Lady Macbeth is walking in her sleep. The entire"
1556,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","section, though prose, is one of the most poetic pieces in the entire"
1557,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",drama. If the passage had been written in blank verse it could not have
1558,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",been improved. The poetry is there in the scene itself and not in any
1559,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","possible metre. Other lines might be cited, like Hamlet's remarks to"
1560,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Guildenstern, who tried to pry out his secret and play upon him as upon"
1561,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",a pipe; or his reflections on what a wonderful piece of work was man; or
1562,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",his comments over Yorick's skull. All these selections are in
1563,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",impassioned prose and are as much entitled to the rank of poetry as are
1564,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",most of the blank verse of the drama. Hamlet's advice to the players
1565,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","though art criticism, and prose, is so lit up with poetic glamor that it"
1566,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",deserves the name poetry more than the metrical version of some of the
1567,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",moral commonplaces in the play.
1568,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1569,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",One may ask various questions of the critic who clings to the old
1570,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",definition that metre or rhythm must accompany poetry. Why should
1571,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Conrad's supreme poetic description of a storm at sea in his _Nigger of
1572,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the Narcissus_ not be called a poem, when you designate by this word"
1573,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Virgil's famous description in dactylic hexameters in the first book of
1574,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the _Aeneid_? Powerful and deservedly renowned as the Virgil passage is,"
1575,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I venture to say that it does not as a poem rank higher than some of
1576,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Conrad's descriptions. One would wish to be informed where the story of
1577,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",ingratitude in Balzac's novel _Père Goriot_ is any the less poetical
1578,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",than that of Shakespeare's verse play _King Lear_. Why is the succession
1579,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of ideas in Browning's _Rabbi Ben Ezra_ called poetry and not, let us"
1580,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","say, Emerson's essay on _Self-Reliance_? Why call the descriptions of"
1581,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","battles by Homer poems, but not those of Stendhal or Tolstoy or Zola in"
1582,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",_Le Chartreuse de Parme_ or _War and Peace_ or _Le Debâcle_? And how can
1583,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",you on any pretence refuse to include in the category of poetry De
1584,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Quincey's famous prose poems _The Dream Fugue_ and _Levana and Our
1585,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Ladies of Sorrow_?
1586,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1587,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Since the critics would not admit that any unrhythmical prose is poetry,"
1588,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",it is little wonder that Baudelaire founded as a distinct and conscious
1589,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","form the composition he called ""poem in prose."" We are told by his"
1590,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","translator, Mr. Sturm, that he had dreamed in his days of ambition ""of a"
1591,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","miracle of poetical prose, musical without rhythm and without rhyme."" He"
1592,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",understood and proved that rhythm was not necessary to poetry. He
1593,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",derived the idea of this separate form from Poe and Bertrand. He has
1594,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","been followed by Turgenev, who left us some prose poems which he called"
1595,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",_Senilia_. The reader may recall the love scene in _The House of
1596,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Gentlefolk_ and the concluding chapters of _Rudin_ and _Fathers and
1597,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Sons_, which are all prose poems. Gorki has written some exquisite prose"
1598,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poems. One of them, _The March of Man_, is one of the most beautiful"
1599,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poems ever written. (Translated in _The Cosmopolitan_ for July, 1905.)"
1600,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1601,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Really, every great literary man is a poet, for he is constantly"
1602,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",occupied with ecstasy and human emotions. Do you think Hugo was a poet
1603,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",only when he chanted in verse and ceased being one when he wrote _Les
1604,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Misérables_ or _Notre Dame de Paris_? It is not necessary to use the old
1605,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetical machinery of rhythm, or metaphors or similes, or apostrophe or"
1606,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",personification or any other figure of speech; one may dispense with
1607,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",allusions to mythology or the use of any but current expressions and
1608,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",idioms; one may write almost as one talks; and poetry may nevertheless
1609,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",be produced. When Macpherson in the eighteenth century and Chateaubriand
1610,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in the early part of the nineteenth century gave us in imitation of the
1611,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","old epics the long prose poems _Fingal_ and _Les Martyrs_, respectively,"
1612,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",they sinned artistically only because they were imitators and were
1613,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",stilted and rhetorical. These books contain excellent poetry in prose;
1614,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",we to-day can scarcely imagine the vogue they had. Had they been more
1615,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",natural they would still be read.
1616,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1617,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I believe the application of the theory of poetry I advocate would work
1618,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",many changes in literary values. Who can doubt that Ibsen and Balzac are
1619,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","greater poets than John Hay or Edmund Clarence Stedman, both of whom"
1620,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","have respectable rank elsewhere, the former as a statesman and the"
1621,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",latter as a critic? Yet our system of literary classification stamps
1622,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","these two as poets because of a few popular and able lyrics in verse,"
1623,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","while Ibsen and Balzac, who wrote in prose, are not even considered"
1624,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poets, according to academic standards. It is true Ibsen also wrote some"
1625,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","lyrics and a few plays in verse, but he is as much a poet in _The Wild"
1626,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Duck_ or _The Master Builder_ as he is in _Peer Gynt_ or _Brand_. The
1627,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",scenes of Oswald losing his mind at the end of _Ghosts_ or of Ella
1628,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Rentheim rebuking _John Gabriel Borkman_ for his desertion of her are
1629,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",magnificent poems. As for the poems of Balzac they are too numerous to
1630,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",mention. The picture of the miser in _Eugénie Grandet_ is surely poetry.
1631,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Balzac regarded his stories _Louis Lambert_, _Séraphita_ and _The Lily"
1632,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of the Valley_ as poems. Inflated as they occasionally are, they are"
1633,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",suffused with poetical qualities. One could go on selecting poems from
1634,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Cousin Pons_, _The Wild Ass's Skin_, _Lost Illusions_, etc. Balzac and"
1635,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Ibsen are poets and any definition of poetry that would exclude them as
1636,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",such is faulty.
1637,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1638,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Under the new method of distinguishing poets that I seek to promulgate,"
1639,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",many writers will be admitted as such whom the world never dreamt of as
1640,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",seers. It might astonish some people if I make a claim for Mark Twain as
1641,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",a poet. But who that has read _Huckleberry Finn_ and recalls the
1642,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","description of the sunrise on the Mississippi, given in the nineteenth"
1643,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","chapter, will be prone to exclude our greatest imaginative and"
1644,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",philosophical humorist from the ranks of Apollo's servants?
1645,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1646,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","To convince the skeptical, I quote from the famous passage where Huck"
1647,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","fearing he would go to hell if he freed a ""nigger"" slave, determines to"
1648,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",disclose Jim's whereabouts and writes a note to that effect. We all
1649,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","recall his mental struggles, how he finally tore the letter, with the"
1650,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","words ""All right, I'll _go_ to hell."" The few pages telling of the"
1651,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",reflections and memories which led to this decision are certainly
1652,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry.
1653,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1654,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim
1655,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time,"
1656,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating"
1657,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","along, talking and singing and laughing. . . . I'd see him"
1658,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I"
1659,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","could go on sleeping; . . . and would always call me honey,"
1660,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and"
1661,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",how good he always was.
1662,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1663,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Our definition allows us to include the author of the few lines
1664,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","beginning ""With malice towards none, with charity towards all"" as a"
1665,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poet. Indeed, I have been anticipated in the claim that Lincoln was a"
1666,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poet, as the Gettysburg speech has been on several occasions called a"
1667,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poem.
1668,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1669,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",It may be asserted that it is rather difficult to differentiate the
1670,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetical portions of a prose work from the rest. This same problem
1671,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",confronts us in verse. Who can point out exactly which lines in the
1672,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",_Iliad_ are poetry? The fact is that there are passages in both prose
1673,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and metrical literature that we unhesitatingly call poems because they
1674,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",instantly transform us. Just as you never doubted that the speeches of
1675,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Andromache are poetical and that the catalogue of the ships is not, so"
1676,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",you will find it no problem to discard the tedious descriptions in
1677,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Balzac as unpoetical while you accept the emotional sections as poems.
1678,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Just as critics have selected the poems from lengthy metrical works,"
1679,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","choosing the story of Margaret from Wordsworth's _Excursion_, for"
1680,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","example, so they could glean the poems of prose literature."
1681,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1682,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",One objection raised to the use of prose as a poetical vehicle is its
1683,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",tendency to diffusiveness. It is claimed that here there are always
1684,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",temptations to digress and become trivial; hence we get the interminable
1685,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",novels and stupendous treatises which as a rule we do not have in verse.
1686,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",But one may grow verbose and expatiate too much in metre as well: the
1687,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",matter rests entirely with the author. Note how ponderous are some of
1688,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the old epics, the _Iliad_, the _Divine Comedy_ and _Orlando Furioso_."
1689,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","In modern times Byron's _Don Juan_, Browning's _Ring and the Book_ and"
1690,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Mrs. Browning's _Aurora Leigh_ are examples of lengthy stories in verse.
1691,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","All of these books are more voluminous than the prose plays, essays,"
1692,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","short stories, and novelettes to which we are accustomed. The prose poet"
1693,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",may weed out the trifling incidents and expunge the redundant from his
1694,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",composition as easily as the verse writer. Wordy insignificant passages
1695,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in a literary product are the outcome, not of a particular rhythmical"
1696,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","arrangement, such as prose or verse, but of a want of artistic feeling,"
1697,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",to which even great geniuses are at times subject. It does not follow
1698,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that a powerful description or an emotional idea or an impassioned state
1699,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of mind need tend to diffusiveness if written in prose. The poet who has
1700,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",learned self-restraint in composing does not lose his sense of
1701,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",proportion even when writing in prose.
1702,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1703,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Nor need we prefer the verse form to prose, because, as it is alleged, a"
1704,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",metrical poem gives us the maximum poetry in the fewest words. It is
1705,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","true we get an immediate thrill out of a rhymed lyric or sonnet, while"
1706,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",we often have to read a few chapters in a novel to get a similar
1707,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",sensation. Nevertheless this is not because the lyric or sonnet is in
1708,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse and the novel in prose. It was the intention of the verse poet to
1709,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",captivate us instantly in these forms. Translate the sonnet or lyric
1710,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",into the prose of another language and the excitement seizes us just as
1711,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",quickly. Poe's _Raven_ is known to French readers chiefly in a literal
1712,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose translation. They respond to it as quickly as we do, though they"
1713,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",have to forego the rhyme and the metre. The writer of unrhythmical prose
1714,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",may concentrate any emotions in a short space if he wishes to do so.
1715,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Many brief prose poems in literature are dynamos of emotion. Ecstasy can
1716,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","be concentrated in a short prose poem as readily as in a verse, lyric"
1717,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",or sonnet. The important thing is that the poet record the sentiments
1718,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","instantly, avoiding preliminaries."
1719,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1720,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Yet the bulk of the prose we have will not become poetry because of the
1721,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",new outlook I suggest. It is after all only at times that we can single
1722,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",out poems in them. Most prose works of merit fall short of being poetry
1723,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",as a whole or in parts. The ecstasy or emotion is often not concentrated
1724,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in any particular part of the work. The facts, notions or ideas are not"
1725,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","emotionally presented. Yet the volume is literature, and is more akin to"
1726,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry than to science. But it is no discredit to a book because it is
1727,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",just literature and not poetry.
1728,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1729,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Gurney in his _The Power of Sound_ calls attention to the fact that when
1730,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Lessing defined the limits between the plastic arts and poetry, he made"
1731,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",no distinction between verse and prose in his conception of poetry.
1732,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Whatever Lessing says about poetry in the _Laocoon_ applies equally well
1733,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","to prose. True, he uses Homer as an illustration, but he could just as"
1734,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","well have used a modern novel, for the question of metre is never raised"
1735,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in determining the province of poetry, which he differentiates from that"
1736,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of painting. The only place he mentions the prose writer is in the
1737,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","seventeenth section, where he says that the prose writer usually aims"
1738,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","only after intelligibility and clarity, while the poet seeks also to be"
1739,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",vivid. He does not say that the prose writer may not also be a poet if
1740,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",he is vivid. In fact this is the very inference. He states also that the
1741,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse writer who aims at producing no illusion but addresses the
1742,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","understanding is not a poet, instancing Virgil when in the _Georgics_ he"
1743,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",describes a cow fit for breeding.
1744,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1745,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",This is then the singular and most remarkable fact about the _Laocoon_
1746,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that the author includes all vivid emotional narrative prose under the
1747,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","term poetry, which he distinguishes from painting. It is easy to see"
1748,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","that his famous distinction, that objects side by side in space or"
1749,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","bodies with their visible properties are the fit subjects for painting,"
1750,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",while actions or objects which succeed each other in time are the
1751,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","peculiar subjects of poetry, is really also a distinction between the"
1752,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","plastic arts and the prose novel or short story. Painting, according to"
1753,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Lessing, was descriptive, poetry was narrative. Now narrative properly"
1754,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",is the object of the novel. It is true Lessing defined poetry in a
1755,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","limited manner, as if it were only narrative literature; but we are"
1756,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","grateful to him for implying that vivid prose narrative is poetry, and"
1757,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that poetry extends beyond metrical compositions.
1758,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1759,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",It is commonly said that an emotional piece of prose writing is not
1760,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry, but the raw material for poetry. Even Arthur Symons calls such"
1761,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",warning only poetical substance. One critic has even designated it as a
1762,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",sort of bastard writing that is neither prose nor poetry. In fact
1763,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",rhythmical emotional prose has been a thorn in the academic critic's
1764,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",side. He has become more confused than ever since the vogue of free
1765,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse, some of which though really prose is beyond question poetry. He"
1766,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",no longer refuses the title of poet to Whitman and he shrinks from
1767,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",denying that the best free verse is poetry. He feels vaguely that since
1768,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose is also often rhythmical, the old definition of poetry as an"
1769,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","emotional piece of rhythmical writing is faulty, for it must include"
1770,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","also emotional rhythmical prose, and he objects to this inclusion."
1771,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Professor Lowes, who, in his _Convention and Revolt in Poetry_,"
1772,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",recognizes the similarity between the rhythm of free verse and that of
1773,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","prose, unsuccessfully solves the problem by saying that poetry is used"
1774,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in a loose as well as in a more rigid sense and that free verse is an
1775,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","artistic medium of not fully developed possibilities. He, like most"
1776,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","critics, falls into the error of saying that we cannot include prose"
1777,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whenever we speak of poetry. Still we must be grateful to Lowes for his
1778,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",liberal attitude towards new verse forms.
1779,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1780,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Critics who say that emotional prose should be metrical to be called
1781,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry remind us of the paraphrasers of a few centuries ago who put the
1782,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Psalms into rhyme. They did not make them poetry, they usually robbed"
1783,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","them of it, and spoiled their effect. Even Milton succumbed to the vice."
1784,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","And Gosse, in his article on ""Lyrical Poetry"" in the _Encyclopedia"
1785,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Britannica_, tells us of one Azzi who in 1700 put the book of _Genesis_"
1786,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","into sonnets. Emotional prose, rhythmical or not, is poetry. No one"
1787,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",to-day thinks of employing Matthew Arnold's touchstone theory of poetry
1788,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whereby we are to have a few metrical lines of some great poets to apply
1789,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",as a test as to what is poetry.
1790,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1791,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","It is really strange that with the English prose Bible before them,"
1792,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",critics should have insisted on the metrical element in poetry. And one
1793,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",must add that parallelisms are not the fundamental features of poetry.
1794,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The poetry of Isaiah and David would have been poetry without a single
1795,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","parallelism. But we need not go to the prophets or the Psalms, where we"
1796,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","have parallelism, for poetry in the Bible: we have it in the narrative"
1797,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","portions, in the stories of Ruth and Joseph. Who does not feel the"
1798,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetical emotions surge through him as he comes to the forty-fifth
1799,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","chapter of _Genesis_, where Joseph reveals himself to his brothers?"
1800,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Fearing they will be dismayed because they sold him, he assures them"
1801,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that their criminal deed was just what has enabled him to become a ruler
1802,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and save them from starvation. A poet was he who wrote this chapter
1803,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",beginning with the lines:
1804,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1805,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all that stood by
1806,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","him; and he cried, ""Cause every man to go out from me."" And"
1807,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known"
1808,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","to his brethren, etc."
1809,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1810,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",We must always remember that the emotional appeal whether in prose or
1811,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse is the same to us. We do not get one kind of ecstasy by reading
1812,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetical prose and another kind by reading verse. Our inner soul is
1813,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","stirred, our aesthetic faculties are touched in the same way if we read"
1814,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","a beautiful love letter like one in prose of Eloise's, or a love poem in"
1815,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse. And it may be said here that no poet has improved upon those
1816,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose epistles by changing them into metrical form. An idea colored with
1817,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",emotion and a beautiful description give us the same effects in prose as
1818,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",they do in verse. The test of poetry is in our own souls.
1819,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1820,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","We can find poetry in the most unexpected places, and the reader who"
1821,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",wants to look for it will be able to see that poets like Wordsworth and
1822,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Whitman were poets in their prose critical prefaces as well as in the
1823,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Lyrical Ballads_ and _Leaves of Grass_. As a matter of fact, Whitman"
1824,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","used paragraphs from his critical essays, word for word, in _Leaves of"
1825,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Grass_, but arranged in free verse form."
1826,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1827,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","It is true that at times the poetry cannot be distilled, as it were,"
1828,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",from the body of a prose work; a particular passage cannot be lifted up
1829,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","and called poetry, though it be such (dependent, however, on what goes"
1830,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","before and after). For example, every reader is thrilled with emotion"
1831,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","when he comes to the conclusion of the chapter in _Vanity Fair_, where"
1832,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Amelia Sedley is praying for George Osborne, who was lying dead on his"
1833,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","face with a bullet through his heart. This line is poetry, but only by"
1834,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",reason of our taking it into consideration with earlier parts of the
1835,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","novel. It could not be published alone, for it would be meaningless."
1836,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",But the same is true of poetry in verse. When Horatio says of Hamlet
1837,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","""now cracks a noble heart,"" and hopes that flights of angels will sing"
1838,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","him to his rest, the passage is effective only because we have lived"
1839,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",with Hamlet and felt with him and admired him. Printed alone the words
1840,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","would mean little. The poetry of a great novel, like that of a verse"
1841,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","play, is not always in isolated passages, but in the entire novel or"
1842,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",play from which it cannot be extracted by quotation.
1843,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1844,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",All lovers of poetry cannot help being indebted to Sir Arthur
1845,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Quiller-Couch, who showed he knew what constitutes poetry when he"
1846,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",composed the famous _Oxford Book of English Verse_. But one is grieved
1847,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that one must differ with him when it comes to literary criticism. In
1848,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","his book on the _Art of Writing_ there is a chapter called ""On the"
1849,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Difference Between Verse and Prose"" which justifies inversion of the"
1850,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",natural order of words in verse and affirms that this inversion (of
1851,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",course along with metre and rhyme at will) is the difference between
1852,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse and prose. He uses the old illustration that rhyme, metre and"
1853,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","inversion help the memory, and that since the first poets sang their"
1854,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poems to the harp, and music and emotion were introduced, everything is"
1855,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",changed down to the natural order of the words.
1856,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1857,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Now, aside from the fact that not all of the earliest emotional"
1858,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","compositions were sung to the harp, it is admitted on all sides that"
1859,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry is no longer written primarily to be sung to the harp. Hence
1860,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",there is no further necessity for this inversion of words. The natural
1861,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","order of prose should be retained in emotional writing, with occasional"
1862,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",deviations. But most certainly this inversion does not constitute the
1863,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",difference between poetry and non-poetry even if it often does make
1864,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",verse different from prose.
1865,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1866,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Sir Arthur gives us a few lines of Milton in the inverse order in which
1867,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",they were written and says they are verse with the accent of poetry. He
1868,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",then rewrites them in prose order. The inference is that they no longer
1869,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","have that accent of poetry. They are not poetry in the prose version,"
1870,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","however, because they were not poetry in the original verse order. He"
1871,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","takes four lines from the second book of _Paradise Regained_, describing"
1872,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Christ's ascent up a hill, and gives us a prose paraphrase of them. Here"
1873,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",are the lines as Milton wrote them:
1874,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1875,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Up to a hill anon his steps he reared
1876,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","From whose high top to ken the prospect round,"
1877,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","If cottage were in view, sheep-cote or herd;"
1878,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw."
1879,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1880,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Here is Quiller-Couch's prose rendering:
1881,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1882,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Thereupon he climbed a hill on the chance that the view from
1883,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",its summit might disclose some sign of human habitation--a
1884,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","herd, a sheep-cote, a cottage perhaps. But he could see"
1885,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",nothing of the sort.
1886,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1887,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",This prose paraphrase really proves that the original had no touch of
1888,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry. Because the passage as written in metre uses poetic diction like
1889,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","""anon,"" and ""ken,"" employs inversion like ""steps he reared,"" ""none he"
1890,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","saw,"" it is assumed that the passage must be poetry, but it is not, for"
1891,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",it lacks ecstasy. It is merely one of the prosaic passages in a
1892,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","composition that contains poems, and is needed to bridge over the poems."
1893,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1894,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",A prose paraphrase or explanation of a verse poem is always interesting
1895,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in helping us understand the nature of poetry. For example, Hearn, a"
1896,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poet himself, took up many English poems and paraphrased and explained"
1897,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",them to his Japanese students. Some of his paraphrases are actually
1898,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",greater poems than the originals. Most of the great poems in literature
1899,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",have been analyzed or paraphrased by biographers and commentators. No
1900,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",one calls these paraphrases poetry. But are we sure that they are not?
1901,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Are we certain that none of the original emotion or ideas are left
1902,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","intact in the paraphrase? On the contrary, I believe that the poetry"
1903,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","still remains in the paraphrase. True, often the manner of expressing an"
1904,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","idea or emotion is what counts in making it poetry, but expression alone"
1905,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","does not make poetry. Even a metrical, emotional and beautiful utterance"
1906,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of a commonplace idea sometimes becomes poetry, but I cannot concede"
1907,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",that the prose version of a great verse poem may not be poetry if still
1908,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",emotionally expressed.
1909,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1910,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Let me take a concrete instance. The following passage from _Paradise
1911,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Lost_ is considered, no doubt justly, poetry, because of the idea, the"
1912,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",emotion and the rhythm (academically speaking):
1913,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1914,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",What though the field be lost?
1915,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","All is not lost; the unconquerable will,"
1916,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","And study of revenge, immortal hate,"
1917,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","And courage never to submit or yield,"
1918,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",And what is else not to be overcome.
1919,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1920,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Let us paraphrase this passage and try to retain the idea, the emotion"
1921,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and a prose rhythm by just changing a few words.
1922,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1923,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",And suppose we lost the battle? We have not lost everything.
1924,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","We still have our unconquerable will, our plans for revenge,"
1925,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","our eternal hatred, and courage never to give in or surrender,"
1926,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",and above all never to be defeated.
1927,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1928,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Is this passage poetry or not? I submit that it is, if the original is."
1929,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","It is rhythmical (though it doesn't have to be so), the original idea is"
1930,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","there, and the passion of the speaker has not been rooted out. All this"
1931,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","proves, then, that much of what we call poetry in verse is either not"
1932,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry at all or that there is more poetry in the prose of the world
1933,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",than we ever imagined.
1934,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1935,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Is there any poetry in Lamb's _Tales from Shakespeare_? Beyond doubt;
1936,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",just as there is poetry in the tales and histories from which
1937,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Shakespeare drew his plays. Is there not poetry in the critical
1938,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",discourses about poets where the critic loses himself in the poet's
1939,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","emotions and becomes that poet and gives you his spirit, as, for"
1940,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","example, Carlyle does in his study of Burns, or Symonds in his _Greek"
1941,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Poets_?
1942,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1943,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",All this leads to one conclusion: that we should not be concerned as to
1944,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whether a piece of literature is or is not something that may be
1945,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","included in a definition of poetry, but whether it is a humane,"
1946,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","ecstatic, emotional, thoughtful piece of writing. Do not be worried"
1947,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","where the poetry is. Rest assured it is there somewhere, for we should"
1948,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",judge poetry by the effect on us and not by the compliance with rules of
1949,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",rhythm or any other rules of composition. And all great literature which
1950,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","has a similar emotional effect upon us, whether it is in verse or prose,"
1951,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",has poetry in it. Walt Whitman did not insist that his _Leaves of Grass_
1952,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",be called poetry; yet that is what it turns out to be.
1953,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1954,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The reader may reply that if poetry is to be found to a large extent in
1955,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the prose of the world, all distinctions are broken down as to what"
1956,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry is and is not, and you might as well look for it in the stories"
1957,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",in the newspapers. I gladly accept the challenge: there is poetry in the
1958,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",newspapers. When the _Spoon River Anthology_ appeared many critics said
1959,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","it was nothing more than a collection of newspaper obituaries, told in"
1960,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the first person, that differed from news items only in that the lines"
1961,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","were printed as free verse, and that therefore it was no more poetry"
1962,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","than a newspaper story. On the contrary, it would have been poetry had"
1963,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",it appeared as prose in a newspaper.
1964,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1965,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I have no doubt many readers will recall newspaper stories that moved
1966,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",them like a poem. Those especially well written ones of love tragedies
1967,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",are often poetry; by virtue of their ecstatic nature they arouse our
1968,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",emotions.
1969,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1970,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The poetry of our day is not monopolized by dabblers in metre and is not
1971,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",shared exclusively by readers of verse. It is being written by our prose
1972,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","writers and occasionally by our journalists, and is being read by the"
1973,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",general public. It is not the heritage of the professor or the critic.
1974,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","The verse poets and readers are not the only lovers of poetry, but the"
1975,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",great public who reads _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ and _Lorna Doone_ is reading
1976,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry, albeit not of the highest order."
1977,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1978,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I do not mean to imply that there is more poetry in the prose writings
1979,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of a nation's literature than in its verse writings. The prose writer
1980,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",usually travels leisurely and waxes ecstatic occasionally. He does not
1981,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",concentrate his emotions nor seek to depict them immediately. The verse
1982,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",writer as a rule tries to depict emotions from the start. He is greater
1983,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","as a poet than many prose writers, because he poetizes, thinking he must"
1984,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","do this naturally in verse, while the prose writer does not believe it"
1985,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","is his duty to do so in prose, but he is often a poet because he cannot"
1986,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",help it. There is more poetry in a volume of Burns or Shelley or Heine
1987,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","than in a volume of similar length by a prose writer, because these"
1988,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poets tried to put emotion into every separate portion, no matter how"
1989,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",small. Yet a prose writer can do the same thing if he wants to do so.
1990,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
1991,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Any one who is a great reader of books of travel is impressed by the
1992,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",fact that in these works there is occasionally literature of ecstasy of
1993,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",a high order. There are descriptions and narratives recorded with
1994,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","beauty, vividness, interest; there are reflections, insight into human"
1995,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",nature that often surpass the works of prose fiction and verse poetry we
1996,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","read. Yet because these works are called ""travels,"" they are not"
1997,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",supposed to contain poems or creative literature. Had the authors given
1998,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","us as good description in verse, the critics would have called them"
1999,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poets.
2000,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2001,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Hearn's books on Japan are after all works of travel, but they contain"
2002,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry or the literature of ecstasy because Hearn was a poet. I am not
2003,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","claiming for many works of travel a place only as literature, for it is"
2004,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","usually conceded that the best books of travel are literature, but I"
2005,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","urge that many of these books are in parts poetry, and their authors are"
2006,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poets. It is recognized, however, that Pierre Loti is a poet in his"
2007,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",books of travel. Doughty's _Arabia Deserta_ is full of poetry.
2008,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2009,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Robinson Crusoe_ and _Gulliver's Travels_ are but works of travel, and"
2010,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",are poetry because of the ecstatic presentation of ideas. You will find
2011,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poems in prose not only in the travels of great writers, like Goethe,"
2012,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Taine, Heine, in the works of old writers who were chiefly travelers,"
2013,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","like Hakluyt, Mandeville, Marco Polo, but in many volumes that have been"
2014,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",published in our own day.
2015,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2016,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Anthologies of thousands of poems in prose could be compiled. The prose
2017,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","of every literature is full of poetry, even concentrated poetry, more or"
2018,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",less rhythmical. You may cull poems out of the prose writings of men in
2019,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","England to-day, from Hardy, Moore, Yeats, Symons, Kipling, Hudson,"
2020,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Conrad, Galsworthy, Hewlett and D. H. Lawrence."
2021,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2022,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",You can find poetry in various scenes of the great body of prose
2023,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","dramatists that have grown up in Europe since Ibsen, in Hauptmann, in"
2024,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Synge, in Chekhov, in Jacinto Benavente, in dialogues where an idea is"
2025,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",fought for or an emotion displayed. It is manifestly absurd to crown
2026,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",with the name of poetry every petty emotion or description by some
2027,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","versifier, and deny it to the great dramatists who depict passions and"
2028,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",color great ideas with emotion. No one thought of denying the title of
2029,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poets to the dramatists when they formerly wrote in verse. Are you going
2030,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","to deny it to them because they give us the same, if not a greater"
2031,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",effect in their prose than the old dramatist did in verse?
2032,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2033,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","And I find much poetry, especially in letters, memoirs and biographies."
2034,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","I find poems in biographies like Bisland's _Hearn_, Meynell's _Francis"
2035,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Thompson_, Woodberry's _Poe_, Lawton's _Balzac_. I give these more or"
2036,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",less recent books as examples. The works are full of emotional passages
2037,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",dealing with crucial events in the lives of the subjects. You will find
2038,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","poetry in famous biographies like Moore's _Byron_, Dowden's _Shelley_,"
2039,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Forster's _Dickens_, Cooke's _Ruskin_, Bielschowsky's _Goethe_, Froude's"
2040,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","_Carlyle_, etc., to name just the lives of some literary men."
2041,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2042,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",It is particularly pleasing to find poetry in literary prose criticism.
2043,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","For it was always held that criticism was but a secondary art, rarely"
2044,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","creative in the same sense as poetry, supposed to be a product of the"
2045,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","mind and not the soul, and merely a commentary on poetry. It is true,"
2046,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","formerly poets were often inclined to write their criticism in verse,"
2047,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",thinking that thus it became poetry. But it is only the ecstatic
2048,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","presentation of critical ideas that makes criticism poetry, whether in"
2049,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",prose or verse. Poets have often described the mission of poetry in
2050,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","verse, and given us genuine poems. Horace and Verlaine have done this."
2051,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",But we have had great poetry in the critical work in prose of many
2052,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","critics. You will find poetry in Carlyle, Ruskin, Goethe, Pater,"
2053,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Brandes. You will find it in the prose essays of poets very often in
2054,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",spite of the popular tradition that poets are not good prose writers.
2055,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2056,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",I give two examples. The first is from Swinburne's book on Blake:
2057,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2058,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",To him the veil of outer things seemed always to tremble with
2059,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",some breath behind it; seemed at times to be rent in sunder
2060,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",with clamour and sudden lightning. All the void of earth and
2061,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",air seemed to quiver with the passage of sentient wings and
2062,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",palpitate under the pressure of conscious feet. Flowers and
2063,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","weeds, stars and stones, spoke with articulate lips and gazed"
2064,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",with living eyes. Hands were stretched towards him from beyond
2065,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the darkness of material nature, to tempt or to support, to"
2066,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",guide or to restrain. His hardest facts were the vaguest
2067,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",allegories of other men. To him all symbolic things were
2068,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","literal, all literal things symbolic. About his path and about"
2069,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","his bed, around his ears and under his eyes, an infinite play"
2070,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",of spiritual life seethed and swarmed or shone and sang.
2071,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",Spirits imprisoned in the husk and shell of earth consoled or
2072,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",menaced him. Every leaf bore a growth of angels; the pulse of
2073,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",every minute sounded as the falling foot of God; under the
2074,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","rank raiment of weeds, in the drifting down of thistles,"
2075,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",strange faces frowned and white hair fluttered; tempters and
2076,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","allies, wraiths of the living and phantoms of the dead,"
2077,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","crowded and made populous the winds that blew about him, the"
2078,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",fields and hills over which he gazed.
2079,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2080,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",The second is from James Thomson's essay on Shelley:
2081,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2082,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","The only true or inspired poetry is always from within, not"
2083,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",from without. The experience contained in it has been
2084,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",spiritually transmuted from lead into gold. It is severely
2085,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","logical, the most trivial of its adornments being subservient"
2086,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","to, and suggested by, the dominant idea; any departure from"
2087,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","whose dictates would be the ""falsifying of a revelation."" It"
2088,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","is unadulterated with worldly wisdom, deference to prevailing"
2089,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","opinions, mere talent or cleverness. Its anguish is untainted"
2090,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","by the gall of bitterness, its joy is never selfish, its"
2091,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",grossness is never obscene. It perceives always the profound
2092,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",identity underlying all surface differences. It is a living
2093,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","organism, not a dead aggregate, and its music is the"
2094,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",expression of the law of its growth; so that it could no more
2095,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",be set to a different melody than could a rose-tree be
2096,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",consummated with lilies or violets. It is most philosophic
2097,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","when most enthusiastic, the clearest light of its wisdom being"
2098,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",shed from the keenest fire of its love. It is a synthesis not
2099,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","arithmetical, but algebraical; that is to say, its particular"
2100,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","subjects are universal symbols, its predicates, universal"
2101,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",laws: hence it is infinitely suggestive. It is ever-fresh
2102,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","wonder at the infinite mystery, ever-young faith in the"
2103,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","eternal soul. Whatever be its mood, we feel that it is not"
2104,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",self-possessed but God-possessed; whether the God came down
2105,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","serene and stately as Jove, when, a swan, he wooed Leda; or"
2106,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","with overwhelming might insupportably burning, as when he"
2107,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",consumed Semele.
2108,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2109,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Criticism deals with ideas that relate to life, and when written with"
2110,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",ecstasy on human topics and not on technique it is poetry. The passage
2111,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","in Shelley's _Defense of Poetry_, beginning with the words ""Poetry is"
2112,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the record of the best and happiest moments, etc.,"" as well as the"
2113,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",conclusion of Poe's essay on _The Poetic Principle_ are poetry. The
2114,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","critics here were poets in their prose criticism, no less than in their"
2115,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",rhymed lyrics.
2116,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",
2117,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","As the reader will fathom by this time, my aim is to free poetry from"
2118,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",its bondage to requirements that were thought essential to it. I object
2119,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","most emphatically to demands for rhyme, metre, rhythm, alliteration,"
2120,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","assonance, parallelism, repetition of word or phrase or line, tropes or"
2121,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","figures of speech, poetical diction, and any form of pattern. The poet"
2122,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","has the right to use any of the above instruments as he sees fit,"
2123,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",whenever he thinks they enhance the ecstasy in his work. But no critic
2124,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",has a right to lay down a definition of poetry and insist that metre or
2125,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",rhythm must be employed by a poet. Professor Mackail in his _Oxford
2126,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","Lectures on Poetry_ defines poetry as patterned language, formally and"
2127,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","technically, adding that the technical essence of the pattern is the"
2128,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","repeat, and that when there is no repeat there is technically no poetry."
2129,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","If this definition were true, then passages in the Bible full of poetry,"
2130,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","which use no parallelism, would not be poetry. The pattern does not make"
2131,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","the poem, it often ruins it. While it is true that when excited we"
2132,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","repeat expressions and become rhythmical, we do not do so with"
2133,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","regularity and uniformity. How puerile many poems by savages, and even"
2134,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","by the early civilized Babylonians and Egyptians, sound because the"
2135,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","first impediment of art, the repeat, is employed, and a phrase is"
2136,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",repeated _ad nauseam_ like the words of a child learning how to talk.
2137,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",(!)
2138,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",

2145,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",the scrap heap. But they laid down absurd rules as to how to write
2146,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",poetry and how to determine it; they sought to confine it by rules
2147,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY",gleaned from older poets and insisted future poets obey these rules. Yet
2148,"ECSTASY, NOT RHYTHM, ESSENTIAL TO POETRY","great poets, who never even read them, disregarded all their rules and"

2189,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Hazlitt has ably summed up the influence of the French Revolution on
2190,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Wordsworth. Our poet did away with mythological references, with tales"

2197,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"never asserted that he wanted the poets to use the language of peasants,"
2198,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,except when peasants were portrayed and represented as speaking. He
2199,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"simply protested against stilted, artificial language in verse poetry."
2200,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"He held the use of such language in verse poetry to be ridiculous, as it"
2201,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"was in prose. He was not an exponent of prose poetry, even though he"
2202,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,laid little stress on the importance of metre. As the authors of the
2203,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"article on Wordsworth in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_ state, the"
2204,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,farthest he went in defense of prose structure in poetry was to say that
2205,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"if the words in verse happened to be in the order of prose, they were"
2206,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,not necessarily prosaic in the sense of unpoetic. He did not
2207,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,(unfortunately) try to eliminate metre in poetry. He no doubt agreed
2208,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,with Coleridge's own defense of meter in the _Biographia Literaria_. He
2209,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"did not write against his own theory, for he always employed metre"
2210,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and--except in some ballads--a diction that was even literary.
2211,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2212,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Though both Wordsworth and Coleridge were not overawed by the necessity
2213,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"of metre in poetry, they believed in its use, and were opposed to prose"
2214,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"poetry. Coleridge, however, wrote a prose poem _The Wanderings of Cain_"
2215,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and some of his essays are prose poetry. Coleridge also devoted an
2216,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,entire chapter in his _Biographia Literaria_ to the defense of metre as
2217,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,a vehicle for poetry. He attributes the origin of metre to the fact that
2218,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,the mind makes a conscious effort to hold passion in check by fettering
2219,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"it with regular numbers. On the contrary, this conscious check is due to"
2220,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"imitation of old examples, to fear in defying the critics, for the"
2221,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"natural language of passion is irregular rhythm, and it is impatient of"
2222,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"being confined in regular, artificial numbers. Coleridge thinks the"
2223,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"effect of metre is ""to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of"
2224,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"the general feelings and the attention"" by the continued excitement of"
2225,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,surprise. I submit that metre often distracts the attention from the
2226,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"poem's real object, which is to depict ecstasy. Metre often diverts our"
2227,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,ear to the singsong tone in which the emotions are couched. Instead of
2228,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,adding to the vivacity and susceptibility of the feelings it really
2229,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"makes us suspect that the poet is not sincere, for the man of emotions"
2230,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,expresses them spontaneously and does not trick them out in pattern.
2231,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Next, Coleridge assumes that because of custom, metre must have some"
2232,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,property in common with poetry. This argument cannot stand when we take
2233,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,into consideration the innumerable emotional passages that have been
2234,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"written in prose. A custom is only a passing practice, and free verse"
2235,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,writers have abandoned the custom of writing in metre and in many cases
2236,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"have produced good poetry. Lastly, our critic thinks that every poet is"

2240,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,that there is no unity of harmonious adjustment in an emotional passage

2326,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Poetry is essentially lyrical. There is no such thing as dramatic or

2330,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,certain rules and known as a drama. Similarly the speeches in epic poems

2332,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,for poetry is just an emotional outburst. Andromache's speeches and

2345,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"rules that relate to economy of words, concentration of facts and"
2346,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"strikingness of action, is a performance that has a technique of its"
2347,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,own; the dramatist is a poet only by virtue of the ecstasy he puts in
2348,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,the work. Considered in its primary significance as a performance where
2349,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"action is the chief feature, the drama becomes poetry in those parts"
2350,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,where the action and emotion are concentrated.

2352,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"It is, however, often difficult to extract scenes from the play, as they"

2354,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"there is no such thing as dramatic poetry, for the essence of all poetry"
2355,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,is its lyricism. Dramatic scenes contain the lyric cries of the
2356,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,_dramatis personæ_. Action is but the emotional disturbances of the
2357,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"characters and no longer merely means violent conduct, surprises,"
2358,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"battles, duels, suicides, murders. All great novels have dramatic scenes"
2359,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and they are often as exuberant in poetry as are similar scenes in
2360,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,plays. We no longer regard as tragedies only those plays in verse where
2361,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,a virtuous person of high degree is in a frightful predicament because

2367,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"ecstasy (not merely to farcic laughter), and if it is essentially"
2368,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"lyrical. Comedy also appears in works of fiction in prose, and may be"

2371,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2372,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Tragedy often presents lyric poems greater than any other work of
2373,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,literature; hence Aristotle and his imitators concluded that a verse
2374,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,tragedy was the highest form of poetry. This is not so. If Shakespeare

2379,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Our great poets do not owe their greatness to the use of the

2423,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,It took the Greeks and Romans some time to learn that prose was the best

2428,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,In the first century A.D. various Roman historians wrote of historical
2429,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,events in the form of epic poems. These are really histories with a
2430,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"little occasional glimmer of poetry. Thus we had Silius's _Pontica_,"

2432,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,_Pharsalia_. The last two works were especially admired in the medieval
2433,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"ages when rhymed or metrical historical chronicles were the fashion, and"
2434,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,they were favorites of Dante. Very few people to-day read these metrical

2436,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"histories, geographies, criticisms, scientific works, essays, etc. But"
2437,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"no one reads Warner's _Albion's England_, Drayton's _Poly Olbion_, or"
2438,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Daniel's _First Four Books of the Civil War_. And Darwin's versified

2441,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,It is remarkable how past usages in literature influence us. The

2443,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and that of Horace writing literary criticism in verse in his _Art of

2446,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"written in prose, and they would have lost none of their poetic"

2451,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"The French have perfected the art of poetical prose,[86:A] or prose"
2452,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"poetry, probably more than any other nation. The reason may be that they"
2453,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"have not been prolific of good poetry in verse, and have instead"
2454,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"reserved their poetry for prose, a more natural medium than Alexandrine"

2456,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2457,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Fénelon was one of the first moderns who attacked verse. In two critical
2458,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"works, _Dialogues on Eloquence_ and _Letters to the French Academy_"
2459,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"(there is an English translation of both, out of print), he emphasized"
2460,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,the insignificant part played by versification in poetry. He held that
2461,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"there was no true eloquence without a due mixture of poetry, that poetry"
2462,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,was the very soul of eloquence. He said that there were many poets who
2463,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"were poetical without making verses, and he considered versification"
2464,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,distinct from poetry. In his definition of poetry he excluded a
2465,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,consideration of versification. He thought the perfection of French
2466,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"verse impossible, that versification loses more than it gains by rhyme,"
2467,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and that French poets were cramped by versification. He wanted
2468,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,superfluous ornaments removed and the necessary parts turned into
2469,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,natural ornaments. Still he did not insist on a complete abandonment of
2470,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"rhyme, but wanted greater freedom. His biographer, St. Cyr, says that"
2471,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Fénelon wanted to abolish verse altogether in French poetry. Fénelon
2472,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"also wrote a novel in prose poetry in 1699, _Télémaque_. But prose"
2473,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"poetry existed in France before him, in old romances like the story of"
2474,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,_Aucassin and Nicolette_ and in Bossuet's funeral orations. His example
2475,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"was followed by Sainte Pierre, in _Paul and Virginia_, by Prévost in"
2476,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"_Manon Lescaut_, by Rousseau and especially by Chateaubriand in _Atala_,"
2477,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"_The Genius of Christianity_ and _The Martyrs_. Unfortunately, Fénelon"
2478,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,insisted in introducing the clichés of verse into prose; artificial and
2479,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,unnatural language hence ruined some of his work and assisted in
2480,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,bringing the term prose poetry into contempt.
2481,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2482,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,The French have always regarded the poet in a broader sense than have
2483,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,the English. The article on poetry in the French Encyclopedia deals with
2484,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,prose poems as well as with verse poems. Victor Hugo in his
2485,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"_Shakespeare_, when he calls the lists of poets, mentions prose writers"
2486,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"like Diderot, Rousseau, Balzac, Chateaubriand, George Sand, Le Sage and"
2487,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Cervantes. He who was himself a great poet knew that poetry did not
2488,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,depend on metre.
2489,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2490,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Eugene Véron, the great French critic, author of a valuable work on"
2491,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"_Æsthetics_ (fortunately translated into English), also takes a broad"
2492,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,conception of the term poetry. He says that it would be absurd to deny
2493,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Molière's _L'Avare_ is poetry because it is in prose, for poetical,"
2494,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,creative imagination and personal emotions are at work here. He states
2495,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,that there was poetry in the story of Don Juan before Corneille put it
2496,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"in verse. Versification, he urges, does not constitute poetry. He sees"
2497,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,that verse would not have improved such prose poems as _Paul and
2498,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Virginia_, _La Mare au Diable_, or _L'Oiseau_ (Michelet), and he places"
2499,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"in the front rank of poetry passages from Demosthenes, Cicero, Bossuet"
2500,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,(no doubt referring to some of the famous funeral orations) and
2501,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Mirabeau. He also says it is impossible to refuse to see poetic
2502,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"character in the novel, for this deals with the creation of character"
2503,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and the portrayal of passions.

2505,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"I do not wish to go into the prose poetry written by other nations, for"

2515,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,John Stuart Mill and Lord Beaconsfield both recognized the utterly

2521,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"and by another definition from Blackwood's, that poetry is ""man's"

2533,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"An idea emotionally treated becomes poetry whether in prose or verse,"

2541,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Prose poetry was consciously written by Lord Beaconsfield, who tells us"

2634,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"prose, but in its poetry, i. e., in verse. The greatness of English"
2635,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"genius _is_ in its poetry, but in the poetry of its prose as well as in"
2636,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,the poetry of its verse. It appears in the ordinary dialect of its

2639,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"As a matter of fact, poetic prose has always been used. It is found in"
2640,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"the earliest as well as the later literature of every nation. The Bible,"
2641,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Oriental Literature, the medieval romances, early Saxon prose are full"
2642,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,of it. It made a reappearance with renewed force in the romantic
2643,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"movement that spread over England, Germany and France in the latter part"
2644,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries. In an age
2645,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"like the romantic, when the right to live and express emotions was"
2646,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"pleaded, poetic prose, seeking restraint from metre, was especially"
2647,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,appropriate. George Brandes has studied this movement in his _Main
2648,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Currents_. Many of the leading writers of the romantic period used
2649,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,impassioned prose. Saintsbury has found much poetry even in the prose of
2650,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"John Wilson, who is not much read, one who was to some extent an enemy"
2651,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"of the romantic movement, and Saintsbury reprints in his _Specimens of"

2653,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2654,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,America has contributed greatly to the development of prose poetry.
2655,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Hawthorne, Poe and Emerson were the first great masters in prose poetry"
2656,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"we have had, and I doubt if as poets they have been surpassed by any of"
2657,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,our metrical verse writers. One of the finest poems in American
2658,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,literature is undoubtedly Hawthorne's reflections of his lonely life in
2659,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"the Ivory Tower, when he revisited his old chamber in Salem where he"
2660,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"spent so many years. The famous passage from his diary, quoted in all"
2661,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"big biographies, is as great a poem, though in prose."
2662,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2663,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Emerson's essays are studied with prose poems. I shall mention only one,"

2666,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,The Hawthorne passage is as follows:
2667,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2668,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"Salem, Oct. 4th. Union Street (Family Mansion).--. . . . Here"
2669,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"I sit in my old accustomed chamber, where I used to sit in"
2670,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"days gone by. . . . Here I have written many tales,--many that"
2671,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"have been burned to ashes, many that doubtless deserved the"
2672,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"same fate. This claims to be called a haunted chamber, for"
2673,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,thousands upon thousands of visions have appeared to me in it;
2674,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and some few of them have become visible to the world. If ever
2675,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"I should have a biographer, he ought to make great mention of"
2676,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"this chamber in my memoirs, because so much of my lonely youth"
2677,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"was wasted here, and here my mind and character were formed;"
2678,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"and here I have been glad and hopeful, and here I have been"
2679,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"despondent. And here I sat a long, long time, waiting patiently"
2680,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"for the world to know me, and sometimes wondering why it did"
2681,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"not know me sooner, or whether it would ever know me at"
2682,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"all,--at least, till I were in my grave. And sometimes it"
2683,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"seemed as if I were already in the grave, with only life"
2684,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"enough to be chilled and benumbed. But oftener I was happy,--at"
2685,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"least, as happy as I then knew how to be, or was aware of the"
2686,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"possibility of being. By and by, the world found me out in my"
2687,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"lonely chamber, and called me forth,--not, indeed, with a loud"
2688,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"roar of acclamation, but rather with a still, small voice,--and"
2689,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"forth I went, but found nothing in the world that I thought"
2690,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,preferable to my old solitude till now. . . . And now I begin
2691,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,to understand why I was imprisoned so many years in this
2692,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"lonely chamber, and why I could never break through the"
2693,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,viewless bolts and bars; for if I had sooner made my escape
2694,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"into the world, I should have grown hard and rough, and been"
2695,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"covered with earthly dust, and my heart might have become"
2696,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,callous by rude encounters with the multitude. . . . But
2697,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"living in solitude till the fulness of time was come, I still"
2698,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,kept the dew of my youth and the freshness of my heart. . . .
2699,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"I used to think I could imagine all passions, all feelings,"
2700,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and states of the heart and mind; but how little did I know!
2701,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,". . . Indeed, we are but shadows; we are not endowed with"
2702,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"real life, and all that seems most real about us is but the"
2703,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"thinnest substance of a dream,--till the heart be touched."
2704,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"That touch creates us,--then we begin to be,--thereby we are"

2707,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,And the Emerson poem in prose is given herewith:
2708,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,
2709,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"O poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures,"
2710,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and not in castles or by the sword-blade any longer. The
2711,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"conditions are hard, but equal. Thou shalt leave the world,"
2712,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and know the muse only. Thou shalt not know any longer the
2713,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"times, customs, graces, politics, or opinions of men, but"
2714,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,shalt take all from the muse. For the time of towns is tolled
2715,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"from the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the universal"
2716,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants,"
2717,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,and by growth of joy on joy. God wills also that thou abdicate
2718,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"a manifold and duplex life, and that thou be content that"
2719,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"others speak for thee. Others shall be thy gentlemen, and"
2720,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee; others
2721,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,shall do the great and resounding actions also. Thou shalt lie
2722,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"close hid with nature, and canst not be afforded to the"
2723,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,Capitol or the Exchange. The world is full of renunciations
2724,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"and apprenticeships, and this is thine; thou must pass for a"
2725,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,fool and a churl for a long season. This is the screen and
2726,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"sheath in which Pan has protected his well-beloved flower, and"
2727,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"thou shalt be known only to thine own, and they shall console"
2728,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,thee with tenderest love. And thou shalt not be able to
2729,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"rehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse, for an old"
2730,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,shame before the holy ideal. And this is the reward; that the
2731,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"ideal shall be real to thee, and the impressions of the actual"
2732,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"world shall fall like summer rain, copious, but not"
2733,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,troublesome to thy invulnerable essence. Thou shalt have the
2734,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"sole land for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath and"
2735,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"navigation, without tax and without envy; the woods and the"
2736,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"rivers thou shalt own, and thou shalt possess that wherein"
2737,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,others are only tenants and boarders. Thou true land-lord!
2738,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,sea-lord! air-lord! Wherever snow falls or water flows or
2739,PROSE THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE LITERATURE OF ECSTASY,"birds fly, wherever day and night meet in twilight, wherever"

2763,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2764,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,One of the frequent sayings in the text books of literary history is
2765,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"that the literature of a nation always begins with poetry in verse, and"
2766,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,that good prose is a later development. England and Greece are
2767,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"especially cited as examples, since Homer lived before Herodotus and the"
2768,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,author of _Beowulf_ before King Alfred.
2769,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2770,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Scholars follow one another often like sheep. When a man of prominence
2771,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"utters an idea, it is taken up by a disciple and soon becomes a"
2772,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,convention. The academic critics and professors usually enshrine the
2773,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,idea and it becomes a heresy to question it. The best illustration of
2774,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,this is the almost universal adherence given to the idea that verse
2775,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"poetry came before prose, a view first set forth by the geographer"
2776,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Strabo in speaking of Homer in the beginning of his _Geography_. His
2777,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"views were not entertained, I believe, by Plato or Aristotle. The"
2778,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,passage is worth quoting as I know of no other in literature that has
2779,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,raised so much confusion and misapprehension as to the nature of poetry:
2780,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2781,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Prose discourse--I mean artistic prose--is, I may say, an"
2782,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,imitation of poetic discourse; for poetry as an art first came
2783,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,upon the scene and was first to win approval. Then came
2784,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Cadmus, Pherecydes, Hecataeus and their followers, with prose"
2785,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"writing in which they imitated the poetic art, abandoning the"
2786,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"use of metre, but in other respects preserving the qualities"
2787,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"of poetry. Then subsequent writers took away, each in his"
2788,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"turn, something of these qualities, and brought prose down to"
2789,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"its present form, as from a sublime height. In the same way we"
2790,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"might say that comedy took its structure from tragedy, but"
2791,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,that it also has been degraded from the sublime height of
2792,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"tragedy to its present ""prose-like"" style, as it is called."
2793,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"_Geography_, 1. 2. 6."
2794,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2795,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Most critics have accepted this view. Scaliger, however, in the middle"
2796,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of the sixteenth century repudiated it. He asked whether the first
2797,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"so-called poems, the metrical records in temples, antedated everyday"
2798,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,speech.
2799,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2800,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Strabo was led to his error by the fact that the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_
2801,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,were among the very few survivals of the end of an epoch of verse
2802,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"poetry, and also because some of the pre-Socratic philosophers like"
2803,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Parmenides and Empedocles wrote in verse. Now scholars are all agreed
2804,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,that the authors of the Homeric poems had many predecessors in the art
2805,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of composing poetry for many ages back down into legendary times. The
2806,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,perfected poems in a pattern as regular as the dactylic hexameter were a
2807,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,stage of evolution and did not spring up out of the darkness of an age
2808,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,which had no literature. The Delphians claim that their first priestess
2809,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"invented the dactylic hexameter; the Delians said that Olen, a mythical"
2810,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"singer from Asia Minor, first used it, but it was, of course, a"
2811,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"development. Prose was not a development from verse, as Strabo thought."
2812,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"On the contrary, all verse, including Greek verse, was a development"
2813,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,from rhythmical prose. The stories about Troy were first told in prose;
2814,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,next they were sung in ballads; then they were combined into epics.
2815,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2816,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Musæus, one of the earliest legendary poets, antedating Homer, was said"
2817,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,to have composed prose.
2818,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2819,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,As the earliest literatures of most nations have not been preserved to
2820,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"us, we can examine various literatures in their earliest stages only; we"
2821,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,shall in almost every case find that these are written in rhythmical
2822,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,prose or possess the beginning of a pattern hardly differing from
2823,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,rhythmic prose. It is against all human experience to conclude that an
2824,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,elaborate work of art following laws of measure could precede the
2825,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,production in prose that represents the transcription of the natural
2826,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"language of people which is in prose. We shall discover, however, that"
2827,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"in some cases, like the _Sagas_ of Iceland, we have in prose, the very"
2828,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"first poetical compositions, while other poetical compositions, like the"
2829,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"epics of Ireland, show us the prose along with the metrical development"
2830,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,in the body of the compositions.
2831,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2832,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,First let us briefly note the characteristics of the poetry of natural
2833,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"savages. This is always in rhythmical prose, or free verse, and this may"
2834,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,be seen in the anthology of Indian poems collected by Cronyn in _The
2835,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Path of the Rainbow_. The writer of the preface, Mary Austin, ventures"
2836,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the opinion that the writers of free verse poems in America are merely
2837,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,returning to the primitive form of poetry written by the native
2838,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Americans. Similarly the emotional outbursts of native African tribes
2839,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,are in rhythmical prose. The only form of pattern in the poems of
2840,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,savages as well as of people in an early stage of civilization is a
2841,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"tendency to repeat the same phrase. But in their most emotional stories,"
2842,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"fables and legends, in their proverbs and crude moral and religious"
2843,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"philosophizing they use plain prose. This prose, especially that of the"
2844,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"legends, contains their first poetry, and of course there is no pattern"
2845,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"here. The pattern, assuming the form of irregular rhythm and repetition"
2846,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"of phrase, appears chiefly in hymns and chants, and these are only two"
2847,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,aspects of poetry.
2848,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2849,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The first change that occurs in a later stage of the hymn is that the
2850,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"phrase or clause, instead of being repeated exactly, is varied by a"
2851,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"change of words, having a similar import. In short, we have the"
2852,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,beginning of parallelism. There is parallelism in the poems of all
2853,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,early civilizations. It reaches its fullest development in an age of
2854,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"civilization, as we observe in the poems of the Bible."
2855,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2856,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Probably the oldest poetry we have is that of the Egyptians and the
2857,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Babylonians, and there is no regular metre of any kind in these except"
2858,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,parallelism. The works are all irregularly rhythmical and in many cases
2859,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the lines are arranged like modern free verse, to call attention to this"
2860,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,irregular rhythm.
2861,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2862,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Dr. James H. Breasted, speaking of the Pyramid Texts, in his _Religion"
2863,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"and Thought in Ancient Egypt_, says: ""Among the oldest literary"
2864,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,fragments in the collection are the religious hymns and these exhibit an
2865,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"early poetic form, that of couplets displaying parallelism in"
2866,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"arrangement of word, and thought--the form which is familiar to all in"
2867,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the Hebrew Psalms as 'parallelism of members.' It is carried back by its
2868,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"employment in the Pyramid Texts in the fourth millennium B.C., by far"
2869,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,earlier than its appearance anywhere else. It is indeed the oldest of
2870,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,all literary forms known to us. Its use is not confined to the hymns
2871,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"mentioned, but appears also in other portions of the Pyramid Texts,"
2872,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"where it is, however, not usually so highly developed."""
2873,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2874,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"All the poems of the Egyptians were written simply in rough, irregular"
2875,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,lines of rhythmical prose. Read the famous _Song of the Harper_ where an
2876,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,epicurean life is praised; it is impassioned rhythmical prose. Take up
2877,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the love poems, elegies, fairy tales and prayers of the ancient"
2878,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Egyptians. They have no device of metre, rhythm or rhyme. The only"
2879,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,pattern is the parallelism. A few hymns are arranged in stanzas of ten
2880,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"lines with a break in the middle of each line, but no definite metrical"
2881,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"laws existed for the lengths of lines or number of feet, so as to make a"
2882,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,uniform rhythmical pattern of the composition.
2883,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2884,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The Egyptians wrote much of their poetry in parallelistic prose. If we
2885,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"do not know how they pronounced their vowels, we know enough of their"
2886,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,literature to see that regularity of accents and equal numbers of
2887,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,syllables were not characteristic of their poetry.
2888,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2889,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The epic of _Gilgash_, the chief poem of the Babylonians, and the"
2890,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"various hymns translated by Professor Langdon, are all in irregular"
2891,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"rhythmical prose. These may be older than the poetry of the Egyptians,"
2892,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,but in form they are a great deal alike--simply prose with a rough
2893,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"rhythm, frequent parallelism, but no uniform device. The lines are"
2894,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"arranged often like free verse. ""It is difficult to draw the line"
2895,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"between their poetry and the higher style of prose,"" says Francis"
2896,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Brown.[100:A] ""There is a primitive freedom and lack of artificiality in"
2897,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the poetic movement, much greater than in the Hebrew Psalms. Metre is"
2898,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"felt and observed at times, but then abandoned--the thought carrying"
2899,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"itself along beyond the strict boundaries of metrical division."""
2900,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2901,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,We have seen that critics find in the hymns of the Egyptians and
2902,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Babylonians the irregular rhythm and parallelisms of the Psalms, in"
2903,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"short, impassioned rhythmical prose."
2904,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2905,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Let us now examine the form of the poetry of the Bible.
2906,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,

2908,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Testament,"" posthumously collected in _Lectures and Essays_, showed that"

2911,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"measured rise and fall of feeling and utterance, to which the rhythm of"
2912,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"sound is subordinate. Prosodic rules are not necessary, ""for the words"

2916,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"attribute importance to metre and finally ""we are apt to forget its"
2917,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"essential subordination to rhythmic flow of thought."""
2918,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2919,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,There has been no more amusing game than the ever-renewed attempt to
2920,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"find metres in the Bible. One of the most ridiculous claims, at one time"
2921,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"widely in vogue, was that the Greek metres were to be found in the"
2922,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Bible. Vossius and the younger Scaliger denounced these views, first"
2923,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,advanced by Josephus and Philo.
2924,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2925,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,We are beginning to see to-day that the chief characteristic of the form
2926,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of the poetry in the Bible is parallelism in irregular rhythm.
2927,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2928,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Dr. König and other scholars agree that it is this irregular rhythm
2929,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,based on accent of syllable that distinguishes Hebrew poetry. Each line
2930,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"had a number of accented syllables ranging from two to five, but the"
2931,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,lines did not regularly or alternately have the same number of accented
2932,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,syllables. The unaccented syllables were also not counted. The poem
2933,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"became nothing more than rhythmical prose. Sir George A. Smith says, in"
2934,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"his _The Early Poetry of Israel_, that the Hebrew poets indulged"
2935,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,deliberately in the metrical irregularities of verse. They deviated more
2936,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"than Shakespeare, who did not always confine himself to the iambic foot"
2937,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"and pentameter line in his blank verse. ""In every form of Oriental art"
2938,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"we trace the influence of what may be called Symmetrophobia, an"
2939,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"instinctive aversion to absolute symmetry, which if it knows no better,"
2940,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,will express itself in arbitrary and even violent disturbances of the
2941,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"style or pattern of the work."" The more correct view, however, is that"
2942,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,this symmetry was never intended by the Hebrew poets; that the
2943,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,irregular arrangement of accents with occasional symmetry was the rule.
2944,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2945,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Both Smith and König cite G. Dalman, who says that this irregular rhythm"
2946,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,is found in the songs of Arabia to-day sung in Palestine. These songs
2947,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"are made up of lines of from two to five syllables, of which one to four"
2948,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"are unaccented, the poet being bound by no definite numbers. This is the"
2949,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"irregular rhythm of Hebrew poetry, and also, by the way, of the"
2950,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"_Nibelungen Lied_. It is the rhythm of all early poetry, the Egyptian"
2951,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,and Babylonian.
2952,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2953,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,But even those who have given up the hope of finding metres in Hebrew
2954,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,poetry insist that a regular metrical form was used for the Kinoth or
2955,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,lamentations. Professor Budde held that the Kinoth had a regular metre.
2956,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,But the discovery merely amounted to this: that a long line was followed
2957,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,regularly by a short line. There was no uniformity of accented syllables
2958,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"in successive or alternate lines. There are two, three and four"
2959,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,syllables in them almost at the will of the poet.
2960,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2961,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,We may then conclude that rhythm is never regular in the poetry of the
2962,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Bible.
2963,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2964,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"All ancient Hebrew poetry was in rhythmical prose; prophecies, elegies,"
2965,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"songs, hymns, parables, and dialogues. The irregular rhythmical form was"
2966,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,a natural outflow of the ecstatic element.
2967,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2968,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,But what about the parallelism? Does this make the Bible verse? Bishop
2969,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Lowth, in his _Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews_, delivered"
2970,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"at Oxford in the middle of the eighteenth century, no doubt performed"
2971,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,great service in calling attention to the parallelisms of Hebrew poetry.
2972,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The importance of these in ancient Hebrew poetry has, however, been"
2973,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"overestimated. Parallelism did not create poetry, but was often its"
2974,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"garment. There are passages employing parallelisms that are not poetry,"
2975,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"while many poems exist in which these are not used. Dr. Edward König, in"
2976,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"his article on Hebrew Poetry in the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, concludes"
2977,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"that the poets of the Bible were not bound by parallelism, often setting"
2978,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,it aside and not using it.
2979,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2980,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"In his account of _The Literary Study of the Bible_, Professor Richard"
2981,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"G. Moulton has given an excellent study of the parallelism of the Bible,"
2982,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,but he admits that parallelisms of clause are also prose devices. If
2983,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"parallelism, then, is also a property of prose, we cannot say that"
2984,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"parallelism alone is sufficient to distinguish poetry from prose, or"
2985,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,even Hebrew poetry from Hebrew prose. Moulton finds that prose and
2986,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,poetry overlap each other in the Bible. All this merely proves that
2987,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,parallelisms were no doubt anciently used to differentiate prose
2988,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,literature conveying emotions from prose literature barren of feeling.
2989,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,But parallelism was not indispensable to the literature of ecstasy.
2990,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
2991,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Yet we cannot deny the fact that parallelisms occur in the Bible with
2992,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,such frequency as almost to have become a pattern of Hebrew poetry.
2993,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Bishop Lowth thought the origin of the parallelism was due to the system
2994,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"of chanting hymns where there was a response by the congregation, and"
2995,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"that the practice of the parallelism soon extended to all poetry. But,"
2996,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"for example, proverbs from their very epigrammatic nature tend towards"
2997,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,parallelism. The origin was most likely due to the variations of phrase
2998,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"introduced by individuals who tired of the incessant, silly repetition"
2999,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of similar words such as are indulged in by savages.
3000,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3001,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"There is parallelism in all poetry, in _Beowulf_ and the _Kalevala_, and"
3002,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,even in prose. For it must be admitted that under emotion a man tends to
3003,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"repeat an idea, in the same or in a synonymous language."
3004,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3005,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,There can be no doubt that parallelism was consciously and deliberately
3006,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"indulged in by the Hebrew poets, but it is as absurd to confuse it with"
3007,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Hebrew poetry as to confuse metre with English poetry. There are
3008,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,poetical passages in the Bible containing no parallelisms. It should
3009,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,also be borne in mind that parallelism developed as a perfect pattern
3010,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,when poetry was at a high stage. Like all patterns it was a product of a
3011,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"type of civilization. No rude state of society can develop a pattern,"
3012,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,which is the result of evolution.
3013,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3014,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Parallelism is not used frequently to-day as a pattern of verse, though"
3015,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,it can be found in all modern literature. Yet it is a more natural means
3016,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of expressing one's emotions than rhyme or metre.
3017,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3018,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The only pattern of importance, then, that appears extensively in the"
3019,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Bible is that of parallelism. There is no pattern of rhythm at all, for"
3020,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,this is free. The result is that the poetry of the Bible is in what may
3021,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"be called prose, for the repetition of the idea and language in the"
3022,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,parallelism is natural even in prose. Parallelism in the Bible did not
3023,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"create a distinct branch of literature called verse, as metre did. Those"
3024,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Psalms that have parallelism are very little different from those Psalms
3025,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,where it is absent. They are both really prose.
3026,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3027,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,It was unfortunate that Hebrew poetry later eschewed the rhythmic prose
3028,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,used in the Bible and adopted first rhymed prose and then rhymed metre.
3029,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,There were several circumstances that led to this.
3030,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3031,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,It has been usually recognized that rhymed prose was first used among
3032,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the Hebrews in the Liturgy by Jannai, who flourished in the seventh"
3033,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,century. Metre was introduced in the tenth century by Dunash ben Labrat.
3034,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Both these poets followed Arabic models. Saadyah, the Hebrew"
3035,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"philosopher, blamed Dunash for having ruined the beauty and naturalness"
3036,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"of the Hebrew language for poetry. Even Jehudah HaLevi, the great"
3037,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"national poet who used Arabic meters, regretted, in his philosophical"
3038,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"work, _Hacuzari_,[105:A] that these foreign Arabian influences should"
3039,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,prevail among the Hebrew poets.
3040,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3041,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The oldest Arab poetry was also in prose. The earliest pattern for
3042,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"poetry among the Arabians was the Saj (cooing), or rhymed but unmetrical"
3043,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,prose. Goldziher calls the Saj the oldest form of poetic speech; it
3044,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"continued to exist even after the regular metres were established, the"
3045,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Koran, for instance, being in Saj. At first it was unrhymed, as"
3046,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Goldziher says; the earliest Arabic poetry was in unmetrical prose.
3047,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3048,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"From Saj arose Rajaz (trembling), which is partly metrical, and forms"
3049,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the transition to the artificial Arabic meters.
3050,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3051,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The earliest surviving Arabic poetry, the seven poems of the"
3052,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"_Muallaqat_, composed before Mohammed, are so perfect in form that all"
3053,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Arabic scholars assume they were produced after a long period extending
3054,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"through many years of poetic practice. They were not rude products, but"
3055,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"had an historical background, as did the _Iliad_. They are written in"
3056,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"perfected and complicated metres, but the Saj is older than these."
3057,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3058,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,We have two other proofs that poetry was in early times written in
3059,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"rhythmical prose, or at least in a rhythm that makes only a slight"
3060,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,approach to metre. These are to be found in two of the oldest Aryan
3061,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"literary monuments extant, the _Rigveda_ of India and the _Avesta_ of"
3062,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Iran.
3063,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3064,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Two-fifths of the hymns of the _Rigveda_ are composed in a metre called
3065,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"trishtubh, the most frequent measure in the _Veda_. It is made up of"
3066,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"stanzas of four lines, each of eleven syllables, the last four of which"
3067,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"only have to follow a pattern, this consisting of two iambuses or an"
3068,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,iambus and a spondee. This requirement left a good deal of liberty to
3069,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the poet. Here is an example of it, in the _Hymn to Dawn_, in"
3070,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,MacDonnels' _Sanskrit Literature_ (P. 83):
3071,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3072,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Arise! the breath, the life again has reached us:"
3073,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Darkness has gone away and light is coming.
3074,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,She leaves a pathway for the sun to travel:
3075,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,We have arrived where men prolong existence.
3076,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3077,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Max Müller in his translation in prose has adhered in many cases to the
3078,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"original metre, and the reader feels he is reading prose. The Hindus,"
3079,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"like the free verse writers, merely arranged their lines to call"
3080,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"attention to the rhythm, but it was really prose employing metrical"
3081,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,rules only at the end of the line. It has none of the hampering
3082,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"qualities of classic or English metres, or of the metres in the later"
3083,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Indian epics when the quantity of every syllable was determined.
3084,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3085,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The _Rigvedas_ are fixed by some scholars at 1500 B.C.
3086,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3087,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,When we come to the _Avesta_ of the Iranians who left India and wrote
3088,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"their work in a language that is almost Sanskrit, we find more liberty"
3089,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"as regards the metres. The _Gathas_, which are said to be the oldest"
3090,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"portions of the work, the work of Zoroaster himself, have the same or"
3091,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"nearly the same kind of metre as the Vedic hymns, but there is greater"
3092,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,liberty. The syllables need not be of a uniform quantity at the end of
3093,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"the line, but each line, as in the _Rigvedas_, also has the same number"
3094,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,of syllables. The third of the five _Gathas_ uses the trishtubh or most
3095,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"frequent metre of the _Veda_, four lines of eleven syllables, but"
3096,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,without restrictions as to quantity of final vowels.
3097,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3098,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Of course the reader can see that such verse is really prose, for there"
3099,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,are no limitations as to when accent or quantity should uniformly be
3100,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"used. L. H. Mills in his translation of the _Gathas_ keeps close, as he"
3101,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"tells us, to the original metres. He wisely breaks up the metrical line,"
3102,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"based merely on the counting of syllables, and the result reads like"
3103,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"prose, which it really is in the original."
3104,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3105,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"A study of the five ""metres"" of the five _Gathas_ appears in Martin"
3106,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Haug's _Essays in the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the"
3107,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Parsis_.
3108,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3109,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The _Gathas_ were written about the fourteenth century B.C. by Zoroaster
3110,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,and hence are not much later than the _Rigvedas_.
3111,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3112,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,In the _Rigvedas_ and _Gathas_ we have the first stage of metre used by
3113,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Aryan nations; these are the basis of all later metres. They were
3114,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"written, it must be recalled, not in ages of barbarism, and represent"
3115,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the transition from prose to regular metre. They are so near prose that
3116,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"only an arrangement into lines makes us call them metrical. After all,"
3117,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,they do not differ much from the rhythmical prose in which the poetry of
3118,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Ancient Egyptians, Babylonians and Hebrews was written. We see thus that"
3119,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"rhythmical prose was the first language wherein poetry was written, and"
3120,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,that hampering metre is always late in the literary development of a
3121,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,nation. We learn how great is the delusion of literary historians that
3122,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,metrical poetry is the first literature of all nations and that prose is
3123,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,a later growth.
3124,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3125,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,The earliest poetry of a country is expressed first in prose by word of
3126,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"mouth. It is then put down first in writing in prose, and later versions"
3127,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,sometimes change the prose into meter. Often the earlier prose version
3128,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,is lost and it is then concluded that a literature of a nation begins in
3129,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,verse.
3130,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3131,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Let us examine the form of the earliest Irish literature. The oldest
3132,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"stories in Irish literature center around the exploits of Cuchulinn, who"
3133,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,is reputed to have died at the beginning of the Christian era. This
3134,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,means that the tale about him was told by word of mouth up till the time
3135,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,they were written down in the seventh or eighth century. The versions of
3136,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,a few centuries later are the copies we now have in the epic _Táin Bó
3137,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Cualnge_. According to Edmund C. Quiggin's article on Irish Literature
3138,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"in the _Britannica_, the original Tain consisted of prose interspersed"
3139,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,with rhythmical prose called rhetoric. Later metrical poems were largely
3140,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"substituted for the rhetoric. As Mr. Quiggin says, the Tain is of"
3141,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,interest as showing the preliminary stage through which the epics of all
3142,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,other nations had gone. No doubt even the _Iliad_ was originally told in
3143,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,prose (and probably written in prose) while the verse versions are the
3144,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,latest we have of the story.
3145,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3146,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Eleanor Hull, in _A Text Book of Irish Literature_, also says in Vol. 1,"
3147,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"p. 95, that there are few verse poems in the earlier _Táin Bó Cualnge_,"
3148,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,most of the poetry being usually in declamatory prose style known as
3149,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"rosg, while in the later version long verse poems are frequent."
3150,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3151,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The earliest Teutonic verse was rather rhythmical prose, with some"
3152,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,alliteration. It is often hard to distinguish Anglo-Saxon prose from
3153,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Anglo-Saxon verse. Ælfric, who is regarded by many as one of the fathers"
3154,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"of English prose, wrote his _Lives of the Saints_ in rhythmical prose,"
3155,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,arranged in irregular lines just like our modern free verse. The reader
3156,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"may consult Professor Skeat's edition. This arrangement, needless to"
3157,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"say, did not make poetry of it. But free verse, as we see, was written"
3158,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,in England in 1000 A.D.
3159,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3160,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Dr. Edwin Guest, in his _History of English Rhythms_, says that the"
3161,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Anglo-Saxon writers sometimes gave a very definite rhythm to their
3162,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"prose, and he cites a few passages characterizing King William, from the"
3163,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Chronicle attributed to Wulfstan in the latter part of the eleventh
3164,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,century. Dr. Guest adds that in his opinion this rhythmical prose was
3165,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,one of the instruments in breaking up the alliterative system of the
3166,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Anglo-Saxons. The passage he cites, however, is no more rhythmical than"
3167,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"many passages in modern English prose. Anglo-Saxon prose, then, often"
3168,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"was rhythmical, and even arranged like free verse, but it became"
3169,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,genuine poetry only when the element of ecstasy was present. Even the
3170,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"middle-English impassioned alliterative prose poem, _The Wooing of Our"
3171,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Lord_, of the thirteenth century, does not differ much from Anglo-Saxon"
3172,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,verse.
3173,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3174,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The earliest Teutonic poetry was emotional prose, and only later did"
3175,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"definite rules bind it. The author of _Beowulf_, though the first"
3176,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"English verse poet, is not the oldest Teutonic poet; he had predecessors"
3177,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"in rhythmic prose. ""When we consider primitive Teutonic verse closely,"""
3178,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"says Gosse in his article in the _Britannica_ on Verse, ""we see that it"
3179,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"did not begin with any conscious art, but as Vigfussen had said, 'was"
3180,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,simply excited and emphatic prose' uttered with the repetition of catch
3181,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"words and letters. The use of these was presently regulated."" English"
3182,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"poetry, then, began in the use of excited and emphatic prose. One of the"
3183,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,best pieces of Anglo-Saxon prose poetry is the _Sermon to the English_
3184,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,on the ravages of the Dane by Archbishop Wulfstan of York in the early
3185,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,part of the eleventh century. It reads like Anglo-Saxon verse. One sees
3186,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the unconscious influence of Anglo-Saxon prose poetry as late as
3187,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Drummond's _The Cypress Grove_ (1623), an ecstatic prose poem against"
3188,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,death.
3189,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3190,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"The fact that the _Sagas_, the earliest literature of Iceland, were"
3191,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,written in perfect prose has puzzled those who claim that the early
3192,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"literature of all nations is verse poetry, and that prose is a later"
3193,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,development. The events which the _Sagas_ celebrate took place in the
3194,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"tenth century, and the following century was the period of their"
3195,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,narration. They were written down in the present form chiefly in the
3196,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,thirteenth century. Ari Frodi (1067-1148) is considered by many the
3197,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,first inventor of classic Norse prose. The most famous of the _Greater
3198,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Sagas_ is the _Njala_ written about the middle of the thirteenth century
3199,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,and celebrating events of the beginning of the eleventh century.
3200,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3201,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"Earlier Icelandic verse poetry did exist, but it does not belong to"
3202,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,Iceland proper. The great strength of real Iceland poetry was in the
3203,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"_Sagas_, which Morris calls ""unversified poetry."" Some of these existed"
3204,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,as early as the first part of the tenth century. It seems anomalous to
3205,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,the literary historian that a nation should at the very beginning of its
3206,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"literary history have developed prose before verse, that it should have"
3207,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,celebrated its heroes in prose instead of verse song. All stories among
3208,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"ancient people were, however, originally told in prose; the first"
3209,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,expression was always in rhythmical poetical prose.
3210,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,
3211,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"It is not true, then, that verse is the first form in which a nation's"
3212,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"poetry is written, or that prose developed from verse. Prose was the"
3213,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,"original language of poetry, and to prose it should return. The pattern"
3214,PROSE PRECEDES VERSE HISTORICALLY,was a gradual development.

3231,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3232,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The unrhymed iambic pentameter known as blank verse is really a form of
3233,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,free verse; it is a modified form of the unrhymed classical measure. It
3234,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"made its appearance in Italy in the early part of the sixteenth century,"
3235,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and was used by Ariosto in his comedies, except that he employed a final"
3236,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"additional unaccented syllable, making eleven syllables in each line."
3237,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Surrey, who used it in his translation of two books of the _Æneid_,"
3238,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,imported it from the Italians. It was called by the Italians _versi
3239,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"sciolti_, ""untied or free verse."" It was, then, the old classical"
3240,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,measure with more freedom.
3241,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3242,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"In his essay, _Blank Verse_, John Addington Symonds dwells especially on"
3243,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"the plasticity and variety of blank verse, which he says it has more"
3244,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,than any other national metre. It may be used for the commonplace and
3245,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"the sublime, the tragic and the comic, etc. It does not have to consist"
3246,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of five iambuses only, but other feet may be substituted almost at the"
3247,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"caprice of the poet. This, however, practically amounts to saying that"
3248,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"blank verse is after all a great deal like prose; indeed, it may be"
3249,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,arranged like modern free verse with great ease. Its plasticity and
3250,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,variety are due to the fact that its artificial requirements are less
3251,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,than those of most other metres. It was a fortunate day for English
3252,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"drama and poetry when Marlowe, Shakespeare and Milton, following in the"
3253,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"footsteps of Surrey's translation of two books of the _Æneid_, and"
3254,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Sackville's and Norton's play, _Gorboduc_, made blank verse fashionable."
3255,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The writers really brought poetry back into prose. For blank verse is
3256,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"but a restricted prose, because there is as often as not no natural"
3257,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"pause at the end of the line, and because other feet may be substituted"
3258,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,for the iambus.
3259,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3260,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,One of the reasons why English verse poetry excels French is because
3261,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"blank verse, a more natural medium than the rhymed Alexandrines, became"
3262,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the chief vehicle for poetry.
3263,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3264,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"In fact, the blank verse of the later Elizabethan dramatists is really"
3265,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"prose, for it is less rhythmical than that of Shakespeare. Blank verse"
3266,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,was said to have degenerated with them. It is also said to be prosaic as
3267,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"used by Wordsworth. These poets, however, are merely less rhythmical"
3268,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,than the alleged masters of blank verse. All blank verse is as near
3269,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose as any metrical medium that has been hitherto introduced. Bernard
3270,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Shaw said he found it easier than prose. It appears very often in prose
3271,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"without the writer being aware of it. Dickens had a tendency, as also"
3272,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"did Ruskin, to drop unconsciously into blank verse in his prose."
3273,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3274,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The great English blank verse poets and nearly all the poets of England
3275,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"in the nineteenth century used this medium, and are really our supreme"
3276,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose poets.
3277,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3278,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The experiment of arranging blank verse in the form of prose and of
3279,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,putting prose in the metre of blank verse has been often tried with
3280,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,success. I have no intention of using this means of showing that blank
3281,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,verse is really a more modulated prose. Any passage of blank verse can
3282,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"naturally also be put into modern free verse, into the free rhythms of"
3283,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Whitman, for example."
3284,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3285,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"The lovers of blank verse imagine, however, that its beauty is partly"
3286,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,derived from the existence of a pause at the end of the fifth foot and
3287,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"because the next line begins with a capital letter. As a matter of fact,"
3288,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"there is no particular virtue in having that pause, and the next line"
3289,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"need not begin with a capital letter, and should be continued as of the"
3290,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"same line. For the real pauses are, after all, not in these artificial"
3291,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,places but where our natural speech and punctuation marks dictate them.
3292,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3293,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"The virtues of blank verse are the virtues of rhythmic prose, which is"
3294,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"still freer and more natural than blank verse, just as blank verse is"
3295,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,preferable to the heroic couplet.
3296,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3297,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Our English poets who write in blank verse would have done even better
3298,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"to use prose, rhythmical or unrhythmical. To us moderns there is"
3299,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,something of a distortion in chopping up good prose into lines of five
3300,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"feet, each beginning with a capital letter. The more beautiful and"
3301,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"natural medium is prose, for blank verse is but a confined prose. It is"
3302,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,not fair or right to make characters speak in this fettered prose. It is
3303,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,absurd to state that their speeches become poetry only because of this
3304,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,fettered prose. Every great passage in Shakespeare in blank verse would
3305,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,have continued to be poetry in regular prose. We observe that the great
3306,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose passages of Shakespeare are poetry even though not in blank verse.
3307,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"English poetry should free itself from the bondage of blank verse, and"
3308,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"use prose. However, next to free verse blank verse is the best medium"
3309,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,that English poetry has yet found.
3310,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3311,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Blank verse was in disfavor in the eighteenth century and was regarded
3312,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,as prose. We may smile at Samuel Johnson's remark upon it in his _Life
3313,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of Roscommon_, but on reflection we find that he was, after all, right."
3314,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"""Blank verse, left merely to its numbers, has little operation either on"
3315,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,ear or mind; it can hardly support itself without bold figures and
3316,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"striking images. A poem frigidly didactic, without rhyme, is so near"
3317,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"prose that the reader only scorns it for pretending to be verse."" He"
3318,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"argues, either write prose or rhyme, but choose no intermediate measure."
3319,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3320,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"The free verse of modern times, the revival of which is due to Walt"
3321,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Whitman, is really the oldest form in which poetry was expressed. It"
3322,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"existed along with parallelism among the Egyptians, Babylonians, and"
3323,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Hebrews, among the Hindoos and the Anglo-Saxons. It is rhythmical prose,"
3324,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,arranged so as to call attention to the rhythm. It is not a third medium
3325,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"for expression, next to prose and the regular verse-forms. The lines do"
3326,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"not return upon themselves, that is, there is no repeat any more than in"
3327,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,rhythmical prose.
3328,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3329,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,In its present form in English it dates from Aelfric's _Lives of the
3330,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Saints_, about 1000 A.D."
3331,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3332,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Free verse has come to stay, and numbers many able poets among its"
3333,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"devotees. It is more natural than rhymed or metrical verse, which,"
3334,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"however, it will not wholly displace. The manuscripts of many poets who"
3335,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,used conventional metres show that the original form of composition was
3336,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,free verse. The detractors of free verse need not think they bring a
3337,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"valid argument against it when they arrange free verse in prose form,"
3338,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and, vice versa, chop up prose sentences into brief lines beginning with"
3339,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"a capital, and ask what is the difference between the two. It is"
3340,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,admitted there is none. It matters not if the poet wishes to arrange his
3341,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"composition in free verse forms to call attention to the rhythm, or to"
3342,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,print it as prose. It is immaterial if you call _vers libre_ rhythmical
3343,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose or a distinct verse form. The poetry is independent of any
3344,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,ordering of the lines. Neither of the resulting products loses or gains
3345,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"in poetical attributes by the objector's turning prose into free verse,"
3346,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"or free verse into prose. The question is, how much ecstasy or emotion,"
3347,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,what impassioned ideas there are in the work.
3348,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3349,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Free verse may or may not have a cadence all its own, but one feels that"
3350,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,those who advocate free verse need not try to prove that it does and
3351,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,must possess a cadence peculiar to itself. Free verse may have great
3352,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,poetic value even though it lacks a unique cadence. Free verse rose into
3353,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prominence lately because poets wanted to be freed from the bonds of
3354,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,metre. They should not encumber themselves with the shackles of a new
3355,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prosody.
3356,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3357,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Let us illustrate our point: we shall take a few lines from a great
3358,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose poem by Lafcadio Hearn and arrange them in free verse. It is from
3359,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"the essay called ""The Eternal Haunter"" in the volume _Exotics and"
3360,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Retrospectives_. The haunter is evidently ancestral memory or the spirit

3367,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Mortals wither in time
3368,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,As leaves in the frost of autumn;
3369,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,But time only brightens the glow
3370,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,And the bloom of her endless youth.
3371,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,All men have loved her
3372,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,But none shall touch with his lips
3373,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Even the hem of her garment.
3374,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3375,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,It is seen that this prose passage in the free verse transformance has
3376,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"the cadences which were present before. It is still poetical, as it was"
3377,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,in the original version as well. It really matters little if Hearn had
3378,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,written it as it now stands. It is a question of personal preference
3379,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"with the poet, in what form he wishes to write."
3380,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3381,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Walter P. Eaton, in an article in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for October,"
3382,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"1919, considers the free verse form different from prose. He took a"
3383,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"passage from Pater's _Renaissance_ and arranged it in free verse form,"
3384,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and then a passage from Sandburg's free verse and arranged it in prose,"
3385,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,and tried unsuccessfully to show that the Pater passage did not become
3386,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"free verse, and that the Sandburg passage did not become good prose."
3387,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,His mistake was in trying to take a passage from Sandburg that had a
3388,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"patterned form, and in arranging the Pater passage into lines that were"
3389,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"too brief. But Professor Lowes has taken passages from Pater, Hewlett,"
3390,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Fiona Macleod, Conrad and George Meredith and printed them as free"
3391,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"verse, and they truly read like free verse poems."
3392,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3393,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"The votaries of free verse demand a special cadence, but there is hardly"
3394,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,any of it in Masters's poems in the _Spoon River Anthology_ which could
3395,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,have been printed as prose passages. They would have been just as good
3396,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and poetical as they are in free verse, but Masters has the right to"
3397,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"make any arrangement he wanted. Ecstasy is more important than cadence,"
3398,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,and he has ecstasy.

3400,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The following passage from Roosevelt's essay on _History as Literature_
3401,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"is poetry by virtue of its ecstasy and visualizing effect, though"

3405,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,poetry does not depend upon the rhythms which are in the original prose.
3406,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,It is only one of the few cases where Roosevelt succeeds in being a

3431,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Dr. Andrews in his _Writing and Reading of Verse_ has also given us
3432,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,illustrations of rhythmic prose that he has resolved into free verse.
3433,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Like Professor Patterson, he rightly refuses to recognize free verse as"
3434,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"a distinct species of verse, holding it to have an affinity at least to"
3435,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose.[117:A] He notes that the free verse advocates have not really
3436,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,defined special laws of free verse. He also recommends the would-be
3437,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,practitioners of free verse to study the prose rhythms of men like Pater
3438,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,and De Quincey.
3439,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3440,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Professor Corson, the Browning scholar, wrote to Walt Whitman that be"
3441,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,believed that impassioned prose would be the medium in which the poetry
3442,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of the future would be written, and that he considered the _Leaves of"
3443,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Grass_ one of the harbingers. The vogue of free verse, which is but"
3444,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"impassioned prose, shows that his prophecy is coming true. In England"
3445,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Matthew Arnold and Walter Henley used it. Edward Carpenter had been
3446,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"writing it as a result of Whitman's influence, in _Towards Democracy_ in"
3447,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"1883. In America Horace Traubel, long before the free verse vogue"
3448,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"started, had been writing in his _The Conservator_ free verse poems. No"
3449,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,one paid attention to these even when some of them were collected in
3450,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"_Optimos_ in 1910, except a few disciples. Richard Hovey, Ernest Crosby,"
3451,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,and Stephen Crane had also been writing free verse after Whitman before
3452,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the year 1900. About 1912 an impetus was given to free verse by the
3453,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,poets of the new poetic era which set in and which Untermeyer calls the
3454,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,_New Era in American Poetry_. Most of the contemporary free verse poets
3455,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,began writing simultaneously.
3456,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3457,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Nearly all of our modern free verse poets are admittedly indebted to
3458,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Whitman; Louis Untermeyer names Whitman as the leading influence on
3459,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,modern American poetry. Let us also be thankful that Whitman did not
3460,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"write about the ""technique of free verse,"" about ""cadence,"" ""strophe"""
3461,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and ""return."""
3462,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3463,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Whitman is without a doubt the father of free verse in America and
3464,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"England to-day. He did not claim to have originated it, since he found a"
3465,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,form of it in the prose poetry of the Bible and Ossian. It was also used
3466,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,by Milton and Blake and in German by Goethe and Heine. As Bliss Perry
3467,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"also shows, _The Lily and the Bee_ by Warren, the author of _Ten"
3468,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Thousand a Year_, was written in free verse, before Whitman. Tupper also"
3469,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,used it. Free verse was adopted in France and Belgium as a result of
3470,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Whitman's influence. America owes nothing to French free verse which was
3471,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,usually rhymed and corresponds to the Pindaric Ode founded by Cowley in
3472,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the middle of the seventeenth century.[119:A]
3473,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3474,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Dionysius of Halicarnassus was one of the few ancient critics who
3475,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,brought the boundaries of prose and poetry close. His work _On Literary
3476,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Composition_ contains two chapters on the importance of rhythm, which he"
3477,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"considers an important element in prose as well as in verse, and he is"
3478,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"especially impressed by the rhythms of Thucydides, Plato and"
3479,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Demosthenes. At the conclusion of this work, which has been translated"
3480,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"by W. Rhys Roberts, are two chapters entitled ""How Prose Can Resemble"
3481,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Verse,"" and ""How Verse Can Resemble Prose."" He wants prose not to be"
3482,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,cast in metre or rhythm but simply to appear rhythmical and metrical;
3483,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the metres and rhythms must be unobstrusively introduced. In this he
3484,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,follows Aristotle's _Rhetoric_ which says prose should have rhythm but
3485,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,of not too marked a character. Dionysius especially shows Demosthenes's
3486,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"great care in the matter of rhythm, and instances as examples of"
3487,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,artistic finish among the Greeks the fact that Isocrates worked ten
3488,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,years on his _Panegyrics_. After having shown how prose may resemble
3489,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,verse he points out how verse resembles prose. When the clauses and
3490,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,sense do not coincide with the metrical line but are carried over for
3491,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"completion in another line, the result is prosaic. That is what makes"
3492,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,our English blank verse so much like prose.
3493,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3494,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Dionysius erred however in not emphasizing the importance of the
3495,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,ecstatic element in making prose and verse resemble each other. He
3496,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"over-valued the use of rhythm in prose, but he was after all swayed by"
3497,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the ecstasy of the writer. He tells of the influence upon him of reading
3498,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,one of Demosthenes's speeches. If Sidney said that he could not take up
3499,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the ballad of Percy and Douglas without feeling his heart moved as by a
3500,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"trumpet, Dionysius says even more beautifully, ""When I take up one of"
3501,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"his speeches, I am entranced and am carried hither and thither, stirred"
3502,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"now by one emotion, now by another. I feel distrust, anxiety, fear,"
3503,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"disdain, hatred, pity, good-will, anger, jealousy. I am agitated by"
3504,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"every passion in turn that can sway the human heart, and am like those"
3505,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"who are being initiated into wild mystic rites."""
3506,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3507,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"However, regularity of feet or metre in prose carried on to a great"
3508,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,extent makes the prose artificial. The Romans occasionally indulged in
3509,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"it, but they generally used rhythmical prose, as the reader of Cicero"
3510,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and Livy will observe. Quintilian, who recognized that prose has often"
3511,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"metrical feet that read like verse, thought it ugly and inelegant that"
3512,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,an entire verse should appear in a prose composition. He says that he
3513,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"does not entertain ""the idea that prose, which ought to have sweeping"
3514,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"and fluent motion, should dawdle itself into dotage in measuring feet"
3515,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,and weighing syllables. For this would be the part of a wretched
3516,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"creature, occupied on the infinitely little. Nor could one who exhausted"
3517,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"himself in this care, have time for better things."""
3518,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3519,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Probably we need not better reply than this to the high claims made for
3520,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the French form known as polyphonic verse. Prose that is interspersed
3521,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,with metrical patterns is not natural.
3522,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3523,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,The truth of the matter is that all the metrical features that are
3524,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"demanded of poetry belong to the ornamental requirements like metaphors,"
3525,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"myths, rhetorical flourishes and all other gewgaws. There are always"
3526,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,stages in civilization when man wants adornment for his speech.
3527,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Something of that mental state exists in us to-day. We bedeck and
3528,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,bedrape our poetry with trappings without which it is better off.
3529,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Artificialities appear even in comparatively modern prose. The prose of
3530,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Milton is full of rhetoric and the great Burke had rhetorical
3531,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,characteristics that we call Asiatic. We are familiar with the
3532,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"euphuistic qualities of the Elizabethan prose, especially pervading John"
3533,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Lyly's novel _Euphues_ and Sidney's _Arcadia_.
3534,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3535,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,In an excellent essay Plutarch shows that he understood that verse was
3536,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"largely natural to man in a certain stage of civilization, because all"
3537,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"ornament was natural to him. In his essay on ""Wherefore the Pythian"
3538,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Priestess now Ceases to Deliver Her Oracle in Verse,"" he gives the love"
3539,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,of ornament as the real reason for the growth of metre as a form of
3540,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,literary expression.
3541,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3542,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Often the topic is broached whether men like Hardy and Meredith are
3543,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,greater as poets than as novelists. The question is not put properly. It
3544,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"should be, Do these writers cease being poets when they use the fetters"
3545,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of rhyme and metre, or are they with those fetters greater poets than"
3546,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,they were in their novels. I have no intention of trying to answer these
3547,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"questions, though it is usually agreed that these writers are greater in"
3548,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"their novels than in their verse, but the point is that they are poets"
3549,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,whether they use prose or verse as their medium.
3550,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3551,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Some authors get more ecstasy into their work when they write in prose
3552,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"than in verse, as readers of the novels and verse poems of Dickens,"
3553,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,George Eliot and Thackeray are aware. Other authors are successful in
3554,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,crystallizing their ecstasy whether they write in prose or verse.
3555,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Goldsmith, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Scott, Emerson, Poe, James"
3556,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Thomson, B. V., Hardy, Meredith, Symons, Hugo, De Musset, Goethe and"
3557,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"Heine, are examples of masters of the literature of ecstasy in both"
3558,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose and verse. Other verse poets have not at all succeeded nor tried
3559,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,to succeed in writing ecstasy in ordinary prose. The authors who have
3560,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,given us ecstasy only in prose but have not tried to do so at all in
3561,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,verse are too numerous to mention.
3562,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3563,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,I believe that poetry will again return to the natural language of
3564,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"prose. Critics are taking an entirely different stand toward rhythm,"
3565,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"admitting that the poets have the right to vary their measures, create"
3566,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,new rhythm and not be held in bondage to old verse forms. The day is
3567,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,disappearing when a man like Hegel could say that a production not in
3568,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,metre is not poetry. A sane attitude towards the free use of rhythms by
3569,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,poets has been given us in a _New Study of English Poetry_ by Henry
3570,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Newbolt. Liberal critics are helping the poets break their shackles; the
3571,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"following passage from a review of Newbolt's book, by J. Middleton Murry"
3572,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,is worth quoting:
3573,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,
3574,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,Great Poets have always been those who believed that poetry
3575,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,was by nature the worthiest vessel of the highest arguments of
3576,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,which the soul of man is capable. Yet a poetic theory such as
3577,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"this seems bound to include great prose, and not merely the"
3578,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,prose which can most easily be assimilated to the conditions
3579,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of poetry, such as Plato's _Republic_, or Milton's"
3580,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"_Areopagitica_, but the prose of the great novelists. Surely"
3581,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,the colloquial prose of Tchekov's _Cherry Orchard_ has as good
3582,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"claim to be called poetry as _The Essay on Man_, _Tess of the"

3585,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,progress by which the kinds of literary art merge into one? If
3586,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"we insist that rhythm is essential to poetry, we are in danger"
3587,BLANK VERSE AND FREE VERSE AS FORMS OF PROSE,"of confusing the accident with the essence, and of fastening"

3659,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,when emotionally and ecstatically presented. And philosophers like

3662,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Our definition of poetry throws much light on the subject of the

3664,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"to poetry. Poets should instruct, while delighting, is the contention of"
3665,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"one group. They ought merely to express beauty and emotions, is the"
3666,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emphatic demand of another class. I doubt if there has ever been a great
3667,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poet who hasn't done both of these things. If a poet is to teach he
3668,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"must teach something; he must express ideas, and ideas mean thoughts"
3669,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"about life, and these in turn refer to the relations of man to himself,"
3670,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"to one another, to the opposite sex, to society, to the universe, to"
3671,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,nature. But it is while doing this that he must give us beauty and
3672,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emotion.
3673,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3674,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,When a prose writer is purely didactic without any emotional or
3675,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,aesthetic appeal he is no poet. It is manifestly absurd also for an
3676,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,author to give in metre didactic works which could be better written in
3677,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"prose. To this extent the disciples of art for art's sake are right,"
3678,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"that the poet should not give us unecstatic political, philosophical or"
3679,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"moral lessons in metre. If, as I believe, our emotions may be expressed"
3680,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"in prose or free verse probably more poetically than even in metre, it"
3681,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"is surely inadvisable to drive home a prosaic idea in verse, and"
3682,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,especially at great length. Yet this has often been done. Browning gave

3690,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3691,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,But the future poets will not spin out their ideas in metre at great

3696,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3697,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,John Addington Symonds has in his _Essays Speculative and Suggestive_
3698,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,taken two of the most famous dicta in English literature regarding the
3699,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"function of poetry in relation to form and matter, and given us a sane"
3700,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,viewpoint. He analyzes Arnold's statement that poetry is a criticism of
3701,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"life, and Pater's assumption that all art, including poetry, aspires"
3702,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,towards the condition of music which thus in his opinion becomes the
3703,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,true type or measure of consummate art. Symonds shuns both the
3704,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"didacticism which Arnold's view encourages, and the worship of form"
3705,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,implied in Pater's statement; though it should be said that Pater in his
3706,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"essay on ""Style"" urges that, after all, subject matter is the deciding"
3707,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"factor in determining great art. As Symonds says, the poet gives us"
3708,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"rather a revelation than a criticism of life, a presentment according to"
3709,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,his faculty for observing and displaying it; he is more a reporter and a
3710,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,seer than a judge. Poets take their final rank by matter and not by
3711,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"form. Though Symonds mentions slurringly a great poet like Baudelaire,"
3712,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,still the following lines should be carefully pondered by many of our
3713,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"versifiers: ""The carving of cherry-stones in verse, the turning of"
3714,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"triolets and rondeaux, the seeking after sound and color without heed"
3715,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"for sense, is all foredoomed to final failure."" Poetry appeals to the"
3716,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"imaginative reason, and must embody thought and emotion. As Symonds"
3717,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"remarks, Pater's discrimination between these two is fanciful."
3718,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3719,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Poetry then must not be timid about dealing with ideas in an emotional
3720,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,or imaginative manner. It may even take up moral problems provided it
3721,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,does not sink into the commonplace ethical purposes that we have in the
3722,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"_Psalm of Life_ and _Excelsior_, two of Longfellow's most inferior and"
3723,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,popular poems. An idea that is the result of reason may be uttered with
3724,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"ecstasy, and hence there may be logic in poetry."
3725,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3726,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"In his _Oxford Lectures on Poetry_ in the essay on ""Poetry for Poetry's"

3728,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"is no consequence what a poet says but how he says it, and he rightly"

3730,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,encourages men to taste poetry as though it were wine. Poetry inheres in

3732,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poem has no more lesson for us than a tree is to institute a false

3735,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,When one finishes a volume of poetry by some of the purely aesthetic
3736,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"poets, one is amazed at the kind of life they embody in art. It is often"

3738,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"old poet, or a superabundant reference to flowers. It is not of the"
3739,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,substance of which noble lives are made. We are pained to find that
3740,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,trite utterances or references are tricked out in gaudy images and given
3741,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,forth to the world in large quantities.
3742,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3743,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Verses of trivial facts and ideas set forth with artifice are not
3744,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"poetry. Indeed, it is a petty employment for poets to be giving vent to"
3745,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"labored conceits about gold fish, and vases, about dandelions and"
3746,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"kittens and lollypops, investing none of these themes with imagination"
3747,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,or intellect. Man is stirred by thousands of emotions arising from his
3748,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"inability to adjust himself to surroundings, by his thwarted will and"
3749,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,suppressed desires. He is often wrapped in gloom for want of real
3750,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,truthful consoling poetry. He experiences tragedies due to conflicts
3751,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"with relatives, friends, to lack of harmony in matrimonial or amorous"
3752,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,affairs. His life is often being gradually snuffed out by the prevailing
3753,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,of stupid and deplorable customs; he is often starving or being
3754,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"insufficiently fed, and frequently sees his children in unhappy"
3755,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"circumstances. He is the victim of tyrants and unjust social systems,"
3756,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and is engaged in soul-killing occupations. He faces the great
3757,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"mysteries of existence, the riddle of the Sphinx. He witnesses cruelties"
3758,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"of all kinds, persecution of races and individuals, mismanagement of"
3759,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"affairs, lynchings, massacres, wars and imprisonments. Hypocrisy and"
3760,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"vindictiveness are rife and man suffers thereby. He thirsts for beauty,"
3761,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,he pants for happiness.
3762,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3763,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Yet poets who may find numerous and important subjects for the
3764,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"literature of ecstasy, are busy writing sugared verses about mosaics,"
3765,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"candles, and puppies, and arranging vowel sounds and rhythms. Men's"
3766,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,souls are starving to be fed with poetry and the versifiers polish and
3767,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"file and chisel verses on themes that interest no one. As Horace says,"
3768,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,the mountains are in labor and the issue is but a ridiculous mouse.

3770,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Indeed it is not the subject the poet chooses that one objects to, but"
3771,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"to the absence of ideas, or the shallowness or triviality of the idea."
3772,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Burns took a daisy and made it the symbol of the racked poet, and could"
3773,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,write about a mouse or a louse and deduce some universal idea. Shelley
3774,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and Keats could endure emotions and thoughts by singing of a skylark or
3775,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,a nightingale. But the petty poet cannot deduce anything but a trifling
3776,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"idea, no matter what theme he selects."
3777,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3778,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Another feature which distinguishes the minor poet in prose or verse is
3779,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,his investing a trite idea with an emotion out of all proportion. He
3780,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"hales with enthusiasm a commonplace, he gets into ecstasy about that"
3781,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,toward which an intelligent man displays little or no emotion. It is the
3782,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,distinction of the unknown author of the ancient Greek fragment _On the
3783,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Sublime_ that he deprecates the tendency to wax emotional about the
3784,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,unemotional. The silly ideas and emotions about which versifiers get
3785,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"excited are often an index to their own moral and intellectual failing,"
3786,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,as well as their aesthetic deficiency. From Sainte-Beuve Matthew Arnold
3787,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"appropriately quotes a saying to the effect that, in judging a work, the"
3788,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"French question not only whether they are moved by it, but whether also"
3789,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,they have the right to be moved by it.
3790,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3791,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"So when we look through much of the so-called popular poetry, we see why"
3792,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,we cannot often admit it to the high realm of the literature of ecstasy.
3793,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,It contains the childish sentimental excitement about facts that every
3794,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,thinking man takes for granted. When we read the eloquent sermon on the
3795,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"advantage of practicing justice, we wonder at the folly of making a"
3796,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,comment about so obvious a truism. It is for this reason that moral
3797,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"axioms lack the elements of poetry, because they do not admit of"
3798,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,exposition with appreciable ecstasy. Verse is full of stale themes sung
3799,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,over so often that we almost rebel when the new poet comes along and
3800,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,sings over the same old story.
3801,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3802,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,It requires a great intellect to know when to judge rightly about the
3803,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,propriety of one's emotions for the subject of literature. We do not
3804,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,think that it is the subject matter of emotion to go into ecstatic
3805,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"praises, for example, over a man who supports his child. We find that"
3806,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,animals provide food for their young; hence it is not fit to grow
3807,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,eloquent because a man does what even the lowest animal has the instinct
3808,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,to do.
3809,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3810,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Conventional morality only becomes poetry when colored by the
3811,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,imagination or illustrated by an unusually pleasing ecstatic
3812,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"presentment. When Fuller, for instance, says that we should not mock at"
3813,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"the defects of people who are physically or mentally disabled, he utters"
3814,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,a stale truism that is not poetry but ethics. When he adds that it is
3815,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"pitiable to beat a cripple with his own crutches, the little prose"
3816,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"passage is lifted up into poetry, for we are brought into a state of"
3817,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,ecstasy by the imaginative illustration. Similarly take some of the
3818,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,instances of self-sacrifice by the common people which Bret Harte and O.
3819,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Henry delighted in depicting. Some of their stories become poetry by
3820,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emotional presentation of a trite idea.
3821,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3822,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"There must also be more or less sympathy with the poet's viewpoint. ""All"

3826,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"cause, and purity of the emotion, is the possibility of the fine art. A"
3827,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"maiden may sing of her lost love, but a miser cannot sing of his lost"
3828,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"money."""
3829,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3830,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Ruskin may have corrupted our artistic outlook somewhat by insisting on
3831,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,an ethical aim. Yet we should remember that our aesthetic feelings are
3832,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,influenced by our moral outlook. While we should not seek an ethical aim
3833,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"in literature as an end in itself, while we should shun the preacher of"
3834,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"commonplaces who poses as a poet, we cannot respond to the sympathetic"
3835,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,depicting of an emotion which we ourselves could never feel because of
3836,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,repugnance to it.
3837,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3838,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"To appreciate a poem truly, we must feel as the poet does and sympathize"
3839,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,with the motives that inspired his feelings. The reasons that urge him
3840,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,to express his emotions must appear to us just ones. If our intellect is
3841,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"far greater than that of the poet, we shall find that many of the causes"
3842,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,that inspire him to sing as he does would not at all arouse in us the
3843,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emotions experienced by him; his poem is not the greatest art to us. If
3844,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"his intellect is superior to ours, we shall not like his work; but then"
3845,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,it will be because he is more advanced than we are.
3846,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3847,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,If a poet were to sing of an incestuous love; or decry sympathy for the
3848,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,distressed; or to laud a cruel action; or to gloat over the schemes of
3849,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,the fraudulent; or sing favorably of any action which we think a base
3850,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"one, his poem would not be art for it does not evoke emotional response"
3851,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,from anybody.
3852,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3853,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Poe laid down the principle of art for art's sake that poetry deals with
3854,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,beauty alone and that the only faculty for appreciating it is that of
3855,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,taste. He held that poetry had nothing to do with truth or duty; that
3856,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,the intellect and the moral sense were concerned with these and hence
3857,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,had no field for exercising themselves either in writing or judging
3858,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poetry.
3859,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3860,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"As a matter of fact all three faculties, taste, intellect and moral"
3861,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"sense, are called into use in creating and appreciating the highest kind"
3862,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,of poetry or any other form of literature. There is no reason why a poet
3863,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,should not make use of all three faculties if he has them all developed.
3864,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Goethe and Ibsen possessed them. The highest form of taste can scarcely
3865,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,be attained unless the poet's intellect and moral sense are fine. For
3866,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,falsehood and sin are repugnant to our taste for beauty. A book that is
3867,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,absolutely tainted with moral perversities or shows a foolish and
3868,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,inconceivable conception of intellectual values will be certainly
3869,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,deficient in some phases of beauty. Our consciences and our minds are
3870,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,unconsciously consulted in our conception of the beautiful. Not only
3871,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"truth, but duty is beauty. Even Poe maintained that Taste held intimate"
3872,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,relations with Intellect and Truth and he therefore placed it between
3873,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,them.
3874,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3875,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,The greatest classics are those that appeal to all three faculties in us
3876,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and those works which offend both our intellect and moral sense do not
3877,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,completely satisfy our sense of beauty. The best critics from Hazlitt to
3878,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Brandes understood that. Fortunately many of the classics have lost only
3879,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"in parts their moral and intellectual value, and hence still hold sway"
3880,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,over us. And sometimes the beauty is so intensely striking that we
3881,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,charitably overlook faults of morality and intellect.
3882,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3883,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,As Professor Woodberry says in his _A New Defense of Poetry_ in _The
3884,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Heart of Man_: ""Can there by any surprise when I say that the method of"
3885,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,idealism is that of all thought? that in its intellectual process the
3886,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"art of the poet, so far from being a sort of incantation, is the same as"
3887,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"belongs to the logician, the chemist, the statesman? It is no more than"
3888,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,to say that in creating literature the mind acts; the action of the mind
3889,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,is thought; and there are no more two ways of thinking than there are
3890,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"two kinds of gravitation."""
3891,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3892,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,The connection between art and ethics is closer than some critics
3893,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,imagine. Spingarn was mistaken when he said that we have done with all
3894,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,moral judgment of literature. A book is often artistically great chiefly
3895,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,because its ethical viewpoint is right. The rightness of it is often
3896,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,what creates the ecstasy. Let us take Ibsen's _Ghosts_. The real
3897,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,greatness of this play is not chiefly in its picture of heredity or of a
3898,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,man becoming an idiot. Its real value lies in its attitude towards the
3899,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"marriage problem and its contrast of the two characters, Mrs. Alving,"
3900,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"the representative of the new order, and of Pastor Manders, representing"
3901,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"society. The leading question there is, should Mrs. Alving have gone"
3902,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"back to her husband, knowing that he was possessed of a loathsome"
3903,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,disease which might be inherited by any possible progeny? Was she
3904,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,justified in leaving him? That these are the important questions is
3905,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"evident from the motive which prompted Ibsen to write the play, namely,"
3906,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,to answer the critics of the _Doll's House_. The conclusion reached by
3907,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Ibsen from the terrible picture is that Mrs. Alving was wrong in going
3908,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"back to her husband, that there are times when it is justifiable to"
3909,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"leave one's husband. This is the moral lesson of the play, and is"
3910,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"conveyed with great ecstasy; in fact, the moral intensifies the ecstasy."
3911,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,A conventional playwright would have concluded that Mrs. Alving should
3912,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"have remained with her husband in obedience to duty, that the"
3913,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,simple-minded Pastor was in the right. The play even if handled as well
3914,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"as by Ibsen could not have been the great work of literature that it is,"
3915,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,if written in defense of the conventional moral code. A great author
3916,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,attacks conventional morality to battle for a higher morality.
3917,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3918,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,The moral ideas of an author have much to do with the literary
3919,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,excellence of his work.[133:A] But this does not mean that we must go
3920,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,back to the old Greek idea that poetry be a vehicle for the inculcation
3921,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,of the commonplace ethics. Nor does it imply that we cannot appreciate a
3922,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poet because we disapprove of the religion or political party with which
3923,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,he is affiliated.
3924,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3925,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"In the conclusion of his essay on ""How a Young Man Should Study Poetry,"""
3926,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Plutarch shows that the philosopher and the poet are engaged in the same
3927,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,mission. He takes passages from the poets and shows us that they are
3928,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,similar to those he selects from the philosophers. The doctrines of
3929,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Plato and Pythagoras agree with the ideas by the dramatists spoken on
3930,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"the stage, and with those that lyricists sang to the harp. We may accept"
3931,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Plutarch's views except in so far as he urges that poetry should preach
3932,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,dogmatic and conventional ethics.

3946,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Among the most famous philosophical passages of Shakespeare is the one
3947,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,in _The Tempest_ describing the transitoriness of this world and ending
3948,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,with the famous line about our life being rounded with sleep. If there
3949,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"is anything in Shakespeare that is poetry of a high order, this famous"
3950,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"passage is, and yet it is really philosophy. It is poetry not because it"
3951,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"is in blank verse or has rhythm, but because the ideas are stated in an"
3952,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emotional and ecstatic manner. There is poetry in ideas and those
3953,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,critics who shrink from applying the word poetry to intellectual
3954,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,performances are urged to honeycomb their Shakespeare for numerous ideas
3955,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,that are beyond question poetry.

3957,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"A great idea is poetry; a profound and farseeing idea is poetry, whether"

3959,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"adorned, may sometimes be poetry, most certainly a profound idea"
3960,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,ecstatically but unrhythmically expressed is poetry.
3961,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3962,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,What is the difference between poetry and philosophy? If we examine into
3963,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,the nature of each we will find that there is a line at which they meet
3964,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"and where it is hard to distinguish one from the other. As a rule, the"
3965,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"principles of metaphysics, epistemology and logic as written down in the"
3966,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,average philosophical work seldom are poetry. Only occasionally have
3967,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"the philosophers waxed ecstatic. Yet many novelists, essayists and verse"
3968,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,writers have made many of these philosophical principles poetry by
3969,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,stating them in an ecstatic manner. Any philosophical principle arousing
3970,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,our emotions is poetry.

3972,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"The general truths of sociology, ethics and psychology form the subject"

3974,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,ecstatically treated. The psychological novel and the problem play deal
3975,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"with these truths. Go to some original treatises on sociological, moral"
3976,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"or psychological subjects and omit the statistics, the laboratory work"
3977,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and the cold hard reasoning and you will often find great ideas
3978,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,emotionally stated that belong to the literature of ecstasy. We have
3979,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,parted with the idea that an author must be tearing a passion to
3980,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"tatters, or telling a story, or uttering a complaint, in order to"
3981,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,produce poetry. When Herbert Spencer analyzes love for a page and a half
3982,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"and tells us how it is composed, we exclaim, this is the literature of"
3983,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,ecstasy even though we find it in a treatise on psychology. He describes
3984,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,to us how we feel when we love by enumerating to us the different

3993,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
3994,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,We might select many passages from philosophical works that belong to
3995,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"the literature of ecstasy, passages from Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and"
3996,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Hume, but more especially from Plato, Pascal, Schopenhauer and"
3997,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Nietzsche. There are isolated paragraphs in their works wherein we find
3998,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,the imagination and the intellect fused; we cannot distinguish that
3999,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,which belongs to the realm of logic and that which is the result of pure
4000,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"emotion. Of philosophers of our own time, Bergson and Bertrand Russel"
4001,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,have occasional passages where a profound idea is emotionalized. Hence
4002,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"these belong to the literature of ecstasy, or poetry."
4003,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4004,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,We must no longer conclude that only that is poetry which sings a song
4005,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"in verse. It is just because the verse lyric, epic, and tragedy are"
4006,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,among the oldest forms of literature that the theories of poetry have
4007,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"been built up by examining chiefly these forms. Aristotle's _Poetics_,"
4008,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"except for a few vital passages, has done more mischief in literary"
4009,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,criticism than his _Logic_ has done in philosophy.
4010,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4011,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,What a queer definition of poetry is that which includes a metrical
4012,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"insipid utterance or a versified fact of microscopic importance, and"
4013,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,excludes the sublime reflections of philosophers who contemplate the
4014,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"nature of the entire cosmos, who fathom the mysteries of the universe,"
4015,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and who state for us our relation to it and give us profound conceptions
4016,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,of it. If one finds poetry only in the saccharine sonnets of our
4017,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"magazine writers and none at all in the great philosophers, he does not"
4018,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"understand what poetry is. If you, however, call a philosophical"
4019,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"principle poetry when you find it in verse, you must admit that the"
4020,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"poetry was there before it was put in verse, in the prose version. For"
4021,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"poetry, not being a branch of literature but an emotional spirit bathing"
4022,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"all literature, also holds philosophical ideas, intellectual conceptions"
4023,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"in solution, whenever these are in prose and move to ecstasy."
4024,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4025,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Aristotle and many others were also absorbed as to the difference
4026,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"between poetry and history, as they had been between poetry and"
4027,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,philosophy. He stated truly enough that Homer as a poet did not differ
4028,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,from Herodotus as a historian simply because of their difference in
4029,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,metre. He found that the difference between poetry and history lay in
4030,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"this, that poetry dealt with the universal and history with the"
4031,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,particular. This definition means very little to us to-day even though
4032,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,commentators try to explain that Aristotle includes under poetry any
4033,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,treatment also of the particular which presents universal situations and
4034,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"depicts universal traits. History, however, also treats of the"
4035,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"universal, for it records universal traits in the particular events"
4036,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"which it describes. Aristotle's distinction falls, for history and"
4037,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poetry deal with both the particular and universal. We cannot say with
4038,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Aristotle that history tells what Alcibiades actually did, while poetry"
4039,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,would tell what any man would do. An actual emotional account of the
4040,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"deeds and character of Alcibiades is poetry, as you will observe by"
4041,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,reading Plutarch.
4042,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4043,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"For all historical writing may be poetical and contain poems, if the"
4044,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,ecstasy is there. What distinguishes the poetry in history is the
4045,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"emotion, and all history that is a dry narrative is history and not"
4046,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,poetry. Thucydides's _Peloponnesian War_ and Carlyle's _French
4047,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Revolution_ contain much poetry though they deal with the particular,"
4048,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"but they are made poetry by the ecstasy. Some of Herodotus is poetry,"
4049,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,and much of Homer is history.
4050,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4051,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,Again Aristotle's distinction is obsolete in these days of prose fiction
4052,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"which deals with the particular, and often with the actual, and merely"
4053,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,changes the names. And these novels often contain poems. We recall
4054,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"Fielding's distinction between novels and histories, the former being"
4055,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"true in everything but the names, and the latter being false in"
4056,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,everything but the names.
4057,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,
4058,MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AS POETRY WHEN WRITTEN WITH ECSTASY,"There is poetry in Livy, Tacitus, in Gibbon, Froude, and all great"

4094,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"important thing was the execution, that art was not to be judged by any"

4101,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4102,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,In many respects the theory awakens sympathy in all lovers of
4103,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,literature; it was a reaction to the moralist view which wanted art to
4104,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,teach the commonplace ethical notions we all know. Art has always had an
4105,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"enemy in the bourgeois moralist. He always looked for a sermon, and"
4106,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,stamped the artist as immoral who arrived at conclusions different from
4107,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,those countenanced by the church or the state. He was not satisfied to
4108,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"read of a wonderful portrayal of a passion, done as a lesson in"
4109,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,psychology without any moral comments by the author. He wanted the
4110,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"artist to act like a preacher and condemn at all times, instead of"
4111,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,portray. The Puritan opposed the truthful description of natural
4112,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,emotions; he looked askance upon references to the body; he wanted
4113,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"people drawn in obedience to laws, instead of as breaking through them."
4114,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,He tried to thrust subjects upon the artist and limit him. He had no ear
4115,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"for sound, no eye for color, no appreciation of beauty."
4116,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4117,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Little wonder that the artist lost patience and sent morality to the
4118,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"devil, and deified technique and deliberately chose unseemly subjects."
4119,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,The disciples of art for art's sake did much good to the cause of art.
4120,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,They broadened its field. They gave the artist the right to write about
4121,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"a corpse or delirium tremens, to describe a murder or a crime without"
4122,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,pointing out lessons. They permitted him to use his imagination to the
4123,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"full extent, and to invent any forms he chose."
4124,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4125,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,But the theory overrode itself. It became an apology for abuses of art.
4126,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Writers began to create meaningless jargon, to waste words on trite"
4127,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"ideas, to avoid all contact with life, to eliminate man as a subject of"
4128,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"art. Art lacked soul, and if it showed a personality behind it, it was"
4129,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"a petty, sterile and inane one. Art fought against intellect as well as"
4130,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,against morals. Even those who advocated it were writing in direct
4131,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,violation of it. Flaubert's realistic novel _Madame Bovary_ and
4132,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Swinburne's _Songs Before Sunrise_ were not art for art's sake. _The
4133,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Ballad of Reading Gaol_ was not art for art's sake; imprisonment had
4134,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"changed Wilde's views. Men like Gautier and Swinburne, who were the most"
4135,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"ardent champions of the theory of art for art's sake, found themselves"
4136,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,in a peculiarly inconsistent predicament by being the greatest admirers
4137,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"of Victor Hugo, much of whose work was written with humanitarian"
4138,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,motives. Hearn in America started out as a believer in the theory and
4139,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,ended by attacking it.
4140,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4141,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Tolstoy wrote most bitterly against the idea, and we may say that from"
4142,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the time of the appearance of his _What is Art?_ in 1897, the theory"
4143,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,fell into disrepute. Not that people accepted Tolstoy's views that art
4144,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"should teach the love of God and man, but his idea did much to humanize"
4145,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"art. Before Tolstoy, Nietzsche had also taken a fling at the theory."
4146,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4147,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Critics to-day recognize that life forms the substance of art, that art"
4148,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,gets all its material from life and that man is properly the subject of
4149,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"art, thinking man as well as emotional man. They further perceive that"
4150,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,literature is so human in its origins that even unconscious human
4151,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,emotions are present where they were not suspected. The more we humanize
4152,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"literature the greater art does it become. It is true, however, that"
4153,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"after the art work is completed, it has influence on life. Our lives may"
4154,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"be devoted to art, we may have life for art's sake, but not art for"
4155,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,art's sake.
4156,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4157,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Still, art for art's sake is a good theory to be invoked against the"
4158,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,extreme didactic-minded one who thinks nothing should be written unless
4159,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"it illustrates a lesson in our commonplace and bourgeois morality, a"
4160,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,morality very often false and outworn. They would ask writers to show us
4161,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"men conforming to this morality, instead of revolting from it. They"
4162,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,would make literature exalt self-sacrifice in all circumstances and
4163,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,would stamp out any tendencies to liberal speculation. They demand that
4164,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"poetry uphold society in all its institutions, teach obedience, and"
4165,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,prevail on us to bow down before the mandates of priests and
4166,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,capitalists. But literary men are often at variance with the moral views
4167,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"entertained by the clergy and the ruling classes, and they have the"
4168,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,right to illustrate the views of morality that they consider much higher
4169,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,than the customs of society. An author should not be bound by the views
4170,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,of his age. He should in fact expose them and show their evil influence.
4171,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"He does not, however, then write in conformity with the theory of art"
4172,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"for art's sake, for he expresses another morality than that of"
4173,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"society's, and thus has a higher moral purport in view. Ibsen's"
4174,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,greatness lies in the fact that he did not subscribe to conventional
4175,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,morality: he attacked it and thus he really was an artist with a moral
4176,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,aim.
4177,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4178,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Brandes has shown in his essay on Björnson how the attack upon art with
4179,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,a purpose is really often a disguised means of objecting to liberal
4180,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,thought in literature. Art for art's sake occasionally thus becomes an
4181,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,apology for conventional morals too. Most of the great works were
4182,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,written with a purpose. Dante and Milton have left records in their
4183,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,prose works of the purpose of their poems. But no one objected to the
4184,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"purpose of these poets, because they defend conventional morality. Yet"
4185,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,as soon as literature tries to advance new ideas we hear the cry against
4186,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,its moralizing and didactic tendency. Art for art's sake is then the
4187,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,shout of even the conventional moralist. Those who declare themselves
4188,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,against the tendency of the intellectual element in literature are often
4189,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"those who fear new ideas; they would want only romance, homely morals,"
4190,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"happy endings and impossible adventures, constant triumph of good, etc."
4191,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,They do not understand what literature has to do with problems of
4192,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"marriage and divorce, the state and the individual. They want it to be"
4193,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"separated from real life. Nevertheless, they cannot ignore the great"
4194,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,books of our day which deal with these questions. They have been driven
4195,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"to the theory of ""art for art's sake"" by their hatred of liberal ideas."
4196,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4197,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"""The formula, 'written with a purpose,'"" says Brandes, ""has been far too"
4198,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,long employed as an effective scarecrow to drive authors away from the
4199,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"fruit that beckons to them from the modern tree of knowledge."""
4200,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4201,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"When Whitman, Ibsen, Tolstoy and Zola brought us messages in ecstatic"
4202,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"prose, the enemies of intellect in art called them preachers of filthy"
4203,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"ideas, misguided moralists, and would not consider them as artists and"
4204,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,poets. The moralist and aesthete joined forces in attacking Balzac and
4205,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Stendhal when these novelists gave us unpopular ideas emotionally
4206,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,expressed. The critic who hates advanced thought exclaims that he wants
4207,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,no ideas in art at all; he does not wish it to become the vehicle of
4208,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,views he personally dislikes. Hence at times even the Philistine critic
4209,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,who opposed the introduction of intellect in art found himself in
4210,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,harmony with members of the art for art's sake school.
4211,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4212,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Nothing better illustrates the harm which may result from the theory
4213,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"that shuns a purpose in art, than the neglect it brings about for books"
4214,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"with an unpopular message. England, for example, has neglected the best"
4215,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"work of one of the poets of the nineties, who intellectually ranks with"
4216,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,her best poets. Who reads the later work of Robert Buchanan? Attention
4217,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"is riveted to his early lyrics, and good as these are, his more"
4218,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,thoughtful poetry has been forgotten. A. Stoddart-Walker wrote after
4219,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Buchanan's death _Robert Buchanan, the Poet of Modern Revolt_, and"
4220,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Harriet Jay wrote a biography. Attention was called in these volumes to
4221,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the later works of Buchanan, where he stood for liberty of thought. Nor"
4222,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"was he didactic in his pleas, in such poems as _The City of Dreams_,"
4223,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"_The Wandering Jew_, _The Ballad of Mary the Mother_, _The Outcast_,"
4224,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"_The Devil's Case_, and _The New Rome_. Lecky called _The City of"
4225,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Dreams_ the modern _Pilgrim's Progress_, and said that it would take a"
4226,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,prominent position in the literature of the time. But no one knows these
4227,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"poems, and of Buchanan's work only a few ballads are known. Buchanan is"
4228,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"not any more didactic than Browning, but since he represents bold"
4229,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,speculation (and also made too many personal enemies) he was throttled
4230,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,by Philistinism.
4231,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4232,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,The opponents of utilitarianism in art have been the calumniators of
4233,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,poets with ideas unacceptable to the majority. They have hindered the
4234,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,popularity of pessimistic poets like Leopardi and Thomson. They are
4235,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,shocked by the morbidities of Dostoievsky and Strindberg. But every
4236,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,author has the right to describe emotions without being compelled to
4237,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,draw a moral from them. In such case the writer becomes a great
4238,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"psychologist, and his work is by no means devoid of intellectual"
4239,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,content. Thus the stories of Poe which have no moral outlook are really
4240,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,stories with a purpose for they are profound documents in psychology. To
4241,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,them psychologists like Mosso have gone for studies of the emotion of
4242,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,fear. One finds ideas in them that throw light on the nature of our
4243,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,emotions. Hence Brownell in his well written essay on Poe which attacked
4244,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,him because of his indifference to moral problems (a view in which
4245,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Howells and James concur) is wrong in denying to Poe a high place in
4246,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,art. Poe did what all artists do: he drew on his emotions and if he
4247,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"could portray fear and grief for death, it was because he had known"
4248,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"them. Graham describes the timid nature of Poe, who was afraid to be"
4249,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,himself alone. That feeling accounts for the _Fall of the House of
4250,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Usher_. Poe's stories are rich in ideas, in valuable psychological data."
4251,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"None of them, except _William Wilson_, has an ethical aim, but they all"
4252,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"have an intellectual, utilitarian purport, in giving us profound"
4253,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,knowledge of man's hidden emotions. They are the result of Poe's keen
4254,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,intellect as well as of his emotions. They have anticipated many
4255,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,researches by psychologists; they have set circulating profound views of
4256,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the psychic constitution of man. They thus became art with a purpose,"
4257,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"not however to spread ethical truisms, but broad liberating ideas."
4258,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4259,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Those art for art's sake critics who take their inspiration from Poe's
4260,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"essay on the _Poetic Principle_, sadly misunderstand their critic."

4266,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"that poetry should not become the mere vehicle of moral commonplaces,"
4267,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"for these are not beautiful, and the vogue of the New England school was"
4268,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,beginning to make the moral aims of poetry too paramount.
4269,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4270,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,The poet should be free and if he wants to emotionalize a social message
4271,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"he should be allowed to do so, risking aesthetic value if he becomes"
4272,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"didactic, or is false in his views. And he should also be allowed to"
4273,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"describe beauty and emotions, without being compelled to draw a moral"

4275,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4276,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Croce, who defined poetry as intuition, has helped to keep on its last"
4277,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,legs the idea of art for art's sake. He falsely teaches that poetry
4278,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"deals with pure emotions, and that emotions and ideas are two separate"
4279,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"functions, one of the feeling man, the other of the thinking man."
4280,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4281,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Though Croce admits that the intellectual has its aesthetic side, that"
4282,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"art deals with the philosophic and moral, yet this definition of"
4283,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,literature in terms of intuition is not a true account of the nature of
4284,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"literature, for he regards the intuitive faculty as totally opposed to"
4285,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the logical faculty, a Kantian relic. Intuition, however, is the"
4286,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,combined product of all the logical faculties exercised by man in the
4287,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"past, just as the action of an involuntary muscle is the continued"
4288,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"action of a muscle once voluntary, but which by force of habit for ages"
4289,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,became involuntary.
4290,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4291,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Intuition is not merely the knowledge of our hearts but of our brain as
4292,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,well. The great novels and plays of the world's literature are the
4293,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,artistic results of the intellect collaborating with the emotions. Croce
4294,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,presents an ingenious explanation to enable him to call works of art
4295,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"which are full of intellectuality, works of intuition. He says that the"
4296,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,effect of the work as a whole is that of an intuition. He holds that
4297,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,when intellectual concepts are mingled with intuition they are not then
4298,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"intellectual concepts but part of the intuition. If this be so, the rule"
4299,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,works the other way around. If intuition is mingled with intellectual
4300,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"concepts appearing in a philosophical or scientific work, why not then"
4301,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,say that the intuitive quality disappears and becomes part of the
4302,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,intellectual concept and that the scientific or philosophic work becomes
4303,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,a work of intuition or a work of art as a whole? There is intellectual
4304,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,working in Hamlet and intuitive expression in a dialogue of Plato. The
4305,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,former is not wholly intuitive nor the latter wholly intellectual.

4307,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,This is Croce's great fault--that he tries to rid poetry of what he

4312,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"involves concepts, so that his view of poetry is that of the art for"
4313,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"art's sake school,--that poetry deals not with ideas but with intuitive"
4314,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,feeling.
4315,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4316,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Now, feeling and thought are not separable. Feeling involves knowledge"
4317,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,and instant reflection. The bereaved poet knows and reflects on many
4318,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,things at the very instant he is suffering the shock of his loss. His
4319,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,intellectual and perceptual faculties cannot be set apart from the
4320,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,psychical activity of his emotions. The authors of the greatest
4321,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"English elegies philosophized while bemoaning their loss. The moral,"
4322,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,intellectual and logical faculties are at work along with the intuitive
4323,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"faculty, or immediate knowledge of feeling, in all great poets."
4324,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4325,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,It is in his views on intuition that Croce reduces art to presentation
4326,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"of childish impressions or views, divested of judgment and reflection."
4327,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,He discourages reasoning and thinking on the part of the artist. He
4328,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"seeks only the first instant of the poet's emotions, though he admits"
4329,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,that in real life sensations are followed by reflections and mental
4330,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,solutions. He thinks the purest artists are those who persist longest in
4331,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"that first moment of intuition, and are innocent and childish in their"
4332,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,outlook.
4333,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4334,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Art is not, as Croce thinks, devoid of the character of conceptual"
4335,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"knowledge. No, discrimination and judgment, distinction between reality"
4336,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"and unreality, is an important part of the poet's work, and to say that"
4337,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"it matters little what the poet thinks or says or concludes, that"
4338,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"correct ideas, judgments, statements, are not to be sought from him, is"
4339,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,to reduce him to the level of a babbling child. The ideality of poetry
4340,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"does not, as Croce thinks, disappear as soon as reflection and judgment"
4341,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"enter, for these may be bathed in ecstasy. Croce's definition of"
4342,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"imaginative literature excludes ideas, except as casually introduced, or"
4343,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,as the utterances in accordance with the truth of the character
4344,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,portrayed. He levels literature to a primitive degree.
4345,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4346,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Croce seems to think that art is expression of only intuition, but is"
4347,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,not expression of intellectual concepts which he claims belong to
4348,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,philosophy. He who did so much to clear away the artificial divisions
4349,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"reigning in the various arts, commits a greater error. He assigns one"
4350,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,kind of expression--intuition--to one branch of human endeavor--art; and
4351,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,another kind of expression--true concepts--to another branch of human
4352,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"endeavor,--logic. Yet he admits that intuition and concepts are two"
4353,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"moments in a single process. As a matter of fact, expressed concepts are"
4354,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"also literature when emotionalized, and logic is poetry when combined"
4355,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,with ecstasy.
4356,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4357,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Man cannot separate the two faculties, and we seldom have what Croce"
4358,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"calls pure intuition, that is, knowledge free of concepts. Hence poetry"
4359,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,scarcely deals with intuition in Croce's understanding of the term.
4360,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Croce takes care to distinguish intuition from mere physical sensation,"
4361,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,and from association. For him intuition is not unconscious memory but
4362,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,the first degree of the mind's activity which is expression. One fails
4363,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,to see why even sensation may not be intuition and hence art; some of
4364,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,the world's best literature describes hunger. And to deny that intuition
4365,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,includes unconscious memory is to deprive it of its essential quality.
4366,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4367,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Croce lost sight of the importance of that phase of art which deals with
4368,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the thinking man who feels, and he tried to bridge over the gap by"
4369,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,asserting that what determined the difference of the intellectual and
4370,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"intuitive fact lay in the result, in the effects aimed at by their"
4371,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,authors. Yet Virgil thought he was a poet in his _Georgics_ but he gave
4372,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,us a book in farming instead. Plato sought to be a philosopher in his
4373,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,_Banquet_ but he wrote a poem also.
4374,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4375,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Croce's conclusions lead to strange anomalies. His view that
4376,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"philosophical passages, that is, intellectual concepts occurring in a"
4377,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"novel or play, become part of the intuition of the author, would mean"
4378,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"that the most unecstatic concept transposed from, say Hegel, to a"
4379,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"Shakespearean play, becomes intuition. The converse would also follow"
4380,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,that a passage of Shakespeare incorporated in Hegel is no longer poetry.
4381,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4382,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,One of the results of Croce's aesthetic views on intuition is to drive
4383,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,out of literary criticism the exercise of the intellect. He would have
4384,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,us judge a book by its own standards and merely seek to find if the
4385,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,author succeeded in doing what he intended. This view has been wrongly
4386,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"attributed also to Goethe and Carlyle. It is, however, Maupassant's view"
4387,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,about the novel as he expounded it in his preface to _Pierre and Jean_.
4388,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,We cannot accept this view. We must ask why does the author intend what
4389,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"he does, and is he justified in his intentions? We must go back of his"
4390,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,intentions and show him that his intellect and outlook are due to
4391,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"certain causes and we must state whether or not we agree with him, and"
4392,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,why. An author may record his ecstasy in expounding absurd ideas. I
4393,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,want to know why he believes in these ideas and I want to see if he can
4394,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"make me believe them. If he does not, I cannot satisfy myself with"
4395,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"studying his intentions, even when they are in the form of verse or in a"
4396,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,novel. I also am concerned with the question whether he is right in
4397,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"accepting these ideas, though I admit his sincerity."
4398,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4399,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Again I take up a Puritanical poem. I cannot judge the author by merely
4400,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,studying the writer's intentions and contenting myself with the
4401,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"knowledge that he has faithfully and beautifully recorded them. No, I"
4402,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,want to know why he is a Puritan; I seek to show the folly of his
4403,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,expression; I must register my protest that I have not been moved by
4404,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"him, that I consider him intellectually and morally deficient."
4405,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4406,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"The great fault of Croce's views, however, is that in looking upon art"
4407,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,as expression he takes no interest in the question whether it meets with
4408,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,sympathy. It is true he recognizes that the poet often expresses our own
4409,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"intuitions for us, when he expresses his own. But he is not concerned"
4410,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,with the question whether the poet has a right to feel that way and
4411,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,whether he has a sympathetic audience no matter how small. Yet the
4412,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,artist who expresses his intuitions is always bound to have some
4413,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"audience. It is because ""every atom that belongs to me as good belongs"
4414,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"to you."" He is bound to have sympathizers. If Croce had said that the"
4415,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,artist should not be concerned because the majority does not agree with
4416,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"him, we could follow him, but only because we think the artist is right"
4417,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,and the majority is wrong. But to cast aside the question of sympathy
4418,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"altogether, to refuse to take into consideration the emotions of any"
4419,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"readers, is to demoralize art and cast intelligence out of it."
4420,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4421,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,It cannot be repeated then too often that poetry is not a matter of
4422,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"emotions only, but of intellectual perception and moral outlook as well."
4423,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,The poet who has described a painful episode in his life does not always
4424,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"just merely record the pain, he goes further than his intuition. He"
4425,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,thinks and judges and condemns and plans. He is also a philosopher and a
4426,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"moralist, excited to such states by his intuition. It wasn't intuition"
4427,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"that created the plays of Shakespeare and Ibsen, it was a moral and"
4428,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"intellectual vision working with the poet's intuition. Logic, science,"
4429,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"metaphysics, ethics, are part of the poetic material. All ideas are"
4430,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"philosophic or scientific, and emotionally and beautifully expressed may"
4431,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,become poetry or literature.
4432,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4433,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"However, Croce did good service in calling for the independence of art,"
4434,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,since reformers and moralists often seek to force upon art a practical
4435,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,end outside and beside it. He also admits that the practical and
4436,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"aesthetic are often found united, and that it would be erroneous to"
4437,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,maintain that the artist's independence of vision should be extended to
4438,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the communication. ""If art be understood as the externalization of art,"
4439,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,then utility and morality have a perfect right to deal with it; that is
4440,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"to say, the right one possesses to deal with one's own household."" Since"
4441,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"the artist selects from his intuitions when he writes, his selection is"
4442,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,governed by the economic conditions of life and of its moral direction.
4443,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,Hence Croce finds the artist's use of the concepts of morality to some
4444,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,extent justified.
4445,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4446,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"But where the ideas dealt with by an author are such as all accept, the"
4447,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,beauty of the work depends on the manner in which it is written. Here he
4448,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"does not write for the purpose of the underlying idea, which he uses"
4449,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,merely as a pretext for artistic work. He seeks to portray an emotion
4450,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,and to make the reader feel it. Drawing a picture may be the object of
4451,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,the author. He may merely try to reproduce with vividness what we all
4452,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,see; or narrate what we all know. The importance of his work lies then
4453,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,in its technique. There is no question that technique is always to be
4454,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,considered in determining one's greatness as a writer.
4455,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4456,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,What distinguishes the layman from the artist is that the former has no
4457,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,power of craftsmanship; he does not understand the secrets of any of the
4458,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,forms of literature; he does not know how to set down his thoughts or
4459,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,sentiments in a pleasing or beautiful manner. There are many laymen who
4460,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,have better views on morality and who possess a greater intellect than
4461,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"many successful authors, but they are not artists. If by knowing how to"
4462,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"tell a story or sing a poem they could move the world,--if they had"
4463,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"craftsmanship,--then we would call them artists."
4464,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,
4465,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"It does not follow, however, that because an author has certain"
4466,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"technical genius, but is destitute of any intellect, and dallies with"
4467,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,"trite ideas, that he is a great artist. To rank among the great artists"
4468,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,perfection of form should be welded with great and important ideas of
4469,POETRY RISES ABOVE ART FOR ART'S SAKE AND INTUITION,life.

4509,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Poetry which champions human liberty and shows characters battling for

4530,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,that is still too ideal to be grasped by the age. No worthy poet to-day
4531,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,would write a poem merely to teach us simple precepts of morality. In a
4532,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"rude age, an emotional treatment of the most commonplace ethical maxims"
4533,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,was great poetry because these were in advance of the age. To us such a

4541,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"revenge and war, as the old primeval poets do. When we think of the"
4542,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"ideal poet, it is not the champion of the middle class like Longfellow"
4543,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and Tennyson, or one full of the early martial spirit and drawing"
4544,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"fighting heroes like the author of _Beowulf_, or the _Nibelungen Lied_."
4545,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Nor do we think of the poet who incorporates the religious errors and
4546,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"legends of his time and imitates ancient epics, nor of one who portrays"
4547,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"a preceding and bygone age. We, or at least a few of us, like to think"
4548,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of him as a man drawing people in the grip of passions and battling for
4549,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"advanced ideas. We like to think of men like Shakespeare and Ibsen,"
4550,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Isaiah and Job, Balzac and Cervantes, Molière and Goethe, Byron and"
4551,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Shelley, Burns and Heine, Whitman and Swinburne, Carducci and Nietzsche,"
4552,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Carlyle and Ruskin, Dostoievsky and Dickens, Hugo and Rolland. We like"
4553,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to think chiefly of men who were largely personal in their appeal, and"
4554,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"depicted their own sufferings, and described grief brought about by the"
4555,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,social construction of society which they criticized. Such poets are no
4556,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,dalliers with anaemic feelings. They felt what they sang and were not
4557,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,afraid to give sway to their emotions and ideas. They are not
4558,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"didacticists nor moralists, but emotional thinkers. They do not think"
4559,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,that they ought to deny the claims of the intellect and the moral
4560,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,vision. I do not say that other kinds of emotional writers are not great
4561,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets. I merely cite what I think is a high order of poetry. I do not
4562,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,deny that poets may avoid any moral mission and just sing private
4563,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotions, whether in prose or verse. The Troubadours, and the Roman"
4564,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Elegists, De Musset and Verlaine, Hafiz and Keats, are among the very"
4565,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"greatest poets, even though they are not prophets."
4566,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4567,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Much of our so-called democratic poetry is not democratic at all. Poetry
4568,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,does not become democratic because some poets dwell on the privileges
4569,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the working people of to-day have in contrast with those working people
4570,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"had generations ago, or because writers have discovered that even common"
4571,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,people experience most of the emotions of the upper class. Literature
4572,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"cannot be democratic, while poets write for the few who use them as"
4573,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"tools for their own interests, to defend a system which is courteously"
4574,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,called competition instead of exploitation. Much of our democratic
4575,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,literature is either capitalistic or bourgeois literature that gives a
4576,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,slight condescending nod to the proletariat. Many wealthy and cultured
4577,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,authors have taken up the cause of the laborer just as they would that
4578,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of caged animals. They have suggested improvements in the treatment of
4579,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"captives, but not complete freedom. Fortunately we have had works like"
4580,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Galsworthy's _Strife_, Hauptmann's _Weavers_, Verhaeren's _Dawn_,"
4581,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Sinclair's _Jungle_, Zola's _Germinal_, Gissing's _Nether World_."
4582,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4583,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Poetry will tend to become international, and instead of seeking to"
4584,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"encourage national prejudices, will seek to eradicate them. Race"
4585,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,prejudice is one of the deepest rooted prejudices which inferior poets
4586,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,often encourage. The old idea that the man of another country is a
4587,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"barbarian and that the alien is an enemy within our gates, a tolerated,"
4588,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"unwelcome guest, must be eradicated. Can any one contemplate without"
4589,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"disgust plays and photoplays that depict Chinese, Japanese, Negroes and"
4590,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Jews as criminals, simply because of their creed or color? Is it true"
4591,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,that virtue resides in the breast of the Aryan race only? The eighteenth
4592,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,century idea of the brotherhood of man is not extinct and the future
4593,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,will use poetry to spread this idea. Poetry should not foster hatred of
4594,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,people because they are followers of different customs.
4595,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4596,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,It can hardly be doubted that the poetry of the future will deal more
4597,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,with the emotions as experienced by the proletariat class. The feelings
4598,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,to which many of our greatest poets have given vent in recent years have
4599,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"been those of the middle and capitalistic class, just as bards in the"
4600,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"past voiced the emotions of the feudalist lords, and religious and"
4601,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,military leaders. The connection between economics and literature or
4602,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry is not as remote as it seems. Bernard Shaw has made use of his
4603,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"knowledge of the subject in constructing his plays. The work of Gorki,"
4604,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Hauptmann and Zola has taken into consideration the feelings that the
4605,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,average working people go through in their struggle for existence. Yet
4606,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the works of these writers are art or poetry, and not tracts. Literature"
4607,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,written to encourage the working men in their abject and ill-paid
4608,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,condition will not be countenanced by the future. The songs of the poet
4609,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,with lily white hands who writes about the dignity of toil and
4610,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,subservience to the employer will disappear. The emotions connected with
4611,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the struggle for a living and with a desire for a more equitable
4612,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"distribution of wealth, will be the subject of our poetry."
4613,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4614,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Much of the old poetry should be discouraged for it is debased and
4615,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"undemocratic. Take the themes of the epics of India, Persia, Ireland,"
4616,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"England, Greece, Finland, Rome, Italy, Spain, Germany and Iceland, all"
4617,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of which are lauded as among the greatest literary productions of the
4618,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"world. Wars are the subjects, fighters are the heroes. The lust for"
4619,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,fighting is encouraged instead of being decried. While all of these
4620,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,epics contain beautiful passages and poems of glowing and even
4621,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"unsurpassed beauty, they keep man back in the primitive stage, and"
4622,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,countenance a state of barbarism that he should outgrow.
4623,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4624,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,It may after all be fortunate that the earliest poetry of nations is
4625,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"seldom read, for most of it is of very little intellectual value,"
4626,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,celebrating the wars and religions of the writers. Occasionally there
4627,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,are secular poems of modern and universal interest among them. But for
4628,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the most part, fighting absorbs the writers and all their interests are"
4629,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"in bloodshed, revenge, cruelty. There are many causes fostering the"
4630,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"hatreds and errors of our day, without our using these old works to"
4631,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"spread them. We find there silly codes of honor, idiotic conceptions of"
4632,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"justice, amazing viewpoints of morality. We want the emotions celebrated"
4633,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,in these old works to die out and not to be perpetuated.
4634,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4635,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"The world of democracy belongs to poetry, not merely the democracy of"
4636,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the realistic novel which was willing to concede that even the poor man
4637,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,like the old kings and the nobility had love tragedies. Poetry will deal
4638,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"not with that philanthropy, which often means the master throwing crumbs"
4639,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to quiet the growling servant. No, it will be based on feelings that"
4640,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,emanate from a sincere desire to promote human justice. There is no
4641,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,doubt that some day our system of society which permits a man to roll up
4642,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"billions which he squanders, while it does not allow another enough to"
4643,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"keep himself and his family in comfort, will disappear, and poetry will"
4644,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,express the emotions prevalent under the new order.
4645,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4646,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Much of the poetry of the past has sung the praises of wage slavery. The
4647,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry of the future will sing as Amos did of old the beauty of social
4648,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and economic equality. To-day the hero of the poem is the successful
4649,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"business man, or the submissive contented working man, just as in the"
4650,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,past the soldier and the monk were the heroes. To-morrow it will be the
4651,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,man who fights for economic justice for himself or the masses. Our
4652,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,standards of economic justice are changing and this change will effect
4653,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry. The poet who sings in defense of the capitalist or our economic
4654,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,system has little in common with him who is the spokesman of the common
4655,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,people.
4656,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4657,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Poetry springs from the people and must take into consideration their
4658,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,emotions in connection with their economic problems. Very little of the
4659,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry of the past has done this. Consider the literature of the middle
4660,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,ages and note how seldom the troubles of the serfs and villains were
4661,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,expressed by the poets. There were slight efforts made in the thirteenth
4662,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and fourteenth centuries, in the _Romance of the Rose_ and in Langland's"
4663,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"_Piers Plowman_, respectively, to give some expression to the feelings"
4664,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of the masses.
4665,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4666,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Modern poetry tends to deal emotionally with social problems. The poet
4667,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"who calls attention to the suffering of the poor, or the persecutions of"
4668,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"reformers, or shows the ills in family life brought about by our"
4669,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"marriage system, or announces a social message, is not a propagandist"
4670,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,when he writes something that evokes our emotions. When Untermeyer
4671,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,published his book on poetry he was much criticized for the prominence
4672,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"he gave to James Oppenheim and Arthur Giovanitti, who are excellent"
4673,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets. It is to be regretted that Untermeyer did not include also a
4674,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,chapter on Horace Traubel. Untermeyer may insist too much on the social
4675,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"mission of poetry, but he is nearer to an exalted conception of poetry"
4676,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,than those who weld words to metre and have neither ideas nor substance
4677,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,in their writing.
4678,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4679,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Emerson said, ""There is no subject that does not belong to him (the"
4680,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poet),--politics, economics, manufactures and stock brokerage; as much"
4681,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"as sunsets and souls; only these things, placed in their order, are"
4682,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry; displaced, or put in kitchen order, they are unpoetic."""

4684,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"An English clergyman, F. W. Robertson, in his two lectures on the"

4686,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"posthumously collected in _Lectures and Essays_, gave vent to many"
4687,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,remarkable ideas on the subject of poetry. The following passage was
4688,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"written three years before the _Leaves of Grass_, and sums up Whitman's"
4689,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"ideas, and is worthy of quotation to-day for its timeliness:"
4690,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4691,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The Poetry of the coming age must come from the Working
4692,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Classes. In the upper ranks, Poetry, so far at least as it"
4693,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"represents their life, has long been worn out, sickly and"
4694,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,sentimental. Its manhood is effete. Feudal aristocracy with
4695,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"its associations, the castle and the tournament, has passed"
4696,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,away. Its last healthy tones came from the harp of Scott.
4697,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Byron sang its funeral dirge. But tenderness, and heroism, and"
4698,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"endurance still want their voice, and it must come from the"
4699,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"classes whose observation is at first hand, and who speak"
4700,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,fresh from nature's heart. What has poetry to do with our
4701,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Working Classes? Men of work! We want our poetry from
4702,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,you--from men who will dare to live a brave and true  life;----
4703,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4704,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,It does not follow that individualism in poetry will die out and that
4705,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,ignorant laborers are to be the sole heroes and subjects of poetry. The
4706,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,intellectual reader will still find in poetry his intellectual heroes.
4707,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"There will never be equality of intellect, and hence there will also be"
4708,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,something of an intellectual aristocracy in connection with the
4709,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,literature and poetry of democracy.
4710,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4711,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The note of ecstasy as a passion for righteousness and social justice is
4712,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of a high order usually. It was this note in which Greek and Roman
4713,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry, however, was deficient. It is this ecstasy that raises the"
4714,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,prophetic portions of the Bible to the high plane they occupy.
4715,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4716,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Professor Butcher, surely one in sympathy with Greek art, pointed out"
4717,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the weakness of Greek criticism, in that it failed to consider the"
4718,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,social state in connection with the work of art. This state of criticism
4719,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,was due to the fact that the poetry of the Greeks showed no deep
4720,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"interest in social justice. Pindar, the greatest lyricist of the Greeks,"
4721,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,wrote about athletic contests; athletes were his heroes. The Greeks
4722,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"glorified healthy bodies in their poetry, an exalted feature"
4723,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"undoubtedly. Homer wrote about wars, and Achilles remained the type of"
4724,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Greek hero. Æschylus dwelt on the laws of divine retribution for
4725,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,indulgence in crime. Sophocles contemplated the irony of fate. Sappho
4726,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,recorded her love troubles.
4727,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4728,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The only exception of a work treating of poetry in connection with
4729,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"social justice is Plato's _Republic_, and he concluded that the poet was"
4730,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,unnecessary. Yet he himself is one of the few Greek poets who showed
4731,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,deep interest in social justice.
4732,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4733,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The first critic who pointed out the connection between poetry and
4734,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"social conditions was the author of _On the Sublime_, who ends his"
4735,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,treatise with a beautiful attack on the love of money which hinders the
4736,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,development of good art. This is the first passage in pagan antiquity to
4737,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,point out the evils of commercialism in connection with art.
4738,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4739,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,None of the Greek poets (except perhaps Aristophanes) thought it worthy
4740,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"of their art to cry out against the social abuses of the time, and to"
4741,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,lament the existence of wrong. The Roman satires alone in pagan
4742,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"literature approached, though weakly, the ecstasy for social justice in"
4743,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the prophecies of the Bible. The prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah rank
4744,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,higher than most of the Greek poems because they show a social
4745,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,consciousness steeped in emotion. Passages like these are Hebraic and
4746,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"not Greek. ""Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to"
4747,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the"

4755,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4756,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Fénelon in a famous passage eloquently proclaimed the superiority of
4757,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Hebrew poetry to Greek poetry. Heine, a pronounced Hellenist, came to"
4758,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the final conclusion that the Greeks were children and the Hebrews men.
4759,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4760,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The Hebrew idea of righteousness was a different one from the later
4761,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Christian notion of consciousness of sin. The latter was really a
4762,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"perversion of the former, and ended rather in social injustices as the"
4763,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,history of the medieval ages shows.
4764,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4765,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"The discussion in regard to the merits of poetry with a mission, or"
4766,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry that is purely aesthetic, was revived on the occasion of the"
4767,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,publication of Untermeyer's book _The New Era in American Poetry_. His
4768,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,critics made the mistake of thinking that those who want poetry to deal
4769,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"with social ideas are not ready to recognize poems that are beautiful,"
4770,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"or convey an emotion, even if there is little intellectual content"
4771,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"behind the work. There is no social message in Poe's _Raven_, for"
4772,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"example, but I could not imagine Untermeyer not being moved by that"
4773,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poem, for it digs down into the emotions; it was written out of Poe's"
4774,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,tragic life and finds a response in us all. Untermeyer has not been
4775,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,tardy in his appreciation of poets without a message like Frost and
4776,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Robinson. In fact Untermeyer ignores quite a number of Revolutionary
4777,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets.

4779,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The reader may say that a new social idea in poetry is just as bad as an
4780,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"old moral saw, in that they are both didactic. It all depends on the"
4781,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"ecstatic presentation, but I think that an idea that is advanced and"
4782,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,unrecognized is by virtue of its novelty and truth more capable of
4783,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,swaying the emotion that we call poetic than the repetition of a
4784,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,hackneyed ethical maxim which every child knows and hears usually
4785,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,without emotion. Ibsen's plays are poetry not only because of the
4786,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"treatment, but because of the ideas there, while many of the English"
4787,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,eighteenth century moralists in verse are poets neither in treatment nor
4788,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,ideas.
4789,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4790,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The only country where critics have had almost no use for the theory of
4791,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,art for art's sake has been Russia. Here they have also had no such
4792,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,compromising views that seek to know only whether the poet has done his
4793,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"work well, and whether he has delivered his message irrespective of its"
4794,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"value, importance or truth. The Russian critics were men who were"
4795,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"interested in the connection between life and poetry, and never failed"
4796,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,to have their eye on the former while considering the latter. They did
4797,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"more, they had their eye on the future, and hence were usually liberal."
4798,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"We know very little about these Russian critics, and only recently has"
4799,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the nature of their work been outlined by Thomas G. Masaryk, who before"
4800,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the war published _The Spirit of Russia_ just translated into English.
4801,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Previously Kropotkin and a few historians of Russian literature had
4802,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,touched on their work. Some day perhaps we may be so fortunate as to
4803,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"have translations into English of the works of Bielinski,"
4804,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Tchernishevski, Dobrolubov, Pisarev and Mihailovsky. To these men art"
4805,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"was a serious thing, and they would not have its value lost in"
4806,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"metaphysical theories of aesthetics about beauty, in endless discussions"
4807,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,about the niceties and importance of metrical forms. Poetry dealt with
4808,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,social problems and suggested changes in society. Its mission was to
4809,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,deal with the unbared human soul and above all not to lie and affect.
4810,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4811,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Every one has conceived the function of poetry as being something
4812,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"different, usually as something to spread his own views. Thus the"
4813,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"theologian looks upon it as a handmaid of religion, to show the beauty"
4814,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of a dogma and a peculiar view of life in accordance with his religion.
4815,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The voluptuary thinks it merely a means of arousing sexual morality.
4816,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Some philosophers think it a vehicle to promulgate their own systems.
4817,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Thus Nietzsche believed poetry should spread the gospel of the will to
4818,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"power, while Schopenhauer thought it reached its highest point when it"
4819,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,glorified the denial of the will to live.
4820,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4821,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The world can never be fully agreed as to what poetry is any more than
4822,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"it can agree as to what beauty, truth, or duty is. A passage may appeal"
4823,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to one person and not to another. It all depends on the beliefs, tastes,"
4824,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"experiences and education of the reader. Patriotic and religious poetry,"
4825,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"whether in verse or prose, falls flat on the internationalist and free"
4826,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"thinker respectively, because they do not adore the sentiments therein,"
4827,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,though they might admit the beauty of the writing and recognize the
4828,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,appeal it makes to those who are in accord with the writer. They cannot
4829,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,be responsive to the soul of the singer because they are differently
4830,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,constituted in their beliefs and because the ideas that aroused in the
4831,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poet one train of emotions, move them to a contrary passion."
4832,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4833,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Let us take a hypothetical case. A man a few centuries ago was
4834,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,sentenced to be burned at the stake for his religious beliefs. A poet
4835,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,who approved of this course wrote a poem where his emotions are
4836,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,crystallized. He was sorry for the victim and hoped God would pardon him
4837,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and make him see the error of his ways. He praised the executioner who
4838,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,himself was grieved that he had to take this course to save the
4839,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,infidel's soul. He was certain that God was pleased with the sentence.
4840,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,He deplored the evil effects that might follow if this man were allowed
4841,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to live to spread his infamous doctrines, he rebuked the man for the"
4842,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,trouble he brought on his family. On the whole he gave us a metrical and
4843,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotional composition actually describing his sensations, not even"
4844,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,omitting sympathetic reference to the sufferings of the victim. This was
4845,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry to those thousands that day who approved of this act. But most of
4846,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,us cannot to-day enter into the ecstasy of the writer; it is not poetry
4847,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to us. But while people to-day are not burned at the stake, they are"
4848,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"persecuted for advancing ideas that are beyond the public. The poets,"
4849,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"who are on a low level of thought with the public, in writing poems"
4850,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"against such individuals or the ideas or cause represented by them, are"
4851,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,not poets to those who support the persecuted individual or his ideas.
4852,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Most poets still write in defense of burning at the stake of great
4853,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"humanitarians, but they advocate other measures than burning by real"
4854,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,fire.
4855,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4856,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,When Ibsen said in reply to the critic who would not allow _Peer Gynt_
4857,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to be called poetry, that the definition of poetry would have to be"
4858,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"changed to take in his poem, he was stating a condition that always"
4859,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,takes place when a new poetic masterpiece appears. The conception as to
4860,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"what is poetry always changes, for what moves man in one age does not"
4861,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,move him in another. The poets often have to do what Whitman and
4862,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Wordsworth did, create the tastes by which they are to be enjoyed. We"
4863,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,are all aware that in the eighteenth century poetry meant something
4864,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,entirely different from what we believe it to be to-day. Many men were
4865,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,considered poets then whom we do not regard as such. The same is true of
4866,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry in prose. There was hostility to the poetry in the novels of
4867,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Balzac, Flaubert and Zola, because the public did not want to accept"
4868,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"their artistic innovations, their frankness and their views."
4869,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4870,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Yeats in his essay ""What is Popular Poetry"" in the _Ideas of Good and"
4871,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Evil_, said that poetry of a very high order, like the _Epipsychidion_,"
4872,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"is not popular for it presupposes more than it says. All good poetry,"
4873,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"whether springing from a written or an unwritten tradition, is always"
4874,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"""strange and obscure, and unreal to all who have not understanding,"" and"
4875,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"suggests remembrance of impossible things, and glimmers with thoughts"
4876,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and images dating back to unknown history.
4877,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4878,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,There is a great deal of literature or poetry which presupposes some
4879,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"culture, and a sensitiveness to beauty, and especially a highly"
4880,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"developed intellect. The man with the commonplace mind, even though he"
4881,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"be educated and well read, is often unable to appreciate the beauty of"
4882,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry in which new and advanced and unpopular ideas are held in
4883,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,solution. The poetry in the work of Whitman and Nietzsche and Ibsen was
4884,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,not felt by people who could not enter into the spirit of their revolt
4885,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,from contemporary morality. The public cannot appreciate the prose
4886,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry of Hearn because of his rich language and aesthetic
4887,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,sensitiveness.
4888,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4889,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The public can take an interest in the beauty and poetry of ideas it
4890,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"understands, and written in language that it speaks and in images that"
4891,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,it uses; but the poet is often at his best an aristocrat in thought and
4892,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"language, and then it takes a well trained individual reader to like"
4893,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"him. Poetry is no longer mere folklore or ballads or musical numbers,"
4894,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,all of which the public may enjoy.
4895,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4896,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,There is no such thing as absolute truth. Truth is only a relative term.
4897,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,When a man speaks of the truth he means those doctrines which he himself
4898,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"embraces. Every man believes that the views that he entertains are true,"
4899,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,otherwise he would not hold them. Many people have in the past died for
4900,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the ""truth,"" when we know that they upheld falsehood."
4901,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4902,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,A writer who is liberally inclined will hold liberal ideas to be the
4903,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,truth; a conservative regards only conservative views as true. An author
4904,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"who embraces ideas from both the conventional and radical spheres,"
4905,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,considers only those books as true whose authors do the same thing.
4906,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4907,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"In a sane essay on De Vigny, Mill makes a remarkable distinction between"
4908,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the conservative and radical poet, concluding that the greatest poet"
4909,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"will always partake of the nature of both, mentioning as example Balzac"
4910,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and De Vigny. Had he written on the subject a half-century later he
4911,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"might have named Ibsen, whose _Brond_ and _Wild Duck_ are good"
4912,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"conservative poems. Mill, who was no disciple of art for art's sake,"
4913,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"said that the radical poet will paint passionate love, ""will show it at"
4914,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"war with the forms and customs of society, nay even with its laws and"
4915,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"religion, if the laws and tenets which regulate that branch of human"
4916,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"relations are among those which have begun to be murmured against."" ""To"
4917,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"him, whatever exists will appear from that alone fit to be represented:"
4918,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to probe the wounds of society and humanity is part of his business, and"
4919,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"he will neither shrink from exhibiting what is in nature, because it is"
4920,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"morally culpable, nor because it is physically revolting."" Here Mill"
4921,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"anticipates Zola, Ibsen and Freud. No wonder that so radical a critic as"
4922,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Brandes was attracted to him. It is a pity he did not continue literary
4923,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,criticism.
4924,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4925,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,It is probably vain to try to define different types of poetic or
4926,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"literary excellence, but we may state some of these. Formerly a"
4927,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,first-class poet was one who successfully imitated a model and followed
4928,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,certain rules. Or he was one who successfully voiced the current
4929,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,accepted views of the age. It is these reasons that still make many
4930,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,people consider Dante and Milton among the first-class poets. Again
4931,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,there is a tendency to regard as poets of the first class those who
4932,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,perfected their art technically. Hence Æschylus and Sophocles are ranked
4933,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,among the greatest poets. Sometimes he is regarded among the greatest
4934,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poets because he is among the earliest, like Homer. The position of"
4935,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poets like Shakespeare, Molière, Cervantes and Goethe as first-class"
4936,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"world poets and writers, cannot be contested, because they are so"
4937,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,universal.
4938,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4939,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Under the influence of Ibsen, Shaw in his preface to a new edition of"
4940,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,his novel _The Irrational Knot_ laid down an interesting distinction
4941,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,between literature of the first and of the second order. The distinction
4942,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,applies to poetry as well. Shaw considered as literature of the first
4943,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"order work which makes a distinct original contribution to morality,"
4944,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,even if such writing is literary criticism. He regards the writers who
4945,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,accept ready-made morality as of the second order. Shaw admits that
4946,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,writers of the first order are often less readable and less constructive
4947,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,than writers of the second order. He mentions among writers of the first
4948,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"order, Ibsen, Euripides, Byron, Wilde and La Rochefoucauld, and"
4949,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Shakespeare in _Hamlet_. From prefaces in other books of his we know he
4950,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"would include men like Blake, Shelley, Nietzsche, and Butler. As"
4951,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"writers of the second order he mentions Shakespeare, Scott, Dumas,"
4952,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Dickens, Ruskin, Carlyle, and he would no doubt include writers like"
4953,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Macaulay and Holmes. He does not mean that a writer of the first order
4954,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"is always greater than one of the second order, but he does insist as"
4955,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"follows: ""No man who shuts his eyes and opens his mouth when religion"
4956,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and morality are offered to him on a long spoon, can share the same"
4957,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Parnassian bench with those who make an original contribution to
4958,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"religion and morality, were it only a criticism."" In spite of the"
4959,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,contention of the art for art's sake school that poetry has nothing to
4960,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"do with morality or religion, the greatest poets are those authors of"
4961,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the literature of ecstasy who championed new ideas, fought for liberty"
4962,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"in their works, expressed the advanced ideas of the age, and gave us a"
4963,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,new and more liberal outlook on life. While it is true that often poets
4964,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of the second order have expressed strongly and movingly just the common
4965,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"sentiments of everybody, on the whole the original poets rank higher. It"
4966,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"is this which puts Whitman above Longfellow, Nietzsche above Macaulay,"
4967,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Byron and Shelley above Tennyson and Rossetti, Ibsen above Scott. Yet"
4968,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,there are many poets who made no distinct original contribution to a new
4969,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"morality, but expressed common emotions so humanely, and powerfully,"
4970,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,that we think of them as poets of a very high order. The Dickens of the
4971,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,_Christmas Carol_ and the Burns of the love songs were not original but
4972,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,they are great nevertheless by the infectious depicting of universal
4973,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotion, which is always of highest importance in literature. Though"
4974,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,there is nothing new in a novel like _Eugénie Grandet_ but a wonderful
4975,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"description of a miser, it is poetry of a very high order, for an"
4976,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,account of a passion in an intense manner is great poetry. Most of
4977,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Hafiz's poems record his loves, but though he was a liberal and against"
4978,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the asceticism of his day, he was in the main not an exponent of"
4979,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"anything new; nevertheless, he is a poet of a high order."
4980,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4981,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,The world usually does not recognize the original poet and accepts a
4982,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poet of the second order as one of the first order, but posterity"
4983,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,adjusts the matter. Shelley and Ibsen finally won their places and I
4984,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,think to-day the growing coldness to Scott and Tennyson is due to their
4985,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,lacking in great original ideas.
4986,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4987,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"We need not agree with Shaw when he says that Dickens, Ruskin and"
4988,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Carlyle made no contributions to the morality of their day. The
4989,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"humanitarian reforms suggested by Dickens' novels, the conceptions about"
4990,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"sincerity in history, and the importance of individualism and the heroic"
4991,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Carlyle and Ruskin's views in art criticism and economics, were all"
4992,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"original. They all had in addition the great power of expression, and"
4993,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"though they were not always very profound in their views, they are poets"
4994,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of a high order.
4995,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
4996,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"A poet, then, is of the first order if he expresses in prose the ecstasy"
4997,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,connected with a great original idea of social justice far in advance of
4998,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,his age.
4999,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5000,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"There is an opinion ruling among academic circles, also derived from"
5001,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Aristotle, that poetry is the highest form of literature, and that a"
5002,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"verse epic, drama or lyric is, when at its best, always better than any"
5003,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,work in prose. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Who would say
5004,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"that great novels like _Don Quixote_, great plays like Ibsen's, great"
5005,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,essays like Montaigne's are not superior as literature to many of the
5006,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,best known verse productions. Nor must we assume that the literature of
5007,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotion or ecstasy, whether in prose or verse, is always the highest"
5008,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,form of literature. The literature that shows great insight into
5009,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"character, that brims most with intellectual ideas, that is universal"
5010,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and human in interest even if not emotional, ranks higher than poetry"
5011,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,which voices no ideas. You will find greater literature in books like
5012,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Taine's _History of English Literature_, or Hazlitt's essays, even in"
5013,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"those passages which do not belong to the literature of ecstasy, than in"
5014,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,many poems of James Whitcomb Riley or Longfellow. The two latter
5015,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"produced many poems that belong to the literature of emotion, but while"
5016,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"they are genuine poets, they are intellectually deficient."
5017,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5018,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Aesthetics and criticism have tended to place little aesthetic value on
5019,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the literature of ideas. A passage from Hume's _Essays_ is greater as
5020,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,literature than many verses in our magazines. Much literature consists
5021,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"of a succession of ideas or facts, no particular one of which moves us"
5022,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to ecstasy, but the work as a whole does have aesthetic value and yet is"
5023,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"not poetry, but has greater literary value than some poetry."
5024,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5025,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Neither verse poetry, nor the prose literature of ecstasy, then, is the"
5026,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,highest literature necessarily. Shakespeare was one of the greatest
5027,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poets, not only because he depicted emotions, but because his intellect,"
5028,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"his psychological insight, his universality, his personality, all"
5029,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,combine to make him the great figure he is. He would have continued to
5030,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,be as great a figure even if he had written nothing more than a diary.
5031,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,It is genius that counts and not the form one uses. To say that the
5032,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,drama or epic is the highest literary form is absurd; it may be the
5033,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"essay, if a genius is using that form."
5034,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5035,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"When we have a description of emotions, we have poetry or the literature"
5036,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of ecstasy. But profound thought may give a work more enduring qualities
5037,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"than ecstasy. A love song by Burns is wonderfully sweet, but I can see"
5038,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"no reason why, because it is poetry, we must say that it is a greater"
5039,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,piece of literature than even an emotional prose passage out of
5040,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Nietzsche or Carlyle at their best. Goethe's prose essays are profound
5041,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and are often greater as literature than his lyrics. There are
5042,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,intellectual passages in _Wilhelm Meister_ that are superior as
5043,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,literature to emotional scenes in _Faust_ as literature.
5044,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5045,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Critics like Henry Newbolt are supporting the view that poetry must be
5046,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,in touch with life. Though he clings to the idea that poetry and rhythm
5047,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,go together he thinks that the natural tendency of poetic rhythm will be
5048,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"towards perpetual change; the value of his book, however, consists"
5049,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"especially in a chapter on ""Poetry and Politics."" He recognizes that"
5050,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,both reason and intuition play a part in poetry; men are not divided
5051,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"into men of thought and men of feeling, the one speaking the language of"
5052,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"science, the other that of poetry. If man is a reasoning animal, he also"
5053,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,is a creature of instinct as well as of thought. Hence poetry depends on
5054,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"science, the facts of which become part of our imagination. The poet"
5055,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,builds a more livable world; he may write great political poetry if he
5056,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,does not become a partisan. Poetry seeks to change human feeling; that
5057,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"is what the Prophets did, and they were in a sense political poets."
5058,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"""Great poetry,"" says Newbolt, ""is the poetry which has the power to stir"
5059,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"many men and stir them deeply,"" but is especially great when it ""is the"
5060,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"expression of our consciousness of this world, tinged with man's"
5061,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"universal longing for a world more perfect, nearer to the heart's"
5062,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"desire."""
5063,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5064,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Newbolt finds that the reason so much religious poetry is futile is
5065,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,because it is remote from earth. But he finds in the _Psalms_ a fervor
5066,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of patriotism and moral enthusiasm that he compares to the common
5067,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"liturgical poetry ""as a great and sonorous bell to the vague whistle of"
5068,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the wind."" They preach no dogma, they are remote from practical"
5069,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"politics, they are rooted in human emotions, and are the product of no"
5070,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,particular church. That is why they always move.
5071,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5072,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Incidentally one may add that is why the great medieval Hebrew poets
5073,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"like Solomon Ibn Gebirol, Jehudah Ha Levi and Moses Ibn Ezra, are great"
5074,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets.[172:A]
5075,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5076,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Heine in his poem on _Jehuda Ben Halevi_ deplores the fact that these
5077,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,three poets are not well known to Aryan peoples. In fact the liturgical
5078,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poetry of the medieval Hebrew poets is non-sectarian and can be
5079,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,appreciated by any lover of the literature of ecstasy. Any reader of
5080,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry may be moved by Jehudah Ha Levi's _Ode to Zion_, or Bachya Ibn"
5081,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Pakuda's _My Soul_. There are able prose translations of these in B.
5082,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Halper's _Post-Biblical Hebrew Literature. An Anthology_, Vol. II."
5083,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5084,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Any one who reads the history of the poetry of a country, that is, of"
5085,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"the poetry in verse, will find much to amuse him in the alleged progress"
5086,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,made in the conventions of poetry. One poet dethrones another and the
5087,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,reader gets the impression that the later poet is always superior to the
5088,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"earlier one because he has destroyed convention, and introduced what is"
5089,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,often a minor change. The eighteenth century rated Chaucer and Spenser
5090,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"rather low, the nineteenth century killed off Dryden and Pope, Tennyson"
5091,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and Browning were assumed to have advanced upon Byron and Shelley, and"
5092,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the mid-Victorians in turn were deemed to have been supplanted by the
5093,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poets of ""the nineties."" Though a later age may make some technical"
5094,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"improvements in the art of writing poetry, it is genius that counts."
5095,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Many problems about poetry have disturbed critics since Byron died, but"
5096,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,none of the succeeding generations have been able to detract from the
5097,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"quality of poets like Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley and"
5098,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Keats. For a poet is such by virtue of his ability to convey great
5099,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotion and thought, and he does not become obsolete solely by the"
5100,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,technical innovations of a later age.
5101,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5102,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Many poets are praised for the ""note of revolt"" in their poetry, because"
5103,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,they have brought about some changes in the technical art of writing
5104,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry, or have written their poetry in a manner different from the"
5105,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,ancients only in form. But let us never lose sight of the fact that
5106,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,these changes which are considered tokens of great courage on the part
5107,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"of the innovators, amount to very little when these so-called audacious"
5108,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets remain on an intellectual and moral level with the masses and do
5109,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,not rise as high as the older poet whose vision soared ahead of his
5110,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,time.
5111,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5112,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,A poet may be great even though he uses the old machinery of the
5113,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"supernatural, even though he indulges in artificial diction, clichés and"
5114,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"stereotyped metres, for what counts in poetry is the greatness and power"
5115,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"of a human soul and personality, the ecstatic presentation of an"
5116,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"advanced point of view, his share as a battler for truth, freedom and"
5117,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"justice, the intensity and importance of his emotion. People are under"
5118,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,the impression that all the martyrs for human liberty perished in the
5119,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,medieval ages; that the world has been set free by those who gave up
5120,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"their lives to liberate humanity from kings and priests, and that there"
5121,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,is no more work to be done by poets to-day in championing human liberty.
5122,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Critics who admire Milton and Shelley as champions of liberty attack
5123,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,to-day's unpopular champions of it. It amuses one to read of the
5124,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"epithets, revolutionary and radical, applied to versifiers because they"
5125,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"have arranged a system of vowel-sounds combination in their poems, or"
5126,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"imported a metre, or broken with an old conventional metre, while the"
5127,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,substance of their poetry remains far below the intellectual and
5128,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,aesthetic level of poets who lived many centuries ago.
5129,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5130,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"But what greater poetry has been produced in the last two generations,"
5131,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"than many of the novels and prose dramas written in Russia, Germany,"
5132,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"France, Italy, England and Scandinavia? Why is there greatness in the"
5133,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"poetry in these works? Is it not because of the character drawing, the"
5134,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"delineation of great emotional conflicts, of the ecstasy bathing the"
5135,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"ideas? Would these poets have been any the less great, had they"
5136,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"continued to use the same ideas, emotions and situations, tricked out"
5137,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"even in the old conventional forms of rhyme, metre, tropes, allegories,"
5138,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"high personages, supernatural agencies? In fact plays like _Peer Gynt_"
5139,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and _The Sunken Bell_ are rather technically conventional as verse
5140,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"plays, but could any one compare with them the vapid, senseless and"
5141,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"trite lyrics created by some of our so-called modern ""revolutionary"""
5142,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,poets? The great poet who deals with the capabilities of man in
5143,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"experiencing emotion, and fears not to track the human soul, even into"
5144,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"morbid feelings, who has the courage to challenge society with ideas,"
5145,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,even though these arouse the most bitter antagonism of some of the
5146,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"leaders of society, is the man whom posterity will most enjoy, for he is"
5147,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,most human and bold and he never loses sight of the fact that he deals
5148,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"with real ecstasy, and not with the cultivated nuances of some cliques"
5149,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of versifiers.
5150,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5151,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,If the reader will make a close study of many of the revolutions in
5152,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"writing poetry, he will find that the great change often amounted to"
5153,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,nothing more than the substitution or creation of a new rhythm or trope
5154,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,for the one used by the old poet; such changes are of minor importance.
5155,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,No doubt our contemporary poets have done away with many conventions.
5156,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"They no longer employ inversions of words and phrases, nor cultivate the"
5157,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,stock poetical terms and words allowed formerly as a matter of poetic
5158,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"license. They no longer tolerate clichés such as whenas, o'er, whatime,"
5159,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"dost, 'mongst, anon, ere, morn, even, o'er, main, taen, athwart, e'en,"
5160,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"forsooth, alack, oh thou, didst, hath, perchance, methinks, steed,"
5161,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"gleeds, prithee, trow, 'neath, 'gainst, ween, wist, espy, twixt. But it"
5162,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,took them a long time to discover what the prose writers always knew;
5163,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"namely, that distorted speech should be avoided in literature. But the"
5164,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,avoidance of clichés does not make a poet.
5165,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5166,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Some of our so-called modern free verse poets like Amy Lowell are
5167,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"artificial in substance and manner, labored and uninspired, dull and"
5168,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"bookish, and lacking in human interest, ecstasy and ideas. Their"
5169,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"technique may be different from that of the old poets, but these new"
5170,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"writers often have no ideas, reveal no poetic personality, and convey no"
5171,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"emotion. Many of them are afraid of being personal, and as a result they"
5172,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,fall below even the old New England poets whom they despise. A poet like
5173,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Longfellow may be deficient in intellectual power and sympathy with
5174,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"liberal and democratic ideas, but when he tells a tale of such human"
5175,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"interest as _Evangeline_, presents an idea against war as in _The"

5178,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and we know we are reading poetry, though it has not the emancipating"
5179,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and stimulating effect of some of the work of Walt Whitman. Lafcadio
5180,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Hearn, by the way, condemned the tendency to depreciate Longfellow."
5181,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5182,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Many of our free verse writers produce no great poetry, even though they"
5183,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,write in a medium that is the proper language of poetry. The opponents
5184,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"of the free verse writers, who see no merit in many of the latter's"
5185,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"productions, are often right; these productions are not poetry because"
5186,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,they lack ecstasy and ideas. Much of the work in the old forms produced
5187,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"to-day has more ecstasy, and hence it is poetry."
5188,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5189,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Determination of the merits of the poets of eminence to-day is outside

5191,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,
5192,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,There has been much comment about the fact that we need and indeed are
5193,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,getting an American or national poetry. Now one of the things that
5194,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Whitman has overdone was this demand for poetry that is distinctly
5195,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,American. Poetry appeals to the universal element in man first. A great
5196,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,idea like a passage in the _Song of Myself_ could have been written by
5197,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,and can be appreciated by the people of another nation. A cry of
5198,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,sympathy for the sufferings of animals and man such as you find in _Out
5199,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking_ is not an American but a human note.

5203,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"unessential adjuncts, no expert or scholar will be able to tell what"
5204,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,nationality the poem represents. No one has better shown the hollowness
5205,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of the claimants for nationalism than James Russell Lowell in two essays
5206,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"on nationality in literature, one written in sympathetic review of"
5207,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Longfellow's _Kavanagh_ and collected in _The Round Table_, and another"

5210,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"Goethe, before Lowell, ridiculed the idea of purely national poetry."
5211,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"True, there are national traits and characteristics, modes of thought"
5212,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and feeling peculiar to different peoples, that enter into and"
5213,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"distinguish every literature, but these do not usually make one"
5214,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,literature so national as to be incomprehensible to other nations. When
5215,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"this does happen, the product has no universal appeal and hence is not"
5216,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,great poetry. Again poetry may have local color; it may be steeped in
5217,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"national traditions, it may express a racial philosophy but it is then"
5218,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,of value only in so far as it represents the mode of thinking and
5219,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"feeling of the rest of mankind. Poetry may be rooted in the soil, be an"
5220,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"indigenous product, depict native customs or a provincial life; it may"
5221,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"depict certain types of heroes, and glory in the country of its birth,"
5222,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and describe its richness, but all these features are incidentals. Human"
5223,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"nature is much the same the world over. Feeling is universal, though it"
5224,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"may be colored by national traits, though one nation may feel more"
5225,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"keenly, or indulge a certain emotion more frequently than others. The"
5226,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"heart and the head, the emotions and the mind, rule in writing. The _Old"
5227,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,Testament_ and Shakespeare are no longer national products for they
5228,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,speak to the whole world. They have the local color and the ideas of
5229,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"their time and depict a certain phase of life, but we all feel in"
5230,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,reading these books that they are written about ourselves and to
5231,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"ourselves. ""We have spoken too much about nationalist art, forgetting"
5232,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"that though the roots may lie in nationality and personality, the"
5233,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"results, independent of school and nation, should overleap boundaries"
5234,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,"and enter the universal heart."" (Isaac Goldberg, _Studies in"

5247,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,In the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty
5248,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,is indispensable. Liberty takes the adherence of heroes
5249,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,wherever man and woman exist--but never takes any adherence or
5250,HIGH FORM OF POETRY ECSTATIC PRESENTATION OF ADVANCED SOCIAL IDEALS,welcome from the rest more than from poets. They are the voice

5284,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5285,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Aristotle's best known contribution to literary criticism is his
5286,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,statement that tragedy has the effect of a catharsis upon the reader and
5287,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,helps him to discharge emotions of pity and fear that overburden him. We
5288,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"have considerably amplified Aristotle's views, as we include under"
5289,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"tragedy the recording of any very painful event in prose or verse, in"
5290,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,dialogue or narrative. We believe that perusing literature in general
5291,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,relieves the reader of all nerve-racking emotions and produces a
5292,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,homeopathic effect upon him by the aesthetic voicing of his unconscious
5293,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,feelings.
5294,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5295,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Professor J. E. Spingarn's book, _Literary Criticism in the"
5296,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Renaissance_, gives us a good survey of several Italian commentators who"
5297,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,correctly interpreted Aristotle's view of the purgation of the emotions
5298,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of fear and pity as aesthetic, and not ethical. The first of these"
5299,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"critics was Robortelli (1548); Vettori and Castelvetro followed him,"
5300,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,while Maggi and Varchi applied the purgation to all emotions similar to
5301,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"pity and fear, a more Freudian conception. Minturno likened the"
5302,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"purgation to the physician's method, while Speroni pointed out that pity"
5303,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and fear, holding men in bondage, were properly to be expurgated. These"
5304,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"men anticipated the great work of Bernays in the nineteenth century, who"
5305,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,destroyed the centuries-old fallacy that Aristotle had in mind the moral
5306,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,purification and reformation of the reader. Even Lessing erroneously
5307,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,thought that this was Aristotle's meaning.
5308,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5309,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Moreover, Milton, who had traveled in Italy, must have read these"
5310,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Italians when he gave us his correct interpretation of the passage in
5311,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the preface to _Samson Agonistes_. Milton properly understood
5312,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Aristotle's meaning of the function of tragedy. It was to ""temper and"
5313,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"reduce them (the passions) to just measure with a kind of delight,"
5314,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"stirred up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated."""
5315,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5316,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,We know now the true interpretation of Aristotle's view of the function
5317,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,of tragedy from a passage in his _Politics_. He was thinking of the
5318,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,relief the spectators' surcharged emotions obtained by witnessing
5319,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,similar emotions expressed. His real meaning was perceived by Henri Weil
5320,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and Jacob Bernays, two great Jewish classical scholars of Germany."
5321,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Bernays states moreover in his work,[180:A] first published in 1857,"
5322,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that any literary work telling of unhappy events has a homeopathic
5323,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"effect on the reader. This is true, for even if we do not actually"
5324,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"suffer, the capacity and possibility of suffering are latent within us."
5325,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Though Bosanquet, commenting on Bernays in his _History of Aesthetics_,"
5326,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"believes tragedy or poetry must be written in verse, he is forced to"
5327,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,admit that even _Vanity Fair_ and _Cousin Bette_ would come within the
5328,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,definition of tragedy developed by Bernays; for the reader finds his own
5329,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotions expressed in these works no less than in Sophocles and obtains
5330,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,relief when he reads them. Bosanquet further admits that any serious and
5331,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,even formless portrayal of life may be placed within Bernays's theory
5332,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"adding, ""It may indeed be admitted to be a development inherent in"
5333,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Aristotle's theory."""
5334,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5335,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Aristotle perceived that the spectator of tragedy was putting himself in
5336,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the place of the characters, living their lives emotionally and"
5337,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,sympathizing with them. Since the novel or lyric poem depicts human
5338,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"sorrow, and the reader is purged by reading these literary forms, just"
5339,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"like the spectator of tragedy, all literature has the effect of an"
5340,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,aesthetic catharsis upon the reader.
5341,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5342,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The novels of Thackeray and Balzac are poetry in parts and the emotional
5343,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,influence in reading them is the same as in seeing a tragic verse-play
5344,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"acted. Bosanquet, however, does not fully accept Aristotle's theory as"
5345,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,applied to tragic stories in prose because he regards poetical prose
5346,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,rhetoric and not poetry. Would he exclude from the domain of tragedy the
5347,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"entire episode in Hardy's _Return of the Native_, of the death of"
5348,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Eustace's mother? Hardy's tragedy is as real as the tragedies of the
5349,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Greek playwrights. The novel fulfills all the requirements of poetic
5350,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,tragedy in that the reader is purged and relieved of pity and fear and
5351,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,kindred emotions. For tragedy is not to be found only in dialogues in
5352,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"verse, but in narration and dialogue in prose, and its function is to"
5353,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"relieve us of any choking emotion, besides fear and pity."
5354,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5355,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Aristotle is the founder then of psychoanalytic interpretation of
5356,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,literature and is a forerunner of Freud. He however refers only to the
5357,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"catharsis upon the spectator, but not to that of the author's work upon"
5358,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,himself.
5359,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5360,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Every creator of tragedy in prose or verse, in fiction, essay or lyric"
5361,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,was first subject to repression and then ecstasy. We may say as
5362,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Nietzsche did, that tragic art is the reconciliation of Apollo and"
5363,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Dionysius, of dreaming and emotional intoxication, and both these"
5364,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"conditions are, in Freud's words, due to repression."
5365,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5366,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,But we have travelled far beyond Aristotle in our views of tragedy.
5367,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Freud has revolutionized the art of criticism and a disciple of his, F."
5368,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Wittels, in the _Tragische Motiv_, gave us an interpretation from the"
5369,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,psychoanalytic point of view of the nature and sufferings of tragic
5370,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,characters. There is an abstract of the book by Dr. J. S. Van Teslaar
5371,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"in the _American Journal of Psychology_ for April, 1912. Wittels shows"
5372,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that the unconscious unethical desires break into consciousness and
5373,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,cause tragedy. He points out that the Greeks were purified of pent up
5374,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emotions in the theater, and that they identified the demons of their"
5375,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,inner self in the actors. He also says that the Greek drama cannot any
5376,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"longer talk as clearly to us as of old, for with our civilization we"
5377,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,have wandered away from the naïve Greek mind. The author emphasizes the
5378,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"fact that unconscious causes make the writer compose his work, as well"
5379,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,as the fact that characters in history and literature acted from
5380,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,unconscious causes. Thus suppressed erotic impulses influenced the
5381,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,patriotism of Joan of Arc.
5382,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5383,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"At all times, again, it was vaguely understood that dreams reveal the"
5384,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"unconscious, that poetry emanates from the dream state, that in fact"
5385,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poems are even composed in dreams. Thus, the Bible itself is authority"
5386,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,for the fact that all the prophets received their messages in a dream or
5387,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"vision. The Hebrew sages said that the dream was a fraction of prophecy,"
5388,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the unripe fruit of prophecy.
5389,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5390,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,One of the first critics who treated at length the question whether
5391,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry may actually be composed in dreams is the Hebrew poet and
5392,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"critic Moses Ibn Ezra, who lived in Spain in the early part of the"
5393,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,twelfth century. The seventh chapter of his _Conversations and
5394,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Recollections_[182:A] deals with the subject. He was influenced by Arabs
5395,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,who were absorbingly concerned with the interpretation of dreams. Ibn
5396,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Ezra thought that it was just in the sleeping state that the use of
5397,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"thought and imagination was greatest, for then the soul loses"
5398,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"consciousness of things, the body and senses are at rest and only the"
5399,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"common sense, which the critic uses really as synonymous with the"
5400,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"unconscious, is active. He quotes a Hebrew philosopher to the effect"
5401,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"that the soul, when detached from the body, has finer perceptions than"
5402,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,when awake. This is in accordance with Aristotle who said that the soul
5403,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"can discover hidden things when detached from the senses, when it is"
5404,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,pure. Ibn Ezra asserts that his Hebrew authority maintains that one may
5405,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"compose verses in sleep, and he gives examples of his own."
5406,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5407,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Ibn Ezra believed that nightmares have some idea behind them, that an"
5408,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,interpreter of dreams whose reason is superior to that of the dreamer
5409,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"can discover the idea, for dream interpretation is the science of hidden"
5410,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"things communicated by God. The poet also composes verses in dreams,"
5411,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"often because he does this in waking life, for many people carry on in"
5412,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,their dreams the occupations of their daily life. We all recall that we
5413,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"read in our dreams, especially if we are lovers of reading. We do in our"
5414,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,dreams what we would like to do.
5415,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5416,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"The Aristotelian medieval Hebrew philosophers, Isaac Israeli, Abraham"
5417,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Ibn Daud, Moses Maimomides, and Levi ben Gerson also developed the idea"
5418,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,of the connection of prophecy with dreams.[183:A]
5419,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5420,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,We know to-day that the poet creates a congenial surrounding for himself
5421,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,out of his imagination. He is repelled by the sordidness of his
5422,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,environment or the suffering he has had in life. He writes a poem like
5423,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"_Epipsychidion_, to build himself a home where he has ideal love,"
5424,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,because he is not satisfied with his married life. He writes a prose
5425,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poem like _Dream Children_ where he sees himself wedded to his lost
5426,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"love, with their children about him, because he is a bachelor who has"
5427,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,neither love nor children.
5428,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5429,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Poetry, like dreams, creates a state where unfulfilled unconscious"
5430,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,wishes are gratified. Poetry is the voice then of the unconscious. The
5431,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poem is usually a product of the day-dream, which is related to the"
5432,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"dream of sleep, for both species of dreams reveal the unconscious."
5433,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Poetry shows conflicts and makes adjustments to reality. Poetry is
5434,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,aesthetic therapeutics.[184:A]
5435,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5436,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The dream poems of literature are so numerous that one is amazed that
5437,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the theory of poetry as a dream has not been more prominently discussed
5438,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,by literary critics. In the middle ages many poems were cast in the form
5439,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,of dreams. The allegory was generally a dream. Who can doubt that the
5440,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"_Divine Comedy_ and _Pilgrim's Progress_, both in the form of dreams,"
5441,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"were attempts by the poets to adjust themselves to reality, to purge"
5442,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,themselves and relieve their unconscious?
5443,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5444,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Even those poets who are always hiding their souls and making inlays of
5445,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,verbal mosaic reveal themselves. Their dabbling with trifles is
5446,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,indicative of an inability or lack of courage to think and feel. They
5447,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,thus make a disclosure more marked than if they had sung their private
5448,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,thoughts openly.
5449,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5450,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Poetry is a psychological art rather than a plastic one. It deals with
5451,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the soul. Horace's statement that if the poet would make the reader weep
5452,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"he must weep himself, is true. Yet we have often failed to recognize"
5453,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that poetry is a genuine personal cry of a man who dreams. We have
5454,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"confused poetry with prosody, instead of identifying it with the"
5455,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,unconscious.
5456,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5457,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"The poem with the social message, the problem play for example, or the"
5458,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"novel with a purpose, also belongs to the literature of dreams. The poet"
5459,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,sees foul infections infiltrating society; he has often himself been a
5460,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,victim of social abuses. He voices complaints about the unjust system
5461,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and its tyrannical sway. He shows himself and others suffering in its
5462,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,coils. He dreams a vision of a more beautiful and just system of society
5463,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,where neither he nor others are consumed in vexation. He states
5464,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,ecstatically the ideas that come to him as he condemns; he entertains
5465,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and expresses views whose adoption would enable man to reconstruct
5466,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,society on a better plan.
5467,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5468,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,His intellect is colored by his inability to adjust himself socially.
5469,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"His dreams give him ideas. He does not have to become a reformer, but he"
5470,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,recognizes social wrongs resulting from custom or stupidity or downright
5471,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,wickedness. Personal repression and dreaming produce not only love
5472,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poems, but poems containing utopias of society, plans for improvement."
5473,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5474,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,I have fully stated in my _The Erotic Motive in Literature_ the
5475,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,psychoanalytical view of poetry which regards it as the poet's creation
5476,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,of a world in accordance with his fancy to compensate himself for his
5477,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,repressions. Thus the poet relieves himself of emotions that were
5478,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,bursting within him and cures himself of incipient neurosis. I have
5479,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"shown that the view was not wholly originated by Freud, but stated by"
5480,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"various English critics like Samuel Johnson, Hazlitt, Lamb and Kingsley."
5481,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"There are several other Englishmen who held the view, namely Shakespeare"
5482,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and Bacon. Havelock Ellis, however, was the first writer in England to"
5483,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,develop the idea that artistic creation is a sublimation of sex
5484,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"repression. (See his essay on Casanova in _Affirmations_, published"
5485,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,before Freud's book on dreams.)
5486,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5487,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Poets like Burns, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Goethe and Ibsen"
5488,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,have told us that they wrote to relieve themselves of their pent up
5489,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"passions. Further, Coleridge, Shelley, Emerson, Daudet, Holmes, Lowell,"
5490,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Poe and Hearn have left us written evidence of their belief that poetry
5491,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emanates from the unconscious. It remained, however, for Freud to have"
5492,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the courage to identify the unconscious chiefly with sex repression and

5495,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The first English poet who claimed to allow his unconscious self
5496,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"deliberately to dictate his poems, was James John Garth Wilkinson."
5497,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Havelock Ellis has recently called attention to him. In his
5498,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,_Improvisations from the Spirit_ (1857) Wilkinson wrote down in rhymed
5499,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,verse the first impressions of a chosen theme. He depended chiefly on
5500,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"inspiration. His book was praised by Dante G. Rossetti, and forms the"
5501,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"subject of an essay by the poet James Thomson, called ""A Strange Book"""
5502,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,in _Biographical and Critical Studies_. Emerson had also praised this
5503,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"physician, who was an authority on Blake and Swedenborg. Wilkinson"
5504,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,claims to have written in what we would call the Freudian method of
5505,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,drawing on his unconscious. He considers reason and will secondary
5506,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,powers in the process. The poems resemble Blake's (even in their
5507,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,obscurity). Thomson rightly distinguishes Wilkinson from fraudulent
5508,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,spiritualists.
5509,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5510,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Wilkinson's poems, however, do not make good the claim to be absolutely"
5511,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,unconscious art. If he had not told us that he improvised we would never
5512,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"have doubted that these poems were composed like all other poems, with"
5513,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,some labor. We cannot believe that Wilkinson did not have to seek
5514,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,rhymes. He may have taken the first rhyme that came to his head but he
5515,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"had also to consider his metre. Again, no art dispenses altogether with"
5516,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the poet's use of artistic judgment, no matter how much an improvisation"
5517,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that art is. I do not believe that even Coleridge's famous _Kubla Khan_
5518,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"was actually composed in a dream, but that it was merely suggested by a"
5519,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"dream.[187:A] He fashioned the form consciously, that is the rhyme and"
5520,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"metre. The substance of the poem is, however, always from the"
5521,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,unconscious. Thomson considers Wilkinson's belief in the divine
5522,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,inspiration of his poem a delusion. Wilkinson's art is not utterly
5523,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"unconscious, for there is no uncensored idea therein, which is bound to"
5524,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"be occasionally, in some dreams out of many, of the most virtuous man."
5525,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"This commendable feature shows Wilkinson exercised judgment, and this"
5526,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,was a conscious artistic process.
5527,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5528,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Improvisation is one of the features that characterized Persian and
5529,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Arabic poetry. It is easier there than in English because of the
5530,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"facility for rhyme in these languages, and because the improvisers"
5531,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,usually composed in rhymed prose and were not hampered by metre. The
5532,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,test of the great poet often was his ability to compose a poem on the
5533,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"spur of the moment. Seemingly fabulous, yet apparently true stories of"
5534,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,improvisation feats by Arabic poets are numerous. When they improvised
5535,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"in different metres, the Arabic poets in competition would compose"
5536,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,alternately verse by verse as a rule. Sometimes the poet would improvise
5537,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,a short poem on the basis of any opening verse given to him. We remember
5538,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the story of Harun al Rashid who recited a line to Abu Nuwas who
5539,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,composed a poem for him. The _Arabian Nights_ is full of improvised
5540,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poems. Arabic critics always dealt with improvisation as a feature of
5541,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"verse making, and this is an argument to those who maintain that Arabic"
5542,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry was conscious art and artificial. It was the ecstasy that
5543,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,unconsciously incited the poet to utter his inner thought.
5544,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5545,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"I would like, however, to make special reference to two Englishmen, John"
5546,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Keble and E. S. Dallas, both now very little read, who left critical"
5547,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,works expounding poetry from a psychoanalytic point of view. Keble was
5548,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and the author of a most widely read"
5549,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Christian poem. He delivered lectures on poetry in the eighteen-thirties,"
5550,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,in Latin. These were published in 1844 under the title of _De Poeticae
5551,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,vi Medica_. They were translated into English for the first time a few
5552,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"years ago. They have been praised by Cardinal Newman, Justice Coleridge,"
5553,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Gladstone and Saintsbury. Dean Church called them the most original and
5554,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,memorable lectures on poetry that had ever been delivered at Oxford.
5555,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5556,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Keble defined poetry as ""a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man,"
5557,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"which gives healing relief to secret mental emotions, and yet without"
5558,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"detriment to modest reserve, and yet, while giving scope to enthusiasm,"
5559,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"rules it with order and due control."" He traces the origin of poetry to"
5560,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the desire for personal relief of pent up emotions in the individual and
5561,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,argues that this is the natural conclusion from his definition. He
5562,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,divided poets into two classes--primary and secondary. In the first
5563,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"class he put those who, moved by impulse, resort to composition for"
5564,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,relief and solace of a hindered or overwrought mind. In the second class
5565,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,he put imitators of the first and all others. He had been meditating
5566,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"over these views for some time, and they also appear in some of the"
5567,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,essays which were collected after his death under the title of
5568,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"_Occasional Papers and Reviews_. In fact, in one of these essays he used"
5569,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the Freudian word ""repression,"" in referring to the creation of poetry."
5570,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5571,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Keble's views are so sound and clear that one marvels they were not
5572,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,taken up before Freud. It is true one will find much that is obsolete in
5573,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"his lectures; one will be amused by his Toryism, his over-emphasis on"
5574,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the religious side of poetry, his academic and classic standards. He"
5575,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,however recognized that poetry was a sublimation of the poet's
5576,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"surcharged emotions and that the poet healed himself, therapeutically"
5577,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,treating himself by writing. He was really developing at length
5578,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Aristotle's famous definition of tragedy as purging the audience of pity
5579,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and fear. Aristotle was referring however to the aesthetic purgation of
5580,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the feelings of the audience; Keble, like Freud later, had in mind the"
5581,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poet's relief to himself. Poetry ministers however to the overburdened
5582,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,mind both of the poet and the reader. Both are relieved in finding
5583,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,expression for ideas and emotions that are troubling them.
5584,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5585,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,It was no doubt Keble's religious nature that made him perceive this
5586,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,important fact. He noted that the psalmists in the Bible sang to relieve
5587,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,themselves of their griefs and he saw that prayer had a psychoanalytic
5588,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,effect on people. Poetry is then the emotional expression of an
5589,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,overcharged heart. But this does not necessarily mean overcharged with
5590,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,grief. For it expresses people who are overflowing with joy or any
5591,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emotion. It covers what Nietzsche called ecstasy, and especially the"
5592,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,ecstasy of love or sexual excitement. It covers the desire for beauty
5593,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"which, as Nietzsche again saw, possessed a sexual contagion in it. The"
5594,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,happy poet in love desires to give vent to his emotions by some form of
5595,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"expression, whether his love is satisfied or not. And those who seek the"
5596,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,origin of poetry in religion must remember the close affiliations that
5597,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,anthropologists have found between love and religion.
5598,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5599,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Keble perceived that the greatness of poetry lay in its genuineness and
5600,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"seriousness, and that it was not merely a metrical plaything. He"
5601,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,perceived that it revealed the poet himself and that its mission was
5602,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,high.
5603,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5604,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"One must also admire his broadmindedness in treating Lucretius, whom, in"
5605,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"spite of his atheistic views, Keble places among the primary poets. The"
5606,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,modern reader might resent the placing of Sophocles and Theocritus
5607,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,among the secondary poets; nor does every personal poet belong to the
5608,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"primary class, for minor poets are often personal. Poets must, to be in"
5609,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the first class, voice a very compelling emotion based on a very"
5610,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"profound idea. Burns and Heine, Shelley and Byron, Goethe and Ibsen,"
5611,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Balzac and Tolstoy are primary poets, not only because they are personal"
5612,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,but because they are intellectual.
5613,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5614,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Keble anticipated the greatest of modern theories about the nature of
5615,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"art, poetry and literature. He saw that art was not play, as Schiller"
5616,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and Spenser believed, but an expression necessary to relieve both poet"
5617,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and reader. Its origin is not in play but in the desire to heal oneself
5618,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and create a reality out of a dream. Poetry is an attempt to unburden
5619,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"oneself and adjust oneself to reality, which it does by complaint or by"
5620,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,building a dream castle.
5621,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5622,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"But its sources are always repressions of emotions, which in many cases"
5623,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,have become unconscious. The best exposition of the imagination from
5624,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"this point of view is by E. S. Dallas, who published _The Gay Science_,"
5625,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"in two volumes, in 1866. He was a successful book reviewer and had also"
5626,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"written a book on _Poetics_, which David Masson reviewed. In chapters in"
5627,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"his greater book, on ""The Imagination,"" ""The Hidden Soul,"" ""The Play of"
5628,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Thought"" and ""The Secrecy of Art,"" he anticipated many of the modern"
5629,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,discoveries of art in connection with the unconscious. He saw that man
5630,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,leads a hidden inner life of which he is unaware and that this life
5631,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,appears in his art. You will find more on the nature of imagination and
5632,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry in Dallas's book than in many of the works on taste that have
5633,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,survived. He carried Keble's ideas to much further conclusions and saw
5634,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"that man unburdens not only his conscious emotions, but even those of"
5635,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,which he is unconscious.
5636,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5637,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Dallas's four chapters at the end of his first volume form one of the
5638,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,most striking contributions to the nature of poetry and imagination that
5639,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,have ever been penned in English. He finds imagination but another name
5640,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,for the automatic action of the mind or any of its faculties. It is
5641,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"unconscious memory, its logic is the logic of the hidden soul, it is"
5642,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,passion that works out of sight. Imagination is the unconscious. It
5643,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"suggests not only the power of figuring to ourselves the shows of sense,"
5644,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,but also that of imagery or the comparison of shows. It does not differ
5645,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"from reason, but shows the process of reason working automatically. It"
5646,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is play of thought, it is hidden soul. It combines sensibility to"
5647,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"images, wandering of the mind, and finding of comparisons. Its function"
5648,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is not different from reason, memory or feeling, but its peculiarity is"
5649,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that its work is done in secret automatically or unconsciously.
5650,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Imagination not only builds images, but it creates types, it utters"
5651,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"ideas, it speaks a natural language, it voices emotions."
5652,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5653,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Even the old critic who separated verse poetry from prose literature as
5654,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"a distinct branch of writing was always suspicious that he was in error,"
5655,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,for he knew both were the products of creative imagination. Of the
5656,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"ancients, it was only Aristotle who, defining poetry as imitation, saw"
5657,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"that he must include prose that ""imitated"" in his definition of poetry."
5658,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The thing that counted was the imitation or imagination in determining
5659,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry and not metre.
5660,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5661,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"As imagination creates the literature of ecstasy, the real subject of"
5662,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"this book has been the function of the imagination, but as the term,"
5663,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"like poetry, has been so much abused and misunderstood, the nature of"
5664,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"them both is studied by using other terms, like ""ecstasy"" and the"
5665,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"""unconscious."""
5666,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5667,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,I suppose that no word has been more used in connection with poetry
5668,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,than the word imagination. And probably no word has been more vaguely
5669,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and diversely employed. Every one agrees that literature in general must
5670,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,be the function of the imagination. Many people when they speak of
5671,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,imagination really mean nothing more than the introduction of numerous
5672,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,figures of speech; others confuse it with the sportive play of the
5673,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,author with supernatural machinery in his work. To others imagination
5674,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,suggests something that is opposed to the convictions of the intellect
5675,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and to the moral faculty. Even to-day many people do not know that
5676,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Aristotle used the term ""imitation"" and Bacon the word ""feigning"" where"
5677,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"we use the word ""imagination."" These older terms, in the course of"
5678,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"evolution in meaning which words undergo, are used by us no longer to"
5679,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"represent poetic creation, or imaginative work."
5680,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5681,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Every one quotes the famous lines of Shakespeare in the fifth act of the
5682,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"_Midsummer Night's Dream_, and many fail to see the exact meaning of the"
5683,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,master who had a true conception of the function of his art. First he
5684,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"recognizes that the poet is ""imagination all compact,"" and compares him"
5685,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,to the lunatic and the lover. Next he uses the word frenzy in speaking
5686,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of the poet's eye which rolls about and glances over the universe,"
5687,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,showing that he had the conception of the ecstatic element in the poet's
5688,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,make-up and work. The poet gives shape to the forms of unknown things
5689,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"bodied forth by imagination, he gives a local habitation and a name to"
5690,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,airy nothing. Shakespeare recognizes the fact that imagination is
5691,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,related to the dream when he says that one of the tricks of imagination
5692,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is that if it apprehends a joy, it comprehends the bringer of that joy,"
5693,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"that is, it builds a dream castle where that joy is realized. His use of"
5694,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the words ""unknown things"" in addition, as the substance of imagination,"
5695,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,shows that he understood that the realm of the unconscious was the
5696,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,province of the imagination. Hazlitt and Lowell among modern critics
5697,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,correctly understood Shakespeare's meaning of imagination as identical
5698,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,with ecstasy.[193:A]
5699,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5700,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,People to-day give vent to their emotions in prose conversation or in
5701,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,writing prose letters to friends or relatives. Here we have the process
5702,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that led to the creation of poetry in earliest times. Poetry is the
5703,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"result of ecstasy, the outpouring of the imagination, the expression of"
5704,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the unconscious. If instead of having confused it with song and dancing
5705,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the critics would have taken it in its real significance as excited
5706,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"speech, we would have had less misunderstanding about its nature. The"
5707,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"lover of to-day who tells his emotions to his love, or confides them to"
5708,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"a friend, the bereaved person who relates his grief at the death of a"
5709,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"loved one and tells of the virtues of the departed, are rude poets"
5710,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,expressing themselves in conversation in prose. When they take the pen
5711,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"in hand and write a letter or keep a diary, they become poets no less"
5712,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,than the versifier who puts his feelings down in patterned speech.
5713,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5714,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The greatness of the letter or diary as a poem depends not only on the
5715,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"craftsmanship, but on the substance, on the vividness or beauty or power"
5716,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"with which the emotion is depicted, on the degree of its capability of"
5717,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"moving others, and on the depth of the ideas therein. Similarly, the"
5718,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,person who is moved to prayer spontaneously by some religious experience
5719,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,or private passion and utters his words in a natural manner or reduces
5720,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"them to writing, is creating poetry. The writers to-day of letters and"
5721,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,diaries in prose are going through the same mechanism as all the
5722,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,earliest poets. When they use patterns they are already becoming
5723,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,artificial and are imitating other verse writers and obeying rules that
5724,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,they studied.
5725,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5726,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"We have long been familiar with the saying that every man is a poet,"
5727,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,though he does not write what is known as poetry. There is no psychical
5728,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,difference between the average man and the great poet. They both are
5729,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"subject to emotions, have imagination, and both express their emotions"
5730,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,in some manner. The only difference between the average man and the poet
5731,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is that the poet takes the average man's speech, elaborates it, and puts"
5732,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,it into shape so that it moves others.
5733,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5734,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Poetry is born in man's soul when his emotions are aroused, and no"
5735,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotions are aroused unless they are expressed in some way. Hence
5736,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Croce's view is correct that poetry is expression, if he means by"
5737,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,expression emotional and imaginative expression. People have too long
5738,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,been under the impression that the poet was a different creature from
5739,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the rest of mankind, subject to a livelier imagination, or intenser"
5740,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emotions. He is no different; on the contrary, there are many people who"
5741,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,never wrote a line who are more emotional and imaginative than many
5742,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poets. The process of the lover writing a letter involves the same
5743,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,imaginative function as of the poet penning a love poem. The prose
5744,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"expression of emotion is also poetry, but we have hitherto given the"
5745,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"name ""poetry"" only to the verse literary composition."
5746,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5747,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,There is great unanimity of opinion as to the connection of literary
5748,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poetry in its origin with dance, music and song, an opinion that is"
5749,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"wrong nevertheless. In fact, most phases of poetry neither have nor ever"
5750,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,had anything in common with dancing or music or song.
5751,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5752,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Poetry such as we find in the great English verse or prose poets of the
5753,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"nineteenth century has little relation to dancing, music or singing."
5754,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Take the Shakespearean plays, the tragedies of _Hamlet_ or _King Lear_,"
5755,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,where we have philosophizing and descriptions of painful crises which
5756,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"are great poetry. A poet does not have to sing a great idea, nor dance"
5757,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"to it, nor put it to music. Ibsen and Balzac are poets and yet they are"
5758,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"far away from dancing, singing or music. Though most good singers are"
5759,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poets, one does not have to be a singer to be a poet. Then take great"
5760,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,impassioned oratory or beautiful emotional word painting in prose or
5761,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"verse, or any idea bathed in feeling. They may all be poetry and need"
5762,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"not be--in fact, by their nature, are not--related to dance, music and"
5763,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,song.
5764,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5765,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"An autobiographical verse poem like Wordsworth's _Prelude_, or a series"
5766,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of impassioned ideas like Lucretius's _Nature of Things_, or a novel in"
5767,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"verse like _Aurora Leigh_ is not related to song, yet it is poetry in"
5768,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,parts. (This does not mean that poetry is not the soul of music or
5769,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,dancing.)
5770,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5771,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,There is nothing more amusing than to read the innumerable and
5772,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,contradictory theories about the origin of poetry. Many believe that the
5773,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"first poetry was pastoral poetry, since the shepherd's life was, after"
5774,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"hunting, the first occupation appropriate and conducive to composing"
5775,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poetry. Scaliger, Fontenelle and Pope endorsed this view. Others believe"
5776,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that the original poetry was written to express man's religious
5777,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotions; his prayers and hymns to his gods are considered by many the
5778,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,first poetry. Again the communistic needs of the clans are supposed to
5779,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"have invited the poet to write. Celebration of tribal victories, praise"
5780,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of heroes, incitement to martial courage and revenge, the virtues of the"
5781,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"clan, were supposed to be the first function of the poets. Epics and"
5782,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"ballads are cited in proof of this. Again, satires and invectives are"
5783,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"thought to be the first forms as they were used by the bards, who were"
5784,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,also magicians and hurled them as potent forces against the enemy.
5785,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Thomas Peacock believed eulogies constituted the first poetry of the
5786,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"human race. Then the proverb and parable have their devotees, as the"
5787,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,first imaginative representation of the common thinking of the earliest
5788,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"people, and as the readiest to lend themselves to the use of verse"
5789,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,patterns. One could go on naming various theories that have been
5790,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,advanced as to what kind of poetry is earliest; there is the poem which
5791,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,designates the awakening of a moral conscience; there is the mythical
5792,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,tale reciting the dream desires of the tribe; the song chanted at
5793,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,various labors and toilings of the common people; the chorus which
5794,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,served as an accompaniment to holiday celebrations and nature worship;
5795,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the chanting of the first cantors or priests and the responses of the
5796,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,congregation; there are the ecstatic utterances of the earliest
5797,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"prophets, soothsayers and magicians; the admonitions of counselors and"
5798,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,legislators; the personal grievances and complaints recited by those
5799,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"seeking redress before the assembly or chief; marriage hymns, love poems"
5800,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and elegies; all of these are separately cited as the original springs
5801,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,from which later poetry developed.
5802,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5803,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The critics assume that man was originally possessed of one emotion
5804,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"only, which he celebrated, or that only one feeling predominated to"
5805,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"which he gave vent. Now, as a matter of fact, early man was subject to"
5806,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"multifarious emotions just as we are to-day, and he voiced them all, in"
5807,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"speech, later writing them down in prose and finally in some verse"
5808,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,pattern. Some of these emotions were originally written down with rhythm
5809,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and repetition. There really was no state when poetry first began, for"
5810,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the first spoken poetry is as early as human speech which has always
5811,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,been used to express emotions.
5812,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5813,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Written poetry is merely the mechanical transmission of spoken poetry.
5814,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,We cannot ignore the poetry of nations which has been handed down by
5815,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,tradition and never been reduced to writing.
5816,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5817,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The mental process of composing poetry to-day is no different from what
5818,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,it ever was. Different people express verbally the ranges of all the
5819,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotions and several individuals give us the written expression of these
5820,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"moods in good form, so as to evoke sympathy in the hearer or reader. It"
5821,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is true, in early times the religious and martial emotions were much"
5822,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"expressed, but this does not prove that religious or warlike feelings"
5823,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,alone gave rise to the art of poetry. Every emotion man felt gave rise
5824,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,to the art of poetry. Poetry is the expression of all the emotions and
5825,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,is born with speech and hence is universal expression and the most
5826,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,ancient art we possess.
5827,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5828,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Poetry is, however, so often the expression of a personal complaint, the"
5829,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"expression of a repression, that we may say that its real origin to-day,"
5830,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"and at all times, is the prose elegy. The person who pours out his"
5831,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,griefs is psychologically the poet in action. Attempts have been made by
5832,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Greek scholars to show that both the epic and the drama had their origin
5833,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,at public funerals where elegies were recited instead of at the
5834,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Dionysian rites. This is very plausible. The pang of death was one of
5835,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the causes that led to the creation of poetry, especially since early"
5836,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"man was carried off too frequently by wars, plagues and wild animals."
5837,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"One should add that the pangs of the loss of one's mate, the grief"
5838,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"resulting from being worsted in the battle for the female, were other"
5839,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"contributing causes of the creation of poetry. In short, the origin of"
5840,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poetry was personal, and much ancient poetry dealt with a lament of some"
5841,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,kind. This has been the characteristic of poetry ever since. Grief is
5842,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the source of poetry. Note the number of wailing poems in Irish and
5843,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Scotch literature where the death of a husband in war, or the loss of"
5844,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"love, plays a part. Much Anglo-Saxon poetry is elegiac. The earliest"
5845,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poems from Egypt, China, Japan contain laments. Savage literature is"
5846,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,full of them. The hymn is really a lament in the form of a plea. The
5847,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"dirge, the threnody, the elegy, these constitute the bulk of much"
5848,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"poetry, ancient and modern. Burns's poems are chiefly dirges of some"
5849,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,kind. The dirge is most human and appealing to us. Some of the most
5850,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,effective poetry in the Bible are the cries of David in the _Psalms_ and
5851,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the dirges in _Lamentations_.
5852,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5853,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"The modern elegy whether in prose or verse, whether it laments death or"
5854,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"lost love, is the direct offspring of the earliest savage cry of grief."
5855,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The savage wailed in public as the poet does. Our novelists still do
5856,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"unavoidably the same thing, often covertly. When Tolstoy wrote of the"
5857,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"death of Levin's brother in _Anna Karenina_ or _Ivan Ilyitch_, he was"
5858,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"actually bemoaning his own brother, whose death made a lasting"
5859,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,impression upon him.
5860,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5861,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Gummere thinks that the early poetry of man was communal and that modern
5862,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,personal lyric poetry is a development from communal poetry. Surely
5863,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Professor Gummere was aware that among the religious and communal poetry
5864,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of the Anglo-Saxons, for instance, we have such a fine elegy as _The"
5865,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Wanderer_ and such a beautiful dream poem as _The Phoenix_. It is a
5866,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"great mistake to think that personal poetry is of modern growth, dating"
5867,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,from Villon. It has been more developed in modern times. And then there
5868,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,is much of the personal element in this so-called communal poetry. The
5869,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"man who sang for his tribe in ancient times felt with his tribe, and"
5870,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,hence was both communal and personal.
5871,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5872,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The research into the origins of poetry can be made in the soul of any
5873,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,writer to-day. The same psychological mechanisms that are at work in
5874,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the composition of his poem were at work in the production of the most
5875,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,crude savage verbal outpourings. It is a personal repression leading to
5876,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the utterance of a complaint or the building of a dream-world. Keble was
5877,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,one of the few critics who considered the personal complaint the chief
5878,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,origin of poetry.
5879,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5880,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Schopenhauer defined poetry as one of the arts whose mission was to
5881,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"reveal an idea in the Platonic sense, that is, the permanent essential"
5882,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,forms of the world and all its phenomena; art to him was a way of
5883,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,looking at things independent of the principle of sufficient reason. In
5884,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,accordance with his philosophy he regards ideas as the objectivity of
5885,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the thing in itself, the will. He looks upon the different grades of the"
5886,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,objectivation of the will as fixed. The result is that he considers the
5887,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"peculiar end of all the fine arts ""to elucidate the objectivation of"
5888,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"will at the lowest grades of its visibility, in which it shows itself as"
5889,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the dumb unconscious tendency of the mass in accordance with laws, and"
5890,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,yet already reveals a breach of the unity of will with itself in a
5891,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"conflict between gravity and rigidity,"" while tragedy ""presents to us at"
5892,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,the highest grades of the objectivation of will this very conflict with

5894,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Idea_, V. 1, p. 330.)"
5895,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5896,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,All this is saying in philosophical terms what we know has been the
5897,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"mission of art, the portrayal of man defeated in his blind and impotent"
5898,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,desires. No one denies that poetry must and always will portray man in
5899,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,such circumstances. Freud has restated the problem when he showed that
5900,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poets deal with their own repressions.
5901,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5902,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,One cannot accept Schopenhauer's views that the aim of art is to
5903,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,annihilate the will to live. He failed to see that much of this tragic
5904,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,literature acts as a relief to us and makes us want to live all the
5905,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,more.
5906,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5907,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Dr. Arthur H. Fairchild deserves credit for assigning high importance to
5908,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry when he says that it is a means of self-realization and is a
5909,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,biological necessity. In his _The Making of Poetry_ he expresses what is
5910,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,really the psychoanalytical theory which sees in poetry a means of
5911,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"freeing oneself of complexes, a way of restoring oneself to a better"
5912,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"state of mind, a cure for incipient neurosis. When we are sad, the"
5913,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"reading of sad poetry relieves us. As Emerson said, ""Poetry is the"
5914,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"effort of man to indemnify himself for the wrongs of his condition."" The"
5915,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"toiler reads of other toilers in literature, say in Zola's _Germinal_ or"
5916,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Hauptmann's _Weavers_, or Sinclair's _Jungle_, and his emotions are"
5917,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"discharged. It is true he may be driven to action, but the poet has"
5918,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"nothing to do with that. The lover, unhappy in his love, finds help in"
5919,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,hearing a poet express his own surcharged feelings resulting from love
5920,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,troubles. The reader may by reading be prevented from going mad. The
5921,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"great public which does not read good literature finds relief in plays,"
5922,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"moving pictures, magazine stories or newspapers, all of which, while it"
5923,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"is not generally good poetry, may have the effect of a catharsis on the"
5924,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,public's rudely developed aesthetic sense.
5925,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5926,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Mankind hungers for poetry. Those who are unable to appreciate it in
5927,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"higher form, resort to imitations and substitutes, which express their"
5928,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotions and relieve them. He who can read and enjoy the great masters
5929,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"of prose and verse, or appreciate good music and painting, does not have"
5930,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,to resort to the political meeting or religious revivals to have his
5931,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emotions played on. Athletic contests like baseball, football and prize"
5932,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,fights usually help people to express and relieve surcharged emotions.
5933,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The love for cheap forms of movies and card games has its origin in a
5934,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,desire for emotional discharge. Man resorts to every measure to give his
5935,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"emotions play. He reads newspapers and trashy magazines, he likes to"
5936,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"hear melodramas and ranting orators, often because he has a love for"
5937,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,emotional excitement which he cannot satisfy by literature of the best
5938,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"kind. He cannot concentrate, he cannot think clearly, he is ignorant of"
5939,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"the simplest principles of literary art; he cannot read poetry, yet he"
5940,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,hungers for it. His dormant instincts will even seek satisfaction in
5941,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,condemnation and persecution to satisfy such emotions which he cannot
5942,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,express by reading.
5943,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5944,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,The creation and reading of poetry in prose or verse is an achievement
5945,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,common to man alone of the animals. He is not separated from them by
5946,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"moral or intellectual faculties, for animals have these, but by his"
5947,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,faculty to create art and make others share enjoyment of them. It may be
5948,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,that the spider and the bee derive aesthetic satisfaction from
5949,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"contemplating the web or the hive they build, or the bird gets artistic"
5950,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"pleasure from the song it sings or hears, or any animal may win sympathy"
5951,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"from another by some mute act, but man alone puts his emotions and ideas"
5952,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,in words in an endurable work of art so as to relieve himself and move
5953,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,others. What separates man from animals is not then religion--is not the

5957,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,sculpture.
5958,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5959,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,And a life devoted to poetry is the best life we can seek. Let a man
5960,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"have his necessities satisfied, and there is no higher form of life than"
5961,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,to enjoy and if possible to create poetry. Poetry makes us want to live
5962,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,and gives us zest in life. Life exists for sensations and we get our
5963,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,sensations out of poetry. Life exists for the enjoyment and creation of
5964,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,poetry. The unlettered savage has his craving for poetry satisfied in
5965,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"his dancing, and war cries, in religion and tribal customs. The child"
5966,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,has it satisfied in his toys and games. Adult man appeases his hunger
5967,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"for poetry in diverse ways. Literature, art and music are so far the"
5968,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"highest forms of poetry we know, and in literature I include philosophy"
5969,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"or thought, in prose as well as verse."
5970,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5971,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Poetry acts as a necessary relief to us for emotions and ideas that seek
5972,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"expression, and is hence more real than any other form of life."
5973,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,
5974,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,Our views of poetry from a psychoanalytic point of view finds
5975,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,confirmation even in the Bible. One of the leading prophets and the
5976,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,leading psalmists has each told us in scorching words how he felt before
5977,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"he created. Jeremiah says of God, ""His word was in mine heart as a"

5979,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"could not stay,"" Ch. 20, v. 9. David also said, ""My heart was hot within"

5981,LITERATURE OF ECSTASY EMANATES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS,"Psalms, Ch. 39, v. 3. Both of these poets had made resolutions to keep"

6016,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6017,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6018,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Oriental poetry, especially that of the Arabs and the Persians, is"
6019,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,notable for its interpenetration with ecstasy couched in intricate
6020,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,conventional forms. The Oriental poems abound numerously in far-fetched
6021,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"figures of speech, and are written in metres following definite laws and"
6022,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,are subject to difficult and uniform rhymes continued in every line in
6023,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poems of great length. In fact the greatest historian of the
6024,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Mohammedans, Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), defined poetry as effective"
6025,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"discourse based on metaphor and descriptions, divided into verses"
6026,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"agreeing with one another in metre and rhyme, each verse having a"
6027,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"separate idea, and the whole conforming to old Arab models. A poet was"
6028,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,supposed to get many thousands of verses by heart before practicing his
6029,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,art. One of the chapters in Ibn Khaldun's famous _Prolegomena_[203:A] or
6030,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"introduction to his history, _Book of Examples_, has a title stating"
6031,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,that the art of composing is concerned with words and not ideas.
6032,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6033,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,But in spite of slavish adherence to technique it was taken for granted
6034,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,that ecstasy was the main object of poetry. There is probably more
6035,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,ecstasy in the poetry of the Arabs and Persians than in that of most
6036,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"other nations, and it is an ecstasy that breaks through the molds of"
6037,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,form. It is a matter of astonishment that the artificial forms did not
6038,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,utterly choke out the ecstasy. Professor Edgar G. Browne in his
6039,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,scholarly _Literary History of Persia_ has devoted the first chapter of
6040,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the second volume to Persian metres and he calls attention to the
6041,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"conventional metaphors, bombast and inflation of the Arabic poets who"
6042,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,were not without influence upon the Persians.
6043,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6044,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,We today may accept the definition of poetry given in the _Four
6045,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Discourses_[204:A] (1162) of Nidhami I Arudi, for though he also"
6046,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"believed in the importance of the trappings of verse, he had ecstasy"
6047,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,primarily in mind. He defined poetry thus:
6048,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6049,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Poetry is that art whereby the poet arranges imaginary
6050,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"propositions, and adopts the deductions, with the result that"
6051,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,he can make a little thing appear great and a great thing
6052,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"small, or cause good to appear in the garb of evil and evil in"
6053,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the garb of good. By acting on the imagination, he excites the"
6054,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,faculties of anger and concupiscence in such a way that by his
6055,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,suggestion men's temperaments become affected with exaltation
6056,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,or depression; whereby he conduces to the accomplishment of
6057,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,great things in the order of the world.
6058,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6059,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,What more effective definition could there be of the utilitarian power
6060,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,of art to take man out of himself and exalt him into a state of
6061,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,beneficial ecstasy?
6062,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6063,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Ibn Khaldun said:
6064,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6065,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Poetry is, of all the forms of discourses, that which the"
6066,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabs regarded as the noblest; they also made it the
6067,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"depository of their knowledge and their history, the testimony"
6068,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"which would attest their virtues and faults, the store-house"
6069,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,in which were found the greater part of their scientific views
6070,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and their maxims of wisdom. The poetic faculty was as much
6071,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,deeply rooted in them as in all the other faculties they
6072,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,possessed.
6073,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6074,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"He continues, that they have handled poetry so well, that one could"
6075,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"deceive oneself and believe that this gift, which is really an acquired"
6076,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"art, was with them an innate one."
6077,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6078,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,These remarkable words of Ibn Khaldun will help us to understand the
6079,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,famous saying that poetry was the register of the Arabs. Never before
6080,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,nor since has poetry been so interwoven with a nation's life. The
6081,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"stories of the competitions for prizes for composing poetry, of the"
6082,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"happiness when a poet was born, of the importance assumed by the"
6083,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"discussion and recitation of poetry among all classes, read to us like"
6084,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,myths. Yet the fact that poetry should be part of the life of a
6085,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"passionate people who lived in the desert, free and untrammeled, is not"
6086,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,strange. The Arabs themselves attribute also their great superiority in
6087,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poetry to the beauty of their language, especially as spoken by the"
6088,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Bedouins in the desert. The great Arabian poet Abu Nuwas completed his
6089,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,education by sojourning a year among the Bedouins.
6090,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6091,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Another factor enhancing their poetry and one not to be ignored is that
6092,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"after 622 A.D. in post-Islamic times, poetry was rewarded by gifts."
6093,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Hence the eulogy grew into prominence and the poets were fabulously
6094,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"rewarded for their poems. This, of course, led to fulsome and cringing"
6095,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,eulogies. The caliph was the patron. When Mohammed appeared it seemed
6096,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"that poetry would die out, but it flourished more than ever. It was only"
6097,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,after the Abbasid caliphate was exterminated by the Mongol invasion
6098,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"(1258 A.D.) that poetry declined in Arabia to such an extent that, as"
6099,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Ibn Khaldun says, no prominent man would deign to devote himself to it."
6100,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6101,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Although the Arabs excelled in various kinds of poetry, we think of them"
6102,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,primarily as love poets.
6103,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6104,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"The Arabs, as we gather from _The Arabian Nights_, were a people"
6105,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,especially devoted to tenderness in love. When the Arab was smitten with
6106,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"love he was a helpless weeping child. There was one tribe, that of Azra,"
6107,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,wherein the victims were said to die of love. One poet said he knew of
6108,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,thirty young men whom love sickness carried off. In answer to a reproach
6109,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"for this weakness, one of the tribe replied: ""You would not talk like"
6110,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,that if you had seen the great black eyes of our women darting fire from
6111,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"beneath the veil of their long lashes, if you had seen them smile and"
6112,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"their death gleaming between their brown lips."" (Stendhal: _On Love_, p."
6113,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,218.)
6114,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6115,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic poetry in the period before Islam between 500 A.D. and 622 A.D.
6116,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"did not consist of pure eroticism. Satire, eulogy, elegy, revenge,"
6117,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"martial feeling, chiefly characterized it. Many poems were also devoted"
6118,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,to the praise of animals and the description of nature. The odes or
6119,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Qasidas, however, began with a love prelude, called nasib, in which the"
6120,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poet dwelt on his love sorrows merely to win the hearts of his hearers
6121,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,to his chief theme. One of the best of these is that in the ode of
6122,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Imru'ul Qays the first and greatest of the seven poets of the
6123,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Muallaqat_.
6124,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6125,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Pure erotic poetry appeared after Islam with the luxury that spread with
6126,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the growth of wealth, but the nasib continued to be used, especially in"
6127,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,eulogies. The poets still wrote like the Pre-islamic poets instead of
6128,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"celebrating Islam. The Umayyad Dynasty, which extended from 661 to 749"
6129,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"A.D., saw the birth of pure love poetry celebrated not as introductory"
6130,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,or episodic but purely for itself. The love story of one of the Arabian
6131,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"erotic poets of the period, Majnun, was celebrated by the great Persian"
6132,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poet, Nidhami, who flourished in the twelfth century. His _Laila_ and"
6133,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Majnun_ has been translated into English by Mr. Atkinson. The story was
6134,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"retold by many Persian and Ottoman poets. Then there was Jamil, who was"
6135,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the lover of Buthaina. These love poems by Majnun and Jamil were of
6136,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"popular origin, and represented the spirit of the people. There were"
6137,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"many other love poets, while some did not devote themselves exclusively"
6138,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,to love.
6139,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6140,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"The most celebrated, however, of the love poets was the handsome wealthy"
6141,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Omar ibn Abi Rabia (643-719 A.D.). He was of the tribe of Koraish, the"
6142,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,same tribe to which Mohammed himself belonged. This tribe was famous for
6143,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"many things, but not for poetry until Omar took away the reproach. His"
6144,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poems were called a crime against God, yet a cousin of the prophet"
6145,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,memorized some of them. The fullest account of him in English and of his
6146,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"love affairs, with translations from a few of his poems, appears in an"
6147,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,essay by William G. Palgrave in _Essays on Eastern Questions_. Omar was
6148,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"united in marriage to his love Zeynab after a stormy courtship, opposed"
6149,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"by her people, but he had several love affairs. The best idea of the"
6150,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,sweetness and pathos of his love poetry is conveyed without further
6151,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,comment by giving two translations made by Mr. Palgrave.

6224,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"willow of the hill was taught to wave its branches with grace,"
6225,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"when thy form, robed in beauty, first appeared before it. Thou"
6226,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"hast lent thy tender glances to the gazelles of the desert,"
6227,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and therefore the fairest object to be seen is the eye of the
6228,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"antelope. Sick with the pains of love, bereft of sleep and"
6229,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"confounded, I should never have outlived my nights, unless"
6230,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"revived by the appearance of thy favor, deceitful as it was."
6231,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,These four shall witness the sincerity of my attachment:
6232,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"tears, melancholy, a mind deranged, and care, my constant"
6233,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,visitor; could Yazbul feel this last; it would become like
6234,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"as--Suha. Some reproach me for loving thee, but I am not to be"
6235,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"reclaimed; others bid me forbear, but I heed them not. They"
6236,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,tell thee that I desire thee for thy beauty; how very strange!
6237,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and where is the beauty which is not an object of desire? For
6238,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"thee I am the most loving of lovers; none, I know, are like me"
6239,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,(_in sincerity_) or like thee in beauty.
6240,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6241,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The next poem represents one of the many outbursts of Antar:
6242,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6243,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,O bird of the tamarisk! thou hast rendered my sorrows more
6244,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poignant, thou hast redoubled my griefs. O bird of the"
6245,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,tamarisk! if thou invokest an absent friend for whom thou art
6246,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"mourning, even then, O bird, is thy affliction like the"
6247,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,distress I also feel? Augment my sorrows and my lamentations;
6248,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,aid me to weep till thou seest wonders from the discharge of
6249,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"my eyelids. Weep, too, from the excesses that I endure. Fear"
6250,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,not--only guard the trees from the breath of my burning sighs.
6251,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Quit me not till I die of love, the victim of passion of"
6252,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"absence, and separation. Fly, perhaps in the Hijaz thou mayest"
6253,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"see some one riding from Aalij to Nomani, wandering with a"
6254,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"damsel, she traversing wilds, and drowned in tears, anxious"
6255,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"for her native land. May God inspire thee, O dove! when thou"
6256,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"truly sees her loaded camels. Announce my death. Say, thou"
6257,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"hast left him stretched on the earth, and that his tears are"
6258,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"exhausted, but that he weeps in blood. Should the breeze ask"
6259,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"thee whence thou art, say, he is deprived of his heart and"
6260,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"stupefied; he is in a strange land, weeping for our departure,"
6261,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,for the God of heaven has struck him with affliction on
6262,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"account of his beloved; he is lying down like a tender bird,"
6263,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"that vultures and eagles have bereft of its young, that"
6264,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,grieves in unceasing plaints whilst its offspring are
6265,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,scattered over the plain and the desert!
6266,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6267,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,This poem by an unknown author is tenderness unexcelled:
6268,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6269,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_One Unnamed_
6270,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6271,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Nay, ask on the sandy hill the ben-tree with spreading boughs that"
6272,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"stands mid her sisters, if I greeted thy dwelling-place;"
6273,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,And whether their shade looked down upon me at eventide as there in
6274,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"my grief I stood, and that for my portion chose:"
6275,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"And whether, at dawn still there, mine eyelids a burthen bore of"
6276,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"tears falling one by one, as pearls from a broken string."
6277,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Yea, men long and yearn for Spring, the gladsome: but as for me--my"
6278,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"longing and Spring art thou, my yearning to gain thy grace;"
6279,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,And men dread the deadly Drought that slays them: but as for me--my
6280,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Drought is to know thee gone, my life but a barren land!"
6281,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"And sooth, if I suffer when thou greet'st me with words unkind, yet"
6282,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,somewhat of joy it brings thou thinkest on me at all.
6283,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,So take thy delight that I stand serving with aching heart and eyes
6284,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,bathed in tears lest thou shouldst sunder thyself from me.
6285,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6286,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic poetry may lack the light of intellectual outlook that we find in
6287,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,our greatest English poets; it may be deficient in the intensity of
6288,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,religious fervor characteristic of the medieval Hebrew poets; it may
6289,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"fall short of the high mystic strain attained by the Persians, but in"
6290,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the fervor depicting love of passion they have not been surpassed. The
6291,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"greatest Persian lyric love poet, Hafiz, and the greatest Turkish lyric"
6292,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"love poet, Baqui, clearly were under their influence."
6293,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6294,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic poetry then is probably richer in love ecstasy than that of any
6295,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,nation. This is due to the fact that they are both a sensuous and at the
6296,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"same time deeply religious people. They were strongly emotional,"
6297,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,extremely vindictive and extremely hospitable. They recorded their
6298,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,emotions unabashed. They had the naïveté of the child and cried out
6299,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"their slightest pain; they weep and bemoan constantly. Antar, one of the"
6300,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poets of the _Muallaqat_ and the hero of the romance bearing his name,"
6301,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,is more of a child than Achilles. He is always sobbing and weeping
6302,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,copiously; he is the prototype of the medieval knight who wept and
6303,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"declaimed because of absence of his mistress, a feature of romance which"
6304,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Cervantes ably ridiculed in _Don Quixote_.
6305,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6306,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Thomas Warton, the historian of English poetry, was one of the first to"
6307,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,point out the Arabic influence on chivalry and romanticism. The battle
6308,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"as to the extent of Arabic influence has been waged ever since, with, I"
6309,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"believe, the victory to the Arabs. FitzMaurice Kelly, the historian of"
6310,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Spanish Literature, emphasizing the Hebrew influence, has resented the"
6311,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"statement of the great Arabic influence, but Robert Briffault in _The"
6312,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Making of Humanity_ has proved that this influence has been
6313,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,underestimated rather than exaggerated.
6314,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6315,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The fact that there existed in Pre-islamic times equal morality for both
6316,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,sexes--women also were freer than in Post-islamic times--gave rise to
6317,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,romantic love.
6318,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6319,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic literature made the love or erotic note in its tender or
6320,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"chivalrous phase, fashionable. True, this note existed very sparingly"
6321,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"among the Greeks and Romans in Sappho and Catullus, but the romantic"
6322,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,note was singularly absent from European literature in the early
6323,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"medieval ages. Men loved then as they did before and after, but the"
6324,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,personal romantic love note was not considered a proper theme for
6325,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poetry. The religious and martial emotions held sway. Critics now admit
6326,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,that intense love poetry of the Troubadours appearing like an oasis in
6327,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the barren literature of the medieval ages was influenced by the Arabs,"
6328,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the rhymes as well as the themes being taken from the east. The
6329,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"troubadours influence the German Minnesingers, and these two groups"
6330,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,remain among the best composers of love poetry Europe has had.
6331,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6332,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"The troubadours also entered England, influencing its poetry for nearly"
6333,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,two centuries.[214:A]
6334,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6335,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The love element in the books of chivalry is due to Arabic influence.
6336,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Cervantes attributed his _Don Quixote_ to a Moorish author because the
6337,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Moors wrote so many romances. Early Italian poetry owed much to the love
6338,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poetry of Sicily which was impregnated with the Arabic spirit. Wyatt
6339,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"and Surrey, who traveled in Italy, greatly influenced English"
6340,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,literature. Thus Arabic poetry somewhat influenced English poetry.
6341,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Similarly the Spanish _Cid_ shows traces in marked degree of the Arabic
6342,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,invasion of Spain. No one has more enthusiastically and effectively
6343,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,pointed out the Arabic influences in European poetry than Sismondi in
6344,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,his history of the literature of the South of Europe. He begins the work
6345,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"with, after the introduction, a chapter on Arabic literature, and he"
6346,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,especially recognizes that the tenderness of the love sentiment and the
6347,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,chivalric attitude towards women came from the Arabs. The most
6348,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,sympathetic and exhaustive account of the great influence of Mohammedan
6349,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,influence upon Europe is in Samuel P. Scott's _History of the Moorish
6350,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Empire in Spain_.
6351,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6352,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"It is said that even the French poem, the _Chanson de Roland_, shows"
6353,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic traces since the Arab invasion had reached into France.
6354,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6355,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,We recognize that there is an invisible thread that binds together love
6356,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poems so remotely separated by time and place as those of the medieval
6357,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Persians, Arabs and Troubadours, and the modern English poets."
6358,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6359,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"The Arabic note of ecstasy is found even in the poems of Goethe,"
6360,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"especially in a few in his _West Eastern Divan_, influenced by his"
6361,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,studies of Oriental literature during the Napoleonic wars. He used his
6362,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"own experiences with eastern names, but he never failed to produce"
6363,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,literature of ecstasy. The Oriental romance also exerted an influence on
6364,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Beckford, Landor, Southey, Byron and Moore. Even Tennyson got the idea"
6365,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,of _Locksley Hall_ from reading Sir William Jones's prose translation of
6366,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the _Muallaqat_; Browning adopted an Arabian metre in his _Abt Vogler_;
6367,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,George Meredith's _The Shaving of Shagpat_ was written to emulate the
6368,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Arabian Nights_.
6369,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6370,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The Arabs excelled also in the elegy. Among the most famous elegies in
6371,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Arabic poetry are those of Khansa, a Pre-islamic poetess, on the murder"
6372,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of her two brothers. There is an account of her by Thomas C. Chenery, in"
6373,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the notes to his translation of Hariri's _Assemblies_ V. 1, pp. 387-391."
6374,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,In fact the elegy is more common among early Pre-islamic poetry than the
6375,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"love poem. The Orientals, particularly the medieval Hebrews, were always"
6376,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"distinguished in this kind of poetry. One of the best, certainly the"
6377,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"best in Turkish poetry, is the elegy by Baqui on the great Sultan"
6378,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Suleiman I, translated by E. J. W. Gibb in _Ottoman Poetry_."
6379,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6380,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The Arabian love poems and elegies are proofs that poetry was
6381,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"originally, as to-day, a personal cry, an outburst of emotion due to"
6382,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,repression. The cry of grief for the dead in battle; that is the note in
6383,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"all early literature, Occidental and Oriental."
6384,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6385,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The poem among the Arabs and Hebrews had also a definite utilitarian
6386,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,purpose. In early times satire was one of the chief forms under which
6387,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,lyric poetry appeared. The poet was employed to combat the enemy and his
6388,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"curses against them were supposed to be effective. He was a soothsayer,"
6389,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"a prophet, a magician. He voiced not only the communistic feeling of the"
6390,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"tribes, but his personal emotions. Even down to our day the public"
6391,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,demands that the poet write poems against the enemy in time of war.
6392,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Goethe was criticized for refusing to write against the French, for"
6393,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"example, but he explained later to Eckermann that he had no hatred"
6394,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,towards the French. In all wars there have been poets who have written
6395,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"against the enemy, but usually this kind of poetry has been of an"
6396,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,inferior order. It finds its own tomb in a poem like the famous _Hymn of
6397,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Hate_ by Lissauer in the late world war.
6398,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6399,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Nothing in literature illustrates more the belief in the magical power
6400,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,of poetry than the chapters in the _Book of Numbers_ dealing with the
6401,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,effort of the Moabite King Balak to get Balaam to curse the children of
6402,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Israel. Balak believed that these curses would help him defeat the
6403,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Hebrews. But instead Balaam blessed them, unwillingly, saying that he"
6404,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"could but utter the words God put in his mouth, for the inspiration of"
6405,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the poet came to him always from hidden forces. He reached to ecstasy
6406,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,every time he spoke.
6407,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6408,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Arabic poetry then deals in intricate forms conveying ecstasy, with all"
6409,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the stock themes of poetry, but especially with love."
6410,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6411,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The similarities between Biblical Hebrew poetry and Pre-islamic Arabic
6412,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poetry have been touched upon by Dr. George A. Smith in his _The Early
6413,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Poetry of Israel_ and by Thomas Chenery in his excellent introduction to
6414,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,his translation of Hariri's _Assemblies_. Participators in various
6415,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,military events themselves composed the poems in which they told of
6416,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"their exploits, as you may note by comparing the _Muallaqat_ with the"
6417,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,songs of Miriam and Deborah. There was the same interest in nature as
6418,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,you may see by comparing descriptions from the _Psalms_ and _Job_ to
6419,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,that of the thunderstorm by Imru'ul Qays in the _Muallaqat_. The poetry
6420,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of both nations was often nomadic, the product of the influences of the"
6421,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"desert. Both nations recorded personal emotions, springing from tribal"
6422,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,events.
6423,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6424,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,There was also the same tendency in both nations to utter ecstatically
6425,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"sententious and moral sayings. Though only one poem in the _Muallaqat_,"
6426,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"that by Zuhayr, really moralizes, the later Arabic poets always loved to"
6427,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"give vent to reflections, proverbs, words of wisdom. Two of the best"
6428,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic poems of the kind are the improvisations of the vagabond Abu Zayd
6429,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,in the 11th and 50th Assembly of Hariri's _Assemblies_. Two finer poems
6430,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,which moralize without losing their poetic quality can scarcely be found
6431,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,in Arabic literature. Most of the reflective poetry of those two
6432,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"pessimistic, skeptic poets Abu l'Atahiya and Abu 'l Ala al Maarri are of"
6433,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"this kind. The ecstatic potentiality in reflection is seen in _Job_,"
6434,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Proverbs_ and _Ecclesiastes_.
6435,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6436,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The chief phase of Pre-islamic poetry that will not appeal to us is in
6437,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the great body of martial verse where love of robbery and bloodshed,"
6438,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"cruelty, revenge and hatred are fostered. The Bedouins gave us a"
6439,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"transcript of their life. They dwelt in their vices with frankness, but"
6440,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,they tried to make virtues out of them. We cannot blame them for not
6441,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,having our ideals of peace and it is also doubtful if cruelties in their
6442,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,warfare were greater than those in our own day.
6443,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6444,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The poets before Islam sang about revenge and fighting in a way that
6445,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,even nauseates us. The martial spirit in the _Romance of Antar_ has made
6446,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"it less popular with us than _The Arabian Nights_, for the former work"
6447,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"is an account of the fighting Arabs of the desert, and the latter deals"
6448,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,largely with the merchant Arabs of the city. Even the great and
6449,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"beautiful _Song of Vengeance_ by the Arab Robin Hood, Ta abbata Sharran,"
6450,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of which we have a second hand translation by Goethe, and fine verse"
6451,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"versions by R. A. Nicholson, _Literary History of the Arabs_ (pp."
6452,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"98-100), and by Charles J. Lyall on pages 48-49 of _Arabic Poetry_, is"
6453,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,very cruel.
6454,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6455,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Pre-islamic poetry reeks too much with the ecstasy of delight to shed
6456,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"blood, in which tendency it of course differs little from the early"
6457,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poetry of other nations. However, the remarkable thing is that the"
6458,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,hearts of these warriors possessed so many fine feelings. One of the
6459,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"noblest descriptions of woman is by a companion of the brigand Sharran,"
6460,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"from the _Mufaddaliyyat_, a translation of which appears on pages 81-82"
6461,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,of Lyall's volume.
6462,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6463,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The Arabian poetry which has been most frequently translated and written
6464,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"about in English is Pre-islamic poetry. In especial, the _Muallaqat_, or"
6465,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the seven so-called suspended poems, has been translated several times."
6466,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Sir William Jones made the first translation in prose in the eighteenth
6467,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"century. In modern times we have had several translations, one by"
6468,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Wilfrid Blunt and his wife. There has been considerable support for the
6469,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,critical view that these poems represent the highest achievement of
6470,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Arabic poetry, both among Arabs themselves and Aryan critics. Imru'ul"
6471,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Qays, who flourished in the sixth century A.D., is the most famous of"
6472,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the poets in the collection, and is regarded by many as the greatest"
6473,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabian poet. R. A. Nicholson and Clement Huart have given accounts of
6474,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the _Muallaqat_ in their histories of Arabic Literature. Professor
6475,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Mackail has published in his Oxford Lectures an essay on these odes and
6476,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,D. Nöldeke has given us a full study of them in the _Encyclopedia
6477,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Britannica_. I shall not therefore dwell on them except to say that they
6478,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"were collected in the eighth century by Hammad, and that most of these"
6479,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poems deal with warriors rather than lovers, though they contain love"
6480,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,laments.
6481,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6482,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Nicholson and others regard the Abbasid period as the great era of
6483,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Arabic poets. This period extended from the accession of Saffah in 749
6484,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"to the destruction of Bagdad by the Mongols in 1258. Abu Nuwas, Abu 'l"
6485,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Atahiya, Mutanabbi and Abu 'l Ala al Maarri are recognized by Nicholson"
6486,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"as the Gods of Arabian poetry, and we in our smug inordinate"
6487,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"satisfaction with Aryan poetry, have not even translated or paid"
6488,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"attention to them. Abu Nuwas, who flourished in the early part of the"
6489,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"ninth century, sang of love and wine and led a riotous and immoral"
6490,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"life, and is familiar to the reader of the _Arabian Nights_ as the"
6491,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,jester of Harun al Rashid. His _Divan_ is to be found in German but not
6492,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,in English. Many consider him the greatest of the Arabian poets. Abu 'l

6494,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,by Harun for having ceased writing love poetry because he was hopelessly
6495,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,in love with a slave girl. He described common emotions and used simple
6496,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,language instead of far-fetched conceits. Mutanabbi in the tenth century
6497,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"was the most famous of all the Arabian poets, but he is criticized by"
6498,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,many for his rhetoric and ornament. He is the master of the grand style.

6501,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"translated some of his verses into English, and Bauerlein has also"
6502,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,devoted a little volume to him in _The Wisdom of the East_ series. Abu
6503,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,'l Ala is the most modern of the Arabian poets. He was a freethinker and
6504,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,a pessimist and his _Luzumiyyat_ reads like a work of one of our
6505,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,rational poets. It attacks all religion including Islam. His letters

6567,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6568,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,One of the great products of Arabic culture was its work in literary
6569,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,criticism. While it is the fashion to-day to lay much stress on the
6570,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Italian and English studies of Aristotle's _Poetics_ in the Renaissance
6571,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"and Elizabethan periods respectively, the Arabs were writing learnedly"
6572,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,on poetry centuries before they read the _Poetics_. They made a
6573,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"specialty of the literature called the Adab, or belles lettres made up"
6574,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of criticism, quotation and rhetoric."
6575,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6576,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The criticism of poetry flourished among the Arabs in the ninth and
6577,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,tenth centuries A.D. as a higher art than it did in the sixteenth
6578,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,century among the Italians and English. Unfortunately none of these
6579,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,works have been translated; there is not even a reference to their
6580,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,influence in Saintsbury's _History of Criticism in Europe_. The Arabs
6581,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,had so many poets even in Pre-islamic times in the sixth century that
6582,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,interest in preserving this poetry gave rise later to anthologists who
6583,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,made collections. These anthologists commented on the poetical work and
6584,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"compared it with that of later periods, and with that of their"
6585,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,contemporaries.
6586,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6587,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Ibn Yunus in the early part of the tenth century translated Aristotle's
6588,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Poetics_ into Arabic and the Europeans learned of Aristotle's work from
6589,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the Arabs several centuries later. But the best Arabic works on the art
6590,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of poetry had, however, already been produced, presenting original ideas"
6591,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"gleaned from the study of the great Arabian poets, and illustrated by"
6592,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,examples from them. The Arabic critics did not go to the Greek and Roman
6593,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poems (which they considered cold besides their own) as did the Italians
6594,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and English to study the nature of poetry. The Arabs studied Greek
6595,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"science, medicine, and philosophy, but not Greek poetry. Books on"
6596,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,prosody and poetry appeared after the founding of the system of Arabic
6597,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,meters by Khalil b. Ahmad in the eighth century. There were also the two
6598,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"celebrated schools of grammarians at Basra and Kufa, soon to merge in"
6599,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the school of Bagdad. Never before had the art of poetry and criticism
6600,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,flourished so thrivingly and displayed a so generally high order as
6601,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"among the Arabs in the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. A"
6602,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"faint idea of the great number of Arabian grammarians, critics and poets"
6603,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"may be gleaned by perusing the biographical dictionary of Ibn Khallikan,"
6604,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"who flourished in the thirteenth century. This work, which contains only"
6605,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"a partial list, has been compared to the _Life of Johnson_, by Boswell"
6606,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"(Lucas called him a Bagdad Boswell), and to _Plutarch's Lives_."
6607,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6608,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"While Europe was plunged in ignorance and barbarism, the great Arab"
6609,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poets and critics were achieving work that belongs to the best; but
6610,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"alas, the very names which rank so high among them are unknown to most"
6611,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,people. We let them slumber in the difficult Arabic. We translate the
6612,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Chinese and Japanese poems probably more out of faddish reasons than of
6613,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"a true love of their poetry, but we ignore the Arabians."
6614,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6615,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The Arab example contradicts the famous platitude that great epochs of
6616,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,creative literary work are not ages of literary criticism. It is just
6617,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the reverse. Good criticism is never so conspicuous as in ages of
6618,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poetry, for there is such interest in poetry as to provoke literary"
6619,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"discussion, then more so than ever. The best criticism of poetry"
6620,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,appeared in England in the great age of Wordsworth and Byron. The Arabic
6621,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,grammarians and anthologists began their work about the middle of the
6622,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,eighth century. Incredible stories are told of their feats of memory for
6623,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"verse, in the art of improvisation, in skill in manipulating the"
6624,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"language. They regarded the letters of their alphabet as human beings,"
6625,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,just as the Hebrew Cabbalists treated their alphabetical letters as
6626,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,angels.
6627,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6628,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"To name even the most important of grammarians, anthologists,"
6629,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"philologists, critics of Arabia, is to call a long list. Even"
6630,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"historians, philosophers, scientists and theologians entered the field"
6631,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of poetic criticism. Every one quoted the poets, consequently poetry was"
6632,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,bound up not only with criticism but with Arabic thought. One of the
6633,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"most quoted Arabic critics is Ibn Rashiq, of the eleventh century, whose"
6634,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Umda_ or _Pillar of the Art of Poetry_ is mentioned often by Ibn
6635,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Khaldun, the historian. The latter also names four great Arabic writers"
6636,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"of Adab, Ibn Qutayba's _Accomplishments of the Secretary_ (Ibn Qutayba's"
6637,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,_Book of Poetry and Poets_ is more often cited by other writers than the
6638,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"_Accomplishments of the Secretary_), Jahiz's _Book of Eloquence and"
6639,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Exposition_, al Mubarrad's _Perfect_, all of the ninth century, and in"
6640,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Spain Abu Ali al Qali's _Curious Notions_, of the tenth century, whose"
6641,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"_Book of Dictations_, however, is better known."
6642,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6643,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Among the writers on poetry in the manner of the Arabs was the Hebrew
6644,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poet and critic, Moses Ibn Ezra, author of the _Conversations and"
6645,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Recollections_, which was the first study of the kind in Hebrew and the"
6646,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,first criticism of the poetry of the Bible from an aesthetic point of
6647,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"view. Among Arab critics to whom he is indebted, besides the"
6648,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"aforementioned Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Rashiq, are the first book in Arabian"
6649,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"_Poetics_ proper, by the Caliph, Ibn ul Mutazz, of the latter part of"
6650,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"the ninth century, a work by Qudama, and _Ornaments of Conversation_, by"
6651,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Al Hatimi, both of the tenth century."
6652,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6653,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,There are many other works that were well known and often cited in
6654,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Arabic literary circles. I shall name only Tha'alibi (died 1037), whose"
6655,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"_Solitaire of Time_ had many continuations by later critics, and the"
6656,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"famous _Fihrist_ or _Index_ by the Bookseller, Ibn Ishaq (tenth"
6657,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"century), one of the sections of which deal with poetry."
6658,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6659,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Ibn Khaldun, the historian, and a contemporary of Chaucer in the"
6660,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"thirteenth century, devoted a number of chapters to poetry in the"
6661,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,introduction to his famous history.
6662,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6663,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,As a specimen of poetic criticism among the Arabs and as a corrective to
6664,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,the general impression that ornament and not ecstasy counted in Arabic
6665,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"poetry, I give the following English rendering from De Slane's French"
6666,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,translation of Khaldun's _Prolegomena_:
6667,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6668,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,One of the conditions imposed in the use of this art (of
6669,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,ornament) is that the embellishments appear in the piece quite
6670,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"naturally, without the author's labor in searching for them"
6671,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and without his being anxious about the effect that they
6672,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"should produce. If they present themselves naturally, there is"
6673,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"nothing to object to them, for not being purposely introduced,"
6674,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,they save the subject the fault of lapsing into barbarism; but
6675,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,when one imposes upon himself the task of painfully seeking
6676,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"these embellishments, he is led to neglect the principles"
6677,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"which rule the combination of words, which are the foundation"
6678,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,of the discourse; this injures the principles of clearness of
6679,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,expression and causes the distinctness and precision which
6680,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"ought to characterize the discourse, to disappear; nothing"
6681,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,then remains but the embellishments. . . . Another condition
6682,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,which should be observed in regard to the science of ornaments
6683,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,is to make a rare use of it; that the poet apply it to two or
6684,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,three verses of a poem; that will suffice to give elegance
6685,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and luster to the entire piece. The too frequent use of
6686,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"embellishments is a fault, as Ibn Rashiq and others have"
6687,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,said. . . . All that we pointed out shows that the artificial
6688,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"discourse (or style), when one writes it laboriously and as a"
6689,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"task, is inferior in merit to the natural discourse, for one"
6690,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,neglects thereby too many fundamental principles of the art of
6691,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,speaking well. I leave it to good taste to judge thereof.
6692,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6693,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,The Arabs then regarded poetry as ecstatic utterances emanating from the
6694,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"unconscious, embodying an idea, and produced with little ornament. This"
6695,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,despite their belief that poetry must use the established forms of metre
6696,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,and figures. It is unfortunate that even to the present day these old
6697,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"forms are used, while Turkish literature has only very recently been"
6698,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,emancipated from them. Even Arabian political articles are to-day
6699,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"written in rhymed prose. But as Chenery said, the history of rhymed"
6700,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,prose is the history of Arabic literature. Rhyme is natural to the
6701,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Arabic language, whereas it is really foreign to the English language."
6702,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6703,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,If European civilization could free itself from the prejudices against
6704,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Semitic and Asiatic culture, and if the universities, instead of"
6705,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,studying minutely the barren medieval literature of Europe before the
6706,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Renaissance, would give fuller courses in the poetry of the Arabs,"
6707,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Hebrews, Persians and Turks, the exchange would be salutary. The only"
6708,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Asiatic literature that Europe made an attempt to study was that of the
6709,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Hindus, and, as has been suspected by many, this may have been done"
6710,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"chiefly out of Aryan vanity, to show that the earliest culture was not"
6711,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Semitic but Aryan, and thus related to European culture. But the fact"
6712,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,remains that the poetry of these four nations mentioned is far superior
6713,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"to that of medieval Europe. The two nations who were not Semitic, the"
6714,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Persians and the Ottoman Turks, are almost wholly imbued with the"
6715,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Semitic spirit. Persian poetry grew out of Arabic poetry, just as"
6716,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,Ottoman poetry developed from Persian poetry. There is nothing of the
6717,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Tartar spirit at all in Ottoman poetry, as Gibb has pointed out."
6718,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6719,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"That poetry is subjective, lyric, ecstatic, is best seen in Oriental"
6720,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,poetry. It will repay the lover of literature to read such works as
6721,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Browne's _Literary History of Persia_, Gibb's _History of Ottoman"
6722,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Poetry_, and Nicholson's _Literary History of the Arabs_. As for"
6723,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Post-biblical poetry of the Hebrews, so rich in patriotic and moral"
6724,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"fervor, and in hymns and elegies, there are articles in the _Jewish"
6725,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"Encyclopedia_, chapters in Graetz's _History of the Jews_ and works on"
6726,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,various phases of it by numerous writers.
6727,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,
6728,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"To the Oriental, poetry is ecstasy first and last, and this is all the"
6729,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"more remarkable since their poetry is so much more ornate, artificial,"
6730,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"figurative, and patterned than European poetry. It is sensuous,"
6731,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"passionate but not ""simple."" Its chief inferiority to European poetry,"
6732,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,"however, springs from its lack in intellectual profundity, and its"
6733,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,severance (except in the Prophets of the Bible) from problems of social
6734,LOVE ECSTASY IN ARABIAN POETRY,justice.

6759,CONCLUSION,"I have not tried to present a theory of poetry, so much as to point out"
6760,CONCLUSION,certain features of a particular kind of writing which I have called the
6761,CONCLUSION,literature of ecstasy. It has developed that I really used the word
6762,CONCLUSION,ecstasy in the same sense that the other critics have employed the terms
6763,CONCLUSION,"unconscious, imagination, poetry. I think I have shown that the"
6764,CONCLUSION,literature of ecstasy even when in prose is synonymous with poetry as
6765,CONCLUSION,"understood by Shakespeare when he used ""frenzy"" and ""things unknown"" in"
6766,CONCLUSION,"reference to the poet. I have also, I hope, pointed out that an ecstatic"
6767,CONCLUSION,presentation of intellectual and moral ideas results often in a great
6768,CONCLUSION,poetic product.
6769,CONCLUSION,
6770,CONCLUSION,I do not purpose to teach any one how to write poetry or the literature
6771,CONCLUSION,"of ecstasy. If my views have any value, it lies in helping us recognize"
6772,CONCLUSION,"the literature of ecstasy. It is in aiding us to eliminate much trivial,"
6773,CONCLUSION,"flimsy, unecstatic free verse and regular verse from the sphere of"
6774,CONCLUSION,poetry. It lies in inducing us to include much emotional prose as
6775,CONCLUSION,"poetry. Since men, however, entertain so many diverse views on life,"
6776,CONCLUSION,"morals, and social justice, it can never be possible for critics to"
6777,CONCLUSION,"agree as to which literature of ecstasy is the best, for its value is"
6778,CONCLUSION,affected by the question as to the truth of the ideals therein
6779,CONCLUSION,maintained. Every one thinks that he can determine what are the merits
6780,CONCLUSION,of a book. Those who have mastered the rules of prosody are certain that
6781,CONCLUSION,they can judge the qualities of poetry. But only those critics can
6782,CONCLUSION,"recognize great poetry whose moral, intellectual and aesthetic faculties"
6783,CONCLUSION,are well balanced. It is true that the master of rules of prosody can
6784,CONCLUSION,"tell whether a verse poem follows the rules, he can perceive whether the"

6786,CONCLUSION,figures are not far fetched and whether the diction is good; and a
6787,CONCLUSION,commonplace mind may recognize the ordinary literature of ecstasy. But
6788,CONCLUSION,the chief obstacle to recognizing poetry is that most people derive
6789,CONCLUSION,their views as to what poetry is from rules formulated from the writings
6790,CONCLUSION,of older poets. If the great poets of the world had never used a
6791,CONCLUSION,"patterned form, there would have been no text books welding poetry and"
6792,CONCLUSION,versification together. A great poet not only creates his own forms but
6793,CONCLUSION,displays individuality in the choice of views and ideas. When he becomes
6794,CONCLUSION,"recognized, new rules are formulated from his work, and are even used as"
6795,CONCLUSION,a fetter to bind later poets and critics.
6796,CONCLUSION,
6797,CONCLUSION,Anthologists have often been of great value in choosing for us the
6798,CONCLUSION,literature of ecstasy as written by so-called minor and popular poets
6799,CONCLUSION,who have taken no position in the history of the world's literature. A
6800,CONCLUSION,"poet, however, is not great because he has succeeded in producing a few"
6801,CONCLUSION,pieces that belong truly to the literature of ecstasy. Nor does a poet
6802,CONCLUSION,who once held a high place in the list of poets and has subsequently
6803,CONCLUSION,lost it by the vicissitudes of taste or circumstances or by the change
6804,CONCLUSION,"in ideas, cease being a poet to us if he has written poems that belong"
6805,CONCLUSION,"to the literature of ecstasy. No one, for example, to-day regards Jean"
6806,CONCLUSION,"Ingelow as a great poet, but the anthologists who select her _When"
6807,CONCLUSION,"Sparrows Build_ or _High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire_, justly"
6808,CONCLUSION,accept these poems as poetry. It will astonish many people who will take
6809,CONCLUSION,"the trouble to go through the work of some so-called minor poets, say"
6810,CONCLUSION,"Philip Bourke Marston, to find gems here and there that properly are"
6811,CONCLUSION,part of the literature of ecstasy.
6812,CONCLUSION,
6813,CONCLUSION,"My theory, I hope, also helps us to determine when certain branches of"
6814,CONCLUSION,"literature are poetry and when they are not. For example, there has"
6815,CONCLUSION,"always been a dispute as to whether oratory, comedy and satire are"
6816,CONCLUSION,really poetry. There have been critics who would not admit that these
6817,CONCLUSION,"species of writing are properly poetry, even in verse; on the other"
6818,CONCLUSION,"hand, other critics have asserted that they are poetry."
6819,CONCLUSION,
6820,CONCLUSION,"When, if ever, is oratory poetry? Whenever ecstasy and not rhetoric"
6821,CONCLUSION,"characterizes it, when universal themes of permanent interest and not"
6822,CONCLUSION,arguments on a temporal political or economic question are its
6823,CONCLUSION,"substance, then oratory is poetry. A plea for adherence to the"
6824,CONCLUSION,"principles of a political party, a speech about an economic problem, is"
6825,CONCLUSION,not as a rule poetry. But why are some of Moses's speeches and the
6826,CONCLUSION,orations of the prophets poetry? Why is Mark Antony's verse funeral
6827,CONCLUSION,"oration on Cæsar, poetry? Surely not because of the verse? Why are some"
6828,CONCLUSION,"of Bossuet's funeral orations, or Thucydides's speech in prose, poetry?"
6829,CONCLUSION,"All of these orations belong to the domain of the literature of ecstasy,"
6830,CONCLUSION,and hence are poetry.
6831,CONCLUSION,
6832,CONCLUSION,"Nevertheless, oratory is usually hollow and bombastic. The orator makes"
6833,CONCLUSION,his appeal to men chiefly by rhetorical expression of commonplaces.
6834,CONCLUSION,Eloquence and artifice count here more than thought or art. The less
6835,CONCLUSION,intellect the audience has the better does the orator succeed. Hazlitt
6836,CONCLUSION,saw the limitations of oratory. It is the unthinking man who is appealed
6837,CONCLUSION,"to by theatrical effects. The orator must be commonplace, he cannot"
6838,CONCLUSION,deliver profound views. Some of the great orations of the world's
6839,CONCLUSION,literature that are poetry are those that were never really delivered
6840,CONCLUSION,"but composed by the historians, like the emotional speeches in"
6841,CONCLUSION,Thucydides and Tacitus. You can find poems in orations by Demosthenes
6842,CONCLUSION,"and Cicero also, but Fourth of July orations are seldom poetry. Nor is"
6843,CONCLUSION,the _Congressional Record_ an anthology of poetic masterpieces. In a
6844,CONCLUSION,"footnote in his book in aesthetics, _The Critique of Judgment_, Kant has"
6845,CONCLUSION,ably elucidated the situation.
6846,CONCLUSION,
6847,CONCLUSION,I must admit that a beautiful poem has always given me a pure
6848,CONCLUSION,"gratification; whilst the reading of the best discourse,"
6849,CONCLUSION,whether of a Roman orator or of a modern parliamentary speaker
6850,CONCLUSION,"or of a preacher, has always been mingled with an unpleasant"
6851,CONCLUSION,"feeling of disapprobation, of a treacherous art, which means"
6852,CONCLUSION,to move me in important matters like machines to a judgment
6853,CONCLUSION,that must lose all weight for them on quiet reflection.
6854,CONCLUSION,Readiness and accuracy in speaking (which taken together
6855,CONCLUSION,constitute rhetoric) belong to beautiful art; but the art of
6856,CONCLUSION,"the orator, the art of availing one's self of the weaknesses"
6857,CONCLUSION,of men for one's own design (whether these be well meant or
6858,CONCLUSION,"even actually good, does not matter) is worthy of no respect."
6859,CONCLUSION,
6860,CONCLUSION,"We must not confuse eloquence with poetry, though there are numerous"
6861,CONCLUSION,prose pieces which though eloquent are yet poetry. Mere wordiness and
6862,CONCLUSION,grandiloquence may sound like ecstasy yet lack that quality.
6863,CONCLUSION,
6864,CONCLUSION,What can be said for famous passages like Burke's sympathetic outburst
6865,CONCLUSION,for Marie Antoinette? I see no reason why we should not call this
6866,CONCLUSION,"poetry, though it is not poetry of a high order. The objection to it is"
6867,CONCLUSION,that the orator's emotion is misdirected; he wastes sympathy on a dead
6868,CONCLUSION,"queen who was at the head of a pernicious system, and ignores the"
6869,CONCLUSION,miseries of the thousands of poor Frenchmen. To that extent our
6870,CONCLUSION,appreciation of it is limited. For even though Burke was right when he
6871,CONCLUSION,"lamented that the age of chivalry was gone, he did not state that the"
6872,CONCLUSION,"time of exploitation of man was over, and the question of exploitation"
6873,CONCLUSION,is probably more important than that of chivalry.
6874,CONCLUSION,
6875,CONCLUSION,"There is affinity of oratory then to poetry, as it is calculated to"
6876,CONCLUSION,arouse the emotions of the audience. But the political oration is
6877,CONCLUSION,"usually not poetry, as it has a tendency to the ephemeral. No one will"
6878,CONCLUSION,"deny, however, that there is genuine prose poetry in orations by"
6879,CONCLUSION,"Demosthenes, Cicero, Burke, Webster and Sumner."
6880,CONCLUSION,
6881,CONCLUSION,"What is true of the oration, is also true of the sermon. Sermons like"
6882,CONCLUSION,those of Jeremy Taylor and Sterne contain poetry; they have ecstasy.
6883,CONCLUSION,
6884,CONCLUSION,There has also been considerable confusion as to how much poetry exists
6885,CONCLUSION,"in witty and humorous writings and in comedy. In other words, the"
6886,CONCLUSION,"connection between poetry and tears is well established, but that"
6887,CONCLUSION,between poetry and laughter is vague. We may say that most of the
6888,CONCLUSION,"so-called humorous verse is not poetry at all, for the merely funny does"
6889,CONCLUSION,not merit the term poetry. Yet there is poetry in the humorous writings
6890,CONCLUSION,"of men like Mark Twain and O. Henry, on account of the ecstatic effect"
6891,CONCLUSION,upon the reader. In reading them one occasionally feels impelled to
6892,CONCLUSION,"tears, while moved to laughter. A mere witticism is not poetry, but it"
6893,CONCLUSION,"may have certain qualities, such as a bit of wisdom conveying ecstasy,"
6894,CONCLUSION,which makes it poetry. The wit of Heine and Voltaire often belongs to
6895,CONCLUSION,"this class. When laughter is bound up with a profound idea or emotion,"
6896,CONCLUSION,"the work expressing the laugh becomes poetry. However, laughter that"
6897,CONCLUSION,"springs from seeing horse-play or the mere ludicrous, is not poetry. But"
6898,CONCLUSION,"the portrayals of Sancho Panza, Falstaff and Parson Adams are poems."
6899,CONCLUSION,
6900,CONCLUSION,Meredith has presented the case of the comic spirit better than any one
6901,CONCLUSION,"else. He says: ""The comic spirit is not hostile to the sweetest song"
6902,CONCLUSION,"fully poetic,"" and he shows how this spirit enters the work of"
6903,CONCLUSION,"Menander, Aristophanes, Chaucer, Terence, Rabelais, Shakespeare,"
6904,CONCLUSION,"Cervantes, the Restoration Comedians, Pope, Molière, Fielding, Smollett."
6905,CONCLUSION,"These men were all poets; that is, they gave us poems here and there in"
6906,CONCLUSION,their work. Meredith might have added Dickens's and his own work among
6907,CONCLUSION,comic works that contain poetry. The writers of comedy deal with
6908,CONCLUSION,feelings and emotions; most of them were men of intellect and deep
6909,CONCLUSION,feeling.
6910,CONCLUSION,
6911,CONCLUSION,"In a passage that is itself a poem, Meredith describes the Comic spirit,"
6912,CONCLUSION,which he recognized as allied to poetry. And this in part is his
6913,CONCLUSION,delineation of it:
6914,CONCLUSION,
6915,CONCLUSION,"It has the sage's brows, and the sunny malice of the faun"
6916,CONCLUSION,lurks at the corners of the half-closed lips drawn in an idle
6917,CONCLUSION,"wariness of half tension. That slim feasting smile, shaped"
6918,CONCLUSION,"like the long-bow, was once a big round satyr's laugh, that"
6919,CONCLUSION,flung up the brows like a fortress lifted by gunpowder. The
6920,CONCLUSION,"laugh will come again, but it will be of the order of the"
6921,CONCLUSION,"smile, finely tempered, showing sunlight of the mind, mental"
6922,CONCLUSION,richness rather than noisy enormity. Its common aspect is one
6923,CONCLUSION,"of unsolicitous observation, as if surveying a full field and"
6924,CONCLUSION,"having leisure to dart on its chosen morsels, without any"
6925,CONCLUSION,fluttering eagerness. Men's future upon earth does not attract
6926,CONCLUSION,it; their honesty and shapeliness in the present does; and
6927,CONCLUSION,"wherever they wax out of proportion, overblown, affected,"
6928,CONCLUSION,"pretentious, bombastical, hypocritical, pedantic,"
6929,CONCLUSION,fantastically delicate; whenever it sees them self-deceived or
6930,CONCLUSION,"hoodwinked, given to run riot in idolatries, drifting into"
6931,CONCLUSION,"vanities, congregating in absurdities, planning"
6932,CONCLUSION,"shortsightedly, plotting dementedly; whenever they are at"
6933,CONCLUSION,"variance with their professions, and violate the unwritten but"
6934,CONCLUSION,perceptible laws binding them in consideration one to another;
6935,CONCLUSION,"whenever they offend sound reason, fair justice; are false in"
6936,CONCLUSION,"humility or mined with conceit, individually or in the"
6937,CONCLUSION,bulk--the Spirit overhead will look humanely malign and cast
6938,CONCLUSION,"an oblique light on them, followed by volleys of silvery"
6939,CONCLUSION,laughter. That is the Comic Spirit.
6940,CONCLUSION,
6941,CONCLUSION,Closely akin to the comic genius is that of satire. Again satire is not
6942,CONCLUSION,"poetry, except when presenting ideas and evoking ecstasy. There used to"
6943,CONCLUSION,"be a distinct form of verse poetry called the satire, but there is often"
6944,CONCLUSION,"more or less satire in the works of novelists, prose dramatists and"
6945,CONCLUSION,"essayists. We have as remnants of great ancient satire, poems by Horace"
6946,CONCLUSION,"and Juvenal, tales by Apuleius and Petronius and the prose dialogues of"
6947,CONCLUSION,Lucian.
6948,CONCLUSION,
6949,CONCLUSION,The great masters of satire in modern times have done their work in
6950,CONCLUSION,"prose and much of this is poetry. We think of Rabelais, Swift, Voltaire,"
6951,CONCLUSION,Anatole France and Samuel Butler. There is plenty of poetry in the
6952,CONCLUSION,"_Penguin Island_ and _Erewhon_, for example. Modern satire is prone to"
6953,CONCLUSION,"be more poetical than the ancient verse satire, being free from"
6954,CONCLUSION,"coarseness and insult, and abounding in ideas. Satire is not mere"
6955,CONCLUSION,"ranting and cursing, but a keen and amusing way of showing forth human"
6956,CONCLUSION,follies. You find it in writers as different as Thackeray and Bernard
6957,CONCLUSION,Shaw. Some of the satire in Sinclair Lewis's novel _Main Street_ is
6958,CONCLUSION,excellent poetry.
6959,CONCLUSION,
6960,CONCLUSION,"The highest form of satire in all the prose writers is poetry, as much"
6961,CONCLUSION,so as if put in the heroic couplets of Pope or the ottava rima of
6962,CONCLUSION,Byron's _Vision of Last Judgment_.
6963,CONCLUSION,
6964,CONCLUSION,Satire is poetry when it is universal. Much of the old Arabic poetry was
6965,CONCLUSION,satire and yet genuine poetry. Pope's satires are poetry. Lafcadio Hearn
6966,CONCLUSION,has said a few words on the subject that deserve quoting:
6967,CONCLUSION,
6968,CONCLUSION,It is not because the satires (of Pope) were true pictures or
6969,CONCLUSION,"caricatures of any living person in particular, but because"
6970,CONCLUSION,they were true pictures of general types of human weakness
6971,CONCLUSION,"which have always existed, which exist to-day and which will"
6972,CONCLUSION,"exist to-morrow. (_Life and Literature_, p. 286.)"
6973,CONCLUSION,
6974,CONCLUSION,My theory of poetry as ecstasy also seeks to do away with the tendency
6975,CONCLUSION,of criticism to identify poetry with the figure of speech or trope. Even
6976,CONCLUSION,"when it has lacked the quality which fills the reader with ecstasy, the"
6977,CONCLUSION,trope has been called poetry just because it was a trope. Imagery has
6978,CONCLUSION,"been confused with imagination, and many critics regard that as poetry"
6979,CONCLUSION,which makes the most frequent use of unusual figures of speech. As a
6980,CONCLUSION,"result, some of the figures of speech in poetry to-day are more"
6981,CONCLUSION,artificial even than those found in Oriental poetry. But no one can take
6982,CONCLUSION,issue with the beautiful figures such as appear in the _Bible_ and in
6983,CONCLUSION,"Dante, in Shelley and Keats, of which the essence is a beautiful flight"
6984,CONCLUSION,of the imagination that fills us with ecstasy. But when freakish tropes
6985,CONCLUSION,take the place of poetry then we ought to rebel. We like the figure of
6986,CONCLUSION,"speech introduced occasionally and naturally, and we don't want the"
6987,CONCLUSION,figure substituted for ideas and emotions.
6988,CONCLUSION,
6989,CONCLUSION,"One critic even, Hudson Maxim, has written a book on _The Science of"
6990,CONCLUSION,"Poetry_, to identify poetry with the figure of speech. In spite of its"
6991,CONCLUSION,"eccentricities, and its attempt at creation of new terms like"
6992,CONCLUSION,"tro-tempotentry, the author recognizes that the critics confuse poetry"
6993,CONCLUSION,"with metre, and that a prose writer like Robert Ingersoll was a poet."
6994,CONCLUSION,"Any one who had read Ingersoll's prose poems, and some of his orations"
6995,CONCLUSION,"like the one on _Liberty in Literature_, will recognize this. The"
6996,CONCLUSION,"mistake that Maxim makes is to call poetry defiantly a science, and then"
6997,CONCLUSION,to define it as an art in which figures of speech count most. To create
6998,CONCLUSION,"figures of speech is an art. Maxim's definition of poetry is ""The"
6999,CONCLUSION,"expression of insensuous thought in sensuous terms by artistic trope."""
7000,CONCLUSION,"This definition covers much of ancient poetry, when man constantly used"
7001,CONCLUSION,tropes or figures of speech. It is also true that a vast body of the
7002,CONCLUSION,world's poetry is full of tropes like metaphors and similes. In fact
7003,CONCLUSION,even our free verse is full of them. But the figure of speech is only
7004,CONCLUSION,"one of the features that are often present in poetry, and we may and do"
7005,CONCLUSION,have the best poetry without it. Its frequent use has become a nuisance;
7006,CONCLUSION,"it often atones for lack of ideas, it is often a sign of insincerity in"
7007,CONCLUSION,"the poet, and it occasionally bespeaks a raving imagination. The day of"
7008,CONCLUSION,"tropes in poetry is, in spite of the Imagists, on the decline. You find"
7009,CONCLUSION,none of them in prose plays and very few in prose fiction. The trope was
7010,CONCLUSION,an early adornment of poetry as rhythm was. It is not the essence of
7011,CONCLUSION,"poetry, though it often beautifies poetry."
7012,CONCLUSION,
7013,CONCLUSION,The critics do not accept the book of Maxim's as a true statement of the
7014,CONCLUSION,"aims of poetry, but curiously enough they have always followed the views"
7015,CONCLUSION,"in his book. They have confused tropes, or figures of speech, or imagery"
7016,CONCLUSION,with imagination. In the past the older critics fell into this error and
7017,CONCLUSION,when they spoke of imagination they were really expatiating on imagery.
7018,CONCLUSION,
7019,CONCLUSION,"One of the best English critics on poetry, Leigh Hunt, sinned in this"
7020,CONCLUSION,direction. Like Wordsworth and Coleridge he made much of the distinction
7021,CONCLUSION,between imagination and fancy. Wordsworth arranged his poems in an
7022,CONCLUSION,edition of his works according to this distinction. Leigh Hunt got up an
7023,CONCLUSION,"anthology called _Imagination and Fancy_, in which he italicized the"
7024,CONCLUSION,"imaginative and the fanciful passages, and to which he prefixed his"
7025,CONCLUSION,"famous essay on ""What is Poetry?"" Here he gave his definitions of and"
7026,CONCLUSION,distinctions between imagination and fancy. Half the essay is devoted
7027,CONCLUSION,really to identifying them with figures of speech. The only difference
7028,CONCLUSION,between the two faculties was that fancy was a lighter play of the
7029,CONCLUSION,"imagination, a distinction really utterly trivial. His work was needed"
7030,CONCLUSION,"at a time when the influence of Pope still ruled, and people could not"
7031,CONCLUSION,appreciate the rich figures in Shelley and Keats. Pater called attention
7032,CONCLUSION,"to the real distinction between imagination and fancy which is ""between"
7033,CONCLUSION,higher and lower degrees of intensity in the poet's perception of his
7034,CONCLUSION,"work, and in his concentration of himself upon his work."" For all"
7035,CONCLUSION,"purposes, however, fancy may be included under imagination. Imagery is"
7036,CONCLUSION,"not always imaginative, for many figures of speech have no ecstatic"
7037,CONCLUSION,quality.
7038,CONCLUSION,
7039,CONCLUSION,The English poets who were regarded as most gifted with the faculty of
7040,CONCLUSION,"imagination under the old definition were Milton and Spenser, chiefly"
7041,CONCLUSION,for their bold use of supernatural imagery. Homer and Dante were always
7042,CONCLUSION,"noted for their beautiful and effective similes, and they were also the"
7043,CONCLUSION,poets of the imagination _par excellence_. The confusion of imagery with
7044,CONCLUSION,imagination resulted in giving figures of speech a significance in
7045,CONCLUSION,determining the nature of poetry that it did not merit. Puttenham's book
7046,CONCLUSION,"in the Elizabethan Age, _The Arte of English Poesie_, was half employed"
7047,CONCLUSION,with ornament or various figures. Oriental poetry was especially
7048,CONCLUSION,figurative; all Oriental books on rhetoric deal extensively with figures
7049,CONCLUSION,of speech. In short it was taken for granted by all critics that poetry
7050,CONCLUSION,"was imagery or figures of speech, because poetry was a product of the"
7051,CONCLUSION,"imagination, and imagination was confused with imagery. It is true that"
7052,CONCLUSION,"it is the function of the imagination to compare, but that does not mean"
7053,CONCLUSION,that it is nothing more than metaphor or simile. The tropes were more
7054,CONCLUSION,natural to early man who personified inanimate things and always saw
7055,CONCLUSION,resemblances to draw from in nature. To-day the novelist or dramatist
7056,CONCLUSION,"introduces his metaphor or simile occasionally or naturally, as an"
7057,CONCLUSION,ornamental touch to convey his meaning better. Many modern versifiers
7058,CONCLUSION,"identify poetry with ornament and figures, and it is impossible for"
7059,CONCLUSION,"them to write a poem without a succession of figures. The trope, like"
7060,CONCLUSION,"the rhythm, is supposed to be poetry. Hunt's essay defines poetry as"
7061,CONCLUSION,imaginative passion in versification. He can conceive of no passion
7062,CONCLUSION,being poetry unless presented in metre with figures of speech. His essay
7063,CONCLUSION,"is divided into two parts, the one dealing with imagination, or rather"
7064,CONCLUSION,"imagery, the other with versification. Great critic that he was, he gave"
7065,CONCLUSION,us one of the weakest definitions of poetry we have.
7066,CONCLUSION,
7067,CONCLUSION,Any one who has read _Tom Jones_ receives the impression that the long
7068,CONCLUSION,similes Fielding introduced in the Homeric manner were written half in
7069,CONCLUSION,"jest of Homer, his master."
7070,CONCLUSION,
7071,CONCLUSION,Yet the similes of the epic poets are poetry because they belong to the
7072,CONCLUSION,literature of ecstasy. If the trope arouses our emotions it is poetry
7073,CONCLUSION,not because it is an ornament but because it touches our unconscious
7074,CONCLUSION,souls. How many tropes do you find in the prose plays of Ibsen or the
7075,CONCLUSION,novels of Balzac? The ecstasy manages to get conveyed without their use.
7076,CONCLUSION,It was the writers of the Romantic School who made the figure of speech
7077,CONCLUSION,"so prominent. These writers who sought that poetry become natural, did"
7078,CONCLUSION,much to make it artificial. The reason that such great poets as Keats
7079,CONCLUSION,and Shelley are caviare to the public is that they are rich in tropes.
7080,CONCLUSION,The eighteenth century poets were said to be destitute of imagination
7081,CONCLUSION,chiefly because they did not make frequent use of the metaphor. The
7082,CONCLUSION,sport of critics was to make fun of the peculiar figures of earlier
7083,CONCLUSION,poets. We recall Johnson's dissecting (often with justice) of Cowley's
7084,CONCLUSION,poems. The eighteenth century was right in one respect; in their extreme
7085,CONCLUSION,"unimaginativeness, they also avoided distorted imagery. Many nineteenth"
7086,CONCLUSION,"century poets made it a rule never to call a thing by its proper name,"
7087,CONCLUSION,but by some epithet containing a metaphor. The practice is still
7088,CONCLUSION,"persisted in by many of our poets, and epithet-making is one of the"
7089,CONCLUSION,functions of many poets. Even prose writers like Carlyle were especially
7090,CONCLUSION,"noted for it, but his epithets were often truly poetry."
7091,CONCLUSION,
7092,CONCLUSION,I do not think that poetry then should be exclusively identified with
7093,CONCLUSION,"tropes. Take a much-praised, in my opinion over-praised sonnet of Keats,"
7094,CONCLUSION,_On Reading Chapman's Homer_. The whole idea of this poem is in the
7095,CONCLUSION,comparing his first discovery of Homer to the feelings of the man who
7096,CONCLUSION,"discovers a new planet, and to those of the discoverer of the Pacific"
7097,CONCLUSION,"Ocean. (He confused Cortes with Balboa, but that is no matter.) Keats"
7098,CONCLUSION,conveys to us his idea by two similes. But can this poem compare with
7099,CONCLUSION,"such other sonnets of his where he lays bare his inmost emotions, where"
7100,CONCLUSION,"the figures of speech are not the poems as here, but merely come in"
7101,CONCLUSION,"incidentally; where he has a profound idea, emerging as the result of a"
7102,CONCLUSION,great passion?
7103,CONCLUSION,
7104,CONCLUSION,A trope then is poetry only when arousing ecstasy; such poetry is not of
7105,CONCLUSION,the highest order.
7106,CONCLUSION,
7107,CONCLUSION,"For many centuries also, that alone was considered imaginative"
7108,CONCLUSION,literature which introduced the supernatural or the allegory. Every
7109,CONCLUSION,student is aware how much these two elements figure in medieval poetry.
7110,CONCLUSION,All recipes for writing poems in those days contained provisions about
7111,CONCLUSION,the use of the supernatural and allegory. It did not dawn on critics
7112,CONCLUSION,that these could be dispensed with in a great poetical work. Cervantes
7113,CONCLUSION,"laughed away the use of the supernatural, while the eighteenth century"
7114,CONCLUSION,realistic novel did away with the use of allegory as a means of telling
7115,CONCLUSION,a story. Nothing better than Poe's remarks has been said against the
7116,CONCLUSION,allegory as a form of literary expression. Yet the artificial
7117,CONCLUSION,supernatural agents of Ariosto and the bloodless types in the _Faerie
7118,CONCLUSION,Queene_ were held to be the truest creations of imagination. The vicious
7119,CONCLUSION,"practices of great geniuses, often due to the examples of their age,"
7120,CONCLUSION,"are instrumental in creating misunderstanding as to what poetry is, on"
7121,CONCLUSION,account of the inability of critics to praise them for their real
7122,CONCLUSION,"beauties. Often the passages that have been praised in Homer, Dante,"
7123,CONCLUSION,"Virgil, Milton, Spenser, Ariosto, are not the ones where the ecstasy was"
7124,CONCLUSION,"finest, but those where the ""imaginative"" powers of the poet were"
7125,CONCLUSION,"thought to be the best seen, in the supernatural and allegorical"
7126,CONCLUSION,portions. Yet who can doubt that the greatness of Milton is more
7127,CONCLUSION,apparent when he talks of his blindness than when he gives us the
7128,CONCLUSION,description of Lucifer with the many artificial figures? Who prefers the
7129,CONCLUSION,absurd descriptions of the monsters in Dante's _Inferno_ to the passages
7130,CONCLUSION,where he touches on his own sorrows?
7131,CONCLUSION,
7132,CONCLUSION,Another misapprehension about the nature of poetry lies in identifying
7133,CONCLUSION,poetry with beauty. Poetry does not necessarily deal with the conception
7134,CONCLUSION,"of beauty as understood by the public or by the aestheticians, though"
7135,CONCLUSION,the describing of beautiful objects and scenes is often one of its most
7136,CONCLUSION,important themes. Poetry is very little connected with the science of
7137,CONCLUSION,"aesthetics, for you may know all about the nature and laws of beauty,"
7138,CONCLUSION,"the effect of beauty upon the nature of man, the cause of his love for"
7139,CONCLUSION,"beauty, and yet you may not be able to make a great poem. Croce is as"
7140,CONCLUSION,much mistaken as the old aestheticians when he assumes one must study
7141,CONCLUSION,the science of aesthetics to appreciate poetry.
7142,CONCLUSION,
7143,CONCLUSION,"Pater dealt a death blow to the theory that aesthetic, or the science of"
7144,CONCLUSION,"abstract beauty, helps us to appreciate poetry. The critic who judges a"
7145,CONCLUSION,"poem need know nothing about abstract beauty, or theories of aesthetic"
7146,CONCLUSION,emotion. There is little of value to be given us by the aesthetic
7147,CONCLUSION,treatises to appreciate a play of Shakespeare or Ibsen or a novel of
7148,CONCLUSION,"Balzac or Dickens. Even poets like Goethe, Schiller and Lessing became"
7149,CONCLUSION,"absorbed in aesthetical problems, but their novels, poems and plays were"
7150,CONCLUSION,written by putting out of mind metaphysical disquisitions. How are you
7151,CONCLUSION,enabled to appreciate a poem by knowing Kant's erroneous theory that the
7152,CONCLUSION,appreciation of beauty is impersonal and disinterested?
7153,CONCLUSION,
7154,CONCLUSION,Pater in his _Renaissance_ took the position that poetry has a personal
7155,CONCLUSION,"message for us, an effect on us individually. We cannot learn this"
7156,CONCLUSION,effect by following metaphysical discourses on the relation of beauty to
7157,CONCLUSION,"truth or experience. In his _Appreciations_ in the essay on ""Style"""
7158,CONCLUSION,"Pater identifies beauty with expression, just as Croce did after him,"
7159,CONCLUSION,"and Lessing and Winckelmann before him. ""All beauty,"" wrote Pater, ""is"
7160,CONCLUSION,"in the long run only _fullness_ of truth, or what we call expression,"
7161,CONCLUSION,"the finer accommodation of speech to that vision within."" Here we have"
7162,CONCLUSION,"Croce's conception of beauty, the word defined as it is being understood"
7163,CONCLUSION,"to-day. It is in this sense only, the sense of the most adequate"
7164,CONCLUSION,"expression of emotion, that the word beauty is the same as poetry, or"
7165,CONCLUSION,literature of ecstasy.
7166,CONCLUSION,
7167,CONCLUSION,"Formerly treatises were written about curved lines, elegant diction,"
7168,CONCLUSION,"etc., on the theory that beauty was the subject of art. But a peasant's"
7169,CONCLUSION,"description in slang of his emotions, an author's description of a"
7170,CONCLUSION,"corpse that is rotting, or of a woman giving birth to a child, or of a"
7171,CONCLUSION,"man going mad, or of a hideous degenerate crime, are also beautiful, for"
7172,CONCLUSION,"since expression is beauty, the narration or description of the ugly is"
7173,CONCLUSION,a work of art. The word beauty in its popular sense no longer has
7174,CONCLUSION,aesthetic significance. Even when it was really believed that art dealt
7175,CONCLUSION,"with beautiful objects and deeds, the aesthetician had to admit that"
7176,CONCLUSION,there was nothing beautiful in tragedies. Nor does beauty mean elegant
7177,CONCLUSION,expression. Many stories and poems in slang and dialect belong to the
7178,CONCLUSION,"literature of beauty. The expression of emotions, the delineation of"
7179,CONCLUSION,"ideas, the drawing of characters is beauty, if effectively done. The"
7180,CONCLUSION,"reader need not have what the old aestheticians called ""taste""; he must"
7181,CONCLUSION,only respond sympathetically to the ecstasy of the author.
7182,CONCLUSION,
7183,CONCLUSION,"I have made no attempt to set confines to poetry, for no two people will"
7184,CONCLUSION,ever agree as to whether a literary performance has sufficient ecstasy
7185,CONCLUSION,or whether the ecstasy is of a high strain to entitle it to be called
7186,CONCLUSION,"poetry, but I believe all will agree that ecstasy is necessary."
7187,CONCLUSION,
7188,CONCLUSION,"I believe, however, that many authoritative works and essays on Poetry,"
7189,CONCLUSION,"from Aristotle to our own day, are obsolete. I shall mention only"
7190,CONCLUSION,Watts-Dunton's article on Poetry in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_ which
7191,CONCLUSION,has furnished modern critics with many of their ideas. The article is
7192,CONCLUSION,beyond question one of the most interesting produced in England in many
7193,CONCLUSION,years. Watts-Dunton has a true conception of poetry when he calls it the
7194,CONCLUSION,product of inspiration or concrete and artistic expression of the human
7195,CONCLUSION,"mind in emotional language. He believes, however, versification is"
7196,CONCLUSION,necessary to all poetry. He also makes too much of the divisions of
7197,CONCLUSION,"poetry into the various orders, like epic, lyric, drama, an artificial"
7198,CONCLUSION,division adopted by all critics from Aristotle. Watts-Dunton's divisions
7199,CONCLUSION,of poets into those with an absolute or personal vision and those with a
7200,CONCLUSION,"relative vision, is arbitrary and confused. All poets are personal, and"
7201,CONCLUSION,"even when they depict other people's emotions objectively, the product"
7202,CONCLUSION,is personal because touched with the creator's personality. He is also
7203,CONCLUSION,too much under the influence of Hegel's _Aesthetics_.
7204,CONCLUSION,
7205,CONCLUSION,Watts-Dunton could not understand the value of impassioned prose or its
7206,CONCLUSION,right to be called poetry. He once said to William Michael Rossetti
7207,CONCLUSION,that the latter's reputation as a critic would soon vanish because of
7208,CONCLUSION,"his admiration for Whitman, whom he himself detested. He is blamed with"
7209,CONCLUSION,"having done much to quench the poetic fire of Swinburne's muse, for"
7210,CONCLUSION,whose changed attitude towards Whitman he also was responsible. He had
7211,CONCLUSION,no sympathy with the poetry that had a social message and he did not
7212,CONCLUSION,understand its effect as a catharsis. Watts-Dunton cannot remain our
7213,CONCLUSION,leading authority on poetry. His essay belongs to the extinct class of
7214,CONCLUSION,"_Ars Poetica_, with Boileau and Opitz."
7215,CONCLUSION,
7216,CONCLUSION,"Ecstasy is then the substance of poetry, and there are all kinds of"
7217,CONCLUSION,"ecstasy, from a very exalted to a primitive order. It includes the"
7218,CONCLUSION,"scientist's or philosopher's passion for knowledge, the idealist's"
7219,CONCLUSION,"devotion to a cause. It comprehends the warrior's madness for battle,"
7220,CONCLUSION,"the patriot's ardor to die for his country, and man's submission to his"
7221,CONCLUSION,God. Ecstasy holds in its sway the man who is moved by reading a great
7222,CONCLUSION,work of art. It sweeps every one who is in the throes of ambition. Those
7223,CONCLUSION,"who enjoy nature, athletics, and games are in the throes of ecstasy."
7224,CONCLUSION,"Those who are bemoaning the death of one they love, or rejoicing in the"
7225,CONCLUSION,"emergence of dear ones from illness or danger, those who take pride in"
7226,CONCLUSION,"watching their children grow up, those who exult in the pleasure of"
7227,CONCLUSION,"friendship, are all in ecstasy."
7228,CONCLUSION,
7229,CONCLUSION,"Every one who builds dreams and sees visions of better things, every one"
7230,CONCLUSION,"who fulminates against ugliness and wrong, is possessed by ecstasy. Are"
7231,CONCLUSION,"you in a state of rapture because your love is returned, or in one of"
7232,CONCLUSION,"despair, because it is denied?--you are in ecstasy. Are you brooding"
7233,CONCLUSION,"over a sense of wrong or injustice, are you moved by the spectacle of"
7234,CONCLUSION,"grief?--you are in ecstasy. Ecstasy is intoxication, in a good and in a"
7235,CONCLUSION,bad sense. The origin of the drinking-song was due to the pleasant
7236,CONCLUSION,emotions and dreams which the indulgence in alcohol aroused.
7237,CONCLUSION,
7238,CONCLUSION,"The mystic who thinks he is in personal communion with God, the lunatic"
7239,CONCLUSION,"who thinks demons are prodding him, the spiritualist who imagines he"
7240,CONCLUSION,"talks to his dead son, the child who is in communication with animals"
7241,CONCLUSION,"and supernatural creatures, are all victims of some form of ecstasy."
7242,CONCLUSION,
7243,CONCLUSION,It is the great poet who knows which is a high order of ecstasy to
7244,CONCLUSION,"choose, what attitude to take towards it and in what words and form to"
7245,CONCLUSION,convey it.
7246,CONCLUSION,
7247,CONCLUSION,"The people do like poetry and read it, but are unaware of the fact. For"
7248,CONCLUSION,the great bulk of the poetry read by the people is the prose fiction
7249,CONCLUSION,that they find exciting and stimulating. This fiction is usually of a
7250,CONCLUSION,very low order. Nevertheless good poetry is to be found in the simple
7251,CONCLUSION,"and emotional prose of the world, in the dramatic situations in novels,"
7252,CONCLUSION,in the best passages of short stories. Prose poetry is the most
7253,CONCLUSION,"democratic and natural poetry, at least in form, and you can rely on the"
7254,CONCLUSION,public to appreciate some of it.
7255,CONCLUSION,
7256,CONCLUSION,The poetry in Dickens is democratic poetry. The drawing of such
7257,CONCLUSION,"characters as the elder Pegotty and Joe Gargery, wherein he shows the"
7258,CONCLUSION,"noble virtues residing in common people, is poetry that the public can"
7259,CONCLUSION,appreciate.
7260,CONCLUSION,
7261,CONCLUSION,"Poetry cannot, however, always be democratic, for when it deals with"
7262,CONCLUSION,"ideas beyond the people, such as you find in Nietzsche and Ibsen, it"
7263,CONCLUSION,does not succeed in evoking the intended response and sympathy from the
7264,CONCLUSION,"public, which rejects such ideas."
7265,CONCLUSION,
7266,CONCLUSION,So when we hear people say that they do not care for poetry we see that
7267,CONCLUSION,they mean they have an aversion to verse in metre or rhyme or rhythm.
7268,CONCLUSION,But they will weep as they read of the death of Little Nell and be
7269,CONCLUSION,"moved by the sorrows of Anna Karenina, and be stirred by the tragedy of"
7270,CONCLUSION,_Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. Like the gentleman in Molière's play who
7271,CONCLUSION,"spoke prose all his life without knowing it, these readers are fond of"
7272,CONCLUSION,poetry without being aware of the fact. Every lover of good literature
7273,CONCLUSION,appreciates poetry though he reads no verse. He is touched by the
7274,CONCLUSION,ecstasy which tinctures all emotional or beautiful prose literature.
7275,CONCLUSION,Here the poetic is divested of metaphors and rhythm and trappings and
7276,CONCLUSION,verbal tricks; here it is not hidden by obscurity or spoiled by
7277,CONCLUSION,affectation.
7278,CONCLUSION,
7279,CONCLUSION,You love poetry if you are touched by the lines in Burke's _Letter to a
7280,CONCLUSION,"Noble Lord_, where the great orator, desolate because of the loss of his"
7281,CONCLUSION,"son and embittered by criticism for accepting a pension, bares the state"
7282,CONCLUSION,of his soul.
7283,CONCLUSION,
7284,CONCLUSION,"The storm has gone over me, and I lie like one of those old"
7285,CONCLUSION,oaks which the late hurricane has scattered upon me. I am
7286,CONCLUSION,"stripped of all my honors, I am torn up by the roots, and lie"
7287,CONCLUSION,prostrate on the earth. . . . I am alone. I have none to meet
7288,CONCLUSION,"my enemies in the gate. Indeed, my Lord, I greatly deceive"
7289,CONCLUSION,myself if in this hard season I would give a peck of refuse
7290,CONCLUSION,wheat for all that is called fame and honor in the world. . . .
7291,CONCLUSION,I live in an inverted order. They who ought to have succeeded
7292,CONCLUSION,me are gone before me. They who should have been to me as
7293,CONCLUSION,posterity are in the place of ancestors.
7294,CONCLUSION,
7295,CONCLUSION,You are hearing Heine the poet when he describes in his _Confessions_
7296,CONCLUSION,"his feelings as he lay on his mattress grave, no less than when you"
7297,CONCLUSION,peruse his love woes in verse.
7298,CONCLUSION,
7299,CONCLUSION,What does it avail me that at banquets my health is pledged in
7300,CONCLUSION,"the choicest wines and drunk from golden goblets, when I,"
7301,CONCLUSION,"myself, severed from all that makes life pleasant may only"
7302,CONCLUSION,wet my lips with an insipid emotion? What does it avail me
7303,CONCLUSION,that enthusiastic youths and maidens crown my marble bust with
7304,CONCLUSION,"laurel wreaths, if meanwhile the shriveled fingers of an aged"
7305,CONCLUSION,nurse press a blister of Spanish flies behind the ears of my
7306,CONCLUSION,actual body. What does it avail me that all the roses of
7307,CONCLUSION,Shiraz so tenderly glow and bloom for me? Alas! Shiraz is two
7308,CONCLUSION,"thousand miles away from the Rue d'Amsterdam, where, in the"
7309,CONCLUSION,"dreary solitude of my sick-room, I have nothing to smell,"
7310,CONCLUSION,unless it be the perfume of warmed napkins.
7311,CONCLUSION,
7312,CONCLUSION,When you read Hardy's _Return of the Native_ and reach the part where
7313,CONCLUSION,Yeobright reproaches his wife Eustacia for causing the death of his
7314,CONCLUSION,"mother by closing the door on her so as not to be detected with a lover,"
7315,CONCLUSION,you are in the midst of poetry.
7316,CONCLUSION,
7317,CONCLUSION,Call her to mind--think of her--what goodness there was in
7318,CONCLUSION,her: it showed in every line of her face! . . . O! couldn't
7319,CONCLUSION,"you see what was best for you, but you must bring a curse upon"
7320,CONCLUSION,"me, and agony and death upon her, by doing that cruel deed!"
7321,CONCLUSION,". . . Eustacia, didn't any tender thought of your own mother"
7322,CONCLUSION,lead you to think of being gentle to mine at such a time of
7323,CONCLUSION,weariness? Did not one grain of pity _enter_ your heart as she
7324,CONCLUSION,turned away?
7325,CONCLUSION,
7326,CONCLUSION,If you are awakened by the beauty and profundity of the following
7327,CONCLUSION,"passage from Lafcadio Hearn's ""Of Moon-Desire,"" from the volume _Exotics"
7328,CONCLUSION,"and Retrospectives_, you delight in poetry."
7329,CONCLUSION,
7330,CONCLUSION,And meantime those old savage sympathies with savage nature
7331,CONCLUSION,that spring from the deepest sources of our being . . . would
7332,CONCLUSION,seem destined to sublime at last into forms of cosmical
7333,CONCLUSION,emotion expanding and responding to infinitude.
7334,CONCLUSION,
7335,CONCLUSION,Have you never thought about those immemorial feelings? Have
7336,CONCLUSION,"you never, when looking at some great burning, found yourself"
7337,CONCLUSION,exulting without remorse in the triumph and glory of
7338,CONCLUSION,"fire?--never unconsciously coveted the crumbling, splitting,"
7339,CONCLUSION,"iron-wrenching, granite-cracking force of its imponderable"
7340,CONCLUSION,touch?--never delighted in the furious and terrible splendor
7341,CONCLUSION,"of its phantasmagories,--the ravening and bickering of its"
7342,CONCLUSION,"dragons,--the monstrosity of its archings,--the ghostly"
7343,CONCLUSION,"soaring and flapping of its spires? Have you never, with a"
7344,CONCLUSION,"hill-wind pealing in your ears, longed to ride that wind like"
7345,CONCLUSION,"a ghost,--to scream around the peaks with it,--to sweep the"
7346,CONCLUSION,"face of the world with it? Or, watching the lifting, the"
7347,CONCLUSION,"gathering, the muttering rush and thunder-burst of breakers,"
7348,CONCLUSION,"have you felt no impulse kindered to the giant motion,--no"
7349,CONCLUSION,"longing to leap with that wild tossing, and to join in that"
7350,CONCLUSION,mighty shout?
7351,CONCLUSION,
7352,CONCLUSION,I should like to go on quoting passages from other books to show the
7353,CONCLUSION,reader that if he likes them he is emphatically a lover of poetry. I
7354,CONCLUSION,might have given one of the great prose poems in Nietzsche's _Thus Spake
7355,CONCLUSION,Zarathustra_ or a grand descriptive passage from Flaubert's novel
7356,CONCLUSION,"_Salammbo_. I might have presented for the edification of the ""hater"" of"
7357,CONCLUSION,poetry the renowned description of the Mona Lisa by Pater in his essay
7358,CONCLUSION,on Leonardo da Vinci in _The Renaissance_. I could have added Carlyle's
7359,CONCLUSION,"reflections of Teufelsdroch in his tower, from _Sartor Resartus_,"
7360,CONCLUSION,"Heine's portrayal of Paginini at the violin in _The Florentine Nights_,"
7361,CONCLUSION,George Brandes's apostrophe to Hamlet as a symbol of ourselves in his
7362,CONCLUSION,"book on _Shakespeare_, Dickens' description of the tower in _Chimes_, or"
7363,CONCLUSION,Balzac's eulogy on the scientist as a poet in the _Wild Ass's Skin_.
7364,CONCLUSION,
7365,CONCLUSION,"That is poetry whether in verse or prose, where any profound idea is"
7366,CONCLUSION,ecstatically or passionately stated. That is poetry where man gives
7367,CONCLUSION,"utterance to any sorrow or desolation, or where he shouts out his"
7368,CONCLUSION,gladness because he finds life good and nature beautiful; when he talks
7369,CONCLUSION,of the pains or thrills of love; when he shows compassion for the
7370,CONCLUSION,miseries of his fellow-men. You find poetry wherever man is depicted in
7371,CONCLUSION,a spirit of self-sacrifice for an idea or a person he loves; or where he
7372,CONCLUSION,is shown pursuing an ideal or ambition. Heroism is poetry; philanthropy
7373,CONCLUSION,is poetry; self-development is poetry. Pictures of striking scenes;
7374,CONCLUSION,portrayals of interesting events; conflicts between duties; delineations
7375,CONCLUSION,"of tragic situations; tolerance for human frailties; anger at injustice,"
7376,CONCLUSION,"admonition for follies, chidings or outbursts against stupidity; cries"
7377,CONCLUSION,of helplessness; all of these in artistic form become poems. Accounts of
7378,CONCLUSION,"cruelty, barbarism, madness, horror, wicked deeds or abnormal or"
7379,CONCLUSION,"supernormal conduct, if well described become poetical, for poetry need"
7380,CONCLUSION,"not point a conventional moral. Hence villainy, immorality, crime, may"
7381,CONCLUSION,be so artistically pictured that our emotions are worked upon and though
7382,CONCLUSION,our moral sense is shocked we are held spellbound in witnessing these
7383,CONCLUSION,malign forces in nature.
7384,CONCLUSION,
7385,CONCLUSION,"I plead then that ecstasy, and not rhythm, should characterize much of"
7386,CONCLUSION,our literature; and I seek to show that poetry is not a department of
7387,CONCLUSION,literature but a spirit that permeates the best writing even in prose.
7388,CONCLUSION,"Our entire attitude in estimating what is poetry will be changed, for"
7389,CONCLUSION,the world's emotional prose literature will be taken into its domain.
7390,CONCLUSION,And the importance of rhythm in making verse will be a thing of the past
7391,CONCLUSION,and genuine emotion will receive its right name.
7392,CONCLUSION,
7393,CONCLUSION,I also hope that a higher valuation will be given to literature which
7394,CONCLUSION,shows an interest in the working classes and seeks social justice. I do
7395,CONCLUSION,"not, however, assert that the literature of pure rational propaganda"
7396,CONCLUSION,"would become poetry, or that the writings of men who attach themselves"
7397,CONCLUSION,to certain political or economical theories would be great by virtue of
7398,CONCLUSION,the adherence to a particular theory. But there is a tendency to decry a
7399,CONCLUSION,writer when he shows an interest in social problems and tells the world
7400,CONCLUSION,that something is rotten in Denmark.
7401,CONCLUSION,
7402,CONCLUSION,There are occasionally great literary products that are to be found
7403,CONCLUSION,often in radical and obscure papers that belong to the literature of the
7404,CONCLUSION,ecstasy of social justice. These would have never been accepted by the
7405,CONCLUSION,"academic or capitalistic bourgeois press, any more than would some of"
7406,CONCLUSION,the older prophecies have been accepted had they been submitted as
7407,CONCLUSION,unrequested contributions to our magazine editors. Many of those
7408,CONCLUSION,"compositions depend for literary value on universal feeling, and make no"
7409,CONCLUSION,"appeal to party feeling or economical theory, and they can be"
7410,CONCLUSION,appreciated by people who seek poetry.
7411,CONCLUSION,
7412,CONCLUSION,The reader will observe then that not all species of ecstasy belong to
7413,CONCLUSION,the high order of literature. But the skill of the artist may elevate
7414,CONCLUSION,"the lower order of ecstasy to that of a higher plane, and the"
7415,CONCLUSION,amateurishness of the author may deflect what might be poetry of a
7416,CONCLUSION,"higher degree to that of a commonplace order. Stories of adventure,"
7417,CONCLUSION,"abounding in false sentiment, misleading examples and unreal situations,"
7418,CONCLUSION,are hardly poetry or good literature of ecstasy. But Stevenson
7419,CONCLUSION,transmutes such a tale into excellent poetry in _Treasure Island_. Those
7420,CONCLUSION,"who have read the pathological outbursts of religio-maniacs, rife in"
7421,CONCLUSION,"outworn dogma, and seething with morbid emotions, will not maintain that"
7422,CONCLUSION,"such productions are poetry of a high order, though the ecstatic element"
7423,CONCLUSION,is present in marked degree. Yet a St. Augustine occasionally makes good
7424,CONCLUSION,poetry out of such material.
7425,CONCLUSION,
7426,CONCLUSION,"In general, that is not great poetry or literature of ecstasy which"
7427,CONCLUSION,appeals to the rude primitive emotions. When the purpose of a literary
7428,CONCLUSION,"work is to wean us from finer feelings, to make us sympathize with"
7429,CONCLUSION,"cruelty, to paralyze the sympathetic emotions within us, and to kill all"
7430,CONCLUSION,"feelings rooted in love, pity, service, justice and kindness, it is not"
7431,CONCLUSION,of a great order of poetry. Those works in whole or part that fan the
7432,CONCLUSION,"martial spirit within us, and take hold of us as with an hypnotic sway"
7433,CONCLUSION,"of the hand, and make us seek to murder our fellow men, and to arouse"
7434,CONCLUSION,"the lust for blood in us, cannot be great works. No literature that is"
7435,CONCLUSION,"heartless or brutal, or confuses an appeal to the murderous instincts"
7436,CONCLUSION,"with real love of country, or love of liberty, with self-sacrifice for"
7437,CONCLUSION,"justice or loved ones, can be valuable to us either practically or"
7438,CONCLUSION,"aesthetically. No literature that reeks with blood, and fosters"
7439,CONCLUSION,"unreasonable revenge, or depicts sympathetically shameful victories, or"
7440,CONCLUSION,crowns with the garland of a hero the mere warrior who is a warrior for
7441,CONCLUSION,"the pure delight of killing, is really of the higher type of literature"
7442,CONCLUSION,of ecstasy. It is this martial phase that makes most of the early
7443,CONCLUSION,literature of all nations valuable only in parts; in those parts where
7444,CONCLUSION,"the more beautiful and human phases of life are dealt with, and where"
7445,CONCLUSION,the more genial emotions are crystallized. So many theories of poetry
7446,CONCLUSION,"are futile, because they are based on studies primarily of the epic"
7447,CONCLUSION,"poems of the nations, and it is these epic poems that mingle the most"
7448,CONCLUSION,impoverished and base poetry with that of a fine quality.
7449,CONCLUSION,
7450,CONCLUSION,Nor is that great poetry or literature of ecstasy of a high order which
7451,CONCLUSION,is purely tribal or clannish in feeling; nor when chauvinistic and full
7452,CONCLUSION,of hatred for all other peoples. This does not mean that poetry must not
7453,CONCLUSION,"smack of the soil, and that it cannot preserve a sane patriotic and"
7454,CONCLUSION,"national feeling, and worship a culture inherent in a people. But when"
7455,CONCLUSION,the ecstasy descends to the kind which kills individualism under the
7456,CONCLUSION,"pretense of encouraging it, when it is hostile to the stranger and the"
7457,CONCLUSION,"original thinker, when it fosters the primitive anti-social instincts"
7458,CONCLUSION,"as regards all outside of a clan, it becomes inhuman and pernicious."
7459,CONCLUSION,
7460,CONCLUSION,Nor is that great poetry or literature of ecstasy of a high order which
7461,CONCLUSION,"in its mystic quality eludes all compromises with reason, and borders on"
7462,CONCLUSION,absurdity or is pathological. When poetry seeks salvation in apparent
7463,CONCLUSION,"madness, and attaches itself to faith in the impossible, and sees"
7464,CONCLUSION,"distorted visions, and creates a maniac's world of unquestionably"
7465,CONCLUSION,"inverted order of hell-fire and brimstone, and makes outrageous and"
7466,CONCLUSION,unjust demands on human nature it is of a low order. Nor is an
7467,CONCLUSION,unwarranted asceticism in poetry calculated to raise its tone.
7468,CONCLUSION,
7469,CONCLUSION,"It is vain to enumerate the various ecstasies of a low order, that of"
7470,CONCLUSION,"the literature which upholds different forms of wrong, as well as that"
7471,CONCLUSION,"which is too much attached to the commonplace, nor is it necessary to"
7472,CONCLUSION,show that that poetry is not of a high order whose author goes into
7473,CONCLUSION,"ecstasies about nuances, indulges in inappropriate imagery, piles up"
7474,CONCLUSION,"trite ideas in flowery diction, or gives continual iteration to the"
7475,CONCLUSION,least important of commonplace emotions.
7476,CONCLUSION,
7477,CONCLUSION,What then is literature of a high order? What is this great form of art
7478,CONCLUSION,that takes us out of ourselves because it has in it so much of
7479,CONCLUSION,ourselves? What is this magical arrangement of words enshrining what
7480,CONCLUSION,"ideas and emotions that gives us a zest for life, that makes us drunk"
7481,CONCLUSION,"with aesthetic pleasure? It includes many species, all, as Milton would"
7482,CONCLUSION,"say, in a ""strain of a higher mood."" One of its greatest manifestations"
7483,CONCLUSION,is that in which the ecstasy for social justice and a high form of
7484,CONCLUSION,"idealism control the poet. We become carried away with his frenzy, for"
7485,CONCLUSION,it evokes the highest emotions in us; an undeviating and never swerving
7486,CONCLUSION,enthusiasm for spreading right and happiness is an elevated form of
7487,CONCLUSION,"ecstasy. The grief of the oppressed and the poor goes to our own hearts,"
7488,CONCLUSION,and the calamities of the woe-begone become our own. We submerge our
7489,CONCLUSION,"personality in that of the human race, and the griefs of strangers lure"
7490,CONCLUSION,us to cry out for them.
7491,CONCLUSION,
7492,CONCLUSION,But it should be remembered that literature never thus becomes a weapon
7493,CONCLUSION,for reform or a piece of didacticism or propaganda. The emotion is the
7494,CONCLUSION,thing. The practical work of relief of suffering is the function of the
7495,CONCLUSION,reformer and not the poet. It is the poet's duty only to make a certain
7496,CONCLUSION,form of ecstasy contagious. Practical results will follow as a matter of
7497,CONCLUSION,course.
7498,CONCLUSION,
7499,CONCLUSION,And then there is the ecstasy that revolves around a profound
7500,CONCLUSION,"philosophic insight, when the poet rids himself of prejudiced and barren"
7501,CONCLUSION,thinking and looks at the universe with awe and goes into rhapsodies
7502,CONCLUSION,about its workings. And it takes a high order of intellect to sympathize
7503,CONCLUSION,"with the literature of ecstasy of this kind, that pierces into the soul"
7504,CONCLUSION,"of the universe. The advanced ideas of the greatest poets are, however,"
7505,CONCLUSION,"often such as only a few people have intellect enough to perceive, or"
7506,CONCLUSION,are such as can be grasped only when man throws aside all his
7507,CONCLUSION,"prejudices. And here the great philosopher, mathematician and scientist"
7508,CONCLUSION,"come to the aid of the poet, who emotionalizes their greatest"
7509,CONCLUSION,discoveries. For reason must go hand in hand with ecstasy.
7510,CONCLUSION,
7511,CONCLUSION,There is the ecstasy where men are shown in the helpless grasp of great
7512,CONCLUSION,"passions, and are in despair because of events beyond their control."
7513,CONCLUSION,"Such passions include grief of all kinds, whether brought about by death"
7514,CONCLUSION,or wrong or one's own folly. The depicting of great passion belongs to
7515,CONCLUSION,the grand order of the literature of ecstasy even when the poet makes no
7516,CONCLUSION,attempt to moralize from or sympathize with it. Crime and wickedness
7517,CONCLUSION,"may be masterfully described with no ethical intent, for we are"
7518,CONCLUSION,"interested in the grand spectacle of a man whom the Gods have made mad,"
7519,CONCLUSION,for madness is potential in all of us.
7520,CONCLUSION,
7521,CONCLUSION,"There is the ecstasy of the lover in his rapture for his mistress, and"
7522,CONCLUSION,in his transformed nature. We are moved by the delicacy of his
7523,CONCLUSION,"sentiment, his chivalry, his sacrifice, we are overcome by his sorrows"
7524,CONCLUSION,and his misfortunes. There is the ecstasy of the love of nature where
7525,CONCLUSION,the majesty of this universe is set out in its glory. There is the
7526,CONCLUSION,"ecstasy of the lover of beauty for its own sake, and of the artist in"
7527,CONCLUSION,"the pursuit of his work, and of the reader and of him who listens to"
7528,CONCLUSION,"music, of him who sees artistic pictures. There is the ecstasy of the"
7529,CONCLUSION,"scientist in his pursuit of truth, and of the inventor in transforming"
7530,CONCLUSION,the face of the globe.
7531,CONCLUSION,
7532,CONCLUSION,"We cry out for ecstasy; it is the substance of our lives; even though,"
7533,CONCLUSION,"often in our pursuit of pleasant ecstasy, we are launched into tragedy."
7534,CONCLUSION,We are hungry for a happy life of the emotions. It is this which makes
7535,CONCLUSION,"lovers and friends and parents of us. It is this which makes us poets,"
7536,CONCLUSION,and it is the poet in ourselves that we always hunt out.
7537,CONCLUSION,
7538,CONCLUSION,I hope our study has helped us to distinguish the higher from the lower
7539,CONCLUSION,"forms of ecstasy, to find poetry in prose, and to differentiate poetry"
7540,CONCLUSION,"from verse, wherein there is no ecstasy but various conventions, like"
7541,CONCLUSION,"inversion, poetic diction, rhyme, metre, figures of speech,"
7542,CONCLUSION,"parallelisms, technique, and all forms of rhythm and repeats. That much"
7543,CONCLUSION,of the best of the world's poetry has made abundant use of these
7544,CONCLUSION,mechanisms has led the critics to confuse poetry with its conventions.
7545,CONCLUSION,"But the ecstasy was forgotten, and the emotional and intellectual value"
7546,CONCLUSION,of the poem was overlooked. It was thought because the masters
7547,CONCLUSION,subscribed slavishly to the conventions that they became poets because
7548,CONCLUSION,"of them, whereas they were poets first and last because of the ecstasy,"
7549,CONCLUSION,sometimes with the aid of the conventions and sometimes despite them.
7550,CONCLUSION,"That these mechanisms will always be used in some degree is certain, but"
7551,CONCLUSION,"the most natural poetry will be that which uses them moderately,"
7552,CONCLUSION,irregularly and only when the emotions and the ideas naturally clothe
7553,CONCLUSION,themselves in them.
7554,CONCLUSION,
7555,CONCLUSION,"Poetry and prose then are not contradictory, but prose becomes poetry"
7556,CONCLUSION,when the element of ecstasy is present. We use the word prosaic in a
7557,CONCLUSION,"sense, it is true, which means destitute of imagination or emotion; we"
7558,CONCLUSION,even call verse of this kind prosaic. But a work in prose may be
7559,CONCLUSION,"poetical, and one in verse be prosaic, and science, philosophy and"
7560,CONCLUSION,"morality become poetry, though in the form of prose, when bathed in the"
7561,CONCLUSION,spirit of ecstasy. And the highest form of poetry is that wherein the
7562,CONCLUSION,ecstasy springs from our nature's most human and most admirable side.
7563,CONCLUSION,
7564,CONCLUSION,After having learned that poetry is more natural without metre or a
7565,CONCLUSION,"pattern, that it may be in prose with or without rhythm, that it may"
7566,CONCLUSION,"have a social message, that it is the product of the unconscious, that"
7567,CONCLUSION,it is related to dreams in being an imaginary fulfilled wish of the
7568,CONCLUSION,"poet, that it acts as a relief to the writer and the reader, that it is"
7569,CONCLUSION,"always personal and lyric, that it is synonymous with expression in the"
7570,CONCLUSION,"poet's mind, that its chief characteristic is passion, imagination or"
7571,CONCLUSION,"ecstasy, that its qualities are often enhanced rather than destroyed by"
7572,CONCLUSION,"the presence of intellect or morality, that it is an emotional spirit"
7573,CONCLUSION,"holding literature in suffusion instead of being a branch of literature,"
7574,CONCLUSION,we shall find that most of the old definitions of poetry exclude a great
7575,CONCLUSION,"deal of the world's best poetry, and include much that is not poetry."
