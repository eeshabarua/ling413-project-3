37,ALL THE WAY,And noble dreams that had to end at last:--
38,ALL THE WAY,Ah! these indeed; and from youth's sacristy
39,ALL THE WAY,"Full many a holy relic hath he torn,"
40,ALL THE WAY,"Vessels of mystic faith God filled for me,"
41,ALL THE WAY,Holding them up to Him in life's young morn.
42,ALL THE WAY,
43,ALL THE WAY,"All these are mine no more--Time hath them all,"
44,ALL THE WAY,Time and his adamantine gaoler Death:
45,ALL THE WAY,"Despoilure vast--yet seemeth it but small,"
46,ALL THE WAY,"When unto thee I turn, thy bloom and breath"

151,THE LONELY DANCER,
152,THE LONELY DANCER,"I had no heart to join the dance,"
153,THE LONELY DANCER,I danced it all so long ago--
154,THE LONELY DANCER,"Ah! light-winged music out of France,"
155,THE LONELY DANCER,"Let other feet glide to and fro,"
156,THE LONELY DANCER,Weaving new patterns of romance
157,THE LONELY DANCER,For bosoms of new-fallen snow.
158,THE LONELY DANCER,
159,THE LONELY DANCER,But leave me thus where I may hear
160,THE LONELY DANCER,"The leafy rustle of the waltz,"
161,THE LONELY DANCER,"The shell-like murmur in my ear,"
162,THE LONELY DANCER,The silken whisper fairy-false
163,THE LONELY DANCER,"Of unseen rainbows circling near,"
164,THE LONELY DANCER,And the glad shuddering of the walls.
165,THE LONELY DANCER,
166,THE LONELY DANCER,"Another dance the dancers spin,"
167,THE LONELY DANCER,"A shadow-dance of mystic pain,"
168,THE LONELY DANCER,And other partners enter in
169,THE LONELY DANCER,And dance within my lonely brain--
170,THE LONELY DANCER,"The swaying woodland shod in green,"
171,THE LONELY DANCER,The ghostly dancers of the rain;
172,THE LONELY DANCER,
173,THE LONELY DANCER,"The lonely dancers of the sea,"
174,THE LONELY DANCER,"Foam-footed on the sandy bar,"
175,THE LONELY DANCER,"The wizard dance of wind and tree,"
176,THE LONELY DANCER,The eddying dance of stream and star;
177,THE LONELY DANCER,"Yea, all these dancers tread for me"
178,THE LONELY DANCER,A measure mournful and bizarre:
179,THE LONELY DANCER,
180,THE LONELY DANCER,"An echo-dance where ear is eye,"
181,THE LONELY DANCER,"And sound evokes the shapes of things,"
182,THE LONELY DANCER,Where out of silence and a sigh
183,THE LONELY DANCER,"The sad world like a picture springs,"
184,THE LONELY DANCER,"As, when some secret bird sweeps by,"
185,THE LONELY DANCER,We see it in the sound of wings.
186,THE LONELY DANCER,
187,THE LONELY DANCER,"Those human feet upon the floor,"
188,THE LONELY DANCER,"That eager pulse of rhythmic breath,--"
189,THE LONELY DANCER,How sadly to an unknown shore
190,THE LONELY DANCER,Each silver footfall hurryeth;
191,THE LONELY DANCER,"A dance of autumn leaves, no more,"
192,THE LONELY DANCER,On the fantastic wind of death.
193,THE LONELY DANCER,
194,THE LONELY DANCER,"Fire clasped to elemental fire,"
195,THE LONELY DANCER,'Tis thus the solar atom whirls;
196,THE LONELY DANCER,"The butterfly in aery gyre,"
197,THE LONELY DANCER,"On autumn mornings, swarms and swirls,"
198,THE LONELY DANCER,"In dance of delicate desire,"
199,THE LONELY DANCER,No other than these boys and girls.
200,THE LONELY DANCER,
201,THE LONELY DANCER,"The same strange music everywhere,"
202,THE LONELY DANCER,"The woven paces just the same,"
203,THE LONELY DANCER,Dancing from out the viewless air
204,THE LONELY DANCER,Into the void from whence they came;
205,THE LONELY DANCER,Ah! but they make a gallant flare
206,THE LONELY DANCER,"Against the dark, each little flame!"
207,THE LONELY DANCER,
208,THE LONELY DANCER,And what if all the meaning lies
209,THE LONELY DANCER,"Just in the music, not in those"
210,THE LONELY DANCER,"Who dance thus with transfigured eyes,"
211,THE LONELY DANCER,Holding in vain each other close;
212,THE LONELY DANCER,"Only the music never dies,"
213,THE LONELY DANCER,"The dance goes on,--the dancer goes."
214,THE LONELY DANCER,
215,THE LONELY DANCER,"A woman dancing, or a world"
216,THE LONELY DANCER,"Poised on one crystal foot afar,"
217,THE LONELY DANCER,"In shining gulfs of silence whirled,"
218,THE LONELY DANCER,Like notes of the strange music are;
219,THE LONELY DANCER,"Small shape against another curled,"
220,THE LONELY DANCER,Or dancing dust that makes a star.
221,THE LONELY DANCER,
222,THE LONELY DANCER,To him who plays the violin
223,THE LONELY DANCER,"All one it is who joins the reel,"
224,THE LONELY DANCER,"Drops from the dance, or enters in;"
225,THE LONELY DANCER,So that the never-ending wheel
226,THE LONELY DANCER,"Cease not its mystic course to spin,"
227,THE LONELY DANCER,"For weal or woe, for woe or weal."

237,FLOS AEVORUM,Wrought with such planetary care;
238,FLOS AEVORUM,How patient the eternal power
239,FLOS AEVORUM,That wove the marvel of your hair.
240,FLOS AEVORUM,
241,FLOS AEVORUM,How long the sunlight and the sea
242,FLOS AEVORUM,Wove and re-wove this rippling gold
243,FLOS AEVORUM,To rhythms of eternity;
244,FLOS AEVORUM,"And many a flashing thing grew old,"
245,FLOS AEVORUM,Waiting this miracle to be;
246,FLOS AEVORUM,"And painted marvels manifold,"
247,FLOS AEVORUM,
248,FLOS AEVORUM,"Still with his work unsatisfied,"
249,FLOS AEVORUM,"Eager each new effect to try,"
250,FLOS AEVORUM,"The solemn artist cast aside,"
251,FLOS AEVORUM,"Rainbow and shell and butterfly,"
252,FLOS AEVORUM,As some stern blacksmith scatters wide
253,FLOS AEVORUM,The sparks that from his anvil fly.
254,FLOS AEVORUM,
255,FLOS AEVORUM,"How many shells, whorl within whorl,"
256,FLOS AEVORUM,Litter the marges of the sphere
257,FLOS AEVORUM,"With wrack of unregarded pearl,"
258,FLOS AEVORUM,To shape that little thing your ear:
259,FLOS AEVORUM,"Creation, just to make one girl,"
260,FLOS AEVORUM,Hath travailed with exceeding fear.
261,FLOS AEVORUM,
262,FLOS AEVORUM,The moonlight of forgotten seas
263,FLOS AEVORUM,"Dwells in your eyes, and on your tongue"
264,FLOS AEVORUM,"The honey of a million bees,"
265,FLOS AEVORUM,And all the sorrows of all song:
266,FLOS AEVORUM,"You are the ending of all these,"
267,FLOS AEVORUM,The world grew old to make you young.
268,FLOS AEVORUM,
269,FLOS AEVORUM,All time hath traveled to this rose;
270,FLOS AEVORUM,To the strange making of this face
271,FLOS AEVORUM,Came agonies of fires and snows;
272,FLOS AEVORUM,"And Death and April, nights and days"
273,FLOS AEVORUM,"Unnumbered, unimagined throes,"
274,FLOS AEVORUM,Find in this flower their meeting place.
275,FLOS AEVORUM,
276,FLOS AEVORUM,"Strange artist, to my aching thought"
277,FLOS AEVORUM,Give answer: all the patient power
278,FLOS AEVORUM,"That to this perfect ending wrought,"
279,FLOS AEVORUM,Shall it mean nothing but an hour?
280,FLOS AEVORUM,Say not that it is all for nought
281,FLOS AEVORUM,Time brings Eternity a flower.
282,FLOS AEVORUM,
283,FLOS AEVORUM,All the words in all the world
284,FLOS AEVORUM,"Cannot tell you how I love you,"
285,FLOS AEVORUM,All the little stars that shine

430,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Some morning planet 'tis that sings;
431,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Surely from no small feathered throat
432,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Wells that august, eternal note."
433,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,
434,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"As some old language of the dead,"
435,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"In one resounding syllable,"
436,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Says Rome and Greece and all is said--
437,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,A simple word a child may spell;
438,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,So in your liquid note impearled
439,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Sings the long epic of the world.
440,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,
441,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Unfathomed sweetness of your song,"

444,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"With shudder unimagined, bore"

449,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Of speech that speaks not, save as speaks"
450,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"The moon in heaven, yet hath power"
451,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,To tell the soul the thing it seeks.
452,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"And pack, as by some wizard's art,"

454,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,
455,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"To you, sweet bird, one well might feign--"
456,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,With such authority you sing
457,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"So clear, yet so profound, a strain"
458,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Into the simple ear of spring--
459,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Some secret understanding given

465,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Seem calling yonder in the sky;
466,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,And there is something the song saith
467,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,That makes me unafraid of death.
468,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,
469,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Now the slow light fills all the trees,"
470,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"The world, before so still and strange,"

472,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Back to its common self must change,"
473,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,And little gossip shapes of song
474,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,The porches of the morning throng.
475,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,
476,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Not yours with such as these to vie
477,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"That of the day's small business sing,"
478,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Voice of man's heart and of God's sky--
479,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,But O you make so deep a thing
480,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,"Of joy, I dare not think of pain"
481,TO A BIRD AT DAWN,Until I hear you sing again.

488,ALMA VENUS,"Of shelving ice and shattered slabs of cold,"
489,ALMA VENUS,"Stern wreckage of the fiercely frozen wave,"
490,ALMA VENUS,Gleaming in mailed wastes of white and gold;

493,ALMA VENUS,"Softly, all lover, to the April moon:"
494,ALMA VENUS,Hardly a breath! yet was I now aware

498,ALMA VENUS,Not of the earth it was--no living thing

503,ALMA VENUS,"Rock cedars, like a summer soul astray,"
504,ALMA VENUS,"A lone red squirrel makes believe to play,"
505,ALMA VENUS,Nibbling the frozen snow.
506,ALMA VENUS,
507,ALMA VENUS,"Not of the earth, that hath not scent nor song,"
508,ALMA VENUS,"Nor hope of aught, nor memory, nor dream,"

520,ALMA VENUS,"And, as behind a screen, on the sea's rim"
521,ALMA VENUS,"Hid softnesses of sunshine come and go,"
522,ALMA VENUS,And shadowy coasts in sudden glory swim--
523,ALMA VENUS,O land made out of distance and desire!--
524,ALMA VENUS,With ports of mystic pearl and crests of fire.
525,ALMA VENUS,
526,ALMA VENUS,"Thence, somewhere in the spaces of the sea,"
527,ALMA VENUS,Travelled this halcyon breath presaging Spring;
528,ALMA VENUS,Over the water even now secretly
529,ALMA VENUS,She maketh ready in her hands to bring
530,ALMA VENUS,Blossom and blade and wing;
531,ALMA VENUS,"And soon the wave shall ripple with her feet,"
532,ALMA VENUS,"And her wild hair be blown about the skies,"
533,ALMA VENUS,
534,ALMA VENUS,"And with her bosom all the world grow sweet,"
535,ALMA VENUS,And blue with the sea-blue of her deep eyes
536,ALMA VENUS,"The meadow, like another sea, shall flower,"
537,ALMA VENUS,And all the earth be song and singing shower;
538,ALMA VENUS,"While watching, in some hollow of the grass"
539,ALMA VENUS,"By the sea's edge, I may behold her stand,"

962,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"On roof and weeping window-pane,"
963,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And, 'whiles I'd watch the flying spray"

977,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,
978,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"Yet seemed it, as to sleep I turned,"
979,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"Pausing a little while to pray,"
980,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,That not mis-spent had been the day;
981,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,That I had somehow wisdom learned
982,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"From those wild waters in the bay,"
983,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,And from the fire as it burned;
984,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And that the rain, in some strange way,"
985,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,Had words of high import to say;
986,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And that the wind, with fitful cry,"
987,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"Did some immortal message try,"
988,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,Striving to make some meaning clear
989,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,Important for my soul to hear.
990,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,

994,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And what the sea would tell, in vain"
995,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"My soul doth of itself enquire,--"
996,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,And yet a meaning too doth find:
997,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,
998,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,For what am I that hears and sees
999,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,But a strange brother of all these

1001,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And I, mysteriously I,"

1007,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And know, yet know not, what they say:"
1008,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"Know not, yet know, the fire's tongue"
1009,THE MYSTIC FRIENDS,"And the rain's elegiac song,"

1051,THE COUNTRY GODS,"Ye shall not speak, ye shall not hear;"
1052,THE COUNTRY GODS,"Nor shall you fear your heart to say,"
1053,THE COUNTRY GODS,Lest he who listens shall betray.
1054,THE COUNTRY GODS,
1055,THE COUNTRY GODS,The man who hearkens all day long
1056,THE COUNTRY GODS,To the sea's cosmic-thoughted song
1057,THE COUNTRY GODS,"Comes with purged ears to lesser speech,"
1058,THE COUNTRY GODS,And something of the skyey reach
1059,THE COUNTRY GODS,Greatens the gaze that feeds on space;
1060,THE COUNTRY GODS,The starlight writes upon his face
1061,THE COUNTRY GODS,"That bathes in starlight, and the morn"
1062,THE COUNTRY GODS,"Chrisms with dew, when day is born,"

1064,THE COUNTRY GODS,Welling from the deep springs of night.
