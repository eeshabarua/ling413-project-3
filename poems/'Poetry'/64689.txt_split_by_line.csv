49,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.
50,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
51,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
52,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A woman in France got the spinal disease,"
53,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And from that sad moment she had no more ease;
54,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To add to her anguish, she very soon found,"
55,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Oh, horrors! her back was becoming quite round."
56,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
57,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The spasms of physical pain she endured,"
58,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Were keen, I assure you, and could not be cured;"
59,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But bad as these were, it seems, on the whole,"
60,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,They could not compare with the pangs of her soul.
61,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
62,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For I must inform you, O dear reader mine--"
63,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"(I’m in my third verse, and indeed it is time)--"
64,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"That our stylish Parisian was Fashion’s dear slave,"
65,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And to its sweet service her brain and time gave.
66,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
67,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"If she had been poet or artist or sage,"
68,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Or one of “the women,” so called, “of the age,”"
69,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With missions to Art, or the indigent poor,"
70,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Her crooked vertébra she might well endure.
71,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
72,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For ’tis of no consequence, surely, I say,"
73,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,If strong-minded women who flaunt in our day
74,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Their rights to more freedom for work and for speech
75,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Are placed by disease quite beyond the world’s reach.
76,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
77,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Such women belong to that low, common kind"
78,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Who assert that an active condition of mind
79,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Or of hands (me! how vulgar!) does make, after all,"
80,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,What we a true woman can worthily call.
81,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
82,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But say, of what consequence, pray, can it be"
83,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"If females with such vulgar notions, you see,"
84,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Are forced to stop work and all bold agitations
85,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Of questions important to churches and nations
86,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
87,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Because of a weakness of brain and of spine?
88,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"(Both organs, alas! being in a _decline_.)"
89,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"It matters but little, if women like these,"
90,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Are deprived of all usefulness, comfort, and ease."
91,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
92,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But when a fair daughter of Fashion--a treasure,"
93,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Who lives but to seek and to find her own pleasure,"
94,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A victim becomes to keen pains that do rack,"
95,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To pains that quite ruin the shape of her back--
96,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
97,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Here, here is a tale that makes the heart bleed!"
98,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,A tale wholly fit for a poet indeed!
99,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Before I have finished, however, you’ll find"
100,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,That sunlight with shadow is herein combined.
101,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
102,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"At present the shadow rests over my maid,"
103,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,While wrapped in reflection she sits in the shade.
104,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Her brain being small, is quite like the pot"
105,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Which, owing to smallness, so soon became hot."
106,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
107,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"It seems at this moment, in truth, quite on fire,"
108,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Harassed as it is with the spasms of ire,"
109,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"That seize it in thinking of hopes all destroyed,"
110,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Her figure quite ruined! her future a void!
111,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
112,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For I must inform you, our “charmante Française,”"
113,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Deluded as all of us were in those days,"
114,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Considered it really a feminine charm,"
115,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To carry the figure--including the arm--
116,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
117,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"According to Nature in some slight degree,"
118,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With freedom and unstudied grace, don’t you see?"
119,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A form finely poised, and free in its motion,"
120,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Is surely a sign--at least, such was the notion--"
121,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
122,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Of youth and of health. Even some thought that grace
123,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Had a meaning and charm quite beyond a doll face.
124,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,But all such ideas have of course now gone by
125,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,In times when the fashions do Nature defy.
126,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
127,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"As I was just saying, our “charmante Française,”"
128,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Deluded as all of us were in those days,"
129,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Was tortured with agony now at the thought
130,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Of the change which the spinal affection had wrought
131,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
132,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"In her whose fine figure, a short time ago,"
133,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Arrayed in rare furbelows, made such a show"
134,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"On the “Boulevards;” also when on her white mare,"
135,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Erect and in “stove-pipe” she pranced with the air
136,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
137,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Which marks the great “parvenues” out as that class
138,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Whose eyes, looking over you, say, “Let me pass!"
139,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Do you know who I am? I’ve a carriage and four,"
140,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,A poodle and twenty-five servants and more.”
141,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
142,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But I am digressing. The subject is great,"
143,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And I fear I shall never get through at this rate.
144,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To return to “mes moutons,” I mean to my maid;"
145,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"We left her, remember, in wrath and in shade."
146,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
147,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,[Illustration]
148,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
149,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She sat in the shade, for she feared that the light"
150,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Would bring to her vision that horrible sight,"
151,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A female with vertebral column askew,"
152,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And now as she sat here she dreaded the view.
153,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
154,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But at the next moment a thought bright as fire,"
155,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Seemed to burn in her eyes and to chase away ire;
156,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She rose, in a tremor of joy, from the gloom,"
157,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And opening the shutters, made bright the whole room."
158,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
159,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She then all at once did proceed, with a rush,"
160,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To fasten a pillow, with cheeks all a-flush,"
161,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Just under her skirt, quite behind at the back,"
162,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And then she donned quickly a hat and a sack--
163,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
164,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Seized quicker a parasol; then without fear,"
165,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,She faced the long mirror with eyes all a-cheer
166,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With some inspiration, that strangely did lend"
167,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To a spine badly bent an additional bend.
168,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
169,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Pray what was she doing? you ask, all amazed,"
170,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Perhaps you imagine the girl was quite crazed,"
171,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Or trying a cure--and that’s madness enough--
172,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,With “similia similibus” ideas and such stuff.
173,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
174,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Oh, no! my dear Reader; she’s simply intent"
175,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"On proving in practice the worth of a bent,"
176,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Which entered her mind a few moments ago,"
177,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And set all her brain and her heart in a glow.
178,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
179,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"In short, all creations of genius, you know,"
180,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Originate, so they say, always just so;"
181,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Quite all of a sudden, undreamt of, they’re born"
182,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,In the brain which seeks after to give them a form.
183,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
184,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The form which our heroine sought now to give
185,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To her noble creation was, sure as I live,"
186,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A crook in the back and a crook in the arm,"
187,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And with these same crooks she means yet to charm
188,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
189,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Her circle of former admirers and friends,"
190,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And, after a ripe preparation, intends"
191,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To make her “_début_” in a style very new,"
192,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Unknown to the crowd or e’en the rare _few_.
193,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
194,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Oh, view her, as now she continues to pass"
195,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Up and down, while she studies herself in the glass!"
196,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With parasol raised very high in the air,"
197,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And spine really taking a curve, I declare,"
198,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
199,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Exceeding by far the long crook that disease
200,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Had wrought there in hours void of rest and of ease,"
201,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And yet, I assure you, her face glows with smiles,"
202,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,While practicing poses the hours she beguiles.
203,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
204,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But while I still watched her, a cloud thin as air,"
205,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Passed over the features that now seemed so fair;
206,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With eyes on the mirror, I heard her exclaim,"
207,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,“Oh! dear me! oh! dear me! I’ve lost it again.”
208,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
209,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She takes a new bend--then cries, “That’s not it!”"
210,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Here, dear reader mine, she was seized with a fit"
211,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of abdominal colic, which only did serve"
212,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To add, you perceive, to her back a new curve."
213,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
214,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The full extra curve produced by the pain,"
215,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Brought strangely the smiles to her features again;
216,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She cried, “Oh! kind Providence surely did send"
217,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,This spasm to give me the ‘true Grecian bend!’
218,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
219,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"“The ‘true Grecian bend!’ here, here is a name"
220,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Which soon will acquire a most glorious fame!
221,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"It hides my poor hump altogether, you see,"
222,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And a leader of fashion again I will be!”
223,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
224,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Since the colic referred to, by Providence sent,"
225,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Two weeks had gone by, and our damsel had bent"
226,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Whatever of strength she possessed to attain
227,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The “true Grecian bend,” and it was not in vain."
228,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
229,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The day now arrived for the startling “début,”"
230,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And our heroine smiling emerged to the view
231,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of the Boulevards, where “tout le monde” in a maze"
232,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,At the strange apparatus in wonder did gaze.
233,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
234,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"This strange apparatus, as I before said,"
235,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Perched on heels that supported a hump on the head,"
236,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,A hump on the back and a crook in the arm
237,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Presented a vision entitled to charm
238,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
239,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The eyes of all artists; for sure ’tis their duty
240,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To recognize always the true curve of beauty;
241,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And who can deny that here was a curve
242,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Sufficiently curving as model to serve?
243,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
244,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The world, as I said, at first in a maze,"
245,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,With sneers at the strange apparatus did gaze;
246,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,But when this same world at last did discover
247,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The “strange apparatus” was she, and no other,"
248,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
249,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Who only last year the gay fashion did lead,"
250,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And lived on the Boulevard Malesherbes indeed!
251,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,They suddenly found that her present strange style
252,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Was but a new fashion she’d set all the while.
253,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
254,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Upon the discovery that, without doubt,"
255,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The humps and the crooks were “_the_ latest out;”
256,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"With common accord the dear feminine gender,"
257,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,At once set to work in trying to render
258,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
259,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Themselves in appearance as near as could be,"
260,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To her who was now all the fashion, you see."
261,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,So where only yesterday out on the street
262,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But one crooked female you might chance to meet,"
263,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
264,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To-day there existed a hundred at least,"
265,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Who made up a pantomime, truly a feast"
266,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of color and form, to him who delights"
267,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,In fine graceful contours and that sort of sights;
268,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
269,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And yet it is proper that I should confess
270,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"(For to know “what is what” I did never profess),"
271,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The sight of curved females at first raised a question
272,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Which seemed to me worthy some solid reflection.
273,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
274,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The question was this: if ’tis true as averred,"
275,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Human origin may to the ape be referred,"
276,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Then we are now turning, I boldly declare,"
277,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To monkeys again. Pray look at the air
278,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
279,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Of that monkey the organ-man carries about.
280,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Gaze but a short moment and you will find out
281,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"When standing, his back just describes the outline"
282,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of that fashionable female, in garments so fine."
283,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
284,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Does not this resemblance, oh, tell me, I pray,"
285,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"’Twixt apes and the fashionable dames of to-day,"
286,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Suggest to your mind the identical question,"
287,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Which seemed to me worthy some solid reflection?
288,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
289,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,[Illustration]
290,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
291,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"I say, that it _seemed_, for I must explain,"
292,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"On seeing the bend, I could not refrain"
293,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"At first from scorn and dejection, but now"
294,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"My feelings are altered entirely, I vow."
295,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
296,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For when by the dashing “beau-monde” I was told,"
297,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The bend was the _fashion_--I soon came to hold
298,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Opinions quite different; believe me, to-day"
299,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,It seems to me “stylish” and most distingué.
300,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
301,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And now I must tell you, last week at a dance,"
302,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"I found out the origin, quite by mere chance,"
303,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of the “bend” surnamed “Grecian,” and then, think says I,"
304,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The fair sex shall know this; at once I will try
305,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
306,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To tell them in some way. So, spite of delays,"
307,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"I’ve written the story of the “charmante Française,”"
308,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,And while I congratulate all my fair friends
309,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Who now are expert in the various “bends,”"
310,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
311,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,A word I would add--it is this: forget not
312,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,How specially favored and blest is your lot.
313,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For you can have humps, if you like, on the back,"
314,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Without the bad colic and pains that did rack
315,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
316,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"The female whose spine the best doctors couldn’t mend,"
317,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,But oh! she invented “the true Grecian bend!”
318,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A “bend” born of suffering truly pathetic,"
319,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,A “bend” scientific as well as æsthetic.
320,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
321,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Now all of you know, I make bold to infer,"
322,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The “colic” and “pains” did in Paris occur.
323,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Of course we Americans would not receive
324,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Any fashions but those of imported disease:
325,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
326,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Excuse me: I mean that the “modes” are imported,"
327,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"For it is very true, as has oft been reported,"
328,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,We worship all things of Parisian extraction;
329,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Why, even its morals (?) have quite an attraction!"
330,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
331,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Of course, we despise them, but then, don’t you see,"
332,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,They come after all from the stylish “Paris?”
333,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Oh! wondrous Bill Shakspeare, of very huge fame!"
334,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"You lied, Sir, in saying all names were the same."
335,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
336,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But now before closing, I gladly extend"
337,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To all who desire to attain the true bend,"
338,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A single suggestion, pray don’t pass it by,"
339,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"But listen, then, labor “and never say die!”"
340,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
341,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"In every Art-study you’ll find it is best,"
342,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To model from Nature with uniform zest.
343,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Oh, come now with me! I’ll show you to-night,"
344,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,The model I spoke of--a pitiful sight.
345,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
346,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,We’ll leave the gay avenue--this is the way--
347,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Through byways and lanes where the clear light of day
348,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Has no room to enter. Here godless despair
349,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Finds vent in wild curses and cries--do you dare
350,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
351,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"To utter reproaches? Come, come, do not shrink;"
352,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"You find the air stifling? Why, now only think,"
353,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,You’re here but a moment and quite lose your breath;
354,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Yet many will dwell here from birth unto death.
355,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
356,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"You cannot return, though chilling the gloom,"
357,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,For in this dark building we’ll find a dark room;
358,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"This stairway leads to it--come, let us ascend;"
359,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"I’ll show you the model I spoke of, my friend."
360,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
361,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"’Tis long after midnight;--we reach very soon,"
362,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Up by the dark stairway, the room through the gloom;"
363,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And here in the corner, where burns a pale light,"
364,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Sits sewing and shivering a woman to-night.
365,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
366,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Through many a season, drooped low o’er her knee,"
367,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She’s sat there, and often she scarcely could see"
368,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"What stitches to take, so flickering her lamp!"
369,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,So weary her eyes! so chilling the damp!
370,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
371,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,[Illustration]
372,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
373,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Two little ones sleep at her side on the floor;
374,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,At times she looks towards them with heart very sore
375,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"At the thought of their cries at the last scanty meal,"
376,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,At the thought that on waking how hungry they’ll feel.
377,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
378,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"“Oh! what shall I give them? the crusts are quite dry,"
379,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Yet they’re all that I have.” With many a sigh
380,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"She turns to her work, for she knows when ’tis done"
381,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,More bread can be bought with the shilling she’s won.
382,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
383,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"O brave, weary mother! the morning has come;"
384,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"You’re hungry and cold, but the work is not done."
385,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Thus through the sad seasons she’s bent o’er her knee
386,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"So low that her back has a curve, don’t you see--"
387,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
388,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A curve truly Grecian! I’m sure you would find,"
389,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Should you dress her in fashionable clothes of the kind
390,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Worn now, she’d look “stylish” and have quite an “air.”"
391,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Her “bend” is more perfect by far, I declare,"
392,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
393,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Than that of our ladies so fine and so gay
394,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,Who walk in the avenues day after day;
395,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And surely an outline by Nature designed,"
396,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Is much the best model, if you are inclined,"
397,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
398,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Fair lady, to triumph and truly intend"
399,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,To study as artist the “true Grecian bend.”
400,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"A model from Nature! now, here is the question,"

411,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Yourself and the fashions, and that we’d regret."
412,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,
413,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Fair lady, oh! guard against this above all,"
414,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,For what sadder lot could e’er you befall?
415,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"And what would become of the “beau-monde” to-day,"

425,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"That Providence kindly a colic did send,"
426,TRUE GRECIAN BEND.,"Which gave you, dear ladies, the “true Grecian bend!”"
