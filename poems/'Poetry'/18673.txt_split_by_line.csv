203,GARDEN OF AN OLD ENGLISH MANOR HOUSE,
204,I,I
205,I,
206,I,A star in the silence that follows
207,I,The song of the death of the sun
208,I,"Speaks music in heaven, and the hollows"
209,I,And heights of the world are as one;
210,I,One lyre that outsings and outlightens
211,I,"The rapture of sunset, and thrills"
212,I,Mute night till the sense of it brightens
213,I,The soul that it fills.
214,I,
215,I,The flowers of the sun that is sunken
216,I,Hang heavy of heart as of head;
217,I,The bees that have eaten and drunken
218,I,The soul of their sweetness are fled;
219,I,"But a sunflower of song, on whose honey"
220,I,"My spirit has fed as a bee,"
221,I,Makes sunnier than morning was sunny
222,I,The twilight for me.
223,I,
224,I,The letters and lines on the pages
225,I,That sundered mine eyes and the flowers
226,I,Wax faint as the shadows of ages
227,I,That sunder their season and ours;
228,I,As the ghosts of the centuries that sever
229,I,A season of colourless time
230,I,"From the days whose remembrance is ever,"
231,I,"As they were, sublime."
232,I,
233,I,The season that bred and that cherished
234,I,"The soul that I commune with yet,"
235,I,Had it utterly withered and perished
236,I,"To rise not again as it set,"
237,I,Shame were it that Englishmen living
238,I,Should read as their forefathers read
239,I,The books of the praise and thanksgiving
240,I,Of Englishmen dead.
241,I,
242,I,O light of the land that adored thee
243,I,"And kindled thy soul with her breath,"
244,I,"Whose life, such as fate would afford thee,"
245,I,"Was lovelier than aught but thy death,"
246,I,"By what name, could thy lovers but know it,"
247,I,"Might love of thee hail thee afar,"
248,I,"Philisides, Astrophel, poet"
249,I,Whose love was thy star?
250,I,
251,I,"A star in the moondawn of Maytime,"
252,I,A star in the cloudland of change;
253,I,Too splendid and sad for the daytime
254,I,To cheer or eclipse or estrange;
255,I,Too sweet for tradition or vision
256,I,To see but through shadows of tears
257,I,Rise deathless across the division
258,I,Of measureless years.
259,I,
260,I,The twilight may deepen and harden
261,I,As nightward the stream of it runs
262,I,Till starshine transfigure a garden
263,I,Whose radiance responds to the sun's:
264,I,The light of the love of thee darkens
265,I,The lights that arise and that set:
266,I,The love that forgets thee not hearkens
267,I,If England forget.
268,I,
269,I,
270,II,II
271,II,
272,II,Bright and brief in the sight of grief and love the light of thy
273,II,"lifetime shone,"
274,II,"Seen and felt by the gifts it dealt, the grace it gave, and again"
275,II,was gone:
276,II,"Ay, but now it is death, not thou, whom time has conquered as years"
277,II,pass on.
278,II,
279,II,"Ay, not yet may the land forget that bore and loved thee and"
280,II,"praised and wept,"
281,II,"Sidney, lord of the stainless sword, the name of names that her"
282,II,heart's love kept
283,II,"Fast as thine did her own, a sign to light thy life till it sank"
284,II,and slept.
285,II,
286,II,Bright as then for the souls of men thy brave Arcadia resounds and
287,II,"shines,"
288,II,Lit with love that beholds above all joys and sorrows the steadfast
289,II,"signs,"
290,II,"Faith, a splendour that hope makes tender, and truth, whose presage"
291,II,the soul divines.
292,II,
293,II,All the glory that girds the story of all thy life as with sunlight
294,II,"round,"
295,II,"All the spell that on all souls fell who saw thy spirit, and held"
296,II,"them bound,"
297,II,Lives for all that have heard the call and cadence yet of its music
298,II,sound.
299,II,
300,II,"Music bright as the soul of light, for wings an eagle, for notes a"
301,II,"dove,"
302,II,Leaps and shines from the lustrous lines wherethrough thy soul from
303,II,afar above
304,II,Shone and sang till the darkness rang with light whose fire is the
305,II,fount of love.
306,II,
307,II,"Love that led thee alive, and fed thy soul with sorrows and joys"
308,II,"and fears,"
309,II,"Love that sped thee, alive and dead, to fame's fair goal with thy"
310,II,"peerless peers,"
311,II,Feeds the flame of thy quenchless name with light that lightens the
312,II,rayless years.
313,II,
314,II,Dark as sorrow though night and morrow may lower with presage of
315,II,"clouded fame,"
316,II,"How may she that of old bare thee, may Sidney's England, be brought"
317,II,to shame?
318,II,"How should this be, while England is? What need of answer beyond"
319,II,thy name?
320,II,
321,II,
322,III,III
323,III,
324,III,"From the love that transfigures thy glory,"
325,III,"From the light of the dawn of thy death,"
326,III,The life of thy song and thy story
327,III,Took subtler and fierier breath.
328,III,"And we, though the day and the morrow"
329,III,"Set fear and thanksgiving at strife,"
330,III,Hail yet in the star of thy sorrow
331,III,The sun of thy life.
332,III,
333,III,"Shame and fear may beset men here, and bid thanksgiving and pride"
334,III,be dumb:
335,III,"Faith, discrowned of her praise, and wound about with toils till"
336,III,"her life wax numb,"
337,III,"Scarce may see if the sundawn be, if darkness die not and dayrise"
338,III,come.
339,III,
340,III,"But England, enmeshed and benetted"
341,III,"With spiritless villainies round,"
342,III,"With counsels of cowardice fretted,"
343,III,"With trammels of treason enwound,"
344,III,"Is yet, though the season be other"
345,III,"Than wept and rejoiced over thee,"
346,III,"Thine England, thy lover, thy mother,"
347,III,Sublime as the sea.
348,III,
349,III,"Hers wast thou: if her face be now less bright, or seem for an hour"
350,III,"less brave,"
351,III,"Let but thine on her darkness shine, thy saviour spirit revive and"
352,III,"save,"
353,III,"Time shall see, as the shadows flee, her shame entombed in a"
354,III,shameful grave.
355,III,
356,III,If death and not life were the portal
357,III,"That opens on life at the last,"
358,III,If the spirit of Sidney were mortal
359,III,"And the past of it utterly past,"
360,III,"Fear stronger than honour was ever,"
361,III,"Forgetfulness mightier than fame,"
362,III,Faith knows not if England should never
363,III,Subside into shame.
364,III,
365,III,"Yea, but yet is thy sun not set, thy sunbright spirit of trust"
366,III,withdrawn:
367,III,England's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears
368,III,that fawn:
369,III,Hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon
370,III,darkness dawn.
371,III,
372,III,The sunset that sunrise will follow
373,III,Is less than the dream of a dream:
374,III,The starshine on height and on hollow
375,III,Sheds promise that dawn shall redeem:
376,III,"The night, if the daytime would hide it,"
377,III,"Shows lovelier, aflame and afar,"
378,III,"Thy soul and thy Stella's beside it,"
379,III,A star by a star.

385,A NYMPHOLEPT,
386,A NYMPHOLEPT,
387,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Summer, and noon, and a splendour of silence, felt,"
388,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Seen, and heard of the spirit within the sense."
389,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Soft through the frondage the shades of the sunbeams melt,"
390,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Sharp through the foliage the shafts of them, keen and dense,"
391,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Cleave, as discharged from the string of the God's bow, tense"
392,A NYMPHOLEPT,"As a war-steed's girth, and bright as a warrior's belt."
393,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Ah, why should an hour that is heaven for an hour pass hence?"
394,A NYMPHOLEPT,
395,A NYMPHOLEPT,"I dare not sleep for delight of the perfect hour,"
396,A NYMPHOLEPT,Lest God be wroth that his gift should be scorned of man.
397,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The face of the warm bright world is the face of a flower,"
398,A NYMPHOLEPT,The word of the wind and the leaves that the light winds fan
399,A NYMPHOLEPT,"As the word that quickened at first into flame, and ran,"
400,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Creative and subtle and fierce with invasive power,"
401,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Through darkness and cloud, from the breath of the one God, Pan."
402,A NYMPHOLEPT,
403,A NYMPHOLEPT,The perfume of earth possessed by the sun pervades
404,A NYMPHOLEPT,The chaster air that he soothes but with sense of sleep.
405,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Soft, imminent, strong as desire that prevails and fades,"
406,A NYMPHOLEPT,The passing noon that beholds not a cloudlet weep
407,A NYMPHOLEPT,Imbues and impregnates life with delight more deep
408,A NYMPHOLEPT,Than dawn or sunset or moonrise on lawns or glades
409,A NYMPHOLEPT,Can shed from the skies that receive it and may not keep.
410,A NYMPHOLEPT,
411,A NYMPHOLEPT,The skies may hold not the splendour of sundown fast;
412,A NYMPHOLEPT,It wanes into twilight as dawn dies down into day.
413,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And the moon, triumphant when twilight is overpast,"
414,A NYMPHOLEPT,Takes pride but awhile in the hours of her stately sway.
415,A NYMPHOLEPT,"But the might of the noon, though the light of it pass away,"
416,A NYMPHOLEPT,Leaves earth fulfilled of desires and of dreams that last;
417,A NYMPHOLEPT,But if any there be that hath sense of them none can say.
418,A NYMPHOLEPT,
419,A NYMPHOLEPT,"For if any there be that hath sight of them, sense, or trust"
420,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Made strong by the might of a vision, the strength of a dream,"
421,A NYMPHOLEPT,"His lips shall straiten and close as a dead man's must,"
422,A NYMPHOLEPT,His heart shall be sealed as the voice of a frost-bound stream.
423,A NYMPHOLEPT,For the deep mid mystery of light and of heat that seem
424,A NYMPHOLEPT,"To clasp and pierce dark earth, and enkindle dust,"
425,A NYMPHOLEPT,Shall a man's faith say what it is? or a man's guess deem?
426,A NYMPHOLEPT,
427,A NYMPHOLEPT,Sleep lies not heavier on eyes that have watched all night
428,A NYMPHOLEPT,Than hangs the heat of the noon on the hills and trees.
429,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Why now should the haze not open, and yield to sight"
430,A NYMPHOLEPT,A fairer secret than hope or than slumber sees?
431,A NYMPHOLEPT,"I seek not heaven with submission of lips and knees,"
432,A NYMPHOLEPT,With worship and prayer for a sign till it leap to light:
433,A NYMPHOLEPT,"I gaze on the gods about me, and call on these."
434,A NYMPHOLEPT,
435,A NYMPHOLEPT,"I call on the gods hard by, the divine dim powers"
436,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Whose likeness is here at hand, in the breathless air,"
437,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In the pulseless peace of the fervid and silent flowers,"
438,A NYMPHOLEPT,In the faint sweet speech of the waters that whisper there.
439,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Ah, what should darkness do in a world so fair?"
440,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The bent-grass heaves not, the couch-grass quails not or cowers;"
441,A NYMPHOLEPT,The wind's kiss frets not the rowan's or aspen's hair.
442,A NYMPHOLEPT,
443,A NYMPHOLEPT,"But the silence trembles with passion of sound suppressed,"
444,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And the twilight quivers and yearns to the sunward, wrung"
445,A NYMPHOLEPT,With love as with pain; and the wide wood's motionless breast
446,A NYMPHOLEPT,Is thrilled with a dumb desire that would fain find tongue
447,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And palpitates, tongueless as she whom a man-snake stung,"
448,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Whose heart now heaves in the nightingale, never at rest"
449,A NYMPHOLEPT,Nor satiated ever with song till her last be sung.
450,A NYMPHOLEPT,
451,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Is it rapture or terror that circles me round, and invades"
452,A NYMPHOLEPT,Each vein of my life with hope--if it be not fear?
453,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Each pulse that awakens my blood into rapture fades,"
454,A NYMPHOLEPT,Each pulse that subsides into dread of a strange thing near
455,A NYMPHOLEPT,Requickens with sense of a terror less dread than dear.
456,A NYMPHOLEPT,Is peace not one with light in the deep green glades
457,A NYMPHOLEPT,Where summer at noonday slumbers? Is peace not here?
458,A NYMPHOLEPT,
459,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The tall thin stems of the firs, and the roof sublime"
460,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That screens from the sun the floor of the steep still wood,"
461,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Deep, silent, splendid, and perfect and calm as time,"
462,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Stand fast as ever in sight of the night they stood,"
463,A NYMPHOLEPT,When night gave all that moonlight and dewfall could.
464,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The dense ferns deepen, the moss glows warm as the thyme:"
465,A NYMPHOLEPT,The wild heath quivers about me: the world is good.
466,A NYMPHOLEPT,
467,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Is it Pan's breath, fierce in the tremulous maidenhair,"
468,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That bids fear creep as a snake through the woodlands, felt"
469,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In the leaves that it stirs not yet, in the mute bright air,"
470,A NYMPHOLEPT,In the stress of the sun? For here has the great God dwelt:
471,A NYMPHOLEPT,For hence were the shafts of his love or his anger dealt.
472,A NYMPHOLEPT,"For here has his wrath been fierce as his love was fair,"
473,A NYMPHOLEPT,When each was as fire to the darkness its breath bade melt.
474,A NYMPHOLEPT,
475,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Is it love, is it dread, that enkindles the trembling noon,"
476,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That yearns, reluctant in rapture that fear has fed,"
477,A NYMPHOLEPT,"As man for woman, as woman for man? Full soon,"
478,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If I live, and the life that may look on him drop not dead,"
479,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Shall the ear that hears not a leaf quake hear his tread,"
480,A NYMPHOLEPT,The sense that knows not the sound of the deep day's tune
481,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Receive the God, be it love that he brings or dread."
482,A NYMPHOLEPT,
483,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The naked noon is upon me: the fierce dumb spell,"
484,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The fearful charm of the strong sun's imminent might,"
485,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Unmerciful, steadfast, deeper than seas that swell,"
486,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Pervades, invades, appals me with loveless light,"
487,A NYMPHOLEPT,With harsher awe than breathes in the breath of night.
488,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Have mercy, God who art all! For I know thee well,"
489,A NYMPHOLEPT,"How sharp is thine eye to lighten, thine hand to smite."
490,A NYMPHOLEPT,
491,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The whole wood feels thee, the whole air fears thee: but fear"
492,A NYMPHOLEPT,"So deep, so dim, so sacred, is wellnigh sweet."
493,A NYMPHOLEPT,"For the light that hangs and broods on the woodlands here,"
494,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Intense, invasive, intolerant, imperious, and meet"
495,A NYMPHOLEPT,"To lighten the works of thine hands and the ways of thy feet,"
496,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Is hot with the fire of the breath of thy life, and dear"
497,A NYMPHOLEPT,As hope that shrivels or shrinks not for frost or heat.
498,A NYMPHOLEPT,
499,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Thee, thee the supreme dim godhead, approved afar,"
500,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Perceived of the soul and conceived of the sense of man,"
501,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We scarce dare love, and we dare not fear: the star"
502,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We call the sun, that lit us when life began"
503,A NYMPHOLEPT,"To brood on the world that is thine by his grace for a span,"
504,A NYMPHOLEPT,Conceals and reveals in the semblance of things that are
505,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Thine immanent presence, the pulse of thy heart's life, Pan."
506,A NYMPHOLEPT,
507,A NYMPHOLEPT,The fierce mid noon that wakens and warms the snake
508,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Conceals thy mercy, reveals thy wrath: and again"
509,A NYMPHOLEPT,The dew-bright hour that assuages the twilight brake
510,A NYMPHOLEPT,Conceals thy wrath and reveals thy mercy: then
511,A NYMPHOLEPT,Thou art fearful only for evil souls of men
512,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That feel with nightfall the serpent within them wake,"
513,A NYMPHOLEPT,And hate the holy darkness on glade and glen.
514,A NYMPHOLEPT,
515,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Yea, then we know not and dream not if ill things be,"
516,A NYMPHOLEPT,Or if aught of the work of the wrong of the world be thine.
517,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We hear not the footfall of terror that treads the sea,"
518,A NYMPHOLEPT,We hear not the moan of winds that assail the pine:
519,A NYMPHOLEPT,We see not if shipwreck reign in the storm's dim shrine;
520,A NYMPHOLEPT,If death do service and doom bear witness to thee
521,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We see not,--know not if blood for thy lips be wine."
522,A NYMPHOLEPT,
523,A NYMPHOLEPT,"But in all things evil and fearful that fear may scan,"
524,A NYMPHOLEPT,"As in all things good, as in all things fair that fall,"
525,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We know thee present and latent, the lord of man;"
526,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In the murmuring of doves, in the clamouring of winds that call"
527,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And wolves that howl for their prey; in the midnight's pall,"
528,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In the naked and nymph-like feet of the dawn, O Pan,"
529,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And in each life living, O thou the God who art all."
530,A NYMPHOLEPT,
531,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Smiling and singing, wailing and wringing of hands,"
532,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Laughing and weeping, watching and sleeping, still"
533,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Proclaim but and prove but thee, as the shifted sands"
534,A NYMPHOLEPT,Speak forth and show but the strength of the sea's wild will
535,A NYMPHOLEPT,That sifts and grinds them as grain in the storm-wind's mill.
536,A NYMPHOLEPT,In thee is the doom that falls and the doom that stands:
537,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The tempests utter thy word, and the stars fulfil."
538,A NYMPHOLEPT,
539,A NYMPHOLEPT,Where Etna shudders with passion and pain volcanic
540,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That rend her heart as with anguish that rends a man's,"
541,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Where Typho labours, and finds not his thews Titanic,"
542,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In breathless torment that ever the flame's breath fans,"
543,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Men felt and feared thee of old, whose pastoral clans"
544,A NYMPHOLEPT,Were given to the charge of thy keeping; and soundless panic
545,A NYMPHOLEPT,Held fast the woodland whose depths and whose heights were Pan's.
546,A NYMPHOLEPT,
547,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And here, though fear be less than delight, and awe"
548,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Be one with desire and with worship of earth and thee,"
549,A NYMPHOLEPT,"So mild seems now thy secret and speechless law,"
550,A NYMPHOLEPT,"So fair and fearless and faithful and godlike she,"
551,A NYMPHOLEPT,"So soft the spell of thy whisper on stream and sea,"
552,A NYMPHOLEPT,Yet man should fear lest he see what of old men saw
553,A NYMPHOLEPT,And withered: yet shall I quail if thy breath smite me.
554,A NYMPHOLEPT,
555,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Lord God of life and of light and of all things fair,"
556,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Lord God of ravin and ruin and all things dim,"
557,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Death seals up life, and darkness the sunbright air,"
558,A NYMPHOLEPT,And the stars that watch blind earth in the deep night swim
559,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Laugh, saying, ""What God is your God, that ye call on him?"
560,A NYMPHOLEPT,"What is man, that the God who is guide of our way should care"
561,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If day for a man be golden, or night be grim?"""
562,A NYMPHOLEPT,
563,A NYMPHOLEPT,"But thou, dost thou hear? Stars too but abide for a span,"
564,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Gods too but endure for a season; but thou, if thou be"
565,A NYMPHOLEPT,"God, more than shadows conceived and adored of man,"
566,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Kind Gods and fierce, that bound him or made him free,"
567,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The skies that scorn us are less in thy sight than we,"
568,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Whose souls have strength to conceive and perceive thee, Pan,"
569,A NYMPHOLEPT,With sense more subtle than senses that hear and see.
570,A NYMPHOLEPT,
571,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Yet may not it say, though it seek thee and think to find"
572,A NYMPHOLEPT,"One soul of sense in the fire and the frost-bound clod,"
573,A NYMPHOLEPT,"What heart is this, what spirit alive or blind,"
574,A NYMPHOLEPT,That moves thee: only we know that the ways we trod
575,A NYMPHOLEPT,"We tread, with hands unguided, with feet unshod,"
576,A NYMPHOLEPT,"With eyes unlightened; and yet, if with steadfast mind,"
577,A NYMPHOLEPT,Perchance may we find thee and know thee at last for God.
578,A NYMPHOLEPT,
579,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Yet then should God be dark as the dawn is bright,"
580,A NYMPHOLEPT,And bright as the night is dark on the world--no more.
581,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Light slays not darkness, and darkness absorbs not light;"
582,A NYMPHOLEPT,And the labour of evil and good from the years of yore
583,A NYMPHOLEPT,Is even as the labour of waves on a sunless shore.
584,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And he who is first and last, who is depth and height,"
585,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Keeps silence now, as the sun when the woods wax hoar."
586,A NYMPHOLEPT,
587,A NYMPHOLEPT,The dark dumb godhead innate in the fair world's life
588,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Imbues the rapture of dawn and of noon with dread,"
589,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Infects the peace of the star-shod night with strife,"
590,A NYMPHOLEPT,Informs with terror the sorrow that guards the dead.
591,A NYMPHOLEPT,No service of bended knee or of humbled head
592,A NYMPHOLEPT,May soothe or subdue the God who has change to wife:
593,A NYMPHOLEPT,And life with death is as morning with evening wed.
594,A NYMPHOLEPT,
595,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And yet, if the light and the life in the light that here"
596,A NYMPHOLEPT,Seem soft and splendid and fervid as sleep may seem
597,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Be more than the shine of a smile or the flash of a tear,"
598,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Sleep, change, and death are less than a spell-struck dream,"
599,A NYMPHOLEPT,And fear than the fall of a leaf on a starlit stream.
600,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And yet, if the hope that hath said it absorb not fear,"
601,A NYMPHOLEPT,What helps it man that the stars and the waters gleam?
602,A NYMPHOLEPT,
603,A NYMPHOLEPT,"What helps it man, that the noon be indeed intense,"
604,A NYMPHOLEPT,The night be indeed worth worship? Fear and pain
605,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Were lords and masters yet of the secret sense,"
606,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Which now dares deem not that light is as darkness, fain"
607,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Though dark dreams be to declare it, crying in vain."
608,A NYMPHOLEPT,"For whence, thou God of the light and the darkness, whence"
609,A NYMPHOLEPT,Dawns now this vision that bids not the sunbeams wane?
610,A NYMPHOLEPT,
611,A NYMPHOLEPT,"What light, what shadow, diviner than dawn or night,"
612,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Draws near, makes pause, and again--or I dream--draws near?"
613,A NYMPHOLEPT,"More soft than shadow, more strong than the strong sun's light,"
614,A NYMPHOLEPT,"More pure than moonbeams--yea, but the rays run sheer"
615,A NYMPHOLEPT,"As fire from the sun through the dusk of the pinewood, clear"
616,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And constant; yea, but the shadow itself is bright"
617,A NYMPHOLEPT,That the light clothes round with love that is one with fear.
618,A NYMPHOLEPT,
619,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Above and behind it the noon and the woodland lie,"
620,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Terrible, radiant with mystery, superb and subdued,"
621,A NYMPHOLEPT,Triumphant in silence; and hardly the sacred sky
622,A NYMPHOLEPT,Seems free from the tyrannous weight of the dumb fierce mood
623,A NYMPHOLEPT,Which rules as with fire and invasion of beams that brood
624,A NYMPHOLEPT,The breathless rapture of earth till its hour pass by
625,A NYMPHOLEPT,And leave her spirit released and her peace renewed.
626,A NYMPHOLEPT,
627,A NYMPHOLEPT,I sleep not: never in sleep has a man beholden
628,A NYMPHOLEPT,This. From the shadow that trembles and yearns with light
629,A NYMPHOLEPT,Suppressed and elate and reluctant--obscure and golden
630,A NYMPHOLEPT,As water kindled with presage of dawn or night--
631,A NYMPHOLEPT,"A form, a face, a wonder to sense and sight,"
632,A NYMPHOLEPT,Grows great as the moon through the month; and her eyes embolden
633,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Fear, till it change to desire, and desire to delight."
634,A NYMPHOLEPT,
635,A NYMPHOLEPT,I sleep not: sleep would die of a dream so strange;
636,A NYMPHOLEPT,"A dream so sweet would die as a rainbow dies,"
637,A NYMPHOLEPT,As a sunbow laughs and is lost on the waves that range
638,A NYMPHOLEPT,And reck not of light that flickers or spray that flies.
639,A NYMPHOLEPT,"But the sun withdraws not, the woodland shrinks not or sighs,"
640,A NYMPHOLEPT,No sweet thing sickens with sense or with fear of change;
641,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Light wounds not, darkness blinds not, my steadfast eyes."
642,A NYMPHOLEPT,
643,A NYMPHOLEPT,Only the soul in my sense that receives the soul
644,A NYMPHOLEPT,Whence now my spirit is kindled with breathless bliss
645,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Knows well if the light that wounds it with love makes whole,"
646,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If hopes that carol be louder than fears that hiss,"
647,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If truth be spoken of flowers and of waves that kiss,"
648,A NYMPHOLEPT,Of clouds and stars that contend for a sunbright goal.
649,A NYMPHOLEPT,And yet may I dream that I dream not indeed of this?
650,A NYMPHOLEPT,
651,A NYMPHOLEPT,"An earth-born dreamer, constrained by the bonds of birth,"
652,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Held fast by the flesh, compelled by his veins that beat"
653,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And kindle to rapture or wrath, to desire or to mirth,"
654,A NYMPHOLEPT,"May hear not surely the fall of immortal feet,"
655,A NYMPHOLEPT,May feel not surely if heaven upon earth be sweet;
656,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And here is my sense fulfilled of the joys of earth,"
657,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Light, silence, bloom, shade, murmur of leaves that meet."
658,A NYMPHOLEPT,
659,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Bloom, fervour, and perfume of grasses and flowers aglow,"
660,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Breathe and brighten about me: the darkness gleams,"
661,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The sweet light shivers and laughs on the slopes below,"
662,A NYMPHOLEPT,Made soft by leaves that lighten and change like dreams;
663,A NYMPHOLEPT,The silence thrills with the whisper of secret streams
664,A NYMPHOLEPT,That well from the heart of the woodland: these I know:
665,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Earth bore them, heaven sustained them with showers and beams."
666,A NYMPHOLEPT,
667,A NYMPHOLEPT,"I lean my face to the heather, and drink the sun"
668,A NYMPHOLEPT,Whose flame-lit odour satiates the flowers: mine eyes
669,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Close, and the goal of delight and of life is one:"
670,A NYMPHOLEPT,No more I crave of earth or her kindred skies.
671,A NYMPHOLEPT,No more? But the joy that springs from them smiles and flies:
672,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The sweet work wrought of them surely, the good work done,"
673,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If the mind and the face of the season be loveless, dies."
674,A NYMPHOLEPT,
675,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Thee, therefore, thee would I come to, cleave to, cling,"
676,A NYMPHOLEPT,"If haply thy heart be kind and thy gifts be good,"
677,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Unknown sweet spirit, whose vesture is soft in spring,"
678,A NYMPHOLEPT,"In summer splendid, in autumn pale as the wood"
679,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That shudders and wanes and shrinks as a shamed thing should,"
680,A NYMPHOLEPT,In winter bright as the mail of a war-worn king
681,A NYMPHOLEPT,Who stands where foes fled far from the face of him stood.
682,A NYMPHOLEPT,
683,A NYMPHOLEPT,"My spirit or thine is it, breath of thy life or of mine,"
684,A NYMPHOLEPT,Which fills my sense with a rapture that casts out fear?
685,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Pan's dim frown wanes, and his wild eyes brighten as thine,"
686,A NYMPHOLEPT,Transformed as night or as day by the kindling year.
687,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Earth-born, or mine eye were withered that sees, mine ear"
688,A NYMPHOLEPT,"That hears were stricken to death by the sense divine,"
689,A NYMPHOLEPT,Earth-born I know thee: but heaven is about me here.
690,A NYMPHOLEPT,
691,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The terror that whispers in darkness and flames in light,"
692,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The doubt that speaks in the silence of earth and sea,"
693,A NYMPHOLEPT,"The sense, more fearful at noon than in midmost night,"
694,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Of wrath scarce hushed and of imminent ill to be,"
695,A NYMPHOLEPT,"Where are they? Heaven is as earth, and as heaven to me"
696,A NYMPHOLEPT,Earth: for the shadows that sundered them here take flight;
697,A NYMPHOLEPT,"And nought is all, as am I, but a dream of thee."

1150,VI,"Swelled, lowered, and shrank to feel its conqueror come."
1151,VI,Yet high from heaven its empire vast and vain
1152,VI,"Frowned, and renounced not night's reluctant reign."

1154,VI,"The stainless sea mocks earth and death and sin,"
1155,VI,"Crawls dark as craft, or flashes keen as hate,"
1156,VI,"Subdued and insubmissive, strong like fate"

1159,VI,"That evil everlasting, girt for strife"
1160,VI,"Eternal, wars with hope as death with life."
1161,VI,The dark sharp shifting wind that bade the waves
1162,VI,"Falter, lose heart, bow down like foes made slaves,"
1163,VI,"And waxed within more bitter as they bowed,"
1164,VI,"Baffling the sea, swallowing the sun with cloud,"

1172,VI,And felt its fire shrink shuddering from his feet.
1173,VI,"Far off the darkness darkened, and recoiled,"
1174,VI,"And neared again, and triumphed: and the coiled"
1175,VI,Colourless cloud and sea discoloured grew
1176,VI,"Conscious of horror huge as heaven, and knew"
1177,VI,"Where Goneril's soul made chill and foul the mist,"
1178,VI,And all the leprous life in Regan hissed.
1179,VI,"Fierce homeless ghosts, rejected of the pit,"
1180,VI,From hell to hell of storm fear watched them flit.
1181,VI,"About them and before, the dull grey gloom"

1184,VI,That sullen hell which girt their shades about
1185,VI,The nether soul that lurks and lowers within
1186,VI,"Man, made of dust and fire and shame and sin,"
1187,VI,Breathed: all the cloud that felt it breathe and blight
1188,VI,Was blue as plague or black as thunderous night.
1189,VI,"Elect of hell, the children of his hate"
1190,VI,"Thronged, as to storm sweet heaven's triumphal gate."
1191,VI,The terror of his giving rose and shone
1192,VI,Imminent: life had put its likeness on.
1193,VI,But higher than all its horrent height of shade
1194,VI,"Shone sovereign, seen by light itself had made,"
1195,VI,"Above the woes of all the world, above"
1196,VI,"Life, sin, and death, his myriad-minded love."
1197,VI,From landward heights whereon the radiance leant
1198,VI,"Full-fraught from heaven, intense and imminent,"
1199,VI,To depths wherein the seething strengths of cloud
1200,VI,"Scarce matched the wrath of waves whereon they bowed,"
1201,VI,From homeborn pride and kindling love of home
1202,VI,"To the outer skies and seas of fire and foam,"
1203,VI,From splendour soft as dew that sundawn thrills
1204,VI,"To gloom that shudders round the world it fills,"
1205,VI,From midnights murmuring round Titania's ear
1206,VI,"To midnights maddening round the rage of Lear,"
1207,VI,The wonder woven of storm and sun became
1208,VI,One with the light that lightens from his name.
1209,VI,The music moving on the sea that felt
1210,VI,The storm-wind even as snows of springtide melt
1211,VI,Was blithe as Ariel's hand or voice might make
1212,VI,And bid all grief die gladly for its sake.
1213,VI,And there the soul alive in ear and eye
1214,VI,That watched the wonders of an hour pass by
1215,VI,Saw brighter than all stars that heaven inspheres
1216,VI,"The silent splendour of Cordelia's tears,"
1217,VI,Felt in the whispers of the quickening wind
1218,VI,"The radiance of the laugh of Rosalind,"
1219,VI,"And heard, in sounds that melt the souls of men"
1220,VI,"With love of love, the tune of Imogen."

1228,VII,in reluctant rest.
1229,VII,It hovers and hangs on the labouring and trembling ascent of the
1230,VII,"dawn from the deep,"
1231,VII,"Till the sun's eye quicken the world and the waters, and smite it"
1232,VII,again into sleep.
1233,VII,"Night, holy and starry, the fostress of souls, with the fragrance"
1234,VII,"of heaven in her breath,"
1235,VII,Subdues with the sense of her godhead the forces and mysteries of
1236,VII,sorrow and death.
1237,VII,Eternal as dawn's is the comfort she gives: but the mist that
1238,VII,beleaguers and slays
1239,VII,"Comes, passes, and is not: the strength of it withers, appalled or"
1240,VII,assuaged by the day's.
1241,VII,"Faith, haggard as Fear that had borne her, and dark as the sire"
1242,VII,"that begat her, Despair,"
1243,VII,Held rule on the soul of the world and the song of it saddening
1244,VII,through ages that were;
1245,VII,"Dim centuries that darkened and brightened and darkened again, and"
1246,VII,the soul of their song
1247,VII,"Was great as their grief, and sublime as their suffering, and"
1248,VII,strong as their sorrows were strong.
1249,VII,"It knew not, it saw not, but shadows triune, and evoked by the"
1250,VII,strength of their spell
1251,VII,"Dark hell, and the mountain of anguish, and heaven that was"
1252,VII,hollower and harder than hell.
1253,VII,These are not: the womb of the darkness that bare them rejects
1254,VII,"them, and knows them no more:"
1255,VII,"Thought, fettered in misery and iron, revives in the light that it"
1256,VII,lived in of yore.
1257,VII,"For the soul that is wisdom and freedom, the spirit of England"
1258,VII,"redeemed from her past,"
1259,VII,Speaks life through the lips of the master and lord of her
1260,VII,"children, the first and the last."
1261,VII,"Thought, touched by his hand and redeemed by his breath, sees,"

1311,II,Heaped on high to the sundawn's gate.

1315,II,Now less mighty than time or fate.
1316,II,
1317,II,"The grey sky gleams and the grey seas glimmer,"

1321,II,"The dark wind, stern and sublime and sad,"
1322,II,"Swings the rollers to westward, clad"
1323,II,"With lustrous shadow that lures the swimmer,"
1324,II,Lures and lulls him with dreams of light.
1325,II,
1326,II,"Light, and sleep, and delight, and wonder,"
1327,II,"Change, and rest, and a charm of cloud,"

1330,II,"All the world of the waters, hoary"
1331,II,"Now, but clothed with its own live glory,"
1332,II,That mates the lightning and mocks the thunder
1333,II,With light more living and word more proud.

1338,III,"Far off westward, whither sets the sounding strife,"
1339,III,"Strife more sweet than peace, of shoreless waves whose glee"
1340,III,"Scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free,"
1341,III,"Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life,"
1342,III,Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the sea.
1343,III,
1344,III,"Toward the sunset's goal the sunless waters crowd,"
1345,III,Fast as autumn days toward winter: yet it seems
1346,III,"Here that autumn wanes not, here that woods and streams"
1347,III,"Lose not heart and change not likeness, chilled and bowed,"
1348,III,Warped and wrinkled: here the days are fair as dreams.

1355,IV,"Chill August, pale September,"
1356,IV,"Endured a woful while,"

1366,IV,"With statelier semblance, feigning"

1368,IV,As though the woods thus waning

1372,IV,"By grey December's breath,"
1373,IV,These lordlier growths that sicken

1375,IV,Should feel the sense requicken
1376,IV,That hears what springtide saith
1377,IV,"And thrills for love, spring-stricken"
1378,IV,And pierced with April's breath.
1379,IV,
1380,IV,The keen white-winged north-easter
1381,IV,That stings and spurs thy sea
1382,IV,Doth yet but feed and feast her
1383,IV,With glowing sense of glee:
1384,IV,"Calm chained her, storm released her,"

1398,V,"Soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving"

1418,V,
1419,V,"A dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer"

1529,GRACE DARLING,"Happier, had the surges slain her with her children slain."
1530,GRACE DARLING,"Back they bear, and bring between them safe the woful nine,"

4122,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Hath part in me nor mine:
4123,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Strong lords are these of the living earth
4124,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And loveless lords of thine.
4125,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4126,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""But I that know nor lord nor life"
4127,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"More sure than storm or spray,"
4128,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Whose breath is made of sport and strife,"
4129,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Whereon shall I find stay?"""
4130,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4131,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""And wouldst thou change thy doom with me,"
4132,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Full fain with thee would I:
4133,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,For the life that lightens and lifts the sea
4134,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Is more than earth or sky.
4135,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4136,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""And what if the day of doubt and doom"
4137,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Shall save nor smite not me?
4138,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,I would not rise from the slain world's tomb
4139,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,If there be no more sea.
4140,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4141,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""Take he my soul that gave my soul,"
4142,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And give it thee to keep;
4143,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"And me, while seas and stars shall roll"
4144,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Thy life that falls on sleep."""
4145,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4146,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"That word went up through the mirk mid sky,"
4147,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And even to God's own ear:
4148,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"And the Lord was ware of the keen twin cry,"
4149,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And wroth was he to hear.
4150,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4151,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,He's tane the soul of the unsained child
4152,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,That fled to death from birth;
4153,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"He's tane the light of the wan sea wild,"
4154,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And bid it burn on earth.
4155,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4156,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,He's given the ghaist of the babe new-born
4157,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"The gift of the water-sprite,"
4158,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,To ride on revel from morn to morn
4159,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And roll from night to night.
4160,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4161,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,He's given the sprite of the wild wan sea
4162,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"The gift of the new-born man,"
4163,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,A soul for ever to bide and be
4164,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,When the years have filled their span.
4165,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4166,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"When a year was gone and a year was come,"
4167,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,O loud and loud cried they--
4168,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""For the lee-lang year thou hast held us dumb"
4169,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Take now thy gifts away!"""
4170,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4171,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"O loud and lang they cried on him,"
4172,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And sair and sair they prayed:
4173,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""Is the face of thy grace as the night's face grim"
4174,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"For those thy wrath has made?"""
4175,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4176,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,A cry more bitter than tears of men
4177,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,From the rim of the dim grey sea;--
4178,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""Give me my living soul again,"
4179,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"The soul thou gavest me,"
4180,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"The doom and the dole of kindly men,"
4181,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"To bide my weird and be!"""
4182,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4183,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,A cry more keen from the wild low land
4184,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Than the wail of waves that roll;--
4185,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"""Take back the gift of a loveless hand,"
4186,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Thy gift of doom and dole,"
4187,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The weird of men that bide on land;
4188,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Take from me, take my soul!"""
4189,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4190,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The hands that smite are the hands that spare;
4191,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,They build and break the tomb;
4192,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,They turn to darkness and dust and air
4193,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The fruits of the waste earth's womb;
4194,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"But never the gift of a granted prayer,"
4195,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The dole of a spoken doom.
4196,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4197,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Winds may change at a word unheard,"
4198,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,But none may change the tides:
4199,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The prayer once heard is as God's own word;
4200,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The doom once dealt abides.
4201,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,
4202,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"And ever a cry goes up by day,"
4203,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And ever a wail by night;
4204,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And nae ship comes by the weary bay
4205,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"But her shipmen hear them wail and pray,"
4206,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And see with earthly sight
4207,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,The twofold flames of the twin lights play
4208,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,Where the sea-banks green and the sea-floods grey
4209,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,"Are proud of peril and fain of prey,"
4210,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,And the sand quakes ever; and ill fare they
4211,THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY,That look upon that light.

4224,DEDICATION,"If death be or life be a lie,"
4225,DEDICATION,"Sways hither the spirit and thither,"
4226,DEDICATION,A waif in the swing of the sea
4227,DEDICATION,Whose wrecks are of memories that wither
4228,DEDICATION,As leaves of a tree.
4229,DEDICATION,
4230,DEDICATION,We hear not and hail not with greeting
4231,DEDICATION,"The sound of the wings of the years,"
4232,DEDICATION,"The storm of the sound of them beating,"
4233,DEDICATION,That none till it pass from him hears:
4234,DEDICATION,But tempest nor calm can imperil
4235,DEDICATION,The treasures that fade not or fly;
4236,DEDICATION,"Change bids them not change and be sterile,"
4237,DEDICATION,Death bids them not die.
4238,DEDICATION,
4239,DEDICATION,Hearts plighted in youth to the royal
4240,DEDICATION,"High service of hope and of song,"
4241,DEDICATION,"Sealed fast for endurance as loyal,"
4242,DEDICATION,"And proved of the years as they throng,"
4243,DEDICATION,"Conceive not, believe not, and fear not"
4244,DEDICATION,That age may be other than youth;
4245,DEDICATION,That faith and that friendship may hear not
4246,DEDICATION,And utter not truth.
4247,DEDICATION,
4248,DEDICATION,Not yesterday's light nor to-morrow's
4249,DEDICATION,"Gleams nearer or clearer than gleams,"
4250,DEDICATION,Though joys be forgotten and sorrows
4251,DEDICATION,"Forgotten as changes of dreams,"
4252,DEDICATION,The dawn of the days unforgotten
4253,DEDICATION,"That noon could eclipse not or slay,"
4254,DEDICATION,Whose fruits were as children begotten
4255,DEDICATION,Of dawn upon day.
4256,DEDICATION,
4257,DEDICATION,"The years that were flowerful and fruitless,"
4258,DEDICATION,"The years that were fruitful and dark,"
4259,DEDICATION,"The hopes that were radiant and rootless,"
4260,DEDICATION,"The hopes that were winged for their mark,"
4261,DEDICATION,Lie soft in the sepulchres fashioned
4262,DEDICATION,"Of hours that arise and subside,"
4263,DEDICATION,"Absorbed and subdued and impassioned,"
4264,DEDICATION,In pain or in pride.
4265,DEDICATION,
4266,DEDICATION,But far in the night that entombs them
4267,DEDICATION,"The starshine as sunshine is strong,"
4268,DEDICATION,And clear through the cloud that resumes them

4271,DEDICATION,"As birds that impend on the sea,"
4272,DEDICATION,And thoughts that their prison-house covers
4273,DEDICATION,Arise and are free.
4274,DEDICATION,
4275,DEDICATION,Forgetfulness deep as a prison
4276,DEDICATION,Holds days that are dead for us fast
4277,DEDICATION,Till the sepulchre sees rearisen
4278,DEDICATION,"The spirit whose reign is the past,"
4279,DEDICATION,"Disentrammelled of darkness, and kindled"
4280,DEDICATION,"With life that is mightier than death,"
4281,DEDICATION,When the life that obscured it has dwindled
4282,DEDICATION,And passed as a breath.
4283,DEDICATION,
4284,DEDICATION,But time nor oblivion may darken
4285,DEDICATION,Remembrance whose name will be joy
4286,DEDICATION,"While memory forgets not to hearken,"
4287,DEDICATION,While manhood forgets not the boy
4288,DEDICATION,Who heard and exulted in hearing
4289,DEDICATION,The songs of the sunrise of youth

4292,DEDICATION,
4293,DEDICATION,"Truth, winged and enkindled with rapture"
4294,DEDICATION,"And sense of the radiance of yore,"

4296,DEDICATION,What never might singer before--
4297,DEDICATION,"The life, the delight, and the sorrow"
4298,DEDICATION,Of troublous and chivalrous years
4299,DEDICATION,"That knew not of night or of morrow,"
4300,DEDICATION,Of hopes or of fears.
4301,DEDICATION,
4302,DEDICATION,But wider the wing and the vision
4303,DEDICATION,That quicken the spirit have spread
4304,DEDICATION,Since memory beheld with derision
4305,DEDICATION,Man's hope to be more than his dead.
4306,DEDICATION,From the mists and the snows and the thunders
4307,DEDICATION,Your spirit has brought for us forth
4308,DEDICATION,"Light, music, and joy in the wonders"
4309,DEDICATION,And charms of the north.
4310,DEDICATION,
4311,DEDICATION,The wars and the woes and the glories
4312,DEDICATION,That quicken and lighten and rain
4313,DEDICATION,"From the clouds of its chronicled stories,"
4314,DEDICATION,"The passion, the pride, and the pain,"
4315,DEDICATION,Whose echoes were mute and the token
4316,DEDICATION,"Was lost of the spells that they spake,"
4317,DEDICATION,"Rise bright at your bidding, unbroken"
4318,DEDICATION,Of ages that break.
4319,DEDICATION,
4320,DEDICATION,"For you, and for none of us other,"
4321,DEDICATION,Time is not: the dead that must live
4322,DEDICATION,Hold commune with you as a brother
4323,DEDICATION,By grace of the life that you give.
4324,DEDICATION,"The heart that was in them is in you,"
4325,DEDICATION,Their soul in your spirit endures:
4326,DEDICATION,The strength of their song is the sinew
4327,DEDICATION,Of this that is yours.
4328,DEDICATION,
4329,DEDICATION,"Hence is it that life, everlasting"
4330,DEDICATION,"As light and as music, abides"
4331,DEDICATION,"In the sound of the surge of it, casting"
4332,DEDICATION,"Sound back to the surge of the tides,"
4333,DEDICATION,Till sons of the sons of the Norsemen
4334,DEDICATION,"Watch, hurtling to windward and lee,"
