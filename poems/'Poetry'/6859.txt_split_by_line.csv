79,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,In the Factory
80,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
81,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
82,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Oh, here in the shop the machines roar so wildly,"
83,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"That oft, unaware that I am, or have been,"
84,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I sink and am lost in the terrible tumult;
85,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And void is my soul... I am but a machine.
86,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I work and I work and I work, never ceasing;"
87,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Create and create things from morning till e'en;
88,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"For what?--and for whom--Oh, I know not! Oh, ask not!"
89,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Who ever has heard of a conscious machine?
90,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
91,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"No, here is no feeling, no thought and no reason;"
92,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,This life-crushing labor has ever supprest
93,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The noblest and finest, the truest and richest,"
94,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The deepest, the highest and humanly best."
95,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The seconds, the minutes, they pass out forever,"
96,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"They vanish, swift fleeting like straws in a gale."
97,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I drive the wheel madly as tho' to o'ertake them,--"
98,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Give chase without wisdom, or wit, or avail."
99,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
100,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The clock in the workshop,--it rests not a moment;"
101,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"It points on, and ticks on: Eternity--Time;"
102,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And once someone told me the clock had a meaning,--"
103,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Its pointing and ticking had reason and rhyme.
104,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And this too he told me,--or had I been dreaming,--"
105,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The clock wakened life in one, forces unseen,"
106,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And something besides;... I forget what; Oh, ask not!"
107,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I know not, I know not, I am a machine."
108,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
109,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"At times, when I listen, I hear the clock plainly;--"
110,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The reason of old--the old meaning--is gone!
111,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The maddening pendulum urges me forward
112,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,To labor and labor and still labor on.
113,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The tick of the clock is the Boss in his anger!
114,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The face of the clock has the eyes of a foe;
115,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The clock--Oh, I shudder--dost hear how it drives me?"
116,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"It calls me ""Machine!"" and it cries to me ""Sew!"""
117,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
118,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"At noon, when about me the wild tumult ceases,"
119,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And gone is the master, and I sit apart,"
120,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And dawn in my brain is beginning to glimmer,"
121,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The wound comes agape at the core of my heart;
122,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And tears, bitter tears flow; ay, tears that are scalding;"
123,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,They moisten my dinner--my dry crust of bread;
124,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"They choke me,--I cannot eat;--no, no, I cannot!"
125,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Oh, horrible toil I born of Need and of Dread."
126,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
127,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The sweatshop at mid-day--I'll draw you the picture:
128,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A battlefield bloody; the conflict at rest;
129,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Around and about me the corpses are lying;
130,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The blood cries aloud from the earth's gory breast.
131,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"A moment... and hark! The loud signal is sounded,"
132,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The dead rise again and renewed is the fight...
133,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"They struggle, these corpses; for strangers, for strangers!"
134,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"They struggle, they fall, and they sink into night."
135,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
136,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I gaze on the battle in bitterest anger,"
137,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And pain, hellish pain wakes the rebel in me!"
138,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The clock--now I hear it aright!--It is crying:
139,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""An end to this bondage! An end there must be!"""
140,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"It quickens my reason, each feeling within me;"
141,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,It shows me how precious the moments that fly.
142,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Oh, worthless my life if I longer am silent,"
143,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And lost to the world if in silence I die.
144,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
145,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The man in me sleeping begins to awaken;
146,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The thing that was slave into slumber has passed:
147,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Now; up with the man in me! Up and be doing!
148,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,No misery more! Here is freedom at last!
149,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,When sudden: a whistle!--the Boss--an alarum!--
150,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I sink in the slime of the stagnant routine;--
151,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"There's tumult, they struggle, oh, lost is my ego;--"
152,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I know not, I care not, I am a machine!..."
153,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
154,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
155,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
156,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
157,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,My Boy
158,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
159,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
160,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I have a little boy at home,"
161,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A pretty little son;
162,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I think sometimes the world is mine
163,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"In him, my only one."
164,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
165,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"But seldom, seldom do I see"
166,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,My child in heaven's light;
167,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I find him always fast asleep...
168,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I see him but at night.
169,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
170,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Ere dawn my labor drives me forth;
171,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,'Tis night when I am free;
172,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A stranger am I to my child;
173,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And strange my child to me.
174,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
175,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I come in darkness to my home,"
176,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,With weariness and--pay;
177,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"My pallid wife, she waits to tell"
178,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The things he learned to say.
179,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
180,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,How plain and prettily he asked:
181,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""Dear mamma, when's 'Tonight'?"
182,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,O when will come my dear papa
183,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And bring a penny bright?"""
184,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
185,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I hear her words--I hasten out--
186,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,This moment must it be!--
187,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The father-love flames in my breast:
188,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,My child must look at me!
189,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
190,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I stand beside the tiny cot,"
191,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"And look, and list, and--ah!"
192,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A dream-thought moves the baby-lips:
193,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""O, where is my papa!"""
194,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
195,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I kiss and kiss the shut blue eyes;
196,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I kiss them not in vain.
197,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"They open,--O they see me then!"
198,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And straightway close again.
199,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
200,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""Here's your papa, my precious one;--"
201,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"A penny for you!""--ah!"
202,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A dream still moves the baby-lips:
203,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""O, where is my papa!"""
204,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
205,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And I--I think in bitterness
206,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And disappointment sore;
207,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"""Some day you will awake, my child,"
208,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"To find me nevermore."""
209,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
210,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
211,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
212,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
213,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The Nightingale to the Workman
214,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
215,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
216,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Fair summer is here, glad summer is here!"
217,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,O hark! 'tis to you I am singing:
218,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The sun is all gold in a heaven of blue,"
219,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The birds in the forest are trilling for you,"
220,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The flies 'mid the grasses are winging;
221,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The little brook babbles--its secret is sweet.
222,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The loveliest flowers would circle your feet,--"
223,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And you to your work ever clinging!...
224,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Come forth! Nature loves you. Come forth! Do not fear!
225,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Fair summer is here, glad summer is here,"
226,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Full measure of happiness bringing.
227,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,All creatures drink deep; and they pour wine anew
228,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"In the old cup of life, and they wonder at you."
229,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Your portion is waiting since summer began;
230,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Then take it, oh, take it, you laboring man!"
231,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
232,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"'Tis summer today; ay, summer today!"
233,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The butterflies light on the flowers.
234,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Delightfully glistens the silvery rain,"
235,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The mountains are covered with greenness again,"
236,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And perfumed and cool are the bowers.
237,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The sheep frisk about in the flowery vale,"
238,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The shepherd and shepherdess pause in the dale,"
239,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And these are the holiest hours!...
240,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Delay not, delay not, life passes away!"
241,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"'Tis summer today, sweet summer today!"
242,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Come, throttle your wheel's grinding power!..."
243,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Your worktime is bitter and endless in length;
244,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And have you not foolishly lavished your strength?
245,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"O think not the world is with bitterness rife,"
246,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,But drink of the wine from the goblet of life.
247,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
248,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"O, summer is here, sweet summer is here!"
249,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I cannot forever be trilling;
250,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I flee on the morrow. Then, you, have a care!"
251,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The crow, from the perch I am leaving, the air"
252,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,With ominous cries will be filling.
253,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"O, while I am singing to you from my tree"
254,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Of love, and of life, and of joy yet to be,"
255,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Arouse you!--O why so unwilling!...
256,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The heavens remain not so blue and so clear;--
257,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Now summer is here! Come, summer is here!"
258,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Reach out for the joys that are thrilling!
259,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"For like you who fade at your wheel, day by day,"
260,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Soon all things will fade and be carried away.
261,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Our lives are but moments; and sometimes the cost
262,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Of a moment o'erlooked is eternity lost.
263,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
264,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
265,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
266,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
267,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,What is the World?
268,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
269,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
270,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Well, say you the world is a chamber of sleep,"
271,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And life but a sleeping and dreaming?
272,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Then I too would dream: and would joyously reap
273,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The blooms of harmonious seeming;
274,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The dream-flow'rs of hope and of freedom, perchance,"
275,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The rich are so merrily reaping;--
276,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,In Love's eyes I'd fancy the joy of romance;
277,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,No more would I dream Love is weeping.
278,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
279,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Or say you the world is a banquet, a ball,"
280,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Where everyone goes who is able?
281,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I too wish to sit like a lord in the hall
282,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,With savory share at the table.
283,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I too can enjoy what is wholesome and good,"
284,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,A morsel both dainty and healthy;
285,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I have in my body the same sort of blood
286,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,That flows in the veins of the wealthy.
287,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
288,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"A garden you say is the world, where abound"
289,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The sweetest and loveliest roses?
290,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Then would I, no leave asking, saunter around"
291,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And gather me handfuls of posies.
292,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Of thorns I am sure I would make me no wreath;
293,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,(Of flowers I am very much fonder).
294,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And with my beloved the bowers beneath
295,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I'd wander, and wander, and wander."
296,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
297,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"But ah! if the world is a battlefield wild,"
298,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Where struggle the weak with the stronger,"
299,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Then heed I no storm and no wife and no child!--
300,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,I stand in abeyance no longer;--
301,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Rush into the fire of the battle nor yield,"
302,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And fight for my perishing brother;
303,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Well, if I am struck--I can die on the field;"
304,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Die gladly as well as another....
305,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
306,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
307,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
308,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
309,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Despair
310,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
311,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
312,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,No rest--not one day in the seven for me?
313,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Not one, from the maddening yoke to be free?"
314,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Not one to escape from the boss on the prowl,"
315,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"His sinister glance and his furious growl,"
316,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The cry of the foreman, the smell of the shop,--"
317,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,To feel for one moment the manacles drop?
318,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"--_'Tis rest then you want, and you fain would forget?"
319,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,To rest and oblivion they'll carry you yet._
320,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
321,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The flow'rs and the trees will have withered ere long,"
322,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The last bird already is ending his song;
323,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And soon will be leafless and shadeless the bow'rs...
324,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I long, oh I long for the perfume of flow'rs!"
325,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"To feel for a moment ere stripped are the trees,"
326,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"In meadow lands open, the breath of the breeze."
327,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,--_You long for the meadow lands breezy and fair?
328,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"O, soon enough others will carry you there._"
329,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
330,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The rivulet sparkles with heavenly light,"
331,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The wavelets they glisten, with diamonds bedight."
332,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Oh, but for a moment to leap in the stream,"
333,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And play in the waters that ripple and gleam!
334,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,My body is weakened with terrible toil.--
335,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The bath would refresh me, renew me the while."
336,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,--_You dream of a bath in the shimmering stream?
337,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,'Twill come--when forever is ended your dream._
338,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
339,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The sweatshop is smoky and gloomy and mean--
340,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I strive--oh, how vainly I strive to be clean!"
341,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,All day I am covered with grime and with dirt.
342,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"You'd laugh,--but I long for a spotless white shirt!"
343,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"For life that is noble, 'tis needful, I ween,"
344,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,To work as a man should; and still be as clean.
345,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,--_So now 'tis your wish all in white to be dressed?
346,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"In white they will robe you, and lay you to rest._"
347,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
348,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The woods they are cool, and the woods they are free;--"
349,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"To dream and to wander, how sweet it would be!"
350,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The birds their eternal glad holiday keep;
351,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,With song that enchants you and lulls you to sleep.
352,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"'Tis hot here,--and close! and the din will not cease."
353,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I long for the forest, its coolth and its peace."
354,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"--_Ay, cool you will soon be; and not only cool,"
355,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"But cold as no forest can make you, O Fool!_"
356,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
357,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"I long for a friend who will comfort and cheer,"
358,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And fill me with courage when sorrow is near;
359,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"A comrade, of treasures the rarest and best,"
360,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Who gives to existence its crown and its crest;
361,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,And I am an orphan--and I am alone;
362,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,No friend or companion to call me his own.
363,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,--_Companions a-plenty--they're numberless too;
364,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,They're swarming already and waiting for you._
365,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
366,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
367,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
368,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
369,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Whither?
370,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
371,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,(To a Young Girl)
372,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
373,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,
374,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Say whither, whither, pretty one?"
375,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The hour is young at present!
376,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,How hushed is all the world around!
377,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Ere dawn--the streets hold not a sound.
378,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"O whither, whither do you run?"
379,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,Sleep at this hour is pleasant.
380,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"The flowers are dreaming, dewy-wet;"
381,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,The bird-nests they are silent yet.
382,SONGS OF LABOR AND OTHER POEMS,"Where to, before the rising sun"

777,II,"Thy still woof, Eternity!"
778,II,
779,II,"Gloomy thoughts in me awaken,"
780,II,"And with fear my breast is shaken,"
781,II,Thinking: O thou black abyss;
782,II,"All the toil and thrift of life,"
783,II,"All the struggle and the strife,"
784,II,Shall it come at last to this?
785,II,
786,II,With the grave shall be requited
787,II,"Good and evil, and united"
788,II,Ne'er to separate again?
789,II,"What the light hath parted purely,"
790,II,Shall the darkness join more surely?--
791,II,Was the vict'ry won in vain?
792,II,
793,II,"O mute and infinite extension,"
794,II,"O time beyond our comprehension,"
795,II,Shall thought and deed ungarnered fall?
796,II,"Ev'rything dost take and slay,"
797,II,"Ev'rything dost bear away,"
798,II,"Silent Nothing, silent All!..."

803,II,The Canary
804,II,
805,II,
806,II,The free canary warbles
807,II,In leafy forest dell:
808,II,"Who feels what rapture thrills her,"
809,II,And who her joy can tell?
810,II,
811,II,The sweet canary warbles
812,II,Where wealth and splendor dwell:
813,II,"Who knows what sorrow moves her,"
814,II,And who her pain can tell?
815,II,
816,II,
817,II,
818,II,
819,II,Want And I
820,II,
821,II,
822,II,Who's there? who's there? who was it tried
823,II,To force the entrance I've denied?
824,II,"An 'twere a friend, I'd gladly borne it,"
825,II,But no--'twas Want! I could have sworn it.
826,II,"I heard thy voice, old witch, I know thee!"
827,II,"Avaunt, thou evil hag, beshrew thee!"
828,II,God's curse! why seekest thou to find me?
829,II,Away to all black years behind me!
830,II,
831,II,"To torture me was thine endeavor,"
832,II,"My body from my soul to sever,"
833,II,"Of pride and courage to deprive me,"
834,II,And into beggary to drive me.
835,II,"Begone, where thousand devils burn--"
836,II,"Begone, nor evermore return!"
837,II,"Begone, most wretched thou of creatures,"
838,II,And hide for aye thine hateful features!
839,II,"--Beloved, ope the door in pity!"
840,II,
841,II,No friend have I in all the city
842,II,"Save thee, then open to my call!"
843,II,"The night is bleak, the snowflakes fall."
844,II,"Thine own, old Want am I, believe me!"
845,II,"Ah, what delight, wilt thou receive me?"
846,II,"I found, when I from thee had parted,"
847,II,No friend but he was fickle-hearted!
848,II,
849,II,"Away, old hag! Thou liest, lo,"
850,II,Thou harbinger of pain and woe!
851,II,Away--am I thine only friend?
852,II,"Thy lovers pale, they have no end!"
853,II,"Thou vile one, may the devil take thee!"
854,II,Begone and no more visits make me!
855,II,For--Yiddish writers not to mention--
856,II,Men hold thee no such rare invention.
857,II,
858,II,--'Tis true! yet those must wait my leisure.
859,II,To be with thee is now my pleasure.
860,II,"I love thy black and curling hair,"
861,II,"I love thy wounded heart's despair,"
862,II,"I love thy sighs, I love to swallow"
863,II,Thy tears and all thy songs to follow.
864,II,"Oh great indeed, might I but show it,"
865,II,"My love for thee, my pale-faced poet!"
866,II,
867,II,"Away, I've heard all that before,"
868,II,"And am a writer, mark, no more."
869,II,"Instead of verses, wares I tell,"
870,II,And candy and tobacco sell.
871,II,"My life is sweet, my life is bitter."
872,II,I'm ready and a prompt acquitter.
873,II,"Oh, smarter traders there are many,"
874,II,Yet live I well and turn a penny.
875,II,
876,II,"--A dealer then wilt thou remain,"
877,II,Forever from the pen abstain?
878,II,Good resolutions time disperses:
879,II,"Thou yet shalt hunger o'er thy verses,"
880,II,But vainly seeking to excuse thee
881,II,"Because thou dost, tonight, refuse me."
882,II,"Then open, fool, I tell thee plain,"
883,II,That we perforce shall meet again.
884,II,
885,II,Begone the way that I direct thee!
886,II,I've millionaires now to protect me;
887,II,"No need to beg, no need to borrow,"
888,II,"Nor fear a penniless tomorrow,"
889,II,Nor walk with face of blackest omen
890,II,"To thrill the hearts of stupid foemen,"
891,II,"Who fain my pride to earth would bring,"
892,II,"Because, forsooth, I sweetly sing!"
893,II,
894,II,"--Ho ho! ere thou art grown much older,"
895,II,Thy millionaires will all grow colder.
896,II,Thou soon shalt be forgotten by them--
897,II,They've other things to occupy them!
898,II,"Just now with thee they're playing kindly,"
899,II,But fortune's wheel is turning blindly
900,II,To grind thy pleasures ere thou know it--
901,II,"And thou art left to me, my poet!"

907,II,
908,II,
909,II,"Now the last, long rays of sunset"
910,II,"To the tree-tops are ascending,"
911,II,And the ash-gray evening shadows
912,II,Weave themselves around the earth.
913,II,
914,II,"On the crest of yonder mountain,"
915,II,Now are seen from out the distance
916,II,Slowly fading crimson traces;
917,II,Footprints of the dying day.
918,II,
919,II,"Blood-stained banners, torn and tattered,"
920,II,"Hanging in the western corner,"
921,II,Dip their parched and burning edges
922,II,In the cooling ocean wave.
923,II,
924,II,Smoothly roll the crystal wavelets
925,II,"Through the dusky veils of twilight,"
926,II,That are trembling down from heaven
927,II,O'er the bosom of the sea.
928,II,
929,II,Soft a little wind is blowing
930,II,O'er the gently rippling waters--
931,II,"What they whisper, what they murmur,"
932,II,Who is wise enough to say?
933,II,
934,II,Broad her snow-white sails outspreading
935,II,"'Gainst the quiet sky of evening,"
936,II,"Flies a ship without a sailor,"
937,II,"Flies--and whither, who can tell?"
938,II,
939,II,As by magic moves the rudder;
940,II,Borne upon her snowy pinions
941,II,Flies the ship--as tho' a spirit
942,II,Drove her onward at its will!
943,II,
944,II,"Empty is she, and deserted,"
945,II,Only close beside the mainmast
946,II,"Stands a lonely child, heartbroken,"
947,II,Sobbing loud and bitterly.
948,II,
949,II,Long and golden curls are falling
950,II,Down his neck and o'er his shoulders;
951,II,"Now he glances backward sighing,"
952,II,And the silent ship flies on!
953,II,
954,II,"With a little, shining kerchief,"
955,II,"Fluttering upon the breezes,"
956,II,"Unto me he sends a greeting,"
957,II,From afar he waves farewell.
958,II,
959,II,"And my heart is throbbing wildly,"
960,II,I am weeping--tell me wherefore?
961,II,"God! that lovely child, I know him!"
962,II,'Tis my youth that flies from me!

968,II,
969,II,
970,II,"O Misery of mine, no other"
971,II,"In faithfulness can match with thee,"
972,II,"Thou more than friend, and more than brother,"
973,II,The only thing that cares for me!
974,II,
975,II,"Where'er I turn, are unkind faces,"
976,II,"And hate and treachery and guile,"
977,II,"Thou, Mis'ry, in all times and places,"
978,II,Dost greet me with thy pallid smile.
979,II,
980,II,"At birth I found thee waiting for me,"
981,II,"I knew thee in my cradle first,"
982,II,"The same small eyes and dim watched o'er me,"
983,II,"The same dry, bony fingers nursed."
984,II,
985,II,"And day by day when morning lightened,"
986,II,"To school thou led'st me--home did'st bring,"
987,II,And thine were all the blooms that brightened
988,II,The chilly landscape of my spring.
989,II,
990,II,"And, thou my match and marriage monger,"
991,II,The marriage deed by thee was read;
992,II,The hands foretelling need and hunger
993,II,Were laid in blessing on my head.
994,II,
995,II,"Thy love for me shall last unshaken,"
996,II,"No further proof I ask, for when"
997,II,"My hopes for aye were from me taken,"
998,II,"My Mis'ry, thou wert with me then;"
999,II,
1000,II,"And still, while sorrow's storm is breaking"
1001,II,"Above me, and my head I bow--"
1002,II,"The kindly and the unforsaking,"
1003,II,"Oh Mis'ry, thou art with me now."
1004,II,
1005,II,"Ay, still from out Fate's gloomy towers"
1006,II,"I see thee come to me again,"
1007,II,"With wreaths of everlasting flowers,"
1008,II,And songs funereal in thy train.
1009,II,
1010,II,"And when life's curses rock me nightly,"
1011,II,"And hushed I lie in slumber's hold,"
1012,II,Thy sable form comes treading lightly
1013,II,To wrap me in its garments fold.
1014,II,
1015,II,"Thy brother let me be, and wholly"
1016,II,"Repay thee all I owe, tho' late:"
1017,II,"My aching heart, my melancholy,"
1018,II,My songs to thee I dedicate.

1023,II,O Long The Way
1024,II,
1025,II,
1026,II,"O long the way and short the day,"
1027,II,"No light in tower or town,"
1028,II,The waters roar and far the shore--
1029,II,"My ship, my ship goes down!"
1030,II,
1031,II,"'Tis all in vain to strive again,"
1032,II,"My cry the billows drown,"
1033,II,"The fight is done, the wind has won--"
1034,II,"My ship, my ship goes down!"
1035,II,
1036,II,"Bright sun, adieu! Thou'lt shine anew"
1037,II,"When skies no longer frown,"
1038,II,But I--the deafening billows crash--
1039,II,"My ship, my ship goes down!"

1048,II,"O shadow-hunters pitiless,"
1049,II,"Why then so eager, say!"
1050,II,"What'er you leave the grave will take,"
1051,II,"And all you gain and all you make,"
1052,II,It will not last a day!
1053,II,
1054,II,"Full soon will come the Reaper Black,"
1055,II,Cut thorns and flowers mark his track
1056,II,Across Life's meadow blithe.
1057,II,"Oppose him, meet him as you will,"
1058,II,"Old Time's behests he harkens still,"
1059,II,Unsparing wields his scythe.
1060,II,
1061,II,A horrid mutiny by stealth
1062,II,"Breaks out,--of power, fame and wealth"
1063,II,Deserted you shall be!
1064,II,The foam upon your lip is rife;
1065,II,The last enigma now of Life
1066,II,Shall Death resolve for thee.
1067,II,
1068,II,You call for help--'tis all in vain!
1069,II,"What have you for your toil and pain,"
1070,II,What have you at the last?
1071,II,"Poor luckless hunter, are you dumb?"
1072,II,This way the cold pall-bearers come:
1073,II,A beggar's soul has passed!
1074,II,
1075,II,"A little less, a little more !--"
1076,II,"Look forth, look forth! without the door"
1077,II,There stands a robber old.
1078,II,"He'll force your ev'ry lock and spring,"
1079,II,And all your goods he'll take and fling
1080,II,On Stygian waters cold.

1090,II,"Come, and there my soul will open"
1091,II,Secret doors to thee.
1092,II,Yonder shalt thou learn the secrets
1093,II,"Deep within my breast,"
1094,II,Where my love upsprings eternal;
1095,II,"Come! with pain opprest,"
1096,II,"Yonder all the truth I'll tell thee,"
1097,II,Tell it thee with tears...
1098,II,"(Ah, so long have we been parted,"
1099,II,"Years of youth, sweet years!)"
1100,II,
1101,II,See'st thou the dancers floating
1102,II,On a stream of sound?
1103,II,"There alone, the soul entrancing,"
1104,II,Happiness is found!
1105,II,"Magic music, hark! it calls us,"
1106,II,Ringing wild and sweet!
1107,II,"One, two, three!--beloved, haste thee,"
1108,II,Point thy dainty feet!
1109,II,Now at last I feel that living
1110,II,Is no foolish jest...
1111,II,"(O sweet years of youth departed,"
1112,II,Vanished with the rest!)
1113,II,
1114,II,"Fiddler, play a little longer!"
1115,II,"Why this hurry, say?"
1116,II,I'm but half-way through a measure--
1117,II,Yet a little play!
1118,II,Smiling in her wreath of flowers
1119,II,Is my love not fair?
1120,II,"See us in the charmed circle,"
1121,II,Flitting light as air!
1122,II,"Haste thee, loved one, for the music"
1123,II,Shall be hushed anon...
1124,II,"(O sweet years of youth departed,"
1125,II,Whither are ye gone?)
1126,II,
1127,II,"Gracious youth of mine, so quickly"
1128,II,Hath it come to this?
1129,II,"Lo, where flowed the golden river,"
1130,II,Yawns the black abyss!
1131,II,"Where, oh where is my beloved,"
1132,II,Where the wreath of flowers?
1133,II,"Where, oh where the merry fiddler,"
1134,II,Where those happy hours?
1135,II,Shall I never hear the echoes
1136,II,Of those songs again?
1137,II,"Oh, on what hills are they ringing,"
1138,II,O'er what sunny plain?
1139,II,May not I from out the distance
1140,II,Cast one backward glance
1141,II,"On that fair and lost existence,"
1142,II,Youth's sweet dalliance?
1143,II,"Foolish dreamer! Time hath snatched it,"
1144,II,"And, tho' man implore,"
1145,II,Joys that _he_ hath reaped and garnered
1146,II,Bloom again no more!

1152,II,
1153,II,
1154,II,"Alone in desert dreary,"
1155,II,A bird with folded wings
1156,II,"Beholds the waste about her,"
1157,II,"And sweetly, sweetly sings."
1158,II,
1159,II,"So heaven-sweet her singing,"
1160,II,"So clear the bird notes flow,"
1161,II,"'Twould seem the rocks must waken,"
1162,II,The desert vibrant grow.
1163,II,
1164,II,Dead rocks and silent mountains
1165,II,"Would'st waken with thy strain,--"
1166,II,"But dumb are still the mountains,"
1167,II,And dead the rocks remain.
1168,II,
1169,II,"For whom, O heavenly singer,"
1170,II,Thy song so clear and free?
1171,II,"Who hears or sees or heeds thee,"
1172,II,Who feels or cares for thee?
1173,II,
1174,II,Thou may'st outpour in music
1175,II,Thy very soul... 'Twere vain!
1176,II,In stone thou canst not waken
1177,II,A throb of joy or pain.
1178,II,
1179,II,Thy song shall soon be silenced;
1180,II,I feel it... For I know
1181,II,Thy heart is near to bursting
1182,II,With loneliness and woe.
1183,II,
1184,II,"Ah, vain is thine endeavor;"
1185,II,It naught availeth--nay;
1186,II,"For lonely as thou camest,"
1187,II,So shalt thou pass away.

1194,II,
1195,II,"I've often laughed and oftener still have wept,"
1196,II,"A sighing always through my laughter crept,"
1197,II,Tears were not far away...
1198,II,What is there to say?
1199,II,
1200,II,"I've spoken much and oftener held by tongue,"
1201,II,For still the most was neither said nor sung.
1202,II,Could I but tell it so...
1203,II,What is there to know?
1204,II,
1205,II,"I've hated much and loved, oh so much more!"
1206,II,Fierce contrasts at my very heartstrings tore...
1207,II,I tried to fight them--well...
1208,II,What is there to tell?

1211,II,

1217,II,Now the spell is broken;
1218,II,"Brothers, yet again I bring thee"
1219,II,Songs of love the token.
1220,II,Of my joy and of my sorrow
1221,II,"Gladly, sadly bringing;--"
1222,II,Summer not a song would borrow--
1223,II,Winter sets me singing.
1224,II,
1225,II,"O when life turns sad and lonely,"
1226,II,When our joys are dead;
1227,II,When are heard the ravens only
1228,II,In the trees o'erhead;
1229,II,When the stormwind on the bowers
1230,II,"Wreaks its wicked will,"
1231,II,"When the frost paints lying flowers,"
1232,II,How should I be still?
1233,II,
1234,II,"When the clouds are low descending,"
1235,II,And the sun is drowned;
1236,II,"When the winter knows no ending,"
1237,II,And the cold is crowned;
1238,II,When with evil gloom oppressed
1239,II,Lie the ruins bare;
1240,II,"When a sigh escapes the breast,"
1241,II,Takes us unaware;
1242,II,
1243,II,When the snow-wrapped mountain dreams
1244,II,"Of its summer gladness,"
1245,II,When the wood is stripped and seems
1246,II,Full of care and sadness;
1247,II,When the songs are growing still
1248,II,"As in Death's repose,"
1249,II,"And the heart is growing chill,"
1250,II,And the eyelids close;
1251,II,
1252,II,"Then, O then I can but sing"
1253,II,For I dream her coming--
1254,II,"May, sweet May! I see her bring"
1255,II,Buds and wild-bee humming!
1256,II,"Through the silence heart-appalling,"
1257,II,"As I stand and listen,"
1258,II,"I can hear her song-birds calling,"
1259,II,See her green leaves glisten!
1260,II,
1261,II,"Thus again my songs I sing thee,"
1262,II,Now the spell is broken;
1263,II,"Brothers, yet again I bring thee"
1264,II,Of my love the token.
1265,II,Of my joy and of my sorrow
1266,II,"Gladly, sadly bringing,--"
1267,II,Summer not a song would borrow!--
1268,II,Winter sets me singing.
1269,II,

1271,II,
1272,II,
1273,II,Liberty
1274,II,
1275,II,
1276,II,When night and silence deep
1277,II,"Hold all the world in sleep,"
1278,II,"As tho' Death claimed the Hour,"
1279,II,By some strange witchery
1280,II,"Appears her form to me,"
1281,II,As tho' Magic were her dow'r.
1282,II,
1283,II,Her beauty heaven's light!
1284,II,Her bosom snowy white!
1285,II,But pale her cheek appears.
1286,II,Her shoulders firm and fair;
1287,II,A mass of gold her hair.
1288,II,Her eyes--the home of tears.
1289,II,
1290,II,She looks at me nor speaks.
1291,II,Her arms are raised; she seeks
1292,II,Her fettered hands to show.
1293,II,On both white wrists a chain!--
1294,II,She cries and pleads in pain:
1295,II,"""Unbind me!--Let me go!"""
1296,II,
1297,II,"I burn with bitter ire,"
1298,II,I leap in wild desire
1299,II,The cruel bonds to break;
1300,II,But God! around the chain
1301,II,Is coiled and coiled again

1838,II,"In Jewish delight, what is worthy the name?"
1839,II,"The laugh of a Jew! It is never a right one,"
1840,II,For laughing and groaning with him are the same.

1857,II,"Bewildered and homeless, of whom whoso passes"
1858,II,"May fearlessly stop to make sport at his ease,--"

1860,II,For him to be thinking on meadows and trees?
1861,II,
1862,II,"And if for a moment, forgetting to ponder"
1863,II,"On grief and oppression, song breaks out anew,"

1868,II,"In metre and measure, whenever he hears"

1871,II,
1872,II,"The blast of the Ram's-horn that quavers and trembles,--"
1873,II,"On this, now, alone Jewish fancy is bent."
1874,II,"To grief and contrition its host it assembles,"
1875,II,And causes the stoniest heart to relent.
1876,II,
1877,II,"The wail that went up when the Temple was shattered,--"

1882,II,"Of all the sweet instruments, shiver'd and broken,"
1883,II,"That once in the Temple delighted his ear,"
1884,II,"The Ram's-horn alone has he kept, as a token,"
1885,II,And sobs out his soul on it once in the year.
1886,II,
1887,II,"Instead of the harp and the viol and cymbal,"
1888,II,"Instead of the lyre, the guitar and the flute,"
1889,II,"He has but the dry, wither'd Ram's-horn, the symbol"
1890,II,Of gloom and despondence; the rest all are mute.
1891,II,
1892,II,"He laughs, or he breaks into song, but soon after,"
1893,II,"Tho' fain would he take in man's gladness a part,"
1894,II,"One hears, low resounding athwart the gay laughter,"
1895,II,"The Suppliant's psalm, and it pierces the heart."
