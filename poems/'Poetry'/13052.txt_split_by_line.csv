71,I.,I.
72,I.,
73,I.,A fluttering bevy left the gate
74,I.,"With hurried steps, and sped away;"
75,I.,"And then a coach with drooping freight,"
76,I.,"Wrapped in its film of dusty gray,"
77,I.,Stopped; and the pastor and his mate
78,I.,
79,I.,"Stepped forth, and passed the waiting door,"
80,I.,And closed it on the gazing street.
81,I.,"""Oh Philip!""  She could say no more."
82,I.,"""Oh Mildred!  You're at home, my sweet,--"
83,I.,"The old life closed: the new before!"""
84,I.,
85,I.,"""Dinah, the mistress!""  And the maid,"
86,I.,Grown motherly with household care
87,I.,"And loving service, and arrayed"
88,I.,"In homely neatness, took the pair"
89,I.,"Of small gloved hands held out, and paid"
90,I.,
91,I.,"Her low obeisance; then--""this way!"""
92,I.,"And when she brought her forth at last,"
93,I.,"To him who grudged the long delay,"
94,I.,"He found the soil of travel cast,"
95,I.,And Mildred fresh and fair as May.
96,I.,
97,I.,
98,I.,
99,II,II
100,II,
101,II,"""This is our little Manse,"" he said."
102,II,"""Now look with both your curious eyes"
103,II,"Around, above and overhead,"
104,II,"And seeing all things, realize"
105,II,"That they are ours, and we are wed!"
106,II,
107,II,"""Walk through these freshly garnished rooms--"
108,II,These halls of oak and tinted pearl--
109,II,"And mark the cups of clover-blooms,"
110,II,"Cut fresh, to greet the stranger-girl,"
111,II,By those whose kindliness illumes
112,II,
113,II,The house beyond the grace of flowers!
114,II,"They greet you, mantled by my name,"
115,II,"And rain their tenderness in showers,--"
116,II,Responding to the double claim
117,II,"Of love no longer mine, but ours."
118,II,
119,II,"""This is our parlor, plain and sweet:"
120,II,Your hands shall make it half divine.
121,II,"That wide, old-fashioned window-seat"
122,II,Beneath your touch shall grow a shrine;
123,II,"And every nooklet and retreat,"
124,II,
125,II,"And every barren ledge and shelf,"
126,II,Shall wear a charm beyond the boon
127,II,"Of treasure-bearing drift, or delf,"
128,II,Or dreams that flutter from the moon;
129,II,For it shall blossom with yourself.
130,II,
131,II,"""This is my study: here, alone,"
132,II,"Prayerful to Him whom I adore,"
133,II,"And gathering speech to make him known,"
134,II,"Your far, quick footsteps on the floor,"
135,II,"Your breezy robe, your cheerful tone,"
136,II,
137,II,As through our pretty home you speed
138,II,"The busy ministries of life,"
139,II,"Will stir me swifter than my creed,"
140,II,"And be more musical, dear wife,"
141,II,"Than sweep of harp, or pipe of reed."
142,II,
143,II,"""Here is our fairy banquet hall!"
144,II,"See how it opens to the East,"
145,II,"And looks through elms!  The board is small,"
146,II,But what it bears shall be a feast
147,II,"At morn, and noon, and evenfall."
148,II,
149,II,"""There will you sit in girlish grace,"
150,II,"And catch, the sunrise in your hair;"
151,II,"And looking at you, from my place,"
152,II,I shall behold more sweet and fair
153,II,The morning in your smiling face.
154,II,
155,II,"""And guests shall come, and guests shall go,"
156,II,And break with us our daily bread;
157,II,And sometime--sometime--do you know?
158,II,"I hope that--dearest, lift your head;"
159,II,"And let me speak it, soft and low!"
160,II,
161,II,"""The grass is sweeter than the ground:"
162,II,Can love be better than its flowers?
163,II,Oh sometime--sometime--in the round
164,II,"Of coming years, this board of ours"
165,II,I hope may blossom and abound
166,II,
167,II,"With shining curls, and laughing eyes,"
168,II,"And pleasant jests and merry words,"
169,II,"And questions full of life's surprise,"
170,II,"And light and music, when the birds"
171,II,Have left us to our gloomy skies.
172,II,
173,II,"""Now mount with me the old oak stair!"
174,II,This is your chamber--pink and blue!
175,II,"They asked the color of your hair,"
176,II,"And draped and fitted all for you,"
177,II,"My fine brunette, with tasteful care."
178,II,
179,II,"""The linen is as white as snow;"
180,II,The flowers are set on every sconce;
181,II,And e'en the cushioned pin-heads show
182,II,"Your formal ""welcome,"" for the nonce,"
183,II,To the sweet home their hands bestow.
184,II,
185,II,"""Declining to the river's marge,"
186,II,"See, from this window, how the turf"
187,II,Runs with a thousand flowers in charge
188,II,To meet the silver feet of surf
189,II,That fly from every passing barge!
190,II,
191,II,"""Along that reach of liquid light"
192,II,Flies Commerce with her countless keels;
193,II,There the chained Titan in his might
194,II,Turns slowly round the groaning wheels
195,II,"That drag her burdens, day and night."
196,II,
197,II,"""And now the red sun flings his kiss"
198,II,Across its waves from finger-tips
199,II,"That pause, and grudgingly dismiss"
200,II,"The one he loves to closer lips,"
201,II,And Moonlight's quiet hour of bliss.
202,II,
203,II,"""And here comes Dinah with the steam"
204,II,"Of evening cups and evening food,"
205,II,"And coal-red berries quenched with cream,"
206,II,And ministry of homely good
207,II,"That proves, my dear, we do not dream."""

211,III.,III.
212,III.,
213,III.,He heard the long-drawn organ-peal
214,III.,Within his chapel call to prayer;
215,III.,"And, answering with ready zeal,"
216,III.,He breathed o'er Mildred's weary chair
217,III.,"These words, and sealed them with a seal:"
218,III.,
219,III.,"""Only an hour: but comfort take;--"
220,III.,This home and I are wholly yours;
221,III.,And many bosoms fondly ache
222,III.,"To tell you, that while life endures,"
223,III.,You shall be cherished for my sake.
224,III.,
225,III.,"""So throw your heart's door open wide,"
226,III.,And take in mine as well as me;
227,III.,Let no poor creature be denied
228,III.,The grace of tender courtesy
229,III.,"And kindness from the pastor's bride."""
230,III.,
231,III.,
232,III.,
233,III.,
234,IV.,IV.
235,IV.,
236,IV.,The moon came up the summer sky:
237,IV.,"""Oh happy moon!"" the lady said;"
238,IV.,"""Men love thee for thyself, but I"
239,IV.,Am loved because my life is wed
240,IV.,"To one whose message, pure and high,"
241,IV.,
242,IV.,"Has spread the world's evangel far,"
243,IV.,And thrown such radiance through the dark
244,IV.,"That men behold him as a star,"
245,IV.,And in his gracious coming mark
246,IV.,How beautiful his footsteps are.
247,IV.,
248,IV.,"""Oh Moon! dost thou take all thy light"
249,IV.,From the great sun so lately gone?
250,IV.,"Are there not shapes upon thy white,"
251,IV.,"That mould and make his sheen thy own,"
252,IV.,And charms that soften to the sight
253,IV.,
254,IV.,The ardor of his blinding blaze?
255,IV.,Who loves thee that thou art the sun's?
256,IV.,Who does not give thee sweetest praise
257,IV.,Among the troop of shining ones
258,IV.,That sweep along the heavenly ways?
259,IV.,
260,IV.,"""Yet still within the holy place"
261,IV.,The altar sanctifies the gift!
262,IV.,"Poor, precious gift, that begs for grace!"
263,IV.,Oh towering altar! that doth lift
264,IV.,"The gift so high, that, in its face,"
265,IV.,
266,IV.,It bears no beauty to the thought
267,IV.,Of those who round the altar stand!
268,IV.,"Poor, precious gift, that goes for naught"
269,IV.,"From willing heart and ready hand,"
270,IV.,And wins no favor unbesought!
271,IV.,
272,IV.,"""The stars are whiter for the blue;"
273,IV.,The sky is deeper for the stars;
274,IV.,"They give and take in commerce true,"
275,IV.,And lend their beauty to the cars
276,IV.,"Of downy dusk, that all night through,"
277,IV.,
278,IV.,Roll o'er the void on silver wheels;
279,IV.,Yet neither starry sky nor cloud
280,IV.,Is loved the less that it reveals
281,IV.,"A beauty all its own, endowed"
282,IV.,By all the wealth its beauty steals.
283,IV.,
284,IV.,"""Am I a dew-drop in a rose,"
285,IV.,With no significance apart?
286,IV.,Must I but sparkle in repose
287,IV.,"Close to its folded, fragrant, heart,"
288,IV.,Its peerless beauty to disclose?
289,IV.,
290,IV.,"""Would I not toil to win his bread,"
291,IV.,And give him all I have to give?
292,IV.,"Would I not die in his sweet stead,"
293,IV.,And die in joy?  But I must live;
294,IV.,"And, living, I must still be fed"
295,IV.,
296,IV.,On love that comes in love's own right.
297,IV.,"They must not pet, or pamper me--"
298,IV.,Those who rejoice beneath his light--
299,IV.,"Or pity him, that I can be"
300,IV.,"So precious in his princely sight."""
301,IV.,
302,IV.,"With swifter wings, through heart and brain,"
303,IV.,The little hour unheeded flew;
304,IV.,"And when, behind the blazoned stain"
305,IV.,"Of saintly vestures, red and blue,"
306,IV.,The lights on rose and window-pane
307,IV.,
308,IV.,"Within the chapel slowly died,"
309,IV.,And figures muffled by the moon
310,IV.,Went shuffling home on either side--
311,IV.,One seeking her--she said: How soon!
312,IV.,And then the pastor kissed his bride.
313,IV.,
314,IV.,
315,IV.,
316,V.,V.
317,V.,
318,V.,The bright night brightened into dawn;
319,V.,The shadows down the mountain passed;
320,V.,"And tree and shrub and sloping lawn,"
321,V.,"With bending, beaded beauty glassed"
322,V.,In myriad suns the sun that shone!
323,V.,
324,V.,The robin fed her nested young;
325,V.,The swallows bickered 'neath the eaves;
326,V.,"The hang-bird in her hammock swung,"
327,V.,"And, tilting high among the leaves,"
328,V.,"Her red mate sang alone, or flung"
329,V.,
330,V.,The dew-drops on her lifted head;
331,V.,"While on the grasses, white and far,"
332,V.,The tents of fairy hosts were spread
333,V.,"That, scared before the morning star,"
334,V.,"Had left their reeking camp, and fled."
335,V.,
336,V.,The pigeon preened his opal breast;
337,V.,"And o'er the meads the bobolink,"
338,V.,With vexed perplexity confessed
339,V.,"His tinkling gutturals in a kink,"
340,V.,Or giggled round his secret nest.
341,V.,
342,V.,"With dizzy wings and dainty craft,"
343,V.,"In green and gold, the humming-bird"
344,V.,"Dashed here and there, and touched and quaffed"
345,V.,"The honey-dew, then flashed and whirred,"
346,V.,And vanished like the feathered shaft
347,V.,
348,V.,That glitters from a random bow.
349,V.,"The flies were buzzing in the sun,"
350,V.,The bees were busy in the snow
351,V.,"Of lilies, and the spider spun,"
352,V.,And waited for his prey below.
353,V.,
354,V.,"With sail aloft and sail adown,"
355,V.,"And motion neither slow nor swift,"
356,V.,"With dark-brown hull and shadow brown,"
357,V.,"Half-way between two skies adrift,"
358,V.,The barque went dreaming toward the town.
359,V.,
360,V.,"'Twas Sunday in the silent street,"
361,V.,And Sunday in the silent sky.
362,V.,The peace of God came down to meet
363,V.,"The throng that laid their labor by,"
364,V.,"And rested, weary hands and feet."
365,V.,
366,V.,"Ah, sweet the scene which caught the glance"
367,V.,"Of eyes that with the morning woke,"
368,V.,"And, from their window in the manse,"
369,V.,Looked up through sprays of elm and oak
370,V.,"Into the sky's serene expanse,"
371,V.,
372,V.,"And off upon the distant wood,"
373,V.,"And down into the garden's close,"
374,V.,"And over, where his chapel stood"
375,V.,"In ivy, reaching to its rose,"
376,V.,Waiting the Sunday multitude!
377,V.,
378,V.,
379,V.,
380,VI.,VI.
381,VI.,
382,VI.,A red rose in her raven hair
383,VI.,"Whose curls forbade the plait and braid,"
384,VI.,"The bride slid down the oaken stair,"
385,VI.,"And mantled like a bashful maid,"
386,VI.,"As, seated in the waiting chair,"
387,VI.,
388,VI.,"Behind the fragrant urn, she poured"
389,VI.,The nectar of the morn's repast;
390,VI.,"But fairer lady, fonder lord,"
391,VI.,In happier hall ne'er broke their fast
392,VI.,"With sweeter bread, at prouder board."
393,VI.,
394,VI.,"And then they rose with common will,"
395,VI.,"And sought the parlor, cool and dim."
396,VI.,"""Sing, love!"" he said. ""The birds grow still,"
397,VI.,"And wait with me to hear your hymn."""
398,VI.,"She swept a low, preluding trill--"
399,VI.,
400,VI.,A spray of sound--across the keys
401,VI.,That felt her fingers for the first;
402,VI.,"And then, from simplest cadences,"
403,VI.,"A reverent melody she nursed,"
404,VI.,And gave it voice in words like these:
405,VI.,
406,VI.,"""From full forgetfulness of pain,"
407,VI.,"From joy to opening joy again,"
408,VI.,"With bird and flower, and hill and tree,"
409,VI.,"We lift our eyes and hands, to thee,"
410,VI.,"To greet thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth"
411,VI.,
412,VI.,"""That thou dost bathe our souls anew"
413,VI.,"With balm and boon of heavenly dew,"
414,VI.,And smilest in our upward eyes
415,VI.,"From the far blue of smiling skies,"
416,VI.,"We bless thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth!"
417,VI.,
418,VI.,"""For human love and love divine,"
419,VI.,"For love of ours and love of thine,"
420,VI.,For heaven on earth and heaven above--
421,VI.,To thee and us twin homes of love--
422,VI.,"We thank thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth!"
423,VI.,
424,VI.,"""Oh dove-like wings, so wide unfurled"
425,VI.,In brooding calm above the world!
426,VI.,"Waft us your holy peace, and raise"
427,VI.,The incense of our morning praise
428,VI.,"Up to our Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth!"""
429,VI.,
430,VII.,VII.
431,VII.,
432,VII.,Full fleetly sped the morning hours;
433,VII.,"Then, wide upon the country round"
434,VII.,A tumult of melodious powers
435,VII.,In tumult of melodious sound
436,VII.,Burst forth from all the village towers.
437,VII.,
438,VII.,"With blow on blow, and tone on tone,"
439,VII.,And echoes answering everywhere--
440,VII.,Like bugles from the mountains blown--
441,VII.,"Each sought to whelm the burdened air,"
442,VII.,And make the silence all its own.
443,VII.,
444,VII.,"In broad, sonorous, silver swells"
445,VII.,The air was billowed like the sea;
446,VII.,And listening ears were listening shells
447,VII.,"That caught the Sabbath minstrelsy,"
448,VII.,And sang it with the singing bells.
449,VII.,
450,VII.,"The billows heaved, the billows broke,"
451,VII.,The first wild burst went down amain;
452,VII.,"The music fell to slower stroke,"
453,VII.,"And in a rhythmic, bold refrain"
454,VII.,The great bells to each other spoke.
455,VII.,
456,VII.,"Oh bravely bronze gave forth his word,"
457,VII.,"And sharply silver made reply,"
458,VII.,And every tower and turret stirred
459,VII.,"With sounding breath and converse high,"
460,VII.,"Or paused with waiting ear, and heard."
461,VII.,
462,VII.,"And long they talked, as friend to friend;"
463,VII.,"Then faltered to their closing toll,"
464,VII.,"Whose long, monotonous repetend,"
465,VII.,From every music-burdened bowl
466,VII.,"Poured the last drop, and brought the end!"
467,VII.,
468,VII.,
469,VII.,
470,VIII.,VIII.
471,VIII.,
472,VIII.,"The chapel's chime fell slow and soft,"
473,VIII.,And throngs slow-marching to its knoll
474,VIII.,"From village home and distant croft,"
475,VIII.,With careful feet and reverent soul
476,VIII.,"Pressed toward the open door, but oft"
477,VIII.,
478,VIII.,Turned curious and expectant eyes
479,VIII.,Upon the Manse that stood apart.
480,VIII.,"There in her quiet, bridal guise"
481,VIII.,Fair Mildred sat with shrinking heart;
482,VIII.,"While Philip, bold and over wise,"
483,VIII.,
484,VIII.,"And knowing naught of woman's ways,"
485,VIII.,"Smiled at her fears, and could not guess"
486,VIII.,"How one so armored in his praise,"
487,VIII.,"And strong in native loveliness,"
488,VIII.,Could dread to meet his people's gaze.
489,VIII.,
490,VIII.,He could not know her fine alarm
491,VIII.,"When at his manly side she stood,"
492,VIII.,"And, leaning faintly on his arm--"
493,VIII.,A dainty slip of womanhood--
494,VIII.,Walked forth where every girlish charm
495,VIII.,
496,VIII.,"Was scanned with prying gaze and glance,"
497,VIII.,Among the slowly moving crowd
498,VIII.,"That, greedy of the precious chance,"
499,VIII.,"Read furtively, but half aloud,"
500,VIII.,The pages of their new romance.
501,VIII.,
502,VIII.,"""A child!""  And Mildred caught the word."
503,VIII.,"""A plaything!""  And, another voice:"
504,VIII.,"""Fine feathers, and a Southern bird!"""
505,VIII.,"And still one more; ""A parson's choice!"""
506,VIII.,And trembling Mildred overheard.
507,VIII.,
508,VIII.,These from the careless or the dull--
509,VIII.,"Gossips at best; at wisest, dolts;"
510,VIII.,And though her quickened ear might cull
511,VIII.,From out their whispered thunderbolts
512,VIII.,"A ""lovely!"" and a ""beautiful!"""
513,VIII.,
514,VIII.,"And though sweet mother-faces smiled,"
515,VIII.,"And bows were given with friendly grace,"
516,VIII.,And many a pleasant little child
517,VIII.,"Sought sympathy within her face,"
518,VIII.,Her aching heart was not beguiled.
519,VIII.,
520,VIII.,She did not see--she only felt--
521,VIII.,As up the staring aisle she walked--
522,VIII.,"The critic glances, coldly dealt,"
523,VIII.,"By those who looked, and bent, and talked;"
524,VIII.,"And, even, when at last she knelt"
525,VIII.,
526,VIII.,"Alone within the pastor's pew,"
527,VIII.,And prayed for self-forgetfulness
528,VIII.,"With deep humility, she knew"
529,VIII.,She gave her figure and her dress
530,VIII.,To careful eyes with closer view.
531,VIII.,
532,VIII.,
533,VIII.,
534,IX.,IX.
535,IX.,
536,IX.,"At length she raised her head, and tossed"
537,IX.,"A burden from her heart, and brain."
538,IX.,She would have love at any cost
539,IX.,"Of weary toil and patient pain,"
540,IX.,And rightful ease and pleasure lost!
541,IX.,
542,IX.,They could not love her for his sake;
543,IX.,"They would not, and her heart forgave."
544,IX.,Why should a woman stoop to take
545,IX.,"The poor endowment of a slave,"
546,IX.,And like a menial choose to make
547,IX.,
548,IX.,Her master's mantle half her own?
549,IX.,They loved her least who loved him most:
550,IX.,They envied her her little throne!
551,IX.,He who was cherished by a host
552,IX.,"Was hers by gift, and hers alone,"
553,IX.,
554,IX.,And she would prove her woman's right
555,IX.,To hold the throne to which the king
556,IX.,"Had called her, clothing her with white;"
557,IX.,And never would she show her ring
558,IX.,To win a loving proselyte!
559,IX.,
560,IX.,These were the thoughts and this the strife
561,IX.,"That through her kindling spirit swept,"
562,IX.,And wrought her purposes of life;
563,IX.,And powers that waked and powers that slept
564,IX.,Within the sweet and girlish wife.
565,IX.,
566,IX.,"Sprang into energy intense,"
567,IX.,At touch of an inspiring chrism
568,IX.,"That fell on her, she knew not whence,"
569,IX.,And lifted her to heroism
570,IX.,"Which wrapped her wholly, soul and sense."

572,IX.,
573,IX.,
574,X.,X.
575,X.,
576,X.,"Meanwhile, through all the vaulted space"
577,X.,The organ sent its angels out;
578,X.,And up and down the holy place
579,X.,"They fanned the cheeks of care and doubt,"
580,X.,And touched each worn and weary face
581,X.,
582,X.,With beauty as their wings went by:
583,X.,"Then sailed afar with peaceful sweep,"
584,X.,"And, calling heavenward every eye,"
585,X.,Evanished into silence deep--
586,X.,The earth forgotten in the sky!
587,X.,
588,X.,"Then by the sunlight warmly kissed,"
589,X.,"Far up, in rainbow glory set,"
590,X.,"Rayed round with gold and amethyst,"
591,X.,She saw upon the great rosette
592,X.,"The Saviour's visage, pale and trist."
593,X.,
594,X.,"""Oh Crown of Thorns!"" she softly breathed;"
595,X.,"""Oh precious crown of love divine!"
596,X.,Oh brow with trickling life enwreathed!
597,X.,Oh piercing thorns and crimson sign!
598,X.,I hold you mine in love bequeathed.
599,X.,
600,X.,"""But not for sake of these or thee!"
601,X.,I must win love as thou hast won.
602,X.,"The thorns are mine, and all must see,"
603,X.,"In sacrifice, and service done,"
604,X.,"The loving Lord they love in me."""
605,X.,
606,X.,
607,X.,
608,XI.,XI.
609,XI.,
610,XI.,"Then, through a large and golden hour"
611,XI.,She listened to the golden speech
612,XI.,Of one who held the priceless dower
613,XI.,"Of love and eloquence, that reach"
614,XI.,And move the hearts of men with power.
615,XI.,
616,XI.,Ah poor the music of the choir
617,XI.,That voiced the Psalter after him!
618,XI.,"And strong the prayer that, touched with fire,"
619,XI.,"Flamed upward, past the seraphim,"
620,XI.,And wrapped the throne of his desire!
621,XI.,
622,XI.,"She watched and heard as in a dream,"
623,XI.,"When, in the old, familiar ground"
624,XI.,"Of sacred truth, he found his theme,"
625,XI.,"And led it forth, until it wound"
626,XI.,Through meadows broad--a swollen stream
627,XI.,
628,XI.,"That flashed and eddied in the light,"
629,XI.,"And fed the grasses at its edge,"
630,XI.,Or thundered in its onward might
631,XI.,"O'er interposing weir and ledge,"
632,XI.,And left them hidden in the white;
633,XI.,
634,XI.,"While on it pressed, and, to the eye,"
635,XI.,"Grew broader, till its breadth became"
636,XI.,"A solemn river, sweeping by,"
637,XI.,"That, quick with ships and red with flame,"
638,XI.,Reached far away and kissed the sky!
639,XI.,
640,XI.,Strong men were moved as trees are bowed
641,XI.,Before a swift and sounding wind;
642,XI.,"And sighs were long and sobs were loud,"
643,XI.,"Of those who loved and those who sinned,"
644,XI.,Among the deeply listening crowd.
645,XI.,
646,XI.,
647,XI.,
648,XII.,XII.
649,XII.,
650,XII.,"And Mildred, in the whelming tide"
651,XII.,"Of thought and feeling, quite forgot"
652,XII.,That he who thus had magnified
653,XII.,"His office, held a common lot"
654,XII.,"With her, and owned her as his bride."
655,XII.,
656,XII.,"But when, at length, the thought returned"
657,XII.,"That she was his in plighted truth,"
658,XII.,And she with humbled soul discerned
659,XII.,"That, though her youth was given to youth,"
660,XII.,"And love by love was fairly earned,"
661,XII.,
662,XII.,She could not match him wing-and-wing
663,XII.,"Through all his broad and lofty range,"
664,XII.,And feared what passing years might bring
665,XII.,"No change for good, but only change"
666,XII.,That would degrade her to a thing
667,XII.,
668,XII.,"Of homely use and household care,"
669,XII.,And love by duty basely kept--
670,XII.,She bowed her head upon the bare
671,XII.,"Cold rail that hid her face, and wept,"
672,XII.,And poured her passion in a prayer.
673,XII.,
674,XII.,
675,XII.,
676,XIII.,XIII.
677,XIII.,
678,XIII.,"""Oh Father, Father!"" thus she prayed:"
679,XIII.,"""Thou know'st the priceless boon I seek!"
680,XIII.,"Before my life, abashed, dismayed,"
681,XIII.,"I stand, with hopeless hands and weak,"
682,XIII.,Of him and of myself afraid!
683,XIII.,
684,XIII.,"""Teach me and lead me where to find,"
685,XIII.,"Beyond the touch of hand and lip,"
686,XIII.,"That vital charm of heart, and mind"
687,XIII.,"Which, in a true companionship,"
688,XIII.,My feebler life to his shall bind!
689,XIII.,
690,XIII.,"""His ladder leans upon the sun:"
691,XIII.,I cannot climb it: give me wings!
692,XIII.,"Grant that my deeds, divinely done,"
693,XIII.,"May be appraised divinest things,"
694,XIII.,Though they be little every one.
695,XIII.,
696,XIII.,"""His stride is strong; his steps are high"
697,XIII.,May not my deeds be little stairs
698,XIII.,"That, counted swift, shall keep me nigh,"
699,XIII.,"Till at the summit, unawares,"
700,XIII.,We stand with equal foot and eye?
701,XIII.,
702,XIII.,"""If further down toward Nature's heart"
703,XIII.,"His root is struck, commanding springs"
704,XIII.,"In whose deep life I have no part,"
705,XIII.,"Send me, on recompensing wings,"
706,XIII.,The rain that gathers where thou art!
707,XIII.,
708,XIII.,"""Oh give me vision to divine"
709,XIII.,What he with delving hand explores!
710,XIII.,Feed me with flame that shall refine
711,XIII.,To finest gold the rugged ores
712,XIII.,His strong hands gather from the mine!
713,XIII.,
714,XIII.,"""O dearest Father!  May no sloth,"
715,XIII.,"Or weakness of my weaker soul,"
716,XIII.,"Delay him in his kingly growth,"
717,XIII.,Or hold him meanly from the goal
718,XIII.,"That shines with guerdon for us both!"""
719,XIII.,
720,XIII.,
721,XIII.,
722,XIV.,XIV.
723,XIV.,
724,XIV.,Then all arose as if a spell
725,XIV.,"Had been dissolved for their release,"
726,XIV.,The while the benediction fell
727,XIV.,Which breathed the gentle Master's peace
728,XIV.,On all the souls that loved him well.
729,XIV.,
730,XIV.,"And Philip, coming from his place,"
731,XIV.,"Like Moses from the mountain pyre,"
732,XIV.,Bore on his brow the shining grace
733,XIV.,"Of one who, in the cloud and fire,"
734,XIV.,"Had met his Maker, face to face."
735,XIV.,
736,XIV.,"And men and women, young and old,"
737,XIV.,"Pressed up to meet him as he came,"
738,XIV.,"And children, by their love made bold,"
739,XIV.,"Grasped both his hands and spoke his name,"
740,XIV.,And in their simple language told
741,XIV.,
742,XIV.,Their joy to see his face once more;
743,XIV.,"While half in pleasure, half in pain,"
744,XIV.,His bride stood waiting at her door
745,XIV.,The passage of the friendly train
746,XIV.,That slowly swept the crowded floor.
747,XIV.,
748,XIV.,Half-bows were tendered and returned;
749,XIV.,And welcomes fell from lips and eyes;
750,XIV.,But in her heart she meekly spurned
751,XIV.,The love that came in love's disguise
752,XIV.,Of sympathy--the love unearned.
753,XIV.,
754,XIV.,
755,XIV.,
756,XV.,XV.
757,XV.,
758,XV.,Then out beneath the noon-day sun
759,XV.,"Of the old Temple, cool and dim,"
760,XV.,"She walked beside her chosen one,"
761,XV.,And lost her loneliness in him;
762,XV.,But hardly was her walk begun
763,XV.,
764,XV.,"When, straight before her in the street,"
765,XV.,With tender shock her eye descried
766,XV.,"A little child, with naked feet"
767,XV.,"And scanty dress, that, hollow-eyed,"
768,XV.,Looked up and begged for bread to eat.
769,XV.,
770,XV.,Nor pride of place nor dainty spleen
771,XV.,Felt with her heart the sickening shock.
772,XV.,She took the hand so soiled and lean;
773,XV.,And silken robe and ragged frock
774,XV.,Moved side by side across the green.
775,XV.,
776,XV.,"She looked for love, and, low and wild,"
777,XV.,"She found it--looking, too, for love!"
778,XV.,"So in each other's eyes they smiled,"
779,XV.,"As, dark brown hand in snowy glove,"
780,XV.,The bride led home the hungry child.
781,XV.,
782,XV.,And men and women in amaze
783,XV.,Paused in their homeward steps to see
784,XV.,"The bride retreating from their gaze,"
785,XV.,Clasped hand in hand with misery;
786,XV.,"Then brushed their eyes, and went their ways."
787,XV.,
788,XV.,
789,XV.,
790,XV.,"When the long parley found a close,"
791,XV.,"And, clean and kempt, the little oaf--"
792,XV.,"Disburdened of her wants and woes,"
793,XV.,And burdened with her wheaten loaf--
794,XV.,Went forth to minister to those
795,XV.,
796,XV.,"Who sent her on her bitter quest,"
797,XV.,"The bride stood smiling at her door,"
798,XV.,And in her happiness confessed
799,XV.,"That she had found a friend; nay, more--"
800,XV.,Had entertained a heavenly guest.
801,XV.,
802,XV.,"And as she watched her down the street,"
803,XV.,"With brow grown bright with sunny thought,"
804,XV.,"And heart o'erfilled with something sweet,"
805,XV.,She knew the vagrant child had brought
806,XV.,The blessing of the Paraclete.
807,XV.,
808,XV.,"She turned from out the blazing noon,"
809,XV.,"And sought her chamber's quiet shade,"
810,XV.,Like one who had received a boon
811,XV.,"She might not show, but which essayed"
812,XV.,Expression in a happy croon.
813,XV.,
814,XV.,"And then, outleaping from the mesh"
815,XV.,"Of Memory's net, like bird or bee,"
816,XV.,There thrilled her spirit and her flesh
817,XV.,"This old half-song, half-rhapsody,"
818,XV.,"That sang, or said itself, afresh:"
819,XV.,
820,XV.,
821,XV.,"""Poor little wafer of silver!"
822,XV.,More precious to me than its cost!
823,XV.,"It was worn of both image and legend,"
824,XV.,But priceless because it was lost.
825,XV.,My chamber I carefully swept;
826,XV.,"I hunted, and wondered, and wept;"
827,XV.,And I found it at last with a cry:
828,XV.,"""Oh dear little jewel!"" said I;"
829,XV.,And I washed it with tears all the day;
830,XV.,"Then I kissed it, and put it away."
831,XV.,
832,XV.,"""Poor little lamb of the sheepfold!"
833,XV.,Unlovely and feeble it grew;
834,XV.,"But it wandered away to the mountains,"
835,XV.,And was fairer the further it flew.
836,XV.,I followed with hurrying feet
837,XV.,"At the call of its pitiful bleat,"
838,XV.,"And precious, with wonderful charms,"
839,XV.,"I caught it at last in my arms,"
840,XV.,"And bore it far back to its keep,"
841,XV.,And kissed it and put it to sleep.
842,XV.,
843,XV.,"""Poor little vagrant from Heaven!"
844,XV.,"It wandered away from the fold,"
845,XV.,And its weakness and danger endowed it
846,XV.,With value more precious than gold.
847,XV.,"Oh happy the day when it came,"
848,XV.,And my heart learned its beautiful name!
849,XV.,Oh happy the hour when I fed
850,XV.,This waif of the angels with bread!
851,XV.,And the lamb that the Shepherd had missed
852,XV.,"Was sheltered and nourished and kissed!"""

863,XVII.,
864,XVII.,From loneliness and homely care
865,XVII.,By love's unfailing ministry;
866,XVII.,"No toil of his was she to share,"
867,XVII.,"No burden hers, that should not be"

869,XVII.,
870,XVII.,"His love enwrapped her as a robe,"
871,XVII.,"Which seemed, by its supernal charm,"
872,XVII.,To shield from every poisoned probe
873,XVII.,Of earthly pain and earthly harm
874,XVII.,This one choice creature of the globe.
875,XVII.,
876,XVII.,The love he bore her lifted him
877,XVII.,"Into a bright, sweet atmosphere"
878,XVII.,That filled with beauty to the brim
879,XVII.,"The world beneath him, far and near,"
880,XVII.,And stained the clouds that draped its rim.
881,XVII.,
882,XVII.,"Toil was not toil, except in name;"

886,XVII.,Through which her figure went and came.
887,XVII.,
888,XVII.,Her smile of welcome was his meed;
889,XVII.,Her presence was his great reward;
890,XVII.,"He questioned sadly if, indeed,"
891,XVII.,"He loved more loyally his Lord,"
892,XVII.,Or if his Lord felt greater need.

894,XVII.,"And Mildred, vexed, misunderstood,"

899,XVII.,
900,XVII.,She knew the girlish charm would fade;
901,XVII.,She knew the rapture would abate;
902,XVII.,"That years would follow when the maid,"
903,XVII.,"Merged in the matron, and sedate"
904,XVII.,"With change, and sitting in the shade"
905,XVII.,
906,XVII.,"Of a great nature, would become"
907,XVII.,As poor and pitiful a thing

933,XVIII.,
934,XVIII.,"So when the Sunday light declined,"
935,XVIII.,A cold wind sprang and shut the flowers

938,XVIII.,Till the old chimney howled and whined
939,XVIII.,
940,XVIII.,"As if it were a frightened beast,"
941,XVIII.,That witnessed from its dizzy post
942,XVIII.,The loathsome forms and grewsome feast

945,XVIII.,
946,XVIII.,"The willow, gathered into sheaves"

951,XVIII.,
952,XVIII.,And in the midnight came the rain;--
953,XVIII.,In spiteful needles at the first;
954,XVIII.,But soon on roof and window-pane
955,XVIII.,The slowly gathered fury burst
956,XVIII.,"In floods that came, and came again,"
957,XVIII.,
958,XVIII.,And poured their roaring burden out.
959,XVIII.,"They swept along the sounding street,"
960,XVIII.,"Then paused, and then with shriek and shout"
961,XVIII.,Hurtled as if a myriad feet
962,XVIII.,Had joined the dread and deafening rout.
963,XVIII.,
964,XVIII.,"But ere the welcome morning broke,"
965,XVIII.,"The loud wind fell, though gray and chill"
966,XVIII.,The drizzling rain and drifting smoke
967,XVIII.,"Drove slowly toward the westward hill,"
968,XVIII.,Half hidden in its phantom cloak.
969,XVIII.,
970,XVIII.,"And through the mist a clumsy smack,"
971,XVIII.,"Deep loaded with her clumsy freight,"
972,XVIII.,"With shifting boom and frequent tack,"
973,XVIII.,"Like a huge ghost that wandered late,"

986,XIX.,"But while she looked, with dreaming eyes"

992,XIX.,Some one beyond her stinted view;

996,XIX.,Pass to her door.  At once she knew
997,XIX.,
998,XIX.,"That some faint soul, in sad extreme,"
999,XIX.,"Had sent for succor to the manse,"
1000,XIX.,And knew its master would redeem

1065,XX.,"With Fichte, Kant, and Hegel, down"
1066,XX.,Through all the long and stately line!
1067,XX.,
1068,XX.,"As Mildred saw the awful host,"
1069,XX.,She felt within no motive stir
1070,XX.,"To realize her girlish boast,"
1071,XX.,And knew they held no more for her
1072,XX.,Than if each volume were a ghost.
1073,XX.,
1074,XX.,
1075,XX.,
1076,XXI.,XXI.
1077,XXI.,
1078,XXI.,"She sat in Philip's vacant chair,"
1079,XXI.,And pondered long her doubtful way;
1080,XXI.,"And, in her impotent despair,"
1081,XXI.,"Lifted her longing eyes to pray,"
1082,XXI.,"When on a shelf, far up, and bare,"
1083,XXI.,
1084,XXI.,She saw an ancient volume lie;
1085,XXI.,And straight her rising thought was checked.
1086,XXI.,What were its dubious treasures?  Why
1087,XXI.,"Had it been banished from respect,"
1088,XXI.,And from its owner's hand and eye?
1089,XXI.,
1090,XXI.,"The more she gazed, the stronger grew"
1091,XXI.,The wish to hold it in her hand.
1092,XXI.,"Strange fancies round the volume flew,"
1093,XXI.,And changed the dust their pinions fanned
1094,XXI.,"To atmospheres of red and blue,"
1095,XXI.,
1096,XXI.,"That blent in purple aureole,--"
1097,XXI.,As if a lymph of sweetest life
1098,XXI.,"Stood warm within a golden bowl,"
1099,XXI.,"Crowned with its odor-cloud, and rife"
1100,XXI.,With strength and solace for her soul!
1101,XXI.,
1102,XXI.,"And there it lay beyond her arm,"
1103,XXI.,"And wrought its fine and wondrous spell,"
1104,XXI.,"With all its hoard of good or harm,"
1105,XXI.,"Till curious Mildred, struggling well,"
1106,XXI.,Surrendered to the mighty charm.
1107,XXI.,
1108,XXI.,"The steps were scaled for boon or bale,"
1109,XXI.,"The book was lifted from its place,"
1110,XXI.,"And, bowing to the fragrant grail,"
1111,XXI.,She drank with pleased and eager face
1112,XXI.,This draught from off an Eastern tale:
1113,XXI.,
1114,XXI.,
1115,XXI.,"Selim, the haughty Jehangir, the Conqueror of the Earth,"
1116,XXI.,With royal pomps and pageantries and rites of festal mirth
1117,XXI.,Was set to celebrate the day--the white day--of his birth.
1118,XXI.,
1119,XXI.,"His red pavilions, stretching wide, crowned all with globes of gold,"
1120,XXI.,"And tipped with pinnacles of fire and streamers manifold,"
1121,XXI.,Flamed with such splendor that the sun at noon looked pale and cold!
1122,XXI.,
1123,XXI.,"And right and left, along, the plain, far as the eye could gaze,"
1124,XXI.,"His nobles and retainers who were tented in the blaze,"
1125,XXI.,Kept revel high in honor of that day of all the days.
1126,XXI.,
1127,XXI.,"The earth was spread, the walls were hung, with silken fabrics fine,"
1128,XXI.,And arabesque and lotus-flower bore each the broidered sign
1129,XXI.,"Of jewels plucked from land and sea, and red gold from the mine."
1130,XXI.,
1131,XXI.,"Upon his throne he sat alone, half buried in the gems"
1132,XXI.,"That strewed his tapestries like stars, and tipped their tawny hems,"
1133,XXI.,And glittered with the glory of a hundred diadems.
1134,XXI.,
1135,XXI.,He saw from his pavilion door the nodding heron plumes
1136,XXI.,"His nobles wore upon their brows, while, from the rosy glooms"
1137,XXI.,"Which hid his harem, came low songs, on wings of rare perfumes!"
1138,XXI.,
1139,XXI.,"The elephants, a thousand strong, had passed his dreaming eye,"
1140,XXI.,"Caparisoned with golden plates on head and breast and thigh,"
1141,XXI.,And a hundred flashing troops of horse unmarked had thundered by.
1142,XXI.,
1143,XXI.,"He sat upon old Akbar's throne, the heir of power and fame,"
1144,XXI.,"But all his glory was as dust, and dust his wondrous name--"
1145,XXI.,"Swept into air, and scattered far, by one consuming flame!"
1146,XXI.,
1147,XXI.,"For on that day of all the days, and in that festal hour,"
1148,XXI.,"He sickened with his glory and grew weary of his power,"
1149,XXI.,"And pined to bind upon his breast his harem's choicest flower,"
1150,XXI.,
1151,XXI.,"""Oh Nourmahal! oh Nourmahal! why sit I here,"" he cried,--"
1152,XXI.,"""The victim of these gaudy shows, and of my haughty pride,"
1153,XXI.,When thou art dearer to my soul than all the world beside!
1154,XXI.,
1155,XXI.,"""Thy eyes are brighter than the gems piled round gilded seat;"
1156,XXI.,"Thy cheeks are softer than the silks that shimmer at my feet,"
1157,XXI.,And purer heart than thine in woman's breast hath never beat!
1158,XXI.,
1159,XXI.,"""My first love--and my only love--Oh babe of Candahar!"
1160,XXI.,"Torn from my boyish arms at first, and, like a silver star"
1161,XXI.,"Shining within another heaven, and worshipped from afar,"
1162,XXI.,
1163,XXI.,"""Thou art my own at last, my own!  I pine to see thy face;"
1164,XXI.,"Come to me, Nourmahal!  Oh come, and hallow with thy grace"
1165,XXI.,"The glories that without thy love are meaningless and base!"""
1166,XXI.,
1167,XXI.,"He spoke a word, and, quick as light, before him lying prone"
1168,XXI.,"A dark-eyed page, with gilded vest and crimson-belted zone,"
1169,XXI.,Looked up with waiting ear to mark the message from the throne.
1170,XXI.,
1171,XXI.,"""Go summon Nourmahal, my queen; and when her radiance comes,"
1172,XXI.,"Bear my command of silence to the vinas and the drums,"
1173,XXI.,"And for your guerdon take your choice of all these gilded crumbs."""
1174,XXI.,
1175,XXI.,"He tossed a handful of the gems down where his minion lay,"
1176,XXI.,"Who snatched a jewel from the drift, and swiftly sped away"
1177,XXI.,"With his command to Nourmahal, who waited to obey."
1178,XXI.,
1179,XXI.,"But needlessly the mandate fell of silence on the crowd,"
1180,XXI.,"For when the Empress swept the path, ten thousand heads were bowed,"
1181,XXI.,"And drum and vina ceased their din, and no one spoke aloud."
1182,XXI.,
1183,XXI.,"As comes the moon from out the sea with her attendant breeze,"
1184,XXI.,"As sweeps the morning up the hills and blossoms in the trees,"
1185,XXI.,So Nourmahal to Selim came: then fell upon her knees!
1186,XXI.,
1187,XXI.,"The envious jewels looked at her with chill, barbaric stare,"
1188,XXI.,"The cloth-of-gold she knelt upon grew lusterless and bare,"
1189,XXI.,And all the place was cooler in the darkness of her hair.
1190,XXI.,
1191,XXI.,"And while she knelt in queenly pride and beauty strange and wild,"
1192,XXI.,"And held her breast with both her palms and looked on him and smiled,"
1193,XXI.,"She seemed no more of common earth, but Casyapa's child."
1194,XXI.,
1195,XXI.,He bent to her as thus she smiled; he kissed her lifted cheek;
1196,XXI.,"""Oh Nourmahal,"" he murmured low, ""more dear than I can speak,"
1197,XXI.,"I'm weary of my lonely life: give me the rest I seek."""
1198,XXI.,
1199,XXI.,"She rose and paced the silken floor, as if in mad caprice,"
1200,XXI.,"Then paused, and from the Empress changed to improvisatrice,"
1201,XXI.,And wove this song--a golden chain--that led him into peace:
1202,XXI.,
1203,XXI.,
1204,XXI.,"Lovely children of the light,"
1205,XXI.,"Draped in radiant locks and pinions,--"
1206,XXI.,"Red and purple, blue and white--"
1207,XXI.,"In their beautiful dominions,"
1208,XXI.,"On the earth and in the spheres,"
1209,XXI.,Dwell the little glendoveers.
1210,XXI.,
1211,XXI.,"And the red can know no change,"
1212,XXI.,"And the blue are blue forever,"
1213,XXI.,And the yellow wings may range
1214,XXI.,Toward the white or purple never.
1215,XXI.,"But they mingle free from strife,"
1216,XXI.,For their color is their life.
1217,XXI.,
1218,XXI.,"When their color dies, they die,--"
1219,XXI.,Blent with earth or ether slowly--
1220,XXI.,"Leaving where their spirits lie,"
1221,XXI.,"Not a stain, so pure and holy"
1222,XXI.,Is the essence and the thought
1223,XXI.,Which their fading brings to naught!
1224,XXI.,
1225,XXI.,Each contented with the hue
1226,XXI.,"Which indues his wings of beauty,"
1227,XXI.,"Red or yellow, white or blue,"
1228,XXI.,Sings the measure of his duty
1229,XXI.,"Through the summer clouds in peace,"
1230,XXI.,And delights that never cease.
1231,XXI.,
1232,XXI.,Not with envy love they more
1233,XXI.,"Locks and pinions purple-tinted,"
1234,XXI.,Nor with jealousy adore
1235,XXI.,"Those whose pleasures are unstinted,"
1236,XXI.,And whose purple hair and wings
1237,XXI.,Give them place with queens and kings.
1238,XXI.,
1239,XXI.,When a purple glendoveer
1240,XXI.,"Flits along the mute expanses,"
1241,XXI.,"They surround him, far and near,"
1242,XXI.,"With their glancing wings and dances,"
1243,XXI.,And do honor to the hue
1244,XXI.,Loved by all and worn by few.
1245,XXI.,
1246,XXI.,"In the days long gone, alas!"
1247,XXI.,"Two upon a cloud, low-seated,"
1248,XXI.,Saw their pinions in the glass
1249,XXI.,Of a silver lake repeated.
1250,XXI.,"One was blue and one was red,"
1251,XXI.,And the lovely pair were wed.
1252,XXI.,
1253,XXI.,"""Purple wings are very fine,"""
1254,XXI.,"Spoke the voice of Ruby, gently:"
1255,XXI.,"""Ay"" said Sapphire, ""they're divine!""--"
1256,XXI.,Looking at his blue intently.
1257,XXI.,"""But we're blest,"" said Ruby, then,"
1258,XXI.,"""And we'll not complain like men."""
1259,XXI.,
1260,XXI.,"Sapphire stretched his loving arms,"
1261,XXI.,"And she nestled on his bosom,"
1262,XXI.,While his heart inhaled her charms
1263,XXI.,As the sense inhales a blossom;--
1264,XXI.,"Drank her wholly, tint and tone,"
1265,XXI.,Blent her being with his own.
1266,XXI.,
1267,XXI.,"Rapture passed, they raised their eyes,"
1268,XXI.,But were startled into clamor
1269,XXI.,Of a marvellous surprise!
1270,XXI.,Was it color! was it glamour!
1271,XXI.,"Purple-tinted, sweet and warm,"
1272,XXI.,Was each wing and folded form!
1273,XXI.,
1274,XXI.,Who had wrought it--how it came--
1275,XXI.,These were what the twain disputed.
1276,XXI.,How were mingled smoke and flame
1277,XXI.,Into royal hue transmuted?
1278,XXI.,"Each was right, the other wrong:"
1279,XXI.,"But their quarrel was not long,"
1280,XXI.,
1281,XXI.,For the moment that their speech
1282,XXI.,"Differed o'er their little story,"
1283,XXI.,Swiftly faded off from each
1284,XXI.,"Every trace of purple glory,"
1285,XXI.,"Blue was bluer than before,"
1286,XXI.,And the red was red once more.
1287,XXI.,
1288,XXI.,"Then they knew that both were wrong,"
1289,XXI.,And in sympathy of sorrow
1290,XXI.,Learned that each was only strong
1291,XXI.,"In the power to lend and borrow,--"
1292,XXI.,That the purple never grew
1293,XXI.,But by grace of red to blue.
1294,XXI.,
1295,XXI.,"So, embracing in content,"
1296,XXI.,"Hearts and wings again united,"
1297,XXI.,"Red and blue in purple blent,"
1298,XXI.,"And their holy troth replighted,"
1299,XXI.,"Both, as happy as the day,"
1300,XXI.,"Kissed, and rose, and flew away!"
1301,XXI.,
1302,XXI.,"And for twice a thousand years,"
1303,XXI.,"Floating through the radiant ether,"
1304,XXI.,"Lived the happy glendoveers,"
1305,XXI.,"Of the other, jealous neither,--"
1306,XXI.,"Sapphire naught without the red,"
1307,XXI.,Ruby still by blue bested.
1308,XXI.,
1309,XXI.,"But when weary of their life,"
1310,XXI.,They came down to earth at even--
1311,XXI.,"Purple husband, purple wife--"
1312,XXI.,"From the upper deeps of heaven,"
1313,XXI.,"And reclined upon the grass,"
1314,XXI.,That their little lives might pass.
1315,XXI.,
1316,XXI.,"Wing to wing and arms enwreathed,"
1317,XXI.,Sank they from their life's long dreaming;--
1318,XXI.,Into earth their souls they breathed;
1319,XXI.,"But when morning's light was streaming,"
1320,XXI.,All their joys and sweet regrets
1321,XXI.,Bloomed in banks of violets!
1322,XXI.,
1323,XXI.,
1324,XXI.,"As from its dimpled fountain, at its own capricious will,"
1325,XXI.,"Each step a note of music, and each fall and flash a thrill,"
1326,XXI.,"The rill goes singing to the meadow levels and is still,"
1327,XXI.,
1328,XXI.,So fell from Nourmahal her song upon the captive sense;
1329,XXI.,"It dashed in spray against the throne, it tinkled through the tents,"
1330,XXI.,And died at last among the flowery banks of recompense;
1331,XXI.,
1332,XXI.,"For when great Selim marked her fire, and read her riddle well,"
1333,XXI.,"And watched her from the flushing to the fading of the spell,"
1334,XXI.,"He sprang forgetful, from his seat, and caught her as she fell."
1335,XXI.,
1336,XXI.,He raised her in his tender arms; he bore her to his throne:
1337,XXI.,"""No more, oh! Nourmahal, my wife, no more I sit alone;"
1338,XXI.,"And the future for the dreary past shall royally atone!"""
1339,XXI.,
1340,XXI.,"He called to him the princes and the nobles of the land,"
1341,XXI.,"Then took the signet-ring from his, and placed it on her hand,"
1342,XXI.,"And bade them honor as his own, fair Nourmahal's command."
1343,XXI.,
1344,XXI.,"And on the minted silver that his largess scattered wide,"
1345,XXI.,"And on the gold of commerce, till the mighty Selim died,"
1346,XXI.,"Her name and his in shining boss stood equal, side by side."
1347,XXI.,
1348,XXI.,
1349,XXI.,
1350,XXII.,XXII.
1351,XXII.,
1352,XXII.,The opening of the wondrous tome
1353,XXII.,Was like the opening of a door
1354,XXII.,"Into a vast and pictured dome,"
1355,XXII.,"Crowded, from vaulted roof to floor,"
1356,XXII.,With secrets of her life and home.
1357,XXII.,
1358,XXII.,To be like Philip was to be
1359,XXII.,Another Philip--only less!
1360,XXII.,To win his wit in full degree
1361,XXII.,"Would bear to him but nothingness,"
1362,XXII.,From one no wiser grown than he!
1363,XXII.,
1364,XXII.,If blue and red in Hindostan
1365,XXII.,"Were blue and red at home, she knew"
1366,XXII.,"That she--a woman, he--a man,"
1367,XXII.,Could never wear the royal hue
1368,XXII.,Till blue and red together ran
1369,XXII.,
1370,XXII.,In complement of each to each;
1371,XXII.,She might not tint his life at all
1372,XXII.,By learning wisdom he could teach;
1373,XXII.,"So what she gave, though poor and small,"
1374,XXII.,Should be of that beyond his reach.
1375,XXII.,
1376,XXII.,"Where Philip fed, she would not feed;"
1377,XXII.,"Where Philip walked, she would not go;"
1378,XXII.,"The books he read she would not read,"
1379,XXII.,"But live her separate life, and, so,"
1380,XXII.,Have sole supplies to meet his need.
1381,XXII.,
1382,XXII.,He held his mission and his range;
1383,XXII.,His way and work were all his own;
1384,XXII.,And she would give him in exchange
1385,XXII.,"What she could win and she alone,"
1386,XXII.,"Of life and learning, fresh and strange."
1387,XXII.,
1388,XXII.,
1389,XXII.,
1390,XXIII.,XXIII.
1391,XXIII.,
1392,XXIII.,"While thus she sat in musing mood,"
1393,XXIII.,"Determining her life's emprise,"
1394,XXIII.,"The sunlight flushed the distant wood,"
1395,XXIII.,"Then, coming closer, filled her eyes,"
1396,XXIII.,And glorified her solitude.
1397,XXIII.,
1398,XXIII.,The clouds were shivered by the lance
1399,XXIII.,"Sped downward by the morning sun,"
1400,XXIII.,"And from her heart, in swift advance,"
1401,XXIII.,"The shadows vanished, one by one,"
1402,XXIII.,Till more than sunlight filled the manse.
1403,XXIII.,
1404,XXIII.,She closed the volume with a gust
1405,XXIII.,That sprent the light with powdered gold;
1406,XXIII.,Then placed it high to hide and rust
1407,XXIII.,"Where, curious and over-bold"
1408,XXIII.,"She found it, lying in its dust."
1409,XXIII.,
1410,XXIII.,"Her soul was light, her path was plain;"
1411,XXIII.,"One shadow only drooped above,--"
1412,XXIII.,The shadow of a heart and brain
1413,XXIII.,So charged with overwhelming love
1414,XXIII.,That it oppressed and gave her pain.
1415,XXIII.,
1416,XXIII.,The modest comb that kept her hair;
1417,XXIII.,To Philip was a golden crown;
1418,XXIII.,"And every ringlet was a snare,"
1419,XXIII.,"And every hat, and every gown"
1420,XXIII.,"And slipper, something more than fair."
1421,XXIII.,
1422,XXIII.,"His love had glorified her grace,"
1423,XXIII.,"And she was his, and not her own,--"
1424,XXIII.,So wholly his she had no place
1425,XXIII.,"Beside him on his lonely throne,"
1426,XXIII.,Or share in love's divine embrace.
1427,XXIII.,
1428,XXIII.,And knowing that the coming days
1429,XXIII.,"Would strip her features of their mask,"
1430,XXIII.,"That duty then would speak her praise,"
1431,XXIII.,"And love become a loyal task,"
1432,XXIII.,Save he should find beneath the glaze
1433,XXIII.,
1434,XXIII.,"His fiery love of her had spread,"
1435,XXIII.,"Diviner things he had not seen,"
1436,XXIII.,She feared her woman's heart and head
1437,XXIII.,Were armed with charms and powers too mean
1438,XXIII.,To win the boon she coveted.
1439,XXIII.,
1440,XXIII.,"But still she saw and held her plan,"
1441,XXIII.,And fear made way for springing hope.
1442,XXIII.,"If she was man's, then hers was man:"
1443,XXIII.,Both held their own in even scope;
1444,XXIII.,And then and there her life began.

1451,I.,I.
1452,I.,
1453,I.,A wife is like an unknown sea;--
1454,I.,Least known to him who thinks he knows
1455,I.,"Where all the shores of promise be,"
1456,I.,"Where lie the islands of repose,"
1457,I.,And where the rocks that he must flee.
1458,I.,
1459,I.,"Capricious winds, uncertain tides,"
1460,I.,"Drive the young sailor on and on,"
1461,I.,Till all his charts and all his guides
1462,I.,"Prove false, and vain conceit is gone,"
1463,I.,And only docile love abides.
1464,I.,
1465,I.,"Where lay the shallows of the maid,"
1466,I.,No plummet line the wife may sound;
1467,I.,Where round the sunny islands played
1468,I.,"The pulses of the great profound,"
1469,I.,Lies low the treacherous everglade.
1470,I.,
1471,I.,"And sailing, he becomes, perforce,"
1472,I.,Discoverer of a lovely world;
1473,I.,"And finds, whate'er may be his course,"
1474,I.,"Green lands within white seas impearled,"
1475,I.,And streams of unsuspected source
1476,I.,
1477,I.,"Which feed with gold delicious fruits,"
1478,I.,"Kept by unguessed Hesperides,"
1479,I.,Or cool the lips of gentle brutes
1480,I.,That breed and browse among the trees
1481,I.,"Whose wind-tossed limbs and leaves are lutes,"
1482,I.,
1483,I.,"The maiden free, the maiden wed,"
1484,I.,"Can never, never be the same."
1485,I.,"A new life springs from out the dead,"
1486,I.,"And, with the speaking of a name,"
1487,I.,"A breath upon the marriage-bed,"
1488,I.,
1489,I.,She finds herself a something new--
1490,I.,"(Which he learns later, but no less);"
1491,I.,"And good and evil, false and true,"
1492,I.,May change their features--who can guess?--
1493,I.,"Seen close, or from another view."
1494,I.,
1495,I.,"For maiden life, with all its fire,"
1496,I.,"Is hid within a grated cell,"
1497,I.,Where every fancy and desire
1498,I.,"And graceless passion, guarded well,"
1499,I.,Sits dumb behind the woven wire.
1500,I.,
1501,I.,Marriage is freedom: only when
1502,I.,The husband turns the prison-key
1503,I.,Knows she herself; nor even then

1512,I.,
1513,I.,Tears spring beneath a careless touch;
1514,I.,Endurance hardens with a word;
1515,I.,She holds a trifle with a clutch
1516,I.,"So strangely, childishly absurd,"
1517,I.,That he who loves and pardons much
1518,I.,
1519,I.,"Doubts if her wayward wit be sane,"
1520,I.,When straight beyond his manly power
1521,I.,She stiffens to the awful strain
1522,I.,"Of some supreme or crucial hour,"
1523,I.,And stands unblanched in fiercest pain!
1524,I.,
1525,I.,"A jealous thought, a petty pique,"
1526,I.,"Enwraps in gloom, or bursts in storm;"
1527,I.,"She questions all that love may speak,"
1528,I.,"And weighs its tone, and marks its form,"
1529,I.,Or yields her frailty to a freak
1530,I.,
1531,I.,That vexes him or breeds disgust;
1532,I.,"Then rises in heroic flame,"
1533,I.,"And treads a danger into dust,"
1534,I.,Or puts his doubting soul to shame
1535,I.,With love unfeigned and perfect trust.
1536,I.,
1537,I.,Still seas unknown the husband sails;
1538,I.,Life-long the lovely marvel lasts;
1539,I.,"In golden calms or driving gales,"
1540,I.,"With silent prow, or reeling masts,"
1541,I.,Each hour a fresh surprise unveils.
1542,I.,
1543,I.,"The brooding, threatening bank of mist"
1544,I.,"Grows into groups of virid isles,"
1545,I.,"By sea embraced and sunlight kissed,"
1546,I.,Or breaks into resplendent smiles
1547,I.,Of cinnabar and amethyst!
1548,I.,
1549,I.,"No day so bright but scuds may fall,"
1550,I.,No day so still but winds may blow;
1551,I.,No morn so dismal with the pall
1552,I.,"Of wintry storm, but stars may glow"
1553,I.,"When evening gathers, over all!"
1554,I.,
1555,I.,"And so thought Philip, when, in haste"
1556,I.,Returning from his lengthened stay--
1557,I.,The river and the lawn retraced--
1558,I.,"He found his Mildred blithe and gay,"
1559,I.,And all his anxious care a waste.
1560,I.,
1561,I.,To be half vexed that she could thrive
1562,I.,"Without him through a morning's span,"
1563,I.,"Upon the honey in her hive,"
1564,I.,"Was but to prove himself a man,"
1565,I.,And show that he was quite alive!
1566,I.,
1567,I.,
1568,I.,
1569,II.,II.
1570,II.,
1571,II.,"A sympathetic word or kiss,"
1572,II.,"(Mildred had insight to discern,)"
1573,II.,"Though grateful quite, is quite amiss,"
1574,II.,In leading to the life etern
1575,II.,The soul that has no bread in this.
1576,II.,
1577,II.,"The present want must aye be fed,"
1578,II.,And first relieved the present care:
1579,II.,"""Give us this day our daily bread"""
1580,II.,Must be recited in our prayer
1581,II.,"Before ""forgive us"" may be said."
1582,II.,
1583,II.,"And he who lifts a soul from vice,"
1584,II.,And leads the way to better lands;
1585,II.,"Must part his raiment, share his slice,"
1586,II.,"And oft with weary, bleeding hands,"
1587,II.,Pave the long path with sacrifice.
1588,II.,
1589,II.,"So on a pleasant summer morn,"
1590,II.,"Wrapped in her motive, sweet and safe,"
1591,II.,"She sought the homes of sin and scorn,"
1592,II.,And found her little Sunday waif
1593,II.,"Ragged, and hungry, and forlorn."
1594,II.,
1595,II.,She called her quickly to her knee;
1596,II.,And with her came a motley troop
1597,II.,"Of children, poor and foul as she,"
1598,II.,"Who gathered in a curious group,"
1599,II.,"And ceased their play, to hear and see."
1600,II.,
1601,II.,"Tanned brown by all the summer suns,"
1602,II.,"With brutish brows and vacant eyes,"
1603,II.,"They drank her speech and ate her buns,"
1604,II.,While she behind their sad disguise
1605,II.,"Beheld her dear Lord's ""little ones."""
1606,II.,
1607,II.,"She stood like Ruth amid the wheat,"
1608,II.,"With ready hand and sickle keen,"
1609,II.,And looked on all with aspect sweet;
1610,II.,"For where she only thought to glean,"
1611,II.,She found a harvest round her feet.
1612,II.,
1613,II.,Ah! little need the tale to write
1614,II.,"Of garments begged from door to door,"
1615,II.,"Of needles plying in the night,"
1616,II.,And money gathered from the store
1617,II.,"Alike of screw and Sybarite,"
1618,II.,
1619,II.,With which to clothe the little flock.
1620,II.,She went like one sent forth of God
1621,II.,"To loose the bolts of heart and lock,"
1622,II.,And with the smiting of her rod
1623,II.,To call a flood from every rock.
1624,II.,
1625,II.,And little need the tale to tell
1626,II.,"How, when the Sunday came again,"
1627,II.,"A wondrous change the group befell,"
1628,II.,"And how from every noisome den,"
1629,II.,"Responding to the chapel bell,"
1630,II.,
1631,II.,"They issued forth with shout and call,"
1632,II.,"And Mildred walking at their head,"
1633,II.,"Who, with her silken parasol,"
1634,II.,"Bannered the army that she led,"
1635,II.,And with low words commanded all.
1636,II.,
1637,II.,The little army walked through smiles
1638,II.,"That hung like lamps above their march,"
1639,II.,"And lit their swart and straggling files,"
1640,II.,While bending elm and plumy larch
1641,II.,Shaped into broad cathedral aisles
1642,II.,
1643,II.,The paths that led with devious trend
1644,II.,"To where the ivied chapel stood,"
1645,II.,"There their long passage found its end,"
1646,II.,And there they gathered in a brood
1647,II.,Of gentle clamor round their friend.
1648,II.,
1649,II.,A score pressed in on either side
1650,II.,"To share the burden of her care,"
1651,II.,And hearts and house gave entrance wide
1652,II.,To those to whom the words of prayer
1653,II.,Were stranger than the curse of pride.
1654,II.,
1655,II.,"And Mildred who, without a thought"
1656,II.,"Of glory in her week's long task,"
1657,II.,"This marvel of the week had wrought,"
1658,II.,"Had earned the boon she would not ask,"
1659,II.,And won more love than she had sought.
1660,II.,
1661,II.,
1662,II.,
1663,III.,III.
1664,III.,
1665,III.,"As two who walk through forest aisles,"
1666,III.,"Lit all the way by forest flowers,"
1667,III.,Divide at morn through twin defiles
1668,III.,"To meet again in distant hours,"
1669,III.,"With plunder plucked from all the miles,"
1670,III.,
1671,III.,So Philip and his Mildred went
1672,III.,"Into their walks of daily life,--"
1673,III.,"Parting at morn with sweet consent,"
1674,III.,"And--tireless husband, busy wife--"
1675,III.,"Together when the day was spent,"
1676,III.,
1677,III.,Bringing the treasures they had won
1678,III.,"From sundered tracks of enterprise,"
1679,III.,"To learn from each what each had done,"
1680,III.,And prove each other grown more wise
1681,III.,Than when the morning was begun.
1682,III.,
1683,III.,He strengthened her with manly thought
1684,III.,"And learning, gathered from the great;"
1685,III.,"And she, whose quicker eye had caught"
1686,III.,The treasures of the broad estate
1687,III.,"Of common life and learning, brought"
1688,III.,
1689,III.,"Her gleanings from the level field,"
1690,III.,"And gave them gladly to his hands,"
1691,III.,Who had not dreamed that they could yield
1692,III.,"Such sheaves, or hold within their bands"
1693,III.,Such wealth of lovely flowers concealed.
1694,III.,
1695,III.,"His grave discourse, his judgment sure,"
1696,III.,"Gave tone and temper to her soul,"
1697,III.,"While her swift thoughts and vision pure,"
1698,III.,"And mirth that would not brook control,"
1699,III.,And wit that kept him insecure
1700,III.,
1701,III.,"Within his dignified repose,"
1702,III.,Refreshed and quickened him like wine.
1703,III.,No tender word or dainty gloze
1704,III.,Could give him pleasure half so fine
1705,III.,As that which tingled to her blows.
1706,III.,
1707,III.,"He gave her food for heart and mind,"
1708,III.,And raised her toward his higher plane;
1709,III.,She showed him that his eyes were blind;
1710,III.,"She proved his lofty wisdom vain,"
1711,III.,And held him humbly with his kind.
1712,III.,
1713,III.,
1714,III.,
1715,IV.,IV.
1716,IV.,
1717,IV.,Oh blessed sleep! in which exempt
1718,IV.,"From our tired selves long hours we lie,"
1719,IV.,"Our vapid worthlessness undreamt,"
1720,IV.,And our poor spirits saved thereby
1721,IV.,From perishing of self-contempt!
1722,IV.,
1723,IV.,We weary of our petty aims;
1724,IV.,We sicken with our selfish deeds;
1725,IV.,"We shrink and shrivel, in the flames"
1726,IV.,"That low desire ignites and feeds,"
1727,IV.,And grudge the debt that duty claims.
1728,IV.,
1729,IV.,Oh sweet forgetfulness of sleep!
1730,IV.,"Oh bliss, to drop the pride of dress,"
1731,IV.,"And all the shams o'er which we weep,"
1732,IV.,"And, toward our native nothingness,"
1733,IV.,To drop ten thousand fathoms deep!
1734,IV.,
1735,IV.,"At morning only--strong, erect--"
1736,IV.,We face our mirrors not ashamed;
1737,IV.,For then alone we meet unflecked
1738,IV.,"The image we at evening blamed,"
1739,IV.,And find refreshed our self-respect.
1740,IV.,
1741,IV.,"Ah! little wonderment that those,"
1742,IV.,"Who see us most and love us best,"
1743,IV.,Find that a true affection grows
1744,IV.,"The more when, in its parted nest,"
1745,IV.,It spends long hours in lone repose!
1746,IV.,
1747,IV.,Our fruit grows dead in pulp and rind
1748,IV.,When seen and handled overmuch;
1749,IV.,"The roses fade, our fingers bind;"
1750,IV.,And with familiar kiss and touch
1751,IV.,The graces wither from our kind.
1752,IV.,
1753,IV.,"Man lives on love, at love's expense,"
1754,IV.,"And woman, so her love be sweet;"
1755,IV.,Best honey palls upon the sense
1756,IV.,When it is tempted to repeat
1757,IV.,Too oft its fine experience.
1758,IV.,
1759,IV.,"And Mildred, with instinctive skill,"
1760,IV.,"And loving neither most nor least,"
1761,IV.,"Stood out from Philip's grasping will,"
1762,IV.,"And gave, where he desired a feast,"
1763,IV.,The taste that left him hungry still.
1764,IV.,
1765,IV.,"She hid her heart behind a mask,"
1766,IV.,And held him to his manly course;
1767,IV.,"One hour in love she bade him bask,"
1768,IV.,"And then she drove, with playful force,"
1769,IV.,The laggard to his daily task.
1770,IV.,
1771,IV.,"They went their way and kept their care,"
1772,IV.,"And met again their toil complete,"
1773,IV.,"Like angels on a heavenly stair,"
1774,IV.,"Or pilgrims in a golden street,"
1775,IV.,"Grown stronger one, and one more fair!"
1776,IV.,
1777,IV.,
1778,IV.,
1779,V.,V.
1780,V.,
1781,V.,"As one worn down by petty pains,"
1782,V.,"With fevered head and restless limb,"
1783,V.,"Flies from the toil that stings and stains,"
1784,V.,"And all the cares that wearied him,"
1785,V.,"And same far, silent summit gains;"
1786,V.,
1787,V.,"And in its strong, sweet atmosphere,"
1788,V.,"Or in the blue, or in the green,"
1789,V.,"Finds his discomforts disappear,"
1790,V.,And loses in the pure serene
1791,V.,The garnered humors of a year;
1792,V.,
1793,V.,And sees not how and knows not when
1794,V.,"The old vexations leave their seat,"
1795,V.,"So Philip, happiest of men,"
1796,V.,"Saw all his petty cares retreat,"
1797,V.,"And vanish, not to come again."
1798,V.,
1799,V.,"Where he had thought to shield and serve,"
1800,V.,"Himself had ministry instead,"
1801,V.,He heard no vexing call to swerve
1802,V.,"From larger toil, for labors sped"
1803,V.,By smaller hand and finer nerve.
1804,V.,
1805,V.,In deft and deferential ways
1806,V.,She took the house by silent siege;
1807,V.,"And Dinah, warmest in her praise,"
1808,V.,"Grew, unaware, her loyal liege,"
1809,V.,And served her truly all her days.
1810,V.,
1811,V.,"And many a sad and stricken maid,"
1812,V.,And many a lorn and widowed life
1813,V.,That came for counsel or for aid
1814,V.,"To Philip, met the pastor's wife,"
1815,V.,And on her heart their burden laid.
1816,V.,
1817,V.,
1818,V.,
1819,VI.,VI.
1820,VI.,
1821,VI.,He gave her what she took--her will;
1822,VI.,And made it space for life full-orbed.
1823,VI.,He learned at last that every rill
1824,VI.,"Loses its freshness, when absorbed"
1825,VI.,By the great stream that turns the mill.
1826,VI.,
1827,VI.,"With hand ungrasping for her dower,"
1828,VI.,He found its royal income his;
1829,VI.,And every swiftly kindling power--
1830,VI.,Self-moved in its activities--
1831,VI.,Becoming brighter every hour.
1832,VI.,
1833,VI.,The air is sweet which we inspire
1834,VI.,When it is free to come and go;
1835,VI.,And sound of brook and scent of briar
1836,VI.,"Rise freshest where the breezes blow,"
1837,VI.,That feed our breath and fan our fire.
1838,VI.,
1839,VI.,That love is weak which is too strong;
1840,VI.,A man may be a woman's grave;
1841,VI.,"The right of love swells oft to wrong,"
1842,VI.,And silken bonds may bind a slave
1843,VI.,As truly as a leathern thong.
1844,VI.,
1845,VI.,We may not dine upon the bird
1846,VI.,That fills our home with minstrelsy;
1847,VI.,The living vine may never gird
1848,VI.,"Too firm and close the living tree,"
1849,VI.,Without sad sacrifice incurred.
1850,VI.,
1851,VI.,The crystal goblet that we drain
1852,VI.,Will be forever after dry;
1853,VI.,"But he who sips, and sips again,"
1854,VI.,"And leaves it to the open sky,"
1855,VI.,Will find it filled with dew and rain.
1856,VI.,
1857,VI.,"The lilies burst, the roses blow"
1858,VI.,"Into divinest balm and bloom,"
1859,VI.,When free above and free below;
1860,VI.,"And life and love must have large room,"
1861,VI.,That life and love may largest grow.
1862,VI.,
1863,VI.,"So Philip learned (what Mildred saw),"
1864,VI.,"That love was like a well profound,"
1865,VI.,"From which two souls had right to draw,"
1866,VI.,And in whose waters would be drowned
1867,VI.,The one who took the other's law.
1868,VI.,
1869,VI.,
1870,VI.,
1871,VII.,VII.
1872,VII.,
1873,VII.,"Ambition was an alien word,"
1874,VII.,Which Mildred faintly understood;
1875,VII.,Its poisoned breathing had not blurred
1876,VII.,"The whiteness of her womanhood,"
1877,VII.,Nor had its blatant trumpet stirred
1878,VII.,
1879,VII.,To quicker pulse her heart content.
1880,VII.,"In social tasks and home employ,"
1881,VII.,She did not question what it meant;
1882,VII.,But bore her woman's lot with joy
1883,VII.,"And sweetness, wheresoe'er she went."
1884,VII.,
1885,VII.,If ever with unconscious thrill
1886,VII.,"It touched her, in some vagrant dream,"
1887,VII.,She only wished that God would fill
1888,VII.,With larger tide the goodly stream
1889,VII.,"That flowed beside her, strong and still."
1890,VII.,
1891,VII.,"She knew that love was more than fame,"
1892,VII.,And happy conscience more than love;--
1893,VII.,"Far off and wild, the wings of flame!"
1894,VII.,"Close by, the pinions of the dove"
1895,VII.,That hovered white above her name!
1896,VII.,
1897,VII.,"She honored Philip as a man,"
1898,VII.,And joyed in his supreme estate;
1899,VII.,But never dreamed that under ban
1900,VII.,"She lives who never can be great,"
1901,VII.,Or chieftain of a crowd or clan.
1902,VII.,
1903,VII.,The public eye was like a knife
1904,VII.,That pierced and plagued her shrinking heart.
1905,VII.,"To be a woman, and a wife,"
1906,VII.,"With privilege to dwell apart,"
1907,VII.,And hold unseen her modest life--
1908,VII.,
1909,VII.,"Alike from praise and blame aloof,"
1910,VII.,And free to live and move in peace
1911,VII.,Beneath love's consecrated roof--
1912,VII.,Was boon so great she could not cease
1913,VII.,Her thanks for the divine behoof.
1914,VII.,
1915,VII.,Black turns to brown and blue to blight
1916,VII.,Beneath the blemish of the sun;
1917,VII.,"And e'en the spotless robe of white,"
1918,VII.,"Worn overlong, grows dim and dun"
1919,VII.,Through the strange alchemy of light.
1920,VII.,
1921,VII.,"Nor wives nor maidens, weak or brave,"
1922,VII.,"Can stand and face the public stare,"
1923,VII.,"And win the plaudits that they crave,"
1924,VII.,"And stem the hisses that they dare,"
1925,VII.,And modest truth and beauty save.
1926,VII.,
1927,VII.,"No woman, in her soul, is she"
1928,VII.,Who longs to poise above the roar
1929,VII.,"Of motley multitudes, and be"
1930,VII.,The idol at whose feet they pour
1931,VII.,The wine of their idolatry.
1932,VII.,
1933,VII.,Coarse labor makes its doer coarse;
1934,VII.,Great burdens harden softest hands;
1935,VII.,A gentle voice grows harsh and hoarse
1936,VII.,That warns and threatens and commands
1937,VII.,Beyond the measure of its force.
1938,VII.,
1939,VII.,"Oh sweet, beyond all speech, to feel"
1940,VII.,"Within no answer to the drum,"
1941,VII.,"Or echo to the bugle-peal,"
1942,VII.,That calls to duties which benumb
1943,VII.,In service of the commonweal!
1944,VII.,
1945,VII.,"Oh sweet to feel, beyond all speech,"
1946,VII.,That most and best of human kind
1947,VII.,Have leave to live beyond the reach
1948,VII.,"Of toil that tarnishes, and find"
1949,VII.,No tongue but Envy's to impeach!
1950,VII.,
1951,VII.,"Oh sweet, that most unnoticed deeds"
1952,VII.,"Give play to fine, heroic blood!--"
1953,VII.,"That hid from light, and shut from weeds,"
1954,VII.,The rose is fairer in its bud
1955,VII.,Than in the blossom that succeeds!
1956,VII.,
1957,VII.,He is the helpless slave who must;
1958,VII.,And she enfranchised who may sit
1959,VII.,"Unblamed above the din and dust,"
1960,VII.,Where stronger hands and coarser wit
1961,VII.,Strive equally for crown and crust.
1962,VII.,
1963,VII.,"So ran her thought, and broader yet,"
1964,VII.,Who scanned her own by Philip's pace;
1965,VII.,And never did the wife forget
1966,VII.,Her grateful tribute for the grace
1967,VII.,That charged her with so sweet a debt.
1968,VII.,
1969,VII.,So ran her thought; and in her breast
1970,VII.,"Her wifely pride to pity grew,"
1971,VII.,"That Philip, by his Lord's behest--"
1972,VII.,To duty and to nature true--
1973,VII.,Must do his bravest and his best.
1974,VII.,
1975,VII.,"Through winter's cold and summer's heat,"
1976,VII.,"Where all might praise and all might blame,"
1977,VII.,"And thus be topic of the street,"
1978,VII.,And see his fair and honest name
1979,VII.,"A football, kicked by careless feet."
1980,VII.,
1981,VII.,"She loved her creed, and doubting not"
1982,VII.,"She read it well from Nature's scroll,"
1983,VII.,She found no line or word to blot;
1984,VII.,"But, from her woman's modest soul,"
1985,VII.,Thanked her Creator for her lot.
1986,VII.,
1987,VII.,
1988,VII.,
1989,VIII.,VIII.
1990,VIII.,
1991,VIII.,"He who, upon an Alpine peak,"
1992,VIII.,"Stands, when the sunrise lifts the East,"
1993,VIII.,And gilds the crown and lights the cheek
1994,VIII.,"Of largest monarch down to least,"
1995,VIII.,"Of all the summits cold and bleak,"
1996,VIII.,
1997,VIII.,Finds sadly that it brings no boon
1998,VIII.,"For all his long and toilsome leagues,"
1999,VIII.,"And chill at once and weary soon,"
2000,VIII.,"Rests from his fevers and fatigues,"
2001,VIII.,"And waits the recompense of noon,"
2002,VIII.,
2003,VIII.,"For then the valleys, near and far,"
2004,VIII.,"The hillsides, fretted by the vine,"
2005,VIII.,The glacier-drift and torrent-scar
2006,VIII.,"Whose restless waters shoot and shine,"
2007,VIII.,"And many a tarn, that like a star"
2008,VIII.,
2009,VIII.,"Trembles and flames with stress of light,"
2010,VIII.,And many a hamlet and chalet
2011,VIII.,"That dots with brown, or paints with white,"
2012,VIII.,"The landscape quivering in the day,"
2013,VIII.,With beauty all his toil requite.
2014,VIII.,
2015,VIII.,"Mountains, from mountain altitudes"
2016,VIII.,"Are only hills, as bleak and bare;"
2017,VIII.,And he whose daring step intrudes
2018,VIII.,"Upon their grandeur, and the rare"
2019,VIII.,"Cold light or gloom that o'er them broods,"
2020,VIII.,
2021,VIII.,Finds that with even brow to stand
2022,VIII.,"Among the heights that bade him climb,"
2023,VIII.,"Is loss of all that made them grand,"
2024,VIII.,While all of lovely and sublime
2025,VIII.,Looks up to him from lake and land.
2026,VIII.,
2027,VIII.,"Great men are few, and stand apart;"
2028,VIII.,And seem divinest when remote.
2029,VIII.,"From brain to brain, and heart to heart,"
2030,VIII.,No thoughts of genial commerce float;
2031,VIII.,Each holds his own exclusive mart.
2032,VIII.,
2033,VIII.,"And when we meet them, face to face,"
2034,VIII.,"And hand to hand their greatness greet,"
2035,VIII.,"Our steps we willingly retrace,"
2036,VIII.,"And gather humbly at their feet,"
2037,VIII.,With those who live upon their grace.
2038,VIII.,
2039,VIII.,And man and woman--mount and vale--
2040,VIII.,"Have charms, each from the other seen,--"
2041,VIII.,"The robe of rose, the coat of mail:"
2042,VIII.,"The springing turf, the black ravine:"
2043,VIII.,"The tossing pines, the waving swale:"
2044,VIII.,
2045,VIII.,Which please the sight with constant joy.
2046,VIII.,"Thus living, each has power to call"
2047,VIII.,"The other's thoughts with sweet decoy,"
2048,VIII.,And one can rise and one can fall
2049,VIII.,But to distemper or destroy.
2050,VIII.,
2051,VIII.,The dewy meadow breeds the cloud
2052,VIII.,"That rises on ethereal wings,"
2053,VIII.,And wraps the mountain in a shroud
2054,VIII.,From which the living lightning springs
2055,VIII.,"And torrents pour, that, lithe and loud,"
2056,VIII.,
2057,VIII.,"Leap down in service to the plains,"
2058,VIII.,Or feed the fountains at their source;
2059,VIII.,And only thus the mountain gains
2060,VIII.,The vital fulness of the force
2061,VIII.,That fills the meadow's myriad veins.
2062,VIII.,
2063,VIII.,"In fair, reciprocal exchange"
2064,VIII.,"Of good which each appropriates,"
2065,VIII.,The meadow and the mountain-range
2066,VIII.,Nourish their beautiful estates;
2067,VIII.,And lofty wild and lowly grange
2068,VIII.,
2069,VIII.,Thrive on the commerce thus ordained;
2070,VIII.,"And not a reek ascends the rock,"
2071,VIII.,"And not a drift of dew is rained,"
2072,VIII.,But eyrie-brood and tended flock
2073,VIII.,By the sweet gift is entertained.
2074,VIII.,
2075,VIII.,"A meadow may be fair and broad,"
2076,VIII.,And hold a river in its rest;
2077,VIII.,"Or small, arid with the silver gaud"
2078,VIII.,"Of a lone lakelet on its breast,"
2079,VIII.,"Or but a patch, that, overawed,"
2080,VIII.,
2081,VIII.,Clings humbly to the mountain's hem:
2082,VIII.,It matters not: it is the charm
2083,VIII.,"That cheers his life, and holds the stem"
2084,VIII.,"Of every flower that tempts his arm,"
2085,VIII.,Or greets his snowy diadem.
2086,VIII.,
2087,VIII.,"Dolts talk of largest and of least,"
2088,VIII.,And worse than dolts are they who prate
2089,VIII.,Of Beauty captive to the Beast;
2090,VIII.,"For man in woman finds his mate,"
2091,VIII.,And thrones her equal at his feast.
2092,VIII.,
2093,VIII.,"She matches meekness with his might,"
2094,VIII.,"And patience with his power to act,--"
2095,VIII.,His judgment with her quicker sight;
2096,VIII.,And wins by subtlety and tact
2097,VIII.,The battles he can only fight.
2098,VIII.,
2099,VIII.,And she who strives to take the van
2100,VIII.,"In conflict, or the common way,"
2101,VIII.,"Does outrage to the heavenly plan,"
2102,VIII.,And outrage to the finer clay
2103,VIII.,That makes her beautiful to man.
2104,VIII.,
2105,VIII.,"All this, and more than this, she saw"
2106,VIII.,Who reigned in Philip's house and heart.
2107,VIII.,"Far off, he seemed without a flaw;"
2108,VIII.,"Close by, her tasteless counterpart,"
2109,VIII.,And slave to Nature's common law.
2110,VIII.,
2111,VIII.,"To climb with fierce, familiar stride"
2112,VIII.,"His dizzy paths of life and thought,"
2113,VIII.,"Would but degrade him from her pride,"
2114,VIII.,And bring the majesty to naught
2115,VIII.,Which love and distance magnified.
2116,VIII.,
2117,VIII.,"If she should grow like him, she knew"
2118,VIII.,He would admire and love her less;
2119,VIII.,"The eagle's image might be true,"
2120,VIII.,But eagle of the wilderness
2121,VIII.,Would find no consort in the view.
2122,VIII.,
2123,VIII.,"A woman, in her woman's sphere,"
2124,VIII.,"A loyal wife and worshipper,"
2125,VIII.,She only thirsted to appear
2126,VIII.,"As fair to him as he to her,"
2127,VIII.,"And fairer still, from year to year."
2128,VIII.,
2129,VIII.,And he who quickly learned to purge
2130,VIII.,His fancy of the tender whim
2131,VIII.,That she was floating at the verge
2132,VIII.,"Of womanhood, half hid to him,"
2133,VIII.,"Saw her with gracious mien emerge,"
2134,VIII.,
2135,VIII.,"And stand full-robed upon the shore,"
2136,VIII.,With faculties and charms unguessed;
2137,VIII.,"With wondrous eyes that looked before,"
2138,VIII.,And hands that helped and words that blessed--
2139,VIII.,The mistress of an alien lore
2140,VIII.,
2141,VIII.,Beyond the wisdom of the schools
2142,VIII.,And all his manly power to win;
2143,VIII.,With handicraft of tricks and tools
2144,VIII.,"That conjured marvels with a pin,"
2145,VIII.,And miracles with skeins and spools!
2146,VIII.,
2147,VIII.,She seemed to mock his dusty dearth
2148,VIII.,With flowers that sprang beneath his eyes;
2149,VIII.,"Till all he was, seemed little worth,"
2150,VIII.,"And she he deemed so little wise,"
2151,VIII.,Became the wisest of the earth.
2152,VIII.,
2153,VIII.,"In all the struggles of his soul,"
2154,VIII.,"And all the strifes his soul abhorred,"
2155,VIII.,She shone before him like a goal--
2156,VIII.,A shady power of fresh reward--
2157,VIII.,"A shallop riding in the mole,"
2158,VIII.,
2159,VIII.,That waited with obedient helm
2160,VIII.,"To bear him over sparkling seas,"
2161,VIII.,"Into a new and fragrant realm,"
2162,VIII.,Before the vigor of a breeze
2163,VIII.,"That drove, but would not overwhelm."

2166,IX.,
2167,IX.,The river of their life was one;
2168,IX.,"The shores, down which they passed were two;"
2169,IX.,"One mirrored mountains, huge and dun,"
2170,IX.,"The other crimped the green and blue,"
2171,IX.,And sparkled in the kindly sun!
2172,IX.,
2173,IX.,"Twin barks, with answering flags, they moved"
2174,IX.,"With even canvas down the stream,"
2175,IX.,"In smooth or ruffled waters grooved,"
2176,IX.,And found such islands in their dream
2177,IX.,As rest and loving speech behooved.
2178,IX.,
2179,IX.,Ah fair the goodly gardens smiled
2180,IX.,On Philip at his rougher strand!
2181,IX.,"And grandly loomed the summits, isled"
2182,IX.,"In seas of cloud, to her who scanned"
2183,IX.,From her far shore the lofty wild.
2184,IX.,
2185,IX.,"Two lives, two loves--both self-forgot"
2186,IX.,In loving homage to their oath;
2187,IX.,"Two lives, two loves, but living not"
2188,IX.,By ministry that reached them both
2189,IX.,"In service of a common lot,"
2190,IX.,
2191,IX.,"They sailed the stream, and every mile"
2192,IX.,Broadened with beauty as they passed;
2193,IX.,"And fruitful shore and trysting-isle,"
2194,IX.,And all love's intercourse were glassed
2195,IX.,And blessed in Heaven's benignant smile.

2203,X.,"And answers to its breath alone,"
2204,X.,
2205,X.,"Turns with aversion from the breeze,"
2206,X.,And stretches all its stunted limbs
2207,X.,"Landward and heavenward, toward the trees"
2208,X.,"That listen to a thousand hymns,"
2209,X.,And grow to grander destinies.
2210,X.,
2211,X.,"Man may not live on whitest loaves,"
2212,X.,With all of coarser good dismissed;

2214,X.,"Beyond the holy eucharist,"
2215,X.,To gather of the fields and groves.
2216,X.,
2217,X.,And he who seeks to fill his heart
2218,X.,"With solace of a single friend,"
2219,X.,"Will find refreshment but in part,"
2220,X.,"Or, sadder still, will find the end"
2221,X.,Of all his reach of thought and art.
2222,X.,
2223,X.,They who love best need friendship most;
2224,X.,Hearts only thrive on varied good;
2225,X.,And he who gathers from a host
2226,X.,"Of friendly hearts his daily food,"
2227,X.,Is the best friend that we can boast.
2228,X.,
2229,X.,She left her husband with his friends;
2230,X.,She called them round him at her board;
2231,X.,And found their culture made amends
2232,X.,"For all the time that, from her hoard,"
2233,X.,She spared him for these nobler ends.
2234,X.,
2235,X.,He was her lover; that sufficed:
2236,X.,His home was in the Holy Place
2237,X.,With that of the Beloved Christ;
2238,X.,And friendship had no subtle grace
2239,X.,By which his love could be enticed.
2240,X.,
2241,X.,"Of all his friends, she was but one:"
2242,X.,She held with them a common field.
2243,X.,"Exclusive right, with love begun,"
2244,X.,"Ended with love, and stood repealed,"
2245,X.,Leaving his friendship free to run
2246,X.,
2247,X.,"Toward man or woman, all unmissed."
2248,X.,She knew she had no right to bind
2249,X.,"His friendship to her single wrist,"
2250,X.,"So long as love was true and kind,"
2251,X.,"And made her its monopolist,"
2252,X.,
2253,X.,No time was grudged with jealous greed
2254,X.,Which either books or friendship claimed.
2255,X.,"He was her friend, and she had need"
2256,X.,Of all--unhindered and unblamed
2257,X.,"That he could win, through word or deed."
2258,X.,
2259,X.,Her friend waxed great as grew the man;
2260,X.,Her temple swelled as rose her priest--
2261,X.,With power to bless and right to ban--
2262,X.,"And all who served him, most or least,--"
2263,X.,From chorister and sacristan
2264,X.,
2265,X.,To those whose frankincense and myrrh
2266,X.,"Perfumed the sacred courts with alms,--"

2318,II.,She sailed all whiles from crest to crest
2319,II.,"Of a broad ocean, through whose gleams"

2321,II.,
2322,II.,"And as she drove across the sea,"

2526,VI.,"Of gushing rocks and raining corn,"
2527,VI.,"And fire and cloud, and lengthened sweep"
2528,VI.,"Of thousands toward the promised morn,"
2529,VI.,Across the wilderness of sleep!
2530,VI.,
2531,VI.,
2532,VI.,
2533,VII.,VII.
2534,VII.,
2535,VII.,The years rolled on in grand routine
2536,VII.,"Of useful toil and chastening care,"
2537,VII.,"Till Philip, grown to heights, serene"
2538,VII.,"Of conscious power, and ripe with prayer,"
2539,VII.,Took on the strong and stately mien
2540,VII.,
2541,VII.,Of one on whom had been conferred
2542,VII.,The doing of a knightly deed;
2543,VII.,And waited till it bade him gird
2544,VII.,"The harness on him and his steed,"
2545,VII.,For man and for his Master's word.
2546,VII.,
2547,VII.,"His name was spoken far and near,"
2548,VII.,And sounded sweet on every tongue;
2549,VII.,"Men knew him only to revere,"
2550,VII.,"And those who knew him nearest, flung"
2551,VII.,"Their hearts before his grand career,"
2552,VII.,
2553,VII.,And paved his way with loyal trust.
2554,VII.,"He was their strongest, noblest man,--"
2555,VII.,"Sworn foe of every selfish lust,"
2556,VII.,"And brave to do as wise to plan,"
2557,VII.,And swift to judge as pure and just.
2558,VII.,
2559,VII.,
2560,VII.,
2561,VIII.,VIII.
2562,VIII.,
2563,VIII.,Against such foil the mistress stood--
2564,VIII.,A pearl upon a cross of gold--
2565,VIII.,"White with consistent womanhood,"
2566,VIII.,And fixed with unrelaxing hold
2567,VIII.,Upon the centre of the rood!
2568,VIII.,
2569,VIII.,"Through all those years of loving thrift,"
2570,VIII.,Nor blame nor discord marred their lot;
2571,VIII.,Each to the lover-life was gift;
2572,VIII.,And each was free from blur or blot
2573,VIII.,That called for silence or for shrift.
2574,VIII.,
2575,VIII.,Each bore the burden that it held
2576,VIII.,With patient hands along the road;
2577,VIII.,"And though, with passing years, it swelled"
2578,VIII.,"Until it grew a weary load,"
2579,VIII.,"Nor tongue complained, nor heart rebelled."
2580,VIII.,
2581,VIII.,"At length the time of trial came,"
2582,VIII.,And they were tried as gold is tried.
2583,VIII.,"Their peace of life went up in flame,"
2584,VIII.,"And what was good was vilified,"
2585,VIII.,And what was blameless came to blame.
2586,VIII.,
2587,VIII.,
2588,VIII.,
2589,IX.,IX.
2590,IX.,
2591,IX.,The Southern sky was dun with cloud;
2592,IX.,And looming lurid o'er its edge
2593,IX.,"The brows of awful forms were bowed,"
2594,IX.,That forged in flame the fateful wedge
2595,IX.,Which waited in the angry shroud
2596,IX.,
2597,IX.,"The banner of the storm unfurled,"
2598,IX.,And all the powers of death arrayed
2599,IX.,"In black battalions, to be hurled"
2600,IX.,Down through the rack--a blazing blade--
2601,IX.,"To cleave the realm, and shake the world!"
2602,IX.,
2603,IX.,The North was full of nameless dread;
2604,IX.,Wild portents flamed from out the pole;
2605,IX.,"Old scars on Freedom's bosom bled,"
2606,IX.,And sick at heart and vexed of soul
2607,IX.,She tossed in fever on her bed!
2608,IX.,
2609,IX.,Pale Commerce hid her face and whined;
2610,IX.,The arms of Toil were paralyzed;
2611,IX.,"The wise were of divided mind,"
2612,IX.,And those who counselled and advised
2613,IX.,Were sightless leaders of the blind.
2614,IX.,
2615,IX.,Men lost their faith in good and great;
2616,IX.,"No captain sprang, or prophet bard,"
2617,IX.,"To win their trust, and save the state"
2618,IX.,"From the wild storm that, like a pard,"
2619,IX.,On quivering haunches lay in wait!
2620,IX.,
2621,IX.,The loyal only were not brave;
2622,IX.,E'en peace became a cringing dog;
2623,IX.,"The patriot paltered like a knave,"
2624,IX.,And partisan anti demagogue
2625,IX.,Quarrelled o'er Freedom's waiting grave.
2626,IX.,
2627,IX.,
2628,IX.,
2629,X.,X.
2630,X.,
2631,X.,"Amid the turmoil and disgrace,"
2632,X.,"The voice was clear from first to last,"
2633,X.,"Of one who, in the desert place"
2634,X.,"Of barren counsels, held him fast"
2635,X.,"His shepherd's crook, and made it mace"
2636,X.,
2637,X.,To bear before the Great Event
2638,X.,"Whose harbinger he chose to be,"
2639,X.,"And called on all men to repent,"
2640,X.,"And build a way from sea to sea,"
2641,X.,For Freedom's full enfranchisement.
2642,X.,
2643,X.,"For Philip, to his conscience leal,"
2644,X.,Conceived that God had chosen him
2645,X.,"With Treason's sophistries to deal,"
2646,X.,And grapple with the Anakim
2647,X.,Whose menace shook the common weal.
2648,X.,
2649,X.,His pulpit smoked beneath his blows;
2650,X.,His voice was heard in hall and street;
2651,X.,"A thousand friends became his foes,"
2652,X.,"And pews were empty or replete,"
2653,X.,With passion's ebbs and overflows.
2654,X.,
2655,X.,They trailed his good name in the mire;
2656,X.,They spat their venom in his eyes;
2657,X.,They taunted him with mad desire
2658,X.,"For power, and gathered his replies"
2659,X.,"In braver words and fiercer fire,"
2660,X.,
2661,X.,"He was a wolf, disguised in wool;"
2662,X.,He was a viper in the breast;
2663,X.,"He was a villain, or the tool"
2664,X.,"Of greater villains; at the best,"
2665,X.,A blind enthusiast and fool!
2666,X.,
2667,X.,"As swelled the tempest, rose the man;"
2668,X.,He turned to sport their brutal spleen;
2669,X.,And none could choose be slow to span
2670,X.,The difference that lay between
2671,X.,A Prospero and a Caliban!
2672,X.,
2673,X.,
2674,X.,
2675,XI.,XI.
2676,XI.,
2677,XI.,"She would not move him otherwise,"
2678,XI.,Although her heart was sad and sore.
2679,XI.,That which was venal in his eyes
2680,XI.,"To her a lovely aspect wore,"
2681,XI.,And helped to weave the thousand ties
2682,XI.,
2683,XI.,"Which bound her to her youth, and all"
2684,XI.,The loves that she had left behind
2685,XI.,"When, from her father's stately hall,"
2686,XI.,"She came, her Northern home to find,"
2687,XI.,With him who held her heart in thrall.
2688,XI.,
2689,XI.,In the dark pictures which he drew
2690,XI.,"Of instituted shame and wrong,"
2691,XI.,"She saw no figures that she knew,"
2692,XI.,But a confused and hateful throng
2693,XI.,Of forms that in his fancy grew.
2694,XI.,
2695,XI.,"Her father's rule, benign and mild,"
2696,XI.,Was all of slavery she had known;
2697,XI.,"To her, an Afric was a child--"
2698,XI.,A charge in other ages thrown
2699,XI.,"On Christian honor, from the wild"
2700,XI.,
2701,XI.,Of savagery in which the Fates
2702,XI.,Had given him birth and dwelling-place--
2703,XI.,"And so, descending through estates"
2704,XI.,"Of gentle vassalage, his race"
2705,XI.,Had come to those of later dates.
2706,XI.,
2707,XI.,Black hands her baby form had dressed;
2708,XI.,Black hands her blacker hair had curled;
2709,XI.,And she had found a dusky breast
2710,XI.,The sweetest breast in all the world
2711,XI.,When she was thirsty or at rest.
2712,XI.,
2713,XI.,"Her playmates, in her native bowers,"
2714,XI.,"Were Darkest children of the sun,"
2715,XI.,Who built the palaces and towers
2716,XI.,"In which her reign, in love begun,"
2717,XI.,Gave foretaste of love's later hours.
2718,XI.,
2719,XI.,Her memory was full of song
2720,XI.,"That she had learned in house and field,"
2721,XI.,"From those whose days seemed never long,"
2722,XI.,And those who could not hold concealed
2723,XI.,The consciousness of shame and wrong.
2724,XI.,
2725,XI.,A loving ear heard their complaints;
2726,XI.,A faithful tongue advised and warned;
2727,XI.,And grave corrections and restraints
2728,XI.,Were rendered by a heart adorned
2729,XI.,By all the graces of the saints.
2730,XI.,
2731,XI.,There was no touch of memory's chords--
2732,XI.,"No picture on her blooming wall,--"
2733,XI.,Of life upon the sunny swards
2734,XI.,"They reproduced,--but brought recall"
2735,XI.,Of happy slaves and gentle lords.
2736,XI.,
2737,XI.,And Philip charged a deadly sin
2738,XI.,"Upon that beautiful domain,"
2739,XI.,"Condemning all who dwelt therein,"
2740,XI.,And branding with the awful stain
2741,XI.,"Her friends, and all her dearest kin."
2742,XI.,
2743,XI.,
2744,XI.,
2745,XII.,XII.
2746,XII.,
2747,XII.,"Yet still she knew his conscience clear,--"
2748,XII.,That he believed his voice was God's;
2749,XII.,And listened with a voiceless fear
2750,XII.,To the portentous periods
2751,XII.,In which he preached the chosen year
2752,XII.,
2753,XII.,"Of expiation and release,"
2754,XII.,"And prophesied that Slavery's power,"
2755,XII.,"Grown great apace with crime's increase,"
2756,XII.,"Before the front of Right should cower,"
2757,XII.,And bid God's people go in peace!
2758,XII.,
2759,XII.,The fierce invectives of his tongue
2760,XII.,"Frayed every day her wounds afresh,"
2761,XII.,"And with new pain her bosom wrung,"
2762,XII.,"For they envenomed kindred flesh,"
2763,XII.,To which in sympathy she clung.
2764,XII.,
2765,XII.,Yet not a finger did she lift
2766,XII.,"To hold him from his fateful task,"
2767,XII.,Though Satan oft essayed to sift
2768,XII.,"Her soul as wheat, and bade her ask"
2769,XII.,Somewhat from conscience as a gift.
2770,XII.,
2771,XII.,And when a serpent in his slime
2772,XII.,"Crept to her ear with phrase polite,"
2773,XII.,Prating of duty to her time
2774,XII.,"And to her people, swift and white"
2775,XII.,She turned and cursed him for his crime!
2776,XII.,
2777,XII.,She would have naught of all the brood
2778,XII.,"Of temporizing, driveling shows"
2779,XII.,Of men who Philip's words withstood:
2780,XII.,"Against them all her love uprose,"
2781,XII.,And all her pride of womanhood.
2782,XII.,
2783,XII.,
2784,XII.,
2785,XIII.,XIII.
2786,XIII.,
2787,XIII.,"She loved her kindred none the less,"
2788,XIII.,"She loved her husband still the more,"
2789,XIII.,For well she knew that with distress
2790,XIII.,He saw the heavy cross she bore
2791,XIII.,With steadfast faith and tenderness.
2792,XIII.,
2793,XIII.,"She kept her love intact, because"
2794,XIII.,She would not be a partisan;
2795,XIII.,"Not hers the voice that made the laws,"
2796,XIII.,"Nor hers prerogative to ban,"
2797,XIII.,Or bolster them with her applause.
2798,XIII.,
2799,XIII.,"No strife of jarring policies,"
2800,XIII.,"No conflict of embittered states,"
2801,XIII.,"No chart, defining by degrees"
2802,XIII.,"Of latitude her country's hates,"
2803,XIII.,Could change her friends to enemies.
2804,XIII.,
2805,XIII.,"The motives ranged on either hand,"
2806,XIII.,"Behind the war of word and will,"
2807,XIII.,Were such as she could understand
2808,XIII.,"And, with respect to all, fulfil"
2809,XIII.,Love's broad and beautiful command.
2810,XIII.,
2811,XIII.,"So, with all questions hushed to sleep,"
2812,XIII.,"And all opinions put aside,"
2813,XIII.,She gave her loved ones to the keep
2814,XIII.,"Of God, whatever should betide,"
2815,XIII.,To bear her joy or bid her weep!
2816,XIII.,
2817,XIII.,
2818,XIII.,
2819,XIV.,XIV.
2820,XIV.,

2823,XIV.,"Bade him go forward, and incur"
2824,XIV.,"Such cost as, since the world began,"
2825,XIV.,Has burdened Freedom's harbinger.
2826,XIV.,
2827,XIV.,No heart or hand was his to flinch
2828,XIV.,From ease or reputation lost;
2829,XIV.,"Nor waste of gold, nor hunger-pinch,"
2830,XIV.,"Nor e'en his home's black holocaust,"
2831,XIV.,"Could stay his arm, though inch by inch,"
2832,XIV.,
2833,XIV.,The maddened hosts of scorn and scath
2834,XIV.,Should crowd him backward to defeat.
2835,XIV.,"He would but strive with sterner wrath,"
2836,XIV.,"And bless the hand that, soft and sweet,"
2837,XIV.,Withheld its hinderance from his path!
2838,XIV.,
2839,XIV.,
2840,XIV.,
2841,XV.,XV.
2842,XV.,
2843,XV.,"Still darker loomed the Southern cloud,"
2844,XV.,While o'er its black and billowed face
2845,XV.,"In furrowed fire the lightning ploughed,"
2846,XV.,And ramping from its hiding-place
2847,XV.,"Roared the wild thunder, fierce and loud!"
2848,XV.,
2849,XV.,"And still men chattered of their trade,"
2850,XV.,And strove to banish their alarms;
2851,XV.,"And some were puzzled, some afraid,"
2852,XV.,And some held up their feeble arms
2853,XV.,In indignation while they prayed!
2854,XV.,
2855,XV.,And others weakly talked of schism
2856,XV.,"As boon of God in place of war,"
2857,XV.,And bared their foreheads for its chrism!
2858,XV.,"While direr than the mace of Thor,"
2859,XV.,In mid-air hung the cataclysm
2860,XV.,
2861,XV.,"Which waited but some chance, or act,"
2862,XV.,"To shiver the electric spell,"
2863,XV.,And pour in one fierce cataract
2864,XV.,A rain of blood and fire of hell
2865,XV.,On Freedom's temple spoiled and sacked.
2866,XV.,
2867,XV.,The politician plied his craft;
2868,XV.,The demagogue still schemed and lied;
2869,XV.,"The patriot wept, the traitor laughed;"
2870,XV.,"The coward to his covert hied,"
2871,XV.,And statesmen went distract or daft.
2872,XV.,
2873,XV.,Contention raged in Senate halls;
2874,XV.,Confusion reigned in field and town;
2875,XV.,"High conclaves flattened into brawls,"
2876,XV.,"And till and hammer, smock and gown,"
2877,XV.,Nor duty knew nor heard its calls!

2880,XV.,
2881,XVI.,XVI.
2882,XVI.,
2883,XVI.,"At last, incontinent of fire,"

2885,XVI.,"And every state and every shire,"
2886,XVI.,"And town and hamlet in the land,"
2887,XVI.,Shook with the smiting of its ire!
2888,XVI.,
2889,XVI.,"Men looked each other in the eyes,"
2890,XVI.,And beat their burning breasts and cursed!
2891,XVI.,At last the silliest were wise;
2892,XVI.,And swift to flash and thunder-burst
2893,XVI.,Fashioned in anger their replies.
2894,XVI.,
2895,XVI.,The smoke of Sumter filled the air.
2896,XVI.,Men breathed it in in one long breath;
2897,XVI.,"And straight upspringing everywhere,"
2898,XVI.,"Life burgeoned on the mounds of death,"
2899,XVI.,And bloomed in valleys of despair.
2900,XVI.,
2901,XVI.,"The fire of Sumter, fierce and hot,"
2902,XVI.,Welded their purpose into one;
2903,XVI.,"And discord hushed, and strife forgot,"
2904,XVI.,They swore that what had thus begun
2905,XVI.,"With sacrilegious cannon-shot,"
2906,XVI.,
2907,XVI.,Should find in analogue of flame
2908,XVI.,"Such answer of the nation's host,"
2909,XVI.,"That the old flag, washed clean from shame"
2910,XVI.,"In blood, should wave from coast to coast,"
2911,XVI.,Over one realm in heart and name!
2912,XVI.,
2913,XVI.,"Pale doubters, scourged by countless whips,"
2914,XVI.,"Fled to their refuge, or obeyed"
2915,XVI.,The motives and the masterships
2916,XVI.,That time and circumstance betrayed
2917,XVI.,"Through Patriotism's apocalypse,"
2918,XVI.,
2919,XVI.,"And, sympathetic with the spasm"
2920,XVI.,"Of loyal life that thrilled the clime,"
2921,XVI.,Lost in the swift enthusiasm
2922,XVI.,"The loose intention of their crime,"
2923,XVI.,And leaped in swarms the awful chasm
2924,XVI.,
2925,XVI.,That held them parted from the mass.
2926,XVI.,The North was one in heart and thought;
2927,XVI.,And that which could not come to pass
2928,XVI.,"Through loyal eloquence, was wrought"
2929,XVI.,By one hot word from lips of brass!
2930,XVI.,
2931,XVI.,
2932,XVI.,
2933,XVII.,XVII.
2934,XVII.,
2935,XVII.,The cry sprang upward and sped on:

2939,XVII.,"Hurtled the fierce Euroclydon,"
2940,XVII.,
2941,XVII.,"Men dropped their mallets on the bench,"
2942,XVII.,"Forsook their ploughs on hill and plain,"
2943,XVII.,"And tore themselves, with piteous wrench"
2944,XVII.,"Of heart and hope, from love and gain,"
2945,XVII.,And trooped in throngs to tent and trench.
2946,XVII.,
2947,XVII.,"""To arms!"" and Philip heard the cry."
2948,XVII.,Not his the valor cheap and small
2949,XVII.,"To bluster with brave phrase, and fly"

2951,XVII.,Proclaimed the time for words gone by!
2952,XVII.,
2953,XVII.,Men knew their chieftain.  He had borne
2954,XVII.,"Their insolence through struggling years,"
2955,XVII.,"And they---the dastards, the forsworn--"
2956,XVII.,Who had ransacked the hemispheres
2957,XVII.,For instruments to wreak their scorn
2958,XVII.,
2959,XVII.,"On him and all of kindred speech,"
2960,XVII.,"Gathered around him with his friends,"
2961,XVII.,And with stern plaudits heard him preach
2962,XVII.,A gospel whose stupendous ends
2963,XVII.,Their martyred blood could only reach.
2964,XVII.,
2965,XVII.,"They gave him honor far and wide,"
2966,XVII.,As one who backed his word by deed;
2967,XVII.,"And he whose task had been to guide,"
2968,XVII.,Was chosen by reclaim to lead
2969,XVII.,The men who gathered at his side.
2970,XVII.,
2971,XVII.,The crook was banished for the glave;
2972,XVII.,The churchman's black for soldier-blue;
2973,XVII.,The man of peace became a brave;

3032,XX.,
3033,XX.,A thousand chances of the feud
3034,XX.,"She wove and raveled one by one,--"
3035,XX.,"Of hands in kindred blood imbrued,--"
3036,XX.,"Of father, face to face with son,"
3037,XX.,And friends turned foemen fierce and rude.
3038,XX.,
3039,XX.,"And in her dreams two forms were met,"
3040,XX.,Of friends as leal as ever breathed---
3041,XX.,Her husband and her brother--wet
3042,XX.,With priceless blood from swords ensheathed
3043,XX.,In hearts that loved each other yet!
3044,XX.,
3045,XX.,"But itching ears her language scanned,"
3046,XX.,And jealous eyes were on her steps;
3047,XX.,And fancies into rumors fanned
3048,XX.,By loyal shrews and demireps
3049,XX.,Proclaimed her traitress to the land.
3050,XX.,
3051,XX.,"They knew her blood, but could not know"
3052,XX.,That mighty passion of her heart
3053,XX.,"Which, reaching widely in its woe,"
3054,XX.,"Grasped all she loved on either part,"
3055,XX.,"And could not, would not let it go!"
3056,XX.,
3057,XX.,
3058,XX.,
3059,XXI.,XXI.
3060,XXI.,
3061,XXI.,The time of gathering came and went--
3062,XXI.,Of noisy zeal and hasty drill--
3063,XXI.,"And every where, in field and tent,--"
3064,XXI.,"A constant presence,--Philip's will"
3065,XXI.,Moulded the callow regiment.
3066,XXI.,
3067,XXI.,"And then there fell a gala day,"
3068,XXI.,"When all the mighty, motley swarm"
3069,XXI.,Appeared in beautiful display
3070,XXI.,"Of burnished arms and uniform,"
3071,XXI.,And gloried in their brave array!--
3072,XXI.,
3073,XXI.,"And, later still, the hour of dread"
3074,XXI.,"To all the simple country round,"
3075,XXI.,"When forth, with Philip at their head,"
3076,XXI.,"They marched from the familiar ground,"
3077,XXI.,"And drained its life, and left it dead;--"
3078,XXI.,
3079,XXI.,Dead but for those who pined with grief;
3080,XXI.,Dead but for fears that could not die;
3081,XXI.,Dead as the world when flower and leaf
3082,XXI.,"Are still beneath a gathering sky,"
3083,XXI.,And ocean sleeps on reach and reef.
3084,XXI.,
3085,XXI.,"The weary waiting time had come,"
3086,XXI.,When only apprehension waked;
3087,XXI.,And lonely wives sat chill and dumb
3088,XXI.,"Among their broods, with hearts that ached"
3089,XXI.,And echoed the retreating drum.
3090,XXI.,
3091,XXI.,"Teachers forgot to preach their creeds,"
3092,XXI.,And trade forsook its merchandise;
3093,XXI.,"The fallow fields grew rank with weeds,"
3094,XXI.,And none had interest or eyes
3095,XXI.,For aught but war's ensanguined deeds.
3096,XXI.,
3097,XXI.,As one who lingered by a bier
3098,XXI.,"Where all she loved lay dead and cold,"
3099,XXI.,"Sad Mildred sat without a tear,"
3100,XXI.,"Living again the days of old,"
3101,XXI.,"Or, with the vision of a seer,"
3102,XXI.,
3103,XXI.,Forecasting the disastrous end.
3104,XXI.,"Whatever might come, she did not dare"
3105,XXI.,Believe that fortune would defend
3106,XXI.,"The noble life she could not spare,"
3107,XXI.,And save her lover and her friend.
3108,XXI.,
3109,XXI.,Her blooming girls and stalwart boys
3110,XXI.,Could never comprehend the woe
3111,XXI.,"Which dropped its measure of their joys,"
3112,XXI.,"And felt but horror in the show,"
3113,XXI.,"And heard but murder in the noise,"
3114,XXI.,
3115,XXI.,And dreamed of death when stillness fell
3116,XXI.,Behind the gay and shouting corps.
3117,XXI.,They saw her haunted by the spell
3118,XXI.,"Of a great sorrow, and forebore"
3119,XXI.,To question what they could not quell.
3120,XXI.,
3121,XXI.,Small time she gave to vain regret;
3122,XXI.,Brief space to thought of that adieu
3123,XXI.,"Which crushed her breast, when last they met,"
3124,XXI.,And in love's baptism bathed anew
3125,XXI.,"Cheeks, lips, and eyes, and left them wet!"
3126,XXI.,
3127,XXI.,"In deeds of sympathy and grace,"
3128,XXI.,"She moved among the homes forlorn,"
3129,XXI.,Alike to beautiful and base
3130,XXI.,"And, to the stricken and the shorn,"
3131,XXI.,The guardian angel of the place.
3132,XXI.,
3133,XXI.,
3134,XXI.,
3135,XXII.,XXII.
3136,XXII.,
3137,XXII.,Oh piteous waste of hopes and fears!
3138,XXII.,Oh cruel stretch of long delay!
3139,XXII.,Oh homes bereft!  Oh useless tears!
3140,XXII.,Oh war! that ravened on its prey
3141,XXII.,Through pain's immeasurable years!
3142,XXII.,
3143,XXII.,The town was mourning for its dead;
3144,XXII.,The streets were black with widowhood;
3145,XXII.,"While orphaned children begged for bread,"
3146,XXII.,"And Rachel, for the brave and good,"
3147,XXII.,"Mourned, and would not be comforted."
3148,XXII.,
3149,XXII.,"The regiment that, straight and crisp,"
3150,XXII.,"Shone like a wheat-field in the sun,"
3151,XXII.,"Its swift voice deafened to a lisp,"
3152,XXII.,"Fell, ere the war was well begun,"
3153,XXII.,And waned and withered to a wisp.
3154,XXII.,
3155,XXII.,"And Philip, grown to higher rank,"
3156,XXII.,"Crowned with the bays of splendid deeds,"
3157,XXII.,"Of the full cup of glory drank,"
3158,XXII.,"And lived, though all his reeking steeds"
3159,XXII.,In the red front of conflict sank.
3160,XXII.,
3161,XXII.,"The star of conquest waxed or waned,"
3162,XXII.,Yet still the call came back for men;
3163,XXII.,"Still the lamenting town was drained,"
3164,XXII.,"And still again, and still again,"
3165,XXII.,Till only impotence remained!
3166,XXII.,
3167,XXII.,
3168,XXII.,
3169,XXIII.,XXIII.
3170,XXIII.,
3171,XXIII.,There came at length an eve of gloom--
3172,XXIII.,Dread Gettysburg's eventful eve--
3173,XXIII.,When all the gathering clouds of doom
3174,XXIII.,"Hung low, the breathless air to cleave"
3175,XXIII.,With scream of shell and cannon-boom!
3176,XXIII.,
3177,XXIII.,"Man knew too well; and woman felt,"
3178,XXIII.,"That when the next-wild morn should rise,"
3179,XXIII.,"A blow of battle would, be dealt"
3180,XXIII.,Before whose fire ten thousand eyes--
3181,XXIII.,As in a furnace flame--would melt.
3182,XXIII.,
3183,XXIII.,And on this eve--her flock asleep--
3184,XXIII.,Knelt Mildred at her lonely bed.
3185,XXIII.,"She could not pray, she did not weep,"
3186,XXIII.,"But only moaned, and moaning, said:"
3187,XXIII.,"""Oh God! he sows what I must reap!"
3188,XXIII.,
3189,XXIII.,"""He will not live: he must not die!"
3190,XXIII.,"But oh, my poor, prophetic heart!"
3191,XXIII.,It warns me that there lingers nigh
3192,XXIII.,"The hour when love and I must part!"""
3193,XXIII.,"And then she startled with a cry,"
3194,XXIII.,
3195,XXIII.,"For, from beneath her lattice, came"
3196,XXIII.,A low and once repeated call!
3197,XXIII.,"She knew the voice that spoke her name,"
3198,XXIII.,"And swiftly, through the midnight hall"
3199,XXIII.,"She fluttered noiseless as a flame,"
3200,XXIII.,
3201,XXIII.,And on its unresisting hinge
3202,XXIII.,"Threw wide her hospitable door,"
3203,XXIII.,To one whose spirit did not cringe
3204,XXIII.,"Though he was weak, and knew he bore"
3205,XXIII.,No right her freedom to infringe.
3206,XXIII.,
3207,XXIII.,She wildly clasped his neck of bronze;
3208,XXIII.,"She rained her kisses; on his face,"
3209,XXIII.,"Grown tawny with a thousand suns,"
3210,XXIII.,"And holding him in her embrace,"
3211,XXIII.,"She led him to her little ones,"
3212,XXIII.,
3213,XXIII.,"Who, reckless of his coming, slept."
3214,XXIII.,"Then down the stair with silent feet,"
3215,XXIII.,"And through the shadowy hall she swept,"
3216,XXIII.,"And saw, between her and the street,"
3217,XXIII.,A form that into darkness crept.
3218,XXIII.,
3219,XXIII.,She closed the door with speechless dread;
3220,XXIII.,She fixed the bolt with trembling hand;
3221,XXIII.,"Then led the rebel to his bed,"
3222,XXIII.,"Whom love and safety had unmanned,"
3223,XXIII.,And left him less alive than dead.
3224,XXIII.,
3225,XXIII.,"Through nights and days of fear and grief,"
3226,XXIII.,"She kept her faithful watch and ward,"
3227,XXIII.,But love and rest brought no relief;
3228,XXIII.,And all he begged for of his Lord
3229,XXIII.,"Was death, with passion faint and brief."
3230,XXIII.,
3231,XXIII.,
3232,XXIII.,
3233,XXIV.,XXIV.
3234,XXIV.,
3235,XXIV.,"Around the house were prying eyes,"
3236,XXIV.,And gossips hiding under trees;
3237,XXIV.,And Mildred heard the steps of spies
3238,XXIV.,"At midnight, when, upon her knees,"
3239,XXIV.,She sought the comfort of the skies.
3240,XXIV.,
3241,XXIV.,Strange voices rose upon the night;
3242,XXIV.,Strange errands entered at the gate;
3243,XXIV.,Her hours were months of pale affright;
3244,XXIV.,But still her prisoner of state
3245,XXIV.,Was shielded from their eager sight.
3246,XXIV.,
3247,XXIV.,They did not dare to force the lock
3248,XXIV.,"Of one whose deeds had been divine,"
3249,XXIV.,Or carry to her heart the shock
3250,XXIV.,"Of violence, although condign"
3251,XXIV.,Toward one who dared the laws to mock.
3252,XXIV.,
3253,XXIV.,"But there were hirelings in pursuit,"
3254,XXIV.,Who thirsted for his golden price;
3255,XXIV.,"And, swift allied with pimp and brute,"
3256,XXIV.,"And quick to purchase and entice,"
3257,XXIV.,They found the tree that held their fruit.
3258,XXIV.,
3259,XXIV.,
3260,XXIV.,
3261,XXIV.,
3262,XXV.,XXV.
3263,XXV.,
3264,XXV.,The day of Gettysburg had set;
3265,XXV.,"The smoke had drifted from the scene,"
3266,XXV.,And burnished sword and bayonet
3267,XXV.,"Lay rusting where, but yestere'en,"
3268,XXV.,They dropped with life-blood red and wet!
3269,XXV.,
3270,XXV.,The swift invader had retraced
3271,XXV.,"His march, and left his fallen braves,"
3272,XXV.,"Covered at night in voiceless haste,"
3273,XXV.,"To, sleep, in memorable graves,"
3274,XXV.,But knew that all his loss was waste.
3275,XXV.,
3276,XXV.,"The nation's legions, stretching wide,"
3277,XXV.,"Too sore to chase, too weak to cheer,"
3278,XXV.,"Gave sepulture to those who died,"
3279,XXV.,And saw their foemen disappear
3280,XXV.,Without the loss of power or pride.
3281,XXV.,
3282,XXV.,"And then, swift-sweeping like a gale,"
3283,XXV.,"Through all the land, from end to end,"
3284,XXV.,"Grief poured its wild, untempered wail,"
3285,XXV.,"And father, mother, wife, and friend"
3286,XXV.,Forgot their country in their bale.
3287,XXV.,
3288,XXV.,"And Philip, with his fatal wound,"
3289,XXV.,"Was borne beyond the battle's blaze,"
3290,XXV.,"Across the torn and quaking ground,--"
3291,XXV.,"His ear too dull to heed the praise,"
3292,XXV.,"That spoke him hero, robed and crowned."
3293,XXV.,
3294,XXV.,"They bent above his blackened face,"
3295,XXV.,And questioned of his last desire;
3296,XXV.,"And with his old, familiar grace,"
3297,XXV.,"And smiling mouth, and eye of fire,"
3298,XXV.,"He answered them: ""My wife's embrace!"""
3299,XXV.,
3300,XXV.,"They wiped his forehead of its stain,"
3301,XXV.,"They bore him tenderly away,"
3302,XXV.,"Through teeming mart and wide champaign,"
3303,XXV.,"Till on a twilighty cool and gray,"
3304,XXV.,"And wet with weeping of the rain,"
3305,XXV.,
3306,XXV.,They gave him to a silent crowd
3307,XXV.,"That waited at the river's marge,"
3308,XXV.,"Of men with age and sorrow bowed,"
3309,XXV.,"Who raised and bore their precious charge,"
3310,XXV.,Through groups that watched and wailed aloud.
3311,XXV.,
3312,XXV.,
3313,XXV.,
3314,XXVI.,XXVI.
3315,XXVI.,
3316,XXVI.,The hounds of power were at her gate;
3317,XXVI.,"And at their heels, a yelping pack"
3318,XXVI.,"Of graceless mongrels stood in wait,"
3319,XXVI.,"To mark the issue of attack,"
3320,XXVI.,With lips that slavered with their hate.
3321,XXVI.,
3322,XXVI.,"With window raised and portal barred,"
3323,XXVI.,"The mistress scanned the darkening space,"
3324,XXVI.,And with a visage hot and hard--
3325,XXVI.,At bay before the cruel chase--
3326,XXVI.,She held them in her fierce regard.
3327,XXVI.,
3328,XXVI.,"""What would ye--spies and hirelings--what?"""
3329,XXVI.,"She asked with accent, stern and brave;"
3330,XXVI.,"""Why come ye to this sacred spot,"
3331,XXVI.,"Led by the counsel of a knave,"
3332,XXVI.,And flanked by slanderer and sot?
3333,XXVI.,
3334,XXVI.,"""You have my husband: has he earned"
3335,XXVI.,No meed of courtesy for me?
3336,XXVI.,"Is this the recompense returned,"
3337,XXVI.,That she he loved the best should be
3338,XXVI.,"Suspected, persecuted, spurned?"
3339,XXVI.,
3340,XXVI.,"""My home is wrecked: what would ye more?"
3341,XXVI.,My life is ruined--what new boon?
3342,XXVI.,My children's hearts are sad and sore
3343,XXVI.,With weeping for the wounds that soon
3344,XXVI.,Will plead for healing at my door!
3345,XXVI.,
3346,XXVI.,"""I hold your prisoner--stand assured:"
3347,XXVI.,"Safe from his foes: aye, safe from you!"
3348,XXVI.,"Safe in a sister's love immured,"
3349,XXVI.,And by a warden kept as true
3350,XXVI.,"As e'er the test of faith endured,"
3351,XXVI.,
3352,XXVI.,"""Why, men, he was my brother born!"
3353,XXVI.,"My hero, all my youthful years!"
3354,XXVI.,"My counsellor, to guide and warn!"
3355,XXVI.,My shield alike from foes and fears!
3356,XXVI.,"And when he came to me, forlorn,"
3357,XXVI.,
3358,XXVI.,"""What could I do but hail him guest,"
3359,XXVI.,"And bind his cruel wounds with balm,"
3360,XXVI.,And give him on his sister's breast
3361,XXVI.,"That which he asked, the humble alm"
3362,XXVI.,Of a safe pillow where to rest?
3363,XXVI.,
3364,XXVI.,"""Come, then, and dare the wrath of fate!"
3365,XXVI.,"Come, if you must, or if you will!"
3366,XXVI.,But know that I am desperate;
3367,XXVI.,"And shafts that wound, and wounds that kill"
3368,XXVI.,"Your deed of dastardy await!"""
3369,XXVI.,
3370,XXVI.,A murmur swept through all the mob;
3371,XXVI.,The base informer slunk afar;
3372,XXVI.,And lusty cheer and stifled sob
3373,XXVI.,"Rose to her at the window-bar,"
3374,XXVI.,While those whose hands were come to rob
3375,XXVI.,
3376,XXVI.,"Her dwelling of its treasure, cursed;"
3377,XXVI.,For round their heads the menace flew
3378,XXVI.,"That he who dared adventure first,"
3379,XXVI.,"Or first an arm of murder drew,"
3380,XXVI.,Should taste of vengeance at its worst.
3381,XXVI.,
3382,XXVI.,
3383,XXVI.,
3384,XXVII.,XXVII.
3385,XXVII.,
3386,XXVII.,"A heavy tramp, a murmuring sound,"
3387,XXVII.,"Low mingling with the murmuring rain,--"
3388,XXVII.,"Heard in the wind and in the ground,--"
3389,XXVII.,"Came up the street--a tide of pain,"
3390,XXVII.,In which the angry din was drowned.
3391,XXVII.,
3392,XXVII.,The leaders of the tumult fled;
3393,XXVII.,The door flew open with a crash;
3394,XXVII.,"And down the street wild Mildred sped,"
3395,XXVII.,"Piercing the darkness like a flash,"
3396,XXVII.,And walked beside her husband's bed.
3397,XXVII.,
3398,XXVII.,Slowly the solemn train advanced;
3399,XXVII.,The crowd fell back with parted ranks;
3400,XXVII.,"And like a giant, half entranced,"
3401,XXVII.,"Sailing between strange, spectral banks,"
3402,XXVII.,From side to side the soldier glanced.
3403,XXVII.,
3404,XXVII.,"The sobbing rain, the evening dim,"
3405,XXVII.,"The dusky forms that pushed and peered,"
3406,XXVII.,"The swaying couch, the aching limb,"
3407,XXVII.,"The lights and shadows, sharp and weird,"
3408,XXVII.,Were but a troubled dream to him.
3409,XXVII.,
3410,XXVII.,"He knew his love--all else unknown,"
3411,XXVII.,Or seen through reason's sad eclipse--
3412,XXVII.,"And with her, hand within his own,"
3413,XXVII.,"Or fondly pressed upon his lips,"
3414,XXVII.,"He clung to it, as if alone"
3415,XXVII.,
3416,XXVII.,"It had the power to stay, his feet"
3417,XXVII.,Still longer on the verge of life;
3418,XXVII.,And thus they vanished from the street--
3419,XXVII.,The shepherd-warrior and his wife--
3420,XXVII.,Within the manse's closed retreat.
3421,XXVII.,
3422,XXVII.,
3423,XXVII.,
3424,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
3425,XXVIII.,
3426,XXVIII.,"Embraced by home, his soul grew light;"
3427,XXVIII.,"And though he moaned: ""My head! my head!"""
3428,XXVIII.,"His life turned back its outward flight,"
3429,XXVIII.,"Like his, who, from the prophet's bed,"
3430,XXVIII.,Startled the wondering Shunammite.
3431,XXVIII.,
3432,XXVIII.,He greeted all with tender speech;
3433,XXVIII.,He told his children he should die;
3434,XXVIII.,"He gave his fond farewell to each,"
3435,XXVIII.,"With messages, and fond good-by"
3436,XXVIII.,To all he loved beyond his reach.
3437,XXVIII.,
3438,XXVIII.,And then he spoke her brother's name:
3439,XXVIII.,"""Tell him,"" he said, ""that, in my death,"
3440,XXVIII.,"I cherished his untarnished fame,"
3441,XXVIII.,"And, to my life's expiring breath,"
3442,XXVIII.,Held his brave spirit free from blame.
3443,XXVIII.,
3444,XXVIII.,"""We strove alike for truth's behoof,"
3445,XXVIII.,"With honest faith and love sincere,--"
3446,XXVIII.,"For God and-country, right and roof,"
3447,XXVIII.,And issues that do not appear;
3448,XXVIII.,"But wait with Heaven the awful proof."""
3449,XXVIII.,
3450,XXVIII.,A tottering figure reached the door;
3451,XXVIII.,"The brother fell upon the bed,"
3452,XXVIII.,"And, in each other's arms once more,"
3453,XXVIII.,"With breast to breast, and head to head,--"
3454,XXVIII.,"Twin barks, they drifted from the shore;"
3455,XXVIII.,
3456,XXVIII.,And backward on the sobbing air
3457,XXVIII.,Came the same words from warring lips:
3458,XXVIII.,"""God save my country!"" and the prayer"
3459,XXVIII.,"Still wailing from the drifting ships,"
3460,XXVIII.,Returned in measures of despair;
3461,XXVIII.,
3462,XXVIII.,"Till far, at the horizon's verge,"
3463,XXVIII.,They passed beyond the tearful eyes
3464,XXVIII.,That could not know if in the surge
3465,XXVIII.,"They sank at last, or in the skies"
3466,XXVIII.,Forgot the burden of their dirge!
3467,XXVIII.,
3468,XXVIII.,
3469,XXVIII.,
3470,XXIX.,XXIX.
3471,XXIX.,
3472,XXIX.,"In Northern blue and Southern brown,"
3473,XXIX.,"Twin coffins and a single grave,"
3474,XXIX.,They laid the weary warriors down;
3475,XXIX.,And hands that strove to slay and save
3476,XXIX.,Had equal rest and like renown.
3477,XXIX.,
3478,XXIX.,For in the graveyard's hallowed close
3479,XXIX.,"A woman's love made neutral soil,"
3480,XXIX.,Where it might lay the forms of those
3481,XXIX.,"Who, resting from their fateful broil,"
3482,XXIX.,Had ceased forever to be foes.
3483,XXIX.,
3484,XXIX.,To her and those who clung to her--
3485,XXIX.,From manly eldest down to least--
3486,XXIX.,"The obsequies, the sepulchre,"
3487,XXIX.,"The chanting choir, the weeping priest,"
3488,XXIX.,And all the throng and all the stir
3489,XXIX.,
3490,XXIX.,"Of sympathetic country-folk,"
3491,XXIX.,"And all the signs of death and dole,"
3492,XXIX.,Were but a dream that beat and broke
3493,XXIX.,"In chilling waves on heart and soul,"
3494,XXIX.,Till in the silence they awoke.
3495,XXIX.,
3496,XXIX.,"She was a widow, and she wept;"
3497,XXIX.,"She was a mother, and she smiled;"
3498,XXIX.,"Her faith with those she loved was kept,"
3499,XXIX.,"Though still the war-cry, fierce and wild,"
3500,XXIX.,Around the harried country swept.
3501,XXIX.,
3502,XXIX.,No more with this had she to do;
3503,XXIX.,God and her little ones were left;
3504,XXIX.,"And unto these, serene and true,"
3505,XXIX.,She gave the life so soon bereft
3506,XXIX.,"Of its first gifts, and rose anew"
3507,XXIX.,
3508,XXIX.,At duty's call to make amends
3509,XXIX.,For all her loss of loves and lands;
3510,XXIX.,"And found, to speed her noble ends,"
3511,XXIX.,"The succor of uplifting hands,"
3512,XXIX.,And solace of a thousand friends.
