82,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
83,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
84,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"OVERLOOK HOUSE, _October 10, 1864_."
85,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
86,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"MY DEAR FRIEND:--At last, as if borne to you by some scape-grace of a"
87,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"messenger, these papers, copied from the time-discoloured manuscripts,"
88,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"so carefully preserved in the old book-case, which with its dark lustre,"
89,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"its bright brass ornaments, is still the prominent object in our"
90,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"library, are destined to reach the hands into which they should long ago"
91,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,have been placed.
92,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
93,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"I well remember the evening on which you first heard of them, and"
94,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,listened to my attempt to read them to you; perplexed as I was with the
95,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"faded lines, traced by fingers which can write no more."
96,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
97,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"You will not forget our drives, previously, during the day, and late in"
98,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the afternoon, in consequence of my week-day service in the old church."
99,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,Perhaps the ancient edifice would need the excuse of days of
100,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"architectural ignorance, but no Cathedral on earth can surpass it, in"
101,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,its claim to occupy a place amid scenes of surpassing beauty and
102,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"sublimity. There it stands alone, on the slope of an immense hill, with"
103,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,the whole range of the mountains from the water-gap to the wind-gap full
104,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,in view--glorious walls to sustain the great blue dome of heaven! The
105,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"great solitude of the road that winds along the grave-yard, has often"
106,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"caused me to think of distant friends, and has riveted them to my soul"
107,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,with still more indissoluble bonds. And the Great Friend has been the
108,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"great relief from oppressive loneliness, as I thus stood in one of the"
109,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,beautiful gates of the Eternal Temple. As to that quiet grave-yard
110,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"itself, the ""rhetoric of the dead"" is there well spoken, and they whose"
111,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"ashes are here deposited, do not find ""second graves"" in our short"
112,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,memories.
113,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
114,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,You will tell me that all connected with my church is not always solemn.
115,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"Your perverse memory will never forget the leader of the choir; nay, the"
116,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,useful man who was often choir itself. He sang at least with energy.
117,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,Unfortunately--oh well do I remember my fearful victory over my
118,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"features, when I first became cognizant of the fact; a victory at a time"
119,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,when a smile had endangered my claims to due ministerial sobriety;
120,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"unfortunately he had the habit of marking time emphatically, by raising"
121,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"himself on his toes, and simultaneously elevating his hand, his chin,"
122,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"his eyes, and his hair. Yet that was but a slight trial to us both. The"
123,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,man was better than either of us; and the first impression having
124,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"subsided, we found that he did well in calling forth the voices of the"
125,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"congregation. You will recollect our return home, as we refused all"
126,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"offers of hospitality, although the snow was falling, and we were warned"
127,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"not to risk the drifts, promised by the rising wind. We would not be"
128,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"detained, as we had set our hearts on passing the evening together in"
129,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the old mansion of my fathers. On we drove, the sound of the bells"
130,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"sweeping in wild merriment over the great fields of snow, or rising to a"
131,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"louder chime as we passed through the forest, under a thousand triumphal"
132,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"arches, of boughs laden with white honors. Only once, and where the road"
133,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"was in a ravine, was I afraid that you would be exposed some hours to"
134,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the storm, until we should hear the voices of hunters, and the bay of"
135,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"their dogs, sent to seek us, after our custom, when any one is lost in"
136,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the snow. Happily we extricated ourselves, and soon saw the lights"
137,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,gleaming from the windows of the house upon the hill.
138,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
139,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"How pleasant the welcome of our good old Cæsar, the man of dark hue, who"
140,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"had no desire to be the first man in the village, nor the second man at"
141,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"Rome; but was all eagerness to have a place, however lowly, in the"
142,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,Eternal City! Another glad welcome in the hall; a net-work of questions
143,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"from little threads of voices, and the seats before the great wood-fire,"
144,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,one of the few remaining representatives of the profuse customs of the
145,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,fathers; one witness that our forests are not yet all swept away. Did we
146,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,not give ample tributes to the repast prepared by Cæsar's wife! Two
147,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"hungry men rescued from snow waves, we proved that one could feast on"
148,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"Dinah's poetry of food, and yet, in the ensuing night, behold no"
149,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"magnificent bandit, with a beard that would have done credit to a Roman"
150,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"Centurion, and a dagger that honored the sense of sublime danger, by the"
151,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"assurance that if it was to give us our death-blow, it was no coarse"
152,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,weapon; the grand villain peering over you with an eye in which the evil
153,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,fires take refuge when conscience is in ashes. You know that in that
154,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"coming night, you did not even see the ""fair ladie,"" now your wife,"
155,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"borne away from you, in a mysterious coach, by some ruffians clad in"
156,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"splendid mantles, while you were palsied, and could not move to seize"
157,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the sword, or gun, or could not call for aid. How pleasant was that"
158,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"evening! From your weed rose the cloud that no counterblast, royal or"
159,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"plebeian, has ever yet been able to sweep away from the lips of men."
160,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"Knitting by her little stand, sat one, whom to name is to tell, in a"
161,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"word, the great history of my best earthly happiness. I am sure her"
162,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"sweet thoughts, when spoken, were as the fragrance of flowers over our"
163,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"homelier fields; while her gentle sympathy added to our strength, and"
164,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"her instinctive and pure impressions, aided our conceptions, as gentle"
165,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"guides, and taught us how wisdom was linked to minds swayed by goodness."
166,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,What a bond has she been of our long-enduring friendship! We talked of
167,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,the old times--of the ancient famed hospitality of the house. We spoke
168,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,of those who came there at Christmas--when the hymn of Milton seemed to
169,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,be read in a grand audience chamber--at the Spring when the world seemed
170,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"again so young--at Autumn where the mountains and hills were all a glow,"
171,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"as if angels had kindled them with a fire, burning, but not consuming"
172,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"them, turning them into great altars, by which man could stand, and"
173,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,offer his adoration. Then we spoke of the papers that had been read
174,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,among the assembled guests. I told you their history; a history further
175,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,recorded in the fourth chapter; the last of the four chapters
176,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,preliminary. These were written by my grandfather. As your curiosity was
177,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"awakened, I drew forth some of these, from the old book-case in the"
178,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"library, and read them as I could. You insisted that I should decipher"
179,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"them, and let you send them to the press; send them to some one of your"
180,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"honorable publishers, so that many eyes could read, what few eyes have"
181,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"rested on, in this distant solitude. Julia seconded the proposition."
182,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"What had I to do, but to obey! Some years have passed, and you have"
183,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,often complained of my procrastination. Shall I make excuses? Excuses
184,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"are the shadows which the irresolute and idle, the evil, keep ever near,"
185,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,as their refuge from just accusation. The moment you feel the least loss
186,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"of self-respect in seeking them, the moment you have to search to find"
187,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"them, take heed of them. Those formed to be giants, often live in them,"
188,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,and then life is consequently the life of the dwarf. I knew that I could
189,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"have sent the papers long ago, had I written two or three lines each"
190,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"day, since I gave my promise. Julia, who, woman-like, always convicts me"
191,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"when I excuse myself, and consoles me, and defends me, when I am in the"
192,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"ashes, and contrite with self-upbraiding, who is never severe with me,"
193,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"but when I spoil the children by keeping them up too late at night,"
194,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"says, that I never allow a literary effort to encroach on my great"
195,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"duties; that I have had so much to do, that I could not sooner perform"
196,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"my promise. She laughs, and says that the dates I annex to my papers,"
197,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"during my progress in this work, show how I was interrupted, and that if"
198,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the histories of intermediate parochial work were given, the book would"
199,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,be a strange record. Often the sick and suffering have caused long
200,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"intervals to elapse in these labors. When I could attempt the work, the"
201,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,change in the current of my associations has been a relief. Julia has
202,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"wished me to write histories of the lives of some of those, who composed"
203,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"various papers in the old case. Of course, some of the authors have been"
204,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"passing utterly from the minds of a race, that cannot remember, but the"
205,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,least remnant of those who have gone before. We lament the ravages of
206,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"time. Multitudes are forgotten on the earth, whom it would be a blessing"
207,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"to have in perpetual remembrance. Alas! we have also to confess, that"
208,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"time conceals the story of innumerable others, when it is well that it"
209,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,should be buried in its deepest oblivion.
210,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
211,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,I hope that I have copied these papers with commendable accuracy. We
212,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"trust that they will add to the happiness of those who read them, and"
213,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,prove at the same time to be profitable. May they increase kind
214,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,impressions! May they sow seeds that shall have the sun and dew that
215,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"never falls on growth that is evil! Man has tablets in the heart, for"
216,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"inscriptions greater, and more enduring, than those of the great ledges"
217,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,of rock in the far East.
218,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
219,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"As one would hesitate to write the outlines of his coming destiny, if"
220,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"such a pen of Providence could be ready for his hand, so he, who has any"
221,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"love for others, would pause before he would carve, even in faintest"
222,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"letters, one word on these, which could sully the surface, where the"
223,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"indestructibility warns us, that all is an eternal record with Him,"
224,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"whose eye is too pure to look upon iniquity. I need not attempt, like"
225,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"authors of a former age, to solicit a favorable criticism, from the"
226,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"""gentle reader."" If I say, here, that the hall has rung with peals of"
227,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"laughter, as some of the papers of the old book-case have been read,"
228,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"that some have shed tears over the Ghost of Ford Inn, and said, it is"
229,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"too sad, these assurances will not predispose one who shall open the"
230,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"proposed volume, to utter a favorable opinion. These waifs must be cast"
231,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"on the waters, like all other similar ventures. We must wait, and learn"
232,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,where Providence shall waft them.
233,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
234,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,Will these papers outlive this decaying house? Will men love us because
235,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"we have sent them forth? Will we, because of them, be grasped with a"
236,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"kindlier hand? Will they soften hearts in this trying world, and aid men"
237,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,to a greater charity?
238,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
239,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"But I must pause. Lamps will grow dim. Warnings will come, that letters"
240,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,may attain to too great prolixity. Readers are often not sufficiently
241,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"sagacious, to know that when Homer nods, he has a design. Can I apply,"
242,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"what old Dr. South, the great and witty preacher said, when he printed"
243,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"the sermon at the Royal mandate, that the Majesty of the Realm must"
244,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"excuse the length of the discourse, inasmuch as he had not had time to"
245,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"make it shorter? Or, shall I remember the severe speech, doubtless a"
246,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"dutiful necessity, a knife to remove such a miserable vanity as often"
247,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"makes men worse than useless; the severe speech of an Eastern Divine,"
248,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"who, when the young preacher waited all day in vain for a compliment, to"
249,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"his morning's discourse, and said, in desperation, as the evening waned"
250,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"in the study, ""Doctor, I hope that I did not weary your people with the"
251,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"length of my discourse,"" had for reply the quiet answer, ""No, sir; nor"
252,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"by the depth of it."""
253,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,
254,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"So, as you have the infirmity of going to sleep over the most"
255,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"interesting discourse, as the lamp is going out, as I am nervous,"
256,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"sitting up at such a late hour, as the paper is all written over, and I"
257,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"have none other near at hand, I release you. Go to sleep, but wake the"
258,INTRODUCTORY LETTER.,"world to-morrow, and then say that I am your friend."

274,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
275,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"I stepped from the stage-sleigh, in the village of Overlook, at the"
276,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,post-office: for there the driver stopped to leave his mail-bag. That
277,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"important article, which, as a boy, I used to regard with undefined"
278,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"dread, for I associated it with a poor wretch, who was hung for laying"
279,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"villanous hands upon one, in a desolate road, was the old-fashioned"
280,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"leather sack, full of iron rivets."
281,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
282,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"Perhaps at the time when this writing may reach the press, such a"
283,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,contrivance may have become antiquated; and therefore I had better add
284,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"to my description, that a weighty chain passed through iron rings, to"
285,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"secure the opening; and finally, there was the brass padlock, at which"
286,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"the Indian gazed with such contempt, when he said, ""Brass lock upon"
287,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"leather! that makes my knife laugh."" I stepped from the heavy"
288,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"stage-sleigh into the one sent for me by Judge Almore, and it was like"
289,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"passing from a heavy craft on the waters, into one of lesser make, and"
290,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"lighter burden. John Frake, the farmer at Overlook Manor, had driven"
291,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"over for me. His horses seemed exhilarated by the bells, and we dashed"
292,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,forward in splendid style. John Frake was a character; a real man in
293,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"energy, work, and talk; frank, and good-hearted."
294,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
295,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"As we drove along, in a loud voice, that permitted not a word to be lost"
296,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"by the melody of the bells, he made his comments upon all things, and"
297,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,especially on the inhabitants along the streets of the village.
298,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
299,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Dr. Norkin lives there,"" he said, pointing with his whip to a"
300,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,comfortable house. And then as if pondering the beginning of a long
301,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"train of thought, he added,"
302,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
303,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Those Yankees are unaccountable smart people."""
304,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
305,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""The doctor is a Yankee, then?"""
306,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
307,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Oh no! there aint enough Yankee in him to make a spot on the map of"
308,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"Massachusetts. Not but that the doctor has lots of common sense, and"
309,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"keeps all that he has got ready for use, when wanted, as ready as my"
310,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,plough to go through the ground. But those Yankees have the most
311,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,uncommon ways of putting things together; just as if you took something
312,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"out of the middle of the earth, and made it fit something on the top of"
313,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"a mountain."""
314,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
315,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Yes, but I don't see what Yankees have to do with the doctor."""
316,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
317,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""I'll tell you what I was thinking about. I was once at the mountains,"
318,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"forty miles off, where there is a mineral spring. There is where ladies"
319,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"and gentlemen go to drink water, eat all manner of things at the tavern,"
320,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"and get well, when they never have been sick. Iron in the water at the"
321,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,springs! Bless you; it would not divide the nails in a horse-shoe in a
322,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"month, to the whole army of the Revolution, if they had drunk of nothing"
323,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,else. Well our judge and the family followed the fashion. Fashion is a
324,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"runaway horse that carries a great load of straw behind him, and"
325,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,sometimes he has after him things much better than straw. I drove up to
326,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"bring them home. But the judge was taken sick just before I got there,"
327,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"and sent for our doctor here, to come up and cure him. In the night,"
328,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"after I got there, one of your uncommon Yankees, who seemed to be well"
329,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"off, and to do fifty things, from what I could gather, to make money,"
330,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,had a bad attack; unlike anything I ever heard of around here. He was
331,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"awful bad. I heard the racket, and went into his room."
332,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
333,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""'My friend,' says I, 'you do look awful bad'--for I always speak my"
334,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"honest sentiments, in a sick-room, or out of it. 'I thank you for your"
335,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"sympathy,' says he--and yet somehow it sounded as if he didn't. I"
336,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,presumed he didn't want any one to talk to him. 'Send down for Dr.
337,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"Norkin,' says the landlord. 'He is here;' this is what he said to the"
338,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"sick man. 'He lives forty miles off--at Overlook. But he is here,"
339,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,attending on Judge Almore--who has been ill.'
340,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
341,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""The sick man, after a groan or two, raised himself up in his bed. It"
342,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"was as good as the best apple, to see how quickly he seemed to ungear"
343,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"his mind from his sick body. He gave a long thought. Then he said,"
344,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
345,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""'Did the judge send for that doctor, because he was in the house at the"
346,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,time when he was taken sick? Or did he send all the way to Overlook for
347,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,him to come here to him?'
348,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
349,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""'He sent for him to Overlook,' says the landlord, before I could put in"
350,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,a word.
351,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
352,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""'Then I'll see him,' says he--speaking quickly out, and firm like, as"
353,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,if he was a king. Now wasn't that cute? I tell you such men think
354,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"faster, and a great way before other people. Well; it's a free country,"
355,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"and all people aint bound to do their thinking alike."""
356,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
357,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"We now came to the entrance of the lane, that led up to Overlook House."
358,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
359,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,Two large cherry trees stood on either side of the gate. I drew the
360,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"attention of my companion to them. They were very venerable, and their"
361,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,winter boughs showed some signs of decay.
362,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
363,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Them big trees,""--said he. ""Either of them, I'll engage is as old as"
364,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,three average men. They say a man averages thirty years of life. Now
365,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"they are full ninety years old, and big at that."""
366,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
367,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""You have lived long with the judge?"""
368,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
369,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"""Bless your heart, sir, long indeed. But he's a good man. There's few"
370,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"that don't say so--well, thank God, it is those kind of people that"
371,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"don't. When he speaks and acts, you feel that our Lord has taught him"
372,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"his religion--just as we know it is Sunday, when we wake and hear the"
373,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"church-bells ringing, and all the sun-light seems full of the sweet"
374,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"sound, and all the sound as if it had gone through the bright sun. I do"
375,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"love Sunday."""
376,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,
377,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"Here we were close to the house. ""Come and see me,"" he said, ""down at my"
378,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"house there. It is not as big as the judge's, but then there is room in"
379,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"it for a hearty welcome. I will give you a glass of good cider, or two,"
380,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"or three, for that matter. As for wine, I never keep any. It seems to me"
381,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,"to be poor stuff, as if it was trying to be brandy, and couldn't."" The"
382,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,mission of the sleigh was now over. I and my trunks were at the porch of
383,_ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE._,the house. So the worthy farmer and I parted for the present.

390,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._
391,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
392,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
393,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"A colored servant man, of most respectable appearance, and of quiet"
394,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"manners, evidently glad of my arrival ushered me into the house, saying"
395,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"that Judge Almore would be home in a short time, as he had gone but a"
396,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,little distance on the farm; and that his good lady would come down
397,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"stairs in a few minutes. The hall of the house was large, and decorated"
398,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"with Indian relics; with long deer-horns, also, and other trophies of"
399,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the hunting ground. I was hastened into an adjoining room, which I had"
400,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"scarcely entered, before I felt the invigorating heat from the great"
401,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"fire-place. There the hickory logs seemed doing their best, with their"
402,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"immense flame, to make me feel as if I was cared for, a stranger from a"
403,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,distance. On the hearth there was a small mountain of glowing coals. How
404,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"pleasant it is to sit before such a fire, and to think that our"
405,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"interminable forests, will supply abundant fuel, for the inhabitants of"
406,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"our cities for hundreds of years to come. Even when New York, and"
407,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Philadelphia, Trenton, and Boston, may, two or three centuries hence,"
408,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"have each two or three hundred thousand inhabitants, and that"
409,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"expectation of their increase in population, is not so chimerical as it"
410,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"seems, and when the country round them, may be so cleared and"
411,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"cultivated, that in a circle of fifteen or twenty miles in diameter, the"
412,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"farm-houses may generally be in sight of one another, it is probable"
413,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,that the decrease of our woods will scarcely be perceptible.
414,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
415,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,But as I gazed into the flames which soon removed all chilliness from my
416,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"frame, I had no time for lengthened speculations on the future of our"
417,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"land; for Mrs. Almore entered the room, and greeting me with great"
418,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"cordiality, assured me of my welcome. As I was engaged in conversation"
419,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"with this most estimable lady, I found myself called on to regret her"
420,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"visitation with a great affliction. Her cheerful countenance and manner,"
421,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"however, proved that she had not permitted it to hang over her as a"
422,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"cloud, to darken her days, or to make her selfish in her expectation of"
423,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"attention. The affliction was a great deafness, one evidently of long"
424,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"duration, and incurable; so I judged from the evidence of her loud"
425,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"tones, almost shouting when she addressed me. I flatter myself that I"
426,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"can cause any one to hear me speak, who has the ability to know, that a"
427,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,pistol is discharged not far from his ear. And I always feel great
428,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"commiseration for those who hear with difficulty. Meeting with such, I"
429,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"regard the power of my lungs, as a gift, particularly designed for their"
430,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,service and enjoyment. Indeed I undesignedly secured a legacy from an
431,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"aged aunt, by the assiduity I exhibited in informing her of what was"
432,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"said around her, when others neglected her, as she thought, because it"
433,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"was so difficult to make her to hear. Trained as I had been in the past,"
434,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"I have to confess, that my powers of loud speech, were never more taxed"
435,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,than on the present occasion. The loud tones in which we commenced our
436,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"conversation, were gradually increased; I perceived that as she raised"
437,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the pitch of her voice, it was a delicate intimation to me, that I must"
438,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"speak with increased effort, if I would secure a perfect hearing. As we"
439,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"were engaged in this polite rivalship, each being, not only a diligent"
440,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"hearer, but a good speaker, a most comfortable-looking African woman, of"
441,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"very dark hue, entered to receive the orders of her mistress. She"
442,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"desired to know, as it soon appeared, some particulars concerning the"
443,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,approaching meal; and also to receive some orders which pertained to the
444,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,room I was to occupy. The good mistress then stepped aside and drew near
445,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"to the swarthy domestic. To my surprise, the lady dropped her voice to a"
446,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"good undertone, and gave her directions, as it were, ""aside."" She is one"
447,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"of those deaf persons, I said to myself, who can understand what others,"
448,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"with whom they are familiar, have to say when they see the motion of"
449,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,their lips. I once met with a man who had this singular gift. He
450,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"possessed it to such an extent, that strangers, who conversed with him,"
451,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,never knew that he did not hear a word which they spoke. Yet what could
452,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"I do now! I was compelled to hear what was said. How strange it was,"
453,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"that the good lady overlooked the fact, that I must hear all that could"
454,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,be heard by Dinah. And this Dinah was now informed what set of china
455,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,should be placed on the table for my special benefit. From what she
456,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"hinted, I inferred, that there was some special honor in this"
457,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"arrangement; as it proved to her that the Holemans, who took tea with"
458,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"them the night before, having made use of a decidedly inferior service,"
459,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"were some grades less respectable than myself--though the mistress, when"
460,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the insinuation was made, peremptorily declared, that the aforesaid"
461,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Holemans were very worthy people, and should always be treated with"
462,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"great respect, as valued friends, in her house. An occasion was also"
463,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"taken, on the mention of the white and gold china, to administer a"
464,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"cutting reproof to Mrs. Dinah, for a nick in the spout of the"
465,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"tea-pot,--which circumstantial evidence, clearly and hastily summed up,"
466,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"proved to be the result of carelessness in the kitchen. To this attack,"
467,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Dinah, as I must honestly testify, made persistent defense, and gave"
468,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,some most curious rebutting testimony. And I am also under obligation to
469,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"state, that even when most excited by the charge, she never even made"
470,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the most distant allusion, to the possibility that the cat had anything"
471,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,to do with this domestic calamity. Such was the honor of the kitchen in
472,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the good old times. I also learned, incidentally, some curious"
473,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"information concerning the comparative ages of some chickens, which had"
474,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,lately been cooped up and fattened.
475,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
476,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"I gleaned besides, some antiquarian lore concerning a venerated"
477,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""comfortable,"" that was intended for my bed,--and a hint that some"
478,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,portion of its variegated lining had been the valued dress of a
479,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"grandmother, worn by her on some memorable occasion,--a proud record in"
480,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,the family history. Some very particular directions were also given for
481,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"my comfort, so that my ideas on the art of house-keeping, were greatly"
482,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"expanded; and I was ready to look on each lady, who ruleth over a house,"
483,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,as a minute philosopher.
484,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
485,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Dinah was also informed, that she was forbidden to act on a speculative"
486,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"principle, which she advanced, with great assurance; namely, that"
487,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"bachelors did not see, or know anything; that it was only married men"
488,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"who did; being set up to it by their wives, who made a mighty fuss in"
489,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"another house, when all the time they knew things wasn't as tidy at"
490,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,home. She was told not to act on any such miserable sophistry--that
491,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"things were to be done right, and kept right--no matter whether any one"
492,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"noticed them, or not. In the course of conversation, my having come from"
493,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,New York was the subject of an allusion; whereupon the dark woman
494,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"slipped in the observation, that she did wish she could get to that"
495,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"place, for she ""was afraid that she should die, and have nothing to"
496,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"tell."""
497,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
498,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"After all this important business was transacted, there was a hasty, and"
499,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"sudden digression for a moment, in the shape of a kind inquiry into the"
500,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"present state of the health of the hopeful heir of the said Dinah, who"
501,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"was spending the chief portion of his days in a cradle. I was, I must"
502,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"confess it, very much astonished to learn, from the reply and"
503,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"descriptions of the mother, that there is such a wonderful sympathy,"
504,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"between the teeth which are trying to make their way into the world, and"
505,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,the mechanism of a juvenile which is concealed from human sight in his
506,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,body. It seemed to me a marvellous proof of the manner in which such
507,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"little creatures maintain their hold on life, that he could possibly"
508,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"have endured such astonishing internal pains; and, also, that all the"
509,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"world ought to know the sovereign virtues of an elixir, which was"
510,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"compounded at Overlook House. Its virtues, unlike the novel devices that"
511,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"are palmed on the public with such pretentious certificates, have been"
512,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,tested by the infants of several generations.
513,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
514,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"All cabinet meetings must have an end. So Dinah disappeared, after a"
515,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"furtive glance at my person; drawing her conclusions, I am assured,"
516,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,whether I would be a suitable husband for Miss Meta.
517,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
518,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Soon after the hall door opened, and this young lady entered. Her mother"
519,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"introduced me to her in the same high pitch of voice, in which she"
520,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,conducted her conversation with strangers.
521,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
522,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,She said a few kind and pleasant words to me; and with a voice raised to
523,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"an imitation of the maternal precedent, though without the loss of its"
524,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"indescribable sweetness. She was evidently anxious, that her mother"
525,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"should feel, that she was to be a party in our brief conversation."
526,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
527,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"As I looked at her, I thought that a sweeter, more etherial form, a face"
528,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"more radiant with affections pure as the air over the snow, an eye to"
529,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"rest on you, as if it said, that every one on whom it fell was a new"
530,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"object for sympathy, had never met my view, and I thought then, and"
531,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"think now the more confidently, that I have made a good use of my eyes"
532,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,during my pilgrimage in the world. After the interchange of the few
533,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"words to which I have alluded, she was about leaving us; but before she"
534,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"reached the door, her mother called to her, and arrested her steps. The"
535,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"good lady addressed her, in the same low tones in which she had formerly"
536,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,conversed with Dinah.
537,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
538,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"As I looked at her again, I felt that I repressed the exhibition of"
539,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"signs of unrestrained admiration. She seemed, indeed, as if she had"
540,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"grown up in the midst of the beauty of the natural world, and had been"
541,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"moulded to a conformity with all that we witness of grace in the field,"
542,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"or in the forest. The mother spoke in a manner half playful, half"
543,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"serious. ""So Miss Meta this is the old way. You expected the arrival of"
544,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"this young gentleman, quiet, good-looking, evidently a person of good"
545,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"sense, and your father says, of most estimable character. And there you"
546,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"have on your old shawl, your old bonnet, and your hair blown about in"
547,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,the wind as if it had never had a brush applied to it. You are so
548,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,careless about your appearance! You know that I have often spoken to you
549,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"on the subject. And yet, on the most important occasions, you neglect"
550,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,all my advice. You will be laid upon the shelf yet. You will die an old
551,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"maid. But do not blame me. Do go, and brush your hair, and put on"
552,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"another frock, and make yourself presentable. And after that, go and see"
553,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"that Dinah arranges everything right. I will give you credit for order,"
554,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"and expertness as a house-keeper. Old maids, however, are often very"
555,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"good house-keepers. So go, and do as I tell you. I don't mean to say"
556,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"that you are a dowdy, but I want to see you more particular."""
557,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
558,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""My revered mother,"" said Meta, with a most grave inclination of the"
559,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"head, and with a slight pomp of declamation, ""your will is law. My"
560,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"dress, for the next two or three weeks, shall be a grand deceit, as if"
561,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"it was my habit to be as particular as the young Quakeress, who once"
562,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"visited us, and who was as exact in arranging her robes, as the snow is,"
563,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"in taking care, that there shall be grace in its unblemished drifts. I"
564,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"intend, in fact, to be irresistible. Henceforth let all young men,"
565,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"quiet, respectable, who have not cross eyes, and who fascinate a mother,"
566,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,and give occasion to all her sanguine hopes of matrimonial felicity for
567,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"a daughter, beware of Meta. They are as sure of being captives, as the"
568,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"poor little rabbits I so pity, when once they unwisely venture, to"
569,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"nibble at the bait in one of Peter's celebrated traps. So, best of"
570,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"mothers, forgive the past. Wisest of counsellors, for a brief space,"
571,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"farewell."""
572,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
573,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"After the retreat of the daughter silence endured for a little while,"
574,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"while I walked to the window, and enjoyed the extensive and beautiful"
575,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"view. The residence of the Judge was on a hill, overlooking a"
576,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"picturesque village, and hence the name of the mansion which in time"
577,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"dispelled a very ugly name, from the small town, and gave its own"
578,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,designation to the place--the name of such a collection of dwellings
579,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,generally becoming permanent when the post-office is established in its
580,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,limits. After this I was engaged in the survey of some fine old plates
581,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"upon the wall, and the picture of a portly old gentleman, whose dress"
582,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,indicated that he had lived in the olden time. I was seeking to find
583,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"some clue to his character and history in his face, when Mrs. Almore"
584,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"rose, and crossed the room and joined me."
585,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
586,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,It was evident that the picture was too important for me to look upon it
587,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"and not know what was due of admiration for him, of whom this uncertain"
588,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"resemblance was all that remained on earth,--the frail shadow of a"
589,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"shadow. I saw at once that she had a formidable history to relate, and"
590,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,that she had often told it to those who gazed on the form on the wall. I
591,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,suspected that some family pride was gratified by the narrative; and
592,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"prepared myself for some harmless amusement, as I was to watch and"
593,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,observe how the vanity would expose itself. But she had not got beyond
594,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"some dry statistics, the name, the age, the offices held in the State in"
595,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the good olden time, when such honors were always a pledge of merit in"
596,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the possessors, before the Judge entered the room, without our observing"
597,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"it. He drew near, heard for a moment, with the greatest astonishment,"
598,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the loud tones of the lady, who now addressed me."
599,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
600,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"He extended his hand to me, with very kind, but dignified, courtesy,"
601,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"and, after giving the assurance that I was most truly welcome on my own"
602,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"account, and for the sake of my father, who had been a fellow-student"
603,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"with him at Princeton College, and almost a life-long friend, he turned"
604,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"to the lady by us, his honored wife, and exclaimed,--"
605,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
606,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""My dear, I heard your elevated voice outside of the house, and in the"
607,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,extreme end of the hall. You really alarmed me. At first I could not
608,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,imagine what had occurred in the room. Why do you speak in such tones of
609,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,thunder to my young friend? Is this a new style of hospitality for
610,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"Overlook-House?"""
611,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
612,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""You told me that our guest, Mr. Martin, was deaf."" So spoke the good"
613,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"hostess, with a look of frightened inquiry, a perturbed glance at"
614,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"myself,--with a countenance that expressed a desire for relief,--while"
615,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,her tone was expressive of a great misgiving.
616,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
617,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""I beg your pardon,"" said the Judge; ""you are under an entire mistake. I"
618,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"told you that he wrote to me, some time ago, that he had met with an"
619,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,accident and become very lame. But when I told you this I remember that
620,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,you were very much abstracted. I presume that you were deeply absorbed
621,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"in some new order for your household, or in the state of Dinah's noisy"
622,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,heir. I never heard that Mr. Martin was deaf for a moment in his life. I
623,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"told you that he was lame."""
624,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
625,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""Are you sure--are you sure that he is not deaf?"""
626,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
627,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""I am sure that he hears as well as either of us. And,--at least as far"
628,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"as you are concerned, that is to say that he could not have a better"
629,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"sense of hearing. He might possibly, it is true, be abstracted, when"
630,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"any one spoke to him, and imagine that he said 'deaf,' when in reality"
631,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the speaker said 'lame.'"""
632,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
633,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""Dear me! my future peace is destroyed. It is worse than if a ghost"
634,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,intended perpetually to haunt me--for the ghost would come only in the
635,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,dark; but this disaster will torture me day and night. I have buried
636,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"myself under a mass of ruins from which I cannot extricate myself."" And"
637,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,the lady looked as if an anaconda was threatening to creep in among us.
638,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
639,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""I am sure that Mr. Martin will forgive you. He has only been annoyed by"
640,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,a loud conversation for a short time. It will be a pleasing variety to
641,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,hear you address him in a gentle voice. Since he had such evidence of
642,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"the pains you have taken to entertain him when you thought him deaf, he"
643,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,is assured that you will not change your desire to make him feel at home

645,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,
646,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"""Judge, you have no sympathy. You should have taken care that I did not"
647,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"fall into such a terrible mistake. I often notice that you speak to me,"
648,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"and turn and go away, as if you never watched to observe whether I"
649,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"understood you or no. I have often felt it, Judge, often felt"
650,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"it,--although I kept my feelings on the subject to myself. And now you"
651,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,see the consequences. You see where you have landed me. And I am the one
652,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,to suffer all the evil that results from such indifference. What shall
653,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"I do? Here is Meta. Meta, what shall I do? Mr. Martin is not at all"
654,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"deaf. Somehow, your father did not impress what he said on my mind. I am"
655,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"sure that this is not the first time that I have misunderstood him, and"
656,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,I never have any desire to fall into error. People that are so accurate
657,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"and so careful as he is, not to be guilty of any mistake in their"
658,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"professional duties, so accurate as they say he is when on the bench,"
659,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"are often careless of smaller matters at home. Meta, Mr. Martin can"

681,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,expression of the anxiety of a mother that her daughter should not
682,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,attain the condition of some of the best people on the earth. I allude
683,_THE WELCOME AT OVERLOOK-HOUSE._,"to a class of my sex who are ignorantly, I will not say uncharitably,"

727,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
728,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"The day after my arrival, Miss Meta and I were returning home, after we"
729,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,had driven several miles over the country in a sleigh. Our nearest
730,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"conception of the ecstasy of those who shall hereafter have wings, with"
731,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"which they can fly over earth and sea, on a bright morning, racing with"
732,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the larks, or some ambitious hawk, or, on some most fortunate hour, even"
733,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"with the eagle, is attained when we glide thus over the snow. But far"
734,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"above all the other pleasure of the time, was the sweet companionship of"
735,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"her whose laugh was merrier than the bells, which Cæsar had hung around"
736,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the horses with a profuse generosity. I have wondered at the mysterious
737,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,manner in which some of the loveliest beings with which God enriches
738,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"this earth are developed before our view, on occasions when we might"
739,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,expect that we should obtain the least insight into their character.
740,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
741,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"How is it that the ineffable purity of a woman, her depth of affection,"
742,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"her capacity for sympathy, which even in its lesser degrees renders her"
743,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"such a blessing in a world of so much trial, can, in some instances of"
744,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"great perfection, appear with such evidence in a few words, in an act"
745,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"which requires but little self-denial, in a tone of sorrow for small"
746,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"suffering, or of joy for some one who is happy! There are some men in"
747,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,whom you place perfect confidence as soon as you once behold the eye
748,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"kindled with an earnest expression, and hear their voice. After all the"
749,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,disappointments one endures in life from misplaced trust one may freely
750,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"confess that if we have spent many years on the earth, and at last say"
751,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"in our hearts there are none in whose professions we can repose, the"
752,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"fault is in ourselves. We judge ourselves to be true men, and we cannot"
753,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"be a miracle, standing alone as such, amid all the rest of the human"
754,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,family. But if we can assuredly pronounce of some men that they are
755,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,worthy of our utmost confidence as soon as we become acquainted with
756,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"them, much more can we confide in our impressions, thus quickly formed,"
757,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,of some of the gentler portion of our race. How many years have passed
758,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,since I formed my first impressions of Meta! and how true they were!
759,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"Quickly, inaudible prophecies, in their silence arresting your mind and"
760,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"eliciting homage, were made known in her presence, and gave promise of"
761,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,endless charities to adorn her daily life. There was an imperious
762,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"necessity in her noble nature, elevated as no power of earth could"
763,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"accomplish, to perform with strict exactness even the least duties, as"
764,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,one who heard him say that the least of his commandments can by its
765,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,observance aid us to the attainment of the true life.
766,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
767,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,An enthusiast might have said that her very laugh was too pure for
768,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"earth. All pure influences, too good for us, are needed by our"
769,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,necessities. It is well for earth that we have not only those among us
770,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"who, though not criminal in human estimate, are of the earth earthy, and"
771,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,of whom the world is worthy. Her joy always proclaimed the freedom given
772,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the blest here below, and that it never could subvert the deep gravity"
773,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"of her nature--as the bark that moves so gaily in the sun and wind, by a"
774,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"sudden check reminds us that it cannot drift into danger, but is secure;"
775,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,for the hidden anchor holds in its just bounds.
776,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
777,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"We had crossed a stream upon the ice, and were now ascending the hill"
778,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,from whose summit we could see Overlook-House in the distance. The great
779,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,forest was on either side of the way. Suddenly we espied three men
780,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,holding a consultation over an immense log. It had just been severed
781,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"from a huge tree, which the saw and axe had laid low, the great branches"
782,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"sweeping the snow as they came crushing down into heaps, and here and"
783,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,there revealing the dead leaves and the wintry grass.
784,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
785,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"Near them stood--models of patience--four oxen, looking as if the cold"
786,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"air could never discompose them, and attached to a sled whose strong"
787,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,runners seemed to defy any weight that could be heaped upon them. I
788,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,recognized the men as servants belonging on the estate of the Judge.
789,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"They were negroes, slaves,--slaves in name, awaiting a near year of"
790,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,emancipation fixed by the law of the State. They were perfectly aware
791,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,that they could have their freedom at any time from their
792,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"master,--freedom in name; for they now possessed it in reality."
793,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
794,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Nothing could be more comfortable than their general appearance. Their
795,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"dress was warm, and such as any laboring man could desire. At the"
796,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,present moment their happiness seemed perfect. They surrounded the log
797,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"with an exhibition of exuberant animal spirits, with transport in such"
798,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,excess that it never could have been crowded into the frame of a white
799,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,man.
800,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
801,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"As we drew near, one was demanding attention, in a most triumphant"
802,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"manner, to sundry vast knots which protruded from the log. Then the trio"
803,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"made the wood ring with shouts of merriment, and threw themselves into"
804,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,inimitable contortions.
805,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
806,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"""What causes all this excitement?"" I asked. ""Why should that log cause"
807,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"all the effect which the greatest wit could hope to produce?"" ""They are"
808,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"preparing,"" was the answer, ""a back-log for the kitchen chimney. It is"
809,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"to be put in the fire-place this evening, the night before Christmas,"
810,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,after all the fire has burnt down required for an evening meal. As long
811,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"as any portion of it lasts, they have holiday. In winter they have so"
812,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"little to do, that it would puzzle them to say what change the holiday"
813,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,makes in their labor. Their imagination acts on a traditionary custom.
814,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Hence they take it for granted that they have an easier time than in the
815,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,month before or after. They go into the wood and select the largest tree
816,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,and the one which can afford the log most likely to last. Before they
817,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"retire to rest, they take great care to arrange the brands and coals so"
818,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,that it shall not burn during the night. They often throw water upon it
819,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"when it seems to burn too rapidly. And as to their wisdom, I think that"
820,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"on the present occasion they have made an admirable choice."""
821,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
822,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"We now drew near, and spoke to the Africans. They eagerly called the"
823,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,attention of their young mistress to the wonderful qualities of the
824,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,severed trunk. Assertions were made concerning fabulous quantities of
825,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"buckwheat-cakes, that would be eaten before that vast cylinder would be"
826,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,reduced to ashes. There was not the slightest idea that any member of
827,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the family of the Judge would feel the least interest different from
828,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,their own. In fact they felt that all joined them in their conspiracy
829,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"against--they knew not what,--a conspiracy for some great imaginable"

840,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"Happily, before I could summon my philosophical knowledge for practical"

842,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"which would do honor to my Alma Mater, while I, in a lucid manner,"
843,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"removed the perplexity of my inquirer, he was called away to make"
844,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,diligent use of one of the great levers provided for the occasion. The
845,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"rolling of the log on the sled was hard work,--so hard that I gave Meta"
846,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the reins, and volunteered my assistance. I did well as to the physical"
847,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"application of power. Yet I found these men, in this instance, possessed"
848,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,of more practical natural philosophy than myself. The toil was seasoned
849,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"with much wit,--that is to say, wit if the laughter was to be the test."
850,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,And there is no epicure who can exceed the African in enjoyment when he
851,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,is feasting on his own witticisms.
852,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
853,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Meta told me that I must by all means be a witness to the process of
854,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"rolling the log on the kitchen hearth. So we led the way home, our fleet"
855,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"horses leaving the oxen, with their vast and important load, far behind"
856,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"us. On our arrival home, we found the wife of the doctor, with the Judge"
857,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"and his good lady. She was a pleasant person, and added to the"
858,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,conversation of the evening the remarks of an acute and cultivated mind.
859,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"She had one protruding weakness. It was her pride in her family, which"
860,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,was a very respectable one in the part of the country from which she
861,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"came. She had been educated in the idea, that they were the greatest"
862,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"people in the world,--a wide-spread delusion in the land. This led her"
863,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"to assure me, at least a dozen times in the evening that her family were"
864,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"very ""peculiar."" ""This tea very fine! Yes, it is remarkably good. I am"
865,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"sure that it cannot be excelled. And I must say to you, that my family"
866,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,are very peculiar. They are very peculiar in their fondness for
867,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"excellent tea."""
868,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
869,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"""The Judge's family not exclusive! No; certainly they are very much"
870,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"beloved, and, mingling with others, have done great good to our"
871,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"community. But I must say that my family are, perhaps, too exclusive."
872,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"They are peculiar, very peculiar. They do not like to associate with"
873,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"uncongenial persons."""
874,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
875,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"""What a grand Christmas fire! Well I suppose I inherit the love of such"
876,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"a blaze. How cheerful it is! Well my family are peculiar, very peculiar;"
877,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"they always like to have a cheerful, a good warm fire. They are"
878,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"peculiar."" So ""peculiar"" I soon discovered meant that they were very"
879,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"remarkable, very distinguished people. It was to be supposed that all"
880,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"that they did, indicated that they were made of clay finer than all the"
881,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,rest used in the formation of other people. Common things touched by
882,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"their hands became gilded and refined. Wherever they were, there was a"
883,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"pyramid above the common elevation, and on its summit was their"
884,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,appropriate place. Was the doctor on that platform? Or was he only
885,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,holding to it by his elbows and yet with his feet far above the earth on
886,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,which common men had their place where they could stand?
887,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
888,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"With the exception of this folly the lady was, as I have said, an"
889,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,acquisition to our evening party. She was evidently one who had a kind
890,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"heart, and devotedly attached to her Lord and Master. In after days I"
891,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,found her to be one of my most valued friends and advisers. As respects
892,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"their ability to become such true friends, an ability which truly"
893,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"ennobles man, I have no doubt that her family were peculiar, very"
894,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,peculiar indeed.
895,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
896,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"The evening was quickly passing away when we were summoned, according to"
897,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the order which Meta had given, to the wing of the house where was the"
898,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"kitchen, that we might see the great log rolled into the fire-place. The"
899,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"kitchen was a very large room, such as were built of old by prosperous"
900,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"settlers in our land, when they had acquired enough of this world's"
901,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"goods, to make such additions to the log cabin in which they began their"
902,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"farming life, as they in their full ambition of space could desire."
903,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
904,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,How often are the dwelling-houses in our country a curious history of
905,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the gradual increase of a family in prosperity!
906,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
907,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"The kitchen of the Judge was evidently designed by a frontier architect,"
908,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,as a great hall of refuge for a large family. The windows were planned
909,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"when there need not be loop-holes where Indians prowled around, and"
910,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,might need the admonition of a rifle-ball to teach them to keep at a
911,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"respectful distance. The glasses in them were small, and the pieces of"
912,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,wood in which they were inserted would have been strong enough for the
913,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"rounds of a ladder. There was room for all things. One could churn,"
914,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"another spin, another mend a net; children could find appropriate nooks"
915,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,where they could con the spelling-book and study the multiplication
916,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,table in times when the rod was not spared; neighbors making a friendly
917,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,call could find a vacant space where they could sit and partake of cider
918,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"and homely cakes, and if they had any special business, which a citizen"
919,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"would settle in two minutes, could spend an hour in preliminaries of a"
920,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"very vague kind, in generalities not glittering, and coming to the"
921,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"subject, only when they were farthest from it, and all could be"
922,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,transacted without any one being in the least degree incommoded.
923,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
924,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,One of the prominent objects in the kitchen at Overlook-House was the
925,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"rafters above you. The ceiling was resting upon them, in the form of"
926,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"thick boards, which were the floor of the rooms above. From these guns"
927,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"were suspended on wooden forks, just as they were cut from the tree and"
928,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,stripped of their bark. Fishing rods were hung there in the same manner.
929,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,In some places parcels of dried herbs were tied to large nails driven
930,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"into the timbers. Here and there a board was nailed to the rafters,"
931,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,forming a shelf. On one side of the room was a great bench with a board
932,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,back much higher than the head of any person who could sit upon
933,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"it,--which back by an ingenious device could be let down and make a"
934,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"table,--the rude sofa beneath answering for solid legs."
935,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
936,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Near this useful combination was a box on rockers--as a cradle. There
937,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,lay the heir of Dinah. Its little dark head on the white pillow was like
938,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"a large blackberry, could it have existed out of its season and fallen"
939,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"on the pure snow. Dinah, who was near it, was a character. Her sayings"
940,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,were memorable. One day she was speaking of a bad man who had found his
941,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"way for a brief season to Overlook, and said in a state of great"
942,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"indignation, for he had cheated the people by some act of bare-faced"
943,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"villany, ""Master, if the devil doesn't get that man I want any of the"
944,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"folks to tell me what is the use of having a devil?"""
945,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
946,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,But the most singular portion of the room was the great fire-place and
947,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the arrangements connected with it. It was a structure perfectly
948,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"enormous, and the stones required for its erection must have made a"
949,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,large opening in the quarry. It was deep and high. An ox could easily
950,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,have been roasted whole before it. Over it was a shelf which no one in
951,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,these degenerate days could reach. On either side were two small
952,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"closets,--made in the deep wall,--the door of each being made from a"
953,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"wide plank, and secured by a large wooden button. In the back of the"
954,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"fire-place, on one side of it, was the door of a great oven,--rivalling"
955,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"in size, I presume, the tomb of the ancient grandee in the east--where"
956,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the traveler slept, perhaps on some of the very dust of the proud man"
957,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,who gloried in the expectation of a kingly sepulchre. On either side of
958,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the room on a line with the vast fire-place were two doors opening into
959,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the air, and exactly opposite to each other. The broad hearth extended"
960,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"from door to door, being flagged with large smooth stones. Each door was"
961,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"framed of heavy oaken timber,--the boards in consequence of the depths"
962,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"of the frame being sunk as deep panels. Each had a heavy wooden latch,"
963,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,and a vast curved piece of wood was the handle by which it was to be
964,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,opened.
965,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
966,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"On the great pavement in front of the fire-place stood Cæsar, a man"
967,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,with a frame finely developed. His twin brother Pompey dwelt on an
968,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"adjoining farm,--so resembling him as one of the colored people said"
969,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"that you could ""scarcely tell them apart, they were so like one another,"
970,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"especially Pomp."" He had a rough coat thrown over him,--a fur-cap on his"
971,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"head, and he held in one hand an iron chain that trailed on the stone"
972,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,hearth and in the other a lantern emitting a blaze of light.
973,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
974,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,When we were all in our places Cæsar directed one of the boys to open
975,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,the door on the right hand. There on the snow revealed by the light of
976,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"his lantern, was the famous log on a line parallel with the stone paving"
977,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"that crossed the end of the room. Around this log, he with the help of"
978,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the boy fastened the iron chain, securing it with a spike partially"
979,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,driven into the wood with a heavy hammer. The door on the left was then
980,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"thrown open, and we saw by the lights borne by several of the laborers,"
981,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,that the oxen which had drawn the great segment of the trunk from the
982,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,forest were standing there upon the snow waiting to complete their labor
983,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,for the evening. The long chain extending across the whole width of the
984,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,room was drawn through the door and fastened to the yokes of the oxen.
985,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
986,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Then came the chief excitement of the time. A quantity of snow was
987,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"thrown down at the entrance where the log lay in ponderous quiet, and"
988,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,beaten down with spades and the heavy boots of the men. All were now
989,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,directed to stand some distance from the chain for fear of any accident.
990,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,Then Cæsar gave the order. There was a sudden movement without. The
991,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"words of command which oxen are supposed to know, were spoken to put"
992,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,them in motion. There was a loud snapping of whips. The chain was heaved
993,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,in the air and rose and fell. The huge log was drawn forward. It passed
994,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the door and glided along on the stone pavement, like a great ship"
995,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"moving through the water after its sails have suddenly been lowered, and"
996,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,it proceeds by its acquired impulse. When it had reached the front of
997,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"the vast aperture where it was to be slowly consumed, Cæsar gave his"
998,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"prompt order. It was immediately obeyed, and the oxen were brought to a"
999,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,pause in their exertions. It was evident from the absence of explanation
1000,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"to those without, and from the perfect composure of the master of the"
1001,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"ceremony, that similar scenes were of frequent occurrence."
1002,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
1003,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"The chain being removed and the oxen led away, the log was rolled by the"
1004,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"application of the levers to its place. There it lay, the crushed snow"
1005,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"melting and falling on the hot hearth, the singing sound of the steam"
1006,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,rising from the stones.
1007,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,
1008,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,So there was the measure of the fancied increase of freedom from labor
1009,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,during the Christmas season. Nothing now remained but the gathering of
1010,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,all the household to the evening devotions. The Judge read the
1011,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"Scriptures, and after the singing of a hymn offered up the prayers."
1012,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"There was an indescribable reality in the attention, and a fervor in the"
1013,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,kneeling church in the house. It led you to reflect how One who came
1014,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,down from above and took our nature upon him has taught man how to make
1015,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,his life on earth the dawn of an eternal day. I had felt the presence of
1016,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,God in the shades of the great mountain forest during past hours. But
1017,_THE CHRISTMAS LOG IN THE KITCHEN._,"here in the stillness of this evening worship, as the light of the"

1555,"_DR. BENSON, OR THE LIVING MAN EMBALMED FOR TWENTY YEARS._",
1556,"_DR. BENSON, OR THE LIVING MAN EMBALMED FOR TWENTY YEARS._",He must live. So I sought him when the red star was over the mountain.

1634,"_DR. BENSON, OR THE LIVING MAN EMBALMED FOR TWENTY YEARS._",
1635,"_DR. BENSON, OR THE LIVING MAN EMBALMED FOR TWENTY YEARS._",He had made a fearful mistake. The cup of whisky which he had poured out

1811,PART FIRST.,To all the unknown teachings of her home.
1812,PART FIRST.,
1813,PART FIRST.,"The wild-flower's beauty passed into her thoughts,"
1814,PART FIRST.,"And as she gazed, and saw in earth and sky,"
1815,PART FIRST.,"In every form the love of God stream forth,"
1816,PART FIRST.,She knew of beauty that could never fade.
1817,PART FIRST.,"For He, from whom these emanations came,"
1818,PART FIRST.,Will never cease to be a God revealed.
1819,PART FIRST.,
1820,PART FIRST.,"Happy the child, for her fond parents both"
1821,PART FIRST.,Had souls to kindle with her sympathies.
1822,PART FIRST.,"They learned anew with her the blessed love,"
1823,PART FIRST.,Which makes the pure like children all their days.
1824,PART FIRST.,"With her pure mind repassed the former way,"
1825,PART FIRST.,Their age and youth blended at once in her.
1826,PART FIRST.,
1827,PART FIRST.,There was a small church in the little town
1828,PART FIRST.,"Of Bristol, some miles distant, over which"
1829,PART FIRST.,A loving pastor ruled with watchful care.
1830,PART FIRST.,"He came from England,--and but few had known"
1831,PART FIRST.,"That he was bishop, of that secret line"
1832,PART FIRST.,"Which Ken, and other loyalists prolonged,"
1833,PART FIRST.,Prepared for any changes in the realm.
1834,PART FIRST.,The good man loved his people at the ford.
1835,PART FIRST.,The child's expanding mind had ample seals
1836,PART FIRST.,Of his kind guidance. From his store of books
1837,PART FIRST.,He culled the treasures for her thoughtful eye.
1838,PART FIRST.,
1839,PART FIRST.,"Another memorable influence,"
1840,PART FIRST.,"To add refining grace, came from the town."
1841,PART FIRST.,"One, whose sweet beauty threw a woman's charm"
1842,PART FIRST.,"Over a household, seeking health in air,"
1843,PART FIRST.,"That rustles forest leaves, that sweeps the fields,"
1844,PART FIRST.,"Came to their home, and was not useless there."
1845,PART FIRST.,
1846,PART FIRST.,"She threw round Ellen, in resplendent light,"
1847,PART FIRST.,"What Ellen knew before, in fainter day."
1848,PART FIRST.,
1849,PART FIRST.,"The lady was so true in all her grace,"
1850,PART FIRST.,"Such open nature, that the child, all heart,"
1851,PART FIRST.,"Could think, could love, could be as one with her."
1852,PART FIRST.,"How sad, that the refinement of the world,"
1853,PART FIRST.,Should often be the cost of all that's true!
1854,PART FIRST.,
1855,PART FIRST.,"From the volcano's side the dreadful stream,"
1856,PART FIRST.,"That buried the great city, pressed its way,"
1857,PART FIRST.,To every room of refuge. Prison ne'er
1858,PART FIRST.,Gave bondage like those dark and awful homes.
1859,PART FIRST.,Around each form came the encrusting clay:
1860,PART FIRST.,Death at the moment. Dying ne'er so still.
1861,PART FIRST.,In passing ages all the form was gone:
1862,PART FIRST.,"The dark clay held the shapes of what had been,"
1863,PART FIRST.,"And when the beauteous city was exhumed,"
1864,PART FIRST.,"Into those hollows, moulds of former life,"
1865,PART FIRST.,"They poured the plaster, and regained the form,"
1866,PART FIRST.,"Of men, or women, as they were at death."
1867,PART FIRST.,"So all that lives in nature, in the heart,"
1868,PART FIRST.,"Is often, living, buried by the world,"
1869,PART FIRST.,By its dead stream. Dust only can remain.
1870,PART FIRST.,And in its place the statue--outward all
1871,PART FIRST.,The form of beauty--the pretense of soul.
1872,PART FIRST.,
1873,PART FIRST.,How the child basked in all her loveliness!
1874,PART FIRST.,"Unconscious, she was moulded day by day,"
1875,PART FIRST.,"Sweet buds that in her heart strove to unfold,"
1876,PART FIRST.,Had waited for that sun. And Ellen saw
1877,PART FIRST.,Her mother in changed aspect. The soft charms
1878,PART FIRST.,"Of her new friend, revealed at once in her,"
1879,PART FIRST.,More of the woman's natural tenderness.
1880,PART FIRST.,
1881,PART FIRST.,"The gentle child, had not a single love"
1882,PART FIRST.,For all the varied scenes of bank and stream--
1883,PART FIRST.,"And these to her were almost all the earth,"
1884,PART FIRST.,But as each glory centered round her home.
1885,PART FIRST.,If the descending sun threw down the light
1886,PART FIRST.,"Tinged with the mellow hues of autumn leaves,"
1887,PART FIRST.,"Upon the waters till they shone as gold,"
1888,PART FIRST.,And yet diminished not the million flames
1889,PART FIRST.,"That burnt upon the trees, all unconsumed,"
1890,PART FIRST.,It was to her a joy. But deeper joy
1891,PART FIRST.,"Came with the thought, that all her eye surveyed,"
1892,PART FIRST.,"Was but a repetition of the scene,"
1893,PART FIRST.,"When her fond mother, at some former day,"
1894,PART FIRST.,Had by her side blessed God for these his works.
1895,PART FIRST.,And all the softest murmurs of the air
1896,PART FIRST.,"Recalled her father's step, and his true voice."
1897,PART FIRST.,"Thus home entwined itself with every thought,"
1898,PART FIRST.,As that great vine with all that wide-branched oak.
1899,PART FIRST.,
1900,PART FIRST.,
1901,PART SECOND.,PART SECOND.
1902,PART SECOND.,
1903,PART SECOND.,"And in this quiet scene, the child grew up,"
1904,PART SECOND.,"To know not inequalities of lot,"
1905,PART SECOND.,Of any rank dissevering man from man.
1906,PART SECOND.,"Once from the splendid coach, the city dame"
1907,PART SECOND.,And her young daughter entered the Ford Inn.
1908,PART SECOND.,
1909,PART SECOND.,As Ellen gazed upon the little one
1910,PART SECOND.,"Whose eye recalled the dove, and then the gleam"
1911,PART SECOND.,"That morning threw upon her much loved waves,"
1912,PART SECOND.,"And on the tresses, like the chesnut fringe"
1913,PART SECOND.,"In full luxuriance, she came forth and stood"
1914,PART SECOND.,"With such a guileless, and admiring love,"
1915,PART SECOND.,That tenderness was won. And then they strolled
1916,PART SECOND.,"O'er Ellen's favorite haunts. She asked the child,"
1917,PART SECOND.,"Have you such waters, and such trees beside"
1918,PART SECOND.,Your home far off? The little languid eye
1919,PART SECOND.,"Gazed vacantly on all the beauty there,"
1920,PART SECOND.,"And then, as one who had not heard the words,"
1921,PART SECOND.,And least of all could give forth a response
1922,PART SECOND.,"To nature's loving call, even as it passed"
1923,PART SECOND.,"To her, through Ellen's eyes, and Ellen's voice,"
1924,PART SECOND.,"And from her kindled soul,--she turned again,"
1925,PART SECOND.,"Absorbed in the small wagon which they drew,"
1926,PART SECOND.,And to the stones they skimmed upon the stream.
1927,PART SECOND.,
1928,PART SECOND.,"Just for a brief space, down there seemed to fall"
1929,PART SECOND.,A veil between the two--a veil like night.
1930,PART SECOND.,"All Ellen's greater, deeper swell of tides"
1931,PART SECOND.,"Of soul, forever dashing on the cliffs"
1932,PART SECOND.,On which mind's ocean-great forever beat
1933,PART SECOND.,"Their swell of thunder, here could find no height"
1934,PART SECOND.,That could reverberate. And yet her heart
1935,PART SECOND.,"Was all too noble, high, serenely pure,"
1936,PART SECOND.,Too Christ-taught ever thus to stand apart.
1937,PART SECOND.,
1938,PART SECOND.,"The tender gentleness, the laughing eye,"
1939,PART SECOND.,"The soul responsive to the moment's joy,"
1940,PART SECOND.,"The power to love, the softening sympathy"
1941,PART SECOND.,"With every bird or squirrel that appeared,"
1942,PART SECOND.,"Or rabbit, scarce afraid, with wondering eye,"
1943,PART SECOND.,"The love of parents, her sweet talk of friends,"
1944,PART SECOND.,"And above all, a heart to beat so true"
1945,PART SECOND.,"To all that One in heaven had said to her,"
1946,PART SECOND.,Were most alluring powers. Ellen forgot
1947,PART SECOND.,Wherein they differed: And their souls then chimed
1948,PART SECOND.,"As sounds of bells, blended in summer's wind."
1949,PART SECOND.,"So, as if sunbeams faltering on the bank,"
1950,PART SECOND.,"The cloud departing, creep o'er all the green,"
1951,PART SECOND.,Her brightening interest rested on the child.
1952,PART SECOND.,
1953,PART SECOND.,"And when they parted at the bridge of logs,"
1954,PART SECOND.,"Though the child's dress was gorgeous, and the pomp"
1955,PART SECOND.,"Of city livery from the chariot shone,"
1956,PART SECOND.,"While the soft tear was in our Ellen's eye,"
1957,PART SECOND.,"There still dwelt all unknown in her sweet mind,"
1958,PART SECOND.,"All free from pride, the deep inspiring wish,"
1959,PART SECOND.,That she could raise this merry-hearted one
1960,PART SECOND.,"Above herself: and then there came the thought,"
1961,PART SECOND.,"Unconscious, causing sorrows--higher aims--"
1962,PART SECOND.,"That the one gone was poor, and she was rich."
1963,PART SECOND.,
1964,PART SECOND.,"There was a loneliness, and so she sought"
1965,PART SECOND.,Her mother; whose companionship was peace:
1966,PART SECOND.,Who ever won her to her wonted rest.
1967,PART SECOND.,
1968,PART SECOND.,There is a poetry in many hearts
1969,PART SECOND.,Which only blends with thought through tenderness:
1970,PART SECOND.,It never comes as light within the mind
1971,PART SECOND.,Creating forms of beauty for itself.
1972,PART SECOND.,"It has an eye, and ear for all the world"
1973,PART SECOND.,Can have of beauty. You will see it bend
1974,PART SECOND.,"Over the cradle, sorrow o'er the grave."
1975,PART SECOND.,"It knows of every human tie below,"
1976,PART SECOND.,The vast significance. Unto its God
1977,PART SECOND.,"It renders homage, giving incense clouds"
1978,PART SECOND.,"To waft its adorations. By the cross,"
1979,PART SECOND.,"It hears the voice, ""How holy all is here!"""
1980,PART SECOND.,"It speaks deep mysteries, and yet the clue"
1981,PART SECOND.,Is most apparent to the common mind.
1982,PART SECOND.,Its sayings fall like ancient memories;
1983,PART SECOND.,We so accept them. Natures such as these
1984,PART SECOND.,"Are often common-place, until the heart"
1985,PART SECOND.,"Is touched, and then the tones from gates of heaven."
1986,PART SECOND.,Such are the blessed to brighten human life--
1987,PART SECOND.,To give a glory to our earth-born thoughts--
1988,PART SECOND.,"To teach us how to act our deeds as kings,"
1989,PART SECOND.,Which we might else perform as weary slaves.
1990,PART SECOND.,"They give us wings, not sandals, for the road"
1991,PART SECOND.,Full of dry dust. And such the mother was.
1992,PART SECOND.,"So as we tell you of the child, there needs"
1993,PART SECOND.,"No voice to say, and such the woman was."
1994,PART SECOND.,
1995,PART SECOND.,"One day she sought her father in the field,"
1996,PART SECOND.,"Just before sunset, ready for his home."
1997,PART SECOND.,"And as they reached the rocks along the shore,"
1998,PART SECOND.,"Where the road turns, to meet the deep ravine,"
1999,PART SECOND.,"Nigh unto Farley, a faint cry for help"
2000,PART SECOND.,Rang in their ears. It was a manly voice
2001,PART SECOND.,"Grieving through pain. They turned aside, and found"
2002,PART SECOND.,"A stranger, who had fallen, as he leapt"
2003,PART SECOND.,From out his boat. His fallen gun and dress
2004,PART SECOND.,"Proclaimed the sportsman. Aid was soon at hand,"
2005,PART SECOND.,"And in their dwelling he found friends, and care."
2006,PART SECOND.,
2007,PART SECOND.,"Days past. His mother came, and soon she found"
2008,PART SECOND.,"He spake to Ellen, Ellen unto him;"
2009,PART SECOND.,"As they spake not to others. And it seemed,"
2010,PART SECOND.,"Such a perpetual reference in his talk,"
2011,PART SECOND.,"As if he had not now a single thought,"
2012,PART SECOND.,Which had not been compared with thought of hers.
2013,PART SECOND.,
2014,PART SECOND.,At first her pride was moved. And while she stood
2015,PART SECOND.,"Irresolute, the spell was fixed: as when"
2016,PART SECOND.,The power of spring thaws winter to itself.
2017,PART SECOND.,She knew her son was worthy: and she knew
2018,PART SECOND.,"Here, in the wide-world must he seek a wife."
2019,PART SECOND.,And in due time she was his fair-haired wife.
2020,PART SECOND.,
2021,PART SECOND.,They had a rural home across the stream.
2022,PART SECOND.,Their lights at night answered the cheerful light
2023,PART SECOND.,Of her paternal home. Their winter's fires
2024,PART SECOND.,"Mingled their gleam upon the dark night wave,"
2025,PART SECOND.,Or on the ice. By summer's winds her voice
2026,PART SECOND.,"Was wafted o'er the waters, as she sang:"
2027,PART SECOND.,And loving hearers blessed her in their hearts.
2028,PART SECOND.,
2029,PART SECOND.,"Oh! what a joy, when in her arms they placed"
2030,PART SECOND.,Her son--ah doomed to be her only born!
2031,PART SECOND.,Her cup of happiness seemed now so full.
2032,PART SECOND.,"And then the Father, knowing all to come,"
2033,PART SECOND.,"Gave her more grace, and so she loved him more,"
2034,PART SECOND.,"And had no Idol. But, as days rolled on"
2035,PART SECOND.,"Such sorrow came, I scarce can tell the tale."
2036,PART SECOND.,She saw her husband's manly strength all gone.
2037,PART SECOND.,
2038,PART SECOND.,"There was a withering tree, in the spring time,"
2039,PART SECOND.,"Which on the lawn, seemed struggling to assume"
2040,PART SECOND.,The Autumn's hues amid the world's full green.
2041,PART SECOND.,"He faintly smiled, and said, ""So do I fade."""
2042,PART SECOND.,Soon it was dead. He lingered slowly on.
2043,PART SECOND.,Hopes came: hopes faded. From the early world
2044,PART SECOND.,"'Tis the same story. It was well for her,"
2045,PART SECOND.,"In this her sorrow, she had learned to weep"
2046,PART SECOND.,"In days of bliss, as she had read the page"
2047,PART SECOND.,Which tells of Jesus bearing his own cross.
2048,PART SECOND.,
2049,PART SECOND.,"His mother came, but Ellen was repelled"
2050,PART SECOND.,By the stern brow of one who met the shock
2051,PART SECOND.,And would not quail. That hard and iron will
2052,PART SECOND.,Was so unlike _her_ firmness. She was one
2053,PART SECOND.,Who had ruled abjects. Sorrow seemed a wrong.
2054,PART SECOND.,
2055,PART SECOND.,The parting time drew near. And then as one
2056,PART SECOND.,"Who asked as one gives law. ""This little boy"
2057,PART SECOND.,Should dwell with me. Thereby shall he attain
2058,PART SECOND.,All discipline to form the noble man.
2059,PART SECOND.,"Even as I made his Father what he was,"
2060,PART SECOND.,"So will I now, again, care for the child."
2061,PART SECOND.,Let him with me. And he shall often come
2062,PART SECOND.,"And visit you. This surely will be wise."""
2063,PART SECOND.,We need not say that Ellen too was firm.
2064,PART SECOND.,
2065,PART SECOND.,"A mother's love! In all the world a power,"
2066,PART SECOND.,To educate as this! Could any wealth
2067,PART SECOND.,Of other learning recompense this loss!
2068,PART SECOND.,Would this stern woman ripen in his heart
2069,PART SECOND.,"Fruits, that angelic eyes beheld with joy?"
2070,PART SECOND.,"""When the boy grew, at times she'd gladly send"
2071,PART SECOND.,"With thanks, the child to all this proffered care."""
2072,PART SECOND.,But now--to send him now! Why at the thought
2073,PART SECOND.,A darkness gathered over all the world.
2074,PART SECOND.,"From all things came a voice, ""All, all alone,"
2075,PART SECOND.,"The husband is not--the child far away."""
2076,PART SECOND.,
2077,PART SECOND.,There was strange meaning in the angry eye;
2078,PART SECOND.,"A strange defiance, and an unknown threat,"
2079,PART SECOND.,Enmity and a triumph. As if a triumph gained.
2080,PART SECOND.,"A nation crushed, her husband's mother looked,"
2081,PART SECOND.,No flush was on her face--her voice the same.
2082,PART SECOND.,
2083,PART SECOND.,"Coldly she said, farewell. And Ellen held"
2084,PART SECOND.,"The child with firmer grasp, when she was gone."
2085,PART SECOND.,Then she had sorrow that they thus should part;
2086,PART SECOND.,"For she felt all the reverence death made due,"
2087,PART SECOND.,And also mourned rejection of her love.
2088,PART SECOND.,
2089,PART SECOND.,"As the child slept one night, watched by his nurse,"
2090,PART SECOND.,"She crossed the river on the bridge of logs,"
2091,PART SECOND.,To reach her parents. Under the bright stars
2092,PART SECOND.,"The Neshamony, and its hurried waves,"
2093,PART SECOND.,Rising and falling all around her path.
2094,PART SECOND.,No peace in all the Heavens that she could see
2095,PART SECOND.,"Was like her peace. ""I suffer here,"" she said,"
2096,PART SECOND.,"""But suffering, I shall learn more love for all."""
2097,PART SECOND.,
2098,PART SECOND.,"She had returned. Her footsteps died away,"
2099,PART SECOND.,"Her parents stood yet in the open air,"
2100,PART SECOND.,Where they had parted with her for the night.
2101,PART SECOND.,
2102,PART SECOND.,Then o'er the stream there came an awful cry.
2103,PART SECOND.,It was her cry. Oh agony to hear!
2104,PART SECOND.,It stilled all sounds besides. It seemed to make
2105,PART SECOND.,The wide-arched Heavens one call to echo it.
2106,PART SECOND.,"Parents and others rushed there with affright,"
2107,PART SECOND.,In breathless terror. Nurse and child were gone.
2108,PART SECOND.,"Each wood around, and every forest road"
2109,PART SECOND.,Gleamed all the night with torches. But no cheer
2110,PART SECOND.,Rose to proclaim a trace of faintest hope.
2111,PART SECOND.,"One traveler said, that on a distant road"
2112,PART SECOND.,"He met a carriage, hurrying with strange speed,"
2113,PART SECOND.,"And heard, in passing, cries of a young child."
2114,PART SECOND.,In vain they follow. Hopeless they return.
2115,PART SECOND.,
2116,PART SECOND.,"Oh wondrous, the ingenious plan devised"
2117,PART SECOND.,By that poor mother to regain her child!
2118,PART SECOND.,"Her parents tried, as if for life and death"
2119,PART SECOND.,To give her aid: and saw that she must die:
2120,PART SECOND.,For patience such as hers was all too grand
2121,PART SECOND.,To linger long on earth. She day by day
2122,PART SECOND.,Trod her old haunts. But never did she see
2123,PART SECOND.,"The Heaven, or beauteous world. Her pallid lips"
2124,PART SECOND.,Moved with perpetual prayer. And when she leaned
2125,PART SECOND.,"On those who loved her, the storm-tossed at rest,"
2126,PART SECOND.,"She was as quiet as in days, when she"
2127,PART SECOND.,Was but an infant. When they spoke of hope
2128,PART SECOND.,"She smiled. It was a smile of love, not hope."
2129,PART SECOND.,"It was indeed simplicity to one,"
2130,PART SECOND.,"Just on the threshold where His people pass,"
2131,PART SECOND.,"And where, forever, they have more than hope."
2132,PART SECOND.,
2133,PART SECOND.,"All saw that she attained a mystic life,"
2134,PART SECOND.,That was not of the earth. What might she had
2135,PART SECOND.,To love the sorrowing! By the dying bed
2136,PART SECOND.,"She seemed as if she had not known a pang,"
2137,PART SECOND.,Her voice so peaceful. Little children round
2138,PART SECOND.,Gazed sorrowful: and in their confused thought
2139,PART SECOND.,Deemed that the anguish of her little child
2140,PART SECOND.,"Weeping its mother, was her dying pain;"
2141,PART SECOND.,And thought how desolate fond hearts would be
2142,PART SECOND.,"If they were gone, as was her little one."
2143,PART SECOND.,
2144,PART SECOND.,"One sweet Lord's Day she knelt down at the rail,"
2145,PART SECOND.,"In her loved Church, and had forgot all grief,"
2146,PART SECOND.,"Receiving there the hallowed Bread and Wine,"
2147,PART SECOND.,"And the one shadowed forth had strengthened her,"
2148,PART SECOND.,So that she fed on food come down from Heaven.
2149,PART SECOND.,The others moved. But she was in her place.
2150,PART SECOND.,"The Pastor came, and found that she was dead."
2151,PART SECOND.,Oh how the tears of Christians fell that day!
2152,PART SECOND.,Oh how they thanked God for her good release!
2153,PART SECOND.,And so she went to her eternal rest.
2154,PART SECOND.,
2155,PART SECOND.,"But men, unreasoning, said they saw her form,"
2156,PART SECOND.,"Oft in the night, along the river shore--"
2157,PART SECOND.,"Oft at the Ford, which now is crossed no more."
2158,PART SECOND.,"And men will say, in firmness of belief,"
2159,PART SECOND.,"That when the Inn was closed, and no man dwelt"
2160,PART SECOND.,"In its forsaken walls, a light was seen"
2161,PART SECOND.,"In Ellen's room. And then they also say,"
2162,PART SECOND.,"That pure while flowers which never grew before,"
2163,PART SECOND.,"Now come with Spring, where her bright spirit walks."
2164,PART SECOND.,"My children say, that if you hear the owl"
2165,PART SECOND.,"Along her pathway, you may hasten on"
2166,PART SECOND.,Sure that her spirit will not meet you there.
2167,PART SECOND.,"But should you hear a bird of plaintive song,"
2168,PART SECOND.,"Break the night's stillness, then go far around"
2169,PART SECOND.,By field and wood--for you may see her form
2170,PART SECOND.,Along the shore she gladdened with her life--
2171,PART SECOND.,A shore of many sorrows at the last.

3540,_THE CLOUDS._,Life without Christ! That is but death.
3541,_THE CLOUDS._,Prayer without Christ!--but idle breath:

3680,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"In Pearl-run valley, not far from the noise and crowded streets of our"
3681,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"great Metropolis, the original forests, and a few unsightly rural"
3682,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"dwellings, have given place to a large number of those pleasant homes,"
3683,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"which citizens of wealth or of comfortable means, have erected for their"
3684,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"summer abodes. Hence the hills around are dotted with costly mansions,"
3685,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and unpretending cottages.
3686,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3687,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,It is a sight inspiring happiness to look on these dwellings in the
3688,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"spring. You have evidence that so many families, released from the city"
3689,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"are rejoicing in the pure invigorating air, in the sunshine and shadows,"
3690,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,in the rooms associated with so much ease and tranquility.
3691,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3692,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Can it be that any one can be found who is void of all sympathy with the
3693,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"natural world? All who seek these rural homes, at the established"
3694,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"season, are supposed--if we are the correct exponents of common"
3695,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"opinion,--to take wings from the city, for those cool and shady nests,"
3696,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,under the influence of love for the country?
3697,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3698,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Of course, when the spring arrives, all who have led a fashionable"
3699,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"career for the winter, have a sudden and marvellous restoration to their"
3700,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,senses. Like those whom some friendly magician has freed from the
3701,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"enchantments of an evil genius, they are restored to a healthy judgment."
3702,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,They then perceive the folly of the life which they have led. The
3703,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"absurdity of denominating as society, crowded assemblies, where"
3704,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"conversation bears the relation to interchange of thought, such as"
3705,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"becomes intelligent creatures, which wilted and fallen leaves sustain to"
3706,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,those of the beautiful and nutritious plant from which they have been
3707,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"torn,--where trifles and external polish are accepted in the place of"
3708,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the best qualities which can commend others to our esteem,--where"
3709,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"friendships are formed, not links of human creatures with affectionate"
3710,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"qualities to one another, but to fashion, whose representatives they"
3711,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"are,--friendships to be dissolved, as easily as the melting of the"
3712,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Pyramids of frozen cream, all these facts become, as soon as the air is"
3713,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"heated in spring, some of the most clear of all possible demonstrations."
3714,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Then they long for a more reasonable life. All that true poets or wise
3715,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"moralists have taught of the rural home, asserts its power over the"
3716,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,memory. All vulgar glare becomes utterly distasteful. Simplicity of
3717,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"life, amid a nature that summons man to cast off artificial follies,"
3718,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,has a powerful fascination. They have been poor city puppets too long.
3719,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Let them now be true men and women, where all things are so true and"

3725,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"tossing its stained waves crowned with bubbles that pain the eye, has"
3726,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"its side eddies, and throws off great branches for far away shades,"
3727,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"where the waters are at rest, and where innumerable small streams unite"

3729,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3730,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Minds and hearts will touch one another in the rural scene. The limited

3739,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the day will come, when many families of cultivated minds, will reside"
3740,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,all the year in our country-places. From such social circles influences
3741,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"must go forth, to transform no inconsiderable portion of what is called"

3754,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3755,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"These you could ascend by winding paths, and attain elevations, where"

3759,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3760,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Our time was limited. What we could see of the glorious scenes around
3761,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"us, must be accomplished late in the afternoon. The sun had gone down"
3762,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,while we were climbing up the side of the mountain. We had never been in
3763,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"such deep shadows. For the first time in our lives, we knew what was the"
3764,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,awful grandeur of solitude. Our existence seemed more sublime for the
3765,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,solemn awe.
3766,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3767,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As we hastened on to reach a vast rock, from whose summit we were"
3768,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"assured, the view was one of surpassing beauty, we met some children,"
3769,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"wild in appearance, barefooted, seeking cattle that found pasturage in"
3770,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"an open space, scarcely perceptible to the eye, that, at a distance,"
3771,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,could take in the whole aspect of the mountain. But one of these little

3783,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"How strange it is that the intense excitement of the soul, among such"
3784,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"scenes, is such a healthy peace--never the over-wrought exertion of the"
3785,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,mind! The intense activity within us does not _subside_ into
3786,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,tranquility. It is elevated to a peace. If you would have true enjoyment
3787,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"there, God,--the Infinite Father,--our immortality--the world our"
3788,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Redeemer has promised us, must be placed side by side with every"

3790,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3791,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Our forests are strangely primeval solitudes, when you reflect what"
3792,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,tribes of Indians have resided in them. That wild people have left there
3793,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"no traces of their existence. You often seem to be one of a few, who"
3794,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,alone have ever disturbed the Sabbath rest of very holy places.
3795,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3796,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Why did not the aboriginal inhabitants leave us in letters carved on the
3797,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rocks, traditions, which our learned and ingenious men could interpret?"
3798,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,We know not what we have lost in our deprivation of wonderful mysteries.
3799,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"We wander by great oaks, and stony places unconscious of powers that"
3800,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,linger there. The lore of demons and of spirits that plagued or
3801,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,comforted the Indians is lost to us.
3802,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3803,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Yet, let us not be unjust as though the civilization which has"
3804,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"superseded the rude Indian life, had given us no romantic substitutes"
3805,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,for these powers which agitated the barbarian. And especially let us be
3806,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"just to the genius of those who came over from the wilds of Germany, as"
3807,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,well as those who had their intellect brightened by the illumination of
3808,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Plymouth Rock. The imaginations of the two, were, indeed, very diverse"
3809,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"in their nature. They differed as the stiff gowns and ample pantaloons,"
3810,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"all so quaintly made, from the paint and skins which made the array of"
3811,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the savage.
3812,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3813,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,I am by no means insensible to the poetry which speaks to us in the
3814,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"horse-shoe, nailed to the door to keep away witches, whose fears were"
3815,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the more suggestive, because no one ever described the full power of the"
3816,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,mischief they were able to accomplish; and to the mysterious art
3817,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"medicinal, rivalling in wisdom many of the celebrated systems of the"
3818,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"schools, whereby the muttering of strange words could cure a fever and"
3819,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"ague,--and where a nail that had pierced the foot was safely wrapped up"
3820,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and laid up the chimney as a preventive of lock-jaw. The world is not so

3830,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3831,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,At the side of a large rock was a small cell. It was hollowed on its
3832,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,stony side almost as if it had been a work of art. A little ledge that
3833,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"stood across it, afforded a rude seat."
3834,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3835,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Tradition goes back to the wife of an Indian king, centuries ago, who"

3838,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3839,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,It is a comfort and a sorrow to know how human nature has been the same

3848,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"enough in itself, but was entirely too low for the royalty of the realm."
3849,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"These fellows, white traders, who would prowl about to waylay his"
3850,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Majesty, keeping respectfully out of sight of the Queen, were by no"
3851,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,means school-masters abroad for the benefit of the red man.
3852,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3853,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Even the queen, for some reason which it is difficult to conjecture, did"
3854,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,not object to the introduction of large quantities of fire-water into
3855,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the palace. She always took charge of it, however, and for that reason,"
3856,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"no doubt, felt that it would be used in a judicious manner."
3857,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3858,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,But at last the king was unwise enough to set up as a reformer; not
3859,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"under the instigation of the white men,--but indirectly, through their"
3860,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,influence. There is nothing new under the sun. We now abound in men and
3861,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"women, who are in advance of their age. A man of mere genius, in these"
3862,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"days, is a helpless creature; sure to be laid up like old lumber in a"
3863,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"house, in some out of the way place of deposit. But if he should only"
3864,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"have a moderate disorder of the brain,--have circumstances to occur,"
3865,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,which would produce the effect which according to Bishop Warburton was
3866,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the result of the earthquake in his day, ""widening the crack in old Will"
3867,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Winston's noddle,""--then particularly if he can be mad after a method,"
3868,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"he is sure to form a society, and to be well fed and famous."
3869,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3870,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"There was also in our kingly Indian reformer, one disagreeable"
3871,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"quality,--by no means unknown in an enlightened philosophical head of"
3872,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"associations. In all his projects, he was himself a central object. He"
3873,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,differed from some of our reformers in one respect. He was not crazy for
3874,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,notoriety.
3875,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3876,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Among other things which he learnt from these good-for-nothing white
3877,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"scamps, who were in such disfavor with the queen, fellows who had"
3878,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"traveled all around the world to little purpose,--sifting with wonderful"
3879,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"skill all useless and bad knowledge from the good, and casting away the"
3880,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"good as chaff, was a piece of information concerning the social"
3881,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,relations of some of his royal cousins in distant lands.
3882,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3883,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,They gave him a glowing picture of a great chief who had a great host of
3884,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"wives. Our king had informed one of his friends, that he thought that"
3885,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the introduction of this custom on our American strand, would be a most"
3886,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"desirable improvement. And one day, under the influence of fire-water,"
3887,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"which in opening his heart, proved how good a fellow he was, he"
3888,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,suggested the theory to the queen.
3889,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3890,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"It is said, that the wary queen, in her distress and perplexity at this"
3891,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"theory, sought for one of the wonder-workers of her tribe, and learnt"
3892,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,from him the secret powers of this cell. There she placed her royal
3893,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"spouse, who slept until he was sober enough to dream a wise dream. The"
3894,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"consequence was his reformation. After this, it is also said, that the"
3895,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"queen attained such domestic power, that a warrior who slept under their"
3896,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"roof one night, was heard to inquire of one of his tribe, whether in"
3897,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"case the people should go out on the war-path, the woman would be the"
3898,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,great warrior.
3899,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3900,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"It is also reported, that the spirit of the Indian queen often haunts"
3901,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the cell, and has some secret power to allure chosen way-farers there to"
3902,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rest, and have the dreams which belong to the place. The great"
3903,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"peculiarity of the mysterious power here exerted on the dreamer, was"
3904,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"this,--that he was compelled in his dreams, to follow a course contrary"
3905,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"to his habits and nature, and to learn some of the results of a new"
3906,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,course of conduct.
3907,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3908,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Over the cell were jutting rocks, which threw down as the sun was over"
3909,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"them, strange shadows, making the most mysterious letters. Curious wild"
3910,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"vines, with grotesque leaves, grew above it, having a fragrance like"
3911,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"that of poppies, but of greater intensity. Some fir trees near, blended"
3912,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"their murmurs with the hum of the wild-bees, and with a rill whose"
3913,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"waters passed over a rock, covered with green weeds, and fell into a"
3914,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"small dead pool, whose issues crept silently away amid innumerable"
3915,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"roots. Opposite, on a mountain, was a circle composed of various"
3916,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"objects, which, as you gazed seemed to move round with ever increasing"
3917,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rapidity, and to exercise a mesmeric power in causing tranquility, and a"
3918,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"state of repose in which you were prepared for a control, extraneous to"
3919,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"your own mind. The sides of the cell receded slightly inwards, in gentle"
3920,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"curves, in such a way that you were tempted to recline, and lean your"
3921,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,head for rest on the moss-covered hollows of the rock.
3922,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3923,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"One of the inhabitants of our valley, whose name was Eugene Cranmer, had"
3924,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"left the hill-side where he had a luxurious mansion, and had wandered"
3925,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"into the wild region, that contained this mysterious cell."
3926,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3927,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"He was well pleased to see the general air of comfort, as he strolled"
3928,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"along; for it disquieted him to look on men who were very poor, inasmuch"
3929,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,as he had a vague sense that he was called on for some exertion in their
3930,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"behalf. The poor seemed to him to mar the general aspect of the world,"
3931,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"as some unfortunate error in the taste of an artist, will mar the"
3932,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"general beauty of his picture. He wished all to be at peace, and have"
3933,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"enough to eat and put on; for the world, in such a state, seemed to be a"
3934,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,suitable place for a man who had attained great prosperity; and who had
3935,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the undefined impression that his life would be extended a few hundred
3936,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"years, before he would be under the unhappy alternative of passing to a"
3937,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,good place in a better country. He provided well in his house for
3938,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,himself; and of course he felt that such a care was all that was
3939,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,essential for the comfort of his family.
3940,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3941,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"His mother in his early life had indulged him to excess, and acted on"
3942,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the principle, that all who came near him, would regard it as the most"
3943,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"reasonable thing in the world, that it must be their study and highest"
3944,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,happiness to gratify his inclination.
3945,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3946,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Our hero,--for it is pleasant thus to designate him, and to recognize"
3947,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the superiority of such a man,--had climbed the ascent of the mountain,"
3948,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and reached the place of the mystic cell. A peculiar agitation of the
3949,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"vines above it, and sounds as of a bird complaining of an intruder near"
3950,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"its rest, drew his attention to the recess. He determined to seat"
3951,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"himself and rest awhile, before he returned to his home. No sooner had"
3952,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"this been attempted, than he wondered at the luxury of the sheltered"
3953,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"nook. He had an undefined feeling, that after all, the natural world,"
3954,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"providing on such an occasion such a place for his rest, was perhaps,"
3955,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"not so inattentive to human wants, as he had frequently imagined. The"
3956,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"walk he had enjoyed, the exhilarating air of the mountain, and the"
3957,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"composing influences around him, had thrown him into a state of more"
3958,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,than common good humor. He had fewer thoughts about himself; some dreamy
3959,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"recollections, and he went rapidly to sleep."
3960,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3961,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Then he dreamed dreams. First he saw a strange reptile crawl along the
3962,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"paths by which he had ascended to the cell. An odious object, deformed,"
3963,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,it looked as if it bore deadly venom in its fang. It was also obvious
3964,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,that the creature had faculties to be developed. At one moment it seemed
3965,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"ready to put forth its strength to attain the new gifts,--to call into"
3966,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,exercise powers that slumbered in its frame.
3967,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3968,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Its indolence, and anger at the stirring of inward strife by nature,"
3969,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,caused it to assume a torpid indifference.
3970,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3971,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Suddenly a stream of quivering light fell upon it. A bright dove
3972,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"descended, and the radiance increased as it drew nigh, with silver"
3973,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,wings; and part of the lustre of its plumage was as of wrought gold. It
3974,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"hovered over the creature, whom all its resplendent rays could not"
3975,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,render even less repulsive.
3976,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3977,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Then came a strange transformation. On a sudden all that repelled the
3978,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"eye was gone. The creature glorified, assumed a place amid the objects"
3979,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,of beauty that adorn the world.
3980,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3981,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"And what was a cause of surprise, he who saw all in the vision, and"
3982,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"witnessed the transformation, had now no other sentiment toward the"
3983,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"transformed and glorious, but love. No association existed in his mind,"
3984,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"to recall, with any disgust, what it once had been. His thoughts ever"
3985,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rested on the dove and its pure rays, on the indescribable beauty of the"
3986,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"creature as he now beheld it, new-created in excellence. The deepest"
3987,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"darkness of oblivion, spreading as far as the east is from the west,"
3988,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"interposed between what it had been, and was now, could not have blotted"
3989,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,out the disgust of the former unsightly appearance more thoroughly from
3990,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,his impressions. He could gladly have placed it in his bosom. Its
3991,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"beauty, he felt sure, would be perpetual memories, each ever being a new"
3992,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"joy like a star rushing on into its place of brightness in the evening,"
3993,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,gladdening all on which its beams can rest.
3994,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
3995,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Then there came to him a voice which said, Thou too must be changed from"
3996,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,evil to a glorious state. At first he bitterly opposed the suggestion.
3997,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Change! What then would life be to him? Thoughts would be his, and"
3998,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"views, and desires forever, whose very shadow touched him, to cause"
3999,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"pain, and to assure him of their contrariety to his nature. He who had"
4000,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"made slaves of all, to be the loving servant of all!"
4001,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4002,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Then the influence that abode in the mystic cell began to exert its
4003,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"power over him. It was as if a fever had passed away, and a sweet quiet,"
4004,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,as of an infant going to its rest had pervaded his frame. Resistance to
4005,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the good desires passed from him. He began to wish for a glorious
4006,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,transformation.
4007,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4008,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,And now the dream was changed. It was late at night. He drew near his
4009,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"home. The lumbering stage, full of drowsy passengers, had left him at"
4010,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,his gate.
4011,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4012,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He was not compelled to linger long upon his porch. The door was quickly
4013,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"opened by one, whose form glided swiftly along through the hall,"
4014,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"summoned by the sounds of the stage. It was his pale and weary wife, a"
4015,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"gentle, uncomplaining woman, bearing all his oppressions as void of"
4016,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"resistance, and as submissively as the stem, the overgrown bulb, the"
4017,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"work of insects deforming the bud or flower, whose weight bends as if it"
4018,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"would break it. He entered the dwelling and saluted her, as if her"
4019,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,watching was the least service she could render.
4020,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4021,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"And then, though he perceived that she was pale and faint, he imposed on"
4022,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"her tasks for his present comfort. The servants were at rest, and she"
4023,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"must arrange for his evening meal, and go from room to room to procure"
4024,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the least trifle he might desire.
4025,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4026,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,And again there came over him the spell of the Indian dream-seat.
4027,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4028,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Just as he was about to pour upon his serving wife the vials of his
4029,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"wrath, because she had misunderstood some one of his multitude of"
4030,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"directions, there suddenly was exerted over him a power which gave all"
4031,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"his thoughts a bias, and ruled his words and manner as the wind sways"
4032,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the frail reed.
4033,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4034,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He began to speak to her words of tender commiseration. He insisted that
4035,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,she was in need of his assiduous aid for her present comfort. For her
4036,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the wine and viands must be procured. She never again should keep these
4037,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"watches for his sake--watches after midnight. Nay, more; with a torrent"
4038,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"of glowing words, he promised that all his future conduct should undergo"
4039,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,a perfect transformation.
4040,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4041,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"In his struggle, our hero acquired an almost preturnatural quickening of"
4042,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the memory. All thought, however, ran in one single course--in the"
4043,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,demonstration of his selfishness. He uttered confessions of his deep and
4044,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,sincere repentance. He enumerated a long series of petty annoyances of
4045,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"which he had been guilty towards his wife, and which had made up the sum"
4046,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,of much misery. One confession of a wrong deed revived the remembrance
4047,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"of another. If the chain seemed at an end, as link after link was drawn"
4048,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"into light, there was no such termination."
4049,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4050,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He had no time to observe the effect of this his sorrow and confession.
4051,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4052,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"His internal wrath at this departure from his ordinary habits, from all"
4053,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the course which he, as a reasonable being could pursue, from all the"
4054,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rules he had ever prescribed for his family,--from all that could make"
4055,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the time to come consistent with the comfortable care he had taken of
4056,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"himself in the past, caused such an agitation, that he thought for a"
4057,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,moment he must die. His golden age in the past to be supplanted with
4058,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,this coming age of iron! Would he die? A great earthquake had crowded
4059,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,all its might into a mole-hill. It was as if a storm-cloud was just on
4060,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the eve of being rent asunder, to tear the hills below with its awful"
4061,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"bolts, and some angelic messenger was sent to give it the aspect of a"
4062,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"quiet summer-cloud, and cause it to send down a gentle rain on all the"
4063,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,plants.
4064,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4065,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He knew well from experience the sense of suffocation. His throat had
4066,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,seemed incapable of allowing a breath to pass to the lungs. But now he
4067,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"had, as it were, a sense of suffocation in every limb. His whole frame"
4068,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,had sensations as if pressed to its utmost tension by some expanding
4069,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"power, as by some great hydraulic press."
4070,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4071,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,What was to be the result? Was he to undergo some external
4072,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,transformation like the reptile which he had seen in the plain?
4073,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4074,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"To his horror, he began, in his rhapsody of the dream to recall a huge"
4075,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"frog, which he had watched as a boy--swelling--swelling--and about to"
4076,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"burst through its old skin, and come out in the sunshine in a new and"
4077,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"fashionable coat and a pair of elastic pantaloons, with water-proof"
4078,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,boots to match. Then his imagination recalled a snake which he had seen
4079,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"when he sat once by the brook with a fishing-rod in his hand, the hook"
4080,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"in the sluggish stream, and the fish, no one could tell where. Thus was"
4081,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,it passing through a similar process with the frog--preparing to present
4082,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"itself in the court of the queenly season, making his new toilette as if"
4083,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"he had been fattening off the spoils of office, and had ordered his new"
4084,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,garb from the tailor without regard to cost.
4085,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4086,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,In his heart there came again a tenderness for his wife and children.
4087,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,And with that deep emotion came peace--for suddenly a golden cup was at
4088,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"his lips, and cooling water, such as he had never tasted. An angel's"
4089,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,hand--oh how like the hand of his wife in its gentle touch--was laid
4090,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"upon his head, and all its throbbing misery was gone. The same Being"
4091,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"waved his wings, and a cool air, with waves murmuring in some music from"
4092,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"a far off, blessed space, and with fragrance that lulled the disturbed"
4093,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"senses to repose, passed over him,--and he felt that all his fever and"
4094,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,distress had departed from him.
4095,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4096,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Then he appeared to be surrounded by his wife and children, who were"
4097,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"wrapped in a deep sleep. He gazed on them, meditating offices of love in"
4098,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"time to come. One and another, in dreams, uttered his name with"
4099,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,unspeakable tenderness. His tears fell freely. The great night around
4100,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,him--that used to seem so unsympathizing--and to throw him off far from
4101,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"all its glory, as a poor worthless atom, now entered into accordance"
4102,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"with the new found life within. The gleaming stars said to him, we take"
4103,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,your purpose into one great mission of reflecting light. All spoke of
4104,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"hope. He was used to the feeling of loneliness and painful humiliation,"
4105,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,when in the darkness under the great unchanging canopy. Now was he
4106,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"lowly; but he felt that man was great, as one who bore the relation of a"
4107,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"spirit to the Maker of all things. He had never thought, that as great"
4108,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"peace dwelt among all the human family, as now pervaded his own heart."
4109,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4110,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Again the dream was changed. He was in the city. He was seated in the
4111,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,old dusty counting-room. He was the former selfish man. The men in the
4112,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"place, were to him a sea of a multitude of living waves. All that he had"
4113,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"to do was to count all created for him, and he for himself; and in that"
4114,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,sea he was to seek to gain the pearls which he coveted. As men passed
4115,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"by, he had no blessing in his heart for those tried in life, and to meet"
4116,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"death, or be tried still more. That God cared for them was no thought"
4117,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,that made an impress on his nature.
4118,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4119,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As he sat before his table covered with his papers, witnesses of his"
4120,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"gains, there was a sound of approaching feet. Then men entered and bore"
4121,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"along with them a mummy,--the dead form in its manifold wrappings, as"
4122,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the mourners had left it in the days when Abraham dwelt in the land of
4123,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,promise.
4124,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4125,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"They placed the form on which it was borne in the centre of the room,"
4126,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and then with grave deliberation proceeded to unroll its many
4127,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,integuments.
4128,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4129,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"In a short time they had spread out all the folds of the cloth, and"
4130,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,there lay the form which it was difficult to imagine had once been a
4131,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"living man--a being of thoughts, emotions, hope, with ties to life, such"
4132,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,as are ours at the present day.
4133,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4134,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Our hero looked upon the extended covering of the dead. One of those
4135,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"men, of a far distant clime and age, who had belonged to the silent"
4136,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"procession that thus presented the mortal remains to the eye, drew from"
4137,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the folds of his dress a stone of exquisite beauty.
4138,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4139,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"He held it before the cloth, and rays of an unearthly light fell upon"
4140,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"it, emitted from that precious gem. In a moment, that which had been so"
4141,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"dark, became a piece of exquisite tapestry. On it were a series of"
4142,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"representations, an endless variety of hieroglyphics."
4143,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4144,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As the rich merchant gazed on these, he read a history of a life, that"
4145,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,strangely condemned his own.
4146,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4147,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,And then the Egyptian Priest came forth from the midst of his
4148,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,associates.
4149,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4150,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He held in his hand an immense concave mirror in a frame of gold. Taking
4151,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"his position between the window and the dead form, he first gazed upon"
4152,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the sky. A cloud had obscured the sun.
4153,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4154,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As soon as it had been swept away, and the noon-day beams streamed"
4155,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"forth, he held up the mirror, and concentrating the rays of light, threw"
4156,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,all the blinding radiance on the dead form.
4157,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4158,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"In a little while it began, under the power of that wonderful glory, to"
4159,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,assume the appearance of a living man. Breath came. It moved. It rose.
4160,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"The one thus revived from the power of death gazed on the cloth, and"
4161,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,traced out for himself a plan of a beneficent life. He was to live to do
4162,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"good. Tears were to be dried, the hungry to be fed, the heart was to"
4163,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"have its perpetual glow of good will, to speak words of blessing, and of"
4164,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"peace, of hope to all."
4165,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4166,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As our rich man gazed on all this scene,--mysterious hands seemed to be"
4167,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"unwinding countless wrappings from the soul within, dead to the Creator,"
4168,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,dead to the love of man.
4169,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4170,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,A light was poured upon him. A new life was given him. He was preparing
4171,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"to unlock his treasures, to share his possessions with the poor. The"
4172,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,home of sorrow became a place of attraction. He was to seek all means of
4173,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,lessening the sin and misery of the human family.
4174,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4175,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Thus far had his discipline proceeded. The dreams had given activity to
4176,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the mind. They had bent the spirit of the man in glad submission to a
4177,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"yoke of obedience; and in this submission to all that was pure, he found"
4178,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"how the great service was perfect freedom. Holy truths, which had never"
4179,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"been great realities, but certainties that were among his deepest"
4180,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"convictions, many of them like seeds still capable of life, but floating"
4181,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"on the sea in masses of ice, perhaps to be dropped on some island"
4182,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"forming in the deep, and there to germinate, now began to be living"
4183,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"truth, and to struggle with the soul that it might live. He bowed before"
4184,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the august presence,--now that the great veil that had concealed the"
4185,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,kingly visitants was torn away. Now they were not like the magnetic
4186,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"power, affecting dubiously, and without a steady control, the needle of"
4187,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,the seaman as he drew near to the coast. They had become the
4188,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"all-pervading power in the needle itself, affecting each particle, and"
4189,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"turning all in attraction towards the one star, that is before every"
4190,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"bark freighted with the precious trusts, which he now felt to be so"
4191,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,grand a responsibility. Are not these sealed with a seal that no enemy
4192,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,can cause to be forged or broken?
4193,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4194,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"A slight change in his dream, and the temptations began to reappear,"
4195,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"crowding as the gay tares wind among the eddying wheat heads, and are"
4196,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,tossed by the wind and arrest the eye. There was a sense of slight fear
4197,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and doubt.
4198,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4199,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Then was he borne onward, and placed on the green sward beneath great"
4200,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,overhanging rocks. Their awful majesty was tempered by the endless
4201,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"vines, laden with fruits and flowers that crept along their sides, and"
4202,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"waved, as crowns upon their summits."
4203,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4204,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,A lake spread its waters before him. As he looked far off upon its
4205,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"unruffled surface, he saw clouds, now dark, now radiant, floating"
4206,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,rapidly in the sky. The wind that impelled them came in great gushes of
4207,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"its power, as their changing shapes, and rapid motion gave full"
4208,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"evidence. And when the winds thus swept on, they gave not the slightest"
4209,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,ripple to the great blue expanse of the waters. Yet they were no dead
4210,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"sea, but pure and living, from streams on innumerable fertile"
4211,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"hill-sides, whose threads of fountain-issues glittered in the sun."
4212,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4213,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"And the great shadows that fell from these floating masses in the air,"
4214,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,did not reach to the surface of the lake. They wasted themselves between
4215,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"the clouds and the atmosphere of tranquil light, that rested on the"
4216,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"placid, sky-like depths of the blue expanse."
4217,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4218,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Even at his very feet, these waters seemed in depth ocean-like. His eye"
4219,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"was never weary as he gazed into their abyss, and the sight never"
4220,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"appeared to have looked down into them, and to have found the limit of"
4221,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,its power to penetrate their immeasurable profundity.
4222,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4223,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Great peace again took possession of his mind! Then he felt the
4224,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"mysterious hand upon him, and he was lifted up from the borders of this"
4225,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"lake, for other scenes. He could not but feel regret. He was however"
4226,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"convinced, that any new prospect opened before him, would be one that he"
4227,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,might earnestly desire to look upon.
4228,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4229,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"The motion of the wings of the angel, as he transported him through the"
4230,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"air, was as silent as the calm of the great lake."
4231,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4232,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"They entered into a cave, so vast, that its roofs and sides were at such"
4233,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"distance from them, that no object could be distinguished in the evening"
4234,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"twilight. But soon he saw before him a high archway, lofty as the summit"
4235,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"of the highest mountain, by which they were to emerge into the light."
4236,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"They passed it, and found that it opened into a deep valley."
4237,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4238,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"A plain was here the prospect, and near to him the side of a precipitous"
4239,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,hill. It had great sepulchral inscriptions on the surface of the rocks.
4240,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,There was a slight earthquake. Its power caused the sides of the hill
4241,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"to tremble, and revealed the bones of men buried in the sands and"
4242,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,crevices.
4243,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4244,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"He proceeded--and soon he saw grave-stones on the plain. Drawing near,"
4245,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,he attempted to read the names inscribed upon them. Soon he discovered
4246,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"that they recorded those of his wife and children. Foes, as he imagined,"
4247,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"as his eyes rested on objects around, moving to and fro, lurked in the"
4248,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,shadows.
4249,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4250,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"And now his sorrow assumed a form, different from all the former remorse"
4251,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,of his dream. A vague idea that all was a dream came to his relief.
4252,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Tears fell, bitter regret for the past continued, but he had a joyous"
4253,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"and undefined conviction, that his family were not beyond the reach of"
4254,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,his awakened love.
4255,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4256,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,A gentle hand was then laid upon his eyelids. It pointed to the mountain
4257,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"near--on whose summit an eternal light rested. Such light, he thought,"
4258,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,must have been seen on the mount of the transfiguration.
4259,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4260,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He discovered that he had the power to look into the depths of the great
4261,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"mountain. As his eye penetrated those great hidden ways, he found that"
4262,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"all was revealed there, as if the earth and rocks were only air more"
4263,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,dense than that which he breathed.
4264,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4265,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,His attention was soon arrested by a rock in the centre of the mountain.
4266,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,It became the sole object to which he could direct the eye.
4267,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4268,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"There imbedded were evil forms, on which he looked to feel new sorrow,"
4269,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and to torture himself with self-upbraiding.
4270,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4271,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,These forms were his work. It was evident that they should have been
4272,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,created in exquisite beauty. The material of which they had been
4273,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"made,--so precious--was a witness that this could have been"
4274,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,accomplished. The marks of the chisel were a proof that there had been
4275,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,capacity--skill--which could readily have been exercised in creating
4276,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"that which was beautiful, and which had been perverted and abused in the"
4277,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,production of the shapes by which he was repelled. And it was also
4278,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"evident, that they had been fashioned in a light, which would have"
4279,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"enabled him to judge truly of every new progress of his toil, and under"
4280,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,a sky where true inspirations would be fostered. My work! my work! he
4281,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"said--but he added, there is hope for the future."
4282,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4283,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"As his new-found tenderness subdued him, the power that transported him"
4284,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"from scene to scene, bore him away."
4285,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4286,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Soon he found himself standing before another mountain, which was in the"
4287,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,process of formation.
4288,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4289,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"It was made of the clearest crystal, and the light was in all its height"
4290,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"and breadth. Angels were there, and waiting with a placid but"
4291,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,unutterable happiness for labors that were to occupy them.
4292,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4293,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"He could not rest. He must put forth into action the aims, the"
4294,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"aspirations to fashion forms of immortal glory. As he moved, in his"
4295,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"great ambition from his place, he saw that his dwelling was near at"
4296,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"hand--close beneath this great mound of crystal, and that its light was"
4297,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,reflected upon it.
4298,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4299,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He entered the house. His gentleness was the happiness of all. He was
4300,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,now the unselfish and loving husband and parent. He marvelled that so
4301,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,many little acts of love could be done day by day. He marvelled to see
4302,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"how little acts of love made up such a vast sum of happiness, and what"
4303,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"moulding influences, whose value could not be estimated, were united"
4304,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,with his deeds.
4305,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4306,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He found that forms were ever taken by the angels and borne away. They
4307,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"reverently bore them--reverencing the beauty, and above all reverencing"
4308,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,them as the work of One who had given him aid to think of their
4309,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"creation, and to embody them according to the pure conception. They"
4310,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,carried them first to a fountain of waters that flowed from a smitten
4311,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rock. A crown of thorns, and nails, and a spear, were sculptured there."
4312,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,Washed in this stream every particle was cleansed. Afterwards they held
4313,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"up the form in the most clear light, brighter than the light of any sun,"
4314,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and the beauty became far more perfect.
4315,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4316,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,The angelic laborers then carried each to the mountain of crystal.
4317,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"There it was imbedded,--but in a radiance which was to shine forever,"
4318,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,and forever.
4319,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4320,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"And then to his great joy, he found that vast numbers of men came to a"
4321,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,summit of an adjoining hill; caring not for the ascent by a narrow and
4322,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"arduous way. They looked into the mountain, and were entranced by the"
4323,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,forms that they beheld. He had no thought that they would turn to him in
4324,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"admiration. All that he exulted in, was, that he loved them, and that"
4325,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"they turned away to labor to make like forms, for the angelic"
4326,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"hands,--for the waters of the cleansing fountain,--for the inexpressible"
4327,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"light that purified,--for the place in the mountain, where they should"
4328,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,shine eternally.
4329,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4330,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"Just at this moment, a bird perched on the vines around the cell. It"
4331,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,poured forth a rich melody of song close to the ear of the sleeper. It
4332,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,awoke him gently from the profound sleep. The first sound which he heard
4333,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,was that of the sweet bell of his village church. Its gushes of sound
4334,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"rolled along the valley, and up the side of the great hills."
4335,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,
4336,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,He felt that the impressions of his dream were durable. So deeply was he
4337,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"affected, that he scarcely thought of the visions in which the truth had"
4338,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,been represented. He descended his path another man. Another man he
4339,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,entered his home. The house was a changed house that day. No one more
4340,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"subdued in spirit than himself, knelt in the church. No one with more"
4341,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"determined purpose, heard that day, of the One who ""pleased not"
4342,_THE INDIAN DREAM-CELL._,"himself."""

4431,_RIVERSDALE._,
4432,_RIVERSDALE._,It was my good fortune to dwell for some years on the banks of the
4433,_RIVERSDALE._,"Delaware, with a sturdy old yeoman, who was quite a character in his"
4434,_RIVERSDALE._,"day. Manly, honest, hospitable, of a dignified bearing as of one who"
4435,_RIVERSDALE._,"respected himself, and who had no false pride, it was a treasure to have"
4436,_RIVERSDALE._,known him.
4437,_RIVERSDALE._,
4438,_RIVERSDALE._,"His nature had been moulded, as far as earthly influences gave their"
4439,_RIVERSDALE._,"impress by a life spent chiefly on a farm, in days that are called"
4440,_RIVERSDALE._,"""primitive;"" that being one of the words which hold in unfixed solution,"
4441,_RIVERSDALE._,some true but very vague impressions. A few years which he spent in the
4442,_RIVERSDALE._,"naval service of his country, had no doubt added some lines to the mould"
4443,_RIVERSDALE._,that shaped him as he was.
4444,_RIVERSDALE._,
4445,_RIVERSDALE._,I have said that his characteristics were very prominent. Therein he
4446,_RIVERSDALE._,"differed from the mass of the country people. They are like a knoll,"
4447,_RIVERSDALE._,"where you see at once all the outlines. You must look attentively, to"
4448,_RIVERSDALE._,discover more than the eye has taken in at its first glance. He was like
4449,_RIVERSDALE._,"one of our rugged hills, having bold varieties of shape, records of time"

4451,_RIVERSDALE._,by other and varied influences.

4453,_RIVERSDALE._,He had thriven in the world far beyond all his expectations. His life
4454,_RIVERSDALE._,"had been one of untiring industry, decision, and ingenious energy. At"
4455,_RIVERSDALE._,"the time of his marriage, almost every penny was exhausted by the humble"
4456,_RIVERSDALE._,"fee. As days rolled on, the Creator added to his store, and he purchased"
4457,_RIVERSDALE._,the farm on which his father had resided. By a manly appeal to the sense
4458,_RIVERSDALE._,"of justice, he prevented a rich neighbor from competing with him at the"
4459,_RIVERSDALE._,sale of these broad acres.
4460,_RIVERSDALE._,
4461,_RIVERSDALE._,"In after days he also became the possessor of the farm, called"
4462,_RIVERSDALE._,Riversdale. There he spent his last years of life. He lived there in the
4463,_RIVERSDALE._,affluence of a rich farmer. It was strange to see him and his faithful
4464,_RIVERSDALE._,"wife so utterly unchanged by prosperity, and by the alterations in the"
4465,_RIVERSDALE._,habits of society.
4466,_RIVERSDALE._,
4467,_RIVERSDALE._,At Riversdale he had a spacious dwelling. There was here a degree of
4468,_RIVERSDALE._,elegance within and without. It had been the country residence of a rich
4469,_RIVERSDALE._,"merchant. His furniture was plain, but abundant, and all for use."
4470,_RIVERSDALE._,
4471,_RIVERSDALE._,"Among the curiosities of our house was the old clock, on whose face the"
4472,_RIVERSDALE._,"sun and moon differed from their prototypes in the heavens, inasmuch as"
4473,_RIVERSDALE._,they had a far more distinct representation of the ruddy human
4474,_RIVERSDALE._,"countenance, and as they did not rise or set,--for their mechanism had"
4475,_RIVERSDALE._,become distracted.
4476,_RIVERSDALE._,
4477,_RIVERSDALE._,"And then there was the famous old gun,--taken from a Hessian at the"
4478,_RIVERSDALE._,"battle of Princeton, and which had done great service in the deer hunts"
4479,_RIVERSDALE._,"in the Pocano Mountains, and amid the pines of New Jersey."
4480,_RIVERSDALE._,
4481,_RIVERSDALE._,Those deer-hunts were great circumstances in the course of the year. He
4482,_RIVERSDALE._,"used to narrate with great pleasure, the events that occurred at such"
4483,_RIVERSDALE._,excursions in the forests.
4484,_RIVERSDALE._,
4485,_RIVERSDALE._,"Once as he told me, he was alone in the woods with a guide. The darkness"
4486,_RIVERSDALE._,was coming apace. He had wounded a deer. The cry of the dogs indicated
4487,_RIVERSDALE._,that they were close upon it. It became evident that the man wished to
4488,_RIVERSDALE._,"lead the hunters out of the way; and to disappear in the darkness, that"
4489,_RIVERSDALE._,he might appropriate the prey to himself. But all his mean plans were
4490,_RIVERSDALE._,"soon baffled. ""If you,"" said the old yeoman, ""can run faster than the"
4491,_RIVERSDALE._,"buck-shot in my gun, slip away in the dark."" Never guide, I venture to"
4492,_RIVERSDALE._,"say, adhered more closely to his party."
4493,_RIVERSDALE._,
4494,_RIVERSDALE._,"His education, like that of so many of the old Pennsylvania farmers, had"
4495,_RIVERSDALE._,been very limited. His sympathies were not broad; though a small degree
4496,_RIVERSDALE._,of sentiment pervaded a vein of tenderness which wound its way through
4497,_RIVERSDALE._,"the rugged nature of his soul. Sometimes it appeared so attenuated, that"
4498,_RIVERSDALE._,few influences seemed to be willing to work for the precious ore.
4499,_RIVERSDALE._,
4500,_RIVERSDALE._,I remember that we were once walking along the avenue which led to the
4501,_RIVERSDALE._,"house, and I quoted to him a line of poetry which he did heartily"
4502,_RIVERSDALE._,appreciate. The scene around had little power to prepare his mind for
4503,_RIVERSDALE._,the impression. Two huge old cherry trees were near us. These were
4504,_RIVERSDALE._,"gradually withering away; as if to remind him, as he continually passed"
4505,_RIVERSDALE._,"them, that the days of his full strength were gone, and that infirmities"
4506,_RIVERSDALE._,of old age were creeping upon him.
4507,_RIVERSDALE._,
4508,_RIVERSDALE._,"Had I perused all our volumes of poetry, I could not have selected a"
4509,_RIVERSDALE._,"sentence, which he could relish more than the one which I repeated. It"
4510,_RIVERSDALE._,"was the well-known line of Cowper, that God made the country, but man"
4511,_RIVERSDALE._,made the town.
4512,_RIVERSDALE._,
4513,_RIVERSDALE._,It was really curious to observe how this arrested all his mind. It
4514,_RIVERSDALE._,seemed as if his soul was deeply impressed with a sense of the goodness
4515,_RIVERSDALE._,"of God, in giving man this beautiful green world, on which he does not"
4516,_RIVERSDALE._,labor in vain. He appeared also to have respect for the poet who could
4517,_RIVERSDALE._,"utter such a truth. Had all the tribe of bards risen from their graves,"
4518,_RIVERSDALE._,"been capable of participating in our earthly food, and come to us that"
4519,_RIVERSDALE._,"day, Cowper would have been treated to Benjamin's portion."
4520,_RIVERSDALE._,
4521,_RIVERSDALE._,"His histories proved to me how his nature was the same in early life,"
4522,_RIVERSDALE._,"and in age, as to fearlessness, and to a rough opposition to those by"
4523,_RIVERSDALE._,whom he was excited.
4524,_RIVERSDALE._,
4525,_RIVERSDALE._,"Once his step-mother, during the strife of the revolution, and while his"
4526,_RIVERSDALE._,"father was absent from home in the service of his country, sent him with"
4527,_RIVERSDALE._,a claim to a British officer. He was to demand payment for some produce
4528,_RIVERSDALE._,which the soldiers of the king had taken from the farm.
4529,_RIVERSDALE._,
4530,_RIVERSDALE._,"He found him seated at a table, at a place not far from Bustleton, and"
4531,_RIVERSDALE._,presenting himself made known the object of his visit.
4532,_RIVERSDALE._,
4533,_RIVERSDALE._,"""Where is your father?"" said the officer."
4534,_RIVERSDALE._,
4535,_RIVERSDALE._,The boy was shrewd enough to know that discretion was now the better
4536,_RIVERSDALE._,part of valor. But mingled emotions overcame his wisdom. The British
4537,_RIVERSDALE._,soldiers around him were the oppressors of his country.
4538,_RIVERSDALE._,
4539,_RIVERSDALE._,"Regardless of the wrath which he would assuredly awaken, and scattering,"
4540,_RIVERSDALE._,"manifestly, all hope of success in his mission to the wind, he saucily"
4541,_RIVERSDALE._,"replied, ""Why, he is at the camp with General Washington; where he ought"
4542,_RIVERSDALE._,"to be."" Perhaps he also regarded this as a defence of his father. A"
4543,_RIVERSDALE._,"grasp at a sword, an angry oath,--an assurance that he was a vile little"
4544,_RIVERSDALE._,"rebel, and must quickly vanish, were the evidences that he had given his"
4545,_RIVERSDALE._,receipt in full for all that had been taken as spoils from the farm.
4546,_RIVERSDALE._,
4547,_RIVERSDALE._,I have said that he was a man of the most sterling honesty. His extreme
4548,_RIVERSDALE._,"care to ascertain that all his accounts were correct, was actually a"
4549,_RIVERSDALE._,"trouble to the vestry of the church, while he was treasurer of the body."
4550,_RIVERSDALE._,He was above the least meanness in all his dealings with men. As he was
4551,_RIVERSDALE._,"rather too suspicious of others, sometimes imagining that they had some"
4552,_RIVERSDALE._,"evil design, where they had none, it was the more remarkable that he had"
4553,_RIVERSDALE._,"no cunning in his own heart, was open in all his aims, and free from"
4554,_RIVERSDALE._,those arts which entangle weak consciences.
4555,_RIVERSDALE._,
4556,_RIVERSDALE._,"He had manners which were a study. Few men are not, in some degree"
4557,_RIVERSDALE._,affected by their dress. He was the same man in self-respect and
4558,_RIVERSDALE._,"courtesy, whether you met him in his soiled working-clothes, or in his"
4559,_RIVERSDALE._,"best array. Summoned suddenly from the work in the field, or from the"
4560,_RIVERSDALE._,"barn, with chaff and dust upon him, his calm courtesy in receiving any"
4561,_RIVERSDALE._,"guest, whatever his station in life, the utter absence of all apology"
4562,_RIVERSDALE._,"for his appearance, his entire devotion to the attentions due to his"
4563,_RIVERSDALE._,"visitors, elicited your decided admiration. Not in his conduct, to his"
4564,_RIVERSDALE._,"guests, but in some slight expression, when we were alone, could any of"
4565,_RIVERSDALE._,"us detect that he felt any peculiar pleasure, when any of our most"
4566,_RIVERSDALE._,"aristocratic inhabitants had called to see him and his household,"
4567,_RIVERSDALE._,manifesting their respect. I have never seen him more devoted and kind
4568,_RIVERSDALE._,"to any visitor, than to a poor friend,--one who had lagged far behind"
4569,_RIVERSDALE._,"him, in the ascent of the hill of fortune."
4570,_RIVERSDALE._,
4571,_RIVERSDALE._,It could not be expected that his wild portion of the country would be
4572,_RIVERSDALE._,"exempted from those rude scenes of violence, where men take the laws"
4573,_RIVERSDALE._,"into their own hands. Nor can it be surprising, that with his physical"
4574,_RIVERSDALE._,"strength, boldness, and wild life at sea and on land, he should"
4575,_RIVERSDALE._,sometimes be prominent in these wars on a little scale.
4576,_RIVERSDALE._,
4577,_RIVERSDALE._,I remember how I heard one of his narratives with mingled interest and
4578,_RIVERSDALE._,"sorrow, when he told of a victory fought and won."
4579,_RIVERSDALE._,
4580,_RIVERSDALE._,"It was a contest with a party of butchers, who had come from a distance"
4581,_RIVERSDALE._,"and taken possession of the tavern, maltreating some of the country"
4582,_RIVERSDALE._,"people, who had, to say the least, a better right to the injurious"
4583,_RIVERSDALE._,comforts of the inn.
4584,_RIVERSDALE._,
4585,_RIVERSDALE._,"He was summoned from his sleep, and became the leader of the avenging"
4586,_RIVERSDALE._,"party. When they reached the scene of noisy revelry, he proved that he"
4587,_RIVERSDALE._,"did not rely on physical strength alone, but summoned a ""moral effect"""
4588,_RIVERSDALE._,to his aid. A pretended roll was to be called. Many names of persons not
4589,_RIVERSDALE._,"present, perhaps not in existence, were, by his order, pronounced; and"
4590,_RIVERSDALE._,"their ""Here,"" was heard clearly uttered in the night air. The effect of"
4591,_RIVERSDALE._,"this act of generalship soon became apparent. Silence, indicative of"
4592,_RIVERSDALE._,dismay reigned in the place of the former noisy laughter. The rough
4593,_RIVERSDALE._,"fellows were sorely thrashed, and taught that there was a high law which"
4594,_RIVERSDALE._,the quiet dwellers in the field could put in force.
4595,_RIVERSDALE._,
4596,_RIVERSDALE._,In after days my old friend would have deprecated the recurrence of such
4597,_RIVERSDALE._,"scenes. There is always a tendency to law and order, and to gentle"
4598,_RIVERSDALE._,virtues where a man has a great fondness for children--and this love for
4599,_RIVERSDALE._,little ones he possessed in a great degree.
4600,_RIVERSDALE._,
4601,_RIVERSDALE._,"It would have been a good scene for a painter, when they gathered round"
4602,_RIVERSDALE._,the white-haired man and elicited his attention and his smile. The large
4603,_RIVERSDALE._,"form sinking into its most quiet repose, as if there was no need that it"
4604,_RIVERSDALE._,"should be braced now as if prepared for any struggle of life, and the"
4605,_RIVERSDALE._,"rough features softened to gentle sympathy, would have been worthy of"
4606,_RIVERSDALE._,lasting perpetuation on the canvass. I have no doubt that the passage of
4607,_RIVERSDALE._,"Scripture recording the benediction of the children by our Lord, touched"
4608,_RIVERSDALE._,"his heart powerfully, and allured him the more to the One who bore our"
4609,_RIVERSDALE._,nature in the perfection of every excellence.
4610,_RIVERSDALE._,
4611,_RIVERSDALE._,"If an able painter, I would strive to represent our Redeemer, as I could"
4612,_RIVERSDALE._,fancy that He appeared in the scene to which I have referred. Who can
4613,_RIVERSDALE._,"attempt to satisfy even the least imaginative disciple, by any picture"
4614,_RIVERSDALE._,of the countenance of our Lord? How difficult even to unite the infinite
4615,_RIVERSDALE._,"tenderness with the determination of the perfect man, whom nothing"
4616,_RIVERSDALE._,"could move from his true purpose, because holiness was the necessity of"
4617,_RIVERSDALE._,"a heart without sin? One shrinks, in some degree, from a multitude of"
4618,_RIVERSDALE._,"representations of Him, as if they, failing to meet the inspiration of"
4619,_RIVERSDALE._,"the soul, were not reverent. Might we not more easily conceive of his"
4620,_RIVERSDALE._,"blended love and dignity, if he was painted among those who could not"
4621,_RIVERSDALE._,"trouble him, whom He would not have sent away, whom he took in his arms,"
4622,_RIVERSDALE._,"and on whom he caused to rest a blessing, that ever waits now to descend"
4623,_RIVERSDALE._,on the children of those who diligently seek him.
4624,_RIVERSDALE._,
4625,_RIVERSDALE._,"Some of the quaint narratives of the old man have proved, as I have"
4626,_RIVERSDALE._,"repeated them, a source of much amusement to the young."
4627,_RIVERSDALE._,
4628,_RIVERSDALE._,"For instance, he said that he was returning from a journey of some miles"
4629,_RIVERSDALE._,"into the interior of the country. He had taken his heavy wagon, and"
4630,_RIVERSDALE._,aided a neighbor who was removing his goods to a new home.
4631,_RIVERSDALE._,
4632,_RIVERSDALE._,The night had overtaken him as he returned. Just as he crossed a small
4633,_RIVERSDALE._,"stream, he heard a voice of one in great distress, calling for aid. ""Oh!"
4634,_RIVERSDALE._,"come here,--come here,""--were the piteous cries from an adjoining field."
4635,_RIVERSDALE._,
4636,_RIVERSDALE._,"Stopping his horses, and clambering a bank, he soon secured a"
4637,_RIVERSDALE._,"""reconnoissance"" of a field of strife."
4638,_RIVERSDALE._,
4639,_RIVERSDALE._,"By the dim light of the moon, he saw a scene sufficiently ludicrous,"
4640,_RIVERSDALE._,but demanding immediate activity. He had not come a moment too soon. A
4641,_RIVERSDALE._,"small man, a shoemaker, the one who cried for aid, and sadly in need of"
4642,_RIVERSDALE._,"it had, it seems, been crossing a field, when an ugly-tempered bull"
4643,_RIVERSDALE._,"rushed upon him, and would have gored him to death but for his presence"
4644,_RIVERSDALE._,of mind and dexterity. The poor fellow had skill enough to dodge the
4645,_RIVERSDALE._,"assault; and as the animal, missing his aim, rushed by him, he caught it"
4646,_RIVERSDALE._,by the tail. The vicious brute made every effort to reach his
4647,_RIVERSDALE._,"disagreeable parasite. In doing this he ran around in endless circles,"
4648,_RIVERSDALE._,"very wearying to the little legs of the little man, and exhausting his"
4649,_RIVERSDALE._,strength.
4650,_RIVERSDALE._,
4651,_RIVERSDALE._,"As my old friend had come and seen, what had he to do but conquer? He"
4652,_RIVERSDALE._,hastened to the side of the living whirligig. The shoemaker was wearing
4653,_RIVERSDALE._,out his shoe-soles more rapidly than any of his customers.
4654,_RIVERSDALE._,
4655,_RIVERSDALE._,"Seizing also the tail of the bull, he informed the exhausted man that he"
4656,_RIVERSDALE._,might now let go.
4657,_RIVERSDALE._,
4658,_RIVERSDALE._,"The animal continued the same tactics, but his foe-man was armed with"
4659,_RIVERSDALE._,"his heavy whip, and this was wielded by a powerful right hand. A few"
4660,_RIVERSDALE._,"blows, and the victory was won. The hero was left alone in his glory;"
4661,_RIVERSDALE._,for the rescued had vanished as soon as he could release his hold on the
4662,_RIVERSDALE._,"tail, and he did not return to see the result of the strife. Let us hope"
4663,_RIVERSDALE._,"that he was grateful, although I doubt the gratitude of one who could"
4664,_RIVERSDALE._,"thus run away, and leave all the battle to his deliverer. A benefactor"
4665,_RIVERSDALE._,"in things small and great, who has a noble mind, though wounded by"
4666,_RIVERSDALE._,"insensibility to his kindness, may receive benefit from the unthankful;"
4667,_RIVERSDALE._,"for he may learn more deeply the example of the Lord, and he may free"
4668,_RIVERSDALE._,"his heart the more to do good, and look for no return--learn to do good"
4669,_RIVERSDALE._,to the unthankful and the evil.
4670,_RIVERSDALE._,
4671,_RIVERSDALE._,I have represented the farmer at Riversdale as openness and honesty
4672,_RIVERSDALE._,"itself in all his dealings. Men will be men. In country life, as in the"
4673,_RIVERSDALE._,city you will find a sad abundance of mean and tricky persons.
4674,_RIVERSDALE._,
4675,_RIVERSDALE._,It is not a little curious to see our city friends come into the
4676,_RIVERSDALE._,"country, and take for granted that the sojourners there are all"
4677,_RIVERSDALE._,simple-minded and honest men. That is a weakness which is soon
4678,_RIVERSDALE._,dissipated. The wisdom is purchased with the loss of gold and silver.
4679,_RIVERSDALE._,"They find that they are charged by many, probably the obtrusive ones,"
4680,_RIVERSDALE._,the most extravagant prices for all things. The more free they are with
4681,_RIVERSDALE._,"their money, the more they are required to pay. The value fixed on the"
4682,_RIVERSDALE._,"substance offered for sale, is all that can possibly be extorted from"
4683,_RIVERSDALE._,"any one who is imprudent enough to buy, and make no inquiries. There"
4684,_RIVERSDALE._,comes a danger of reaction. They change the theory concerning men of the
4685,_RIVERSDALE._,"field, which they have learned from poets and novelists, and are tempted"
4686,_RIVERSDALE._,"to imagine that they all are like these thieves. I thank God, that I"
4687,_RIVERSDALE._,know well to the contrary.
4688,_RIVERSDALE._,
4689,_RIVERSDALE._,Some men of large means imagine that if they are very free in spending
4690,_RIVERSDALE._,"their money, and allow those whom they employ, to take advantage of"
4691,_RIVERSDALE._,"them, to extort unfair prices, that they will thereby cultivate good"
4692,_RIVERSDALE._,"feeling, a grateful regard. This is an entire mistake. The man who"
4693,_RIVERSDALE._,"cheats you never will be grateful. He comes to you, in all his relations"
4694,_RIVERSDALE._,"to you, with meanness of soul. That is no soil for good will. He also"
4695,_RIVERSDALE._,"fears, that at any time, you may be conscious of the fraud. He expects"
4696,_RIVERSDALE._,"therefore an hour when you will be angry, and despise him. He judges of"
4697,_RIVERSDALE._,"your coming enmity, by his own lasting bitterness and revengeful mind,"
4698,_RIVERSDALE._,toward any one who has overreached him. He has also some contempt for
4699,_RIVERSDALE._,"you, because you have been less cunning than himself."
4700,_RIVERSDALE._,
4701,_RIVERSDALE._,Pay fair generous prices. When a man gains from you more than the fair
4702,_RIVERSDALE._,"price, let it be a gift. Do not expect anything from the man, who does"
4703,_RIVERSDALE._,"in two days the labor that should be accomplished in one. Alas, as we"
4704,_RIVERSDALE._,"reflect on the want of truth and gratitude towards us, we have to"
4705,_RIVERSDALE._,"remember that we can apply these lessons to ourselves, as we labor in"
4706,_RIVERSDALE._,the vineyard where we have been sent to toil!
4707,_RIVERSDALE._,
4708,_RIVERSDALE._,I have spoken of the hospitality of the house at Riversdale. This never
4709,_RIVERSDALE._,"could have been exercised as it was, but for the admirable arrangements"
4710,_RIVERSDALE._,"of the good wife and excellent daughters. I look back, and marvel how"
4711,_RIVERSDALE._,"all could be done in that house and farm, and yet time be found for the"
4712,_RIVERSDALE._,entertainment of so many guests.
4713,_RIVERSDALE._,
4714,_RIVERSDALE._,"I am deeply grieved to look back to those bachelor days, and find that I"
4715,_RIVERSDALE._,"had a senseless conviction, that a house pretty much took care of"
4716,_RIVERSDALE._,itself. It was a delusion which must often have caused me to be
4717,_RIVERSDALE._,"troublesome, when I had not any idea that I was in the way. I now honor"
4718,_RIVERSDALE._,"the statemanship which adorns domestic affairs, and hope I no longer am"
4719,_RIVERSDALE._,"found at any time, a wheel out of place in the machinery of any house."
4720,_RIVERSDALE._,"Never too late to mend. A good proverb, friends. But as we apply its"
4721,_RIVERSDALE._,"hopefulness, let us take care to remember that when the present time"
4722,_RIVERSDALE._,"shall have become the past, and we have done wrong in things small and"
4723,_RIVERSDALE._,"great, it is too late to mend the sin and error. We cannot mend the evil"
4724,_RIVERSDALE._,of the past.
4725,_RIVERSDALE._,
4726,_RIVERSDALE._,I see the good old mother of the household now. Always neat in her
4727,_RIVERSDALE._,"dress,--erect in form,--kind,--thoughtful, self-possessed. You could not"
4728,_RIVERSDALE._,"know her long, and not perceive that she was a pre-eminent"
4729,_RIVERSDALE._,representative of the wife and parent. Her love for others had its true
4730,_RIVERSDALE._,"source, the love of God. Thence it flowed gently a stream of tenderness"
4731,_RIVERSDALE._,"for her family, and then spread freely far and wide to all others. Her"
4732,_RIVERSDALE._,"religion was of a very grand character. She knew, in all the trials of"
4733,_RIVERSDALE._,"life, what it was to have her Creator for her Rock,--to have His rod and"
4734,_RIVERSDALE._,"His staff. Real to her indeed, the divine love which brought our"
4735,_RIVERSDALE._,"Redeemer to our form from Heaven, and caused Him to expiate our sins on"
4736,_RIVERSDALE._,the cross.
4737,_RIVERSDALE._,
4738,_RIVERSDALE._,"Once we were speaking hopelessly, of some reprobate. The opinion was"
4739,_RIVERSDALE._,"advanced, or implied, that he was never to be reformed. I never forgot"
4740,_RIVERSDALE._,"the sorrow she manifested, and her heart-felt but gentle reproof, while"
4741,_RIVERSDALE._,she corrected us in the abiding spirit of the hope in Christ for any one
4742,_RIVERSDALE._,"who yet lives. While the lamp holds out to burn, she asked, could not he"
4743,_RIVERSDALE._,return?
4744,_RIVERSDALE._,
4745,_RIVERSDALE._,"She was one of the most unpretending Christians, and therefore her deep"
4746,_RIVERSDALE._,piety could not be concealed. When she was unconscious of the
4747,_RIVERSDALE._,"revelation, she taught us in a living subject of the Lord, the power"
4748,_RIVERSDALE._,"that can be given for holiness in this scene, where all gold can be well"
4749,_RIVERSDALE._,tried in the fire.
4750,_RIVERSDALE._,
4751,_RIVERSDALE._,She was ever busy. In hours of ease she had her knitting-needle. How
4752,_RIVERSDALE._,"pleasant it was to see her at her work, in the warm days of summer, as"
4753,_RIVERSDALE._,she sat in her high-backed chair on the piazza which overlooked the
4754,_RIVERSDALE._,"River. With the steamboats, then beginning their course, she was never"
4755,_RIVERSDALE._,"satisfied. ""The boats with sails,"" she said, ""glided away so natural"
4756,_RIVERSDALE._,"like: but with the steamboats it was all forced work."" No doubt she"
4757,_RIVERSDALE._,"often regarded these different vessels, as emblematic of those who moved"
4758,_RIVERSDALE._,"under gentle and approved agencies, and those who were out of harmony"
4759,_RIVERSDALE._,"with nature around us,--the working of the hands that are infinite in"
4760,_RIVERSDALE._,"power,--those who cared only for hire, and needed, in order to their"
4761,_RIVERSDALE._,"activity, some of those goads which happily abound for the idle."
4762,_RIVERSDALE._,
4763,_RIVERSDALE._,"The aged woman came to us what she was, to remind us what endless"
4764,_RIVERSDALE._,"influences are ever ready to mould us to increasing piety, and love for"
4765,_RIVERSDALE._,others. To the sick and sorrowing out of her household she had been an
4766,_RIVERSDALE._,angel of charity. Her life had been a golden cord. He had strung it for
4767,_RIVERSDALE._,her with jewels from the mine. Is that mine exhausted? The glories we
4768,_RIVERSDALE._,know lie near at hand for all that will gather them.
4769,_RIVERSDALE._,
4770,_RIVERSDALE._,"Well can I realize after the lapse of years, the sorrow of the aged wife"
4771,_RIVERSDALE._,when it was manifest that my old friend must soon close his eyes on the
4772,_RIVERSDALE._,"world for ever. There he lay, his strong form promising hope, which the"
4773,_RIVERSDALE._,"decision of the physician denied. Could he be dying, who was bound to"
4774,_RIVERSDALE._,the scene around him by so many ties? As he had gained these fields by
4775,_RIVERSDALE._,"such a life of labor, and held them so firmly in his grasp, as every"
4776,_RIVERSDALE._,"tree seemed so surely his, as you felt the impress of his firm and"
4777,_RIVERSDALE._,"undisputed will in all the arrangements of his broad farm, you might ask"
4778,_RIVERSDALE._,can all these bonds which bind him here be sundered? But God sunders
4779,_RIVERSDALE._,"all, as he will, in a moment."
4780,_RIVERSDALE._,
4781,_RIVERSDALE._,And now he was on the verge of the world to come. In infancy his life
4782,_RIVERSDALE._,had hung by the most attenuated thread. Was it better for him that he
4783,_RIVERSDALE._,"was to die an old man, one who had passed through life's trials, had"
4784,_RIVERSDALE._,"received such endless mercies, had so many calls to so many duties? Or"
4785,_RIVERSDALE._,"would it have been better for him that he had died in infancy, passing"
4786,_RIVERSDALE._,"to the ineffable joy, but to less glory and honor than those who have"
4787,_RIVERSDALE._,"borne the cross, endured in true manly toil, the burden and heat of the"
4788,_RIVERSDALE._,day in the vineyard of the Master?
4789,_RIVERSDALE._,
4790,_RIVERSDALE._,"It was in a quiet house, quiet as one so soon to be forsaken of its"
4791,_RIVERSDALE._,"owner, that we assembled to receive with him the precious emblems of the"
4792,_RIVERSDALE._,"great sacrifice made for us, in infinite love. If he received"
4793,_RIVERSDALE._,"consolation, it was indeed given also to the aged wife. Her quiet"
4794,_RIVERSDALE._,"sorrow, without a tear, was reverent, and full of submission. Its"
4795,_RIVERSDALE._,"evenness,--not rising or falling with every hope or fear,--was a seal of"
4796,_RIVERSDALE._,its great depth. You read in her fixed countenance that she had the past
4797,_RIVERSDALE._,"with all its memories, and the future with all its solitude clearly"
4798,_RIVERSDALE._,"before her. She was henceforth to be as the shattered vase, just waiting"
4799,_RIVERSDALE._,"some small trial of its strength, to fall to pieces. But the lamp within"
4800,_RIVERSDALE._,"was to burn on, and fed with ever increasing supplies of aliment for its"
4801,_RIVERSDALE._,"flame, to glow with increasing radiance. Such lights in the temple of"
4802,_RIVERSDALE._,God never go out.
4803,_RIVERSDALE._,
4804,_RIVERSDALE._,My aged friends! your ashes lie where you hoped that your mortal remains
4805,_RIVERSDALE._,"would find their resting-place. Years have passed, and yet I recall you"
4806,_RIVERSDALE._,"to remembrance more affectionately, than when I stood by your opened"
4807,_RIVERSDALE._,"grave. One cause of this, is, I presume, that the more I become"
4808,_RIVERSDALE._,"acquainted with men, the more I learn to value those who have risen in"
4809,_RIVERSDALE._,"their integrity, above the low level of ordinary character."
4810,_RIVERSDALE._,
4811,_RIVERSDALE._,Changed is your dwelling. A vast and costly pile occupies the place
4812,_RIVERSDALE._,"where once it stood. But could you, the former inhabitants, of that"
4813,_RIVERSDALE._,"which has undergone such alteration, reappear among us, we should"
4814,_RIVERSDALE._,"recognize what is eternal in its nature. What is of earth, alters and"
4815,_RIVERSDALE._,"passes away. But love, and truth, and faith, all the nobleness given by"
4816,_RIVERSDALE._,"the Redeemer,--these endure. These are extended and glorified in the"
4817,_RIVERSDALE._,world to come.

4897,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Indeed, one fellow, who had a manly, harmless wildness in him, whom all"

4915,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,and had a frame of fine proportions. His countenance easily kindled with
4916,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,intelligence. A large blue eye seemed to search your secret

5032,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Unfortunately there was nothing very romantic in the structure. The
5033,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"frowning shadows of larch, and other forest trees; the massive walls"
5034,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,were not there to call forth associations with some of the descriptions
5035,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,of castles which were the scenes of ghosts and of banditti--such as were
5036,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,common in the novels of the day.
5037,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5038,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The house looked desolate only because it was deserted, and had a dark"
5039,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,history. There were two rooms on the first floor; one was a kitchen of
5040,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"considerable size. The other the sitting-room,--stove-room,--or"
5041,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"parlor,--as it might happen to be called by the inmates. This was an"
5042,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,apartment opened a few times in the year for company on great State
5043,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"occasions. Yet it gave all the year round,--a fact which weak critics"

5046,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,accommodation and dignity to the mansion. From the kitchen a winding
5047,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,staircase ascended to the upper rooms. The small landing-place rested on
5048,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the back wall of the house. Small garrets were over these rooms. The
5049,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"cellar was of the size of the dwelling, and afforded no hiding-place,"
5050,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"nor any means of access to the interior from without, which we could not"
5051,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"easily secure. A small shed rested against the back of the house, from"
5052,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the inside of which there was no door by which you could enter either
5053,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"room. It was obvious, from the pathway to this shed from the kitchen"
5054,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"door, that the access of the family to it, was in the open air."
5055,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5056,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,The most desolate thing to me was the well. It was one of those still

5066,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5067,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,We could discover no manner by which any one disposed to disturb the
5068,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"inmates of the house, could secretly enter. It was amusing to notice how"
5069,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"some of the students, had no conception of pranks to be played upon us"
5070,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"in any other way than those known among collegians. However, we all"
5071,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,agreed that our regulations for self-defence must be very simple. We
5072,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"had to wait for the demonstrations of the enemy, before we could do"
5073,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,more than draw up our forces in a simple line for attack or defence.
5074,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5075,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The night, of course, came on. The whole class entered the house. We had"
5076,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"good fires in the two rooms below, and in one above. Mr. Hollman sent"
5077,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"chairs and tables, and a good stock of solid provisions. Lights had been"
5078,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"provided, and we had with us a number of lanterns--two of which were to"
5079,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,be kept burning all night. Some excellent cider had been sent to us; and
5080,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"if any had desired it, we would not have permitted the introduction of"
5081,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,stronger drink. Our honor was concerned; Dr. Smith having reposed such
5082,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,entire confidence in our proceedings. There was an implied contract
5083,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"between us, and there were men in the class who would see that it was"
5084,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"complied with, not only in letter, but in spirit. It was also obvious"
5085,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"that if we had any intoxicating beverage among us, and should report"
5086,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"strange sights, men would account for it in their own way. Indeed, if"
5087,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the young gents had engaged in a noisy revel, and their intellects had"
5088,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"become clouded, we should have tempted some mischievous creature to try"
5089,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,and create an alarm.
5090,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5091,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,We soon were a lively party. The house was cheerful with its blazing
5092,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"fires and lights. But as that noble-hearted K----k, who became in"
5093,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,aftertime so eloquent a preacher in the Presbyterian church--and
5094,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"M----r, for so many years a representative of his district in"

5096,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,seats by the fire in the kitchen--they soon drew around them the whole
5097,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"of our little army. We became so joyous and free from care, that we"
5098,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,regretted that there were not other haunted houses requiring our aid. We
5099,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"had no more thought that our talk would be exhausted before morning,"
5100,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,than the bird that its song will cease before the season for its melody
5101,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,is over. It was put to the vote by the leanest fellow in the class that
5102,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,we should not have our supper until we had passed the midnight hour.
5103,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5104,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"All remained quiet for a long time, when a dismal sound near one of the"
5105,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"windows arrested us, and caused a strange silence. It was the common"
5106,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"opinion, that it was the visit of an owl. Before midnight a scraping"
5107,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"noise was heard, and as we moved about, R----k insisted that he heard a"
5108,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"sound of moving boards, as if some one had climbed hastily over the"
5109,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,garden fence.
5110,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5111,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,All soon subsided into silence. Our animated conversations proceeded. I
5112,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"ought to say, that almost the whole evening had been spent in the"
5113,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,discussion of metaphysical questions. In those days these were unfailing
5114,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"topics. We did wonderfully well, considering that the German school had"
5115,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"not yet thrown open its gates, and let in its flood of waters, not"
5116,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"muddy, but stained with all sorts of dyes, so that the eye is dazzled"
5117,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,on the surface in place of penetrating the mass before you. The doctrine
5118,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"of the freedom of the will, as expounded by the great President Edwards,"
5119,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,was a sure mountain of gold for every adventurer. I always observed that
5120,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"all who pretended to argue at all, could argue fluently on this subject."
5121,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,I also noticed that no student ever hinted that he did not understand
5122,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"what his opponent had said, and that none of us ever complained that"
5123,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"those who replied to us, had misunderstood us,--a wonderful proof of the"
5124,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,clear manner in which we all reasoned. And indeed there was so much
5125,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"genius among us for this branch of disputation, that it did not appear"
5126,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,to matter whether a student had in any degree mastered the great
5127,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"treatise, of which a celebrated Scotchman, no profound judge to be sure,"
5128,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,has said that it never had been refuted.
5129,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5130,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"As we were thus arguing these great subjects, and saying things which"
5131,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Locke, Malebranche, Leibnitz, and Reid could never have said, K----k"
5132,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"amused us by a story,--for the actual truth of which he gave us his"
5133,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,word. He said that in a part of the country where he had spent many
5134,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"years, the people had a debating club. It was held in a school-house"
5135,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"during the winter evenings, and drew large audiences. On one occasion"
5136,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the topic of debate was the free agency of man.
5137,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5138,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,A stone-mason who had attended the meeting during the discussion gave an
5139,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,animated account of the scene. The teacher of the school was his
5140,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"particular hero. He acknowledged that the opponent had merit,--was, in"
5141,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"country parlance, ""a smart man."" But little Charlie the teacher was too"
5142,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"much for him,--he was still ""smarter."" It had been a long argument. The"
5143,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,little teacher held that man was not a free agent. The evening was
5144,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,passing away. The friends of each champion were much perplexed. Would it
5145,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"be a drawn battle? Just at the happy time, the little teacher thought of"
5146,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"a happy argument. ""Man,"" he said, ""could not be a free agent; for if he"
5147,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"was, he would never die."" ""That settled it,"" was the comment. Man would"
5148,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"never die, if he was a free agent. So we gave him the vote. He is an"
5149,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"""uncommon smart man."" We laughed,--and Thompson said that a story was"
5150,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"not an argument, and was preparing for a new onset, when the lean"
5151,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"student,--whom some called, improperly, Bean-pole,--interposed with the"
5152,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"assurance, that it was time for our repast. Some said not yet,--but he"
5153,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"who argued on the side of the lean one, had one vast advantage; that is"
5154,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"to say, his statements, particularly his reference to the tender ham,"
5155,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"and tempting bread and butter, created an appetite even in his"
5156,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"opponents. So the night was carried,--and we soon arranged our viands."
5157,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The metaphysical discussions ceased,--probably from the instinctive"
5158,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,conviction that such severe exercise of the mind was unfavorable to
5159,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"health, when one was making a hasty repast."
5160,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5161,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"While we were engaged in this agreeable duty, one of our number,"
5162,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Shockford, a fellow of the kindest disposition, but always saying things"
5163,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"in a grumbling way, declared that he had some scruples of conscience, as"
5164,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,to the nature of our present occupation. What business had we to
5165,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,interfere with ghosts? They had never done any harm to us. He used to
5166,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"groan over the dull, unimaginative brains of the people of his"
5167,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,neighborhood. One day a weight of lead was taken off from his mind. He
5168,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,sang his triumph in the best Latin and Greek which he could summon. He
5169,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,thought that his neighborhood was about to improve. Could it be
5170,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"credited, some of the people had seen a ghost. He knew a part of the"
5171,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,country where the inhabitants were too mean ever to have seen a spirit.
5172,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Lonely places, awful shadows by the woods, grave-yards, bridges in dark"
5173,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"hollows, were all thrown away upon them."
5174,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5175,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"And no man ever heard of a generous thought that originated there, or,"
5176,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"being sent there, found a hospitable reception. They are as dry in their"
5177,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,natures as the old posts in their fences. They never saw anything in the
5178,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"grand old woods, which are rapidly disappearing, those majestic trees"
5179,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"with their deep shades, that elevated their souls higher than the"
5180,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"furrows, which they turn over year by year. The trees are but so much"
5181,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"fire-wood, so much material for lumber,--so many posts and rails. All"
5182,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the beauty of the harvest, is submerged in the expectation of the silver"
5183,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,for which it could be sold. Is it any marvel that such clods are
5184,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"despised by the ghosts? If you were one, and had your own way, would you"
5185,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"appear in such a dreary society? Would you go before the stupid eye,"
5186,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"that never gleamed at the glorious unfolding of the stars, or rolled, in"
5187,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"some little transport, as the autumnal clouds drifted towards the"
5188,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"sunset, and were so radiant in the beams of the setting orb, that they"
5189,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"were too grand a canopy, for a world on whose surface men do so many"
5190,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,deeds contrary to the holy will of the Great Ruler of the universe?
5191,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5192,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Happy he was to say that he knew other parts of the country where the
5193,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,sojourners are a people of different characteristics. Many ghosts were
5194,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,seen in the favored spot. What was the consequence? The young ladies
5195,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"are, as it might naturally be expected, much more attractive in their"
5196,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"personal appearance, of gentler voices, of more sympathizing manners,"
5197,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,and form husbands on a much more elevated plan. Of course there is much
5198,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,variety in their descriptions of the ghosts which they have seen. One
5199,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"most commendable trait which I have observed among them, is that the"
5200,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,sights which they have witnessed enhance their social respectability.
5201,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,There are slight grades in rank among the ghost-seers. Those who have
5202,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"seen a spirit at midnight, are superior to those who have beheld one"
5203,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"early in the evening. Those who have seen one near the graves, rank"
5204,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,above those who have met one only in the fields. But the crowned head of
5205,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"all is my old neighbor, who begins apparently to tell you an awful"
5206,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"history,--his manner indicating that he can give strange circumstantial"
5207,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"evidence of the truth of the event which he is about to narrate,--and"
5208,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"all at once the blood, which began to cool, flows freely, as he cuts"
5209,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"short his tantalizing narrative, with the information that he shall"
5210,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,never inform any soul what he saw that night. No one of our neighbors
5211,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,dares to think that he has ever approached such a transcendent vision.
5212,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,The shake of the head with which the old man concludes his last
5213,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"sentence, is too impressive for the most presumptuous man, having a"
5214,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,tendency to a doubt.
5215,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5216,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"After our meal, and many a hearty laugh, a number composed themselves in"
5217,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the different rooms for a good sleep. It was determined that three of
5218,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the class should sit up awake before the fire in case of emergency. I
5219,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,must say that there was an undefined doubt over our minds whether
5220,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,something very exciting would not happen before morning. I felt this
5221,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,even in the gayety of the room. The young men laughed and talked as if
5222,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,their minds were wrought up to an unnatural state.
5223,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5224,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The hours sped on,--rapidly for those who slumbered, and heavily for"
5225,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,those who did duty as waking guards before the fire. Now and then some
5226,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"one would awaken, as if from a dream, and ask in bold speech whether the"
5227,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,ghost had yet come.
5228,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5229,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"I remember that it was my turn to be off guard, and to join the"
5230,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"sleepers. The fires were kept up brightly, and gave a cheerful light to"
5231,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"all the apartment. I was watching the flickering of the flames, and had"
5232,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"forgotten almost entirely the place and position which we occupied, and"
5233,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"was philosophizing on the nature of sleep, and recalling some"
5234,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,observations I had read on the happy state of healthy little children
5235,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,who are sinking to their sleep. I recalled the evidence I had received
5236,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"of that kind arrangement of Providence, in the case of the little ones"
5237,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"at home, smiling on you in such perfect benignity and peace, as you drew"
5238,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"near them in their little beds. This, of course, recalled the home. As I"
5239,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"was bringing loved faces and scenes before me, the whole house was throw"
5240,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"into a sudden commotion,--just like that which you may imagine to occur"
5241,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"when a whole ship's crew, having been devoid of fear, is suddenly"
5242,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"startled with the report, communicated as by some mysterious power from"
5243,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"man to man, that an iceberg is near at hand, or breakers, or that the"
5244,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,good vessel has been subjected to some shock which endangers the common
5245,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,safety.
5246,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5247,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"A loud sound was heard, evidently in the centre of the house, and all"
5248,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,agreed that it was occasioned by the discharge of a large pistol. The
5249,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"dwelling was shaken by the report, and the windows rattled. In a moment"
5250,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,all was activity. By a common impulse all above and below gathered at
5251,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the staircase. We distinctly smelt the fumes of the powder, and holding"
5252,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"up lights, were satisfied that we detected the lingering smoke."
5253,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5254,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Then commenced a new and perfect scrutiny of the building.
5255,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Notwithstanding the evidence that earthly elements had entered into the
5256,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"cause of the shock, some were rather awed."
5257,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5258,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,All our search was in vain. There are more things in heaven and earth
5259,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"than are dreamt of in our philosophy. Yet, in this instance, we looked"
5260,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,on the earth for that which we could not find.
5261,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5262,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Not the slightest trace could be discovered to throw us on the true path
5263,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,of investigation. We could form no possible conjecture as to the manner
5264,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,in which the pistol had been discharged. After daylight we re-examined
5265,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the house. But all was in vain. The external and internal scrutiny gave
5266,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,us not a hint as to the manner in which the deed could have been
5267,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,accomplished.
5268,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5269,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,I must confess that we returned to Princeton in no enviable mood. We all
5270,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"dreaded an interview with Dr. Smith. We sought him at once,--as nature"
5271,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"inclines us often to go through a painful duty as soon as we can, and"
5272,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,to have it over.
5273,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5274,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,But the President listened to our story in a manner which relieved us of
5275,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,our apprehensions. He did not seem greatly surprised; and his remarks
5276,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"satisfied us that we had not been made ridiculous, and we were prepared"
5277,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"to face the world, or rather the worst part of it,--with reference to"
5278,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"our present condition,--the college."
5279,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5280,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"""Gentlemen,"" said he, ""some effort to continue this imposition was to"
5281,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,have been expected. I presumed that such a series of inmates would not
5282,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"have been driven from the house, had not some skill been shown in the"
5283,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"manner of causing alarm. Now, the affair is more serious than ever. If"
5284,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"you allow this to rest here, the fate of the house is sealed. Ghosts"
5285,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,will be seen all around the land. Perhaps we shall even have one to
5286,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,disturb the college. Malicious and designing men will be able to torture
5287,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"their victims, and often render the property of those whom they hate,"
5288,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,perfectly worthless. You must continue to sleep in this building until
5289,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"you unravel this mystery. For my own part, I would say to you, do not be"
5290,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,discouraged. You have made an advance. It is now evident that the noises
5291,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"heard in the house, perhaps sudden flashes that have been seen, are not"
5292,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the work of imagination. A pistol fired there, gives you a clear"
5293,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,indication that some man is to be detected. Go there again. Let a
5294,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"portion of the class go to the house, and take possession. Have your"
5295,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,fires and lights. At a later hour let another body of these gentlemen go
5296,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"quietly in the dark, and secrete themselves outside of the dwelling, so"
5297,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,that they can watch it during the night. Place yourselves so as not to
5298,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,intercept the most natural approaches to the house. Do not let any one
5299,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"know of your plans. I shall wait to hear from you again, and am sure"
5300,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"that you will succeed."""
5301,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5302,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Before the evening had arrived we had proof that Dr. Smith was correct
5303,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,in his judgment as to the necessity for the prosecution of this
5304,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,adventure. Night promised to become hideous to the surrounding country.
5305,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"It was already reported on the most indisputable evidence; nay, some of"
5306,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,the narrators had heard it directly from the lips of the students
5307,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"themselves, that as we were assembled in the dwelling, the lights"
5308,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"suddenly became dim, the fires ceased to blaze, and then an awful"
5309,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"stately lady, with the famous red ring around her throat, indicating"
5310,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"clearly that a murder had been committed on the premises, walked through"
5311,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the rooms and looked on us, and seemed to enjoin on us the duty of"
5312,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"bringing the men who had stained their hands with her blood to justice,"
5313,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,and then suddenly withdrew with a terrific noise. Another report was to
5314,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the injury of an unpopular man, who had owned the property before it"
5315,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"was purchased by Mr. Hollman. Its version of the affair was, that the"
5316,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,ghost disclosed a secret place in the house where some papers were
5317,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"concealed,--proving that the property had in former times been acquired"
5318,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,by the most wicked means. Great satisfaction was intimated that the man
5319,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"would be exposed, and attain his deserts,--a prison having long been"
5320,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,supposed to be his appropriate destination.
5321,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5322,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,In the evening we followed the injunctions of the president. The late
5323,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"party left the college one by one, issuing in the dark from the basement"
5324,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"of the building, so that no one watching us could know of their"
5325,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"departure. They crept along over fields, and by the skirt of the woods."
5326,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"They hid themselves under a thicket, through which no one would attempt"
5327,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,to pass to the house.
5328,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5329,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,The midnight came on. I was one of those in the interior of the
5330,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,building. About the same time of the night we heard the strange pistol
5331,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"again. I also thought I heard an additional sound, but could not imagine"
5332,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,its cause. Our chief trust was in those without. And we were not
5333,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"disappointed. A moment after the discharge of the pistol, we heard a"
5334,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"rush of feet, and many cries. Then there arose a noise of unmistakable"
5335,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,triumph.
5336,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5337,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The noise, and a flash revealed to the watchers without, the direction"
5338,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"they must pursue. They surrounded the shed, back of the building. There"
5339,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"they seized a form, a base--unspiritual--rough form. It was that of a"
5340,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"young negro man, who was brought into the light in the house, and"
5341,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,subjected to investigation.
5342,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5343,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"He confessed that his design was to obtain vengeance of Mr. Hollman, who"
5344,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,had given him some offence. It seems that above the shed on the back of
5345,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"the house, where he was secured, there was a small trap-door, opening"
5346,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"into the interior. It was so cut out of the boards, and so often"
5347,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"white-washed within and without, that we had never observed it. He had"
5348,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"once lived in the house, and knowing of this small opening, had availed"
5349,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"himself of it, for the success of his wicked design. Climbing up the"
5350,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"shed, he lifted the door, held the large horse-pistol deeply loaded, as"
5351,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"far as he could over the landing of the winding staircase, and then"
5352,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"discharging it, dropped the door, slid from the shed, and was soon far"
5353,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"off, and free from all suspicion."
5354,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5355,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"He had heard from the people at Mr. Hollman's, that we were to attempt"
5356,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"to satisfy the public mind, that the house was not haunted, and that any"
5357,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,family might reside on the premises in peace. Hence he resolved to alarm
5358,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"us all, and drive us away."
5359,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5360,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Some of the class were for summary vengeance on the fellow. We
5361,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"determined to take him into Princeton, and hand him over to the"
5362,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,magistrate. You may imagine that we entered our town on the following
5363,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"morning, with an air of triumph,--which was quite a contrast to our"
5364,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"looks on the preceding day. We went in figuratively speaking, with"
5365,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"banners flying, and drums beating. And we had some literally blowing"
5366,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,their trumpets.
5367,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5368,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"The ghost attracted some curiosity, and some said that as we looked for"
5369,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"something in white, we were disappointed."
5370,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,
5371,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Dr. Smith was as well pleased as we were, with our success. The house"
5372,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"was soon reoccupied. I went there some time after our adventure, and"
5373,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"found it the home of a respectable family, who treated me with special"
5374,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"consideration, and a satisfactory portion of a large pie, when they"
5375,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,heard that I was one of the celebrated party that caught the ghost.
5376,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,Ghosts in troops forsook Princeton. They found their occupation gone.
5377,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"Men and women, boys and girls, darkies of all ages, saw shadows in the"
5378,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"evening, mists, indistinct lights, flickering candles, passed by graves,"
5379,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"and grave-yards, and had no longer any special dread. And had any ghost"
5380,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"in fact, dared to appear anywhere around, I have no doubt that our class"
5381,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"would have been summoned to do, what daylight always does, send the"
5382,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"wandering and terrible spirit to the regions where such dwell,--far from"
5383,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,all human cognizance. May Nassau Hall ever have such success in all her
5384,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"laudable enterprises! May all her classes, be as great victors over all"
5385,_DR. SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE._,"that can cause dread to a student, as we were over the ghost at"

5396,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"""Father,"" said one of Mr. Digby's children, just let loose from school,"
5397,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],and fluttering about as if on the eve of a great flight of
5398,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"play,--""father, look at my copy-book."""
5399,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5400,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"The face of the one thus appealed to, which generally bore a care-worn"
5401,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"look, relaxed into an attentive and gentle interest. He gave the labored"
5402,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],page the appropriate scrutiny. When the right of criticism was thus
5403,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"justly earned, he bestowed due meed of praise. In line after line he"
5404,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"read, ECONOMY IS WEALTH."
5405,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5406,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"The children soon left him, and he turned down a path leading to the"
5407,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"gate. All the way he repeated in various intonations of voice, the tones"
5408,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"changing with various trains of thought, economy is wealth."
5409,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5410,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"He said to himself, ""Who was the great inventor of that most absurd of"
5411,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],proverbs? Economy is wealth. Nonsense! The man who first spoke that
5412,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"sentence, never had a saving wife. Economy wealth! Pooh! Pooh! I say,"
5413,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],economy is poverty.
5414,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5415,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"""Our house is full of economy. The more it becomes a bank full of that"
5416,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"article, so ridiculously misrepresented, the more poor I am. We have a"
5417,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"great linen-closet, never opened for use, full of economy. We have a"
5418,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],garret where economy is packed away. There are things ancient and
5419,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"modern, big and little, shining and rusty, known and unknown, bought as"
5420,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"bargains, and patiently waiting under loads of dust to become useful,"
5421,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],and to save us several fortunes. There is a huge chest of economy in the
5422,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"entry near the spare room door. It contains plated ware, spoons, urns,"
5423,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"tea-pots, toast-racks, branches for candle-sticks, all ready for use"
5424,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"some fifty years hence, when we shall give parties to the fashionable"
5425,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"people in our village, increased from eight or ten to one hundred."

5428,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"cost of hiring a man to cut my wood, and dig the garden, and who was to"
5429,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],wear my old clothes. Now he is so corpulent that he cannot get into my
5430,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"coats or pantaloons. If there be a tide which takes out everything, and"

5432,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5433,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Now Mrs. Digby was a great domestic statesman. Her husband had been
5434,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],leading a life of married astonishment. There seemed to be no end to the
5435,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],resources of her diplomacy. Her reasons for any departure from her
5436,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"ordinary expenditures, were versatile and profound."
5437,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5438,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"One principle behind which the good lady invariably entrenched herself,"
5439,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"was the impregnable one, that she never bought anything unless it was"
5440,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"under the promptings of a strict necessity. ""I never buy anything not"
5441,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"strictly necessary, Mr. Digby,"" was the oil she poured on the troubled"
5442,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],waters of the mind of her husband.
5443,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5444,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Now the man whose intellect was not able to comprehend the curious
5445,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"principles that regulated his household, declared that he never saw"
5446,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],anything so comprehensive as this theory of necessity. It appeared to
5447,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],him to be the only law on the earth or among the stars which had no
5448,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"exceptions. And all these necessities, were a great perplexity under"
5449,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],another aspect. They were all matters of life and death. If the coat of
5450,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"the little girl faded in a slight degree, a new one--if Mrs. Digby said"
5451,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"so--was so necessary, that it was evident that an earthquake would come,"
5452,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"or the sun turn aside from his path, with consequences of unending"
5453,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"disaster, unless her will was transformed into actual ribbons, and"
5454,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"merino, or silk, or velvet. And what was equally surprising, it"
5455,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"sometimes happened, that before one necessity could thus be removed,"
5456,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],another arose; and the first was forgotten. The earthquake was somehow
5457,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],prevented. The sun did not alter his course. It was a strange mystery.
5458,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],

5461,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"It happened after they had been married a short time, that Mrs. Digby"
5462,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],expected a visit from some friends.
5463,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5464,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"""My dear,"" she said, ""you will be so pleased with them. I would not"
5465,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"think of treating them with any great ceremony, if it was not that they"
5466,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],have never seen our house. First impressions are very strong. I never
5467,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"forget the pitcher, towels, and basin in the room where I slept, when I"
5468,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],made a visit to the Elders. Nothing could ever eradicate from my mind
5469,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"the belief, that she is not as good a house-keeper as she should be. No,"
5470,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"it would not change my mind on that point, if I was to see her in a"
5471,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"house, where everything was cut out of newly fallen snow."
5472,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5473,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"""Now, my dear, as these friends are to form their first impressions of"
5474,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"my house, I am under the necessity of having everything very nice for"
5475,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],them. I shall go to the expense of buying a few articles. And then our
5476,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],meals must be a little more particular than when we are alone. But we
5477,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"will make all up by increased economy. Yes, we will save all the"
5478,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],increased expense in various ways. First impressions are so powerful.
5479,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"The first impressions of these friends must be favorable."""
5480,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5481,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],This all seemed to be very natural to Mr. Digby. But his surprise was
5482,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],great when he discovered that this theory of first impressions on the
5483,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"part of visitors, went on for years. The great portion of those who came"
5484,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"to see them, were persons who were to receive first impressions. The"
5485,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Nobbs, the Stowells, the Campbells, the Lambs, and a host of others"
5486,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"came, and all were to receive their first impressions. After ten years"
5487,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],the theory was still in existence. As soon as Mr. Digby heard of a new
5488,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"comer, then the theory was the first thing in his mind."
5489,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5490,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"And when any of the friends repeated a visit, Mrs. Digby had a pleasant"
5491,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],piece of information to impart to her lord and master. She had heard
5492,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"that Mrs. Snobbs, for instance, had said, that their house was kept in a"
5493,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],state of perfection. She had been in ecstacies over the appearance of
5494,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"the furniture, and thought the table such as would tempt one to eat who"
5495,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"had lost all appetite. Of course, it would never do to allow her to"
5496,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"come, and have the first impressions changed. That would be coming down"
5497,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],to a most painful extent. It could never be. Some old furniture must
5498,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],therefore be displaced by some new purchases. And then their table must
5499,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"be a little more richly served. Indeed, it would be rather advantageous"
5500,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],to have things a little better than in former times. Former impressions
5501,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],would lead her to expect some advance.
5502,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5503,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],*       *       *       *       *
5504,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5505,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],----this time Mr. Digby was again much perplexed. His wife received a
5506,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],present of three hundred dollars from an aunt. The good lady was quite
5507,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"triumphant, and now appeared to think, that anything but economy was not"
5508,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],practicable. The old theory of necessity now came in like a torrent. The
5509,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],good husband had read of crops which sprang up in some portions of the
5510,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"earth, in a wonderful manner. He had heard of the plants in some of our"
5511,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"warm climes which grew under a few suns in certain seasons, in a way"
5512,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],which seems incredible to us who live in this northern land. But never
5513,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],did he imagine that anything could ever equal the sudden growth of
5514,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"necessities in his house, since the good aunt had sent the present."
5515,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Necessity met you everywhere. It haunted you in every room. You trod
5516,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"upon it when you stepped upon the old carpet, or the old oil-cloth. You"
5517,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],could not come near the window but it met you.
5518,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5519,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],We must have new curtains for our parlor-windows.
5520,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5521,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"But, Mr. Digby suggested, daring to run a tilt, madman as he was,"
5522,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"against necessity, that irresistible giant, who has a perfect covering"
5523,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"of impenetrable mail,--the expense. Think of my present, said the lady,"
5524,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],offering terms as a conquering general would offer them to a prostrate
5525,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],foe. I will give of my present a great part of the expense.
5526,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5527,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"So the curtains were bought. They were put up, and Mrs. Digby was as"
5528,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],happy as Mr. Digby was dejected and miserable.
5529,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5530,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Then the good lady discovered that the porch must be taken down, and a"
5531,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],piazza erected. Her lord said it was impossible. Here again was he
5532,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],foolish enough to place his impossibility as an opponent to her
5533,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],necessity. She would pay for a portion of the cost out of the money
5534,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],which was sent her by her aunt. But Mr. Digby said that he had several
5535,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"debts to pay, and knew not how to meet them."
5536,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5537,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Poor man! He here made a most disastrous movement of his forces. The
5538,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"able general opposed to him, was too much gifted with military genius to"
5539,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],lose sight of the proffered advantage.
5540,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5541,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Did he expect that she was to pay his debts out of the present made her
5542,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],by her aunt? No such thing. Her dear aunt manifestly intended that the
5543,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],money should be spent for her special comfort. She could read him the
5544,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"letter. She intended, as that kind epistle taught, that her niece should"
5545,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],expend it in some way that would personally gratify herself. She never
5546,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],intended that it should be swallowed up in the ordinary expenditures of
5547,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],the house.
5548,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5549,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"So she ingeniously carried her day, for discomfiting Mr. Digby, on the"
5550,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"ground that he had proposed to her that she should pay his debts, which,"
5551,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"however, it will be observed he had not done,--for he had only"
5552,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],remonstrated against new expenditures before his old debts were
5553,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"expunged,--she wisely made the two questions one. As he had to retire"
5554,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"from the field on the question of battle, as insisted on by her, despite"
5555,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"of all his pleas to the contrary,--she took for granted that the subject"
5556,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],of the new piazza was involved in the one issue. So the piazza was
5557,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],erected.
5558,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5559,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Some time after this, one of her friends wished to dispose of a new"
5560,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"carriage, or one almost as good as new. Mrs. Digby described it in"
5561,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],glowing terms. And then she said that she could have it at a great
5562,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"reduction in the price. If the fish knew that the hook was near, as well"
5563,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],as Mr. Digby knew that the cord and hook were dangling around to secure
5564,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"him for a prey,--no fish would ever be caught."
5565,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5566,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],It was astonishing what an eloquence Mrs. Digby could throw into such a
5567,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],statement. It was not merely that she was eloquent when she described
5568,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],the carriage. The picture she drew of the comfort in which she and her
5569,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"lord would appear,--nay their increased elegance and respectability, was"
5570,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],one which could not have been surpassed. Then there was a happy contrast
5571,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"presented between the proposed new equipage, and their present homely"
5572,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"wagon, in which they had of late years jogged along in a contented way,"
5573,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],which proved that their ideas of what was desirable were in need of
5574,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],improvement.
5575,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5576,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"The master-power of her eloquence did not, however, here appear in its"
5577,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"highest manifestations. No, it was revealed when the simple description"
5578,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"of the carriage, conveyed to the mind of the hearer, the idea that if he"
5579,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"did not most earnestly desire to purchase it, he must be a man fit for"
5580,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"treason, stratagems, and spoils. The reproof was carried to the heart"
5581,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"through terrors, which in themselves seemed incapable of any such power."
5582,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Those who are ignorant of such feminine power, would as soon expect the"
5583,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],rays of the sun to bring with them the food needful for their
5584,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"sustenance. And when she referred to the old carriage, Mr. Digby felt as"
5585,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],if his conscience was indeed disturbed. There were two statements
5586,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],addressed to him. One referred to the homely nature of the wagon. The
5587,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"other said, if you could allow a woman who has been a faithful wife,--a"
5588,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"woman who has shared your fortunes for fifteen years,--who has never"
5589,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"spared herself to order her household well,--who is the mother of seven"
5590,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"children of whom you are very proud,--to crown all,--who has practised"
5591,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"for fifteen years in your house, in the most untiring manner the most"
5592,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"exact, and even unreasonable economy,--buying only what she has been"
5593,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"forced to do under the pressure of necessity,--if you could allow such a"
5594,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"woman to go in that old wagon, when this new and pleasant carriage could"
5595,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"be purchased, and that too when she is willing to give part of the money"
5596,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"which was sent her by her affectionate aunt, that aforesaid money having"
5597,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"been intended for her own personal benefit,--why then you are one of"
5598,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"those of whom the world may well say, that it is fortunate that you are"
5599,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],not placed in a situation where you could become a pirate.
5600,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5601,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"After all this moving eloquence, one passage was repeated in express"
5602,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],words. Mr. Digby was told that if he would agree to the purchase of the
5603,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"carriage and the harness which appropriately belonged to it, she would"
5604,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],expend in paying for it the three hundred dollars sent her by her aunt.
5605,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"In that case he would have to advance but one hundred dollars, and by"
5606,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"that insignificant outlay, insignificant of course she meant in"
5607,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"comparison of that which they would gain, for economy is wealth, and she"
5608,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"could not throw away a dollar on any account, he would secure this"
5609,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"invaluable vehicle, and prove himself a man who had some regard for his"
5610,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],wife.
5611,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5612,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Mr. Digby suggested that some of this money, sent by the aunt was to"
5613,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"have paid for the window-curtains. He intended to add in order, some"
5614,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"other purchases, all of which were to have a partial payment from the"
5615,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],same treasured notes. But this suggestion only brought upon him a storm
5616,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],of virtuous indignation. Nothing could be more unreasonable than to
5617,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],expect that her money should be devoted to such purposes. All that she
5618,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"could say, was, that the curtains were necessities. And what would they"
5619,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],have done if the aunt had not sent the money? If the present had not
5620,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"come, he would never have thought that she would be the one who ought to"
5621,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],supply the money for such necessary expenses.
5622,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5623,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"So the carriage was bought, and at last the money of the aunt was"
5624,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],expended.
5625,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5626,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"Mr. Digby made a calculation, and found that the three hundred dollars"
5627,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"of the aunt, had been expended in part payment for purchases which cost"
5628,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],him about one thousand dollars. He uttered the fervent hope that the
5629,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],good aunt would not send any more of her precious gifts.
5630,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5631,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],Note. The manuscript here again becomes illegible. As far as I can
5632,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"gather from a word which can be distinguished here and there, Mr. Digby,"
5633,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"after much suffering, and a severe illness from mental excitement, found"
5634,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"that his good lady, who was really a woman of affectionate nature,"
5635,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"changed all her views. Some one, at the close of the manuscript, appears"
5636,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"to be inquiring of him, how it is that he has attained great peace of"
5637,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"mind. The reply seems to be to the effect, that all the old theories are"
5638,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"exploded from their domestic arrangements, and that in place of all"
5639,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"other questions, the one consideration now is, what their income will"
5640,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"enable them to purchase. And there also seems to be an assertion, that"
5641,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"he no longer feels as if he was in danger of ruin, when any of their"
5642,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],relatives sends his wife a present. There further appears to be some
5643,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"apology to the proverb, which he so greatly despised in former times,"
5644,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],that economy is wealth.
5645,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],
5646,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"[Footnote 1: This paper was so much injured by time, that the editor"
5647,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],could decipher only some portions. But he has concluded to publish these
5648,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"fragmentary hints, which may be of utility, and open some eyes, as they"
5649,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"reveal some similar weaknesses, of a propensity to live beyond one's"
5650,_MRS. DIGBY'S ECONOMY._[1],"income, which modern progress has not yet perfectly removed from all"
