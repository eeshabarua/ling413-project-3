5570,THE LONE BIRD.,
5571,THE LONE BIRD.,Perhaps I may speak some word that has healing
5572,THE LONE BIRD.,"For solitude's wounds, e'en sweet tho' they be,"
5573,THE LONE BIRD.,"For sorrows augment by sacred concealing,"
5574,THE LONE BIRD.,And steal from the heart ev'ry wish to be free.

5632,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"A sweet, tiny bird on a twig near the river,"

5636,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,
5637,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"Then glancing the eye to a branch that was near them,"

6482,FIDELITY.,
6483,FIDELITY.,
6484,FIDELITY.,The Rippowams were a tribe of Indians living along the Sound near
6485,FIDELITY.,"Stamford and Norwalk, Ct., and extended their territory for some miles"
6486,FIDELITY.,"northward. The Kitchewonks were a tribe living on the Hudson, near Sing"
6487,FIDELITY.,"Sing and Peekskill, N. Y., and found their way eastward. In the early"
6488,FIDELITY.,days of the Indian occupation of these lands the Rippowams followed up
6489,FIDELITY.,"the stream running from the three lakes--Round Pond, Middle Pond, and"
6490,FIDELITY.,Lower Pond--while the Kitchewonks followed that branch of the Croton
6491,FIDELITY.,"which finds its source in Cross Pond, now Lake Kitchewan. For the"
6492,FIDELITY.,possession of these grounds there were frequent battles between these
6493,FIDELITY.,"tribes, as the lake-land abounded in fish and game. The intercourse"
6494,FIDELITY.,"between these tribes, both belonging to the Mohegans, was very limited,"
6495,FIDELITY.,"at first, but in course of time became more frequent and friendly. A"
6496,FIDELITY.,lime and marble ridge separates Lake Kitchewan from the three lower
6497,FIDELITY.,lakes and forms a watershed between the Hudson and the sound.
6498,FIDELITY.,
6499,FIDELITY.,"In recent years a dam was constructed by the Stamford Water Co., and the"
6500,FIDELITY.,"three lakes were made into one, and very appropriately called"
6501,FIDELITY.,"thereafter, Trinity. The lakes are supplied almost entirely by springs,"
6502,FIDELITY.,as no streams of any size empty into them.
6503,FIDELITY.,
6504,FIDELITY.,"For several years, in the spring time, a floating island appeared in"
6505,FIDELITY.,"Trinity, upon which vegetation grew abundantly. This island sank upon"
6506,FIDELITY.,the approach of cold weather and remained in a state of hibernation
6507,FIDELITY.,until the spring came. Some person or persons who had no love for the
6508,FIDELITY.,"romantic, curious, and beautiful, loaded it so heavily with stones that"
6509,FIDELITY.,it sank to rise no more.
6510,FIDELITY.,
6511,FIDELITY.,In its departure the lake sustained the loss of an attraction which is
6512,FIDELITY.,known in but few lakes in the world.

6514,FIDELITY.,"A large rock, estimated to weigh eight or ten tons, is so nicely poised"

6522,FIDELITY.,When the infant world in its swaddling band
6523,FIDELITY.,"Of mist and cloud and storm,"
6524,FIDELITY.,"Assumed its forms of sea and land,"
6525,FIDELITY.,"And the lakes and streams were born,"
6526,FIDELITY.,"In this western world, on the eastern shore,"
6527,FIDELITY.,"Four leagues from the inland sea,"
6528,FIDELITY.,"Came a liquid crown set with jewels four,"
6529,FIDELITY.,But in union only three;
6530,FIDELITY.,For the northern gem was a solitaire
6531,FIDELITY.,"And barred from the lesser three,"
6532,FIDELITY.,By a marble wall wrought strong and fair
6533,FIDELITY.,By the hand of Divinity.
6534,FIDELITY.,
6535,FIDELITY.,A silver thread from the Trinity
6536,FIDELITY.,"Ran southward through the wood,"
6537,FIDELITY.,"Till it lost its flow in the land-locked sea,"
6538,FIDELITY.,And was merged in old Neptune's flood;
6539,FIDELITY.,But the northern gem in a mystic race
6540,FIDELITY.,"Sent a message toward the west,"
6541,FIDELITY.,And linked itself in the kind embrace
6542,FIDELITY.,Of the Hudson grandly dressed.
6543,FIDELITY.,
6544,FIDELITY.,Ten thousand moons had waxed and waned
6545,FIDELITY.,And flung on the mirror sheet
6546,FIDELITY.,"A train of beauty, with no discord stained"
6547,FIDELITY.,Since creation stood complete.
6548,FIDELITY.,Here antlered deer had slaked their thirst
6549,FIDELITY.,And fought their imaged form;
6550,FIDELITY.,"Here rolling tones of thunder burst,"
6551,FIDELITY.,As a harbinger of storm;
6552,FIDELITY.,Here song of bird and sigh of breeze
6553,FIDELITY.,Had ne'er met human ear;
6554,FIDELITY.,"The beast on land, the fowl on trees"
6555,FIDELITY.,Dwelt here in peace and knew no fear.
6556,FIDELITY.,
6557,FIDELITY.,Brave Kitchewonks had traced their way
6558,FIDELITY.,"Along the stream that westward ran,"
6559,FIDELITY.,While Rippowams pursued their prey
6560,FIDELITY.,Until this lake-land was their van.
6561,FIDELITY.,'Twas here Mohegan met again
6562,FIDELITY.,"The blood that in Mohegan flowed,"
6563,FIDELITY.,"But each regarded not the vein,"
6564,FIDELITY.,"Though kinsmen, foes they firmly stood."
6565,FIDELITY.,"This lake-land, rich in fish and game,"
6566,FIDELITY.,Was ground for strife and war and blood;
6567,FIDELITY.,From west and south the warriors came
6568,FIDELITY.,In battle paint and surly mood.
6569,FIDELITY.,The Kitchewonks near northern lake
6570,FIDELITY.,"Upon the Rippowams looked down,"
6571,FIDELITY.,And hoped their power and pride to break
6572,FIDELITY.,E'er harvest-moon had fully grown.
6573,FIDELITY.,
6574,FIDELITY.,ALMETA on the western stream
6575,FIDELITY.,"Now mourned her absent PONOMO,"
6576,FIDELITY.,For harvest-moon had sent its gleam
6577,FIDELITY.,"Across the Hudson's tidal flow,"
6578,FIDELITY.,"And at its full he was to come,"
6579,FIDELITY.,"And her to lake-land safely guide,"
6580,FIDELITY.,"Where they should make their future home,"
6581,FIDELITY.,And she should there become his bride.
6582,FIDELITY.,"But he had with Rippowams' band,"
6583,FIDELITY.,"Marched forth to meet her kinsmen dear,"
6584,FIDELITY.,And face to face they sternly stand
6585,FIDELITY.,Prepared for battle-storm severe.
6586,FIDELITY.,
6587,FIDELITY.,Her heart bid her to dare the shock
6588,FIDELITY.,And seek him near the hostile camp;
6589,FIDELITY.,"Her mind her heart would basely mock,"
6590,FIDELITY.,And boding fears her ardor damp;
6591,FIDELITY.,The bondage of her heart so great
6592,FIDELITY.,Her coward mind could never free;
6593,FIDELITY.,"She heeds no danger, dares all fate,"
6594,FIDELITY.,And this her brief soliloquy:
6595,FIDELITY.,
6596,FIDELITY.,"""I know that tribal laws demand"
6597,FIDELITY.,"My life if I should thither flee,"
6598,FIDELITY.,I must obey that great command--
6599,FIDELITY.,God's higher law--fidelity.
6600,FIDELITY.,"No other lips my lips have pressed,"
6601,FIDELITY.,"No other arms encircled me,"
6602,FIDELITY.,Since he my maiden form caressed
6603,FIDELITY.,And each breathed vows of constancy.
6604,FIDELITY.,For me at each returning moon
6605,FIDELITY.,"He journeyed through the forest wild,"
6606,FIDELITY.,"Braved dangers that my heart hath won,"
6607,FIDELITY.,And now I must not be defiled
6608,FIDELITY.,By any doubt or any fear
6609,FIDELITY.,That death or suffering may bring.
6610,FIDELITY.,I'd count such sacrifice not dear
6611,FIDELITY.,If I must be an offering.
6612,FIDELITY.,
6613,FIDELITY.,"""What though my blood may stain the soil,"
6614,FIDELITY.,Devotion mark me for a slave
6615,FIDELITY.,"Through weary years to strive and toil,"
6616,FIDELITY.,Or fate should sink me 'neath the wave!
6617,FIDELITY.,'Twere better far that such should be
6618,FIDELITY.,Than I should violate my heart
6619,FIDELITY.,And all that's sacred unto me
6620,FIDELITY.,By acting a base traitor's part.
6621,FIDELITY.,"I must away, I must away"
6622,FIDELITY.,To meet him by the silvery lake!
6623,FIDELITY.,'Tis crime for me to longer stay
6624,FIDELITY.,"I will not, cannot now forsake."""
6625,FIDELITY.,
6626,FIDELITY.,She speeds along the forest trail
6627,FIDELITY.,"Where warriors late in painted form,"
6628,FIDELITY.,Had marched through Kitchewan's fair vale
6629,FIDELITY.,To meet their foes in battle-storm.
6630,FIDELITY.,"Her eyes are watchful to survey,"
6631,FIDELITY.,"Her ears detect the lightest sound,"
6632,FIDELITY.,Her heart and mind to her betray
6633,FIDELITY.,Where barriers to her flight are found.
6634,FIDELITY.,She shuns them all by tact and skill;
6635,FIDELITY.,Most gladly she to him will prove
6636,FIDELITY.,"The power that's in a woman's will,"
6637,FIDELITY.,The faith that's in a woman's love.
6638,FIDELITY.,
6639,FIDELITY.,From hill and ledge she scans the ground
6640,FIDELITY.,While dangers seem her faith to mock;
6641,FIDELITY.,"But highest point by her is found,"
6642,FIDELITY.,"She stands upon the swaying rock,"
6643,FIDELITY.,"Which seems unsteady 'neath her feet,"
6644,FIDELITY.,And makes her doubt if she can stand
6645,FIDELITY.,"To make inspection so complete,"
6646,FIDELITY.,She may discern PONOMO'S band.
6647,FIDELITY.,The trembling rock and trembling heart
6648,FIDELITY.,"Are firmly fixed, no power can move;"
6649,FIDELITY.,But from its crest she must depart
6650,FIDELITY.,In search of him her heart doth love.
6651,FIDELITY.,She stands beside the central lake
6652,FIDELITY.,"Along whose shores the war-whoop rang,"
6653,FIDELITY.,"And softly for her own heart's sake,"
6654,FIDELITY.,This song of harvest-moon she sang:
6655,FIDELITY.,
6656,FIDELITY.,"""The hunter's moon now floods the night"
6657,FIDELITY.,"Turns darkness into day,"
6658,FIDELITY.,"The wood and lake in mellow light,"
6659,FIDELITY.,Charm grief and care away.
6660,FIDELITY.,
6661,FIDELITY.,"""The sparkling water's silvery gleam"
6662,FIDELITY.,"My sorrow soothes for me,"
6663,FIDELITY.,And lifts my soul in fancy's dream
6664,FIDELITY.,To thoughts so pure and free.
6665,FIDELITY.,
6666,FIDELITY.,"""So bright the light that fills the night,"
6667,FIDELITY.,The song-birds sweetly sing;
6668,FIDELITY.,From tree to tree they take their flight
6669,FIDELITY.,On swift yet noiseless wing.
6670,FIDELITY.,
6671,FIDELITY.,"""Now come, PONOMO, come to me,"
6672,FIDELITY.,I wait your coming here;
6673,FIDELITY.,"You promised 'neath this hemlock tree,"
6674,FIDELITY.,At midnight to appear.
6675,FIDELITY.,
6676,FIDELITY.,"""My heart, my life, my all is yours,"
6677,FIDELITY.,And you are all to me;
6678,FIDELITY.,Faith trusts your promise and assures
6679,FIDELITY.,Unchanged fidelity.
6680,FIDELITY.,
6681,FIDELITY.,"""I know your heart is warm and true,"
6682,FIDELITY.,"Your love not cold or dumb,"
6683,FIDELITY.,No earthly power can it subdue;
6684,FIDELITY.,"I know that you will come."""
6685,FIDELITY.,
6686,FIDELITY.,She hears a footstep drawing near;
6687,FIDELITY.,"Her voice is mute, her song is done,"
6688,FIDELITY.,"She waits, PONOMO to appear,"
6689,FIDELITY.,In shadowed silence all alone.
6690,FIDELITY.,Beneath lugubrious hemlock shade
6691,FIDELITY.,"Her heart beats with expectancy,"
6692,FIDELITY.,And Kitchewonk's own dusky maid
6693,FIDELITY.,Trusts Rippowam's fidelity.
6694,FIDELITY.,He comes! She sees him near the lake;
6695,FIDELITY.,"She knows his form, his step, his voice;"
6696,FIDELITY.,No other charm for her could make
6697,FIDELITY.,Her heart and soul so much rejoice.
6698,FIDELITY.,
6699,FIDELITY.,They meet beside the water's edge
6700,FIDELITY.,"Where hemlock boughs in silence nod,"
6701,FIDELITY.,"And there with mutual vow and pledge,"
6702,FIDELITY.,"In presence of their living God,"
6703,FIDELITY.,"They join the hand, the heart, the life,"
6704,FIDELITY.,"While harvest-moon a witness stood,"
6705,FIDELITY.,"That he the husband, she the wife,"
6706,FIDELITY.,Should share in life's vicissitude.
6707,FIDELITY.,That sacred pledge was heard on high
6708,FIDELITY.,"And written by an angel hand,"
6709,FIDELITY.,"Nor priest, nor king, nor majesty,"
6710,FIDELITY.,Could marriage rites perform more grand.
6711,FIDELITY.,
6712,FIDELITY.,No tribal laws or priestly hand
6713,FIDELITY.,Can rivet adverse hearts in one;
6714,FIDELITY.,Compulsion has no iron band
6715,FIDELITY.,So strong it may not be undone;
6716,FIDELITY.,But ties of mutual interest
6717,FIDELITY.,"That spring spontaneous from the soul,"
6718,FIDELITY.,"Are never by themselves oppressed,"
6719,FIDELITY.,Their silken cords have full control.
6720,FIDELITY.,"To know, to feel, to fully share"
6721,FIDELITY.,"The joys and sorrows of this life,"
6722,FIDELITY.,"Unites the souls of mated pair,"
6723,FIDELITY.,And make the husband and the wife.
6724,FIDELITY.,
6725,FIDELITY.,"PONOMO and ALMETA there,"
6726,FIDELITY.,"Where juts of rocks 'neath hemlock boughs,"
6727,FIDELITY.,"Had breathed a mutual, fervent prayer,"
6728,FIDELITY.,"And each to each pledged sacred vows,"
6729,FIDELITY.,"When o'er the lake the war-whoop rang,"
6730,FIDELITY.,"And Kitchewonks, on every side,"
6731,FIDELITY.,"Swept down with shout and yell and clang,"
6732,FIDELITY.,Upon PONOMO and his bride.
6733,FIDELITY.,"On north and south, and on the west,"
6734,FIDELITY.,"No way of flight then could they take,"
6735,FIDELITY.,So from the rough rocks' rugged side
6736,FIDELITY.,They plunged into the central lake.
6737,FIDELITY.,
6738,FIDELITY.,"A hundred arrows cleft the air,"
6739,FIDELITY.,But one alone had reached its mark.
6740,FIDELITY.,PONOMO felt it roughly tear
6741,FIDELITY.,Its way into his faithful heart.
6742,FIDELITY.,"He shrieked and sank beneath the wave,"
6743,FIDELITY.,ALMETA followed after him;
6744,FIDELITY.,"Their bridal couch was watery grave,"
6745,FIDELITY.,The war-whoop was their requiem.
6746,FIDELITY.,
6747,FIDELITY.,The savage yell of victory
6748,FIDELITY.,"Re-echoed then from shore to shore,"
6749,FIDELITY.,While every rock and every tree
6750,FIDELITY.,"Seemed deeply tinged with human gore,"
6751,FIDELITY.,For when the moon from heavenly throne
6752,FIDELITY.,"Looked down and saw the ghastly deed,"
6753,FIDELITY.,"It veiled itself and feebly shone,"
6754,FIDELITY.,As if in agony to plead
6755,FIDELITY.,That human souls might ever know
6756,FIDELITY.,That God himself cannot approve
6757,FIDELITY.,"The hand that strikes avenging blow,"
6758,FIDELITY.,The soul devoid fraternal love.
6759,FIDELITY.,
6760,FIDELITY.,"'Neath crystal waters of the lake,"
6761,FIDELITY.,"In silent, undisturbed repose,"
6762,FIDELITY.,"Where sounds of strife no slumbers break,"
6763,FIDELITY.,"Heedless alike of friends and foes,"
6764,FIDELITY.,"They slept the long, long sleep of death,"
6765,FIDELITY.,"Through centuries of rolling years,"
6766,FIDELITY.,While o'er their forms the zephyrs' breath
6767,FIDELITY.,In playful eddyings oft appears.
6768,FIDELITY.,Their race has faded from the shore
6769,FIDELITY.,And left few traces that they were;
6770,FIDELITY.,"The war-whoop now resounds no more,"
6771,FIDELITY.,They bowed before White Conqueror.
6772,FIDELITY.,"Full many a fathom 'neath the wave,"
6773,FIDELITY.,"Their forms have mouldered side by side,"
6774,FIDELITY.,While shadowy hemlocks fringe the grave
6775,FIDELITY.,Of dark PONOMO and his bride.
6776,FIDELITY.,
6777,FIDELITY.,The waters then were deeper made
6778,FIDELITY.,"Which gave their spirits much unrest,"
6779,FIDELITY.,The lake their agony betrayed
6780,FIDELITY.,And seemed on every side distressed.
6781,FIDELITY.,One spring when Nature gaily dressed
6782,FIDELITY.,"With charms that could the mind beguile,"
6783,FIDELITY.,There rose upon the lake's fair breast
6784,FIDELITY.,"A hibernating, floating isle."
6785,FIDELITY.,"Devoid of life it seemed at first,"
6786,FIDELITY.,"Chaotic, dull, with beauty none,"
6787,FIDELITY.,But rays of sunshine on it burst
6788,FIDELITY.,And changed it to a paragon.
6789,FIDELITY.,
6790,FIDELITY.,Two alders sprang from near its edge
6791,FIDELITY.,"And twined in close embrace,"
6792,FIDELITY.,While ferns and grass gave certain pledge
6793,FIDELITY.,That Time should give it smiling face.
6794,FIDELITY.,But when the frosts of autumn fell
6795,FIDELITY.,"It sank from sight, perchance to rest;"
6796,FIDELITY.,No searching mind could ever tell
6797,FIDELITY.,The secret of its rising crest.
6798,FIDELITY.,"For years, at each returning spring,"
6799,FIDELITY.,"The isle would rise from 'neath the wave,"
6800,FIDELITY.,As if to memory to bring
6801,FIDELITY.,PONOMO and ALMETA'S grave.
6802,FIDELITY.,"But when the harvest-moon shone bright,"
6803,FIDELITY.,It meekly sank; as years before
6804,FIDELITY.,"When on that dread, but fatal night,"
6805,FIDELITY.,The faithful sank by rock-bound shore.
6806,FIDELITY.,
6807,FIDELITY.,"Its verdure grew, its alders spread,"
6808,FIDELITY.,"Its fame extended many a mile,"
6809,FIDELITY.,'Twas type of resurrected dead--
6810,FIDELITY.,"This hibernating, floating isle."
6811,FIDELITY.,
6812,FIDELITY.,But vandal hands destroyed the prize
6813,FIDELITY.,"And sank it 'neath a weight of stones,"
6814,FIDELITY.,"While ALMETA sends forth her sighs,"
6815,FIDELITY.,And PONOMO emits his groans.
6816,FIDELITY.,"Here let them rest, if rest they may,"
6817,FIDELITY.,"Amid the beauteous scenes around,"
6818,FIDELITY.,"And wait in peace the final day,"
6819,FIDELITY.,"When at the angel's trumpet sound,"
6820,FIDELITY.,"The water shall give up its prey,"
6821,FIDELITY.,"The earth shall full surrender make,"
6822,FIDELITY.,"For heaven has not a type to-day,"
6823,FIDELITY.,More perfect than this sky-blue lake.

6831,FINIS.,"After our labor is finished,"
6832,FINIS.,"After the struggle is done,"
6833,FINIS.,A restful surcease awaits us
6834,FINIS.,At the setting of life's sun.
6835,FINIS.,If when our toil seemed the sorest
6836,FINIS.,The heart refused to retreat
6837,FINIS.,"From a grand and noble purpose,"
6838,FINIS.,"Till the vic'try was complete,"
6839,FINIS.,"Then shall joyous crown await us,"
6840,FINIS.,"Resplendent with jewels rare,"
6841,FINIS.,And a radiance of honor
6842,FINIS.,The face shall benignly wear;
6843,FINIS.,Not that our works were all faultless
6844,FINIS.,"And free from error and wrong,"
6845,FINIS.,But because our sincere purpose
6846,FINIS.,Made us brave and true and strong.
6847,FINIS.,
6848,FINIS.,"Results of labor thus rendered,"
6849,FINIS.,"Are safely trusted to Heaven,"
6850,FINIS.,"For He who knows ev'ry motive,"
6851,FINIS.,Understands _why_ we have striven.
6852,FINIS.,If to man were given the balance
6853,FINIS.,"To adjust with equity,"
6854,FINIS.,"His weakness and imperfection,"
6855,FINIS.,"His greed and his jealousy,"
6856,FINIS.,"Might sway the poise from adjustment,"
6857,FINIS.,"And his judgment go astray,"
6858,FINIS.,Through the frailties of his nature--
6859,FINIS.,Imperfect humanity
6860,FINIS.,
6861,FINIS.,"The Infallible in knowledge,"
6862,FINIS.,"Whose true balance never swerves,"
6863,FINIS.,"Knows every man's Gethsemane,"
6864,FINIS.,And the merit he deserves.
6865,FINIS.,He will not ask figs of the thorns;
6866,FINIS.,Of talents will not demand
6867,FINIS.,A greater increase than is just
6868,FINIS.,From a faithful steward's hand.
6869,FINIS.,Feeling the weight of the mission
6870,FINIS.,Incumbent upon our care;
6871,FINIS.,Searching the heart's deep recesses
6872,FINIS.,That vice may not shelter there;
6873,FINIS.,Working courageously onward
6874,FINIS.,The truth and right to defend;
6875,FINIS.,"And asking a perfect guidance,"
6876,FINIS.,We calmly welcome the end.
