39,PREFACE,Most of the poems collected in this volume have already seen the light
40,PREFACE,"of print in the _Colonnade_, the monthly publication of the Andiron Club"
41,PREFACE,of New York University. The effort of the author has not been to write
42,PREFACE,"verses especially adapted to the taste of the modern public, but rather"
43,PREFACE,"to create ""a thing of beauty"" from the theme that filled his mind at the"
44,PREFACE,time. Often he has been led into somewhat bold innovations such as the
45,PREFACE,"invention of the miniature ode, and the associating of an idea with a"
46,PREFACE,rime-_motiv_ in the metrical short-stories. While he hopes that the new
47,PREFACE,"forms will justify themselves, he realizes that after all, the poems"
48,PREFACE,must stand or fall in proportion to the amount of pure artistic beauty
49,PREFACE,contained within them.

734,III,A witch dwelt high upon stern Endor's cliff.
735,III,The place was dark: for night had drawn the veiling
736,III,"Between the mountain peaks that stand still, stiff,"
737,III,The frozen sentinels of Time; and sailing
738,III,"Aloft upon the evening air, the smoke"
739,III,Of hostile camp-fires blackened e'en the night.
740,III,"Here dwelt this hag to horrid witchcraft given,"
741,III,"A withered, fangless thing whose mutterings spoke"
742,III,Of all the secrets of Hell's shadow-light.
743,III,"The wind was coldly wailing. Near her fire,"
744,III,"She crouched. Behind her, through a passage riven"
745,III,"By some swift thunderbolt of wrath divine,"
746,III,Appeared a man in closely wrapped attire.
747,III,Like some lithe snake she turned and cringed
748,III,"In fear and yet in anger: ""By what sign,"
749,III,"And wherefore come you here?"" her lips half snarled."
750,III,The man unwrapped his mantle deeply fringed;
751,III,"He threw a purse before her. ""For this cost,"

766,III,King Saul sat staring into sable space;
767,III,The witch was mumbling by the fire-side
768,III,Whence curled up wisps of smoke. His heart beat fast.
769,III,Within the gray appeared a dim-lit face.
770,III,"In silent terror gazed the King. At last,"
771,III,Was audible a voice upon the wind:
772,III,"""What would'st thou, Saul? What would'st thou learn from me?"""
773,III,"""Samuel, 'tis thou--"" and then, as in a gust"
774,III,"The storm sweeps down upon the plain, words burst"
775,III,In hot-lipped passion uncontrolled and fast--

792,III,"There rose a shout again, and yet again--"

811,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Wove the soft, vaporous substance of the gloom."
812,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The story-sculptured Gothic porch lay dim
813,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And silent in drab haze with which the spring
814,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Covers its carpentry of summer bloom.
815,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,A maiden stood within the porch's pale.
816,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""It is the night,"" she sighed, ""Saint Marcus' night"
817,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,When ghosts of all foredoomed to sickness wing
818,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Into the church to pray; so runs the tale.
819,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Those who make no return shall feel the grim,"
820,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Fell scythe of Death within the year. The light

825,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Passed through her lips more still than silence, frail."
826,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The lowering mist grew darker. From the womb
827,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Of day, young night was born. The paling light"
828,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Was flecked with haze-clouds flickering in the gloom;
829,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And to and fro in stately pageantry,"
830,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Strange shadow-shapes like liquid-silver spume
831,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Charmed into lightness, formed an imagery"
832,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of things half-human.
833,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Still the maiden pale
834,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Waited and hung upon each shadowy trail
835,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of lingering vapors fainting to and fro.
836,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,They took the shape of flitting forms in mail
837,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Or monkish cowl. A Merlin-magic spell
838,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Seemed laid upon her. ""And art _thou_ to go?"""
839,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She whispered as some well-known face amid
840,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The rest swept by her through that portal fell.
841,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And some, not marked for Death, returned again;"
842,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And some returned not. O'er the porch's rail,"
843,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Leant her light body as she scanned each form,"
844,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And tensely looked with terror anxious-eyed.
845,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Why does she shrink with all-consuming pain,"
846,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And seek to gaze again? A blinding storm
847,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Of anguish breaks upon her. ""O what doom"

850,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Pale Gascon's figure fled along the tide--

852,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"But his returned not. Ever anguish-eyed,"
853,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She paused and waited--waited in the gloom.
854,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,At last the flying cloud flakes ceased to come;
855,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And stilly night arose. ""My God, to whom"
856,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"May I turn now? My richest Self is rent!"""
857,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Down from the carven doorway stumbling slow,"
858,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"The maiden passed, silent with languishment."
859,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Forth from the darkness stepped a man. All dumb,"
860,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She gazed in careless stupor such as woe
861,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Stamps on the soul.
862,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""My Lady, may I dare--"""
863,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"He paused, and gazed, bowed sweepingly and low,"
864,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Then spoke again. She stood there sad and fair,"
865,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Quivering like a heat-cloud in the air.
866,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Lady, a traveler asks the way to where"

868,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"She stayed herself in stupor; 'tis but meet,"
869,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,A soul come slowly from behind the veil.
870,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Come--come,"" she said, upon her face a smile"
871,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of sorrow blent with some strange joyance pale.
872,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"They passed along the quaintly cobbled street,"
873,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And then turned through a lane where high up-reared,"
874,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The gloomy oaks and hawthorne hedges greet
875,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The eye on either hand. A cottage stood
876,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,With banks of sleepy flowers at its feet;
877,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And all around, the giant, hoary wood"
878,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Frowned down its shadows on the garden's bloom,"
879,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Frowned down, a fateful harbinger of gloom."
880,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Within the cottage, all was warmth and cheer."
881,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,There stayed the mother waiting the return
882,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of her sweet child. They entered. She did greet
883,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Both with an all-inclusive smile, and clear,"
884,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Unchanging peace and kindliness that burn

892,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"By which to fare."""
893,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Beside the oaken board,"
894,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"They sat and ate the rustic dishes there,"
895,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,While young Sir Guy poured forth a glittering hoard
896,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of warriored stories gathered far away:
897,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,How one brave knight pierced twenty paynim through;
898,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And how another fled from the affray
899,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,To be enslaved by Sarazain corsair.
900,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The maiden hungered for each word. How frail
901,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Be warriors' lives! Upon the thought, she knew"
902,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,A bitter memory of forecast's gloom.
903,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Oh, she must fly. Oh, something must avail"
904,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,To give her refuge from this festering sting.
905,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"She tried to turn her mind from sorrow's trail,"
906,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And gave her thoughts to the narrator's tale.
907,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Now he was speaking of a lord who strove
908,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,To win his lady; but the Christian war
909,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Called him to battle for his Faith. He clove
910,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Damascus steel and clinking casques; but e'er
911,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,He could return--Sir Guy then ceased; for here
912,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Arose a warning on the mother's brow.
913,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She wished no bitter recollections. Fear
914,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,For Marie's plausance was her only care.
915,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Soon all the cottage slept 'mid the garden's bloom;
916,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And fatefully the forest frowned its gloom.
917,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"The summer blossomed, faded, and then died;"
918,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And still as if enchanted, stayed he there."
919,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"They took long walks o'er lonely hill and dale,"
920,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And went across the fields with flowers pied.
921,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,At times their voices rang upon the air;
922,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,But ever when they came upon that vale
923,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Where, in its flowery charm, the cottage stood,"
924,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Their talk would fail within the vasty wood.
925,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Thus bathed their souls in summer's sultry tide
926,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Like flashing moths upon the wind that ride.
927,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And hectic autumn came and brought its charm
928,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of leafy brilliance heralding its death.
929,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Beside the evening blaze, full many a tale"
930,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,He told of knights in chivalrous career;
931,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,But never raised the fluttering alarm
932,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of the maiden's mother by the faintest breath
933,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of the warrior lord and his loved one dear.
934,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Then hoary, chilling winter shrouded pale,"
935,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Came, and passed by: thus wandered on, the year."
936,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,The spring was coldly wrapped in sullen haze;
937,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Even the mounting sun seemed scarce as warm
938,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,As during winter. Slowly passed the days
939,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Until the Eve of blest Saint Marcus came.
940,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Among the misty-shadowed forest ways,"
941,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Sir Guy did bring the maiden arm in arm.
942,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,How oft the times that they had done the same--
943,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""I've lived a life, careless and debonair,"
944,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,And know nor fettering bonds nor fear;
945,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Yet would I leave it all without a care--"""
946,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She upward glanced and then glanced down as pale
947,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,As any flowing haze-wreath in the gloom.
948,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Oh, what is that?"" she cried. The misty veil"
949,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Parted and showed a glimpse of rock-built wall.
950,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""'Tis but the village kirk,"" he said. A pall"
951,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of haze enwrapped them like the Will of Doom.
952,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"She stood and faced him, quivering as a sail"
953,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,That blows uncertain in a varying wind.
954,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Marie, Marie,"" he faltered. Then a flare"
955,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Of passion burnt his soul out in his eyes.
956,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Downward she glances seeming unaware;
957,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"But in her heart beneath the outward guise,"
958,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Warring emotions make her spirit quail.
959,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Gascon's loved image into vision flies;
960,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"And yet her rising love, she cannot quell"
961,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"For brave Sir Guy; and then, as when the flail"
962,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Lashes the chaff, dim mist before her flies"
963,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Into the church in Gascon's image pale.
964,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"The year is out. What then, should _he_ avail?"
965,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Marie--"" Sir Guy is breathing on the air;"
966,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,She reads the rest within his flaming eyes.
967,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""Yes--yes,"" she murmurs."
968,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""O despair, despair!"
969,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"I have no hope; you fell into the snare!"""
970,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"His eyes dilated with mad light, he cries."
971,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"""I, I am Gascon whose memory you dare"
972,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,To flout for any knight who stays a year
973,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Within your sight! I am undone. My doom

979,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"She shrinks away, with inward tumult pale."
980,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,His voice is still. She hears a something fall.
981,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"With anguish in her eyes, she turns. There, all"
982,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Stretched out upon the ground, he lies. A well"
983,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Of ruby richness pulses with his frail,"
984,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,Departing breath. In Merlin-magic spell
985,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Of agony, she stares into the gloom."
986,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Pale figures, children of the mist-waves' womb"
987,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,In through the church's doorway seem to sail;
988,A METRICAL SHORT-STORY,"Spectral, they vanish in their destined tomb."

1079,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,And breathed the luscious calm.
1080,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Tense were my heart-strings tuned;
1081,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"And, madly quavering as I sighed,"
1082,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Their music sadly waxed and wailed--then swooned,"
1083,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,And floated feebly down in ebbing tide.
1084,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,
1085,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I gave my soul to battle. I defied
1086,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,All the unlovable in life;
1087,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I could have bartered Heavenly bliss and died
1088,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Willingly in the strife!
1089,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"To elevate mankind,"
1090,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Mine inward power, I strove to guide;"
1091,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"I harnessed the puissance of the mind,"
1092,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,And toward that end all be magnified!
1093,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,
1094,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I gave my soul to dreams sense-glorified
1095,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Till sated pleasure sank to pain.
1096,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I gave my soul to battle. I defied
1097,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,The sordid; but in vain--
1098,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Still, still, my spirit wept;"
1099,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Its goal was hopeless, deified."
1100,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Oh, would this saddened soul had ever slept"
1101,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Unborn; for slumber is a painless guide.

1112,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,
1113,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"It lay within a glass of green,"
1114,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,A sinuous glass of subtle green.
1115,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,It sparkled with a slimy sheen.
1116,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,A languorous fascination gleamed
1117,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,With glint of lapis lazuli;
1118,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,And from its silken surface streamed
1119,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,The scent of musk from Araby.
1120,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Ah--was that music only dreamed
1121,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,That tinct the drowsy scene?
1122,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"And was my fancy false, or seemed"
1123,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,The glass to lure me with its limpid green?
1124,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,
1125,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"My fingers fluttered to the stem,"
1126,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"To kiss the fluted, serpent stem,"
1127,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"As pious Persians kiss the hem,"
1128,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Enwove with many a wanton trick,"
1129,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Of Persia's deified Sofi.
1130,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I could not see; the light seemed thick
1131,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"As perfume from the balsam-tree,"
1132,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Or incense in a basalic
1133,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,When sounds a requiem.
1134,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I drank the draught; my sense was sick;
1135,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,My quivering fingers crushed the curling stem.
1136,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,
1137,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I dropped the cup of crystal-green;
1138,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I scattered fragments emerald-green--
1139,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,False emeralds with a glassy sheen.
1140,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Upon the pavement, how they gleamed!"
1141,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I flung the bits of serpent-stem
1142,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Upon the table beryl-seamed.
1143,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,I swept them with my garment's hem--
1144,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,"Some say I laughed--That night, I dreamed"
1145,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Of Araby--a scene
1146,AN ODE IN MINIATURE,Of sleepy charm whence fragrance streamed;

1160,I,
1161,I,A soul was once incarnate in a man;
1162,I,"And this unseen, incarnate thing was mine;"
1163,I,"And, as my body grew, the soul began"
1164,I,To sip more fondly of the scented wine
1165,I,And sugared blisses life can give at call.
1166,I,It languished amid luxuries divine
1167,I,Showering richly like the leaves that fall
1168,I,Upon the sensuous-silent autumn air.
1169,I,"Pale, fleeting Pleasure took my thoughtless all;"
1170,I,"For love, unselfish, passion-fervid, rare,"
1171,I,"Vibrated through the discords of dull time,"
1172,I,Blending them into harmony; for where
1173,I,"Life jangled harsh, a mother's care would chime"
1174,I,More blissful chords than can be told in rime.
1175,I,
1176,I,
1177,II,II
1178,II,
1179,II,"The gentle harmonies of love declined,"
1180,II,"And swooned into a dull, funereal moan,"
1181,II,And faintly floated onward with the wind.
1182,II,The symphony was gone; I stayed alone
1183,II,"In all-enshrouding, opiate sadness bound."
1184,II,I did not scream; I did not weep nor groan.
1185,II,My soul was locked in stupor whence it found
1186,II,"Only barred gates across dim vaults; and jangling,"
1187,II,Discordant chaos stung me like a wound.
1188,II,I could not think; I could not hope; the wrangling
1189,II,Of jarring sounds oppressed me till my brain
1190,II,"Was lost within a labyrinth, all-entangling--"
1191,II,But this I learned although my powers did wane;
1192,II,That Love through Death transmutes itself to pain.
1193,II,
1194,II,
1195,III,III
1196,III,
1197,III,I sank my soul upon a sea of dreams;
1198,III,I floated through aërial heights divine
1199,III,Where saffron clouds a-glint with amber beams
1200,III,"Shimmering strangely, stretched in shining line."
1201,III,"I winged my way to Heaven's very dome,"
1202,III,And on Hell's portal read the horrid sign;
1203,III,"I danced upon the wavelet's crested foam,"
1204,III,And swept tempestuous on the stormy wind.
1205,III,"On earth like some vague terror, did I roam"
1206,III,While moaning misery pursued behind.
1207,III,"Whene'er I sang, my song had one refrain"
1208,III,"With anxious care and artifice refined,"
1209,III,Until my soul's accompaniment would wane
1210,III,And wax to one _motiv_: unending pain.
1211,III,
1212,III,
1213,IV,IV
1214,IV,
1215,IV,I broke my dungeon-sepulchre of dreams;
1216,IV,I climbed the winding stair to palace halls
1217,IV,Where all the air was soothed by incense-streams;
1218,IV,And every sight within those magic walls
1219,IV,"Was bright with radiant, opalescent sheen"
1220,IV,"While lulling on the ear, light music falls"
1221,IV,Of such a melody as ne'er has been
1222,IV,Unless by fays on fairy lyres played.
1223,IV,"There Pleasure gowned in iridescent green,"
1224,IV,"Reclines upon her couch with gems inlaid,"
1225,IV,And gently beckons with a sinuous arm--
1226,IV,But all the sumptuous excesses fade;
1227,IV,"The walls seem dim; the music has no charm,"
1228,IV,For Pleasure's Palace is a place of harm.
1229,IV,
1230,IV,
1231,V,V
1232,V,
1233,V,I plunged through rooms of deepest Tyrian dye;
1234,V,I tore the veils from mysteries aside;
1235,V,But grinning pleasure ever met mine eye.
1236,V,"In anguished ecstasy of bliss, I cried;"
1237,V,"And through the halls, I heard the echo wane"
1238,V,"Until the last, most distant answer sighed:"
1239,V,"""The spirit of the world is pain, pain, pain--"""
1240,V,"Then from the drowsy distance, there did well"
1241,V,"A voice as of a witch before her fane,"
1242,V,"Soft-muttering, some Heaven-blasting spell:"
1243,V,"""The world is all in vain, the merest tool"
1244,V,"Of accident, an anteroom to Hell,"
1245,V,A counterfeit but fairly glinting pool--
1246,V,"Snatch all the joy thou canst, thou human fool!"""
1247,V,
1248,V,
1249,VI,VI
1250,VI,
1251,VI,And then I searched within myself to find
1252,VI,The _how_ and _why_ of all I heard and saw.
1253,VI,"I found but silent Nothing. Wearied, blind,"
1254,VI,I strove to learn the omnipresent Law
1255,VI,On whose foundation all these chambers lean.
1256,VI,I found within the artifice no flaw;
1257,VI,And not the slightest secret could I glean.
1258,VI,"I searched the winding, labyrinthine halls,"
1259,VI,And scanned colossal colonnades between
1260,VI,Whose rows unending space is seen that palls
1261,VI,"The straining sight, yet thither lures the eye"
1262,VI,"With fairy sheen. Through all the outer walls,"
1263,VI,"No doorway pierced to water, earth or sky:"
1264,VI,Is there an answer to the _how_ and _why_?
1265,VI,
1266,VI,
1267,VII,VII
1268,VII,
1269,VII,"And yet I am condemned to live, to be."
1270,VII,"What horrid Fate decreed it? Life is blind,"
1271,VII,"And cannot see the Truth. Oh, but for me"
1272,VII,"To know, to solve this riddle of the mind!"
1273,VII,And yet no whisper through the age's gloom
1274,VII,Has taught the latent answer that I pined;
1275,VII,"And finally in a sombre-tinted room,"
1276,VII,"I sank in languor on the marble floor,"
1277,VII,And faintly wondered at my destined doom.
1278,VII,"Upon my weary spirit, came once more"
1279,VII,"A faint remembrance of a former time,"
1280,VII,"A faint remembrance, I had known before,"
1281,VII,That clung about me like an ancient rime:
1282,VII,Death is to the soul but a change of clime.
1283,VII,
1284,VII,
1285,VIII,VIII
1286,VIII,
1287,VIII,Then from the body tear this soul away!
1288,VIII,Let me seek death; I'll force the hand of Fate!
1289,VIII,I will not suffer more. The game I play
1290,VIII,"Is held against Creation, and the weight"
1291,VIII,"Of all the ages hangs with Fate. Serene,"
1292,VIII,"Stands Death in sable gossamer bedight,"
1293,VIII,"And with maternal arms would intervene,"
1294,VIII,And seeks to press me silent to her breast.
1295,VIII,"Quick, let me free my soul from pain! The scene"
1296,VIII,"Is fair--Oh, let this weariness be blest!"
1297,VIII,But hold--I still may keep this bitter strain
1298,VIII,Of self-tormenting torment e'en in rest--
1299,VIII,Death summons up the things of life again;
1300,VIII,And pain of life transmutes all death to pain.
1301,VIII,
1302,VIII,
1303,IX,IX
1304,IX,
1305,IX,"Oh, but to float away upon the night,"
1306,IX,"To lose my soul upon her silent dark,"
1307,IX,"To feel myself a Nothing, a frail, light,"
1308,IX,"Aërial Emptiness, a fleeing spark"
1309,IX,"Of sunshine seeking on the endless void,"
1310,IX,"Some rest, some painless silence as its mark."
1311,IX,"Like an oblivion-destined asteroid,"
1312,IX,So would I that my soul should haste away
1313,IX,"From all the ordinary, earthly, cloyed,"
1314,IX,From all the tawdriness of living day;
1315,IX,"But still I know I cannot cease to be,"
1316,IX,Though I condemn my body back to clay--
1317,IX,O thrice accursèd immortality
1318,IX,That dooms me life through all Eternity!
1319,IX,
1320,IX,
1321,X,X
1322,X,
1323,X,O maddening horror in a smiling guise!
1324,X,"Alive or dead, I am a slave to life."
1325,X,The later torment with the former vies
1326,X,To wring my still-undying soul with strife.
1327,X,I have a debt; the creditor is Time:
1328,X,"""My bond, my bond,"" he cries, and holds the knife"
1329,X,To wound yet never kill. But what my crime?
1330,X,"I fled those pleasure-haunted halls where vile,"
1331,X,Sweet-scented blisses soothed to pain. A clime
1332,X,More active came within my ken. The dial
1333,X,"Of hours hurried round. The rich, new wine"
1334,X,"Of busy life, I found. A steady file"
1335,X,Swept past of mortal things with souls like mine--
1336,X,Yet what the purpose of their streaming line?
1337,X,
1338,X,
1339,XI,XI
1340,XI,
1341,XI,"With nervous yearning, haste they on their way:"
1342,XI,A few direct and rule the work of all;
1343,XI,"But most are bringing mortar, stone and clay--"
1344,XI,"(And some there are that rise, and others fall;"
1345,XI,And they are seen no more--we know not why.)
1346,XI,But all are working on the palace wall;
1347,XI,And some invent designs to please the eye;
1348,XI,And some would fain extend the rooms to win
1349,XI,New-fashioned blisses. A soft-moaning cry
1350,XI,"Is vibrant in the air. High-pitched and thin,"
1351,XI,"It quavers dimly, then descends again,"
1352,XI,And echoes aimless through the busy din:
1353,XI,"Mankind would add to pleasure, but in vain--"
1354,XI,For Pleasure's Palace is a house of pain.
1355,XI,
1356,XI,
1357,XII,XII
1358,XII,
1359,XII,"They strive; they strive, heap luxury on bliss,"
1360,XII,And worship Pleasure as their goddess-queen.
1361,XII,"Ah, take who will the subtle harlot's kiss!"
1362,XII,"Yes, seize thy moment's sweetness--then, I ween,"
1363,XII,"A pageantry of pain, such throbbing throes"
1364,XII,"As rive the soul, and cut the quick with keen,"
1365,XII,Imprisoned edges till the life-blood flows.
1366,XII,Man little knows it; but two aims has he:
1367,XII,"By present anguish, store up future woes,"
1368,XII,"By present anguish, pain posterity."
1369,XII,The quest for pleasure is a quest in vain;
1370,XII,Pleasure is Nothing in Eternity.
1371,XII,"Men rather act than think, for thought is pain,"
1372,XII,And action is the opiate of the brain.
1373,XII,
1374,XII,
1375,XIII,XIII
1376,XIII,
1377,XIII,"Shall I play Roman, face and fight these ills,"
1378,XIII,Pretend that I _can_ fight and still may win?
1379,XIII,"A child his dozen mimic soldiers drills,"
1380,XIII,"And six with six, the battle they begin."
1381,XIII,"Some victors, and some vanquished; some he slays--"
1382,XIII,But then the soldiers are mere toys of tin--
1383,XIII,"And carelessly upon the ground, he lays"
1384,XIII,Vanquished and victors on one common plane;
1385,XIII,And takes some other toy and laughs and plays--
1386,XIII,"Yes, like that soldier, may I fight, and gain"
1387,XIII,"Great victories. Oh, I may stare my Fate"
1388,XIII,"Between the eyes, and drink whole draughts of pain;"
1389,XIII,"With Stoic-strength, may struggle, and may hate;"
1390,XIII,But where's the payment that I vainly wait?
1391,XIII,
1392,XIII,
1393,XIV,XIV
1394,XIV,
1395,XIV,I dare not ponder on humanity;
1396,XIV,"Myself, I dare not ponder, nor my goal."
1397,XIV,"Oh, would that I were lost upon that sea"
1398,XIV,"Into whose silence, Lethe's currents roll."
1399,XIV,"Upon its bosom, would that I pressed mine,"
1400,XIV,Then might some kindly power transform this soul
1401,XIV,Into forgetfulness. Or would some wine
1402,XIV,Were brewed with musk or attar of the rose
1403,XIV,"And colored with a tint incarnadine,"
1404,XIV,And so compounded that a dreamless doze
1405,XIV,"Would come from one red, richly-scented draught."
1406,XIV,Or would that some unmoving glacier froze
1407,XIV,My soul within its crystal mine.--No craft
1408,XIV,Can save me from this cup of pain unquaffed.

1410,XIV,
1411,XV,XV
1412,XV,
1413,XV,"Oh, every soul is only pain embalmed;"
1414,XV,And every torment is but bliss's sting.
1415,XV,Humanity lies gasping and becalmed
1416,XV,Upon a torrid ocean; and no wing
1417,XV,Of albatross is seen--nor e'er was seen--
1418,XV,Our worldly hope is dead--yet rules as king.
1419,XV,"Dust, ashes, ashes, dust, upon these lean"
1420,XV,All of the upward struggle of mankind;
1421,XV,"And pain, unending pain, is all they glean."
1422,XV,"Goddess of pain, O mistress of the mind,"
1423,XV,Art thou the Soul of life? Or hast thou palmed
1424,XV,Thyself on men once happy? Have we pined
1425,XV,Forever? Can our spirits e'er be calmed;
1426,XV,Or _is_ the spirit only pain embalmed?
1427,XV,
1428,XV,
1429,XVI,XVI
1430,XVI,
1431,XVI,"But what of art? Can art no solace hold,"
1432,XVI,"No soothing spikenard, soporose drug or wine"
1433,XVI,To woo the wounded soul? Must men grow old
1434,XVI,In agony? Or has some thought divine
1435,XVI,"Slipped down upon us, cool, compassionate?"
1436,XVI,But what of art? Can art's frail power refine
1437,XVI,"Our souls into that Oversoul, and mate"
1438,XVI,"The each with All in one, sublime design?"
1439,XVI,Art is the vision of that Truth innate
1440,XVI,"In man. A soul, prismatic, crystalline,"
1441,XVI,May show each glow of being with each strife
1442,XVI,"At once reflected and becalmed, and twine"
1443,XVI,"Then into some new, inward world all rife"
1444,XVI,With spirit blisses of a spirit life.

1449,XVII,Eternal art can triumph over pain;
1450,XVII,"And once we breathe the lotus-fragrance deep,"
1451,XVII,"The world may scream with iron tongue in vain,"
1452,XVII,For all the argosy is soothed to sleep.
1453,XVII,The ships may rot forever on the sand;
1454,XVII,And far off Greece may wait and faintly weep.
1455,XVII,"More rare than spice from silken Samarkand,"
1456,XVII,"More sorrow-sweet than young Francesca's tears,"
1457,XVII,"More fair than yearning night upon the strand,"
1458,XVII,And more majestic than Anchises' years:
1459,XVII,"Beauty's the image, not the thing. 'Tis shod"
1460,XVII,"With rainbow lightnings of the hopes and fears,"
1461,XVII,And knows each step humanity may plod.
1462,XVII,Art is the Beauty of the face of God.
1463,XVII,
1464,XVII,
1465,XVIII,XVIII
1466,XVIII,
1467,XVIII,But still I live within this place of pain;
1468,XVIII,"And still I seek for an eternal aim,"
1469,XVIII,"For, after death, mere Beauty is in vain."
1470,XVIII,What is there deeper flowing from this same
1471,XVIII,"Unceasing spring? Quick, let me tear the veil!"
1472,XVIII,There sat a statue on an ebon frame--
1473,XVIII,A statue in that house of pain. So pale
1474,XVIII,"The brow and still the nostrils, Death it seemed;"
1475,XVIII,"But in the face, I read that holy tale"
1476,XVIII,That lay on the Madonna's face where gleamed
1477,XVIII,The Heavenly light from the young Christ's aureole.
1478,XVIII,"Through all the halls of pain, the brilliance beamed;"
1479,XVIII,And every discord out of chaos stole
1480,XVIII,To swell the throbbing organ's thunderous roll.
1481,XVIII,
1482,XVIII,

1485,XIX,Faith is the master-spirit of the mind.
1486,XIX,"All else is vanity, the preacher saith;"
1487,XIX,And worldly knowledge painful is and blind.
1488,XIX,"Oh, be thyself, and trust thyself. The breath"
1489,XIX,"Of God is breathed on thee. Believe, and will;"
1490,XIX,"And all that thou wouldst have in life, in death,"
1491,XIX,Is thine. I heard a rustling like a rill
1492,XIX,Upon its leafy bed--just such a sound
1493,XIX,As tincts the shadow of a song with skill
1494,XIX,"More intricate than arabesques, and bound"
1495,XIX,"With tender, faintly-flowing melodies--"
1496,XIX,"But whence the choir sang, I never found."
1497,XIX,"Mayhap at last, myself may learn the ties"
1498,XIX,Wherewith are bound those lingering harmonies.

1505,XX,When echo-like upon the air I sail
1506,XX,"Whither the wingèd skylark, Faith, has flown,"
1507,XX,And borne me fainting upward; then my soul
1508,XX,"May seek the God of art which silent, lone,"
1509,XX,"Broods on a crystal-argent sea, the goal"
1510,XX,Of all humanity. Incarnate pain
1511,XX,Is calmed to everlasting peace. There roll
1512,XX,No waves upon the sea. Charmed has it lain
1513,XX,Through incommensurate time; charmed will it lie
1514,XX,Through all eternity; and there again
1515,XX,"Upon my soul in silence wrapped, shall sigh,"
1516,XX,Most beautiful--a mother's lullaby.
