50,I,
51,I,"(October, 1504)"
52,I,
53,I,_[Someone sings in the street below]_
54,I,
55,I,"Fair-fleeting Youth must snatch at happiness,"
56,I,
57,I,"He knows not if To-morrow curse or bless,"
58,I,
59,I,Nor round what bend upon his travel-way
60,I,
61,I,The bandit Death lurks armed--of Yesterday
62,I,
63,I,His palely featured griefs he knows too well;
64,I,
65,I,"Therefore with jests To-day, come Heaven, come Hell,"
66,I,
67,I,He plucks with either hand what joys he may.
68,I,
69,I,
70,I,
71,I,Joy is a flower
72,I,
73,I,"White-leafd or red,"
74,I,
75,I,None knows which colour
76,I,
77,I,Till it is dead:
78,I,
79,I,White gives forth fragrance
80,I,
81,I,Pure as God's breath;
82,I,
83,I,Red in its dying
84,I,
85,I,Yields the gatherer death.
86,I,
87,I,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_
88,I,
89,I,"So 'tis Lorenzo's song they sing to-night,"
90,I,
91,I,That haunting song which long years since he sang
92,I,
93,I,"When, with his gallants through the torch-"
94,I,
95,I,"smirched dusk,"
96,I,
97,I,"He laughing rode toward the Carnival,"
98,I,
99,I,And young girls loosened all abroad their hair
100,I,
101,I,"And flung up petals through the cool moonlight,"
102,I,
103,I,"Some of which falling rested on his face,"
104,I,
105,I,Some of which falling covered up his eyes;
106,I,
107,I,And girls there were who kissed his drooping
108,I,
109,I,hands
110,I,
111,I,"And clasped his stirrups, begging him to stay,"
112,I,
113,I,"To halt one little moment, stay with them:"
114,I,
115,I,"_""Life is so short. Delay with us a while.""_"
116,I,
117,I,"But he rode on, and sang of joy and love."
118,I,
119,I,
120,I,
121,I,Lorenzo il Magnifico is dead;
122,I,
123,I,"His lips are silent, and he now could halt"
124,I,
125,I,"Oh, endlessly, if one of those fair maids"
126,I,
127,I,Should come to him imploring him to stay.
128,I,
129,I,For twelve slow years within the sacristy
130,I,
131,I,"Of San Lorenzo he has never waked,"
132,I,
133,I,But has the rest he could not find in life--
134,I,
135,I,"Ungrateful now, because postponed too long."
136,I,
137,I,If one should steal to him from out the past
138,I,
139,I,"And bending down should whisper low his name,"
140,I,
141,I,"He would not hearken. True, she would be old,"
142,I,
143,I,As are all maids of that spent gala-night;
144,I,
145,I,"So, if he heard her, he would only smile,"
146,I,
147,I,For he loved only beauty in his day.
148,I,
149,I,
150,II,II
151,II,
152,II,_[ Someone sings in the street below]_
153,II,
154,II,"Fair-fleeting Youth wends ever to the West,"
155,II,
156,II,"He, like the sun, too soon must sink to rest."
157,II,
158,II,"Stars of Remorse, fast-following on his track,"
159,II,
160,II,"Moon of Old-Age, can nothing turn ye back f"
161,II,
162,II,"Ah, soon the golden Day'll have spent his breath!"
163,II,
164,II,"Then comes the drear, eventless Night of Death"
165,II,
166,II,"When Youth, no longer young, all joys must lack."
167,II,
168,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_
169,II,
170,II,"""Then comes the drear, eventless Night of Death!"""
171,II,
172,II,
173,II,"'Tis true, for who in Tuscany to-day"
174,II,
175,II,Dares breathe the Medicean name aloud?
176,II,
177,II,"When a man dies, the watchers by the bed"
178,II,
179,II,"Close down his eye-lids, so is he once dead;"
180,II,
181,II,Twice dead is he whose mem'ry men dang down
182,II,
183,II,To dark oblivion when his soul is fled.
184,II,
185,II,"Florence forgets her singer, but his song"
186,II,
187,II,"Still echoes through her streets on autumn nights,"
188,II,
189,II,"And pausing at the door of some old friend,"
190,II,
191,II,Bids him remember all the hope he had
192,II,
193,II,"In spacious days, before Lorenzo died . . ."
194,II,
195,II,
196,II,
197,II,It seems Lorenzo's soul crept back to earth
198,II,
199,II,"Re-seeking Joy he coveted in life,"
200,II,
201,II,Seeking the happiness he never found.
202,II,
203,II,"Yet, was his labour lost? Did he not find?"
204,II,
205,II,He sang one song which lingers in men's hearts
206,II,
207,II,"And, having sung, he surely solved his quest."
208,II,
209,II,"Who of Joy's seekers finds the flower itself,"
210,II,
211,II,"And plucking, knows the snow-white from the red?"
212,II,
213,II,"Not I, for I've been truant in my search;"
214,II,
215,II,I've pluck't the mauve of Honour and the green
216,II,
217,II,"Of cloistered Knowledge, yellow of Romance,"
218,II,
219,II,"The blue which feigns a deep Tranquillity,"
220,II,
221,II,"Scarlet of Boldness, purple of Despair,"
222,II,
223,II,"Orange of Idleness which flaunts the sun,"
224,II,
225,II,And indigo of wizard Heresy--
226,II,
227,II,And gray which gives to Weariness unrest.
228,II,
229,II,Perchance I've clutched within this eager hand
230,II,
231,II,The Death of Joy--the fatal flower of blood.
232,II,
233,II,"I know not. This I know, I have not trod"
234,II,
235,II,The quiet vale where grows the flower of white.
236,II,
237,II,
238,II,
239,II,Like an unwise distiller of perfume
240,II,
241,II,"I've blended each new fragrance as it came,"
242,II,
243,II,Made something perfect for a day--two days;
244,II,
245,II,Then ruined all by adding something fresh.
246,II,
247,II,"First I would be a scholar, so I learned"
248,II,
249,II,"Latin and Greek, and Mathematic Law."
250,II,
251,II,"Then I would be a poet, so I wrote"
252,II,
253,II,"""Chi non puô quel che vuol, quel che puo voglia;"
254,II,
255,II,Che quel che non si puô folle è volere.
256,II,
257,II,"Adunque saggio l'uomo è da tenere,"
258,II,
259,II,"Che da quel che non puô sua vogler toglia."""
260,II,
261,II,"I could not live the wisdom which I taught,"
262,II,
263,II,So I must be a master of design
264,II,
265,II,"And studied sculpture with Verocchio,"
266,II,
267,II,Verocchio who had his dusty shop
268,II,
269,II,On Amo's banks in grand Lorenzo's time.
270,II,
271,II,"Thither, while yet a boy, I did resort"
272,II,
273,II,And out of terra-cotta caused to smile
274,II,
275,II,"Women whose beauty ne'er hath been surpassed,"
276,II,
277,II,Nor equalled in the flesh for Man's delight.
278,II,
279,II,
280,II,
281,II,"Still not content, I'd be an architect"
282,II,
283,II,"And renovate this battered world for God,"
284,II,
285,II,"Hurling across steep valleys, mile on mile"
286,II,
287,II,"Through cloudland, spans of marble aqueduct;"
288,II,
289,II,Leading chained rivers from the mountain-heights
290,II,
291,II,"Down to the plains where men are wont to toil,"
292,II,
293,II,"There I would cause these Samsons of the crags,"
294,II,
295,II,"Scenting the sea, whose waves are unconfined,"
296,II,
297,II,"To shake themselves as once at other times,"
298,II,
299,II,And rush in frenzy forward turning mills.
300,II,
301,II,So would each city echo to the hum
302,II,
303,II,"Of loom, and web, and swift-revolving wheels."
304,II,
305,II,"Then, when prosperity had reached its height"
306,II,
307,II,"And merhants cavilled at each other's gains,"
308,II,
309,II,I'd frame for them the iron beasts of war
310,II,
311,II,And hound than on to harry and destroy--
312,II,
313,II,"And when our world was fallen, who but I,"
314,II,
315,II,"Da Vinci, should stand forth to raise it up?"
316,II,
317,II,These were my dreams; I thought myself divine--
318,II,
319,II,"All this was long ago, when I was young."
320,II,
321,II,
322,II,
323,II,"Next I would make me wings, and I would fly"
324,II,
325,II,"As do the morning birds straight t'ward the sun,"
326,II,
327,II,"Piercing the mists, rise far above the clouds"
328,II,
329,II,To seek out where God walks and whom He loves.
330,II,
331,II,"I made me wings, but had not strength to fly."
332,II,
333,II,"Still discontent and tethered to this world,"
334,II,
335,II,"I strove to wrench the secret out of Life,"
336,II,
337,II,And swept the far horizon of the stars
338,II,
339,II,"If there, at least, I might discern some sign"
340,II,
341,II,"To tell me whence souls come, to where depart."
342,II,
343,II,"I, in my overhaste, pursued too far,"
344,II,
345,II,Seeking that vague and fabled Paradise
346,II,
347,II,"Where Adam and his many sons sing chaunts,"
348,II,
349,II,While Eve walks through them pale and deified.
350,II,
351,II,"I missed my track in pathless swamps of Time,"
352,II,
353,II,"I chilled my hands against the cold-dead stars,"
354,II,
355,II,"And lost my mind in unremembered Past,"
356,II,
357,II,Remote from God and out of human sight.
358,II,
359,II,"Lastly I took to painting down my thoughts,"
360,II,
361,II,And pictured for the King of Portugal
362,II,
363,II,"That fatal meadow in the Eden Land,"
364,II,
365,II,Where Man's first sweet and deadly sin was
366,II,
367,II,wrought.
368,II,
369,II,"I, in this art, all others did excel;"
370,II,
371,II,Yet with success I was not satisfied
372,II,
373,II,But hourly craved for the impossible--
374,II,
375,II,To fashion men as real as flesh and blood.
376,II,
377,II,To-day I'd toil with fire in my brain
378,II,
379,II,"And paint away the faults of yesterday,"
380,II,
381,II,"And shadow forth the dreams of yesternight,"
382,II,
383,II,And so on through long months and weary years
384,II,
385,II,"Till, losing heart, I'd toss my brush aside"
386,II,
387,II,Leaving the thing unfinished as it was--
388,II,
389,II,Adding this broken promise to my last.
390,II,
391,II,
392,II,
393,II,"There's Raphael with his wide unanxious eyes,"
394,II,
395,II,He does his work as though it were his play;
396,II,
397,II,"He never talks of fame, but sings the while"
398,II,
399,II,He paints the Virgin with Lord Jesus Christ--
400,II,
401,II,"Goes to the door, throws kisses to a child,"
402,II,
403,II,"Goes to the window, smiles to some slim girl,"
404,II,
405,II,And so returns and flashes kiss and smile
406,II,
407,II,"Into the canvas quaking 'neath his brush,"
408,II,
409,II,Creating thus a masterpiece sublime.
410,II,
411,II,And then there's surly Michelangelo
412,II,
413,II,"Who chisels _Davids_ through the death-long night,"
414,II,
415,II,And paints _Last Judgments_ through the livelong
416,II,
417,II,"day,"
418,II,
419,II,"Pantingly running, pace on pace with Fame,"
420,II,
421,II,Racing dean-limbed toward his goal in life.
422,II,
423,II,
424,II,
425,II,"But I, poor changeling, wake, and dream, and"
426,II,
427,II,"wake,"
428,II,
429,II,"And dream again, retarded by desire."
430,II,
431,II,I was eight years in painting at Milan
432,II,
433,II,A fresco for the monks of Dominic--
434,II,
435,II,And even this I hear's begun to fade;
436,II,
437,II,It was a picture of that sacred feast
438,II,
439,II,Our Saviour gave before he went to die.
440,II,
441,II,Ten years I laboured on the Sforza horse
442,II,
443,II,Which should have been my monument through
444,II,
445,II,Time.
446,II,
447,II,"I built it huge and true in every line,"
448,II,
449,II,"Studied anatomy to make it strong,"
450,II,
451,II,And set on top Francesco with his sword;
452,II,
453,II,"But, when the time for casting had arrived"
454,II,
455,II,"And I had done one perfect work at last,"
456,II,
457,II,"The hungry French across the border came,"
458,II,
459,II,"Bringing their Gascons, who got drunk and shot"
460,II,
461,II,The clay of my poor Titan into space.
462,II,
463,II,
464,II,
465,II,So were ten years of strenuous effort lost;
466,II,
467,II,And now I'm painting Mona Lisa's face . . .
468,II,
469,II,
470,II,_[Someone sings in the street below]_
471,II,
472,II,"Seize then thy gladness ere it turns to dust,"
473,II,
474,II,"Youth can make all acts lovely, all deeds just;"
475,II,
476,II,"Heed not the tyrant, lean Morality,"
477,II,
478,II,"But steer thy passion down to the purple sea,"
479,II,
480,II,Through winding hills where Beauty hath her home
481,II,
482,II,"And calls to travellers, until thou come"
483,II,
484,II,Unto the Deep of Lovés Satiety.
485,II,
486,II,
487,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_
488,II,
489,II,
490,II,
491,II,"Ha-ha, my passion to the purple sea!"
492,II,
493,II,"And yet, I'd go if Mona Lisa'd come."
494,II,
495,II,"We two, close-seated in one crimson boat"
496,II,
497,II,"Would drift the yellow waters of Romance,"
498,II,
499,II,Glide down its stream through hills of mystery
500,II,
501,II,"Where Beauty roams, of which the song hath"
502,II,
503,II,"sung,"
504,II,
505,II,Nor ever speak of where that tide should end.
506,II,
507,II,"We'd dip no oars, we'd set no hurrying sail,"
508,II,
509,II,But swept on the full current of desire
510,II,
511,II,"Would steer our course with unimpeded hands,"
512,II,
513,II,Watching the pleasure in each other's eyes.
514,II,
515,II,"Ah well, 'tis vain to talk! Two-thirds of life"
516,II,
517,II,Till now I've spent in spotless purity--
518,II,
519,II,Affection's been retarded by desire
520,II,
521,II,As has my work; my dreams have far excelled
522,II,
523,II,The beauty God moulds into human shape.
524,II,
525,II,The sweet perfection of the womankind
526,II,
527,II,"Who haunt my brain, has held me back from love."
528,II,
529,II,This . . . this was so till Mona Lisa came.
530,II,
531,II,
532,II,
533,II,"Four years I've painted when it was her day,"
534,II,
535,II,"A day of mist, of mingled rain and sun;"
536,II,
537,II,Four years before me silently she's sat
538,II,
539,II,And smiled to see me strive to catch her smile
540,II,
541,II,"In liquid paint, with canvas and with brush,"
542,II,
543,II,"So that her eyes, searching, inscrutable,"
544,II,
545,II,May question her sons' sons when she is dust.
546,II,
547,II,I only just begin to know her face.
548,II,
549,II,To learn its sudden changes I have paid
550,II,
551,II,"The skill'dest men in all our Tuscan vales,"
552,II,
553,II,"Harpists, lute-players, masters of the viol,"
554,II,
555,II,To make soft music while on her I gaze.
556,II,
557,II,For her content I ordered to be made
558,II,
559,II,A fountain in the courtyard of my house
560,II,
561,II,"Whose waters falling, ere they dash to spray,"
562,II,
563,II,"Smite on smooth spheres, which thus revolve and"
564,II,
565,II,hum
566,II,
567,II,The chaunt the winds toll in our upland pines.
568,II,
569,II,About the fountain's brink I caused to plant
570,II,
571,II,"Pale iris roots and dew-blanched narcissi,"
572,II,
573,II,Since white's the flower which most of all she loves.
574,II,
575,II,"Also about the pillars, where the sun"
576,II,
577,II,"Lengthens the shadows when the evening fades,"
578,II,
579,II,I've sculptured . . .
580,II,
581,II,
582,II,_[Someone sings in the street below]_
583,II,
584,II,Passion's a flower
585,II,
586,II,While-leaf d or red--
587,II,
588,II,None knows which colour
589,II,
590,II,Till it is dead;
591,II,
592,II,Love gives forth fragrance
593,II,
594,II,Pure as God's breath;
595,II,
596,II,Lust in Us dying
597,II,
598,II,Yields the gatherer death.
599,II,
600,II,
601,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_
602,II,
603,II,
604,II,
605,II,And had Lorenzo sung those words to me
606,II,
607,II,His voice had had no more familiar sound;
608,II,
609,II,Had he turned back from lordly Paradise

645,II,
646,II,"There, over there! Beneath Piero's wall."
647,II,
648,II,Hath Pagan Plato triumphed over Christ
649,II,
650,II,And sent his chief apostle back to us?
651,II,
652,II,Or hath Lord Christ in his compassion wrought
653,II,
654,II,"That kindness Dives craved of Abraham,"
655,II,
656,II,Sending Lorenzo here from off his breast
657,II,

659,II,
660,II,"No . . . no, the moon shines through and makes"
661,II,
662,II,all plain.
663,II,
664,II,This is some old Florentine Lazarus--
665,II,
666,II,A soldier crippled in our Pisan wars
667,II,

675,II,

677,II,

679,II,
680,II,"And yet methought that, when he turned to go,"
681,II,
682,II,"His face looked upward, so it caught the light;"

689,II,
690,II,

692,II,
693,II,I'll think no more of spirits and of ghosts;
694,II,
695,II,Let the dead past go bury up its dead.
696,II,
697,II,I'll think of Mona Lisa's face alone . . .
698,II,
699,II,
700,II,
701,II,_Of Mona Lisa's face.
702,II,
703,II,
704,II,
705,II,Just now I said
706,II,
707,II,"One thing I knew, that I had never trod"
708,II,
709,II,The quiet vale where grows the flower of white.
710,II,
711,II,'Twas false. Four years I've lived and wandered
712,II,
713,II,there
714,II,
715,II,"And seen my flower, but feared to break its stem."
716,II,
717,II,"Dear God, thou knowest how often I have prayed"
718,II,
719,II,That this temptation might not make me fall--
720,II,
721,II,"Yea, I have asked for death's deliverance."
722,II,
723,II,"Is this thy answer, that it is no sin"
724,II,
725,II,For men to gather that which most they love?
726,II,
727,II,So be it. Silence answers every prayer;
728,II,
729,II,Thy voice hath spoken--I am satisfied.
730,II,
731,II,
732,II,
733,II,"Men say in Florence, while I watched her face,"
734,II,
735,II,"That I bewitched her, so her very eyes"
736,II,
737,II,"Grew in expression like unto my own,"
738,II,
739,II,"So that her hands took on my restless ways,"
740,II,
741,II,So that her mouth hath altered in its smile
742,II,
743,II,"And, when I paint her face, I paint my own."
744,II,
745,II,Then let that be God's answer to my prayer.
746,II,
747,II,
748,II,
749,II,"Ah, she is like me, she is very like!"
750,II,
751,II,God made her for the sister of my soul;
752,II,
753,II,He would not have His plans jerked out of joint
754,II,
755,II,"By one mistake, because she chanced to wed"
756,II,
757,II,Her bankrupt father's sternest creditor
758,II,
759,II,"To save his name--and this, some years ago;"
760,II,
761,II,Therefore He sent His singer here to-night
762,II,
763,II,"That he, in words I loved, might tell me so."
764,II,
765,II,Certainly God is good and very great.
766,II,
767,II,
768,II,"'Tis said her husband hath returned this night,"
769,II,
770,II,Passing at sundown through the southern gate
771,II,
772,II,"From Naples, where last spring he went to sell"
773,II,
774,II,Certain Sicilian cattle which he had.
775,II,
776,II,"(He sold, I'll warrant, at the highest price),"
777,II,
778,II,"So, if the husband's come, then _she_ is home."
779,II,
780,II,
781,II,
782,II,"That day she left me, 'twas an April day,"
783,II,
784,II,"One of her days of mingled mist and sun,"
785,II,
786,II,I well remember how she paused and gazed
787,II,
788,II,"Full in my eyes, as if forbidden love"
789,II,
790,II,Were vainly seeking words which shame denied;
791,II,
792,II,"Then suddenly she stooped, and her lips brushed"
793,II,
794,II,"My forehead. God gave gentle words ; she prayed,"
795,II,
796,II,"""May the Christ-Mother have you in her care""--"
797,II,
798,II,"Nothing besides. Passionately I rose up,"
799,II,
800,II,Willing for her sake to be crucified;
801,II,
802,II,Stretched forth my arms to snatch her to my
803,II,
804,II,"breast,"
805,II,
806,II,And found her gone--the courtyard filled with sun.
807,II,
808,II,Six months have passed since then--six tortured
809,II,
810,II,months!
811,II,
812,II,"There hangs her portrait, it has felt no brush"
813,II,
814,II,Since on that April mom she went away;
815,II,
816,II,"And now the empty courtyard's filled with night,"
817,II,
818,II,And back to Florence Mona Lisa's come.
819,II,
820,II,
821,II,
822,II,"To-morrow I will go to her and say,"
823,II,
824,II,"""Lisa, here take my life for it is yours."
825,II,
826,II,Do with it as you will; but do not stay
827,II,
828,II,"To add, subtract, and reckon up its cost."
829,II,
830,II,"Act a brave part and, if your love's like mine,"
831,II,
832,II,"We need not fear; for what we lose we gain,"
833,II,
834,II,"And, though we gain much, still to-day's to-day"
835,II,
836,II,"And, while we tarry, one day's love is lost."""
837,II,
838,II,
839,II,
840,II,"Ah, would that I might speak those words to-night"
841,II,
842,II,"For, while I halt, another night is gone--"
843,II,
844,II,Crush'd to a mem'ry 'neath the heel of Time.
845,II,
846,II,"I'm minded even now to venture forth,"
847,II,
848,II,"To go to her, although the hour is late;"
849,II,
850,II,"And through the darkness, when she hears me call,"
851,II,
852,II,"Only to say to her this one word, ""_Come_."""
853,II,
854,II,"Thus unto men speak Birth, Fate, Love and Death,"
855,II,
856,II,The four great captains of this brief campaign;
857,II,
858,II,"Casting a shadow at the soul's tent-door,"
859,II,
860,II,"Each in his turn beckons and whispers, ""_Come_."""
861,II,
862,II,"And I to her am Death, Birth, Love and Fate;"
863,II,
864,II,"And she to me is Love, and only Love."
865,II,
866,II,I'll go to her. How can I longer wait?
867,II,
868,II,Her nearer presence sets my blood aflame;

884,II,
885,II,We burn not if To-morrow curse or Hess.
886,II,
887,II,"Who cares--one red bud more, one white bud less?"
888,II,
889,II,"Only we burn that love was meant to spend,"
890,II,
891,II,"And this we burn, that each life hath its end;"
892,II,

935,II,"Learning their beauty, where mine own lips touch;"

954,II,
955,II,Seizing with warrior-hands their Joy at once.
956,II,
957,II,"And love in life is everything to us,"
958,II,
959,II,And I have failed because I have not loved.

1297,A BRAVE LIFE,
1298,A BRAVE LIFE,"The doubtful darkness of the starless night,"
1299,A BRAVE LIFE,
1300,A BRAVE LIFE,And fear lest he should never see the sight

1303,A BRAVE LIFE,
1304,A BRAVE LIFE,Brave offspring of a disenchanted age
1305,A BRAVE LIFE,

2373,_A ROMANCE_,Through pleasant valleys and dew-drenched woods

2380,_A ROMANCE_,
2381,_A ROMANCE_,At night they stole to the dty-wall

2385,_A ROMANCE_,"And hearkened for noise of warlike din,"
2386,_A ROMANCE_,
2387,_A ROMANCE_,And found no breath of strife within;
2388,_A ROMANCE_,
2389,_A ROMANCE_,"And watched for lights in the houses' eyes,"

2440,_A ROMANCE_,
2441,_A ROMANCE_,Swiftly they ran from tree to tree

2669,_A ROMANCE_,With hurried feet they clomb the stair
2670,_A ROMANCE_,
2671,_A ROMANCE_,"And quickly gained the outer air,"
2672,_A ROMANCE_,
2673,_A ROMANCE_,And ghostly saw through the morning haze
2674,_A ROMANCE_,
2675,_A ROMANCE_,The winding funeral arrays
2676,_A ROMANCE_,
2677,_A ROMANCE_,Of Ugo's knights and warrior-men.
2678,_A ROMANCE_,
2679,_A ROMANCE_,"Dumbly they watched, and heard often"
2680,_A ROMANCE_,
2681,_A ROMANCE_,Their hunting cry borne down the breeze.
2682,_A ROMANCE_,
2683,_A ROMANCE_,"Corrado laughed with an ugly ease,"
2684,_A ROMANCE_,
2685,_A ROMANCE_,And thus it is he comes with these:
2686,_A ROMANCE_,
2687,_A ROMANCE_,"Strong stallions, lances, Genoese--"
2688,_A ROMANCE_,

2700,_A ROMANCE_,
2701,_A ROMANCE_,
2702,_A ROMANCE_,
2703,_A ROMANCE_,Down on the stones they kneeled to pray
2704,_A ROMANCE_,
2705,_A ROMANCE_,That He who brought their lives to be
2706,_A ROMANCE_,
2707,_A ROMANCE_,Should crown their loves with victory.
2708,_A ROMANCE_,
2709,_A ROMANCE_,They rose and flew their heraldry:
2710,_A ROMANCE_,
2711,_A ROMANCE_,"An evening star, a saffron sea,"
2712,_A ROMANCE_,
2713,_A ROMANCE_,"And on the sea, the star below,"
2714,_A ROMANCE_,
2715,_A ROMANCE_,The dry-shod pard of Reggio.

2718,_A ROMANCE_,
2719,_A ROMANCE_,"No answer made the sable foe,"
2720,_A ROMANCE_,
2721,_A ROMANCE_,"But round the tower, with footsteps slow,"
2722,_A ROMANCE_,
2723,_A ROMANCE_,Paced till his journeys numbered three;
2724,_A ROMANCE_,
2725,_A ROMANCE_,"Then from the host one silently,"
2726,_A ROMANCE_,
2727,_A ROMANCE_,"Thrust on a spear for mockery,"
2728,_A ROMANCE_,
2729,_A ROMANCE_,And raised the head of Abramo.
2730,_A ROMANCE_,
2731,_A ROMANCE_,Swift round the tower in mirthless rout
2732,_A ROMANCE_,
2733,_A ROMANCE_,"They raced and tossed the words about,"
2734,_A ROMANCE_,
2735,_A ROMANCE_,"_""Bianca of the yellow hair,"

2747,_A ROMANCE_,"Of armoured strength her maiden heart,"
2748,_A ROMANCE_,
2749,_A ROMANCE_,So that with them she might depart

2754,_A ROMANCE_,
2755,_A ROMANCE_,"Bianca, in the vault below,"
2756,_A ROMANCE_,

2791,_A ROMANCE_,"And hid her lips in a yellow tress,"
2792,_A ROMANCE_,
2793,_A ROMANCE_,"And kissed the breasts where they met the dress,"
2794,_A ROMANCE_,
2795,_A ROMANCE_,And laid her cheek on the weary face
2796,_A ROMANCE_,
2797,_A ROMANCE_,"To wipe away each tear's distress,"
2798,_A ROMANCE_,
2799,_A ROMANCE_,To cleanse of grief each grievous place.

2836,_A ROMANCE_,
2837,_A ROMANCE_,The sun sank bloody in the West;
2838,_A ROMANCE_,
2839,_A ROMANCE_,The day died bitter and unblest.
2840,_A ROMANCE_,
2841,_A ROMANCE_,The mountains strained against the sky
2842,_A ROMANCE_,
2843,_A ROMANCE_,"And angrily, as they would try"
2844,_A ROMANCE_,
2845,_A ROMANCE_,To wrench from earth their trampled gowns.
2846,_A ROMANCE_,
2847,_A ROMANCE_,An eagle o'er the upland downs

2854,_A ROMANCE_,
2855,_A ROMANCE_,"A spearman, whom they counted dead,"

2861,_A ROMANCE_,"Ciro, who from the tower's height"
2862,_A ROMANCE_,
2863,_A ROMANCE_,Leaned out to watch the evening light.

2870,_A ROMANCE_,
2871,_A ROMANCE_,And thought of how her yellow hair
2872,_A ROMANCE_,
2873,_A ROMANCE_,"Could save the three, if she should dare"
2874,_A ROMANCE_,
2875,_A ROMANCE_,To yield herself to Rimini.

2883,_A ROMANCE_,"By night--this night if I should go,"

2888,_A ROMANCE_,
2889,_A ROMANCE_,The last bend in the stair she turned
2890,_A ROMANCE_,
2891,_A ROMANCE_,"And halted as she gained the roof,"
2892,_A ROMANCE_,
2893,_A ROMANCE_,And stretched her gaze abroad for proof
2894,_A ROMANCE_,
2895,_A ROMANCE_,Of where her lover might keep guard.
2896,_A ROMANCE_,
2897,_A ROMANCE_,"There, where a shafted moonbeam barred"
2898,_A ROMANCE_,
2899,_A ROMANCE_,"An alcove of gray masonry,"
2900,_A ROMANCE_,
2901,_A ROMANCE_,"His face shone out, so tranquilly"
2902,_A ROMANCE_,
2903,_A ROMANCE_,She thought him sleeping; but his eyes
2904,_A ROMANCE_,
2905,_A ROMANCE_,"Were wide, intent on her and wise"
2906,_A ROMANCE_,
2907,_A ROMANCE_,Beyond the sight of living men.
2908,_A ROMANCE_,
2909,_A ROMANCE_,"Softly she called to him and, when"

2911,_A ROMANCE_,"He answered not, 'twas then she knew. . ."
2912,_A ROMANCE_,
2913,_A ROMANCE_,"She kissed his forehead, and withdrew"
2914,_A ROMANCE_,
2915,_A ROMANCE_,Her tired feet adown the stair.
2916,_A ROMANCE_,
2917,_A ROMANCE_,Bianca kneeled entranced in prayer
2918,_A ROMANCE_,
2919,_A ROMANCE_,"And noticed not her passing by,"
2920,_A ROMANCE_,
2921,_A ROMANCE_,But counted fast her rosaRy.

2923,_A ROMANCE_,"Corrado, touched upon the arm,"
2924,_A ROMANCE_,
2925,_A ROMANCE_,Reeled as he turned in fierce alarm.
2926,_A ROMANCE_,
2927,_A ROMANCE_,"She said, ""We change the watch this hour."
2928,_A ROMANCE_,
2929,_A ROMANCE_,"I will abide; guard you the tower."""

2933,_A ROMANCE_,"Kiss me, dear friend, for you must know"
2934,_A ROMANCE_,
2935,_A ROMANCE_,"We may not ever meet again,"

2938,_A ROMANCE_,
2939,_A ROMANCE_,"He gazed on her a tender while,"
2940,_A ROMANCE_,
2941,_A ROMANCE_,And wondered at the gracious smile
2942,_A ROMANCE_,
2943,_A ROMANCE_,"Around her lips. ""While we are four,"""
2944,_A ROMANCE_,
2945,_A ROMANCE_,"He said, ""we need not fear this war;"

2949,_A ROMANCE_,"She answered, ""Not while we are four."""

2952,_A ROMANCE_,
2953,_A ROMANCE_,"""She prays for us, see how her head"
2954,_A ROMANCE_,
2955,_A ROMANCE_,"Is bowed in reverence to God."""
2956,_A ROMANCE_,
2957,_A ROMANCE_,He took his sword and clanking trod
2958,_A ROMANCE_,
2959,_A ROMANCE_,"The stone-paved vault and winding stair,"
2960,_A ROMANCE_,
2961,_A ROMANCE_,Till she could judge him mounting where
2962,_A ROMANCE_,
2963,_A ROMANCE_,Another turn would bring to sight
2964,_A ROMANCE_,
2965,_A ROMANCE_,Her dead love's face in the shafted light
2966,_A ROMANCE_,
2967,_A ROMANCE_,Where the moonbeam washed the turret white.
2968,_A ROMANCE_,
2969,_A ROMANCE_,"She bared her feet and crept the floor,"
2970,_A ROMANCE_,
2971,_A ROMANCE_,"With eager hands wrenched loose the door,"
2972,_A ROMANCE_,
2973,_A ROMANCE_,And weeping passed into the night.
2974,_A ROMANCE_,
2975,_A ROMANCE_,The dawn thrust up a wild white face
2976,_A ROMANCE_,
2977,_A ROMANCE_,"And stared toward the lonely place,"
2978,_A ROMANCE_,
2979,_A ROMANCE_,"Where through the vigil, hour by hour,"
2980,_A ROMANCE_,
2981,_A ROMANCE_,Corrado guarded well the tower.
2982,_A ROMANCE_,
2983,_A ROMANCE_,"It seemed his own reflected face,"
2984,_A ROMANCE_,
2985,_A ROMANCE_,So wannish and so wide of eye;
2986,_A ROMANCE_,
2987,_A ROMANCE_,"The lips moved and he caught their sigh,"
2988,_A ROMANCE_,
2989,_A ROMANCE_,"I am thyself and I must die."""
2990,_A ROMANCE_,
2991,_A ROMANCE_,"Thus did he learn the uttermost,"
2992,_A ROMANCE_,
2993,_A ROMANCE_,"The live man meeting his own ghost,"
2994,_A ROMANCE_,
2995,_A ROMANCE_,And knew that surely he must die.
2996,_A ROMANCE_,
2997,_A ROMANCE_,The sun flashed up; the face was fled.
2998,_A ROMANCE_,
2999,_A ROMANCE_,By night he knew he must be dead.
3000,_A ROMANCE_,
3001,_A ROMANCE_,He leaned beyond the parapet
3002,_A ROMANCE_,
3003,_A ROMANCE_,To scan the rocky pass if yet
3004,_A ROMANCE_,
3005,_A ROMANCE_,Some help might wind around the hill.
3006,_A ROMANCE_,
3007,_A ROMANCE_,The morning air was very still;
3008,_A ROMANCE_,
3009,_A ROMANCE_,"He heard the noise of climbing feet,"
3010,_A ROMANCE_,
3011,_A ROMANCE_,"Of something dragged across the peat,"
3012,_A ROMANCE_,
3013,_A ROMANCE_,"And saw two knights who, drawing near,"
3014,_A ROMANCE_,
3015,_A ROMANCE_,Bore that which clogged his heart with fear--
3016,_A ROMANCE_,
3017,_A ROMANCE_,"A white gown, sown with golden threads"
3018,_A ROMANCE_,
3019,_A ROMANCE_,Which held the light as do the meads
3020,_A ROMANCE_,
3021,_A ROMANCE_,When dandelions toss their heads
3022,_A ROMANCE_,
3023,_A ROMANCE_,"Mid meadow-sweet and field-clover,"
3024,_A ROMANCE_,
3025,_A ROMANCE_,Which poppy-leaves drift red over--
3026,_A ROMANCE_,
3027,_A ROMANCE_,"A long white gown and smirched with red,"
3028,_A ROMANCE_,
3029,_A ROMANCE_,"And hands so still, they must be dead."
3030,_A ROMANCE_,
3031,_A ROMANCE_,They laid her on a grass-grown bank
3032,_A ROMANCE_,
3033,_A ROMANCE_,"And loosed about her neck the stole,"
3034,_A ROMANCE_,
3035,_A ROMANCE_,So that her gold hair round her sank
3036,_A ROMANCE_,
3037,_A ROMANCE_,To frame a burning aureole.-

3039,_A ROMANCE_,"How now, ye dogs of Rimini,"

3053,_A ROMANCE_,"No crime, Sir Knave. God's work, I trow."
3054,_A ROMANCE_,
3055,_A ROMANCE_,"Give us the witch, and we will go--"

3069,_A ROMANCE_,"To make things plain,"

3071,_A ROMANCE_,The black knight pitched his voice and said
3072,_A ROMANCE_,
3073,_A ROMANCE_,"And pointed, ""Ho sir, turn your head;"

3085,_A ROMANCE_,Where horsemen from their stallions leant
