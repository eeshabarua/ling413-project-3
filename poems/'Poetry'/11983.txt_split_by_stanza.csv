85,TO THE REVIEWERS.,TO THE REVIEWERS. 
86,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Oh, ye! enthron'd in presidential awe, To give the song-smit generation law; Who wield Apollo's delegated rod, And shake Parnassus with your sovereign nod; A pensive Pilgrim, worn with base turmoils, Plebian cares, and mercenary toils, Implores your pity, while with footsteps rude, He dares within the mountain's pale intrude; For, oh! enchantment through its empire dwells, And rules the spirit with Lethëan spells; By hands unseen aërial harps are hung, And Spring, like Hebe, ever fair and young, On her broad bosom rears the laughing loves, And breathes bland incense through the warbling groves; Spontaneous, bids unfading blossoms blow. And nectar'd streams mellifluously flow. There, while the Muses, wanton, unconfin'd, And wreaths resplendent round their temples bind, 'Tis yours, to strew their steps with votive flowers; To watch them slumbering midst the blissful bowers; To guard the shades that hide their sacred charms; And shield their beauties from unhallow'd arms! Oh! may their suppliant steal a passing kiss? Alas! he pants not for superior bliss; Thrice-bless'd, his virgin modesty shall be To snatch an evanescent ecstacy! The fierce extremes of superhuman love, For his frail sense too exquisite might prove; He turns, all blushing, from th'Aönian shade To humbler raptures, with a mortal maid. "
87,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"I know 'tis yours, when unscholastic wights Unloose their fancies in presumptuous flights, Awak'd to vengeance, on such flights to frown. Clip the wing'd horse, and roll his rider down. But, if empower'd to strike th'immortal lyre. The ardent vot'ry glows with genuine fire, 'Tis yours, while care recoils, and envy flies Subdued by his resistless energies, 'Tis yours to bid Piërian fountains flow, And toast his name in Wit's seraglio; To bind his brows with amaranthine bays, And bless, with beef and beer, his mundane days! Alas! nor beef, nor beer, nor bays are mine, If by your looks, my doom I may divine, Ye frown so dreadful, and ye swell so big Your fateful arms, the goosequill and the wig: The wig, with wisdom's somb'rous seal impress'd, Mysterious terrors, grim portents, invest; And shame and honor on the goosequill perch, Like doves and ravens on a country church. "
88,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"As some raw 'Squire, by rustic nymphs admir'd, Of vulgar charms, and easy conquests tir'd, Resolves new scenes and nobler flights to dare, Nor ""waste his sweetness in the desert air"", To town repairs, some fam'd assembly seeks, With red importance blust'ring in his cheeks; But when, electric on th'astonish'd wight Burst the full floods of music and of light, While levell'd mirrors multiply the rows Of radiant beauties, and accomplish'd beaus, At once confounded into sober sense, He feels his pristine insignificance; And blinking, blund'ring, from the general _quiz_ Retreats, ""to ponder on the thing he is."" By pride inflated, and by praise allur'd, Small Authors thus strut forth, and thus get cur'd; But, Critics, hear! an angel pleads for _me_, That tongueless, ten-tongued cherub, _Modesty_. "
89,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Sirs! if you damn me, you'll resemble those That flay'd the Travell'r, who had lost his clothes; Are there not foes enough to _do_ my books? Relentless trunk-makers, and pastry-cooks? Acknowledge not those barbarous allies, The wooden box-men, and the men of pies: For heav'n's sake, let it ne'er be understood That you, great Censors! coalesce with _wood_; Nor let your actions contradict your looks, That tell the world you ne'er colleague with _cooks_. "
90,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But, if the blithe muse will indulge a smile, Why scowls thy brow, O Bookseller! the while? Thy sunk eyes glisten through eclipsing fears, Fill'd, like Cassandra's, with prophetic tears: With such a visage, withering, woe-begone, Shrinks the pale poet from the damning dun. Come, let us teach each others tears to flow, Like fasting bards, in fellowship of woe, When the coy muse puts on coquettish airs, Nor deigns one line to their voracious prayers; Thy spirit, groaning like th'encumber'd block Which bears my works, deplores them as _dead stock_, Doom'd by these undiscriminating times To endless sleep, with Della Cruscan rhymes; Yes, Critics, whisper thee, litigious wretches! Oblivion's hand shall _finish_ all my _Sketches_. But see, _my_ soul such bug-bears has repell'd With magnanimity unparallel'd! Take up the volumes, every care dismiss, And smile, gruff Gorgon! while I tell thee this: Not one shall lie neglected on the shelf, All shall be sold--I'll buy them in myself. "

92,ON THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON.,ON THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON. 
93,ON THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON.,"Swift through the land while Fame transported flies, And shouts triumphant shake the illumin'd skies; Britannia, bending o'er her dauntless prows, With laurels thickening round her blazon'd brows, In joy dejected, sees her triumph crost, Exults in Victory won, but mourns the Victor lost. Immortal Nelson! still with fond amaze, Thy glorious deeds each British eye surveys, Beholds thee still, on conquer'd floods afar: Fate's flaming shaft! the thunderbolt of war! Hurl'd from thy hands, Britannia's vengeance roars, And bloody billows stain the hostile shores; Thy sacred ire Confed'rate Kingdoms braves And 'whelms their Navies in Sepulchral waves! "
94,ON THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON.,"--Graced with each attribute which Heaven supplies To Godlike Chiefs: humane, intrepid, wise; His Nation's bulwark, and all Nature's pride, The Hero liv'd, and as he liv'd--he died-- Transcendent Destiny! how blest the brave Whose fall his Country's tears attend, shower'd on his trophied grave! "

96,MORNING.,MORNING. 
97,MORNING.,"Light as the breeze that hails the infant morn The Milkmaid trips, as o'er her arm she slings Her cleanly pail, some favorite lay she sings As sweetly wild, and cheerful, as the horn. O happy girl! may never faithless love, Or fancied splendor, lead thy steps astray; No cares becloud the sunshine of thy day, Nor want e'er urge thee from thy cot to rove. What tho' thy station dooms thee to be poor, And by the hard-earn'd morsel thou art fed; Yet sweet content bedecks thy lowly bed, And health and peace sit smiling at thy door: Of these possess'd--thou hast a gracious meed, Which Heaven's high wisdom gives, to make thee rich indeed! "

99,AN IMPROMTU.,AN IMPROMTU. 
100,AN IMPROMTU.,"O Sub! you certainly have been, A little raking, roguish creature, And in that face may still be seen, Each laughing loves bewitching feature! "
101,AN IMPROMTU.,"For thou hast stolen many a heart-- And robb'd the sweetness of the rose; Plac'd on that cheek, it doth impart More lovely tints, more fragrant blows! "
102,AN IMPROMTU.,"Yes, thou art nature's favorite child, Array'd in smiles, seducing, killing; Did Joseph live, you'd drive him wild, And set his very soul a thrilling! "
103,AN IMPROMTU.,"A poet, much too poor to live, Too poor, in this rich world to rove, Too poor, for aught but verse to give, But not, thank God, too poor to love! "
104,AN IMPROMTU.,"Gives thee his little doggerel lay-- One truth I tell, in sorrow tell it, I'm forc'd to give my verse away, Because, alas! I cannot sell it. "
105,AN IMPROMTU.,"And should you with a critic's eye, Proclaim me 'gainst the Muse a sinner, Reflect, dear girl! that such as I, Six times a week don't get a dinner. "
106,AN IMPROMTU.,"And want of comfort, food, and wine, Will damp the genius, curb the spirit: These wants I'll own are often mine; But can't allow a want of merit. "
107,AN IMPROMTU.,"For every stupid dog that drinks At poet's pond, nicknam'd divine: Say what he will, I know he thinks That all he writes is devilish fine! "
108,_SONNET_.,_SONNET_. 
109,NIGHT.,NIGHT. 
110,NIGHT.,"Now when dun Night her shadowy veil has spread, See want and infamy as forth they come, Lead their wan daughter from her branded home, To woo the stranger for unhallow'd bread. Poor outcast! o'er thy sickly-tinted cheek And half-clad form, what havock want hath made; And the sweet lustre of thine eye doth fade, And all thy soul's sad sorrow seems to speak. O miserable state! compell'd to wear The wooing smile, as on thy aching breast Some wretch reclines, who feeling ne'er possess'd; Thy poor heart bursting with the stifled tear! Oh, GOD OF MERCY! bid her woes subside, And be to her a friend, who hath no friend beside. "
111,HENRY AND ELIZA,HENRY AND ELIZA 
112,HENRY AND ELIZA,"O'er the wide heath now moon-tide horrors hung, And night's dark pencil dim'd the tints of spring; The boding minstrel now harsh omens sung, And the bat spread his dark, nocturnal wing. "
113,HENRY AND ELIZA,"At that still hour, pale Cynthia oft had seen The fair Eliza, (joyous once and gay,) With pensive step, and melancholy mien, O'er the broad plain in love-born anguish stray. "
114,HENRY AND ELIZA,"Long had her heart with Henry's been entwin'd And love's soft voice had wak'd the sacred blaze Of Hymen's altar; while, with him combin'd, His cherub train prepar'd the torch to raise: "
115,HENRY AND ELIZA,"When, lo! his standard raging war uprear'd, And honor call'd her Henry from her charms. He fought, but ah! torn, mangled, blood-besmear'd, Fell, nobly fell, amid his conquering arms! "
116,HENRY AND ELIZA,"In her sad bosom, a tumultuous world Of hopes and fears on his dear memory spread; For fate had not the clouded roll unfurl'd, Nor yet with baleful hemlock crown'd her head. "
117,HENRY AND ELIZA,"Reflection, oft to sad remembrace brought The well-known spot, where they so oft had stray'd; While fond affection ten-fold ardor caught. And smiling innocence around them play'd. "
118,HENRY AND ELIZA,"But these were past! and now the distant bell (For deep and pensive thought had held her there) Toll'd midnight out, with long-resounding knell, While dismal echoes quiver'd in the air. "
119,HENRY AND ELIZA,"Again 'twas silence--when from out the gloom, She saw, with awe-struck eye, a phantom glide: Twas Henry's form!--what pencil shall presume To paint her horror!--HENRY AS HE DIED! "
120,HENRY AND ELIZA,"Enervate, long she stood--a sculptur'd dread, 'Till waking sense dissolv'd amazement's chain; Then home, with timid haste, distracted fled, And sunk in dreadful agony of pain. "
121,HENRY AND ELIZA,"Not the deep sigh, which madden'd Sappho gave, When from Leucate's craggy height she sprung, Could equal that which gave her to the grave, The last sad sound that echoed from her tongue. "

123,ON THE DEATH OF MRS. CHARLOTTE SMITH.,ON THE DEATH OF MRS. CHARLOTTE SMITH. 
124,ON THE DEATH OF MRS. CHARLOTTE SMITH.,"Sweet songstress! whom the melancholy Muse With more than fondness lov'd, for thee she strung The lyre, on which herself enraptur'd hung, And bade thee through the world its sweets diffuse. Oft hath my childhood's tributary tear Paid homage to the sad, harmonious strain, That told, alas, too true, the grief and pain, Which thy afflicted mind was doom'd to bear. Rest, sainted spirit! from a life of woe, And tho' no friendly hand on thee bestow The stately marble, or emblazon'd name, To tell a thoughtless world who sleeps below; Yet o'er thy narrow bed a wreath shall blow, Deriving vigour from the breath of fame.

127,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","Come away, come away, little fly! Don't disturb the sweet calm of love's nest: If you do, I protest you shall die, And your tomb be that beautiful breast. "
128,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","Don't tickle the girl in her sleep, Don't cause so much beauty to sigh; If she frown, all the Graces will weep; If she weep, half the Graces will die. "
129,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","Pretty fly! do not tickle her so; How delighted to teaze her you seem; Titillation is dangerous, I know, And may cause the dear creature to dream. "
130,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","She may dream of some horrible brute, Of some genii, or fairy-built spot; Or perhaps the prohibited fruit, Or perhaps of--I cannot tell what. "
131,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","Now she 'wakes! steal a kiss and begone; Life is precious; away, little fly! Should your rudeness provoke her to scorn, You'll meet death from the glance of her eye. "
132,"ON THE BOSOM OF CHLOE, WHILE SLEEPING.","Were I ask'd by fair Chloe to say How I felt, as the flutt'rer I chid; I should own, as I drove it away, I wish'd to be there in it's stead. "
133,_SONNET_,_SONNET_ 
134,_SONNET_,"When the rough storm roars round the peasant's cot, And bursting thunders roll their awful din; While shrieks the frighted night bird o'er the spot, Oh! what serenity remains within! For there Contentment, Health, and Peace abide, And pillow'd age, with calm eye fix'd above; Labor's bold son, his blithe and blooming bride, And lisping innocence, and filial love. To such a scene let proud Ambition turn, Whose aching breast conceals it's secret woe; Then shall his fireful spirit melt, and mourn The mild enjoyments it can never know; Then shall he feel the littleness of state, And sigh that Fortune e'er had made him great. "

136,WRITTEN ON THE SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER.,WRITTEN ON THE SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER. 
137,WRITTEN ON THE SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER.,"Ill-Fated hour! oft as thy annual reign Leads on th'autumnal tide, my pinion'd joys Fade with the glories of the fading year; ""Remembrance 'wakes with all her busy train,"" And bids affection heave the heart-drawn sigh O'er the cold tomb, rich with the spoils of death, And wet with many a tributary tear! "
138,WRITTEN ON THE SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER.,"Eight times has each successive season sway'd The fruitful sceptre of our milder clime Since My Loved ****** died! but why, ah! why Should melancholy cloud my early years? Religion spurns earth's visionary scene, Philosophy revolts at misery's chain: Just Heaven recall'd it's own, the pilgrim call'd From human woes, from sorrow's rankling worm; Shall frailty then prevail? "
139,WRITTEN ON THE SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER.,"Oh! be it mine To curb the sigh which bursts o'er Heaven's decree; To tread the path of rectitude--that when Life's dying ray shall glimmer in the frame, That latest breath I may in peace resign, ""Firm in the faith of seeing thee and God."" "
140,_SONNET_.,_SONNET_. 
141,TO FAITH.,TO FAITH. 
142,TO FAITH.,"Hail! Holy FAITH, on life's wide ocean tost, I see thee sit calm in thy beaten bark; As NOAH sat, thron'd in his high-borne ark, Secure and fearless, while a world was lost! In vain, contending storms thy head enzone, Thy bosom shrinks not from the bolt that falls: The dreadful shaft plays harmless, nor appals Thy steadfast eye, fixt on Jehovah's throne! E'en tho' thou saw'st the mighty fabric nod, Of system'd worlds, thou bears't a sacred charm, Grav'd on thy heart, to shelter thee from harm: And thus it speaks:--""Thou art my trust, O GOD! And thou canst bid the jarring powers be still, Each ponderous orb, like me, subservient to thy will! "
143,STANZAS.,STANZAS. 
144,STANZAS.,"Say why is the stern eye averted with scorn, Of the stoic, who passes along? And why frowns the maid, else as mild as the morn, On the victim of falshood and wrong? "
145,STANZAS.,"For the wretch sunk in sorrow, repentance, and shame, The tear of compassion is won: And alone, must she forfeit the wretch's sad claim, Because she's deceiv'd and undone? "
146,STANZAS.,"Oh! recall the stern look ere it reaches her heart, To bid its wounds rankle anew, Oh! smile, or embalm with a tear the sad smart, And angels will smile upon you. "
147,STANZAS.,"Time was, when she knew nor opprobrium nor pain, And youth could its pleasures impart, Till some serpent distill'd through her bosom the stain, As he wound round the strings of her heart. "
148,STANZAS.,"Poor girl! let thy tears through thy blandishments break, Nor strive to restrain them within; For mine would I mingle with those on thy cheek, Nor think that such sorrow were sin. "
149,STANZAS.,"When the low-trampled reed, and the pine in its pride, Shall alike feel the hand of decay, May your God grant that mercy the world has deny'd, And wipe all your sorrows away. "

151,TO HOPE.,TO HOPE. 
152,TO HOPE.,"How droops the wretch whom adverse fates pursue, While sad experience, from his aching sight, Sweeps the fair prospects of unprov'd delight Which flattering friends and flattering fancies drew. When want assails his solitary shed, When dire distraction's horrent eye-ball glares, Seen 'mid the myriad of tumultuous cares That shower their shafts on his devoted head. Then, ere despair usurp his vanquish'd heart, Is there a power, whose influence benign Can bid his head in pillow'd peace recline, And from his breast withdraw the barbed dart? There is--sweet Hope! misfortune rests on thee-- Unswerving anchor of humanity! "
153,THOUGHTS ON PEACE.,THOUGHTS ON PEACE. 
154,THOUGHTS ON PEACE.,"Still e'er that shrine defiance rears its head, Which rolls in sullen murmurs o'er the dead, That shrine which conquest, as it stems the flood. Too often tinges deep with human blood; Still o'er the land stern devastation reigns, Its giant mountains, and its spreading plains, Where the dark pines, their heads all gloomy, wave, Or rushing cataracts, loud-sounding, lave The precipice, whose brow with awful pride Tow'rs high above, and scorns the foaming tide; The village sweet, the forest stretching far, Groan undistinguish'd, 'midst the shock of war. There, the rack'd matron sees her son expire, There, clasps the infant son his murder'd sire, While the sad virgin on her lover's face, Weeps, with the last farewel, the last embrace, And the lone widow too, with frenzied cries, Amid the common wreck, unheeded dies. O Peace, bright Seraph, heaven-lov'd maid, return! And bid distracted nature cease to mourn! O, let the ensign drear of war be furl'd, And pour thy blessings on a bleeding world; Then social order shall again expand, It's sovereign good again shall bless the land, Elate the simple villager shall see, Contentment's inoffensive revelry; Then, once again shall o'er the foaming tide, The swelling sail of commerce fearless ride, With bounteous hand shall plenty grace our shore, And cheerless want's complaint be known no more. Then hear a nation's pray'r, lov'd goddess, hear! Wipe the wan cheek, deep-lav'd by many a tear; Nature, the triumph foul of horror o'er, Shall raise her frame to scenes of blood no more; Pale recollection shall recall her woes, Again shall paint her agonizing throes: These, o'er the earth thine empire firm shall raise, Unaw'd by war's destructive storms, the bliss of future days. "

156,TO CHARITY.,TO CHARITY. 
157,TO CHARITY.,"Oh! best belov'd of heaven, on earth bestow'd To raise the pilgrim, sunk with ghastly fears, To cool his burning wounds, to wipe his tears, And strew with amaranths his thorny road. Alas! how long has superstition hurl'd Thine altars down, thine attributes revil'd, The hearts of men with witchcrafts foul beguil'd, And spread his empire o'er the vassal world? But truth returns! she spreads resistless day; And mark, the monster's cloud-wrapt fabric falls-- He shrinks--he trembles 'mid his inmost halls, And all his damn'd illusions melt away! The charm dissolv'd--immortal, fair, and free, Thy holy fanes shall rise, celestial Charity! "

159,TO PUBLIC READINGS AT A YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S ACADEMY.,TO PUBLIC READINGS AT A YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S ACADEMY. 
160,TO PUBLIC READINGS AT A YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S ACADEMY.,"Once more we venture here, to prove our worth, And ask indulgence kind, to tempt us forth: Seek not perfection from our essays green, That, in man's noblest works, has never been, Nor is, nor e'er will be; a work exempt From fault to form, as well might man attempt T'explore the vast infinity of space, Or fix mechanic boundaries to grace. Hard is the finish'd Speaker's task; what then Must be our danger, to pursue the pen Of the 'rapt Bard, through all his varied turns, Where joy extatic smiles, or sorrow mourns? Where Richard's soul, red in the murtherous lave, Shrinks from the night-yawn'd tenants of the grave, While coward conscience still affrights his eye, Still groans the dagger'd sound, ""despair and die."" And hapless Juliet's unextinguish'd flame, Gives to the tomb she mock'd, her beauteous frame; Yet diff'rent far, where Claudio sees return'd To life, and love, the maid too rashly spurn'd; Or Falstaff, in his sympathetic scroll, Forth to the Wives of Windsor pours his soul. Again, forsaking mirth's fantastic rites, The Muse to follow, through her nobler flights, Where Milton paints angelic hosts in arms, And Heaven's wide champaign rings with dire alarms, Till 'vengeful justice wings its dreadful way, And hurls the apostate from the face of day. Immortal Bards! high o'er oblivion's shroud Their names shall live, pre-eminent and proud, Who snatch'd the keys of mystery from time, This world too little for their Muse sublime! "
161,TO PUBLIC READINGS AT A YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S ACADEMY.,"With Thomson, now, o'er sylvan scenes we stray, Or seek the lone church-yard, with pensive Gray: On Pope's refin'd, or Dryden's lofty strains, Dwell, while their fire the lightest heart enchains. Through these and all our Bards to whom belong The pow'rs transcendent of immortal song, How difficult to steer t'avoid the cant Of polish'd phrase, and nerve-alarming rant; Each period with true elegance to round, And give the Poet's meaning in the sound. But, wherefore should the Muse employ her verse, The peril of our labors to rehearse? Oft has your kind, your generous applause, E're now, convinc'd us, you approve our cause: Conscious it will again our task attend, The Critic stern, we ask not to commend, Who like inclement Winter's hostile frown Would beat th'infantine shrubs of Genius down. "
162,TO PUBLIC READINGS AT A YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S ACADEMY.,"By your kind sanction, spur'd to nobler aims, Our country, now, the Muses' tribute claims: When o'er fair Albion war destructive lours, Oh! be those Patriot feelings ever ours, Which from the public mind spontaneous burst On that infuriate foe, by crimes accurst, Who'd o'er our envied isle his vassals send, And all the land with dire convulsions rend. Well! let their armies come, their locusts pour, Each British heart shall welcome them on shore, Each British hand is arm'd in Britain's cause, To guard their birth-right, liberty, and laws, Rise! Britons, rise! attend fair freedom's cry, The wretch who meanly fears deserves to die. His kind protection 'gainst each latent foe, Still may that Pow'r Omnipotent bestow, Which first Britannia's sov'reign flag unfurl'd So high, it flames a beacon to the World! "
163,THE BEGGAR.,THE BEGGAR. 
164,THE BEGGAR.,"Of late I saw him on his staff reclin'd, Bow'd down beneath a weary weight of woes, Without a roof to shelter from the wind His head, all hoar with many a winter's snows. All tremb'ling he approach'd, he strove to speak; The voice of misery scarce my ear assail'd; A flood of sorrow swept his furrow'd cheek, Remembrance check'd him, and his utt'rance fail'd. For he had known full many a better day; And when the poor-man at his threshold bent, He drove him not with aching heart away, But freely shar'd what Providence had sent. How hard for him, the stranger's boon to crave, And live to want the mite his bounty gave! "

166,TO .........,"Come, Jenny, let me sip the dew, That on those coral lips doth play, One kiss would every care subdue, And bid my weary soul be gay. "

The mellow horn's long-echoing notes Startle the morn commingling strong; At eve, the harp's wild music floats, And ravish'd silence drinks the song; Yet sweeter is the song of love, When Emma's voice enchants the grove, While listening sylphs repeat the tale, Sequester'd in the silent vale.

That sigh for thee shall ne'er forget to heave; 'Tis all he now can give, or thou receive.

Ah, sad reverse! too soon the fated hour Saw the dire tempest 'whelm th'expanding flow'r? Then from thy tongue its music ceas'd to flow; Thine eye forgot to gleam with aught but woe; Peace fled thy breast; invincible despair Usurp'd her seat, and struck his daggers there. Did not the unpitying world thy sorrows fly? And ah, what then was left thee--but to die! Yet not a friend beheld thy parting breath, Or mingled solace with the pangs of death: No priest proclaim'd the erring hour forgiv'n, Or sooth'd thy spirit to its native heav'n: But Heaven, more bounteous, bade the pilgrim come, And hovering angels hail'd their sister home.

"
357,LOVE.,"Thus speaks the heart, which cold disgust invades, When time instructs and hope's enchantment fades; Through life's wide stage, from sages down to kings, The puppets move, as art directs the strings; Imperious beauty bows to sordid gold, Her smiles, whence heaven flows emanent, are sold; And affectation swells the entrancing tones, Which nature subjugates, and truth disowns.

Then, wak'd tumultuous in th' alarmed breast, Contending passions claim th' etherial guest, And still, as each alternate empire proves, She hopes, she fears, she envies, and she loves, Owns all sensations that divide the span, And eternize the little life of man.
