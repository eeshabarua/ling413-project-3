76,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
77,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
78,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"The following Sonnet Sequence,--written during rare intervals of leisure"
79,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"in a busy and strenuous life,--was privately printed in Madras early in"
80,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"1914, without any intention of publication on the part of the author. He"
81,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"has, however, now consented to allow it to be given to a wider audience;"
82,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,and we anticipate in many directions a welcome for this small but
83,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"significant volume by the writer of _India to England_, one of the most"
84,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,popular and often-quoted lyrics evoked by the Great War.
85,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
86,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"The Nawab Nizamat Jung Bahadur, was born in the State of Hyderabad, but"
87,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,educated in England; and there are some--at Cambridge and elsewhere--who
88,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,will remember his keenly discriminating interest in British history and
89,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"literature, and the comprehensive way he, in a few words, would indicate"
90,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"his impressions of poets and heroes, long dead, but to him ever-living."
91,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
92,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,His appreciation was both ardent and just; he could swiftly recognise
93,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,the nobler elements in characters which at first glance might seem
94,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,startlingly dissimilar; and he could pass without apparent effort from
95,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,study of the lives of men of action to the inward contemplations of
96,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,abstruse philosophers.
97,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
98,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"To those who have not met him, it may appear paradoxical to say that his"
99,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,tastes were at the same moment acutely fastidious and widely
100,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,sympathetic; but anyone who has talked with him will recall the blend of
101,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,high impersonal ideas with a remarkable personality which seldom failed
102,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,to stimulate other minds--even if those others shared few if any of his
103,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,intellectual tastes.
104,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
105,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"A famous British General (still living) was once asked, ""What is the"
106,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"most essential quality for a great leader of men?"" And he replied in one"
107,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"word ""SYMPATHY."" The General was speaking of leadership in relation to"
108,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"warfare; and by ""Sympathy"" he meant swift insight into the minds of"
109,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"others; and, with this insight, the power to arouse and fan into a flame"
110,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,the spark of chivalry and true nobility in each. The career of the Nawab
111,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Nizamat Jung has not been set in the world of action,--he is at present"
112,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"a Judge of the High Court in Hyderabad,--but nevertheless this"
113,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"definition of sympathy is not irrelevant, for the Nawab's personal"
114,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,influence has been more subtle and far-reaching than he himself is yet
115,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"aware. His love of poetry and history, if on the one hand it has"
116,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,intensified his realisation of the sorrows and tragedies of earthly
117,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"life, on the other hand has equipped him with a power to awake in others"
118,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"a vivid consciousness of the moral value of literature,--through which"
119,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,(for the mere asking) we any of us can find our way into a kingdom of
120,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,great ideas. This kingdom is also the kingdom of eternal realities--or
121,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,so at least it should be; and those who in the early nineties in England
122,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,talked with Nizamoudhin (as he then was) could scarcely fail to notice
123,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"that he valued the genius of an author, or the exploits of a character"
124,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"in history, chiefly in proportion to the permanent and vital nature of"
125,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,the truths this character had laboured to express--whether in words or
126,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,action.
127,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
128,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"But Truth, has many faces; and scarcely any poet (except perhaps"
129,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,Shakespeare) has come within measurable distance of expressing every
130,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,aspect of the human character. The Nawab could take pleasure in reading
131,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"poets as temperamentally dissimilar as Shelley and Scott, Spenser and"
132,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Byron,--to name only a few. Shelley, who was a spirit utterly unable to"
133,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"understand this world or ordinary homespun human nature; and Scott, who"
134,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"not only comprehended both without an effort, but who combined the"
135,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"practical and the romantic elements successfully in his own life, A"
136,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"devotion to Spenser, ""the poet's poet,"" the poet of a dreamy yet very"
137,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"real and living chivalry,--Spenser who used to forget himself in his"
138,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"creations,--did not prevent the Nawab from understanding Byron, who"
139,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"never could forget himself at all; and who, with all his vivid impulses"
140,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"of generous sympathy for the oppressed, is nevertheless generally"
141,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"classed to-day as a colossal egoist. (Unjustly so, for no mere egoist"
142,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"would have toiled as he toiled for Greek emancipation, in the"
143,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,nerve-racking campaign which cost him his life.)
144,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
145,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,In _India to England_--most characteristic of the war poems of Nizamat
146,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,Jung--we see traces of the influence of more than one of the English
147,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,poets he has read so lovingly. But the poem is none the less poignantly
148,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,personal. The same may be said of the Sonnets here prefaced; for
149,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,although they are related to the sonnets of earlier poets whose work
150,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"must be familiar to the writer, yet they are in no sense imitations, nor"
151,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,are they echoes.
152,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
153,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_Poetry is the natural language of strong emotion_,"" the Nawab said many"
154,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"years ago;--and if it may be asked why, holding this view, he has chosen"
155,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"such an elaborate (and, some people might add, artificial) form as the"
156,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Sonnet, we can only answer that when an emotion or conviction is"
157,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"deep-seated and permanent, it becomes clarified, concentrated, and"
158,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,intensified under the stern discipline of compression within the
159,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,arbitrary yet expressive limitations of a sonnet.[A]
160,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
161,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,One of the main reasons why the Nawab's friends have urged the
162,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"publication of his Sonnets, is that despite occasional imperfections (of"
163,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"which he himself is conscious), they form a consistent whole, and in"
164,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,their spirit and sentiment they are akin to some of the most noble
165,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,utterances of the great minds and hearts whose words have been like
166,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,torches to show what heights a strong aspiring soul can climb.
167,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
168,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_The Will is the master. Imagination the tool, and the body the plastic"
169,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"material_,"" said a famous physician, who was also a practical man of the"
170,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,world;--and the poet who identifies his will and imagination with the
171,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"eternal truths, who looks up to the stars instead of down into the mud,"
172,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"may always, even in his weariest hours, cheer himself by mental"
173,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,companionship with the other resolute souls whose pens have been used as
174,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,swords in the service of Divine Beauty.
175,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
176,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Of all the most famous writers of Sonnets, it is Michelangelo whose"
177,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,words come back most vividly to memory as we read the Nawab's
178,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,expressions of faith.
179,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
180,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_Love wakes the soul and gives it wings to fly_."""
181,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
182,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
183,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_All beauty that to human sight is given"
184,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Is but the shadow, if we rightly see,"
185,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Of Him from Whom man's spirit issueth_."""
186,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
187,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
188,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_As heat from fire, my love from the ideal"
189,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Is parted never_."""
190,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
191,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
192,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""_Oh noble spirit, noble semblance taking,"
193,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,We mirrored in Thy mortal beauty see
194,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"What Heaven and earth achieve in harmony_."""
195,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
196,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"Thus wrote Michelangelo of Vittoria Colonna (Marchioness of Pescara),"
197,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"""being enamoured of her divine spirit"";[B] and though in the Sonnets of"
198,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"the Nawab, who uses what is for him a foreign tongue, the ideal is"
199,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"sometimes greater than the expression of it, yet the spirit shines out"
200,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,with a light which none can mistake. And whether the average man accepts
201,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"or rejects the standards therein embodied, lovers of poetry will"
202,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"recognise that the Nawab, in his championship of a high and noble ideal,"
203,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"fights in the same army as Dante and Michelangelo,--neither of them"
204,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"cloistered dreamers, neither of them arm-chair theorists, but men who"
205,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,lived and loved and suffered amidst the turmoil of a world they viewed
206,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,with wide-open eyes and unflinching minds.
207,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,
208,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,The chivalrous ideal of an exalted and inspiring love can be rejected if
209,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,we please;--but let none claim to be manly because this ideal seems too
210,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,"ethereal. For it is by the most vigorous, most strenuous, and most"
211,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,commanding souls and minds that this faith in the Eternal Beauty has
212,BY RICHARD CHARLES FRASER,been cherished and upheld most ardently and resolutely.

233,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Italian _sonetto_ (literally ""a little sound""), and the _sonetto_ was"
234,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"originally a short poem recited or sung to the accompaniment of music,"
235,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,probably the lute or mandolin.

237,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Whether its birth should be attributed to Italy or Sicily,--or to"
238,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Provence, the cradle of troubadour poetry,--is a subject on which the"
239,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"learned may still indulge in pleasant controversies. But in Italy,"
240,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"towards the end of the thirteenth century, it had already become a"
241,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"favourite mode of expression; and some forty years later, in a"
242,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,manuscript treatise on the _Poetica Volgare_ (written in 1332 by a Judge
243,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"in Padua), sixteen different forms of sonnet were enumerated as then in"
244,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,current use.
245,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
246,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"But despite the continued vogue of the Sonnet, and its association with"

248,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Italy; Ronsard in France; Camoens in Portugal; Shakespeare, Milton,"
249,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,Wordsworth and Rossetti in England--to say nothing of a host of minor
250,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"poets, who, though one star differeth from another in glory, yet"
251,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,constitute a brilliant galaxy--it is remarkable that even now the
252,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"average non-literary reader when asked ""What is a Sonnet?"" seldom gives"
253,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"any more explicit reply than to say it is ""a short poem limited to"
254,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"fourteen lines."""
255,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
256,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"The rules for the structure of those fourteen lines, and the labour and"
257,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"patience entailed in producing a poem under these limitations, are not"
258,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,always realised even by those who enjoy the results of the poet's
259,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"concentrated efforts. The more successful a sonnet, the more the reader"
260,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,is apt to accept its beauty as if it had grown by a natural process like
261,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"a flower. This, perhaps, is the best compliment we could pay the poet;"
262,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,but if the poet is one who boldly essays a most difficult and complex
263,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"form, in a language which for him is foreign, then we should pause a"
264,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,moment to consider what it is that he has set out to accomplish.
265,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
266,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,Taking the structure first (though for the poet the spirit and impetus
267,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,of the central idea must of course come first)--a sonnet on the Italian
268,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"(Petrarchan) model must consist of fourteen lines of ten syllables each,"
269,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"and must be composed of a major and minor system, i.e. an octave and a"
270,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,sestet.
271,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
272,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"In the octave (the first eight lines) the first, fourth, fifth and"
273,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"eighth lines must rhyme on the same sound, and the second, third, sixth"
274,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"and seventh, must rhyme on another sound."
275,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
276,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,In the sestet (the last six lines) more liberty of rhyme and arrangement
277,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"is permitted, but a rhymed couplet at the end is not usual except when"
278,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"the sonnet departs from the Italian model and is on the English or, as"
279,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"we say, ""Shakespearian"" pattern."
280,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
281,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Each sonnet must be complete; and, even if one of a sequence, it should"
282,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,contain within itself everything necessary to the understanding of it.
283,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"It must be the expression of _one_ emotion, _one_ fact, _one_ idea, and"
284,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"""the continuity of the thought, idea, or emotion must be unbroken"
285,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"throughout."" ""Dignity and repose,"" ""expression ample yet reticent,"" are"
286,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,qualities which one of our ablest modern critics emphasises as
287,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"essential, and the end must always be more impressive than the"
288,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"beginning,--the reader must be carried onwards and upwards, and left"
289,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,with a definite feeling that in what has been said there is neither
290,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"superfluity nor omission, but rather a completeness which precludes all"
291,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,wish or need for a longer poem.
292,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
293,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,How difficult this is for the poet can only be realised by trying to
294,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,achieve it.
295,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
296,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,The earliest writers of English sonnets were two very romantic and
297,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"gallant men of action, Sir Thomas Wyatt, and Henry Howard, Earl of"
298,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"Surrey,--both destined to brief brilliant lives and tragic deaths. They"
299,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"were followed by Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney and a host of Elizabethan"
300,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"poets, courtly and otherwise. But it is Shakespeare whose Sonnets"
301,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,(though not conforming to the Petrarchan model) show the most force and
302,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,fire of any in our language until those of Milton.
303,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
304,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"To analyse the variations of the Shakesperian, Spenserian and Miltonian"
305,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"forms is, however, unnecessary to our present purpose, as the Sonnet"
306,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,Sequence we are now prefacing is based on the Petrarchan model. Strictly
307,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"speaking, the Petrarchan sestet (the last six lines) should have three"
308,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"separate rhymed sounds; the first and fourth lines, the second and"
309,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"fifth, and the third and sixth should form the three rhymes. But this"
310,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,rule is by no means invariably followed; even Wordsworth and Rossetti
311,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"often rhymed the first with the third, and the second with the fourth"
312,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"lines; and sometimes used only two sounds,--the first, third, and fifth"
313,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"lines making one rhyme and the second, fourth, and sixth the other."
314,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
315,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"As already said, these liberties are permitted, for the sestet is not"
316,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,under such arbitrary regulations as the octave.
317,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
318,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"There are writers who keep all the rules, and yet leave their readers"
319,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"cold; and others who are technically less correct, but in whom the"
320,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,vigour and intensity of emotion is swiftly felt and silences adverse
321,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,criticism. The ideal is to combine deep and exalted feeling with perfect
322,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"expression, and produce a whole which goes to the heart like a beautiful"
323,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"piece of music, and satisfies the mind--like one of those ancient Greek"
324,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"gems which, in a small space, presents engraved images symbolic of"
325,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,sublime ideas vast as the universe.
326,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
327,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,The Nawab Nizamat Jung has written in English several sonnets which we
328,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,should admire even if English were his native language. But if any of us
329,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,"would like to form some estimate of the difficulties he has surmounted,"
330,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,let us sit down and try to express in a sonnet in _any_ foreign language
331,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,our own thoughts and beliefs. We shall then the better appreciate what
332,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,he has achieved.
333,NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,
