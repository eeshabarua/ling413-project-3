122,TO EVERYBODY,
123,TO EVERYBODY,
124,TO EVERYBODY,
125,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER
126,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,
127,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"My dear Sir,--"
128,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,You may think it unkind of me
129,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,To interrupt the peaceful calm of your holiday
130,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,With a poem about business.
131,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"But I assure you, my dear sir,"
132,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"That I do so with the very best intentions,"
133,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And at the call of what I consider to be duty.
134,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Duty, as you know, is a tremendous abstraction,"
135,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And brings a man into all sorts of difficult corners.
136,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,It was duty that took you into Parliament:
137,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Similarly it is duty that constrains me to Odes.
138,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"When a man sees another man and pities him,"
139,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,It is the duty of the first man to let the other man know about it
140,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Delicately.
141,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"I pity you, my dear Mr. Private Member,"
142,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,From the bottom of a bottomless heart.
143,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Many a time and oft in the course of my rambles
144,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Through the lobbies and liquor bars of St. Stephens
145,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,It has been my ineffable portion to run across you--
146,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Silk hat, frock coat, baggy trousers, patient stare, bored expression:"
147,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Suddenly you smile
148,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And crook the pregnant hinges of the back of your neck.
149,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Mrs. Wiggle, the three Misses Wiggle, and little Master Wiggle,"
150,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Wife, daughters, and son of Mr. Forthree Wiggle,"
151,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Draper, and burgess of the good old Parliamentary Division"
152,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Of Mudsher West,"
153,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Are up from Mudsher West,"
154,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And they want showin' round the 'Ouse, you know."
155,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Round you go.
156,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Again: you appear in the Strangers' Lobby,"
157,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Spectacles on nose, somebody's card in hand."
158,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,The policeman roars out name of leading constituent.
159,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Leading constituent departed in a huff twenty minutes ago,"
160,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Because he thought you were not attending to him.
161,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"There being no answer,"
162,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Policeman roars out name of leading constituent once more.
163,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Name echoes along Lords' Lobby;
164,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"But not being there, leading constituent fails to come forward."
165,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"You look embarrassed, turn tail, retire to your back bench,"
166,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And feel deucedly uncomfortable for the rest of the evening.
167,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"You would like to get away to the theatre,"
168,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,But you dare not do it:
169,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,There are Whips about.
170,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,You would like to go home to bed;
171,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,You must wait the good pleasure of the course of the debate.
172,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,You would like to stand on your hind legs
173,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And address the House on large matters:
174,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,But you know in your heart
175,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,That the House will stand absolutely nothing from you
176,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Bar a question or so.
177,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"You sit, and sit, and sit through dull debate after dull debate,"
178,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And you sigh for the hustings and the brass bands,"
179,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And the banquets and the ""He's-a-jolly-good-fellow""-s"
180,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And wonder how it comes to pass
181,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"That you, who were once set down in the _Mudsher Mercury_"
182,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"For a blend of Demosthenes and John Bright,"
183,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Can never get more than twenty words off the end of your tongue
184,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"After ""Mr. Speaker, Sir."""
185,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Oh! my dear Mr. Private Member,"
186,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"Your case is indeed a sad one,"
187,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And it is all the sadder when one comes to reflect
188,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"That, as a general rule, you are a sincereish sort of man,"
189,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Burning and bursting with a desire
190,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,To do your poor suffering country
191,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,A bit of good.
192,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,You know that the men who have the ear of the House
193,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Are mere talkers;
194,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"That they are only ""playing the party game,"""
195,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And that the country may go to pot for anything they care.
196,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And yet they make their speeches
197,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And get them reported at length in the papers,"
198,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And are given places in the Cabinet,"
199,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"And go for ""dines-and-sleeps"" with the King,"
200,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"What time you grow old and grey and obese and bleary eyed,"
201,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And never get the smallest show.
202,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,"I pity you, my dear Mr. Private Member, I do really."
203,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,But for your comfort I may tell you
204,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,That all you lack
205,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,Is courage
206,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,And brains.
207,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,
208,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,
209,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,
210,TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER,
211,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON
212,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
213,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,(_After Peace Night_)
214,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
215,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Dear Sir, or Madam,"
216,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"As the case may be,"
217,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"When Britain first,"
218,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"At Heaving's command,"
219,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Arose from out
220,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"The azure main,"
221,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,This was the chawter
222,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Of that land
223,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And gawdian a-a-a-a-angels
224,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Sang this strain:
225,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Don't you think so?
226,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"For my own part,"
227,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,I am quite sure of it:
228,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Monday night convinced me.
229,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Mafeking night,"
230,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"As you may remember,"
231,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Was a honeyed
232,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And beautiful affair.
233,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,But
234,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Peace night,"
235,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"I think,"
236,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Really outdid it in splendours.
237,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,At the cafe
238,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Which I most frequent,"
239,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,All was Peace.
240,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Round the table next mine,"
241,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"There were seventeen Jews,"
242,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,With a Union Jack.
243,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Ever and anon
244,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"(Between drinks, as it were),"
245,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,They held up
246,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,That Union Jack
247,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And yelled:
248,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"""Shend him victoriouth,"
249,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"'Appy and gloriouth,"
250,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Long to-o reign over uth,"
251,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"&c., &c."""
252,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"I wonder, my dear Sir, or Madam,"
253,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Why the Jews are so pleased:
254,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,I can't make it out.
255,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Howsomever,"
256,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Pleased they are,"
257,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And a pleased Jew
258,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Is worth a king's ransom,"
259,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Or words to that effect.
260,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Peace, my dear Sir, or Madam,"
261,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Is a chaste and choice
262,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Thing.
263,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
264,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Outside the aforesaid cafe,"
265,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,The crowd
266,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Was so numerous
267,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And exuberant
268,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,That I was compelled
269,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"(Much to my annoyance, of course)"
270,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,To remain inside
271,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Till closing-time.
272,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Then I went home
273,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,In the friendly embrace
274,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Of a four-wheeler.
275,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"For a little while,"
276,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,There was much shouting and yelling and roaring and squeaking
277,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,and singing;
278,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And then I knew
279,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,No more.
280,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,My cab
281,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Bowled away
282,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Through the sweet evening air
283,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"(That is to say,"
284,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,If the common or Regent Street growler
285,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Ever does bowl away),"
286,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,And all the time
287,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,I snored.
288,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,Duly awakened
289,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Outside my bungalow,"
290,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"I raked up the fare,"
291,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"And, in reply to kind enquiries"
292,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"In the hall,"
293,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,I remarked:
294,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"""Peace, O woman of mine,"
295,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,"Peace!"""
296,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
297,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
298,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
299,TO THE TRUE-BORN BRITON,
300,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW
301,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,
302,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"My dear Cambridge,"
303,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"You have pulled it off,"
304,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,As all men know.
305,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,This ode
306,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Will make Oxford pretty sick;
307,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,But the spoils are to the victor.
308,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,If Oxford had rowed better
309,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"And won,"
310,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"They should have had a nice new ode,"
311,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Like good boys;
312,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"But they have been and gone and lost,"
313,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"And are, therefore,"
314,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Not fit subjects
315,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,For immortal verse.
316,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Pah!
317,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,I pass by Oxford!
318,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"As for you, dear Cambridge,"
319,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Here's to you:
320,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In spite of your long and honourable connection
321,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,With the manufacture
322,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Of sossiges,"
323,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"There appears to be something in you,"
324,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Which is more than can be said
325,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,For some of the sossiges.
326,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Cambridge, my own,"
327,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,You have won the bowt rice!
328,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,'Ave a drink!
329,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"What is the good of winning the bowt rice,"
330,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,If you don't 'ave a drink?
331,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"I don't know,"
332,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And I'm sure you don't.
333,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Also, what is the good"
334,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Of winning the bowt rice
335,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,At all?
336,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,I give it up.
337,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Yes, I do really;"
338,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Please do let me give it up.
339,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,You have won;
340,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,You can afford to be generous;
341,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Suffer me to indulge my little whim:
342,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,There is no good
343,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"In winning the bowt rice, Cambridge"
344,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,No good at all.
345,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"On the other hand,"
346,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,When I come to think of it
347,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,I am not quite sure
348,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,That to have rowed
349,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In the Cambridge boat
350,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Which won the bowt rice,"
351,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Is materially to have damaged
352,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,One's prospects or career:
353,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"At the very least, it makes one safe"
354,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,For a tutor's job
355,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,At £80 per annum;
356,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And what self-respecting person from Cambridge
357,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Could wish for more?
358,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,I have heard of a man
359,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Who rowed
360,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In a winning Cambridge boat
361,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And is now driving
362,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,A hansom cab.
363,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And I have heard of another man
364,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Who omitted to row
365,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In a winning Cambridge boat
366,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And is now driving a four-wheeler.
367,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"You see the difference, of course!"
368,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"After all,"
369,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,To row
370,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In a winning Cambridge boat
371,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Does give one
372,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"A sort of start in life,"
373,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,And don't you forget it.
374,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,"Always remember, my dear Cambridge, who you are."
375,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,You licked Oxford by five lengths
376,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,In 1902.
377,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,This is probably
378,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,All you will get
379,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,For your father's money.
380,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,Be thankful.
381,TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW,

386,TO MR. DAN LENO,
387,TO MR. DAN LENO,(_On his Appearance at Sandringham_)
388,TO MR. DAN LENO,
389,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Dear Mr. Dan Leno,--"
390,TO MR. DAN LENO,This has been a great week
391,TO MR. DAN LENO,For Art--
392,TO MR. DAN LENO,One of the biggest weeks in fact
393,TO MR. DAN LENO,On record.
394,TO MR. DAN LENO,"For at the beginning of the week, my dear Mr. Leno,"
395,TO MR. DAN LENO,"You were a mere popular entertainer,"
396,TO MR. DAN LENO,Whereas at the present moment
397,TO MR. DAN LENO,"You are a proud and 'appy man,"
398,TO MR. DAN LENO,And in a position to walk about the Strand
399,TO MR. DAN LENO,With a diamond E
400,TO MR. DAN LENO,Scintillating in your cravat.
401,TO MR. DAN LENO,The thing that was anticipated
402,TO MR. DAN LENO,"By the intelligent paragraphists,"
403,TO MR. DAN LENO,"My dear Mr. Leno,"
404,TO MR. DAN LENO,Has come to pass.
405,TO MR. DAN LENO,His Britannic Majesty
406,TO MR. DAN LENO,"King Edward VII., D.G.: B. et T.T.B.R.: I.I.,"
407,TO MR. DAN LENO,_Does_ intend to give artists and authors and people
408,TO MR. DAN LENO,A little bit more of a show
409,TO MR. DAN LENO,Than has hitherto fallen to their lot.
410,TO MR. DAN LENO,"His Majesty,"
411,TO MR. DAN LENO,"My dear Mr. Leno,"
412,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Has always been noted for his tact,"
413,TO MR. DAN LENO,"And in opening the ball with you, as it were,"
414,TO MR. DAN LENO,His Majesty has exhibited an amount of tact
415,TO MR. DAN LENO,Which leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.
416,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Had he commenced with Mr. Swinburne,"
417,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Or myself,"
418,TO MR. DAN LENO,Or Mr. Hall Caine
419,TO MR. DAN LENO,What howls there would have been!
420,TO MR. DAN LENO,Whereas as it is
421,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Everybody is delighted,"
422,TO MR. DAN LENO,And the Halls resound nightly with his Majesty's praises.
423,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Furthermore,"
424,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Besides being tactful,"
425,TO MR. DAN LENO,"The King's choice of you,"
426,TO MR. DAN LENO,"My dear Mr. Leno,"
427,TO MR. DAN LENO,For an invitation to Sandringham
428,TO MR. DAN LENO,Has its basis in a profound common sense;
429,TO MR. DAN LENO,"For I am acquainted with nobody in the movement,"
430,TO MR. DAN LENO,"My dear Mr. Leno,"
431,TO MR. DAN LENO,Who could have done the Sandringham turn
432,TO MR. DAN LENO,With anything like the success which appears to have been yours.
433,TO MR. DAN LENO,I gather from interviews
434,TO MR. DAN LENO,"That the King ""laughed heartily"" at your jokes,"
435,TO MR. DAN LENO,"And that ""it was a treat to see him enjoying himself."""
436,TO MR. DAN LENO,"It is just here that Mr. Swinburne, myself, and Mr. Hall Caine"
437,TO MR. DAN LENO,Would have broken down.
438,TO MR. DAN LENO,It seems to me unlikely
439,TO MR. DAN LENO,That the King would have laughed
440,TO MR. DAN LENO,At Mr. Swinburne's jokes;
441,TO MR. DAN LENO,"My own jokes, as everybody is aware,"
442,TO MR. DAN LENO,Are constructed on a principle
443,TO MR. DAN LENO,Which entirely prohibits laughter;
444,TO MR. DAN LENO,"While, as for Mr. Hall Caine's jokes,"
445,TO MR. DAN LENO,They have such a tremendous sale
446,TO MR. DAN LENO,That it is not good form to laugh at them.
447,TO MR. DAN LENO,"Mr. Leno, my boy,"
448,TO MR. DAN LENO,You have been the humble means
449,TO MR. DAN LENO,Of doing us all
450,TO MR. DAN LENO,A great kindness.
451,TO MR. DAN LENO,Those jokes of yours
452,TO MR. DAN LENO,Which have tickled Royal ears
453,TO MR. DAN LENO,Will be nectar to me
454,TO MR. DAN LENO,When next it is my pleasurable duty
455,TO MR. DAN LENO,To sit under you;
456,TO MR. DAN LENO,That hand which Royalty has shaken
457,TO MR. DAN LENO,I shall grasp
458,TO MR. DAN LENO,With an added fervour;
459,TO MR. DAN LENO,That smile will cheer me all the more readily
460,TO MR. DAN LENO,Because it has cheered
461,TO MR. DAN LENO,My liege Lord and Sovereign;
462,TO MR. DAN LENO,Those feet----
463,TO MR. DAN LENO,"But, after all, the great point"
464,TO MR. DAN LENO,Is the scarf pin.
465,TO MR. DAN LENO,I suppose you would not care to lend it to me
466,TO MR. DAN LENO,For a week or two
467,TO MR. DAN LENO,While I have one made
468,TO MR. DAN LENO,Like it?
469,TO MR. DAN LENO,
470,TO MR. DAN LENO,
471,TO MR. DAN LENO,
472,TO MR. DAN LENO,
473,TO THE POPE,TO THE POPE
474,TO THE POPE,
475,TO THE POPE,May it please your Holiness
476,TO THE POPE,"There are possibly two,"
477,TO THE POPE,"Or it may be three,"
478,TO THE POPE,Men
479,TO THE POPE,In Europe
480,TO THE POPE,Who could indite this Ode
481,TO THE POPE,Without treading on anybody's corns.
482,TO THE POPE,"After mature reflection,"
483,TO THE POPE,I am inclined to think that I am those three men
484,TO THE POPE,So that you will understand.
485,TO THE POPE,"Well, my dear Pope, I hear on all hands"
486,TO THE POPE,"That you are engaged, at the present moment,"
487,TO THE POPE,In the cheerful act and process
488,TO THE POPE,Of having a Jubilee.
489,TO THE POPE,I have had several myself
490,TO THE POPE,"And I know what pleasant little functions they are,"
491,TO THE POPE,Especially when the King
492,TO THE POPE,Sends a mission to congratulate one on them.
493,TO THE POPE,"To proceed,"
494,TO THE POPE,"You must know, my dear Pope,"
495,TO THE POPE,"That, by conviction"
496,TO THE POPE,"And in my own delightful country,"
497,TO THE POPE,"I am a rabid, saw-toothed Kensitite Protestant;"
498,TO THE POPE,All my ancestors figure gloriously
499,TO THE POPE,"In Foxe's ""Book of Martyrs,"""
500,TO THE POPE,"And, if they don't, they ought to."
501,TO THE POPE,"Also, I never go into Smithfield"
502,TO THE POPE,Without thinking of the far-famed fires thereof
503,TO THE POPE,And thanking my lucky stars
504,TO THE POPE,That this is Protestant England
505,TO THE POPE,And that the King defends the Faith.
506,TO THE POPE,"But, when I get on to the Continent,"
507,TO THE POPE,"To do my week-end in Paris,"
508,TO THE POPE,"Or my ""ten days at lovely Lucerne,"""
509,TO THE POPE,Or my walk with Dr. Lunn
510,TO THE POPE,"""In the footsteps of St. Paul,"""
511,TO THE POPE,"Why, then, somehow"
512,TO THE POPE,The bottom falls clean out of my Kensitariousness
513,TO THE POPE,"And I become a decent, mass-hearing, candle-burning Catholic."
514,TO THE POPE,"That is curious, but true,"
515,TO THE POPE,And may probably be accounted for
516,TO THE POPE,By differences of climate.
517,TO THE POPE,"However, we can leave that;"
518,TO THE POPE,"Here, in England, my dear Pope,"
519,TO THE POPE,"We all like you,"
520,TO THE POPE,Whether we be Catholics or Protestants or Jews or Gentiles or
521,TO THE POPE,members of the Playgoers' Club;
522,TO THE POPE,"And we all see you, in our minds' eye,"
523,TO THE POPE,Seated benevolently upon your throne
524,TO THE POPE,Giving people blessings;
525,TO THE POPE,Or walking in the Vatican Garden
526,TO THE POPE,Clothed on with simple white.
527,TO THE POPE,"We all think of you, my beloved Pope,"
528,TO THE POPE,As a diaphanous and dear old gentleman
529,TO THE POPE,Whose intentions are the kindest in the world.
530,TO THE POPE,"And yet, and yet, and yet--"
531,TO THE POPE,The memory of Smithfield
532,TO THE POPE,So rages in our honest British blood
533,TO THE POPE,"That, in spite of your white garments"
534,TO THE POPE,"And your placid, gentle ways,"
535,TO THE POPE,"We feel quite sure that you do carry,"
536,TO THE POPE,"Somewhere about your person,"
537,TO THE POPE,A box of matches;
538,TO THE POPE,"And that, if certain people had their way,"
539,TO THE POPE,You would soon be lighting such a candle in England
540,TO THE POPE,That we should want a new Foxe
541,TO THE POPE,And a new Book of Martyrs
542,TO THE POPE,Of about the size of a pantechnicon.
543,TO THE POPE,"Hence it is, my dear Pope,"
544,TO THE POPE,That we--er--Englishmen remain Protestant
545,TO THE POPE,And make the King swear fearful oaths
546,TO THE POPE,"Against popery and all its works,"
547,TO THE POPE,"Although, for aught one knows to the contrary,"
548,TO THE POPE,He may have Mass said twice daily
549,TO THE POPE,"Behind the curtain, as it were."
550,TO THE POPE,"All the same, I wish you good wishes"
551,TO THE POPE,As to this your Jubilee
552,TO THE POPE,And
553,TO THE POPE,_Nihil obstat_.
554,TO THE POPE,
555,TO THE POPE,

558,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN
559,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
560,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,(_Touching his Audience of the King_)
561,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
562,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"My dear Mr. Chamberlain,"
563,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Since you last heard from me,"
564,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Many curious things have happened,"
565,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Both in Birmingham and abroad.
566,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"As to the happenings in Birmingham,"
567,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Nobody cares tuppence for them.
568,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"The happenings abroad, however, are a different matter,"
569,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Inasmuch as they have brought you great fame,"
570,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,And cost us a lot of money.
571,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Your influence in the governance of this great country,"
572,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"my dear Mr. Chamberlain,"
573,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Is undoubted.
574,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"When you say things,"
575,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,It is understood that all your fellow-ministers
576,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Sit up and look good.
577,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"""We don't like it,"" they say in their decent hearts;"
578,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"""But Joseph says it must be so, and be so it must."""
579,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"To the delicate souls of Arthur James,"
580,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"And George, and Broddy, and the rest of 'em,"
581,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"You must, my dear Mr. Chamberlain, be a good deal of a trial,"
582,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"But, somehow, they have to put up with you,"
583,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Even as the honest martyr has to put up with his shirt;
584,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"And, for my own part, I rather like to see it:"
585,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"At any rate, in a sort of way, don't you know."
586,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"But, my dear Mr. Chamberlain,"
587,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"In the daily papers of Monday morning,"
588,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"What did I read?  Why, I read:"
589,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"""Mr. Chamberlain had an audience of the King"
590,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Yesterday afternoon."""
591,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,And yesterday afternoon was Sunday afternoon.
592,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Now, my dear Joseph, I do not mind in the least"
593,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"What you do to Arthur James,"
594,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Or what you do to George,"
595,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Or what you do to Broddy,"
596,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Or whether you do it on Sunday afternoons,"
597,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Or on any other afternoon.
598,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"But I really must draw the line somewhere,"
599,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,And I wish you to understand
600,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,That if you go to see His Majesty the King
601,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,On Sunday afternoons
602,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"(On the afternoon of the Sabbath, as they would say in Birmingham),"
603,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,You do so entirely without my approval.
604,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"I think it is scandalous, and, not being a politician,"
605,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,I have no hesitation in saying what I think.
606,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Somehow, while I know you to be a competent man of business,"
607,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"You never figure in my mind's eye, Joseph,"
608,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,As the sort of man who ought to have
609,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Personal communication with his Sovereign,"
610,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Particularly on Sunday afternoons.
611,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Birmingham men were not born to grace the Court;
612,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"And, when it comes to the furnishing of Pleasant Sunday Afternoons"
613,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"for Monarchs,"
614,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"In my opinion, they are quite out of it."
615,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"When business presses,"
616,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"As it no doubt did press on Sunday, Joseph,"
617,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"It is your business, as a Birmingham man,"
618,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"To remember your origin,"
619,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"And, if you have anything on your mind"
620,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,Which really must be communicated
621,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"To His Gracious Majesty King Edward the Seventh,"
622,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,To look up the peerage and send round somebody
623,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Who is, as one might say, fit for the job."
624,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"There is always Salisbury,"
625,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"There is always Arthur James,"
626,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"There is always George,"
627,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,And there is always Broddy:
628,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"These men, my dear Joseph, are gentlemen,"
629,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,And have known the Court all their lives.
630,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,What they do on Sundays I neither know nor care
631,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"But I have no doubt that, if you told them to go round and"
632,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"see the King,"
633,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,They would go hotfoot and see him.
634,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"So that you have no excuse, Joseph."
635,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"Birmingham will, no doubt, forgive you this once:"
636,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,"As for me, I solemnly swear that I never will."
637,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
638,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
639,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
640,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
641,TO THE TSAR,TO THE TSAR
642,TO THE TSAR,
643,TO THE TSAR,(_After Dunkirk_)
644,TO THE TSAR,
645,TO THE TSAR,"My dear Tsar,--"
646,TO THE TSAR,I am owing you
647,TO THE TSAR,The usual apologies.
648,TO THE TSAR,"I did not come to Dunkirk,"
649,TO THE TSAR,"I did not come to Dunkirk,"
650,TO THE TSAR,I did not come to Dunkirk;
651,TO THE TSAR,"I was billed as usual,"
652,TO THE TSAR,But at the last moment
653,TO THE TSAR,I did not come.
654,TO THE TSAR,"So that it was in vain, my dear Tsar,"
655,TO THE TSAR,That you and your Imperial spouse
656,TO THE TSAR,"(To whom I offer my very humble duty),"
657,TO THE TSAR,It was in vain
658,TO THE TSAR,That you and your Imperial spouse
659,TO THE TSAR,(To whom I again offer my very humble duty)
660,TO THE TSAR,Searched the poop of _La Marguerite_
661,TO THE TSAR,With your Imperial binoculars;
662,TO THE TSAR,"I was not there,"
663,TO THE TSAR,"I was not there,"
664,TO THE TSAR,(O pregnant phrase!)
665,TO THE TSAR,I was not there;
666,TO THE TSAR,"I was not on the poop,"
667,TO THE TSAR,"I was not on the poop,"
668,TO THE TSAR,"I was not on the poop,"
669,TO THE TSAR,"I was not even abaft the binnacle,"
670,TO THE TSAR,"In fine, I was not there at all."
671,TO THE TSAR,And why?
672,TO THE TSAR,"Ah, ingrate that I am,"
673,TO THE TSAR,Why?  O why?
674,TO THE TSAR,"The North Sea or German Ocean, my dear Tsar,"
675,TO THE TSAR,"No doubt hath its pearls,"
676,TO THE TSAR,"It also hath other things,"
677,TO THE TSAR,"As, for example, a Dover-Ostend route."
678,TO THE TSAR,I went on that route
679,TO THE TSAR,On Saturday last;
680,TO THE TSAR,"It is a nice route,"
681,TO THE TSAR,I give you my word for it;
682,TO THE TSAR,But the North Sea or German Ocean
683,TO THE TSAR,Also has
684,TO THE TSAR,"An Ostend-Dover route,"
685,TO THE TSAR,On which route I went
686,TO THE TSAR,On Sunday evening
687,TO THE TSAR,And part of Monday morning last.
688,TO THE TSAR,"Five hours, my dear Tsar,"
689,TO THE TSAR,Had I of that Ostend-Dover route;
690,TO THE TSAR,And I am now at a place called Thame
691,TO THE TSAR,"In Oxfordshire,"
692,TO THE TSAR,Recruiting--
693,TO THE TSAR,"Though I promised a man at Bruges,"
694,TO THE TSAR,"And another man at Ypres,"
695,TO THE TSAR,That I would infallibly see him
696,TO THE TSAR,At Dunkirk.
697,TO THE TSAR,"The Loubets are, of course,"
698,TO THE TSAR,"Bitterly disappointed,"
699,TO THE TSAR,"But you can explain for me,"
700,TO THE TSAR,"Can you not, my dear Tsar?"
701,TO THE TSAR,"You understand,"
702,TO THE TSAR,Do you not?
703,TO THE TSAR,The North Sea or German Ocean
704,TO THE TSAR,"Fatigued you,"
705,TO THE TSAR,Did it not?
706,TO THE TSAR,That is precisely what it did to me.
707,TO THE TSAR,Fatigue is a good word.
708,TO THE TSAR,"I thank thee, Tsar, for that beautiful word fatigue."
709,TO THE TSAR,All day Monday I felt so fatigued
710,TO THE TSAR,That I went and joined a Peace Society.
711,TO THE TSAR,"The Boer war, my dear Tsar,"
712,TO THE TSAR,"Is entirely over,"
713,TO THE TSAR,So far as I am concerned;
714,TO THE TSAR,Henceforth I quarrel with no man.
715,TO THE TSAR,Fatigue has laid its heavy hand upon me;
716,TO THE TSAR,I am too much fatigued to quarrel even with the partner of my joys
717,TO THE TSAR,and sorrows.
718,TO THE TSAR,"Peace, perfect peace,"
719,TO THE TSAR,"Is what I require,"
720,TO THE TSAR,And what I mean having.
721,TO THE TSAR,Time writes no wrinkles on the Ostend-Dover route.
722,TO THE TSAR,But you should see the people who have been that way.
723,TO THE TSAR,"Thame, in Oxfordshire,"
724,TO THE TSAR,Pitches beneath my feet
725,TO THE TSAR,When I think of it.
726,TO THE TSAR,
727,TO THE TSAR,
728,TO THE TSAR,
729,TO THE TSAR,
730,TO DAN LENO,TO DAN LENO
731,TO DAN LENO,
732,TO DAN LENO,"Dear Mr. Leno,"
733,TO DAN LENO,It is now many happy weeks
734,TO DAN LENO,Since I had the pleasure of addressing you.
735,TO DAN LENO,"On the last occasion, you will remember,"
736,TO DAN LENO,"You were fresh from Sandringham,"
737,TO DAN LENO,With a medal and sundry excellent stories
738,TO DAN LENO,As to the manner in which you had been received
739,TO DAN LENO,By His Majesty the King
740,TO DAN LENO,And the Members of the Royal Family.
741,TO DAN LENO,"""To see them laugh,"" you told us, ""was a treat."""
742,TO DAN LENO,Since then you have gone about
743,TO DAN LENO,"With a diamond ""E"" in your cravat,"
744,TO DAN LENO,"And ""The King's Jester"" written all over you"
745,TO DAN LENO,"As I have already stated,"
746,TO DAN LENO,I do not doubt for a moment
747,TO DAN LENO,That the King really did laugh
748,TO DAN LENO,At Mr. Leno.
749,TO DAN LENO,I have laughed at him
750,TO DAN LENO,"(That is to say, at Mr. Leno) myself,"
751,TO DAN LENO,And I know what it is;
752,TO DAN LENO,"But to-day, Mr. Leno,"
753,TO DAN LENO,"To-day being the 1st of April,"
754,TO DAN LENO,"It is my turn to laugh,"
755,TO DAN LENO,"And I do so with a right good will,"
756,TO DAN LENO,"For to-day, Mr. Leno,"
757,TO DAN LENO,"Your cup appears to be full,"
758,TO DAN LENO,Inasmuch as for this day only
759,TO DAN LENO,You are actually editing a paper!
760,TO DAN LENO,Now when a man takes to editing papers
761,TO DAN LENO,All is over with him:
762,TO DAN LENO,The next step is
763,TO DAN LENO,Into the unutterable dark.
764,TO DAN LENO,"I have read your paper, Mr. Leno,"
765,TO DAN LENO,And I find that on the whole
766,TO DAN LENO,It has been remarkably well edited:
767,TO DAN LENO,"That is to say, you as Editor"
768,TO DAN LENO,"And your big co-editor,"
769,TO DAN LENO,"Mr. Campbell of that ilk,"
770,TO DAN LENO,Have had the good sense
771,TO DAN LENO,To edit the paper
772,TO DAN LENO,In the only way in which an editor
773,TO DAN LENO,"Should edit a paper,"
774,TO DAN LENO,"Namely, by leaving it to itself"
775,TO DAN LENO,As much as possible.
776,TO DAN LENO,If all editors would have the sense
777,TO DAN LENO,"To take this wise course,"
778,TO DAN LENO,"Contributors and subordinates, generally,"
779,TO DAN LENO,"Would, to say the least of it,"
780,TO DAN LENO,Have a fairly happy life.
781,TO DAN LENO,"It seems in a way a pity, Mr. Leno,"
782,TO DAN LENO,That you should waste yourself
783,TO DAN LENO,"Upon an evening paper,"
784,TO DAN LENO,When there are so many morning papers
785,TO DAN LENO,Requiring Editors:
786,TO DAN LENO,"The _Daily Chronicle_, for example,"
787,TO DAN LENO,Would have offered you a fair field
788,TO DAN LENO,For the exercise of your extraordinary abilities;
789,TO DAN LENO,"Even the _Times_ might, for once in a way,"
790,TO DAN LENO,Have added lustre to itself
791,TO DAN LENO,By taking on
792,TO DAN LENO,Your joyous and winning lucubrations;
793,TO DAN LENO,"Then there is _Punch_,"
794,TO DAN LENO,"Which journal, I understand,"
795,TO DAN LENO,Is always (and still) on the look-out
796,TO DAN LENO,For that humour
797,TO DAN LENO,Which somehow never comes its way.
798,TO DAN LENO,"But there, Mr. Leno,"
799,TO DAN LENO,"You have missed your chance,"
800,TO DAN LENO,And possibly it will not come round again.
801,TO DAN LENO,"As you are young in journalism,"
802,TO DAN LENO,Let me say three things to you:
803,TO DAN LENO,"Imprimis, never be an Editor,"
804,TO DAN LENO,It is better to be in the ballet;
805,TO DAN LENO,"Item, always be on either a morning paper or a weekly."
806,TO DAN LENO,The all-day papers keep one too busy.
807,TO DAN LENO,"Item, if you are an editor only for a day,"
808,TO DAN LENO,Be sure to subscribe to the Newspaper Press Fund;
809,TO DAN LENO,"Otherwise, what will your widow do?"
810,TO DAN LENO,
811,TO DAN LENO,
812,TO DAN LENO,
813,TO DAN LENO,
814,TO THE POET LAUREATE,TO THE POET LAUREATE
815,TO THE POET LAUREATE,
816,TO THE POET LAUREATE,"My dear Poet Laureate,--"
817,TO THE POET LAUREATE,"Do not, I implore you,"
818,TO THE POET LAUREATE,Be perturbed.
819,TO THE POET LAUREATE,It is not my purpose to harp
820,TO THE POET LAUREATE,"Upon old strings,"
821,TO THE POET LAUREATE,Or to express the smallest satisfaction
822,TO THE POET LAUREATE,Either with you as an official personage
823,TO THE POET LAUREATE,Or with your verses as a production of an official personage;
824,TO THE POET LAUREATE,"I have called to-day, as it were,"
825,TO THE POET LAUREATE,For a little quiet talk:
826,TO THE POET LAUREATE,"You are a fellow-townsman of mine,"
827,TO THE POET LAUREATE,Consequently
828,TO THE POET LAUREATE,I am a fellow-townsman of yours;
829,TO THE POET LAUREATE,We ought to get on well together.

1097,TO A PUBLISHER,"My dear Sir,--"
1098,TO A PUBLISHER,In the whole round
1099,TO A PUBLISHER,Of animated nature
1100,TO A PUBLISHER,I am acquainted
1101,TO A PUBLISHER,With nothing or nobody
1102,TO A PUBLISHER,"Who is, generally speaking,"
1103,TO A PUBLISHER,"So gay, gaudy, and interesting"
1104,TO A PUBLISHER,As yourself.
1105,TO A PUBLISHER,From my youth up
1106,TO A PUBLISHER,I have been taught to look upon a publisher
1107,TO A PUBLISHER,As a very great person indeed.
1108,TO A PUBLISHER,When I was young and courted him
1109,TO A PUBLISHER,He it was drew from me
1110,TO A PUBLISHER,(As morn from Memnon)
1111,TO A PUBLISHER,Rivers of melody;
1112,TO A PUBLISHER,"The which, however,"
1113,TO A PUBLISHER,He took good care
1114,TO A PUBLISHER,Not to glorify with his imprimatur.
1115,TO A PUBLISHER,In those days
1116,TO A PUBLISHER,I looked upon publishing as a trade
1117,TO A PUBLISHER,And poetry as a profession.
1118,TO A PUBLISHER,"Recently I have become wise,"
1119,TO A PUBLISHER,And I feel in the heart of me
1120,TO A PUBLISHER,That publishing is a profession
1121,TO A PUBLISHER,And poetry a trade.
1122,TO A PUBLISHER,"In spite of all that has been said to the contrary,"
1123,TO A PUBLISHER,Barabbas
1124,TO A PUBLISHER,Certainly was not a publisher.
1125,TO A PUBLISHER,"I have not had time to look him up,"
1126,TO A PUBLISHER,But I feel quite sure
1127,TO A PUBLISHER,That he was not a professional man.
1128,TO A PUBLISHER,"Besides,"
1129,TO A PUBLISHER,"If he was a publisher,"
1130,TO A PUBLISHER,Why did he not publish something?
1131,TO A PUBLISHER,Echo and the Publishers' Association
1132,TO A PUBLISHER,No doubt answer
1133,TO A PUBLISHER,"""Why?"""
1134,TO A PUBLISHER,I sometimes think I should like to be a publisher myself.
1135,TO A PUBLISHER,It must be rather nice
1136,TO A PUBLISHER,To know for a fact
1137,TO A PUBLISHER,How many copies
1138,TO A PUBLISHER,"Mr. So-and-so, and Mr. So-and-so, and Mr. So-and-so"
1139,TO A PUBLISHER,"Really do sell,"
1140,TO A PUBLISHER,"And how many ""A second large edition"""
1141,TO A PUBLISHER,"And ""Tenth impression"""
1142,TO A PUBLISHER,Really mean.
1143,TO A PUBLISHER,"It must be rather nice, also,"
1144,TO A PUBLISHER,To go off to Switzerland every year
1145,TO A PUBLISHER,(With your wife)
1146,TO A PUBLISHER,To attend the Publishers' Conference.
1147,TO A PUBLISHER,"It must be rather nice, too,"
1148,TO A PUBLISHER,To know of a surety
1149,TO A PUBLISHER,That when an author is making money
1150,TO A PUBLISHER,Some publisher or other
1151,TO A PUBLISHER,"Is making just as much,"
1152,TO A PUBLISHER,"And not infrequently a trifle more,"
1153,TO A PUBLISHER,On the same work.
1154,TO A PUBLISHER,We have learnt of late
1155,TO A PUBLISHER,Greatly to our disgust
1156,TO A PUBLISHER,That when a publisher dies rich
1157,TO A PUBLISHER,He has made his money out of Apollinaris.
1158,TO A PUBLISHER,"This is hard on authors,"
1159,TO A PUBLISHER,"Who, between ourselves,"
1160,TO A PUBLISHER,"Are not by any means bad people,"
1161,TO A PUBLISHER,And invariably take a kindly interest
1162,TO A PUBLISHER,In their publishers' welfare.
1163,TO A PUBLISHER,"On the other hand,"
1164,TO A PUBLISHER,"You must admit, sir,"
1165,TO A PUBLISHER,"That a publisher seldom goes bankrupt,"
1166,TO A PUBLISHER,And does not as a rule sleep
1167,TO A PUBLISHER,Under his own counter.
1168,TO A PUBLISHER,Once
1169,TO A PUBLISHER,I lent a publisher half a crown.
1170,TO A PUBLISHER,He paid it back.
1171,TO A PUBLISHER,The average author would have taken it
1172,TO A PUBLISHER,As money earned.
1173,TO A PUBLISHER,"So that, on the whole,"
1174,TO A PUBLISHER,"I am inclined to like publishers,"
1175,TO A PUBLISHER,And to set them down in my tablets
1176,TO A PUBLISHER,For
1177,TO A PUBLISHER,Useful persons.

1212,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"There is not a dry eye about the place,"
1213,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Every man present knows what I mean,"
1214,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And his heart is touched accordingly.
1215,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Sir,"
1216,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"My dear Sir,"
1217,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You also know what I mean;
1218,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"In other words, you know"
1219,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"That I am the victim of a convention,"
1220,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"And that, when all is said that can be said,"
1221,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You are the author of that convention.
1222,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,As to the nature of that convention
1223,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,We will put it this way:
1224,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,One pound of steak
1225,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,To the actual consumer
1226,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Should cost, say, 1s. 2d."
1227,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Trimmings
1228,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"In the way of potatoes and peas might cost, say, 6d.,"
1229,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Bread, 1d.,"
1230,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Pepper, salt, and mustard, 1d."
1231,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"(You will notice that I put a princely price on everything),"
1232,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Total, 1s. 10d."
1233,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Fifty per cent. profit for you, let us say,"
1234,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Would bring us up to 2s. 9d.
1235,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Really you ought to let one off for 2s. 9d.,"
1236,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,But what do you do?
1237,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Well,"
1238,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"So far as I can gather from your bills,"
1239,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You lie awake at night
1240,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Debating with yourself
1241,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Whether you should charge one 3s. 6d. or 4s. 6d.
1242,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And you usually come to the conclusion
1243,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,That it will be best
1244,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,For all parties concerned
1245,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,To charge one 5s.
1246,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"If one expostulates,"
1247,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You remark
1248,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,With hauteur
1249,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,That you thought you were dealing with a gentleman.
1250,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You are quite correct in this surmise.
1251,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,But--
1252,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"One pays,"
1253,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And you pocket the difference.
1254,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Then, again, on one's bill"
1255,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You put
1256,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Bed, 7s. 6d."
1257,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Which is cheap;
1258,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And I do not murmur;
1259,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,But you also put
1260,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Attendance, 2s. 6d.;"
1261,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Coffee in bedroom before rising, 1s.;"
1262,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Bath, 1s. 6d.;"
1263,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"This is just 5s. too much,"
1264,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Especially in view of the fact
1265,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"That the attendance wears dirty shirts,"
1266,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,That the bath
1267,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Is lukewarm if you order it cold
1268,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And lukewarm if you order it hot;
1269,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And that the coffee before rising
1270,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Doesn't cost you a farthing.
1271,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"I am aware, of course,"
1272,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,That all this is very mean
1273,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And low down
1274,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"On my part,"
1275,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,But frankly
1276,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Your rapacity
1277,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Matters not so much to me
1278,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,As to yourself.
1279,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"People come once to your establishment,"
1280,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"They read your bill,"
1281,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Pay your prices
1282,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"And tip your dirty-shirted waiters,"
1283,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And go away
1284,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,_And forget to come back_.
1285,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Hence
1286,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,You are bound to charge
1287,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,The next man that comes along
1288,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"As much extra as he will stand,"
1289,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And by slow degrees
1290,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Your establishment
1291,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Is becoming
1292,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,A by-word
1293,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And a warning.
1294,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"My dear Sir,"
1295,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Have a shilling bottle of wine
1296,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,(For which you charge me 3s. 6d.)
1297,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"At your own expense,"
1298,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,"Consult with your wife,"
1299,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,And make up your mind
1300,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Never to charge
1301,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,More than 2s.
1302,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,For 9d. worth of goods.
1303,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,Honesty is its own reward--
1304,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,It is really.
1305,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,
1306,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,
1307,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,
1308,TO AN HOTEL KEEPER,
1309,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN
1310,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,
1311,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"My dear Sir,--"
1312,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,I suppose you are having an excellent time just now.
1313,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,There are a large number of counties
1314,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"In England and Scotland,"
1315,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And I am not acquainted with one of them
1316,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Wherein your bang-bang
1317,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And puffs of smoke
1318,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And red-faced men with dogs
1319,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Are not to be encountered.
1320,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,You like it;
1321,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,It is very nice;
1322,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"And really, when you come to think of it,"
1323,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,It is what the counties were made for.
1324,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,In the history books
1325,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,They were wont to say
1326,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"Of a certain Norman monarch,"
1327,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,That he loved the red deer
1328,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,As if he were their brother.
1329,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Of you it may safely be said
1330,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,That you love the red grouse
1331,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And the brown partridge.
1332,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,As if you were a poulterer.
1333,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,You are a sportsman.
1334,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,The man who first went out with a gun
1335,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,To shoot game
1336,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Probably did it on the sly.
1337,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Had he been caught
1338,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,He would no doubt have been regarded
1339,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,By the sportsmen of his day
1340,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,With the same contempt
1341,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,That you yourself indulge
1342,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"For the unprincipled blackguard, Sir,"
1343,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Who shoots foxes.
1344,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,But time and the gunsmiths
1345,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Have changed all that;
1346,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"And now you are a sportsman,"
1347,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,A shooter of birds
1348,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,For the London market.
1349,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"You are also a gunner,"
1350,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And you kill things.
1351,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Oh! why do you not go
1352,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And live at Gunners-bury?
1353,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Bad joke?
1354,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"Well, I know it is."
1355,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"But I assure you, my dear Sir,"
1356,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,That it is not half so bad as I can make them
1357,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,When I try.
1358,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,To come now to the region
1359,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"Of practical politics,"
1360,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,Let me explain to you right off
1361,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"That, despite all that has been said against you"
1362,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,By people who are mad about the Land
1363,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"And the Game-laws,"
1364,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,And the feathered kingdom
1365,TO THE MAN WITH A GUN,"And so forth,"
1366,"I,","I,"
1367,"I,","Who am always on the side of wisdom,"
1368,"I,",Have discovered a justification for you.
1369,"I,",It is this:
1370,"I,",There has been a great demand of late
1371,"I,",For really competent shots.
1372,"I,",In response to that demand
1373,"I,",Mr. Kipling has started a village rifle club.
1374,"I,",I understand that the members thereof
1375,"I,","Are, let us say, five hundred in number."
1376,"I,","Now, I put it to you, Sir,"
1377,"I,",How many sportsmen are there
1378,"I,",Shooting in this beautiful country and Scotland
1379,"I,",To-day?
1380,"I,","Well, we will not compute;"
1381,"I,",It is dangerous.
1382,"I,",But you could make a fairly big rifle club out of them.
1383,"I,","They are all good men,"
1384,"I,",And of course all beautiful shots.
1385,"I,",Some day
1386,"I,",(When the war is over)
1387,"I,",England may want them.
1388,"I,",Will they answer to the call?
1389,"I,","My dear Sir,"
1390,"I,",You have your uses.
1391,"I,",Go in peace.
1392,"I,",
1393,"I,",
1394,"I,",
1395,"I,",
1396,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE
1397,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,
1398,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,(_On its Centenary_)
1399,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,
1400,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"My dear Stock Exchange,--"
1401,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,I am given to understand
1402,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"That to-day you are a hundred years old,"
1403,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And that to-day therefore
1404,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,You will celebrate
1405,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,What nine men out of every ten of you
1406,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Call your ""Cen_teen_ary"""
1407,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,By taking a whole holiday instead of a half one.
1408,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"It would be easy for me, my dear Stock Exchange,"
1409,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,To present you
1410,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,With a sort of illuminated address on this occasion;
1411,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,But I refrain.
1412,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,One short year ago
1413,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,I tumbled into a little money;
1414,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"It was ""not enough to live upon,"""
1415,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,But it was a nice sum.
1416,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"A man introduced me to a member of the Stock Exchange,"
1417,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,The member of the Stock Exchange introduced me to a little game
1418,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"of ""in and out,"""
1419,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And my five hundred pounds folded its tents like the Arabs--
1420,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"That is to say, it silently stole away."
1421,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,It was not the member of the Stock Exchange's fault;
1422,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Certainly it was not my fault;
1423,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And I will not say that it was the fault of the Stock Exchange.
1424,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,But I am not giving the Stock Exchange
1425,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Any illuminated addresses
1426,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,At present.
1427,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"On the other hand, let me assure you"
1428,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,That I believe the Stock Exchange
1429,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"To be a highly respectable,"
1430,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Honourable,"
1431,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And useful institution.
1432,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,It leaves the court without a stain upon its character.
1433,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"I say these latter things advisedly,"
1434,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Because some time back
1435,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,A friend of mine who writes articles on food supply
1436,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Having delivered himself of the opinion
1437,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"That London's milk was largely water,"
1438,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Was sued for slander
1439,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"By the Amalgamated Society of Dairymen's Daughters,"
1440,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And had to climb down and apologise.
1441,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"So that on the whole I repeat that, in my humble opinion,"
1442,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,If you want to find
1443,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Really sound, white men,"
1444,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Men of spotless character and impregnable probity,"
1445,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,You cannot do better
1446,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Than wend your way to Gorgonzola Hall.
1447,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"And joking apart, my dear Stock Exchange,"
1448,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,You really are a blessing.
1449,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,If it were not for you
1450,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"People with a lot of money,"
1451,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"And people with only a little,"
1452,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Would simply not lose it.
1453,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,It would lie in banks and old stockings and kindred receptacles
1454,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Till it went mouldy.
1455,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,You keep things going.
1456,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"You are the heart of the monetary world,"
1457,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"You pump in the gold,"
1458,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,You pump out all that you don't happen to want.
1459,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"And you go and live in Maida Vale,"
1460,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Keep a butler,"
1461,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Drive two horses,"
1462,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,And change your name from Manassah to Howard.
1463,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"This ""Cen_teen_ary"" holiday of yours"
1464,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,Gives me much pause.
1465,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"Supposing, instead of taking a day,"
1466,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,"You were to take a year,"
1467,TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE,What would happen to England?
1468,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!
1469,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,"Yeth, indeed."
1470,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,
1471,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,
1472,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,
1473,SHE--WOULD--BE--RUINED!,
1474,TO THE LORD MAYOR,TO THE LORD MAYOR
1475,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1476,TO THE LORD MAYOR,(_November 9th_)
1477,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1478,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"My dear Lord Mayor,--"
1479,TO THE LORD MAYOR,In Fleet Street all is gay
1480,TO THE LORD MAYOR,From min' office window I catch glimpses
1481,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Of fluttering bunting and swinging festoons.
1482,TO THE LORD MAYOR,I don't know who pays for them
1483,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"(The bunting and the festoons, that is to say),"
1484,TO THE LORD MAYOR,But I am informed by the police that they
1485,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"(The bunting and the festoons, that is to say)"
1486,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Have been hung up in honour of YOU.
1487,TO THE LORD MAYOR,I am also given to understand that there has been a big rush
1488,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"For free windows to view your procession,"
1489,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Which, all being well (the Procession, that is to say)"
1490,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Will take place this day, Saturday;"
1491,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"For my own part I am going into the country,"
1492,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And I dare say that on the whole
1493,TO THE LORD MAYOR,You wish you were going with me;
1494,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"But ambition has its penalties,"
1495,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And if you will become Lord Mayor of London
1496,TO THE LORD MAYOR,(A dizzy pinnacle to which none but the biggest-souled of us
1497,TO THE LORD MAYOR,May aspire)
1498,TO THE LORD MAYOR,I suppose you must put up with the attendant inconveniences
1499,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And publicity.
1500,TO THE LORD MAYOR,So far as I have been able to judge
1501,TO THE LORD MAYOR,(And I arrive at this conclusion by dint of steadfast abstinence
1502,TO THE LORD MAYOR,From witnessing Lord Mayors' Shows)
1503,TO THE LORD MAYOR,A Lord Mayor's Show is a distinctly inspiriting spectacle.
1504,TO THE LORD MAYOR,It may be set down
1505,TO THE LORD MAYOR,As the Londoner's one annual opportunity
1506,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Of seeing a circus for nothing;
1507,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Hence no doubt its popularity.
1508,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Think not, however, my dear Lord Mayor,"
1509,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"That I deprecate your little pageant, gratis though it be."
1510,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"This country, as everybody knows,"
1511,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Has for centuries past been on the high road to ruin,"
1512,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"And, in my humble opinion, its decadence has been largely due"
1513,TO THE LORD MAYOR,To a deep-rooted tendency on the part of the powerful
1514,TO THE LORD MAYOR,To curtail and do away with mayoral and other shows.
1515,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Feasts and fairs have been kicked out of England
1516,TO THE LORD MAYOR,By the aforesaid powerful:
1517,TO THE LORD MAYOR,If you would be a respectable community
1518,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"You must have neither feast nor fair,"
1519,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"And, if you would be a respectable citizen of any given city,"
1520,TO THE LORD MAYOR,You must not array yourself in motley.
1521,TO THE LORD MAYOR,A man who walked into his bank
1522,TO THE LORD MAYOR,In yellow trousers and a blue silk hat
1523,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Would never be allowed an overdraft,"
1524,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Black and subdued greens and browns being the only wear
1525,TO THE LORD MAYOR,For persons who would get on in life.
1526,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"All this is wrong, my dear Lord Mayor."
1527,TO THE LORD MAYOR,I am of opinion that millionaires
1528,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Ought to wear purple breeches;
1529,TO THE LORD MAYOR,I see no reason why I myself
1530,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Should not have a morning coat of red, white, and blue,"
1531,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Or a waistcoat emblazoned with the arms
1532,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Of the Worshipful Company of Spectaclemakers.
1533,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"In fact, my dear Lord Mayor,"
1534,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"To perpetrate a Mrs. Meynellism,"
1535,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"The colour of life is the salt of it,"
1536,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Just as the Lord Mayor's Show is the salt of the Lord Mayoralty
1537,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And the one beautiful thing
1538,TO THE LORD MAYOR,About life as people expect you to live it
1539,TO THE LORD MAYOR,In the Metropolis.
1540,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Come hither, come hither, my dear Lord Mayor,"
1541,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And do not tremble so!
1542,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"We are all glad to see you going up Fleet Street,"
1543,TO THE LORD MAYOR,We are all glad to see you going home the other way;
1544,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And we shall be equally glad to see your successor
1545,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Getting through the same flowerful day's work
1546,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Next year.
1547,TO THE LORD MAYOR,"Goodbye, my dear Lord Mayor!"
1548,TO THE LORD MAYOR,And
1549,TO THE LORD MAYOR,Hooray?
1550,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1551,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1552,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1553,TO THE LORD MAYOR,
1554,TO THE MOTORIST,TO THE MOTORIST
1555,TO THE MOTORIST,
1556,TO THE MOTORIST,"My dear Sir,--"
1557,TO THE MOTORIST,"When men have nightmares, they dream about you."
1558,TO THE MOTORIST,I myself have been chased over the tops of pinnacles
1559,TO THE MOTORIST,By flaming-eyed Panhards and Durkopps
1560,TO THE MOTORIST,In my sleep.
1561,TO THE MOTORIST,"Nor is this all,"
1562,TO THE MOTORIST,For if one brings oneself
1563,TO THE MOTORIST,To read reports of the proceedings of police courts
1564,TO THE MOTORIST,One finds that the average citizen
1565,TO THE MOTORIST,"Gets more or less chased by you sir,"
1566,TO THE MOTORIST,In his waking moments.
1567,TO THE MOTORIST,"The Police I know, sir, seldom speak the truth:"
1568,TO THE MOTORIST,They remember so well the day
1569,TO THE MOTORIST,When a horseless carriage had to be taken through the street
1570,TO THE MOTORIST,"At the speed of a funeral march,"
1571,TO THE MOTORIST,"And with a red flag in front of it,"
1572,TO THE MOTORIST,That the spectacle of an affable motorist
1573,TO THE MOTORIST,Bowling through a Surrey village
1574,TO THE MOTORIST,To the tune of six miles an hour
1575,TO THE MOTORIST,"Shocks ther imagination,"
1576,TO THE MOTORIST,And they believe for the rest of their natural lives
1577,TO THE MOTORIST,That the affable motorist aforesaid
1578,TO THE MOTORIST,Must have been travelling
1579,TO THE MOTORIST,At the rate of anything from 60 to 600 miles per minute.
1580,TO THE MOTORIST,"Hence, my dear motorist,"
1581,TO THE MOTORIST,It comes to pass that you are afforded so many opportunities
1582,TO THE MOTORIST,For airing your eloquence and the fatness of your purse
1583,TO THE MOTORIST,Before the police magistrates.
1584,TO THE MOTORIST,In my opinion it seems just possible
1585,TO THE MOTORIST,That the real trouble lies in the fact
1586,TO THE MOTORIST,"That you, my dear sir, do actually"
1587,TO THE MOTORIST,"Go through villages at a very low speed,"
1588,TO THE MOTORIST,And that really the best thing you can do
1589,TO THE MOTORIST,Would be to make a point of going through them
1590,TO THE MOTORIST,At the highest speed consistent
1591,TO THE MOTORIST,With the safety of your own person.
1592,TO THE MOTORIST,"For if you did this,"
1593,TO THE MOTORIST,"No policeman of my acquaintance would be able to catch you,"
1594,TO THE MOTORIST,Hence you would never be fined.
1595,TO THE MOTORIST,I have been out of sympathy with motor cars
1596,TO THE MOTORIST,Right up to the other night.
1597,TO THE MOTORIST,The other night I had the felicity to take a small trip on one.
1598,TO THE MOTORIST,"The motorist would fain have driven me to my house,"
1599,TO THE MOTORIST,Which is half an hour's cab drive from Charing Cross.
1600,TO THE MOTORIST,He offered to do the distance in ten minutes
1601,TO THE MOTORIST,"And started stirring up his petroleum,"
1602,TO THE MOTORIST,"But I said ""No.  Let us go to the Marble Arch."""
1603,TO THE MOTORIST,"We went through the Mall, to Hyde Park Corner,"
1604,TO THE MOTORIST,"to South Kensington, to Paddington,"
1605,TO THE MOTORIST,"Into the Edgware Road, and so to the Marble Arch;"
1606,TO THE MOTORIST,"Time, at the outside, 15 min."
1607,TO THE MOTORIST,I am willing to admit
1608,TO THE MOTORIST,"That we went down certain streets quite rapidly,"
1609,TO THE MOTORIST,"What time the policemen at odd corners stared stupidly,"
1610,TO THE MOTORIST,And fumbled for their note-books.
1611,TO THE MOTORIST,"But, as a result of that trip, my dear sir,"
1612,TO THE MOTORIST,I have become an enthusiastic motorist.
1613,TO THE MOTORIST,I am convinced that speed and wind and the smell of petroleum mixed
1614,TO THE MOTORIST,Is the only thing which can be considered worth living for.
1615,TO THE MOTORIST,And if you happen to know anybody
1616,TO THE MOTORIST,Who would be willing to take
1617,TO THE MOTORIST,A typewriter and a pair of skates (not much worn)
1618,TO THE MOTORIST,"In exchange for a Durkopp racer,"
1619,TO THE MOTORIST,Kindly communicate with me.

1624,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS
1625,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,
1626,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"My dear Next Christmas,--"
1627,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"It is an excellent journalistic thing,"
1628,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Not to say a poetical thing,"
1629,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,To be first in the field.
1630,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Behold me, therefore, advancing"
1631,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,At the head of that motley army
1632,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Which will inevitably hail you
1633,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,When your time comes.
1634,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"For your predecessor,"
1635,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"My dear Next Christmas,"
1636,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,I cannot say much.
1637,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,He came in with several thousand inches of rain;
1638,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,He went out on a watery moon.
1639,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"There was turkey as usual,"
1640,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Pudding as usual,"
1641,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Mistletoe as usual,"
1642,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Peace on earth as usual.
1643,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"There were also the waits,"
1644,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"The young folks,"
1645,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"The postman,"
1646,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,The dustman
1647,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"(No connection with the scavengers),"
1648,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And the turncock.
1649,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,We had a merry day.
1650,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Half the world pretended to be happy,"
1651,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,The other half pretended to be bored.
1652,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"The festivities, I understand,"
1653,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Are still being kept up.
1654,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,There is a ping-pong tournament at the Queen's Hall
1655,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And a children's banquet
1656,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,At the Guildhall on Tuesday evening;
1657,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Not to mention Mr. Dan Leno at Drury Lane
1658,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And Mr. De Wet at the Tweefontein.
1659,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,It is all very cheerful
1660,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And very inspiriting.
1661,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"All the same,"
1662,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let us not repine:
1663,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Christmas comes but once a year,"
1664,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"And it will come again, I fear."
1665,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"This couplet, of course."
1666,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"My dear Next Christmas,"
1667,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Is not intended to be
1668,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Disrespectful to you;
1669,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,It is inserted simply
1670,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,For the sake of effect.
1671,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,For I never miss an opportunity
1672,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Of bursting into rhyme.
1673,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,When the way is plain before me.
1674,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"My dear Next Christmas,"
1675,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Do not be discouraged,"
1676,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Come next year by all means;
1677,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"If I said ""Don't come"""
1678,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,You would come just the same.
1679,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Therefore, I say ""Come,"""
1680,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"And I trust, my dear Next Christmas,"
1681,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,That when you do come
1682,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,You will bring us a little luck.
1683,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Ring out the old, as it were,"
1684,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And ring in the new;
1685,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let candied peel
1686,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Be a trifle cheaper;
1687,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let the war be settled
1688,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,To the satisfaction of both parties;
1689,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let the book trade flourish;
1690,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let the Income-tax be reduced:
1691,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Let there be a fine Christmas Eve
1692,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"And dry waits,"
1693,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And a little skating next morning;
1694,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Let there be peace and plenty,"
1695,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"A pocket full of money,"
1696,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"And a barrel full of beer,"
1697,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"And all other good things,"
1698,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Including a free and enlightened Press,"
1699,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,And a strong demand
1700,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,For seasonable poetry.
1701,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"My dear Next Christmas,"
1702,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,"Here is my hand,"
1703,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,With my heart in it.
1704,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Till we meet again--
1705,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,As Mr. Hall Caine says--
1706,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,Addio.
1707,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,
1708,TO NEXT CHRISTMAS,

1712,TO THE TRIPPER,
1713,TO THE TRIPPER,"My dear Sir, or Madam,--"
1714,TO THE TRIPPER,"When James Watt,"
1715,TO THE TRIPPER,"Or some such person,"
1716,TO THE TRIPPER,Had the luck
1717,TO THE TRIPPER,"To see a kettle boil,"
1718,TO THE TRIPPER,He little dreamed
1719,TO THE TRIPPER,"That he was discovering you,"
1720,TO THE TRIPPER,Otherwise he would have let his kettle boil
1721,TO THE TRIPPER,For a million million years
1722,TO THE TRIPPER,Without saying anything about it.
1723,TO THE TRIPPER,"However,"
1724,TO THE TRIPPER,James Watt
1725,TO THE TRIPPER,"Omitted to take cognisance of the ultimate trouble,"
1726,TO THE TRIPPER,And here you are.
1727,TO THE TRIPPER,"And here, alas! you will stay,"
1728,TO THE TRIPPER,"Till our iron roads are beaten into ploughshares,"
1729,TO THE TRIPPER,And Messrs. Cook & Sons are at rest.
1730,TO THE TRIPPER,"""When I was young, a single man,"
1731,TO THE TRIPPER,"And after youthful follies ran"""
1732,TO THE TRIPPER,"(Which, strange as it may seem, is Wordsworth)"
1733,TO THE TRIPPER,"Your goings to and fro upon the earth,"
1734,TO THE TRIPPER,"And walkings up and down thereon,"
1735,TO THE TRIPPER,Were limited by the day trip.
1736,TO THE TRIPPER,For half-a-crown
1737,TO THE TRIPPER,"You went to Brighton,"
1738,TO THE TRIPPER,"Or to Buxton and Matlock,"
1739,TO THE TRIPPER,"Or Stratford-on-Avon,"
1740,TO THE TRIPPER,As the case may be.
1741,TO THE TRIPPER,A special tap of ale
1742,TO THE TRIPPER,And a special cut of 'am
1743,TO THE TRIPPER,Were put on for your delectation;
1744,TO THE TRIPPER,You sang a mixture of hymns
1745,TO THE TRIPPER,And music-hall songs
1746,TO THE TRIPPER,"On your homeward journey,"
1747,TO THE TRIPPER,And there was an end of the matter.
1748,TO THE TRIPPER,But nowadays there is no escape from you.
1749,TO THE TRIPPER,The trip that was over and done
1750,TO THE TRIPPER,In twenty-four hours at most
1751,TO THE TRIPPER,Has become a matter
1752,TO THE TRIPPER,"Of ""Saturday to Monday at Sunny Saltburn,"""
1753,TO THE TRIPPER,"""Ten days in Lovely Lucerne,"""
1754,TO THE TRIPPER,"And ""A Visit to the Holy Land for Ten Guineas."""
1755,TO THE TRIPPER,Wherever one goes
1756,TO THE TRIPPER,On this wide globe
1757,TO THE TRIPPER,There shall one find
1758,TO THE TRIPPER,Your empty ginger-beer bottle and your old newspaper;
1759,TO THE TRIPPER,"The devastations,"
1760,TO THE TRIPPER,"Fence-breakings,"
1761,TO THE TRIPPER,And flower-pot maraudings
1762,TO THE TRIPPER,Which you once reserved for noblemen's seats

1764,TO THE TRIPPER,"The Bridge of Sighs,"
1765,TO THE TRIPPER,"Mount Everest,"
1766,TO THE TRIPPER,And the deserts of Gobi
1767,TO THE TRIPPER,And Shamo.
1768,TO THE TRIPPER,"Indeed, I question whether it would be possible"
1769,TO THE TRIPPER,For one to traverse
1770,TO THE TRIPPER,The trackless forests of Mexico
1771,TO THE TRIPPER,"Or ""the dreary tundras of remote Siberia,"""
1772,TO THE TRIPPER,Or to put one's nose
1773,TO THE TRIPPER,Into such an uncompromising fastness as Craig Ell Achaie
1774,TO THE TRIPPER,(Which is the last place the Canadian Pacific Railway made
1775,TO THE TRIPPER,And which may not be properly spelled)
1776,TO THE TRIPPER,Without coming upon you
1777,TO THE TRIPPER,"Picnicking in a spinny,"
1778,TO THE TRIPPER,And prepared to greet all and sundry
1779,TO THE TRIPPER,"With that time-honoured remark,"
1780,TO THE TRIPPER,"""There's 'air,"""
1781,TO THE TRIPPER,Or some other
1782,TO THE TRIPPER,Equally objectionable ribaldry.
1783,TO THE TRIPPER,"Well, my dear Tripper,"
1784,TO THE TRIPPER,"Time is short,"
1785,TO THE TRIPPER,"And poets fill their columns easily,"
1786,TO THE TRIPPER,So that I must not abuse you any more.
1787,TO THE TRIPPER,"You are part of the Cosmos,"
1788,TO THE TRIPPER,And as such I am bound to respect you;
1789,TO THE TRIPPER,"But, by Day and Night,"
1790,TO THE TRIPPER,I wish
1791,TO THE TRIPPER,That James Watt
1792,TO THE TRIPPER,Had taken no notice
1793,TO THE TRIPPER,Of his boiling kettle!

1803,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"For years past, Glasgow has stood in the forefront"
1804,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,As a city given over to the small-pox
1805,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And magisterial reform.
1806,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"It is, I believe,"
1807,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,An exceedingly well-managed city:
1808,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"In fact, it appears to be managed"
1809,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Out of all reasonable existence;
1810,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Hence, no doubt, it comes to pass"
1811,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,That it was lately visited
1812,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,By a smart sample of the plague.
1813,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,I have not the smallest doubt that your Worships
1814,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Are sincere and clean-thinking men.
1815,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"I believe that you do what you do do, so to speak,"
1816,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Out of sheer public spirit
1817,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And with a view to bettering the condition
1818,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Of the city over which you preside.
1819,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"In other words, I impute no motives:"
1820,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"That is to say, no base motives."
1821,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"But, my dear Worships,"
1822,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Why, in the name of Heaven, would you abolish"
1823,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"The harmless, necessary barmaid?"
1824,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Have you never been young?
1825,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Have you never known the tender delight
1826,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Of whiling away a morning
1827,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,With your elbow on the zinc
1828,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And threepennyworth of Bass before you?
1829,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"What, may I ask your Worships,"
1830,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Is Bass without a barmaid?
1831,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"I grant that, taking them all in all,"
1832,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,The barmaids of Scotland
1833,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Are not what you might term
1834,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,An altogether bewitching lot.
1835,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Years ago, when I was young and callow,"
1836,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Fate threw me into the propinquity
1837,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Of a lady of this ilk;
1838,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"She hailed from Glasgow,"
1839,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And she was not beautiful;
1840,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"On the other hand, I was young."
1841,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"And, out of an income which was even slenderer then"
1842,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Than it is now,"
1843,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,I purchased for that dear lady of the North
1844,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Many bottles of perfume,"
1845,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Many pairs of kid gloves,"
1846,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And a Prayer Book or so;
1847,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"And, when I had consumed innumerable Basses"
1848,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"At her altar,"
1849,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"And the time had, as I thought, become ripe,"
1850,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"I offered her matrimony,"
1851,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"To which she replied, in limpid Doric:"
1852,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"""Gang awa hame to yer mither."""
1853,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"That, my dear Worships,"

1859,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,But that you would have my blessing.
1860,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"On the other hand, I am free to admit"
1861,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,That I hae my doots as to your capacity for so doing.
1862,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"The perfume-bottle,"
1863,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"The kid gloves,"
1864,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,The Prayer Book
1865,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"And ""Na, na, na, I winna,"""

1869,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Also, my dear Worships,"
1870,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"One thing is absolutely certain,"
1871,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"That, if the magistrates of all the cities"
1872,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,In the United Kingdom
1873,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Would take the step you have taken,"
1874,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,We should have gone a very considerable way
1875,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"Towards solving the drink problem,"
1876,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,And putting Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
1877,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,Into a fearful hole for money.
1878,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,
1879,TO THE GLASGOW MAGISTRATES,"P.S.--I hate Scotch men,"

1998,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,In my humble opinion
1999,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,It is also quite right.
2000,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"Anyway, we will close this parenthesis"
2001,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"With the usual sign,"
2002,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,And proceed along the primrose path
2003,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Of business)
2004,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,As I have already remarked
2005,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"In my usual quaint way,"
2006,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,A man cannot marry
2007,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,His deceased wife's sister
2008,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Until she is dead.
2009,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"(By ""she"" of course I mean the man's wife.)"
2010,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,The bishops declare
2011,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,That he cannot marry her anyhow
2012,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"(By ""he"" I mean the man,"
2013,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"And by ""her"" of course"
2014,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,The bishops mean
2015,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,The man's deceased wife's sister.
2016,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,I desire to be explicit on these points
2017,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,In order that we may avoid
2018,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Ambiguity.)
2019,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"Well, my dear deceased wife's sister"
2020,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"(Always remembering that Mrs. ---- is still alive),"
2021,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,What is your view of matters?
2022,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Do you really wish to marry me or not?
2023,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Have you any opinions about Lord Hugh Cecil?
2024,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"If so,"
2025,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Kindly state them.
2026,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Was he or was he not justified in demanding
2027,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,On Wednesday night
2028,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"That the word ""Shame"""
2029,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Be put upon the record?

2031,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"If not, why so?"
2032,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"My dear deceased wife's sister,"
2033,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Do not let us get confused.
2034,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Let us clear our minds of Cecil.
2035,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,After all is said
2036,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"You are the Auntie of my children,"
2037,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"And the great-niece of my wife's great-uncle,"
2038,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Not to say the sister-in-law of my children's father.
2039,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"Come along,"
2040,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"Here are ducats,"
2041,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"A ring,"
2042,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"And a Canadian parson,"
2043,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Let us get married at once.
2044,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Of course it is so sudden.
2045,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,It always is.
2046,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,And we have forgotten about Mrs. ----
2047,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,We always do.
2048,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"But I tell you here and now,"
2049,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"And in good set terms,"
2050,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"My dear deceased wife's sister,"
2051,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,That if I wish to marry
2052,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,Either you or any more of your mother's daughters
2053,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,"(Which Heaven forbid),"
2054,TO THE DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER,I shall go to Canada or Australia

2069,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,One of the chief of them being
2070,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,That the devotee can look into the eyes

2073,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,"For my own part, dear Sir Michael,"

2079,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,"I am always careful to claim exemption,"

2106,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,"Judging by your recent efforts,"
2107,TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,You appear to be short of ideas.

2149,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,TO THE COMMON GOLFER
2150,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,
2151,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"My dear Common Golfer,--"
2152,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,The game you affect
2153,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Is a great game
2154,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Played by yourself
2155,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And all the crowned heads of Europe,"
2156,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Not to mention all the fat persons who desire to bant,"
2157,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,All the thin persons who desire to become
2158,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Vigorous and muscular, as it were,"
2159,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"All the clerks who desire to pass for dukes,"
2160,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And all the dukes who relish the society of clerks.
2161,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,It is a great game:
2162,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,The people who play it are not the fault of the game.
2163,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,It is also a good game.
2164,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"If I am not mistaken,"
2165,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,It is a game that originally came out of Scotland;
2166,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Therefore it must be a good game.
2167,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"For everything that comes out of Scotland is good,"
2168,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Even the Scot.
2169,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And golf being a great and good game
2170,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,I do not see any tremendous reason
2171,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Why you, my dear Common Golfer,"
2172,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Should not engage in it if you so choose.
2173,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"On the other hand, I wish from the bottom of my heart"
2174,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,That you did not engage in it.
2175,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,I know a bank
2176,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Whereon the wild thyme blows
2177,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,(Or ought to blow):
2178,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Oft of a pleasant summer morn
2179,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Have I taken a cheap ticket
2180,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"To a station which is not far from that bank,"
2181,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And there (on the bank, that is to say) reclined me"
2182,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"What time I looked up into the blue dome,"
2183,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And watched the lazy-pacing clouds,"
2184,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And flicked away the midges,"
2185,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And wished my name was Corydon,"
2186,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And remembered bits of Keats
2187,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And bits of Herrick
2188,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And bits of business,"
2189,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And so forth.
2190,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Oft, I say, have I done these things;"
2191,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"But of late I no longer do them,"
2192,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Inasmuch as my bank
2193,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Has become (if I may so term it)
2194,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Golf-ridden.
2195,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,The other day I repaired to the said bank
2196,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,On rural musings bent.
2197,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,What did I find?
2198,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Why, my dear old thymy bank"
2199,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Was in the possession
2200,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Of half a dozen gross fellows in red coats,"
2201,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Thy had pipes in their mouths,"
2202,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And a jar of beer in their midst,"
2203,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And they were actually talking and laughing
2204,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,In the most uproarious fashion.
2205,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,I heard one of them say
2206,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"""Why did Arthur Bawl-Fore?"""
2207,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And the others thought hard,"
2208,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And trifled with their brassies and things,"
2209,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And could not make answer.
2210,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"O, my dear Common Golfer,"
2211,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,_You_ were of that party;
2212,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,You _were_;
2213,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"You are always of such parties,"
2214,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,You are always sitting
2215,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"On other people's thymy banks,"
2216,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And saying, ""Why did So-and-so so-and-so?"""
2217,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And depleting village public-houses of good beer,"
2218,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And turning whole village populations into caddies,"
2219,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"And dotting the landscape with your red coats,"
2220,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And generally appropriating the fair face of Nature.
2221,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"I cannot stop you, my dear Common Golfer,"
2222,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"I cannot, O I cannot!"
2223,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Would that I could.  O would that I could!
2224,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"In which case, perhaps, I wouldn't."
2225,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"No, my dear boy,"
2226,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Rural England is yours,"
2227,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Also the sea-side,"
2228,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,"Take them, old man, take them;"
2229,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,I hand them over to you with the best heart in the world.
2230,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,Take them--they are yours--
2231,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,And excuse these tears.
2232,TO THE COMMON GOLFER,

2237,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,
2238,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan,--"
2239,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,I hasten to give you a hearty British welcome.
2240,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Come to my arms;
2241,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,I am in the Trust line myself--
2242,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"That is to say, I used to be"
2243,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Before people started putting up announcements
2244,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,To the effect that
2245,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"""Poor Trust is dead,"
2246,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Bad pay killed him."""
2247,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Some day, an I mistake not, Mr. Morgan,"
2248,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Your Trust will die:
2249,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,All Trusts are grass.
2250,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Ponder it!
2251,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"I am a political economist, and I know."
2252,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Meanwhile I am very pleased to think
2253,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,That we have amongst us a man of your financial prowess
2254,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,And purchasing power.
2255,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,There is a certain class of British person
2256,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Who apparently goes in bodily fear of you.
2257,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"That class of person has groaned loudly over your steel exploit,"
2258,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,And he has groaned loudlier still
2259,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Over your purchase of the Leyland Line of Steamships.
2260,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,To groan over a fair deal of any kind
2261,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Appears to me, my dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan,"
2262,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,To be an entirely stupid proceeding.
2263,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Nobody can come to grief by selling things,"
2264,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Providing they sell them at the right price.
2265,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,You have bought the Leyland Line of Steamships:
2266,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,I see no reason why you should not buy all the other lines
2267,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"If you want them, and have the wherewithal to pay for them,"
2268,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,For in the long run everything comes to him who vends.
2269,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"You buy my steamships, or my steelworks,"
2270,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Or, for that matter, my caller herrin':"
2271,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"I take your money, I put it in your bank,"
2272,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,And live sumptuously on the interest.
2273,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,You have all the trouble
2274,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Inasmuch as you have to rake up the interest.
2275,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"I sit at home and enjoy myself,"
2276,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"You scheme, and scheme, and scheme, and scheme, and scheme,"
2277,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"and scheme, and scheme,"
2278,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"I am happy,"
2279,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,I hope you are.
2280,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Between ourselves I should not tremble
2281,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"If you bought up Great Britain and Ireland (especially Ireland),"
2282,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"And all that in them is,"
2283,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Providing always, as I have said before,"
2284,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,That you paid the price.
2285,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Indeed, I hope to live to see the day"
2286,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"When Englishmen will cease to toil and spin,"
2287,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,And derive their incomes
2288,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Wholly and solely from American dividends.
2289,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Fools buy things, my dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan,"
2290,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Wise men sell them.
2291,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,That is particularly true
2292,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,When the article involved happens to be poetry.
2293,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Nevertheless, as you appear to be in a buying frame of mind,"
2294,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,I take this opportunity of informing you
2295,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,That I have at my villa at Hindhead
2296,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,A large and varied stock
2297,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"Of sonnets, odes, rhymes, jingles, and what not,"
2298,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Which I am prepared to sell at an enormous sacrifice.
2299,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,My price to you for the lot would be
2300,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Fifteen Million Dollars.
2301,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"If you care to deal, I undertake to melt your cheque"
2302,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"At your own bank,"
2303,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,And to invest the proceeds in any concerns
2304,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"In which you happen to be interested,"
2305,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"So that you would not only get the poetry,"
2306,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,But also your money back again.
2307,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,"This, at any rate, is how it seems to me."
2308,TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN,Vale!

2323,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Of my loyalty to the Imperial House
2324,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Of which you are the joy and hope,"

2326,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"To-day, I need scarcely tell you, my dear little Prince,"
2327,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Is a very big day for you,"

2339,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,I am quite sure
2340,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"That you deserve these presents,"
2341,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And that your Grandmama
2342,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Will be able to give your parents a very good account of you,"
2343,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"And that your Grandpapa,"
2344,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"With that tact which is only one of many of his excellent qualities,"
2345,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Will refrain from making reports
2346,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Which might lead to parental chastisement,"
2347,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,I remember quite well
2348,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,That when my own Mama and Papa
2349,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Returned once from a little jaunt
2350,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"They brought back with them,"
2351,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"As a present for me,"
2352,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"A tin cylinder with a spike to it,"
2353,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Which you set on a piece of wood
2354,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And spun round;
2355,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Then you looked through some holes in the tin cylinder
2356,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"And beheld many wonderful things,"
2357,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Such as a little girl skipping,"
2358,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And jockeys riding a steeplechase on tigers.
2359,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"If your Papa, my dear little Prince,"
2360,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Has not brought you one of those,"
2361,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Be sure you ask for it.
2362,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"It is not rude to ask for what you do not see in the window,"
2363,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Providing you say ""Please."""
2364,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And now before I go
2365,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Let me add a few words
2366,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Of kindly admonition.
2367,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"I hope you will grow up to be a good and great man,"
2368,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And that you will never give your parents
2369,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Cause for sorrow,"
2370,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"By turning Socialist,"
2371,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Or newspaper editor,"
2372,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Or attempting to imitate these Odes.
2373,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,To your infant mind
2374,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,This last crime
2375,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"May appear to be the most innocent in the world,"
2376,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Because these odes
2377,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,(God wot)
2378,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Are so easy to imitate;
2379,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Diplomats, Members of Parliament, publishers' assistants,"
2380,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Cabmen, poets, peers of the realm,"
2381,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Nay, even the very crowned heads of Europe,"
2382,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Have, at time and time,"
2383,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Been consumed with a desire to do them for me;
2384,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Because, as I have said,"
2385,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,It is so easy.
2386,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"Well, my dear little Prince,"
2387,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,Let us draw our moral.
2388,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,The easy thing is not always the wisest thing.
2389,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,I feel that in my inmost heart.
2390,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,And if you blossom into manhood
2391,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"With the same conviction,"
2392,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,"More or less,"
2393,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,I make no doubt whatever
2394,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,That you will be an immense success
2395,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,As a king.
2396,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,I wish you the best of luck.
2397,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,
2398,TO PRINCE EDWARD OF YORK,

2403,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"My dear Madame Bernhardt,--"
2404,TO MME. BERNHARDT,I have been very nigh addressing this ode
2405,TO MME. BERNHARDT,To the winner of the Derby.
2406,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"But, on second thoughts, I said,"
2407,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"""No, no--never!"""

2412,TO MME. BERNHARDT,That the charming Mme. Bernhardt
2413,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Should return to her interesting country
2414,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Possessed of the impression that the _bas Anglais_
2415,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Have a greater feeling for _le sport_
2416,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"Than for the _arts dramatiques_,"
2417,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Or whatever you call 'em?
2418,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"_Non, non_, a thousand times, _non!_"""
2419,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"Ah, Madame, believe me,"
2420,TO MME. BERNHARDT,I love my country--

2422,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"It is a fine country when you understand it,"
2423,TO MME. BERNHARDT,And I would have my beautiful Bernhardt
2424,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Take away with her
2425,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Nothing but splendid memories of it.
2426,TO MME. BERNHARDT,I was exceedingly glad
2427,TO MME. BERNHARDT,To read in the papers the other morning
2428,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"That in the opinion of the _critics dramatiques Anglais_,"
2429,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"Or whatever you call 'em,"
2430,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Madame had done herself proud
2431,TO MME. BERNHARDT,At the Lyceum Theatre the other evening.
2432,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"One _critic dramatique Anglais_,"
2433,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"Or whatever you call him,"
2434,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Wrote of Madame thus:
2435,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"""Such passages,"
2436,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Wherein the eaglet is borne away

2439,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"They are, in fact, its keynote,"
2440,TO MME. BERNHARDT,And Mme. Bernhardt
2441,TO MME. BERNHARDT,Declaimed them with superb intensity.
2442,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"The famous voice has lost its golden notes,"
2443,TO MME. BERNHARDT,"But its power to thrill remains,"

2494,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,"From China to Peru,"
2495,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,And from Rosebery to Lloyd-George as it were?

2514,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,"And a sad, fierce, baffled, careless-ordered thing to look upon,"
2515,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,And in its midst there sits down perennially
2516,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,"A huge and ponderous and unwieldy ruminant,"
2517,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,"Whom, merely for the sake of talking, my dear Sir William,"
2518,TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,We will call the Harcourt.

2569,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Dear Brindle,--"
2570,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Possibly your name is not Brindle,"
2571,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,But that is of no consequence;
2572,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"The great point, my dear Brindle, being"
2573,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,That when his Majesty Edward VII.
2574,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Landed at Flushing the other day
2575,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,He was accompanied
2576,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,By
2577,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,You.
2578,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"At least so I gather from the halfpenny papers,"
2579,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And I am free to admit
2580,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,That when I read the paragraph
2581,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Descriptive of your landing at Flushing
2582,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,My bosom swelled with honest pride.
2583,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"I am not a doggy man myself,"
2584,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Dear Brindle,"
2585,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And no judge of points.
2586,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Also,"
2587,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,When I see a dog coming towards me
2588,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,I invariably
2589,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Whisper
2590,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"""Bite,"""
2591,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And consequently
2592,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,My hair
2593,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Is apt to stand on end
2594,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Like quills upon the fretful porcupine

2596,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Bulldogs especially
2597,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Affright me,"

2599,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"How the little foreign boy,"
2600,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Assembled at Flushing
2601,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"To scoff in his sleeve at the English King,"
2602,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Remained to flee as it were
2603,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,At the sight of you.
2604,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"That, in a nutshell,"
2605,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Is why my bosom swelled
2606,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,When I read the paragraph
2607,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,To which previous reference has been made.
2608,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"It was a picturesque circumstance, my dear Brindle."
2609,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And may be taken
2610,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,As one more illustration
2611,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Of his Majesty's determination
2612,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,(Pray excuse the rhyme)
2613,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,To do things as a king of England should.
2614,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,To have alighted at Flushing
2615,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Accompanied by a Lion
2616,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Would have been a little outré,"
2617,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"And Unicorns, we know,"
2618,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Are not obtainable--
2619,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,What does his Majesty do?
2620,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"Why he takes, as he always has taken,"
2621,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,The middle and dignified course:
2622,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,He disjects himself on Flushing
2623,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,With You by his side.
2624,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Next to the Lion and the Unicorn
2625,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,The Bulldog may be reckoned
2626,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,The truest
2627,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Exemplar and symbol
2628,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Of our great nation.
2629,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,It is like this:
2630,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"The Bulldog is not too beautiful,"
2631,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Neither is our great nation;
2632,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,But he frightens people--
2633,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,So do we;
2634,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,He is tenacious
2635,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And magnanimous--
2636,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Which is just our game;
2637,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"He fears no foe in shining armour,"
2638,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Or any other sort of armour--
2639,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,That is precisely our case;
2640,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"And he is kept by Lord Charles Beresford,"
2641,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"The Duke of Manchester,"
2642,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,And Mr. G. R. Sims--
2643,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,Three eminently typical Britons.
2644,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"In short,"
2645,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"The genius of the British nation,"
2646,TO THE KING'S BULLDOG,"My dear Brindle,"

2779,TO EVERYBODY,TO EVERYBODY
2780,TO EVERYBODY,
2781,TO EVERYBODY,"My dear Everybody,--"
2782,TO EVERYBODY,The other day I lunched at a place
2783,TO EVERYBODY,Where there was a pretty lady.
2784,TO EVERYBODY,During the course of the talk
2785,TO EVERYBODY,"The pretty lady said to me,"
2786,TO EVERYBODY,"""You see, Everybody is out of town"
2787,TO EVERYBODY,"At present."""
2788,TO EVERYBODY,"I said, ""Who is Everybody?"""
2789,TO EVERYBODY,"Whereupon the pretty lady replied,"
2790,TO EVERYBODY,"""Well--er--Everybody."""
2791,TO EVERYBODY,"I said, ""Quite so;"
2792,TO EVERYBODY,But don't you think it is rather
2793,TO EVERYBODY,Fortunate that Everybody is out of town?
2794,TO EVERYBODY,"And the pretty lady answered and said,"
2795,TO EVERYBODY,"""No."""
2796,TO EVERYBODY,"I conclude, therefore,"
2797,TO EVERYBODY,"That you, Everybody,"
2798,TO EVERYBODY,"Must, on the whole, be rather nice."
2799,TO EVERYBODY,I hope you are;
2800,TO EVERYBODY,"For Everybody should be rather nice,"
2801,TO EVERYBODY,Should they not?
2802,TO EVERYBODY,And when I come to think of it
2803,TO EVERYBODY,The circumstance that I heard of you
2804,TO EVERYBODY,The other day
2805,TO EVERYBODY,Has nothing prodigiously unusual about it.
2806,TO EVERYBODY,"Really and truly,"
2807,TO EVERYBODY,One is always hearing about you.
2808,TO EVERYBODY,"One is, believe me."
2809,TO EVERYBODY,"For example, the paragraph writers assure me"
2810,TO EVERYBODY,That Everybody is reading
2811,TO EVERYBODY,Miss So-and-So's great novel;
2812,TO EVERYBODY,"Also, that Everybody will join with them"
2813,TO EVERYBODY,In congratulating Miss So-and-So on her approaching marriage;
2814,TO EVERYBODY,"Also, that Everybody is in the Highlands,"
2815,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody anticipates a good season,"
2816,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody keeps a houseboat,"
2817,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody sups at the Carlton after the theatre,"
2818,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody recognises in Lord Salisbury a great statesman,"
2819,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody plays golf,"
2820,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody who can afford it dresses well,"
2821,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody knows the King has tact,"
2822,TO EVERYBODY,"That Everybody thinks the Queen grows younger as she grows older,"
2823,TO EVERYBODY,That Everybody hopes Sir Thomas Lipton
2824,TO EVERYBODY,"Will win the America Cup,"
2825,TO EVERYBODY,And so on.
2826,TO EVERYBODY,Which is well.
2827,TO EVERYBODY,I don't mind in the least.
2828,TO EVERYBODY,Why should I?
2829,TO EVERYBODY,"Yet, if I were Everybody,"
2830,TO EVERYBODY,I imagine that I should not do things
2831,TO EVERYBODY,Quite in the same way that you do them.
2832,TO EVERYBODY,"To my mind, your great defect is that you do things"
2833,TO EVERYBODY,"Not because you like to do them,"
2834,TO EVERYBODY,But simply because
2835,TO EVERYBODY,Everybody does them.
2836,TO EVERYBODY,This is an excellent reason
2837,TO EVERYBODY,From your point of view;
2838,TO EVERYBODY,But to me it seems a trifle stupid.
2839,TO EVERYBODY,Who is reading Miss So-and-So's book?
2840,TO EVERYBODY,Everybody.
2841,TO EVERYBODY,Why are they reading it?
2842,TO EVERYBODY,Because Everybody is reading it.
2843,TO EVERYBODY,Do they like Miss So-and-So's book?
2844,TO EVERYBODY,They are not quite sure.
2845,TO EVERYBODY,"But Everybody says it is good,"
2846,TO EVERYBODY,And therefore Everybody must read it.
2847,TO EVERYBODY,Why are frock-coats worn?
2848,TO EVERYBODY,Because Everybody wears them.
2849,TO EVERYBODY,Why does Everybody wear them?
2850,TO EVERYBODY,Because Everybody wears them.
2851,TO EVERYBODY,Why does Everybody dine at a certain restaurant?
2852,TO EVERYBODY,Because Everybody dines there.
2853,TO EVERYBODY,Why does Everybody dine there?
2854,TO EVERYBODY,Because Everybody dines there.
2855,TO EVERYBODY,Why does----
2856,TO EVERYBODY,"But, there,"
2857,TO EVERYBODY,I forbear.
2858,TO EVERYBODY,Did time allow I might multiply instances
2859,TO EVERYBODY,"Till Everybody felt bored,"
2860,TO EVERYBODY,But I stay min' hand;
2861,TO EVERYBODY,"Enough, you know, is as good as a feast;"
2862,TO EVERYBODY,"Likewise, better a stalled ox"
2863,TO EVERYBODY,Than a dinner of herbs;
2864,TO EVERYBODY,"Everybody says so,"
2865,TO EVERYBODY,Wherefore I am constrained to believe it.
2866,TO EVERYBODY,"By way of conclusion, let us ask ourselves"
2867,TO EVERYBODY,What is happening just now.
2868,TO EVERYBODY,Everybody says
2869,TO EVERYBODY,"That nothing is happening just now,"
2870,TO EVERYBODY,And that everything is frightfully dull;
2871,TO EVERYBODY,And
2872,TO EVERYBODY,Everybody
2873,TO EVERYBODY,Is
2874,TO EVERYBODY,Quite
2875,TO EVERYBODY,Right.
2876,TO EVERYBODY,
2877,TO EVERYBODY,
2878,TO EVERYBODY,
2879,TO EVERYBODY,
