122,THE WIFE,
123,THE WIFE,"My husband made it for me ere we wed,"
124,THE WIFE,And sang it in my garden; I arose
125,THE WIFE,"And leaned down to him, and my fingers gave"
126,THE WIFE,To all his kisses.  Ah! those days were sweet.

135,THE WIFE,
136,THE WIFE,I am happy in his love
137,THE WIFE,"And thank God for it, nay, propitiate"
138,THE WIFE,With vows and offering; I fear a wrath
139,THE WIFE,Called down on too great happiness; I fear--
140,THE WIFE,"I know not what--Oh, I possess a gift"
141,THE WIFE,"So rare and precious, that, like men who go"
142,THE WIFE,"Laden with rubies, I am grown suspect"
143,THE WIFE,"Of all the earth and heaven, feel the stars"
144,THE WIFE,Peer covetously on me.  Every hour
145,THE WIFE,That he is from my side a cloud of woe
146,THE WIFE,Settles upon me like a swarm of bees.
147,THE WIFE,"Ah, is it possible that we can sin"
148,THE WIFE,"In happiness, against a jealous God?"

151,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER
152,THE MOTHER,
153,THE MOTHER,"Nay, nay, these foolish thoughts! your wits are strayed"
154,THE MOTHER,With too much brooding: let me bind afresh
155,THE MOTHER,The knot of scarlet lilies in your hair;
156,THE MOTHER,"They fade already, for the sun is high"
157,THE MOTHER,"Towards the noon: Ah, child, what waits for you"
158,THE MOTHER,"But love, and yet more love, and happiness,"
159,THE MOTHER,"And children of delight, and in old age"
160,THE MOTHER,"Respect of all the peoples, and at last"
161,THE MOTHER,Death in his arms and burial in peace?
162,THE MOTHER,"Still do you tremble, what is it you fear?"

166,THE WIFE,
167,THE WIFE,"Can you not feel a something in the air,"
168,THE WIFE,"A warning, or a presence, or the weight"
169,THE WIFE,"Of some unguessed-at horror, that, like dust"
170,THE WIFE,"Impalpable and deadly, clings and kills?"
171,THE WIFE,There is some terror--'tis my heart that speaks
172,THE WIFE,"And warns me--ah! would God indeed, your son,"
173,THE WIFE,(My love and husband) had another father
174,THE WIFE,Than that celestial being.  This it is
175,THE WIFE,"That puts eternal sadness on his brow,"
176,THE WIFE,"And shade within his eyes I cannot lift,"
177,THE WIFE,Even with kisses; 'tis the angel nature
178,THE WIFE,"That makes him sit spell-woven in a trance,"
179,THE WIFE,"Chin in his hand, and eyes on vacancy,"
180,THE WIFE,"And lips all bare of love, the while his soul"
181,THE WIFE,Struggles against the bonds of finity.

212,THE WIFE,THE WIFE
213,THE WIFE,
214,THE WIFE,Tell of yours;
215,THE WIFE,"So that I may compare your flowers with mine,"
216,THE WIFE,"Your doubts and times of joy, and how arose"
217,THE WIFE,The sudden and sweet passion in your heart;
218,THE WIFE,"Did the world burst forth, like a flower from bud,"
219,THE WIFE,"All suddenly in beauty, when you met?"

234,THE MOTHER,
235,THE MOTHER,"Ah, that first time!"
236,THE MOTHER,"It was a night of gods, a night of love."
237,THE MOTHER,The earth was still beneath a summer sky
238,THE MOTHER,"So thickly sown with stars, that it appeared"
239,THE MOTHER,A vase of ebon in a silver shroud;
240,THE MOTHER,"No breath there stirred, the hot air seemed to hang"
241,THE MOTHER,"In heavy folds, like silken tapestry,"
242,THE MOTHER,"Clinging, caressing; all the birds were still,"
243,THE MOTHER,No nightingale with her ecstatic pain
244,THE MOTHER,"Transfixed the silence; earth was dead asleep,"
245,THE MOTHER,Sunk in a scented languor; every flower
246,THE MOTHER,"Steamed all its odour forth, as it would pour"
247,THE MOTHER,Its soul before the mystery of love.
248,THE MOTHER,
249,THE MOTHER,"And I into the night had stolen forth,"
250,THE MOTHER,"Oppressed, with pain or joy, I knew not which,"
251,THE MOTHER,Knew only that the blood throughout my veins
252,THE MOTHER,"Did run like liquid fire, head to foot"
253,THE MOTHER,"I tingled with sensation, all my hair"
254,THE MOTHER,"Stirred, as with separate life within itself;"
255,THE MOTHER,"And as I plucked the flowers and wove them in,"
256,THE MOTHER,"Purple and waxen, languorously sweet,"
257,THE MOTHER,They seemed anticipation of a touch
258,THE MOTHER,"Should make each thread of hair become a bird,"
259,THE MOTHER,Fluttering with outstretched wings.  From off my breast
260,THE MOTHER,I flung my garment back; the soft air wooed
261,THE MOTHER,Like sleepy lips ere love is yet awake.
262,THE MOTHER,"Then, as I lingered in the dusky depths,"
263,THE MOTHER,"All flower-shadowed, blacker than the night,"
264,THE MOTHER,Blacker than shadows cast by palace walls
265,THE MOTHER,"Upon a moonlit night, there, in that web"
266,THE MOTHER,"Of close-knit darkness, suddenly there came"
267,THE MOTHER,"The wonder unto me, the god, my love--"
268,THE MOTHER,"Within mine ears there was a silver silence,"
269,THE MOTHER,"And in my heart a golden burst of song,"
270,THE MOTHER,"The darkness burned around me, with a light"
271,THE MOTHER,"Born from the other worlds, and there he stood,"
272,THE MOTHER,"Radiant, godlike, purple were his wings"
273,THE MOTHER,"And splashed with fire, purply-black his hair"
274,THE MOTHER,And crowned with stars for flowers; in his eyes
275,THE MOTHER,My soul sank into passion and was drowned.

278,CHORUS,CHORUS
279,CHORUS,
280,CHORUS,"Oh, what a pair of birds,"
281,CHORUS,Hidden among the leaves!
282,CHORUS,"He a god and she a maid,"
283,CHORUS,Deathless lips on mortal laid;
284,CHORUS,(Nothing death retrieves.)
285,CHORUS,
286,CHORUS,There a son of God
287,CHORUS,And child of mortal seed
288,CHORUS,Met and kissed as love with love;
289,CHORUS,"Oh the leaves were thick above,"
290,CHORUS,No stars saw the deed.
291,CHORUS,
292,CHORUS,"No stars, but the eye of God?"
293,CHORUS,"Ah, perchance He saw"
294,CHORUS,How a god to mortal prayed
295,CHORUS,And the fatal compact made
296,CHORUS,'Gainst eternal law.
297,CHORUS,
298,CHORUS,Veiled and still the night.
299,CHORUS,"So, a fount of tears"
300,CHORUS,"Springs at first unseen, unguessed,"
301,CHORUS,Till at last the flood confessed
302,CHORUS,Gushes down the years.
303,CHORUS,
304,CHORUS,Son of a son of God
305,CHORUS,And the daughter of men too frail!
306,CHORUS,Union of the nature's twain?
307,CHORUS,"Only sorrow and want and pain,"
308,CHORUS,Striving without avail;
309,CHORUS,
310,CHORUS,Desire for wings of a god
311,CHORUS,Tied to the will of a man;
312,CHORUS,"Memory of a boundless space,"
313,CHORUS,(Where stars and spheres their dance enlace)
314,CHORUS,With the threescore human span
315,CHORUS,
316,CHORUS,"Hung like a bridge, in the gulf"
317,CHORUS,Of God's eternity.
318,CHORUS,Oh a mind to know and a heart to crave
319,CHORUS,Beyond the horizon of the grave
320,CHORUS,To the bounds of infinity!
321,CHORUS,
322,CHORUS,Yet ever Fate compels
323,CHORUS,This infinite desire
324,CHORUS,To match with cramped and finite brain;
325,CHORUS,And all of heaven earth may gain
326,CHORUS,"Is smoke, where should be fire."

332,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER
333,THE SEEKER,
334,THE SEEKER,"The air is heavy, all the winds are still"
335,THE SEEKER,So that my own breath hangs about my head
336,THE SEEKER,Like incense o'er an altar.  Now the earth
337,THE SEEKER,"Lies in a swoon, and all the flowers droop"
338,THE SEEKER,"Weighting their stems, ranged in their brazen pots"
339,THE SEEKER,Without the house: the very petals lie
340,THE SEEKER,Like languid limbs relaxed; this crimson rose
341,THE SEEKER,"Looks as if blood-steeped, almost to my sense"
342,THE SEEKER,"Smells of the same, the lilies are like death."
343,THE SEEKER,There is a taint of sickness in the air
344,THE SEEKER,Through all the noonday light--like fever chill
345,THE SEEKER,"In fever burning,--and the sky is brass;"
346,THE SEEKER,The very tinkle of the fountain spray
347,THE SEEKER,"Is dead and tuneless, even the fresh springs"
348,THE SEEKER,"Have lost their freshness, run from off my hands"
349,THE SEEKER,"In drops of lead, and all my spirit seems"
350,THE SEEKER,Weighed and confined with fetters of decay.
351,THE SEEKER,Because I have loved beauty more than most
352,THE SEEKER,And striven to pluck out the heart of it;
353,THE SEEKER,Because I have such sense of lovely things
354,THE SEEKER,That I can pour my soul in thankfulness
355,THE SEEKER,"Before a leaf God makes to grow aright,"
356,THE SEEKER,A unit of perfection; 'tis ordained
357,THE SEEKER,Because I love most still I most must lack
358,THE SEEKER,"Love's satisfaction, quietude of soul--"
359,THE SEEKER,Still must I find such void disparity
360,THE SEEKER,"Between the false and true, and yet they grow"
361,THE SEEKER,"Together, intermingled; true is false"
362,THE SEEKER,"Itself, by sometime seeming, who shall find"
363,THE SEEKER,The point where false and true are reconciled?
364,THE SEEKER,
365,THE SEEKER,The very flower that we stoop to smell
366,THE SEEKER,"Grows from a dunghill, look but in its roots,"
367,THE SEEKER,And what obscene and hideous blind life
368,THE SEEKER,Goes teeming; sickened then we shrink aback
369,THE SEEKER,From rose's velvet petals.  So the soul
370,THE SEEKER,Holds best and meanest in a common cup.
371,THE SEEKER,Yet must there be a law in things that are
372,THE SEEKER,"Seemingly lawless, purify the sight"
373,THE SEEKER,"And truth must surely then be visible,"
374,THE SEEKER,Disparity made clear; the eye of God
375,THE SEEKER,"Sees good in everything, thereto I strive,"
376,THE SEEKER,"To see with God's own vision, be more clear"
377,THE SEEKER,"In speech, than God, to asking human hearts."
378,THE SEEKER,"Then is the tangle straightened, and the world"
379,THE SEEKER,"Lies in perspective, as before me lie,"
380,THE SEEKER,"Traced through the shimmering heat, the palaces,"
381,THE SEEKER,"Towers and temples, gardens and granaries,"
382,THE SEEKER,"Of this fair City, melting far away"
383,THE SEEKER,Into the sunlight-flooded hills at last.
384,THE SEEKER,
385,THE SEEKER,"Yet must I sit here for a little while,"
386,THE SEEKER,"Where many columns make a heavy gloom,"
387,THE SEEKER,And with the trickle from the water-jars
388,THE SEEKER,"Of unfresh water, cheat myself awhile"
389,THE SEEKER,With thought of evening freshness.  Oh my soul
390,THE SEEKER,"Is wearier than my body with the toil,"
391,THE SEEKER,It aches with length of watching.  I have strained
392,THE SEEKER,My spiritual eyes to catch a glimpse of dawn
393,THE SEEKER,And nothing seen but blackness.  Let me rest
394,THE SEEKER,As rest the quiet dead from doubt and toil;
395,THE SEEKER,Like silver feathers from the wings of God
396,THE SEEKER,Sleep fans my senses----

407,THE CHORUS,"Sleep, and forget."
408,THE CHORUS,
409,THE CHORUS,"In death we all are equal, great and small"
410,THE CHORUS,Brought to the common level of the dust;
411,THE CHORUS,"There is no glory that survives the years,"
412,THE CHORUS,"Nay, nay, alike we shall be as we must;"
413,THE CHORUS,Sleep and forget.
414,THE CHORUS,
415,THE CHORUS,"In sleep we are omnipotent as gods,"
416,THE CHORUS,"Beyond our furthest wish we can attain,"
417,THE CHORUS,Unfettered by the chain of circumstance;
418,THE CHORUS,"Sleep then; or waking, turn and pray again"
419,THE CHORUS,A little more to sleep and to forget.

431,THE MOTHER,"Portentous look o'er all the earth, my hand"
432,THE MOTHER,Stretched in the sunlight seems to throw no shade
433,THE MOTHER,As if the natural laws had all stood still--
434,THE MOTHER,"I breathe as in a nightmare, breath oppressed;"
435,THE MOTHER,"I start at every sound, but fear no sound"
436,THE MOTHER,"So much as stillness, which descends on us"

450,THE MOTHER,"Chequered between the lattice window work,"
451,THE MOTHER,And listened to the fountain in the grove
452,THE MOTHER,Of orange trees go singing to itself--
453,THE MOTHER,"Behold, all suddenly before me stood"
454,THE MOTHER,"My lover-god, the angel ever dear,"
455,THE MOTHER,"And radiant as that first night years ago,"
456,THE MOTHER,There stood he; where the marble touched his feet
457,THE MOTHER,"It glowed translucent like a sunlit gem,"
458,THE MOTHER,The perfume of his hair had made me swoon
459,THE MOTHER,"Had not his eyes compelled me.  Grave he looked,"
460,THE MOTHER,Where gravity in such a beauteous thing
461,THE MOTHER,"Could find occasion, and his voice was low"
462,THE MOTHER,"And troubled, warning me.  ""Let not your son"
463,THE MOTHER,"Tempt God too far, He will not brook affront"
464,THE MOTHER,Though son of mine should dare it; be assured
465,THE MOTHER,The secret of this riddle universe
466,THE MOTHER,"Shall ne'er be known on earth, man was not made"
467,THE MOTHER,"For too much knowledge, mankind ceases then"
468,THE MOTHER,When man too much aspires.  Speak to him
469,THE MOTHER,Lest he should bring destruction on your head
470,THE MOTHER,"And on the world.""  Thus spoke he, nothing more,"

484,THE MOTHER,"One gives to children's prattle.  ""Now at last"
485,THE MOTHER,"The hours bear fruit, and shall I hold my hand,"""
486,THE MOTHER,"He answered, ""for your vision?  I have waited,"
487,THE MOTHER,Now is the time when hope is justified;

513,THE SEEKER,"Of white Eternity, I view the world."
514,THE SEEKER,Now am I all at peace; the heart that yearns
515,THE SEEKER,In bitter loneliness through midnight hours
516,THE SEEKER,"Yet cannot voice its longing, brain that weaves"
517,THE SEEKER,Its subtle web around the central thought
518,THE SEEKER,"Yet never can absorb it; and this form,"
519,THE SEEKER,"The visible pride of body, all complete"

1228,WISDOM AND YOUTH,She plucked the boughs to make her shade.
1229,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"She pulled the flowers far and wide,"

1231,WISDOM AND YOUTH,To deck her hair; and while the glades
1232,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Re-echoed to her laughter gay,"
