8,,"The word ""beloved"" appears in this book several times, in various"
9,,"upper and lower case combinations.  Whatever the combination, in"
10,,"some cases, the second E in ""beloved"" is e-accent (é) and sometimes"
11,,it is e-grave (è).  Since I had no way of telling if this was what
12,,"the author intended, or a typesetting error, or some other reason,"
13,,I have left each exactly as it appears in the original book.

210,INTRODUCTION,
211,INTRODUCTION,"One Spring day in London, long before the invention of freak verse and"
212,INTRODUCTION,"Freudism, I was standing in front of the Cafe Royal in Regent Street"
213,INTRODUCTION,when there emerged from its portals the most famous young writer of the
214,INTRODUCTION,"day, the Poet about whose latest work ""The Book Bills of Narcissus"" all"
215,INTRODUCTION,literary London was then talking.
216,INTRODUCTION,
217,INTRODUCTION,Richard Le Gallienne was the first real poet I had ever laid eyes upon
218,INTRODUCTION,in the flesh and it seemed to my rapt senses that this frock-coated
219,INTRODUCTION,"young god, with the classic profile and the dark curls curving from the"
220,INTRODUCTION,"impeccable silk ""tile"" that surmounted them as curve the acanthus"
221,INTRODUCTION,"leaves of a Corinthian capital, could be none other than Anacreon's"
222,INTRODUCTION,self in modern shape.
223,INTRODUCTION,
224,INTRODUCTION,"I can see Le Gallienne now, as he steps across the sunlit sidewalk and"
225,INTRODUCTION,with gesture Mercurian hails the passing Jehu.  I can even hear the
226,INTRODUCTION,quick clud of the cab doors as the smartly turning hansome snatches
227,INTRODUCTION,from my view the glass-dimmed face I was not to behold again until
228,INTRODUCTION,years later at the house of a mutual friend in New York.
229,INTRODUCTION,
230,INTRODUCTION,In another moment the swiftly moving vehicle was dissolved in the
231,INTRODUCTION,glitter of Regent Street and I fell to musing upon the curious
232,INTRODUCTION,interlacement of parts in this picture puzzle of life.
233,INTRODUCTION,
234,INTRODUCTION,"Here was a common Cabby, for the time being combining in himself the"
235,INTRODUCTION,"several functions of guide-book, chattel-mortgage and writ of habeas"
236,INTRODUCTION,corpus on the person of the most popular literary idol of the hour and
237,INTRODUCTION,"all for the matter of maybe no more than half a crown, including the"
238,INTRODUCTION,_pourboire_!
239,INTRODUCTION,
240,INTRODUCTION,Who would not have rejoiced to change places with that cabman! And how
241,INTRODUCTION,might not Pegasus have envied that cab-horse!
242,INTRODUCTION,
243,INTRODUCTION,*      *      *      *      *      *
244,INTRODUCTION,
245,INTRODUCTION,Now after all these years it has come to pass that I am to change
246,INTRODUCTION,places with the cabman.
247,INTRODUCTION,
248,INTRODUCTION,"Perched aloft in the driver's seat of the First Person Singular, it is"
249,INTRODUCTION,my proud privilege to crack the prefatory whip and start this newest
250,INTRODUCTION,and best Le Gallienne Vehicle upon its course through the garlanded Via
251,INTRODUCTION,Laurea to the Sign of the Golden Sheaf.
252,INTRODUCTION,
253,INTRODUCTION,"Look at it well, Dear People, before it starts, this golden vehicle of"
254,INTRODUCTION,Richard Le Gallienne.
255,INTRODUCTION,
256,INTRODUCTION,Consider how it is built on the authentic lines of the best
257,INTRODUCTION,"workmanship, made to last for generations, maybe for ever."
258,INTRODUCTION,
259,INTRODUCTION,Take note of its springs so perfectly hung that the Muse may ride in
260,INTRODUCTION,"luxurious ease, unjarred by metrical joltings as befits the Queen."
261,INTRODUCTION,
262,INTRODUCTION,Mark the mirror smooth surface of the lacquer that only time and
263,INTRODUCTION,tireless labour can apply.
264,INTRODUCTION,
265,INTRODUCTION,Before this Master Coach of Poesy the rattle-jointed Tin Lizzie of Free
266,INTRODUCTION,Verse and the painted jazz wagon of Futurism and the cheap imitation of
267,INTRODUCTION,"the Chinese palanquin must turn aside, they have no right of way, these"
268,INTRODUCTION,literary road-lice on the garlanded Via Laurea.
269,INTRODUCTION,
270,INTRODUCTION,"With angry thumb, the traffic cop Time will jerk them back to the side"
271,INTRODUCTION,"streets and byways where they belong, to make way for the Golden Coach"
272,INTRODUCTION,of Richard Le Gallienne.

399,THE DRYAD,Among ten thousand trees.

401,THE DRYAD,"At step of a lover,"
402,THE DRYAD,And where to find her lovely face
403,THE DRYAD,Only the woodland bees
404,THE DRYAD,"Ever discover,"

406,THE DRYAD,"From meadows sunny,"

420,THE DRYAD,"All white like a mortal girl,"
421,THE DRYAD,With moonshine hallowed o'er.
422,THE DRYAD,
423,THE DRYAD,Yet were there thrice ten thousand trees
424,THE DRYAD,"To hide her face from me,"
425,THE DRYAD,Not all her fleeing
426,THE DRYAD,"Should 'scape my seeing,"
427,THE DRYAD,Nor all her ambushed sorceries
428,THE DRYAD,Secure concealment be
429,THE DRYAD,For her bright being.
430,THE DRYAD,
431,THE DRYAD,Yea! should she by the laddered pine
432,THE DRYAD,"Steal to the stars on high,"
433,THE DRYAD,"Her fairy whiteness,"
434,THE DRYAD,"Hidden in brightness,"
435,THE DRYAD,Her hiding-place would so out-shine
436,THE DRYAD,"The constellated sky,"
437,THE DRYAD,She could not 'scape the eye
438,THE DRYAD,"Of my pursuing,"
439,THE DRYAD,Nor her fawn-foot lightness
440,THE DRYAD,Out-speed my wooing.

1702,NOON,"Loiters below the cloudy willow boughs,"
1703,NOON,"That build amid the glare a shadowy house,"
1704,NOON,And with a Paradisal freshness brims
1705,NOON,Amid cool-rooted reeds with glossy blade;
1706,NOON,"The antic water-fly above it skims,"

1725,A RAINY DAY,
1726,A RAINY DAY,"The beauty of this rainy day,"
1727,A RAINY DAY,"All silver-green and dripping gray,"
1728,A RAINY DAY,Has stolen quite my heart away
1729,A RAINY DAY,"From all the tasks I meant to do,"
1730,A RAINY DAY,Made me forget the resolute blue
1731,A RAINY DAY,And energetic gold of things . . .
1732,A RAINY DAY,So soft a song the rain-bird sings.
1733,A RAINY DAY,
1734,A RAINY DAY,Yet am I glad to miss awhile
1735,A RAINY DAY,"The sun's huge domineering smile,"
1736,A RAINY DAY,"The busy spaces mile on mile,"
1737,A RAINY DAY,Shut in behind this shimmering screen
1738,A RAINY DAY,Of falling pearls and phantom green;
1739,A RAINY DAY,"As in a cloister walled with rain,"
1740,A RAINY DAY,"Safe from intrusions, voices vain,"
1741,A RAINY DAY,"And hurry of invading feet,"
1742,A RAINY DAY,Inviolate in my retreat:
1743,A RAINY DAY,"Myself, my books, my pipe, my fire--"
1744,A RAINY DAY,So runs my rainy-day desire.
1745,A RAINY DAY,
1746,A RAINY DAY,"Or I old letters may con o'er,"
1747,A RAINY DAY,"And dream on faces seen no more,"
1748,A RAINY DAY,"The buried treasure of the years,"
1749,A RAINY DAY,Too visionary now for tears;
1750,A RAINY DAY,Open old cupboards and explore
1751,A RAINY DAY,"Sometimes, for an old sweetheart's sake,"
1752,A RAINY DAY,"A delicate romantic ache,"
1753,A RAINY DAY,Sometimes a swifter pang of pain
1754,A RAINY DAY,"To read old tenderness again,"
1755,A RAINY DAY,"As though the ink were scarce yet dry,"
1756,A RAINY DAY,And She still She and I still I.
1757,A RAINY DAY,What if I were to write as though
1758,A RAINY DAY,Her letter came an hour ago!
1759,A RAINY DAY,An hour ago!--This post-mark says . . .
1760,A RAINY DAY,But out upon these rainy days!
1761,A RAINY DAY,"Come tie the packet up again,"

3259,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"At eight, from out my lazy tower,"
3260,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"I watch the snow, and shake my head;"
3261,THE VALIANT GIRLS,But yonder petticoated flower
3262,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Braves it alone, with aery tread;"
3263,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Nor wind, nor rain, nor ice-fanged storm,"
3264,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Frightens that valiant little form.
3265,THE VALIANT GIRLS,
3266,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Strange! she that sweetens all the air,"
3267,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"The New York sister of the rose,"

3278,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Whose lot seemed only love and lover,"
3279,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Should to Life's rough and muddy wheel
3280,THE VALIANT GIRLS,So gravely set her pretty shoulder;--
3281,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"(What would her dead grandmother feel,"

3286,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"A woman still--yes! still a girl,"
3287,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"She changes, yet she does not change,"
3288,THE VALIANT GIRLS,A moon-lit creature made of pearl
3289,THE VALIANT GIRLS,And filled with music sad and strange:
3290,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"The while she takes your gruff dictation,"
3291,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Who knows her secret meditation!
3292,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Most skilled of all our new machines,"
3293,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"She sits there at the telephone,"
3294,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Prettier far than fabled queens;

3296,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Nor Phidias wrought, nor Homer sung,"
3297,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Girls fairer than the girls that throng,"
3298,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"So serious and so debonair,"
3299,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"At morn and eve, the Subway stair;"
3300,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"A bright processional of faces,"
3301,THE VALIANT GIRLS,So valiant--for all their laces.
3302,THE VALIANT GIRLS,
3303,THE VALIANT GIRLS,The girls that work! that take their share
3304,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"In Life's grim battle, hard and rough,"
3305,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Wearing their crowns of silken hair,"
3306,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Armed only with a powder-puff:
3307,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"These, not the women of old time,"
3308,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Though, doubtless, they were fair enough,"
3309,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Shall be the theme for modern rhyme.
3310,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Nay! never shall our hearts forget
3311,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"The flower face of Juliet,"
3312,THE VALIANT GIRLS,Or Helen on her golden throne;
3313,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"But there shall come a Homer yet,"
3314,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"A Shakespeare still to fame unknown,"
3315,THE VALIANT GIRLS,To sing among the stars up there
3316,THE VALIANT GIRLS,"Fair Helen, the stenographer,"
