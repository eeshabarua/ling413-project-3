145,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
146,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"The leaves rain down upon the forest pond,"
147,I - LA MARE DES FEES,An elfin tarn green-shadowed in the fern;
148,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Nine yews ensomber the wet bank, beyond"
149,I - LA MARE DES FEES,The autumn branches of the beeches burn
150,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"With yellow flame and red amid the green,"
151,I - LA MARE DES FEES,And patches of the darkening sky between.
152,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
153,I - LA MARE DES FEES,This is an ancient country; in this wood
154,I - LA MARE DES FEES,The Druids raised their sacrificial stones;
155,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Here the vast timeless silences still brood
156,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Though the cold wind's October monotones
157,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Fan the enchanted senses with the dread
158,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Of holiness long-past and beauty dead.
159,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
160,I - LA MARE DES FEES,How far beyond this glade the day-world turns
161,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Upon its pivot of reward and chance;
162,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Farther than the first star that palely burns
163,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Over the forest's meditative trance.
164,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"First star of evening, last star of day,"
165,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"The one grows clear, the other dies away."
166,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
167,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Will they come back who once beneath these trees
168,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Invoked their long-forgotten gods with tears,"
169,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Who heard the sob of the same twilight breeze
170,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Blow down the vistas of remembered years,"
171,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Beside the tarn's black waters where they stood
172,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Close to their god, far from the multitude?"
173,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
174,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"I watch, but they are long ago departed,"
175,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Far as the world of day, or as the star;"
176,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"The forest loved her priests, and tranquil-hearted"
177,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"They stole away in dim procession, far"
178,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Down the unechoing aisles, beyond recalling;"
179,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"The moss grows on the stones, the leaves are falling."
180,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
181,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"In vain I listen for their hissing speech,"
182,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"And seek white holy hands upon the air,"
183,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"They told their worship to the yew and beech,"
184,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"And left them with the secret, trembling there,"
185,I - LA MARE DES FEES,Nor shall they come at midnight nor at dawn;
186,I - LA MARE DES FEES,The gods are dead; the votaries are gone.
187,I - LA MARE DES FEES,
188,I - LA MARE DES FEES,A form floats toward me down the corridor
189,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"Of mighty trees, half-visioned through the haze,"
190,I - LA MARE DES FEES,And stands beside me on that empty shore;
191,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"So rest we there, and wonderingly gaze."
192,I - LA MARE DES FEES,"By the dead water, under the deep boughs,"
193,I - LA MARE DES FEES,My Love and I renew our ancient vows.

201,II - PROTHALAMION,Darkens into ocean green
202,II - PROTHALAMION,Flecked palely where the stars will rise.
203,II - PROTHALAMION,A single bough between
204,II - PROTHALAMION,The spacious colour and your half-closed eyes
205,II - PROTHALAMION,Hangs out its hazy traceries.
206,II - PROTHALAMION,"Still, like a drowsy god you lie,"
207,II - PROTHALAMION,"My fair unbidden guest,"
208,II - PROTHALAMION,"Your white hands crossed beneath your head,"
209,II - PROTHALAMION,"Your lips curved strangely mute with peace,"
210,II - PROTHALAMION,Your hair moved lightly by the breeze.
211,II - PROTHALAMION,A glow is shed
212,II - PROTHALAMION,Warm on your face from the last rays that push
213,II - PROTHALAMION,From the dying sun into the green vault of the west.
214,II - PROTHALAMION,
215,II - PROTHALAMION,This is your bridal night; the golden bush
216,II - PROTHALAMION,"Is heavy with the fruits that you will taste,"
217,II - PROTHALAMION,Full ripened in desire.
218,II - PROTHALAMION,"You who have hoarded youth, this is your hour of waste,"
219,II - PROTHALAMION,"Your hour of squandering and drunkenness,"
220,II - PROTHALAMION,"Of wine-dashed lips and generous caress,"
221,II - PROTHALAMION,"Of brows thorn-crowned and bodies crucified,--"
222,II - PROTHALAMION,O bid me to the feast.
223,II - PROTHALAMION,
224,II - PROTHALAMION,"Tomorrow when the hills are washed with fire,"
225,II - PROTHALAMION,"Your door ajar against the flashing East,--"
226,II - PROTHALAMION,O fling it wide.

234,III - MONTMARTRE,"Grey as the soul of silence,"
235,III - MONTMARTRE,Except where two white strutting domes
236,III - MONTMARTRE,Stand aloof and frown
237,III - MONTMARTRE,On the huddled homes
238,III - MONTMARTRE,"Of world-wept love and pain,--"
239,III - MONTMARTRE,"They do not heed that tall disdain,"
240,III - MONTMARTRE,"But sleep, grey, under the stars and the rain."
241,III - MONTMARTRE,
242,III - MONTMARTRE,"A woman, young, but old in love,"
243,III - MONTMARTRE,Carried her child across the square;
244,III - MONTMARTRE,Her face was a dim drifting flame
245,III - MONTMARTRE,To which her pyre of hair
246,III - MONTMARTRE,Was a column of golden smoke.
247,III - MONTMARTRE,
248,III - MONTMARTRE,Her eyes half told the secrets of
249,III - MONTMARTRE,Gay sins that no regret defiled;
250,III - MONTMARTRE,There her heart broke
251,III - MONTMARTRE,In the little question between her eyes.
252,III - MONTMARTRE,"Hearing the trees in the square she smiled,"
253,III - MONTMARTRE,And sang to the child.
254,III - MONTMARTRE,
255,III - MONTMARTRE,So passed by in the narrow street
256,III - MONTMARTRE,"That climbs the steep rock over the town,"
257,III - MONTMARTRE,Love and the west wind in the stars;
258,III - MONTMARTRE,The wind and the sound of those lagging feet
259,III - MONTMARTRE,
260,III - MONTMARTRE,Died like forgotten tears.
261,III - MONTMARTRE,"I waited till the stars went down,"
262,III - MONTMARTRE,And I wrote these lines on a cloud to greet
263,III - MONTMARTRE,The dawn on the crystal stairs.

280,IV - A LETTER,"That you have gleaned, hands tangled in brown hair,"

284,IV - A LETTER,"The hunger of the soul, the watcher left"

287,IV - A LETTER,"Of the old holiness from day to day,"

329,VI - HUNTERS,A vase red-wrought in Athens long ago....
330,VI - HUNTERS,The hunter and his gay companion ride
331,VI - HUNTERS,Through the young fields of life; on every side
332,VI - HUNTERS,Frail and fantastic the tall lilies grow.
333,VI - HUNTERS,"Her head thrown back, her eyes afraid and wide,"
334,VI - HUNTERS,"Flies like a phantom the grey spectral doe,"
335,VI - HUNTERS,"Her light feet scarcely bend the grass below,"
336,VI - HUNTERS,Gloriously flying into eventide.
337,VI - HUNTERS,
338,VI - HUNTERS,"Ahead there lies the shadow, then the dark,"
339,VI - HUNTERS,"And safety in the thick forestial night,"
340,VI - HUNTERS,"But nearer still she hears the bloodhounds bark,"
341,VI - HUNTERS,"And horses panting in impetuous flight,"
342,VI - HUNTERS,"And hunters without pity for the slain,"
343,VI - HUNTERS,Halloing shrilly over the windy plain.
344,VI - HUNTERS,
345,VI - HUNTERS,"Sombre become the skies, the winds of fall"
346,VI - HUNTERS,Sing dangerously through the hissing grass;
347,VI - HUNTERS,Sunlight and clouds in slow procession pass
348,VI - HUNTERS,"Over the tress, then comes an interval"
349,VI - HUNTERS,"Of utter calm, the air is a morass"
350,VI - HUNTERS,Of humid breathlessness. A dreadful call
351,VI - HUNTERS,"Rings suddenly from the onrushing squall,"
352,VI - HUNTERS,And the storm closes in a whirling mass.
353,VI - HUNTERS,
354,VI - HUNTERS,"And still the doe eludes the raging hounds,"
355,VI - HUNTERS,"And still the youths press onward toward the woods,"
356,VI - HUNTERS,Though the world shudders with diluvian sounds
357,VI - HUNTERS,And the rain streams in undulating floods.
358,VI - HUNTERS,Sharp lightning splits the sky; the doe is gone.
359,VI - HUNTERS,O follow! follow! if it be till dawn.
360,VI - HUNTERS,
361,VI - HUNTERS,"The hunted flees, the boyish hunters follow"
362,VI - HUNTERS,"Into the forest's dripping everglades,"
363,VI - HUNTERS,"The wind goes wailing through the swaying shades,"
364,VI - HUNTERS,And violent rain gushes in every hollow.
365,VI - HUNTERS,"The doe runs free, triumphantly evades"
366,VI - HUNTERS,Those straining eyes; the ghastly shadows swallow
367,VI - HUNTERS,Her flying form; the frightened horses wallow
368,VI - HUNTERS,Deep in the mire. Then the last daylight fades.
369,VI - HUNTERS,
370,VI - HUNTERS,"O Youths, turn back! the year is getting late,"
371,VI - HUNTERS,And autumn has no pity for the slain.

373,VI - HUNTERS,"Grope toward you through the blackness and the rain,"
374,VI - HUNTERS,"Then Death, and the obliterating snow...."

443,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Four black poplars beyond the wall,"
444,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Two on each side of the garden gate,"
445,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,In silhouette against the wide
446,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Pale sky of the late eventide.
447,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Close was the garden and serene.
448,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,The leaning reeds in quiet state
449,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"About the pool, merged in the green"
450,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Of misty leaves and hanging vines.
451,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,The fireflies spun their silver lines
452,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Across the deeper atmosphere,"
453,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,And through the silence came the clear
454,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Persistent tuning of the frogs
455,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,From dank recesses of the bogs.

457,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Beyond the garden I could see

469,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Seemed vibrant in the windless air
470,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,That trembled with its presence there.
471,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Out beyond the nameless place
472,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Where neither fields nor clouds exist,"
473,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Grey from the background of the mist,"
474,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,I saw three vague forms drawing near.
475,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,My sense recoiled acute with fear;
476,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,I could not stir. As from a cage
477,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,I watched that spectral dim cortege

483,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"Whiter, statelier, as they drew"
484,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Beneath the shadow of the wall;
485,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,Then one by one the three stepped through

494,X - WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPEN,"The moon went out in a golden blur,"

562,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"And dropping water like a bell,"
563,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Like a bell ringing far away,"
564,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Struck liquid notes in monotone,--"
565,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,An echo of a distant bell
566,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Tolling the knell of yesterday.
567,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Deep down beneath the mossy ground
568,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,The liquid notes in monotone
569,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Kept dropping, dropping endlessly,"
570,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"And as I listened, over me"
571,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Crept like a mist a filmy spell;
572,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"My spirit's waving wings were bound,"
573,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And dreams came that were not my own.
574,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Half-sleeping, half-awake, I heard"
575,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"The drowsy chirp of a forest bird,"
576,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And the wind came up and the grasses stirred
577,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And the curtaining woods that cluster round
578,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That resonantly-echoing well
579,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Shook all their leaves with silver sound
580,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Like voices murmuring in a shell.
581,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Was it the past that lived again
582,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"In that nocturnal murmuring,"
583,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Waking a hidden voice to sing
584,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Deep in my heart of other times
585,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Whose memory long entombed had lain
586,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Covered with all the dust of the years?...
587,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Falling in splashing tears
588,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"The wet notes drop in liquid chimes,"
589,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And the white fingers of the breeze
590,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Gather a song from the melodious trees....
591,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,
592,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,There is a hand whiter than pearl
593,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That plucks a lute's monotonous strings;
594,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,O starlight phantom of a girl
595,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"What lyric soul around thee sings,"
596,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And what divine companionship
597,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Taught that entwining music to thy fingers,"
598,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And that unearthly music to thy lips?

600,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Hovering like wings upon the air.
601,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"I see more clearly now, her hair"
602,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Ripples like a black water-fall
603,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,About the pallor of her face.
604,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,She sits beside a mossy well
605,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Amid some dim marmoreal place,"
606,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Some fragrant Moorish hall
607,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Set all about with arabesques of stone
608,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And intricate mosaics of gem and shell.
609,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"She sings again, she plays a monotone,"
610,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Perpetual rhythm like a far-off bell,"
611,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"And someone dances, in a dancing river"
612,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,The white ecstatic limbs flutter and quiver
613,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Against the shadow. In the odorous flowers
614,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"That grow about the well, still forms are lying,"
615,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"A group of statues, an eternal throng,"
616,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Watching the dance and listening to the song;
617,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"So shall they lie, innumerable hours,"
618,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Silent and motionless for ever.
619,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"The wind comes up, the flowers shiver,"

629,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That the great gods were coming nigh
630,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,To crush the rebellious earth.
631,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Now beneath the crescent moon
632,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"No spirits stir, no wind makes mirth,"
633,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Only a rhythmic monotone
634,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,Of waters dropping in a well....
635,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,
636,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,But who is this so broken with distress
637,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That steals like mist into my loneliness?
638,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Why art thou weeping there, disconsolate child?"
639,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Thy tears fall like the waters of a well,"
640,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And drip in silver notes upon the sands.
641,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"What is thy sorrow? Ah, what man can tell"
642,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,The shapeless fancies that unwelcome dwell
643,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Within thy brain, the spectres, dark and wild"
644,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That haunt the spirit of a child?
645,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"Mayhap thou weepest for the embattled lands,"
646,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,The bloody ruin of decaying realms
647,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,That a war overwhelms
648,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,And buries deep in the dust of history?
649,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"He raises his wet eyes and looks at me,"
650,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"His boyish face full of a yearning,"
651,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"An ancient pain,"
652,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"As of a ghost long dead who yearns to live again,"
653,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"And answers, ""In myself, thy thoughts returning"

655,XII - THE PILGRIMAGE,"And be a child again, and die at last"

1018,VIII,There is a brook where willows lean;

1181,XIII,Like echoes of far-off autumnal bells.

1205,XIII,Of mysteries unknown and vanished lore;

2117,I,Love dwelled with me with music on her lips;
2118,I,Beauty has quickened me to passion; prayer
2119,I,Has cried from me before I was aware
2120,I,When grief was scourging me with scarlet whips.
2121,I,The gods gave me to follies false and fair;
2122,I,"Made me the object of immortal quips,"

2124,I,That gods themselves would be content to share.

2238,VII,Ends in the pressure of a quiet hand.

2254,VIII,The soul's dim gates are broken to let in
2255,VIII,"That gush of memories, and you are near,"

2276,IX,"I am their shepherd, pasturing my sheep."
2277,IX,
2278,IX,They can not change; they can but wander here;

2298,X,"Fraught with a whisper fainter than a breath,"
2299,X,Fanning my spirit with exalted wonder;

2314,XI,Windswept so soon down lanes of memory?

2316,XI,"Through the deep night the trees recount the past,"
2317,XI,"The lovers that have long ago gone hence,"
2318,XI,And whom you joined ere love had reached her prime.
2319,XI,"Chill with an early autumn's immanence,"
2320,XI,"Through the dark night plunges the sudden blast,"
2321,XI,Sweeping the young leaves down before their time.
2322,XI,
2323,XI,
2324,XII,XII
2325,XII,
2326,XII,"I walked the hollow pavements of the town,"
2327,XII,"Lost in the vast entirety of night,"
2328,XII,"The moon was cankered with a greyish blight,"
2329,XII,And half her face was gathered in a frown.
2330,XII,"A hooded watchman passed me, and his gown"
2331,XII,"Was dyed so black it made the darkness white,"
2332,XII,"He turned upon my face his curious light,"
2333,XII,And whispered as he wandered up and down.
2334,XII,
2335,XII,"Then there were curling lanes and then a hill,"
2336,XII,"And sentry stars that guard the Absolute,"
2337,XII,"And spectral feet that followed me, until"
2338,XII,"The vapours rose, and somewhere in the mute"
2339,XII,"And hesitating dawn, a single flute"
2340,XII,"Piped once again the grey, and then was still."
2341,XII,
2342,XII,
2343,XIII,XIII
2344,XIII,
2345,XIII,In tireless march I move from sphere to sphere.
2346,XIII,I turn not back nor pause; my feet are drawn
2347,XIII,"By shining power. Master soul or pawn,"
2348,XIII,I know not which I am; I only hear
2349,XIII,The faint insistent world voice murmuring on
2350,XIII,Its pivot in another atmosphere;
2351,XIII,"All else is silence, the pervading year"
2352,XIII,Blows wanly through my senses and is gone.
2353,XIII,
2354,XIII,O You who met me on the sunny lawn
2355,XIII,"Of yesteryear, to be my true companion,"
2356,XIII,And bade me lead you with me from the dawn
2357,XIII,"Into the shades of my predestined canon,"
2358,XIII,How is it that I find myself alone
2359,XIII,Here in this desolate and starry zone?
2360,XIII,
2361,XIII,
2362,XIV,XIV
2363,XIV,
2364,XIV,"A while you shared my path and solitude,"
2365,XIV,"A while you ate the bread of loneliness,"
2366,XIV,And satisfied yourself with a caress
2367,XIV,Or with a careless overflow of mood.
2368,XIV,"And then you left me suddenly, to press"
2369,XIV,"Into the world again, and seek your food"
2370,XIV,"Among the mortals whom you understood,"
2371,XIV,Instead of learning in the wilderness.
2372,XIV,
2373,XIV,"Now you return to where you fled from me,"
2374,XIV,"And find me gone. You call me from afar,"
2375,XIV,And call in vain; I can not turn to see
2376,XIV,"You loveliness, beloved as you are."
2377,XIV,"Inexorably I move from sphere to sphere,"
2378,XIV,"Nor wait for any soul, however dear."
2379,XIV,
2380,XIV,
2381,XV,XV
2382,XV,
2383,XV,"There is a void that reason can not face,"
2384,XV,"Nor wisdom comprehend, nor sweating will"
2385,XV,"Diminish, nor the rain of April fill,"
2386,XV,And I am weary of this wan grimace.
2387,XV,Behold I touch the garments of all ill
2388,XV,And do not wash my hands; a dusty place
2389,XV,Unprobed by light becomes a loud mill race
2390,XV,That swirls together straw and daffodil.
2391,XV,
2392,XV,It is untrue that vigil can not trace
2393,XV,The orbits which upon our births distil
2394,XV,The filtered dew of fate; I saw the hill
2395,XV,"That I must climb, and gauged the upward pace;"
2396,XV,"And now upon the night's worn window sill,"
2397,XV,"I wait and smile. Hail, Judas, full of grace."
2398,XV,
2399,XV,
2400,XVI,XVI
2401,XVI,
2402,XVI,The mirrors of all ages are the eyes
2403,XVI,"Of some remembering god, wherein are sealed"
2404,XVI,"The beauties of the world, the April field,"
2405,XVI,"Young faces, blowing hair, and autumn skies."
2406,XVI,"The mirrors of the world shall break, and yield"
2407,XVI,To life again what never really dies;
2408,XVI,"The forms and colours of earth's pageantries,"
2409,XVI,"Unwithered and undimmed, shall be revealed."
2410,XVI,
2411,XVI,And in that moment silence shall unfold
2412,XVI,"Forgotten songs that she has held interred,"
2413,XVI,"The ocean rising on the shores of gold,"
2414,XVI,Flecked with white laughter and love's lyric word;
2415,XVI,All happy music that the world has heard;
2416,XVI,All beauty that eternal eyes behold.
2417,XVI,
2418,XVI,
2419,XVII,XVII
2420,XVII,
2421,XVII,"We sat in silence till the twilight fell,"
2422,XVII,And then beyond the vague and purple arc
2423,XVII,"Where sky and ocean merge, a summons. ""Hark!"
2424,XVII,"Clear notes like water falling in a well,"
2425,XVII,"Can you not hear?"" ""No, but a sudden dark"
2426,XVII,"Seems to enfold me, lonely and terrible."""
2427,XVII,"Out of the sunset, a black caravel"
2428,XVII,"Drew near, and then I knew I should embark."
2429,XVII,
2430,XVII,"I saw it tack against the fading skies,"
2431,XVII,"I heard its keel slide crunching up the sand,"
2432,XVII,"Then turned, and read, deep in the other's eyes,"
2433,XVII,The pain of one who can not understand.
2434,XVII,"Dusk deepened over the insurging seas,"
2435,XVII,And loose sails crackled in the rising breeze.
2436,XVII,
2437,XVII,
2438,XVIII,XVIII
2439,XVIII,
2440,XVIII,"He clung to me, his young face dark with woe,"
2441,XVIII,And as the mournful music of the tide
2442,XVIII,"Monotonously sang, he stood and cried,"
2443,XVIII,A silhouette against the afterglow.
2444,XVIII,"I said, ""The boat has spread her pinions wide;"
2445,XVIII,The stars and wind come forth together. Go
2446,XVIII,"Back to our ivy-haunted portico,"
2447,XVIII,"And place my seat as always at your side."""
2448,XVIII,
2449,XVIII,And so I stepped aboard and left him there.
2450,XVIII,Farewell; the rhythmic somnolence of oars;
2451,XVIII,Star-misty vastness; swiftly moving air;
2452,XVIII,Then distant lights on undiscovered shores.
2453,XVIII,"This I remember, standing by the sea,"
2454,XVIII,"But where was that dark land, and who were we?"
2455,XVIII,
2456,XVIII,
2457,XVIII,
2458,XVIII,
2459,XVIII,
