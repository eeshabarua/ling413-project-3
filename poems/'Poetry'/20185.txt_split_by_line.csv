184,CHAPTER I.,
185,CHAPTER I.,
186,CHAPTER I.,Clear and loud on the hushed silence of the midnight hour rang the chimes
187,CHAPTER I.,"of the village clock, from the tall steeple-tower of the quaint old"
188,CHAPTER I.,"church of Wimbledon, while several ambitious chickens rose from their"
189,CHAPTER I.,"neighboring perches, piped a shrill answering salute, and sank to their"
190,CHAPTER I.,nocturnal slumbers again. But nor clock nor chanticleer disturbed
191,CHAPTER I.,Wimbledon. Still she slept on beneath the blossoming stars; and by their
192,CHAPTER I.,"soft, inspiring light, with your permission, gentle reader, we'll enter"
193,CHAPTER I.,the sleeping village.
194,CHAPTER I.,
195,CHAPTER I.,"Dim gleams of snowy cottages, peeping through a wealth of embowering"
196,CHAPTER I.,"vines, steal on our star-lighted vision as we roam along the grassy"
197,CHAPTER I.,"streets, and we scent the breath of gardens odorous with the sweets of"
198,CHAPTER I.,dew-watered flowers. Above and around we hear the musical stir of the
199,CHAPTER I.,"night wind among boughs and branches of luxuriant foliage, while ever and"
200,CHAPTER I.,"anon it comes from afar with a deep-toned, solemn murmur, as though it"
201,CHAPTER I.,swept o'er forests of cedar and mournfully-echoing pine. Still roaming
202,CHAPTER I.,"on, the low rippling of flowing waters comes soothingly to our ears, and"
203,CHAPTER I.,we pause on the bank of a flower-bordered river that goes sweetly singing
204,CHAPTER I.,on its way to the distant ocean. A tiny sailboat lies in a sheltering
205,CHAPTER I.,"cove, rocked gently to and fro by the swaying current. On a hill beyond"
206,CHAPTER I.,"the stream we mark a large white-belfried building, relieved against a"
207,CHAPTER I.,dark background of wide-stretching timber-land. And turning our delighted
208,CHAPTER I.,"footsteps down an avenue of lofty cedar and linden trees, there rises at"
209,CHAPTER I.,"length before our vision a splendid mansion, built after a most beautiful"
210,CHAPTER I.,"style of architecture, with deep, bay windows, long corridors and"
211,CHAPTER I.,"vine-covered terraces. Magnificent gardens, displaying the perfection of"
212,CHAPTER I.,"taste, lay sloping to the southward. On the east the silvery river was"
213,CHAPTER I.,seen glancing through the shrubbery that adorned its banks. To the west
214,CHAPTER I.,"lay a beautiful park and pleasure ground, while far away to the northward"
215,CHAPTER I.,"stretched the deep, dense forest, tall, dark and sombre."
216,CHAPTER I.,
217,CHAPTER I.,"And over all this lovely scene the stars shed their mild, ethereal light."
218,CHAPTER I.,"O, Wimbledon! art thou not beautiful 'neath their soft, silver gleams?"
219,CHAPTER I.,And doth not shadowy-vested romance roam thy grassy paths and
220,CHAPTER I.,"flower-strewn ways to-night, and with her wild, mysterious eyes gloating"
221,CHAPTER I.,"on thy entrancing scenery, doth she not resolve to dwell awhile, 'mid thy"
222,CHAPTER I.,"embowering vines, thy dewy-petalled flowers, mournfully-musical"
223,CHAPTER I.,"cedar-groves, and web a fiction from the thousand tangled threads which"
224,CHAPTER I.,complicate and ramify thy social life?
225,CHAPTER I.,
226,CHAPTER I.,We shall see what we shall see in Wimbledon; for gray dawn is already
227,CHAPTER I.,"breaking in the dappled east, and a man, closely buttoned to the chin in"
228,CHAPTER I.,"a gray overcoat, emerges from a large brick mansion on the outskirts of"
229,CHAPTER I.,"the village, and directs his steps toward an old, black, rickety-looking"
230,CHAPTER I.,"house, which stands just on the bank of the river, surrounded by a"
231,CHAPTER I.,tangled growth of brush-wood.
232,CHAPTER I.,
233,CHAPTER I.,Here the gairish day at length disclosed what the modest night had
234,CHAPTER I.,obscured with her diamond veil of stars. Squalid poverty glared through
235,CHAPTER I.,"the broken window-panes, and want seemed clattering her doleful song on"
236,CHAPTER I.,"the flying clapboards and crazy casements. A feeble, struggling light"
237,CHAPTER I.,from within showed the inmates were stirring as the man in the overcoat
238,CHAPTER I.,"gave a loud, careless thump on the trembling door, which was opened by a"
239,CHAPTER I.,"pale, gaunt-looking urchin, clad in garments bearing patches of divers"
240,CHAPTER I.,hues.
241,CHAPTER I.,
242,CHAPTER I.,"""Is your mother at home, Bill?"" inquired the man, gruffly."
243,CHAPTER I.,
244,CHAPTER I.,"""Yes, sir,"" answered the boy in a meek tone; ""will you please to walk in,"
245,CHAPTER I.,"Mr. Pimble?"""
246,CHAPTER I.,
247,CHAPTER I.,"""No; tell her I want her to come and wash for me to-day,"" said the man,"
248,CHAPTER I.,"in a harsh, rough voice, as he turned away."
249,CHAPTER I.,
250,CHAPTER I.,"The boy bowed and reëntered the miserable apartment, where a few soggy"
251,CHAPTER I.,chips smoked on a bed of embers that were gathered in the corner of a
252,CHAPTER I.,"huge fire-place. A woman, with a begrimed cotton handkerchief tied over"
253,CHAPTER I.,"her head, sat on the hearth endeavoring to blow them into a blaze, while"
254,CHAPTER I.,"the smoke, that poured down the foul and blackened chimney, caused the"
255,CHAPTER I.,"tears to roll from her eyes, and baffled her efforts."
256,CHAPTER I.,
257,CHAPTER I.,"""Never mind the fire, mother,"" said the lad, approaching; ""I'll try and"
258,CHAPTER I.,pick up some dry sticks in course of the day to have the room warm when
259,CHAPTER I.,"you come home to-night. Mr. Pimble has just called, and wants you to go"
260,CHAPTER I.,"and wash for him to-day."""
261,CHAPTER I.,
262,CHAPTER I.,"""He won't pay me a cent if I go,"" answered the woman moodily; ""all my"
263,CHAPTER I.,drudgery for that family goes to pay the rent of this miserable old
264,CHAPTER I.,"shell."""
265,CHAPTER I.,
266,CHAPTER I.,"""I think he will give you something to-day, mother, if you tell him how"
267,CHAPTER I.,"needy we are,"" suggested the boy."
268,CHAPTER I.,
269,CHAPTER I.,"""Never a cent,"" said the woman, with a gloomy shake of her head;"
270,CHAPTER I.,"""however, I may as well go. I shall get a cup of tea and bit of dinner,"
271,CHAPTER I.,"and I'll look out to bring you a cake, Willie."""
272,CHAPTER I.,
273,CHAPTER I.,"""O, will you, mother?"" exclaimed the boy, his wan features brightening"
274,CHAPTER I.,momentarily at the prospect of a single cake to appease the gnawings of
275,CHAPTER I.,hunger.
276,CHAPTER I.,
277,CHAPTER I.,"The woman threw a coarse, threadbare blanket over her shoulders and went"
278,CHAPTER I.,"forth, while the boy bent his way along the riverbank in search of dry"
279,CHAPTER I.,twigs and branches with which to replenish their wasted stock of fuel.
280,CHAPTER I.,"And he thought, as he picked up here and there the scanty sticks and laid"
281,CHAPTER I.,"them in small bundles, of some lines of poetry he read on a bit of"
282,CHAPTER I.,newspaper that blew across his path one day:
283,CHAPTER I.,
284,CHAPTER I.,"""If joy and pain in this nether world,"
285,CHAPTER I.,"Must fairly balanced be,"
286,CHAPTER I.,"O, why not some of the _pain_ to them."
287,CHAPTER I.,"And some of the _joy_ to me?"""
288,CHAPTER I.,
289,CHAPTER I.,And he could not settle the point in his youthful mind. He could not
290,CHAPTER I.,"tell why David Pimble should go to school the year round at the great,"
291,CHAPTER I.,"white seminary on the hill, while he could only go about two months in"
292,CHAPTER I.,"the cold, biting winter to a town-school a mile distant. He could not"
293,CHAPTER I.,"tell why said David should have warm woollen jackets, while his were"
294,CHAPTER I.,threadbare and patched with rags; nor why David should fare sumptuously
295,CHAPTER I.,"on buttered toast and smoking muffins, while he starved on the crusts"
296,CHAPTER I.,that were cast from his well-spread table.
297,CHAPTER I.,
298,CHAPTER I.,All these were knotty points which poor little Willie Danforth was too
299,CHAPTER I.,"young and untaught to solve. When he should be older and wiser, would he"
300,CHAPTER I.,be able to solve them? He didn't know;--he hoped so; though he feared he
301,CHAPTER I.,"never would be much wiser than now, if he was always to remain so poor,"

303,CHAPTER I.,
304,CHAPTER I.,There's one school whose doors are and have ever been open wide for
305,CHAPTER I.,Willie--the school of poverty and experience. Lessons swift and bitter
306,CHAPTER I.,are indelibly impressed on the minds of the pupils there.
307,CHAPTER I.,
308,CHAPTER I.,"Thoughtful and abstracted, Willie wandered along, gathering his little"
309,CHAPTER I.,"bundles of firewood, till he found himself at the foot of the hill on"
310,CHAPTER I.,"which stood the great, white seminary where David Pimble, his brother and"
311,CHAPTER I.,"sister, went to school month after month and year after year. He heard"
312,CHAPTER I.,"voices, and, looking up, beheld the little group that were occupying his"
313,CHAPTER I.,"thoughts, on the hill-top, laughing and mocking at him as he toiled along"
314,CHAPTER I.,"with his bundles of sticks. His cheeks glowed with anger for a moment,"
315,CHAPTER I.,"and then grew ashy pale, as he plodded on toward his miserable home."
316,CHAPTER I.,
317,CHAPTER I.,"Dilly Danforth, the poor washerwoman, had seen better days; but the"
318,CHAPTER I.,"drunken dissipation of a husband, who was now in his grave, had reduced"
319,CHAPTER I.,"her to abject, despairing poverty. Her unfortunate marriage and"
320,CHAPTER I.,"persistence in clinging to the man of her choice, and enduring all his"
321,CHAPTER I.,"abuses, excited the displeasure of her family, and they cast her from"
322,CHAPTER I.,them to suffer and struggle on as best she might. She knew not as she had
323,CHAPTER I.,"a relative in the world. She surely had no friend, save Willie, her"
324,CHAPTER I.,"little boy, with whom she dwelt in the comfortless abode we have briefly"
325,CHAPTER I.,visited.
326,CHAPTER I.,
327,CHAPTER I.,"Alas for the suffering poor! How prone are the wealthy, by warm, glowing"
328,CHAPTER I.,"grates, to forget their cheerless habitations, and turn inhumanly from"
329,CHAPTER I.,their pitiful tales of want and destitution!
330,CHAPTER I.,
331,CHAPTER I.,
332,CHAPTER I.,
333,CHAPTER I.,
334,CHAPTER II.,CHAPTER II.
335,CHAPTER II.,
336,CHAPTER II.,"""This work-day world, this work-day world,"
337,CHAPTER II.,"How it doth plod along!"""
338,CHAPTER II.,
339,CHAPTER II.,
340,CHAPTER II.,"Tap, tap, tap, on the back kitchen door of Esq. Pimble's great brick"
341,CHAPTER II.,"mansion, and a clattering of plates and tea things within which quite"
342,CHAPTER II.,"drowned the timid knock. A second and louder one brought a fat, red-faced"
343,CHAPTER II.,"woman with rolled-up sleeves and a dish-towel in hand, to answer the"
344,CHAPTER II.,summons.
345,CHAPTER II.,
346,CHAPTER II.,"""Sakes, Dilly Danforth!"" exclaimed she, on beholding the well-known,"
347,CHAPTER II.,"faded blanket of the washerwoman; ""what brings you here so airly in the"
348,CHAPTER II.,"mornin'? If you are after cold victuals, I can tell you you can't have"
349,CHAPTER II.,"any, for mistress--"""
350,CHAPTER II.,
351,CHAPTER II.,"""I am not come seeking charity,"" said Dilly, cutting short the woman's"
352,CHAPTER II.,"brawling speech; ""Mr. Pimble wished me to come and wash for him to day."""
353,CHAPTER II.,
354,CHAPTER II.,"""_He_ did?"" said the bold-visaged housekeeper, opening her large,"
355,CHAPTER II.,"buttermilk-colored eyes with astonishment; ""well, for sure!""--and here"
356,CHAPTER II.,"she seemed debating some matter in her mind for several moments, her hand"
357,CHAPTER II.,still holding the door in forbidding proximity to poor Mrs. Danforth's
358,CHAPTER II.,"pale, grief-worn face."
359,CHAPTER II.,
360,CHAPTER II.,"""Well, you can come in then, I s'pose,"" she said, at length, flinging it"
361,CHAPTER II.,"open spitefully, and returning to the wiping of her breakfast dishes,"
362,CHAPTER II.,"which she sent together with such a crash, that poor Dilly, as she stood"
363,CHAPTER II.,"over the stove trying to warm her chilly fingers by a decaying fire,"
364,CHAPTER II.,momentarily expected to see them scattered over the floor in a thousand
365,CHAPTER II.,fragments.
366,CHAPTER II.,
367,CHAPTER II.,"""Sakes! are you cold this warm spring morning?"" snarled the plump,"
368,CHAPTER II.,"well-fed housekeeper, as she thumped back and forth, carrying her piles"
369,CHAPTER II.,"of plates to the cupboard. ""Why don't you shut the outside door after"
370,CHAPTER II.,"you, then? For my part, I'm most roasted to death."""
371,CHAPTER II.,
372,CHAPTER II.,"""You have been in a warm room, while I have not seen a fire this"
373,CHAPTER II.,"morning,"" said Dilly, meekly, as she closed the door and returned to her"
374,CHAPTER II.,place by the stove.
375,CHAPTER II.,
376,CHAPTER II.,"""Well, I wish I hadn't,"" answered the ireful Mrs. Peggy Nonce;--""a hard"
377,CHAPTER II.,"fate is mine; sweltering over a great fire all my life, to cook for a"
378,CHAPTER II.,family that don't know nothing only to make the work as hard as they can.
379,CHAPTER II.,"Now, here's Mr. Pimble goes and gets you here to wash; never tells me a"
380,CHAPTER II.,word about it till you come right in upon me just as I have got my
381,CHAPTER II.,"breakfast things cleared away, settin'-room swept out, and fire all down"
382,CHAPTER II.,"in the kitchen. I s'pose you have had nothing to eat to-day, for you"
383,CHAPTER II.,"always come half starved, though why you do so I don't know, save to make"
384,CHAPTER II.,me work and get all you can out of us. When Mr. Pimble rents you that
385,CHAPTER II.,"great house so cheap, too! I declare, I should think, with all that man's"
386,CHAPTER II.,"trials, he would get to be a hypocrite and believe in total"
387,CHAPTER II.,"annihilation."""
388,CHAPTER II.,
389,CHAPTER II.,Dilly made no reply to this speech. Probably the latter part was beyond
390,CHAPTER II.,her simple comprehension.
391,CHAPTER II.,
392,CHAPTER II.,"Mr. Pimble himself, the man of trials, as his housekeeper affirmed, now"
393,CHAPTER II.,"opened the sitting-room door and looked forth. He was habited in a long,"
394,CHAPTER II.,"faded, palm-figured bed-gown, all muffled up round his chin, and"
395,CHAPTER II.,"sheep-skin slippers without heels. He had a lank, pale, discouraged"
396,CHAPTER II.,"visage, and thin, light hair, streaked with gray, in a very untidy state"
397,CHAPTER II.,straggling about his face. He pulled his wrapper up yet closer about his
398,CHAPTER II.,"head, when he discovered the washerwoman, and shambled across the"
399,CHAPTER II.,"clean-swept floor, his heelless slippers going clip-clap after him, as he"
400,CHAPTER II.,"stalked along. What a gaunt, unhealthy-looking personage was the rich"
401,CHAPTER II.,"Peter Paul Pimble, Esq., of Mudget Square!"
402,CHAPTER II.,
403,CHAPTER II.,"""Well, you are come, then, are you?"" said he, glancing toward the kitchen"
404,CHAPTER II.,"clock, which was on the stroke of eight; ""pretty time to commence a day's"
405,CHAPTER II.,"work."""
406,CHAPTER II.,
407,CHAPTER II.,"""And she has had no breakfast; and the water is not in the kettles,"" put"
408,CHAPTER II.,"in dame Peggy. ""I could have had that all hot for her, if you had just"
409,CHAPTER II.,told me she was comin' to wash. But some folks always like to be so sly
410,CHAPTER II.,"and underhanded."""
411,CHAPTER II.,
412,CHAPTER II.,"""Stop your clack!"" said the master, turning toward her with an angry"
413,CHAPTER II.,"glance, ""and get a bite of something to eat while she is putting her"
414,CHAPTER II.,water on and building a fire. I shall be at home through the day to
415,CHAPTER II.,"superintend matters and see that all is done to my wishes."""
416,CHAPTER II.,
417,CHAPTER II.,"Thus saying, he scuffled back to his warm fire in the parlor; for, though"
418,CHAPTER II.,"it was a bright morning in the early part of May, and odorous flowers"
419,CHAPTER II.,"opening their petals to the genial sunbeams, and groups of singing birds"
420,CHAPTER II.,"merry on all the foliage-covered trees, still Esq. Pimble was"
421,CHAPTER II.,"cold--always cold, summer and winter. No genial influence could warm his"
422,CHAPTER II.,"sluggish blood, or impart a glow to his dry, parchment-colored face."
423,CHAPTER II.,
424,CHAPTER II.,"There he sat; his feet poised on the fender, and a newspaper in his"
425,CHAPTER II.,"skinny clutch, from which he seemed to read. Now and then he yawned,"
426,CHAPTER II.,"stretched himself, approached the window, gazed forth for a moment with"
427,CHAPTER II.,"some anxiety depicted on his expressionless face, and then sunk down in"
428,CHAPTER II.,his cushioned chair again. All the while the washing was going on briskly
429,CHAPTER II.,"in the kitchen. Peggy Nonce had outlived her morning's asperity, and"
430,CHAPTER II.,"concluded to bake a batch of dried apple pies, as there must be a fire"
431,CHAPTER II.,"kept in the stove for Billy, and it would save burning the wood another"
432,CHAPTER II.,day for the express purpose of cooking operations. So it appeared dame
433,CHAPTER II.,"Peggy, with all her tempers, had one good point at least, and one but"
434,CHAPTER II.,"seldom found in servants,--a lookout for her employer's interests. The"
435,CHAPTER II.,"bluffy housekeeper was given to gossip, too, as all of her class are; and"
436,CHAPTER II.,who could give her a better synopsis of the private affairs of half the
437,CHAPTER II.,"families in Wimbledon, than Dilly Danforth, the washerwoman, who"
438,CHAPTER II.,performed the drudgery and slop-work in many of the fine homes of the
439,CHAPTER II.,"upper class? But, after all, Peggy had more to give than receive; for by"
440,CHAPTER II.,"some means the poor washerwoman did not seem possessed of the ""gift of"
441,CHAPTER II.,"gab."" She was lamentably ignorant on many points where Peggy thought,"
442,CHAPTER II.,"with her advantages, _she_ would have been well-informed and able to"
443,CHAPTER II.,"answer any question proposed. And so the news-loving housekeeper, though"
444,CHAPTER II.,"she remembered her master's interests in the article of firewood, was"
445,CHAPTER II.,"fain to forget them in a matter of far more importance, and broached"
446,CHAPTER II.,forth into a long tale of his trials and domestic discomforts. Warming
447,CHAPTER II.,"with her discourse as she proceeded, her voice grew so shrill and"
448,CHAPTER II.,"vehement, that Mr. Pimble, had he not been deeply engaged in poring over"
449,CHAPTER II.,the trials his loquacious housekeeper was so eloquently setting forth to
450,CHAPTER II.,"her silent and rather inattentive listener, he would have discovered"
451,CHAPTER II.,himself the hero of a tale which might have lost Mrs. Peggy Nonee a
452,CHAPTER II.,place she had occupied half a lifetime. But Mr. Pimble sat in bed-gown
453,CHAPTER II.,"and slippers till dinner was announced at one P.M., and the three young"
454,CHAPTER II.,"Pimbles tumbled into the hall in boisterous glee, just escaped from the"
455,CHAPTER II.,"restraint of school discipline. They all rushed to the table at once,"
456,CHAPTER II.,"and called for half a dozen kinds of food in a voice, which the glum,"
457,CHAPTER II.,abstracted father heaped indiscriminately on their plates. There was no
458,CHAPTER II.,"sound save the clatter of knives and forks for several minutes, while"
459,CHAPTER II.,the interesting family discussed their amply-provided and well-prepared
460,CHAPTER II.,"meal. At length Master Garrison Pimble, a lad of a dozen years, declared"
461,CHAPTER II.,"sister Sukey had got the biggest piece of venison pie. Susan, a little"
462,CHAPTER II.,"girl of seven summers, said she ""didn't care if she had; she ought to"
463,CHAPTER II.,"have."""
464,CHAPTER II.,
465,CHAPTER II.,"""No, you oughtn't either,"" returned Master Garrison, ""for you are not"
466,CHAPTER II.,"half as big as I."""
467,CHAPTER II.,
468,CHAPTER II.,"""I don't care for that,"" lisped Susan; ""mammy says women ought to have"
469,CHAPTER II.,"the best and most of everything, and do just what they like to, and go"
470,CHAPTER II.,"just where they want to."""
471,CHAPTER II.,
472,CHAPTER II.,"""Well, they shouldn't do any such thing, should they, father?"" demanded"
473,CHAPTER II.,the argument-loving Garrison.
474,CHAPTER II.,
475,CHAPTER II.,"""Eat your dinners quietly, my children,"" returned the silent father, ""and"
476,CHAPTER II.,"not meddle with matters you do not understand."""
477,CHAPTER II.,
478,CHAPTER II.,"""But I do understand them,"" continued the youth. ""I know sister Sukey"
479,CHAPTER II.,"ought not to have the largest piece of pie, and she shan't."""
480,CHAPTER II.,
481,CHAPTER II.,"Thus saying, he made a dive at Miss Susan's plate, and bore off her"
482,CHAPTER II.,generous slice of venison pastry on his fork. Susey screamed at the top
483,CHAPTER II.,"of her voice, and, clutching her hands in her brother's hair, she pulled"
484,CHAPTER II.,"it so vigorously he was fain to drop his prize, which fell to the carpet"
485,CHAPTER II.,"and was devoured by a half-starved grimalkin, while he boxed his sister's"
486,CHAPTER II.,ears soundly for her vixen attack upon his bushy black hair.
487,CHAPTER II.,
488,CHAPTER II.,"""I'll learn you to pull my hair!"" said he, with a very red face."
489,CHAPTER II.,
490,CHAPTER II.,"""I'll learn you to steal my pie!"" shrieked she, as, maddened by her"
491,CHAPTER II.,"smarting ears, she flew at him and dug long, bloody scratches in his"
492,CHAPTER II.,"cheeks with her sharp little nails. The father now parted the combatants,"
493,CHAPTER II.,"and shut the warlike Susey in the closet, where she was loud in"
494,CHAPTER II.,"pronouncing maledictions against her brother, and heaping vituperations"
495,CHAPTER II.,"upon her father; declaring, when mammy came home, she would tell her how"
496,CHAPTER II.,"she was abused in her absence, and mammy would take sides with her,"
497,CHAPTER II.,"because she knew men were all cross and ugly, and tried to hurt and wrong"
498,CHAPTER II.,poor feeble woman. Garrison and David finished their meal in silence; and
499,CHAPTER II.,"when the seminary bell rang to announce the hour for reöpening of school,"
500,CHAPTER II.,"Mr. Pimble liberated Susey, and all went shouting off together."
501,CHAPTER II.,
502,CHAPTER II.,"Then he called in Dilly and the housekeeper, and, while they dined on the"
503,CHAPTER II.,"fragments, went out in the kitchen to inspect the progress there. All"
504,CHAPTER II.,"seemed to be moving on well, and, as he was returning to his seat by the"
505,CHAPTER II.,"sitting-room fire, a covered buggy drove to the front piazza, and a"
506,CHAPTER II.,gentleman descended and assisted two ladies to alight. Directly the
507,CHAPTER II.,"parlor was dashed open, and the trio made their entry. Foremost was the"
508,CHAPTER II.,"mistress of the mansion, Mrs. Judith Justitia Pimble. What a puny,"
509,CHAPTER II.,"trembling thing appeared the husband, as he stood there like a galvanized"
510,CHAPTER II.,"mummy in presence of that tall, portly woman, with her broad shoulders"
511,CHAPTER II.,"and commanding aspect! Her first act was to smother the fire; her second,"
512,CHAPTER II.,"to throw open the windows; her third, to ensconce herself in her liege"
513,CHAPTER II.,"lord's easy-chair, and bid her guests lay aside their travelling garbs,"
514,CHAPTER II.,"and make themselves at home. Finding his comfortable seat appropriated,"
515,CHAPTER II.,"and no notice vouchsafed him, Mr. Pimble shuffled off into the kitchen."
516,CHAPTER II.,
517,CHAPTER II.,"""Was that your husband, sister Justitia?"" inquired the lady visitor, as"
518,CHAPTER II.,"she threw off her shawl and bonnet, with an energetic toss."
519,CHAPTER II.,
520,CHAPTER II.,"""Yes,"" answered the majestic lady in her most majestic tone, ""that was"
521,CHAPTER II.,"Pimble. You will not mind him at all; he is as near nothing as can be,--a"
522,CHAPTER II.,"mere crank to keep the machine in motion,--you understand. He has his"
523,CHAPTER II.,"sphere, however. The lowest brute animals have theirs. Pimble's is to"
524,CHAPTER II.,"stay at home and superintend the minor matters of life, such as milking"
525,CHAPTER II.,"the kine, feeding the chickens, and slaughtering a lamb occasionally to"
526,CHAPTER II.,"subserve the grosser wants of poor human nature. In brief, all those"
527,CHAPTER II.,trivial and perplexing things in which a superior mind cannot be supposed
528,CHAPTER II.,"to feel an interest, and by which it is not right it should be fettered,"
529,CHAPTER II.,and prevented from soaring to its own lofty sphere of thought and
530,CHAPTER II.,"action."""
531,CHAPTER II.,
532,CHAPTER II.,Mrs. Pimble paused for breath as she delivered herself of the above
533,CHAPTER II.,"voluble speech, and the lady visitor replied:"
534,CHAPTER II.,
535,CHAPTER II.,"""You speak heroicly, sister Justitia. I see you have obtained your"
536,CHAPTER II.,"rightful position in your own household. O, would that all our crushed"
537,CHAPTER II.,and down-trodden sisters were possessed of but a tithe of your energy and
538,CHAPTER II.,"independence of character! Then would our young Reform, which encounters"
539,CHAPTER II.,on every side the swords and pickaxes of infuriate battalions of the
540,CHAPTER II.,"tyrant man, ride in triumphal chariot over our whole broad country's"
541,CHAPTER II.,"proud domain!"""
542,CHAPTER II.,
543,CHAPTER II.,"""Ah, sister Simcoe, how doth your inspired language fill my soul with"
544,CHAPTER II.,fire! I rejoice that you are come among us. How will your presence
545,CHAPTER II.,"encourage our ranks, and, in the triumph of your medical skill, vile male"
546,CHAPTER II.,usurpers of the healing art shall sink to rise no more! I long to read
547,CHAPTER II.,"again the proceedings of our late convention, the thrilling speeches, the"
548,CHAPTER II.,"sweeping resolutions!"""
549,CHAPTER II.,
550,CHAPTER II.,"""Let us thus occupy ourselves,"" said young Dr. Simcoe, turning toward a"
551,CHAPTER II.,remote corner of the apartment where sat the small man who had
552,CHAPTER II.,"accompanied the ladies, perched on a hard, uncushioned chair, his hands"
553,CHAPTER II.,"folded in his lap, and his eyes bent studiously on the carpet. This was"
554,CHAPTER II.,"the personage on whom the accomplished young medical practitioner had, a"
555,CHAPTER II.,"few months previous, condescended to bestow the princely honor of her"
556,CHAPTER II.,hand.
557,CHAPTER II.,
558,CHAPTER II.,"""Sim,"" said the eloquent wife, as she glanced carelessly upon him, ""where"
559,CHAPTER II.,"are the portmanteaus?"""
560,CHAPTER II.,
561,CHAPTER II.,"""In the entry,"" answered the small man, raising his eyes for a moment to"
562,CHAPTER II.,his fair consort's face.
563,CHAPTER II.,
564,CHAPTER II.,"""Bring them in and open them,"" said the lady, again sinking down in her"
565,CHAPTER II.,soft seat.
566,CHAPTER II.,
567,CHAPTER II.,"The small man disappeared in a twinkling, and the portmanteaus were soon"
568,CHAPTER II.,"placed on the table, and their contents spread forth."
569,CHAPTER II.,
570,CHAPTER II.,"""I will now order some refreshment,"" said Mrs. Pimble;--""and while it is"
571,CHAPTER II.,"preparing, we can amuse ourselves with the documents. What would you"
572,CHAPTER II.,"prefer for your dinner, sister Simcoe?"""
573,CHAPTER II.,
574,CHAPTER II.,"""Pea soup,"" returned the lady doctor; ""that is my uniform dish,--simple"
575,CHAPTER II.,"and plain."""
576,CHAPTER II.,
577,CHAPTER II.,"""And Mr. Simcoe, what would he choose?"""
578,CHAPTER II.,
579,CHAPTER II.,"""O, he has no choice!--anything that comes handiest will do for him."""
580,CHAPTER II.,
581,CHAPTER II.,Mrs. Pimble glanced toward Mr. Simcoe. Mr. Simcoe simpered and bowed. So
582,CHAPTER II.,Mrs. Pimble swept into the kitchen to issue her commands. She started on
583,CHAPTER II.,beholding Dilly Danforth bending over a wash-tub filled to the brim with
584,CHAPTER II.,"smoking linen, just out of a boiling suds. Darting one fiery glance"
585,CHAPTER II.,"toward her forceless husband, sitting humped up over the stove, his head"
586,CHAPTER II.,"supported on his hands, she exclaimed, ""What does this mean?"" Mr. Pimble"
587,CHAPTER II.,looked up vacantly; Peggy turned round from her occupation of washing the
588,CHAPTER II.,"dinner dishes, and Dilly kept to her wash-tub. No one seemed to"
589,CHAPTER II.,understand to whom the stately mistress addressed her brief
590,CHAPTER II.,"interrogatory. ""Have you all lost your tongues?"" at length exclaimed Mrs."
591,CHAPTER II.,"Pimble, in a louder tone; and, seizing her husband's chair, she gave it a"
592,CHAPTER II.,"rough jerk, and demanded, ""Are you dumb, Peter Pimble? What is that"
593,CHAPTER II.,"beggar-woman,""--pointing toward Dilly,--""doing here?"""
594,CHAPTER II.,
595,CHAPTER II.,"""Don't you see she is washing?"" returned the husband, rather ironically."
596,CHAPTER II.,
597,CHAPTER II.,"""Well, by whose leave?"""
598,CHAPTER II.,
599,CHAPTER II.,"""Mine."""
600,CHAPTER II.,
601,CHAPTER II.,"""Yours?--and why have you brought a washerwoman into the house in my"
602,CHAPTER II.,"absence, and without my permission?"""
603,CHAPTER II.,
604,CHAPTER II.,"""Because all my linen was dirty."""
605,CHAPTER II.,
606,CHAPTER II.,"""What if it was?"""
607,CHAPTER II.,
608,CHAPTER II.,"""I wanted it washed."""
609,CHAPTER II.,

611,CHAPTER II.,
612,CHAPTER II.,"""Because the spring courts are held in Olneyville next week."""

614,CHAPTER II.,"""What if they are?"""
615,CHAPTER II.,
616,CHAPTER II.,"""I would like to attend."""
617,CHAPTER II.,
618,CHAPTER II.,"""You would, would you? No doubt, and confine me at home to superintend"
619,CHAPTER II.,"the domestic affairs. No, Mr. Pimble, you don't enslave me in that"
620,CHAPTER II.,"manner. I'm a free woman, and acknowledge no man master. I'll see if I'm"
621,CHAPTER II.,"not mistress in my own house. Here, Dilly Danforth, take your hands out"
622,CHAPTER II.,"of that wash-tub, and pack off home, instanter. There will be no more"
623,CHAPTER II.,"washing done in my house to-day, or ever again, unless I order it done."
624,CHAPTER II.,"And you, Peggy Nonce, make a pea soup and broil a nice steak, with all"
625,CHAPTER II.,"the appropriate dishes, and have a dinner prepared in half an hour, to"
626,CHAPTER II.,"serve myself and guests."""
627,CHAPTER II.,
628,CHAPTER II.,"There was an instant commotion in the kitchen, and the mistress swept"
629,CHAPTER II.,back to her guests in the parlor.

671,OLD PLAY.,"vain with his elevation, that he looked very loftily down upon her, bowed"
672,OLD PLAY.,"in the most distant manner, and never exchanged more words with her than"
673,OLD PLAY.,were necessary in the buying and selling of an article. So Mary Madeline
674,OLD PLAY.,"told her mother, and upbraided her as the cause of the young man's cold"
675,OLD PLAY.,"treatment. Mrs. Salsify bade her daughter be of good cheer. ""'Twas all a"
676,OLD PLAY.,"feint on Dick's part, to conceal his love till he was sure of hers,--all"
677,OLD PLAY.,"would come round right in time."" But Mary Madeline would not believe it,"
678,OLD PLAY.,and said she should die if she had to stay in the back store alone so
679,OLD PLAY.,"much, sorting spices and writing labels, for she was constantly thinking"
680,OLD PLAY.,"of Dick, who used to be with her. She must have something to divert her"
681,OLD PLAY.,"attention; and, at length, Mrs. Salsify hit upon the project of sending"
682,OLD PLAY.,her to school at the seminary one term. It was fitting that the daughter
683,OLD PLAY.,"of the rich Mr. Mumbles that was to be, should be possessed of suitable"
684,OLD PLAY.,polish and refinement to adorn the high circles in which her position
685,OLD PLAY.,would call her to move. So Miss Mumbles answered to her name among the
686,OLD PLAY.,"two hundred scholars, male and female, that had assembled in the halls of"
687,OLD PLAY.,"Cedar Hill Seminary, for the summer term. Quite a sensation she produced"
688,OLD PLAY.,in her gay muslin dress and fiery-colored silk apron; for Mrs. Salsify
689,OLD PLAY.,declared her resolve to dress her tip-top. She was not the woman to half
690,OLD PLAY.,"do a thing, when she undertook; she always came up to the mark, or went a"
691,OLD PLAY.,"little beyond. Better overshoot than fall short, was her motto. And when"
692,OLD PLAY.,"Mary Madeline came home, on the evening of her debut at the seminary,"
693,OLD PLAY.,"walking between the two young lady boarders, Amy Seaton and Jenny"
694,OLD PLAY.,"Andrews, Mrs. Mumbles could not avoid drawing a comparison between the"
695,OLD PLAY.,three; and her daughter appeared to her like a blazing star between two
696,OLD PLAY.,"sombre clouds, for Miss Seaton and Miss Andrews, who were both orphans,"
697,OLD PLAY.,"wore plain, dark gingham frocks and linen aprons. The third boarder was a"
698,OLD PLAY.,"little brother of Miss Seaton's, about a dozen years of age. Charlie was"
699,OLD PLAY.,"his name; a bright, intelligent boy, brimful of mischief and fun."
700,OLD PLAY.,
701,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Salsify kept no girl;--she could not find a good one, she said,--a"
702,OLD PLAY.,"bad one she would not have, as long as she could manage to perform her"
703,OLD PLAY.,"work herself, which she thought she could do with Mary Madeline's"
704,OLD PLAY.,"assistance nights and mornings. It would not be for long, she trusted,"
705,OLD PLAY.,"this slavery to boarders, for Mr. Salsify continued to inform her, at"
706,OLD PLAY.,"stated intervals, that he was certainly ""rising in his profession."""
707,OLD PLAY.,
708,OLD PLAY.,"The husband and wife sat alone one evening, indulging in confidential"
709,OLD PLAY.,"discourse, as 'tis said conjugal mates are wont to do on certain"
710,OLD PLAY.,occasions.
711,OLD PLAY.,
712,OLD PLAY.,"""Really,"" exclaimed Mrs. Mumbles, ""it is astonishing, the quantity of"
713,OLD PLAY.,victuals these boarders consume. It is so unfeminine and indelicate for
714,OLD PLAY.,young ladies to have appetites. I declare it quite shocks me to see the
715,OLD PLAY.,large slices of bread and butter disappearing down Jenny Andrews' little
716,OLD PLAY.,"throat, and, as for that Charles Seaton, I believe he would eat a whole"
717,OLD PLAY.,"plum pudding if he could get it. I left off making them long ago."""
718,OLD PLAY.,
719,OLD PLAY.,"""I have not noticed one on the table for several days,"" returned Mr."
720,OLD PLAY.,"Salsify, ""and, as I saw the last one was sent away untouched, I feared"
721,OLD PLAY.,"they had detected the musty raisins."""
722,OLD PLAY.,
723,OLD PLAY.,"""O, la, no! the greedy mugs don't know the difference, I assure you,"""
724,OLD PLAY.,"answered the wife, ""'twas only because they had stuffed themselves so"
725,OLD PLAY.,"full of veal pie, that the pudding was not devoured."" Just then Amy"
726,OLD PLAY.,"Seaton came in and asked if she might get a lunch for Charlie, as he was"
727,OLD PLAY.,not in season for supper.
728,OLD PLAY.,
729,OLD PLAY.,"""O, yes!"" answered Mrs. Salsify, in her blandest tone; ""here are the"
730,OLD PLAY.,keys. I lock the pantry because Mr. Mumbles is so absent-minded he often
731,OLD PLAY.,"leaves the door open, and the cat gets in and devours the victuals. Get"
732,OLD PLAY.,just what you want for Charlie and a lunch for yourself and Jenny if you
733,OLD PLAY.,"choose."""
734,OLD PLAY.,
735,OLD PLAY.,"""Thank you,"" said Amy taking the bunch of keys from Mrs. Salsify's hand."
736,OLD PLAY.,"Wide swung the pantry door on its creaking hinges, and Amy's eyes"
737,OLD PLAY.,"brightened as she stepped in, thinking of the little feast they were to"
738,OLD PLAY.,have up stairs on the good lady's sudden fit of generosity. She glanced
739,OLD PLAY.,"her light eagerly along the shelves in search of pies and sweet cakes,"
740,OLD PLAY.,for she had seen Mrs. Salsify baking a large amount of good things that
741,OLD PLAY.,morning; but nothing met her wistful gaze save a plateful of burnt
742,OLD PLAY.,gingerbread crusts which had been picked over and left after the
743,OLD PLAY.,"evening's meal, a plate of refuse meat, and a few bits of salt cod-fish"
744,OLD PLAY.,in a broken saucer. She was about to go and tell Mrs. Mumbles her pantry
745,OLD PLAY.,"was destitute of victuals, when she recollected that lady superintended"
746,OLD PLAY.,"her own work, and she should only inform her of what she already knew."
747,OLD PLAY.,Several similar instances of the lady's singular generosity now occurred
748,OLD PLAY.,"to her mind. She recollected one day, on coming in unexpectedly from"
749,OLD PLAY.,"school, of finding Mrs. Salsify buying a large quantity of cherries, and"
750,OLD PLAY.,"of her saying she was going to pick them over, and would set them on the"
751,OLD PLAY.,dairy shelf where she might go and eat of them whenever she chose. But
752,OLD PLAY.,"Amy could not find them anywhere, and when she innocently asked Mrs."
753,OLD PLAY.,"Salsify where she had put them, that good lady, after blushing and"
754,OLD PLAY.,"stammering a good deal, said they proved so dirty she was obliged to"
755,OLD PLAY.,throw them away. This and other similar occurrences decided Amy to say
756,OLD PLAY.,nothing of the destitution of the pantry. So she returned the keys to her
757,OLD PLAY.,"boarding mistress, and, without a word, ascended to her room, where she"
758,OLD PLAY.,gave Charlie the bit of fish and crust of gingerbread she had obtained.
759,OLD PLAY.,
760,OLD PLAY.,"""Is this all I'm to have for my supper?"" said he, looking ruefully on the"
761,OLD PLAY.,"scanty, unpalatable food."
762,OLD PLAY.,
763,OLD PLAY.,"""'Tis all I can find in the pantry, bub,"" answered Amy; ""can't you make"
764,OLD PLAY.,it answer for to-night? and to-morrow I will buy you something nice at
765,OLD PLAY.,"the bakery."""
766,OLD PLAY.,
767,OLD PLAY.,"""Why,"" said Jenny, raising her dark, fun-loving eyes from a problem in"
768,OLD PLAY.,"Euclid, ""I saw Mrs. Mumbles baking mince pies, and custards and plum"
769,OLD PLAY.,"cake, this morning."""
770,OLD PLAY.,
771,OLD PLAY.,"""Bah,"" said Charlie, ""I don't want any of her plum cake if she puts the"
772,OLD PLAY.,"same kind of raisins in it she does in her puddings. But, Jenny, I think"
773,OLD PLAY.,"I know where she keeps her nice victuals."""
774,OLD PLAY.,
775,OLD PLAY.,"""Where?"" asked Jenny, with an earnest look on Charlie's cunning face."
776,OLD PLAY.,
777,OLD PLAY.,"""Have you never noticed that great tin boiler under her bed?"" Jenny burst"
778,OLD PLAY.,"into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, which Amy vainly endeavored to"
779,OLD PLAY.,"silence, and directly Mary Madeline appeared and said, ""Mother would like"
780,OLD PLAY.,"to have a little less noise if they could favor her, as she had company"
781,OLD PLAY.,"below."" Then the three sat down on the floor, and Jenny and Charlie"
782,OLD PLAY.,"planned a midnight attack upon the tin boiler. Amy, who was more sedate"
783,OLD PLAY.,"and cautious, advised them to desist; but 'twas just the exploit for"
784,OLD PLAY.,"Jenny's frolicsome, mischievous temperament. Charlie was to take a"
785,OLD PLAY.,"pillow-case, and creep softly under the bed, and fill it from the"
786,OLD PLAY.,"supposed contents of the mysterious boiler, while Jenny stood at the"
787,OLD PLAY.,kitchen door to assist him in bearing the precious burden to their room.
788,OLD PLAY.,How slow the hours passed after the plot was formed ere it could be
789,OLD PLAY.,carried into execution! Mrs. Salsify in the parlor below kept wishing her
790,OLD PLAY.,"visitors would go, for she had never seen the wicks in the camphene lamps"
791,OLD PLAY.,"of so surprising a length. They flooded the whole room with light, and"
792,OLD PLAY.,she recollected Jenny Andrews had asked the privilege of trimming them
793,OLD PLAY.,"after they were last used. She dared not rise and pick them down, for"
794,OLD PLAY.,such narrow-souled persons as she are always fearful that the truth will
795,OLD PLAY.,"be known and their littleness exposed; so she sat in a perfect fever,"
796,OLD PLAY.,"watching the fluid getting every moment lower, and scarcely heeding the"
797,OLD PLAY.,"remarks of her guests. At length they took their departure, and Mrs."
798,OLD PLAY.,"Salsify rushed in a sort of frenzy to the lamps, and dropped the caps"
799,OLD PLAY.,over the blazing wicks.
800,OLD PLAY.,
801,OLD PLAY.,"""Mary Madeline,"" said Mr. Mumbles, reprovingly, ""don't you know how to"
802,OLD PLAY.,trim a lamp properly? Enough fluid has been wasted to-night by means of
803,OLD PLAY.,"those long wicks to last two evenings with wicks of a proper length."""
804,OLD PLAY.,
805,OLD PLAY.,"""'Tis none of Maddie's doings,"" returned Mrs. S., ""she is more prudent"
806,OLD PLAY.,than that. 'Twas that hussy of a Jenny Andrews who trimmed them after
807,OLD PLAY.,"Miss Pinkerton was here the other night."""
808,OLD PLAY.,
809,OLD PLAY.,"""Well, the girl ought to pay for the waste she has occasioned,"" said Mr."
810,OLD PLAY.,"Salsify, gruffly. ""Let us retire now; I declare 'tis near eleven"
811,OLD PLAY.,"o'clock."" The conspirators in the room above heard with eager ears the"
812,OLD PLAY.,"departure of the guests, and sat in perfect silence till midnight chimed"
813,OLD PLAY.,"from the old clock tower. Then Charlie Seaton, pillow-case in hand, crept"
814,OLD PLAY.,silently down the stairs with Jenny close behind him. Mrs. Mumbles'
815,OLD PLAY.,"bed-room opened out of the kitchen, and the door was always standing"
816,OLD PLAY.,ajar. Thus Charlie's quick eye had detected the boiler while sitting at
817,OLD PLAY.,the dining table directly opposite her room. As he now paused a moment in
818,OLD PLAY.,"the kitchen before crossing the forbidden precincts, the deep-drawn"
819,OLD PLAY.,sonorous breathings convinced him that Mr. and Mrs. Salsify Mumbles were
820,OLD PLAY.,"lulled in their deepest nocturnal slumbers. Gently dropping on his knees,"
821,OLD PLAY.,he crawled softly to the object of plunder. Lucky chance! the cover was
822,OLD PLAY.,"off, and the first thing his hand touched was a knife plunged to the hilt"
823,OLD PLAY.,in a large loaf. This he captured and deposited in his bag. Then followed
824,OLD PLAY.,"pies, tarts, etc., and last a small jar, which he took under his arm,"
825,OLD PLAY.,"and, thus encumbered, crept on all-fours to the kitchen door, where Jenny"
826,OLD PLAY.,"relieved him of the jar. They softly ascended the stairs, where Amy was"
827,OLD PLAY.,ready to receive them.
828,OLD PLAY.,
829,OLD PLAY.,"""How dared you take that jar?"" said she; ""what does it contain?"""
830,OLD PLAY.,
831,OLD PLAY.,"""I don't know,"" said Charlie; ""but I know what my pillow-case contains."
832,OLD PLAY.,"It was never so well lined before, Amy."""
833,OLD PLAY.,
834,OLD PLAY.,"Thus saying, he commenced removing its contents, while Jenny pulled the"
835,OLD PLAY.,"knife out of the loaf, which proved to be pound cake, uncovered the jar,"
836,OLD PLAY.,"and pronounced it filled with cherry jam. ""Ay,"" said Amy, ""there's where"
837,OLD PLAY.,"those cherries I saw her buying of Dilly Danforth went, then. She told me"
838,OLD PLAY.,they were so dirty she had to throw them away. But I think you had better
839,OLD PLAY.,"go and carry these things back."""
840,OLD PLAY.,
841,OLD PLAY.,"""Never,"" said Charlie; ""I am going to eat my fill once in Mrs. Mumbles'"
842,OLD PLAY.,"house."""
843,OLD PLAY.,
844,OLD PLAY.,"""But what will she say when she discovers her loss?"""
845,OLD PLAY.,
846,OLD PLAY.,"""That is just what I'm anxious to know,"" said Jenny."
847,OLD PLAY.,
848,OLD PLAY.,"""So am I,"" returned Charlie, chopping off a large slice of pound cake and"
849,OLD PLAY.,"dividing two pies in halves. ""The old lady goes in for treating her"
850,OLD PLAY.,"visitors well, don't she? I dare say these condiments were intended to"
851,OLD PLAY.,supply her guests for years. I wish we had some spoons to eat this cherry
852,OLD PLAY.,"jam."""
853,OLD PLAY.,
854,OLD PLAY.,"""You had better carry that back,"" said Amy."
855,OLD PLAY.,
856,OLD PLAY.,"""No, I will not go down on my knees and crawl under Mrs. Salsify's bed"
857,OLD PLAY.,"again to-night on any consideration."""
858,OLD PLAY.,
859,OLD PLAY.,"""Neither would I,"" said Jenny, ""the old adage is 'as well be killed for a"
860,OLD PLAY.,sheep as a lamb;' so let us enjoy ourselves to the utmost in our power.
861,OLD PLAY.,"Here is food enough, of the best kind too, to serve us well for the"
862,OLD PLAY.,"remainder of our stay here, only a week longer you know. I'll keep it"
863,OLD PLAY.,"locked in my trunk."""
864,OLD PLAY.,
865,OLD PLAY.,"So saying, they cleared away, and Charlie bade good-night, and all"
866,OLD PLAY.,retired to bright visions of pound cake and cherry jelly.

871,CHAPTER IV.,CHAPTER IV.
872,CHAPTER IV.,
873,CHAPTER IV.,"""She was a lovely little ladye,"
874,CHAPTER IV.,With blue eyes beaming sunnily;
875,CHAPTER IV.,And loved to carry charity
876,CHAPTER IV.,"To the abodes of misery."""
877,CHAPTER IV.,
878,CHAPTER IV.,
879,CHAPTER IV.,There was a tiny bark floating down the flower-bordered river that wound
880,CHAPTER IV.,"so gracefully through the beautiful village of Wimbledon, and a smiling"
881,CHAPTER IV.,"little lady, in a neat gingham sun-bonnet, sat coseyly in the stern,"
882,CHAPTER IV.,beneath the shady wing of the snow-white sail. A noble-looking lad plied
883,CHAPTER IV.,"the oar with graceful ease, chatting merrily the while with the little"
884,CHAPTER IV.,"girl, and laughing at her constant and matronly care of a large basket"
885,CHAPTER IV.,"which was placed beside her, neatly covered with a snowy napkin. ""One"
886,CHAPTER IV.,"would think that there were diamonds in that basket, Nell, you guard it"
887,CHAPTER IV.,"so carefully,"" said he."
888,CHAPTER IV.,
889,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, only nice pies mother gave me leave to take to Aunt Dilly Danforth,"
890,CHAPTER IV.,"the poor washerwoman,"" returned the little miss, again smoothing the"
891,CHAPTER IV.,"napkin and adjusting the basket in a new position. ""I wish you would row"
892,CHAPTER IV.,"as carefully as you can, Neddie, so as not to jostle them much."""
893,CHAPTER IV.,
894,CHAPTER IV.,"""So I will, sis,"" returned he; ""let's sing the Boatman's Song as we glide"
895,CHAPTER IV.,"along."" And their voices rose on the calm summer air clear and sweet as"
896,CHAPTER IV.,the morning song of birds. Now and then their light barge touched the
897,CHAPTER IV.,"shore, and Ned plucked flowers to twine in Ellen's hair. O, that ever,"
898,CHAPTER IV.,"down life's uncertain tide, these innocent young spirits might float as"
899,CHAPTER IV.,"calmly, happily on to the broad ocean of eternity!"
900,CHAPTER IV.,
901,CHAPTER IV.,"""Is that the old shanty where Dilly lives?"" said the lad at length,"
902,CHAPTER IV.,"pointing to a low black house, just beyond a clump of brushwood, which"
903,CHAPTER IV.,they were swiftly approaching.
904,CHAPTER IV.,
905,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes,"" said Ellen, gathering up her basket."
906,CHAPTER IV.,
907,CHAPTER IV.,"""Here I must lose you, then,"" said Ned; ""how I wish you would go fishing"
908,CHAPTER IV.,"with me down to the cove!"""
909,CHAPTER IV.,
910,CHAPTER IV.,"Ellen smiled. ""Are you going to be all alone, Neddie?"" asked she."
911,CHAPTER IV.,
912,CHAPTER IV.,"""Nobody but Charlie Seaton will be with me. You like him."""
913,CHAPTER IV.,
914,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, I like him well enough,"" said Ellen, innocently; ""but I would not"
915,CHAPTER IV.,"care to go a-fishing with him."""
916,CHAPTER IV.,
917,CHAPTER IV.,"""Why not, sis?"" inquired Ned."
918,CHAPTER IV.,
919,CHAPTER IV.,"""Because it would not be pretty for a little girl to go fishing with"
920,CHAPTER IV.,"boys."""
921,CHAPTER IV.,
922,CHAPTER IV.,"""Ha, ha!"" laughed the lad; ""what a prudent little sis I have got! for all"
923,CHAPTER IV.,"the world like Amy Seaton. But I like Jenny Andrews better, she is so"
924,CHAPTER IV.,full of fun and frolic. Did you know how she and Charlie Seaton robbed
925,CHAPTER IV.,"old Mrs. Salsify Mumbles, one night not long since?"""
926,CHAPTER IV.,
927,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, no! robbed her? That was wrong, surely."""
928,CHAPTER IV.,
929,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, no! You see she nearly starved them, so they helped themselves to her"
930,CHAPTER IV.,"sweetmeats without invitation. That's all; not very wicked, I'm thinking,"
931,CHAPTER IV.,"Nell."""
932,CHAPTER IV.,
933,CHAPTER IV.,"""I think it was wicked for her not to give them enough food, and wicked"
934,CHAPTER IV.,"for them to take it without her knowledge,"" said Ellen, after a pause."
935,CHAPTER IV.,"""But what did she say when she discovered her loss?"""
936,CHAPTER IV.,
937,CHAPTER IV.,"""Not a word. What could she say?"" asked Ned."
938,CHAPTER IV.,
939,CHAPTER IV.,"""I could not guess, and therefore inquired,"" said Ellen. ""Will Jenny come"
940,CHAPTER IV.,"to school next term?"""
941,CHAPTER IV.,
942,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, Jenny, Amy and Charlie, and board at Dea. Allen's. That will be a"
943,CHAPTER IV.,good place; only I fancy the deacon's long prayers and sober phiz will
944,CHAPTER IV.,"prove a sad trial to Jenny. Well, you must go, sis,"" said he, pushing his"
945,CHAPTER IV.,"boat high up on the green, grassy bank, by a few skilful strokes of his"
946,CHAPTER IV.,oar. Then assisting her out and placing the precious basket safely in her
947,CHAPTER IV.,"arms, he was soon gliding down the smooth current again. Ellen directed"
948,CHAPTER IV.,"her steps toward the dilapidated dwelling a few yards before her, turning"
949,CHAPTER IV.,frequently to catch a glimpse of her brother's little bark as it came in
950,CHAPTER IV.,view through some opening in the shrubbery that grew on the river's side.
951,CHAPTER IV.,
952,CHAPTER IV.,One timid rap brought Willie Danforth to the door. The poor boy looked
953,CHAPTER IV.,"quite embarrassed to behold pretty, neat Ellen Williams standing there on"
954,CHAPTER IV.,"the miserable, dirty threshold. ""Good day, Willie,"" said she, pleasantly;"
955,CHAPTER IV.,"""is your mother at home?"""
956,CHAPTER IV.,
957,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, miss, she is scrubbing floors at Mr. Pimble's,"" said Willie,"
958,CHAPTER IV.,awkwardly enough.
959,CHAPTER IV.,
960,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, I am sorry she is gone, for I wanted to see her very much. Will you"
961,CHAPTER IV.,"let me come in and leave this basket for her?"""
962,CHAPTER IV.,
963,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, yes!"" answered the poor lad, ""or I will carry it in for you."""
964,CHAPTER IV.,
965,CHAPTER IV.,"""I can carry it very well,"" said Ellen, ""if you will only let me go in."""
966,CHAPTER IV.,
967,CHAPTER IV.,"""I would let you come in, Miss Ellen,"" returned Willie, ""only I am afraid"
968,CHAPTER IV.,"it would frighten you to see such a sad, dirty place;"" and the ragged"
969,CHAPTER IV.,"little fellow blushed crimson, as he thus revealed his poverty and"
970,CHAPTER IV.,destitution.
971,CHAPTER IV.,
972,CHAPTER IV.,"Ellen pitied his embarrassment, and said, ""I should like to go in,"
973,CHAPTER IV.,"Willie, because, if I saw what you needed, I could tell mother, and she"
974,CHAPTER IV.,"would make you more comfortable, I know."""
975,CHAPTER IV.,
976,CHAPTER IV.,The boy lifted the wooden latch of the inner room. The door opened with a
977,CHAPTER IV.,"dismal creak, and Ellen entered. There was one old, broken-backed chair,"
978,CHAPTER IV.,"which he offered her, and sat down himself on a rough bench, with a"
979,CHAPTER IV.,"sorrowful, embarrassed expression on his pale, interesting features."
980,CHAPTER IV.,"Ellen, still noticing Willie's painful confusion, knew not what to do"
981,CHAPTER IV.,"after placing her basket on the rude, wooden table, and began to regret"
982,CHAPTER IV.,that she so strongly pressed an entrance.
983,CHAPTER IV.,
984,CHAPTER IV.,"""I told you you would be frightened,"" said the boy at length, in a"
985,CHAPTER IV.,choking tone.
986,CHAPTER IV.,
987,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, I am not frightened!"" returned Ellen, glad to speak now that he had"
988,CHAPTER IV.,"opened the way for her; ""I am only sorry to find people living so"
989,CHAPTER IV.,"forlornly in our pretty, happy village. I thought you had a good nice"
990,CHAPTER IV.,"house to live in, for Mrs. Pimble said so, and that her husband rented it"
991,CHAPTER IV.,"to you for almost nothing, and that your mother--but I won't say any"
992,CHAPTER IV.,"more,"" said Ellen, stopping short in her discourse."
993,CHAPTER IV.,
994,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes,"" said Willie, ""tell me all she said, and then I will tell you"
995,CHAPTER IV.,"something."""
996,CHAPTER IV.,
997,CHAPTER IV.,"""Well, then, she said your mother only went out washing to make folks"
998,CHAPTER IV.,"think she was needy, so they would give her food and clothing. 'Twas"
999,CHAPTER IV.,"wicked for her to say it, surely."""
1000,CHAPTER IV.,
1001,CHAPTER IV.,"Willie's face grew pale as death, and then flushed crimson to the"
1002,CHAPTER IV.,temples.
1003,CHAPTER IV.,
1004,CHAPTER IV.,"""Don't look so,"" said Ellen, approaching the bench and putting her little"
1005,CHAPTER IV.,"hand on his hot cheeks. ""O, Willie! you are sick and tired,"" she"
1006,CHAPTER IV.,"continued, soothingly; ""will you not lay your head down on my lap, and"
1007,CHAPTER IV.,"tell me all about your troubles?"""
1008,CHAPTER IV.,
1009,CHAPTER IV.,"Willie's full heart overflowed. Those accents of kindness, so strange to"
1010,CHAPTER IV.,"his ears, what a magic power they had! He leaned his dear bright head on"
1011,CHAPTER IV.,"her soft little palm, and his low voice told in broken accents a tale of"
1012,CHAPTER IV.,"want and suffering. Ellen wept, for her young heart was full of"
1013,CHAPTER IV.,"tenderness and sympathy. The hours sped on, while they thus held"
1014,CHAPTER IV.,"converse, till a hand on the latch aroused them. 'Twas Dilly returned"
1015,CHAPTER IV.,"from her day's work at Mr. Pimble's. Willie sprang up to meet her. ""O,"
1016,CHAPTER IV.,"mother!"" said he, ""a sweet angel has come since you left me, this"
1017,CHAPTER IV.,"morning, crying because I was so hungry."""
1018,CHAPTER IV.,
1019,CHAPTER IV.,"""Alas, my boy!"" said the woman, ""I fear you must still go hungry, for I"
1020,CHAPTER IV.,have brought you nothing. Mr. Pimble says my week's work must go for
1021,CHAPTER IV.,"rent."""
1022,CHAPTER IV.,
1023,CHAPTER IV.,"Now was Ellen's moment of joy, as she bounded across the broken floor and"
1024,CHAPTER IV.,"lifted the napkin from her basket. ""No, no, Willie,--no, no, Aunt Dilly,"
1025,CHAPTER IV.,you shall not go hungry to bed to-night. Look what mother has sent you!
1026,CHAPTER IV.,"How thoughtless of me not to have remembered my basket before, when"
1027,CHAPTER IV.,"Willie has been suffering from hunger all these long, long hours!"""
1028,CHAPTER IV.,
1029,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, no! I have not thought of being hungry since you came,"" said the boy."
1030,CHAPTER IV.,
1031,CHAPTER IV.,Mrs. Danforth approached the basket and gazed on its contents with
1032,CHAPTER IV.,"tearful eyes. She had not seen the like on her table for many a day, and,"
1033,CHAPTER IV.,"dropping on her knees, she breathed a silent prayer to God for his"
1034,CHAPTER IV.,goodness in putting it into the hearts of his children to remember her in
1035,CHAPTER IV.,her need! Willie brought forth a small bundle of sticks and lighted a
1036,CHAPTER IV.,"fire, while Ellen ran and filled a black, broken-nosed tea-kettle, and"
1037,CHAPTER IV.,"hung it on a hook over the blaze. It soon began to sing merrily, and the"
1038,CHAPTER IV.,children laughed and said it had caught some of their happiness. Then
1039,CHAPTER IV.,"Ellen took some tea from the paper her mother had wrapped so nicely, put"
1040,CHAPTER IV.,"it in a cracked blue bowl, and Willie fixed a bed of coals for her to set"
1041,CHAPTER IV.,it on. Dilly sat all the while gazing with tearful eyes on the two
1042,CHAPTER IV.,"beaming faces which were constantly turned up to hers, to see if she gave"
1043,CHAPTER IV.,"her approval to their movements. At length the repast was prepared, and,"
1044,CHAPTER IV.,"after partaking with them, as Mrs. Danforth insisted upon her doing,"
1045,CHAPTER IV.,"Ellen set out for home, with Willie by her side. He hesitated some at"
1046,CHAPTER IV.,"first, when his mother told him he must accompany her, for his jacket was"
1047,CHAPTER IV.,ragged and his shoes out at the toes. But when Ellen said so
1048,CHAPTER IV.,"reproachfully he was ""too bad, too bad, to make her go all the way home"
1049,CHAPTER IV.,"alone,"" he brightened, and said ""he would be very glad to go with her if"
1050,CHAPTER IV.,"she would not be ashamed of him."" So they set out together, each holding"
1051,CHAPTER IV.,"a handle of the basket; Ellen bidding Aunt Dilly a cordial good-by, and"
1052,CHAPTER IV.,promising to come soon again and bring her mother. They met Mr. Pimble on
1053,CHAPTER IV.,"their way, who scowled and passed by in silence."
1054,CHAPTER IV.,
1055,CHAPTER IV.,Ellen found her mother anxiously waiting her return. She heard with
1056,CHAPTER IV.,pleasure and interest her little daughter's animated description of her
1057,CHAPTER IV.,"visit; but when she said she had promised to visit Aunt Dilly soon again,"
1058,CHAPTER IV.,"and take her mother with her, Mrs. Williams looked sad."
1059,CHAPTER IV.,
1060,CHAPTER IV.,"""What makes you look so, dear mamma?"" said Ellen; ""will you not go and"
1061,CHAPTER IV.,"see poor Dilly?"""
1062,CHAPTER IV.,
1063,CHAPTER IV.,"""I shall be very glad to do so, my dear child,"" answered the fond mother,"
1064,CHAPTER IV.,"""if it is possible. You know your father has often wished to remove to a"
1065,CHAPTER IV.,place where his skill in architecture might be employed to better
1066,CHAPTER IV.,"advantage, and an excellent opportunity now offers for him to dispose of"
1067,CHAPTER IV.,"his situation here, and remove to a large city, where his services will"
1068,CHAPTER IV.,"be in constant demand."""
1069,CHAPTER IV.,
1070,CHAPTER IV.,"""And I shall never see Willie Danforth again,"" said Ellen, bursting into"
1071,CHAPTER IV.,tears.
1072,CHAPTER IV.,
1073,CHAPTER IV.,"Childhood is so simple and unaffected, ever expressing with innocent"
1074,CHAPTER IV.,"confidence its dearest thought, and claiming sympathy! Mrs. Williams"
1075,CHAPTER IV.,"tried long to comfort her little daughter, and at length succeeded by"
1076,CHAPTER IV.,holding out a prospect that she might some time return and visit her
1077,CHAPTER IV.,"early associates. Ned was consoled by the same prospect. But then, we"
1078,CHAPTER IV.,"never know, when we leave a place, what changes may occur ere we revisit"
1079,CHAPTER IV.,its now familiar scenes. Mrs. Williams felt this truth more vividly than
1080,CHAPTER IV.,"her children. But few changes had marked their sunny years, and it never"
1081,CHAPTER IV.,occurred to their youthful minds but what Wimbledon as she was to-night
1082,CHAPTER IV.,would be exactly the same should they return five or ten years hence. The
1083,CHAPTER IV.,"mother did not disturb this pleasant illusion, ""for experience comes"
1084,CHAPTER IV.,"quite soon enough to young hearts,"" she said, ""and I'll not force her"
1085,CHAPTER IV.,"unwelcome lessons upon my happy children."" So Ned and Ellen, when it was"
1086,CHAPTER IV.,"decided they should leave on the morrow, almost forgot the pangs of"
1087,CHAPTER IV.,"departure from their rich, beautiful home, so intently were they dwelling"
1088,CHAPTER IV.,on the joy of returning and meeting their schoolmates and companions
1089,CHAPTER IV.,"after a period of separation. O, gay, light-hearted youth! What is there"
1090,CHAPTER IV.,"in all life's after years, its gaudy pomp, its feverish flame, or"
1091,CHAPTER IV.,"short-lived honors, that can atone for the loss of thy buoyant hopes, and"
1092,CHAPTER IV.,"simple, trusting faith?"
1093,CHAPTER IV.,
1094,CHAPTER IV.,Sad was poor Dilly Danforth when she heard of the sudden departure of the
1095,CHAPTER IV.,"benevolent Williams family, and bitterly she exclaimed, ""No good thing is"
1096,CHAPTER IV.,long vouchsafed the poor. Our poverty will only seem the darker now for
1097,CHAPTER IV.,"having been brightened for a transient hour."""
1098,CHAPTER IV.,
1099,CHAPTER IV.,"Willie, who had returned from his walk with Ellen with severe pains in"
1100,CHAPTER IV.,"his limbs and head, fell sick of a rheumatic fever, and suffered much for"
1101,CHAPTER IV.,"the want of warm clothing, care and medical treatment. O, how often he"
1102,CHAPTER IV.,"thought of Ellen! ""If she were there he would not suffer thus. She would"
1103,CHAPTER IV.,"be warmth, care, clothing and physician for him."""
1104,CHAPTER IV.,
1105,CHAPTER IV.,His mother was obliged to labor every day to procure fuel for the fire;
1106,CHAPTER IV.,"and to warm the great, cold room, where the piercing autumn blasts blew"
1107,CHAPTER IV.,"through wide gaping cracks and chasms, and get a bottle of wormwood"
1108,CHAPTER IV.,"occasionally, with which to bathe his aching limbs, was the utmost her"
1109,CHAPTER IV.,"efforts could accomplish. With this insufficient care, 'twas no wonder"
1110,CHAPTER IV.,Willie grew rapidly worse. One bitter cold night Dilly sat down utterly
1111,CHAPTER IV.,discouraged as she placed the last stick of wood on the fire. Her boy had
1112,CHAPTER IV.,been so ill for several days she could not leave him to go to her
1113,CHAPTER IV.,"accustomed labor, and consequently the small pile of fuel was consumed."
1114,CHAPTER IV.,"What was she to do? Willie was already crying of cold, and she sat over"
1115,CHAPTER IV.,the expiring blaze crying because she had naught to render him
1116,CHAPTER IV.,"comfortable. After a while he grew silent, and, softly approaching, she"
1117,CHAPTER IV.,found he had sunk into a quiet slumber. Carefully covering him with the
1118,CHAPTER IV.,"thin, tattered blankets, she pinned a shawl over her head, and, softly"
1119,CHAPTER IV.,"closing the door behind her, stole forth into the biting night air, and"
1120,CHAPTER IV.,directed a hasty tread toward Mr. Pimble's great brick mansion. A bright
1121,CHAPTER IV.,light gleamed through the kitchen windows as she ascended the steps and
1122,CHAPTER IV.,"gave a hurried knock. Directly she heard a shuffling sound, and knew Mr."
1123,CHAPTER IV.,"Pimble, in his heelless slippers, was approaching. Fast beat her heart as"
1124,CHAPTER IV.,"the door opened, and she beheld his gaunt form and unyielding features."
1125,CHAPTER IV.,
1126,CHAPTER IV.,"""What brings you here this bitter cold night, Dilly Danforth?"" exclaimed"
1127,CHAPTER IV.,"he, in a surly tone, as the furious blast rushed in his face, and nearly"
1128,CHAPTER IV.,extinguished the lamp he held in his skinny grasp.
1129,CHAPTER IV.,
1130,CHAPTER IV.,"She stepped inside, and he closed the door."
1131,CHAPTER IV.,
1132,CHAPTER IV.,"""'Tis the bitter cold night which brings me, Mr. Pimble,"" she said,"
1133,CHAPTER IV.,"feeling she must speak quickly, for Willie was at home alone; ""my boy is"
1134,CHAPTER IV.,"sick and suffering from cold. For myself, I would not ask a favor, but"
1135,CHAPTER IV.,for him I entreat you to give me an armful of wood to keep him from
1136,CHAPTER IV.,"perishing."""
1137,CHAPTER IV.,
1138,CHAPTER IV.,"""Why don't you work and buy your wood?"" asked he, angered by this sudden"
1139,CHAPTER IV.,demand upon his charity.
1140,CHAPTER IV.,
1141,CHAPTER IV.,"""I worked as long as I could leave my child,"" answered Mrs. Danforth,"
1142,CHAPTER IV.,"""and I thought maybe you would be willing to allow me something for my"
1143,CHAPTER IV.,"work here."""
1144,CHAPTER IV.,
1145,CHAPTER IV.,"""Allow you something, woman? Don't I give you the rent of that great"
1146,CHAPTER IV.,"house for the few light chores you do for us, which really amount to"
1147,CHAPTER IV.,"nothing? Your impudence is astonishing;"" and Esq. Pimble's voice quivered"
1148,CHAPTER IV.,"with rage, as he thus addressed the trembling woman."
1149,CHAPTER IV.,
1150,CHAPTER IV.,"Dilly stood irresolute, and Mr. Pimble was silent a few moments, when a"
1151,CHAPTER IV.,"voice from the parlor called out, imperiously, ""Pimble, I want you!"""
1152,CHAPTER IV.,
1153,CHAPTER IV.,The man roused himself and rushed to the door in such haste as to lose
1154,CHAPTER IV.,both his slippers.
1155,CHAPTER IV.,
1156,CHAPTER IV.,"""What are you blabbing about out there?"" Dilly heard Mrs. Pimble ask, in"
1157,CHAPTER IV.,an angry tone.
1158,CHAPTER IV.,
1159,CHAPTER IV.,"""Dilly Danforth has come for some wood,"" was the moody reply."
1160,CHAPTER IV.,
1161,CHAPTER IV.,"""And so you are giving wood to that lazy, foolish, stupid creature, are"
1162,CHAPTER IV.,"you?"""
1163,CHAPTER IV.,
1164,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, I am not. She says her boy is sick and she has no fire."""
1165,CHAPTER IV.,
1166,CHAPTER IV.,"""A pretty tale, and I hope 'tis true. She'll learn by and by her sin and"
1167,CHAPTER IV.,"folly. If she had asserted her own rights, as she should have done, and"
1168,CHAPTER IV.,"left her drunken husband and moping boy years ago, she might have been"
1169,CHAPTER IV.,well off in the world by this time. But she chose like an idiot to live
1170,CHAPTER IV.,"with him and endure his abuses till he died, and since she has tied"
1171,CHAPTER IV.,"herself to that foolish boy. O, I have no patience with such stupid"
1172,CHAPTER IV.,women! They are a disgrace to the true female race. Go and tell her to go
1173,CHAPTER IV.,"home and never enter my doors a-begging again."""
1174,CHAPTER IV.,
1175,CHAPTER IV.,"Dilly did not wait to receive this unfeeling message, but pulled her thin"
1176,CHAPTER IV.,"blanket around her, and stole out in the chill night air, and ran toward"
1177,CHAPTER IV.,home as swiftly as possible. She stumbled over something on the
1178,CHAPTER IV.,threshold. It was a bundle of firewood. How came it there? She could not
1179,CHAPTER IV.,"tell, but seized it in her arms, ran hastily in, and approached Willie's"
1180,CHAPTER IV.,"bed-side. He was still sleeping tranquilly, and that night a comfortable"
1181,CHAPTER IV.,"fire, lighted by unknown generosity, blazed on the lowly hearth."

1194,OLD PLAY.,
1195,OLD PLAY.,All Wimbledon was aroused one cold November morning by a direful
1196,OLD PLAY.,"conglomeration of sounds;--strange, discordant shrieks, ominous groans,"
1197,OLD PLAY.,"a clanking, as of iron chains and fetters, a slow, heavy, elephantine"
1198,OLD PLAY.,"tread gradually growing on the ear, and a deep, continuous rumbling as of"
1199,OLD PLAY.,"earthquakes in the bowels of the earth. Mrs. Salsify Mumbles, nervous and"
1200,OLD PLAY.,"delicate as she was, clung fast to the neck of her liege lord when he"
1201,OLD PLAY.,"attempted to throw open the sash of his window, to discover the import of"
1202,OLD PLAY.,this unusual disturbance of the nocturnal stillness of Wimbledon. Good
1203,OLD PLAY.,"Deacon Allen, who was lying on his deaf ear, became restless, and visions"
1204,OLD PLAY.,of the final retribution and doom of the wicked harassed his slumbers.
1205,OLD PLAY.,"Suddenly he awoke, and dismal groans and unearthly rumblings struck his"
1206,OLD PLAY.,"terrified ear. ""Sally! Sally!"" said he, leaping from bed and giving his"
1207,OLD PLAY.,"sleeping spouse a vigorous shake, ""why sleepest thou? arise and don thy"
1208,OLD PLAY.,"drab camlet and high-crowned cap, and prepare to meet thy Lord; for"
1209,OLD PLAY.,"behold he cometh!"""
1210,OLD PLAY.,
1211,OLD PLAY.,"""Samuel,"" said the good wife but half awake, ""you are prating in your"

1216,OLD PLAY.,"of the wicked?"""
1217,OLD PLAY.,
1218,OLD PLAY.,"""I do hear something,"" said Mrs. Allen, now poking her night-capped head"
1219,OLD PLAY.,"from beneath the blankets, and listening a moment attentively. ""'Tis a"
1220,OLD PLAY.,"sound of heavy carts drawn by oxen over frozen ground. Ay, I guess it is"
1221,OLD PLAY.,"the new family, that bought out neighbor Williams, moving their goods."
1222,OLD PLAY.,"Just look out the window,--our yards join,--and see if there is not a"
1223,OLD PLAY.,"stir there."" The deacon obeyed."
1224,OLD PLAY.,
1225,OLD PLAY.,"""O, yes,"" said he, ""I can distinguish several loaded teams and dusky"
1226,OLD PLAY.,"figures moving to and fro."""
1227,OLD PLAY.,
1228,OLD PLAY.,"""I thought 'twas the new-comers,"" returned the wife, who possessed more"

1233,OLD PLAY.,"""I cannot get to sleep again, I have been so disturbed,"" said the"

1235,OLD PLAY.,
1236,OLD PLAY.,"""O, pshaw!--put your deaf ear up and you'll soon fall off,"" answered the"
1237,OLD PLAY.,"wife, drawing the covering over her head. Deacon Allen, who had a very"
1238,OLD PLAY.,"high opinion of his wife's good sense, concluded to follow her advice,"
1239,OLD PLAY.,"and the happy couple were soon enjoying as pleasant a morning snooze, as"
1240,OLD PLAY.,"though neither the resurrection nor the ""new family"" had disturbed their"
1241,OLD PLAY.,slumbers.
1242,OLD PLAY.,
1243,OLD PLAY.,"Jenny Andrews and Amy Seaton, who slept in the room above, never heard a"
1244,OLD PLAY.,"sound, nor did Charlie in his cosey chamber beyond, and great was the"

1246,OLD PLAY.,the long line of heavy-loaded teams drawn up in the yard of the splendid
1247,OLD PLAY.,"mansion which stood next above Dea. Allen's, the former residence of Esq."
1248,OLD PLAY.,Williams. Teamsters in blue frocks were unfastening the smoking oxen from
1249,OLD PLAY.,"the ponderous carts, and as the girls hurried below to impart the"
1250,OLD PLAY.,"intelligence of the arrival of the new family to Mrs. Allen, they heard"
1251,OLD PLAY.,"the voice of Mrs. Salsify Mumbles, and entering the sitting-room found"
1252,OLD PLAY.,that lady laying aside her bonnet and shawl. Mary Madeline was standing
1253,OLD PLAY.,by the window gazing into the adjoining yard. Jenny and Amy had not seen
1254,OLD PLAY.,their former boarding mistress since they left her house at the close of
1255,OLD PLAY.,"the summer term, several months before. But she was so elate about the"
1256,OLD PLAY.,arrival of the new family that all memory of their former ill-usage
1257,OLD PLAY.,"seemed to have escaped her, and she grasped the hands of both and shook"
1258,OLD PLAY.,"them cordially. ""I am glad to see you,"" she exclaimed; ""why have you not"
1259,OLD PLAY.,called on us this fall? Mary Madeline has often said I wish Jenny and Amy
1260,OLD PLAY.,"would come in, it would seem so much like old times. Here, my dear,"" said"
1261,OLD PLAY.,"she, seizing hold of the young lady's shawl and pulling her from the"
1262,OLD PLAY.,"window, ""don't be so taken up with the new family that you can't speak to"
1263,OLD PLAY.,"your old friends."" Mary Madeline now turned and spoke to her former"
1264,OLD PLAY.,"schoolmates. Then, drawing a chair close to the window, she resumed her"
1265,OLD PLAY.,"gaze, with her gloves and handkerchief lying unheeded on the floor and"
1266,OLD PLAY.,"her gay shawl dragging behind her. ""O, mother! mother!"" she exclaimed at"
1267,OLD PLAY.,"length, ""there comes the family."""

1269,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Salsify, who was engaged in telling Mrs. Allen of Mr. Salsify's"

1271,OLD PLAY.,meditated adding another story to his house and putting a piazza round it
1272,OLD PLAY.,"next spring, dropped all, even her snuff-box, and rushed to the window as"
1273,OLD PLAY.,"a large covered wagon, drawn by a span of elegant black horses, drove"
1274,OLD PLAY.,rapidly into the adjoining yard. First alighted a tall man in a black
1275,OLD PLAY.,"overcoat,--the master no doubt, the gazers decided,--then a tall man in a"
1276,OLD PLAY.,"gray overcoat, then a tall man in a brown overcoat. And the man in the"
1277,OLD PLAY.,"black overcoat and the man in the gray overcoat moved away, the former up"
1278,OLD PLAY.,"the steps of the mansion and around the terraces, trying the fastenings"
1279,OLD PLAY.,"of the Venetian blinds, and examining the cornices and pillars of the"
1280,OLD PLAY.,porticos; the latter turned in the direction of the stables and
1281,OLD PLAY.,"outhouses, while the man in the brown overcoat assisted three ladies to"
1282,OLD PLAY.,"alight, all grown-up women, one short and fat, the other two tall and"
1283,OLD PLAY.,thin. The gazers were a little puzzled by the appearance of the new
1284,OLD PLAY.,family. As far as they could discover there was no great difference in
1285,OLD PLAY.,the respective ages of the six individuals who had alighted from the
1286,OLD PLAY.,"wagon, and Mrs. Salsify Mumbles declared it as her opinion that the"
1287,OLD PLAY.,family consisted of three brothers who had married three sisters for
1288,OLD PLAY.,"their wives. The short, fat woman, who had a rubicund visage and"
1289,OLD PLAY.,"turned-up nose, and wore a broad-plaided cashmere dress, drew forth a"
1290,OLD PLAY.,"bunch of keys from a wicker basket that hung on her arm, and with a"
1291,OLD PLAY.,"pompous tread ascended the marble steps, unlocked the broad,"
1292,OLD PLAY.,"mahogany-panelled door, turned the massive silver knob, and, swinging it"
1293,OLD PLAY.,"wide, strode in, the tall ladies in blue cloaks following close behind."
1294,OLD PLAY.,"Soon sashes began to be raised, blinds flew open, and the tall ladies"
1295,OLD PLAY.,were seen standing on high chairs hanging curtains of rich damask and
1296,OLD PLAY.,"exquisitely wrought muslin, before the deep bay windows. The three tall"
1297,OLD PLAY.,"men threw off their overcoats, and, with the assistance of the"
1298,OLD PLAY.,"blue-frocked teamsters, commenced the business of unlading the carts."
1299,OLD PLAY.,
1300,OLD PLAY.,"""All the furniture is bagged,"" said Mrs. Salsify, impatiently; ""one"
1301,OLD PLAY.,"cannot get a glimpse to know whether 'tis walnut, or rosewood, or"
1302,OLD PLAY.,"mahogany. They mean to make us think 'tis pretty nice, whether 'tis or"
1303,OLD PLAY.,"not; but we shall find out some time, for they can't always be so shy."
1304,OLD PLAY.,"Well, Mary Madeline,"" she added, turning to her daughter, ""we may as well"
1305,OLD PLAY.,"go home, I guess;--there's nothing to be seen here but chairs and sofas"
1306,OLD PLAY.,"sewed up in canvas. I thought I would run over a few minutes, Mrs. Allen,"
1307,OLD PLAY.,"as I knew your windows looked right into the yard of the new comers, and"
1308,OLD PLAY.,"we could get a good view. Of course, we wanted to know what sort of folks"
1309,OLD PLAY.,we were going to have for neighbors. I hope they'll be different from the

1311,OLD PLAY.,
1312,OLD PLAY.,"""Why?"" asked Mrs. Allen, looking up from the brown patch she was engaged"
1313,OLD PLAY.,"in sewing on the elbow of the deacon's black satinet coat. ""I only hope"
1314,OLD PLAY.,"they will prove as good neighbors and I will be perfectly satisfied."""
1315,OLD PLAY.,
1316,OLD PLAY.,"""O, I don't know but what the Williams' were good enough, but they were"

1318,OLD PLAY.,"Madeline fit for her Ellen to associate with."""
1319,OLD PLAY.,
1320,OLD PLAY.,"""How do you know she thought so?"" asked Mrs. Allen; ""for my part, I lived"
1321,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Williams' nearest neighbor for ten years or more, and always"
1322,OLD PLAY.,"considered her a very kind-hearted, unassuming woman, wholly untainted"
1323,OLD PLAY.,with the pride and haughtiness which too often disfigure the characters
1324,OLD PLAY.,of those who possess large store of this world's goods and move in the

1326,OLD PLAY.,
1327,OLD PLAY.,"""Well, you were more acquainted with Mrs. Williams than I was, of course;"
1328,OLD PLAY.,but she was not the kind of woman to suit my taste. There's Mrs. Pimble
1329,OLD PLAY.,"and Mrs. Lawson now, both rich and splendid, keep their carriages and"
1330,OLD PLAY.,"servants, but they are not above speaking to common people."""
1331,OLD PLAY.,
1332,OLD PLAY.,"""I am not personally acquainted with those ladies,"" answered Mrs. Allen."
1333,OLD PLAY.,
1334,OLD PLAY.,"""They are reformers,"" said Mrs. Mumbles, in a reverential tone; ""you"

1346,OLD PLAY.,
1347,OLD PLAY.,"""Doubtless you would join their ranks should they do so,"" observed Mrs."
1348,OLD PLAY.,"Allen, with a quiet smile, as she arose, gave the deacon's coat a shake,"
1349,OLD PLAY.,and hung it on a peg behind the door.
1350,OLD PLAY.,
1351,OLD PLAY.,"""Well, I don't know but I should,"" returned Mrs. S.; ""but come, Maddie,"
1352,OLD PLAY.,"how we are wasting time! I declare, two carts are already unloaded, and"
1353,OLD PLAY.,"there goes the seminary bell. 'Tis nine o'clock."" Jenny, Amy and Charlie,"
1354,OLD PLAY.,"ran down stairs all equipped for school, as Mrs. Mumbles and her daughter"

1356,OLD PLAY.,"invitation for the young ladies and Charlie to visit her, and the girls"
1357,OLD PLAY.,laughingly promised to do so at their first leisure. Mary Madeline went
1358,OLD PLAY.,"to Edson's store on an errand, and her mother proceeded directly home."
1359,OLD PLAY.,Great was her anger to behold the back kitchen door swinging wide. She
1360,OLD PLAY.,"shut it behind her with a slam, muttering some impatient exclamation"
1361,OLD PLAY.,about Mr. Salsify's stupid carelessness. As she stood by the stove
1362,OLD PLAY.,"warming her chilled fingers, a noise from the pantry startled her ears,"
1363,OLD PLAY.,"and, opening the door, she beheld the great, shaggy watch-dog, that"
1364,OLD PLAY.,"belonged to the store of Edson & Co., lying on his haunches with a nice"
1365,OLD PLAY.,"fat pullet between his paws, which he was devouring with evident relish"
1366,OLD PLAY.,"and gusto. He turned his head towards her, uttered a low growl, and went"
1367,OLD PLAY.,on with his breakfast again. Mrs. Salsify looked up to a peg on which she
1368,OLD PLAY.,had hung six nicely-dressed chickens the night before. Alas! the last one
1369,OLD PLAY.,was between the bloody devourer's paws. She glanced toward a pot she had
1370,OLD PLAY.,"left full of cream, under the shelves. It was empty; and toward her"
1371,OLD PLAY.,"rolling-board, where she had left a pan of rich pie-crust, with which she"
1372,OLD PLAY.,was intending to cover her thanksgiving pies. All had disappeared. She
1373,OLD PLAY.,trembled with rage.
1374,OLD PLAY.,
1375,OLD PLAY.,"""Get out, you thievish rascal!"" she exclaimed, bringing her foot"
1376,OLD PLAY.,violently to the floor.
1377,OLD PLAY.,
1378,OLD PLAY.,"The dog sprang toward her, and, seizing the skirt of her gay-striped,"
1379,OLD PLAY.,"bombazine dress with his glistening ivories, rent it from the waist, flew"
1380,OLD PLAY.,"through the parlor window, and rushed through streets, by-lanes and"
1381,OLD PLAY.,"alleys, rending the flaring fabric, and dragging it through mud-holes"
1382,OLD PLAY.,till it looked like some fiery-colored flag borne away by the enemy in
1383,OLD PLAY.,disgrace.
1384,OLD PLAY.,
1385,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Salsify rushed down into her husband's shop in awful plight, her"
1386,OLD PLAY.,"hair standing on end, and her great, green eyes almost starting from"
1387,OLD PLAY.,"their sockets. Mr. Salsify looked with amazement on his lady, as did also"
1388,OLD PLAY.,the half-score of customers that stood around his counters. Her
1389,OLD PLAY.,"saffron-colored skirt was rent in divers places, revealing the black one"
1390,OLD PLAY.,"she wore beneath, and the gay-striped waist she still wore was hung round"
1391,OLD PLAY.,with ragged fragments of the vanished skirt.
1392,OLD PLAY.,
1393,OLD PLAY.,"""Lord, love us, what is the matter?"" exclaimed Mr. Salsify, rushing"
1394,OLD PLAY.,toward his wife.
1395,OLD PLAY.,
1396,OLD PLAY.,"""Edson's dog has eat up six chickens, a cream-pot, a rolling-board,"
1397,OLD PLAY.,"pie-crust, and all!"" exclaimed Mrs. Mumbles, with a frantic air, as she"
1398,OLD PLAY.,"fell into her husband's outstretched arms, wholly unmindful of the"
1399,OLD PLAY.,laughter her appearance and words had excited among her good man's
1400,OLD PLAY.,customers.
1401,OLD PLAY.,
1402,OLD PLAY.,"""Edson's dog,--how could he get into the house?"" demanded Mr. Mumbles."
1403,OLD PLAY.,
1404,OLD PLAY.,"""I saw him out with Dick Giblet, this morning, when he was leaving"
1405,OLD PLAY.,"packages,"" said little Joe Bowles, with a mischievous leer in his black"
1406,OLD PLAY.,eyes.
1407,OLD PLAY.,
1408,OLD PLAY.,The husband and wife exchanged a glance. The whole truth flashed upon
1409,OLD PLAY.,"them,--'twas a trick of Dick's. Mr. Salsify ordered his customers to"
1410,OLD PLAY.,"leave the shop, and locking the door, he led his terrified, trembling"
1411,OLD PLAY.,"wife up stairs, where they found Mary Madeline lying on the floor in a"
1412,OLD PLAY.,"fainting fit, with the fragments of her mother's skirt clenched tightly"
1413,OLD PLAY.,in her cold hands.

1418,CHAPTER VI.,CHAPTER VI.
1419,CHAPTER VI.,
1420,CHAPTER VI.,"""Her face was fairer than face of earth;"
1421,CHAPTER VI.,What was the thing to liken it to?
1422,CHAPTER VI.,A lily just dipped in the summer dew?
1423,CHAPTER VI.,Parian marble--snow's first fall?
1424,CHAPTER VI.,"Her brow was fairer than each,--than all."
1425,CHAPTER VI.,"And so delicate was each vein's soft blue,"
1426,CHAPTER VI.,'Twas not like blood that wandered through.
1427,CHAPTER VI.,"Rarely upon that cheek was shed,"
1428,CHAPTER VI.,"By health or by youth, one tinge of red,"
1429,CHAPTER VI.,"And never closest look could descry,"
1430,CHAPTER VI.,"In shine or shade, the hue of her eye,"
1431,CHAPTER VI.,"But, as it were made of light, it changed"

1434,CHAPTER VI.,
1435,CHAPTER VI.,"The midnight stars were over all the heaven, O, wildly, wildly bright!"
1436,CHAPTER VI.,"Orion, like a flaming monarch, led up ""the host of palpitating stars"" to"
1437,CHAPTER VI.,"their proud zenith, while, far in the boreal regions, danced strange,"
1438,CHAPTER VI.,"atmospheric lights, with flitting, fantastic motions and ever-changing"
1439,CHAPTER VI.,forms and colors. A young girl stood in the deep recess of a large
1440,CHAPTER VI.,"window, with the rich, blue-wrought damask curtains wrapped closely about"
1441,CHAPTER VI.,"her slight, fragile form, gazing intently on the splendors of the"
1442,CHAPTER VI.,"midnight heaven. Long she stood there, and no sound broke the stillness,"
1443,CHAPTER VI.,"save now and then a half-audible sigh. At length she said, ""I cannot"
1444,CHAPTER VI.,endure this solitude and the depression which is stealing over me. Would
1445,CHAPTER VI.,that I had a mother to love and bless me! Father is often so strange and
1446,CHAPTER VI.,"silent, and Rufus cannot sympathize with my feelings. I must call Sylva"
1447,CHAPTER VI.,"to bear me company, for one of my nervous attacks is upon me, and I"
1448,CHAPTER VI.,"cannot sleep."" Softly opening a side-door, she said, in a voice scarcely"
1449,CHAPTER VI.,"above a whisper, ""Sylva, are you awake?"""
1450,CHAPTER VI.,
1451,CHAPTER VI.,"""Yes,"" was the answer; ""what is your wish, Miss Edith?"""
1452,CHAPTER VI.,
1453,CHAPTER VI.,"""That you would come and sit with me a while."""
1454,CHAPTER VI.,
1455,CHAPTER VI.,"""What time is it!"""
1456,CHAPTER VI.,
1457,CHAPTER VI.,"""I know not; but, by the stars, it should be little after midnight."""
1458,CHAPTER VI.,
1459,CHAPTER VI.,"""Return to your room, and I will soon be there with a light,"" answered"
1460,CHAPTER VI.,the one called Sylva.
1461,CHAPTER VI.,
1462,CHAPTER VI.,"The young girl did as requested, and sank down in a large arm-chair which"
1463,CHAPTER VI.,nearly concealed her in its soft cushions. Presently the small side-door
1464,CHAPTER VI.,"opened, and Sylva entered, bearing an astral lamp and a few light pieces"
1465,CHAPTER VI.,of kindling wood.
1466,CHAPTER VI.,
1467,CHAPTER VI.,"""O, I don't mind a fire!"" said Miss Edith."
1468,CHAPTER VI.,
1469,CHAPTER VI.,"""Well, I do,"" answered the woman; ""you would catch your death, up here"
1470,CHAPTER VI.,"half the night with no fire."""
1471,CHAPTER VI.,
1472,CHAPTER VI.,"""'Tis a cold place we are come to, isn't it Sylva?"" said the young lady,"
1473,CHAPTER VI.,"springing from her chair and wrapping an elegant cashmere dressing-gown,"
1474,CHAPTER VI.,"lined with azure satin, round her tall, delicate figure, and then again"
1475,CHAPTER VI.,sinking down among the soft velvet cushions of her spacious fauteuil.
1476,CHAPTER VI.,
1477,CHAPTER VI.,"""Yes, Miss Edith, it is, indeed,"" answered Sylva, as she lighted a bright"
1478,CHAPTER VI.,"fire in the polished grate. ""How your father expects to rear so fragile a"
1479,CHAPTER VI.,"bud in this bleak region I do not know."""
1480,CHAPTER VI.,
1481,CHAPTER VI.,"""I have never seen him in such spirits as since we came here,"" returned"
1482,CHAPTER VI.,"Edith, toying with the silken tassels of her rich robe. ""You know he was"
1483,CHAPTER VI.,"always so silent and reserved in our former home, Sylva. But sometimes I"
1484,CHAPTER VI.,fancy there is something unnatural in his manner. One moment he will
1485,CHAPTER VI.,"laugh wildly, and the next a dark frown will have gathered on his brow."
1486,CHAPTER VI.,"Twice he has caught me in his arms and said, 'Edith! Edith, you have a"
1487,CHAPTER VI.,"part to play, and I rely on you to do it!' Then he would look on me so"
1488,CHAPTER VI.,"sternly, I would burst into tears, and strive to free myself from his"
1489,CHAPTER VI.,"embrace. What did he mean by such words, Sylva?"""
1490,CHAPTER VI.,
1491,CHAPTER VI.,"""Why, that you are coming on to the stage of action, and he desires you"
1492,CHAPTER VI.,to be educated and accomplished in a manner to adorn the high circles in
1493,CHAPTER VI.,"which you will move."""
1494,CHAPTER VI.,
1495,CHAPTER VI.,"""O, more than that, Sylva!"" said Edith doubtfully; ""he need not have"
1496,CHAPTER VI.,"looked so stern, were that all; but still he is a kind, indulgent father"
1497,CHAPTER VI.,"for the most part. I should not complain;"" and the young girl relapsed"
1498,CHAPTER VI.,into thoughtful silence. The pale fire-light glowed on her delicate
1499,CHAPTER VI.,"features. One tiny white hand rested on the cushioned arm of the chair,"
1500,CHAPTER VI.,"and the large, melancholy blue eyes were fixed on the glowing blaze"
1501,CHAPTER VI.,within the shining ebon grate. The profile was strictly Grecian in
1502,CHAPTER VI.,"outline, and the soft, silken hair fell in a shower of golden ripples"
1503,CHAPTER VI.,"over her small, sloping shoulders. Her lips were vermilion red, and"
1504,CHAPTER VI.,disclosed two rows of tiny pearls whenever they parted with dimpling
1505,CHAPTER VI.,smiles.
1506,CHAPTER VI.,
1507,CHAPTER VI.,"""Have you become acquainted with any of the village people, Sylva?"" asked"
1508,CHAPTER VI.,"the fair girl, rousing at length from her reverie."
1509,CHAPTER VI.,
1510,CHAPTER VI.,"""No, save this young Mrs. Edson, who called yesterday, I have seen no"
1511,CHAPTER VI.,"one,"" returned the woman, ""unless I mention that sunken-eyed washerwoman,"
1512,CHAPTER VI.,"Dilly Danforth, as she is called."""
1513,CHAPTER VI.,
1514,CHAPTER VI.,"""O, I saw her on the steps one day! What a forlorn-looking creature she"
1515,CHAPTER VI.,"is! I think she must be very poor. Still, it seems to me there should be"
1516,CHAPTER VI.,"no poverty in this rich, happy-appearing village. I fancy it will be a"
1517,CHAPTER VI.,"love of a place in summer, Sylva, when all the maples and lindens are in"
1518,CHAPTER VI.,"leaf, and the numerous gardens in flower. O, when father took me out in"
1519,CHAPTER VI.,"the new sleighing phaeton last week, I saw a most magnificent mansion,"
1520,CHAPTER VI.,"grander than ours, even. The grounds seemed beautifully laid out, and"
1521,CHAPTER VI.,over the arching gateway I read the words 'Summer Home' sculptured in the
1522,CHAPTER VI.,"marble. It is closed at present, but when the occupants return in the"
1523,CHAPTER VI.,"spring, I hope I shall get to know them, for I would dearly love to visit"
1524,CHAPTER VI.,at so delightful a place. Father said I should become acquainted with the
1525,CHAPTER VI.,"family. He knows their names, and I think said he had met the gentleman"
1526,CHAPTER VI.,"once."" Edith grew quite smiling and happy as she prattled on, forming"
1527,CHAPTER VI.,plans and diversions for the coming summer. Sylva listened to her
1528,CHAPTER VI.,"innocent conversation in respectful silence, and, after a while, as the"
1529,CHAPTER VI.,"fire burned low, and the cocks began to crow from their neighboring"
1530,CHAPTER VI.,"perches, the sweet girl ceased to speak. She had wearied herself and"
1531,CHAPTER VI.,fallen asleep.
1532,CHAPTER VI.,
1533,CHAPTER VI.,The sun was shining brightly through the blue damask curtains when she
1534,CHAPTER VI.,"awoke, and Sylva was bending over her, parting away the rich masses of"
1535,CHAPTER VI.,auburn curls which had fallen over her face as she leaned her head over
1536,CHAPTER VI.,"the arm of the chair. ""Your father and Rufus are calling for you,"" said"
1537,CHAPTER VI.,the attendant pleasantly.
1538,CHAPTER VI.,
1539,CHAPTER VI.,"""Why, how long I have slept!"" said Edith, opening her blue eyes with a"
1540,CHAPTER VI.,"wondering expression. ""What o'clock is it, Sylva?"""
1541,CHAPTER VI.,
1542,CHAPTER VI.,"""It is half-past nine,"" answered the woman."
1543,CHAPTER VI.,
1544,CHAPTER VI.,"""I have been dreaming the strangest dream about that beautiful mansion I"
1545,CHAPTER VI.,"was telling you I saw in my ride the other day--that 'Summer Home,' as it"
1546,CHAPTER VI.,"is so sweetly styled. I thought I saw a lovely young girl there, younger"
1547,CHAPTER VI.,"than myself, but far more womanly in aspect, and she said she was my"
1548,CHAPTER VI.,"cousin, and kissed me, and gave me rare flowers and delicious fruit. Did"
1549,CHAPTER VI.,"you say father had called for me? Well, I'll dress and go down in the"
1550,CHAPTER VI.,"parlor. What are you doing there, Sylva?"""
1551,CHAPTER VI.,
1552,CHAPTER VI.,"""Getting your muff and tippet,"" answered she."
1553,CHAPTER VI.,
1554,CHAPTER VI.,"""Is father going to take me out?"" asked Edith with animation."
1555,CHAPTER VI.,
1556,CHAPTER VI.,"""Rufus is going to take you to church,"" said Sylva. ""He said you"
1557,CHAPTER VI.,"expressed a wish to go last Sabbath, but it was too cold. To-day is more"
1558,CHAPTER VI.,"pleasant, and he is ready to attend you."""
1559,CHAPTER VI.,
1560,CHAPTER VI.,"""He is kind,"" said Edith. ""Am I not a naughty girl to murmur when I have"
1561,CHAPTER VI.,"a brother so good, and a father who loves me so dearly?"""
1562,CHAPTER VI.,
1563,CHAPTER VI.,"""You do not murmur, do you, Miss Edith?"""
1564,CHAPTER VI.,
1565,CHAPTER VI.,"""Sometimes I wish I had a mother, or that she had lived long enough to"
1566,CHAPTER VI.,"leave her form and features impressed on my memory."""
1567,CHAPTER VI.,
1568,CHAPTER VI.,"A tear fell as the fair girl spoke thus, but she brushed it quickly away,"
1569,CHAPTER VI.,and commenced arraying herself for church.
1570,CHAPTER VI.,
1571,CHAPTER VI.,"""I shall be delighted to behold the interior of that antiquated looking"
1572,CHAPTER VI.,"building,"" remarked she, as Sylva placed the dainty hat over the"
1573,CHAPTER VI.,"clustering curls; ""and, besides, I can see all the village people, and"
1574,CHAPTER VI.,form some opinion of those who are henceforth to constitute our
1575,CHAPTER VI.,"associates and friends."""
1576,CHAPTER VI.,
1577,CHAPTER VI.,"""And all the people will see you, too,"" said Sylva, smiling."
1578,CHAPTER VI.,
1579,CHAPTER VI.,"""O, I don't mind that!"" answered Edith; ""they would all see me, sooner or"
1580,CHAPTER VI.,"later, as I'm to go to school, in the spring, at the white seminary on"
1581,CHAPTER VI.,"the hill."""
1582,CHAPTER VI.,
1583,CHAPTER VI.,"Thus speaking, the beautiful girl descended to the drawing-room. A tall,"
1584,CHAPTER VI.,"elegantly-proportioned man, with a magnificent head of raven black hair,"
1585,CHAPTER VI.,"which hung in one dense mass of luxuriant curls all round his broad,"
1586,CHAPTER VI.,"marble-like brow, and quite over his manly shoulders, was leaning in a"
1587,CHAPTER VI.,"careless, graceful attitude against a splendid mahogany-cased piano, that"
1588,CHAPTER VI.,"stood in the centre of the apartment, and moving his white, taper fingers"
1589,CHAPTER VI.,"over the pearl-tipped keys, waking now rich bursts of song, and, anon,"
1590,CHAPTER VI.,"dwelling long on deep, solemn notes, that pierced the soul with"
1591,CHAPTER VI.,"melancholy. He did not move when the door opened, and Edith crossed the"
1592,CHAPTER VI.,room and stood beside him ere he noticed her presence.
1593,CHAPTER VI.,
1594,CHAPTER VI.,"""Where is brother Rufus?"" she asked, drawing on her tiny, lemon-colored"
1595,CHAPTER VI.,gloves.
1596,CHAPTER VI.,
1597,CHAPTER VI.,The gentleman turned and gazed down upon the fair speaker. The clear
1598,CHAPTER VI.,complexion and soft blue eyes of the daughter were exact counterparts of
1599,CHAPTER VI.,the father's; so were the rich red lips and pearly teeth. Their only
1600,CHAPTER VI.,"point of difference was in the color of the hair. ""What do you want of"
1601,CHAPTER VI.,"Rufus?"" asked he, in a tone almost stern, after he had gazed on her"
1602,CHAPTER VI.,"several moments in silence. She turned her speaking eyes upon his face,"
1603,CHAPTER VI.,"and answered, ""Sylva said he would take me to church."""
1604,CHAPTER VI.,
1605,CHAPTER VI.,"""To church!"" said her father, now relaxing his features into a smile,"
1606,CHAPTER VI.,"""what an odd fancy! And are you arrayed in this fine garb to attend"
1607,CHAPTER VI.,"service in an old, dilapidated country church?"""
1608,CHAPTER VI.,
1609,CHAPTER VI.,"""Do you think me very finely-dressed?"" said Edith, archly, as she for a"
1610,CHAPTER VI.,moment surveyed herself in the large mirror which hung from ceiling to
1611,CHAPTER VI.,floor between the eastern windows. She wore a crimson velvet dress and
1612,CHAPTER VI.,"mantle, a muff and tippet of white ermine, and a chapeau of light blue"
1613,CHAPTER VI.,"satin, with a long, drooping white plume. Her hair was gathered into"
1614,CHAPTER VI.,"luxuriant masses of curls each side of her sweet face, and confined by"
1615,CHAPTER VI.,sprays of pearls and turquoises.
1616,CHAPTER VI.,
1617,CHAPTER VI.,Rufus now entered. He was very unlike his sister in personal appearance.
1618,CHAPTER VI.,"His hair was the color of his father's, but far less abundant, and"
1619,CHAPTER VI.,"straight as an Indian's. Eyes and complexion were both dark, and his"
1620,CHAPTER VI.,"countenance indicative of rather low intelligence, and weak intellectual"
1621,CHAPTER VI.,powers. The father looked on him as though he was not quite satisfied
1622,CHAPTER VI.,"with the son who was, probably, to perpetuate his name."
1623,CHAPTER VI.,
1624,CHAPTER VI.,"""Are you ready, Edith?"" asked the youth."
1625,CHAPTER VI.,
1626,CHAPTER VI.,"""Yes,"" she returned. He approached to give her his arm, and, as they were"
1627,CHAPTER VI.,"passing out, Edith caught her father looking grimly on them, and said"
1628,CHAPTER VI.,"quickly, ""Do you mind our going to church, papa? We will stay at home if"
1629,CHAPTER VI.,"you wish."""
1630,CHAPTER VI.,
1631,CHAPTER VI.,"""No, go along!"" said he. ""I'll not thwart you in so small a matter, and"
1632,CHAPTER VI.,"hope I may never have occasion to in a greater!"" Edith looked up in his"
1633,CHAPTER VI.,face as he uttered these last words. There was a dark shade flitting over
1634,CHAPTER VI.,it. It haunted her all the while she was walking to church; but so many
1635,CHAPTER VI.,"things occupied her attention, after entering, it passed from her mind."

1648,CHAPTER VII.,"Winter was passing away, and Wimbledon was making but slow progress"
1649,CHAPTER VII.,toward the better knowledge of the new family that had come among them.
1650,CHAPTER VII.,The silver plate on the hall door announced the master's name as Col. J.
1651,CHAPTER VII.,"Corydon Malcome, a sounding appellation enough; and he was often seen"
1652,CHAPTER VII.,"walking up and down the streets in his rich, fur-lined overcoat and laced"
1653,CHAPTER VII.,"velvet cap, placed with a courtly air over his cloud of ebon curls. He"
1654,CHAPTER VII.,"was known to be a widower, and the woful extravagancies into which Mary"
1655,CHAPTER VII.,"Madeline Mumbles cajoled her doting mother, were enough to make one"
1656,CHAPTER VII.,"shudder in relating. Wimbledon was ransacked for the gayest taffetas, the"
1657,CHAPTER VII.,"jauntiest bonnets, and broadest Dutch lace, till, at length, poor Mr."
1658,CHAPTER VII.,"Salsify went to his wife with a doleful countenance, and told her he"
1659,CHAPTER VII.,"could never ""rise in his profession"" as long as she upheld Madeline in"
1660,CHAPTER VII.,"such whimsical extravagance. Mrs. Salsify looked lofty, and tossed her"
1661,CHAPTER VII.,"carroty head; but her husband had waxed bold in his distress, and could"
1662,CHAPTER VII.,"not be intimidated by ireful brows, or pursed-up lips. So he proceeded to"
1663,CHAPTER VII.,"free his mind on this wise: ""As for Mary Madeline's ever catching that"
1664,CHAPTER VII.,"haughty, black-headed Col. Malcome, I know better; she can't do it, and I"
1665,CHAPTER VII.,"would much rather have her marry Theophilus Shaw, who is a steady, modest"
1666,CHAPTER VII.,"shoemaker. He makes good wages, and can maintain a wife comfortably, and"
1667,CHAPTER VII.,would treat her well; which is more than I would trust that
1668,CHAPTER VII.,"murderous-looking colonel to do."""
1669,CHAPTER VII.,
1670,CHAPTER VII.,"""Well, you will have your own way, I suppose,"" said Mrs. S., putting on"
1671,CHAPTER VII.,"an injured expression. ""I see it is about as Mrs. Pimble and the"
1672,CHAPTER VII.,"sisterhood tell me. Men are all a set of tyrants, and the women are their"
1673,CHAPTER VII.,"slaves."""
1674,CHAPTER VII.,
1675,CHAPTER VII.,"""Come, come, wife!"" said Mr. Salsify, impatiently; ""pray, don't get any"
1676,CHAPTER VII.,"of those foolish notions in your head. Depend upon it, nothing could so"
1677,CHAPTER VII.,effectually put a stop to my 'rising in my profession.' The piazza and
1678,CHAPTER VII.,"second story could never be built, if you neglected your home affairs,"
1679,CHAPTER VII.,"and went cantering about the country, like those evil-spirited women,"
1680,CHAPTER VII.,"turning everything topsy-turvy, and mocking at all law and order; but I"
1681,CHAPTER VII.,"know my wife has a mind too delicate and feminine to commit such bold,"
1682,CHAPTER VII.,"masculine actions."""
1683,CHAPTER VII.,
1684,CHAPTER VII.,Mr. Mumbles had chosen the right weapon with which to combat his wife's
1685,CHAPTER VII.,inclinations toward the Woman's Rights mania. A love of flattery was her
1686,CHAPTER VII.,"weak point. It is with half her sex. We too often say, by way of"
1687,CHAPTER VII.,"expressing our disapproval of a certain man, ""O, he is a gross"
1688,CHAPTER VII.,"flatterer!"" thus very frequently condemning the quality we most admire in"
1689,CHAPTER VII.,"him;--or, if not the one we most admire, at least the one which affords"
1690,CHAPTER VII.,us most pleasure and gratification when in his society. But to our tale:
1691,CHAPTER VII.,
1692,CHAPTER VII.,"On a certain blustering January day, a sleigh, containing two ladies and"
1693,CHAPTER VII.,"a gentleman, drove to the door of Col. Malcome's elegant mansion, and"
1694,CHAPTER VII.,were ushered into the spacious drawing-room by the blooming-visaged
1695,CHAPTER VII.,housekeeper. Col. Malcome arose from the luxurious sofa on which he had
1696,CHAPTER VII.,"been reclining among a profusion of costly furs, and received his"
1697,CHAPTER VII.,"visitors with an air of courtly magnificence, which might have had the"
1698,CHAPTER VII.,"effect to intimidate a modest, retiring female; but not king Solomon in"
1699,CHAPTER VII.,"all his glory could intimidate or abash Mrs. Judith Justitia Pimble, or"
1700,CHAPTER VII.,"Mrs. Rebecca Potentia Lawson. As for poor, insignificant Peter Pimble, he"
1701,CHAPTER VII.,looked quite aghast with terror and astonishment at his own temerity in
1702,CHAPTER VII.,"penetrating to a presence so imposing and sublime, and cuddled away in"
1703,CHAPTER VII.,"the most obscure corner he could find, while his majestic wife assumed a"
1704,CHAPTER VII.,"velvet-cushioned arm-chair, which stood beside a marble table."
1705,CHAPTER VII.,
1706,CHAPTER VII.,"""Perhaps you do not know our names?"" said Mrs. Pimble, bending a sharp"
1707,CHAPTER VII.,glance on Col. Malcome from beneath her shaggy brows.
1708,CHAPTER VII.,
1709,CHAPTER VII.,"""I certainly have not that pleasure, madam,"" answered the colonel, with a"
1710,CHAPTER VII.,graceful bow.
1711,CHAPTER VII.,
1712,CHAPTER VII.,"""I do not like that style of address,"" said Mrs. Lawson, arising from the"
1713,CHAPTER VII.,"ottoman on which she had been sitting, with her broad, white palms"
1714,CHAPTER VII.,"extended to the warmth of the glowing grate, and throwing her stately"
1715,CHAPTER VII.,"form upon a crimson sofa; ""it is a fawning, affected, puppyish manner,"
1716,CHAPTER VII.,"which men assume when speaking to women, as if they were not capable of"

1726,CHAPTER VII.,"upright among the furs which were piled up around him, and stared at his"
1727,CHAPTER VII.,"visitors. Yes, refined and polite though he was, he forgot his"
1728,CHAPTER VII.,"good-breeding in surprise at the coarse, singular manners of his"
1729,CHAPTER VII.,involuntary guests. The figure in the extreme corner of the apartment at

1756,CHAPTER VII.,"""My housekeeper, madam, as I have just informed you."""
1757,CHAPTER VII.,
1758,CHAPTER VII.,"""She has no other name, I suppose?"" said Mrs. Pimble, in a loud, ironical"

1769,CHAPTER VII.,
1770,CHAPTER VII.,"Col. Malcome, who loved the satirical, had a mind to apply it here, but"

1773,CHAPTER VII.,
1774,CHAPTER VII.,"""That is, in _your_ opinion,"" said Mrs. Pimble. ""Now let me tell you"

1791,CHAPTER VII.,"""Well, make the statement, sister Potentia,"" said Mrs. Pimble, folding"
1792,CHAPTER VII.,"her brawny arms over her capacious chest, and giving a loud, masculine"

1794,CHAPTER VII.,
1795,CHAPTER VII.,"""Mr. Malcome, we would like to see the female portion of your household,"""
1796,CHAPTER VII.,"said Mrs. Lawson, in a slow, measured tone, with an emphasis on every"

1799,CHAPTER VII.,"As the colonel, indignant at the coarse vulgarity of the intruders, was"
1800,CHAPTER VII.,"about to reply in the negative--the door opened, and Edith entered,"
1801,CHAPTER VII.,"accompanied by Sylva, who led a small, white Spanish poodle by a silver"
1802,CHAPTER VII.,"cord. The little animal capered gracefully about, cutting all sorts of"
1803,CHAPTER VII.,"cunning antics, much to the amusement of the young girl, till at length"
1804,CHAPTER VII.,"discovering the muffled shape of Pimble behind the door, he ran up to"
1805,CHAPTER VII.,"him, smelt at his clothes, and commenced a furious barking."
1806,CHAPTER VII.,
1807,CHAPTER VII.,"""You had better go out doors, Pimble,"" said his wife; ""you are so"

1809,CHAPTER VII.,
1810,CHAPTER VII.,"Mrs. Lawson laughed loudly at this witty speech, and the poor man was"

1813,CHAPTER VII.,"Quiet being restored, and Mr. Pimble having ventured to drop tremblingly"
1814,CHAPTER VII.,"on the extreme edge of the chair offered for his comfort and convenience,"
1815,CHAPTER VII.,"Col. Malcome said, ""You wished to see the female portion of my"

1817,CHAPTER VII.,
1818,CHAPTER VII.,"""Her attendant!"" remarked Mrs. Lawson, ""I do not know as I exactly"

1824,CHAPTER VII.,
1825,CHAPTER VII.,"""Ay, yes; her waiting-woman,"" resumed Mrs. L. ""Well, your daughter looks"
1826,CHAPTER VII.,"rather puny and sickly. She needs exercise in the open air, I should"
1827,CHAPTER VII.,"say,--narrow-chested,--comes from a consumptive family on the mother's"

1829,CHAPTER VII.,
1830,CHAPTER VII.,"""Madam,"" said Col. Malcome, with a sudden anger in his tone and manner,"

1832,CHAPTER VII.,"daughter comes."""
1833,CHAPTER VII.,
1834,CHAPTER VII.,"""O, no particular business,"" continued Mrs. Lawson, with undisturbed"
1835,CHAPTER VII.,"equanimity; ""I only judged her to come of a consumptive race by her face"
1836,CHAPTER VII.,and form. Public speaking would be an excellent remedy for her weakly
1837,CHAPTER VII.,"appearance. That enlarges the lungs, and creates confidence and reliance"
1838,CHAPTER VII.,"on one's own powers. Miss Malcome, would you not like to attend some of"
1839,CHAPTER VII.,"our lectures and reform clubs?"""
1840,CHAPTER VII.,
1841,CHAPTER VII.,"""I don't know,"" answered Edith, tremblingly. ""I think I would if father"
1842,CHAPTER VII.,"is willing;"" and she turned her sweet blue eyes up to his face, as if to"
1843,CHAPTER VII.,read there her permission or refusal.
1844,CHAPTER VII.,
1845,CHAPTER VII.,"""A slave to parental authority, I see,"" remarked Mrs. Pimble; ""but this"
1846,CHAPTER VII.,"lady, grown to years of maturity; she, surely, should have a mind of her"
1847,CHAPTER VII.,"own. Don't you think woman is made a galley-slave by the tyrant man?"" she"
1848,CHAPTER VII.,"demanded, turning her discourse on Sylva, who looked confused, as if she"
1849,CHAPTER VII.,"did not quite understand the speech addressed to her. At length, she"
1850,CHAPTER VII.,"asked timidly, ""What woman do you refer to, madam?"" ""To all women upon"
1851,CHAPTER VII.,"the face of the earth!"" returned Mrs. Pimble, vehemently. ""Are they not"

1853,CHAPTER VII.,"by self-inflated, tyrannizing man?"""
1854,CHAPTER VII.,
1855,CHAPTER VII.,"""O, no!"" answered Sylva, innocently; ""no man ever put a chain on me, or"
1856,CHAPTER VII.,"on any woman of my acquaintance, or ever pushed one down in the dirt."""
1857,CHAPTER VII.,
1858,CHAPTER VII.,"""Poor fool!"" exclaimed Mrs. Pimble, with great indignation; ""you are"

1860,CHAPTER VII.,"hold you there."""
1861,CHAPTER VII.,
1862,CHAPTER VII.,The figure that trembled on the edge of the chair was now heard calling
1863,CHAPTER VII.,"faintly, ""Mrs. Pimble--Mrs. Pimble."""

1898,OLD PLAY.,The pale moonbeams peeped through the rents and crevices of Dilly
1899,OLD PLAY.,"Danforth's wretched abode, as the poor woman sat on the hearth with"
1900,OLD PLAY.,"Willie's head lying in her lap, while he read by the flickering"
1901,OLD PLAY.,fire-light from the pages of a well-worn Bible. The little fellow had
1902,OLD PLAY.,"never fully recovered from that long, painful illness that had nearly"
1903,OLD PLAY.,"cost him his life, and from which it is very possible he would never"
1904,OLD PLAY.,have arisen but for those little bundles of firewood that were so
1905,OLD PLAY.,"providentially laid on poor Dilly's threshold, by some charitable, though"
1906,OLD PLAY.,"unknown, hand. They still continued to be placed there, and it was well"
1907,OLD PLAY.,"they were so, for Mrs. Danforth's health had failed so much she was not"
1908,OLD PLAY.,able to perform half her former amount of labor; and had it not been for
1909,OLD PLAY.,"these small armfuls of fuel, which very much resembled those Willie used"
1910,OLD PLAY.,"to collect, the washerwoman and her boy must have perished during the"
1911,OLD PLAY.,"long, cold winter season. Yes, perished in the very midst of Wimbledon;"
1912,OLD PLAY.,"within a stone's throw of many a well-filled woodyard, and under the nose"
1913,OLD PLAY.,of a Mrs. Pimble's philanthropic efforts for the amelioration of her
1914,OLD PLAY.,"species. Dilly's neglect on the part of the many arose, not so much from"
1915,OLD PLAY.,"inhumanity and covetousness, as from a wrong bias, which a few words had"
1916,OLD PLAY.,"created in the people's minds. A report had passed through the village,"
1917,OLD PLAY.,"several months before, purporting to come from a reliable source, which"
1918,OLD PLAY.,represented Mrs. Danforth as not so poor as she appeared; that she
1919,OLD PLAY.,"assumed her poverty-stricken garb and appearance to excite sympathy, and"
1920,OLD PLAY.,"thus swindle, in a small way, from the purses of her wealthy neighbors."
1921,OLD PLAY.,There is nothing of which people have a greater horror than of being
1922,OLD PLAY.,"humbugged, if they know it; so, for the most part, the Wimbledonians"
1923,OLD PLAY.,turned a deaf ear and cold shoulder on the washerwoman's sorrowful
1924,OLD PLAY.,"supplications for charity. Little Edith Malcome pitied the pale, sad face"
1925,OLD PLAY.,"that appeared at the kitchen door every Monday morning, and always asked"
1926,OLD PLAY.,"her father's permission to give her a basket of victuals to carry home,"

1942,OLD PLAY.,
1943,OLD PLAY.,"""O, not disgusting! is he, father?"" said Edith, ""only odd and droll; and"

1945,OLD PLAY.,"wouldn't wear that short-waisted, long-tailed coat, with those funny"

1962,OLD PLAY.,to obey her summons to the window.
1963,OLD PLAY.,
1964,OLD PLAY.,"""Because I would like to know it,"" returned she. ""I fancy he is some"
1965,OLD PLAY.,"relation of that pale Dilly Danforth's, for he has just such mournful"
1966,OLD PLAY.,"eyes."""
1967,OLD PLAY.,
1968,OLD PLAY.,"""I do not wish to see them then,"" said her father, with some impatience"

1971,OLD PLAY.,"""They are very sad,"" said Edith, ""but sorrow has made them so. I think"

1975,OLD PLAY.,
1976,OLD PLAY.,"""No,"" answered Col. M. in a tone which dismissed the subject; ""I cannot"

1979,OLD PLAY.,
1980,OLD PLAY.,"Edith looked on her father's stern brow, and, feeling it was useless to"
1981,OLD PLAY.,"urge her plea any longer, stole away to her own apartment, where she"
1982,OLD PLAY.,found Sylva engaged in feeding her canaries and furnishing them with
1983,OLD PLAY.,"fresh water. The little bright creatures were singing sweetly, but Edith"
1984,OLD PLAY.,"did not heed their songs. She stood apart by a window, and gazed out on"
1985,OLD PLAY.,"the falling snowflakes. At length she saw Rufus enter the yard, and soon"
1986,OLD PLAY.,"heard him ascending the stairs. ""Where have you been, brother?"" she"
1987,OLD PLAY.,"asked, as he came in, his face reddened by exposure to the cold, biting"
1988,OLD PLAY.,atmosphere.
1989,OLD PLAY.,
1990,OLD PLAY.,"""Down on the river, skating with some of the village boys,"" answered he,"
1991,OLD PLAY.,"drawing a chair close to the glowing fire; ""and O, such a fine time as we"
1992,OLD PLAY.,"had! I shall be glad when we go to school, Edith; it will be so much more"
1993,OLD PLAY.,"lively and pleasant."""
1994,OLD PLAY.,
1995,OLD PLAY.,"""I shall be glad when the snow is gone, so I can run out doors, and sow"
1996,OLD PLAY.,"my flower-beds,"" returned Edith, thoughtfully. Then she sat gazing in the"
1997,OLD PLAY.,"fire a long time, as was always her wont when thinking deeply on any"
1998,OLD PLAY.,"subject. Sylva had finished her care of the birds, and brought forth Fido"
1999,OLD PLAY.,"from his little cot-bed in her room. He sprang into Edith's lap, then"
2000,OLD PLAY.,"into Rufus', kissing their cheeks and evincing his joy at beholding them"
2001,OLD PLAY.,"in various pleasing, expressive ways. But Edith pushed him away and told"
2002,OLD PLAY.,Sylva to put him to bed again. So the brisk little fellow was carried
2003,OLD PLAY.,"off, looking very sorry, and wailing piteously, as if he pleaded"
2004,OLD PLAY.,permission to remain by the warm fire.
2005,OLD PLAY.,
2006,OLD PLAY.,"Rufus was younger than his sister, and of an intelligence and refinement"
2007,OLD PLAY.,"so far below hers, that she seldom evinced much pleasure or enjoyment in"

2009,OLD PLAY.,"interest, as he said,"
2010,OLD PLAY.,
2011,OLD PLAY.,"""O, Edith, I saw the funniest man this morning!"""
2012,OLD PLAY.,
2013,OLD PLAY.,"""Where?"" she asked quickly."
2014,OLD PLAY.,
2015,OLD PLAY.,"""Down by the side of the river among a clump of brushwood, gathering"

2019,OLD PLAY.,"""Did he wear a long overcoat with small capes on the shoulders, and a"

2023,OLD PLAY.,
2024,OLD PLAY.,"""Passing along in the street,"" returned she. ""Did Charlie know his name?"""
2025,OLD PLAY.,
2026,OLD PLAY.,"""No; but he said it was a man who lived alone in a small hut, far off in"
2027,OLD PLAY.,"the forest, made of the boughs and branches of cedar trees, curiously"
2028,OLD PLAY.,"twisted together; and he is thence styled the _Hermit of the Cedars_."""
2029,OLD PLAY.,
2030,OLD PLAY.,"""A hermit!"" exclaimed Edith. ""I have read of such beings in old books,"
2031,OLD PLAY.,"but I never supposed they really existed, or at least never expected I"
2032,OLD PLAY.,should see one with my own eyes. I shall like this place better than
2033,OLD PLAY.,"ever, now; it will be so romantic to have a hermit in our vicinity. What"
2034,OLD PLAY.,"do you suppose he was going to do with his bundles of sticks, Rufus?"""
2035,OLD PLAY.,
2036,OLD PLAY.,"""Use them for firewood, probably,"" said he."
2037,OLD PLAY.,
2038,OLD PLAY.,"""But I should have thought he might have obtained that in the forest"
2039,OLD PLAY.,"where he lives, and not been obliged to travel all the way down here,"
2040,OLD PLAY.,"this stormy day, to pick up wood from among the snow, and then carry it"
2041,OLD PLAY.,"two or three miles in his arms,"" said Edith, in a ruminating tone."
2042,OLD PLAY.,
2043,OLD PLAY.,"""O, hermits are strange beings, sis!"" answered Rufus, whistling a vacant"
2044,OLD PLAY.,tune as he stood before the window gazing forth on the dismal storm which
2045,OLD PLAY.,debarred him from his accustomed diversion of skating on the frozen
2046,OLD PLAY.,surface of the river.
2047,OLD PLAY.,
2048,OLD PLAY.,"While his children were occupied with the preceding conversation, Col."
2049,OLD PLAY.,Malcome had donned his fur-lined overcoat and stepped across the yard to

2051,OLD PLAY.,"so smart a visitor in their unostentatious little parlor, but the"
2052,OLD PLAY.,"colonel, by his gentlemanly grace, soon placed them at their ease. After"
2053,OLD PLAY.,"a few moments' conversation on general topics, he asked, casually enough,"

2058,OLD PLAY.,"""O, that is Major Tom Howard's!"" answered Deacon Allen. ""His family have"

2078,OLD PLAY.,"""And has he not lost one?"""
2079,OLD PLAY.,
2080,OLD PLAY.,"""Not since he came among us; though his wife, I have understood, always"

2114,CHAPTER IX.,
2115,CHAPTER IX.,The fine parlors of Mr. Leroy Edson's tasteful mansion were brilliantly
2116,CHAPTER IX.,illuminated. Warm fires glowed in the shining marble grates. Dim argand
2117,CHAPTER IX.,"lamps bathed in soft light the rich furniture, carved cornices, and rare"
2118,CHAPTER IX.,statuary which decorated the mantels. The élite of Wimbledon were
2119,CHAPTER IX.,"assembling, and young Mrs. Edson moved lightly to and fro, receiving her"
2120,CHAPTER IX.,"numerous guests with graceful self-possession, and welcoming them to her"
2121,CHAPTER IX.,"home and heart with warm, earnest cordiality. They were nearly all"
2122,CHAPTER IX.,"strangers to her, as she had been but a few months installed mistress of"
2123,CHAPTER IX.,Mr. Edson's splendid mansion; but she felt they were the people among
2124,CHAPTER IX.,whom she was henceforth to live and find her associates and friends. She
2125,CHAPTER IX.,"had made one call, only, since her arrival in Wimbledon, and that on Col."
2126,CHAPTER IX.,"Malcome's family, who were later comers than herself."
2127,CHAPTER IX.,
2128,CHAPTER IX.,"Louise Edson was graceful, brilliant, beautiful. O, what a wealth of"
2129,CHAPTER IX.,"thought and intellect was hers; what a broad, generous nature; what"
2130,CHAPTER IX.,"lightning-like perceptions, quick, far-seeing judgment, sparkling humor"
2131,CHAPTER IX.,"and sarcastic wit! She floated in a sea of exuberant life and beauty,"
2132,CHAPTER IX.,which was fed continually from the exhaustless fountains of her own
2133,CHAPTER IX.,"thought-wealthy soul. Her calm, clear eyes mirrored the bright fancies"
2134,CHAPTER IX.,"that flitted through her brain. The chestnut hair, brushed away from the"
2135,CHAPTER IX.,"youthful brow, revealed the tiny blue veins on the white expanding"
2136,CHAPTER IX.,"temples; while the high, straight nose and curved nostrils, with the"
2137,CHAPTER IX.,"sweet little mouth and tapering chin that smiled below, made up a face"
2138,CHAPTER IX.,whose regular features were its least claim to beauty. It was the soul
2139,CHAPTER IX.,within which shone over these features and lighted them at times with
2140,CHAPTER IX.,supernatural loveliness. And was this brilliant being understood and
2141,CHAPTER IX.,appreciated by the man who had won her for his bride? Faugh!--we blush at
2142,CHAPTER IX.,our own stupidity in asking the question. Are such lofty souls ever
2143,CHAPTER IX.,appreciated by even one of the swarming masses that people the earth with
2144,CHAPTER IX.,their corporeal bodies? Let those answer who can.
2145,CHAPTER IX.,
2146,CHAPTER IX.,"But Louise, soaring as was her nature, was yet cursed with that weakness"
2147,CHAPTER IX.,"which too often possesses souls like hers, swaying e'en a more tyrant"
2148,CHAPTER IX.,"sceptre than in meaner breasts, as though in envious hate of those"
2149,CHAPTER IX.,"sky-aspiring pinions, and a demon wish to make them lick the dust. She"
2150,CHAPTER IX.,"was an orphan, with no relative save a maiden aunt, with whom she dwelt."
2151,CHAPTER IX.,"She felt alone in the wide world, and she wanted--O, pity her, reader, if"
2152,CHAPTER IX.,"you can!--she wanted somebody to lean on, somebody to look up to. Could"
2153,CHAPTER IX.,"she not lean on her own strong intellect, and look up to the stars?--or"
2154,CHAPTER IX.,could she not breathe forth her rich-laden soul in lofty song and
2155,CHAPTER IX.,"romance, and lean upon the pillars of a world-wide fame? No, O, no! With"
2156,CHAPTER IX.,"all her strength of soul and intellect, she had weak woman's heart. She"
2157,CHAPTER IX.,"must love and be loved; and when the wealthy Mr. Leroy Edson knelt, an"
2158,CHAPTER IX.,"enamored knight, at the shrine of her youth and beauty, she gave him her"
2159,CHAPTER IX.,"hand. He thought he had done a most generous deed in thus raising a poor,"
2160,CHAPTER IX.,lone orphan girl from comparative obscurity to a position among the
2161,CHAPTER IX.,highest circles of society. Her superior education and gem-freighted soul
2162,CHAPTER IX.,were all the fortune she brought him; a fortune greater than the
2163,CHAPTER IX.,"treasures of Ind., but of whose princely value he had not the power to"
2164,CHAPTER IX.,"form the most distant estimate. To behold her tall, graceful figure"
2165,CHAPTER IX.,"flitting through his elegant mansion, performing some light household"
2166,CHAPTER IX.,"duty, receiving her guests or chatting and singing gayly through the long"
2167,CHAPTER IX.,"evenings, was, to him, life's whole of happiness. And was Louise"
2168,CHAPTER IX.,"altogether content with the man of her choice? No, or she had not"
2169,CHAPTER IX.,gathered Wimbledon about her to make merry the midnight hour. People do
2170,CHAPTER IX.,not give fêtes to display their happiness. They give them too often to
2171,CHAPTER IX.,"relieve a tedious monotony, to silence a gnawing discontent, and forget"
2172,CHAPTER IX.,for the moment in hilarious excitement some uneasy foreboding of evil to
2173,CHAPTER IX.,"come, or disquieting conviction that all, even now, is not as it should"
2174,CHAPTER IX.,be.
2175,CHAPTER IX.,
2176,CHAPTER IX.,"Louise had not been many weeks Mrs. Edson, before she discovered the man"
2177,CHAPTER IX.,"she had taken for ""better or worse"" till death should separate them, was"
2178,CHAPTER IX.,no helpmeet for her. They had not a thought or sympathy in common. He
2179,CHAPTER IX.,"hired servants to execute her commands; bought her fine clothes, and fine"
2180,CHAPTER IX.,"books too, when he found these latter most delighted her; but he never"
2181,CHAPTER IX.,"wished to hear her read from them, and invariably yawned if she spoke of"
2182,CHAPTER IX.,"literary subjects. He was good-natured and fond of display, with a fair"
2183,CHAPTER IX.,estimate of his own importance and standing in society. He regarded
2184,CHAPTER IX.,himself as one of the pillars of Wimbledon's wealth and
2185,CHAPTER IX.,"prosperity;--remove him, and the whole structure would tremble and"
2186,CHAPTER IX.,perhaps go down with a crash to rise no more. It took but a brief time
2187,CHAPTER IX.,for Louise to read her husband's soul through and through; and with her
2188,CHAPTER IX.,"sharp, critical nature, that could not understand and would not overlook"
2189,CHAPTER IX.,"faults and follies to which her bosom was a stranger, she decided she had"
2190,CHAPTER IX.,_married a fool_. What was to be done? The act was voluntary on her
2191,CHAPTER IX.,"part. True, a longer acquaintance between the parties might have led to"
2192,CHAPTER IX.,"a different result, but it was too late to think of that now. And this"
2193,CHAPTER IX.,was the end of all her heart-longings for some one to love and
2194,CHAPTER IX.,"reverence, to lean on and look up to! O, how intense was her agony! All"
2195,CHAPTER IX.,"her fine feelings wasted, her soul's wealth poured idly forth, and her"
2196,CHAPTER IX.,rich life in its blooming years given to one who could not understand
2197,CHAPTER IX.,one of her lofty dreams or soaring aspirations. A falcon with sun-daring
2198,CHAPTER IX.,"eyes tied to a grovelling buzzard! Was't not a hard fate, reader? Pity"
2199,CHAPTER IX.,"her, all ye who can,--pity her a great deal; mourn over her cruel wreck"
2200,CHAPTER IX.,"of happiness; and if in future years the warm, impassioned nature,"
2201,CHAPTER IX.,"goaded by its own unuttered pangs, driven wild by its rayless, hopeless"
2202,CHAPTER IX.,"desolation, is guilty of some irregularities, some acts which virtue and"
2203,CHAPTER IX.,"propriety can hardly sanction, O, remember her early sufferings, and be"
2204,CHAPTER IX.,merciful!
2205,CHAPTER IX.,
2206,CHAPTER IX.,Mr. Edson's party passed off pleasantly. All seemed delighted with their
2207,CHAPTER IX.,"entertainment. The lord of the mansion was in great good-humor, and his"
2208,CHAPTER IX.,beautiful wife the star of the evening. In a simple robe of dark blue
2209,CHAPTER IX.,"cashmere, which fastened low over her white, sloping shoulders, and"
2210,CHAPTER IX.,"fitted closely her slender waist, while the ample folds swept the rich"
2211,CHAPTER IX.,"tapestry carpets, she moved among her guests like the embodiment of a"
2212,CHAPTER IX.,graceful thought. Her luxuriant brown hair was gathered in bands at the
2213,CHAPTER IX.,back of her head; a massive chain and cross of gold ornamented her
2214,CHAPTER IX.,"swan-like neck, and bands of the same material clasped her round, white"
2215,CHAPTER IX.,arms. Small wonder that Mr. Edson should feel proud of his wife. The
2216,CHAPTER IX.,whole evening she was the centre of a delighted group. All flocked around
2217,CHAPTER IX.,"to hear her brilliant conversation and gaze on her animated, expressive"
2218,CHAPTER IX.,features. Col. Malcome and the gentle Edith engaged a large share of her
2219,CHAPTER IX.,attention and regard. The young girl was insensibly attracted by the
2220,CHAPTER IX.,"affectionate interest evinced in her manner, and the sweet voice and"
2221,CHAPTER IX.,beaming smile with which she addressed her. Col. Malcome expressed his
2222,CHAPTER IX.,admiration of the exquisite taste displayed in the furnishing of her
2223,CHAPTER IX.,parlors.
2224,CHAPTER IX.,
2225,CHAPTER IX.,"""I cannot tell you, Mrs. Edson,"" said he, ""what I most admire in your"
2226,CHAPTER IX.,elegant drawing-rooms. They are one harmonious whole; but if you were
2227,CHAPTER IX.,"removed, I think I would very soon discover what was wanting to render"
2228,CHAPTER IX.,"them complete."""
2229,CHAPTER IX.,
2230,CHAPTER IX.,"""Now,"" said Louise, ""let me tell you at the commencement of our"
2231,CHAPTER IX.,"acquaintance, which I hope for my humble sake may continue to be"
2232,CHAPTER IX.,"cultivated, that I detest flattery of all things;"" and she turned a"
2233,CHAPTER IX.,"smiling glance on him, as these piquant words fell from her pretty, red"
2234,CHAPTER IX.,"lips, rendered more than usually charming by the slight sarcastic curl"
2235,CHAPTER IX.,she gave them.
2236,CHAPTER IX.,
2237,CHAPTER IX.,"""So do I,"" returned he; ""but truth is not flattery."""
2238,CHAPTER IX.,
2239,CHAPTER IX.,"""In the language of the poet,"" said she, laughing, ""I will not seek to"
2240,CHAPTER IX.,cope with you in compliment. Do you know I feel a lively interest in your
2241,CHAPTER IX.,"beautiful daughter?"""
2242,CHAPTER IX.,
2243,CHAPTER IX.,"""I am gratified to know it,"" said he, glancing on the bright creature at"
2244,CHAPTER IX.,"his side with an expressive glance. ""Edith is a timid little thing; she"
2245,CHAPTER IX.,would improve under your accomplished tuition. Not that I have the
2246,CHAPTER IX.,presumption to ask for her your care and instructions beyond what she
2247,CHAPTER IX.,"might receive by a neighborly interchange of visits."""
2248,CHAPTER IX.,
2249,CHAPTER IX.,"""O, say she may spend a portion of every week with me, when spring opens"
2250,CHAPTER IX.,"and the earth is divested of its garb of snow!"" said Louise, in a tone of"
2251,CHAPTER IX.,"affectionate eagerness. ""You cannot tell how her innocent gayety would"
2252,CHAPTER IX.,"lighten many of my weary hours."""
2253,CHAPTER IX.,
2254,CHAPTER IX.,"Col. Malcome started as he heard these words, and turned a searching"
2255,CHAPTER IX.,"glance upon her. A slight blush suffused her cheek for a moment, but she"
2256,CHAPTER IX.,soon regained her self-possession. It was one of her faults to give too
2257,CHAPTER IX.,"free, unrestrained expression to her thoughts. They came welling up to"
2258,CHAPTER IX.,"her lips, and escaped ere she was aware."
2259,CHAPTER IX.,
2260,CHAPTER IX.,"For several moments he continued to gaze on her, and there was something"
2261,CHAPTER IX.,in his countenance that instantly revealed to her quick eye that he had
2262,CHAPTER IX.,"not only believed in the weariness she had so thoughtlessly expressed,"
2263,CHAPTER IX.,but had also fathomed its cause. She felt displeased and irritated at her
2264,CHAPTER IX.,own want of caution and what she silently termed his presumption.
2265,CHAPTER IX.,
2266,CHAPTER IX.,"""Why do you look on me so strangely?"" she asked at length."
2267,CHAPTER IX.,
2268,CHAPTER IX.,"""I beg your pardon, madam,"" said he, suddenly averting his gaze."
2269,CHAPTER IX.,
2270,CHAPTER IX.,"""Which I shall not give,"" returned she, with a slight, dignified movement"
2271,CHAPTER IX.,"of her queenly head, ""unless you tell me what you think of me."""
2272,CHAPTER IX.,
2273,CHAPTER IX.,"""_All_ I think of you, Mrs. Edson,"" said he, turning his face again"
2274,CHAPTER IX.,"toward hers, ""perhaps would not please you to know."""
2275,CHAPTER IX.,
2276,CHAPTER IX.,"""Yes, all,"" said Louise, ""I will know all."""
2277,CHAPTER IX.,
2278,CHAPTER IX.,"""Well, this is not the time or place for the disclosure,"" answered he."
2279,CHAPTER IX.,
2280,CHAPTER IX.,She looked at him sharply as he pronounced these words. He smiled and
2281,CHAPTER IX.,"added, ""I should be monopolizing the time which belongs to your company."""
2282,CHAPTER IX.,
2283,CHAPTER IX.,"""Ay, yes!"" said she, ""your words recall the duty I owe to my"
2284,CHAPTER IX.,"condescending guests;"" and, bowing, she glided away and joined a company"
2285,CHAPTER IX.,that surrounded the piano.
2286,CHAPTER IX.,
2287,CHAPTER IX.,"""You play, of course, Mrs. Edson,"" said a portly man with a benevolent"
2288,CHAPTER IX.,countenance.
2289,CHAPTER IX.,
2290,CHAPTER IX.,"""Occasionally, though I have rather a dull ear,"" she answered, assuming"
2291,CHAPTER IX.,the music-stool. Several light songs were performed with fine taste and
2292,CHAPTER IX.,"skill, and received the warmest encomiums of her listeners. Another and"
2293,CHAPTER IX.,"another was called for, till at length she arose and said, ""There are"
2294,CHAPTER IX.,doubtless others here who play far better than myself. I have led the
2295,CHAPTER IX.,"way, let them follow."""
2296,CHAPTER IX.,
2297,CHAPTER IX.,"Col. Malcome arose from a sofa near by, on which he had thrown himself to"
2298,CHAPTER IX.,"listen to the fair musician, and assumed the seat she had vacated. A few"
2299,CHAPTER IX.,"prolonged notes, and then one of the most beautiful and intricate"
2300,CHAPTER IX.,"compositions of Beethoven, poured its sonorous strains on the ears of the"
2301,CHAPTER IX.,"assembly. The performer at length seemed to forget all around him, and at"
2302,CHAPTER IX.,"the end of the second chorus joined his own deep, rich tones with the"
2303,CHAPTER IX.,"instrument. All were delighted; but Louise, with her quick sensibilities,"
2304,CHAPTER IX.,was thrilled to the centre of her soul. And she felt piqued and angry
2305,CHAPTER IX.,"too; not that he had excelled her, for she was above such small envy,"
2306,CHAPTER IX.,but----she could not tell why.
2307,CHAPTER IX.,
2308,CHAPTER IX.,"The party dispersed, and she found herself again in the solitude of her"
2309,CHAPTER IX.,"own apartment. That swelling chorus rolled through her midnight dreams,"

2328,CHAPTER X.,"inasmuch as she was excluded from being one of the guests, availed"
2329,CHAPTER X.,"herself of the next choicest privilege, and learned, as far as she was"
2330,CHAPTER X.,"able, the dresses and conversation of those in attendance; and how Mrs."
2331,CHAPTER X.,"E. comported herself, and what she cooked for supper. She was shocked to"
2332,CHAPTER X.,"learn the young wife wore a low-necked dress, and set her down at once as"
2333,CHAPTER X.,"a low, vulgar woman, in whose company she should consider it a disgrace"

2340,CHAPTER X.,"gatherings; and, in fact, the colonel's was getting to be a familiar and"
2341,CHAPTER X.,welcome face at almost every door in the village. He even called on Mrs.
2342,CHAPTER X.,"Salsify Mumbles, one day, and addressed several civil speeches to the"
2343,CHAPTER X.,"interesting Mary Madeline, who blushed crimson beneath the glance of his"
2344,CHAPTER X.,"_unresistible_ eyes, as she termed them, and trembled like an aspen, in"
2345,CHAPTER X.,her red silk gown. We do not know that we have ever spoken of the
2346,CHAPTER X.,"personal charms of this blooming young lady, and we will now attempt a"
2347,CHAPTER X.,brief daguerreotype for the reader's enlightenment and edification.
2348,CHAPTER X.,
2349,CHAPTER X.,Her hair was of that peculiarly brilliant color noticed in that
2350,CHAPTER X.,"delightful esculent vegetable, the carrot, when boiled and prepared for"
2351,CHAPTER X.,"table. She wore it twisted in a hard, horny knob at the top of her head,"
2352,CHAPTER X.,"which strained her blue-green eyes, and gave them the expression of those"
2353,CHAPTER X.,of a choked grimalkin. Her nose turned divinely upwards; her blubber lips
2354,CHAPTER X.,"turned downwards with a grievous, watery expression. Her cheeks were red;"
2355,CHAPTER X.,"so was her nose; so were her eyes at times, when the horny knob took a"
2356,CHAPTER X.,"harder twist than usual. She had small, hairy ears, ornamented with"
2357,CHAPTER X.,"enormous jewels. Her neck was short, and three stubborn warts, of the"
2358,CHAPTER X.,"size of peas, stuck to its left side. Her waist might have been admired"
2359,CHAPTER X.,in the fifteenth century; but it was some nine inches too short by as
2360,CHAPTER X.,"many too broad, to elicit the admiration of the gallants of the present"
2361,CHAPTER X.,"age, who rave, and go distracted about gossamer divinities scarcely six"
2362,CHAPTER X.,"inches in circumference. She was about four feet four in stature, and her"
2363,CHAPTER X.,"foot would have crushed Cinderella, and used her slipper for a thumb-cot."
2364,CHAPTER X.,"Such was Mary Madeline Mumbles in her eighteenth year, and never was"
2365,CHAPTER X.,"child more like parent, than was this young lady like her doting,"
2366,CHAPTER X.,affectionate mamma.
2367,CHAPTER X.,
2368,CHAPTER X.,We have been at considerable trouble to sketch Miss Mumbles at full
2369,CHAPTER X.,"length, that the reader may be able to form a correct idea of her"
2370,CHAPTER X.,"appearance when she steps forth in full glory of silken bridal attire, on"
2371,CHAPTER X.,"the arm of Mr. Theophilus Shaw, the promising young shoe-cobbler, upon"
2372,CHAPTER X.,"whom Mr. Salsify had long since set his heart, as the proper man to"
2373,CHAPTER X.,"become his future son-in-law. And Miss Mary, who lost her passion for"
2374,CHAPTER X.,"Dick Giblet, after he shut the watch-dog in the kitchen-pantry,--a trick"
2375,CHAPTER X.,"which had nearly cost her the loss of a beloved mother,--and finding she"
2376,CHAPTER X.,could not captivate the handsome Colonel Malcome with checkered aprons
2377,CHAPTER X.,"and broad lace, began, like a dutiful child, to receive the advances of"
2378,CHAPTER X.,"the mild Theophilus more graciously, and had, after much maidenly"
2379,CHAPTER X.,"confusion, consented to become his wife, when, as we have seen, the"
2380,CHAPTER X.,"uncompromising colonel called, and distracted her with fear lest she had"
2381,CHAPTER X.,"been too precipitate in accepting Theophilus, when a higher prize might"
2382,CHAPTER X.,be on the point of falling into her arms. But her apprehensions were
2383,CHAPTER X.,"banished after a while, as the colonel did not appear a second time, and"
2384,CHAPTER X.,the marriage was finally consummated; and Mary Madeline Mumbles became in
2385,CHAPTER X.,due form Mrs. Theophilus Shaw. Jenny Andrews and Amy Seaton officiated as
2386,CHAPTER X.,"bridesmaids, and a large party were invited to make merry on the"
2387,CHAPTER X.,occasion.
2388,CHAPTER X.,
2389,CHAPTER X.,The bride's apparel was magnificent; so was the bridegroom's. We would
2390,CHAPTER X.,"attempt to describe it in detail, but dare not, knowing well we should"
2391,CHAPTER X.,fail to do it justice. Mrs. Salsify had the wicks of her parlor lamps
2392,CHAPTER X.,"full half an inch in length, and never seemed to notice how swiftly the"
2393,CHAPTER X.,"camphene was disappearing, so elate was she with the prospect of marrying"
2394,CHAPTER X.,her beautiful daughter.
2395,CHAPTER X.,
2396,CHAPTER X.,"The happy couple were to make a short bridal excursion, and then return"
2397,CHAPTER X.,and dwell under the bride's parental roof for the present; Mrs. Salsify
2398,CHAPTER X.,"having vacated her bed-room, which the young people were going to use for"
2399,CHAPTER X.,"kitchen, parlor, and shoemaker's shop. And a little pasteboard sign with"
2400,CHAPTER X.,"the words, ""Theophilus Shaw, Boot & Shoe Maker,"" scrawled on it with"
2401,CHAPTER X.,"lampblack, in an awkward, school-boy hand, was suspended by a string from"
2402,CHAPTER X.,the bed-room window.
2403,CHAPTER X.,
2404,CHAPTER X.,"""I am glad to have Mary Madeline settled in life,"" said Mrs. Mumbles,"
2405,CHAPTER X.,"after the arrangements were all complete; ""and the matter off my mind."""
2406,CHAPTER X.,
2407,CHAPTER X.,"""So am I,"" answered her husband; ""and I am glad she has made so good a"
2408,CHAPTER X.,"match, too. Mr. Shaw will make a much better husband than Dick Giblet, or"
2409,CHAPTER X.,"that black-headed Col. Malcome."""
2410,CHAPTER X.,
2411,CHAPTER X.,"""O, a better one than that scapegrace of a Dick, of course!"" said Mrs."
2412,CHAPTER X.,"Salsify, quickly; ""but as to a better one than the colonel, I don't know"
2413,CHAPTER X.,about that. The advantages of his position are very great. Maddie would
2414,CHAPTER X.,"have been the tip-top of Wimbledon if she had married him."""
2415,CHAPTER X.,
2416,CHAPTER X.,"""So she will be now, in time,"" returned Mr. S., confidently, ""for I am"

2437,CHAPTER XI.,forest that stretched away to the north of Wimbledon. The stars sparkled
2438,CHAPTER XI.,"with unwonted brilliancy over the clear blue firmament, as a quick step"
2439,CHAPTER XI.,"crackled along the narrow, icy path, and a dark form was seen hurrying"
2440,CHAPTER XI.,toward a faint light that gleamed dimly through a dense clump of cedars.
2441,CHAPTER XI.,"Then there was a sound as of bars withdrawn, and a bright, blazing hearth"
2442,CHAPTER XI.,"was revealed for a moment as the dark form entered, when all was hushed"
2443,CHAPTER XI.,"and silent again, save the dismal roar of the night wind through the"
2444,CHAPTER XI.,surrounding pines.
2445,CHAPTER XI.,
2446,CHAPTER XI.,"""You are late to-night, uncle,"" said a tall, dark-haired youth, as he"
2447,CHAPTER XI.,"undid the fastenings of the wanderer's long overcoat, and removed his"
2448,CHAPTER XI.,woollen mittens and wide-brimmed hat.
2449,CHAPTER XI.,
2450,CHAPTER XI.,"""What time do you conceive it to be?"" asked the man, depositing his long"
2451,CHAPTER XI.,"staff in a corner, and approaching the glowing fire."
2452,CHAPTER XI.,
2453,CHAPTER XI.,"""Past midnight, I would suppose,"" answered the boy, piling up a quantity"
2454,CHAPTER XI.,"of books that were scattered over a small table, and with which he had"
2455,CHAPTER XI.,been occupying himself through the long evening hours.
2456,CHAPTER XI.,
2457,CHAPTER XI.,"""O, not so late as that!"" returned the man, drawing a rude chair before"
2458,CHAPTER XI.,"the fire and extending his small, thin hands to the grateful blaze. ""The"
2459,CHAPTER XI.,village clock in the old church tower at Wimbledon was on the stroke of
2460,CHAPTER XI.,"ten when I laid my bundle of sticks in their accustomed place, and set my"
2461,CHAPTER XI.,"face homewards. I must have travelled at a laggard pace, if it is already"
2462,CHAPTER XI.,"midnight. Are you lonesome when I'm away, Edgar?"" inquired he, turning"
2463,CHAPTER XI.,"his deep, melancholy eyes on the fair, open countenance of the youth."
2464,CHAPTER XI.,
2465,CHAPTER XI.,"""Sometimes I am,"" returned he; ""I have been so to-night. A strange power"
2466,CHAPTER XI.,"seemed to possess my thoughts, to lead them through most hideous scenes,"
2467,CHAPTER XI.,"and dark, awful glooms and shadows enveloped my soul in mazes of doubt"
2468,CHAPTER XI.,"and fear."""
2469,CHAPTER XI.,
2470,CHAPTER XI.,"""What a nervous boy you are!"" said the man, ""come and sit beside me, and"
2471,CHAPTER XI.,I'll tell you of a project I've been revolving in my mind these several
2472,CHAPTER XI.,"days."" Edgar did as requested, and after a brief silence the hermit"
2473,CHAPTER XI.,commenced:
2474,CHAPTER XI.,
2475,CHAPTER XI.,"""These six months, my lad, you have dwelt in this little hut in the"
2476,CHAPTER XI.,"forest, holding intercourse with no human being save myself. It is not"
2477,CHAPTER XI.,right your boyhood and youth should pass in this manner. I have been
2478,CHAPTER XI.,"selfish in keeping you all to myself, to cheer my solitude. 'Twas your"
2479,CHAPTER XI.,parents' dying wish that you should receive all the advantages of
2480,CHAPTER XI.,"education and travel. Your life has been, for the most part, spent in the"
2481,CHAPTER XI.,"toil of study, and I knew you needed an interval of relaxation and"
2482,CHAPTER XI.,retirement to reïnvigorate your mental and physical energies. So I
2483,CHAPTER XI.,brought you to share the seclusion of my hermitage for a while. Grateful
2484,CHAPTER XI.,"as has been your presence to me, I should wrong you, and forfeit the"
2485,CHAPTER XI.,"promise given your parents on their deathbeds, if I encouraged or"
2486,CHAPTER XI.,permitted this retirement for a longer period than is necessary for your
2487,CHAPTER XI.,"restoration to health and vigor. You know I am your guardian, Edgar. The"
2488,CHAPTER XI.,fortune left for you by your father was entrusted to my care till you
2489,CHAPTER XI.,"should attain a suitable age to have it transferred to your own hands,"
2490,CHAPTER XI.,and ample provisions were made for your education and instruction in the
2491,CHAPTER XI.,"painter's art. Do you see what I am coming at, Edgar?"" he added, pausing"
2492,CHAPTER XI.,"in his discourse, and directing his gaze toward the boy, who sat"
2493,CHAPTER XI.,listening attentively to his uncle's words.
2494,CHAPTER XI.,
2495,CHAPTER XI.,"""No, Uncle Ralph,"" answered the lad; ""I don't know as I do, unless you"
2496,CHAPTER XI.,"are going to send me away from you to some distant school;"" and his voice"
2497,CHAPTER XI.,trembled as he spoke.
2498,CHAPTER XI.,
2499,CHAPTER XI.,"""Would you dislike to leave me, my boy?"" said the hermit, a tear dropping"
2500,CHAPTER XI.,from his melancholy eye.
2501,CHAPTER XI.,
2502,CHAPTER XI.,"""Ah, that would I!"" returned Edgar, ""for I have none to care for me in"
2503,CHAPTER XI.,"the wide world, save you."""
2504,CHAPTER XI.,
2505,CHAPTER XI.,"""Pshaw, pshaw, boy! don't prate in that way, with your bright, curly"
2506,CHAPTER XI.,"locks,"" said the man, laying his thin hand softly on the youth's light,"
2507,CHAPTER XI.,"clustering hair. ""When these locks are gray, and you have toiled and"
2508,CHAPTER XI.,"labored for fame and honors never gained, or that burned and furrowed the"
2509,CHAPTER XI.,brow that wore them; when you have engaged in the world's weary strife
2510,CHAPTER XI.,and sunk by the wayside worn and disheartened by the contest; when
2511,CHAPTER XI.,"friends have proved false;""--here the hermit's voice grew deeper and more"
2512,CHAPTER XI.,"vehement--""and when those who professed for you the fondest love turn"
2513,CHAPTER XI.,"coldly away to mock and scorn at your deep devotion, then, then, my boy,"
2514,CHAPTER XI.,"you will exclaim in bitterness, 'there are none to care for me!'"""
2515,CHAPTER XI.,
2516,CHAPTER XI.,"He paused, and bowed his face on his hands. Edgar longed to comfort him,"
2517,CHAPTER XI.,but knew not what to say.
2518,CHAPTER XI.,
2519,CHAPTER XI.,"The night wind roared solemnly without, the fire burned low on the rude"
2520,CHAPTER XI.,"hearth, and the little apartment, but illy protected from the searching"
2521,CHAPTER XI.,"blasts, grew chilly. Still the hermit sat silent, his bowed head resting"
2522,CHAPTER XI.,"between his small, attenuated hands. Edgar rose, brought the long"
2523,CHAPTER XI.,"overcoat and spread it over his shoulders, as a protection from the"
2524,CHAPTER XI.,"increasing cold. Then wrapping a blanket around his own light form, he"
2525,CHAPTER XI.,"stole softly to the window, and turned his gaze upward to the"
2526,CHAPTER XI.,star-lighted heaven. He dearly loved to sit thus through the hushed
2527,CHAPTER XI.,"midnight hours, and listen to the deep, heavy roaring of the mighty"
2528,CHAPTER XI.,"winds, as they swept through the surrounding forest, while his soul"
2529,CHAPTER XI.,"seemed borne away on their rushing currents, up and upward till her"
2530,CHAPTER XI.,pinions brushed the starry palaces of angels and beatified spirits; and
2531,CHAPTER XI.,"on, and on, with new splendors ever bursting on her ravished vision, till"
2532,CHAPTER XI.,the elysium of light in the high heaven of heavens poured its bewildering
2533,CHAPTER XI.,"glories upon her, and her weary wings fluttered to rest at last upon the"
2534,CHAPTER XI.,bosom of the All-Holy.
2535,CHAPTER XI.,
2536,CHAPTER XI.,"Edgar was possessed of a temperament of the most imaginative order,"
2537,CHAPTER XI.,"deeply imbued with lofty, poetic sentiment, and a tendency to reserve and"
2538,CHAPTER XI.,"melancholy. His father had been an artist, and the sunny skies of Italy"
2539,CHAPTER XI.,"cast their bright glory over his tender years, warming to impassioned"
2540,CHAPTER XI.,ardor the springs and fountains of his youthful bosom. Very few boys of
2541,CHAPTER XI.,his age and acquirements could have endured the seclusion in which he had
2542,CHAPTER XI.,dwelt for the last six months; but nothing could have been more consonant
2543,CHAPTER XI.,"with the reserved, romantic disposition of Edgar; and the prospect of"
2544,CHAPTER XI.,leaving the wild hut in the forest to go forth among the wide world's
2545,CHAPTER XI.,"jostling crowds, caused him heart-throbbing pangs."
2546,CHAPTER XI.,
2547,CHAPTER XI.,After a long silence the hermit roused himself. The room was cold and
2548,CHAPTER XI.,dark.
2549,CHAPTER XI.,
2550,CHAPTER XI.,"""Edgar?"" said he, in a low, broken voice."
2551,CHAPTER XI.,
2552,CHAPTER XI.,"""I am here,"" answered the youth, rising, and feeling his way through the"
2553,CHAPTER XI.,"darkness to his uncle's side, ""Won't you lie down now? The room is so"
2554,CHAPTER XI.,"cold, and there is no wood within to replenish the fire."""
2555,CHAPTER XI.,
2556,CHAPTER XI.,"""Yes, my boy, I will lie down,"" said the hermit, ""but not to sleep; the"
2557,CHAPTER XI.,"ghosts of past joys are with me to-night."""
2558,CHAPTER XI.,
2559,CHAPTER XI.,"""Drive them away, uncle!"" said the lad soothingly. ""I am not disposed to"
2560,CHAPTER XI.,"sleep either. Let us lie down and cover us warm, and then you tell me of"
2561,CHAPTER XI.,"your plans and projects for my future, as you had commenced to do a few"
2562,CHAPTER XI.,"hours ago."""
2563,CHAPTER XI.,
2564,CHAPTER XI.,"""No, Edgar, not to-night,"" answered the recluse. ""Your young eyes will"
2565,CHAPTER XI.,"wax heavy with these midnight vigils. You must sleep, my boy, and"
2566,CHAPTER XI.,"to-morrow I will communicate my plans concerning you."""
2567,CHAPTER XI.,
2568,CHAPTER XI.,"""As you say, uncle,"" returned Edgar, preparing to lie down."
2569,CHAPTER XI.,
2570,CHAPTER XI.,"Young, and happily ignorant of the cares and sorrows that distract the"
2571,CHAPTER XI.,"bosoms of maturer years, he was soon asleep."
2572,CHAPTER XI.,
2573,CHAPTER XI.,"The hermit moved to the window, and, after gazing forth some time in"
2574,CHAPTER XI.,"silence, murmured, ""Wild, wild is the night! Heaven send she does not"
2575,CHAPTER XI.,"suffer. I left two bundles on her lonely sill, though my fingers grew"
2576,CHAPTER XI.,stiff with cold ere I had gathered them. Thus do I feebly endeavor to
2577,CHAPTER XI.,"atone for past misconduct. How the wind roars through the pines! O, what"
2578,CHAPTER XI.,memories of long ago rush o'er my soul! I think of Mary as the time
2579,CHAPTER XI.,approaches when she will be near me. Shall I see her face again? God
2580,CHAPTER XI.,"forbid!"" exclaimed he, stamping his foot violently upon the stone floor."
2581,CHAPTER XI.,"After a while he resumed his low soliloquy. ""I fear for Edgar,"" he said,"
2582,CHAPTER XI.,"""lest the cold world chill his heart and undo his usefulness, as it has"
2583,CHAPTER XI.,"mine. He has my temperament, reserved, sensitive, and with the same"
2584,CHAPTER XI.,"accursed capacity for strong, undying attachment. What a fair prospect of"
2585,CHAPTER XI.,fame had I! What honors were ready to crown me when that monster came and
2586,CHAPTER XI.,blasted them all! Such do I fear will be Edgar's fate. But he must go
2587,CHAPTER XI.,forth into the world; such was the wish of his parents. I can keep him
2588,CHAPTER XI.,"near me a few months longer by sending him to the Wimbledon seminary, ere"
2589,CHAPTER XI.,he must depart for some distant university or school of art. Then the
2590,CHAPTER XI.,"great world will have opened before him, and I shall see him no more."""
2591,CHAPTER XI.,The hermit suddenly ceased. Tears choked his utterance.
2592,CHAPTER XI.,
2593,CHAPTER XI.,"""Uncle!"" said Edgar, starting quickly from his slumbers, ""will you not"
2594,CHAPTER XI.,"come and lie down?"""
2595,CHAPTER XI.,
2596,CHAPTER XI.,"""Yes, my boy,"" answered the sorrowing man, approaching the rude couch."
2597,CHAPTER XI.,
2598,CHAPTER XI.,"The wintry winds wailed on with piteous, mournful voices; but the"

2660,OLD PLAY.,"kitchen, where Mr. Pimble sits in his dressing-gown and sheepskin"
2661,OLD PLAY.,"slippers, shivering over an expiring fire. He lifts his head, as the"
2662,OLD PLAY.,bustling housekeeper begins to rattle the covers of the stove for the

2677,OLD PLAY.,
2678,OLD PLAY.,Beside the bed of her sick boy stood Mrs. Pimble. She laid her hand on
2679,OLD PLAY.,"his forehead. It burned with fever, and his pulse was quick and hard. She"
2680,OLD PLAY.,"was not much skilled in the ""art medical,"" but she resolved to do"
2681,OLD PLAY.,"_something_ for her child, and forthwith proceeded to the kitchen and"
2682,OLD PLAY.,compounded a dish of catnip leaves and ginger. It exhaled a savory
2683,OLD PLAY.,"smell, and she felt quite confident it would cool off Garrison's fever."
2684,OLD PLAY.,"Placing a large bowl of the liquid by his bed-side, she bade him drink"
2685,OLD PLAY.,"freely of it through the evening, while she was gone to the Reform Club,"
2686,OLD PLAY.,and when she came home she would call at Sister Simcoe's and obtain a
2687,OLD PLAY.,prescription for him. The sick lad promised to do as she requested. His
2688,OLD PLAY.,"fever inclined him to drink incessantly, and ere his mother was ten"
2689,OLD PLAY.,"yards from the house, he had guzzled the whole brimming bowlful. And"
2690,OLD PLAY.,"still he called for drink, drink; which his insensate father carried to"
2691,OLD PLAY.,him in copious quantities as often as he desired it.
2692,OLD PLAY.,
2693,OLD PLAY.,Mrs. Pimble proceeded on her way to the club room. For some reason there
2694,OLD PLAY.,"was but a thin attendance. None of the prominent members were present,"
2695,OLD PLAY.,and the little company decided to adjourn. Mrs. Pimble hurried round to
2696,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Simcoe's, to learn the cause of her absence and get the prescription"
2697,OLD PLAY.,for Garrison. The lady-doctor had been lecturing for several months in
2698,OLD PLAY.,"different towns of the county, and was but recently returned."
2699,OLD PLAY.,
2700,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Pimble entered without knocking, as was her wont, and walked into"
2701,OLD PLAY.,"the young doctor's office, where she beheld, not the fair, feminine face"
2702,OLD PLAY.,"of the rightful proprietor, but the ugly, rhubarb-colored visage of the"
2703,OLD PLAY.,"village apothecary, Dr. Potipher, ensconced in the high-backed cushioned"

2705,OLD PLAY.,
2706,OLD PLAY.,"She turned back and opened the sitting-room door, and there stood Mr."
2707,OLD PLAY.,"Simcoe before a bed, holding a tea-tray, containing several vials and"
2708,OLD PLAY.,glasses. Mrs. Pimble started on seeing the night-capped head of Mrs.
2709,OLD PLAY.,"Simcoe raised feebly from the pillow, and darting forward, exclaimed,"
2710,OLD PLAY.,"""Mercy, Sister Simcoe! what has befallen you?"""
2711,OLD PLAY.,
2712,OLD PLAY.,"A smothered wail from beneath the bed-clothes now met her ear, and,"
2713,OLD PLAY.,"turning down the blankets, she discovered two red-faced, bald-headed"
2714,OLD PLAY.,"babies, wrapped in swaddling-clothes. She started back aghast."
2715,OLD PLAY.,
2716,OLD PLAY.,"""What are those things--what are those things?"" she demanded,"
2717,OLD PLAY.,"hysterically, pointing to the infant strangers."
2718,OLD PLAY.,
2719,OLD PLAY.,"""Simcoe's children!"" groaned the pale lady-doctor, turning uneasily away"
2720,OLD PLAY.,"from the little things that lay squirming and making such grimaces, as"
2721,OLD PLAY.,"only very young babies _can_ make, in the face of Mrs. Pimble. The"
2722,OLD PLAY.,"alleged father stood there, chuckling over the smartness of his progeny."
2723,OLD PLAY.,"Mrs. Pimble darted one withering glance upon him, and walked away"
2724,OLD PLAY.,"without another word. She roused old Dr. Potipher, and took him home"
2725,OLD PLAY.,"with her. Well she did so, for Garrison was much worse than when she"
2726,OLD PLAY.,"left him, and the doctor pronounced it a case of brain fever, which"
2727,OLD PLAY.,would require the nicest care and nursing.

2794,CHAPTER XIII.,
2795,CHAPTER XIII.,"""You smooth the way very well, my little daughter,"" said he, patting her"
2796,CHAPTER XIII.,"rosy cheek; ""but I incline to think you had better continue your studies"
2797,CHAPTER XIII.,"in the old way."""
2798,CHAPTER XIII.,
2799,CHAPTER XIII.,"Florence looked disappointed, and turned slowly from his side. Her"
2800,CHAPTER XIII.,"dejected appearance touched his affectionate heart, and he called her"
2801,CHAPTER XIII.,"back. She came bounding toward him, with new hope dancing in her dark"
2802,CHAPTER XIII.,liquid eyes.
2803,CHAPTER XIII.,
2804,CHAPTER XIII.,"""If you can obtain your mother's consent,"" said he, ""I will not object to"
2805,CHAPTER XIII.,"your attending school at the seminary one term, as you seem so much to"
2806,CHAPTER XIII.,"desire it."""
2807,CHAPTER XIII.,
2808,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, thank you, thank you, dear father!"" exclaimed the glad girl, putting"
2809,CHAPTER XIII.,"her arms round his neck, and giving him a grateful kiss on either cheek,"
2810,CHAPTER XIII.,"""and may I commence to-morrow? that is, if mamma consents to my going?"""
2811,CHAPTER XIII.,
2812,CHAPTER XIII.,"""To-morrow?"" said he, ""had you not better wait, as this term is so far"
2813,CHAPTER XIII.,"advanced, and commence with a new one?"""
2814,CHAPTER XIII.,
2815,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, no!"" returned she, ""I should rather begin at once."""
2816,CHAPTER XIII.,
2817,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Well, go in, little Miss Rattle, and see what your sage mamma says on"
2818,CHAPTER XIII.,"the subject,"" said her father, smiling at her earnest countenance."
2819,CHAPTER XIII.,
2820,CHAPTER XIII.,"Away went Florence, with the lightness of a bird up the hall stairs, and,"
2821,CHAPTER XIII.,"giving a light tap at a closed door, stood dancing softly on tip-toe, as"
2822,CHAPTER XIII.,"she waited a summons to enter. ""Who's there?"" asked a low, trembling"
2823,CHAPTER XIII.,voice at length.
2824,CHAPTER XIII.,
2825,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Me, mamma,"" answered Florence; ""may I come in? I've something to ask"
2826,CHAPTER XIII.,"you."""
2827,CHAPTER XIII.,
2828,CHAPTER XIII.,"The door was opened by a short, thin woman, of dark complexion, small"
2829,CHAPTER XIII.,"peering black eyes, and slick, shining hair of the same hue, which was"
2830,CHAPTER XIII.,arranged with an air of nicety and precision.
2831,CHAPTER XIII.,
2832,CHAPTER XIII.,Florence entered and glanced with an expression of alarm toward the drawn
2833,CHAPTER XIII.,"curtains of a mahogany bedstead. ""Is mother worse?"" she asked in a voice"
2834,CHAPTER XIII.,but a breath above a whisper.
2835,CHAPTER XIII.,
2836,CHAPTER XIII.,"""She has had one of her bleeding spells,"" answered the small, dark woman."
2837,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Where is your father?"""
2838,CHAPTER XIII.,
2839,CHAPTER XIII.,"""On the lower terrace; shall I call him?"""
2840,CHAPTER XIII.,
2841,CHAPTER XIII.,"""No, I will go to him,"" returned the woman, ""if you will remain by your"
2842,CHAPTER XIII.,"mother a while."""
2843,CHAPTER XIII.,
2844,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, yes, I shall be delighted to stay!"" said Florence, approaching the"
2845,CHAPTER XIII.,couch.
2846,CHAPTER XIII.,
2847,CHAPTER XIII.,"""You must not talk to her,"" remarked the woman; ""she needs to be very"
2848,CHAPTER XIII.,"quiet."""
2849,CHAPTER XIII.,
2850,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I won't speak a word unless she asks me to,"" answered the young girl,"
2851,CHAPTER XIII.,"sitting down by the bed-side, as the dark woman disappeared, closing the"
2852,CHAPTER XIII.,door softly behind her.
2853,CHAPTER XIII.,
2854,CHAPTER XIII.,After a few moments' silence the sick woman stirred and parted the
2855,CHAPTER XIII.,"curtains slightly with her wan hand. Florence rose. ""Do you want"
2856,CHAPTER XIII.,"anything, mother?"" she asked."
2857,CHAPTER XIII.,
2858,CHAPTER XIII.,"""No, my dear, I have been asleep. Where is Hannah?"""
2859,CHAPTER XIII.,
2860,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Gone below. I think to send father for Dr. Potipher."""
2861,CHAPTER XIII.,
2862,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I hope not,"" said the invalid; ""it is not necessary. This is only one of"
2863,CHAPTER XIII.,"my common attacks. I shall be as well as usual in a few days."""
2864,CHAPTER XIII.,
2865,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Do you think so, mother?"" asked Florence, brightening. ""I feared you"
2866,CHAPTER XIII.,"were very ill. I had something particular to say, but I was not going to"
2867,CHAPTER XIII.,"say it, for fear of hurting you."""
2868,CHAPTER XIII.,
2869,CHAPTER XIII.,"""What is it, dear?"" inquired the mother."
2870,CHAPTER XIII.,
2871,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Something papa and I have been talking about down on the piazza"
2872,CHAPTER XIII.,"to-night."""
2873,CHAPTER XIII.,
2874,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Well,"" said the sick woman, looking affectionately on the earnest"
2875,CHAPTER XIII.,expression and downcast lids of Florence's large hazel eyes.
2876,CHAPTER XIII.,
2877,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I asked him to let me go to the seminary this term, and he said if you"
2878,CHAPTER XIII.,"had no objection I might do so,"" said the hesitating girl, at length,"
2879,CHAPTER XIII.,"with a long-drawn breath, as though she had relieved her bosom of a heavy"
2880,CHAPTER XIII.,burden.
2881,CHAPTER XIII.,
2882,CHAPTER XIII.,"The pale lady was silent a few moments, as if revolving the matter in her"
2883,CHAPTER XIII.,"mind. Then she spoke suddenly. ""You said your father had no objection?"""
2884,CHAPTER XIII.,
2885,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Yes,"" answered Florence."
2886,CHAPTER XIII.,
2887,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Then, of course, I have none,"" said the woman, turning over on her"
2888,CHAPTER XIII.,pillow and settling herself as if to sleep again.
2889,CHAPTER XIII.,
2890,CHAPTER XIII.,Florence was about to pour forth her gratitude for the favor shown her
2891,CHAPTER XIII.,"request, when the dark-browed woman entered, shook her finger at her, and"
2892,CHAPTER XIII.,bade her go below. Florence's eyes flashed back her answer.
2893,CHAPTER XIII.,
2894,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I'll go at my mother's request, not otherwise,"" said she."
2895,CHAPTER XIII.,
2896,CHAPTER XIII.,"A dark frown gathered on the woman's features, and the invalid said"
2897,CHAPTER XIII.,"tremblingly, ""I would like to sleep; perhaps you had better go and stay"
2898,CHAPTER XIII.,"with your father a while, my dear."""
2899,CHAPTER XIII.,
2900,CHAPTER XIII.,"Florence kissed the pale brow, and then moved toward the door with"
2901,CHAPTER XIII.,"noiseless tread. The dark woman cast a glance of angry triumph upon her,"
2902,CHAPTER XIII.,which was returned by one of fearless defiance.
2903,CHAPTER XIII.,
2904,CHAPTER XIII.,"Since Florence's earliest recollection her mother had been an invalid,"
2905,CHAPTER XIII.,"shunning society and subject to long fits of depression, and, upon the"
2906,CHAPTER XIII.,"slightest excitement, to severe attacks of palpitation and bleeding from"
2907,CHAPTER XIII.,"the chest, which frequently prostrated her on a bed of suffering for"
2908,CHAPTER XIII.,"weeks. Hannah Doliver had always been her attendant, though Florence, in"
2909,CHAPTER XIII.,"the simplicity of her young heart, often wondered that her parents should"
2910,CHAPTER XIII.,"retain her in their service; for she was a bold, impudent,"
2911,CHAPTER XIII.,"violent-tempered woman, who set up her will for law in the household, and"
2912,CHAPTER XIII.,"seemed to exercise an almost tyrannic sway over the weak invalid, who"
2913,CHAPTER XIII.,appeared to stand in awe of her slightest nod. She showed a marked
2914,CHAPTER XIII.,"dislike for Florence, and delighted in tantalizing her, when she was a"
2915,CHAPTER XIII.,"little child, and thwarting her wishes. As the fair girl grew older, she"
2916,CHAPTER XIII.,"resolved the arbitrary woman should not govern or intimidate her, and met"
2917,CHAPTER XIII.,"all her attempts at petty tyranny with a bold, undaunted spirit, which"
2918,CHAPTER XIII.,seemed to increase the woman's hatred. Florence once asked her father why
2919,CHAPTER XIII.,he did not send Hannah Doliver away.
2920,CHAPTER XIII.,
2921,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Your mother could not do without her, my child,"" said he."
2922,CHAPTER XIII.,
2923,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I think she could do better without her than with her,"" returned"
2924,CHAPTER XIII.,"Florence, ""for she is cross to mamma, and makes her do everything just as"
2925,CHAPTER XIII.,"she says."""
2926,CHAPTER XIII.,
2927,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, no, I guess not,"" said her father."
2928,CHAPTER XIII.,
2929,CHAPTER XIII.,"""But she does,"" persisted Florence, ""and I would not have her in the"
2930,CHAPTER XIII.,"house."" Major Howard patted his little daughter's cheek and said, ""When"
2931,CHAPTER XIII.,"you are older, Florence, you will understand a great many things that"
2932,CHAPTER XIII.,"seem dark and mysterious to you now."""
2933,CHAPTER XIII.,
2934,CHAPTER XIII.,"Florence was not satisfied, but she turned away, and never mentioned the"
2935,CHAPTER XIII.,subject to her father again.
2936,CHAPTER XIII.,
2937,CHAPTER XIII.,"Early the next morning the glad-hearted girl was astir, getting in"
2938,CHAPTER XIII.,readiness for school. She gathered her books together and placed them in
2939,CHAPTER XIII.,"a satchel of crimson broadcloth, which she had just embroidered, with"
2940,CHAPTER XIII.,"bright German wools, in wreaths of spotted daisies and wild columbines."
2941,CHAPTER XIII.,"Then donning a blue muslin frock, dotted over with small silver stars,"
2942,CHAPTER XIII.,"and tying on a black silk apron with open velvet pockets, from one of"
2943,CHAPTER XIII.,"which peeped a snowy lace-edged handkerchief, she took satchel, gloves"
2944,CHAPTER XIII.,"and gypsy hat, and descended to the parlor, ensconcing herself in a nook"
2945,CHAPTER XIII.,"of the north window, where she stood gazing over the hill-tops toward the"
2946,CHAPTER XIII.,distant forest with eager eyes to behold the fair-haired boy emerge from
2947,CHAPTER XIII.,its recesses.
2948,CHAPTER XIII.,
2949,CHAPTER XIII.,"At length he appeared, and she watched him till he was descending the"
2950,CHAPTER XIII.,"hill which sloped past her father's mansion. Then, hastily tying on her"
2951,CHAPTER XIII.,"hat and seizing her satchel, she was hurrying through the hall to gain"
2952,CHAPTER XIII.,"the street, when she encountered Hannah Doliver."
2953,CHAPTER XIII.,
2954,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Where are you going?"" demanded she in a sharp tone."
2955,CHAPTER XIII.,
2956,CHAPTER XIII.,"""To school,"" answered Florence, rushing past her."
2957,CHAPTER XIII.,
2958,CHAPTER XIII.,"""By whose leave, I wonder?"" said the woman, running after her, to drag"
2959,CHAPTER XIII.,"her back. But the nimble-footed girl was too swift for her, and she"
2960,CHAPTER XIII.,"returned to the house muttering angrily to herself. Meantime, Florence"
2961,CHAPTER XIII.,"bounded over the gravelled walks, and was emerging from the gateway just"
2962,CHAPTER XIII.,"as the lad, in the morocco cap, was passing by. He arrested his steps on"
2963,CHAPTER XIII.,"beholding her, and bowed gracefully. She returned his salute, and said,"
2964,CHAPTER XIII.,"blushingly, ""I am going to school up to the seminary. May I walk with"
2965,CHAPTER XIII.,"you?"""
2966,CHAPTER XIII.,
2967,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Certainly, Miss Howard,"" answered he; ""I shall be grateful for your"
2968,CHAPTER XIII.,"company."""

2992,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"There was a neat, little vine-covered cottage standing a few doors"
2993,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"removed from the elegant mansion of Leroy Edson, and in it dwelt Mrs."
2994,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"Stanhope, a widow lady and her maiden sister, Miss Martha Pinkerton,"
2995,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"a female of uncertain age, as authors say, and possessed of the"
2996,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"peculiarities common to persons of her class. They were not poor, nor"
2997,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"were they rich, but made a good living, as the world goes, by taking in"
2998,ALEXANDER SMITH.,needlework. Young Mrs. Edson frequently dropped in to pass an hour in
2999,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"social converse with Mrs. Stanhope, who was a pleasant, agreeable woman."
3000,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"Miss Martha, too, always wore a smile on her sharp-featured face when"
3001,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"the lovely young wife appeared at the cottage. As they were simple,"
3002,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"unostentatious people, living in a retired and quiet way, she laid aside"
3003,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"all form and ceremony, and was accustomed to run in at any hour, in"
3004,ALEXANDER SMITH.,whatever garb she chanced to be.
3005,ALEXANDER SMITH.,
3006,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"On a bright May morning, as the ladies had made all things tidy, and were"
3007,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"seating themselves to their daily avocation of the needle, they heard"

3009,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"white sun-bonnet and spotted muslin dressing-gown, open from the waist"
3010,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"downwards, revealing a fine cambric skirt, wrought in several rows of"
3011,ALEXANDER SMITH.,vines and deep scolloped edges. Mrs. Stanhope met her visitor on the

3013,ALEXANDER SMITH.,
3014,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""Good-morning,"" said she, extending her hand; ""I am happy to see"

3022,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"holding the good woman by one hand, while she extended the other to"
3023,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"Miss Pinkerton, who rose from her work to receive her, and drew an"
3024,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"old-fashioned, straight-backed rocking-chair, cushioned and lined with"
3025,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"gay copperplate, up before the window for her comfort. ""I must not sit"
3026,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"long,"" said Louise, assuming the proffered seat, ""for I have left my"
3027,ALEXANDER SMITH.,house quite alone; the servants having gone out on errands for

3029,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"birds sang so sweetly, the sun was so bright, and everything seemed to"
3030,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"say, up and away. So I donned my sun-bonnet and ran over here as the"
3031,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"nicest, quietest little nook I could fly to; and where I should be as"

3049,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"heard at the inner door, and Col. Malcome stepped in, bowing gracefully,"
3050,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"with a pleasant ""Good-morning"" to the three ladies. Mrs. Stanhope rose"
3051,ALEXANDER SMITH.,and offered him a chair. Depositing a large package he held in his arms
3052,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"on a corner of the sofa, he sat down."

3054,ALEXANDER SMITH.,Mrs. Edson blushed. She thought it was at being caught from home in

3079,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""It would be well for you to remember it,"" said Louise, with a dignified"
3080,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"curve of her graceful neck, and slight addition of color, which very much"

3082,ALEXANDER SMITH.,
3083,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""Mrs. Edson is so youthful in appearance,"" remarked Mrs. Stanhope, ""I"
3084,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"think she might excuse one for forgetting she is a matron."""
3085,ALEXANDER SMITH.,
3086,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""I'll excuse you, Mrs. Stanhope,"" said Louise, rising; ""I don't want to"

3093,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"There was a silence of several minutes after she left, during which Col."

3120,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""No,"" said he, suddenly assuming an appearance of composure; ""that is, I"

3123,ALEXANDER SMITH.,
3124,ALEXANDER SMITH.,"""A great many years, I believe,"" answered Martha. ""People hereabouts"

3281,L. E. L.,retiring Edith.
3282,L. E. L.,
3283,L. E. L.,"Col. Malcome paid her many courteous attentions during her visit, and"

3292,L. E. L.,"""while your father's mansion is so distant, that it will be very"

3296,L. E. L.,
3297,L. E. L.,"Florence thanked him for his kindness, kissed Edith, and descended to"
3298,L. E. L.,the street in company with Rufus.
3299,L. E. L.,
3300,L. E. L.,Col. Malcome approached the window and regarded the couple earnestly
3301,L. E. L.,"till they passed beyond his view, while strange, dark, commingled"
3302,L. E. L.,"expressions passed over his face. Edith crept up to him and said softly,"
3303,L. E. L.,"""What troubles you, father?"""
3304,L. E. L.,
3305,L. E. L.,"He looked down sternly on her sweet, upturned face, and said in a tone"
3306,L. E. L.,of strong command:
3307,L. E. L.,
3308,L. E. L.,"""Edith, I desire you to cultivate the acquaintance of Florence Howard by"
3309,L. E. L.,"every means in your power."""
3310,L. E. L.,
3311,L. E. L.,"""I shall be glad to do so, father,"" answered she, with a look and tone"
3312,L. E. L.,which deprecated his sternness.
3313,L. E. L.,
3314,L. E. L.,"""'Tis well, then,"" said he, relaxing his brow and imprinting a kiss on"
3315,L. E. L.,her soft cheek as he turned away and stepped forth upon the piazza. The
3316,L. E. L.,full moon was just rising in the east; the river rippled sweetly in the
3317,L. E. L.,"distance, and the whippoorwills piped their sharp, shrill notes on the"
3318,L. E. L.,"hushed evening air. Suddenly he heard the garden-gate unclose, and,"
3319,L. E. L.,"turning, beheld Mrs. Edson and her husband approaching. Descending the"
3320,L. E. L.,"marble steps, he met them in the avenue, and, after a cordial"
3321,L. E. L.,"interchange of salutations, ushered them into the gas-lighted"
3322,L. E. L.,"drawing-room, where Edith, in a gossamer-like muslin, reclined on a"
3323,L. E. L.,velvet ottoman.
3324,L. E. L.,
3325,L. E. L.,"The evening passed pleasantly to all but Mr. Edson, who sat like a"
3326,L. E. L.,"pantomime in a play, staring and grinning at what he could not"

3328,L. E. L.,"pleasure in placing his guest in the most awkward positions, and showing"
3329,L. E. L.,off his own superior grace and polish to the best advantage. If
3330,L. E. L.,"anything, he rather overdone. But perhaps he thought with Mrs. Salsify"
3331,L. E. L.,"Mumbles in this case, ""Better overshoot than fall short."" Louise was"
3332,L. E. L.,graceful and self-possessed as usual; and it must be confessed did not
3333,L. E. L.,appear very much disconcerted when Col. M. showed her husband in some
3334,L. E. L.,"ridiculous light, or mercilessly uncurtained his crude, narrow-minded"

3356,CHAPTER XVI.,"which, he seemed intently occupied. His appearance was melancholy in the"
3357,CHAPTER XVI.,"extreme. A pale, thin face;--deep sunken eyes, and a broad, high brow,"
3358,CHAPTER XVI.,by sorrow seamed with furrows long and wide; for she doth ever dig with
3359,CHAPTER XVI.,"deeper, harsher hand than time. A loose linen garment was wrapped around"

3414,CHAPTER XVI.,"the turf, and gaze with amazement upon the fierce workings of a face he"
3415,CHAPTER XVI.,had never seen flushed by an angry emotion before. He feared his uncle
3416,CHAPTER XVI.,"had suddenly gone mad, and stood indeterminate what course to pursue,"
3417,CHAPTER XVI.,"when the countenance before him changed, the eyes closed, and the hermit"
3418,CHAPTER XVI.,"fell heavily on the green sward in front of his door. Edgar, in his"
3419,CHAPTER XVI.,"alarm, lifted the prostrate form in his strong, young arms, and bore him"
3420,CHAPTER XVI.,"to the low, rough couch, which was their nightly resting-place. Then,"
3421,CHAPTER XVI.,"taking a bottle from a [illegible] shelf above the huge, black"
3422,CHAPTER XVI.,"fire-place, he poured its contents in a cup, and bathed the temples of"
3423,CHAPTER XVI.,"the deathly-looking face till the eyes opened with recognition, and the"
3424,CHAPTER XVI.,"lips moved, though inaudibly."
3425,CHAPTER XVI.,
3426,CHAPTER XVI.,"He watched by the bed-side several hours, and at length the hermit rose"
3427,CHAPTER XVI.,"suddenly to his feet, and bade Edgar retire. He obeyed, and closed his"
3428,CHAPTER XVI.,"eyes, but not to sleep. Opening them after a while, he beheld his uncle"
3429,CHAPTER XVI.,"sitting before the table engaged in writing. Again the lids closed, and"
3430,CHAPTER XVI.,"he fell into a light drowse, during which Florence Howard flitted before"
3431,CHAPTER XVI.,him in countless variety of forms. When again he looked around he was
3432,CHAPTER XVI.,"alone. The long summer twilight had deepened into evening, and Edgar"
3433,CHAPTER XVI.,"rose and lighted a lamp. On the table he discovered a small, folded"
3434,CHAPTER XVI.,"billet, addressed to him. He sank on his knees, opened it, and read."
3435,CHAPTER XVI.,Various were the expressions that flitted over his features as he did
3436,CHAPTER XVI.,"so. When he had finished he refolded it carefully, and, drawing a bunch"
3437,CHAPTER XVI.,"of keys from his pocket, unlocked a small box which sat on the table,"
3438,CHAPTER XVI.,"placed the letter within, then relocked it and returned the keys to his"

3473,PHEBE CAREY.,The yearly examination and exhibition of Cedar Hill Seminary was
3474,PHEBE CAREY.,"approaching, and teachers and pupils were busied with preparations in"
3475,PHEBE CAREY.,order to pass the ordeal creditably to themselves and to the
3476,PHEBE CAREY.,institution.
3477,PHEBE CAREY.,
3478,PHEBE CAREY.,Prominent among the list of performers stood the name of Edgar
3479,PHEBE CAREY.,"Lindenwood, often in juxtaposition with that of Florence Howard. Since"
3480,PHEBE CAREY.,"the scene in the hermit's hut, Edgar, as commanded by his uncle, had"
3481,PHEBE CAREY.,"studiously avoided Florence, and she, for a still longer period, had"
3482,PHEBE CAREY.,evinced a certain distance and reserve toward him. Edgar's knowledge of
3483,PHEBE CAREY.,"her father's dislike might be sufficient cause to part him from her, but"
3484,PHEBE CAREY.,it could by no means justify his growing intercourse with Edith Malcome.
3485,PHEBE CAREY.,
3486,PHEBE CAREY.,"As the time approached for the exhibition, Florence asked her father's"
3487,PHEBE CAREY.,permission to absent herself entirely and remain at home. Maj. Howard
3488,PHEBE CAREY.,"thought she had better attend, as she had been to school several terms;"
3489,PHEBE CAREY.,"but she said she felt too languid to take part in the exercises, and"
3490,PHEBE CAREY.,thus obtained the excuse of her indulgent father.
3491,PHEBE CAREY.,
3492,PHEBE CAREY.,"Edgar's quick, impassioned nature regarded her absence as a direct"
3493,PHEBE CAREY.,"insult to himself, for in all the parts assigned her, she would be"
3494,PHEBE CAREY.,"brought on the stage in company with him, and frequently obliged to hold"
3495,PHEBE CAREY.,single converse. If this opinion needed further confirmation it was
3496,PHEBE CAREY.,"added, when she appeared at the Scholars' Levee, held on the evening of"
3497,PHEBE CAREY.,"the exhibition, in elegant dress and dashing spirits, with Rufus Malcome"
3498,PHEBE CAREY.,for a partner.
3499,PHEBE CAREY.,
3500,PHEBE CAREY.,They passed each other in the dance without a token of recognition.
3501,PHEBE CAREY.,Edgar attached himself to Edith for the larger part of the evening.
3502,PHEBE CAREY.,After the first two or three cotillons he did not care to join them; and
3503,PHEBE CAREY.,"Edith, being too delicate to bear the excitement, they roamed through"
3504,PHEBE CAREY.,"the hall, conversing together of the events of the exhibition, or"
3505,PHEBE CAREY.,mingling among groups of the village people who had assembled by
3506,PHEBE CAREY.,invitation to partake in the festive scene.
3507,PHEBE CAREY.,
3508,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Ha, my little fairy!"" whispered Mrs. Edson in the ear of Edith, as she"
3509,PHEBE CAREY.,"was sauntering past on the arm of Lindenwood, unmindful of her friend's"

3517,PHEBE CAREY.,"remarked, tears welling up to her beautiful eyes, which she dashed"
3518,PHEBE CAREY.,"hurriedly away, exclaiming, ""but I must not begin to prose about myself"
3519,PHEBE CAREY.,"when I was young, lest I drive you all away by my tedious recitals."""
3520,PHEBE CAREY.,
3521,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Mr. Lindenwood,"" said she, turning to Edgar, ""though we have never met"
3522,PHEBE CAREY.,"before, your vivid personations on the stage to-day have caused you to"
3523,PHEBE CAREY.,"seem more like an old friend than a comparative stranger."""
3524,PHEBE CAREY.,
3525,PHEBE CAREY.,Edgar expressed his pleasure that his poor performances had met her
3526,PHEBE CAREY.,"approbation, and also that she condescended to recognize him as a"
3527,PHEBE CAREY.,friend.
3528,PHEBE CAREY.,
3529,PHEBE CAREY.,"""What a graceful creature is Florence Howard!"" continued Mrs. Edson, as"
3530,PHEBE CAREY.,"the fair girl whirled past her in the dance. ""Edith, your brother should"
3531,PHEBE CAREY.,consider himself most fortunate in securing the most brilliant lady in
3532,PHEBE CAREY.,"the room for a partner; no disparagement to your charms, my dear,"" she"
3533,PHEBE CAREY.,"added, leaning over and bestowing a kiss on the soft cheek of the"
3534,PHEBE CAREY.,"blushing girl. ""You know what I think of you, darling. The spirit of"
3535,PHEBE CAREY.,"beauty is everywhere, says the poet. She assumes the largest variety of"
3536,PHEBE CAREY.,"types and forms, and, verily, she has given her most dangerous one to"
3537,PHEBE CAREY.,"Florence Howard. She is the brilliant dahlia, the pride of the gay"
3538,PHEBE CAREY.,parterre; but my Edith is the modest daisy blooming in some sheltered
3539,PHEBE CAREY.,nook. The stormy winds shall rend the one from its lofty stalk and
3540,PHEBE CAREY.,"scatter its wealth of purple leaves o'er the miry earth, while dews and"
3541,PHEBE CAREY.,sunbeams kiss the modest plant that blooms in the lowly vale. Is it not
3542,PHEBE CAREY.,"so, Mr. Lindenwood?"" she asked, as, pausing, she encountered his gaze"
3543,PHEBE CAREY.,fixed earnestly on her face.
3544,PHEBE CAREY.,
3545,PHEBE CAREY.,"""I don't know,"" he said; ""that is, I have not considered the subject."
3546,PHEBE CAREY.,"Edith, I think the party are retiring,"" he added, turning his eyes to"
3547,PHEBE CAREY.,"several disjointed groups; ""remain with Mrs. Edson a few moments and I"
3548,PHEBE CAREY.,"will return to you."""
3549,PHEBE CAREY.,
3550,PHEBE CAREY.,"As he entered the ladies' dressing room, he saw Florence standing alone"
3551,PHEBE CAREY.,"by the window, in the very spot where they had often stood in the"
3552,PHEBE CAREY.,"interim of recitations, and studied their lessons from the same book. He"
3553,PHEBE CAREY.,thought he would give the world to know she was thinking of those times
3554,PHEBE CAREY.,now. Approaching softly he stood near her in silence a few moments.
3555,PHEBE CAREY.,
3556,PHEBE CAREY.,"""O, Florence!"" said he, at length, in a low, deep tone, tremulous with"
3557,PHEBE CAREY.,intense feeling and tenderness. Was there not enough of passionate
3558,PHEBE CAREY.,"devotion breathed in that one word to convince her of his eternal,"
3559,PHEBE CAREY.,unchanging affection?
3560,PHEBE CAREY.,
3561,PHEBE CAREY.,"What poor, weak simpletons are we, to pine and languish for words, where"
3562,PHEBE CAREY.,looks and tones are infinitely more expressive! Some people affirm that
3563,PHEBE CAREY.,"""actions speak louder than words."" But we can't say much in favor of"
3564,PHEBE CAREY.,"those, because, as far as we know, people in love invariably act like"
3565,PHEBE CAREY.,fools.
3566,PHEBE CAREY.,
3567,PHEBE CAREY.,"Florence turned at Edgar's adjuration, and he saw, by the moonlight, two"
3568,PHEBE CAREY.,great tear-drops dimming her starry eyes. He was about to extend his
3569,PHEBE CAREY.,"hand when Rufus Malcome rushed into the room, calling her name. Changing"
3570,PHEBE CAREY.,"his purpose, he said, in a light conventional tone, ""Have you been happy"
3571,PHEBE CAREY.,"to night?"""
3572,PHEBE CAREY.,
3573,PHEBE CAREY.,"""O, very!"" answered she, with a gay laugh, which echoed in his ear long"
3574,PHEBE CAREY.,after she had taken the arm of Rufus and tripped lightly away.
3575,PHEBE CAREY.,
3576,PHEBE CAREY.,"When Edgar returned to Edith, he found Col. Malcome in lively"
3577,PHEBE CAREY.,"conversation with Mrs. Edson. Florence and Rufus had disappeared, and"
3578,PHEBE CAREY.,"Edith signifying her wish to retire, he led her from the hall and"
3579,PHEBE CAREY.,escorted her home. He found Florence in Col. Malcome's parlor sitting on
3580,PHEBE CAREY.,a sofa with Rufus at her side.
3581,PHEBE CAREY.,
3582,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Come in, Lindenwood,"" said he; ""here's room for us all."""
3583,PHEBE CAREY.,
3584,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Thank you,"" returned Edgar. ""I have a long walk before me, and must not"
3585,PHEBE CAREY.,"tarry."""
3586,PHEBE CAREY.,
3587,PHEBE CAREY.,"""O, stay with us to night,"" said Rufus."
3588,PHEBE CAREY.,
3589,PHEBE CAREY.,"""We should be pleased to have you remain, if agreeable,"" remarked Edith,"
3590,PHEBE CAREY.,timidly.
3591,PHEBE CAREY.,
3592,PHEBE CAREY.,"""It would be very agreeable,"" said Edgar, politely, ""but my absence"
3593,PHEBE CAREY.,"would alarm my uncle."""
3594,PHEBE CAREY.,
3595,PHEBE CAREY.,"""O, he wants to be off to his hermitage!"" laughed Rufus, coarsely; ""let"
3596,PHEBE CAREY.,"him go. You will stay, won't you, Florence?"""
3597,PHEBE CAREY.,
3598,PHEBE CAREY.,"""If Edith invites me,"" returned she."
3599,PHEBE CAREY.,
3600,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Well, I do,"" said Edith quickly."
3601,PHEBE CAREY.,
3602,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Then the point is settled,"" remarked Florence."
3603,PHEBE CAREY.,
3604,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Good-night to you all,"" said Edgar, moving hastily toward the door."
3605,PHEBE CAREY.,
3606,PHEBE CAREY.,"Scarce ten minutes had elapsed, after his departure, when Florence rose"
3607,PHEBE CAREY.,"and said, ""Now I am going."""
3608,PHEBE CAREY.,
3609,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Why, you just promised to remain all night,"" said Rufus, in a tone of"
3610,PHEBE CAREY.,undisguised disappointment.
3611,PHEBE CAREY.,
3612,PHEBE CAREY.,"""No,"" said she; ""I made no promise, and I am going."""
3613,PHEBE CAREY.,
3614,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Then I'll go with you,"" returned Rufus, seizing his hat."
3615,PHEBE CAREY.,
3616,PHEBE CAREY.,"""No,"" said Col. Malcome, suddenly entering the apartment. ""With Miss"
3617,PHEBE CAREY.,"Howard's consent, I'll be her escort home to-night."""
3618,PHEBE CAREY.,
3619,PHEBE CAREY.,Florence said she should be honored by his company. So bidding
3620,PHEBE CAREY.,"good-night to Edith and Rufus, she took his proffered arm and descended"
3621,PHEBE CAREY.,to the street.
3622,PHEBE CAREY.,
3623,PHEBE CAREY.,"""How have you enjoyed the ball to-night?"" inquired he, as they walked on"
3624,PHEBE CAREY.,together.
3625,PHEBE CAREY.,
3626,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Very well,"" answered she, briefly."
3627,PHEBE CAREY.,
3628,PHEBE CAREY.,"""This young Lindenwood, that burrows with the strange chap they call the"
3629,PHEBE CAREY.,"'Hermit of the Cedars;' you are acquainted with him, I believe."""
3630,PHEBE CAREY.,
3631,PHEBE CAREY.,"""He has attended school at the seminary, since I commenced to go,"""
3632,PHEBE CAREY.,"answered Florence, as calmly as she was able."
3633,PHEBE CAREY.,
3634,PHEBE CAREY.,"""He has been paying Edith some attentions of late,"" continued the"
3635,PHEBE CAREY.,"colonel, in a careless tone; ""do you suppose he really cares for her?"""
3636,PHEBE CAREY.,
3637,PHEBE CAREY.,"""I don't know,"" answered Florence; and her voice trembled in spite of"
3638,PHEBE CAREY.,her efforts to steady it.
3639,PHEBE CAREY.,
3640,PHEBE CAREY.,"""Of course you don't know,"" the colonel went on, still in that cold,"
3641,PHEBE CAREY.,"indifferent tone; ""I merely asked what you thought?"""
3642,PHEBE CAREY.,
3643,PHEBE CAREY.,"""I never thought anything about it in my life,"" said Florence, in a"
3644,PHEBE CAREY.,choking voice.
3645,PHEBE CAREY.,
3646,PHEBE CAREY.,"""That's rather strange,"" returned he. ""I have thought of it several"
3647,PHEBE CAREY.,times lately;--but here we are at your father's gate. Present my
3648,PHEBE CAREY.,"regards, and say I would be happy to receive a call from him whenever he"
3649,PHEBE CAREY.,"is so disposed."""
3650,PHEBE CAREY.,
3651,PHEBE CAREY.,"Florence bowed good-evening to her gallant, and hurried to her own"
3652,PHEBE CAREY.,apartment.
3653,PHEBE CAREY.,
3654,PHEBE CAREY.,"The night was warm. A waning moon lighted the eastern terrace, and, not"
3655,PHEBE CAREY.,"feeling disposed to sleep, she stepped through a window that opened to"
3656,PHEBE CAREY.,"the floor, and, leaning against a pillar, stood silently gazing over the"
3657,PHEBE CAREY.,gardens and grounds below.
3658,PHEBE CAREY.,
3659,PHEBE CAREY.,She had not been standing long thus when she beheld the figure of a man
3660,PHEBE CAREY.,"moving slowly along the gravelled walks, pausing frequently and fixing"
3661,PHEBE CAREY.,an earnest gaze on the windows of the apartment occupied by her mother.
3662,PHEBE CAREY.,"She grew alarmed, and was about descending the stairs to arouse her"
3663,PHEBE CAREY.,"father, when she heard the hall door open softly, and saw the figure of"
3664,PHEBE CAREY.,a woman stealing down the garden path. She recognized the dark form
3665,PHEBE CAREY.,instantly as that of Hannah Doliver. The man met her and the two went
3666,PHEBE CAREY.,"into a green-house. After an hour the woman reappeared, and retraced her"
3667,PHEBE CAREY.,"steps to the mansion, but the man she saw no more. Securing her windows,"
3668,PHEBE CAREY.,"Florence retired, resolving to impart to her father a history of what"
3669,PHEBE CAREY.,she had seen.
3670,PHEBE CAREY.,
3671,PHEBE CAREY.,"When, she did so, he only laughed at her and said he supposed it was"
3672,PHEBE CAREY.,some enamored knight come to pay his devoirs to the fair lady of his
3673,PHEBE CAREY.,"love, and counselled her to say no more of the matter, as it would"
3674,PHEBE CAREY.,needlessly irritate Hannah to know her secret was discovered.

3681,CHAPTER XVIII.,"""The world hath used me well, and now at length"

3683,CHAPTER XVIII.,To feed upon the fruits of my hard toils.
3684,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Ambition doth no more distract my breast,--"
3685,CHAPTER XVIII.,I've reached the height my spirit strove to gain;
3686,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Here will I rest, and watch life glide away."""
3687,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3688,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3689,CHAPTER XVIII.,It is quite time for us to call on Mrs. Salsify Mumbles again. We fear
3690,CHAPTER XVIII.,"the good lady, who is rather sensitive on such points, has felt"
3691,CHAPTER XVIII.,"neglected ere this; but we hope not, and, as her mansion heaves in view,"
3692,CHAPTER XVIII.,we are convinced that matters of more importance than visits from our
3693,CHAPTER XVIII.,"humble selves, have engaged our old friend's attention."
3694,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3695,CHAPTER XVIII.,"The second story has actually gone up, and the piazza spreads its white"
3696,CHAPTER XVIII.,palings along the sides of Mr. Salsify's dwelling. The pasteboard sign
3697,CHAPTER XVIII.,"of ""Mr. Theophilus Shaw, Boot & Shoe Maker,"" is no longer seen swinging"
3698,CHAPTER XVIII.,"from the bed-room window, but a new sign stretches its sublime length"
3699,CHAPTER XVIII.,"over the doors of Mr. Salsify's old grocery, announcing, in staring"
3700,CHAPTER XVIII.,"black and yellow, to the inhabitants of Wimbledon, that ""Mumbles, Shaw &"
3701,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Co., wholesale dealers in pork, cheese, onions, dried apples, sausages,"
3702,CHAPTER XVIII.,"and verdigris, continue at the old stand, No. 9 Temple street, where"
3703,CHAPTER XVIII.,they will entertain the trading public in a genteel and finished
3704,CHAPTER XVIII.,"manner."""
3705,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3706,CHAPTER XVIII.,Thus it appears Mr. Salsify's high hopes are at length realized. Most
3707,CHAPTER XVIII.,"fortunate man! He has ""risen in his profession"" to the topmost summit of"
3708,CHAPTER XVIII.,his earthly ambition.
3709,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3710,CHAPTER XVIII.,Happy will it be for him if he remains content with his present
3711,CHAPTER XVIII.,"elevation, and goes not, like too many restless mortals, clambering to a"
3712,CHAPTER XVIII.,"higher point, only to fall back, on some adverse day, into the slough of"
3713,CHAPTER XVIII.,ill-luck and despondency.
3714,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3715,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Mrs. Salsify sits in her parlor making caps for her thumb, at least we"
3716,CHAPTER XVIII.,"should judge so, from their surprisingly small dimensions; and Mary"
3717,CHAPTER XVIII.,Madeline is nowhere to be seen. But Dilly Danforth is in the kitchen
3718,CHAPTER XVIII.,"bending over a great wash-tub, pale and sunken-eyed as ever. Now that we"
3719,CHAPTER XVIII.,"look at this woman attentively, it strikes us she is wonderfully like"
3720,CHAPTER XVIII.,"that lank-visaged man, who dwells in the lonely forest hut, the ""Hermit"
3721,CHAPTER XVIII.,"of the Cedars,"" as he is called. But then it may be only the resemblance"
3722,CHAPTER XVIII.,which all the sons and daughters of affliction have in common. 'Tis not
3723,CHAPTER XVIII.,"likely 'tis more than that. And gazing on Willie, who stands over the"
3724,CHAPTER XVIII.,"great arches, replenishing the fires, and at intervals poking the white"
3725,CHAPTER XVIII.,heaps of linen beneath the fierce bubbling suds with a long wooden
3726,CHAPTER XVIII.,"shovel, we fancy for a moment there's something about him like Edgar"
3727,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Lindenwood. Of course, he is not so large or so well-dressed;"
3728,CHAPTER XVIII.,"nevertheless, he is greatly improved since we last saw him; and there is"
3729,CHAPTER XVIII.,"something in the turn of the head, which is certainly finely shaped,"
3730,CHAPTER XVIII.,though placed on the shoulders of a beggar boy; and something in the set
3731,CHAPTER XVIII.,"of the rusty cloth cap over the bright, sunny curls, that reminds us of"
3732,CHAPTER XVIII.,"the tall, graceful lad we used to see winding his way over the hills to"
3733,CHAPTER XVIII.,"the large, white seminary. But then, a great many boys have"
3734,CHAPTER XVIII.,"pretty-formed heads, and bright, curly hair; and, should we attempt, no"
3735,CHAPTER XVIII.,doubt we could find a large number with more points of resemblance than
3736,CHAPTER XVIII.,we have been able to make out between Edgar Lindenwood and Willie
3737,CHAPTER XVIII.,Danforth. We are full of conceits. Sometimes Edith Malcome is like
3738,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Florence Howard, and Rufus' glistening, coal-black hair reminds us of"
3739,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Hannah Doliver, while the handsome colonel has a look we cannot fathom,"
3740,CHAPTER XVIII.,and from which we turn with a creeping shudder.
3741,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3742,CHAPTER XVIII.,'Tis quite astonishing what strange fancies possess people at times.
3743,CHAPTER XVIII.,
3744,CHAPTER XVIII.,"While we have been indulging in ours, Mrs. Mumbles has put away those"
3745,CHAPTER XVIII.,"impossible caps, and come into the kitchen to see how matters and things"
3746,CHAPTER XVIII.,"are progressing, and just as she begins to tell Aunt Dilly, that she"
3747,CHAPTER XVIII.,"""wants her to get through washing in time to scour down the pantry"
3748,CHAPTER XVIII.,"shelves and scrub the oil-cloth on the dining-room floor,"" in runs Miss"
3749,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Susan Pimble, and says, ""Mamma wants Mrs. Danforth to come and do a"

3751,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Flats to attend a great mass convention, and can't stop to do it"
3752,CHAPTER XVIII.,"herself. She will pay Aunt Dilly well, if she will oblige her. Garrison"
3753,CHAPTER XVIII.,"has been sick--Peggy Nonce is away on a visit to her son, who has"

3755,CHAPTER XVIII.,"have proved too heavy for her shoulders,"" etc., etc."

3781,CHAPTER XIX.,"commanding aspect and handsome features. Light auburn hair, closely"
3782,CHAPTER XIX.,"trimmed, lay in short, thick masses of wavy curls around his high, pale"
3783,CHAPTER XIX.,"brow. His mien and manner indicated the well-bred gentleman. A small,"
3784,CHAPTER XIX.,dark figure crouched beside him. It was Hannah Doliver.
3785,CHAPTER XIX.,
3786,CHAPTER XIX.,"""We meet again at last,"" said the man, after a considerable silence. His"

3884,CHAPTER XIX.,"""What do you wish?"" said he, pausing."
3885,CHAPTER XIX.,
3886,CHAPTER XIX.,"The woman hesitated, and at length said, ""The girl--her child I mean; is"
3887,CHAPTER XIX.,"she----?"""
3888,CHAPTER XIX.,
3889,CHAPTER XIX.,"Again the man whispered in her ear. ""None can say,"" he added aloud,"
3890,CHAPTER XIX.,"""that I have not been a kind parent to my children."""
3891,CHAPTER XIX.,
3892,CHAPTER XIX.,"""I'm glad there's some virtue in you,"" said the woman, turning toward"
3893,CHAPTER XIX.,the quiet mansion that stood in almost palace-like magnificence in the
3894,CHAPTER XIX.,midst of the beautiful grounds that surrounded it on all sides. The man
3895,CHAPTER XIX.,"lingered behind, and finally left the garden by a path lying in an"
3896,CHAPTER XIX.,opposite direction from the one by which he had entered. He bent his
3897,CHAPTER XIX.,steps rapidly in the direction of the river. Either the warmth of the
3898,CHAPTER XIX.,"night or his own emotions oppressed him; for, as he gained its banks, he"
3899,CHAPTER XIX.,"slackened his pace, drew off his cap, and loosened his collar. With"
3900,CHAPTER XIX.,"arms folded across his chest, he moved slowly along, like one intensely"
3901,CHAPTER XIX.,absorbed in some dark and intricate train of thought. Sometimes he
3902,CHAPTER XIX.,"muttered to himself, and made strange gestures, or tossed his head with"
3903,CHAPTER XIX.,"a confident air, as though he saw onward to the success of some plan he"
3904,CHAPTER XIX.,"concerted. So occupied was he in his own thoughts, that he never saw the"
3905,CHAPTER XIX.,"tall, gaunt figure of a man, crouching in the shadow of a small linden"
3906,CHAPTER XIX.,"tree, that stood on the bank of the river, nearly opposite Dilly"
3907,CHAPTER XIX.,"Danforth's wretched abode, although he passed in so close contact as to"
3908,CHAPTER XIX.,"brush against the little bundle of sticks the unknown held in his hand,"
3909,CHAPTER XIX.,"while his deep, sunken eyes glared on the passer till they seemed nearly"
3910,CHAPTER XIX.,starting from their sockets.
3911,CHAPTER XIX.,
3912,CHAPTER XIX.,"""'Tis he!"" murmured the gazer, when the abstracted one was beyond the"
3913,CHAPTER XIX.,"sound of his voice. ""I must see where he goes;"" and, stealing"
3914,CHAPTER XIX.,"noiselessly to the door of Dilly's abode, he placed the bundle of sticks"
3915,CHAPTER XIX.,"on her sill, and slowly followed the receding figure."
3916,CHAPTER XIX.,
3917,CHAPTER XIX.,
3918,CHAPTER XIX.,
3919,CHAPTER XIX.,
3920,CHAPTER XX.,CHAPTER XX.
3921,CHAPTER XX.,
3922,CHAPTER XX.,"""And the clear depths of her dark eye"
3923,CHAPTER XX.,"Were bright with troubled brilliancy,"
3924,CHAPTER XX.,"Yet the lips drooped as with the tear,"
3925,CHAPTER XX.,"Which might oppress, but not appear."
3926,CHAPTER XX.,"Her curls, with all their sunny glow,"
3927,CHAPTER XX.,Were braided o'er an aching brow;
3928,CHAPTER XX.,But well she knew how many sought
3929,CHAPTER XX.,To gaze upon her secret thought;--
3930,CHAPTER XX.,And love is proud--she might not brook
3931,CHAPTER XX.,"That others on her heart should look."""
3932,CHAPTER XX.,
3933,CHAPTER XX.,
3934,CHAPTER XX.,One pleasant autumn evening a social group were assembled in Mr. Leroy
3935,CHAPTER XX.,"Edson's tasteful parlor. A tall, argand lamp on a marble table, shed its"
3936,CHAPTER XX.,"mild, ethereal light over the rich furniture. A bright fire glowed in"
3937,CHAPTER XX.,"the marble grate, and in the genial atmosphere of her own creating,"
3938,CHAPTER XX.,"young Mrs. Edson moved, a thing of grace and beauty. She wore a robe of"
3939,CHAPTER XX.,"emerald Genoa velvet, with an open bodice, laced over a chemisette of"
3940,CHAPTER XX.,"fine-wrought Mechlin lace. Broad, drooping Pagoda sleeves revealed her"
3941,CHAPTER XX.,white arms encircled by quaintly-fashioned jet bracelets. Her guests
3942,CHAPTER XX.,"were not numerous, but select. Col. Malcome and his family were most"
3943,CHAPTER XX.,"prominent among the number. Florence Howard was there, attended by"
3944,CHAPTER XX.,"Rufus, and Edgar Lindenwood in company with Edith. Jenny Andrews, with"
3945,CHAPTER XX.,"no less a personage than our quondam, roguish friend, Dick Giblet,"
3946,CHAPTER XX.,"shop-boy of Mr. Salsify Mumbles' grocery; now Mr. Richard Giblet, of the"
3947,CHAPTER XX.,"firm of Edson, Giblet & Co. A very respectable appearance Dick made,"
3948,CHAPTER XX.,"too, for he was a quick, sprightly young fellow, albeit somewhat"
3949,CHAPTER XX.,over-fond of a mischievous joke; but this he would outgrow in time
3950,CHAPTER XX.,"probably. Amy Seaton, sedate and modest as ever, with laughing Charlie"
3951,CHAPTER XX.,"for her beau, and several others, among whom we might mention Miss"
3952,CHAPTER XX.,"Martha Pinkerton, made up the little party."
3953,CHAPTER XX.,
3954,CHAPTER XX.,"Edith looked fragile and sweet as ever in a dress of azure thibet cloth,"
3955,CHAPTER XX.,her light hair hanging in clusters of wavy curls over her small
3956,CHAPTER XX.,"shoulders. She leaned gracefully on the arm of Lindenwood, and looked in"
3957,CHAPTER XX.,"his face with a gentle, artless expression of countenance."
3958,CHAPTER XX.,
3959,CHAPTER XX.,"Florence, in her crimson cashmere, and dark, massy ringlets, looked a"
3960,CHAPTER XX.,"shade paler than when we last saw her, but more queenly and brilliant,"
3961,CHAPTER XX.,if possible.
3962,CHAPTER XX.,
3963,CHAPTER XX.,There were many points of resemblance between her and Louise Edson. Both
3964,CHAPTER XX.,were endowed with superior mental and intellectual powers; both
3965,CHAPTER XX.,accomplished and beautiful; but there was at times a gentleness in
3966,CHAPTER XX.,"Florence's manner, a dreamy light in the far depths of her large, hazel"
3967,CHAPTER XX.,"eyes, that indicated less firmness and strength of character, with"
3968,CHAPTER XX.,tenderer susceptibilities. Perhaps life's trials would sooner unnerve
3969,CHAPTER XX.,her spirit.
3970,CHAPTER XX.,
3971,CHAPTER XX.,"Mr. Edson was not present, nor was it necessary he should be, to enhance"
3972,CHAPTER XX.,"the enjoyment of his gifted wife. He was, in fact, very much the same"
3973,CHAPTER XX.,sort of an appendage in his elegant mansion that Mrs. Pimble averred her
3974,CHAPTER XX.,"husband to be in his,--""a mere crank to keep the machine in motion."" Not"
3975,CHAPTER XX.,"that Mrs. Edson monopolized her husband's sphere, as did the masculine"
3976,CHAPTER XX.,Mrs. Pimble. By no means. She appeared to give her lord full sway and
3977,CHAPTER XX.,"sceptre in his own household, and the good-natured man thought never"
3978,CHAPTER XX.,"husband had so obedient, condescending partner as blessed his bosom."
3979,CHAPTER XX.,"Consummate actress, to conquer where she seemed to yield, and use her"
3980,CHAPTER XX.,advantages so skilfully that the vanquished felt himself the victor.
3981,CHAPTER XX.,"Mrs. Pimble stormed and blustered, but she exercised not half the power"
3982,CHAPTER XX.,over her household that Louise Edson swayed by a soft word or placid
3983,CHAPTER XX.,smile.
3984,CHAPTER XX.,
3985,CHAPTER XX.,"But we forget our party, which waxes merry as the evening progresses,"
3986,CHAPTER XX.,warmed by the genial influences of social intercourse. Col. Malcome and
3987,CHAPTER XX.,Mrs. Edson discussed the merits of different authors; Lindenwood
3988,CHAPTER XX.,"modestly joined them, and Florence dropped an occasional word. Edith sat"
3989,CHAPTER XX.,"silent. Rufus yawned, and at length commenced a game of forfeits with"
3990,CHAPTER XX.,"Dick Giblet, over which he soon grew so boisterous, that his father"
3991,CHAPTER XX.,reproved him sternly for a violation of the rules of politeness. The
3992,CHAPTER XX.,"youth's brow flushed with sudden anger, and for the remainder of the"
3993,CHAPTER XX.,evening he sat apart from the company. When the party dispersed he did
3994,CHAPTER XX.,"not come forward to claim Florence, and she fell a second time to the"
3995,CHAPTER XX.,"care of Col. Malcome. Edgar escorted Edith, and the couples went"
3996,CHAPTER XX.,different ways to reach their destinations. Edgar took the street by the
3997,CHAPTER XX.,"river, and Col. M. that leading past the seminary. The latter had much"
3998,CHAPTER XX.,"the longer walk; but Edith, fragile and delicate, complained of fatigue,"
3999,CHAPTER XX.,"ere they had proceeded far, and Edgar proposed she should rest awhile on"
4000,CHAPTER XX.,"the trunk of a fallen tree by the river's brink. She sat down, and he,"
4001,CHAPTER XX.,"after a few moments, assumed a seat at her side. Her veil was thrown"
4002,CHAPTER XX.,"off, and her small silk hat had fallen back from her head, revealing in"
4003,CHAPTER XX.,"full her girlish features and wavy, auburn curls. Edgar was gazing on"
4004,CHAPTER XX.,"the beautiful face, when suddenly a footstep met his ear, and, turning,"
4005,CHAPTER XX.,"he beheld his uncle, the hermit, standing before them, staring wildly"
4006,CHAPTER XX.,"upon Edith; who, as soon as she discovered the strange-looking being,"
4007,CHAPTER XX.,"uttered a faint scream and sunk on Edgar's bosom. ""Don't be alarmed,"""
4008,CHAPTER XX.,"said he, whispering in her ear; ""this man will not harm you,""--and then"
4009,CHAPTER XX.,"lifting his head to address his uncle, and inquire what brought him"
4010,CHAPTER XX.,"there, so far from home at that late hour, he found the hermit had"
4011,CHAPTER XX.,disappeared.
4012,CHAPTER XX.,
4013,CHAPTER XX.,"Calming Edith's alarm as well as he was able, he escorted her home, and"
4014,CHAPTER XX.,"then set off for the hut in the forest, pondering, as he went, upon the"
4015,CHAPTER XX.,"event of the evening, and wondering what could be the cause of the"
4016,CHAPTER XX.,fierce and ireful expression which disfigured the usually placid face of
4017,CHAPTER XX.,"his uncle, as he gazed so fixedly on Edith. It reminded him of the"
4018,CHAPTER XX.,violent passion evinced in regard to his intercourse with Florence
4019,CHAPTER XX.,Howard. He knew the recluse had experienced a severe disappointment in
4020,CHAPTER XX.,"early life, and concluded this had tended to sour his mind toward the"
4021,CHAPTER XX.,"whole female race, and caused him to look with angry distrust upon the"
4022,CHAPTER XX.,most gentle and lovely of the sex. In no other way could he account for
4023,CHAPTER XX.,the repugnance manifested by his uncle toward his friendship and
4024,CHAPTER XX.,"acquaintance with both Florence and Edith. Thus ruminating, he reached"
4025,CHAPTER XX.,the forest habitation to find all dark and gloomy. The hermit had not
4026,CHAPTER XX.,returned to his hut.
4027,CHAPTER XX.,
4028,CHAPTER XX.,Col. Malcome lingered a moment as he escorted Florence to the door of
4029,CHAPTER XX.,"her father's mansion, and, as he did so, Major Howard stepped forth,"
4030,CHAPTER XX.,"rather suddenly. Florence presented him to the colonel, and the two"
4031,CHAPTER XX.,gentlemen shook hands cordially.
4032,CHAPTER XX.,
4033,CHAPTER XX.,"""I have frequently desired to call on you and form your acquaintance,"
4034,CHAPTER XX.,"Col. Malcome,"" said the major; ""but frequent absences from home, and the"
4035,CHAPTER XX.,"delicate health of my wife, have prevented me hitherto."""
4036,CHAPTER XX.,
4037,CHAPTER XX.,"A slight, cynical smile flitted over the colonel's face at these latter"
4038,CHAPTER XX.,"words, but it was not observed in the obscure light of evening, and he"
4039,CHAPTER XX.,"answered, politely, that he had often desired an acquaintance with the"
4040,CHAPTER XX.,"major, and hoped that now their children had established a friendly"
4041,CHAPTER XX.,"intercourse, the parents might soon follow the example."
4042,CHAPTER XX.,
4043,CHAPTER XX.,"Major Howard expressed a wish that it might be so, and Col. Malcome,"
4044,CHAPTER XX.,"bowing gracefully, retired."
4045,CHAPTER XX.,
4046,CHAPTER XX.,"Florence, after inquiring for her mother, and learning she was"
4047,CHAPTER XX.,"comfortable as usual, ascended to her room, made fast the door, and drew"
4048,CHAPTER XX.,"forth her journal, which was the dearest companion of her lonely hours,"
4049,CHAPTER XX.,"the receptacle of her most treasured thoughts, and safety-valve for all"
4050,CHAPTER XX.,unuttered griefs and hidden sorrows.
4051,CHAPTER XX.,
4052,CHAPTER XX.,"She had scarcely touched her gold-tipped pen to the virgin page, when a"
4053,CHAPTER XX.,soft knock on the door displaced her train of thought.
4054,CHAPTER XX.,
4055,CHAPTER XX.,"""Father?"" said she putting her lips close to the lock, for he was the"
4056,CHAPTER XX.,only one from whom she could expect a call at that late hour. There was
4057,CHAPTER XX.,"no answer. She hesitated a moment, and then opened the door. Hannah"
4058,CHAPTER XX.,Doliver slid in.
4059,CHAPTER XX.,
4060,CHAPTER XX.,"Florence stood still, gazing with astonishment on the little wiry form,"
4061,CHAPTER XX.,"as it wormed around the apartment, touching the books, and giving sudden"
4062,CHAPTER XX.,pulls at the curtains and bed drapery. She had never seen Hannah over
4063,CHAPTER XX.,"her threshold before, and wondered what a visit from her might import."
4064,CHAPTER XX.,
4065,CHAPTER XX.,"""I came to see if you wanted anything, Miss Florence,"" said the woman,"
4066,CHAPTER XX.,"at length, fixing her twinkling eyes on the fair girl's face."
4067,CHAPTER XX.,
4068,CHAPTER XX.,"""No!"" said Florence, in an impatient tone; ""what should I want at this"
4069,CHAPTER XX.,"hour, but to be alone?"""
4070,CHAPTER XX.,
4071,CHAPTER XX.,"""O, I'm not going to intrude upon you but a moment,"" returned Hannah. ""I"
4072,CHAPTER XX.,"thought, as you had been out late and 'twas rather cold, you might want"
4073,CHAPTER XX.,"a fire lighted in your room, or a cup of warm tea, or something; so I"
4074,CHAPTER XX.,"ran up to see."" Florence grew more and more astonished. ""Have you"
4075,CHAPTER XX.,"enjoyed yourself this evening?"" asked Hannah."
4076,CHAPTER XX.,
4077,CHAPTER XX.,"""Yes,"" answered Florence briefly."
4078,CHAPTER XX.,
4079,CHAPTER XX.,"""I am glad to hear it,"" returned the woman. ""This Col. Mer---- what is"
4080,CHAPTER XX.,"his name?"" she paused and asked abruptly."
4081,CHAPTER XX.,
4082,CHAPTER XX.,"""Malcome,"" said Florence."
4083,CHAPTER XX.,
4084,CHAPTER XX.,"""O, yes! I'm bad at remembering strange names. Well, this Col. Malcome"
4085,CHAPTER XX.,"has got some fine children, has he not?"""
4086,CHAPTER XX.,
4087,CHAPTER XX.,"""Yes,"" returned Florence; ""his daughter is a beautiful girl."""
4088,CHAPTER XX.,
4089,CHAPTER XX.,"""And his son?"""
4090,CHAPTER XX.,
4091,CHAPTER XX.,"""Is a loggerhead."""
4092,CHAPTER XX.,
4093,CHAPTER XX.,"At these words, a furious anger, flashed over Hannah's face, and,"
4094,CHAPTER XX.,"glaring fiercely on Florence for a moment, she darted from the room and"
4095,CHAPTER XX.,"slammed the door behind her. The young girl turned the key, saying, ""I'm"
4096,CHAPTER XX.,glad to be rid of her hateful presence. What possessed her to come here
4097,CHAPTER XX.,"is more than I can tell."" And in the surprise this unusual visit"
4098,CHAPTER XX.,"occasioned, she retired and forgot her journal."

4100,CHAPTER XX.,
4101,CHAPTER XX.,
4102,CHAPTER XX.,
4103,CHAPTER XXI.,CHAPTER XXI.
4104,CHAPTER XXI.,
4105,CHAPTER XXI.,"""A mien that neither seeks nor shuns"
4106,CHAPTER XXI.,The homage scattered in her way;
4107,CHAPTER XXI.,"A love that hath few favored ones,"
4108,CHAPTER XXI.,And yet for all can work and pray.
4109,CHAPTER XXI.,A smile wherein each mortal reads
4110,CHAPTER XXI.,The very sympathy he needs;
4111,CHAPTER XXI.,"An eye like to a mystic book,"
4112,CHAPTER XXI.,"Of lays that bard or prophet sings,"
4113,CHAPTER XXI.,Which keepeth for the holiest look
4114,CHAPTER XXI.,"Of holiest love, its deepest things."""
4115,CHAPTER XXI.,
4116,CHAPTER XXI.,
4117,CHAPTER XXI.,"What an impetus was given to the cause of Woman's Rights, when the first"
4118,CHAPTER XXI.,Bloomer stepped upon the stage! With what tremendous huzzas of triumph
4119,CHAPTER XXI.,and victory did the whole assaulting sisterhood mount the breaches thus
4120,CHAPTER XXI.,made in the great bulwarks of man's tyranny and despotism; infuriately
4121,CHAPTER XXI.,calling on every woman throughout the length and breadth of the nation
4122,CHAPTER XXI.,"to rise in the might of her slumbering strength, make her petticoats"
4123,CHAPTER XXI.,"into pillars of defiance, and hurl them on the weak, unguarded outposts,"
4124,CHAPTER XXI.,till the whole tottering fabric should go down with a crash to rise no
4125,CHAPTER XXI.,more.
4126,CHAPTER XXI.,
4127,CHAPTER XXI.,Mrs. Pimble and her coadjutors commenced rolling the ball of reform
4128,CHAPTER XXI.,"with increased velocity. Mass meetings, of the most boisterous and"
4129,CHAPTER XXI.,"denunciatory character, were held through the community. It appeared a"
4130,CHAPTER XXI.,war was commenced which threatened to cease only with the extermination
4131,CHAPTER XXI.,"of the masculine portion of Wimbledon. Mr. Salsify Mumbles, though as"
4132,CHAPTER XXI.,"brave as most men in common encounters, was afraid to step outside his"
4133,CHAPTER XXI.,door lest his unmentionables should be seized by some of the new-fledged
4134,CHAPTER XXI.,"manhood, and a petticoat tied to his coat-tail. Even the green damask"
4135,CHAPTER XXI.,"curtains and cushion-coverings that adorned the high, old-fashioned"
4136,CHAPTER XXI.,"pulpit of the village church, were voted as ostentatious and calculated"
4137,CHAPTER XXI.,to foster luxurious idleness in the pastor; and a committee appointed
4138,CHAPTER XXI.,and authorized to tear them from their places and sew them into bloomers
4139,CHAPTER XXI.,"for the comfort of the lady-lecturers, whose callings exposed them to"
4140,CHAPTER XXI.,the most inclement weathers. And so green-legged Philanthropy stalked
4141,CHAPTER XXI.,through Wimbledon; but it never laid an armful of wood on the sill of
4142,CHAPTER XXI.,"Dilly Danforth's humble abode, though rough blew the storms of the"
4143,CHAPTER XXI.,"inclement winter; nor did it put a cap over Master Willie's curly locks,"
4144,CHAPTER XXI.,or sew a charitable patch on the elbow of his ragged jacket. Because it
4145,CHAPTER XXI.,"was philanthropy in the wider sense, which sought to relieve in the sum"
4146,CHAPTER XXI.,of thousands--not of units.
4147,CHAPTER XXI.,
4148,CHAPTER XXI.,Mrs. Dr. Simcoe figured not so largely among the sisterhood of reformers
4149,CHAPTER XXI.,"as she would have done had she not been encumbered by ""Simcoe's"
4150,CHAPTER XXI.,"children,"" who were two of the most ill-natured, uncompromising"
4151,CHAPTER XXI.,"offshoots of barbarism that ever tormented a meek, unoffending woman."
4152,CHAPTER XXI.,
4153,CHAPTER XXI.,Mrs. Lawson thought some reformer should arise to fill the place so
4154,CHAPTER XXI.,"nearly vacated by the persecuted lady, and fixed upon Mrs. Edson as her"
4155,CHAPTER XXI.,successor.
4156,CHAPTER XXI.,
4157,CHAPTER XXI.,"So, on a day, Mrs. Lawson, in green damask bloomers, black overcoat, and"
4158,CHAPTER XXI.,"deer-skin gloves, appeared on the steps of Mrs. Edson's mansion, and"
4159,CHAPTER XXI.,gave a herculean pull at the door-bell which brought the master of the
4160,CHAPTER XXI.,"house instanter, with staring eyes, to answer the pealing summons. ""I"
4161,CHAPTER XXI.,"believe Mrs. Edson resides here,"" said the lady-reformist, looking"
4162,CHAPTER XXI.,"loftily upon the man, who was evidently very much struck with his"
4163,CHAPTER XXI.,visitor's personal equipments.
4164,CHAPTER XXI.,
4165,CHAPTER XXI.,"""She does,"" answered he, at length."
4166,CHAPTER XXI.,
4167,CHAPTER XXI.,"""I have come to hold a conversation with her,"" said Mrs. Lawson,"
4168,CHAPTER XXI.,"stamping the snow from her boots, and proceeding toward the open door of"
4169,CHAPTER XXI.,the sitting-room.
4170,CHAPTER XXI.,
4171,CHAPTER XXI.,"Louise rose as she entered, glanced at the strange figure, then at her"
4172,CHAPTER XXI.,"husband, and then back to the figure again, with an amusing expression"
4173,CHAPTER XXI.,of wonder on her beautiful features.
4174,CHAPTER XXI.,
4175,CHAPTER XXI.,"""I do not know this--this person's name,"" said he, at length."
4176,CHAPTER XXI.,
4177,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Lawson--Mrs. Portentia Lawson!"" said the lady-reformist, laying her"
4178,CHAPTER XXI.,"walking-stick on the piano, and unbuttoning her over-coat. ""I am"
4179,CHAPTER XXI.,"actively engaged in the benevolent enterprises of the day, and have come"
4180,CHAPTER XXI.,"to obtain your aid and coöperation, madam."" Here she made a low"
4181,CHAPTER XXI.,inclination toward Louise.
4182,CHAPTER XXI.,
4183,CHAPTER XXI.,"""My wife does not meddle in such matters,"" said Mr. Edson, simply. ""I"
4184,CHAPTER XXI.,"pay a stated sum yearly toward the support of the gospel, and give as"
4185,CHAPTER XXI.,"much as people in general to the missionary and Bible societies."""
4186,CHAPTER XXI.,
4187,CHAPTER XXI.,"""It is nothing to me,"" said Mrs. Lawson, turning sharply upon the"
4188,CHAPTER XXI.,"speaker, ""what you give to support the gospel, or to endow Bible"
4189,CHAPTER XXI.,"societies. I have nothing to do with such milk-sop organizations, or the"
4190,CHAPTER XXI.,donkeys that draggle at their heels. Other and loftier objects engage my
4191,CHAPTER XXI.,"attention and claim my powers. My business is not with you, sir! It is"
4192,CHAPTER XXI.,"with the woman who condescends to acknowledge you as her husband!"""
4193,CHAPTER XXI.,"Having delivered herself of the preceding harangue, Mrs. Lawson turned"
4194,CHAPTER XXI.,"her attention to Louise, and vouchsafed no further notice of Mr. Edson,"
4195,CHAPTER XXI.,who soon slunk out of the room and returned to his counter.
4196,CHAPTER XXI.,
4197,CHAPTER XXI.,"""I suppose you are not wholly ignorant of the reform the more talented"
4198,CHAPTER XXI.,of your sex are making efforts to effect in the social condition of
4199,CHAPTER XXI.,"Wimbledon,"" remarked the nimble-tongued Mrs. Lawson to her fair auditor,"
4200,CHAPTER XXI.,"who was sitting in a low rocking-chair before the glowing grate, with"
4201,CHAPTER XXI.,"her tiny, slippered-feet poised on the fender."
4202,CHAPTER XXI.,
4203,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Yes!"" answered she, purposely ignorant. ""I am confined at home by my"
4204,CHAPTER XXI.,"duties as a wife, and know very little of what is passing around me."""
4205,CHAPTER XXI.,
4206,CHAPTER XXI.,Mrs. Lawson proceeded to give a detailed account of the labors of a
4207,CHAPTER XXI.,small band of enfranchised females for the liberation of their enslaved
4208,CHAPTER XXI.,"and suffering sisters, whose weakness and timidity had hitherto"
4209,CHAPTER XXI.,"prevented their rising and throwing off the yoke of the oppressor, man."
4210,CHAPTER XXI.,"So eloquently did she rehearse her tale, so still and patient was her"
4211,CHAPTER XXI.,"listener, that she felt confident of gaining a new coädjutor in the"
4212,CHAPTER XXI.,"ranks of female reform. As she finished her recital, she directed a"
4213,CHAPTER XXI.,"sharp, piercing glance toward Mrs. Edson, whose calm, clear eyes and"
4214,CHAPTER XXI.,placid face evinced no disturbing emotions.
4215,CHAPTER XXI.,
4216,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Will you join our ranks?"" demanded Mrs. Lawson, ""and aid us in rending"
4217,CHAPTER XXI.,"the fetters forged on woman's wrists by the tyrant man?"""
4218,CHAPTER XXI.,
4219,CHAPTER XXI.,"""No!"" said Louise, in a quiet but determined tone."
4220,CHAPTER XXI.,
4221,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Then you do not believe in Woman's Rights!"" said Mrs. Lawson, half her"
4222,CHAPTER XXI.,enthusiasm falling off and leaving her coarse features blank and bare.
4223,CHAPTER XXI.,
4224,CHAPTER XXI.,"""O, yes!"" answered Louise, her face brightening as she spoke, ""I believe"
4225,CHAPTER XXI.,"in Woman's Rights with all my heart and soul. Yet not in crowds, and"
4226,CHAPTER XXI.,"camps, and forums, where swarming multitudes are jostling to and fro;"
4227,CHAPTER XXI.,"and brawls, and shouts, and loud harangues make tumult in the air, do I"
4228,CHAPTER XXI.,"believe she finds her proper sphere. Not in halls of legislation, or"
4229,CHAPTER XXI.,"among empannelled juries, or yet within the sacred desk, would I behold"
4230,CHAPTER XXI.,"the form of woman. No, no! what sight so revolting to a refined"
4231,CHAPTER XXI.,"soul--whether it dwell in male or female bosom--as unsexed womanhood,"
4232,CHAPTER XXI.,"booted and spurred, parading over rostrums, brawling in debates, and"
4233,CHAPTER XXI.,spouting sophistical sentiments on subjects of whose true signification
4234,CHAPTER XXI.,they are as ignorant as an idiot of the laughter and derision his babble
4235,CHAPTER XXI.,"excites? O, 'tis woman's thrice-beautiful right to relieve and succor"
4236,CHAPTER XXI.,"the care-worn and distressed, wherever on this goodly earth they fall"

4407,CHAPTER XXIII.,"Florence Howard sat in a deep-cushioned fauteuil, beside a marble table"
4408,CHAPTER XXIII.,which graced the centre of the elegant apartment she called her own. A
4409,CHAPTER XXIII.,"loose robe, of India cashmere, in superb colors, with a lining of the"
4410,CHAPTER XXIII.,"softest, rose-colored velvet, was folded carelessly about her graceful"
4411,CHAPTER XXIII.,"form. One white hand toyed with the luxuriant chestnut curls, that hung"
4412,CHAPTER XXIII.,in beautiful profusion over her shoulders; the other rested lightly on
4413,CHAPTER XXIII.,the cushioned arm of the chair. A quantity of rich writing materials
4414,CHAPTER XXIII.,were spread out on the table before her; but she glanced towards them
4415,CHAPTER XXIII.,"listlessly, and at length bowed her queenly head between her hands, and"
4416,CHAPTER XXIII.,"sat a long time still and silent, as if absorbed in reverie. Ever and"
4417,CHAPTER XXIII.,"anon her little foot tapped impatiently the soft carpet beneath it, as"
4418,CHAPTER XXIII.,"though some harassing, unpleasant vision disturbed her brain. The clear,"
4419,CHAPTER XXIII.,ringing chimes of the college clock finally aroused her to
4420,CHAPTER XXIII.,consciousness.
4421,CHAPTER XXIII.,
4422,CHAPTER XXIII.,"Rising, she drew aside the heavy folds of the damask curtain, and gazed"
4423,CHAPTER XXIII.,"for a moment forth on the sleeping earth. The stars were bright, and a"
4424,CHAPTER XXIII.,slender crescent rim hung just above the dark cedar forest that swept
4425,CHAPTER XXIII.,"and swayed to the northward. Florence dropped the curtain, and,"
4426,CHAPTER XXIII.,"returning to the table, opened a large morocco-bound volume, which"
4427,CHAPTER XXIII.,"revealed a virgin page. Twirling the silver top from a carved, mosaic"
4428,CHAPTER XXIII.,"inkstand, she dipped the golden tips of a pearl-handled pen in its ebon"
4429,CHAPTER XXIII.,"contents, and holding it between her small, taper fingers, rested her"
4430,CHAPTER XXIII.,"arm a few moments on the stand, as if waiting for her thoughts to form"
4431,CHAPTER XXIII.,and arrange themselves ere she gave them expression. Suddenly the pen
4432,CHAPTER XXIII.,"dashed off, and line after line of graceful characters grew on the pure,"
4433,CHAPTER XXIII.,white page till it was completely filled.
4434,CHAPTER XXIII.,
4435,CHAPTER XXIII.,"""I have looked out on the midnight,"" she wrote, ""with all its countless"

4453,CHAPTER XXIII.,style. I was quite indignant to hear so much eloquence and refinement
4454,CHAPTER XXIII.,"wasted on a churl like him, and just malicious enough to think the fair"
4455,CHAPTER XXIII.,speaker would have preferred to say her pretty things in the ear of one

4461,CHAPTER XXIII.,a son. Silly-pated fellow! he has made love to me several times. I say
4462,CHAPTER XXIII.,"_made_ it, and truthfully; for no such simpleton as he could ever"

4465,CHAPTER XXIII.,"and yet, should he propose for me to my father, I fear the result would"
4466,CHAPTER XXIII.,"be his acceptance. He has wealth and position, and I know father has a"

4599,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4600,CHAPTER XXIV.,Such were the contents of the letter which the hermit perused several
4601,CHAPTER XXIV.,"times ere he folded it, and turned his attention to the boy, who was"
4602,CHAPTER XXIV.,"still sitting by the small window, gazing forth into the windy night."
4603,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4604,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""William,"" said he--and the lad approached."
4605,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4606,CHAPTER XXIV.,Something seemed trembling on the thin lips of the recluse which he
4607,CHAPTER XXIV.,"hesitated to reveal. At length, as if suddenly changing his purpose, he"
4608,CHAPTER XXIV.,"said: ""Do you think your mother is comfortable, to-night, my boy?"""
4609,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4610,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""O, yes, sir!"" answered Willie, ""the large bundle of sticks you left at"
4611,CHAPTER XXIV.,"her door yesterday evening will keep her warm for several days."""
4612,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4613,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""I hope they may,"" returned the hermit; ""'tis a sad thing to be poor,"
4614,CHAPTER XXIV.,"Willie, but 'tis a sadder thing to be wicked."""
4615,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4616,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""You do not think my mother is wicked, do you?"" asked the boy, turning"
4617,CHAPTER XXIV.,his blue eyes quickly on the hermit's countenance.
4618,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4619,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Why do you ask?"" said he, returning Willie's startled glance with a"
4620,CHAPTER XXIV.,grave smile.
4621,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4622,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Because I knew Mr. Pimble's folks said harsh things of her, and I"
4623,CHAPTER XXIV.,"didn't know but you believed them, as you never chose to enter our"
4624,CHAPTER XXIV.,"humble abode."""
4625,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4626,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""My gloomy disposition is averse to intercourse with the generality of"
4627,CHAPTER XXIV.,"my species,"" returned the hermit, in a solemn tone; ""nor do I ever heed"
4628,CHAPTER XXIV.,or hear the tales and gossipings of idle lips. In the last ten years I
4629,CHAPTER XXIV.,"have held no converse with any human beings, save you and your ---- and"
4630,CHAPTER XXIV.,"my nephew, Edgar Lindenwood."""
4631,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4632,CHAPTER XXIV.,"Willie gazed on the strange man before him in silent awe. ""Has your"
4633,CHAPTER XXIV.,"mother ever expressed a wish to see me?"" inquired the hermit, after a"
4634,CHAPTER XXIV.,pause.
4635,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4636,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Often,"" said Willie."
4637,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4638,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""For what purpose?"" demanded the recluse, in a quick, sudden tone,"
4639,CHAPTER XXIV.,looking eagerly on the boy's face.
4640,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4641,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""To thank you for all your kindness to her,"" replied the lad,"
4642,CHAPTER XXIV.,ingenuously.
4643,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4644,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""O, yes!"" returned the solitary man, his features relapsing into their"
4645,CHAPTER XXIV.,"usual placid serenity. ""I wish not, nor deserve, her thanks for the"
4646,CHAPTER XXIV.,"humble charities given. Let us seek our couch, my boy."""
4647,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4648,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Have you another name than William?"" he asked, as they were lying down."
4649,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4650,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Yes,"" answered the youth; ""William Ralph is my name,--the first for my"
4651,CHAPTER XXIV.,"father, the second for an uncle who went to distant countries, ere I can"
4652,CHAPTER XXIV.,"remember, and has never been heard of since."""
4653,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4654,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Was the uncle your father's or mother's brother?"" inquired the hermit,"
4655,CHAPTER XXIV.,in a careless tone.
4656,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4657,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""My mother's. Ralph Greyson was his name."""
4658,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4659,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""And does your mother appear to mourn his loss, or wish for his return?"""
4660,CHAPTER XXIV.,"said the hermit, still in the same careless, half-absorbed tone of"
4661,CHAPTER XXIV.,voice.
4662,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4663,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""She speaks pityingly of him sometimes, for he was a bright, promising"
4664,CHAPTER XXIV.,"youth, she says, when one distressful circumstance crushed his hopes and"
4665,CHAPTER XXIV.,"ruined his usefulness; but I do not think she desires his return, for he"
4666,CHAPTER XXIV.,"left his native shores cursing her as the cause of his misfortunes."""
4667,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4668,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""Ah! how had she caused his misfortunes?"" asked the hermit, drowsily."
4669,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4670,CHAPTER XXIV.,"""By marrying below her sphere,"" said Willie, in a trembling, embarrassed"
4671,CHAPTER XXIV.,"tone; ""a man who proved a vulgar sot, and thus disgracing him in the"
4672,CHAPTER XXIV.,"eyes of a proud family, with whom he sought an alliance."""
4673,CHAPTER XXIV.,
4674,CHAPTER XXIV.,"As Willie ceased speaking, the hermit breathed heavily, as if in deep"
4675,CHAPTER XXIV.,"sleep; so, turning his face to the cedar-plaited wall, the lad was soon"
4676,CHAPTER XXIV.,"wrapped in his own sweet, youthful slumbers."

4686,CHAPTER XXV.,"Of the current of life more sluggish and slow,"
4687,CHAPTER XXV.,"And a ghastly glare in the glassy eye,"

4689,CHAPTER XXV.,
4690,CHAPTER XXV.,
4691,CHAPTER XXV.,"In the dim gloom of a soft spring evening, a slender, graceful form bent"
4692,CHAPTER XXV.,"silently over a low, curtained couch, gently fanning the annoying"
4693,CHAPTER XXV.,insects from the pale brow of its slumbering occupant. The apartment was
4694,CHAPTER XXV.,furnished with almost princely magnificence. Curtains of the richest
4695,CHAPTER XXV.,"blue-wrought damask, hung in massy folds from ceiling to floor, before"
4696,CHAPTER XXV.,"the deep bay-windows. Rosewood sofas and fauteuils, in costly coverings"
4697,CHAPTER XXV.,"of the same soft color, rested on the brilliantly interwoven flowers of"
4698,CHAPTER XXV.,"the Persian carpet, whose velvety softness echoed not the slightest"
4699,CHAPTER XXV.,"tread. A fairy chandelier hung suspended from the lofty, corniced"
4700,CHAPTER XXV.,ceiling. Rare statuary decorated the mantel. Large mirrors and pictures
4701,CHAPTER XXV.,"in broad gilt frames adorned the walls. Marble stands, covered with"
4702,CHAPTER XXV.,"deep-fringed cloths of gold, on which lay books in superb bindings,"
4703,CHAPTER XXV.,"graced the several corners, and the carved mahogany bedstead, behind"
4704,CHAPTER XXV.,"whose ample curtains of azure velvet the sleeper reposed, among"
4705,CHAPTER XXV.,"white-piled cushions of softest down, vied in elegant luxury with the"
4706,CHAPTER XXV.,"couch of an eastern princess. And there, with one white, wasted arm"
4707,CHAPTER XXV.,"thrown above the head, all shorn of its bright wealth of auburn curls,"
4708,CHAPTER XXV.,"and the other concealed 'neath the silken coverings, lay Edith Malcome,"
4709,CHAPTER XXV.,"the blue veins almost starting from her pale brow, and a bright crimson"
4710,CHAPTER XXV.,"spot on the sunken cheek. Alas, that earth's most lovely should fall the"
4711,CHAPTER XXV.,earliest victims to the withering hand of disease! The door did softly
4712,CHAPTER XXV.,"asunder, and her father entered. With an expression of deep care and"
4713,CHAPTER XXV.,"suffering depicted on his handsome features, he approached the bed-side."
4714,CHAPTER XXV.,
4715,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Is she still sleeping?"" demanded he, in a whisper which would have been"
4716,CHAPTER XXV.,inaudible to an ear less quick than that of the silent watcher.
4717,CHAPTER XXV.,
4718,CHAPTER XXV.,"""She is,"" was the ready answer, in the same hushed tone. He gazed"
4719,CHAPTER XXV.,"intently for several moments on the attenuated form before him, while"
4720,CHAPTER XXV.,every variety of expression passed over his countenance.
4721,CHAPTER XXV.,
4722,CHAPTER XXV.,"""If she dies,"" said he, at length, in a voice broken with grief, ""what"
4723,CHAPTER XXV.,"will be left on earth to me?"""
4724,CHAPTER XXV.,
4725,CHAPTER XXV.,"The watcher was deeply affected by his grief-stricken appearance. ""O,"
4726,CHAPTER XXV.,"speak not thus!"" she said, bursting into tears. ""She will not die; the"
4727,CHAPTER XXV.,doctor has given us better hopes to-day. But even if she were to be
4728,CHAPTER XXV.,"taken to her home in the skies, you must not say there's nothing left on"
4729,CHAPTER XXV.,"earth for you. You, so bright in soul and intellect, surrounded by"

4732,CHAPTER XXV.,
4733,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Say no more,"" interrupted the afflicted man. ""I cannot endure your"
4734,CHAPTER XXV.,"words."""
4735,CHAPTER XXV.,
4736,CHAPTER XXV.,Louise was grieved to see she had only wounded where she meant to
4737,CHAPTER XXV.,"soothe, and, with a gentle, impulsive movement, placed her hand on the"
4738,CHAPTER XXV.,soft black curls of the head that was bowed among the cushions of the
4739,CHAPTER XXV.,"bed, and said, ""Forgive me, I meant not to afflict."""
4740,CHAPTER XXV.,
4741,CHAPTER XXV.,"Silently he took the little hand in his, and placed it on his throbbing"
4742,CHAPTER XXV.,temples. Louise trembled.
4743,CHAPTER XXV.,
4744,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Your brow is feverish,"" said she at length, seeking an excuse to"
4745,CHAPTER XXV.,"withdraw the imprisoned hand; ""let me bathe it in some cooling lotion."""
4746,CHAPTER XXV.,
4747,CHAPTER XXV.,"""No,"" said he, ""this moist little palm is better than any lotion,"" still"
4748,CHAPTER XXV.,"detaining it, as she sought to reach the stand which contained a"
4749,CHAPTER XXV.,quantity of vials on a silver tray. The slight movements aroused Edith.
4750,CHAPTER XXV.,"Opening her large, spiritual eyes, she gazed up in the faces of the"
4751,CHAPTER XXV.,"watchers at her bed-side, with a vague, dreamy expression."
4752,CHAPTER XXV.,
4753,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Don't you know me, Edith?"" asked her father, bending quickly over her."
4754,CHAPTER XXV.,
4755,CHAPTER XXV.,"""O, yes, father!"" answered she faintly; ""and that lady is my mother,"""
4756,CHAPTER XXV.,"she added, staring confusedly upon Louise, as if not yet in full"
4757,CHAPTER XXV.,possession of her waking faculties.
4758,CHAPTER XXV.,
4759,CHAPTER XXV.,"Louise looked embarrassed, and the colonel hastened to say, ""That is"
4760,CHAPTER XXV.,"Mrs. Edson, my dear, who watches with you to-night. You are wandering a"

4762,CHAPTER XXV.,
4763,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Well, where is my mother, then?"" continued Edith, in the same strange"
4764,CHAPTER XXV.,"manner, which appeared to agitate her father deeply."
4765,CHAPTER XXV.,
4766,CHAPTER XXV.,"""My child,"" said he, in a soothing tone, ""have I not often told you your"
4767,CHAPTER XXV.,"mother died when you was a very little girl?"""
4768,CHAPTER XXV.,
4769,CHAPTER XXV.,"""I don't know,"" said Edith, ""but last night I dreamed she came with a"
4770,CHAPTER XXV.,pale face and bloody lips and stared so mournfully upon me. I wish you
4771,CHAPTER XXV.,"would go and bring her to me, father."""
4772,CHAPTER XXV.,
4773,CHAPTER XXV.,"""My daughter, do I not tell you she is in her grave?"" said the father,"
4774,CHAPTER XXV.,"trembling with emotion. ""How can I bring her to you?"""
4775,CHAPTER XXV.,
4776,CHAPTER XXV.,"""Hannah Doliver told Rufus she would come if you would let her,"""
4777,CHAPTER XXV.,"continued the sick girl, in a reproachful tone, apparently not"
4778,CHAPTER XXV.,understanding her father's words.
4779,CHAPTER XXV.,
4780,CHAPTER XXV.,"On hearing this, Col. Malcome started with a violent exclamation, which"
4781,CHAPTER XXV.,"alarmed Edith, and brought her at once into full possession of her"
4782,CHAPTER XXV.,"senses. Louise, who had marked, with her quick eye, the colonel's"
4783,CHAPTER XXV.,"strange excitement, approached and administered a reviving cordial to"
4784,CHAPTER XXV.,"the invalid. The father soon retired, leaving the watcher alone with her"
4785,CHAPTER XXV.,charge.
4786,CHAPTER XXV.,
4787,CHAPTER XXV.,"As the hours dragged slowly on, many were the thoughts which passed"
4788,CHAPTER XXV.,"through Mrs. Edson's active brain, as to the cause of Edith's singular"
4789,CHAPTER XXV.,"words, and the anger and excitement evinced by her father. At length the"
4790,CHAPTER XXV.,"gray morning dawned, and Sylva, Edith's attendant, appeared to relieve"
4791,CHAPTER XXV.,the watcher from her post.
4792,CHAPTER XXV.,
4793,CHAPTER XXV.,"As Louise was passing through the hall to gain the street, the door"
4794,CHAPTER XXV.,"suddenly opened, and Col. Malcome entered in cap and overcoat. He paused"

4825,CHAPTER XXVI.,invalided Mrs. Howard when she was aware of the young man's presence in
4826,CHAPTER XXVI.,"the house. She had never met him, as her health, which had in the last"
4827,CHAPTER XXVI.,"six months rapidly declined, confined her now entirely to her room, and"
4828,CHAPTER XXVI.,indisposed her more strongly than ever to behold strange faces.
4829,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4830,CHAPTER XXVI.,"The only person she had ever been known to express a wish to see, since"

4833,CHAPTER XXVI.,"who was as different from Rufus, she said, ""as a sweet pink from an"
4834,CHAPTER XXVI.,"odious poppy."""
4835,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4836,CHAPTER XXVI.,"But Edith, strange as it may appear, had never visited at the Howards',"
4837,CHAPTER XXVI.,though often warmly invited by the whole family.
4838,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4839,CHAPTER XXVI.,"The colonel invariably excused her in his easy, graceful manner, saying"
4840,CHAPTER XXVI.,"she was ""a timid little thing, and dreaded to go for a moment from her"
4841,CHAPTER XXVI.,"father's side."" Latterly, her illness had been sufficient reason for her"
4842,CHAPTER XXVI.,seclusion.
4843,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4844,CHAPTER XXVI.,Florence was restricted from frequent visits to her sick friend by the
4845,CHAPTER XXVI.,"state of her own health, which had grown so feeble and delicate as to"
4846,CHAPTER XXVI.,"alarm her father exceedingly. Dr. Potipher was consulted, and strongly"
4847,CHAPTER XXVI.,advised travel and change of scene as the most effectual remedy for the
4848,CHAPTER XXVI.,feverish disease that seemed preying upon her constitution.
4849,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4850,CHAPTER XXVI.,"Major Howard was very willing to take his daughter on a tour of travel,"
4851,CHAPTER XXVI.,"but knew not how to leave his invalid lady, whose strength he thought to"
4852,CHAPTER XXVI.,be gradually failing. She was far too low for him to indulge the idea of
4853,CHAPTER XXVI.,"making her one of the party, and he was about relinquishing the project"
4854,CHAPTER XXVI.,"in despair, when, on mentioning the subject to the sick woman, great was"
4855,CHAPTER XXVI.,his surprise to find her even more anxious and earnest for his departure
4856,CHAPTER XXVI.,"than he was to go. She said ""she should do very well without him,--she"
4857,CHAPTER XXVI.,"always mended as summer approached, and Florence was drooping from long"
4858,CHAPTER XXVI.,"and close confinement. She needed exercise and change of scene, and it"
4859,CHAPTER XXVI.,was his duty to do all in his power to restore her to health and
4860,CHAPTER XXVI.,"cheerfulness."" Major Howard felt the only obstacle removed by the"
4861,CHAPTER XXVI.,invalid's assent and hearty coöperation; so Florence was informed of the
4862,CHAPTER XXVI.,"project, and preparations immediately commenced for her tour."
4863,CHAPTER XXVI.,
4864,CHAPTER XXVI.,It was a pleasant April evening as she sat in her luxurious apartment
4865,CHAPTER XXVI.,"with her journal open before her. ""The last of these bright spring"
4866,CHAPTER XXVI.,"evenings that I am to pass at home is closing in around me,"" she wrote."
4867,CHAPTER XXVI.,"""My trunks are packed and closed down, and to-morrow I am to start on a"
4868,CHAPTER XXVI.,tour of travel. How my long torpid bosom bounds at the thought! I shall
4869,CHAPTER XXVI.,sail up that picturesque Hudson! I shall look on glorious Niagara! But I
4870,CHAPTER XXVI.,fear my anticipations are too brilliant. Something will occur to dreg my
4871,CHAPTER XXVI.,expected draught of happiness with sorrow. Thus it has ever been! Too
4872,CHAPTER XXVI.,well I know I shall return to become the bride of one I detest; but I
4873,CHAPTER XXVI.,will not let that thought embitter my enjoyment of the wonders and
4874,CHAPTER XXVI.,"beauties I shall behold. Besides, in so long a time as I shall be"
4875,CHAPTER XXVI.,"absent, what may occur? Ah, I have written words that make me shudder! I"
4876,CHAPTER XXVI.,fear I may return to find the snows covering my mother's grave. Why do I
4877,CHAPTER XXVI.,leave her? Is it not selfishness to allow her to urge me away when it is
4878,CHAPTER XXVI.,her own generous care and affection for me which prompt her to do so?
4879,CHAPTER XXVI.,There is something strange in the way she speaks of my matrimonial
4880,CHAPTER XXVI.,"engagement. I am sure it does not meet her approval, though she gave her"
4881,CHAPTER XXVI.,"consent, as she always does to everything upon which father sets his"
4882,CHAPTER XXVI.,"mind. She evidently dreads its consummation, perhaps because she has"
4883,CHAPTER XXVI.,"discovered my aversion for the man I am to marry. As to Hannah Doliver,"
4884,CHAPTER XXVI.,she is wonderfully mollified toward me of late; but her fawning fondness
4885,CHAPTER XXVI.,is more intolerable than her asperity and impertinence. Nothing seems to
4886,CHAPTER XXVI.,delight her so much as to behold Rufus Malcome in company with me. I
4887,CHAPTER XXVI.,caught her watching at the parlor-door this evening when he called in
4888,CHAPTER XXVI.,company with his father to leave his adieus. She accompanied them to the
4889,CHAPTER XXVI.,door and remained several minutes in conversation in the hall. I found
4890,CHAPTER XXVI.,"her in the kitchen a short time after, and she was muttering to herself"
4891,CHAPTER XXVI.,and slamming things about in a great rage. When she discovered me she
4892,CHAPTER XXVI.,"ceased, and grew suddenly as sunny as summer. She is a strange, dark,"
4893,CHAPTER XXVI.,"intriguing woman, I fear, and wish we were well quit of her. I asked"
4894,CHAPTER XXVI.,"mother if she had not better discharge her, and get a new person to"
4895,CHAPTER XXVI.,"attend her during our absence; but she said, with a sudden expression of"
4896,CHAPTER XXVI.,"alarm, 'O, no; she would not part with Hannah on any account!' So I said"
4897,CHAPTER XXVI.,"no more, but fancied her preference was dictated more by fear than love."
4898,CHAPTER XXVI.,"But I spin out a long record for this last evening at home. O, budding"
4899,CHAPTER XXVI.,"vines and flowers! who will train your rich luxuriance into fairy,"
4900,CHAPTER XXVI.,"fantastic clusterings, or watch your opening petals in the summer which"
4901,CHAPTER XXVI.,"is to come? Who listen to the babbling fountains, or roam the cedar-walks"
4902,CHAPTER XXVI.,"that border the dancing river? And O, the far, far-stretching forest,"
4903,CHAPTER XXVI.,"from whose mysterious depths, in a bright year passed away, I saw _him_"
4904,CHAPTER XXVI.,"emerge, and hurried down the gravelled path to meet him at the"

4972,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4973,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""With the exception of one Mr. Richard Giblet,"" remarked Miss Pinkerton,"
4974,CHAPTER XXVII.,in a tone she conceived to be vastly witty and piquant.

4976,CHAPTER XXVII.,"Jenny's blush, as she bade good-morning, crowned the malicious maiden's"

4979,CHAPTER XXVII.,"On this same morning, Mrs. Edson sat at her elegant rosewood piano,"
4980,CHAPTER XXVII.,"carelessly striking the ivory keys, when she heard a light footstep, and"
4981,CHAPTER XXVII.,"turning, beheld Col. Malcome advancing to her side. She was a little"
4982,CHAPTER XXVII.,"angry that he had entered unannounced, and her cheeks flushed, as she"
4983,CHAPTER XXVII.,rather briefly bade him welcome.
4984,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4985,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""I beg your pardon for entering so informally,"" said he, at once"
4986,CHAPTER XXVII.,"interpreting the expression of her face. ""Your doors were all ajar, and"
4987,CHAPTER XXVII.,"I saw no one to announce me."""
4988,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4989,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""Had you rung, some one would have appeared,"" said Louise, with a slight"
4990,CHAPTER XXVII.,curl of her red lip.
4991,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4992,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""Well, I beg your pardon for not doing so,"" returned he. ""Will you grant"
4993,CHAPTER XXVII.,"it?"""
4994,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4995,CHAPTER XXVII.,"There was something in the rueful appearance he assumed, which forced"
4996,CHAPTER XXVII.,"her to laugh in spite of her efforts at dignity and restraint, and thus"
4997,CHAPTER XXVII.,he was reinstated in her good graces.
4998,CHAPTER XXVII.,
4999,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""Are you playing?"" he asked, touching his own fingers upon the keys, but"
5000,CHAPTER XXVII.,at a respectful distance from hers.
5001,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5002,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""No,"" she returned. ""I have practised so little of late I have lost all"
5003,CHAPTER XXVII.,"my ear. Won't you favor me with that thrilling piece from Beethoven, you"
5004,CHAPTER XXVII.,"performed on the first evening of our acquaintance?"" She looked eagerly"
5005,CHAPTER XXVII.,in his face as she spoke.
5006,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5007,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""What will you do for me if I will?"" he asked."
5008,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5009,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""O, anything in my power!"" she replied, rising, and motioning him to"
5010,CHAPTER XXVII.,"assume the music-stool, which he did very readily. Skilfully running"
5011,CHAPTER XXVII.,"over the keys, by way of prelude, while she stood leaning gracefully"
5012,CHAPTER XXVII.,"against the instrument, intently regarding his movements, he commenced"
5013,CHAPTER XXVII.,"the symphony. The swelling notes rose on the air in brilliant variety,"
5014,CHAPTER XXVII.,"and when, at the end of the second chorus, the rich, mellow tones of his"
5015,CHAPTER XXVII.,"voice were added, Louise dropped on her knees beside the performer,"
5016,CHAPTER XXVII.,while tears gathered in her eyes and rolled over her beautiful face. He
5017,CHAPTER XXVII.,"did not seem to heed her position, so intently was his soul occupied"
5018,CHAPTER XXVII.,with the music his lips were breathing. At length the last magic strain
5019,CHAPTER XXVII.,died mournfully away. Then he rested his deep blue eyes calmly on her
5020,CHAPTER XXVII.,glowing features.
5021,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5022,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""What shall I do for you?"" she asked, smiling."
5023,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5024,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""You promised,"" answered he, ""to do anything I wished, if I would sing"

5026,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5027,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""So I will,"" returned she, earnestly."
5028,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5029,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""Then,"" said he, in a low, thrilling tone, ""as Steerforth said to David,"
5030,CHAPTER XXVII.,"think of me at my best."""
5031,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5032,CHAPTER XXVII.,"She looked at him eagerly. ""Is that all?"" she asked."
5033,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5034,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""That is enough,"" he answered; ""will you promise _always_ to do that?"""
5035,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5036,CHAPTER XXVII.,"She paused a few moments, and then answered, in a tone which indicated"
5037,CHAPTER XXVII.,"her whole soul spoke in the words, ""Yes, I promise."""
5038,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5039,CHAPTER XXVII.,"""Thank you,"" said he, extending his hand."
5040,CHAPTER XXVII.,
5041,CHAPTER XXVII.,"She gave him hers. He held it a moment in his own. Then, pressing it"
5042,CHAPTER XXVII.,"respectfully to his lips, bade her good-morning, and retired."

5064,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"know whether to go up the Hudson, or hold straight on over the Erie road"

5071,CHAPTER XXVIII.,Howard and her father are already arrived and installed occupants of a

5081,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"attire, were already seated at the splendidly laid tables, every eye"

5083,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"in startling silks and astonishing ear-jewels, turned her nose sublimely"
5084,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"skyward and exclaimed ""No great fetch,--these folks!"" Gentlemen, in"

5098,CHAPTER XXVIII.,Florence seemed wholly regardless of the volleys of glances directed

5100,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"dessert, so great was her impatience of a nearer view of the sublime"
5101,CHAPTER XXVIII.,spectacle visible from the piazzas of the Clifton House.
5102,CHAPTER XXVIII.,
5103,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"On Table Rock she stood, with her father's arm cast protectingly around"

5106,CHAPTER XXVIII.,upon the floods that boiled and surged like fathomless seas of angry

5116,CHAPTER XXVIII.,
5117,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"""Are you not going to tea?"" asked her father."

5122,CHAPTER XXVIII.,
5123,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"Her father called her a little enthusiast, and walked away. Left to"

5125,CHAPTER XXVIII.,
5126,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"""Eventful day!"" she wrote. ""I have stood among the mists of Niagara."
5127,CHAPTER XXVIII.,Fain would I voice the tumult flood of emotions that rushed over my soul

5165,CHAPTER XXVIII.,"probably, did not notice me, or, if you did, my features would be easily"

5508,CHAPTER XXX.,
5509,CHAPTER XXX.,"The lady sat listlessly gazing on the lovely scene without, when a dark"

5512,CHAPTER XXX.,"closely-trimmed auburn hair that clustered in short, thick masses of"
5513,CHAPTER XXX.,"luxuriant curls around a high, pale brow, appeared before the casement,"
5514,CHAPTER XXX.,and fixed a bold stare upon her face. No sooner did her eyes encounter
5515,CHAPTER XXX.,"those that glared so fiercely upon her, than she uttered a piercing"
5516,CHAPTER XXX.,"shriek, and fell back in her chair with the appearance of one from whom"
5517,CHAPTER XXX.,all life had departed.
5518,CHAPTER XXX.,
5519,CHAPTER XXX.,Hannah rushed into the room and bore the insensible form of her mistress
5520,CHAPTER XXX.,"to the bed, where she commenced chafing her temples and pouring reviving"

5522,CHAPTER XXX.,and stared wildly around.
5523,CHAPTER XXX.,
5524,CHAPTER XXX.,"""Secure that casement,"" said she, pointing to the still open window;"

5535,CHAPTER XXX.,
5536,CHAPTER XXX.,"""I have seen _him_, Hannah Doliver,"" said the invalid, shuddering as she"

5545,CHAPTER XXX.,
5546,CHAPTER XXX.,"""I tell you I have seen him!"" returned the invalid, shaking like an"
5547,CHAPTER XXX.,"aspen on her couch. ""I cannot be mistaken. 'Twas his face; the high,"
5548,CHAPTER XXX.,"colorless brow, surrounded by thick, short auburn curls. He stood at"
5549,CHAPTER XXX.,"that casement, and gazed fiercely on me from his large, dark eyes."""
5550,CHAPTER XXX.,
5551,CHAPTER XXX.,"""Pshaw!"" said Hannah, ""'twas but a hideous dream, or a sudden attack of"

5554,CHAPTER XXX.,
5555,CHAPTER XXX.,"""Then it was his ghost that I saw,"" said the lady."
5556,CHAPTER XXX.,
5557,CHAPTER XXX.,"""May be it was,"" returned Hannah, smiling strangely; ""though I don't"

5590,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5591,CHAPTER XXXI.,"Even Mrs. Salsify, as one of the groom's former acquaintances, received"
5592,CHAPTER XXXI.,"an invite to the bridal feast, and appeared in red morocco shoes and a"
5593,CHAPTER XXXI.,cap whose ruffles were the astonishment of the entire assembly. Mary
5594,CHAPTER XXXI.,"Madeline's squealing baby detained her at home, and perhaps, also, she"
5595,CHAPTER XXXI.,"did not care to see her former lover, recreant and unfaithful though he"
5596,CHAPTER XXXI.,"had been to her, take the solemn vow of eternal constancy to another."
5597,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5598,CHAPTER XXXI.,The party was more lively than wedding parties usually are. Mrs. Edson
5599,CHAPTER XXXI.,"was everywhere, gliding, like the spirit of grace and beauty, among her"
5600,CHAPTER XXXI.,"guests, enlivening them by her humor, and spreading a rich glow of"
5601,CHAPTER XXXI.,"geniality through the apartments. If she ever outshone herself, and"
5602,CHAPTER XXXI.,"surpassed her own surpassing powers, it was to-night. Col. Malcome's"
5603,CHAPTER XXXI.,"eyes followed her wherever she moved, with an undisguisable expression"
5604,CHAPTER XXXI.,of admiration. He seemed rather cast in the shade by her unwonted
5605,CHAPTER XXXI.,"brilliancy, and held himself aloof from her side for almost the entire"
5606,CHAPTER XXXI.,evening.
5607,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5608,CHAPTER XXXI.,Miss Martha Pinkerton noticed him sitting alone and abstracted on a
5609,CHAPTER XXXI.,"sofa, and her kind soul was moved with pity for his companionless"
5610,CHAPTER XXXI.,"situation, so she resolved to cheer his solitude as well as she was"
5611,CHAPTER XXXI.,"able. Approaching, she assumed a seat on the opposite side of the sofa."
5612,CHAPTER XXXI.,"She looked at him, hemmed, and coughed, but he did not seem to heed her"

5625,CHAPTER XXXI.,"from undertaking, and that occasioned my forgetfulness of the package"
5626,CHAPTER XXXI.,"probably. I will call soon and relieve you of it."""
5627,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5628,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""O, 'tis no burden,"" she answered; ""I only thought I would speak to you"
5629,CHAPTER XXXI.,about it to let you know 'twas ready any time you might choose to call.
5630,CHAPTER XXXI.,"Don't you think the bride looks very beautiful?"" she added, turning the"
5631,CHAPTER XXXI.,discourse to more elegant subjects now she had gained his ear.
5632,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5633,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Ay, quite interesting and pretty,"" answered he, turning his attention"

5644,CHAPTER XXXI.,"group was just passing, and the colonel effected his escape from his"
5645,CHAPTER XXXI.,fair companion and joined them. Several voices called for him at the
5646,CHAPTER XXXI.,"piano, and, seating himself before the instrument, he commenced a"
5647,CHAPTER XXXI.,brilliant performance. In a few moments he became conscious of the form
5648,CHAPTER XXXI.,"of Louise standing in the embrasure of a window near by, her whole soul"

5650,CHAPTER XXXI.,"sauntered slowly to the hall door, and stepped forth upon the piazza. As"
5651,CHAPTER XXXI.,"he paced slowly down its marble length he came suddenly upon her,"
5652,CHAPTER XXXI.,leaning languidly against a vine-covered column.
5653,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5654,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Why do you fly your guests?"" asked he; ""they will soon grow dim without"

5679,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Let us return to the house,"" said he at length."
5680,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5681,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""What for?"" she asked, turning her clear eyes quickly on his face."
5682,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5683,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Because you do not enjoy your company,"" he answered."
5684,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5685,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""No, that is not the reason,"" said she; ""'tis because you are weary of"

5687,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5688,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Weary of your presence!"" repeated he. ""Louise, you don't believe your"

5690,CHAPTER XXXI.,
5691,CHAPTER XXXI.,"""Certainly,"" answered she."

5746,CHAPTER XXXII.,nature and affectionate heart.
5747,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5748,CHAPTER XXXII.,A storm set in on the night of our party's arrival at the Crawford
5749,CHAPTER XXXII.,"House, and heavy clouds settled down over the brows of the great"
5750,CHAPTER XXXII.,mountains that hemmed in the narrow valley. The hotel was thronged with
5751,CHAPTER XXXII.,"visitors, and the new comers had to accept of such accommodations as two"
5752,CHAPTER XXXII.,small rooms in the upper story could afford.
5753,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5754,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""I declare,"" exclaimed Ellen, when the porters had brought in the"
5755,CHAPTER XXXII.,"trunks, thrown back the fastenings, and retired, ""after rackings, and"
5756,CHAPTER XXXII.,"tossings, and tumblings enough to disjoint and unhinge a leviathan, to"
5757,CHAPTER XXXII.,"what a comfortless haven are we arrived at last! O, for a tithe of the"
5758,CHAPTER XXXII.,"luxury I rolled in at Niagara and Saratoga, or even one of the"
5759,CHAPTER XXXII.,state-rooms of the 'Hendrick Hudson' or 'Belle of the Waters!' They were
5760,CHAPTER XXXII.,rooms of state indeed compared with these dismal little pens. How are we
5761,CHAPTER XXXII.,"going to turn round in them, Florence, much less unload our trunks of"
5762,CHAPTER XXXII.,their wardrobes and array ourselves for appearance in the parlors and
5763,CHAPTER XXXII.,"dining saloon?"""
5764,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5765,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Dear me!"" answered Florence, as she stood before the window, blowing"
5766,CHAPTER XXXII.,"her benumbed fingers, ""I don't think we shall have any occasion to open"
5767,CHAPTER XXXII.,"our trunks, for there is not a frock in mine I could venture to put on,"
5768,CHAPTER XXXII.,"unless I was willing to be frozen to death within the hour."""
5769,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5770,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""But what are we to do?"" said Ellen, approaching the other window and"
5771,CHAPTER XXXII.,"gazing forth on the dark, stormy evening, that was rapidly closing in"
5772,CHAPTER XXXII.,around them. Nothing could be seen beyond the small circle of the valley
5773,CHAPTER XXXII.,"in which the house stood, save dense clouds of fog and mist. The rain"
5774,CHAPTER XXXII.,"poured like a second deluge, and terrific winds roared, and shrieked,"
5775,CHAPTER XXXII.,and bellowed like infuriate spirits of the rushing storm.
5776,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5777,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""What geese we have made of ourselves, Florence!"" resumed Ellen, after"
5778,CHAPTER XXXII.,she had gazed in silence a few moments on the gloomy prospect presented
5779,CHAPTER XXXII.,"to her eyes; ""jamming into crowded, uncomfortable coaches, and bruising"
5780,CHAPTER XXXII.,"and battering our flesh and bones to jelly, all to reach this wonderful"
5781,CHAPTER XXXII.,abode of grandeur and sublimity. What 'Alps on Alps' we expected would
5782,CHAPTER XXXII.,"tower before our astonished visions! But here we are, sunk in a dismal"
5783,CHAPTER XXXII.,"abyss on the extreme northern verge of civilization, and never a"
5784,CHAPTER XXXII.,"mountain to be seen, or anything else save great lowering clouds that"
5785,CHAPTER XXXII.,"threaten to fall and crush us yet deeper into the earth."""
5786,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5787,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""If I could only get to see the mountains, I would not mind all the"
5788,CHAPTER XXXII.,"discomfitures,"" said Florence, peering into the growing blackness"
5789,CHAPTER XXXII.,without.
5790,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5791,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""I tell you there are no mountains,"" said Ellen, growing impatient in"
5792,CHAPTER XXXII.,her disappointment.
5793,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5794,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""O, yes,"" returned Florence; ""I think there must be a few somewhere in"
5795,CHAPTER XXXII.,"the vicinity."""
5796,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5797,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Then why can't we see them?"" demanded Ellen."
5798,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5799,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""They are hidden by the clouds, I suppose,"" said Florence. ""I am told"
5800,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Mount Washington is veiled in their fleecy mantles for weeks sometimes."""
5801,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5802,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""No doubt it will be thus obscured during our visit,"" said Ellen, quite"
5803,CHAPTER XXXII.,petulantly.
5804,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5805,CHAPTER XXXII.,"A knock on the door here called their attention. Florence opened it, and"
5806,CHAPTER XXXII.,"beheld her father, ""Well, girls,"" said he, rubbing his hands, ""what do"
5807,CHAPTER XXXII.,"you think of the White Mountains?"""
5808,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5809,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""When we have seen them we shall be better prepared to give an opinion,"""
5810,CHAPTER XXXII.,said Florence.
5811,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5812,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""For my part, I don't believe in them at all,"" said Ellen quickly."
5813,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5814,CHAPTER XXXII.,Major Howard laughed heartily at this pertly announced conviction of the
5815,CHAPTER XXXII.,"non-existence of the wonderful summits they had come to behold, and said"
5816,CHAPTER XXXII.,"he trusted, ""when the storm was over, the elephants would show their"
5817,CHAPTER XXXII.,"terrible heads."""
5818,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5819,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""But are not you half frozen?"" asked he, his teeth chattering as he"
5820,CHAPTER XXXII.,"spoke; ""pray come down in the parlors; you will find them warm and"
5821,CHAPTER XXXII.,"filled with guests."""
5822,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5823,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""We cannot go in our travelling garbs,"" said Ellen, ""and there's no"
5824,CHAPTER XXXII.,"opportunity here, as you see, to open our trunks."""
5825,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5826,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Never mind your dark dresses,"" returned he; ""you will not find the"
5827,CHAPTER XXXII.,gossamer fabrics that deck the belles of Saratoga in fashion here. The
5828,CHAPTER XXXII.,"fair creatures, however much in defiance of their wishes, are obliged to"
5829,CHAPTER XXXII.,"conceal their white arms and shoulders in thick warm coverings."""
5830,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5831,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""We would be very glad to do so,"" said Florence; ""but unfortunately our"
5832,CHAPTER XXXII.,"wardrobes were prepared for a temperate, instead of a frigid zone."""
5833,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5834,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Well, you will do very well as you are to-night; there are a score of"
5835,CHAPTER XXXII.,"ladies just arrived, all round the parlor fires, in their travel-stained"
5836,CHAPTER XXXII.,"garbs; so come on,"" said he, ""and don't be bashful. You will hear the"
5837,CHAPTER XXXII.,"conversation of those who have passed half the summer in this region,"
5838,CHAPTER XXXII.,"and perhaps Ellen may come to believe in old Mount Washington."""
5839,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5840,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""I shall never believe in it till I have seen it with my own eyes,"""
5841,CHAPTER XXXII.,"returned the fair girl, as she and Florence, under the escort of Major"
5842,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Howard, descended the flights of stairs to the parlor."
5843,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5844,CHAPTER XXXII.,"As they entered, a hum of voices struck their ears from every side."
5845,CHAPTER XXXII.,"There was a group of ladies and gentlemen round the fire, and several of"
5846,CHAPTER XXXII.,them vacated their seats for the convenience of the new comers. A large
5847,CHAPTER XXXII.,woman with a very red face remained in one corner and a young girl sat
5848,CHAPTER XXXII.,by her side.
5849,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5850,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Have you just arrived?"" asked the former of Florence; who was nearest"
5851,CHAPTER XXXII.,her.
5852,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5853,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Yes, madam,"" returned Florence, respectfully."
5854,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5855,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Well, it is a dismal time for strangers to make their advent, though"
5856,CHAPTER XXXII.,"the largest arrivals most always occur on such nights as this,"" said the"
5857,CHAPTER XXXII.,"fleshy woman, who had rather a pleasant manner, and would have been very"
5858,CHAPTER XXXII.,"good-looking, Florence thought, but for the rough redness of her"
5859,CHAPTER XXXII.,complexion.
5860,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5861,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Are such storms frequent here?"" inquired Ellen, in a dubious tone."
5862,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5863,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Not very,"" answered the portly lady. ""I have been here six weeks, and"
5864,CHAPTER XXXII.,have not witnessed so severe a one hitherto. I think myself rather
5865,CHAPTER XXXII.,"unfortunate to have been exposed to its severity all day."""
5866,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5867,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Ellen and Florence looked surprised, and the lady continued: ""Myself and"
5868,CHAPTER XXXII.,daughter joined a large party that ascended the mountains yesterday. We
5869,CHAPTER XXXII.,"had a tedious time. I lost my veil, and my face was frozen by exposure"
5870,CHAPTER XXXII.,to the biting blasts. The storm came on so furiously we were obliged to
5871,CHAPTER XXXII.,"send our horses back by the guides and remain all night."""
5872,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5873,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""What!"" exclaimed Ellen, ""remain all night on the top of a mountain"
5874,CHAPTER XXXII.,"exposed to a storm like this! Why did you not all perish?"""
5875,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5876,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""O, we had shelter, and a good one!"" returned the lady."
5877,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5878,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Where was it? In caves of rocks, or on cold, wet turfs beneath reeking"
5879,CHAPTER XXXII.,"branches of lofty pines?"" asked Ellen."
5880,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5881,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Not in caves,"" answered the lady, ""and certainly not on grassy turfs,"
5882,CHAPTER XXXII.,or beneath trees of any variety; for old Mount Washington's bleak summit
5883,CHAPTER XXXII.,"cannot boast the one or the other."""
5884,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5885,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""What can it boast, then?"" inquired Ellen; ""wolves and catamounts, that,"
5886,CHAPTER XXXII.,"together with its shrieking winds, make night hideous?"""
5887,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5888,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Not wolves, or animals of any species,"" returned the lady, shaking her"
5889,CHAPTER XXXII.,"head; ""but of huge masses of granite boulders, gray and moss-grown,"
5890,CHAPTER XXXII.,"heaped in gigantic piles, that eternally defy the blasts and storms of"
5891,CHAPTER XXXII.,"the fiercest boreal winters."""
5892,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5893,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""O, what a grand thing it must be to stand on its summit!"" exclaimed"
5894,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Florence, with glistening eyes."
5895,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5896,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""It is, indeed,"" said the lady, ""though I have been pelted by the"
5897,CHAPTER XXXII.,"merciless storm all day, which added fresh difficulties to the descent,"
5898,CHAPTER XXXII.,"and still suffer much from my poor, frozen cheeks, I do not for a moment"
5899,CHAPTER XXXII.,"regret my journey. I suppose you young ladies intend to ascend?"""
5900,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5901,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""I do,"" said Ellen. ""If there is anything here worth seeing, I wish to"
5902,CHAPTER XXXII.,"see it, after all the fatigue and trouble of getting here."""
5903,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5904,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""O, well,"" returned the lady, ""I assure you there is enough to see. I"
5905,CHAPTER XXXII.,"have been here, as I have already informed you, six weeks, and some new"
5906,CHAPTER XXXII.,wonder bursts upon me every day. You are a little disappointed from
5907,CHAPTER XXXII.,"having been so unfortunate as to arrive on this gloomy evening, when"
5908,CHAPTER XXXII.,even the nearest views are obscured by clouds. But the guides predict a
5909,CHAPTER XXXII.,splendid day to-morrow. I am sure you will be delighted in the morning
5910,CHAPTER XXXII.,when you rise and behold the great clouds rolling away their heavy
5911,CHAPTER XXXII.,"masses and revealing the broad, dark summits of the mountains that hem"
5912,CHAPTER XXXII.,in this grassy valley. I shall watch to see you dance into the breakfast
5913,CHAPTER XXXII.,"hall in buoyant spirits."""
5914,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5915,CHAPTER XXXII.,With a pleasant good-evening the lady retired. Florence and Ellen soon
5916,CHAPTER XXXII.,"followed. In the upper space they met Major Howard and young Williams,"
5917,CHAPTER XXXII.,who were hastening to join them in the parlor.
5918,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5919,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""Well, sis,"" said Edward, ""Major Howard tells me you vote the White"
5920,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Mountains all humbug."""
5921,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5922,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""I think Ellen is growing less sceptical,"" said Florence, ""since she has"
5923,CHAPTER XXXII.,"conversed with a lady who has just descended from their summits."""
5924,CHAPTER XXXII.,
5925,CHAPTER XXXII.,"""O, yes, Nell, there's a Mount Washington, sure as fate,"" returned"
5926,CHAPTER XXXII.,"Edward, ""and we must ascend its craggy steeps to-morrow; so retire, and"
5927,CHAPTER XXXII.,get a refreshing rest to be ready for the fatiguing excursion in the
5928,CHAPTER XXXII.,"morning."""

5942,SONG.,
5943,SONG.,The sun rose bright above the mountains of the Crawford Notch on the
5944,SONG.,"following morning, and illuminated with his brilliant rays all the green"
5945,SONG.,valley below. Each member of the large party that proposed to ascend
5946,SONG.,"Mount Washington was at an early hour mounted on a strong-built pony,"
5947,SONG.,and led by a guide into the bridle-path which commenced in the woods at
5948,SONG.,the base of Mount Clinton. Our little band of travellers were foremost
5949,SONG.,"in the file, Florence and Ellen in the greatest glee of laughter and"
5950,SONG.,spirits.
5951,SONG.,
5952,SONG.,"The whole ascent of Clinton was through a dense forest, over a rough,"
5953,SONG.,"uneven path, constructed of small, round timbers, called ""corduroys."""
5954,SONG.,"They were in a rotted, dilapidated condition, and unpleasant as well as"
5955,SONG.,dangerous to ride over.
5956,SONG.,
5957,SONG.,"Emerging from the woods that covered Clinton, the surrounding mountains"
5958,SONG.,began to appear; and from the grassy plain on the summit of Mount
5959,SONG.,"Pleasant, a view was obtained which called forth rapturous shouts from"
5960,SONG.,the whole company.
5961,SONG.,
5962,SONG.,The descent of Pleasant was tedious. All the ladies were obliged to
5963,SONG.,"dismount, as the path was very rough, and often almost perpendicular"
5964,SONG.,"over precipitous rocks, while the frightful chasm that yawned far below"
5965,SONG.,caused many of the adventurers to grow giddy and pale with fear.
5966,SONG.,
5967,SONG.,"Ellen, who was rather timid, began to wish she had remained in the"
5968,SONG.,"valley, and continued to disbelieve in mountains; but Florence was all"
5969,SONG.,exhilaration and eagerness to push onward.
5970,SONG.,
5971,SONG.,"Mount Franklin towered next before them. As Florence, who was among the"
5972,SONG.,"foremost, reached its summit, she turned on her pony, and gazed down on"
5973,SONG.,"the little cavalcade, winding along up the narrow, precipitous path in"
5974,SONG.,"single file, with the guides hurrying from one bridle to another, as a"
5975,SONG.,more difficult and dangerous place occurred in the rough way. And she
5976,SONG.,"thought of Napoleon leading an army over the mighty Alps, and how"
5977,SONG.,dauntless and sublime must be the soul of a man who could successfully
5978,SONG.,accomplish an enterprise so fraught with perilous hazard and
5979,SONG.,disheartening fatigue.
5980,SONG.,
5981,SONG.,As the little company wound their way over the unsheltered brow of Mount
5982,SONG.,"Franklin, tremendous blasts swept down from the summits above, and"
5983,SONG.,"threatened to unseat them in their saddles, or hurl the whole party over"
5984,SONG.,the fearful gulfs that yawned on every side. The guides collected the
5985,SONG.,band together and informed them half their journey was completed. Many a
5986,SONG.,face grew blank with dismay at this announcement. The weather wore a
5987,SONG.,"less promising aspect than when they set out, and the winds pierced them"
5988,SONG.,through and through. Several proposed to turn back. The guides said
5989,SONG.,there was about an even chance for the clouds to blow over or gather
5990,SONG.,"into a storm, and the party could settle the point among themselves"
5991,SONG.,whether they would turn back or go on.
5992,SONG.,
5993,SONG.,"A gentleman, with features so muffled she could not discover them, rode"
5994,SONG.,"to the side of Florence, and said, in a voice she could barely"
5995,SONG.,"distinguish among the clamorous winds that howled over the mountain, ""Do"
5996,SONG.,you favor the project of returning tamely to the valley and leaving
5997,SONG.,"Mount Washington a wonder unrevealed?"""
5998,SONG.,
5999,SONG.,"""No!"" answered she, from beneath her thick veil; the muscles of her face"
6000,SONG.,so stiffened with cold she could hardly move her lips.
6001,SONG.,
6002,SONG.,"""Then ride your pony to the centre of these dissenting groups and"
6003,SONG.,"propose to move on,"" said he. ""There are none in the party so"
6004,SONG.,"craven-souled as to shrink from what a lady dares encounter."""
6005,SONG.,
6006,SONG.,"Florence paused a moment, and then guided her pony into the midst of the"
6007,SONG.,company.
6008,SONG.,
6009,SONG.,"""Do you wish to join those who are going back, Miss?"" said a guide,"
6010,SONG.,taking hold of her bridle-rein.
6011,SONG.,
6012,SONG.,"""No!"" said she in a tone of decision. ""I'll lead the way for those who"
6013,SONG.,"choose to follow to the summit of Mount Washington."""
6014,SONG.,
6015,SONG.,"""Bravo!""--""hurrah!""--""let us on!""--burst from all sides. Three solitary"
6016,SONG.,"ones, among them Ellen Williams, turned back, and the others formed into"
6017,SONG.,file and moved onward. Down Mount Franklin and over the narrow path cut
6018,SONG.,"in the cragged side of Monroe, where a single misstep would hurl the"
6019,SONG.,"horse and rider down a fathomless abyss, into whose depths the eye dares"
6020,SONG.,"hardly for a moment gaze. Then appeared a crystal lakelet, and a little"
6021,SONG.,"plain covered with a seedy-looking grass, where the horses rested and"
6022,SONG.,refreshed themselves ere the last desperate trial of their strength and
6023,SONG.,endurance; for the weary band of adventurers had reached at last the
6024,SONG.,"base of the mighty Washington, whose summit was veiled in heavy clouds."
6025,SONG.,"As they loitered in the plain, the muffled gentleman again approached"
6026,SONG.,"Florence, and inquired if she was unattended."
6027,SONG.,
6028,SONG.,"""No, sir,"" said she. ""My father is among the party, also a friend; but"
6029,SONG.,"they are not yet come up."""
6030,SONG.,
6031,SONG.,"He lingered a moment, and then asked if she would like to dismount."
6032,SONG.,
6033,SONG.,"As the voice met her ear more distinctly, it struck her it had a"
6034,SONG.,"familiar sound, and a sudden thought flashed across her mind. She"
6035,SONG.,"thanked him for his politeness, but said she was too cold to move."
6036,SONG.,
6037,SONG.,"Her father and young Williams now appeared. ""How do you brave it,"
6038,SONG.,"Florence?"" said Major Howard, drawing in his breath with a shudder."
6039,SONG.,
6040,SONG.,"""Very well, father,"" answered she."
6041,SONG.,
6042,SONG.,"When the muffled gentleman heard the name Florence pronounced, he"
6043,SONG.,started suddenly and darted a swift glance on the speaker. Then turning
6044,SONG.,"away, he remounted his steed and rode into the front ranks of the line"
6045,SONG.,that was forming. Soon the band commenced their toilsome ascent. The
6046,SONG.,path wound over perpendicularly-piled masses of gigantic granite
6047,SONG.,"boulders. Often it seemed the poor tired animals, with their utmost"
6048,SONG.,"efforts, would never be able to surmount the prodigious rocks that"
6049,SONG.,"obstructed their way. Cold, blustering clouds of mists drove in the"
6050,SONG.,faces of the forlorn little party as they labored up and up the
6051,SONG.,"precipitous steeps, till it seemed to many a despairing heart that the"
6052,SONG.,"summit of that tremendous mountain would never, never be gained. So"
6053,SONG.,"densely hung the threatening clouds around them, they could not tell"
6054,SONG.,their distance from the wished-for goal. At length the guides halloed to
6055,SONG.,the foremost rider to halt; and directly Florence felt herself in the
6056,SONG.,"arms of a strong man, who sprang over the craggy rocks with surprising"
6057,SONG.,"agility, and soon placed her on the door-stone of a small habitation,"
6058,SONG.,"which was not only ""founded on a rock,"" but surrounded on all sides by"
6059,SONG.,huge piles of gray granite boulders.
6060,SONG.,
6061,SONG.,"In a few moments the whole dripping, half-frozen party were landed"
6062,SONG.,"safely at the ""Summit House,"" on the brow of Mount Washington. Great was"
6063,SONG.,their joy to find a comfortable shelter where they might rest and warm
6064,SONG.,their chilled limbs; but great also was their dismay to find a storm
6065,SONG.,"upon them, and nothing visible from the miraculous height they had"
6066,SONG.,"toiled to gain, but the wet rocks lying close beneath the small windows."

6122,CHILDE HAROLD.,"He could not withstand this gentle appeal, this touching expression."
6123,CHILDE HAROLD.,Softly his arm stole round her slender waist. She placed her little hand
6124,CHILDE HAROLD.,"lightly on his shoulder, and laid her head with confiding tenderness on"
6125,CHILDE HAROLD.,his bosom.
6126,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6127,CHILDE HAROLD.,"O, what was Mount Washington in his glory then? What the whole boundless"
6128,CHILDE HAROLD.,prospect that spread its sublime immensity before them? Their eyes
6129,CHILDE HAROLD.,"looked only in each other's hearts, and they were warm--O, how warm with"
6130,CHILDE HAROLD.,"love, and hope, and happiness! Mount Washington was cold. They felt a"
6131,CHILDE HAROLD.,"pity for its great, insensate piles of granite, that loomed up there to"
6132,CHILDE HAROLD.,"heaven, cold, bare and stony, void of power to feel and sympathize with"
6133,CHILDE HAROLD.,human emotions. Wandering to a sheltered nook among the rocks they sat
6134,CHILDE HAROLD.,down together.
6135,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6136,CHILDE HAROLD.,"An hour passed by, during which each member of the little party was"
6137,CHILDE HAROLD.,"intently occupied with his own delighted observations, and then Major"
6138,CHILDE HAROLD.,"Howard recollected the absence of his daughter, who had left his side,"
6139,CHILDE HAROLD.,saying she wished to contemplate the sublime spectacle apart from the
6140,CHILDE HAROLD.,"rest of the company. Gazing over the cragged summit, he beheld her"
6141,CHILDE HAROLD.,approaching with a gentleman at her side.
6142,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6143,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Ay, my little truant,"" said he, advancing to meet her. ""So you tired of"
6144,CHILDE HAROLD.,"your solitary contemplation, after all."""
6145,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6146,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""I found this fair lady roaming among the rocks, and ventured to escort"
6147,CHILDE HAROLD.,"her to the party,"" said the gentleman, bowing politely, as he delivered"
6148,CHILDE HAROLD.,Florence to the care of her father.
6149,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6150,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Thank you, thank you, sir,"" returned Major Howard, casting a"
6151,CHILDE HAROLD.,scrutinizing glance toward the young man as he turned away.
6152,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6153,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""My daughter, what do you think of this scene?"" he asked, turning to"
6154,CHILDE HAROLD.,her.
6155,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6156,CHILDE HAROLD.,"The glowing happiness, which lighted her features with almost"
6157,CHILDE HAROLD.,"supernatural beauty, astonished him."
6158,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6159,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""That I have never seen aught so awfully grand and majestic before,"""
6160,CHILDE HAROLD.,"returned she, in a tone of wild enthusiasm."
6161,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6162,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Does it surpass Niagara?"""
6163,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6164,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Infinitely,"" answered she. ""Niagara is grand, but it is a single,"
6165,CHILDE HAROLD.,"solitary grandeur. Here, our vision encompasses a boundless expanse of"
6166,CHILDE HAROLD.,"dread, terrific sublimities; a sea of towering Alpine summits on every"
6167,CHILDE HAROLD.,"hand, with fearfully-yawning gulfs and chasms; tremendous precipices,"
6168,CHILDE HAROLD.,"over whose dizzy edges, as we look down, and down, and down into the"
6169,CHILDE HAROLD.,"abysmal depths of bright green valleys, starred over with tiny white"
6170,CHILDE HAROLD.,"cottages, and graced with winding rivers and waving fields of grain, we"
6171,CHILDE HAROLD.,"mark the dark straight lines of unnumbered railways, with their flying"
6172,CHILDE HAROLD.,trains of cars; countless sheets of water flashing like molten silver;
6173,CHILDE HAROLD.,"the spires and domes of numerous hamlets, villages, and cities; and, far"
6174,CHILDE HAROLD.,"in the distance, the broad Atlantic's dark blue surface, jotted over"
6175,CHILDE HAROLD.,"with white gleaming sails. O, father, father!"" she exclaimed, almost"
6176,CHILDE HAROLD.,"wild with her emotions of awe and admiration, ""is there in all the world"
6177,CHILDE HAROLD.,"a spectacle to equal that which feasts our vision now?"""
6178,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6179,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""It is a grand scene,"" said the father, participating in his daughter's"
6180,CHILDE HAROLD.,"vivid enjoyment. ""Look far on those blue summits that bound the prospect"
6181,CHILDE HAROLD.,to the west and north. Those singularly-formed peaks you notice are
6182,CHILDE HAROLD.,"called Camel's Rump and Mansfield mountains."""
6183,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6184,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Would I might forever dwell here!"" exclaimed Florence, her eyes roaming"
6185,CHILDE HAROLD.,"in every direction, as though her soul could never drink its fill of the"
6186,CHILDE HAROLD.,sublimity around.
6187,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6188,CHILDE HAROLD.,Perhaps other delights than the scenery would afford rose in bright
6189,CHILDE HAROLD.,"anticipation, and caused her to utter this strange, wild wish."
6190,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6191,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""You forget the awful winters, Florence, when you would perish beneath"
6192,CHILDE HAROLD.,"the sky-piled snows,"" said her father."
6193,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6194,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""O, I would not mind them!"" she answered. ""I'd have a little habitation,"
6195,CHILDE HAROLD.,"hidden down among the rocks, where I could sit by a cosey fire and"
6196,CHILDE HAROLD.,"listen to the billowy blasts that swept over my home in the clouds."""
6197,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6198,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Alone, Florence?"" asked her father. ""Would you dwell alone in a place"
6199,CHILDE HAROLD.,"so wild with terrors?"""
6200,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6201,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""O, no!"" said she quickly. ""I would have one companion."""
6202,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6203,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""And who should that be?"""
6204,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6205,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""The one I loved best on earth,"" replied she, turning her clear eyes on"
6206,CHILDE HAROLD.,her father's face.
6207,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6208,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""And that is""----he paused, and added, interrogatively, ""Rufus Malcome?"""
6209,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6210,CHILDE HAROLD.,"Florence started. Her features suddenly lost their glowing light, and"
6211,CHILDE HAROLD.,darkened into a contemptuous frown.
6212,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6213,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""Don't breathe that name here!"" she exclaimed, almost fiercely. ""It is"
6214,CHILDE HAROLD.,"not worthy to be spoken in the air of God's own taintless purity."""
6215,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6216,CHILDE HAROLD.,Her father gazed with astonishment and pity. He had fancied the
6217,CHILDE HAROLD.,repugnance and dislike she formerly evinced toward her affianced husband
6218,CHILDE HAROLD.,was dissipated or forgotten in the multiplied excitements and varieties
6219,CHILDE HAROLD.,of travel; and great was his regret and sorrow to find it still rankling
6220,CHILDE HAROLD.,"in her bosom. Both stood silent several moments, engaged in their own"
6221,CHILDE HAROLD.,"thoughts and emotions. At length several voices exclaimed gleefully,"
6222,CHILDE HAROLD.,"""The ponies, the ponies are coming!"""
6223,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6224,CHILDE HAROLD.,"Major Howard glanced downwards, and beheld the long line of riderless"
6225,CHILDE HAROLD.,"horses, attended by the guides, slowly wending their way around the"
6226,CHILDE HAROLD.,"shelving, precipitous side of Mount Monroe. The company collected"
6227,CHILDE HAROLD.,"together and agreed to set out and meet them; so, returning to the hotel"
6228,CHILDE HAROLD.,"among the rocks, they partook of a finely-prepared lunch, and, wrapping"
6229,CHILDE HAROLD.,"warmly in shawls and blankets went forth on their hard, laborious way,"
6230,CHILDE HAROLD.,down the steep path of cragged rocks. Sometimes their feet lighted on a
6231,CHILDE HAROLD.,"sharp projection, or by a misstep they fell among the stony piles,"
6232,CHILDE HAROLD.,"bruising and wrenching their flesh and bones. But, notwithstanding all"
6233,CHILDE HAROLD.,"the fatigues and hardships of the way, the party were in jubilant"
6234,CHILDE HAROLD.,"spirits. As the prospect narrowed with the descent, they were all taking"
6235,CHILDE HAROLD.,"a last look at the disappearing wonders, and shouting their earnest"
6236,CHILDE HAROLD.,farewells.
6237,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6238,CHILDE HAROLD.,"At the ""Lake of the Clouds"" they halted and drank of its cold, crystal"
6239,CHILDE HAROLD.,"waters. The ponies were feeding on the plain, and the party gladly"
6240,CHILDE HAROLD.,"mounted and commenced their long, toilsome descent."
6241,CHILDE HAROLD.,
6242,CHILDE HAROLD.,"As the shades of evening were falling, their safe arrival in the valley"
6243,CHILDE HAROLD.,was hailed by assembled groups on the piazzas of the Crawford House.

6276,CHAPTER XXXV.,beneath its beaming rays of light and love. I toiled up the miraculous
6277,CHAPTER XXXV.,"steeps of hoary-headed, granite-crowned Mount Washington, to realize a"
6278,CHAPTER XXXV.,"double joy. The stern, gloomy grandeur was alone sufficient to awaken my"
6279,CHAPTER XXXV.,"profoundest awe, my strongest admiration; but a warm heart-happiness"
6280,CHAPTER XXXV.,"stole over me, which spread a mantling glory over all the thousand"

6282,CHAPTER XXXV.,
6283,CHAPTER XXXV.,"""And ever, till my heart has ceased to beat, though I should roam in"

6289,CHAPTER XXXV.,Edgar's love! My soul is strong and firm as the mountains where my joy
6290,CHAPTER XXXV.,was born. Shall I ever tremble or waver again? Am I not mailed in armor
6291,CHAPTER XXXV.,to meet unshocked the battling swords and lances of life's armied
6292,CHAPTER XXXV.,"legions of cares and sorrows? With Edgar's love to nerve my soul, what"
6293,CHAPTER XXXV.,"is there that I cannot endure? Surely, I could survive all things save"

6489,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Florence, as soon as she could command her voice sufficiently to speak,"
6490,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""but a granite profile, standing out from a peak of solid rock, exactly"
6491,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"resembling the features of a man's face; whence its name, 'Old Man of"
6492,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"the Mountain.'"""
6493,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6494,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Ay, that's all, then!"" said the major, referring to his guidebook. ""I"
6495,CHAPTER XXXVI.,shall be very glad of the privilege of standing on the ground for once
6496,CHAPTER XXXVI.,and looking up at an object; for I confess it afflicts my
6497,CHAPTER XXXVI.,kindly-affectioned nature to be forever looking down upon this goodly
6498,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"earth, as if in disdainful contempt of its manifold beauties. So,"
6499,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"to-morrow, ladies and gentlemen,"" added he, rising, ""we are to pay our"
6500,CHAPTER XXXVI.,respects to this 'Old Man.' I hear music below. You young people would
6501,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"like to join the merry groups, I suppose. I'm going down to the office"
6502,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"to enjoy a cigar, and then retire, for my old bones are sadly racked"
6503,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"with the jaunts of to-day. Good-night to you all."" Thus saying, he"
6504,CHAPTER XXXVI.,walked away.
6505,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6506,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Would you like to join the dancers, Ellen?"" asked Florence, turning to"
6507,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"the fair girl who sat in a rocking-chair by the window, gazing out on"
6508,CHAPTER XXXVI.,the moon-lit earth.
6509,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6510,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I don't care to join the dance,"" she returned; ""but I would like to go"
6511,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"and listen to the music a while."""
6512,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6513,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Then let us go,"" said her brother; ""that is, if agreeable to Miss"
6514,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Florence and Mr. Lindenwood."""
6515,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6516,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I shall be happy to accompany you, Miss Howard,"" said he, offering"
6517,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Florence his arm, which she accepted, and the party descended to the"
6518,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"parlors. They were well-lighted, and filled with guests. Edward and"
6519,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Ellen soon became exhilarated by the music, and joined the cotillons."
6520,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Edgar looked in vain for a vacant sofa, and at length asked Florence if"
6521,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"she would not like to walk on the piazzas. She assented, and they went"
6522,CHAPTER XXXVI.,forth. The evening was cool and delightful. A sweet young moon shed her
6523,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"pale light o'er the scene, veiling the roughness of the surrounding"
6524,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"country, and heightening its romantic effect."
6525,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6526,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I think you are growing less cheerful every day,"" said he, gazing"
6527,CHAPTER XXXVI.,tenderly on her downcast features.
6528,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6529,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Can you not divine the cause of my depression?"" she asked, raising her"
6530,CHAPTER XXXVI.,dark eyes to his face.
6531,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6532,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""No,"" said he, smiling on her. ""Won't you tell me?"""
6533,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6534,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Father says we must return home soon,"" answered she, turning her face"
6535,CHAPTER XXXVI.,away.
6536,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6537,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Is that an unpleasant prospect to you?"" asked he, seeking to obtain a"
6538,CHAPTER XXXVI.,glance at her averted face.
6539,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6540,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Yes,"" returned she; and he thought a shudder for a moment convulsed the"
6541,CHAPTER XXXVI.,slender form at his side.
6542,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6543,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"They were both silent several moments, and then he remarked, ""I intend"
6544,CHAPTER XXXVI.,to visit Wimbledon in a few months; may I not hope to see you should I
6545,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"do so?"""
6546,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6547,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I presume my father will be happy to receive a visit from you,"""
6548,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"answered she, in a formal tone."
6549,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6550,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""But his daughter would rather be excused from my company, I am to"
6551,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"understand,"" said he."
6552,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6553,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""O, no! not that,"" returned Florence quickly, turning her face suddenly"
6554,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"toward him, when he saw it was bathed in tears and marked with painful"
6555,CHAPTER XXXVI.,emotion.
6556,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6557,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""What distresses you, Florence?"" asked he; gently taking her hand in"
6558,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"his. ""Will you not tell me?"""
6559,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6560,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I dare not, Edgar!"" answered she, with fast-falling tears. ""I have"
6561,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"wronged you, and you will not forgive me."""
6562,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6563,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Then you do not love me!"" said he, looking sadly on her countenance."
6564,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6565,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""O, yes! I love you,"" she returned, in a tone of pathetic tenderness,"
6566,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""Heaven knows, too wildly well! If that could atone for my fault, I"
6567,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"should not fear to give it expression."""
6568,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6569,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""It can!"" said he, pressing her hand closely to his heart. ""Believe me,"
6570,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Florence, it can atone for everything."""
6571,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6572,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Encouraged by his tone and manner she spoke. ""I am engaged""--he dropped"
6573,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"the hand and started back--""to Rufus Malcome,"" she concluded, and then"
6574,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"darting quickly into the hall, flew up stairs and locked herself into"
6575,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"her own apartment. She paced the floor hurriedly several minutes, and"
6576,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"then seized her journal,--always her confidant in moments of affliction."
6577,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6578,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"""I knew it would come to this at last,"" she wrote. ""I have acknowledged"
6579,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"my error, and told him of my engagement with Rufus Malcome. It cost me a"
6580,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"struggle, but I knew he must learn it from some source e'er long, and"
6581,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"better from my lips than those of strangers. He will visit Wimbledon,"
6582,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"and then, O horrible thought! I shall be the bride of another; for"
6583,CHAPTER XXXVI.,father tells me Col. Malcome is desirous the marriage should be
6584,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"consummated the approaching winter. I got a long, foolish letter from"
6585,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Rufus yesterday. O dear, how sick and sorry it made me! It is strange"
6586,CHAPTER XXXVI.,mother never writes. Col. Malcome says she is not as well as when we
6587,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"left, and this intelligence disposes father to hasten home. O, my poor"
6588,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"bleeding heart! How soon this little day of happiness has past."" She"
6589,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"closed the book, and threw herself on the bed. After a while she fell"
6590,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"asleep, and was roused by Ellen, knocking for admittance."
6591,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6592,CHAPTER XXXVI.,In the morning she met Edgar in the parlor with her father and young
6593,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"Williams, the three in earnest conversation about their proposed"
6594,CHAPTER XXXVI.,excursion to the Profile Mountain. He made her a distant bow. She
6595,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"returned to her room, and not the most urgent entreaties of her father"
6596,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"could induce her to join the party. She pleaded a violent headache, and"
6597,CHAPTER XXXVI.,Ellen announced her resolve to remain with her. She cared nothing about
6598,CHAPTER XXXVI.,the 'Old Man;' she would stay at home and nurse Florence. So the three
6599,CHAPTER XXXVI.,"gentlemen departed together, and in a few days the Howards had left the"
6600,CHAPTER XXXVI.,mountain region and set out for Wimbledon.
6601,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6602,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6603,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6604,CHAPTER XXXVI.,
6605,CHAPTER XXXVII.,CHAPTER XXXVII.
6606,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6607,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""Once more the sound"
6608,CHAPTER XXXVII.,Of human voices echoes in our ears;
6609,CHAPTER XXXVII.,And some commotion dire hath roused
6610,CHAPTER XXXVII.,The female ranks. Let's pause and learn
6611,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"The drift of all this wordy war of tongues."""
6612,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6613,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6614,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Back to the Mumbles, the Wimbles and Pimbles, and their clamorous voices"
6615,CHAPTER XXXVII.,again dinning in our ears. Will we ever be quit of them?
6616,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6617,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"As cold weather approached, and the atmospheric thermometer descended to"
6618,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"the freezing point, the philanthropic one mounted suddenly to blood"
6619,CHAPTER XXXVII.,heat.
6620,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6621,CHAPTER XXXVII.,Mrs. Pimble and Mrs. Lawson assumed their green legs and strode over
6622,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Wimbledon with pompous, majestic tread. The Woman's Rights Reform shook"
6623,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"off its sluggish torpor, and rose a mighty shape of masculine vigor,"
6624,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"strength and power. As in atonement for past sloth and inertness, the"
6625,CHAPTER XXXVII.,reformists became more active in their several departments than ever
6626,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"before. Lectures were delivered, clubs formed, and committees appointed"
6627,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"to visit the people from house to house, and stir them up by way of"
6628,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"remembrance, to engage in the great benevolent enterprises of the day."
6629,CHAPTER XXXVII.,At length an indignation meeting was announced to be held at the village
6630,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"church in Wimbledon. The house was thronged at an early hour, and great"
6631,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"excitement pervaded the assembly, when the chairman and other officers"
6632,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"appeared and ascended the platform, which had been erected for their"
6633,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"convenience. It must be admitted that Dea. Allen, sitting in the glaring"
6634,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"light of the uncurtained windows, contemplated with rather wrathful"
6635,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"visage the ample green damask Bloomers, which adorned the lower limbs of"
6636,CHAPTER XXXVII.,the several officiating ladies; but he quite forgot his anger when the
6637,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"president sublimely arose, and, advancing to the front of the stand,"
6638,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"said in a loud, commanding tone:"
6639,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6640,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""We will now proceed with the business of this convention. If there is"
6641,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"any person in the house that wishes to pray, she, or he, can do so. We"
6642,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"hold to liberty and equal rights for all."""
6643,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6644,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"She then stood in silence several moments, gazing over the assembly with"
6645,CHAPTER XXXVII.,a self-possessed and confident air. But it appeared no person was moved
6646,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"with a spirit of prayer. So the lady president, after a preparatory hem,"
6647,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"proceeded with the duties of her office. She, in a brief speech,"
6648,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"explained the reason for holding this meeting, and the object it had in"
6649,CHAPTER XXXVII.,view.
6650,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6651,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I have spoken in public before,"" said she; ""often has my voice been"
6652,CHAPTER XXXVII.,raised against tyranny and oppression in all its forms; but never until
6653,CHAPTER XXXVII.,to-day has it been my happy privilege to address so large an assembly of
6654,CHAPTER XXXVII.,the inhabitants of my native village on the holy subjects of freedom and
6655,CHAPTER XXXVII.,philanthropy. It inspires my soul with fresh courage to behold your
6656,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"eager faces, for they seem to say your minds are awakening to the"
6657,CHAPTER XXXVII.,demands of the down-trodden portions of your race. We hold this
6658,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"convention to arouse an interest in the cause of reform, which shall"
6659,CHAPTER XXXVII.,lead to strong and energetic action.
6660,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6661,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""It is too painfully true that Wimbledon is a sink of immorality, vice"
6662,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"and pollution, where moral turpitude stalks with giant strides, and"
6663,CHAPTER XXXVII.,abominable barbarisms are practised under the glaring light of heaven.
6664,CHAPTER XXXVII.,(Sensation.) The object of this meeting is to crush the oppressor's
6665,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"might, and raise his hapless victims to their proper position in"
6666,CHAPTER XXXVII.,society. I call upon the women of this assembly to rise from the depths
6667,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"of their degradation, rush boldly in the faces of their enslavers, and"
6668,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"assert their rights; and, having asserted, maintain them, even at the"
6669,CHAPTER XXXVII.,point of the sword. (Sensation and murmurings.) A series of resolutions
6670,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"will now be presented for the consideration of the convention."""
6671,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6672,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"She turned to Mrs. Lawson, who sat majestically in a large arm-chair,"
6673,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"her strong arms folded on her broad chest, and whispered a few words in"
6674,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"her ear. While she was thus engaged, Mr. Salsify Mumbles rose, and said"
6675,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"in a loud tone: ""Gentlemen and ladies, I rise for the purpose""---- On"
6676,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"hearing the sound of his voice, the lady president rushed to the edge of"
6677,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"the platform, and glaring on the upright figure, which shook like an"
6678,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"aspen beneath her fiery eyes, exclaimed, in thundering accents, ""What"
6679,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"are you standing there for, you booby-faced, blubber-chopped baboon in"
6680,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"boots?"""
6681,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6682,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I wish to speak,"" stammered the terrified man. He could utter no more."
6683,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6684,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""_You_ speak!"" said the lofty president, in a tone of the most supreme"
6685,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"contempt,--""sit down."""
6686,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6687,CHAPTER XXXVII.,The poor creature dropped as quick as though he had received a cannon
6688,CHAPTER XXXVII.,ball in his heart.
6689,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6690,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Mrs. Pimble retired, and Mrs. Secretary Lawson arose, adjusted her green"
6691,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"spectacles, and, taking a roll of papers from the table, advanced to the"
6692,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"front of the stand. Elevating her brows, she said:"
6693,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6694,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I will now read several resolutions which have been handed in since the"
6695,CHAPTER XXXVII.,opening of the meeting.
6696,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6697,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""First, Resolved, That the enfranchised women of Wimbledon use their"
6698,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"combined efforts for the liberation of their suffering sisterhood, who"
6699,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"yet groan beneath the despotic cruelties of the oppressor man."""
6700,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6701,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"The secretary sat down. The president arose. ""Are there any remarks to"
6702,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"be made on this resolution?"" she said."
6703,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6704,CHAPTER XXXVII.,None were forthcoming.
6705,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6706,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""Then I move its adoption."""
6707,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6708,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I second the motion,"" squealed a little voice from some remote corner."
6709,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6710,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"The secretary came forward. ""All in favor of this resolution will please"
6711,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"say, ay."""
6712,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6713,CHAPTER XXXVII.,A score of voices were heard.
6714,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6715,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""It is unanimously accepted,"" said she. ""I will now proceed to the"
6716,CHAPTER XXXVII.,reading of the second.
6717,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6718,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""Resolved, That, as a means of humbling and destroying the tyranny which"
6719,CHAPTER XXXVII.,the monster man exercises over the larger portion of the women of
6720,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Wimbledon, six of the usurpers be converted into lamp-posts, and placed"
6721,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"at the corners of the principal streets, with tin lanterns fixed upon"
6722,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"their heads, to light the cause of philanthropy in its midnight"
6723,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"struggles."" (Sensation, and several brawny hands scratching uneasily at"
6724,CHAPTER XXXVII.,the apex of their craniums.)
6725,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6726,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"The secretary sat down; the lady president arose. ""This is a very"
6727,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"spirited as well as elegant resolve,"" said she, ""and cannot fail of"
6728,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"securing universal approbation. Mrs. Secretary, you will please read the"
6729,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"remaining portion, and then all can be adopted by one joint action of"
6730,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"the house."""
6731,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6732,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""There are but two brief ones to follow,"" said the secretary, again"
6733,CHAPTER XXXVII.,coming forward.
6734,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6735,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""First, Resolved, That the tortuous channel of Wimbledon river be made"
6736,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"straight, and the tyrant man be compelled to perform the labor with"
6737,CHAPTER XXXVII.,three-inch augers and pap-spoons.
6738,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6739,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""Secondly, Resolved, That, the steeple of this church, which looms so"
6740,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"boldly impious toward the sky, be felled to the ground, and be converted"
6741,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"into a liberty-pole, with the cast-off petticoats of the enfranchised"
6742,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"women of Wimbledon flaunting proudly from its summit, as an emblem of"
6743,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"the downfall of man's bigotry and despotism, and the triumphant"
6744,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"elevation of woman to her proper sphere among the rulers of the earth."""
6745,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6746,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Great sensation as the lady secretary pronounced the foregoing resolves,"
6747,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"with strong impressiveness of tone and manner. As she retired, Dea."
6748,CHAPTER XXXVII.,Allen rose. The lady president sprang from her seat.
6749,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6750,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""Sit down!"" shrieked she, bringing her foot to the platform with a"
6751,CHAPTER XXXVII.,violence that caused it to tremble. But the deacon did not drop at this
6752,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"sharp command, as Mr. Mumbles had done."
6753,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6754,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I thought you held to liberty and equal rights,"" said he, with an air"
6755,CHAPTER XXXVII.,of some boldness.
6756,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6757,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I do,--and therefore I tell you to sit down."""
6758,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6759,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"""I will speak,"" said he, returning the defiant looks cast upon him by"
6760,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"both president and secretary; ""for religion and right demand it. If you"
6761,CHAPTER XXXVII.,dare profane with your sacrilegious hands the holy steeple of this house
6762,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"of God, avenging justice will fall with crushing weight upon your guilty"
6763,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"heads."""
6764,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6765,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"Having delivered himself of this dread prediction, the deacon sat down."
6766,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6767,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"In her loftiest style, Mrs. Pimble moved the adoption of the"
6768,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"resolutions, vouchsafing no word of comment on the impertinent"
6769,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"interruption. A brawling, discordant shout of ""Ay--ay--ay,"" in every"
6770,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"possible variety of tones, from a swarm of boisterous boys and ranting"
6771,CHAPTER XXXVII.,"rowdies, was declared a unanimous approval, and in a storm of hisses and"
6772,CHAPTER XXXVII.,hurrahs the indignation meeting triumphantly adjourned.
6773,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6774,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6775,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6776,CHAPTER XXXVII.,
6777,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,CHAPTER XXXVIII.
6778,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6779,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Fare thee well! and if forever,"

6792,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6793,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6794,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Sudden death had entered the home of Louise Edson and made her a widow.
6795,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Her husband died of cholera, in a distant city, whence he had gone for"
6796,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"the purchase of goods, and was brought home a corpse. Louise reeled to"
6797,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,earth beneath the sudden and unexpected blow. Her soul was lacerated by
6798,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"constant memory of the wrong she had done him, and it seemed to her"
6799,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,aroused and trembling conscience that avenging Heaven had taken to
6800,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"itself the man she had so deeply injured, and left her to grope darkly"
6801,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"on in her own wickedness and sin. True she had been cruelly disappointed,"
6802,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,and through long years compelled to struggle on in all the bitter
6803,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"loneliness of feelings unreplied to, bound by indissoluble chains to one"
6804,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,who had no tastes or sympathies in common with her. Death had freed her
6805,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"now, but, ah! too late. The taint of sin was on her soul. She had forgot"
6806,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"her vows at the altar, debased herself and wronged her husband by"
6807,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"listening to words of passion from another. O, far less bitter would"
6808,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"have been her grief, as she stood weeping over his lifeless form, could"
6809,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"she have laid her hand on the cold, damp brow and said, ""I have loved"
6810,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"thee ever, and through life's cares and perplexities stood closely at"
6811,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"thy side to cheer and smooth thy pathway."" But this she could not say."
6812,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"She only felt that the soul had gone to God, to learn her falsity and"
6813,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"sin, and looked from the skies upon her with grief and avenging anger."
6814,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Bitterly she thought of the man who had led her from the path of
6815,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"rectitude, and resolved to see him no more. As a self-inflicted penance,"
6816,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"she immured herself within the walls of her own mansion, and determined"
6817,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,to pass the remainder of her life in solitude. Many of her numerous
6818,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,friends sought admittance to express sympathy and condolence in her
6819,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"affliction, but she refused to see them and resisted all their"
6820,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,overtures. Only one person gained entrance to her seclusion. That was
6821,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope, whose kind heart was deeply pained by the apparently"
6822,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"incurable sorrow that had settled on the mind of her young friend, and"
6823,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"strove, by every effort in her power, to lighten her woes and lead her"
6824,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,to more hopeful views of the future.
6825,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6826,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""It grieves me,"" said she, ""to see you, in the bloom of youth and"
6827,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"health, immure yourself in a living tomb, and refuse the consolations"
6828,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"you would receive from intercourse with your species."""
6829,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6830,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I want no more of the world,"" answered the sufferer; ""it has no"

6832,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6833,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""But, my dear, you should not allow your feelings to overpower your"
6834,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"better judgment,"" remonstrated Mrs. Stanhope."
6835,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6836,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Ah, my feelings!"" said Louise, bitterly, with tears rolling over her"
6837,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"pale cheeks; ""they have been my destruction. Had I always controlled"
6838,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"them, I had not been the miserable creature I am to-day."""
6839,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6840,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope hardly understood this passionate outburst, but she still"
6841,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,strove to soothe and comfort her afflicted friend.
6842,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6843,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Your brow is hot and feverish,"" said she, rising to depart. ""I caution"

6846,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,

6850,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6851,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope gazed on the suffering face with tearful pity, and turned"
6852,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"away. On opening the hall door, she encountered Col. Malcome, pacing to"
6853,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"and fro on the icy piazza. He started suddenly on beholding her, and"
6854,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,asked if she came from Mrs. Edson. Mrs. Stanhope answered affirmatively.
6855,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6856,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""And how have you left her?"" inquired he, with an expression of strong"
6857,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,anxiety and emotion on his features.
6858,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6859,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""She seems deeply afflicted,"" returned Mrs. Stanhope."
6860,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6861,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Does she still persist in refusing to see her friends?"" asked he."
6862,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6863,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""She is thus disposed, I regret to say,"" was Mrs. Stanhope's reply."
6864,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6865,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Would you do me the favor to return, and entreat her to grant me a few"
6866,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"moments in her presence?"" inquired he, in an earnest tone."
6867,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6868,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I will perform your request with pleasure,"" she said; ""but I fear I"
6869,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"shall bring you naught but a gloomy refusal."" Thus saying, she reëntered"
6870,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,the apartment of Louise.
6871,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6872,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I am come with a petition, Mrs. Edson,"" she remarked, approaching her"
6873,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"side, and laying a hand softly on the bowed head. ""Will you grant it"
6874,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"your favor?"""
6875,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6876,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I must hear it first,"" said Louise."
6877,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6878,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Col. Malcome is walking on the piazza; he wishes to see you."""
6879,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6880,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Go and tell him, in another and a darker world I'll see him; never"
6881,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"again in this,"" answered Louise, starting to her feet, her whole frame"
6882,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,trembling with excitement and anger.
6883,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6884,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope was astonished and alarmed at her appearance, and stood"
6885,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"gazing on her in wondering silence. At length she said, ""I cannot take a"
6886,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,message like that to him; he would think it the wild raving of a
6887,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"lunatic."""
6888,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6889,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Tell him, then, to go away, and never approach these doors again,"" said"
6890,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Louise, suddenly bursting into tears. Mrs. Stanhope lingered in surprise"
6891,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"at her friend's emotion, and strove to soothe it."
6892,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6893,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Go,"" said Louise; ""I command you to go, and send him away. I shall die"
6894,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"if I hear another of his footfalls on the piazza."""
6895,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6896,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Alarmed by the dreadful energy of her manner, Mrs. Stanhope hurried"
6897,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"away. The colonel came eagerly to her side, as she stepped forth."
6898,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6899,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Does she refuse me?"" he asked."
6900,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6901,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""She does,"" said Mrs. Stanhope."
6902,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6903,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""And does she give no encouragement that I may gain admittance at some"
6904,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"future time?"""
6905,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6906,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""None."""
6907,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6908,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Then carry this to her,"" said he, placing a small, folded letter in"
6909,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope's hand, and turning dejectedly away."
6910,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6911,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Again she entered the mansion. Louise sat with head bowed between her
6912,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"hands, and did not raise her eyes. Mrs. Stanhope laid the missive on the"
6913,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"table beside her, and silently left the apartment."
6914,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6915,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Twilight deepened into evening, and still the suffering woman sat there,"
6916,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"in mute, unutterable agony. A servant entering with lights at length"
6917,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"aroused her to consciousness, and her eye fell on the folded letter"
6918,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"lying on the stand. Hastily tearing away the envelope, she dropped on"
6919,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"her knees, and ran over its contents with devouring eagerness, while her"
6920,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"features worked with strong, conflicting emotions, and tears rolled"
6921,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"continually from her beautiful eyes and blistered the written page. ""Why"
6922,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"do you drive me from you?"" it began. ""If, in an unguarded moment, under"
6923,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"the intoxicating influences which your bewitching presence, the quiet"
6924,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"seclusion of the spot, and romantic hush and stillness of the hour threw"
6925,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"around me, all combining to lap my soul in delicious forgetfulness of"
6926,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"everything beyond the momentary bliss of having you at my side, I"
6927,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"suffered words to escape my lips, which should have remained concealed"
6928,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"in my own bosom, you might at least let the deep, overpowering love"
6929,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"which forced their utterance, plead as some extenuation for my"
6930,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,presumption and error. But it seems you have cast me from you
6931,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"forever--unpitied--unforgiven. O, Louise! I did not think you so"
6932,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"implacable. The sin is mine, and I would come on bended knee to implore"
6933,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,pardon for the suffering and sorrow my rashness has brought to your
6934,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"innocent heart; but you fly from my approach, and banish me from your"
6935,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"presence. No mercy for one, who, though he may have erred, is surely"
6936,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"atoning for his errors by anguish as deep, as poignant as your own."
6937,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Night after night I walk the piazza beneath your windows. I know you
6938,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,hear my step and feel that I am near. But you will not open the casement
6939,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,and let me for a moment behold your features and crave your forgiveness.
6940,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"O, Louise, am I to die without a pitying word or look from you?"
6941,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6942,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I sit by my Edith's bed-side through long, weary midnight hours, and"
6943,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,she wakes from her fitful slumbers and asks for you. 'Why does she never
6944,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"come to see me now? There's no arm raises me so lightly, no hand bathes"
6945,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"my brow so gently, as hers. Will you not bring her, father?'"
6946,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6947,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""O, what agony these words inflict! I have to feel my own rashness and"
6948,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"folly have deprived my sick child of a tender nurse. Louise, do you not"
6949,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"remember one dear, bright morning, long ago, when I was sitting at the"
6950,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"piano in that pleasant parlor I'm forbidden to enter now, and you stood"
6951,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"beside me in all your bewildering grace and beauty, that I sought from"
6952,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"you a promise which was given? Still, still would I conjure you, as"
6953,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Steerforth said to David, _think of me at my best_. You will need to do"
6954,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,it soon; for your contempt and scorn are hurrying me on to deeds of
6955,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"crime and wickedness. O, will you drive me to the wretch's doom, or win"
6956,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"me to a life of happiness and virtue? It is yours to decide."""
6957,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6958,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Such were the contents of the letter which remained clenched in the
6959,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,grasp of the agitated woman through the long hours of that woe-fraught
6960,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"night. When the first gray tints of dawn were visible, she started and"
6961,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,hid it away in her bosom. Grasping a pen she traced a few lines with
6962,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"trembling hand, and placed them in an envelope directed to Mrs."
6963,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Stanhope. Then unclosing her wardrobe, she selected a few articles of"
6964,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"clothing, made them into a small bundle, and wrapping a heavy shawl"
6965,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"round her slender form, and concealing her features in a large black"
6966,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"bonnet with a long, thick veil, she opened softly the hall door, and"
6967,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"stole forth into the cold, biting air, walking hurriedly over the frosty"
6968,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,paths till she had gained the lonesome country road beyond the village.
6969,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6970,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"As Mrs. Stanhope was sitting down to breakfast, a knock called her to"
6971,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"the door, where she beheld Mrs. Edson's servant, who presented her with"
6972,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"a letter, and said her mistress had gone away very suddenly, and she"
6973,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,would like to know if she had left any word as to when she would return.
6974,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6975,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Mrs. Stanhope broke the seal, and read with surprise and astonishment"
6976,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,depicted on her features. The girl stood waiting to learn its contents.
6977,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6978,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I think,"" said Mrs. Stanhope, suddenly recollecting herself, ""that your"
6979,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,mistress will be absent some time. She informs me she has gone on a
6980,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"visit to the aunt with whom she resided previous to her marriage."""
6981,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6982,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Where does her aunt live?"" asked the girl."
6983,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6984,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I do not know,"" returned Mrs. Stanhope, ""but I think at a considerable"
6985,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"distance from this place."""
6986,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6987,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"The girl retired, and Mrs. Stanhope reëntered the breakfast room."
6988,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6989,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Who was in the porch?"" inquired Miss Pinkerton, as her sister assumed"
6990,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,her place by the coffee urn.
6991,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6992,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""Mrs. Edson's servant,"" returned she, arranging the cups with an absent"
6993,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,air.
6994,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6995,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""What did she want?"" asked Miss Martha, opening her muffin and dropping"
6996,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,a piece of golden butter on its smoking surface.
6997,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
6998,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""She brought me a note from her mistress,"" said Mrs. Stanhope, ""who has"
6999,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"departed suddenly on a visit to her aunt, and wishes me to superintend"
7000,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"the care of her mansion for a time."""
7001,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
7002,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"""I guess she is coming out of her dumps,"" said Martha. ""I always said"
7003,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,there was no danger of her dying of grief for the loss of a husband.
7004,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"She'll come home one of these days a gay widow, and set her cap for Col."
7005,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"Malcome. I always thought she had a liking for him."""
7006,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,
7007,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,Mrs. Stanhope made no reply to this unfeeling speech. After breakfast
7008,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"the colonel chanced in to take the long-forgotten package away, when he"
7009,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,"learned of Louise's sudden departure, and went home in a state of"

7027,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"The Hermit of the Cedars sat in his antique room alone, by a peat-wood"
7028,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"fire. He appeared wrapt in moody thought and contemplation, though ever"
7029,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"and anon, as the wintry blast gave a wilder sweep over the swaying roof"
7030,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"above him, he turned and glanced uneasily toward the door, as though he"
7031,CHAPTER XXXIX.,wished and waited the appearance of some form over its threshold. But
7032,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"the hours passed on, and no one came to cheer his loneliness. So,"
7033,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"heaping the ashes over the glowing embers, he betook himself to his"
7034,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"lowly couch, but his head had hardly touched the pillow when a quick"
7035,CHAPTER XXXIX.,step crackling along the icy path struck his ear. Ere he could reach the
7036,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"door it was pushed open, and a voice called out hastily, ""Uncle Ralph!"""
7037,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7038,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Edgar, my boy!"" exclaimed the hermit, groping in the darkness to clasp"
7039,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"him in his arms. ""Are you returned at last?"""
7040,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7041,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Yes, dear uncle,"" answered the young man; ""I reached the village by the"
7042,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"evening stage, and hurried with all speed to my old forest home."""
7043,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7044,CHAPTER XXXIX.,The hermit lighted a candle and raked open the coals. A bright fire soon
7045,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"burned on the hearth, and by its ruddy blaze the fond uncle marked the"
7046,CHAPTER XXXIX.,changes two years had wrought in the appearance of his nephew. He was
7047,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"taller, and a manly confidence of tone and manner had succeeded the"
7048,CHAPTER XXXIX.,reserve and timidity which characterized his boyhood. The luxuriant
7049,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"masses of soft brown hair were brushed away from the clear, pale brow,"
7050,CHAPTER XXXIX.,and the deep blue eyes glowed in the conscious light of genius and
7051,CHAPTER XXXIX.,intellectual fervor. The hermit gazed with ardent admiration on the
7052,CHAPTER XXXIX.,commanding elegance and beauty of the form before him.
7053,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7054,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Education and travel have made a wonderful improvement in your"
7055,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"appearance, my boy,"" he remarked at length, his voice trembling with"
7056,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"emotion as he spoke. ""Still I don't know but I liked you better as the"
7057,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"curly-headed boy in morocco cap and little blue frock-coat, that used to"
7058,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"come bounding over the forest path, with his satchel in hand; or set"
7059,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"here of long winter evenings, reading some treasured volume at my side;"
7060,CHAPTER XXXIX.,or perched within the window nook gazing silently upward at the
7061,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"glistening stars;--for the dreamy boy I could keep near me, but the"
7062,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"lofty, ambitious man I cannot hope to prison here in a solitary"
7063,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"wilderness,--nor should I indulge in a wish so selfish,"" he added. ""Tell"
7064,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"me, Edgar, of your travels, your enjoyments and occupations, since you"
7065,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"departed from this lowly roof."""
7066,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7067,CHAPTER XXXIX.,The young man gave a brief rehearsal of the principal events of the past
7068,CHAPTER XXXIX.,two years. He hesitated somewhat when he came to his meeting and renewal
7069,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"of acquaintance with Florence Howard, recollecting his uncle's former"
7070,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"aversion to their intercourse. He might have passed over it in silence,"
7071,CHAPTER XXXIX.,but his delicate sense of honor would not allow him to deceive in the
7072,CHAPTER XXXIX.,smallest point the heart that loved him so devotedly. The listening man
7073,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"bent earnest, scrutinizing glances on the speaker's face as he proceeded"
7074,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"with his tale, and when it was finished, bowed his gray head on his thin"
7075,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"hands, as was his wont when engaged in deep thought, and remained"
7076,CHAPTER XXXIX.,silent.
7077,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7078,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"At length a tremendous blast swept through the forest, blew open the"
7079,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"door, and scattered the coals from the deep fire-place over the floor of"
7080,CHAPTER XXXIX.,the apartment. The moody man started from his reverie. Edgar secured the
7081,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"door, and, taking a broom composed of small sprigs of hemlock and cedar,"
7082,CHAPTER XXXIX.,brushed the scattered embers into a pile.
7083,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7084,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Do you not wish to retire?"" asked the hermit, as the young man resumed"
7085,CHAPTER XXXIX.,his seat in the corner.
7086,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7087,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""As you wish, uncle,"" returned he; ""I do not feel much fatigued."""
7088,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7089,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Ay, but I think you are so,"" said the kind-hearted man, regarding"
7090,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"attentively his nephew's features. ""My joy at beholding you has rendered"
7091,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"me forgetful of your physical comforts. Let me get you some refreshment,"
7092,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"and then you shall lie down and rest your weary limbs."""
7093,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7094,CHAPTER XXXIX.,The hermit took a small brown earthen jug from a rude shelf over the
7095,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"fire-place, and, pouring a portion of its contents into a bright-faced"
7096,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"pewter basin, placed it on a heap of glowing coals. Then going to a"
7097,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"cupboard he brought forth a large wooden bowl, filled with a coarse,"
7098,CHAPTER XXXIX.,white substance. When the contents of the basin were warm he placed it
7099,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"on the table, and setting a chair, said, ""Come, my boy, and partake of"
7100,CHAPTER XXXIX.,this simple food. 'Tis all I have to offer you; not like the dainty
7101,CHAPTER XXXIX.,repasts at which you are accustomed to sit in the abodes of wealth and
7102,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"fashion."""
7103,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7104,CHAPTER XXXIX.,Edgar approached and took the proffered seat.
7105,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7106,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Ay,"" said he; ""you have served me a dish more grateful to my palate"
7107,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"than the most delicately-prepared dainties would prove. This rich, sweet"
7108,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"milk is delicious, and who boils your hominy so nicely, uncle?"" he"
7109,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"continued, conveying several slices of the substance in the wooden bowl"
7110,CHAPTER XXXIX.,to his basin.
7111,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7112,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Dilly Danforth, the poor village washerwoman, cooks it, and her boy,"
7113,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"Willie, brings it to me,"" answered the hermit."
7114,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7115,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Ay, the lad you mentioned in one of your letters,"" said Edgar. ""Why"
7116,CHAPTER XXXIX.,does he not remain with you altogether? You seemed happy in his
7117,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"companionship, and I hoped he might become to you a second Edgar."""
7118,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7119,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"A strange expression passed over the face of the recluse as his nephew,"
7120,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"with much earnest truthfulness of manner, gave utterance to these words."

7122,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""I did like to have the boy with me,"" he remarked; ""but his mother was"

7124,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7125,CHAPTER XXXIX.,Edgar rose from his simple repast.
7126,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7127,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Now you had better retire,"" said his uncle, tenderly; ""though I fear"
7128,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"you will rest but ill on my hard couch."""
7129,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7130,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""My slumbers will be sweet as though I reposed on eider down,"" returned"
7131,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"he, ""if you will but assure me that my coming or words have not marred"
7132,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"your quiet and composure."""
7133,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7134,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""My boy,"" said the hermit, gazing on him anxiously, ""what do you mean?"

7137,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7138,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""I may have spoken words that grieved you,"" said the young man,"

7145,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"Marry Florence Howard if you choose."""
7146,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7147,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Marry her!"" exclaimed Edgar, suddenly breaking in upon his uncle's"

7149,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7150,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""What is his name?"" asked the hermit."

7153,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7154,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""What! a brother to the girl I saw with you on the river bank?"" inquired"

7157,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""Yes,"" said Edgar; ""the brother of Edith Malcome."""
7158,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7159,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"""O, the mysterious workings of fate!"" exclaimed the hermit, falling"
7160,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"again into a ruminating silence, which Edgar did not deem it wise to"
7161,CHAPTER XXXIX.,disturb.
7162,CHAPTER XXXIX.,
7163,CHAPTER XXXIX.,"So they laid down on the lowly couch, and the young man, fatigued with"

7214,CHAPTER XL.,"""I think my father suspects my secret and reproaches himself for giving"
7215,CHAPTER XL.,me so free access to Edgar's company. I would not wonder if the delay he
7216,CHAPTER XL.,has urged to my marriage were influenced as much by this sad knowledge
7217,CHAPTER XL.,"as my mother's failing health. Col. Malcome gave a reluctant assent, at"
7218,CHAPTER XL.,which I am surprised. When his sweet daughter is sinking slowly into
7219,CHAPTER XL.,"the grave, 'tis strange he can think of any earthly interest."
7220,CHAPTER XL.,
7221,CHAPTER XL.,"""I have looked mournfully toward the cedar forest to-night, and thought"

7232,CHAPTER XL.,"Florence closed her journal, and approached the window."
7233,CHAPTER XL.,
7234,CHAPTER XL.,"As she was dropping the curtain to retire, a dark figure moving"
7235,CHAPTER XL.,"stealthily under the leafless branches of the lindens, which stood in"
7236,CHAPTER XL.,"rows on the least public side of the house, arrested her attention. The"
7237,CHAPTER XL.,"remembrance of a similar appearance she had once seen crossed her mind,"
7238,CHAPTER XL.,"and no ill having followed that, she dismissed her fears, and ere long"
7239,CHAPTER XL.,sank to rest.
7240,CHAPTER XL.,
7241,CHAPTER XL.,"When the village clock pealed forth the hour of midnight, the dark"
7242,CHAPTER XL.,"figure she had observed, stood on the terrace below. The hall door swung"
7243,CHAPTER XL.,"noiselessly on its hinges, and Hannah Doliver stepped forth. ""Here are"
7244,CHAPTER XL.,"the matches and kindling-wood,"" said she in a whisper, approaching the"
7245,CHAPTER XL.,"dusky form, and holding a small basket forward."
7246,CHAPTER XL.,
7247,CHAPTER XL.,"""Are they all asleep?"" asked a hushed voice."
7248,CHAPTER XL.,
7249,CHAPTER XL.,"""Yes,"" answered she."
7250,CHAPTER XL.,
7251,CHAPTER XL.,"""See that you give the alarm in season,"" returned the muffled figure, as"
7252,CHAPTER XL.,"he took the basket from the woman's hand, and passed softly down the"
7253,CHAPTER XL.,steps of the piazza.
7254,CHAPTER XL.,
7255,CHAPTER XL.,Silently the destroying fires were lighted. But the midnight incendiary
7256,CHAPTER XL.,"would have proceeded less deliberately with his work of destruction, had"
7257,CHAPTER XL.,"he marked the tall, lank figure in a long, dark overcoat, and"
7258,CHAPTER XL.,"slouching-brimmed hat, which slowly dogged closely his every footstep."
7259,CHAPTER XL.,Suddenly a bright flash leaped up from the fragments the wicked man
7260,CHAPTER XL.,"sought to enkindle, and revealed his garb and features. A mingled"
7261,CHAPTER XL.,expression of hatred and revenge glared from the sunken eyes of his
7262,CHAPTER XL.,"follower, who stood in the shadow of a linden near by, as the pale,"
7263,CHAPTER XL.,"handsome features and light, curling locks of the incendiary met his"
7264,CHAPTER XL.,gaze.
7265,CHAPTER XL.,
7266,CHAPTER XL.,"""Villain!"" exclaimed he, springing forward, as the man turned with a"
7267,CHAPTER XL.,"hurried step from his work of destruction; ""would you burn innocent"
7268,CHAPTER XL.,"people in their beds?"""
7269,CHAPTER XL.,
7270,CHAPTER XL.,"With one fell blow the man dashed the lank form to the earth, and fled"
7271,CHAPTER XL.,"down the avenue of cedars, which led to the river, never heeding the"
7272,CHAPTER XL.,"startled looks of a thin woman, and tall, graceful youth, against whose"
7273,CHAPTER XL.,sides he brushed in his guilty flight.
7274,CHAPTER XL.,
7275,CHAPTER XL.,"""Who could that flying figure have been?"" asked the lad of the woman,"

7277,CHAPTER XL.,
7278,CHAPTER XL.,"""I don't know, indeed, Willie,"" answered she, ""unless it was your"

7280,CHAPTER XL.,"usual for several days."""
7281,CHAPTER XL.,
7282,CHAPTER XL.,"""O, no!"" returned the youth; ""it was not the hermit. I distinguished"
7283,CHAPTER XL.,"this man's features very plainly as he passed, and it was no one I ever"
7284,CHAPTER XL.,"saw before. He had no covering on his head, and his hair was light and"
7285,CHAPTER XL.,"curly. His face seemed glowing with rage and anger."""
7286,CHAPTER XL.,
7287,CHAPTER XL.,"""It must have been some lunatic escaped from the asylum,"" said the"
7288,CHAPTER XL.,woman.
7289,CHAPTER XL.,
7290,CHAPTER XL.,"""Well, I think you are right, mother,"" answered the boy. ""I hope he has"
7291,CHAPTER XL.,"not harmed the poor hermit, whom I left sitting on a stone among the"
7292,CHAPTER XL.,"cedars, near Major Howard's mansion. He came thus far with me to-night,"
7293,CHAPTER XL.,"as it was so late, and the way long and gloomy."""
7294,CHAPTER XL.,
7295,CHAPTER XL.,"""Ah! he was very kind,"" remarked the woman. ""I began to fear you were"
7296,CHAPTER XL.,"not coming for me, Willie, and thought I should have to remain at Mr."
7297,CHAPTER XL.,"Pimble's all night, or go home alone. Is the hermit's nephew still with"
7298,CHAPTER XL.,"him?"""
7299,CHAPTER XL.,
7300,CHAPTER XL.,"""No, he went away this morning, and the poor old man is very lonely and"
7301,CHAPTER XL.,"sad. He said he wished I could be with him all the time."""
7302,CHAPTER XL.,
7303,CHAPTER XL.,"""Strange being!"" said the woman. ""Why does he not leave the forest, and"
7304,CHAPTER XL.,"dwell among his fellow-men?"""
7305,CHAPTER XL.,
7306,CHAPTER XL.,"""I think it is because he experienced some disappointment in his youth,"""
7307,CHAPTER XL.,"answered the lad, ""and has come to distrust all his species."""
7308,CHAPTER XL.,
7309,CHAPTER XL.,"""It may be so,"" returned the woman. ""I have heard of such instances. He"
7310,CHAPTER XL.,"is very kind to you, my boy, and but for his little bundles of sticks, I"
7311,CHAPTER XL.,think we must have perished during your long illness through that
7312,CHAPTER XL.,piercing cold winter. Strange are the realities of life; stranger than
7313,CHAPTER XL.,"fiction! When the rich Mr. Pimble drove me from his threshold, the poor"
7314,CHAPTER XL.,"hermit of the forest braved the bleak storms, and laid the charitable"
7315,CHAPTER XL.,"piles on my poverty-stricken threshold."""
7316,CHAPTER XL.,
7317,CHAPTER XL.,The mother and son had now reached their humble abode.
7318,CHAPTER XL.,
7319,CHAPTER XL.,"""Willie,"" said she, ""I wish you would run down by the river and gather"

7321,CHAPTER XL.,"wind is rising fast, and they will blow away before morning."""
7322,CHAPTER XL.,
7323,CHAPTER XL.,"The boy hastened to perform her request, and in a few moments came"
7324,CHAPTER XL.,"rushing into the house, and exclaimed:"
7325,CHAPTER XL.,
7326,CHAPTER XL.,"""Mother! mother! Major Howard's house is all on fire! I am going up"
7327,CHAPTER XL.,"there,"" and, flinging the pieces he held in his arms on the table, he"
7328,CHAPTER XL.,flew off toward the burning mansion.
7329,CHAPTER XL.,
7330,CHAPTER XL.,Mrs. Danforth followed him to the door and discovered his words were but
7331,CHAPTER XL.,"too true. Long tongues of flame darted upward to the sky, and ran"
7332,CHAPTER XL.,fiercely over the walls and terraces of the mansion. The church bell was
7333,CHAPTER XL.,pealing madly to rouse the slumbering people to the rescue; but the fire
7334,CHAPTER XL.,"gained so rapidly in the sweeping wind, all efforts to quench it could"
7335,CHAPTER XL.,not prove otherwise than futile. To save the lives of the inmates would
7336,CHAPTER XL.,"be the utmost which could be done, and even this seemed a perilous"
7337,CHAPTER XL.,undertaking.
7338,CHAPTER XL.,
7339,CHAPTER XL.,"Willie Danforth was rushing up the avenue of cedars, when, just as he"
7340,CHAPTER XL.,"was entering the grounds of the burning mansion, he stumbled over some"

7342,CHAPTER XL.,"glare of the flames, he discovered the body of his friend, the hermit,"
7343,CHAPTER XL.,lying at full length upon the frozen ground. The prostrate man opened
7344,CHAPTER XL.,his eyes and recognized Willie.
7345,CHAPTER XL.,
7346,CHAPTER XL.,"""O, my good boy, I am sadly hurt!"" said he, feebly. ""Will you help me to"
7347,CHAPTER XL.,"rise and get away from this place?"""
7348,CHAPTER XL.,
7349,CHAPTER XL.,"Willie, who forgot everything, even the burning mansion before him, in"
7350,CHAPTER XL.,"care and pity for his friend, raised him to his feet, and half"
7351,CHAPTER XL.,"supporting the tall, thin form in his young, strong arms, drew him down"
7352,CHAPTER XL.,the long avenue and along the river bank to his mother's dwelling.
7353,CHAPTER XL.,
7354,CHAPTER XL.,And that night the insensible form of the Hermit of the Cedars lay
7355,CHAPTER XL.,stretched upon the low couch of Dilly Danforth's humble abode.

7372,CHAPTER XLI.,Col. Malcome flung wide the doors of his elegant mansion to receive the
7373,CHAPTER XLI.,"suffering family who, in the space of a few short hours, had lost their"
7374,CHAPTER XLI.,all of earthly wealth by the subtle element of fire. The invalided Mrs.
7375,CHAPTER XLI.,Howard was borne on a litter to an apartment so warm and complete in its
7376,CHAPTER XLI.,"arrangements, as to almost wear the appearance of having been fitted up"
7377,CHAPTER XLI.,expressly to receive her in her forlorn and unsheltered condition.
7378,CHAPTER XLI.,"Large, richly-furnished rooms, all glowing bright in their luxurious"
7379,CHAPTER XLI.,"comforts, were also in readiness for Florence and her father. The latter"
7380,CHAPTER XLI.,was nearly overwhelmed with grief and dismay at his sudden and
7381,CHAPTER XLI.,irremediable loss. Col. Malcome strove by every means in his power to
7382,CHAPTER XLI.,assuage and lighten his sorrows.
7383,CHAPTER XLI.,
7384,CHAPTER XLI.,"""My house is your home as long as you choose to make it so, Major"
7385,CHAPTER XLI.,"Howard,"" said he one morning after the afflicted family had been several"

7387,CHAPTER XLI.,
7388,CHAPTER XLI.,"""I cannot consent to burden you with my family any longer than while I"
7389,CHAPTER XLI.,"can find some place to which I can remove them,"" answered he. ""And then"
7390,CHAPTER XLI.,I must engage in some kind of business to provide for their support.
7391,CHAPTER XLI.,"This unfortunate accident has given my wife so dreadful a shock, I fear"
7392,CHAPTER XLI.,"she will not long survive it."""
7393,CHAPTER XLI.,
7394,CHAPTER XLI.,A significant smile appeared for a moment on Col. Malcome's features at
7395,CHAPTER XLI.,"these latter words, but he concealed it from the distressed man, and"
7396,CHAPTER XLI.,"replied, ""It grieves me to hear you talk thus. Why should you regard"
7397,CHAPTER XLI.,"your family as burdensome guests beneath my roof, when we are soon to be"
7398,CHAPTER XLI.,"linked in the ties of relationship by the union of our children?"""
7399,CHAPTER XLI.,
7400,CHAPTER XLI.,"""True!"" returned Major Howard. ""Such a union has been proposed, but----"""
7401,CHAPTER XLI.,
7402,CHAPTER XLI.,"""But what?"" asked Col. M."
7403,CHAPTER XLI.,
7404,CHAPTER XLI.,"""You may not look as favorably on its consummation now as formerly."""
7405,CHAPTER XLI.,
7406,CHAPTER XLI.,"""Judge not so meanly of me, my friend!"" said he, warmly. ""Your"
7407,CHAPTER XLI.,daughter's rich soul and personal charms are all the wealth I desire in
7408,CHAPTER XLI.,"the lady who shall become the wife of my son."""
7409,CHAPTER XLI.,
7410,CHAPTER XLI.,Major Howard was silent.
7411,CHAPTER XLI.,
7412,CHAPTER XLI.,"""I do not wish to hasten this marriage,"" resumed the colonel, ""because"
7413,CHAPTER XLI.,"you expressed a desire, several months ago, that it should be delayed"
7414,CHAPTER XLI.,till a change occurred in your wife's situation (a strange emphasis on
7415,CHAPTER XLI.,"the word _wife_); but were it consummated, your family could occupy"
7416,CHAPTER XLI.,one-half of my mansion with no expense to me till Rufus should rebuild
7417,CHAPTER XLI.,"the one you have recently lost by fire."""
7418,CHAPTER XLI.,
7419,CHAPTER XLI.,Major Howard's face suddenly brightened. The colonel saw he had made a
7420,CHAPTER XLI.,"hit, and followed up his advantage so adroitly that e'er the twain"
7421,CHAPTER XLI.,"parted, the father had consented that the marriage between his daughter"
7422,CHAPTER XLI.,and the colonel's son should take place within four weeks. He sought his
7423,CHAPTER XLI.,daughter and communicated the intelligence. Florence received it in
7424,CHAPTER XLI.,"silence. She felt they were without a home in the wide world, and at the"
7425,CHAPTER XLI.,mercy of the man under whose roof they were sheltered. A strange horror
7426,CHAPTER XLI.,was seizing upon her soul and bowing her spirits to the earth. There
7427,CHAPTER XLI.,were many looks and glances around her she could not understand; but
7428,CHAPTER XLI.,they seemed possessed of some dark and hidden meaning. Hannah Doliver's
7429,CHAPTER XLI.,"glee knew no bounds. She followed Rufus from morning till night, and"
7430,CHAPTER XLI.,appeared uneasy if he was a moment beyond her sight. The young man
7431,CHAPTER XLI.,"returned her fondness with hatred and contempt. Edith, with her pale,"
7432,CHAPTER XLI.,"wan face and sunken eyes, looked the mere shadow of her former self."
7433,CHAPTER XLI.,"During her long illness, her beautiful head had been shorn of its ripply"
7434,CHAPTER XLI.,"wealth of auburn curls, and, as she lay languidly on the soft cushions"
7435,CHAPTER XLI.,"of her luxuriant couch, few would have recognized in that wasted form"
7436,CHAPTER XLI.,the once radiant Edith Malcome. She had a feverishness and uncertainty
7437,CHAPTER XLI.,of temper common to long-confined invalids. Florence could find little
7438,CHAPTER XLI.,"companionship in her society; besides, she was too weak to endure the"
7439,CHAPTER XLI.,excitement of laughter and conversation.
7440,CHAPTER XLI.,
7441,CHAPTER XLI.,Rufus sought his affianced bride at every opportunity; and the only
7442,CHAPTER XLI.,place where she could rest secure from his interruptions was the
7443,CHAPTER XLI.,"apartment of her mother, where he never ventured to intrude, being"
7444,CHAPTER XLI.,possessed of a strange fear and dread of sick people. He never visited
7445,CHAPTER XLI.,"Edith, unless compelled to do so by his father."
7446,CHAPTER XLI.,
7447,CHAPTER XLI.,Florence was one day sitting in the deep recess of one of the
7448,CHAPTER XLI.,"drawing-room windows, with the massy folds of purple damask drooped"
7449,CHAPTER XLI.,"before her, occupied in the perusal of a book of poems, when a"
7450,CHAPTER XLI.,"succession of low, murmuring sounds near by, disturbed her, and"
7451,CHAPTER XLI.,"listening a moment she heard Col. Malcome say, in a smothered tone,"
7452,CHAPTER XLI.,"""There's no fear of detection; all moves on bravely, and we shall have a"
7453,CHAPTER XLI.,"blooming young bride here in a few weeks."""
7454,CHAPTER XLI.,
7455,CHAPTER XLI.,"Then there was a low, chuckling laugh, which Florence recognized as"
7456,CHAPTER XLI.,"Hannah Doliver's. After a while the woman spoke in a stifled voice,"
7457,CHAPTER XLI.,"""Don't you want to see _her_?"" she said. ""I should think you would."""
7458,CHAPTER XLI.,"There was a slight malice in her tone, which appeared to irritate him"
7459,CHAPTER XLI.,somewhat.
7460,CHAPTER XLI.,
7461,CHAPTER XLI.,"""I can wait very well till the ceremony is performed,"" he answered at"
7462,CHAPTER XLI.,"length. ""Of course, she will appear at the marriage of her daughter."" A"
7463,CHAPTER XLI.,strange emphasis on the last word.
7464,CHAPTER XLI.,
7465,CHAPTER XLI.,"""But come,"" he added directly, ""we must not linger here. Some of the"
7466,CHAPTER XLI.,"family may observe us."""
7467,CHAPTER XLI.,
7468,CHAPTER XLI.,"Thus speaking, they passed out of the apartment, relieving Florence of"
7469,CHAPTER XLI.,the fear with which she had been shaking during their whole conversation
7470,CHAPTER XLI.,lest they should discover her retreat in the window.
7471,CHAPTER XLI.,
7472,CHAPTER XLI.,"When they were gone, she clasped her hands, and exclaimed in a low, but"
7473,CHAPTER XLI.,"fervent tone, ""Will no arm save me from the power into which I have"
7474,CHAPTER XLI.,"fallen?"""
7475,CHAPTER XLI.,
7476,CHAPTER XLI.,For several days she sought an opportunity to speak privately with her
7477,CHAPTER XLI.,"father, but his attention was so incessantly occupied by Col. Malcome,"
7478,CHAPTER XLI.,that none presented.
7479,CHAPTER XLI.,
7480,CHAPTER XLI.,"When at last she gained his ear, he laughed her suspicions to scorn, and"
7481,CHAPTER XLI.,bade her never come to him with such an idle tale again.
7482,CHAPTER XLI.,
7483,CHAPTER XLI.,"The good-natured major was infatuated by, what he termed, the munificent"
7484,CHAPTER XLI.,"magnanimity of Col. Malcome, and, moreover, had been nurtured in"
7485,CHAPTER XLI.,"luxurious tastes, and the prospect of reïnstating himself in an elegant"
7486,CHAPTER XLI.,"home by so easy a process as the marriage of his daughter, was too"

7574,CHAPTER XLII.,"not last long,"" she added, with a spice of her old spirit."
7575,CHAPTER XLII.,
7576,CHAPTER XLII.,"""And when it passed away,"" said her aunt."
7577,CHAPTER XLII.,
7578,CHAPTER XLII.,"""Don't recall those terrible hours to my mind,"" interrupted Louise,"
7579,CHAPTER XLII.,"quickly, ""lest I should forget the double share of respect I owe the"
7580,CHAPTER XLII.,"dead in that I failed to give them their due on earth."""
7581,CHAPTER XLII.,
7582,CHAPTER XLII.,"""I would not have the dead wronged,"" returned her aunt; ""but I would"
7583,CHAPTER XLII.,have the living righted. You used to be free and unrestrained in your
7584,CHAPTER XLII.,intercourse with me in the glad days of childhood and youth. I often
7585,CHAPTER XLII.,feared some envious sorrow would overtake you to chill and despoil that
7586,CHAPTER XLII.,buoyant exuberance of life and gayety. You were too wildly rich in heart
7587,CHAPTER XLII.,and soul. You wasted more love on a pet rabbit than would eke out the
7588,CHAPTER XLII.,"whole passion life of a score of poorer natures. O, Louise, I trembled"
7589,CHAPTER XLII.,when you stood before the altar and took the vows of faithfulness to Mr.
7590,CHAPTER XLII.,"Leroy Edson. I knew you fancied that you loved him, and thought in the"
7591,CHAPTER XLII.,wild potency of your passion to bear him skyward on your soaring
7592,CHAPTER XLII.,"pinions; but, ah! I saw how sadly his clogging weight would drag you to"
7593,CHAPTER XLII.,"the earth."""
7594,CHAPTER XLII.,
7595,CHAPTER XLII.,"She paused, and Louise was silent, but her face showed traces of tears."
7596,CHAPTER XLII.,
7597,CHAPTER XLII.,"""Do not think me severe,"" resumed her aunt; ""I am only just. Now tell me"
7598,CHAPTER XLII.,"with your old-time confidence, why did you love another man while your"
7599,CHAPTER XLII.,"husband lived?"""
7600,CHAPTER XLII.,
7601,CHAPTER XLII.,"""It was because,""---- Louise hesitated, and then added, ""because I was"
7602,CHAPTER XLII.,"wicked."""
7603,CHAPTER XLII.,
7604,CHAPTER XLII.,"""And for what other reason?"" pursued her aunt."
7605,CHAPTER XLII.,
7606,CHAPTER XLII.,"""And because I was tired,"" Louise went on in a dreamy tone, as if"
7607,CHAPTER XLII.,"thinking aloud to herself, ""and because I was hungry."""
7608,CHAPTER XLII.,
7609,CHAPTER XLII.,"""Your expressions begin to assume the old, quaint, humorous form,"" said"
7610,CHAPTER XLII.,"the aunt smiling. ""I suppose you mean your soul was tired for want of"
7611,CHAPTER XLII.,"something on which to rest, and hungry for want of its proper"
7612,CHAPTER XLII.,"nourishment."""
7613,CHAPTER XLII.,
7614,CHAPTER XLII.,"""That's what I mean, aunt; but then I do not seek excuse for the crime"
7615,CHAPTER XLII.,"of stealing to appease the cravings of my hunger."""
7616,CHAPTER XLII.,
7617,CHAPTER XLII.,"""A famishing man has never yet been hung for stealing to sustain life."""
7618,CHAPTER XLII.,
7619,CHAPTER XLII.,"""You draw a strong comparison, aunt,"" said Louise, laughing in spite of"
7620,CHAPTER XLII.,herself.
7621,CHAPTER XLII.,
7622,CHAPTER XLII.,"""To meet a strong case,"" returned she. ""It is a duty I owe you to use my"
7623,CHAPTER XLII.,best efforts to destroy this morbid melancholy which is preying on your
7624,CHAPTER XLII.,spirits. I know nothing of the man you have loved. He may or may not be
7625,CHAPTER XLII.,worthy of your affections. It is not his cause I plead. But I would
7626,CHAPTER XLII.,"divest you of the false glasses through which your sensitive brain,"
7627,CHAPTER XLII.,"wrought on by high excitement, and shocked by a sudden calamity, has"
7628,CHAPTER XLII.,"come to regard the events of your past life, and let you behold them"
7629,CHAPTER XLII.,"again with your own natural sight. If I can effect this, I confidently"
7630,CHAPTER XLII.,"trust to your good reasoning powers to set all right again."""
7631,CHAPTER XLII.,
7632,CHAPTER XLII.,"Louise remained silent after her aunt ceased speaking, but her"
7633,CHAPTER XLII.,countenance evinced far more energy and hopefulness than at the
7634,CHAPTER XLII.,"commencement of the conversation. At length she rose and said, ""Well,"
7635,CHAPTER XLII.,"aunt, I think I have as much logic as my weak brain can digest in one"
7636,CHAPTER XLII.,"night, so I'll retire to my bed-room, if you please."""
7637,CHAPTER XLII.,
7638,CHAPTER XLII.,"In a few weeks, young Mrs. Edson, under the tuition of her"
7639,CHAPTER XLII.,"strong-minded, sensible aunt, regained a share of her former vivacity,"
7640,CHAPTER XLII.,and declared she would be quite herself again were it not for that great
7641,CHAPTER XLII.,"black jail in the adjoining yard, which frowned on her every morning and"
7642,CHAPTER XLII.,loomed dismally in her dreams.
7643,CHAPTER XLII.,

7648,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7649,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Ah, why"
7650,CHAPTER XLIII.,"Do you still keep apart, and walk alone,"
7651,CHAPTER XLIII.,"And let such strong emotions stamp your brow,"
7652,CHAPTER XLIII.,"As not betraying their full import, yet"
7653,CHAPTER XLIII.,Disclose too much!
7654,CHAPTER XLIII.,Disclose too much!--of what?
7655,CHAPTER XLIII.,What is there to disclose?
7656,CHAPTER XLIII.,"A heart so ill at ease."""
7657,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7658,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7659,CHAPTER XLIII.,The preparations for the nuptials of Florence Howard with Rufus Malcome
7660,CHAPTER XLIII.,were rapidly progressing.
7661,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7662,CHAPTER XLIII.,The services of Dilly Danforth were put in active requisition. Day after
7663,CHAPTER XLIII.,"day her tall, thin form was seen moving to and fro the great mansion,"
7664,CHAPTER XLIII.,"washing windows, polishing grates, and brightening the silver knobs and"
7665,CHAPTER XLIII.,"plates of the mahogany doors. Col. Malcome, in his delight at the"
7666,CHAPTER XLIII.,"approaching marriage of his son, resolved to give a large fête on the"
7667,CHAPTER XLIII.,"occasion, and no pains were spared to render it the most costly and"
7668,CHAPTER XLIII.,sumptuous affair ever presented to the gaze of the people of Wimbledon.
7669,CHAPTER XLIII.,"The greatest expense was lavished upon the wedding-banquet, and the"
7670,CHAPTER XLIII.,young bride's trousseau might have vied in magnificence and profusion
7671,CHAPTER XLIII.,with that of a royal princess.
7672,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7673,CHAPTER XLIII.,All this display and grandeur was revolting to Florence. It humbled and
7674,CHAPTER XLIII.,"mortified her proud, independent nature to owe the expensive decoration"
7675,CHAPTER XLIII.,of her approaching bridal to the generosity of the man she was about to
7676,CHAPTER XLIII.,marry.
7677,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7678,CHAPTER XLIII.,Col. Malcome appeared in the most fitful spirits as the preparations
7679,CHAPTER XLIII.,advanced toward their completion. He paced the piazzas for hours
7680,CHAPTER XLIII.,"together, with hurried, excited steps, pausing often and muttering"
7681,CHAPTER XLIII.,indistinctly to himself.
7682,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7683,CHAPTER XLIII.,"Sometimes he stood before a window in a dejected attitude, and gazed"
7684,CHAPTER XLIII.,mournfully over the intervening gardens and cottages toward the elegant
7685,CHAPTER XLIII.,"and stately mansion lately occupied by the Edsons, which stood on a"
7686,CHAPTER XLIII.,"small elevation just across the river, in the midst of beautiful"
7687,CHAPTER XLIII.,"grounds. Then, as he turned suddenly away, his countenance would change"
7688,CHAPTER XLIII.,from its expression of gloomy regret to one of fierceness and angry
7689,CHAPTER XLIII.,revenge.
7690,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7691,CHAPTER XLIII.,"At length the night, whose morrow was to witness the long-expected"
7692,CHAPTER XLIII.,"ceremony, drew on. Great torrents of rain were flooding the streets and"
7693,CHAPTER XLIII.,"dashing dismally against the casements of the mansion which was, ere"
7694,CHAPTER XLIII.,"long, to blaze in the light of the festive scene."
7695,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7696,CHAPTER XLIII.,"Still, Col. Malcome, unheeding the storm, walked the wet marbles of the"
7697,CHAPTER XLIII.,"piazzas, with arms folded over his chest and head bowed, in a state of"
7698,CHAPTER XLIII.,"absent, moody absorption. At length the hall-door opened, and Rufus"
7699,CHAPTER XLIII.,advanced to his father's side.
7700,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7701,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""What do you want with me?"" said the colonel, turning quickly toward"
7702,CHAPTER XLIII.,him.
7703,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7704,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Not much,"" returned the son. ""I heard you walking here, and thought I"
7705,CHAPTER XLIII.,"would join you, as there was no one in the house to keep me company."""
7706,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7707,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Where is Major Howard?"""
7708,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7709,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""With his wife,"" answered Rufus."
7710,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7711,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""And Hannah?"" continued the colonel."
7712,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7713,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Don't mention that detestable creature!"" said the young man angrily. ""I"
7714,CHAPTER XLIII.,"can't abide her. So she is out of my sight, I care not where she is."""
7715,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7716,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Why do you hate the woman so?"" asked Col. M. ""She seems very fond of"
7717,CHAPTER XLIII.,"you."""
7718,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7719,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Yes! I cannot move but what she follows me. It is strange Major Howard"
7720,CHAPTER XLIII.,"retains such a bold, impudent slut in his service."""
7721,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7722,CHAPTER XLIII.,The colonel coughed slightly and remained silent.
7723,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7724,CHAPTER XLIII.,"At length Rufus spoke again hesitatingly, ""Father!"" said he."
7725,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7726,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Well!"" returned Col. M., in a tone which indicated for him to proceed."
7727,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7728,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""I don't want to marry Florence Howard,"" said the young man, with a"
7729,CHAPTER XLIII.,"great gulp, as though it cost him a mighty effort to pronounce the"
7730,CHAPTER XLIII.,words.
7731,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7732,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Why not?"" asked the father, apparently unheeding his son's emotion."
7733,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Don't you love the girl?"""
7734,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7735,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Love her!"" repeated Rufus. ""I don't know whether I do or not; but I am"
7736,CHAPTER XLIII.,"afraid of her."""
7737,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7738,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Afraid of a little, puny girl!"" exclaimed Col. Malcome, in a towering"
7739,CHAPTER XLIII.,"rage, ""I did not think you such a pitiful craven."""
7740,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7741,CHAPTER XLIII.,"The young man seemed angered by his father's words, but made no retort."
7742,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7743,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Why are you afraid of her?"" inquired the colonel after a while."
7744,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7745,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""Because she looks so proud and stern upon me, and treats me with such"
7746,CHAPTER XLIII.,"scorn and contempt."""
7747,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7748,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""O, never mind that!"" said his father. ""When she is once your wife trust"
7749,CHAPTER XLIII.,"me to lower her loftiness, and make her as meek and humble as you could"
7750,CHAPTER XLIII.,wish. Let us go in now. How wildly this storm is driving! I hope it may
7751,CHAPTER XLIII.,"clear before the hour for the marriage arrives."" Thus speaking, the"
7752,CHAPTER XLIII.,father and son entered the hall and sought their respective apartments.
7753,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7754,CHAPTER XLIII.,"While this scene was passing on the piazza, Florence sat in her room"
7755,CHAPTER XLIII.,with her journal open on the table before her.
7756,CHAPTER XLIII.,
7757,CHAPTER XLIII.,"""The last evening of my free, unfettered existence has drawn on,"" she"
7758,CHAPTER XLIII.,"wrote. ""How wildly shrieks the wind, driving great torrents of rain"
7759,CHAPTER XLIII.,against my curtained casements! It is fit a night like this should usher
7760,CHAPTER XLIII.,"in my day of doom. Father seems delighted with the approaching festival,"
7761,CHAPTER XLIII.,"and mother has lost the dread she formerly evinced, which I now think"
7762,CHAPTER XLIII.,was occasioned by the fear of losing me from her side. Hannah is almost
7763,CHAPTER XLIII.,wild with glee. She follows the steps of Rufus closely as his shadow. He
7764,CHAPTER XLIII.,"hates her, and in this one point our feelings sympathize, but in no"
7765,CHAPTER XLIII.,other. It is impossible to describe the loathing and abhorrence with
7766,CHAPTER XLIII.,"which I regard the man who in a few more hours will be my husband. O,"
7767,CHAPTER XLIII.,heavens! will no power save me from a fate so dreadful as a lifetime
7768,CHAPTER XLIII.,"passed with him? Alas, no! Our beautiful home is gone, and we are poor,"
7769,CHAPTER XLIII.,"and had been shelterless but for these walls, which opened their doors"
7770,CHAPTER XLIII.,to take us in. And can I make so poor a return for this friendly
7771,CHAPTER XLIII.,"generosity, or so ungratefully scorn and reject the means presented to"
7772,CHAPTER XLIII.,"reïnstate my father in wealth and magnificence, as to refuse to perform"
7773,CHAPTER XLIII.,the act which will repay the kindness and restore to him the elegant
7774,CHAPTER XLIII.,"home whose loss he so deeply deplores? O, no! I must not be so selfish"
7775,CHAPTER XLIII.,"and ungrateful. Still, it seems a great sacrifice even to insure a"
7776,CHAPTER XLIII.,father's ease and happiness. I have an increasing dread and horror of
7777,CHAPTER XLIII.,"this Col. Malcome, which I cannot overcome, despite all his apparent"
7778,CHAPTER XLIII.,"generosity and sympathy in our misfortune, and lavish display of"
7779,CHAPTER XLIII.,profusion and splendor with which he surrounds this approaching bridal.
7780,CHAPTER XLIII.,It seems to me all this munificence goes to serve some fell purpose of
7781,CHAPTER XLIII.,his own. His strange power over my easy-natured father excites dark
7782,CHAPTER XLIII.,"apprehensions in my bosom. But why torture myself with imagined ills,"
7783,CHAPTER XLIII.,"when the dread realities are sufficient to unnerve my soul! Now, amid"
7784,CHAPTER XLIII.,"this piteous wailing of storm and wind, I write the last words on these"
7785,CHAPTER XLIII.,"dear old leaves as Florence Howard, and betake me to my pillow,--but O,"
7786,CHAPTER XLIII.,not to sleep! The bride of to-morrow will make a sorry figure in her
7787,CHAPTER XLIII.,"silks and jewels."""

7797,CHAPTER XLIV.,"When comes the trial hour."""
7798,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7799,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7800,CHAPTER XLIV.,"The hour drew on; the guests assembled, and the minister waited the"
7801,CHAPTER XLIV.,entrance of the bridal party to perform the solemn ceremony.
7802,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7803,CHAPTER XLIV.,"The storm drove wildly without the mansion, in strange contrast with the"
7804,CHAPTER XLIV.,glowing warmth and luxuriance of the apartments within.
7805,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7806,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Col. Malcome sat on a velvet sofa, in graceful attire, supporting the"
7807,CHAPTER XLIV.,"wasted form of his daughter; who, thin, pale, and white as the garb she"
7808,CHAPTER XLIV.,"wore, leaned her head, all shorn of its beautiful curls, heavily against"
7809,CHAPTER XLIV.,"his shoulder. It was a sad sight to behold that feeble, emaciated figure"
7810,CHAPTER XLIV.,"rising from a bed of disease and pain, to mingle among the festive"
7811,CHAPTER XLIV.,groups which filled those splendid drawing-rooms.
7812,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7813,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Suddenly there was a stir in the hall, and the bridal group entered."
7814,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Florence, with the tips of her gloved fingers just touching the arm of"
7815,CHAPTER XLIV.,"the man who was in a few moments to become her husband, moved gracefully"
7816,CHAPTER XLIV.,to the seat assigned her. She was magnificently arrayed in rose-colored
7817,CHAPTER XLIV.,"satin, with an over-skirt of elegantly-wrought Parisian lace, and a"
7818,CHAPTER XLIV.,spray of pearls and diamonds flashed their brilliant rays through the
7819,CHAPTER XLIV.,"luxuriant dark curls that clustered round her pale, sweet brow, and fell"
7820,CHAPTER XLIV.,"in rich profusion over her white, uncovered shoulders."
7821,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7822,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Rufus was arrayed in a glossy garb of the finest black broadcloth, with"
7823,CHAPTER XLIV.,"a spotless vest of pearl-tinted satin, and immaculate white kids. His"
7824,CHAPTER XLIV.,"dark visage, small, peering black eyes, and low-bred, clownish aspect,"
7825,CHAPTER XLIV.,contrasted strangely with the brilliant creature at his side.
7826,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7827,CHAPTER XLIV.,"The maids and groomsmen were in splendid attire, and looked proud and"
7828,CHAPTER XLIV.,delighted with the notice their position attracted from the assembled
7829,CHAPTER XLIV.,groups.
7830,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7831,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Then came Major Howard, with a beaming countenance; his invalid lady,"
7832,CHAPTER XLIV.,who had summoned all her strength and fortitude to be present on the
7833,CHAPTER XLIV.,"occasion, leaning on his arm."
7834,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7835,CHAPTER XLIV.,Col. Malcome rose politely and gave her a seat on the sofa beside his
7836,CHAPTER XLIV.,"daughter, assuming himself a chair on the opposite side of the room."
7837,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7838,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Hannah Doliver, in a very elaborate dress of gay plaided silk, her jet"
7839,CHAPTER XLIV.,"black hair twisted into wiry ringlets, sat before her mistress, holding"
7840,CHAPTER XLIV.,"a fan and silver vial, to serve the invalid's need, should the unusual"
7841,CHAPTER XLIV.,excitement produce a sudden nervous attack.
7842,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7843,CHAPTER XLIV.,A significant glance was exchanged between Major Howard and Col.
7844,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Malcome, when the latter arose, and, bowing to the clergyman who was to"
7845,CHAPTER XLIV.,"officiate on the occasion, said: ""All is in readiness to proceed with"
7846,CHAPTER XLIV.,"the ceremony."""
7847,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7848,CHAPTER XLIV.,"The man of God came slowly forward, with a grave and solemn aspect. As"
7849,CHAPTER XLIV.,"he was about to request the bridal group to rise, a stamping of heavy"
7850,CHAPTER XLIV.,feet on the piazza outside the windows arrested his words; and directly
7851,CHAPTER XLIV.,"the hall door was flung open with furious vehemence, and a party,"
7852,CHAPTER XLIV.,"consisting of four tall, brawny men, in dripping hats and overcoats,"
7853,CHAPTER XLIV.,"rushed into the apartment, leaving the door wide open behind them, with"
7854,CHAPTER XLIV.,the storm rushing in upon the assembly in its wildest fury.
7855,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7856,CHAPTER XLIV.,"Col. Malcome sprang to his feet, his face glowing with anger at this"
7857,CHAPTER XLIV.,most untimely and insulting intrusion.
7858,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7859,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""_Arrest that man!_"" exclaimed the foremost of the strangers, pointing"
7860,CHAPTER XLIV.,"his arm toward the form of the colonel, who stood glowering upon the"
7861,CHAPTER XLIV.,speaker with wrathful aspect.
7862,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7863,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""For what?"" said Major Howard, leaping from his seat, as two strong men"
7864,CHAPTER XLIV.,rushed forward to execute the command.
7865,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7866,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""For destroying your buildings by fire, on the night of the twelfth of"

7868,CHAPTER XLIV.,now recognized as the sheriff of the county.
7869,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7870,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""Prove your words! prove your words!"" exclaimed Col. Malcome, darting"
7871,CHAPTER XLIV.,back from the grasp of the men who approached to imprison him.
7872,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7873,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""I am prepared to do so,"" returned the sheriff, motioning a tall, lank"
7874,CHAPTER XLIV.,"form, in a long overcoat and broad-brimmed hat, which stood near the"
7875,CHAPTER XLIV.,"door, to advance."
7876,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7877,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""You were in the grounds adjoining Major Howard's mansion on the night"

7880,CHAPTER XLIV.,"collar and hat-brim, as to be indiscernible."
7881,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7882,CHAPTER XLIV.,The figure bowed low in token of assent.
7883,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7884,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""What did you see there?"""
7885,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7886,CHAPTER XLIV.,"The _Hermit of the Cedars_ hesitated a moment, as if to collect his"
7887,CHAPTER XLIV.,"thoughts, while the gaze of every person in the room was riveted upon"
7888,CHAPTER XLIV.,"him, and a breathless silence reigned as he commenced to speak in a low,"
7889,CHAPTER XLIV.,measured tone of assurance and courage.
7890,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7891,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""I saw a man in dark clothes standing on the piazza of the doomed"

7893,CHAPTER XLIV.,"brief, whispered conversation, left a small basket in his hand, and"
7894,CHAPTER XLIV.,"retired whence she had come. Then the man, after glancing cautiously"
7895,CHAPTER XLIV.,"around him, descended the steps and proceeded to light the fires. In"
7896,CHAPTER XLIV.,"three different places the devouring element was kindled, and, as he"
7897,CHAPTER XLIV.,"stooped to blow the light fragments with his breath, the flames suddenly"
7898,CHAPTER XLIV.,leaped forth and revealed in startling distinctness the face and
7899,CHAPTER XLIV.,features of the incendiary. His hat had fallen to the ground and left
7900,CHAPTER XLIV.,"his head exposed, which was covered with a profusion of light, auburn"
7901,CHAPTER XLIV.,"hair, clustering in short, thick curls around a high, pale forehead."""
7902,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7903,CHAPTER XLIV.,Major Howard sprang from his seat.
7904,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7905,CHAPTER XLIV.,"""Sir!"" said he, darting an enraged glance on the strange man, ""are you a"

7908,CHAPTER XLIV.,"been of a flaxen hue?"""
7909,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7910,CHAPTER XLIV.,The hermit seemed not in the least disconcerted by this speech. Raising
7911,CHAPTER XLIV.,"the long cane on which his arms had been resting, he lifted the black"
7912,CHAPTER XLIV.,cloud of curls from the head of Col. Malcome and dashed it upon the
7913,CHAPTER XLIV.,floor.

7971,CHAPTER XLIV.,

7976,CHAPTER XLIV.,
7977,CHAPTER XLIV.,"As the hermit was slowly following the receding group, Major Howard"

8156,CHAPTER XLV.,
8157,CHAPTER XLV.,"""Was his father an artist?"" asked Mrs. D."

8159,CHAPTER XLV.,"""Yes,"" answered the recluse. ""I well remember where sister Fanny first"
8160,CHAPTER XLV.,"met him, and how quick a wild, deep love grew out of the romantic"

8162,CHAPTER XLV.,"in travel my cankering sorrows, she to companion my wanderings. How it"
8163,CHAPTER XLV.,affects me now to think that we left you in suffering poverty without

8165,CHAPTER XLV.,"furnished us with funds for travel, while yours had been squandered by a"
8166,CHAPTER XLV.,dissolute man. But we should have given you of ours to alleviate your
8167,CHAPTER XLV.,wants and distresses. Fanny often told me so; but my worst passions were
8168,CHAPTER XLV.,"roused by the misfortune I conceived you had helped to bring upon me,"
8169,CHAPTER XLV.,and I would not hear her pleadings in your behalf. What a hard-hearted
8170,CHAPTER XLV.,"wretch I have been!"""
8171,CHAPTER XLV.,
8172,CHAPTER XLV.,The hermit paused and covered his face.

8177,CHAPTER XLV.,
8178,CHAPTER XLV.,"""Ay, yes,"" said the hermit, rousing himself; ""I was speaking of her"
8179,CHAPTER XLV.,first meeting with her future husband. It was among the ruins of the
8180,CHAPTER XLV.,"Eternal City. She had wandered forth by herself one day, and,"
8181,CHAPTER XLV.,"intoxicated by the scenes that met her eye on every hand, roamed so far"
8182,CHAPTER XLV.,"that when the shades of night began to fall, she discovered herself in"
8183,CHAPTER XLV.,"the midst of gloomy, crumbling walls and tottering columns, without"
8184,CHAPTER XLV.,"knowing whither to direct her steps. While she stood indeterminate, a"
8185,CHAPTER XLV.,"gentleman approached, and kindly inquired if she had lost her way. She"
8186,CHAPTER XLV.,"answered in the affirmative, and he offered to escort her home. I"
8187,CHAPTER XLV.,"remember how glowing bright was her face that night, as she came"
8188,CHAPTER XLV.,"bounding up the steps of our habitation, and presented the 'young artist"
8189,CHAPTER XLV.,"she had found beneath the walls of Rome,' as she termed her companion,"
8190,CHAPTER XLV.,and laughingly recounted her adventure. I believe our family are
8191,CHAPTER XLV.,"predisposed to strong feelings, for I never witnessed a love more"
8192,CHAPTER XLV.,engrossing than was hers for the young Lindenwood; nor was his devotion
8193,CHAPTER XLV.,"to her less remarkable. They were married, and I left them to pursue my"

8195,CHAPTER XLV.,
8196,CHAPTER XLV.,"""When, after a lapse of several years, I returned, it was to stand over"

8302,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8303,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""Very well, I did tell Susey she might have the articles mentioned to"

8308,CHAPTER XLVI.,"With an awful air, Mrs. Pimble folded her arms and looked down upon her"

8311,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8312,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""Dropped the waiter!"" repeated Mrs. Pimble, her anger freshening to a"

8316,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8317,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""She took the waiter from me,"" said Pimble, in a dogged tone, his eyes"

8319,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8320,CHAPTER XLVI.,"Mrs. Pimble darted upon him one glance of the most withering contempt,"
8321,CHAPTER XLVI.,"and taking Susey by the hand led her from the room, without deigning to"

8323,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8324,CHAPTER XLVI.,"Soon as she disappeared Peggy set about clearing up the broken crockery,"
8325,CHAPTER XLVI.,and Mr. Pimble crawled off into the recess of a window where the sun
8326,CHAPTER XLVI.,"might shine on his shivering frame, and at length fell asleep. He had"
8327,CHAPTER XLVI.,"hardly concluded his first dream of fragmentary tea-cups, ere a violent"
8328,CHAPTER XLVI.,"pulling at his draggling coat-tails, which hung over the sill, caused"
8329,CHAPTER XLVI.,"him to wake with a start, when he beheld Peggy Nonce at his side,"
8330,CHAPTER XLVI.,"saying, ""Dilly Danforth was come to see him."" With a hopeless yawn he"
8331,CHAPTER XLVI.,"crawled out of his sunny nook, and, turning his dull, sleepy eyes toward"
8332,CHAPTER XLVI.,"the disturber of his quiet, demanded, in a surly tone, ""what she wanted"
8333,CHAPTER XLVI.,"with him."""
8334,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8335,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""I have come to pay my quarter's rent,"" said Mrs. Danforth, placing a"

8337,CHAPTER XLVI.,"eager clutch, and looked in the woman's face with a vague expression of"
8338,CHAPTER XLVI.,wonder.
8339,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8340,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""I am glad to get a shilling from you at last,"" said he, fondling the"
8341,CHAPTER XLVI.,"note; ""but this will not quite pay up the last quarter's rent. There's"
8342,CHAPTER XLVI.,about half a dollar more my due. You can come and do the spring
8343,CHAPTER XLVI.,"cleaning, and then I'll call matters square between us."""
8344,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8345,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""I thought ten dollars was the sum specified, for three months' rent,"""
8346,CHAPTER XLVI.,remarked Mrs. Danforth.
8347,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8348,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""It was,"" returned he, ""but you know you had the pig's feet and ears at"
8349,CHAPTER XLVI.,"the fall butchering, and Mrs. Pimble gave you a petticoat in the winter."
8350,CHAPTER XLVI.,"These things would amount to more than fifty cents, if I put their real"
8351,CHAPTER XLVI.,"value upon them; but as you have cashed this payment, I will, as I said"
8352,CHAPTER XLVI.,"before, call all square with a few days' light work from you."""
8353,CHAPTER XLVI.,
8354,CHAPTER XLVI.,"Mrs. Danforth drew another note from her pocket, and, placing it in his"
8355,CHAPTER XLVI.,"hand, asked him to satisfy himself of his claims upon her, as she could"
8356,CHAPTER XLVI.,"not favor him with her services as he desired, having work of her own to"
8357,CHAPTER XLVI.,do. Mr. Pimble looked still more astonished when he felt the second note
8358,CHAPTER XLVI.,between his fingers. He put it in his pocket and returned her a silver
8359,CHAPTER XLVI.,"piece. She took it, and, turning to depart, said, ""I shall not want your"

8362,CHAPTER XLVI.,"""Where are you going?"" he asked, opening his sleepy eyes very wide."

8404,CHAPTER XLVII.,
8405,CHAPTER XLVII.,"""It is enough for me to know my father's wrongs are righted and I am"

8414,CHAPTER XLVII.,"retributions, that the man who was once the betrothed of my aunt, should"
8415,CHAPTER XLVII.,be the instrument selected by Heaven to disclose the villany and
8416,CHAPTER XLVII.,wickedness of the wretch who seduced her affections by artful
8417,CHAPTER XLVII.,"falsehoods, and made her his wife, but to steal her fortune and blast"
8418,CHAPTER XLVII.,"her life? Poor, dear aunt Mary! I mourn not nor pine to find she is not"
8419,CHAPTER XLVII.,"my mother, for surely the fragile Edith, so rudely shocked by the"

8427,CHAPTER XLVII.,"mentioned, and I think that early devotion has survived all"

8430,CHAPTER XLVII.,"youth! But it may not be, for the conviction steals coldly o'er me that"

8432,CHAPTER XLVII.,the joy of discovering a daughter may not save her from the tomb which

8648,CHAPTER XLIX.,"had witnessed beneath its roof. Still, the Howards were for the most"
8649,CHAPTER XLIX.,part very happy. Edith's bright head was again covered with its golden
8650,CHAPTER XLIX.,"wealth of curls, and her merry laughter echoed joyously through the"
8651,CHAPTER XLIX.,halls and parlors of the proud mansion. It seemed her greatest delight
8652,CHAPTER XLIX.,"to bring a smile to the wan cheek of her mother, who was failing slowly,"
8653,CHAPTER XLIX.,even beneath the genial influence of a summer sun.
8654,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8655,CHAPTER XLIX.,As Florence stood on the vine-curtained terrace one balmy August
8656,CHAPTER XLIX.,"morning, inhaling the sweet air, and listening to the thrilling"

8658,CHAPTER XLIX.,"cages from the roof above, she beheld Willie Danforth coming up the"
8659,CHAPTER XLIX.,"garden path, holding a letter toward her in his cunning, tempting way."
8660,CHAPTER XLIX.,She extended her hand to receive it.
8661,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8662,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""No,"" said he, suddenly drawing it back. ""I don't think I'll let you"
8663,CHAPTER XLIX.,"have this tiny little missive, unless you will first promise to tell me"
8664,CHAPTER XLIX.,"who is the writer."""
8665,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8666,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Why, how can I tell you till I know myself?"" said she, still reaching"
8667,CHAPTER XLIX.,"for the letter, which he continued to withhold, smiling at her eager,"
8668,CHAPTER XLIX.,impatient aspect.
8669,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8670,CHAPTER XLIX.,His frolicsome habit of teasing gently any one he loved always reminded
8671,CHAPTER XLIX.,"her of Edgar Lindenwood, and he was very like his cousin in personal"
8672,CHAPTER XLIX.,"appearance. So thought Florence; and he and his mother, who lived in a"
8673,CHAPTER XLIX.,"room of Dea. Allen's cottage, just across the garden, became marked"
8674,CHAPTER XLIX.,favorites of hers.
8675,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8676,CHAPTER XLIX.,"At length Willie gave her the letter. She broke the seal quickly, and"
8677,CHAPTER XLIX.,hurried through the contents.
8678,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8679,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""I'll tell you who 'tis from, gladly,"" said she, with a bright smile;"
8680,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""for I fancy it will afford you pleasure to know. Do you remember a"
8681,CHAPTER XLIX.,"little girl, named Ellen Williams, who used to trip over the piazza we"

8683,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8684,CHAPTER XLIX.,"The young man's face brightened and blushed as he replied eagerly,"

8686,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""That do I, and her brother Neddie."""
8687,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8688,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Well, they are both coming here to make me a nice, long visit,"" said"
8689,CHAPTER XLIX.,"she, in a delighted tone. ""Is not this happy news?"""
8690,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8691,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""It is, indeed,"" answered Willie; ""but where did you make their"
8692,CHAPTER XLIX.,"acquaintance, Florence?"""
8693,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8694,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""During the period of my travels they were my constant companions. I"
8695,CHAPTER XLIX.,"recollect how eagerly Ellen inquired for you, when we first met at"
8696,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Niagara; but I was then almost ignorant of your existence, and could"
8697,CHAPTER XLIX.,give her no satisfactory information. I told her there was a youth I had
8698,CHAPTER XLIX.,"heard called Willie Greyson, who lived with a hermit; and she said"
8699,CHAPTER XLIX.,Greyson was your mother's maiden name; but so dutiful and affectionate a
8700,CHAPTER XLIX.,"son as you would never leave a lonely, widowed parent to dwell with a"
8701,CHAPTER XLIX.,"solitary hermit. So she would believe you were dead."""
8702,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8703,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""And did that belief appear to cause her any regret?"" asked William, who"
8704,CHAPTER XLIX.,had been listening with an earnest expression to Florence's words.
8705,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8706,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Yes, indeed,"" returned she; ""the pretty, gentle girl has a strong"
8707,CHAPTER XLIX.,"regard for you, Willie. You must renew acquaintance when she and her"
8708,CHAPTER XLIX.,"brother come to pay me their long-meditated visit."""
8709,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8710,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""I don't know,"" said the young man, rather sadly."
8711,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8712,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""I believe you will be a second Hermit of the Cedars, or the Hemlocks,"
8713,CHAPTER XLIX.,"or the Pines,"" said she, laughing; ""for you are already half as"
8714,CHAPTER XLIX.,"melancholy as your uncle, at times."""
8715,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8716,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Do you consider him so very gloomy, then?"" asked Willie."
8717,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8718,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""He has the most mournful expression I ever saw,"" answered Florence;"
8719,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""but he is an entertaining companion for all that. I always sit apart,"
8720,CHAPTER XLIX.,"and listen in silence, when he relates some tale or adventure of his"
8721,CHAPTER XLIX.,"extensive travels. He was with us yesterday evening, and I never saw him"
8722,CHAPTER XLIX.,"so animated and lively before. Even Aunt Mary's pale, grief-worn"
8723,CHAPTER XLIX.,countenance assumed a cheerful expression while listening to his
8724,CHAPTER XLIX.,"sprightly, intelligent conversation."""
8725,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8726,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Did you not know the cause of his unusual exhilaration?"" inquired"
8727,CHAPTER XLIX.,William.
8728,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8729,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""No,"" said Florence, looking innocently in the face of the questioner."
8730,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8731,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Edgar is at home."""
8732,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8733,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Why did he not inform us of his nephew's return?"" asked Florence,"
8734,CHAPTER XLIX.,"growing suddenly very pale, and finding it convenient to lean against a"
8735,CHAPTER XLIX.,pillar near by.
8736,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8737,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Perhaps he did not think the intelligence would interest your family,"""
8738,CHAPTER XLIX.,"returned Willie; ""he is very modest in his confidences."""
8739,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8740,CHAPTER XLIX.,"The seminary bell now commenced to ring, and the youth hastened away"
8741,CHAPTER XLIX.,with a pleasant good-morning.
8742,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8743,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Florence stood there a long time, behind the thickly-interwoven"
8744,CHAPTER XLIX.,"woodbines and honeysuckles, supporting herself against the marble"
8745,CHAPTER XLIX.,"column, forgetful of all save the blissful thought that the man she"
8746,CHAPTER XLIX.,"loved was once more near her. He was, indeed, nearer than she supposed,"
8747,CHAPTER XLIX.,"for there came a light footstep on the vine-shrouded terrace, and she"
8748,CHAPTER XLIX.,"felt an arm stealing softly around her, while a voice, whose briefest"
8749,CHAPTER XLIX.,"tone she could never mistake, whispered in her ear:"
8750,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8751,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Again we have met, and O, Florence! say, in mercy say, it shall be to"
8752,CHAPTER XLIX.,"part no more!"""
8753,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8754,CHAPTER XLIX.,"There is nothing so natural, to a woman that loves, as the presence of"
8755,CHAPTER XLIX.,the beloved object; and Florence turned toward Edgar with no amazement
8756,CHAPTER XLIX.,or surprise; but love unspeakable lighted her features as she placed her
8757,CHAPTER XLIX.,"hand in his, tenderly, trustfully, and with a manner that convinced him"
8758,CHAPTER XLIX.,she would never withdraw it again.
8759,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8760,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Then she led him into the drawing-room, where the family soon assembled,"
8761,CHAPTER XLIX.,and were presented to the young artist.
8762,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8763,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Aunt Mary was delighted with his appearance, and soon engaged him in a"
8764,CHAPTER XLIX.,"conversation which grew very brilliant and animated on his part, and was"
8765,CHAPTER XLIX.,"joined in by Florence and Edith, till Major Howard entered, whose joy at"
8766,CHAPTER XLIX.,"again beholding his former travelling companion knew no bounds, and the"
8767,CHAPTER XLIX.,mirth and merriment increased four-fold. Evening had fallen ere they
8768,CHAPTER XLIX.,"were aware, when Edgar rose and said he must return to the hermit's"
8769,CHAPTER XLIX.,habitation.
8770,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8771,CHAPTER XLIX.,"All regretted to lose his presence, and Major Howard strongly invited"
8772,CHAPTER XLIX.,him to regard his mansion as a home while he should remain in the
8773,CHAPTER XLIX.,vicinity.
8774,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8775,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Edgar thanked him for his generous offer, and gracefully bowed a"
8776,CHAPTER XLIX.,good-evening.
8777,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8778,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Florence accompanied him to the hall door, and he drew her forth on the"
8779,CHAPTER XLIX.,"terrace, which was now glinted over by the silvery moonbeams."
8780,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8781,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Come soon again,"" said she."
8782,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8783,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Yes, dearest,"" he answered. A long, sweet kiss and gentle adieu, in"
8784,CHAPTER XLIX.,"which there was love enough to feast even her long-famishing soul, and"
8785,CHAPTER XLIX.,he was gone.
8786,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8787,CHAPTER XLIX.,"She skipped lightly into the parlor, kissed her father, Aunt Mary,"
8788,CHAPTER XLIX.,"Edith, Sylva, and Fido, the little Spanish poodle that was nestled in"
8789,CHAPTER XLIX.,"her arms, and then bounded up the stairs to her own apartment, singing"
8790,CHAPTER XLIX.,as she went.
8791,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8792,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""There goes the happiest heart in Wimbledon, to-night,"" said her father,"
8793,CHAPTER XLIX.,as he caught the sound of her musical voice ringing through the spacious
8794,CHAPTER XLIX.,hall above.
8795,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8796,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Save one,"" said Aunt Mary, with a sad smile."
8797,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8798,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""He is beyond its precincts,"" returned Major Howard. ""Edith, did you"
8799,CHAPTER XLIX.,"ever love?"" said he, quickly turning his discourse toward the gentle"
8800,CHAPTER XLIX.,"girl, who stood, regarding attentively the faces of the speakers, as if"
8801,CHAPTER XLIX.,she hardly comprehended their words.
8802,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8803,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""No,"" answered she, innocently."
8804,CHAPTER XLIX.,
8805,CHAPTER XLIX.,"""Heaven grant you never may,"" said her mother, fervently; ""come, my"

9194,CHAPTER II.,
9195,CHAPTER II.,"Thus saying, the old woman slipped on her clothes, and, crossing a rude"

9199,CHAPTER II.,"placed in a bowl of clear water, some writing materials, and a few books"

9204,CHAPTER II.,"softly in her quiet sleep, lay a lovely child, on whose fair, open brow"

9209,CHAPTER II.,"""Bless it, how it sleeps this morning!"" she said, in a low whisper; ""but"

9221,CHAPTER II.,"pink muslin frock, issued from her room, carolling a happy morning song."
9222,CHAPTER II.,"She sat down on a bench before the door of the cottage, and in a few"

9334,CHAPTER III.,Through three bright summers had George Wild led Annie Evalyn over the

9337,CHAPTER III.,they roamed through the dim old woods in search of moss and wild
9338,CHAPTER III.,"flowers, and, in the autumn time, to gather the brown nuts of the"
9339,CHAPTER III.,"chestnut and beech trees; how many favorite nooks and dells they had, in"
9340,CHAPTER III.,"which to rest from their ramblings, and talk and tell each other of"
9341,CHAPTER III.,their thoughts and dreamings of the life to come! But George would often
9342,CHAPTER III.,say he could not understand all Annie's wild words; he thought her
9343,CHAPTER III.,"whimsical and visionary, and it pained him to find her ambitious and"
9344,CHAPTER III.,"aspiring as her years increased; he would fain have her always a child,"
9345,CHAPTER III.,"rapt in the enjoyment of the present hour, content and satisfied with"
9346,CHAPTER III.,"his companionship and aunt Patty's purple berries and oaten cakes,"
9347,CHAPTER III.,believing the heaven that closed round Scraggiewood bounded the
9348,CHAPTER III.,"universe; for something whispered to his heart, if she went forth into"

9350,CHAPTER III.,"his indolent nature was capable of loving, and indeed would do a great"

9352,CHAPTER III.,"any other person, and she loved him, too, very well,--but very coolly,"
9353,CHAPTER III.,"very calmly, with a love that sought the good of its object at the"
9354,CHAPTER III.,"expense of self entirely, for she could bear to think of parting with"
9355,CHAPTER III.,"him forever, and putting the world's width between them, so he was"
9356,CHAPTER III.,benefited and his usefulness increased by the proceeding. And he had
9357,CHAPTER III.,always been her companion and protector. Next to her aunty she ought to
9358,CHAPTER III.,love him; but his mind was not of a cast with hers; he could not
9359,CHAPTER III.,appreciate her dreamy thoughts and aspirations. He was content to fold
9360,CHAPTER III.,"his arms, and be floated through life by the tide of circumstances, the"
9361,CHAPTER III.,thing he was; but she could not be so; she must trim her sails and stem
9362,CHAPTER III.,the current; within her breast was a spirit that would not be lulled to
9363,CHAPTER III.,"slumber, but impelled her incessantly to action; there was a quenchless"
9364,CHAPTER III.,"thirst for knowledge, unappeased, and it must be slaked."
9365,CHAPTER III.,
9366,CHAPTER III.,"Mr. Grey, the kind village pastor, who had become deeply interested in"

9393,CHAPTER III.,"""But you will sit here alone henceforth, if you choose to continue this"

9411,CHAPTER III.,"you you'll do that."""
9412,CHAPTER III.,
9413,CHAPTER III.,"""Why, George,"" said she, noticing his rueful countenance, ""what makes"
9414,CHAPTER III.,you look so woe-begone? As if I were about to fly to the ends of the
9415,CHAPTER III.,"earth, when I'm only going two little miles to Parson Grey's Rectory,"

9420,CHAPTER III.,
9421,CHAPTER III.,"""No; but there may be brighter ones ahead,"" she answered, hopefully."
9422,CHAPTER III.,
9423,CHAPTER III.,George shook his head. None of her lofty aspirations found response in
9424,CHAPTER III.,his bosom; the present moment occupied his thoughts. So the common wants
9425,CHAPTER III.,"of life were supplied, and he free from pain and anxiety, he was"
9426,CHAPTER III.,"content, nor wished or thought of aught beyond. The great world of the"
9427,CHAPTER III.,"future he never longed to scan, nor penetrate its misty-veiled depths,"
9428,CHAPTER III.,"and leave a name for lofty deeds and noble actions, that should vibrate"
9429,CHAPTER III.,on the ear of time when he was no more.
9430,CHAPTER III.,
9431,CHAPTER III.,And thus drifted asunder on the great ocean of life the barks that had
9432,CHAPTER III.,floated on calmly side by side through a few years of quiet pleasure.
9433,CHAPTER III.,They might never spread their sails together again; wider and wider
9434,CHAPTER III.,would the distance grow between them; higher and higher would swell the
9435,CHAPTER III.,waves as they sped on their separate courses; the one light and buoyant
9436,CHAPTER III.,"with her freight of noble hopes and dauntless steersman at the helm, the"
9437,CHAPTER III.,"other without sail or ballast, drifted about at the mercy of winds and"
9438,CHAPTER III.,waves.

9457,CHAPTER IV.,"glided over Annie Evalyn, as she, with unremitting assiduity, pursued"
9458,CHAPTER IV.,the path of science under the guidance of the good parson. Each day

9489,CHAPTER IV.,"""And could you accomplish but one, which should it be?"""

9507,CHAPTER IV.,

9521,CHAPTER IV.,
9522,CHAPTER IV.,"Annie bowed, and glided down the gravelled path of the garden. In a"

9534,CHAPTER IV.,"it over her friend's high, marble-like brow, bestowing a playful kiss on"

9536,CHAPTER IV.,
9537,CHAPTER IV.,"""Does it sit lightly, Annie?"" she asked."
9538,CHAPTER IV.,
9539,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, Netta, and now bend in turn to receive my wreath of innocence, not"

9542,CHAPTER IV.,"Netta knelt, and the garland was thrown over her flaxen curls. Thus"
9543,CHAPTER IV.,"adorned, the lovely maidens strolled up the avenue, arm in arm, and made"
9544,CHAPTER IV.,"their way to the study-room, as it was called; a large, airy chamber"
9545,CHAPTER IV.,"fronting the east, situated in a retired portion of the house, to be"

9629,CHAPTER V.,
9630,CHAPTER V.,Alone Annie Evalyn was walking in the summer twilight over the rough
9631,CHAPTER V.,road toward Scraggiewood.
9632,CHAPTER V.,
9633,CHAPTER V.,Near two months had elapsed since she last visited her Aunt Patty at the
9634,CHAPTER V.,"rock-built cottage, and she pictured in her mind, as she walked on, the"
9635,CHAPTER V.,surprise and good-natured chiding which would mark her old aunt's
9636,CHAPTER V.,reception. She gazed upward at the tall forest trees swaying to and fro
9637,CHAPTER V.,"in the light evening breeze, and far into its dim, mazy depths, where"
9638,CHAPTER V.,"gray rocks lay clad in soft, green moss, and gnarled, uprooted trunks"
9639,CHAPTER V.,"overgrown with clinging vines, and pale, delicate flowers springing"
9640,CHAPTER V.,beautiful from their decay. She listened to the murmuring of the brook
9641,CHAPTER V.,"in its rocky bed, and a thousand memories of other years rushed on her"
9642,CHAPTER V.,"soul. The strange, fast-coming fancies that thronged her brain when she"
9643,CHAPTER V.,"in early childhood roamed those dark, solemn woods, or sat at night on"
9644,CHAPTER V.,"the lowly cottage stile, gazing on the wild, grotesque shadows cast by"
9645,CHAPTER V.,"the moonbeams from the huge, forest trees; or how she listened to the"
9646,CHAPTER V.,"solemn hootings of the lonesome owl, the monotonous cuckoo, and sudden"
9647,CHAPTER V.,"whippoorwill; or laughed at the glowworm's light in the dark swamps, and"
9648,CHAPTER V.,asked her aunty if they were not a group of stars come down to play
9649,CHAPTER V.,bo-peep in the meadows.
9650,CHAPTER V.,
9651,CHAPTER V.,"And then she thought of George Wild, her early playfellow. He was away"
9652,CHAPTER V.,"now, in a distant part of the country, whither he had been sent by his"
9653,CHAPTER V.,father to learn the carpenter's trade. He had come to bid her good-by
9654,CHAPTER V.,"with tears in his eyes, not so much at parting from _her_, she fancied,"
9655,CHAPTER V.,as from dread of the active life before him. It would be hard to tell
9656,CHAPTER V.,whether Annie felt most pity or contempt for his weakness. He was the
9657,CHAPTER V.,"only friend of her early childhood, and, _as_ such, she had still a"
9658,CHAPTER V.,"warm, tender feeling at her heart for him; and, had he possessed a"
9659,CHAPTER V.,"becoming energy and manliness of character, this childish feeling might"
9660,CHAPTER V.,"have deepened into strong, enduring affection as years advanced. But"
9661,CHAPTER V.,Annie Evalyn could never love George Wild as he _was_; and thus she
9662,CHAPTER V.,thought as she brushed away a tear that had unconsciously started during
9663,CHAPTER V.,"her meditations, and found herself at the door of her aunt's cottage."
9664,CHAPTER V.,"She bounded over the threshold and into the old lady's arms, bestowing a"
9665,CHAPTER V.,shower of kisses ere poor Aunt Patty could sufficiently collect herself
9666,CHAPTER V.,and recover from the surprise to return her darling's lavish caresses.
9667,CHAPTER V.,
9668,CHAPTER V.,"""Ah, yes, you naughty little witch! here you are at last, pretending to"

9675,CHAPTER V.,"""Indeed, I meant to have come long before; but if you only knew how much"

9725,CHAPTER V.,"delightful on your light batter cakes, with a slice of old Crummie's"

9728,CHAPTER V.,

9790,CHAPTER VI.,
9791,CHAPTER VI.,"To this winning speech, however, the insensate Dr. vouchsafed no reply;"
9792,CHAPTER VI.,"so his lovely wife tacked about and said, ""Well, Dr., to come to the"

9794,CHAPTER VI.,
9795,CHAPTER VI.,"""I know it,"" responded the good man, cutting up an orange, and passing a"

9805,CHAPTER VI.,
9806,CHAPTER VI.,"There was a silence of some minutes, and then the lady, after fidgeting"
9807,CHAPTER VI.,"and arranging the folds of her brocade silk, resumed the conversation by"

9810,CHAPTER VI.,
9811,CHAPTER VI.,"""Begging your pardon, madam,"" said the doctor, looking up from his"

9813,CHAPTER VI.,
9814,CHAPTER VI.,The lady frowned frightfully at this fresh instance of his inattention

9816,CHAPTER VI.,
9817,CHAPTER VI.,"""I only wished to know if you thought of marrying Frank Sheldon to Annie"
9818,CHAPTER VI.,"Evalyn, in preference to your own daughter,"" she exclaimed, in a biting,"
9819,CHAPTER VI.,sarcastic tone. The _matter_ but not the _manner_ of this speech seemed
9820,CHAPTER VI.,to rouse the doctor's attention.
9821,CHAPTER VI.,
9822,CHAPTER VI.,"""Frank Sheldon! Frank Sheldon!"" he said quickly; ""has he arrived from"

9824,CHAPTER VI.,

9829,CHAPTER VI.,

9832,CHAPTER VI.,"an equality in the family, and admitted through our influence to the"
9833,CHAPTER VI.,first classes in society. And I'm not the only one that marks the
9834,CHAPTER VI.,"shocking impropriety. My son-in-law, Lawrence Hardin, is possessed of a"

9836,CHAPTER VI.,
9837,CHAPTER VI.,"This speech was accompanied by immoderate vehemence, and energetic"

9839,CHAPTER VI.,"phlegmatic doctor, who, having finished his orange, settled himself"
9840,CHAPTER VI.,"comfortably in his easy-chair, and took a cigar and the morning paper to"
9841,CHAPTER VI.,assist his digestion.
9842,CHAPTER VI.,
9843,CHAPTER VI.,"""Thirteen increase from last week. I declare, our city is growing"

9849,CHAPTER VI.,
9850,CHAPTER VI.,"""_Her_ writings! the bold, impertinent hussy! No, nor do I wish to. But"

9853,CHAPTER VI.,"day. Nothing low ever tarnishes his discourse."""
9854,CHAPTER VI.,
9855,CHAPTER VI.,"""Do so, madam,"" said the imperturbable husband; ""undoubtedly they will"

9857,CHAPTER VI.,
9858,CHAPTER VI.,"And with a disdainful toss the lady flouted out of the room, leaving the"

9861,CHAPTER VI.,"Annie Evalyn had been nine months an inmate of Dr. Prague's mansion,"
9862,CHAPTER VI.,when the preceding scene was enacted. Some of that experience which Aunt
9863,CHAPTER VI.,"Patty had pronounced ""better than book learnin',"" had fallen to her"
9864,CHAPTER VI.,share. So far from her beauty and accomplishments winning friends and
9865,CHAPTER VI.,"good-will, they had only seemed to provoke the sneers and invidious"
9866,CHAPTER VI.,remarks of those who envied her superior attractions. She had seen the
9867,CHAPTER VI.,"contemptuous curl of the lip, and heard the epithet, ""low-born"
9868,CHAPTER VI.,"creature."" She had bitterly learned that genius and beauty are not the"
9869,CHAPTER VI.,"current coins of society; and she sometimes thought the old adage,"
9870,CHAPTER VI.,"""Knowledge is power,"" would read truer, ""Money is power."" But though she"
9871,CHAPTER VI.,"had dark hours, her young heart's courage had not failed. Still the"
9872,CHAPTER VI.,"unalterable purpose was firm, to be active, to be striving for fame,"
9873,CHAPTER VI.,honor and good repute. Latterly she had turned her attention to literary
9874,CHAPTER VI.,"subjects, and produced several pieces that received warm commendation"
9875,CHAPTER VI.,from the press.
9876,CHAPTER VI.,
9877,CHAPTER VI.,"Annie had been but a few weeks in her new residence, ere her quick eye"
9878,CHAPTER VI.,"discerned that Mrs. Prague looked upon her with envy and jealousy, and"
9879,CHAPTER VI.,she endeavored to conciliate the lady's esteem by gentleness and
9880,CHAPTER VI.,condescension; but all efforts were vain. She persisted in her coldness
9881,CHAPTER VI.,and perversity. This was so unpleasant to Annie that she several times
9882,CHAPTER VI.,signified her readiness to leave when her presence was no longer
9883,CHAPTER VI.,"desired; but the old doctor, who was her most zealous advocate, declared"
9884,CHAPTER VI.,he should go distracted if she left them. Kate cried and the children
9885,CHAPTER VI.,howled in terror at the prospect of such a calamity. Mrs. Prague looked
9886,CHAPTER VI.,"lofty and said, ""Miss Evalyn was a trusty governess, and they might"
9887,CHAPTER VI.,"increase her salary if she thought it insufficient."""
9888,CHAPTER VI.,
9889,CHAPTER VI.,"""Double it, if she says so,"" said the doctor; ""but money can't reward"

9892,CHAPTER VI.,

9906,CHAPTER VII.,"Reclining on a silken sofa, in a luxurious apartment, was a lady in the"
9907,CHAPTER VII.,"prime of youth and beauty. She was robed in a white, wrought-muslin"
9908,CHAPTER VII.,"gown, and her glossy ringlets lay in dark relief on its snowy folds. She"
9909,CHAPTER VII.,"was reading at intervals from a small gilt volume, but with a wandering"
9910,CHAPTER VII.,"listlessness of manner, as though it were a weary effort to fix her"
9911,CHAPTER VII.,attention upon its contents.
9912,CHAPTER VII.,
9913,CHAPTER VII.,"This was the wife of Lawrence Hardin, Esq., one of the most wealthy,"
9914,CHAPTER VII.,influential men in that part of the country. He arrived there from the
9915,CHAPTER VII.,"east a few years before, bringing a large fortune, which he came in"
9916,CHAPTER VII.,possession of by the sudden death of his parents. He embarked largely in
9917,CHAPTER VII.,"speculations, and was very successful; in consequence of which, the"
9918,CHAPTER VII.,mercantile class in their most critical junctures looked up to him as a
9919,CHAPTER VII.,superior and safeguard. He soon grew to be a man of great power and
9920,CHAPTER VII.,"influence, and in the full tide of prosperity bore away the beautiful"
9921,CHAPTER VII.,"Marion Prague, the reigning belle of the city, as his bride. There was a"
9922,CHAPTER VII.,rumor afloat that the match afforded the fair lady but meagre
9923,CHAPTER VII.,"satisfaction, and that her taste and wishes were not much consulted in"
9924,CHAPTER VII.,"the matter; but the angry importunities of her proud, self-willed mother"
9925,CHAPTER VII.,at length induced her to marry a man she did not love. But this idle
9926,CHAPTER VII.,"report was hushed after their marriage, and the devotion of the young"
9927,CHAPTER VII.,couple loudly descanted on in fashionable circles throughout the city;
9928,CHAPTER VII.,"for was not Hardin all attention, and how could she avoid loving so fine"
9929,CHAPTER VII.,"a fellow? So the world called it a nice match, and passed on. Let us"
9930,CHAPTER VII.,pause for a glance behind the scenes.

9933,CHAPTER VII.,"softly on its gilded hinges, and a gentleman, richly dressed, with"
9934,CHAPTER VII.,"shining hat, dark broadcloth over-coat, and a light bamboo stick in his"
9935,CHAPTER VII.,"neatly-gloved hand, entered and approached the couch on which the lady"
9936,CHAPTER VII.,"reclined. He was rather above the medium height, of commanding figure,"
9937,CHAPTER VII.,"with jetty hair and mustaches and deep-set, piercing black eyes. Laying"
9938,CHAPTER VII.,"aside hat and gloves, he sat down by the sofa, and commenced playfully"
9939,CHAPTER VII.,"poking the long, wavy ringlets that lay on the crimson damask pillow"
9940,CHAPTER VII.,with the gold tip of his tiny walking-cane. She had resumed her book on
9941,CHAPTER VII.,"his first appearance, and continued to peruse its pages. She did not"
9942,CHAPTER VII.,"look toward him, or speak, and it was evident, from a slightly-clouded"
9943,CHAPTER VII.,"brow, that his presence rather annoyed than pleased her."
9944,CHAPTER VII.,
9945,CHAPTER VII.,This was Lawrence Hardin and lady in the privacy of their own apartment.
9946,CHAPTER VII.,
9947,CHAPTER VII.,"""Why don't you speak to me, Marion?"" he asked, at length."
9948,CHAPTER VII.,
9949,CHAPTER VII.,"No answer, and the brow grew darker. He bent over her, and endeavored to"
9950,CHAPTER VII.,take the book from her hand. She tightened her grasp for a moment to
9951,CHAPTER VII.,"resist his efforts, and then, suddenly relaxing her hold, turned toward"
9952,CHAPTER VII.,the wall.
9953,CHAPTER VII.,
9954,CHAPTER VII.,He gazed on her several moments with a mingled expression of anger and
9955,CHAPTER VII.,"wounded tenderness, and then turned away."
9956,CHAPTER VII.,
9957,CHAPTER VII.,"Half an hour later the young wife met her husband in the breakfast-room,"
9958,CHAPTER VII.,and presided with benign and gracious dignity over his well-laid table;
9959,CHAPTER VII.,"inquired ""if Esq. Hardin found the chocolate and sardines to his"
9960,CHAPTER VII.,"relish;"" and he extolled Mrs. Hardin's excellent superintendence of"
9961,CHAPTER VII.,domestic affairs; said business in his office would detain him from her
9962,CHAPTER VII.,"till the dinner hour, and, expressing a hope that she might pass the"
9963,CHAPTER VII.,"morning agreeably, bowed himself out of the presence of his lovely wife,"
9964,CHAPTER VII.,"who replied to his civilities courteously, and even smiled brightly at"
9965,CHAPTER VII.,his parting nod at the hall door. And the servants in attendance saw and
9966,CHAPTER VII.,"listened; and reported, and enlarged on the ""wonderful love"" and"
9967,CHAPTER VII.,happiness of their young master and mistress. So this _nice match_ was
9968,CHAPTER VII.,"noised abroad over the whole city, and a hundred families envied the"
9969,CHAPTER VII.,"domestic felicity of Esq. Hardin and wife. O, the endless masquerade of"
9970,CHAPTER VII.,life!
9971,CHAPTER VII.,
9972,CHAPTER VII.,Several weeks later the unloved husband entered his young lady's
9973,CHAPTER VII.,"apartment. She stood before the dressing-table, arranging her hair for"
9974,CHAPTER VII.,"the evening. She cast a brief glance toward him, and then proceeded"
9975,CHAPTER VII.,"quietly with her toilet. The chilling indifference wounded him acutely,"
9976,CHAPTER VII.,"and he addressed her rather hastily: ""Marion, do you think I shall"
9977,CHAPTER VII.,"always have patience?"""
9978,CHAPTER VII.,
9979,CHAPTER VII.,"""I don't know, I'm sure,"" she answered, carelessly; ""but of what do you"

9981,CHAPTER VII.,"satisfy your fastidious tastes?"""
9982,CHAPTER VII.,
9983,CHAPTER VII.,"""Don't mock or trifle,"" he said, bitterly. ""I'm not a machine, or an"

9999,CHAPTER VII.,
10000,CHAPTER VII.,"Tears started in those beautiful eyes, and he advanced to embrace her,"
10001,CHAPTER VII.,"but she motioned him away. No, they were not there for him. She"
10002,CHAPTER VII.,"struggled a few moments, and then, uncovering her face, said calmly:"

10006,CHAPTER VII.,"He drew a damask fauteuil opposite the one on which she was reclining,"
10007,CHAPTER VII.,and sank among its downy cushions. The rays of the setting sun streamed
10008,CHAPTER VII.,into the richly-furnished apartment and fell upon the two occupants.
10009,CHAPTER VII.,
10010,CHAPTER VII.,"""What news in the city, to-day?"" inquired Marion, at length."
10011,CHAPTER VII.,
10012,CHAPTER VII.,"""Nothing particularly interesting, I believe,"" he answered. ""I was at"

10033,CHAPTER VIII.,"the old lady had desired transmitted to her ""dear hinny,"" as she still"
10034,CHAPTER VIII.,"called Annie. ""Tell her I don't tell fortunes now, for I know she will"
10035,CHAPTER VIII.,"like to hear that; because once I remember she said, 'I wouldn't tell"

10128,CHAPTER VIII.,"here is Mr. Sheldon. I declare, what a delightful surprise!"" The old"
10129,CHAPTER VIII.,"doctor now entered, and burst into a torrent of welcome on beholding"
10130,CHAPTER VIII.,Sheldon.

10132,CHAPTER VIII.,"""How did you get here, my boy,"" he asked, ""to steal upon us so slyly,"

10134,CHAPTER VIII.,"before next week?"""
10135,CHAPTER VIII.,
10136,CHAPTER VIII.,Sheldon explained briefly. When he mentioned that a young lady had
10137,CHAPTER VIII.,"escorted him to the parlor, and invited him to await the family's"
10138,CHAPTER VIII.,"return, a visible frown lowered over Mrs. Prague's before smiling"
10139,CHAPTER VIII.,"countenance, and she and Catherine soon excused themselves to prepare"
10140,CHAPTER VIII.,for dinner.

10147,CHAPTER IX.,"""But, ah! if thou hadst loved me--had I been"

10149,CHAPTER IX.,
10150,CHAPTER IX.,
10151,CHAPTER IX.,"On a dim, gray morning in early winter, Lawrence Hardin sat by the couch"
10152,CHAPTER IX.,"of his wife, her thin, wasted hand lying unconsciously in his, and her"
10153,CHAPTER IX.,"quick, heavy breathings moving the dark locks of his hair, as he bent"
10154,CHAPTER IX.,low over her sleeping form. Three months had passed since that fainting
10155,CHAPTER IX.,"scene, and the young wife had encountered a long, severe stroke of"
10156,CHAPTER IX.,"illness. The husband watched incessantly by her bed-side, for he would"
10157,CHAPTER IX.,"not suffer her wild, fevered ravings to be heard by other ears than his"
10158,CHAPTER IX.,own.
10159,CHAPTER IX.,
10160,CHAPTER IX.,It was all revealed to him. He knew he had married a woman whose heart
10161,CHAPTER IX.,"was another's, and that she had been compelled to the step by the"
10162,CHAPTER IX.,threats and vehemence of her mother.
10163,CHAPTER IX.,
10164,CHAPTER IX.,"O, how the strong man writhed in his agony! To know Marion did not love"
10165,CHAPTER IX.,"him, was enough to endure; but to know she loved another, ah! that was"
10166,CHAPTER IX.,"madness. His passions were roused to fury, yet not on _her_ should they"
10167,CHAPTER IX.,"wreak their vengeance. No; on the man that had stolen her love from him,"
10168,CHAPTER IX.,"or rather the man on whom she had bestowed her love, Frank Sheldon. On"
10169,CHAPTER IX.,his devoted head should the vengeance fall.
10170,CHAPTER IX.,
10171,CHAPTER IX.,"Thus he resolved, but kept his fell design buried in his own breast,"
10172,CHAPTER IX.,"and, by an engaging exterior, sought to lure his victim into his toils."
10173,CHAPTER IX.,
10174,CHAPTER IX.,"Sheldon was a brave, generous fellow. Left early an orphan, he had been"
10175,CHAPTER IX.,"reared in the family of Dr. Prague, who was instituted guardian of the"
10176,CHAPTER IX.,large fortune left by his parents. He was endowed by nature with fine
10177,CHAPTER IX.,"intellectual abilities, and an exquisite taste for the grand and"
10178,CHAPTER IX.,"beautiful in nature and art, and, during three years' travel in foreign"
10179,CHAPTER IX.,"parts, had so improved upon these natural advantages, as to stand"
10180,CHAPTER IX.,acknowledged one of the most elegant and accomplished young men of his
10181,CHAPTER IX.,country. But it often happens that such high-wrought natures are but
10182,CHAPTER IX.,poorly versed in the plodding concerns of this nether world. And thus it
10183,CHAPTER IX.,"was with him. Alive to every lofty feeling and generous impulse, he"
10184,CHAPTER IX.,fancied others like himself. Low cunning and artifice were unknown to
10185,CHAPTER IX.,"his bosom, and consequently he would fall the easier victim to Hardin's"
10186,CHAPTER IX.,scheme of revenge.
10187,CHAPTER IX.,
10188,CHAPTER IX.,And now there came another fact to this base man's knowledge. Sheldon
10189,CHAPTER IX.,"had not only robbed him of Marion's affections, but had won and slighted"
10190,CHAPTER IX.,"Kate Prague, to fall in love with Annie Evalyn. Worse still, the passion"
10191,CHAPTER IX.,was mutual. That _he_ saw and knew long before the parties themselves
10192,CHAPTER IX.,had acknowledged the growing love in the still depths of their own
10193,CHAPTER IX.,"beating hearts, much more given voice to the feeling in words."
10194,CHAPTER IX.,
10195,CHAPTER IX.,"Love is so blind, and shy, and unbelieving, the poets tell us. Had"
10196,CHAPTER IX.,"Sheldon's love met no response, then Hardin's revenge had been in part"
10197,CHAPTER IX.,"gratified; but now it was only whetted to a keener edge, for he saw, or"
10198,CHAPTER IX.,"fancied he saw, not only his rival's happiness, but the sister of the"
10199,CHAPTER IX.,woman he loved pining from an unrequited affection.
10200,CHAPTER IX.,
10201,CHAPTER IX.,"As he revolved these dark thoughts in his vile breast, the hand he held"
10202,CHAPTER IX.,"moved suddenly, and the sleeper murmured in her dreams. He bent his ear"
10203,CHAPTER IX.,"eagerly to catch the sound, but it was gone. He smoothed the damp, dark"
10204,CHAPTER IX.,"locks away from the pale brow, and gazed on her thin, attenuated"
10205,CHAPTER IX.,"features--yet more beautiful, they seemed to him, than in the ruddy glow"
10206,CHAPTER IX.,of health. O that she would open her eyes and gaze up tenderly into his!
10207,CHAPTER IX.,"And when she was able to sit in a soft-cushioned chair, robed in a snowy"
10208,CHAPTER IX.,"dressing-gown, and propped with pillows, receiving his attentions with"
10209,CHAPTER IX.,"such a pretty shyness and distrust; or a few weeks later, when, still"
10210,CHAPTER IX.,"more recovered, leaning so coyly on his arm to wander over her splendid"
10211,CHAPTER IX.,"mansion again, and looking so timidly in his face, as if, now her secret"
10212,CHAPTER IX.,"was known, she had no right to claim or expect tenderness from him;--all"
10213,CHAPTER IX.,"this reserve made her so much dearer, and he thought, if she would but"
10214,CHAPTER IX.,"give him one little look of love, he would even forget his meditated"
10215,CHAPTER IX.,revenge on Sheldon.
10216,CHAPTER IX.,
10217,CHAPTER IX.,"But, ah! he looked in vain for lurking love in those cold, beautiful"
10218,CHAPTER IX.,"eyes. There was submission,--there was gratitude; but what were those?"
10219,CHAPTER IX.,
10220,CHAPTER IX.,"Again the fashionable world said, ""Esq. Hardin and lady are more devoted"
10221,CHAPTER IX.,"than ever;"" and they congratulated Mrs. Dr. Prague on the _nice match_"
10222,CHAPTER IX.,"she had secured for her daughter Marion. And the haughty, vain mother"
10223,CHAPTER IX.,"exulted, for she was a superficial observer of human nature, and could"
10224,CHAPTER IX.,"not, or _would_ not, see the wasting woe that was preying on her"
10225,CHAPTER IX.,daughter's health and beauty.
10226,CHAPTER IX.,
10227,CHAPTER IX.,It was a gay season at the doctor's mansion. Sheldon's arrival was the
10228,CHAPTER IX.,"signal for a round of entertainments among the élite of the city; for,"
10229,CHAPTER IX.,"be it known, there were others than good Mrs. Prague anxious to secure"
10230,CHAPTER IX.,"so eligible a match for their daughters, as the handsome, rich and"
10231,CHAPTER IX.,"gifted Frank Sheldon. A manoeuvring mother! reader, hast ever seen"
10232,CHAPTER IX.,"one? And if so, dost know of another so contemptible thing in the whole"
10233,CHAPTER IX.,"broad realm of the low, sordid and despicable?"
10234,CHAPTER IX.,
10235,CHAPTER IX.,"The good old doctor, with his usual obstinacy, insisted that Annie"
10236,CHAPTER IX.,"Evalyn should make one of all the parties of amusement; and, in truth,"
10237,CHAPTER IX.,Sheldon was quite as anxious to secure her society as was the doctor to
10238,CHAPTER IX.,"""set her forward,"" as Mrs. Prague expressed it. That lady was"
10239,CHAPTER IX.,exceedingly vexed and mortified at the turn matters were taking; but
10240,CHAPTER IX.,"Kate, partaking largely of her father's easy nature, seemed as merry and"
10241,CHAPTER IX.,"well-pleased as though Sheldon had fallen in love with her, instead of"
10242,CHAPTER IX.,Annie Evalyn; for it began to be whispered in the upper circles that
10243,CHAPTER IX.,"""Dr. Prague's pretty governess had captivated the fascinating Sheldon."""
10244,CHAPTER IX.,Many ugly grimaces distorted the proper faces of marriageable daughters;
10245,CHAPTER IX.,"and captious, ill-natured remarks were indulged in by disappointed"
10246,CHAPTER IX.,"maidens, who had beggared their fathers' pockets to purchase silks and"
10247,CHAPTER IX.,"satins, jewels and diamonds, to carry by storm the heart of the elegant,"
10248,CHAPTER IX.,accomplished Frank Sheldon.
10249,CHAPTER IX.,
10250,CHAPTER IX.,"Alas for human hopes and expectations! And what a perverse, capricious,"
10251,CHAPTER IX.,"wilful little fellow is this god of love, whom we all worship and make"
10252,CHAPTER IX.,"offerings to in one form or another! Why, he never goes where he should;"
10253,CHAPTER IX.,"that is, you may hang him a dome, with golden draperies, stud the walls"
10254,CHAPTER IX.,"with pearls and rubies, put a divinity there, beautiful as the fabled"
10255,CHAPTER IX.,"houris, and robed in eastern magnificence, with discretion's self to"
10256,CHAPTER IX.,"open the portal and invite his entrance; still, he goes not in. A"
10257,CHAPTER IX.,"humming-bird around a rose has caught his vagrant eye, and he is off to"

10279,CHAPTER X.,"Sheldon was gone to conclude an extensive land contract, into which he"
10280,CHAPTER X.,was entering with Lawrence Hardin; allured by flattering representations
10281,CHAPTER X.,"of the immense emolument sure to result from these speculations, when"
10282,CHAPTER X.,emigration should raise to an untold value the worth of those extensive
10283,CHAPTER X.,"tracts, then lying wild and uncultivated through those western"

10285,CHAPTER X.,
10286,CHAPTER X.,"Dr. Prague had also advised him to the course, regarding it as the"
10287,CHAPTER X.,"easiest method of keeping good the fortune of Sheldon, whose choice of"
10288,CHAPTER X.,literature as a profession tended rather to diminish than increase his
10289,CHAPTER X.,coffers. And so he embarked his all with Hardin; and all thought him

10471,CHAPTER XI.,"gaze. O, Marion! why couldn't you have smiled then? What might not one"
10472,CHAPTER XI.,genial look from your sweet eyes have averted?
10473,CHAPTER XI.,
10474,CHAPTER XI.,"Hardin turned away, his heart cold and callous."
10475,CHAPTER XI.,
10476,CHAPTER XI.,"""Fool am I to hesitate!"" he muttered; ""who cares for me, and whom should"
10477,CHAPTER XI.,"I care for?"""
10478,CHAPTER XI.,
10479,CHAPTER XI.,"Drawing a chair close to Sumpter's, they conferred in whispers for the"
10480,CHAPTER XI.,space of an hour. Then both arose.
10481,CHAPTER XI.,
10482,CHAPTER XI.,"""Now make yourself presentable, Jack,"" said Hardin, ""and we'll proceed"
10483,CHAPTER XI.,"forthwith to put our scheme afoot."""
10484,CHAPTER XI.,
10485,CHAPTER XI.,"""I shall be ready in due season,"" was the answer."
10486,CHAPTER XI.,
10487,CHAPTER XI.,"There was a select company assembled at Dr. Prague's mansion, enjoying"
10488,CHAPTER XI.,the evening in music and conversation. Annie had just sung a song that
10489,CHAPTER XI.,"elicited much applause, and Sheldon had contrived to draw her aside to"
10490,CHAPTER XI.,whisper some word of tenderness in her ear.
10491,CHAPTER XI.,
10492,CHAPTER XI.,"""Frank,"" said she, ""I feel strangely to-night."""
10493,CHAPTER XI.,
10494,CHAPTER XI.,"""Why, Annie, are you not happy?"""
10495,CHAPTER XI.,
10496,CHAPTER XI.,"""Yes, but I tremble; I'm frightened. I feel as if some awful danger were"
10497,CHAPTER XI.,"impending."""
10498,CHAPTER XI.,
10499,CHAPTER XI.,"As she Spoke thus, the door opened, and Esq. Hardin, and his friend, Mr."
10500,CHAPTER XI.,"Sumpter, were announced. They mingled with the company and soon"
10501,CHAPTER XI.,approached the group in which Sheldon and Annie had chosen a place.
10502,CHAPTER XI.,Hardin presented his friend to the several ladies and gentlemen
10503,CHAPTER XI.,"composing the circle, and passed on, leaving Sumpter sitting opposite"
10504,CHAPTER XI.,"Annie. Glancing casually toward him, she found his gaze riveted on her"
10505,CHAPTER XI.,face.
10506,CHAPTER XI.,
10507,CHAPTER XI.,"""May I ask, miss,"" he said, ""if you are not from the eastern country?"""
10508,CHAPTER XI.,
10509,CHAPTER XI.,She replied in the affirmative.
10510,CHAPTER XI.,
10511,CHAPTER XI.,"""Well, I thought I could not be so much mistaken. How are you contented"
10512,CHAPTER XI.,"away out here?"""
10513,CHAPTER XI.,
10514,CHAPTER XI.,"""Very well, sir,"" she answered."
10515,CHAPTER XI.,
10516,CHAPTER XI.,"""Ay, indeed. I've heard say old loves were hard to forget; but I suppose"
10517,CHAPTER XI.,"new ones will obliterate them if anything will."""
10518,CHAPTER XI.,
10519,CHAPTER XI.,By this time the attention of the group was drawn to them.
10520,CHAPTER XI.,
10521,CHAPTER XI.,"""Do you ever hear from your old Aunt Patty, now?"" he continued, in the"
10522,CHAPTER XI.,"same bold, familiar manner."
10523,CHAPTER XI.,
10524,CHAPTER XI.,Annie was startled to hear these words from one who was a stranger to
10525,CHAPTER XI.,"her; but as so many eyes were on them, she thought best to answer"
10526,CHAPTER XI.,"courteously, and said, ""I do sir, frequently."""
10527,CHAPTER XI.,
10528,CHAPTER XI.,"""Does she live there in the old rock heap at Scraggiewood, and tell"
10529,CHAPTER XI.,"fortunes and bewitch sitting hens yet?"""
10530,CHAPTER XI.,
10531,CHAPTER XI.,"""Sir!"" exclaimed Sheldon, ""how dare you thus insult a lady in company?"""
10532,CHAPTER XI.,
10533,CHAPTER XI.,"""O, be cool, my good fellow! I never yet heard it was an insult to"
10534,CHAPTER XI.,"inquire after one's honest relations, and I've done nothing more, as"
10535,CHAPTER XI.,this lady I'm sure will admit. I can perhaps give you some information
10536,CHAPTER XI.,"respecting your former lover, George Wild, Miss Evalyn,"" he continued;"
10537,CHAPTER XI.,"""he is good and true yet."""
10538,CHAPTER XI.,
10539,CHAPTER XI.,A scream from Annie arrested his words. She had fainted. Sheldon bore
10540,CHAPTER XI.,"her from the room amidst a buzz of voices, in which Sumpter's was"
10541,CHAPTER XI.,"loudest, declaring he ""did not mean to embarrass the young lady. He did"
10542,CHAPTER XI.,"not know but what they were all acquainted with her early history."""
10543,CHAPTER XI.,
10544,CHAPTER XI.,"Sheldon did not rejoin the company, and during the remainder of the"
10545,CHAPTER XI.,evening Sumpter disseminated an exaggerated account of Annie's low birth
10546,CHAPTER XI.,and disgraceful parentage among the guests. The tale found too many
10547,CHAPTER XI.,"willing ears; and Annie was pronounced a vile, artful deceiver, by those"
10548,CHAPTER XI.,who envied her talents and beauty.

10556,CHAPTER XII.,Are trifling and decay!
10557,CHAPTER XII.,"And those who prize the paltry things,"
10558,CHAPTER XII.,More trifling still than they.
10559,CHAPTER XII.,"And what is friendship but a name,"
10560,CHAPTER XII.,A charm that lulls to sleep;
10561,CHAPTER XII.,"A shade that follows wealth and fame,"
10562,CHAPTER XII.,"But leaves the wretch to weep?"""
10563,CHAPTER XII.,
10564,CHAPTER XII.,
10565,CHAPTER XII.,"When Annie Evalyn recovered consciousness, Sheldon was bending over her,"
10566,CHAPTER XII.,bathing her temples with cologne. As the memory of the recent scene
10567,CHAPTER XII.,"rushed over her, her cheeks flushed, and she glanced timidly in his"
10568,CHAPTER XII.,"face. It was cold--stern, she fancied."
10569,CHAPTER XII.,
10570,CHAPTER XII.,"""Annie,"" said he, in a measured tone, ""you are better now. I will leave"
10571,CHAPTER XII.,"you for to-night, and to-morrow shall hope for an explanation of what, I"
10572,CHAPTER XII.,"must confess, seems strange and mysterious to me at present."
10573,CHAPTER XII.,"Good-night!"" and he turned to leave the room."
10574,CHAPTER XII.,
10575,CHAPTER XII.,"""Good-night!"" she faintly articulated, her eyes following his retreating"
10576,CHAPTER XII.,"figure till the door closed and excluded him from view. ""Yes, and a long"
10577,CHAPTER XII.,"good-night too, Frank Sheldon!"" she continued, when she was alone; ""if"
10578,CHAPTER XII.,"you can thus coldly turn from me,--thus lightly suspect me of artifice"
10579,CHAPTER XII.,"and deceit. O, my God, what a blow! and to fall at such a moment, when I"
10580,CHAPTER XII.,"believed myself almost at the pinnacle of happiness! Surely, the"
10581,CHAPTER XII.,arch-fiend directed the hand. Such words to be spoken in a fashionable
10582,CHAPTER XII.,"circle; and they'll all accredit it, for they have,--Heaven knows"
10583,CHAPTER XII.,"why!--long been seeking something to my dispraise. And besides, I cannot"
10584,CHAPTER XII.,"contradict the man's words, for are they not too true? and yet, O must"
10585,CHAPTER XII.,"I be blamed for my humble parentage? O aunty, aunty, I'll not cast a"
10586,CHAPTER XII.,single reflection! You say you've left off fortune-telling for _my_
10587,CHAPTER XII.,sake--but it is too late now; and perhaps you'll need resort to it again
10588,CHAPTER XII.,"to support your poor, unfortunate Annie. I'm going to you, aunty; the"
10589,CHAPTER XII.,rough roof of old Scraggiewood will be above me in a few weeks. Would I
10590,CHAPTER XII.,"had never wandered from beneath its homely shelter! Truly, the world"
10591,CHAPTER XII.,"_is_ a hard, cold place, aunty, as you forewarned; but I could not"
10592,CHAPTER XII.,"believe it then."""
10593,CHAPTER XII.,
10594,CHAPTER XII.,Annie rose and proceeded mechanically to place a few necessary articles
10595,CHAPTER XII.,"of clothing in a small satchel; this done, she sat down by the window to"
10596,CHAPTER XII.,"wait till all was quiet below. The rich clothing, the wages and presents"
10597,CHAPTER XII.,"she had received during her two years' residence beneath that roof,--she"
10598,CHAPTER XII.,would leave them all behind; they were bestowed when she was deemed a
10599,CHAPTER XII.,"worthy object, and _now_ they would consider it was a vile, artful"
10600,CHAPTER XII.,deceiver that had sought to ingratiate herself into their favor to
10601,CHAPTER XII.,"accomplish her own low, selfish designs. She was a fool for going abroad"
10602,CHAPTER XII.,in the great world; a fool to think she could ever become respected
10603,CHAPTER XII.,"and loved. _Love!_ There was no such thing! Had not Frank Sheldon,"
10604,CHAPTER XII.,"thirty-six hours after he vowed to love her forever, turned coldly away"
10605,CHAPTER XII.,"at a moment when she most needed his comforting attentions? And, as she"
10606,CHAPTER XII.,"thus thought, a groan of agony escaped her breast. There came a light"
10607,CHAPTER XII.,"tap on the door, and Kate entered hurriedly."
10608,CHAPTER XII.,
10609,CHAPTER XII.,"""O, Annie, Annie!"" she exclaimed, embracing the suffering girl warmly,"
10610,CHAPTER XII.,"""I don't believe a word that man said, nor does father either. He says"
10611,CHAPTER XII.,"if you are Satan's daughter, you are better and prettier, and wiser,"
10612,CHAPTER XII.,"than the best of them. As for Frank, he has not spoken since the company"
10613,CHAPTER XII.,"left, and I believe he is struck dumb. I was going to follow him when he"
10614,CHAPTER XII.,"brought you out, but mother prevented me."""
10615,CHAPTER XII.,
10616,CHAPTER XII.,"""She is enraged at me, of course,"" said Annie."
10617,CHAPTER XII.,
10618,CHAPTER XII.,"""O, she is hasty, you know!"" returned Kate. ""I dare say all will be"
10619,CHAPTER XII.,"right in a day or two; so dry your eyes and go to sleep, and wake up as"
10620,CHAPTER XII.,merry as if that ugly Mr. Sumpter had never come here with his impudent
10621,CHAPTER XII.,"stories. For my part, I wonder Lawrence should bring such a monster into"
10622,CHAPTER XII.,"genteel society;"" and with a kiss they parted."
10623,CHAPTER XII.,
10624,CHAPTER XII.,"Annie sat motionless another hour, and then, cautiously opening the"
10625,CHAPTER XII.,"door, listened breathlessly a few moments. All was still; and, taking"
10626,CHAPTER XII.,"her satchel, she glided noiselessly down the stairs and into the street."
10627,CHAPTER XII.,Her heart sank within her as the cold wind struck her cheek; but she
10628,CHAPTER XII.,"moved rapidly forward, eager to place a distance between her and the"
10629,CHAPTER XII.,"scene of her abasement. Soon she was on the broad, rough prairie road,"
10630,CHAPTER XII.,"over which a waning moon cast pale, sickly beams. By daylight she"
10631,CHAPTER XII.,"reached a settler's cabin, and learned that a stage-coach would pass"
10632,CHAPTER XII.,"there in a few moments, bound eastward. She requested the privilege of"
10633,CHAPTER XII.,"waiting its arrival, which was readily granted, and also such"
10634,CHAPTER XII.,refreshments placed before her as the cabin afforded; but she could not
10635,CHAPTER XII.,"eat. The coach soon appeared, and she rejoiced to find herself the only"
10636,CHAPTER XII.,"passenger. The door was closed, and the hard, jolting vehicle rumbled on"
10637,CHAPTER XII.,"its way. And here was Annie Evalyn, the beautiful, the gifted, the"
10638,CHAPTER XII.,"admired Annie Evalyn of yesterday, flying like a guilty outcast from the"
10639,CHAPTER XII.,scenes amid which she had been so happy.
10640,CHAPTER XII.,
10641,CHAPTER XII.,"Great was the surprise at Dr. Prague's mansion, on the following"
10642,CHAPTER XII.,"morning, when Annie's flight became known. No token was left by which a"
10643,CHAPTER XII.,clue to her course might be discovered. Sheldon carried himself like a
10644,CHAPTER XII.,"crazy one. The old doctor bustled about, and said he would search the"
10645,CHAPTER XII.,"world over to bring her back. Kate cried, and the children loudly"
10646,CHAPTER XII.,bewailed the loss of their dear governess. Mrs. Prague seemed the only
10647,CHAPTER XII.,calm and rational one in the household; she declared herself glad to get
10648,CHAPTER XII.,"rid of the baggage, and considered her flight proof positive of her"
10649,CHAPTER XII.,guilt.
10650,CHAPTER XII.,
10651,CHAPTER XII.,"This view seemed rather plausible certainly. If innocent, why did she"
10652,CHAPTER XII.,not remain and boldly refute the tale Sumpter had told?
10653,CHAPTER XII.,
10654,CHAPTER XII.,"When the news of her flight was made known to Esquire Hardin, he laughed"
10655,CHAPTER XII.,"heartily, and called up Sumpter to join him. The latter expressed"
10656,CHAPTER XII.,"himself ""sorry if he had unwittingly been the cause of an unpleasant"
10657,CHAPTER XII.,"occurrence in Dr. Prague's family."""
10658,CHAPTER XII.,
10659,CHAPTER XII.,"""What, the deuce!"" said Hardin, ""do you suppose they wish to harbor a"
10660,CHAPTER XII.,"young witch?"""
10661,CHAPTER XII.,
10662,CHAPTER XII.,"""Why, no,--but this gentleman, Mr. Sheldon."""
10663,CHAPTER XII.,
10664,CHAPTER XII.,"""Give yourself no uneasiness in regard to me, sir!"" said Sheldon,"
10665,CHAPTER XII.,"sternly. ""I will manage and control my own affairs."""
10666,CHAPTER XII.,
10667,CHAPTER XII.,"""Bravely spoken, Frank!"" remarked Hardin, ""Now let us adjourn to the"
10668,CHAPTER XII.,"dinner-saloon and drink a merry bout over fortunate denouement."""

10679,CHAPTER XIII.,"The shaft ne'er sped in vain."""
10680,CHAPTER XIII.,
10681,CHAPTER XIII.,
10682,CHAPTER XIII.,"The wild winds wailed wofully over the lonesome prairie, smiting sadly"
10683,CHAPTER XIII.,"upon poor Annie's heavy heart as she sat in the hard, jolting coach,"
10684,CHAPTER XIII.,"which, owing to the bad state of the roads, made but sorry progress. It"
10685,CHAPTER XIII.,"was already dark, and the driver said they had yet ten miles to ride in"
10686,CHAPTER XIII.,"order to reach the nearest post town. They entered a dense timber land,"
10687,CHAPTER XIII.,"and the wheels struck deep into a loose, gravelly sand, so the poor"
10688,CHAPTER XIII.,horses could scarcely drag on at a slow walk. The coachman hallooed and
10689,CHAPTER XIII.,"cracked his whip about their ears, but all to no effect; the animals"
10690,CHAPTER XIII.,"were worn down by a hard day's travel; and Annie, annoyed by his"
10691,CHAPTER XIII.,"boisterous vociferations, at last put her head out the window and begged"
10692,CHAPTER XIII.,"him not to beat the jaded animals, but let them proceed at their own"
10693,CHAPTER XIII.,pace.
10694,CHAPTER XIII.,
10695,CHAPTER XIII.,"""All one to me, miss,"" was the answer; ""did it to please you; thought"
10696,CHAPTER XIII.,"you mought be a hungry, or mebbe sort o' tired, a settin' in there all"

10700,CHAPTER XIII.,
10701,CHAPTER XIII.,"With this philosophical reflection, he relapsed into silence, and for"
10702,CHAPTER XIII.,"two hours they continued to drag through the heavy sand, with nothing to"
10703,CHAPTER XIII.,"relieve the monotony, save the shrill bark of the wolf, far in the deep"
10704,CHAPTER XIII.,"forest, answered by the deep growl of the bear, or piercing cry of the"
10705,CHAPTER XIII.,ferocious catamount.
10706,CHAPTER XIII.,
10707,CHAPTER XIII.,"Annie shivered with nervous terror at these wild, savage sounds; and"
10708,CHAPTER XIII.,"when at last, as they reached the open prairie, and struck a harder"
10709,CHAPTER XIII.,"bottom, the horses mended their paces, she felt sensibly relieved. At"
10710,CHAPTER XIII.,"length they entered a small, new town, and drew up before a large,"
10711,CHAPTER XIII.,"awkward building. The steps were lowered and Annie alighted, and soon"
10712,CHAPTER XIII.,"found herself in a long, dingy apartment, with a bright pine-wood fire"
10713,CHAPTER XIII.,"blazing and crackling in a huge, yawning fire-place at its farthest"
10714,CHAPTER XIII.,"extremity. She was chilled, and sat down before the glowing hearth to"
10715,CHAPTER XIII.,"warm her benumbed fingers. Presently a tall woman, in a short-sleeved"
10716,CHAPTER XIII.,"frock and large deer-skin moccasins, strode into the room, and with a"
10717,CHAPTER XIII.,"deep, ungainly courtesy asked, ""What the lady would be thinking to take"
10718,CHAPTER XIII.,"for a bit of supper?"""
10719,CHAPTER XIII.,
10720,CHAPTER XIII.,"Annie answered she would take a biscuit and cup of tea, if she pleased,"
10721,CHAPTER XIII.,"and then retire to her apartment, as she was much fatigued."
10722,CHAPTER XIII.,
10723,CHAPTER XIII.,"""And won't you have a chunk o' venison, or cold 'possum, to make your"
10724,CHAPTER XIII.,"biscuit relish, miss?"" asked the woman."
10725,CHAPTER XIII.,
10726,CHAPTER XIII.,"""No, I thank you,"" said Annie; ""I don't feel much hungry to-night."""
10727,CHAPTER XIII.,
10728,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Why, I reckoned you must be well-nigh starved, a ridin' all day long,"
10729,CHAPTER XIII.,"and nothing to lay your jaws to; but, howsomever, you know your own"

10731,CHAPTER XIII.,
10732,CHAPTER XIII.,"The woman went out, and soon returned with Annie's supper spread on a"
10733,CHAPTER XIII.,pine board. Annie could hardly repress a smile at sight of the novel
10734,CHAPTER XIII.,"tea-table. Her meal was quickly despatched, and she again signified her"
10735,CHAPTER XIII.,"wish to retire. It was a rough, dismal apartment into which she was"
10736,CHAPTER XIII.,"ushered, but, tired and jaded, she threw herself on the hard couch, and,"
10737,CHAPTER XIII.,"despite the trouble at her heart, slept soundly till morning."
10738,CHAPTER XIII.,
10739,CHAPTER XIII.,"On rising, her first thought was to examine her little stock of money,"
10740,CHAPTER XIII.,"and she found it amounted to only seventeen dollars and a half, out of"
10741,CHAPTER XIII.,which she must pay her coach and tavern fare. It was evident that she
10742,CHAPTER XIII.,must seek some employment to assist in defraying her travelling
10743,CHAPTER XIII.,"expenses. The question was, whether she should remain where she was, or"
10744,CHAPTER XIII.,go on as far as her scanty means would carry her. She went out to make
10745,CHAPTER XIII.,some inquiries of the woman who had waited on her the night previous.
10746,CHAPTER XIII.,
10747,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Get some work to do, miss!"" said she in a tone of surprise. ""What can"
10748,CHAPTER XIII.,"you do? Can you cut fodder, or cradle rye, or catch 'possums?"""
10749,CHAPTER XIII.,
10750,CHAPTER XIII.,"Annie smiled, and said, ""No, but I can teach school, do sewing, or"

10753,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Wall, I don't know; you look a mighty fine lady to be asking for work;"

10759,CHAPTER XIII.,
10760,CHAPTER XIII.,"Matters looked unpromising, and Annie concluded to follow the woman's"
10761,CHAPTER XIII.,"suggestion, and travel on as far as the small funds would carry her. But"
10762,CHAPTER XIII.,"in the two years she had been at the west, the facilities for travelling"
10763,CHAPTER XIII.,"had improved, and prices were also reduced, so that her little purse"
10764,CHAPTER XIII.,carried her much further on her route than she had expected. When it
10765,CHAPTER XIII.,"finally gave out, she with great joy found she was but fifty miles from"
10766,CHAPTER XIII.,"her destination, and with a courageous heart resolved to perform the"
10767,CHAPTER XIII.,remainder of the journey on foot.
10768,CHAPTER XIII.,
10769,CHAPTER XIII.,"Accordingly, she set forward. The weather was fine, and she did not"
10770,CHAPTER XIII.,"doubt her ability to accomplish the distance in two days, at farthest."
10771,CHAPTER XIII.,"Every mile passed inspired her with fresh courage, for was she not so"
10772,CHAPTER XIII.,"much nearer a heart that loved her? O, how she longed to be clasped to"

10789,CHAPTER XIV.,"the wild, old forest of Scraggiewood, as we saw it long ago when Annie"
10790,CHAPTER XIV.,Evalyn's years were calm and golden-hued as Luna's gentle rays. She was
10791,CHAPTER XIV.,"coming now to the low, cottage home. With weary, languid step, she"
10792,CHAPTER XIV.,"threaded the old, familiar path, and it seemed to have grown rougher,"
10793,CHAPTER XIV.,and the forest looked wilder and darker than in the days gone by. Poor
10794,CHAPTER XIV.,"Annie! the darkness and gloom were in thy weary, world-tossed heart."
10795,CHAPTER XIV.,That heart beat wildly as she drew nearer the wished-for spot. What if
10796,CHAPTER XIV.,she should see no light gleaming through the aperture in the rocky

10798,CHAPTER XIV.,"welcome the wanderer's return? She quickened her pace, and a few moments"
10799,CHAPTER XIV.,"banished all fears. The cottage came in view, and a bright light"
10800,CHAPTER XIV.,"streamed through the rough-cut window. Now Annie clasped her hands, and"
10801,CHAPTER XIV.,thanked God that her journey was well-nigh ended. She saw her aunt
10802,CHAPTER XIV.,"bending over the embers on the hearth, as she paused a moment on the"

10818,CHAPTER XIV.,"just as it used to, only darker and more frightful."""
10819,CHAPTER XIV.,
10820,CHAPTER XIV.,"""Come here, darling, 'tis you! I know that voice. O how many times I've"
10821,CHAPTER XIV.,"dreamed I heard it in the long, lonesome nights!"" and she wept, laughed,"
10822,CHAPTER XIV.,"and kissed her recovered child in a perfect abandonment of joy. ""And so"
10823,CHAPTER XIV.,you have come home at last to see your old aunty? I've had awful
10824,CHAPTER XIV.,"feelings about you lately, hinney, and boding dreams; and ofttimes I've"
10825,CHAPTER XIV.,been sorry I let you go into the evil world; 'for if it should use her
10826,CHAPTER XIV.,"hard, would it not break both our hearts?' I said to myself. 'But, then,"
10827,CHAPTER XIV.,"Annie is so pretty and good, and has got so much book-learnin' and so"
10828,CHAPTER XIV.,"many accomplishments,' something would say. 'Ay, that's the mischief of"
10829,CHAPTER XIV.,"it. Such things always make bad folks envy those that possess them, and"
10830,CHAPTER XIV.,"Annie is so tender-hearted and shrinking, I'm afeard, I'm afeard for"
10831,CHAPTER XIV.,"her.'"""
10832,CHAPTER XIV.,
10833,CHAPTER XIV.,"Annie sunk her head on her aunt's shoulder while she was speaking thus,"
10834,CHAPTER XIV.,"and the tears, she had been striving to suppress since her entrance,"
10835,CHAPTER XIV.,began to roll over her cheeks thick and fast. The excitement and anxiety
10836,CHAPTER XIV.,of the journey had in a measure diverted her mind from the events which
10837,CHAPTER XIV.,"caused it; but now that she had gained the wished-for haven, her aunty's"
10838,CHAPTER XIV.,words brought the past before her vision; that mortifying
10839,CHAPTER XIV.,"humiliation--all she had enjoyed, all she had hoped for, and O, all she"
10840,CHAPTER XIV.,"had lost!--rushed upon her recollection, and she sobbed aloud."
10841,CHAPTER XIV.,
10842,CHAPTER XIV.,"""O, mercy, mercy, it is as I feared!"" exclaimed the old woman, in an"
10843,CHAPTER XIV.,"agonized tone; ""something has hurt my darling, and now I mark how pale"
10844,CHAPTER XIV.,"and thin she is grown. Annie, Annie, tell your aunty what's the matter."""
10845,CHAPTER XIV.,
10846,CHAPTER XIV.,Annie made a strong effort to calm her emotion.
10847,CHAPTER XIV.,
10848,CHAPTER XIV.,"""I am fatigued and overcome,"" she said."
10849,CHAPTER XIV.,
10850,CHAPTER XIV.,"""Ah! it is something more than that, child--I can tell; but you shall"
10851,CHAPTER XIV.,"rest till to-morrow. I'll make you a nice cup of tea, and then you shall"
10852,CHAPTER XIV.,lie in your little cot-bed once more. I've always kept it dressed white
10853,CHAPTER XIV.,"and clean, and often been in there nights before I laid my old bones"
10854,CHAPTER XIV.,"down to rest, and wished I could see my darling there, breathing long"
10855,CHAPTER XIV.,"and sweet, as she used to, in happy dreams."""
10856,CHAPTER XIV.,
10857,CHAPTER XIV.,"Annie was glad to retire, for she was indeed fatigued. Her aunt tucked"
10858,CHAPTER XIV.,"the counterpane snugly around her, and hung a shawl before the window,"
10859,CHAPTER XIV.,"""for hinney looked too pale and slender to bear the cold air now,"" she"
10860,CHAPTER XIV.,said. Then she insisted on sitting by the cot till her darling slept;
10861,CHAPTER XIV.,but Annie begged she would not.
10862,CHAPTER XIV.,
10863,CHAPTER XIV.,"""Go to bed, aunty, and get a good sleep, so as to be rested and fresh to"
10864,CHAPTER XIV.,"hear a long tale of my adventures to-morrow,"" and the kind old soul,"
10865,CHAPTER XIV.,"after kissing the white brow, bade Annie good-night, and sought her"
10866,CHAPTER XIV.,pillow.
10867,CHAPTER XIV.,
10868,CHAPTER XIV.,"It was long ere Annie slept, and when at last she did so, hideous shapes"
10869,CHAPTER XIV.,"and direful omens floated through her dreams. Once she awoke, when all"
10870,CHAPTER XIV.,"was dark and still, to find a burning fever on her cheek, and dull,"
10871,CHAPTER XIV.,throbbing pain in her temples. At peep of dawn the old woman rose and
10872,CHAPTER XIV.,stole into the apartment. She wanted to see her little pet sleeping in
10873,CHAPTER XIV.,"her cot-bed, as she used to years before. There she lay, her arms thrown"
10874,CHAPTER XIV.,"above her head as when a child, and the rich chestnut curls lying in"
10875,CHAPTER XIV.,"dark relief on the snowy pillow. But the deep, sweet respirations, and"
10876,CHAPTER XIV.,the healthful glow of childhood were not there. A blue circle surrounded
10877,CHAPTER XIV.,"the closed lids, and a fever-flush burned in the centre of each cheek."
10878,CHAPTER XIV.,"The aunt saw her darling was ill. She took one thin, hot hand in hers,"
10879,CHAPTER XIV.,and felt the pulse fluttering fast and wild. The sleeper woke and
10880,CHAPTER XIV.,"started up, turning her eyes quickly round the apartment."
10881,CHAPTER XIV.,
10882,CHAPTER XIV.,"""Don't you know where you are, Annie?"" asked the aunt. ""This is your old"
10883,CHAPTER XIV.,"room at Scraggiewood, and I'm your aunty."""
10884,CHAPTER XIV.,
10885,CHAPTER XIV.,"""O, yes! I remember now; but I think I'm sick, my poor head aches and"
10886,CHAPTER XIV.,"throbs so badly. You used to cure all my pains, aunty."""
10887,CHAPTER XIV.,
10888,CHAPTER XIV.,"""I hope I can cure you now, hinney. I'll go and prepare you a cooling"
10889,CHAPTER XIV.,"drink of herbs. You must be very quiet, and I trust you will be well in"
10890,CHAPTER XIV.,"a few days."""
10891,CHAPTER XIV.,
10892,CHAPTER XIV.,Annie submitted patiently. A week passed by ere she was able to make her
10893,CHAPTER XIV.,aunt fully acquainted with her woful tale. The poor woman seemed as much
10894,CHAPTER XIV.,"afflicted as Annie, but she strove by every means in her power to soothe"
10895,CHAPTER XIV.,and comfort the suffering heart. Netta Gray had been married to George
10896,CHAPTER XIV.,"Wild a few weeks before her return, and was now absent on a visiting"
10897,CHAPTER XIV.,"tour, and Annie's health continued feeble. It could hardly be otherwise"
10898,CHAPTER XIV.,with a mind so heavy and depressed. For several months she remained in
10899,CHAPTER XIV.,seclusion at the lowly cot in Scraggiewood.

10942,CHAPTER XV.,"but they've been bruised and broken in the very outset. I've no energy,"

10948,CHAPTER XV.,
10949,CHAPTER XV.,"Thus she ruminated, while the shadowy wintry days sped on; and reason,"
10950,CHAPTER XV.,weak and powerless in the headlong tide of passion that swept and swayed

10954,CHAPTER XV.,jubilate of triumph and redemption?
10955,CHAPTER XV.,
10956,CHAPTER XV.,Spring came at last. The snows disappeared; buds swelled on the tall
10957,CHAPTER XV.,"trees, and burst forth into canopies of leafy-green, and the feathered"
10958,CHAPTER XV.,"songsters came hieing from southern bowers, with wings of light and"
10959,CHAPTER XV.,"songs of gladness. Annie began to brighten; slowly, and almost"
10960,CHAPTER XV.,"imperceptibly at first, and without her own knowledge or consent. Those"

10975,CHAPTER XV.,"not all over. Some tears, some regrets, some rebellious thoughts, yet"

10978,CHAPTER XV.,
10979,CHAPTER XV.,"Netta returned from her travels, and the two friends, so long parted,"

11172,CHAPTER XVI.,"""You are getting to use me shabbily,"" he exclaimed, angrily; ""with all"
11173,CHAPTER XVI.,"Sheldon's fortune tucked away in your pocket, to say nothing of--you"
11174,CHAPTER XVI.,"know what--you refuse me so small a favor as a cool thousand. Come, hand"
11175,CHAPTER XVI.,"over, or, by Heaven, I'll inform against you!"""
11176,CHAPTER XVI.,
11177,CHAPTER XVI.,"""You can hardly do that, without marring your own good fame,"" said"
11178,CHAPTER XVI.,"Hardin, ironically; ""and I know you would shrink from doing that."""
11179,CHAPTER XVI.,
11180,CHAPTER XVI.,"""None of your sneers, Hardin,"" growled Sumpter, fiercely; ""will you give"
11181,CHAPTER XVI.,"me the money?"""
11182,CHAPTER XVI.,
11183,CHAPTER XVI.,"""No!"" thundered Hardin, with an oath; ""you shall not ride rough-shod"
11184,CHAPTER XVI.,"over me in this way. Now begone from my sight!"""
11185,CHAPTER XVI.,
11186,CHAPTER XVI.,"""Very well; good-evening, Esq. Hardin,"" said Sumpter, with a savage,"
11187,CHAPTER XVI.,"revengeful leer on his countenance, as he went out, slamming the door"
11188,CHAPTER XVI.,spitefully behind him.
11189,CHAPTER XVI.,
11190,CHAPTER XVI.,"Hardin was alarmed, after the wretch was gone, as he reflected how far"
11191,CHAPTER XVI.,"he was in the monster's power, and in what ruin he might involve him if"
11192,CHAPTER XVI.,he chose.
11193,CHAPTER XVI.,
11194,CHAPTER XVI.,
11195,CHAPTER XVI.,
11196,CHAPTER XVI.,
11197,CHAPTER XVII.,CHAPTER XVII.
11198,CHAPTER XVII.,
11199,CHAPTER XVII.,"""Now mark him in the tempest hour,"
11200,CHAPTER XVII.,"Will he be calm, or will he quail"
11201,CHAPTER XVII.,Before the fury of its power?
11202,CHAPTER XVII.,"----Read ye the tale."""
11203,CHAPTER XVII.,
11204,CHAPTER XVII.,
11205,CHAPTER XVII.,There are those that know not the extent of their powers till they are
11206,CHAPTER XVII.,called forth and tasked to the utmost by trial and misfortune. Such an
11207,CHAPTER XVII.,one was Frank Sheldon. Disposed to ease and quiet in the hour of
11208,CHAPTER XVII.,"prosperity, when adversity came, it aroused him at once to vigorous,"
11209,CHAPTER XVII.,"decisive action. Though bereft of love and fortune at a blow, as it"
11210,CHAPTER XVII.,"were, his manly spirit did not cower and sink beneath the strokes; that"
11211,CHAPTER XVII.,"he suffered is true, but he bore up bravely under the adverse fortune."
11212,CHAPTER XVII.,"He was proud, as all great minds are, and the blight so publicly cast on"
11213,CHAPTER XVII.,"Annie Evalyn's good repute, cut him to the quick; but he hoped she might"
11214,CHAPTER XVII.,"be able to refute the aspersions cast on her by Sumpter, for he was loth"
11215,CHAPTER XVII.,to think ill of a being that had appeared so amiable and exalted in her
11216,CHAPTER XVII.,"nature, so lofty in soul and intellect, and was beautiful as an angel in"
11217,CHAPTER XVII.,"person. But, instead of this, she fled by night from the scene of her"
11218,CHAPTER XVII.,"confusion, leaving behind all her effects, and no clue to her intended"
11219,CHAPTER XVII.,course. Did not this wear the appearance of guilt? Still he did not
11220,CHAPTER XVII.,"condemn her, but learned from Dr. Prague the place of her former"
11221,CHAPTER XVII.,"residence, and wrote a letter, assuring her of a continuance of"
11222,CHAPTER XVII.,"affection, and asking an explanation of Sumpter's strange tale. No"
11223,CHAPTER XVII.,"answer was returned,--indeed, the letter never reached its destination;"
11224,CHAPTER XVII.,"but this Sheldon did not know, and was forced to regard the silence as"
11225,CHAPTER XVII.,another proof of her cupidity.
11226,CHAPTER XVII.,
11227,CHAPTER XVII.,With this view of the matter he found it less difficult to subdue his
11228,CHAPTER XVII.,"passion. He could not, _would_ not love a guilty, artful thing."
11229,CHAPTER XVII.,
11230,CHAPTER XVII.,And now fell another blow in quick succession; his land investment
11231,CHAPTER XVII.,"proved worthless, and at a sweep his fortune went past power to recover."
11232,CHAPTER XVII.,"Hardin expressed much regret, but Sheldon could not avoid noticing that"
11233,CHAPTER XVII.,"he clutched at every opportunity to save his own affairs, and exposed"
11234,CHAPTER XVII.,him to the most uncertain hazards.
11235,CHAPTER XVII.,
11236,CHAPTER XVII.,"Old Dr. Prague loudly bewailed Sheldon's ill luck, and declared he would"
11237,CHAPTER XVII.,never forgive himself for having advised the young man to embark in the
11238,CHAPTER XVII.,cursed speculations. But Sheldon begged him not to be unnecessarily
11239,CHAPTER XVII.,"distressed, as it was no fault of his that the schemes proved abortive;"
11240,CHAPTER XVII.,"and the good doctor finally coincided, and settled down to his oranges"
11241,CHAPTER XVII.,with tolerable serenity.
11242,CHAPTER XVII.,
11243,CHAPTER XVII.,Sheldon did not long remain inactive; he left those scenes amid which
11244,CHAPTER XVII.,"misfortune had overtaken him, and repaired to the eastern cities, where"
11245,CHAPTER XVII.,"he readily found employ in an extensive printing establishment, and"
11246,CHAPTER XVII.,applied himself assiduously to his duties. In a short time he was
11247,CHAPTER XVII.,"admitted to the firm, and became assistant editor of a popular magazine."
11248,CHAPTER XVII.,"This was an occupation congenial to his tastes, as it afforded him not"
11249,CHAPTER XVII.,"only an opportunity of writing, but of reading, and becoming intimately"
11250,CHAPTER XVII.,acquainted with the polite literature of the day.
11251,CHAPTER XVII.,
11252,CHAPTER XVII.,"He was one day in the editorial sanctum, examining a quantity of"
11253,CHAPTER XVII.,"manuscripts lately received, when one, in a clear, delicate female hand,"
11254,CHAPTER XVII.,"attracted his eye. There was something in the light, fairy tracery which"
11255,CHAPTER XVII.,"instantly riveted his attention. He read it through; ""Woodland Winne,"""
11256,CHAPTER XVII.,"was the signature,--a _nomme de plume_, of course. He wondered who could"
11257,CHAPTER XVII.,be the fair authoress of this beautiful production.
11258,CHAPTER XVII.,
11259,CHAPTER XVII.,"While thus occupied in conjectures, a gentleman entered the apartment."
11260,CHAPTER XVII.,
11261,CHAPTER XVII.,"""Here, Wilberforce, do you know this MS.?"" said Sheldon, holding it"
11262,CHAPTER XVII.,toward him.
11263,CHAPTER XVII.,
11264,CHAPTER XVII.,"""O, yes!"" answered the gentleman, glancing it over; ""beautiful hand, is"
11265,CHAPTER XVII.,"it not?"""
11266,CHAPTER XVII.,
11267,CHAPTER XVII.,"""Yes; but who is the writer?"""
11268,CHAPTER XVII.,
11269,CHAPTER XVII.,"""O, I don't know that! I have had several communications from the same"
11270,CHAPTER XVII.,"pen in the last three months, all exquisite in their style and diction,"
11271,CHAPTER XVII.,"and eliciting warm commendation from the literary press."""
11272,CHAPTER XVII.,
11273,CHAPTER XVII.,"""And cannot you discover the fair unknown?"""
11274,CHAPTER XVII.,
11275,CHAPTER XVII.,"""No, I have addressed her under her _nomme de plume_, and desired her"
11276,CHAPTER XVII.,"true name remitted, in confidence, if she objected to publicity; but she"
11277,CHAPTER XVII.,"has never seen fit to gratify my curiosity."""
11278,CHAPTER XVII.,
11279,CHAPTER XVII.,"""Strange one so deserving should shun notoriety,"" remarked Sheldon."
11280,CHAPTER XVII.,
11281,CHAPTER XVII.,"""So it seems to me,"" said Wilberforce, who was the senior editor; ""but I"
11282,CHAPTER XVII.,came in to call you to the Literary Association; it meets at three
11283,CHAPTER XVII.,"o'clock. Come, let's be off, or we shall be too late;--these MSS. we can"
11284,CHAPTER XVII.,"look over to-morrow."""
11285,CHAPTER XVII.,
11286,CHAPTER XVII.,They closed the office and went out in company. But Sheldon forgot
11287,CHAPTER XVII.,"himself several times in the debate, as a semblance of that delicate"
11288,CHAPTER XVII.,"manuscript, enwrit with those clear, sparkling fancies, rose often"
11289,CHAPTER XVII.,before his mental vision.
11290,CHAPTER XVII.,
11291,CHAPTER XVII.,"There seemed to be a spell about it, to charm and lead captive his"

11315,CHAPTER XVIII.,Lawrence Hardin returned from a southern trip to find his house left
11316,CHAPTER XVIII.,desolate; wife and child both in their hastily-covered graves. He shook
11317,CHAPTER XVIII.,"with agony, and scarce was the first frantic burst of grief subsided,"
11318,CHAPTER XVIII.,ere the officers of justice entered his mansion and declared him their
11319,CHAPTER XVIII.,prisoner. He glared at them wildly.
11320,CHAPTER XVIII.,
11321,CHAPTER XVIII.,"""What mean you,"" he asked, ""by this untimely intrusion in the house of"
11322,CHAPTER XVIII.,"death?"""
11323,CHAPTER XVIII.,
11324,CHAPTER XVIII.,"""Prepare to accompany us to the court-room immediately,"" was the answer,"

11331,CHAPTER XVIII.,"will, Mr. Officer. Life is a curse to me henceforth."""
11332,CHAPTER XVIII.,
11333,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Thus speaking, he resigned himself passively to the custody of the"
11334,CHAPTER XVIII.,"sheriffs. They conducted him instantly to the court-house, and placed"
11335,CHAPTER XVIII.,"him in the prisoner's box beside Sumpter, who cowered and moved away at"
11336,CHAPTER XVIII.,"his approach. Hardin threw a look of envenomed hatred on the wretch, and"
11337,CHAPTER XVIII.,sat down. When the charges were read he merely bowed; and when asked
11338,CHAPTER XVIII.,"what he had to plead, replied: ""Nothing, only that they would hang him"
11339,CHAPTER XVIII.,"up as soon as convenient, and thus end his misery."" He was placed in"
11340,CHAPTER XVIII.,"jail with Sumpter, and several other defaulters, to await a final trial"

11342,CHAPTER XVIII.,
11343,CHAPTER XVIII.,"And the pestilence swept on; young and old, rich and poor, all fell"

11346,CHAPTER XVIII.,his solitary mansion. Where should the mourner turn for consolation? At
11347,CHAPTER XVIII.,"this crisis, he thought of his old friend, Parson Grey, and determined"
11348,CHAPTER XVIII.,"to quit the city for a few weeks, till the epidemic should have"
11349,CHAPTER XVIII.,"subsided, and make him a visit. He was just the calm, holy spirit he"
11350,CHAPTER XVIII.,needed to solace his afflictions; and accordingly a letter was
11351,CHAPTER XVIII.,"despatched, which brought a speedy reply, sympathizing in his distress,"
11352,CHAPTER XVIII.,and urgently inviting him to join them as soon as possible.
11353,CHAPTER XVIII.,
11354,CHAPTER XVIII.,"He visited Hardin before departing, informed him of the death of all his"

11366,CHAPTER XVIII.,decision in the case of the extensive forgeries and bank frauds of
11367,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Hardin and Sumpter. There could be little doubt of the verdict, as the"
11368,CHAPTER XVIII.,"evidence against the parties was powerful and conclusive, and none"
11369,CHAPTER XVIII.,seemed so regardless of the issue as the prisoners themselves. With
11370,CHAPTER XVIII.,"hard, stoical faces, they confronted the jury, as they returned from"

11377,CHAPTER XVIII.,"through the heavens with tremendous crashings, as the judge arose, and,"
11378,CHAPTER XVIII.,"turning toward the jury, asked, in solemn accents, if they had agreed"
11379,CHAPTER XVIII.,upon a verdict.

11388,CHAPTER XVIII.,Smothered screams at this moment issued from various parts of the

11390,CHAPTER XVIII.,ensued. Frantic cries and shrieks mingled with the bellowings of the
11391,CHAPTER XVIII.,"storm without, rendering the scene awful beyond description. All rushed"
11392,CHAPTER XVIII.,pell-mell for the street. The crackling flames burst through the broad
11393,CHAPTER XVIII.,"windows on the side of the judges' platform, rolling a dense volume of"
11394,CHAPTER XVIII.,smoke and stifling heat into the interior of the building. In the wild
11395,CHAPTER XVIII.,"excitement and terror, the prisoners were forgotten. They stood in the"
11396,CHAPTER XVIII.,box where they had received sentence. The flames were rapidly
11397,CHAPTER XVIII.,approaching them. Sumpter turned a glance full of hatred and vengeance
11398,CHAPTER XVIII.,"on Hardin. ""You swore revenge on Sheldon,"" said he, ""and I helped you"
11399,CHAPTER XVIII.,accomplish your iniquitous designs. You refused a paltry sum when I
11400,CHAPTER XVIII.,"asked it, and then I swore revenge on you, and this is the way I finish"

11403,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Hardin drew a revolver from his breast; ""And this is the way I finish"

11405,CHAPTER XVIII.,"Then, springing quick as lightning over the box, he rushed among the"
11406,CHAPTER XVIII.,"crowd and gained the street. The intense darkness favored his flight,"
11407,CHAPTER XVIII.,"and, hurrying on, he gained the levees, secreted himself in the hold of"
11408,CHAPTER XVIII.,"a boat, and had the good fortune to find himself floating down the river"

11578,CHAPTER XX.,"writing under a fictitious signature, her identity was well known in"

11580,CHAPTER XX.,"destroyed his tale of her duplicity and artifice, and the highest"

11582,CHAPTER XX.,"and suffering stole over her sometimes, as she mingled again 'mid the"
11583,CHAPTER XX.,scenes of its enacting; but she was too wise and good to allow it to
11584,CHAPTER XX.,"rankle, or stir bitter feelings in her bosom. Let the past be forgotten"

11664,CHAPTER XX.,"upon her soft cheek, and she glided away to her own apartment. A long"
11665,CHAPTER XX.,time on her downy couch she lay gazing on the moonbeams that glinted
11666,CHAPTER XX.,"over the rich flowers of the Persian carpet, while crowding thoughts and"
11667,CHAPTER XX.,"fancies thronged upon her brain. Most prominent were those of Sheldon,"
11668,CHAPTER XX.,and his connection with the magazine for which she had written her
11669,CHAPTER XX.,"prizes. Amid wonderings and fancyings she fell asleep, to follow them up"
11670,CHAPTER XX.,"in dreams, with every variation of hue and coloring. She was roaming"
11671,CHAPTER XX.,"through the gravelled avenues of an extensive flower-garden, when a"

11673,CHAPTER XX.,"and wherever she turned her steps, it followed, hovering just above her"
11674,CHAPTER XX.,"head; and the delicate colors seemed to strike a warm, heart-thrilling"
11675,CHAPTER XX.,"joy down to the inmost recesses of her soul. She woke, with a delicious"

11699,CHAPTER XXI.,
11700,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Why, bless my eyes! Frank Sheldon, my boy, do I behold you at last? And"

11714,CHAPTER XXI.,"of it all?"" She dared not hope or anticipate. She dared not think at"
11715,CHAPTER XXI.,"all; and, throwing her graceful form on a sofa, she commenced tearing"
11716,CHAPTER XXI.,"some water-color paintings she had lately been executing, into strips,"
11717,CHAPTER XXI.,and twisting them into gas-lighters.
11718,CHAPTER XXI.,
11719,CHAPTER XXI.,Meantime Sheldon was snugly bestowed in a cushioned seat beside his good
11720,CHAPTER XXI.,"friend, the doctor, who was plying him with a thousand questions"

11722,CHAPTER XXI.,"these points, he recollected Sheldon had mentioned some business as the"

11724,CHAPTER XXI.,
11725,CHAPTER XXI.,"""What was it you said about business bringing you so unexpectedly?"" he"

11729,CHAPTER XXI.,"""You wrong me, sir,"" returned Sheldon, ""by such an insinuation. I would"
11730,CHAPTER XXI.,"have visited you in the summer, in any event. I merely intended to say"

11751,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Good!"" exclaimed the doctor, in a tone of gleeful chuckling. ""Ha, ha,"

11771,CHAPTER XXI.,
11772,CHAPTER XXI.,"Sheldon could not forbear laughing now, as he informed the doctor of his"

11775,CHAPTER XXI.,"""Well, you want to see this lady?"" he said, when it had subsided. ""I'll"

11778,CHAPTER XXI.,
11779,CHAPTER XXI.,Sheldon paced the floor uneasily during his absence; but he was not kept
11780,CHAPTER XXI.,"long in waiting. He soon heard steps descending the stairs and, whirling"
11781,CHAPTER XXI.,"a chair so as to give him but a side view of the entrance, sat down to"
11782,CHAPTER XXI.,"await their coming. The doors slid open, and he became aware of a light,"
11783,CHAPTER XXI.,"graceful figure, in a dark, crimson robe, leaning on the doctor's arm,"
11784,CHAPTER XXI.,and approaching with fairy-like steps. The setting sun was throwing a
11785,CHAPTER XXI.,"flood of radiance through the heavy folds of purple damask, and filling"
11786,CHAPTER XXI.,"the apartment with soft, dreamy light as they paused before him."
11787,CHAPTER XXI.,
11788,CHAPTER XXI.,"""I have the pleasure of presenting to you 'Woodland Winnie,' Mr."
11789,CHAPTER XXI.,"Sheldon,"" said the doctor."
11790,CHAPTER XXI.,
11791,CHAPTER XXI.,"Sheldon raised his dark eyes slowly to the lady's face, and there, in"
11792,CHAPTER XXI.,"the genial light of that mild spring evening, stood Annie Evalyn. He"
11793,CHAPTER XXI.,started as if an electric shock had shot through his frame. She trembled
11794,CHAPTER XXI.,"and blushed, and the old doctor roared and shook with laughter at"
11795,CHAPTER XXI.,Sheldon's speechless surprise; but the latter soon recovered himself and
11796,CHAPTER XXI.,"greeted Annie with respectful cordiality, offering an apology for his"
11797,CHAPTER XXI.,"surprise, by saying he was not prepared to behold a former acquaintance"
11798,CHAPTER XXI.,"in the fair authoress. She returned his salutations with grace and ease,"
11799,CHAPTER XXI.,while the doctor continued to laugh immoderately. So pleased was the old
11800,CHAPTER XXI.,"gentleman with the part he had enacted in the scene, that he actually"
11801,CHAPTER XXI.,"consumed twelve oranges, and despatched a servant for a fresh supply."
11802,CHAPTER XXI.,Sheldon could not avoid stealing a glance at Annie as she sat on the
11803,CHAPTER XXI.,sofa before him. The dark chestnut curls were lifted away from the
11804,CHAPTER XXI.,"expanding temples, and the delicate marble complexion, relieved by a"
11805,CHAPTER XXI.,just perceptible tinge of rose on either cheek; while the beautifully
11806,CHAPTER XXI.,"imaginative expression of the full blue eye, the curved lip and nostril"
11807,CHAPTER XXI.,"speaking the free, dauntless spirit, and the exquisite contour of the"
11808,CHAPTER XXI.,"light, graceful figure, yet somewhat taller and thinner than when he had"
11809,CHAPTER XXI.,"last seen her, all conspired to assure him it was no timid, shrinking"
11810,CHAPTER XXI.,"girl he beheld, but the lofty, talented, accomplished woman. Back came"
11811,CHAPTER XXI.,the old love and admiration ten-fold stronger than ever. The doctor went
11812,CHAPTER XXI.,out to look after his oranges. There was a silence. It was growing
11813,CHAPTER XXI.,oppressive. He rose and approached the sofa.
11814,CHAPTER XXI.,
11815,CHAPTER XXI.,"""I have erred, Annie,"" he said, in a low, mellow tone, fraught with deep"
11816,CHAPTER XXI.,sorrow and contrition.
11817,CHAPTER XXI.,
11818,CHAPTER XXI.,"""We are human, Frank,"" she answered, very softly."
11819,CHAPTER XXI.,
11820,CHAPTER XXI.,"It was not the words, but the tone, the manner, that convinced him he"

11822,CHAPTER XXI.,"twilight of that spring evening, what a holy happiness was rising over"
11823,CHAPTER XXI.,"the ruins of wickedness and crime! Who shall say how much holier, purer,"
11824,CHAPTER XXI.,and more elevated for the trying ordeal to which it had been subjected?

11893,CHAPTER XXII.,
11894,CHAPTER XXII.,"The old woman laughed and cried by turns, and said, ""'Twas not much use"

11897,CHAPTER XXII.,
11898,CHAPTER XXII.,George and Netta stopped awhile to chat upon the expected arrival. Netta
11899,CHAPTER XXII.,"said, ""The young couple could live in the beautiful stone mansion George"
11900,CHAPTER XXII.,"had just completed, and which was now wanting a family. It was built in"
11901,CHAPTER XXII.,"Gothic style, and most romantically situated, only a little distance"
11902,CHAPTER XXII.,"from the Parsonage, in a delightful grove of maples and elms. She had"
11903,CHAPTER XXII.,"been wondering who would occupy it, but never dreamed it might be Annie"
11904,CHAPTER XXII.,"and her noble husband."""
11905,CHAPTER XXII.,
11906,CHAPTER XXII.,Thus they talked and planned; Aunt Patty all the while half wild with
11907,CHAPTER XXII.,"excitement and expectation. At length they took leave, Netta promising"

11912,CHAPTER XXII.,"Onward they came, on the wings of the flying steam-steed. Onward they"
11913,CHAPTER XXII.,"came, a happy trio; the good old doctor, boisterous in his glee and"
11914,CHAPTER XXII.,"satisfaction, looking first on Annie, then on Sheldon, and bursting"
11915,CHAPTER XXII.,again and again into peals of exuberant laughter; so wonderfully pleased
11916,CHAPTER XXII.,was he with the success of his first attempt at match-making; for he
11917,CHAPTER XXII.,appropriated to himself the whole glory of cementing the union between
11918,CHAPTER XXII.,his two favorites. The only thing that caused anxiety or solicitude
11919,CHAPTER XXII.,"during their journey was a fear lest the good old gentleman, in his wild"
11920,CHAPTER XXII.,"abandonment of joy, should forget himself, and eat so many oranges as to"
11921,CHAPTER XXII.,"endanger his precious existence. But, happily, their fears proved"
11922,CHAPTER XXII.,"imaginary. No such catastrophe occurred to mar their felicity, and the"
11923,CHAPTER XXII.,"little party safely reached the hospitable mansion of Parson Grey, and"
11924,CHAPTER XXII.,were received with every demonstration of joy and welcome by the
11925,CHAPTER XXII.,"expectant inmates. Aunt Rachel was in her highest cap, and soon"
11926,CHAPTER XXII.,"commenced preparations for the bridal supper, on which she had expended"
11927,CHAPTER XXII.,"her utmost, and expected to derive much commendation therefrom; but now,"
11928,CHAPTER XXII.,"Annie, little whimsie! overturned all her hopes at once. She had set her"
11929,CHAPTER XXII.,heart on eating her bridal supper with Aunt Patty at the rock cottage in
11930,CHAPTER XXII.,"Scraggiewood, and Sheldon declared it _his_ wish too."
11931,CHAPTER XXII.,
11932,CHAPTER XXII.,Parson Grey was of opinion the young couple should be left to act their
11933,CHAPTER XXII.,"own pleasure in the matter, and all finally coincided; Aunt Rachel with"
11934,CHAPTER XXII.,"some disappointed looks, that Aunt Patty's oaten cakes should gain the"
11935,CHAPTER XXII.,"preference to her rich, frosted loaves; but she reflected that her"
11936,CHAPTER XXII.,sumptuous banquet could be displayed and partaken of some other day; and
11937,CHAPTER XXII.,so she smoothed her brow and joined the rest in wishing Frank and Annie
11938,CHAPTER XXII.,a pleasant walk to Scraggiewood.
11939,CHAPTER XXII.,
11940,CHAPTER XXII.,"As evening closed in, the happy couple, arm in arm, and unattended, took"
11941,CHAPTER XXII.,their way over the rough forest path. Annie had so much to tell of her
11942,CHAPTER XXII.,"early years passed there, and he was so intent on listening, that they"
11943,CHAPTER XXII.,"were close upon the cottage, ere they seemed to have passed over one"
11944,CHAPTER XXII.,half the distance.
11945,CHAPTER XXII.,
11946,CHAPTER XXII.,"""What a wild, weird spot!"" he exclaimed. ""No wonder you have such"
11947,CHAPTER XXII.,"glorious fancies, love."""
11948,CHAPTER XXII.,
11949,CHAPTER XXII.,Annie motioned him to be silent; she had caught a glimpse of her aunt
11950,CHAPTER XXII.,sitting in the porch.
11951,CHAPTER XXII.,
11952,CHAPTER XXII.,"""Come quick,"" she said, and in a moment they stood before the startled"
11953,CHAPTER XXII.,"old lady. Annie flung her arm over her neck and said: ""Here's Annie and"
11954,CHAPTER XXII.,her husband come to Scraggiewood to take their bridal supper with their
11955,CHAPTER XXII.,"dear aunty."""
11956,CHAPTER XXII.,
11957,CHAPTER XXII.,"The old lady returned her darling's embrace warmly, but looked rather"
11958,CHAPTER XXII.,abashed and disconcerted at beholding so fine a gentleman; but when he
11959,CHAPTER XXII.,"advanced and shook her heartily by the hand, expressing in eloquent"
11960,CHAPTER XXII.,words his gratitude to her for rearing so bright a flower to bless his
11961,CHAPTER XXII.,"life, she gradually regained her composure; and with the young couple"
11962,CHAPTER XXII.,"roaming round the hut, out under the trees, and away into the woods in"
11963,CHAPTER XXII.,"the clear moonlight to search up Crummie, for Annie said, ""Frank must"
11964,CHAPTER XXII.,"become acquainted with all her friends,""--the joyful dame set about"
11965,CHAPTER XXII.,preparing a repast. She managed to get on her new gown and cap while
11966,CHAPTER XXII.,"they were out, for their sudden arrival had surprised her in her"
11967,CHAPTER XXII.,homespun garb. Annie noticed the change soon as they were seated at the
11968,CHAPTER XXII.,"table, and, though Aunt Patty thought she needn't, remarked upon it at"
11969,CHAPTER XXII.,once.
11970,CHAPTER XXII.,
11971,CHAPTER XXII.,"""When did you find time to make that fine toilet, aunty?"" she asked in a"
11972,CHAPTER XXII.,roguish tone.
11973,CHAPTER XXII.,
11974,CHAPTER XXII.,"But Aunt Patty turned the point well. ""Why, dear, seeing you were so"
11975,CHAPTER XXII.,particular in your letter that I should spruce up to receive you and
11976,CHAPTER XXII.,"your husband, I thought I could do no less than respect your wishes."""
11977,CHAPTER XXII.,
11978,CHAPTER XXII.,"""Ha! ha!"" laughed Sheldon; ""you are well answered for your pleasantry,"
11979,CHAPTER XXII.,"Annie."""
11980,CHAPTER XXII.,
11981,CHAPTER XXII.,Thus they discussed their simple meal with mirth and good-humor. Aunt
11982,CHAPTER XXII.,"Patty's batter cakes seemed to have received an extra fine touch, and"
11983,CHAPTER XXII.,"the cream and butter were such as a king might relish, Sheldon declared."
11984,CHAPTER XXII.,
11985,CHAPTER XXII.,"When the meal was over they sat down on the stile, Aunt Patty, at"
11986,CHAPTER XXII.,"Annie's request, drawing her chair close beside them. Then they talked,"
11987,CHAPTER XXII.,and told her how much they anticipated living in the great mansion so
11988,CHAPTER XXII.,near to Parson Grey; and they would come every week to see her; and a
11989,CHAPTER XXII.,"hundred other fine plans Annie formed, laying her head all the while on"
11990,CHAPTER XXII.,"her husband's arm, as he twined wild flowers among her dark curls, and"
11991,CHAPTER XXII.,laughed at her lively sallies. Aunt Patty declared 'twas a sight angels
11992,CHAPTER XXII.,"might envy, their love and happiness."
11993,CHAPTER XXII.,
11994,CHAPTER XXII.,"The moon rose high above the tall forest trees, casting a mild, holy"

12433,CHAPTER III.,"frenzy for the nerve-reviver, and applied it to the trembling lady's"

12593,CHAPTER IV.,

12597,CHAPTER IV.,
12598,CHAPTER IV.,"The poor woman shook her head. Winnie came, and, putting her little arms"

12601,CHAPTER IV.,"""Winnie! Winnie! you worry mother doing so,"" said Wayland, drawing her"

12608,CHAPTER IV.,"They were soon found, and after admiring and caressing them a few"
12609,CHAPTER IV.,"moments, Wayland left his sister to frolic with them on the lawn, and"
12610,CHAPTER IV.,returned to his mother's side.
12611,CHAPTER IV.,
12612,CHAPTER IV.,"They had a long, confidential conversation, in which the son imparted to"
12613,CHAPTER IV.,his affectionate parent a brief history of the past eight months. She
12614,CHAPTER IV.,listened with eager interest to the rehearsal. When he mentioned Alice
12615,CHAPTER IV.,"Orville, she regarded his countenance with a fixed, searching"
12616,CHAPTER IV.,"expression, and a faint smile stole over her pale, sad face; but when he"
12617,CHAPTER IV.,"breathed the name of Camford, she started convulsively, and demanded his"

12626,CHAPTER IV.,"by temporal misfortunes too great for his delicate, sensitive"
12627,CHAPTER IV.,temperament to endure. The sudden descent from affluence to poverty bore
12628,CHAPTER IV.,"him to the grave. And I have told you, Wayland, that by the hand of one"

12638,CHAPTER IV.,
12639,CHAPTER IV.,"""Stop, my boy,"" said his mother; ""I intended this revelation but as a"

13298,CHAPTER VIII.,
13299,CHAPTER VIII.,"""All I know is, I found you here asleep when I came aboard, and here you"
13300,CHAPTER VIII.,"have been asleep for the last three days, wearing off the effects of"

13303,CHAPTER VIII.,
13304,CHAPTER VIII.,"""But, Jack Camford! I cannot go to Australia,"" said Gilbert, still half"
13305,CHAPTER VIII.,confounded.
13306,CHAPTER VIII.,
13307,CHAPTER VIII.,"""How are you going to avoid it?"" asked Jack, laughing."
13308,CHAPTER VIII.,
13309,CHAPTER VIII.,"""True! but what will my bride say? Here I hold her fortune in my hand."""

13316,CHAPTER VIII.,"""Neither do I, very well,"" answered Jack; ""but when folks can't do as"

13318,CHAPTER VIII.,
13319,CHAPTER VIII.,Thus we leave our Australian adventurers and return to the land from
13320,CHAPTER VIII.,which they are so rapidly receding. We didn't know what else to do here
13321,CHAPTER VIII.,"in the eighth chapter, reader, unless we capped the climax, cleared the"
13322,CHAPTER VIII.,"stage, and scattered the characters; for we were quite as tired of them"

13325,CHAPTER VIII.,"A few people think ""Effie Afton"" can tell stories tolerably well. But"
13326,CHAPTER VIII.,"she can't, reader! We speak candidly, for we know ""a heap"" more about"
13327,CHAPTER VIII.,her than you do. There may be those in the wide world who hug themselves
13328,CHAPTER VIII.,in the belief that she can tell _little_ fibs and _large_ fibs pretty
13329,CHAPTER VIII.,"flippantly. Well, let them continue thus to believe, if they choose! We"
13330,CHAPTER VIII.,"shall not pause to say ay, yes, or nay; and we also entertain a private"
13331,CHAPTER VIII.,"opinion, now publicly expressed, that there are people within the"
13332,CHAPTER VIII.,limited circle of our acquaintance who can not only give utterance to
13333,CHAPTER VIII.,"_little_ and _large_ fibs, but make their whole lives and actions play"
13334,CHAPTER VIII.,"the lie to their thoughts and feelings. But as to ""Effie's"" telling long"
13335,CHAPTER VIII.,"magazine tales,--pshaw! she is the most unsystematic creature in the"
13336,CHAPTER VIII.,"world. She just humps down in a big rocking-chair, with one sort of"
13337,CHAPTER VIII.,"_foolscap_ in her _hand_, and another sort on her _head_, with an old"
13338,CHAPTER VIII.,"music-book to lay the sheets on, a lead-pencil for a pen, and thus"
13339,CHAPTER VIII.,"equipped, writes chapter one, and dashes _in medias res_ at once,"
13340,CHAPTER VIII.,"without an idea as to how, where, or when the story thus commenced is to"
13341,CHAPTER VIII.,"find its terminus or end. This is the way she does, reader; for we have"
13342,CHAPTER VIII.,"seen her time and again. Well, she scratches on ""like mad"" till her old"
13343,CHAPTER VIII.,"lead-pencil is ""used up."" Then she sharpens the point, and rushes on"
13344,CHAPTER VIII.,"wilder than before. She don't eat much, and if any one calls her to"
13345,CHAPTER VIII.,"dinner, never heeds them; but when she conceives herself arrived at a"
13346,CHAPTER VIII.,"suitable stopping-place, drops her paper, runs to the pantry, snatches a"
13347,CHAPTER VIII.,"piece of gingerbread, and back to her scribbling again, munching it as"
13348,CHAPTER VIII.,she writes.
13349,CHAPTER VIII.,
13350,CHAPTER VIII.,"This is precisely the way she brings her ""stories"" into existence; but,"
13351,CHAPTER VIII.,"lest we write her out of favor too rapidly, we'll leave the subject, and"

13370,CHAPTER IX.,"heaven, their little throats almost bursting with thrilling melody, and"

13379,CHAPTER IX.,wakening from their death-like slumber to breathe response to the
13380,CHAPTER IX.,thousand tones in sea and air that called so loudly on them to arouse
13381,CHAPTER IX.,"once more to life and action, it will ever be most truly dear. And when"
13382,CHAPTER IX.,"again life's fetters clog with the ice and snow of those frigid lands,"
13383,CHAPTER IX.,"we'll long to fly again to those climes of song and sunny ray, and"
13384,CHAPTER IX.,forget earth's cankering cares in the contemplation of Nature's

13660,CHAPTER XI.,"thought it meant something. Now I remember, Fred. was at the last sewing"
13661,CHAPTER XI.,"circle and walked home with Alice. I thought strange of it then, for it"
13662,CHAPTER XI.,"was hardly a dozen yards to her house, and some of us young ladies had"
13663,CHAPTER XI.,"to walk five times as far all alone. Who told you of the engagement?"""
13664,CHAPTER XI.,
13665,CHAPTER XI.,"""La, I can't remember now!"" said Mrs. Fleetfoot; ""but I've heard of it"
13666,CHAPTER XI.,"ever so many times."""
13667,CHAPTER XI.,
13668,CHAPTER XI.,"""Well, they'll make a pretty couple enough,"" observed Mrs. Sykes;"
13669,CHAPTER XI.,"""though I rather fancied Alice was engaged to somebody off south, 'cause"

13676,CHAPTER XI.,
13677,CHAPTER XI.,"""I don't know; I never put much confidence in flying stories,"" remarked"
13678,CHAPTER XI.,Jerusha.

13686,CHAPTER XI.,"""Our sentiments, exactly!"" exclaimed the other two ladies in concert."
13687,CHAPTER XI.,
13688,CHAPTER XI.,"Hannah now entered and announced tea, and the trio of scrupulous,"
13689,CHAPTER XI.,conscientious ladies repaired to the dining-room to luxuriate on short
13690,CHAPTER XI.,rolls and Mrs. Frye's neighborly doughnuts.
13691,CHAPTER XI.,
13692,CHAPTER XI.,"Mrs. Orville had a pleasant residence on the lake shore, and everything"
13693,CHAPTER XI.,"wore a brighter aspect in the eyes of the mother, since her beloved"
13694,CHAPTER XI.,daughter had returned to enliven the old home by her sunshiny presence.
13695,CHAPTER XI.,But Alice had passed from the gay-hearted child to the thoughtful woman
13696,CHAPTER XI.,"in the two years she had been away, and there was a mild, pensive light"
13697,CHAPTER XI.,"in her dark eye that spoke of a chastened spirit within. Still, she was"
13698,CHAPTER XI.,"usually cheerful, and always, even in her most melancholy hours, an"
13699,CHAPTER XI.,"agreeable companion. Beautiful in person, highly educated and"
13700,CHAPTER XI.,"accomplished, her conversation, whether tinged with sadness or enlivened"
13701,CHAPTER XI.,"by wit and humor, exercised a strange, fascinating power over her"
13702,CHAPTER XI.,listeners.
13703,CHAPTER XI.,
13704,CHAPTER XI.,Alice had left New Orleans with the expectation of having her cousin
13705,CHAPTER XI.,Josephine spend the ensuing winter with her at the north; but shortly
13706,CHAPTER XI.,after her arrival home a letter from her cousin informed her of their
13707,CHAPTER XI.,"fallen fortunes, and proposed emigration to Texas. As Alice knew not to"
13708,CHAPTER XI.,"what part of that State to direct a reply, all further correspondence"
13709,CHAPTER XI.,"was broken off between the parties. From Wayland Morris she never heard,"
13710,CHAPTER XI.,"and knew naught concerning him, save by occasional articles from his pen"
13711,CHAPTER XI.,"in southern journals, which were noticed with commendation and applause."
13712,CHAPTER XI.,"She tried hard to forget him; ""for it is not right,"" she said, ""to waste"
13713,CHAPTER XI.,my life and health on one who never thinks of me. But why did he awaken
13714,CHAPTER XI.,"a hope in my breast that he loved me, if that hope was to be withdrawn"
13715,CHAPTER XI.,"as soon as it became necessary to my happiness?"""
13716,CHAPTER XI.,
13717,CHAPTER XI.,"""Alice, Alice!"" exclaimed Mrs. Orville, as the fair girl stood in the"

13719,CHAPTER XI.,"Milder is coming through the gate; will you go out to receive him?"""
13720,CHAPTER XI.,
13721,CHAPTER XI.,"Alice roused from her reverie, and saying ""Yes, mother,"" very quietly,"
13722,CHAPTER XI.,hastened through the hall to meet her visitor.
13723,CHAPTER XI.,
13724,CHAPTER XI.,"""Good-evening, Mr. Milder!"" said she, with a graceful courtesy. ""Come"
13725,CHAPTER XI.,into the parlor. I have been laying the sin of ungallantry upon you for
13726,CHAPTER XI.,"the last three days."""
13727,CHAPTER XI.,
13728,CHAPTER XI.,"""It is the last charge I would have expected preferred against me by"

13730,CHAPTER XI.,
13731,CHAPTER XI.,"""What other would you sooner have expected?"" she inquired, looping up"
13732,CHAPTER XI.,the snowy muslin curtains to admit the parting sunbeams.
13733,CHAPTER XI.,
13734,CHAPTER XI.,"""One I would have dreaded far more to hear,--that of being too assiduous"
13735,CHAPTER XI.,"in my attendance,"" returned he, in a low tone."
13736,CHAPTER XI.,
13737,CHAPTER XI.,"Alice answered by changing the conversation, and, after an hour passed"
13738,CHAPTER XI.,"in pleasant chit-chat, Fred. proposed a stroll on the lake shore. Alice"
13739,CHAPTER XI.,"was soon ready, and they sallied forth. The weather was delightful, and"
13740,CHAPTER XI.,that walk along Erie's sounding shores was fraught with a life-interest
13741,CHAPTER XI.,"to one, and regretful sorrow to both."
13742,CHAPTER XI.,
13743,CHAPTER XI.,"""I am going to Texas, Alice!"" said Milder, as they reäpproached the"
13744,CHAPTER XI.,mansion of Mrs. Orville.
13745,CHAPTER XI.,
13746,CHAPTER XI.,"""O, that you might find my cousin Josephine there, who is so good and"
13747,CHAPTER XI.,"beautiful!"" remarked Alice."
13748,CHAPTER XI.,
13749,CHAPTER XI.,"""Would I might, if it would afford you a moment's pleasure,"" he"
13750,CHAPTER XI.,"answered, in a dejected tone."
13751,CHAPTER XI.,
13752,CHAPTER XI.,"""If you do, pray give her my love, and entreat her to write and inform"
13753,CHAPTER XI.,"me of her welfare,"" said Alice, earnestly."
13754,CHAPTER XI.,
13755,CHAPTER XI.,"""I shall be highly gratified to execute your commission,"" he answered;"
13756,CHAPTER XI.,"""and now, good-by, Alice! May you be as happy as you deserve!"""
13757,CHAPTER XI.,
13758,CHAPTER XI.,"""And may you, also, Fred.!"" said Alice, with tears in her eyes. One"
13759,CHAPTER XI.,"lingering pressure of the hand, and he was gone."
13760,CHAPTER XI.,
13761,CHAPTER XI.,"""Noble heart!"" exclaimed Alice; ""why could I not love him? Alas! a"
13762,CHAPTER XI.,"tyrant grasp is on my soul, which, while it delights to hold me in its"
13763,CHAPTER XI.,"toils, and tantalize and torment, will not love me, or let me love"
13764,CHAPTER XI.,"another!"""
13765,CHAPTER XI.,
13766,CHAPTER XI.,"""Alice!"" said a voice within."
13767,CHAPTER XI.,
13768,CHAPTER XI.,"""Yes, mother, I'm coming,"" replied the daughter, entering the hall with"
13769,CHAPTER XI.,"a languid step, and proceeding to divest herself of shawl and bonnet."
13770,CHAPTER XI.,
13771,CHAPTER XI.,"""You have had a long stroll and look fatigued,"" remarked the fond"
13772,CHAPTER XI.,"parent, noticing her daughter's flushed cheeks and hurried respiration,"

13774,CHAPTER XI.,"Where is Fred.?"""
13775,CHAPTER XI.,

13778,CHAPTER XI.,"""Why did he not come in and rest a while?"""
13779,CHAPTER XI.,

13783,CHAPTER XI.,
13784,CHAPTER XI.,"""No, mother; he is going to Texas."""
13785,CHAPTER XI.,
13786,CHAPTER XI.,"""Indeed! How long has he entertained that idea?"" asked Mrs. Orville in a"
13787,CHAPTER XI.,tone of astonishment.
13788,CHAPTER XI.,
13789,CHAPTER XI.,"""Not long, I fancy. I told him to find cousin Josephine and entreat her"
13790,CHAPTER XI.,"to write to me,"" said Alice, fanning her face with a great, flapping"
13791,CHAPTER XI.,feather fan.
13792,CHAPTER XI.,
13793,CHAPTER XI.,"""I hope he may do so; and much do I wish your cousin might be here to"
13794,CHAPTER XI.,"pass the winter, for I fear you will be lonely without some companion of"
13795,CHAPTER XI.,"your own age,"" said Mrs. Orville, attentively regarding her daughter."
13796,CHAPTER XI.,
13797,CHAPTER XI.,"""O, never fear for me, mother!"" returned Alice. ""I assure you I have"
13798,CHAPTER XI.,ample resources for enjoyment in my own breast. They only need occasion
13799,CHAPTER XI.,"to be called forth and put in exercise."""
13800,CHAPTER XI.,
13801,CHAPTER XI.,"""I hope it may prove thus,"" responded the tender mother. ""Let us now"
13802,CHAPTER XI.,"retire to our pleasant chamber, and I will do myself the pleasure of"

13804,CHAPTER XI.,"sing a sacred hymn."""
13805,CHAPTER XI.,
13806,CHAPTER XI.,Thus mother and daughter retired; and while the old heart that had
13807,CHAPTER XI.,"passed beyond the youth-life of love and passion, rested calmly in its"
13808,CHAPTER XI.,"tranquil sleep, the young heart by its side throbbed wildly, trembled,"
13809,CHAPTER XI.,"wept and sighed; tossing restlessly on its pillow, haunted by ill-omened"
13810,CHAPTER XI.,dreams and ghastly phantom-shapes too hideous for reality. For there is
13811,CHAPTER XI.,"no rest, or calm, or quiet, for the passion-haunted breast."

13822,CHAPTER XII.,
13823,CHAPTER XII.,"The lively winter season was at its height in New Orleans, and all the"

13825,CHAPTER XII.,"Camfords, her wrought slippers resting on the polished grate in the"
13826,CHAPTER XII.,"elegant parlor, sat a prim maiden lady, arrayed in steel-colored satin."
13827,CHAPTER XII.,An embroidered muslin morning-cap was placed with an air of much
13828,CHAPTER XII.,"precision over her glossy brown _imported_ locks, and the pointed collar"
13829,CHAPTER XII.,around her neck was secured by a plain bow of fawn-colored ribbon.
13830,CHAPTER XII.,
13831,CHAPTER XII.,"Suddenly the door opened, and a gentleman, of fine personal appearance,"

13862,CHAPTER XII.,"pursing up her lips with a stiff, determined expression; ""she is such"

13864,CHAPTER XII.,"topsy-turvy, and makes such a racket and confusion, that I cannot and"
13865,CHAPTER XII.,"_will_ not endure it longer. My mind requires quiet for contemplation."""
13866,CHAPTER XII.,
13867,CHAPTER XII.,"""Why, she seems to me like a sunbeam; like a canary-bird in the house,"

13934,CHAPTER XII.,"As Winnie passed the door of Miss Mary Lester's room to reach her own,"

13938,CHAPTER XII.,forgot her surprise after gaining the privacy of her own apartment.
13939,CHAPTER XII.,Early in the morning she was roused from slumber by a furious knocking
13940,CHAPTER XII.,"on her door. She sprang up and demanded, ""Who is there?"""

13968,CHAPTER XII.,"""Who's there?"" at last exclaimed a voice within."

13997,CHAPTER XII.,
13998,CHAPTER XII.,"Wayland followed Lester up the hall stairs, wondering what this strange"

14001,CHAPTER XII.,"door wide open, and, to appearance, no person had occupied the room the"
14002,CHAPTER XII.,"previous night. Lester's quick eye instantly marked, what the servant in"
14003,CHAPTER XII.,"her fright had failed to notice, the absence of two large trunks that"
14004,CHAPTER XII.,"used to stand beside the bed, and the _presence_ of a small folded"
14005,CHAPTER XII.,"billet on the dressing-table. He advanced with a hasty step, broke the"

14018,CHAPTER XII.,felicity with her adored husband; to which fair land she hopes I'll some
14019,CHAPTER XII.,"day come to visit her, when I have regained possession of my senses, and"

14021,CHAPTER XII.,
14022,CHAPTER XII.,Wayland listened with amazement depicted on his features.

14039,CHAPTER XII.,found her brother and Lester already seated at the table.
14040,CHAPTER XII.,
14041,CHAPTER XII.,"""Good-morning, Miss Morris,"" said the latter. ""A romance, such as we"

14087,CHAPTER XIII.,"Well, Heaven help you then, when you go out south or west, and pitch"

14094,CHAPTER XIII.,"dozen of us in a miserable wagon, when one ""new comer"" asked his"

14096,CHAPTER XIII.,
14097,CHAPTER XIII.,"""They are hog-wallows,"" responded the one interrogated, in a pompous"

14124,CHAPTER XIII.,"the subject and relapsed into silence, while it was evident, from their"
14125,CHAPTER XIII.,"anxious visages, that their minds were harassed and disturbed, by"
14126,CHAPTER XIII.,"visions of hog-wallows, hurricanes and spontaneous animals."
14127,CHAPTER XIII.,
14128,CHAPTER XIII.,We have heard other and more philosophical hypotheses as to the origin
14129,CHAPTER XIII.,"of these uneven roads. Some suppose the country was once an inland sea,"
14130,CHAPTER XIII.,and these ridges were occasioned by the continuous action of the waves;
14131,CHAPTER XIII.,"others suppose the intense heat of the sun on the soft, clayey soil,"
14132,CHAPTER XIII.,"caused it to crack and spread asunder, leaving the surface broken and"
14133,CHAPTER XIII.,"ridgy. This latter is the more generally received opinion, we believe."
14134,CHAPTER XIII.,
14135,CHAPTER XIII.,"Here's half a chapter on hog-wallows, the unpoetical things! but as"

14137,CHAPTER XIII.,"we premise these humpy roads were made for the benefit of gouty men,"
14138,CHAPTER XIII.,"dyspeptic women, and love-sick lads and lasses. Thus disposed of, ""we"
14139,CHAPTER XIII.,"resume the thread of our narrative,"" as novel-writers say. Our pen waxes"

14142,CHAPTER XIII.,"hog-wallows, musquitoes, Camanches and all. Let none dare gainsay Texas"
14143,CHAPTER XIII.,"in our ears, for it is the banner state of all the immaculate"
14144,CHAPTER XIII.,"thirty-one. Come on, reader, now we have had our say, straight up to the"
14145,CHAPTER XIII.,"thriving plantation of Esq. Camford, and behold the wonders this"
14146,CHAPTER XIII.,"wonderful land can produce upon the characters of nervous,"
14147,CHAPTER XIII.,"delicately-constituted ladies. That buxom, blooming-matron in the loose"
14148,CHAPTER XIII.,"gingham wrapper, and muslin morning-cap, who stands on the gallery of"
14149,CHAPTER XIII.,"that new and tastefully-built cottage, all overshaded by the boughs of"
14150,CHAPTER XIII.,"the majestic pecan trees, giving off orders to a brace of shiny-eyed"
14151,CHAPTER XIII.,"mulatto wenches, who listen with reverential awe and attention, is none"
14152,CHAPTER XIII.,"other than the hysterical, shaky-nerved Mrs. Camford, whom we beheld"
14153,CHAPTER XIII.,some two years ago bewailing the fate which had brought her to this
14154,CHAPTER XIII.,"awful place, to be poisoned by snakes, mangled by bears, and murdered by"
14155,CHAPTER XIII.,Indians. Listen to her words:
14156,CHAPTER XIII.,
14157,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Thisbe, take the lunch I have placed in the market-basket down to the"
14158,CHAPTER XIII.,"cotton-field boys, and ask your master to come to the house soon as"
14159,CHAPTER XIII.,"convenient; some people from the States are come to visit us:--and you,"
14160,CHAPTER XIII.,"Hagar, go to the garden and gather a quantity of vegetables for dinner."
14161,CHAPTER XIII.,"I will be in the kitchen to assist in their preparation."""
14162,CHAPTER XIII.,
14163,CHAPTER XIII.,"The women bowed, and hastened away on their separate errands. Mrs."
14164,CHAPTER XIII.,"Camford now turned to enter the house, when Josephine, her cheeks"
14165,CHAPTER XIII.,"blooming with health and happiness, came bounding to her mother's side."
14166,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, mamma, the young gentleman, Mr. Milder, knows all about cousin"
14167,CHAPTER XIII.,Alice! he has come right from the place in which she resides. He says
14168,CHAPTER XIII.,"she sent a great deal of love to us all, and desired me to write to her."
14169,CHAPTER XIII.,"Perhaps, now we know she remembers us so kindly, you will let me go"

14172,CHAPTER XIII.,
14173,CHAPTER XIII.,"All this was uttered in the most lively and animated tone conceivable,"
14174,CHAPTER XIII.,"and Mrs. Camford smiled, and answered cheerfully, as mother and daughter"
14175,CHAPTER XIII.,"reëntered the neat, airy parlor, where our heroine of romance, Miss Mary"
14176,CHAPTER XIII.,"Lester, was sitting beside her portly, red-visaged husband, Col."
14177,CHAPTER XIII.,"Edmunds, who had, in early life, been a Texan ranger, and acquired so"
14178,CHAPTER XIII.,"keen a relish for the wild, exciting scenes of a new country, that he"
14179,CHAPTER XIII.,would not give his hand (his heart we suppose he could not control) to
14180,CHAPTER XIII.,"the fair Mary, unless she would consent to forego the luxuries of"
14181,CHAPTER XIII.,"fashionable life, and follow his fortunes through the perils and"
14182,CHAPTER XIII.,"vicissitudes of an Indian frontier. She stood out to the last, hoping"
14183,CHAPTER XIII.,"the stalwart colonel would yield to her eloquent pleadings, and consent"
14184,CHAPTER XIII.,to make his abode in New Orleans; for she conceived that brother
14185,CHAPTER XIII.,"Augustus, having arrived at the sober age of thirty, would never marry,"
14186,CHAPTER XIII.,and it would be the finest idea in the world for him to relinquish the
14187,CHAPTER XIII.,"splendid estate he had acquired by his own untiring exertions, to the"
14188,CHAPTER XIII.,"hands of Col. Edmunds, while she, as the worthy colonel's most estimable"
14189,CHAPTER XIII.,"consort, would condescend to assume the direction of the servants and"
14190,CHAPTER XIII.,"household affairs, and Augustus could thus live wholly at his ease,"
14191,CHAPTER XIII.,"without a worldly care to distract his breast. What an affectionate,"
14192,CHAPTER XIII.,"self-sacrificing sister would she be, thus kindly to relieve her brother"
14193,CHAPTER XIII.,"at her own expense! But, just as this plan began to ripen for execution,"
14194,CHAPTER XIII.,"she was counter-plotted, or fancied herself to be, which led to the same"
14195,CHAPTER XIII.,"denouement. Winnie Morris came to pass a vacation with her brother,"
14196,CHAPTER XIII.,"Wayland, and the fore-doomed bachelor, Augustus Lester, most audaciously"
14197,CHAPTER XIII.,dared to fall in love with the cackling girl. So Miss Mary declared; and
14198,CHAPTER XIII.,"to remain in her brother's mansion, where she had hitherto exercised"
14199,CHAPTER XIII.,"unlimited sway, under such a little minx of a mistress, was too much for"
14200,CHAPTER XIII.,"human nature to endure; so, all on a sudden, she yielded in full to the"
14201,CHAPTER XIII.,"majestic colonel's wishes, and ""cut sticks"" for Texas, flying, as many"
14202,CHAPTER XIII.,"of us often do, from an imaginary evil, and leaving behind poor little"
14203,CHAPTER XIII.,"Winnie, innocent and unsuspecting as a lamb, with the great coffee-urn"
14204,CHAPTER XIII.,in her trembling hand. How long the fair girl remained thus innocent and
14205,CHAPTER XIII.,"unsuspecting, we are yet to know."
14206,CHAPTER XIII.,
14207,CHAPTER XIII.,"""So you are from New Orleans, Col. Edmunds,"" remarked Mrs. Camford. ""I"
14208,CHAPTER XIII.,do not recollect of ever having met you there; but to see any person
14209,CHAPTER XIII.,"from our former home, though personally strangers, affords us pleasure"
14210,CHAPTER XIII.,"and gratification."""
14211,CHAPTER XIII.,
14212,CHAPTER XIII.,"""I have only resided in New Orleans about six months, madam,"" returned"
14213,CHAPTER XIII.,"Col. Edmunds; ""the most of my life has been spent in camp and field."""
14214,CHAPTER XIII.,
14215,CHAPTER XIII.,"""My husband is a soldier,"" said Mrs. Edmunds, ""and we are now on our way"
14216,CHAPTER XIII.,"to the Indian frontier."""
14217,CHAPTER XIII.,
14218,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Indeed! and how do you think you will relish frontier life?"" asked Mrs."

14221,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, I shall be contented anywhere with my husband!"""
14222,CHAPTER XIII.,

14224,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Always lived in the city, and thought it the greatest piece of audacity"

14226,CHAPTER XIII.,"a private gentleman with whom I was not in the least acquainted, to bait"
14227,CHAPTER XIII.,"my mules and get dinner. Not a bit acquainted with the Texan elephant,"
14228,CHAPTER XIII.,"you see, madam."""
14229,CHAPTER XIII.,
14230,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Heaven save me, Samuel! do people in this country associate with"
14231,CHAPTER XIII.,"elephants?"" exclaimed the bride, with the prettiest display of horrified"
14232,CHAPTER XIII.,surprise.
14233,CHAPTER XIII.,
14234,CHAPTER XIII.,"""To be sure; I had one for a bed-fellow six or eight months when I first"
14235,CHAPTER XIII.,"came out here,"" returned the husband, with perfect serenity."
14236,CHAPTER XIII.,
14237,CHAPTER XIII.,"""O, my soul, I hope I shall never see one!"" said the young wife,"
14238,CHAPTER XIII.,nestling closer to her husband's side.
14239,CHAPTER XIII.,
14240,CHAPTER XIII.,"The colonel laughed heartily, and all joined in his merriment."
14241,CHAPTER XIII.,
14242,CHAPTER XIII.,"""You should not alarm new-comers by such bug-bear tales,"" remarked Mrs."
14243,CHAPTER XIII.,"Camford, at length. ""This young gentleman, Mr. Milder, is just from the"
14244,CHAPTER XIII.,"north."""
14245,CHAPTER XIII.,
14246,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Indeed! well, he looks as if he might soon learn how to grapple with"
14247,CHAPTER XIII.,"elephants and tigers both,"" said the colonel, glancing on the young"
14248,CHAPTER XIII.,man's countenance.
14249,CHAPTER XIII.,
14250,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Tigers!"" exclaimed Mrs. Edmunds, taking fresh alarm; ""do those"
14251,CHAPTER XIII.,"ferocious creatures grow here too?"""
14252,CHAPTER XIII.,
14253,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Yes, everything grows here, Mary, about five times as large as anywhere"
14254,CHAPTER XIII.,"else,"" answered the bluff colonel. ""But what say, young man, to going up"
14255,CHAPTER XIII.,"on the frontier with me, and seeing a bit of soldier life? You'd get to"
14256,CHAPTER XIII.,"see the whole elephant there, teeth, trunk and all."""
14257,CHAPTER XIII.,
14258,CHAPTER XIII.,"""Why will you keep talking about that dreadful monster?"" said the young"
14259,CHAPTER XIII.,"wife, who had brought a few nerves along with her. ""You'll terrify me to"
14260,CHAPTER XIII.,"death, Samuel."""
14261,CHAPTER XIII.,
14262,CHAPTER XIII.,"""You must get used to the critters, Mary, and the quicker the better, is"
14263,CHAPTER XIII.,"all I have to say,"" returned the husband, patting her cheek."
14264,CHAPTER XIII.,
14265,CHAPTER XIII.,"Esquire Camford now entered, dinner was served, and the conversation"
14266,CHAPTER XIII.,"took a higher tone. Esquire C. spoke of the country, its fertility,"
14267,CHAPTER XIII.,"rapid improvement, and exhaustless resources. Fred. Milder began to feel"
14268,CHAPTER XIII.,"an interest in a land with prospects so brilliant, and accepted with"
14269,CHAPTER XIII.,pleasure Col. Edmunds' invitation to travel on westward in company with
14270,CHAPTER XIII.,him. The travellers were persuaded to pass the night; and during the
14271,CHAPTER XIII.,visit Mrs. Camford came to know that Mrs. Edmunds was a sister of the
14272,CHAPTER XIII.,Mr. Lester who had purchased her former sumptuous residence from the
14273,CHAPTER XIII.,"hands of the creditors, at the time of their failure in New Orleans."
14274,CHAPTER XIII.,"Still the knowledge did not waken regretful feelings, or excite a pang"
14275,CHAPTER XIII.,of envy in her breast; for she had learned to regard a cottage with
14276,CHAPTER XIII.,content as better than wealth and pomp with pride and misery to distract
14277,CHAPTER XIII.,the spirit.
14278,CHAPTER XIII.,
14279,CHAPTER XIII.,The morrow dawned beautifully. Round and red the sun arose beyond the
14280,CHAPTER XIII.,"far, green prairie, when the mules and carriages were brought to the"
14281,CHAPTER XIII.,"door, and the little party of travellers recommenced their journey."
14282,CHAPTER XIII.,"Fred. Milder cast a lingering glance after the pretty Josephine, as she"
14283,CHAPTER XIII.,"wished him a delightful tour up the country, and bade him not forget to"
14284,CHAPTER XIII.,call and give her an account of all his adventures on his return. He
14285,CHAPTER XIII.,"promised faithfully not to forget, and, with kind adieus, the party"
14286,CHAPTER XIII.,moved on their way.
14287,CHAPTER XIII.,
14288,CHAPTER XIII.,"Josephine sat down after her usual morning tasks were completed, and"
14289,CHAPTER XIII.,indited a long epistle to her cousin Alice; giving a general description
14290,CHAPTER XIII.,of her Texan home; not failing to mention her mother's happy recovery
14291,CHAPTER XIII.,"from nerves, and Susette's marriage with a promising young planter; also"
14292,CHAPTER XIII.,the pleasant visit they had enjoyed from Mr. Milder; and ended by saying
14293,CHAPTER XIII.,"she hoped another season, when papa was a little richer, to make her"

14315,CHAPTER XIV.,"perhaps--for she has a fashion of rubbing that useful organ, for ideas,"
14316,CHAPTER XIV.,"or something else, we know not what."

14331,CHAPTER XIV.,Were that affectionate sister's misgivings of her bachelor brother's
14332,CHAPTER XIV.,"intentions toward that wild-cat girl altogether chimerical, then?"
14333,CHAPTER XIV.,Present appearances would indicate them not to have been altogether
14334,CHAPTER XIV.,"groundless; but really, when the fair Mary fled so precipitately, the"
14335,CHAPTER XIV.,idea of making Winnie Morris his bride had never entered her brother's
14336,CHAPTER XIV.,"cranium. He had regarded her as a pretty child, and delighted in her"
14337,CHAPTER XIV.,"sunshiny, buoyant spirit, and felt he would like to keep her near to"

14339,CHAPTER XIV.,"with so much quiet dignity and grace at his table, on that eventful"

14364,CHAPTER XIV.,
14365,CHAPTER XIV.,"""I look for a letter from him every day,"" remarked the husband; ""there"
14366,CHAPTER XIV.,was a mail-boat in when I came up to dinner. I'll call at the

14394,CHAPTER XV.,"Sykes, while ever following her, like a shadow, is her bosom friend,"
14395,CHAPTER XV.,Miss Jerusha Sharpwell. Mrs. Fleetfoot also appears in the rear; a sort
14396,CHAPTER XV.,"of shadow of a shade, or refrain to the song. Little Miss Gaddie"

14422,CHAPTER XV.,

14457,CHAPTER XV.,
14458,CHAPTER XV.,"""La, yes!"" responded that Christian lady; ""that's an old story,"

14460,CHAPTER XV.,
14461,CHAPTER XV.,"""Why, I never heard of it before,"" said Miss Jerusha, pinning a little"
14462,CHAPTER XV.,"blue bow on the top of the muslin cap, to make it look _tasty_, as she"
14463,CHAPTER XV.,observed.
14464,CHAPTER XV.,
14465,CHAPTER XV.,"""Neither did I,"" answered Mrs. Sykes, casting, as we thought, but it"

14477,CHAPTER XV.,"her so mopish at times."""
14478,CHAPTER XV.,
14479,CHAPTER XV.,"""Perhaps it is as sister Fleetfoot says,"" observed Jerusha; ""for Alice"
14480,CHAPTER XV.,is certainly changed from what she used to be. She never attends our

14482,CHAPTER XV.,"time?"""
14483,CHAPTER XV.,
14484,CHAPTER XV.,"""'Tis more than I can tell,"" answered Mrs. Sykes; ""there was always"

14493,CHAPTER XV.,"""Pray, do, sister Sharpwell; I need all the aid and sympathy of"

14496,CHAPTER XV.,
14497,CHAPTER XV.,The meeting progressed. Fast flew the nimble fingers of the devoted
14498,CHAPTER XV.,laborers in the good cause; and could the poor heathen have known what
14499,CHAPTER XV.,"mighty exertions this band of benevolent, self-denying females, who"
14500,CHAPTER XV.,"basked in the noontide glory of the sun of righteousness, were making"
14501,CHAPTER XV.,"for their liberation from the thrall of pagan darkness and superstition,"
14502,CHAPTER XV.,we doubt not that they would have prostrated themselves by millions
14503,CHAPTER XV.,"before the shrine of their great idol, Juggernaut, and devoutly invoked"
14504,CHAPTER XV.,"him to pardon and forgive the poor, deluded victims of a false religion,"
14505,CHAPTER XV.,and bring them all under his sublime sway and holy dominion.
14506,CHAPTER XV.,
14507,CHAPTER XV.,"At length, Miss Gaddie was called on to sing the parting hymn. The lady"
14508,CHAPTER XV.,"president delivered herself of a most eloquent and oratorical harangue,"
14509,CHAPTER XV.,"during which the benevolent rose to a tremendous pitch, which nothing"
14510,CHAPTER XV.,could calm off but the call to supper.
14511,CHAPTER XV.,
14512,CHAPTER XV.,"This well-furnished meal dispensed, the ""Ladies' Literary Benevolent"

14515,CHAPTER XV.,"was aghast with terror and dismay, when she learned this batch of"
14516,CHAPTER XV.,benevolence was assigned over to her for its next meeting.
14517,CHAPTER XV.,
14518,CHAPTER XV.,"""O, mercy!"" she feelingly exclaimed; ""and I've no girl to assist me, and"
14519,CHAPTER XV.,"my house will be turned topsy-turvy, new parlor carpet ruined,--and,"
14520,CHAPTER XV.,"besides, they'll eat us out of house and home, and Mr. Sykes is _so_"

14522,CHAPTER XV.,

15503,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,What shifting scenes have been thine to pass through!
15504,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,
15505,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"I raised my eyes to the calm, blue sky,"
15506,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,There sailed my bonnet serene and high!
15507,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"O, what a feeling of hopeless woe"
15508,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"Stole over me then, no heart may know!"
15509,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"My bonnet of blue, my bonnet of blue,"
15510,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,As clear as the sky was thy azure hue!
15511,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,
15512,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"'Twas vain to mourn for my bonnet, and yet"
15513,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,It taught me a lesson I shall not forget;
15514,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"'Twas, never to make you an idol of clay,"
15515,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,For when you best love them they'll fly away.
15516,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"My bonnet of blue, my bonnet of blue,"
15517,MY BONNET OF BLUE.,"I loved thee well, but thou wert untrue!"

15522,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.
15523,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15524,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15525,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,When the frost-king clothed the forests
15526,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"In a flood of gorgeous dyes,"
15527,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Death called little dark-browed Martha
15528,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,To her mansion in the skies.
15529,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,'Twas a calm October Sabbath
15530,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,When the bell with solemn sound
15531,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Knelled her to her quiet slumbers
15532,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Low down in the darksome ground.
15533,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15534,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Far away, where sun and summer"
15535,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Reign in glory all the year,"
15536,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Was the land she left behind her,"
15537,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,To her simple heart so dear.
15538,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"There a mother and a brother,"
15539,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Meeting oft at close of day,"
15540,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Spoke in tender, tearful whispers"
15541,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Of the loved one far away.
15542,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15543,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""I am thinking,"" said the mother,"
15544,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""How much Martha'll get to know,"
15545,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"And how smart and bright 'twill make her,"
15546,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Travellin' round the country so.
15547,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"'Spect she'll be a mighty lady,"
15548,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Shinin' jewels in her ears;
15549,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"But I hope she won't forget us,--"
15550,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Dat is what dis poor heart fears."""
15551,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15552,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""'Deed she won't,"" then spoke the brother,"
15553,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""Martha'll love us just as well"
15554,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"As before she parted from us,--"
15555,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Trust me, mammy, I can tell."""
15556,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Then he passed a hand in silence
15557,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"O'er his damp and swarthy brow,"
15558,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Brushed a tear from off the eyelid,--"
15559,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""O that she were with us now!"""
15560,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15561,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""Pshaw! don't cry, Lem,"" said the mother,"
15562,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"""There's no need of that at all;"
15563,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Massa said he'd bring her to us
15564,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,When the nuts began to fall.
15565,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,The pecans will soon be rattling
15566,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"From the tall plantation trees,"
15567,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"She'll be here to help us pick them,"
15568,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Brisk and merry as you please."""
15569,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15570,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Thus they talked, while she they waited"
15571,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,From the earth had passed away;
15572,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Walked no more in pleasant places,"
15573,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Saw no more the light of day;
15574,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Knew no more of toilsome labor,"
15575,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Spiteful threats or angry blows;
15576,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,For the Heavenly One had called her
15577,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Early from a life of woes.
15578,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15579,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Folded we the tiny fingers
15580,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"On the cold, unmoving breast;"
15581,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Robed her in a decent garment,"
15582,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,For her long and dreamless rest;
15583,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,And when o'er the tranquil Sabbath
15584,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Evening's rays began to fall,"
15585,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Followed her with heavy footsteps
15586,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,To the home that waits us all.
15587,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15588,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"As we paused beside the churchyard,"
15589,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Where the tall green maples rise,"
15590,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Strangers came and viewed the sleeper,"
15591,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,With sad wonder in their eyes;
15592,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"While my thoughts flew to that mother,"
15593,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,And that brother far away:
15594,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"How they'd weep and wail, if conscious"
15595,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,This was Martha's burial day!
15596,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15597,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,When the coffin had been lowered
15598,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Carefully into the ground,"
15599,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,And the heavy sods fell on it
15600,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"With a cold and hollow sound,"
15601,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"Thought I, as we hastened homewards,"
15602,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,"By the day's expiring light,"
15603,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,Martha never slept so sweetly
15604,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,As she'll sleep this Sabbath night.
15605,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
15606,DARK-BROWED MARTHA.,
