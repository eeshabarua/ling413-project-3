3359,XXIV,"Not yet, my soul, these friendly fields desert,"
3360,XXIV,"Where thou with grass, and rivers, and the breeze,"
3361,XXIV,"And the bright face of day, thy dalliance hadst;"
3362,XXIV,Where to thine ear first sang the enraptured birds;
3363,XXIV,Where love and thou that lasting bargain made.
3364,XXIV,"The ship rides trimmed, and from the eternal shore"
3365,XXIV,Thou hearest airy voices; but not yet
3366,XXIV,"Depart, my soul, not yet a while depart."
3367,XXIV,
3368,XXIV,"Freedom is far, rest far. Thou art with life"
3369,XXIV,"Too closely woven, nerve with nerve entwined;"
3370,XXIV,"Service still craving service, love for love,"
3371,XXIV,"Love for dear love, still suppliant with tears."
3372,XXIV,"Alas, not yet thy human task is done!"
3373,XXIV,A bond at birth is forged; a debt doth lie
3374,XXIV,Immortal on mortality. It grows--
3375,XXIV,"By vast rebound it grows, unceasing growth;"
3376,XXIV,"Gift upon gift, alms upon alms, upreared,"
3377,XXIV,"From man, from God, from nature, till the soul"
3378,XXIV,At that so huge indulgence stands amazed.
3379,XXIV,
3380,XXIV,"Leave not, my soul, the unfoughten field, nor leave"
3381,XXIV,"Thy debts dishonoured, nor thy place desert"
3382,XXIV,"Without due service rendered. For thy life,"
3383,XXIV,"Up, spirit, and defend that fort of clay,"
3384,XXIV,"Thy body, now beleaguered; whether soon"
3385,XXIV,Or late she fall; whether to-day thy friends
3386,XXIV,"Bewail thee dead, or, after years, a man"
3387,XXIV,Grown old in honour and the friend of peace.
3388,XXIV,"Contend, my soul, for moments and for hours;"
3389,XXIV,Each is with service pregnant; each reclaimed
3390,XXIV,"Is as a kingdom conquered, where to reign."
3391,XXIV,
3392,XXIV,As when a captain rallies to the fight
3393,XXIV,"His scattered legions, and beats ruin back,"
3394,XXIV,"He, on the field, encamps, well pleased in mind."
3395,XXIV,"Yet surely him shall fortune overtake,"
3396,XXIV,"Him smite in turn, headlong his ensigns drive;"
3397,XXIV,"And that dear land, now safe, to-morrow fall."

3407,XXV,"Shall to your bosom creep,"
3408,XXV,Though nevermore again you watch your baby sleep.
3409,XXV,
3410,XXV,"Though in the greener paths of earth,"
3411,XXV,"Mother and child, no more"
3412,XXV,We wander; and no more the birth
3413,XXV,Of me whom once you bore
3414,XXV,Seems still the brave reward that once it seemed of yore;
3415,XXV,
3416,XXV,"Though as all passes, day and night,"
3417,XXV,"The seasons and the years,"
3418,XXV,"From you, O mother, this delight,"
3419,XXV,This also disappears--
3420,XXV,Some profit yet survives of all your pangs and tears.
3421,XXV,
3422,XXV,"The child, the seed, the grain of corn,"
3423,XXV,"The acorn on the hill,"
3424,XXV,Each for some separate end is born
3425,XXV,"In season fit, and still"
3426,XXV,Each must in strength arise to work the almighty will.
3427,XXV,
3428,XXV,"So from the hearth the children flee,"
3429,XXV,By that almighty hand
3430,XXV,Austerely led; so one by sea
3431,XXV,"Goes forth, and one by land;"
3432,XXV,Nor aught of all man's sons escapes from that command.
3433,XXV,
3434,XXV,So from the sally each obeys
3435,XXV,The unseen almighty nod;
3436,XXV,So till the ending all their ways
3437,XXV,Blindfolded loth have trod:
3438,XXV,"Nor knew their task at all, but were the tools of God."
3439,XXV,
3440,XXV,And as the fervent smith of yore
3441,XXV,"Beat out the glowing blade,"
3442,XXV,Nor wielded in the front of war
3443,XXV,"The weapons that he made,"
3444,XXV,But in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade;
3445,XXV,
3446,XXV,So like a sword the son shall roam
3447,XXV,On nobler missions sent;
3448,XXV,And as the smith remained at home
3449,XXV,"In peaceful turret pent,"

3759,NOTE TO BOOK II,The human conscience has fled of late the troublesome domain of conduct
3760,NOTE TO BOOK II,for what I should have supposed to be the less congenial field of art:
3761,NOTE TO BOOK II,"there she may now be said to rage, and with special severity in all that"
3762,NOTE TO BOOK II,touches dialect: so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are
3763,NOTE TO BOOK II,"tortured, and the reader wearied, to commemorate shades of"
3764,NOTE TO BOOK II,"mispronunciation. Now, spelling is an art of great difficulty in my"
3765,NOTE TO BOOK II,"eyes, and I am inclined to lean upon the printer, even in common"
3766,NOTE TO BOOK II,"practice, rather than to venture abroad upon new quests. And the Scots"
3767,NOTE TO BOOK II,"tongue has an orthography of its own, lacking neither ""authority nor"
3768,NOTE TO BOOK II,"author."" Yet the temptation is great to lend a little guidance to the"
3769,NOTE TO BOOK II,bewildered Englishman. Some simple phonetic artifice might defend your
3770,NOTE TO BOOK II,"verses from barbarous mishandling, and yet not injure any vested"
3771,NOTE TO BOOK II,"interest. So it seems at first; but there are rocks ahead. Thus, if I"
3772,NOTE TO BOOK II,"wish the diphthong _ou_ to have its proper value, I may write _oor_"
3773,NOTE TO BOOK II,"instead of _our_; many have done so and lived, and the pillars of the"
3774,NOTE TO BOOK II,"universe remained unshaken. But if I did so, and came presently to"
3775,NOTE TO BOOK II,"_doun_, which is the classical Scots spelling of the English _down_, I"
3776,NOTE TO BOOK II,"should begin to feel uneasy; and if I went on a little further, and came"
3777,NOTE TO BOOK II,"to a classical Scots word, like _stour_ or _dour_ or _clour_, I should"
3778,NOTE TO BOOK II,"know precisely where I was--that is to say, that I was out of sight of"
3779,NOTE TO BOOK II,land on those high seas of spelling reform in which so many strong
3780,NOTE TO BOOK II,swimmers have toiled vainly. To some the situation is exhilarating; as
3781,NOTE TO BOOK II,"for me, I give one bubbling cry and sink. The compromise at which I have"
3782,NOTE TO BOOK II,"arrived is indefensible, and I have no thought of trying to defend it."
3783,NOTE TO BOOK II,"As I have stuck for the most part to the proper spelling, I append a"
3784,NOTE TO BOOK II,table of some common vowel sounds which no one need consult; and just to
3785,NOTE TO BOOK II,"prove that I belong to my age and have in me the stuff of a reformer, I"
3786,NOTE TO BOOK II,"have used modification marks throughout. Thus I can tell myself, not"
3787,NOTE TO BOOK II,"without pride, that I have added a fresh stumbling-block for English"
3788,NOTE TO BOOK II,"readers, and to a page of print in my native tongue have lent a new"

3791,NOTE TO BOOK II,"I note again, that among our new dialecticians, the local habitat of"
3792,NOTE TO BOOK II,every dialect is given to the square mile. I could not emulate this
3793,NOTE TO BOOK II,"nicety if I desired; for I simply wrote my Scots as well as I was able,"
3794,NOTE TO BOOK II,"not caring if it hailed from Lauderdale or Angus, from the Mearns or"
3795,NOTE TO BOOK II,"Galloway; if I had ever heard a good word, I used it without shame; and"
3796,NOTE TO BOOK II,"when Scots was lacking, or the rhyme jibbed, I was glad (like my"
3797,NOTE TO BOOK II,"betters) to fall back on English. For all that, I own to a friendly"
3798,NOTE TO BOOK II,"feeling for the tongue of Fergusson and of Sir Walter, both Edinburgh"
3799,NOTE TO BOOK II,men; and I confess that Burns has always sounded in my ear like
3800,NOTE TO BOOK II,something partly foreign. And indeed I am from the Lothians myself; it
3801,NOTE TO BOOK II,is there I heard the language spoken about my childhood; and it is in
3802,NOTE TO BOOK II,the drawling Lothian voice that I repeat it to myself. Let the
3803,NOTE TO BOOK II,"precisians call my speech that of the Lothians. And if it be not pure,"
3804,NOTE TO BOOK II,alas! what matters it? The day draws near when this illustrious and
3805,NOTE TO BOOK II,"malleable tongue shall be quite forgotten; and Burns's Ayrshire, and Dr."
3806,NOTE TO BOOK II,"MacDonald's Aberdeen-awa', and Scott's brave, metropolitan utterance"
3807,NOTE TO BOOK II,will be all equally the ghosts of speech. Till then I would love to have
3808,NOTE TO BOOK II,"my hour as a native Maker, and be read by my own countryfolk in our own"
3809,NOTE TO BOOK II,"dying language; an ambition surely rather of the heart than of the head,"
3810,NOTE TO BOOK II,"so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance, so parochial in bounds"
3811,NOTE TO BOOK II,of space.

4239,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,NOTE.--It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my
4240,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"eye, and this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation. In my"
4241,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,time there have been two ministers in that parish. Of the first I have a
4242,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"special reason to speak well, even had there been any to think ill. The"
4243,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"second I have often met in private and long (in the due phrase) ""sat"
4244,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"under"" in his church, and neither here nor there have I heard an unkind"
4245,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,or ugly word upon his lips. The preacher of the text had thus no
4246,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"original in that particular parish; but when I was a boy, he might have"
4247,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,been observed in many others; he was then (like the schoolmaster)
4248,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,"abroad; and by recent advices, it would seem he has not yet entirely"
4249,A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN,disappeared.--[R. L. S.]

5017,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"It fell in the days of old, as the men of Taiárapu tell,"
5018,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"A youth went forth to the fishing, and fortune favoured him well."
5019,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Támatéa his name: gullible, simple, and kind."
5020,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Comely of countenance, nimble of body, empty of mind,"
5021,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife,"
5022,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life.
5023,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Alone from the sea and the fishing came Támatéa the fair,"
5024,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Urging his boat to the beach, and the mother awaited him there."
5025,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""Long may you live!"" said she. ""Your fishing has sped to a wish."
5026,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish.
5027,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land,"
5028,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand,"
5029,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"The hours and the miles are counted, the tributes numbered and weighed,"
5030,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And woe to him that comes short, and woe to him that delayed!"""
5031,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"So spoke on the beach the mother, and counselled the wiser thing."
5032,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,For Rahéro stirred in the country and secretly mined the king.
5033,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought,"
5034,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought.
5035,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And when last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped,"
5036,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead,"
5037,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing,"
5038,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"For there was the aito[1] dead, and he of the house of the king."
5039,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5040,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"So spake on the beach the mother, matter worthy of note,"
5041,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And wattled a basket well, and chose a fish from the boat;"
5042,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Támatéa the pliable shouldered the basket and went,"
5043,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And travelled, and sang as he travelled, a lad that was well content."
5044,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast,"
5045,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most.
5046,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"On his left, with smoke as of battle, the billows battered the land;"
5047,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Unscalable, turreted mountains rose on the inner hand."
5048,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And cape, and village, and river, and vale, and mountain above,"
5049,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love;
5050,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And never the name of a place, but lo! a song in its praise:"
5051,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Ancient and unforgotten, songs of the earlier days"
5052,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"That the elders taught to the young, and at night, in the full of the"
5053,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"moon,"
5054,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune.
5055,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Támatéa the placable went with a lingering foot;
5056,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"He sang as loud as a bird, he whistled hoarse as a flute;"
5057,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"He broiled in the sun, he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees,"
5058,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees;
5059,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And still in his empty mind crowded, a thousand-fold,"
5060,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old.
5061,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5062,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And now was he come to a place Taiárapu honoured the most,"
5063,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast,"
5064,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Spewing a level river. There was a haunt of Pai.[2]
5065,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"There, in his potent youth, when his parents drove him to die,"
5066,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Honoura lived like a beast, lacking the lamp and the fire,"
5067,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire;
5068,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And there, so mighty his hands, he bent the tree to his foot--"
5069,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"So keen the spur of his hunger, he plucked it naked of fruit."
5070,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"There, as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills,"
5071,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Ahupu, the woman of song, walked on high on the hills."
5072,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5073,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Of these was Rahéro sprung, a man of a godly race;"
5074,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And inherited cunning of spirit, and beauty of body and face."
5075,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Of yore in his youth, as an aito, Rahéro wandered the land,"
5076,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Delighting maids with his tongue, smiting men with his hand."
5077,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Famous he was in his youth; but before the midst of his life
5078,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Paused, and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife."
5079,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5080,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"_House of mine_ (it went), _house upon the sea,"
5081,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Belov'd of all my fathers, more belov'd by me!"
5082,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Vale of the strong Honoura, deep ravine of Pai,"
5083,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry_.
5084,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5085,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"_House of mine, in your walls, strong sounds the sea,"
5086,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Of all sounds on earth, dearest sound to me."
5087,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"I have heard the applause of men, I have heard it arise and die:"
5088,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry._
5089,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5090,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"These were the words of his singing, other the thought of his heart;"
5091,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"For secret desire of glory vexed him, dwelling apart."
5092,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Lazy and crafty he was, and loved to lie in the sun,"
5093,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun;
5094,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Lazy he was, his roof was ragged, his table was lean,"
5095,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the fish swam safe in his sea, and he gathered the near and the"
5096,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,green.
5097,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"He sat in his house and laughed, but he loathed the king of the land,"
5098,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand.
5099,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Treason spread from his door; and he looked for a day to come,"
5100,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"A day of the crowding people, a day of the summoning drum,"
5101,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"When the vote should be taken, the king be driven forth in disgrace,"
5102,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Rahéro, the laughing and lazy, sit and rule in his place."
5103,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5104,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Here Támatéa came, and beheld the house on the brook;"
5105,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And Rahéro was there by the way and covered an oven to cook.[3]
5106,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Naked he was to the loins, but the tattoo covered the lack,"
5107,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back.
5108,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet,"
5109,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat:
5110,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"For he marked the basket carried, covered from flies and the sun;[4]"
5111,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Rahéro buried his fire, but the meat in his house was done."
5112,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5113,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Forth he stepped; and took, and delayed the boy, by the hand;"
5114,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land:
5115,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""Our sires of old in Taiárapu, they that created the race,"
5116,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Ate ever with eager hand, nor regarded season or place,"
5117,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Ate in the boat at the oar, on the way afoot; and at night"
5118,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite.
5119,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire;
5120,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And behold how fitting the time! for here do I cover my fire."""
5121,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""I see the fire for the cooking, but never the meat to cook,"""
5122,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Said Támatéa.--""Tut!"" said Rahéro. ""Here in the brook,"
5123,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And there in the tumbling sea, the fishes are thick as flies,"
5124,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Hungry like healthy men, and like pigs for savour and size:"
5125,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Crayfish crowding the river, sea-fish thronging the sea."""
5126,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""Well, it may be,"" says the other, ""and yet be nothing to me."
5127,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Fain would I eat, but alas! I have needful matter in hand,"
5128,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land."""
5129,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5130,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Now at the word a light sprang in Rahéro's eyes.
5131,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"""I will gain me a dinner,"" thought he, ""and lend the king a surprise."""
5132,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And he took the lad by the arm, as they stood by the side of the track,"
5133,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And smiled, and rallied, and flattered, and pushed him forward and back."
5134,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"It was ""You that sing like a bird, I never have heard you sing,"""
5135,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And ""The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king."
5136,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And of what account is an hour, when the heart is empty of guile?"
5137,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"But come, and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile;"
5138,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And I will but drop my hook, and behold! the dinner made."""
5139,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5140,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,So Támatéa the pliable hung up his fish in the shade
5141,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"On a tree by the side of the way; and Rahéro carried him in,"
5142,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin,"
5143,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And chose him a shining hook,[5] and viewed it with sedulous eye,"
5144,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh,"
5145,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And set a mat for the gull, and bade him be merry and bide,"
5146,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Like a man concerned for his guest, and the fishing, and nothing beside."
5147,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5148,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Now when Rahéro was forth, he paused and hearkened, and heard"
5149,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word;
5150,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And stealthily crossed to the side of the way, to the shady place"
5151,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Where the basket hung on a mango; and craft transfigured his face.
5152,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Deftly he opened the basket, and took of the fat of the fish,"
5153,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"The cut of kings and chieftains, enough for a goodly dish."
5154,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"This he wrapped in a leaf, set on the fire to cook,"
5155,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And buried; and next the marred remains of the tribute he took,"
5156,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And doubled and packed them well, and covered the basket close."
5157,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""There is a buffet, my king,"" quoth he, ""and a nauseous dose!""--"
5158,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And hung the basket again in the shade, in a cloud of flies;"
5159,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"--""And there is a sauce to your dinner, king of the crafty eyes!"""
5160,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5161,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Soon as the oven was open, the fish smelt excellent good."
5162,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"In the shade, by the house of Rahéro, down they sat to their food,"
5163,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And cleared the leaves,[6] in silence, or uttered a jest and laughed"
5164,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And raising the cocoa-nut bowls, buried their faces and quaffed."
5165,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"But chiefly in silence they ate; and soon as the meal was done,"
5166,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Rahéro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun
5167,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And ""Támatéa,"" quoth he, ""it is time to be jogging, my lad."""
5168,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5169,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"So Támatéa arose, doing ever the thing he was bade,"
5170,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And carelessly shouldered the basket, and kindly saluted his host;"
5171,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast.
5172,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Long he went; and at length was aware of a pleasant green,"
5173,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the stems and shadows of palms, and roofs of lodges between."
5174,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"There sate, in the door of his palace, the king on a kingly seat,"
5175,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And aitos stood armed around, and the yottowas[7] sat at his feet."
5176,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,But fear was a worm in his heart: fear darted his eyes;
5177,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And he probed men's faces for treasons and pondered their speech for
5178,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,lies.
5179,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"To him came Támatéa, the basket slung in his hand,"
5180,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand.
5181,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"In silence hearkened the king, and closed the eyes in his face,"
5182,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base;
5183,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away.
5184,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"So Támatéa departed, turning his back on the day."
5185,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5186,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And lo! as the king sat brooding, a rumour rose in the crowd;"
5187,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"The yottowas nudged and whispered, the commons murmured aloud;"
5188,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing,"
5189,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,At the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king.
5190,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame
5191,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,In their midst; and the heart in his body was water and then was flame;
5192,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Till of a sudden, turning, he gripped an aito hard,"
5193,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"A youth that stood with his ómare,[8] one of the daily guard,"
5194,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And spat in his ear a command, and pointed and uttered a name,"
5195,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame.
5196,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5197,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Now Támatéa the fool was far on his homeward way,"
5198,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"The rising night in his face, behind him the dying day."
5199,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Rahéro saw him go by, and the heart of Rahéro was glad,"
5200,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad;
5201,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well,"
5202,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell;
5203,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"And pleased with the notice of folk, and pleased that his journey was"
5204,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"done,"
5205,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Támatéa drew homeward, turning his back to the sun."
5206,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5207,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And now was the hour of the bath in Taiárapu: far and near
5208,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear.
5209,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,Night massed in the valleys; the sun on the mountain coast
5210,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Struck, end-long; and above the clouds embattled their host,"
5211,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And glowed and gloomed on the heights; and the heads of the palms were
5212,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"gems,"
5213,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems;
5214,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And the shadow of Támatéa hovered already at home.
5215,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5216,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,And sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam
5217,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Struck on his ear; and he turned, and lo! a man on his track,"
5218,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"Girded and armed with an ómare, following hard at his back."
5219,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,"At a bound the man was upon him;--and, or ever a word was said,"
5220,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,The loaded end of the ómare fell and laid him dead.
5221,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5222,THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA,
5223,II,II
5224,II,
5225,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA
5226,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5227,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Thus was Rahéro's treason; thus and no further it sped.
5228,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead.
5229,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5230,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,But the mother of Támatéa arose with death in her eyes.
5231,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"All night long, and the next, Taiárapu rang with her cries."
5232,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt
5233,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And perceives nor home, nor friends, for the trees have closed her"
5234,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"about,"
5235,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair:
5236,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air
5237,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"For a while, and pierced men's hearing in vain, and wounded their"
5238,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,hearts.
5239,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But as when the weather changes at sea, in dangerous parts,"
5240,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky,"
5241,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"At once the ship lies idle, the sails hang silent on high,"
5242,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp,"
5243,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp:
5244,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So sudden, the voice of her weeping ceased; in silence she rose"
5245,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And passed from the house of her sorrow, a woman clothed with repose,"
5246,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death in her hand.
5247,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5248,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land.
5249,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"They tell that she feared not to slumber alone, in the dead of night,"
5250,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In accursed places; beheld, unblenched, the ribbon of light[9]"
5251,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Spin from temple to temple; guided the perilous skiff,"
5252,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff;
5253,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"From end to end of the island, thought not the distance long,"
5254,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong.
5255,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"To king after king, as they sat in the palace door, she came,"
5256,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Claiming kinship, declaiming verses, naming her name"
5257,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the names of all of her fathers; and still, with a heart on the"
5258,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"rack,"
5259,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back;
5260,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So would deceive them a while, and change and return in a breath,"
5261,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death;
5262,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And tempt her kings--for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous land,"
5263,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And flatter--for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand?
5264,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song,"
5265,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Invoking the beaten drums, beholding the fall of the strong,"
5266,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead.
5267,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And they held the chin in silence, and heard her, and shook the head;"
5268,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"For they knew the men of Taiárapu famous in battle and feast,"
5269,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.
5270,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"To the land of the Námunu-úra, to Paea,[10] at length she came,"
5271,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and name.
5272,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"There was she well received, and spoke with Hiopa the king.[11]"
5273,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Hiopa listened, and weighed, and wisely considered the thing."
5274,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"""Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place,"""
5275,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Quoth he to the woman, ""in quiet, a weak and peaceable race."
5276,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Taiárapu lies;
5277,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face, and cries"
5278,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Aloud in the top of arduous mountains, and utters its song"
5279,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In green continuous forests. Strong is the wind, and strong"
5280,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And fruitful and hardy the race, famous in battle and feast,"
5281,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.
5282,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Now hearken to me, my daughter, and hear a word of the wise:"
5283,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"How a strength goes linked with a weakness, two by two, like the eyes."
5284,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,They can wield the ómare well and cast the javelin far;
5285,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are.
5286,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Plant we, then, here at Paea a garden of excellent fruits;"
5287,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Plant we bananas and kava and taro, the king of roots;"
5288,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Let the pigs in Paea be tapu[12] and no man fish for a year;
5289,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here.
5290,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island and so,"
5291,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"At last, on the tongue of rumour, go where we wish it to go."
5292,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Then shall the pigs of Taiárapu raise their snouts in the air;
5293,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But we sit quiet and wait, as the fowler sits by the snare,"
5294,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And tranquilly fold our hands, till the pigs come nosing the food:"
5295,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But meanwhile build us a house of Trotéa, the stubborn wood,"
5296,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Bind it with incombustible thongs, set a roof to the room,"
5297,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume;
5298,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And there, when the pigs come trotting, there shall the feast be spread,"
5299,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead.
5300,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So be it done; for I have a heart that pities your state,"
5301,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Nateva and Námunu-úra are fire and water for hate."""
5302,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5303,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"All was done as he said, and the gardens prospered; and now"
5304,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The fame of their plenty went out, and word of it came to Vaiau."
5305,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"For the men of Námunu-úra sailed, to the windward far,"
5306,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are,"
5307,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And cast overboard of their plenty; and lo! at the Tevas' feet
5308,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The surf on all the beaches tumbled treasures of meat.
5309,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In the salt of the sea, a harvest tossed with the refluent foam;"
5310,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the children gleaned it in playing, and ate and carried it home;"
5311,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the elders stared and debated, and wondered and passed the jest,"
5312,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest;
5313,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And little by little, from one to another, the word went round:"
5314,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"""In all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground,"
5315,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And swine are plenty as rats. And now, when they fare to the sea,"
5316,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The men of the Námunu-úra glean from under the tree
5317,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat;
5318,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat,"
5319,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The steersman eats at the helm, the rowers munch at the oar,"
5320,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And at length, when their bellies are full, overboard with the store!"""
5321,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Now was the word made true, and soon as the bait was bare,"
5322,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,All the pigs of Taiárapu raised their snouts in the air.
5323,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Songs were recited, and kinship was counted, and tales were told"
5324,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old
5325,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The clans of the island. ""To war,"" said they, ""now set we an end,"
5326,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And hie to the Námunu-úra even as a friend to a friend."""
5327,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5328,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So judged, and a day was named; and soon as the morning broke,"
5329,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Canoes were thrust in the sea, and the houses emptied of folk."
5330,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Strong blew the wind of the south, the wind that gathers the clan;"
5331,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran;
5332,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountain-high,"
5333,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,A mountain throned on a mountain. The fleet of canoes swept by
5334,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In the midst, on the green lagoon, with a crew released from care,"
5335,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Sailing an even water, breathing a summer air,"
5336,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Cheered by a cloudless sun; and ever to left and right,"
5337,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Bursting surge on the reef, drenching storms on the height."
5338,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day,"
5339,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay
5340,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"By all the towns of the Tevas; and still as they bowled along,"
5341,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song,"
5342,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea,"
5343,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree
5344,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Hailing and cheering. Time failed them for more to do;
5345,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The holiday village careened to the wind, and was gone from view"
5346,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Swift as a passing bird; and ever as onward it bore,"
5347,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Like the cry of the passing bird, bequeathed its song to the shore--"
5348,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child.
5349,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the gazer, left behind, stared at the wake and smiled."
5350,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"By all the towns of the Tevas they went, and Pápara last,"
5351,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The home of the chief, the place of muster in war; and passed"
5352,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The march of the lands of the clan, to the lands of an alien folk."
5353,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And there, from the dusk of the shoreside palms, a column of smoke"
5354,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun,"
5355,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"""Paea!"" they cried. ""It is Paea."" And so was the voyage done."
5356,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5357,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In the early fall of the night Hiopa came to the shore,"
5358,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And beheld and counted the comers, and lo, they were forty score;"
5359,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played,"
5360,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The clean-lipped smile of the boy, the slender breasts of the maid,"
5361,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And mighty limbs of women, stalwart mothers of men."
5362,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The sires stood forth unabashed; but a little back from
5363,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,his ken
5364,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Clustered the scarcely nubile, the lads and maids, in a ring,"
5365,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Fain of each other, afraid of themselves, aware of the king"
5366,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And aping behaviour, but clinging together with hands and eyes,"
5367,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"With looks that were kind like kisses, and laughter tender as sighs."
5368,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"There, too, the grandsire stood, raising his silver crest,"
5369,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast.
5370,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The childhood of love, the pair well married, the innocent brood,"
5371,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed--
5372,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Hiopa beheld them together, all the ages of man,"
5373,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And a moment shook in his purpose.
5374,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5375,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But these were the foes of his clan,"
5376,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And he trod upon pity, and came, and civilly greeted the king,"
5377,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And gravely entreated Rahéro; and for all that could fight or sing,"
5378,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And claimed a name in the land, had fitting phrases of praise:"
5379,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient days.
5380,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And ""'Tis true,"" said he, ""that in Paea the victual rots on the ground;"
5381,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But, friends, your number is many; and pigs must be hunted and found,"
5382,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the lads must troop to the mountains to bring the féis down,"
5383,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town.
5384,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So, for to-night, sleep here; but king, common, and priest"
5385,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"To-morrow, in order due, shall sit with me in the feast."""
5386,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Sleepless the live-long night, Hiopa's followers toiled."
5387,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The pigs screamed and were slaughtered; the spars of the guest-house
5388,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"oiled,"
5389,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The leaves spread on the floor. In many a mountain glen
5390,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men
5391,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Plucking and bearing fruits; and in all the bounds of the town
5392,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Red glowed the cocoa-nut fires, and were buried and trodden down."
5393,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan,"
5394,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But the eighth wrought with his lads, hid from the sight of man."
5395,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In the deeps of the woods they laboured, piling the fuel high"
5396,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"In fagots, the load of a man, fuel seasoned and dry,"
5397,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame.
5398,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5399,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And now was the day of the feast. The forests, as morning came,"
5400,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Tossed in the wind, and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day--"
5401,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the cocoa-nuts showered on the ground, rebounding and rolling away:"
5402,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"A glorious morn for a feast, a famous wind for a fire."
5403,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them, mother and sire"
5404,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And maid and babe in a tale, the whole of the holiday throng."
5405,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Smiling they came, garlanded green, not dreaming of wrong;"
5406,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And for every three, a pig, tenderly cooked in the ground,"
5407,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Waited; and féi, the staff of life, heaped in a mound"
5408,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"For each where he sat;--for each, bananas roasted and raw"
5409,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Piled with a bountiful hand, as for horses hay and straw"
5410,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Are stacked in a stable; and fish, the food of desire,[13]"
5411,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And plentiful vessels of sauce, and bread-fruit gilt in the fire;--"
5412,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And kava was common as water. Feasts have there been ere now,"
5413,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And many, but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau."
5414,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"All day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes,"
5415,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And turned from the pigs to the fish, and again from the fish to the"
5416,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"fruits,"
5417,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And emptied the vessels of sauce, and drank of the kava deep;"
5418,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Till the young lay stupid as stones, and the strongest nodded to sleep."
5419,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night
5420,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Tethered them hand and foot; and their souls were drowned, and the light"
5421,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Was cloaked from their eyes. Senseless together, the old and the young,"
5422,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue,"
5423,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The woman wedded and fruitful, inured to the pangs of birth,"
5424,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the maid that knew not of kisses, blindly sprawled on the earth."
5425,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,From the hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth.
5426,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5427,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north;
5428,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn,"
5429,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Showering the nuts in the dusk, and e'en as a banner is torn,"
5430,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"High on the peaks of the island, shattered the mountain cloud."
5431,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And now at once, at a signal, a silent, emulous crowd"
5432,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Set hands to the work of death, hurrying to and fro,"
5433,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Like ants, to furnish the fagots, building them broad and low,"
5434,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall.
5435,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Silence persisted within, for sleep lay heavy on all"
5436,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But the mother of Támatéa stood at Hiopa's side,"
5437,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride,"
5438,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Night fell on the toilers, and first Hiopa the wise"
5439,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Made the round of the hose, visiting all with his eyes;"
5440,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And all was piled to the eaves, and fuel blockaded the door;"
5441,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And within, in the house beleaguered, slumbered the forty score."
5442,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5443,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Then was an aito despatched and came with fire in his hand,"
5444,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And Hiopa took it.--""Within,"" said he, ""is the life of a land;"
5445,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And behold! I breathe on the coal, I breathe on the dales of the east,"
5446,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And silence falls on forest and shore; the voice of the feast
5447,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Is quenched, and the smoke of cooking; the roof-tree decays and falls"
5448,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"On the empty lodge, and the winds subvert deserted walls."""
5449,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5450,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Therewithal, to the fuel, he laid the glowing coal;"
5451,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a mole,"
5452,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And copious smoke was conceived. But, as when a dam is to burst,"
5453,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first,"
5454,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And then, of a sudden, whelms and bears it away forthright;"
5455,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"So now, in a moment, the flame sprang and towered in the night,"
5456,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And wrestled and roared in the wind, and high over house and tree,"
5457,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Stood, like a streaming torch, enlightening land and sea."
5458,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5459,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"But the mother of Támatéa threw her arms abroad,"
5460,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"""Pyre of my son,"" she shouted, ""debited vengeance of God,"
5461,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Late, late, I behold you, yet I behold you at last,"
5462,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And glory, beholding! For now are the days of my agony past,"
5463,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The lust that famished my soul now eats and drinks its desire,"
5464,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,And they that encompassed my son shrivel alive in the fire.
5465,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,Tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years!
5466,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Ye quenched the voice of my singer?--hark, in your dying ears,"
5467,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,The song of the conflagration! Ye left me a widow alone?
5468,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"--Behold, the whole of your race consumes, sinew and bone"
5469,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"And torturing flesh together: man, mother, and maid"
5470,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Heaped in a common shambles; and already, borne by the trade,"
5471,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"The smoke of your dissolution darkens the stars of night."""
5472,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,
5473,THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA,"Thus she spoke, and her stature grew in the people's sight."

5478,RAHÉRO,RAHÉRO
5479,RAHÉRO,
5480,RAHÉRO,"Rahéro was there in the hall asleep: beside him his wife,"
5481,RAHÉRO,"Comely, a mirthful woman, one that delighted in life;"
5482,RAHÉRO,"And a girl that was ripe for marriage, shy and sly as a mouse;"
5483,RAHÉRO,"And a boy, a climber of trees: all the hopes of his house."
5484,RAHÉRO,"Unwary, with open hands, he slept in the midst of his folk,"
5485,RAHÉRO,"And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without, and awoke,"
5486,RAHÉRO,Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears.
5487,RAHÉRO,A hellish glow and clouds were about him;--it roared in his ears
5488,RAHÉRO,Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep;
5489,RAHÉRO,"And Rahéro swayed as he stood, and his reason was still asleep."
5490,RAHÉRO,"Now the flame struck hard on the house, wind-wielded, a fracturing blow,"
5491,RAHÉRO,And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below;
5492,RAHÉRO,"And the lofty hall, and the feast, and the prostrate bodies of folk,"
5493,RAHÉRO,"Shone red in his eyes a moment, and then were swallowed of smoke."
5494,RAHÉRO,In the mind of Rahéro clearness came; and he opened his throat;
5495,RAHÉRO,"And as when a squall comes sudden, the straining sail of a boat"
5496,RAHÉRO,"Thunders aloud and bursts, so thundered the voice of the man."
5497,RAHÉRO,"--""The wind and the rain!"" he shouted, the mustering word of the"
5498,RAHÉRO,"clan,[14]"
5499,RAHÉRO,"And ""Up!"" and ""To arms, men of Vaiau!"" But silence replied,"
5500,RAHÉRO,"Or only the voice of the gusts of the fire, and nothing beside."
5501,RAHÉRO,
5502,RAHÉRO,"Rahéro stooped and groped. He handled his womankind,"
5503,RAHÉRO,But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their
5504,RAHÉRO,"mind,"
5505,RAHÉRO,"And they lay like pillars prone; and his hand encountered the boy,"
5506,RAHÉRO,And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy.
5507,RAHÉRO,"""Him can I save!"" he thought, ""if I were speedy enough."""
5508,RAHÉRO,"And he loosened the cloth from his loins, and swaddled the child in the"
5509,RAHÉRO,stuff:
5510,RAHÉRO,And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well.
5511,RAHÉRO,
5512,RAHÉRO,"There where the roof had fallen, it roared like the mouth of hell."
5513,RAHÉRO,"Thither Rahéro went, stumbling on senseless folk,"
5514,RAHÉRO,"And grappled a post of the house, and began to climb in the smoke:"
5515,RAHÉRO,The last alive of Vaiau; and the son borne by the sire.
5516,RAHÉRO,"The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire,"
5517,RAHÉRO,And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs;
5518,RAHÉRO,And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes;
5519,RAHÉRO,"And still he climbed, and came to the top, the place of proof,"
5520,RAHÉRO,"And thrust a hand through the flame, and clambered alive on the roof."
5521,RAHÉRO,"But even as he did so, the wind, in a garment of flames and pain,"
5522,RAHÉRO,Wrapped him from head to heel; and the waistcloth parted in twain;
5523,RAHÉRO,And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below.
5524,RAHÉRO,
5525,RAHÉRO,"About the blazing feast-house clustered the eyes of the foe,"
5526,RAHÉRO,"Watching, hand upon weapon, lest ever a soul should flee,"
5527,RAHÉRO,"Shading the brow from the glare, straining the neck to see."
5528,RAHÉRO,"Only, to leeward, the flames in the wind swept far and wide,"
5529,RAHÉRO,And the forest sputtered on fire; and there might no man abide.
5530,RAHÉRO,"Thither Rahéro crept, and dropped from the burning eaves,"
5531,RAHÉRO,"And crouching low to the ground, in a treble covert of leaves"
5532,RAHÉRO,"And fire and volleying smoke, ran for the life of his soul"
5533,RAHÉRO,"Unseen; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal,"
5534,RAHÉRO,"Cairned with a wonder of flame, and blotting the night with smoke,"
5535,RAHÉRO,Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk.
5536,RAHÉRO,
5537,RAHÉRO,"He fled unguided at first; but hearing the breakers roar,"
5538,RAHÉRO,"Thitherward shaped his way, and came at length to the shore."
5539,RAHÉRO,Sound-limbed he was: dry-eyed; but smarted in every part;
5540,RAHÉRO,And the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart
5541,RAHÉRO,"With sorrow and rage. And ""Fools!"" he cried, ""fools of Vaiau,"
5542,RAHÉRO,Heads of swine--gluttons--Alas! and where are they now?
5543,RAHÉRO,"Those that I played with, those that nursed me, those that I nursed?"
5544,RAHÉRO,"God, and I outliving them! I, the least and the worst--"
5545,RAHÉRO,"I, that thought myself crafty, snared by this herd of swine,"
5546,RAHÉRO,"In the tortures of hell and desolate, stripped of all that was mine:"
5547,RAHÉRO,All!--my friends and my fathers--the silver heads of yore
5548,RAHÉRO,"That trooped to the council, the children that ran to the open door"
5549,RAHÉRO,Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father's knees!
5550,RAHÉRO,"And mine, my wife--my daughter--my sturdy climber of trees,"
5551,RAHÉRO,"Ah, never to climb again!"""
5552,RAHÉRO,
5553,RAHÉRO,Thus in the dusk of the night
5554,RAHÉRO,"(For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight),"
5555,RAHÉRO,"Pacing and gnawing his fists, Rahéro raged by the shore."
5556,RAHÉRO,Vengeance: that must be his. But much was to do before;
5557,RAHÉRO,"And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place,"
5558,RAHÉRO,"A life, the root of revenge, surviving plant of the race:"
5559,RAHÉRO,"And next the race to be raised anew, and the lands of the clan"
5560,RAHÉRO,"Repeopled. So Rahéro designed, a prudent man"
5561,RAHÉRO,"Even in wrath, and turned for the means of revenge and escape:"
5562,RAHÉRO,"A boat to be seized by stealth, a wife to be taken by rape."
5563,RAHÉRO,
5564,RAHÉRO,"Still was the dark lagoon; beyond on the coral wall,"
5565,RAHÉRO,"He saw the breakers shine, he heard them bellow and fall."
5566,RAHÉRO,"Alone, on the top of the reef, a man with a flaming brand"
5567,RAHÉRO,"Walked, gazing and pausing, a fish-spear poised in his hand."
5568,RAHÉRO,"The foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came,"
5569,RAHÉRO,And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame
5570,RAHÉRO,Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait:
5571,RAHÉRO,A figure dimly guiding it: surely the fisherman's mate.
5572,RAHÉRO,Rahéro saw and he smiled. He straightened his mighty thews:
5573,RAHÉRO,"Naked, with never a weapon, and covered with scorch and bruise,"
5574,RAHÉRO,"He straightened his arms, he filled the void of his body with breath,"
5575,RAHÉRO,"And, strong as the wind in his manhood, doomed the fisher to death."
5576,RAHÉRO,
5577,RAHÉRO,"Silent he entered the water, and silently swam, and came"
5578,RAHÉRO,"There where the fisher walked, holding on high the flame."
5579,RAHÉRO,Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea;
5580,RAHÉRO,"And hard at the back of the man, Rahéro crept to his knee"
5581,RAHÉRO,"On the coral, and suddenly sprang and seized him, the elder hand"
5582,RAHÉRO,"Clutching the joint of his throat, the other snatching the brand"
5583,RAHÉRO,"Ere it had time to fall, and holding it steady and high."
5584,RAHÉRO,"Strong was the fisher, brave, and swift of mind and of eye--"
5585,RAHÉRO,"Strongly he threw in the clutch; but Rahéro resisted the strain,"
5586,RAHÉRO,"And jerked, and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain,"
5587,RAHÉRO,And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet.
5588,RAHÉRO,
5589,RAHÉRO,"One moment: and there, on the reef, where the breakers whitened and"
5590,RAHÉRO,"beat,"
5591,RAHÉRO,"Rahéro was standing alone, glowing, and scorched and bare,"
5592,RAHÉRO,"A victor unknown of any, raising the torch in the air."
5593,RAHÉRO,"But once he drank of his breath, and instantly set him to fish"
5594,RAHÉRO,Like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish.
5595,RAHÉRO,For what should the woman have seen? A man with a torch--and then
5596,RAHÉRO,A moment's blur of the eyes--and a man with a torch again.
5597,RAHÉRO,"And the torch had scarcely been shaken. ""Ah, surely,"" Rahéro said,"
5598,RAHÉRO,"""She will deem it a trick of the eyes, a fancy born in the head;"
5599,RAHÉRO,"But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool's belief."""
5600,RAHÉRO,"So for a while, a sedulous fisher, he walked the reef,"
5601,RAHÉRO,"Pausing at times and gazing, striking at times with the spear:"
5602,RAHÉRO,"--Lastly, uttered the call; and even as the boat drew near,"
5603,RAHÉRO,"Like a man that was done with its use, tossed the torch in the sea."
5604,RAHÉRO,
5605,RAHÉRO,Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman; and she
5606,RAHÉRO,"Lightly addressed him, and yielded the paddle and place to sit;"
5607,RAHÉRO,For now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit.
5608,RAHÉRO,"Rahéro set him to row, never a word he spoke,"
5609,RAHÉRO,And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke.
5610,RAHÉRO,"--""What ails you?"" the woman asked, ""and why did you drop the brand?"
5611,RAHÉRO,"We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land."""
5612,RAHÉRO,"Never a word Rahéro replied, but urged the canoe."
5613,RAHÉRO,"And a chill fell on the woman.--""Atta! speak! is it you?"
5614,RAHÉRO,Speak! Why are you silent? Why do you bend aside?
5615,RAHÉRO,"Wherefore steer to the seaward?"" thus she panted and cried."
5616,RAHÉRO,"Never a word from the oarsman, toiling there in the dark;"
5617,RAHÉRO,"But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark,"
5618,RAHÉRO,"And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep,"
5619,RAHÉRO,"Drove her, the little fitted, forth on the open deep."
5620,RAHÉRO,"And fear, there where she sat, froze the woman to stone:"
5621,RAHÉRO,Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone;
5622,RAHÉRO,"But a keener fear of the night, the dark, and the ghostly hour,"
5623,RAHÉRO,And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal's power
5624,RAHÉRO,And more than a mortal's boldness. For much she knew of the dead
5625,RAHÉRO,"That haunt and fish upon reefs, toiling, like men, for bread,"
5626,RAHÉRO,"And traffic with human fishers, or slay them and take their ware,"
5627,RAHÉRO,"Till the hour when the star of the dead[15] goes down, and the morning"
5628,RAHÉRO,air
5629,RAHÉRO,"Blows, and the cocks are singing on shore. And surely she knew"
5630,RAHÉRO,The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave.[16]
5631,RAHÉRO,
5632,RAHÉRO,It blew
5633,RAHÉRO,"All night from the south; all night, Rahéro contended and kept"
5634,RAHÉRO,"The prow to the cresting sea; and, silent as though she slept,"
5635,RAHÉRO,The woman huddled and quaked. And now was the peep of day.
5636,RAHÉRO,High and long on their left the mountainous island lay;
5637,RAHÉRO,And over the peaks of Taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck.
5638,RAHÉRO,On shore the birds were beginning to sing: the ghostly ruck
5639,RAHÉRO,Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave;
5640,RAHÉRO,"And here on the sea, the woman, waxing suddenly brave,"
5641,RAHÉRO,Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man.
5642,RAHÉRO,"And sure he was none that she knew, none of her country or clan:"
5643,RAHÉRO,"A stranger, mother-naked, and marred with the marks of fire,"
5644,RAHÉRO,"But comely and great of stature, a man to obey and admire."
5645,RAHÉRO,
5646,RAHÉRO,"And Rahéro regarded her also, fixed, with a frowning face,"
5647,RAHÉRO,Judging the woman's fitness to mother a warlike race.
5648,RAHÉRO,"Broad of shoulder, ample of girdle, long in the thigh,"
5649,RAHÉRO,"Deep of bosom she was, and bravely supported his eye."
5650,RAHÉRO,
5651,RAHÉRO,"""Woman,"" said he, ""last night the men of your folk--"
5652,RAHÉRO,"Man, woman, and maid, smothered my race in smoke."
5653,RAHÉRO,"It was done like cowards; and I, a mighty man of my hands,"
5654,RAHÉRO,"Escaped, a single life; and now to the empty lands"
5655,RAHÉRO,"And smokeless hearths of my people, sail, with yourself, alone."
5656,RAHÉRO,"Before your mother was born, the die of to-day was thrown"
5657,RAHÉRO,"And you selected:--your husband, vainly striving, to fall"
5658,RAHÉRO,"Broken between these hands:--yourself to be severed from all,"
5659,RAHÉRO,"The places, the people, you love--home, kindred, and clan--"
5660,RAHÉRO,"And to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man."""

5682,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"For oft to loving hearts, and waiting ears and sight,"
5683,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,The lads that went to forage returned not with the night.
5684,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Now first the children sickened, and then the women paled,"
5685,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed.
5686,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Hushed was the deep drum, discarded was the dance;"
5687,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And those that met the priest now glanced at him askance.
5688,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"The priest was a man of years, his eyes were ruby-red,[2]"
5689,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead,"
5690,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He knew the songs of races, the names of ancient date;"
5691,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief's estate.
5692,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He dwelt in a high-built lodge, hard by the roaring shore,"
5693,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Raised on a noble terrace and with tikis[3] at the door.
5694,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Within it was full of riches, for he served his nation well,"
5695,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And full of the sound of breakers, like the hollow of a shell."
5696,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"For weeks he let them perish, gave never a helping sign,"
5697,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"But sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine,"
5698,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"But sat on his high terrace, with the tikis by his side,"
5699,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And stared on the blue ocean, like a parrot, ruby-eyed."
5700,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,
5701,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height:
5702,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light,"
5703,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun;--
5704,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,But down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun.
5705,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"In the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa-husk,"
5706,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk,"
5707,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"A word that began to go round, a word, a whisper, a start:"
5708,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Hope that leaped in the bosom, fear that knocked on the heart:"
5709,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"""See, the priest is not risen--look, for his door is fast!"
5710,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He is going to name the victims; he is going to help us at last."""
5711,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,
5712,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Thrice rose the sun to noon; and ever, like one of the dead,"
5713,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"The priest lay still in his house, with the roar of the sea in his head;"
5714,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"There was never a foot on the floor, there was never a whisper of"
5715,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,speech;
5716,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach.
5717,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Again were the mountains fired, again the morning broke;"
5718,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And all the houses lay still, but the house of the priest awoke."
5719,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan,"
5720,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"But the aged, red-eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man;"
5721,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again,"
5722,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,In the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain.
5723,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Frenzy shook in his limbs, frenzy shone in his eyes,"
5724,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And still and again as he ran, the valley rang with his cries."
5725,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"All day long in the land, by cliff and thicket and den,"
5726,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He ran his lunatic rounds, and howled for the flesh of men;"
5727,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"All day long he ate not, nor ever drank of the brook;"
5728,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And all day long in their houses the people listened and shook--
5729,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"All day long in their houses they listened with bated breath,"
5730,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And never a soul went forth, for the sight of the priest was death."
5731,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,
5732,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Three were the days of his running, as the gods appointed of yore,"
5733,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore:
5734,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"The drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees,"
5735,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,On the sacred stones of the High-place under the sacred trees;
5736,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"With a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast,"
5737,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest.
5738,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"Last, when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree,"
5739,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea,"
5740,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk,"
5741,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,The wreck of the red-eyed priest came gasping home in the dusk.
5742,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"He reeled across the village, he staggered along the shore,"
5743,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,And between the leering tikis crept groping through his door.
5744,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,
5745,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"There went a stir through the lodges, the voice of speech awoke;"
5746,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke.
5747,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,"And those who were mighty in war, and those renowned for an art"
5748,THE PRIEST'S VIGIL,Sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart.

5757,THE LOVERS,"In the lighted house of her father, why should Taheia start?"
5758,THE LOVERS,"Taheia heavy of hair, Taheia tender of heart,"

5760,THE LOVERS,"Nimble of foot like the deer, and kind of eye like the dove?"
5761,THE LOVERS,"Sly and shy as a cat, with never a change of face,"
5762,THE LOVERS,"Taheia slips to the door, like one that would breathe a space;"
5763,THE LOVERS,"Saunters and pauses, and looks at the stars, and lists to the seas;"
5764,THE LOVERS,"Then sudden and swift as a cat, she plunges under the trees."

5767,THE LOVERS,"And ever to guide her way over the smooth and the sharp,"

5795,THE LOVERS,"Round half my tender body, that none shall clasp but you,"
5796,THE LOVERS,For a crest and a fair adornment go dainty lines of blue.

5870,THE FEAST,
5871,THE FEAST,"Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the naked peak,"
5872,THE FEAST,"And all the village was stirring, for now was the priest to speak."
5873,THE FEAST,"Forth on his terrace he came, and sat with the chief in talk;"
5874,THE FEAST,"His lips were blackened with fever, his cheeks were whiter than chalk;"
5875,THE FEAST,"Fever clutched at his hands, fever nodded his head,"
5876,THE FEAST,"But, quiet and steady and cruel, his eyes shone ruby-red."
5877,THE FEAST,In the earliest rays of the sun the chief rose up content;
5878,THE FEAST,"Braves were summoned, and drummers; messengers came and went;"
5879,THE FEAST,Braves ran to their lodges; weapons were snatched from the wall;
5880,THE FEAST,"The commons herded together, and fear was over them all."
5881,THE FEAST,"Festival dresses they wore, but the tongue was dry in their mouth,"
5882,THE FEAST,And the blinking eyes in their faces skirted from north to south.
5883,THE FEAST,
5884,THE FEAST,"Now to the sacred enclosure gathered the greatest and least,"
5885,THE FEAST,"And from under the shade of the banyan arose the voice of the feast,"
5886,THE FEAST,"The frenzied roll of the drum, and a swift monotonous song."
5887,THE FEAST,Higher the sun swam up; the trade-wind level and strong
5888,THE FEAST,"Awoke in the tops of the palms and rattled the fans aloud,"
5889,THE FEAST,And over the garlanded heads and shining robes of the crowd
5890,THE FEAST,"Tossed the spiders of shadow, scattered the jewels of sun."
5891,THE FEAST,"Forty the tale of the drums, and the forty throbbed like one;"
5892,THE FEAST,"A thousand hearts in the crowd, and the even chorus of song,"
5893,THE FEAST,"Swift as the feet of a runner, trampled a thousand strong."
5894,THE FEAST,And the old men leered at the ovens and licked their lips for the food;
5895,THE FEAST,"And the women stared at the lads, and laughed and looked to the wood."
5896,THE FEAST,"As when the sweltering baker, at night, when the city is dead,"
5897,THE FEAST,Alone in the trough of labour treads and fashions the bread;
5898,THE FEAST,"So in the heat, and the reek, and the touch of woman and man,"
5899,THE FEAST,The naked spirit of evil kneaded the hearts of the clan.
5900,THE FEAST,
5901,THE FEAST,"Now cold was at many a heart, and shaking in many a seat;"
5902,THE FEAST,"For there were the empty baskets, but who was to furnish the meat?"
5903,THE FEAST,"For here was the nation assembled, and there were the ovens anigh,"
5904,THE FEAST,And out of a thousand singers nine were numbered to die.
5905,THE FEAST,"Till, of a sudden, a shock, a mace in the air, a yell,"
5906,THE FEAST,"And, struck in the edge of the crowd, the first of the victims fell.[8]"
5907,THE FEAST,"Terror and horrible glee divided the shrinking clan,"
5908,THE FEAST,"Terror of what was to follow, glee for a diet of man."
5909,THE FEAST,"Frenzy hurried the chant, frenzy rattled the drums;"
5910,THE FEAST,"The nobles, high on the terrace, greedily mouthed their thumbs;"
5911,THE FEAST,"And once and again and again, in the ignorant crowd below,"
5912,THE FEAST,Once and again and again descended the murderous blow.
5913,THE FEAST,"Now smoked the oven, and now, with the cutting lip of a shell,"
5914,THE FEAST,A butcher of ninety winters jointed the bodies well.
5915,THE FEAST,"Unto the carven lodge, silent, in order due,"
5916,THE FEAST,The grandees of the nation one after one withdrew;
5917,THE FEAST,"And a line of laden bearers brought to the terrace foot,"
5918,THE FEAST,"On poles across their shoulders, the last reserve of fruit."
5919,THE FEAST,The victims bled for the nobles in the old appointed way;
5920,THE FEAST,"The fruit was spread for the commons, for all should eat to-day."
5921,THE FEAST,"And now was the kava brewed, and now the cocoa ran,"
5922,THE FEAST,Now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man;
5923,THE FEAST,"And mirth was in every heart and a garland on every head,"
5924,THE FEAST,And all was well with the living and well with the eight who were dead.
5925,THE FEAST,Only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted a while:
5926,THE FEAST,"""To-morrow,"" they said, and ""To-morrow,"" and nodded and seemed to smile:"
5927,THE FEAST,"""Rua the child of dirt, the creature of common clay,"
5928,THE FEAST,"Rua must die to-morrow, since Rua is gone to-day."""
5929,THE FEAST,"Out of the groves of the valley, where clear the blackbirds sang,"
5930,THE FEAST,Sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain sprang;
5931,THE FEAST,"Sheer and bare it rose, unscalable barricade,"
5932,THE FEAST,Beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade.
5933,THE FEAST,"Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light,"
5934,THE FEAST,Close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night.
5935,THE FEAST,"Here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees,"
5936,THE FEAST,"Or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze,"
5937,THE FEAST,"High overhead, with a cry, the torrents leaped for the main,"
5938,THE FEAST,And silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain.
5939,THE FEAST,"Dark in the staring noon, dark was Rua's ravine,"
5940,THE FEAST,"Damp and cold was the air, and the face of the cliffs was green."
5941,THE FEAST,"Here, in the rocky pit, accursed already of old,"
5942,THE FEAST,"On a stone in the midst of a river, Rua sat and was cold."
5943,THE FEAST,
5944,THE FEAST,"""Valley of mid-day shadows, valley of silent falls,"""
5945,THE FEAST,"Rua sang, and his voice went hollow about the walls,"
5946,THE FEAST,"""Valley of shadow and rock, a doleful prison to me,"
5947,THE FEAST,"What is the life you can give to a child of the sun and the sea?"""
5948,THE FEAST,"And Rua arose and came to the open mouth of the glen,"
5949,THE FEAST,"Whence he beheld the woods, and the sea, and houses of men."
5950,THE FEAST,"Wide blew the riotous trade, and smelt in his nostrils good;"
5951,THE FEAST,"It bowed the boats on the bay, and tore and divided the wood;"
5952,THE FEAST,"It smote and sundered the groves as Moses smote with the rod,"
5953,THE FEAST,And the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad;
5954,THE FEAST,"And ever and on, in a lull, the trade-wind brought him along"
5955,THE FEAST,A far-off patter of drums and a far-off whisper of song.
5956,THE FEAST,
5957,THE FEAST,"Swift as the swallow's wings, the diligent hands on the drum"
5958,THE FEAST,"Fluttered and hurried and throbbed. ""Ah, woe that I hear you come,"""
5959,THE FEAST,"Rua cried in his grief, ""a sorrowful sound to me,"
5960,THE FEAST,Mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea!
5961,THE FEAST,"Woe in the song! for the grave breathes in the singers' breath,"
5962,THE FEAST,And I hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death.
5963,THE FEAST,"Home of my youth! no more through all the length of the years,"
5964,THE FEAST,"No more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and tears,"
5965,THE FEAST,"No more shall Rua return; no more as the evening ends,"
5966,THE FEAST,"To crowded eyes of welcome, to the reaching hands of friends."""
5967,THE FEAST,
5968,THE FEAST,"All day long from the High-place the drums and the singing came,"
5969,THE FEAST,"And the even fell, and the sun went down, a wheel of flame;"
5970,THE FEAST,And night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the wood;
5971,THE FEAST,"And silence slept on all, where Rua sorrowed and stood."
5972,THE FEAST,"But still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival rang,"
5973,THE FEAST,And still the crowd in the High-place danced and shouted and sang.
5974,THE FEAST,
5975,THE FEAST,Now over all the isle terror was breathed abroad
5976,THE FEAST,Of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod;
5977,THE FEAST,"And before the nostrils of night, the shuddering hunter of men"
5978,THE FEAST,"Hurried, with beard on shoulder, back to his lighted den."
5979,THE FEAST,"""Taheia, here to my side!""--""Rua, my Rua, you!"""
5980,THE FEAST,"And cold from the clutch of terror, cold with the damp of the dew,"
5981,THE FEAST,"Taheia, heavy of hair, leaped through the dark to his arms;"
5982,THE FEAST,"Taheia leaped to his clasp, and was folded in from alarms."
5983,THE FEAST,
5984,THE FEAST,"""Rua, beloved, here, see what your love has brought;"
5985,THE FEAST,Coming--alas! returning--swift as the shuttle of thought;
5986,THE FEAST,"Returning, alas! for to-night, with the beaten drum and the voice,"
5987,THE FEAST,In the shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice;
5988,THE FEAST,"And Taheia the well-descended, the daughter of chief and priest,"
5989,THE FEAST,"Taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the feast."""
5990,THE FEAST,"So it was spoken; and she, girding her garment high,"
5991,THE FEAST,"Fled and was swallowed of woods, swift as the sight of an eye."
5992,THE FEAST,
5993,THE FEAST,"Night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of stars,"
5994,THE FEAST,"Then a trouble awoke in the air, the east was banded with bars;"
5995,THE FEAST,Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height;
5996,THE FEAST,"Dawn, in the deepest glen, fell a wonder of light;"
5997,THE FEAST,"High and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening east,"

5999,THE FEAST,"As, when in days of summer, through open windows, the fly"

6001,THE FEAST,"But when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse,"
6002,THE FEAST,Blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house:
6003,THE FEAST,"So the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night,"
6004,THE FEAST,"So it staggered and drooped, and droned in the morning light."

6010,THE RAID,
6011,THE RAID,It chanced that as Rua sat in the valley of silent falls
6012,THE RAID,He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls.
6013,THE RAID,"Fire had fashioned of yore, and time had broken, the rocks;"
6014,THE RAID,There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for flocks;
6015,THE RAID,"And he saw on the top of the cliffs, looking up from the pit of the"
6016,THE RAID,"shade,"
6017,THE RAID,"A flicker of wings and sunshine, and trees that swung in the trade."
6018,THE RAID,"""The trees swing in the trade,"" quoth Rua, doubtful of words,"
6019,THE RAID,"""And the sun stares from the sky, but what should trouble the birds?"""
6020,THE RAID,"Up from the shade he gazed, where high the parapet shone,"
6021,THE RAID,And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon.
6022,THE RAID,"""What manner of things are these? Are they spirits abroad by day?"
6023,THE RAID,"Or the foes of my clan that are come, bringing death by a perilous way?"""
6024,THE RAID,
6025,THE RAID,"The valley was gouged like a vessel, and round like the vessel's lip,"
6026,THE RAID,With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a
6027,THE RAID,ship.
6028,THE RAID,"On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair,"
6029,THE RAID,And the cape overhung like a chin a gulf of sunless air.
6030,THE RAID,"""Silence, heart! What is that?--that, which flickered and shone,"
6031,THE RAID,"Into the sun for an instant, and in an instant gone?"
6032,THE RAID,"Was it a warrior's plume, a warrior's girdle of hair?"
6033,THE RAID,"Swung in the loop of a rope, is he making a bridge of the air?"""
6034,THE RAID,"Once and again Rua saw, in the trenchant edge of the sky,"
6035,THE RAID,"The giddy conjuring done. And then, in the blink of an eye,"
6036,THE RAID,"A scream caught in with the breath, a whirling packet of limbs,"
6037,THE RAID,"A lump that dived in the gulf, more swift than a dolphin swims;"
6038,THE RAID,"And there was a lump at his feet, and eyes were alive in the lump."
6039,THE RAID,"Sick was the soul of Rua, ambushed close in a clump;"
6040,THE RAID,"Sick of soul he drew near, making his courage stout;"
6041,THE RAID,"And he looked in the face of the thing, and the life of the thing went"
6042,THE RAID,out.
6043,THE RAID,"And he gazed on the tattooed limbs, and, behold, he knew the man:"
6044,THE RAID,"Hoka, a chief of the Vais, the truculent foe of his clan:"
6045,THE RAID,"Hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope,"
6046,THE RAID,"Filled with the lust of war, and alive with courage and hope."
6047,THE RAID,
6048,THE RAID,"Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his eyes,"
6049,THE RAID,And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies.
6050,THE RAID,"""Foes of my race!"" cried Rua, ""the mouth of Rua is true:"
6051,THE RAID,Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you.
6052,THE RAID,"There was never a nobler foray, never a bolder plan;"
6053,THE RAID,Never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man;
6054,THE RAID,"And Rua, your evil-doer through all the days of his years,"
6055,THE RAID,"Counts it honour to hate you, honour to fall by your spears."""
6056,THE RAID,"And Rua straightened his back. ""O Vais, a scheme for a scheme!"""
6057,THE RAID,"Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream,"
6058,THE RAID,Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home
6059,THE RAID,Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam.
6060,THE RAID,"And Rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook,"
6061,THE RAID,And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took.
6062,THE RAID,"Swift were the heels of his flight, and loud behind as he went"
6063,THE RAID,Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent.
6064,THE RAID,"And ever he thought as he ran, and caught at his gasping breath,"
6065,THE RAID,"""O the fool of a Rua, Rua that runs to his death!"
6066,THE RAID,"But the right is the right,"" thought Rua, and ran like the wind on the"
6067,THE RAID,"foam,"
6068,THE RAID,"""The right is the right for ever, and home for ever home."
6069,THE RAID,For what though the oven smoke? And what though I die ere morn?
6070,THE RAID,"There was I nourished and tended, and there was Taheia born."""
6071,THE RAID,
6072,THE RAID,"Noon was high on the High-place, the second noon of the feast;"
6073,THE RAID,And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest;
6074,THE RAID,And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals;
6075,THE RAID,And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels;
6076,THE RAID,And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh
6077,THE RAID,With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye.
6078,THE RAID,"As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall,"
6079,THE RAID,"The dead and the maimed are scattered, and lie, and stagger, and crawl;"
6080,THE RAID,"So on the grades of the terrace, in the ardent eye of the day,"
6081,THE RAID,The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay;
6082,THE RAID,"And loud as the dome of the bees, in the time of a swarming horde,"
6083,THE RAID,A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared.
6084,THE RAID,Rua looked and wondered; he said to himself in his heart:
6085,THE RAID,"""Poor are the pleasures of life, and death is the better part."""
6086,THE RAID,But lo! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk
6087,THE RAID,"Sat by themselves, nor raised their serious eyes, nor spoke:"
6088,THE RAID,"Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged,"
6089,THE RAID,Gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged;
6090,THE RAID,"And quiet amongst the quiet, and fairer than all the fair,"
6091,THE RAID,"Taheia, the well-descended, Taheia, heavy of hair."
6092,THE RAID,"And the soul of Rua awoke, courage enlightened his eyes"
6093,THE RAID,And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise.
6094,THE RAID,"Over against him at once, in the spotted shade of the trees,"
6095,THE RAID,Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees;
6096,THE RAID,"On the grades of the sacred terrace, the driveller woke to fear,"
6097,THE RAID,And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering spear.
6098,THE RAID,"And Rua folded his arms, and scorn discovered his teeth;"
6099,THE RAID,"Above the war-crowd gibbered, and Rua stood smiling beneath."
6100,THE RAID,"Thick, like leaves in the autumn, faint, like April sleet,"
6101,THE RAID,Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet;
6102,THE RAID,"And Taheia leaped from her place; and the priest, the ruby-eyed,"
6103,THE RAID,"Ran to the front of the terrace, and brandished his arms and cried:"
6104,THE RAID,"""Hold, O fools, he brings tidings!"" and ""Hold, 'tis the love of my"
6105,THE RAID,"heart!"""
6106,THE RAID,"Till lo! in front of the terrace, Rua pierced with a dart."
6107,THE RAID,
6108,THE RAID,"Taheia cherished his head, and the aged priest stood by,"
6109,THE RAID,And gazed with eyes of ruby at Rua's darkening eye.
6110,THE RAID,"""Taheia, here is the end, I die a death for a man."
6111,THE RAID,I have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan.
6112,THE RAID,"See them, the drooping of hams! behold me the blinking crew;"
6113,THE RAID,"Fifty spears they cast, and one of fifty true!"
6114,THE RAID,"And you, O priest, the foreteller, foretell for yourself if you can,"
6115,THE RAID,Foretell the hour of the day when the Vais shall burst on your clan!
6116,THE RAID,"By the head of the tapu cleft, with death and fire in their hand,"
6117,THE RAID,"Thick and silent like ants, the warriors swarm in the land."""
6118,THE RAID,
6119,THE RAID,"And they tell that when next the sun had climbed to the noonday skies,"
6120,THE RAID,It shone on the smoke of feasting in the country of the Vais.

6745,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,In this ballad I have strung together some of the more striking
6746,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,particularities of the Marquesas. It rests upon no authority; it is in
6747,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,"no sense, like ""Rahéro,"" a native story; but a patchwork of details of"
6748,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,"manners and the impressions of a traveller. It may seem strange, when"
6749,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,"the scene is laid upon these profligate islands, to make the story hinge"
6750,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,on love. But love is not less known in the Marquesas than elsewhere; nor
6751,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,is there any cause of suicide more common in the islands.

6773,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,disfigured; the art of the Marquesan tattooer is extreme; and she would
6774,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,"appear to be clothed in a web of lace, inimitably delicate, exquisite in"

6790,NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE,it is probable that Marquesan life went far more gaily than is here

6796,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,INTRODUCTION.--I first heard this legend of my own country from that
6797,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,"friend of men of letters, Mr. Alfred Nutt, ""there in roaring London's"
6798,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,"central stream,"" and since the ballad first saw the light of day in"
6799,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,"_Scribner's Magazine_, Mr. Nutt and Lord Archibald Campbell have been in"
6800,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,"public controversy on the facts. Two clans, the Camerons and the"
6801,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,"Campbells, lay claim to this bracing story; and they do well: the man"
6802,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,who preferred his plighted troth to the commands and menaces of the dead
6803,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,is an ancestor worth disputing. But the Campbells must rest content:
6804,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,they have the broad lands and the broad page of history; this appanage
6805,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,must be denied them; for between the name of _Cameron_ and that of
6806,NOTES TO TICONDEROGA,_Campbell_ the muse will never hesitate.

6821,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,Among the curiosities of human nature this legend claims a high place.
6822,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,It is needless to remind the reader that the Picts were never
6823,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"exterminated, and form to this day a large proportion of the folk of"
6824,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"Scotland, occupying the eastern and the central parts, from the Firth of"
6825,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"Forth, or perhaps the Lammermoors, upon the south, to the Ord of"
6826,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,Caithness on the north. That the blundering guess of a dull chronicler
6827,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,should have inspired men with imaginary loathing for their own ancestors
6828,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,is already strange; that it should have begotten this wild legend seems
6829,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,incredible. Is it possible the chronicler's error was merely nominal?
6830,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"that what he told, and what the people proved themselves so ready to"
6831,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"receive, about the Picts, was true or partly true of some anterior and"
6832,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,"perhaps Lappish savages, small of stature, black of hue, dwelling"
6833,NOTE TO HEATHER ALE,underground--possibly also the distillers of some forgotten spirit? See

7976,THE WOODMAN,"In all the grove, nor stream nor bird"
7977,THE WOODMAN,"Nor aught beside my blows was heard,"
7978,THE WOODMAN,And the woods wore their noonday dress--
7979,THE WOODMAN,The glory of their silentness.
7980,THE WOODMAN,"From the island summit to the seas,"
7981,THE WOODMAN,"Trees mounted, and trees drooped, and trees"
7982,THE WOODMAN,Groped upward in the gaps. The green
7983,THE WOODMAN,Inarboured talus and ravine
7984,THE WOODMAN,"By fathoms. By the multitude,"
7985,THE WOODMAN,The rugged columns of the wood
7986,THE WOODMAN,And bunches of the branches stood:
7987,THE WOODMAN,"Thick as a mob, deep as a sea,"
7988,THE WOODMAN,And silent as eternity.
7989,THE WOODMAN,
7990,THE WOODMAN,"With lowered axe, with backward head,"
7991,THE WOODMAN,"Late from this scene my labourer fled,"
7992,THE WOODMAN,"And with a ravelled tale to tell,"
7993,THE WOODMAN,"Returned. Some denizen of hell,"
7994,THE WOODMAN,"Dead man or disinvested god,"
7995,THE WOODMAN,"Had close behind him peered and trod,"
7996,THE WOODMAN,And triumphed when he turned to flee.
7997,THE WOODMAN,How different fell the lines with me!
7998,THE WOODMAN,Whose eye explored the dim arcade
7999,THE WOODMAN,Impatient of the uncoming shade--
8000,THE WOODMAN,"Shy elf, or dryad pale and cold,"
8001,THE WOODMAN,Or mystic lingerer from of old:
8002,THE WOODMAN,"Vainly. The fair and stately things,"
8003,THE WOODMAN,"Impassive as departed kings,"
8004,THE WOODMAN,"All still in the wood's stillness stood,"
8005,THE WOODMAN,And dumb. The rooted multitude
8006,THE WOODMAN,"Nodded and brooded, bloomed and dreamed,"
8007,THE WOODMAN,"Unmeaning, undivined. It seemed"
8008,THE WOODMAN,"No other art, no hope, they knew,"
8009,THE WOODMAN,Than clutch the earth and seek the blue.
8010,THE WOODMAN,'Mid vegetable king and priest
8011,THE WOODMAN,"And stripling, I (the only beast)"
8012,THE WOODMAN,"Was at the beast's work, killing; hewed"
8013,THE WOODMAN,"The stubborn roots across, bestrewed"
8014,THE WOODMAN,"The glebe with the dislustred leaves,"
8015,THE WOODMAN,And bade the saplings fall in sheaves;
8016,THE WOODMAN,Bursting across the tangled math
8017,THE WOODMAN,"A ruin that I called a path,"
8018,THE WOODMAN,"A Golgotha that, later on,"
8019,THE WOODMAN,"When rains had watered, and suns shone,"
8020,THE WOODMAN,"And seeds enriched the place, should bear"
8021,THE WOODMAN,"And be called garden. Here and there,"
8022,THE WOODMAN,I spied and plucked by the green hair
8023,THE WOODMAN,"A foe more resolute to live,"
8024,THE WOODMAN,The toothed and killing sensitive.
8025,THE WOODMAN,"He, semi-conscious, fled the attack;"
8026,THE WOODMAN,He shrank and tucked his branches back;
8027,THE WOODMAN,"And straining by his anchor strand,"
8028,THE WOODMAN,Captured and scratched the rooting hand.
8029,THE WOODMAN,"I saw him crouch, I felt him bite;"
8030,THE WOODMAN,And straight my eyes were touched with sight.
8031,THE WOODMAN,I saw the wood for what it was;
8032,THE WOODMAN,The lost and the victorious cause;
8033,THE WOODMAN,"The deadly battle pitched in line,"
8034,THE WOODMAN,Saw silent weapons cross and shine:
8035,THE WOODMAN,"Silent defeat, silent assault,"
8036,THE WOODMAN,A battle and a burial vault.
8037,THE WOODMAN,
8038,THE WOODMAN,Thick round me in the teeming mud
8039,THE WOODMAN,Briar and fern strove to the blood.
8040,THE WOODMAN,The hooked liana in his gin
8041,THE WOODMAN,Noosed his reluctant neighbours in:
8042,THE WOODMAN,"There the green murderer throve and spread,"
8043,THE WOODMAN,"Upon his smothering victims fed,"
8044,THE WOODMAN,And wantoned on his climbing coil.
8045,THE WOODMAN,Contending roots fought for the soil
8046,THE WOODMAN,Like frightened demons: with despair
8047,THE WOODMAN,Competing branches pushed for air.
8048,THE WOODMAN,Green conquerors from overhead
8049,THE WOODMAN,Bestrode the bodies of their dead;
8050,THE WOODMAN,"The Caesars of the silvan field,"
8051,THE WOODMAN,"Unused to fail, foredoomed to yield:"
8052,THE WOODMAN,"For in the groins of branches, lo!"
8053,THE WOODMAN,The cancers of the orchid grow.
8054,THE WOODMAN,Silent as in the listed ring
8055,THE WOODMAN,"Two chartered wrestlers strain and cling,"
8056,THE WOODMAN,Dumb as by yellow Hooghly's side
8057,THE WOODMAN,The suffocating captives died:
8058,THE WOODMAN,So hushed the woodland warfare goes
8059,THE WOODMAN,Unceasing; and the silent foes
8060,THE WOODMAN,"Grapple and smother, strain and clasp"
8061,THE WOODMAN,"Without a cry, without a gasp."
8062,THE WOODMAN,"Here also sound Thy fans, O God,"
8063,THE WOODMAN,Here too Thy banners move abroad:
8064,THE WOODMAN,"Forest and city, sea and shore,"
8065,THE WOODMAN,"And the whole earth, Thy threshing-floor!"
8066,THE WOODMAN,"The drums of war, the drums of peace,"
8067,THE WOODMAN,"Roll through our cities without cease,"
8068,THE WOODMAN,And all the iron halls of life
8069,THE WOODMAN,Ring with the unremitting strife.
8070,THE WOODMAN,
8071,THE WOODMAN,The common lot we scarce perceive.
8072,THE WOODMAN,"Crowds perish, we nor mark nor grieve:"
8073,THE WOODMAN,The bugle calls--we mourn a few!
8074,THE WOODMAN,What corporal's guard at Waterloo?
8075,THE WOODMAN,What scanty hundreds more or less
8076,THE WOODMAN,In the man-devouring Wilderness?
8077,THE WOODMAN,What handful bled on Delhi ridge?
8078,THE WOODMAN,"--See, rather, London, on thy bridge"
8079,THE WOODMAN,"The pale battalions trample by,"
8080,THE WOODMAN,"Resolved to slay, resigned to die."
8081,THE WOODMAN,"Count, rather, all the maimed and dead"
8082,THE WOODMAN,In the unbrotherly war of bread.
8083,THE WOODMAN,"See, rather, under sultrier skies"
8084,THE WOODMAN,"What vegetable Londons rise,"
8085,THE WOODMAN,"And teem, and suffer without sound."
8086,THE WOODMAN,"Or in your tranquil garden ground,"
8087,THE WOODMAN,"Contented, in the falling gloom,"
8088,THE WOODMAN,Saunter and see the roses bloom.
8089,THE WOODMAN,"That these might live, what thousands died!"
8090,THE WOODMAN,All day the cruel hoe was plied;
8091,THE WOODMAN,The ambulance barrow rolled all day;
8092,THE WOODMAN,"Your wife, the tender, kind, and gay,"
8093,THE WOODMAN,"Donned her long gauntlets, caught the spud"
8094,THE WOODMAN,And bathed in vegetable blood;
8095,THE WOODMAN,"And the long massacre now at end,"
8096,THE WOODMAN,"See! where the lazy coils ascend,"
8097,THE WOODMAN,"See, where the bonfire sputters red"
8098,THE WOODMAN,"At even, for the innocent dead."
8099,THE WOODMAN,
8100,THE WOODMAN,"Why prate of peace? when, warriors all,"
8101,THE WOODMAN,"We clank in harness into hall,"
8102,THE WOODMAN,And ever bare upon the board
8103,THE WOODMAN,Lies the necessary sword.
8104,THE WOODMAN,"In the green field or quiet street,"
8105,THE WOODMAN,"Besieged we sleep, beleaguered eat;"
8106,THE WOODMAN,"Labour by day and wake o' nights,"
8107,THE WOODMAN,In war with rival appetites.
8108,THE WOODMAN,The rose on roses feeds; the lark
8109,THE WOODMAN,On larks. The sedentary clerk
8110,THE WOODMAN,All morning with a diligent pen
8111,THE WOODMAN,Murders the babes of other men;
8112,THE WOODMAN,"And like the beasts of wood and park,"
8113,THE WOODMAN,"Protects his whelps, defends his den."
8114,THE WOODMAN,
8115,THE WOODMAN,Unshamed the narrow aim I hold;
8116,THE WOODMAN,"I feed my sheep, patrol my fold;"
8117,THE WOODMAN,"Breathe war on wolves and rival flocks,"
8118,THE WOODMAN,A pious outlaw on the rocks
8119,THE WOODMAN,Of God and morning; and when time
8120,THE WOODMAN,"Shall bow, or rivals break me, climb"
8121,THE WOODMAN,"Where no undubbed civilian dares,"
8122,THE WOODMAN,"In my war harness, the loud stairs"
8123,THE WOODMAN,Of honour; and my conqueror
8124,THE WOODMAN,Hail me a warrior fallen in war.
