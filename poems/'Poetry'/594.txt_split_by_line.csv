68,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
69,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"One hundred years' and one ago, in Boston, at ten of the clock one April"
70,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"night, a church steeple had been climbed and a lantern hung out."
71,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
72,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At ten, the same night, in mid-river of the Charles, oarsmen two, with"
73,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"passenger silent and grim, had seen the signal light out-swung, and"
74,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,rowed with speed for the Charlestown shore.
75,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
76,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At eleven, the moon was risen, and the grim passenger, Paul Revere, had"
77,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"ridden up the Neck, encountered a foe, who opposed his ride into the"
78,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"country, and, after a brief delay, rode on, leaving a British officer"
79,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,lying in a clay pit.
80,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
81,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At mid-night, a hundred ears had heard the flying horseman cry, ""Up and"
82,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"arm. The Regulars are coming out!"""
83,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
84,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,You know the story well. You have heard how the wild alarm ran from
85,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"voice to voice and echoed beneath every roof, until the men of Lexington"
86,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,and Concord were stirred and aroused with patriotic fear for the safety
87,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,of the public stores that had been committed to their keeping.
88,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
89,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"You know how, long ere the chill April day began to dawn, they had"
90,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"drawn, by horse power and by hand power, the cherished stores into safe"
91,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,hiding-places in the depth of friendly forest-coverts.
92,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
93,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,There is one thing about that day that you have NOT heard and I will
94,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"tell you now. It is, how one little woman staid in the town of Concord,"
95,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,whence all the women save her had fled.
96,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
97,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"All the houses that were standing then, are very old-fashioned now, but"
98,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,there was one dwelling-place on Concord Common that was old-fashioned
99,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"even then! It was the abode of Martha Moulton and ""Uncle John."" Just who"
100,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Uncle John"" was, is not now known, but he was probably Martha Moulton's"
101,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"uncle. The uncle, it appears by record, was eighty-five years old; while"
102,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,the niece was ONLY three-score and eleven.
103,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
104,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Once and again that morning, a friendly hand had pulled the latch-string"
105,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,at Martha Moulton's kitchen entrance and offered to convey herself and
106,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"treasures away, but, to either proffer, she had said: ""No, I must stay"
107,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"until Uncle John gets the cricks out of his back, if all the British"
108,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"soldiers in the land march into town."""
109,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
110,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At last, came Joe Devins, a lad of fifteen years--Joe's two astonished"
111,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"eyes peered for a moment into Martha Moulton's kitchen, and then eyes"
112,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"and owner dashed into the room, to learn, what the sight he there saw,"
113,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,could mean.
114,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
115,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Whew! Mother Moulton, what are you doing?"""
116,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
117,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I'm getting Uncle John his breakfast to be sure, Joe,"" she answered."
118,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Have you seen so many sights this morning that you don't know"
119,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"breakfast, when you see it? Have a care there, for hot fat WILL burn,"""
120,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"as she deftly poured the contents of a pan, fresh from the fire, into a"
121,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,dish.
122,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
123,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Hungry Joe had been astir since the first drum had beat to arms at two
124,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,of the clock. He gave one glance at the boiling cream and the slices
125,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"of crisp pork swimming in it, as he gasped forth the words, ""Getting"
126,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"breakfast in Concord THIS morning! MOTHER MOULTON, you MUST be crazy."""
127,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
128,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""So they tell me,"" she said, serenely. ""There comes Uncle John!"" she"
129,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"added, as the clatter of a staff on the stone steps of the stairway"
130,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"outrang, for an instant, the cries of hurrying and confusion that filled"
131,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,the air of the street.
132,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
133,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Don't you know, Mother Moulton,"" Joe went on to say, ""that every single"
134,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"woman and child have been carried off, where the Britishers won't find"
135,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"'em?"""
136,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
137,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I don't believe the king's troops have stirred out of Boston,"" she"
138,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"replied, going to the door leading to the stone staircase, to open it"
139,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,for Uncle John.
140,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
141,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Don't believe it?"" and Joe looked, as he echoed the words, as though"
142,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"only a boy could feel sufficient disgust at such want of common sense,"
143,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"in full view of the fact, that Reuben Brown had just brought the news"
144,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"that eight men had been killed by the king's Red-coats, in Lexington,"
145,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,which fact he made haste to impart.
146,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
147,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I won't believe a word of it,"" she said, stoutly, ""until I see the"
148,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"soldiers coming."""
149,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
150,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Ah! Hear that!"" cried Joe, tossing back his hair and swinging his arms"
151,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"triumphantly at an airy foe. ""You won't have to wait long. THAT"
152,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,SIGNAL is for the minute men. They are going to march out to meet the
153,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Red-coats. Wish I was a minute man, this minute."""
154,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
155,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Meanwhile, poor Uncle John was getting down the steps of the stairway,"
156,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"with many a grimace and groan. As he touched the floor, Joe, his face"
157,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"beaming with excitement and enthusiasm, sprang to place a chair for him"
158,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"at the table, saying, ""Good morning!"" at the same moment."
159,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
160,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""May be,"" groaned Uncle John, ""youngsters LIKE YOU may think it is a"
161,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"good morning, but I DON'T, such a din and clatter as the fools have kept"
162,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"up all night long. If I had the power"" (and now the poor old man fairly"
163,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"groaned with rage), ""I'd make 'em quiet long enough to let an old man"
164,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"get a wink of sleep, when the rheumatism lets go."""
165,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
166,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I'm real sorry for you,"" said Joe, ""but you don't know the news. The"
167,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"king's troops, from camp, in Boston, are marching right down here, to"
168,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"carry off all our arms that they can find."""
169,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
170,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Are they?"" was the sarcastic rejoined. ""It's the best news I've heard"
171,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"in a long while. Wish they had my arms, this minute. They wouldn't carry"
172,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"them a step farther than they could help, I know. Run and tell them mine"
173,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"are ready, Joe."""
174,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
175,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""But, Uncle John, wait till after breakfast, you'll want to use them"
176,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"once more,"" said Martha Moulton, trying to help him into the chair that"
177,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Joe had placed on the white sanded floor.
178,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
179,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Meanwhile, Joe Devins had ears for all the sounds that penetrated"
180,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"the kitchen from out of doors, and he had eyes for the slices of"
181,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,well-browned pork and the golden hued Johnny-cake lying before the
182,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,glowing coals on the broad hearth.
183,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
184,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"As the little woman bent to take up the breakfast, Joe, intent on doing"
185,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"some kindness for her in the way of saving treasures, asked, ""Shan't I"
186,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"help you, Mother Moulton?"""
187,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
188,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I reckon I am not so old that I can't lift a mite of cornbread,"" she"
189,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,replied with chilling severity.
190,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
191,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Oh, I didn't mean to lift THAT THING,"" he made haste to explain, ""but"
192,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"to carry off things and hide 'em away, as everybody else has been doing"
193,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,half the night. I know a first-rate place up in the woods. Used to be a
194,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"honey tree, you know, and it's just as hollow as anything. Silver"
195,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"spoons and things would be just as safe in it--"" but Joe's words were"
196,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,interrupted by unusual tumult on the street and he ran off to learn the
197,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"news, intending to return and get the breakfast that had been offered to"
198,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,him.
199,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
200,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Presently he rushed back to the house with cheeks aflame and eyes ablaze
201,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"with excitement. ""They're a coming!"" he cried. ""They're in sight down by"
202,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"the rocks. They see 'em marching, the men on the hill, do!"""
203,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
204,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""You don't mean that its really true that the soldiers are coming here,"
205,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"RIGHT INTO OUR TOWN,"" cried Martha Moulton, rising in haste and bringing"
206,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"together with rapid flourishes to right and to left, every fragment"
207,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,of silver on the table. Uncle John strove to hold fast his individual
208,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"spoon, but she twitched it without ceremony out from his rheumatic old"
209,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"fingers, and ran next to the parlor cupboard, wherein lay her movable"
210,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,valuables.
211,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
212,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""What in the world shall I do with them,"" she cried, returning with her"
213,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"apron well filled with treasures, and borne down by the weight thereof."
214,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
215,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Give 'em to me,"" cried Joe. ""Here's a basket, drop 'em in, and I'll run"
216,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"like a brush-fire through the town and across the old bridge, and hide"
217,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"'em as safe as a weasel's nap."""
218,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
219,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Joe's fingers were creamy; his mouth was half filled with Johnny-cake,"
220,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"and his pocket on the right bulged to its utmost capacity with the same,"
221,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,as he held forth the basket; but the little woman was afraid to trust
222,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"him, as she had been afraid to trust her neighbors."
223,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
224,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""No! No!"" she replied, to his repeated offers. ""I know what I'll do."
225,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"You, Joe Devins, stay right where you are till I come back, and, don't"
226,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"you ever LOOK out of the window."""
227,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
228,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Dear, dear me!"" she cried, flushed and anxious when she was out of"
229,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"sight of Uncle John and Joe. ""I WISH I'd given 'em to Col. Barrett when"
230,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"he was here before daylight, only, I WAS afraid I should never get sight"
231,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"of them again."""
232,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
233,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"She drew off one of her stockings, filled it, tied the opening at the"
234,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,top with a string-plunged stocking and all into a pail full of water and
235,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,proceeded to pour the contents into the well.
236,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
237,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Just as the dark circle had closed over the blue stockings, Joe Devin's"
238,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"face peered down the depths by her side, and his voice sounded out the"
239,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"words: ""O Mother Moulton, the British will search the wells the VERY"
240,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"first thing. Of course, they EXPECT to find things in wells!"""
241,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
242,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Why didn't you tell me before, Joe? but now it is too late."""
243,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
244,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I would, if I'd known what you was going to do; they'd been a sight"
245,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"safer, in the honey tree."""
246,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
247,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Yes, and what a fool I've been--flung MY WATCH into the well with the"
248,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"spoons!"""
249,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
250,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Well, well! Don't stand there, looking,"" as she hovered over the high"
251,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"curb, with her hand on the bucket. ""Everybody will know, if you do,"
252,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"there."""
253,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
254,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Martha! Martha?"" shrieked Uncle John's quavering voice from the house"
255,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,door.
256,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
257,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Bless my heart!"" she exclaimed, hurrying back over the stones."
258,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
259,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""What's the matter with your heart?"" questioned Joe."
260,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
261,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Nothing. I was thinking of Uncle John's money,"" she answered."
262,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
263,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Has he got money?"" cried Joe. ""I thought he was poor, and you took care"
264,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"of him because you were so good."""
265,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
266,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Not one word that Joe uttered did the little woman hear. She was already
267,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,by Uncle John's side and asking him for the key to his strong box.
268,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
269,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Uncle John's rheumatism was terribly exasperating. ""No, I won't give"
270,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"it to you!"" he cried, ""and nobody shall have it as long as I'm above"
271,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"ground."""
272,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
273,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Then the soldiers will carry it off,"" she said."
274,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
275,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Let 'em!"" was his reply, grasping his staff firmly with both hands and"
276,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"gleaming defiance out of his wide, pale eyes. ""YOU won't get the key,"
277,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"even if they do."""
278,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
279,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At this instant, a voice at the doorway shouted the words, ""Hide, hide"
280,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"away somewhere, Mother Moulton, for the Red-coats are in sight this"
281,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"minute!"""
282,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
283,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"She heard the warning, and giving one glance at Uncle John, which look"
284,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"was answered by another, ""no, you won't have it,"" she grasped Joe Devins"
285,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"by the collar of his jacket and thrust him before her up the staircase,"
286,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"so quickly that the boy had no chance to speak, until she released her"
287,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,hold at the entrance to Uncle John's room.
288,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
289,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"The idea of being taken prisoner in such a manner, and by a woman, too,"
290,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"was too much for the lad's endurance. ""Let me go!"" he cried, the instant"
291,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"he could recover his breath. ""I won't hide away in your garret, like a"
292,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"woman, I won't. I want to see the militia and the minute men fight the"
293,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"troops, I do."""
294,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
295,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Help me first, Joe. Here, quick now; let's get this box out and up"
296,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"garret. We'll hide it under the corn and it'll be safe,"" she coaxed."
297,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
298,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,The box was under Uncle John's bed.
299,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
300,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""What's in the old thing any how?"" questioned Joe, pulling with all his"
301,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,strength at it.
302,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
303,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"The box, or chest, was painted red, and was bound about by massive iron"
304,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,bands.
305,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
306,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I've never seen the inside of it,"" said Mother Moulton. ""It holds the"
307,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"poor old soul's sole treasure, and I DO want to save it for him if I"
308,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"can."""
309,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
310,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"They had drawn it with much hard endeavor, as far as the garret stairs,"
311,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"but their united strength failed to lift it. ""Heave it, now!"" cried Joe,"
312,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,and lo! it was up two steps. So they turned it over and over with many a
313,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"thudding thump; every one of which thumps Uncle John heard, and believed"
314,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"to be strokes upon the box itself to burst it asunder, until it was"
315,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,fairly shelved on the garret floor.
316,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
317,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"In the very midst of the overturnings, a voice from below had been"
318,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"heard crying out, ""Let my box alone! Don't break it open. If you do,"
319,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"I'll--I'll--"" but, whatever the poor man MEANT to threaten as a penalty,"
320,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,he could not think of anything half severe enough to say and so left it
321,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,uncertain as to the punishment that might be looked for.
322,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
323,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Poor old soul!"" ejaculated the little woman, her soft white curls in"
324,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"disorder and the pink color rising from her cheeks to her fair forehead,"
325,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,as she bent to help Joe drag the box beneath the rafter's edge.
326,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
327,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Now, Joe,"" she said, ""we'll heap nubbins over it, and if the soldiers"
328,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,want corn they'll take good ears and never think of touching poor
329,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"nubbins""; so they fell to work throwing corn over the red chest, until"
330,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,it was completely concealed from view.
331,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
332,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Then he sprang to the high-up-window ledge in the point of the roof and
333,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"took one glance out. ""Oh, I see them, the Red-coats. True's I live,"
334,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,there go the militia UP THE HILL. I thought they was going to stand and
335,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"defend. Shame on 'em, I say."" Jumping down and crying back to Mother"
336,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Moulton, ""I'm going to stand by the minute men,"" he went down, three"
337,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"steps at a leap, and nearly overturned Uncle John on the stairs, who,"
338,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,with many groans was trying to get to the defense of his strong box.
339,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
340,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""What did you help her for, you scamp,"" he demanded of Joe, flourishing"
341,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,his staff unpleasantly near the lad's head.
342,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
343,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""'Cause she asked me to, and couldn't do it alone,"" returned Joe,"
344,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"dodging the stick and disappearing from the scene, at the very moment"
345,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Martha Moulton encountered Uncle John.
346,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
347,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Your strong box is safe under nubbins in the garret, unless the house"
348,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"burns down, and now that you are up here, you had better stay,"" she"
349,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"added soothingly, as she hastened by him to reach the kitchen below."
350,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
351,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Once there, she paused a second or two to take resolution regarding her"
352,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"next act. She knew full well that there was not one second to spare,"
353,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"and yet she stood looking, apparently, into the glowing embers on the"
354,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"hearth. She was flushed and excited, both by the unwonted toil, and"
355,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,the coming events. Cobwebs from the rafters had fallen on her hair and
356,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"home-spun dress, and would readily have betrayed her late occupation, to"
357,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,any discerning soldier of the king.
358,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
359,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"A smile broke suddenly over her face, displacing for a brief second"
360,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"every trace of care. ""It's my only weapon, and I must use it,"" she"
361,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"said, making a stately courtesy to an imaginary guest and straightway"
362,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,disappeared within an adjoining room. With buttoned door and dropped
363,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,curtains the little woman made haste to array herself in her finest
364,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"raiment. In five minutes she reappeared in the kitchen, a picture"
365,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"pleasant to look at. In all New England, there could not be a more"
366,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,beautiful little old lady than Martha Moulton was that day. Her hair was
367,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"guiltless now of cobwebs, but haloed her face with fluffy little curls"
368,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"of silvery whiteness, above which, like a crown, was a little cap of"
369,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"dotted muslin, pure as snow. Her erect figure, not a particle of the"
370,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"hard-working-day in it now, carried well the folds of a sheeny, black"
371,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"silk gown, over which she had tied an apron as spotless as the cap."
372,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
373,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,As she fastened back her gown and hurried away the signs of the
374,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"breakfast she had not eaten, the clear pink tints seemed to come out"
375,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,with added beauty of coloring in her cheeks; while her hair seemed
376,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,fairer and whiter than at any moment in her three-score and eleven
377,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,years.
378,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
379,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Once more Joe Devins looked in. As he caught a glimpse of the picture
380,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"she made, he paused to cry out: ""All dressed up to meet the robbers! My,"
381,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,how fine you do look! I wouldn't. I'd go and hide behind the nubbins.
382,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"They'll be here in less than five minutes now,"" he cried, ""and I'm going"
383,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"over the North Bridge to see what's going on there."""
384,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
385,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""O Joe, stay, won't you?"" she urged, but the lad was gone, and she"
386,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"was left alone to meet the foe, comforting herself with the thought,"
387,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""They'll treat me with more respect if I LOOK respectable, and if I must"
388,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"die, I'll die good-looking in my best clothes, anyhow."""
389,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
390,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"She threw a few sticks of hickory-wood on the embers, and then drew"
391,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"out the little round stand, on which the family Bible was always lying."
392,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Recollecting that the British soldiers probably belonged to the Church
393,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"of England, she hurried away to fetch Uncle John's ""prayer-book."""
394,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
395,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""They'll have respect to me, if they find me reading that, I know,"""
396,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"she thought. Having drawn the round stand within sight of the well, and"
397,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"where she could also command a view of the staircase, she sat and waited"
398,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,for coming events.
399,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
400,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Uncle John was keeping watch of the advancing troops from an upper
401,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"window. ""Martha,"" he called, ""you'd better come up. They're close by,"
402,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"now."" To tell the truth, Uncle John himself was a little afraid; that"
403,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"is to say he hadn't quite courage enough to go down, and, perhaps,"
404,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,encounter his own rheumatism and the king's soldiers on the same
405,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"stairway, and yet, he felt that he must defend Martha as well as he"
406,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,could.
407,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
408,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"The rap of a musket, quick and ringing on the front door, startled the"
409,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,little woman from her apparent devotions. She did not move at the call
410,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,of anything so profane. It was the custom of the time to have the front
411,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"door divided into two parts, the lower half and the upper half. The"
412,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"former was closed and made fast, the upper could be swung open at will."
413,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
414,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"The soldier getting no reply, and doubtless thinking that the house was"
415,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"deserted, leaped over the chained lower half of the door."
416,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
417,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"At the clang of his bayonet against the brass trimmings, Martha Moulton"
418,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"groaned in spirit, for, if there was any one thing that she deemed"
419,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"essential to her comfort in this life, it was to keep spotless,"
420,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"speckless and in every way unharmed, the great knocker on her front"
421,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,door.
422,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
423,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Good, sound English metal, too,"" she thought, ""that an English soldier"
424,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"ought to know how to respect."""
425,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
426,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,As she heard the tramp of coming feet she only bent the closer over the
427,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Book of Prayer that lay open on her knee. Not one word did she read or
428,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,see; she was inwardly trembling and outwardly watching the well and the
429,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"staircase. But now, above all other sounds, broke the noise of Uncle"
430,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"John's staff thrashing the upper step of the staircase, and the shrill"
431,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"tremulous cry of the old man defiant, doing his utmost for the defense"
432,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,of his castle.
433,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
434,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,The fingers that lay beneath the book tingled with desire to box the
435,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"old man's ears, for the policy he was pursuing would be fatal to the"
436,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,treasure in garret and in well; but she was forced to silence and
437,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,inactivity.
438,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
439,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"As the King's troops, Major Pitcairn at their head, reached the open"
440,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"door and saw the old lady, they paused. What could they do but look, for"
441,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"a moment, at the unexpected sight that met their view; a placid old lady"
442,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"in black silk and dotted muslin, with all the sweet solemnity of morning"
443,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,devotion hovering about the tidy apartment and seeming to centre at the
444,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"round stand by which she sat, this pretty woman, with pink and white"
445,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,face surmounted with fleecy little curls and crinkles and wisps of
446,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"floating whiteness, who looked up to meet their gaze with such innocent"
447,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,prayer-suffused eyes.
448,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
449,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Good morning, Mother,"" said Major Pitcairn, raising his hat."
450,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
451,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Good morning, gentlemen and soldiers,"" returned Martha Moulton. ""You"
452,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"will pardon my not meeting you at the door, when you see that I was"
453,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"occupied in rendering service to the Lord of all."" She reverently closed"
454,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"the book, laid it on the table, and arose, with a stately bearing, to"
455,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,demand their wishes.
456,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
457,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""We're hungry, good woman,"" spoke the commander, ""and your hearth is"
458,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,the only hospitable one we've seen since we left Boston. With your good
459,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"leave I'll take a bit of this, and he stooped to lift up the Johnny-cake"
460,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,that had been all this while on the hearth.
461,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
462,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I wish I had something better to offer you,"" she said, making haste to"
463,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"fetch plates and knives from the corner-cupboard, and all the while she"
464,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"was keeping eye-guard over the well. ""I'm afraid the Concorders haven't"
465,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"left much for you to-day,"" she added, with a soft sigh of regret, as"
466,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,though she really felt sorry that such brave men and good soldiers had
467,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,fallen on hard times in the ancient town. At the moment she had brought
468,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"forth bread and baked beans, and was putting them on the table, a voice"
469,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"rang into the room, causing every eye to turn toward Uncle John. He"
470,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"had gotten down the stairs without uttering one audible groan, and was"
471,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"standing, one step above the floor of the room, brandishing and whirling"
472,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"his staff about in a manner to cause even rheumatism to flee the place,"
473,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"while, at the top of his voice he cried out:"
474,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
475,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Martha Moulton, how DARE you FEED these--these--monsters--in human"
476,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"form!"""
477,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
478,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Don't mind him, gentlemen, please don't,"" she made haste to say, ""he's"
479,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"old, VERY old; eighty-five, his last birthday, and--a little hoity-toity"
480,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"at times,"" pointing deftly with her finger in the region of the"
481,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,reasoning powers in her own shapely head.
482,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
483,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Summoning Major Pitcairn by an offer of a dish of beans, she contrived"
484,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"to say, under covert of it:"
485,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
486,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""You see, sir, I couldn't go away and leave him; he is almost distracted"
487,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"with rheumatism, and this excitement to-day will kill him, I'm afraid."""
488,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
489,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Advancing toward the staircase with bold and soldierly front, Major"
490,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Pitcairn said to Uncle John:
491,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
492,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Stand aside, old man, and we'll hold you harmless."""
493,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
494,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""I don't believe you will, you red-trimmed trooper, you,"" was the reply;"
495,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"and, with a dexterous swing of the wooden staff, he mowed off and down"
496,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,three military hats.
497,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
498,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Before any one had time to speak, Martha Moulton adroitly stooping, as"
499,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"though to recover Major Pitcairn's hat, which had rolled to her feet,"
500,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"swung the stairway-door into its place with a resounding bang, and"
501,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,followed up that achievement with a swift turn of two large wooden
502,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"buttons, one high up, and the other low down, near the floor."
503,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
504,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""There!"" she said, ""he is safe out of mischief for awhile, and your"
505,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"heads are safe as well. Pardon a poor old man, who does not know what he"
506,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"is about."""
507,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
508,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""He seems to know remarkably well,"" exclaimed an officer."
509,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
510,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Meanwhile, behind the strong door, Uncle John's wrath knew no bounds."
511,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"In his frantic endeavors to burst the fastenings of the wooden buttons,"
512,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"rheumatic cramps seized him and carried the day, leaving him out of the"
513,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,battle.
514,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
515,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Meanwhile, a portion of the soldiery clustered about the door. The"
516,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"king's horses were fed within five feet of the great brass knocker,"
517,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"while, within the house, the beautiful little old woman, in her"
518,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Sunday-best-raiment, tried to do the dismal honors of the day to the"
519,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"foes of her country. Watching her, one would have thought she was"
520,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"entertaining heroes returned from the achievement of valiant deeds,"
521,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"whereas, in her own heart, she knew full well that she was giving a"
522,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,little to save much.
523,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
524,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Nothing could exceed the seeming alacrity with which she fetched water
525,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"from the well for the officers: and, when Major Pitcairn gallantly"
526,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"ordered his men to do the service, the little soul was in alarm; she was"
527,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"so afraid that ""somehow, in some way or another, the blue stocking would"
528,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"get hitched on to the bucket."" She knew that she must to its rescue, and"
529,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"so she bravely acknowledged herself to have taken a vow (when, she did"
530,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"not say), to draw all the water that was taken from that well."
531,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
532,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""A remnant of witchcraft!"" remarked a soldier within hearing."
533,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
534,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""Do I look like a witch?"" she demanded."
535,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
536,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"""If you do,"" replied Major Pitcairn, ""I admire New England witches, and"
537,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"never would condemn one to be hung, or burned, or--smothered."""
538,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
539,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Martha Moulton never wore so brilliant a color on her aged cheeks as at
540,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"that moment. She felt bitter shame at the ruse she had attempted, but"
541,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"silver spoons were precious, and, to escape the smile that went around"
542,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"at Major Pitcairn's words, she was only too glad to go again to the well"
543,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"and dip slowly the high, over-hanging sweep into the cool, clear, dark"
544,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,depth below.
545,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
546,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"During this time the cold, frosty morning spent itself into the"
547,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"brilliant, shining noon."
548,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
549,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,You know what happened at Concord on that 19th of April in the year
550,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"1775. You have been told the story, how the men of Acton met and"
551,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"resisted the king's troops at the old North Bridge, how brave Captain"
552,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Davis and minute-man Hosmer fell, how the sound of their falling struck"
553,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"down to the very heart of mother earth, and caused her to send forth her"
554,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"brave sons to cry ""Liberty, or Death!"""
555,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
556,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,And the rest of the story; the sixty or more barrels of flour that the
557,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"king's troops found and struck the heads from, leaving the flour in"
558,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"condition to be gathered again at nightfall, the arms and powder that"
559,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"they destroyed, the houses they burned; all these, are they not recorded"
560,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,in every child's history in the land?
561,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
562,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"While these things were going on, for a brief while, at mid-day, Martha"
563,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"Moulton found her home deserted. She had not forgotten poor, suffering,"
564,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"irate Uncle John in the regions above, and, so, the very minute she had"
565,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"the chance, she made a strong cup of catnip tea (the real tea, you know,"
566,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,was brewing in Boston harbor).
567,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
568,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"She turned the buttons, and, with a bit of trembling at her heart, such"
569,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"as she had not felt all day, she ventured up the stairs, bearing the"
570,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,steaming peace-offering before her.
571,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,
572,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,Uncle John was writhing under the sharp thorns and twinges of his old
573,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"enemy, and in no frame of mind to receive any overtures in the shape of"
574,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,"catnip tea; nevertheless, he was watching, as well as he was able, the"
575,THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.,motions of the enemy. As she drew near he cried out:

1172,KENTUCKY BELLE.,And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.
1173,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1174,KENTUCKY BELLE.,I was at work that morning.  Some one came riding like mad
1175,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Over the bridge and up the road--Farmer Rouf's little lad;
1176,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say;
1177,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"""Morgan's men are coming, Frau; they're galloping on this way;"
1178,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1179,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"""I'm sent to warn the neighbors.  He isn't a mile behind;"

1181,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Morgan, Morgan, the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,"
1182,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"With bowie-knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen."""
1183,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1184,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;"
1185,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;"
1186,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone;"
1187,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!"
1188,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1189,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Sudden I picked up the baby, and ran to the pasture-bar;"
1190,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"""Kentuck!"" I called; ""Kentucky!"" She knew me ever so far!"
1191,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,"
1192,KENTUCKY BELLE.,And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.
1193,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1194,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"As I ran back to the log-house, at once there came a sound--"
1195,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--"
1196,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--
1197,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men."
1198,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1199,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm!"
1200,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But still I stood in the doorway, with baby on my arm."
1201,KENTUCKY BELLE.,They came; they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped
1202,KENTUCKY BELLE.,along--
1203,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band six hundred strong."
1204,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1205,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through"
1206,KENTUCKY BELLE.,day;
1207,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,"
1208,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"To the border-strip where Virginia runs up into the West,"
1209,KENTUCKY BELLE.,To ford the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.
1210,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1211,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;"
1212,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways"
1213,KENTUCKY BELLE.,glance;
1214,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,"
1215,KENTUCKY BELLE.,When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.
1216,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1217,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,"
1218,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place:"
1219,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see;"
1220,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Faint and worn; with dim blue eyes, and he'd sailed on the"
1221,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Tennessee.
1222,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1223,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son--"
1224,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!
1225,KENTUCKY BELLE.,The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish
1226,KENTUCKY BELLE.,mouth;
1227,KENTUCKY BELLE.,And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South!
1228,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1229,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"O, pluck was he to the backbone; and clear grit through and"
1230,KENTUCKY BELLE.,through;
1231,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't
1232,KENTUCKY BELLE.,do;
1233,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The boy was dying sir, dying, as plain as plain could be,"
1234,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.
1235,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1236,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But, when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,"
1237,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Water came into his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth;"
1238,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"""Do you know the Blue-Grass country?"" he wistfully began to say;"
1239,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away."
1240,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1241,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I had him into the log-house, and worked and brought him to;"
1242,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;"
1243,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And, when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,"
1244,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Morgan's men were miles away, galloping, galloping on."
1245,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1246,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"""O, I must go,"" he muttered; ""I must be up and away!"
1247,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Morgan, Morgan is waiting for me!  O, what will Morgan say?"""
1248,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But I heard the sound of tramping, and kept him back from the"
1249,KENTUCKY BELLE.,door--
1250,KENTUCKY BELLE.,The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.
1251,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1252,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And on, on came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--"
1253,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And fast they rode, and back they looked, galloping rapidly;"
1254,KENTUCKY BELLE.,They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day
1255,KENTUCKY BELLE.,and night;
1256,KENTUCKY BELLE.,But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.
1257,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1258,KENTUCKY BELLE.,And rich Ohio sat startled through all these summer days;
1259,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways;"
1260,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east,"
1261,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"now west,"
1262,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Through river-valleys and corn-land farms, sweeping away her"
1263,KENTUCKY BELLE.,best.
1264,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1265,KENTUCKY BELLE.,A bold ride and a long ride!  But they were taken at last;
1266,KENTUCKY BELLE.,They had almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;
1267,KENTUCKY BELLE.,But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the
1268,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"ford,"
1269,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword."
1270,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1271,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Well, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--"
1272,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still;"
1273,KENTUCKY BELLE.,When it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell--
1274,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But I stole down to the gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle."
1275,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1276,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty, gentle lass--"
1277,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But I knew that she'd be happy, back in the old Blue-Grass:"
1278,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,"
1279,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And Kentucky, pretty Kentucky, I gave to the worn-out lad."
1280,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1281,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"I guided him to the southward, as well as I knew how:"
1282,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;"
1283,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell;"
1284,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!"
1285,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1286,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high,"
1287,KENTUCKY BELLE.,Baby and I were both crying--I couldn't tell him why--
1288,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,"
1289,KENTUCKY BELLE.,And a thin old horse with drooping head stood in Kentucky's
1290,KENTUCKY BELLE.,stall.
1291,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1292,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me,"
1293,KENTUCKY BELLE.,He knew I couldn't help it--'twas all for the Tennessee;
1294,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--"
1295,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"A letter, sir, and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass."
1296,KENTUCKY BELLE.,
1297,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"The lad got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;"
1298,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"And Kentuck she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;"
1299,KENTUCKY BELLE.,"He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or"
1300,KENTUCKY BELLE.,spur;

1387,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1388,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""I--I--was just seeing--how hard I could hit my hand--without crying;"""
1389,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,and he disappeared around the side of the house before mamma could ask

1391,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1392,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"The next day Tommy's seatmate, Dicky Ray, was naughty in school, and"
1393,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Miss Linnet called him up, opened her desk, took out a little riding"
1394,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,whip--it was a bright blue one--and then and there administered
1395,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"punishment. And because he cried, when recess came, Tommy said: ""Isn't"
1396,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Dick Ray just a reg'lar girl cry-baby?"" (He had learned that word from"
1397,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"some of the big boys, but, mind you! he never dared to say it before his"

1399,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1400,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Dick's face flushed with anger. ""Never you mind, Tommy Brown,"" said"

1403,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1404,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"And blue-eyed Daisy, who was the idol of their hearts, nodded her curly"

1406,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,bit s'prised if he'd holler so loud that hey would hear him way down in
1407,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Colorado."""
1408,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1409,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Tommy stood aghast! for, really and truly, he wasn't quite so"
1410,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,stony-hearted a little mortal as he appeared to be; he had been secretly
1411,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"rather sorry for Dick, but--he wanted Daisy to think that he himself was"
1412,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"big and manly, and he had the opinion that this was just the way to win"
1413,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,her admiration. But all this time HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT DAISY DID--that
1414,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Dick's pockets were full of sugar-plums; tiptop ones too, for Daisy had"
1415,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"tasted them, and knew that little packets of them would from time to"
1416,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,time find their way into her chubby hand.
1417,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1418,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"All the rest of the morning Tommy kept thinking, thinking, thinking."
1419,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,One thing was certain: the present situation was not to be endured
1420,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,one moment longer than was absolutely necessary. But what could he do?
1421,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Should he fight Dicky? This plan was rejected at once, on high, moral"
1422,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"grounds. Well, then, supposing some dark night he should see Daisy on"
1423,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"the street, just grab her, hold on tight and say: ""Now, Daisy Rivers, I"
1424,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,won't let you go till you promise you'll like me a great deal betterer
1425,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"than you do Dick Ray."" There seemed something nice about this plan, very"
1426,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"nice; the more Tommy thought of it, the better he liked it; only there"
1427,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,were two objections to it. Firstly: Daisy never by any chance ventured
1428,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,out doors after dark. Secondly: Neither did Tom.
1429,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1430,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Both objections being insurmountable, this delightful scheme was"
1431,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"reluctantly abandoned, and the thinking process went on harder than"
1432,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"ever, till at last--oh, oh! if he only dared! What a triumph it would"
1433,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"be! But then he couldn't--yes, he could too. Didn't she say that she"
1434,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""wouldn't be one bit s'prised if he hollered so loud that they would"
1435,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"hear him way down in Colorado?"" Colorado, indeed! He'd show her there"
1436,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,was one boy in the school who wasn't a girl-cry-baby!
1437,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1438,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Yes, actually, foolish Tommy had decided to prove his manhood by being"

1440,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,very afternoon!
1441,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1442,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,What did he do? He whispered six times!
1443,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1444,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Had it been any other child, he would surely have been punished; but"
1445,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Miss Linnet knew both Tommy and his mamma quite well, and therefore"
1446,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"she knew also, quite well, that only a few days ago the one horror of"
1447,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Tommy's life had been the thought that he might possibly be whipped.
1448,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Then too, it was his first term at school, and hitherto he had been very"
1449,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,good. So she decided to keep him after school and talk to him of the
1450,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"sinfulness of bad conduct in general, and of whispering in particular."
1451,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"This plan she faithfully carried out, and the little culprit's heart so"
1452,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"melted within him that he climbed up on his teacher's lap, put his arms"
1453,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"around her neck and kissed her, crying he would never be so naughty"
1454,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"again. He was just going to tell her all about Daisy, when in walked a"
1455,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"friend of Miss Linnet's, so he went home instead. The next morning he"
1456,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"started for school with the firm determination to be a good child, and I"
1457,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,really believe he would have been had not that provoking little witch
1458,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"of a Daisy marched past him in a very independent manner, her saucy nose"
1459,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"away up in the air, and a scornful look in the pretty blue eyes. It was"
1460,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,more than flesh and blood could stand. All Tom's good resolutions flew
1461,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,sky-high.
1462,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1463,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,When twelve o'clock came Miss Linnet's list of delinquents begun in this

1466,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,WHISPER MARKS.  Thomas Brown.....   15
1467,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Melinda Jones.....  11
1468,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1469,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,There was great excitement among the little people. How dared any one
1470,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"be so dreadfully bad! Tommy's heart sank, sank, sank, when Miss Linnet"
1471,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"said: ""When school begins this afternoon I shall punish Tommy and"
1472,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Melinda."""
1473,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1474,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"And she did! She called them both up on the platform, made them clasp"
1475,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"hands and stand with their backs against the blackboard, then wrote just"
1476,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,above their heads:
1477,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1478,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Thomas Brown and              Partners in disgrace.
1479,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Melinda Jones                 15 plus 11 = 26.
1480,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1481,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Oh, how mortified and ashamed Tommy was! If only she had whipped him, or"
1482,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,if it had been some other girl. But MELINDA JONES!!! At the end of ten
1483,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,minutes Miss Linnet let them take their seats; but Tommy's heart burned
1484,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,within him. DAISY HAD LAUGHED WHEN HE STOOD THERE HOLDING MELINDA'S
1485,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,HAND! There were deep crimson spots on Tommy's cheeks all that afternoon
1486,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"and a resolute, determined look in his bright brown eyes, but he was"
1487,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,very still and quiet.
1488,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1489,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Later in the day the children were startled by a sudden commotion on
1490,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,the other side of the room. Daisy was writing on her slate and Melinda
1491,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Jones, in passing to her seat, accidentally knocked it out of her hands;"
1492,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"without a moment's hesitation, Daisy, by way of expressing her feelings,"
1493,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"snatched her slate and promptly administered such a sounding ""whack!"""
1494,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,on Melinda's back and shoulders as brought a shriek of anguish from that
1495,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"poor, little unfortunate who began to think that if all the days of her"
1496,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"life were to be like unto this day, existence would certainly prove a"
1497,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,burden.
1498,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1499,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Just about two minutes later Miss Linnet was standing by her desk,"
1500,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"a ruler in one hand and Daisy's open palm in the other, while Daisy"
1501,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"herself, miserable little culprit, stood white and trembling before her."
1502,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"As she raised the ruler to give the first blow, Tommy sprang forward,"
1503,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"placing himself at Daisy's side, put his open palm over hers, and with"
1504,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"tears in his eyes, pleaded in this wise:"
1505,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1506,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""Please, Miss Linnet, whip me instead! She is only just a little girl"
1507,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"and I KNOW she'll cry, it will hurt her so! I'd rather it would be me"
1508,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"every time than Daisy--truly I won't cry. Oh, please whip me!"""
1509,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1510,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"And Miss Linnet did whip him, while Daisy, filled with remorse, clung to"
1511,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"him sobbing as if her heart would break. To be sure, somebody who ought"
1512,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"to know, told me it was the lightest ""feruling"" ever child received; but"
1513,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Daisy and Tommy both assured their mothers that it was the ""dreadfulest,"
1514,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"cruelest, hardest whipping ever was."""
1515,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1516,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""And did my little man cry?"" asked mamma."
1517,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1518,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""No, indeed! I stood up big as I could, looked at Daisy and smiled,"
1519,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"'cause I was so glad it wasn't her."""
1520,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1521,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,Then that proud and happy mamma took him in her arms and kissed him; and
1522,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,right in the midst of the kissing in walked Daisy.
1523,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1524,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"""Would Tommy please come and take supper with her?"""
1525,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1526,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Of course he would, and they walked off hand in hand. When they passed"
1527,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"Dicky's house Tommy suggested. ""S'posing they forgive Dick and let him"
1528,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"go 'long too."" And Daisy agreeing, they called that young gentleman out"
1529,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,and magnanimously informed him that he was forgiven and might come and
1530,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,have supper with them.
1531,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1532,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"What in the world they had to forgive, nobody knows; but then, so long"
1533,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"as forgiveness proved such an eminently satisfactory arrangement, all"
1534,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"round--why, nobody need care."
1535,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,
1536,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,The children waited outside the gate while Dick coaxed his mother to
1537,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"let him go, and standing there, hand in hand, Daisy plucked up heart"
1538,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,of grace and with very rosy cheeks and an air about her of general
1539,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,"penitence, said something very sweet in a very small voice:"
1540,WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.,

1841,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,"minute, now, might be the means of saving her brother's life. And so,"
1842,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,"in an incredibly short time, Blossom reached the Capitol and hastened to"

1876,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,"passed for a minute through Blossom's mind, but she told her simple,"
1877,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,straightforward story and handed Mr. Lincoln Bennie's letter to read.

1879,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,"He read it carefully; then taking up his pen, wrote a few hasty lines,"

1894,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,"Two days after this interview, the young soldier came to the White House"
1895,THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.,with his little sister. He was called into the President's private room

2053,FACING THE WORLD.,
2054,FACING THE WORLD.,"Mrs. Boyd's face as she smiled back at Donald was not exactly ""jolly."""
2055,FACING THE WORLD.,"Still, she did smile; and then there came out the strong likeness often"
2056,FACING THE WORLD.,"seen between mother and son, even when, as in this case, the features"
2057,FACING THE WORLD.,"were very dissimilar. Mrs. Boyd was a pretty, delicate little English"
2058,FACING THE WORLD.,"woman: and Donald took after his father, a big, brawny Scotsman,"
2059,FACING THE WORLD.,"certainly not pretty, and not always sweet. Poor man! he had of late"

2061,FACING THE WORLD.,
2062,FACING THE WORLD.,"Though she tried to smile and succeeded, the tears were in Mrs. Boyd's"

2077,FACING THE WORLD.,"""It goes to my heart to tell you--I have been waiting to say it all"

2084,FACING THE WORLD.,
2085,FACING THE WORLD.,"Mrs. Boyd shook her head sadly, and then explained as briefly and calmly"
2086,FACING THE WORLD.,"as she could the heavy blow which had fallen upon the father, and,"
2087,FACING THE WORLD.,"indeed, upon the whole family. Mr. Boyd had long been troubled with his"
2088,FACING THE WORLD.,"eyes, about as serious a trouble as could have befallen a man in his"
2089,FACING THE WORLD.,profession--an accountant--as they call it in Scotland. Lately he had
2090,FACING THE WORLD.,"made some serious blunders in his arithmetic, and his eyesight was"
2091,FACING THE WORLD.,so weak that his wife persuaded him to consult a first-rate Edinburgh
2092,FACING THE WORLD.,"oculist, whose opinion, given only yesterday, after many days of anxious"
2093,FACING THE WORLD.,"suspense, was that in a few months he would become incurably blind."
2094,FACING THE WORLD.,
2095,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Blind, poor father blind!"" Donald put his hand before his own eyes. He"
2096,FACING THE WORLD.,"was too big a boy to cry, or at any rate, to be seen crying, but it"
2097,FACING THE WORLD.,"was with a choking voice that he spoke next: ""I'll be his eyes; I'm old"
2098,FACING THE WORLD.,"enough."""
2099,FACING THE WORLD.,
2100,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Yes; in many ways you are, my son,"" said Mrs. Boyd, who had had a day"
2101,FACING THE WORLD.,"and a night to face her sorrow, and knew she must do so calmly. ""But you"
2102,FACING THE WORLD.,are not old enough to manage the business; your father will require
2103,FACING THE WORLD.,"to take a partner immediately, which will reduce our income one-half."
2104,FACING THE WORLD.,Therefore we cannot possibly afford to send you to school again. The
2105,FACING THE WORLD.,"little ones must go, they are not nearly educated yet, but you are. You"
2106,FACING THE WORLD.,"will have to face the world and earn your own living, as soon as ever"
2107,FACING THE WORLD.,"you can. My poor boy!"""
2108,FACING THE WORLD.,
2109,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Don't call me poor, mother. I've got you and father and the rest. And,"
2110,FACING THE WORLD.,"as you say, I've had a good education so far. And I'm fifteen and a"
2111,FACING THE WORLD.,"half, no, fifteen and three-quarters--almost a man. I'm not afraid."""
2112,FACING THE WORLD.,
2113,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Nor I,"" said his mother, who had waited a full minute before Donald"
2114,FACING THE WORLD.,"could find voice to say all this, and it was at last stammered out"
2115,FACING THE WORLD.,"awkwardly and at random. ""No; I am not afraid because my boy has to"
2116,FACING THE WORLD.,earn his bread; I had earned mine for years as a governess when father
2117,FACING THE WORLD.,married me. I began work before I was sixteen. My son will have to do
2118,FACING THE WORLD.,"the same, that is all."""
2119,FACING THE WORLD.,
2120,FACING THE WORLD.,That day the mother and son spoke no more together. It was as much
2121,FACING THE WORLD.,"as they could do to bear their trouble, without talking about it, and"
2122,FACING THE WORLD.,"besides, Donald was not a boy to ""make a fuss"" over things. He could"
2123,FACING THE WORLD.,"meet sorrow when it came, that is, the little of it he had ever known,"
2124,FACING THE WORLD.,"but he disliked speaking of it, and perhaps he was right."
2125,FACING THE WORLD.,
2126,FACING THE WORLD.,"So he just ""made himself scarce"" till bedtime, and never said a word"
2127,FACING THE WORLD.,to anybody until his mother came into the boys' room to bid them
2128,FACING THE WORLD.,"good-night. There were three of them, but all were asleep except Donald."
2129,FACING THE WORLD.,"As his mother bent down to kiss him, he put both arms round her neck."
2130,FACING THE WORLD.,
2131,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Mother, I'm going to begin to-morrow."""
2132,FACING THE WORLD.,
2133,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Begin what, my son?"""
2134,FACING THE WORLD.,
2135,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Facing the world, as you said I must. I can't go to school again, so I"
2136,FACING THE WORLD.,"mean to try and earn my own living."""
2137,FACING THE WORLD.,
2138,FACING THE WORLD.,"""How?"""
2139,FACING THE WORLD.,
2140,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I don't quite know, but I'll try. There are several things I could be,"
2141,FACING THE WORLD.,"a clerk--or even a message-boy. I shouldn't like it, but I'd do anything"
2142,FACING THE WORLD.,"rather than do nothing."""
2143,FACING THE WORLD.,
2144,FACING THE WORLD.,Mrs. Boyd sat down on the side of the bed. If she felt inclined to cry
2145,FACING THE WORLD.,she had too much sense to show it. She only took firm hold of her boy's
2146,FACING THE WORLD.,"hand, and waited for him to speak on."
2147,FACING THE WORLD.,
2148,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I've been thinking, mother, I was to have a new suit at Christmas;"
2149,FACING THE WORLD.,"will you give it now? And let it be a coat, not a jacket. I'm tall"
2150,FACING THE WORLD.,"enough--five feet seven last month, and growing still; I should look"
2151,FACING THE WORLD.,almost a man. Then I would go round to every office in Edinburgh and ask
2152,FACING THE WORLD.,if they wanted a clerk. I wouldn't mind taking anything to begin with.
2153,FACING THE WORLD.,"And I can write a decent hand, and I'm not bad at figures; as for my"
2154,FACING THE WORLD.,"Latin and Greek--"""
2155,FACING THE WORLD.,
2156,FACING THE WORLD.,"Here Donald gulped down a sigh, for he was a capital classic, and it had"
2157,FACING THE WORLD.,"been suggested that he should go to Glasgow University and try for ""the"
2158,FACING THE WORLD.,"Snell"" which has sent so many clever young Scotsmen to Balliol College,"
2159,FACING THE WORLD.,"Oxford, and thence on to fame and prosperity. But alas! no college"
2160,FACING THE WORLD.,career was now possible to Donald Boyd. The best he could hope for was
2161,FACING THE WORLD.,"to earn a few shillings a week as a common clerk. He knew this, and so"
2162,FACING THE WORLD.,"did his mother. But they never complained. It was no fault of theirs,"
2163,FACING THE WORLD.,"nor of anybody's. It was just as they devoutly called it, ""The will of"
2164,FACING THE WORLD.,"God."""
2165,FACING THE WORLD.,
2166,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Your Latin and Greek may come in some day, my boy,"" said Mrs. Boyd"
2167,FACING THE WORLD.,"cheerfully. ""Good work is never lost. In the meantime, your plan is a"
2168,FACING THE WORLD.,"good one, and you shall have your new clothes at once. Then, do as you"
2169,FACING THE WORLD.,"think best."""
2170,FACING THE WORLD.,
2171,FACING THE WORLD.,"""All right; good-night, mother,"" said Donald, and in five minutes more"
2172,FACING THE WORLD.,was fast asleep.
2173,FACING THE WORLD.,
2174,FACING THE WORLD.,"But, though he was much given to sleeping of nights--indeed, he never"
2175,FACING THE WORLD.,remembered lying awake for a single hour in his life--during daytime
2176,FACING THE WORLD.,"there never was a more ""wide awake"" boy than Donald Boyd. He kept his"
2177,FACING THE WORLD.,"eyes open to everything, and never let the ""golden minute"" slip by him."
2178,FACING THE WORLD.,He never idled about--play he didn't consider idling (nor do I). And I
2179,FACING THE WORLD.,am bound to confess that every day until the new clothes came home was
2180,FACING THE WORLD.,"scrupulously spent in cricket, football, and all the other amusements"
2181,FACING THE WORLD.,"which he was as good at as he was at his lessons. He wanted ""to make the"
2182,FACING THE WORLD.,"best of his holidays,"" he said, knowing well that for him holiday time"
2183,FACING THE WORLD.,"as well as school time was now done, and the work of the world had begun"
2184,FACING THE WORLD.,in earnest.
2185,FACING THE WORLD.,
2186,FACING THE WORLD.,"The clothes came home on Saturday night, and he went to church in them"
2187,FACING THE WORLD.,"on Sunday, to his little sister's great admiration. Still greater was"
2188,FACING THE WORLD.,"their wonder when, on Monday morning, he appeared in the same suit,"
2189,FACING THE WORLD.,"looking quite a man, as they unanimously agreed, and almost before"
2190,FACING THE WORLD.,"breakfast was done, started off, not saying a word of where he was"
2191,FACING THE WORLD.,going.
2192,FACING THE WORLD.,
2193,FACING THE WORLD.,"He did not come back till the younger ones were all away to bed, so"
2194,FACING THE WORLD.,"there was no one to question him, which was fortunate, for they might"
2195,FACING THE WORLD.,"not have got very smooth answers. His mother saw this, and she also"
2196,FACING THE WORLD.,"forbore. She was not surprised that the bright, brave face of the"
2197,FACING THE WORLD.,"morning looked dull and tired, and that evidently Donald had no good"
2198,FACING THE WORLD.,news of the day to tell her.
2199,FACING THE WORLD.,
2200,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I think I'll go to bed,"" was all he said. ""Mother, will you give me a"
2201,FACING THE WORLD.,'piece' in my pocket to-morrow? One can walk better when one isn't so
2202,FACING THE WORLD.,"desperately hungry."""
2203,FACING THE WORLD.,
2204,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Yes, my boy."" She kissed him, saw that he was warmed and fed--he had"
2205,FACING THE WORLD.,"evidently been on his legs the whole day--then sent him off to his bed,"
2206,FACING THE WORLD.,"where she soon heard him delightfully snoring, oblivious of all his"
2207,FACING THE WORLD.,cares.
2208,FACING THE WORLD.,
2209,FACING THE WORLD.,"The same thing went on day after day, for seven days. Sometimes he told"
2210,FACING THE WORLD.,"his mother what had happened to him and where he had been, sometimes"
2211,FACING THE WORLD.,not; what was the good of telling? It was always the same story. Nobody
2212,FACING THE WORLD.,"wanted a boy or a man, for Donald, trusting to his inches and his"
2213,FACING THE WORLD.,"coat, had applied for man's work also, but in vain. Mrs. Boyd was not"
2214,FACING THE WORLD.,astonished. She knew how hard it is to get one's foot into ever so small
2215,FACING THE WORLD.,"a corner in this busy world, where ten are always struggling for the"
2216,FACING THE WORLD.,"place of one. Still, she also knew that it never does to give in; that"
2217,FACING THE WORLD.,one must leave no stone unturned if one wishes to get work at all. Also
2218,FACING THE WORLD.,"she believed firmly in an axiom of her youth--""Nothing is denied to"
2219,FACING THE WORLD.,"well-directed labor."" But it must be real hard ""labor,"" and it must"
2220,FACING THE WORLD.,"also be ""well directed."" So, though her heart ached sorely, as only a"
2221,FACING THE WORLD.,"mother's can, she never betrayed it, but each morning sent her boy away"
2222,FACING THE WORLD.,"with a cheerful face, and each evening received him with one, which, if"
2223,FACING THE WORLD.,"less cheerful, was not less sympathetic, but she never said a word."
2224,FACING THE WORLD.,
2225,FACING THE WORLD.,"At the week's end, in fact, on Sunday morning, as they were walking to"
2226,FACING THE WORLD.,"church, Donald said to her: ""Mother, my new clothes haven't been of the"
2227,FACING THE WORLD.,"slightest good. I've been all over Edinburgh, to every place I"
2228,FACING THE WORLD.,"could think of--writers' offices, merchants' offices, wharves,"
2229,FACING THE WORLD.,railway-stations--but it's no use. Everybody wants to know where I've
2230,FACING THE WORLD.,"been before, and I've been nowhere except to school. I said I was"
2231,FACING THE WORLD.,"willing to learn, but nobody will teach me; they say they can't afford"
2232,FACING THE WORLD.,"it. It is like keeping a dog, and barking yourself. Which is only too"
2233,FACING THE WORLD.,"true,"" added Donald, with a heavy sigh."
2234,FACING THE WORLD.,
2235,FACING THE WORLD.,"""May be,"" said Mrs. Boyd. Yet as she looked up at her son--she really"
2236,FACING THE WORLD.,"did look up at him, he was so tall--she felt that if his honest,"
2237,FACING THE WORLD.,"intelligent face and manly bearing did not win something at last, what"
2238,FACING THE WORLD.,"was the world coming to? ""My boy,"" she said, ""things are very hard for"
2239,FACING THE WORLD.,"you, but not harder than for others. I remember once, when I was only"
2240,FACING THE WORLD.,"a few years older than you, finding myself with only half a crown in"
2241,FACING THE WORLD.,"my pocket. To be sure it was a whole half-crown, for I had paid every"
2242,FACING THE WORLD.,"half-penny I owed that morning, but I had no idea where the next"
2243,FACING THE WORLD.,"half-crown would come from. However, it did come. I earned two pounds"
2244,FACING THE WORLD.,"ten, the very day after that day."""
2245,FACING THE WORLD.,
2246,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Did you really, mother?"" said Donald, his eyes brightening. ""Then I'll"
2247,FACING THE WORLD.,"go on. I'll not 'gang awa back to my mither,' as that old gentleman"
2248,FACING THE WORLD.,"advised me, who objected to bark himself; a queer, crabbed old fellow he"
2249,FACING THE WORLD.,"was too, but he was the only one who asked my name and address. The rest"
2250,FACING THE WORLD.,"of them--well, mother, I've stood a good deal these seven days,"" Donald"
2251,FACING THE WORLD.,"added, gulping down something between a ""fuff"" of wrath and a sob."
2252,FACING THE WORLD.,
2253,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I am sure you have, my boy."""
2254,FACING THE WORLD.,
2255,FACING THE WORLD.,"""But I'll hold on; only you'll have to get my boots mended, and"
2256,FACING THE WORLD.,"meantime, I should like to try a new dodge. My bicycle, it lies in the"
2257,FACING THE WORLD.,"washing-house; you remember I broke it and you didn't wish it mended,"
2258,FACING THE WORLD.,"lest I should break something worse than a wheel, perhaps. It wasn't"
2259,FACING THE WORLD.,"worth while risking my life for mere pleasure, but I want my bicycle now"
2260,FACING THE WORLD.,"for use. If you let me have it mended, I can go up and down the country"
2261,FACING THE WORLD.,"for fifty miles in search of work--to Falkirk, Linlithgow, or even"
2262,FACING THE WORLD.,"Glasgow, and I'll cost you nothing for traveling expenses. Isn't that a"
2263,FACING THE WORLD.,"bright idea, mother?"""
2264,FACING THE WORLD.,
2265,FACING THE WORLD.,"She had not the heart to say no, or to suggest that a boy on a bicycle"
2266,FACING THE WORLD.,applying for work was a thing too novel to be eminently successful. But
2267,FACING THE WORLD.,"to get work was at once so essential and so hopeless, that she would"
2268,FACING THE WORLD.,"not throw any cold water on Donald's eagerness and pluck. She hoped too,"
2269,FACING THE WORLD.,"that, spite of the eccentricity of the notion, some shrewd, kind-hearted"
2270,FACING THE WORLD.,gentleman might have sense enough to see the honest purpose of the poor
2271,FACING THE WORLD.,lad who had only himself to depend upon. For his father had now fallen
2272,FACING THE WORLD.,into a state of depression which made all application to him for either
2273,FACING THE WORLD.,advice or help worse than useless. And as both he and Mrs. Boyd had been
2274,FACING THE WORLD.,"solitary orphans when they were married, there were no near relatives"
2275,FACING THE WORLD.,"of any kind to come to the rescue. Donald knew, and his mother knew too,"
2276,FACING THE WORLD.,"that he must shift for himself, to sink or swim."
2277,FACING THE WORLD.,
2278,FACING THE WORLD.,"So, after two days' rest, which he much needed, the boy went off again"
2279,FACING THE WORLD.,"""on his own hook,"" and his bicycle, which was a degree better than his"
2280,FACING THE WORLD.,"legs, he said, as it saves shoe-leather. Also, he was able to come"
2281,FACING THE WORLD.,"home pretty regularly at the same hour, which was a great relief to his"
2282,FACING THE WORLD.,"mother. But he came home nearly as tired as ever, and with a despondent"
2283,FACING THE WORLD.,look which deepened every day. Evidently it was just the same story; no
2284,FACING THE WORLD.,"work to be had; or if there was work, it was struggled for by a score"
2285,FACING THE WORLD.,"of fellows, with age, character, and experience to back them, and Donald"
2286,FACING THE WORLD.,"had none of the three. But he had one quality, the root of all success"
2287,FACING THE WORLD.,"in the end, dogged perseverance."
2288,FACING THE WORLD.,
2289,FACING THE WORLD.,"There is a saying, that we British gain our victories, not because we"
2290,FACING THE WORLD.,"are never beaten, but because we never will see that we are beaten, and"
2291,FACING THE WORLD.,"so go on fighting till we win. ""Never say die,"" was Donald's word to"
2292,FACING THE WORLD.,"his mother night after night. But she knew that those who never SAY die,"
2293,FACING THE WORLD.,"sometimes DO die, quite quietly, and she watched with a sore heart her"
2294,FACING THE WORLD.,"boy growing thinner and more worn, even though brown as a berry with"
2295,FACING THE WORLD.,"constant exposure all day long to wind and weather, for it was now less"
2296,FACING THE WORLD.,autumn than winter.
2297,FACING THE WORLD.,
2298,FACING THE WORLD.,"After a fortnight, Mrs. Boyd made up her mind that this could not go"
2299,FACING THE WORLD.,"on any longer, and said so. ""Very well,"" Donald answered, accepting her"
2300,FACING THE WORLD.,decision as he had been in the habit of doing all his life.--Mrs. Boyd's
2301,FACING THE WORLD.,"children knew very well that whatever her will was, it was sure to be"
2302,FACING THE WORLD.,"a just and wise will, herself being the last person she ever thought"
2303,FACING THE WORLD.,"of.--""Yes, I'll give in, if you think I ought, for it's only wearing out"
2304,FACING THE WORLD.,myself and my clothes to no good. Only let me have one day more and I'll
2305,FACING THE WORLD.,"go as far as ever I can, perhaps to Dunfermline, or even Glasgow."""
2306,FACING THE WORLD.,
2307,FACING THE WORLD.,"She would not forbid, and once more she started him off with a cheerful"
2308,FACING THE WORLD.,"face in the twilight of the wet October morning, and sat all day long"
2309,FACING THE WORLD.,in the empty house--for the younger ones were now all going to school
2310,FACING THE WORLD.,"again--thinking sorrowfully of her eldest, whose merry school days were"
2311,FACING THE WORLD.,done forever.
2312,FACING THE WORLD.,
2313,FACING THE WORLD.,"In the dusk of the afternoon a card was brought up to her, with the"
2314,FACING THE WORLD.,"message that an old gentleman was waiting below, wishing to see her."
2315,FACING THE WORLD.,
2316,FACING THE WORLD.,"A shudder ran through the poor mother, who, like many another mother,"
2317,FACING THE WORLD.,"hated bicycles, and never had an easy mind when Donald was away on his."
2318,FACING THE WORLD.,The stranger's first word was anything but reassuring.
2319,FACING THE WORLD.,
2320,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Beg pardon ma'am, but is your name Boyd, and have you a son called"
2321,FACING THE WORLD.,"Donald, who went out on a bicycle this morning?"""
2322,FACING THE WORLD.,
2323,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Yes, yes! Has anything happened? Tell me quick!"""
2324,FACING THE WORLD.,
2325,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I'm not aware, ma'am, that anything has happened,"" said the old"
2326,FACING THE WORLD.,"gentleman. ""I saw the lad at light this morning. He seemed to be"
2327,FACING THE WORLD.,managing his machine uncommonly well. I met him at the foot of a hill
2328,FACING THE WORLD.,"near Edinburgh Castle. He had got off and was walking; so he saw me, and"
2329,FACING THE WORLD.,"took off his cap. I like respect, especially in a young fellow towards"
2330,FACING THE WORLD.,"an old one."""
2331,FACING THE WORLD.,
2332,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Did he know you, for I have not that pleasure?"" said Mrs. Boyd, polite,"
2333,FACING THE WORLD.,"though puzzled. For the old man did not look quite like a gentleman,"
2334,FACING THE WORLD.,"and spoke with the strong accent of an uneducated person, yet he had a"
2335,FACING THE WORLD.,"kindly expression, and seemed honest and well-meaning, though decidedly"
2336,FACING THE WORLD.,"""canny."""
2337,FACING THE WORLD.,
2338,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I cannot say he knew me, but he remembered me, which was civil of him."
2339,FACING THE WORLD.,And then I minded the lad as the one that had come to me for work a week
2340,FACING THE WORLD.,"or two ago, and I took his name and address. That's your son's writing?"""
2341,FACING THE WORLD.,"he jumbled out and showed a scrap of paper. ""It's bona fide, isn't it?"
2342,FACING THE WORLD.,
2343,FACING THE WORLD.,"""And he really is in search of work? He hasn't run away from home, or"
2344,FACING THE WORLD.,"been turned out by his father for misconduct, or anything of that sort?"
2345,FACING THE WORLD.,"He isn't a scamp, or a ne'er-do-weel?"""
2346,FACING THE WORLD.,
2347,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I hope he doesn't look like it,"" said Mrs. Boyd, proudly."
2348,FACING THE WORLD.,
2349,FACING THE WORLD.,"""No, ma'am; you're right, he doesn't. He carries his character in his"
2350,FACING THE WORLD.,"face which, maybe, is better than in his pocket. It was that which made"
2351,FACING THE WORLD.,"me ask his name and address, though I could do nothing for him."""
2352,FACING THE WORLD.,
2353,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Then you were the gentleman who told him you couldn't keep a dog and"
2354,FACING THE WORLD.,"bark yourself?"" said Mrs. Boyd, amused, and just a shade hopeful."
2355,FACING THE WORLD.,
2356,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Precisely. Nor can I. It would have been cool impudence in a lad to"
2357,FACING THE WORLD.,"come and ask to be taught his work first and then paid for it, if he"
2358,FACING THE WORLD.,hadn't been so very much in earnest that I was rather sorry for him.
2359,FACING THE WORLD.,"I'm inclined to believe, from the talk I had with him at the foot of the"
2360,FACING THE WORLD.,"brae to-day, that he is a young dog that would bark with uncommon little"
2361,FACING THE WORLD.,"teaching. Material, ma'am, is what we want. I don't care for its being"
2362,FACING THE WORLD.,"raw material, if it's only of the right sort. I've made up my mind to"
2363,FACING THE WORLD.,"try your boy."""
2364,FACING THE WORLD.,
2365,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Thank God!"""
2366,FACING THE WORLD.,
2367,FACING THE WORLD.,"""What did you say, ma'am? But--I beg your pardon."""
2368,FACING THE WORLD.,
2369,FACING THE WORLD.,"For he saw that Mrs. Boyd had quite broken down. In truth, the strain"
2370,FACING THE WORLD.,had been so long and so great that this sudden relief was quite too much
2371,FACING THE WORLD.,for her. She sobbed heartily.
2372,FACING THE WORLD.,
2373,FACING THE WORLD.,"""I ought to beg your pardon,"" she said at last, ""for being so foolish,"
2374,FACING THE WORLD.,"but we have had hard times of late."""
2375,FACING THE WORLD.,
2376,FACING THE WORLD.,"And then, in a few simple words, she told Donald's whole story."
2377,FACING THE WORLD.,
2378,FACING THE WORLD.,"The old man listened to it in silence. Sometimes he nodded his head,"
2379,FACING THE WORLD.,or beat his chin on his stout stick as he sat; but he made no comment
2380,FACING THE WORLD.,"whatever, except a brief ""Thank you, ma'am."""
2381,FACING THE WORLD.,
2382,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Now to business,"" continued he, taking out his watch; ""for I'm due at"
2383,FACING THE WORLD.,"dinner: and I always keep my appointments, even with myself. I hope your"
2384,FACING THE WORLD.,"Donald is a punctual lad?"""
2385,FACING THE WORLD.,
2386,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Yes. He promised to be back by dark, and I am sure he will be. Could"
2387,FACING THE WORLD.,"you not wait?"""
2388,FACING THE WORLD.,
2389,FACING THE WORLD.,"""No. I never wait for anybody; but keep nobody waiting for me. I'm"
2390,FACING THE WORLD.,"Bethune & Co., Leith Merchants--practically, old John Bethune, who began"
2391,FACING THE WORLD.,"life as a message-boy, and has done pretty well, considering."""
2392,FACING THE WORLD.,
2393,FACING THE WORLD.,"He had, as Mrs. Boyd was well aware. Bethune & Co. was a name so well"
2394,FACING THE WORLD.,known that she could hardly believe in her boy's good luck in getting
2395,FACING THE WORLD.,into that house in any capacity whatever.
2396,FACING THE WORLD.,
2397,FACING THE WORLD.,"""So all is settled,"" said Mr. Bethune, rising. ""Let him come to me on"
2398,FACING THE WORLD.,"Monday morning, and I'll see what he is fit for. He'll have to start at"
2399,FACING THE WORLD.,"the very bottom--sweep the office, perhaps--I did it myself once--and"
2400,FACING THE WORLD.,"I'll give him--let me see--ten shillings a week to begin with."""
2401,FACING THE WORLD.,
2402,FACING THE WORLD.,"""'To begin with,'"" repeated Mrs. Boyd, gently but firmly; ""but he will"
2403,FACING THE WORLD.,"soon be worth more. I am sure of that."""
2404,FACING THE WORLD.,
2405,FACING THE WORLD.,"""Very well. When I see what stuff he is made of, he shall have a rise."
2406,FACING THE WORLD.,But I never do things at haphazard; and it's easier going up than coming
2407,FACING THE WORLD.,"down. I'm not a benevolent man, Mrs. Boyd, and you need not think it."
2408,FACING THE WORLD.,"But I've fought the world pretty hard myself, and I like to help those"
2409,FACING THE WORLD.,that are fighting it. Good evening. Isn't that your son coming round the
2410,FACING THE WORLD.,"corner? Well, he's back exact to his time, at any rate. Tell him I hope"
2411,FACING THE WORLD.,"he will be as punctual on Monday morning. Good evening, ma'am."""
2412,FACING THE WORLD.,
2413,FACING THE WORLD.,"Now, if this were an imaginary story, I might wind it up by a delightful"
2414,FACING THE WORLD.,"denoument of Mr. Bethune's turning out an old friend of the family, or"
2415,FACING THE WORLD.,"developing into a new one, and taking such a fancy to Donald that he"
2416,FACING THE WORLD.,"immediately gave him a clerkship with a large salary, and the promise"
2417,FACING THE WORLD.,"of a partnership on coming of age, or this worthy gentleman should be"
2418,FACING THE WORLD.,an eccentric old bachelor who immediately adopted that wonderful boy and
2419,FACING THE WORLD.,befriended the whole Boyd family.
2420,FACING THE WORLD.,
2421,FACING THE WORLD.,"But neither of these things, nor anything else remarkable, happened in"
2422,FACING THE WORLD.,"the real story, which, as it is literally true, though told with certain"
2423,FACING THE WORLD.,"necessary disguises, I prefer to keep to as closely as I can. Such"
2424,FACING THE WORLD.,"astonishing bits of ""luck"" do not happen in real life, or happen so"
2425,FACING THE WORLD.,"rarely that one inclines, at least, to believe very little in either"
2426,FACING THE WORLD.,"good or ill fortune, as a matter of chance. There is always something at"
2427,FACING THE WORLD.,"the back of it which furnishes a key to the whole. Practically, a man's"
2428,FACING THE WORLD.,"lot is of his own making. He may fail, for a while undeservedly, or he"
2429,FACING THE WORLD.,"may succeed undeservedly, but, in the long run, time brings its revenges"
2430,FACING THE WORLD.,and its rewards.
2431,FACING THE WORLD.,
2432,FACING THE WORLD.,As it did to Donald Boyd. He has not been taken into the house of
2433,FACING THE WORLD.,"Bethune & Co., as a partner; and it was long before he became even a"
2434,FACING THE WORLD.,"clerk--at least with anything like a high salary. For Mr. Bethune, so"
2435,FACING THE WORLD.,"far from being an old bachelor, had a large family to provide for, and"
2436,FACING THE WORLD.,"was bringing up several of his sons to his own business, so there was"
2437,FACING THE WORLD.,little room for a stranger. But a young man who deserves to find room
2438,FACING THE WORLD.,"generally does find it, or make it. And though Donald started at the"
2439,FACING THE WORLD.,"lowest rung of the ladder, he may climb to the top yet."
2440,FACING THE WORLD.,
2441,FACING THE WORLD.,"He had ""a fair field, and no favor."" Indeed, he neither wished nor asked"
2442,FACING THE WORLD.,favor. He determined to stand on his own feet from the first. He had
2443,FACING THE WORLD.,"hard work and few holidays, made mistakes, found them out and corrected"
2444,FACING THE WORLD.,"them, got sharp words and bore them, learnt his own weak points and--not"
2445,FACING THE WORLD.,"so easily--his strong ones. Still he did learn them; for, unless you can"
2446,FACING THE WORLD.,"trust yourself, be sure nobody else will trust you."
2447,FACING THE WORLD.,
2448,FACING THE WORLD.,This was Donald's great point. HE WAS TRUSTED. People soon found out
2449,FACING THE WORLD.,"that they might trust him; that he always told the truth, and never"
2450,FACING THE WORLD.,"pretended to do more than he could do; but that which he could do, they"
2451,FACING THE WORLD.,"might depend upon his doing, punctually, accurately, carefully, and"
2452,FACING THE WORLD.,"never leaving off till it was done. Therefore, though others might"
2453,FACING THE WORLD.,"be quicker, sharper, more ""up to things"" than he, there was no one so"
2454,FACING THE WORLD.,"reliable, and it soon got to be a proverb in the office of Bethune &"
2455,FACING THE WORLD.,"Co.--and other offices, too--""If you wish a thing done, go to Boyd."""
2456,FACING THE WORLD.,
2457,FACING THE WORLD.,"I am bound to say this, for I am painting no imaginary portrait, but"
2458,FACING THE WORLD.,"describing an individual who really exists, and who may be met any day"
2459,FACING THE WORLD.,"walking about Edinburgh, though his name is not Donald Boyd, and there"
2460,FACING THE WORLD.,is no such firm as Bethune & Co. But the house he does belong to values
2461,FACING THE WORLD.,the young fellow so highly that there is little doubt he will rise in
2462,FACING THE WORLD.,"it, and rise in every way, probably to the very top of the tree,"
2463,FACING THE WORLD.,"and tell his children and grandchildren the story which, in its main"
2464,FACING THE WORLD.,"features, I have recorded here, of how he first began facing the world."

2798,BABOUSCKA.,
2799,BABOUSCKA.,If you were a Russian child you would not watch to see Santa Klaus come
2800,BABOUSCKA.,down the chimney; but you would stand by the windows to catch a peep at
2801,BABOUSCKA.,poor Babouscka as she hurries by.
2802,BABOUSCKA.,
2803,BABOUSCKA.,Who is Babouscka? Is she Santa Klaus' wife?
2804,BABOUSCKA.,
2805,BABOUSCKA.,"No, indeed. She is only a poor little crooked wrinkled old woman, who"
2806,BABOUSCKA.,"comes at Christmas time into everybody's house, who peeps into every"
2807,BABOUSCKA.,"cradle, turns back every coverlid, drops a tear on the baby's white"
2808,BABOUSCKA.,"pillow, and goes away very, very sorrowful."
2809,BABOUSCKA.,
2810,BABOUSCKA.,"And not only at Christmas time, but through all the cold winter, and"
2811,BABOUSCKA.,"especially in March, when the wind blows loud, and whistles and howls"
2812,BABOUSCKA.,"and dies away like a sigh, the Russian children hear the rustling step"
2813,BABOUSCKA.,of the Babouscka. She is always in a hurry. One hears her running fast
2814,BABOUSCKA.,along the crowded streets and over the quiet country fields. She seems
2815,BABOUSCKA.,"to be out of breath and tired, yet she hurries on."
2816,BABOUSCKA.,
2817,BABOUSCKA.,Whom is she trying to overtake?
2818,BABOUSCKA.,
2819,BABOUSCKA.,She scarcely looks at the little children as they press their rosy faces
2820,BABOUSCKA.,"against the window pane and whisper to each other, ""Is the Babouscka"
2821,BABOUSCKA.,"looking for us?"""
2822,BABOUSCKA.,
2823,BABOUSCKA.,"No, she will not stop; only on Christmas eve will she come up-stairs"
2824,BABOUSCKA.,into the nursery and give each little one a present. You must not think
2825,BABOUSCKA.,she leaves handsome gifts such as Santa Klaus brings for you. She does
2826,BABOUSCKA.,not bring bicycles to the boys or French dolls to the girls. She does
2827,BABOUSCKA.,"not come in a gay little sleigh drawn by reindeer, but hobbling along on"
2828,BABOUSCKA.,"foot, and she leans on a crutch. She has her old apron filled with candy"
2829,BABOUSCKA.,"and cheap toys, and the children all love her dearly. They watch to see"
2830,BABOUSCKA.,"her come, and when one hears a rustling, he cries, ""Lo! the Babouscka!"""
2831,BABOUSCKA.,"then all others look, but one must turn one's head very quickly or she"
2832,BABOUSCKA.,vanishes. I never saw her myself.
2833,BABOUSCKA.,
2834,BABOUSCKA.,"Best of all, she loves little babies, and often, when the tired mothers"
2835,BABOUSCKA.,"sleep, she bends over their cradles, puts her brown, wrinkled face close"
2836,BABOUSCKA.,down to the pillow and looks very sharply.
2837,BABOUSCKA.,
2838,BABOUSCKA.,What is she looking for?
2839,BABOUSCKA.,
2840,BABOUSCKA.,"Ah, that you can't guess unless you know her sad story."
2841,BABOUSCKA.,
2842,BABOUSCKA.,"Long, long ago, a great many yesterdays ago, the Babouscka, who was even"
2843,BABOUSCKA.,"then an old woman, was busy sweeping her little hut. She lived in the"
2844,BABOUSCKA.,"coldest corner of cold Russia, and she lived alone in a lonely place"
2845,BABOUSCKA.,where four wide roads met. These roads were at this time white with
2846,BABOUSCKA.,"snow, for it was winter time. In the summer, when the fields were full"
2847,BABOUSCKA.,"of flowers and the air full of sunshine and singing birds, Babouscka's"
2848,BABOUSCKA.,"home did not seem so very quiet; but in the winter, with only the"
2849,BABOUSCKA.,"snowflakes and the shy snow-birds and the loud wind for company, the"
2850,BABOUSCKA.,"little old woman felt very cheerless. But she was a busy old woman, and"
2851,BABOUSCKA.,"as it was already twilight, and her home but half swept, she felt in"
2852,BABOUSCKA.,a great hurry to finish her work before bedtime. You must know the
2853,BABOUSCKA.,Babouscka was poor and could not afford to do her work by candle-light.
2854,BABOUSCKA.,
2855,BABOUSCKA.,"Presently, down the widest and the lonesomest of the white roads, there"
2856,BABOUSCKA.,"appeared a long train of people coming. They were walking slowly, and"
2857,BABOUSCKA.,seemed to be asking each other questions as to which way they should
2858,BABOUSCKA.,"take. As the procession came nearer, and finally stopped outside the"
2859,BABOUSCKA.,"little hut, Babouscka was frightened at the splendor. There were"
2860,BABOUSCKA.,"Three Kings, with crowns on their heads, and the jewels on the Kings'"
2861,BABOUSCKA.,breastplates sparkled like sunlight. Their heavy fur cloaks were white
2862,BABOUSCKA.,"with the falling snow-flakes, and the queer humpy camels on which they"
2863,BABOUSCKA.,rode looked white as milk in the snow-storm. The harness on the camels
2864,BABOUSCKA.,"was decorated with gold, and plates of silver adorned the saddles. The"
2865,BABOUSCKA.,"saddle-cloths were of the richest Eastern stuffs, and all the servants"
2866,BABOUSCKA.,had the dark eyes and hair of an Eastern people.
2867,BABOUSCKA.,
2868,BABOUSCKA.,"The slaves carried heavy loads on their backs, and each of the Three"
2869,BABOUSCKA.,"Kings carried a present. One carried a beautiful transparent jar, and"
2870,BABOUSCKA.,in the fading light Babouscka could see in it a golden liquid which
2871,BABOUSCKA.,she knew from its color must be myrrh. Another had in his hand a richly
2872,BABOUSCKA.,"woven bag, and it seemed to be heavy, as indeed it was, for it was"
2873,BABOUSCKA.,"full of gold. The third had a stone vase in his hand, and from the rich"
2874,BABOUSCKA.,"perfume which filled the snowy air, one could guess the vase to have"
2875,BABOUSCKA.,been filled with incense.
2876,BABOUSCKA.,
2877,BABOUSCKA.,"Babouscka was terribly frightened, so she hid herself in her hut, and"
2878,BABOUSCKA.,let the servants knock a long time at her door before she dared open it
2879,BABOUSCKA.,and answer their questions as to the road they should take to a far-away
2880,BABOUSCKA.,"town. You know she had never studied a geography lesson in her life,"
2881,BABOUSCKA.,was old and stupid and scared. She knew the way across the fields to the
2882,BABOUSCKA.,"nearest village, but she know nothing else of all the wide world full of"
2883,BABOUSCKA.,"cities. The servants scolded, but the Three Kings spoke kindly to her,"
2884,BABOUSCKA.,and asked her to accompany them on their journey that she might show
2885,BABOUSCKA.,"them the way as far as she knew it. They told her, in words so simple"
2886,BABOUSCKA.,"that she could not fail to understand, that they had seen a Star in the"
2887,BABOUSCKA.,sky and were following it to a little town where a young Child lay. The
2888,BABOUSCKA.,"snow was in the sky now, and the Star was lost out of sight."
2889,BABOUSCKA.,
2890,BABOUSCKA.,"""Who is the Child?"" asked the old woman."
2891,BABOUSCKA.,
2892,BABOUSCKA.,"""He is a King, and we go to worship him,"" they answered. ""These presents"
2893,BABOUSCKA.,"of gold, frankincense and myrrh are for Him. When we find Him we will"
2894,BABOUSCKA.,"take the crowns off our heads and lay them at His feet. Come with us,"
2895,BABOUSCKA.,"Babouscka!"""
2896,BABOUSCKA.,
2897,BABOUSCKA.,What do you suppose? Shouldn't you have thought the poor little woman
2898,BABOUSCKA.,would have been glad to leave her desolate home on the plains to
2899,BABOUSCKA.,accompany these Kings on their journey?
2900,BABOUSCKA.,
2901,BABOUSCKA.,"But the foolish woman shook her head. No, the night was dark and"
2902,BABOUSCKA.,"cheerless, and her little home was warm and cosy. She looked up into the"
2903,BABOUSCKA.,"sky, and the Star was nowhere to be seen. Besides, she wanted to put her"
2904,BABOUSCKA.,hut in order--perhaps she would be ready to go to-morrow. But the Three
2905,BABOUSCKA.,Kings could not wait; so when to-morrow's sun rose they were far ahead
2906,BABOUSCKA.,"on their journey. It seemed like a dream to poor Babouscka, for even"
2907,BABOUSCKA.,the tracks of the camels' feet were covered by the deep white snow.
2908,BABOUSCKA.,Everything was the same as usual; and to make sure that the night's
2909,BABOUSCKA.,"visitors had not been a fancy, she found her old broom hanging on a peg"
2910,BABOUSCKA.,"behind the door, where she had put it when the servants knocked."
2911,BABOUSCKA.,
2912,BABOUSCKA.,"Now that the sun was shining, and she remembered the glitter of the gold"
2913,BABOUSCKA.,"and the smell of the sweet gums and myrrh, she wished she had gone with"
2914,BABOUSCKA.,the travelers.
2915,BABOUSCKA.,
2916,BABOUSCKA.,And she thought a great deal about the dear Baby the Three Kings had
2917,BABOUSCKA.,"gone to worship. She had no children of her own--nobody loved her--ah,"
2918,BABOUSCKA.,"if she had only gone! The more she brooded on the thought, the more"
2919,BABOUSCKA.,"miserable she grew, till the very sight of her home became hateful to"
2920,BABOUSCKA.,her.
2921,BABOUSCKA.,
2922,BABOUSCKA.,It is a dreadful feeling to realize that one has lost a chance of
2923,BABOUSCKA.,happiness. There is a feeling called remorse that can gnaw like a sharp
2924,BABOUSCKA.,little tooth. Babouscka felt this little tooth cut into her heart every
2925,BABOUSCKA.,time she remembered the visit of the Three Kings.
2926,BABOUSCKA.,
2927,BABOUSCKA.,After a while the thought of the Little Child became her first thought
2928,BABOUSCKA.,at waking and her last at night. One day she shut the door of her house
2929,BABOUSCKA.,"forever, and set out on a long journey. She had no hope of overtaking"
2930,BABOUSCKA.,"the Three Kings, but she longed to find the Child, that she too might"
2931,BABOUSCKA.,"love and worship Him. She asked every one she met, and some people"
2932,BABOUSCKA.,"thought her crazy, but others gave her kind answers. Have you perhaps"
2933,BABOUSCKA.,guessed that the young Child whom the Three Kings sought was our Lord
2934,BABOUSCKA.,himself?
2935,BABOUSCKA.,
2936,BABOUSCKA.,"People told Babouscka how He was born in a manger, and many other things"
2937,BABOUSCKA.,which you children have learned long ago. These answers puzzled the
2938,BABOUSCKA.,old dame mightily. She had but one idea in her ignorant head. The Three
2939,BABOUSCKA.,"Kings had gone to seek a Baby. She would, if not too late, seek Him too."
2940,BABOUSCKA.,
2941,BABOUSCKA.,"She forgot, I am sure, how many long years had gone by. She looked in"
2942,BABOUSCKA.,vain for the Christ-child in His manger-cradle. She spent all her little
2943,BABOUSCKA.,"savings in toys and candy so as to make friends with little children,"
2944,BABOUSCKA.,that they might not run away when she came hobbling into their
2945,BABOUSCKA.,nurseries.
2946,BABOUSCKA.,
2947,BABOUSCKA.,Now you know for whom she is sadly seeking when she pushes back the
2948,BABOUSCKA.,"bed-curtains and bends down over each baby's pillow. Sometimes, when the"
2949,BABOUSCKA.,"old grandmother sits nodding by the fire, and the bigger children sleep"
2950,BABOUSCKA.,"in their beds, old Babouscka comes hobbling into the room, and whispers"
2951,BABOUSCKA.,"softly, ""Is the young Child here?"""
2952,BABOUSCKA.,
2953,BABOUSCKA.,"Ah, no; she has come too late, too late. But the little children know"
2954,BABOUSCKA.,her and love her. Two thousand years ago she lost the chance of finding
2955,BABOUSCKA.,"Him. Crooked, wrinkled, old, sick and sorry, she yet lives on, looking"
2956,BABOUSCKA.,"into each baby's face--always disappointed, always seeking. Will she"
2957,BABOUSCKA.,find Him at last?
2958,BABOUSCKA.,
2959,BABOUSCKA.,
2960,BABOUSCKA.,"Come, Bossy, come Bossy!  Here I am with my cup,"
2961,BABOUSCKA.,"Come give me some milk, rich and sweet."
2962,BABOUSCKA.,"I will pay you well with red clover hay,"

3215,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,over dangers its brave men have driven away quite out of sight again.
3216,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3217,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"One of the deepest seasons of gloom was when the French Emperor,"
3218,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Napoleon, had conquered one country after another, until there was"
3219,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,scarcely anything but England left to attack; and one of the proudest
3220,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"times of rejoicing was when the ""Iron Duke"" Wellington, and the bluff"
3221,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"old Prussian, Blucher, met him at Waterloo, defeated his armies and"
3222,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"drove him from the field. There were bonfires, and bell-ringings then,"
3223,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,and from that day onward England loved and cherished every man who
3224,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"had fought at Waterloo--from the ""Duke"" himself down to the plainest"
3225,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"private, every one was a hero and a veteran."
3226,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3227,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"In one of the humblest houses of a proud nobleman's estate, a low,"
3228,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"whitewashed cottage, one of these veterans lived not so very many years"
3229,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,ago. He had fought by his flag in one of the most gallant regiments
3230,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"until the last hour of the battle, and then had fallen disabled from"
3231,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,active service for the rest of his life.
3232,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3233,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"That did not seem to be of so very great consequence though, just now;"
3234,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"for peace reigned in the land, and with his wife and two beautiful"
3235,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"daughters to love, his battles to think over, and his pension to provide"
3236,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the bread and coffee, the old soldier was as happy as the day was long."
3237,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"It made no difference that the bread and the coffee were both black, and"

3244,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3245,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,But it seemed as if the old soldier's life was going to prove like his
3246,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,share in that great day at Waterloo--success and victory till the end
3247,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"had nearly come, and then one shot after another striking him with"
3248,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"troubles, he could never get over."
3249,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3250,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"The first came in the midst of the beautiful summer days, when the bees"
3251,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"droned through the delicious air, the rose-bush was in full bloom, and"
3252,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the old soldier sat in the cottage door reveling in it all. A slow,"
3253,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,merciless fever rose up through the soft air--it did not venture near
3254,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the high ground where the castle stood, but it crept noiselessly into"
3255,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the whitewashed cottage, one night, and the soldier's two daughters were"
3256,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,stricken down. This was the beginning of terrible trouble to the veteran
3257,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"of Waterloo. Not that he minded watching, for he was used to standing"
3258,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"sentry all night, and as for nursing, he had seen plenty in the"
3259,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,hospital; but to see his daughters suffering--that was what he could not
3260,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,bear!
3261,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3262,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"And worst of all, between medicines and necessaries for the sick, the"
3263,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"three months' pension was quite used up, and when the old soldier's"
3264,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"nursing had pulled through the fierceness of the fever, there was"
3265,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,nothing but black bread left in the house--and black bread was almost
3266,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,the same as no bread at all to the dainty appetities the fever had left;
3267,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"and that was what he had to think of, and think of, as he sat in the"
3268,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,cottage door.
3269,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3270,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Bah!"" said the old soldier, with something more like a groan than was"
3271,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"ever heard from him while his wounds were being dressed, ""I could face"
3272,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"all the armies of Napoleon better than this!"""
3273,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3274,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"And he sat more and more in the cottage door, as if that could leave the"
3275,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"trouble behind; but it stood staring before him, all the same, till it"
3276,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,almost shut the rosebush and the bees out of sight. But one morning a
3277,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,tremendous surprise came to him like a flash out of the sky! He heard
3278,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the sound of galloping troops, and he pricked up his ears, for that"
3279,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,always made him think of a cavalry charge.
3280,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3281,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Who goes there?"" he cried; but without answering his challenge the"
3282,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"sound came nearer and nearer, and a lackey in full livery dashed up to"
3283,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the door, and presented him with a note sealed with the blood-red seal"
3284,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,of the castle arms. It was an invitation to dine at the castle with a
3285,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"company of noblemen and officers of the army. His lordship, who had also"
3286,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"fought at Waterloo, had just learned that a comrade was living on his"
3287,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"estate, and made haste to do him honor, and secure a famous guest for"
3288,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,his dinner party.
3289,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3290,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"The old soldier rose up proudly, and gave the lackey a military salute."
3291,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3292,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Tell his lordship,"" he said, ""that I shall report myself at"
3293,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"headquarters, and present my thanks for the honor he has done me."""
3294,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3295,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"The lackey galloped off, and the veteran pushed his chair over with his"
3296,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"wooden leg, and clattered across the cottage floor."
3297,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3298,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Ho, Peggy!"" he cried, ""did I not say that luck comes and trouble flies"
3299,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,if you only face the enemy long enough? This is the beginning of good
3300,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"things, I tell you! A hero of Waterloo, and fit to dine with lords and"
3301,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"generals, will certainly have other good fortune coming to him, till he"
3302,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,can keep his wife and daughters like princesses. Just wait a bit and
3303,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"you shall see!"" and he turned hastily away, for his heart came up in his"
3304,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,throat so that he could not speak.
3305,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3306,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"All the rest of that day he sat in the door, brushing and darning and"
3307,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,polishing his stained uniform. It had lain abandoned on the shelf for
3308,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"many a year, but before night every button was shining like gold, the"
3309,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"scarlet cloth was almost fresh once more, and the old soldier, wrapped"
3310,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"in his faithful cloak, was making his way joyfully across the heathery"
3311,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,moors to the castle quite at the other side.
3312,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3313,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"But when he had fairly reached it, and the servant had shown him"
3314,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"into the drawing-room, his heart almost failed him for a moment. Such"
3315,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,splendor he had never seen before--a thousandth part would have bought
3316,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,health and happiness for the dear ones he had left with only his brave
3317,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,goodbye and a fresh rose-bud to comfort them!
3318,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3319,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"However, what with the beautiful ladies of the castle gathering"
3320,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"round him to ask questions about the battle, and with a seat near his"
3321,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"lordship's right hand at dinner, he soon plucked up again, and began to"
3322,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,realize how delightful everything was. But that was the very thing that
3323,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"almost spoiled the whole again, for when he saw his plate covered with"
3324,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"luxuries and delicacies more than he could possibly eat, the thought of"
3325,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,the black bread he had left at the cottage brought the tears rushing to
3326,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,his eyes.
3327,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3328,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"But, ""Tut!"" he said to himself in great dismay, ""what an ungrateful"
3329,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"poltroon his lordship will think he has brought here!"" and he managed to"
3330,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,brush them off while no one was looking.
3331,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3332,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"It was delicious, though, in spite of everything, and after a while the"
3333,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,wine began to flow--that warmed his very heart--and then he heard his
3334,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,lordship calling to a servant to bring him something from his private
3335,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"desk, saying:"
3336,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3337,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Gentlemen, I am about to show you the proudest treasure I possess. This"
3338,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"diamond snuff-box was presented to me by the stout old Blucher himself,"
3339,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,in remembrance of service I was able to perform at Waterloo. Not that
3340,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,I was a whit worthier of it than the brave fellows under my
3341,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"command--understand that!"""
3342,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3343,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,How the diamonds glistened and gleamed as the box was passed from hand
3344,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"to hand! As if the thickest cluster of stars you ever saw, could shine"
3345,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"out in the midst of a yellow sunset sky, and the colors of the rainbow"
3346,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"could twinkle through them at the same time! It was superb, but then"
3347,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,that was nothing compared to the glory of receiving it from Blucher!
3348,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3349,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Then there was more wine and story-telling, and at last some asked to"
3350,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,look at the snuff-box again.
3351,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3352,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Has any one the snuff-box at present?"" asked his lordship, rather"
3353,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"anxiously, for as he turned to reach it no snuff-box was to be seen."
3354,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3355,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"No one said ""yes,"" for everyone was sure he had passed it to his"
3356,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"neighbor, and they searched up and down the table with consternation in"
3357,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"their faces, for the snuff-box could not have disappeared without hands,"
3358,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,but to say so was to touch the honor of gentlemen and soldiers.
3359,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3360,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,At last one of the most famous officers rose from his seat:
3361,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3362,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""My lord,"" he said, ""a very unlucky accident must have occurred here."
3363,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Some one of us must have slipped the box into his pocket unconsciously,"
3364,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"mistaking it for his own. I will take the lead in searching mine, if the"
3365,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"rest of the company will follow!"""
3366,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3367,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Agreed!"" said the rest, and each guest in turn went to the bottom of"
3368,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"one pocket after another, but still no snuff-box, and the distress of"
3369,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the company increased. The old soldier's turn came last, and with it"
3370,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,came the surprise. With burning cheeks and arms folded closely across
3371,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,his breast he stood up and confronted the company like a stag at bay.
3372,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3373,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""No!"" he exclaimed, ""no one shall search my pockets! Would you doubt the"
3374,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"honor of a soldier?"""
3375,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3376,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""But we have all done so,"" said the rest, ""and every one knows it is the"
3377,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"merest accident at the most."" But the old soldier only held his arms the"
3378,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"tighter, while the color grew deeper in his face. In his perplexity his"
3379,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,lordship thought of another expedient.
3380,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3381,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""We will try another way, gentlemen,"" he said, ""I will order a basket of"
3382,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"bran to be brought, and propose that each one in turn shall thrust his"
3383,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"hand into the bran. No one shall look on, and if we find the box at"
3384,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"last, no one can guess whose hand placed it there."""
3385,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3386,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"It was quickly done, and hand after hand was thrust in, until at last"
3387,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,came the old soldier's turn once more. But he was nowhere to be seen.
3388,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3389,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Then, at last the indignation of the company broke forth."
3390,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3391,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""A soldier, and a hero of Waterloo, and willing to be a thief!"" and with"
3392,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"their distress about the affair, and his lordship's grief at his loss,"
3393,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,the evening was entirely spoiled.
3394,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3395,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Meantime the old soldier, with his faithful cloak wrapped closely round"
3396,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"him once more, was fighting his way through the sharp winds and over the"
3397,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,moors again. But a battle against something a thousand times sharper and
3398,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,colder was going on in his breast.
3399,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3400,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""A thief!"" he was saying over and over to himself, ""me, who fought close"
3401,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"to the side of the 'Iron Duke'! And yet, can I look one of them in the"
3402,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"face and tell him he lies?"""
3403,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3404,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,The walk that had been gone over so merrily was a terrible one to
3405,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"retrace, and when the cottage was reached, instead of the pride and good"
3406,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"luck the poor invalids had been watching for, a gloom deadlier than the"
3407,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"fever followed him in. He sat in the doorway as he used, but sometimes"
3408,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"he hung his head on his breast, and sometimes started up and walked"
3409,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"proudly about, crying--"
3410,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3411,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Peggy! I say no one shall call me a thief! I am a soldier of the Iron"
3412,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Duke!"""
3413,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3414,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"But they did call him a thief, though, for a very strange thing, after"
3415,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,his lordship had sorrowfully ordered the cottage and little garden spot
3416,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"to be searched no box was found, and the gloom and the mystery grew"
3417,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,deeper together.
3418,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3419,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,Good nursing could not balance against trouble like this; the beautiful
3420,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"daughters faded and died, the house was too gloomy to stay inside, and"
3421,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"if he escaped to the door, he had to hear the passers say--"
3422,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3423,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""There sits the soldier who stole the Blucher diamonds from his host!"""
3424,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3425,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"And as if this was not enough, one day the sound of hoofs was heard"
3426,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"again, and a rider in uniform clattered up to the door saying:"
3427,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3428,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Comrade, I am sent to tell you that your pension is stopped! His"
3429,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Majesty cannot count a thief any longer a soldier of his!"""
3430,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3431,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"After this the old soldier hardly held up his head at all, and his hair,"
3432,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"that had kept black as a coal all these years, turned white as the moors"
3433,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,when the winter snows lay on them.
3434,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3435,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Though that is all the same, Peggy,"" he used to say, ""for it is winter"
3436,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,all the year round with me! If I could only die as the old year does!
3437,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"That would be the thing!"""
3438,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3439,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"But long and merciless as the winter is, spring does come at last, if we"
3440,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,can but live and fight our way through the storms and cold.
3441,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3442,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,One night a cry of fire roused all the country-side. All but the old
3443,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"soldier. He heard them say the castle was burning, but what was that"
3444,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,to him? Nothing could burn away the remembrance that he had once
3445,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,been called a thief within its walls! But the next morning he heard a
3446,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"step--not a horse's hoof this time, but a strong man walking hastily"
3447,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,towards him.
3448,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3449,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Where is the veteran of Waterloo?"" asked his lordship's voice, and when"
3450,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"the old soldier stepped forward, he threw his arms about his neck with"
3451,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,tears and sobs.
3452,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3453,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Comrade,"" he said, ""come up to the castle! The snuff-box is found,"
3454,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,and I want you to stand in the very room where it was lost while I tell
3455,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,everyone what a great and sorrowful wrong a brave and honest soldier has
3456,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"suffered at my hands!"""
3457,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3458,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,It did not take many words to explain. In the first alarm of fire the
3459,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,butler had rushed to the plate-closet to save the silver.
3460,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3461,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Those goblets from the high shelf! Quick!"" he said, to the footman who"
3462,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"was helping him, and with the haste about the goblets something else"
3463,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,came tumbling down.
3464,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3465,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""The lost diamond snuff-box!"" cried the butler. ""That stupid fellow I"
3466,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"dismissed the day it disappeared, must have put it there and forgotten"
3467,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"all about it!"""
3468,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3469,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"The fire was soon extinguished, but not a wink of sleep could his"
3470,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,lordship get until he could make reparation for the pitiful mistake
3471,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,about the box; and once more the old soldier made his way across the
3472,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"moors, even the wooden leg stepping proudly as he went along, though now"
3473,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"and then, as the old feeling came over him, his white head would droop"
3474,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,for a moment again.
3475,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3476,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"The servants stood aside respectfully as he entered the castle, and they"
3477,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,and the other guests of that unlucky day gathered round him while his
3478,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,lordship told them how the box had been found and how he could not rest
3479,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,until forgiven by the brave hero he had so unjustly suspected of wrong.
3480,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3481,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""And now,"" said the company, ""will you not tell us one thing more? Why"
3482,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"did you refuse to empty your pockets, as all the rest were willing to"
3483,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"do?"""
3484,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3485,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"""Because,"" said the old soldier sorrowfully, ""because I WAS a thief, and"
3486,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,I could not bear that anyone should discover it! All whom I loved
3487,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"best in the world were lying sick at home, starving for want of the"
3488,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"delicacies I could not provide, and I felt as if my heart would break to"
3489,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,see my plate heaped with luxuries while they had not so much as a taste!
3490,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"I thought a mouthful of what I did not need might save them, and when"
3491,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,no one was looking I slipped some choice bits from my plate between two
3492,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,pieces of bread and made way with them into my pocket. I could not let
3493,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"them be discovered for a soldier is too proud to beg, but oh, my lord,"
3494,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,he can bear being called a thief all his life better than he can dine
3495,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,sumptuously while there is only black bread at home for the sick and
3496,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"weak whom he loves!"""
3497,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3498,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"Tears came streaming from the old soldier's listeners by this time, and"
3499,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,each vied with the other in heaping honors and gifts in place of the
3500,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,disgrace suffered so long; but all that was powerless to make up for the
3501,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,past.
3502,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,
3503,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,Two good lessons may be learned from the story: Never believe any one
3504,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,guilty who is not really proved to be so. Never let false shame keep you
3505,THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.,"from confessing the truth, whether trifling or of importance."

3635,AUNT POLLY SHEDD'S BRIGADE.,youngsters spent the three days that the British occupied our houses. I
3636,AUNT POLLY SHEDD'S BRIGADE.,was about twelve years old at the time. I remember that it was just as

4321,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4322,CARYL'S PLUM.,"She fairly hugged herself in glee, then drew one long breath and dashed"

4324,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4325,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, you here, Viny?"" she exclaimed in surprise as she flung open the"

4328,CARYL'S PLUM.,A small figure rose to a perpendicular position in front of the old
4329,CARYL'S PLUM.,"bureau, while a shoving-to of the under drawer proclaimed some attention"
4330,CARYL'S PLUM.,"having been paid to the pretty laces, ribbons, and various other"
4331,CARYL'S PLUM.,adornments packed away for safe keeping.
4332,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4333,CARYL'S PLUM.,Caryl remembered leaving the key in the drawer after taking out a bit of
4334,CARYL'S PLUM.,lavender ribbon the night before for Aunt Sylvia's cap.
4335,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4336,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""What have you been doing?"" she asked sharply; and taking hold of the"
4337,CARYL'S PLUM.,"small wiry shoulder, she looked down into a little black face whose eyes"
4338,CARYL'S PLUM.,were staring solemnly into the farthest corner of the room.
4339,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4340,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Ben doin'?"" repeated Viny, scared almost to death inwardly, but"
4341,CARYL'S PLUM.,"preserving a cool exterior. ""Nothin', only shettin' the draw'; plaguey"

4347,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Dar,"" said Viny, with a violent twist, so that she could compass the"

4350,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4351,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, no, you didn't,"" contradicted Caryl, looking her through and"
4352,CARYL'S PLUM.,"through, and giving her a small shake, ""tear that either; I heard Maum"

4371,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4372,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Why, go to a new place,"" said Caryl, laughing in spite of herself. ""For"
4373,CARYL'S PLUM.,"mercy's sake, child, do take your eyes in! It'll be very fine, Viny, oh,"
4374,CARYL'S PLUM.,"so fine!"" she cried enthusiastically."

4390,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4391,CARYL'S PLUM.,"She scampered in the greatest excitement to the door, when a detaining"

4393,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4394,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""You are crazy, child!"" exclaimed Caryl, bursting into a laugh and"
4395,CARYL'S PLUM.,"holding her fast. ""We can't go this moment, no matter how bad the old"
4396,CARYL'S PLUM.,"house is. Listen, Viny!"""
4397,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4398,CARYL'S PLUM.,But the small figure flung itself into a heap on the floor so suddenly
4399,CARYL'S PLUM.,"that she nearly pulled her young mistress with her, while the little"
4400,CARYL'S PLUM.,"black hands clapped themselves over the bead like eyes, wail after wail"
4401,CARYL'S PLUM.,of disappointment making the room to ring.
4402,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4403,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Will you STOP!"" cried Caryl in perfect despair. ""Aunt Sylvia's head"
4404,CARYL'S PLUM.,"will snap with your noise! If you don't stop crying, Viny, you sha'n't"

4406,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4407,CARYL'S PLUM.,Threats had the power to do what nothing else could. Viny wiped off all
4408,CARYL'S PLUM.,"the tears with the backs of her grimy little paws, gave two or three"
4409,CARYL'S PLUM.,"concluding sniffs, sat up straight, and was immediately all right for"
4410,CARYL'S PLUM.,further developments.
4411,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4412,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Now then""--Caryl pointed off her sentences briskly on the tips of her"

4415,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4416,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Viny's eyes widened fearfully, but she didn't stir."

4423,CARYL'S PLUM.,"well."""
4424,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4425,CARYL'S PLUM.,Caryl's gray eyes were only a thought less big than those of her small
4426,CARYL'S PLUM.,"black audience, who presently caught the infectious enthusiasm and"
4427,CARYL'S PLUM.,emitted several lusty crows.

4435,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, I didn't--I will--O Jiminy! yes, I will!"" cried the little black"

4445,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4446,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""I know how,"" said Viny, perfectly overcome with the greatness thrust"
4447,CARYL'S PLUM.,"upon her; ""it's to slip crickets under her feet to put her toes onter."
4448,CARYL'S PLUM.,"I'll slip 'em all day. An' it's to wipe her specs, an' to say yes, no,"
4449,CARYL'S PLUM.,"an' to--"""

4459,CARYL'S PLUM.,"try."""
4460,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4461,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Viny, having been duly elected to office, considered her honors"
4462,CARYL'S PLUM.,"settled, so she was little disturbed by any opinions that might be held"
4463,CARYL'S PLUM.,"concerning her. Therefore she squatted and wriggled in great delight,"
4464,CARYL'S PLUM.,grinning at every word that fell from her young mistress' lips.
4465,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4466,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""You see, Viny,"" Caryl was saying, beginning on her confidence, ""I've"

4472,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4473,CARYL'S PLUM.,This was the upstairs southwest corner of a little cottage that for a
4474,CARYL'S PLUM.,year or more had been the desideratum of the young girl's highest hopes
4475,CARYL'S PLUM.,"that had to wear themselves out in empty longings, the invalid's scanty"
4476,CARYL'S PLUM.,"exchequer only sufficing for doctor's bills and similar twelvemonth,"
4477,CARYL'S PLUM.,along with several other broken-down lodgers whose slender means
4478,CARYL'S PLUM.,"compelled them to call this place ""home""--this place where never a bit"
4479,CARYL'S PLUM.,of sunshine seemed to come; where even the birds hated to stop for a
4480,CARYL'S PLUM.,song as they flew merrily over the tree-tops. And no wonder. The trees
4481,CARYL'S PLUM.,"were scraggy, loppy old things hanging down in dismal sweep over the"
4482,CARYL'S PLUM.,"leaky roof and damp walls. They had to stay--the lodgers, but the birds"
4483,CARYL'S PLUM.,and the sunshine tossed off the whole responsibility of life in such a
4484,CARYL'S PLUM.,"gloomy old home, and flitted to gayer quarters. But now, what if Heart's"
4485,CARYL'S PLUM.,Delight could really be theirs!
4486,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4487,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Yer goin' ter tell 'em how to paint dem tings yer daub?"" broke in Viny,"

4493,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4494,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Ho, ho!"" laughed the small black figure, nowise impressed and cramming"
4495,CARYL'S PLUM.,her stumpy fingers up to her mouth to keep the laugh in as she saw her
4496,CARYL'S PLUM.,"young mistress' displeasure. ""It's an awful old dirty muss, an' I wish I"

4498,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4499,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""And I shall begin tomorrow,"" declared Caryl with still greater dignity,"
4500,CARYL'S PLUM.,"and drawing herself to her full height. ""Aunt Sylvia says she'll try"

4507,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Heart's Delight--Heart's Delight!"" sang Caryl's happy voice all that"
4508,CARYL'S PLUM.,"day; and like St. Patrick's poor imprisoned snake, she began to feel"
4509,CARYL'S PLUM.,that to-morrow would never come.
4510,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4511,CARYL'S PLUM.,"But hours come and go, and Caryl awoke the next morning, the brightest,"
4512,CARYL'S PLUM.,cheeriest morning that ever called a happy girl out of bed.

4514,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Aunt Sylvia won't have many more days in that dark little room of"

4550,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""My old auntie is just LOVELY,"" cried the girl, hopping off from the"
4551,CARYL'S PLUM.,"bed, and flying around merrily, well pleased at last when the invalid"
4552,CARYL'S PLUM.,"was in her chair, to see a little faint, pink color stealing up the wan"

4583,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4584,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Missis ud feel more like folks,"" she said at each disdainful scrutiny,"
4585,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""an' like as not git well, ef we cud cut sticks inter anudder home. Ef"
4586,CARYL'S PLUM.,"de chile only CUD do it!"""
4587,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4588,CARYL'S PLUM.,"She peered anxiously down the dirty little brick walk again, then"
4589,CARYL'S PLUM.,fetched a still longer sigh.
4590,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4591,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""I don't darst to!"" she declared in a mighty burst at last. ""I don't,"
4592,CARYL'S PLUM.,cos wot ud keep us all from the pore-'us den. It's every speck I kin do
4593,CARYL'S PLUM.,ter keep along of de Miss an' Car'l an' take keer of 'em wi'dout a cent

4595,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4596,CARYL'S PLUM.,Maum Patty always spoke of her scanty savings deposited in the
4597,CARYL'S PLUM.,"neighboring bank, in this way, fondly supposing them in the original"
4598,CARYL'S PLUM.,"condition in which ten years ago, she had taken them there for future"
4599,CARYL'S PLUM.,shield against sickness and old age.
4600,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4601,CARYL'S PLUM.,Meantime the little black nurse had begun her work.
4602,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4603,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Peering around Miss Sylvia's half-closed door, Viny exclaimed to"
4604,CARYL'S PLUM.,"herself, ""Umph! she don't want me; guess she's a'readin' now. I'll git"
4605,CARYL'S PLUM.,into Miss Ca's room an' try on all her clo'es an' pertend I'm makin'
4606,CARYL'S PLUM.,"calls, an' peek inter ebery single place whar I kin, an' I'll be a lady,"
4607,CARYL'S PLUM.,"an' dar sha'n't no one scold Viny."""
4608,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4609,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Viny,"" called Miss Sylvia's soft voice, hearing a rustle at the door."
4610,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4611,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Dat's Jip she's a-talkin' ter, I reckon,"" said Viny, stealing off on"
4612,CARYL'S PLUM.,"her tiptoes down the hall, and sticking her fingers in her ears that she"
4613,CARYL'S PLUM.,"might hear no more troublesome conscience calls; ""I seen him on de rug"
4614,CARYL'S PLUM.,"when I peeked in de crack. Now den--Whoop, says I, WHOOP!"""
4615,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4616,CARYL'S PLUM.,"She was safe now in Caryl's room, where the first thing she did was"
4617,CARYL'S PLUM.,"to indulge in a series of somersaults over the floor, and also, for"
4618,CARYL'S PLUM.,"variety, over the neat little white bed. These afforded her intense"
4619,CARYL'S PLUM.,comfort. When she came up bright and shining after this celebration of
4620,CARYL'S PLUM.,"her independence, she drew herself up with a serious face and proceeded"
4621,CARYL'S PLUM.,at once to stern business.
4622,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4623,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Two hours ain't long,"" she observed wisely, ""an' I mus' be back some"
4624,CARYL'S PLUM.,"of de time. Jiminy! she's forgot de key again!"" In truth, Caryl in"
4625,CARYL'S PLUM.,her great excitement of hunting for some pictures packed away in her
4626,CARYL'S PLUM.,"precious drawer, had forgotten to pocket the key that protected her few"
4627,CARYL'S PLUM.,treasures.
4628,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4629,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Ruthlessly, then, they were pulled out and overhauled, while Viny"
4630,CARYL'S PLUM.,"reveled in each new discovery, chattering softly to herself in glee. She"
4631,CARYL'S PLUM.,"tied on all the bright bits of ribbons she could lay her hands on,"
4632,CARYL'S PLUM.,to the little tiny tails adorning her head. She twisted with great
4633,CARYL'S PLUM.,difficulty into a delicate white spenser that Caryl's mother had worn
4634,CARYL'S PLUM.,"when a girl, saved for its tender reminiscence, and for the soft, fine"
4635,CARYL'S PLUM.,old lace that would be of use to the young daughter by and by. Viny
4636,CARYL'S PLUM.,was nowise disturbed in her enjoyment at certain ominous crackings
4637,CARYL'S PLUM.,and creakings that proclaimed the giving way of the delicate material.
4638,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Arrayed at last to her satisfaction, although the lace did hang down in"
4639,CARYL'S PLUM.,"some shreds where her impatient fingers had clutched it, she whirled and"
4640,CARYL'S PLUM.,"whirled in front of the old-fashioned glass with many grimaces, trying"
4641,CARYL'S PLUM.,the effect of her new costume.
4642,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4643,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""I want sumfin to shine,"" she said at last, tired of this; ""jew-EL-lery"
4644,CARYL'S PLUM.,"an' stuns. Le's see ef she's got any."""
4645,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4646,CARYL'S PLUM.,Now in one corner of Caryl's drawer was a small black box;
4647,CARYL'S PLUM.,"unfortunately, the lock was broken in childhood, and there had been no"
4648,CARYL'S PLUM.,"money to spare for repairs of anything of that sort, so she had tied it"
4649,CARYL'S PLUM.,"securely with the strongest of twine, and written on the cover in big"
4650,CARYL'S PLUM.,"schoolgirl hand the words, ""DON'T ANY ONE DARE TO TOUCH!"" Although Viny"
4651,CARYL'S PLUM.,"was unable to decipher the writing in the least, it was fun enough to"
4652,CARYL'S PLUM.,"attack the string, which presently succumbed to the violent onslaught of"
4653,CARYL'S PLUM.,"tooth and nail, and the precious, precious bits of brightness were soon"
4654,CARYL'S PLUM.,at the mercy of the little black fingers.
4655,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4656,CARYL'S PLUM.,Maum Patty was droning away in the kitchen some old Methodist hymns.
4657,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Viny was dimly conscious of a faint call from the invalid's room, as"
4658,CARYL'S PLUM.,she drew out in the utmost delight an old-fashioned brooch with a green
4659,CARYL'S PLUM.,centre around which were some little sparkling things.
4660,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4661,CARYL'S PLUM.,"She couldn't even say ""Jiminy!"" but simply held the pretty thing which"
4662,CARYL'S PLUM.,"seemed glad of its freedom from solitary confinement, and thus delighted"
4663,CARYL'S PLUM.,to sparkle more than ever in its resting-place in the little black
4664,CARYL'S PLUM.,hand. With trembling fingers she fastened it into the centre of the lace
4665,CARYL'S PLUM.,"spenser, above her naughty little bosom, hurrying to the glass to do so,"
4666,CARYL'S PLUM.,"and had just taken one look, when a low cry of distress struck upon her"
4667,CARYL'S PLUM.,ear.
4668,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4669,CARYL'S PLUM.,"It filled her whole soul with dismay, rooting her like a little frozen"
4670,CARYL'S PLUM.,"thing to the spot. It was Miss Sylvia, she knew."
4671,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4672,CARYL'S PLUM.,"With one mighty effort she tore herself from the spot, and rushed"
4673,CARYL'S PLUM.,"headlong into the hall. ""Oh--oh--OH!"" came from the invalid's room."
4674,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4675,CARYL'S PLUM.,At that Viny wrung her hands and writhed in dire distress.
4676,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4677,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""She's a-dyin'!"" she gasped, her knees knocking together in a lively"
4678,CARYL'S PLUM.,"manner; ""I don't darst to look--I don't!--I've killed her!"" And the"
4679,CARYL'S PLUM.,"whole flood of remorse sweeping her very soul, she turned and scuttled"
4680,CARYL'S PLUM.,down the crooked little stairs and into the street.
4681,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4682,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""A doctor!"" was all her thought. She remembered hearing Caryl say he"
4683,CARYL'S PLUM.,lived in a big brown house that had lots of flowers in the windows. But
4684,CARYL'S PLUM.,"where upon the face of the earth the house was situated, Viny knew no"
4685,CARYL'S PLUM.,"more than a bird. However, she must get him, so she dashed blindly on,"
4686,CARYL'S PLUM.,turning the first corner to run headlong into the arms of a portly old
4687,CARYL'S PLUM.,lady who was placidly enjoying the fresh air and sunshine at the same
4688,CARYL'S PLUM.,time that she displayed her rich street attire.
4689,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4690,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, my goodness!"" cried the old lady, startled out of all fine speeches"
4691,CARYL'S PLUM.,"by the collision, and jumping in fright to the extreme edge of the"
4692,CARYL'S PLUM.,"curbstone. Then seeing the cause, she cried in anger, ""You miserable,"
4693,CARYL'S PLUM.,"dirty little thing you, you ve nearly killed me!"""
4694,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4695,CARYL'S PLUM.,"At the word ""killed,"" Viny began to dance in terror on the sidewalk. ""I"
4696,CARYL'S PLUM.,"know it,"" she cried, ""oh, dear, I know it! she's dead, an' grandma 'll"
4697,CARYL'S PLUM.,"beat me."""
4698,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4699,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""And if you don't know any better,"" cried the old lady, vainly trying to"
4700,CARYL'S PLUM.,"settle her gray puffs as they were before, ""than to run into people in"
4701,CARYL'S PLUM.,"this way, I'll have you arrested, I will!"""
4702,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4703,CARYL'S PLUM.,At this Viny was completely overcome. Her guilty conscience pictured all
4704,CARYL'S PLUM.,"sorts of punishments; worse, far worse, than ""grandma's"" judgments, and,"
4705,CARYL'S PLUM.,"falling on her knees, she grasped the old lady's black satin gown and"
4706,CARYL'S PLUM.,implored for mercy.
4707,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4708,CARYL'S PLUM.,"The old lady, now her attention was drawn off from her own annoyance,"
4709,CARYL'S PLUM.,settled her eyes on the brooch half concealed by a fold of the little
4710,CARYL'S PLUM.,lace spenser.
4711,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4712,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""You wicked, bad child!"" she exclaimed, seizing her arm and pouncing one"
4713,CARYL'S PLUM.,"stiffly gloved hand on the sparkling brooch; ""you've stolen that! It's"
4714,CARYL'S PLUM.,"bad enough to be run into by a dirty little thing fresh from Bedlam,"
4715,CARYL'S PLUM.,"without being wicked into the bargain. That's TOO much!"""
4716,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4717,CARYL'S PLUM.,"The little black figure being too wretched to hear this tirade, could"
4718,CARYL'S PLUM.,only mumble and wail and wriggle closer and closer into the folds of the
4719,CARYL'S PLUM.,rich gown.
4720,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4721,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Get out of my dress!"" cried the old lady excitedly. ""Here, I'll"
4722,CARYL'S PLUM.,"call the police; if you don't let go of me this instant! Stop, I say!"
4723,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Po-o-lice!"""
4724,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4725,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Viny gave one violent jerk that brought her up to her feet, and with"
4726,CARYL'S PLUM.,"eyes distended in terror, started in wild despair across the street."
4727,CARYL'S PLUM.,A pair of handsome bays were coming in their best step down from the
4728,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Square, drawing a carriage full of people who seemed in the very best of"
4729,CARYL'S PLUM.,spirits.
4730,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4731,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""WHOA-A!"" A click, a rapid pull-up with all Thomas's best strength, and"
4732,CARYL'S PLUM.,the horses fell back on their haunches just in time for the little lithe
4733,CARYL'S PLUM.,figure to dart under their pawing hoofs and be saved! Everybody leaned
4734,CARYL'S PLUM.,out of the carriage for a glimpse of the child.
4735,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4736,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Why--why""--A young girl's face paled, while the gray eyes flashed, and"
4737,CARYL'S PLUM.,with one spring she was out and rushing after the small flying figure
4738,CARYL'S PLUM.,who in her fright had turned to flee the other way.
4739,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4740,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Look out, Caryl!"" called the others in the carriage after her."
4741,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4742,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, she'll be killed,"" moaned a little girl leaning out as far as she"
4743,CARYL'S PLUM.,dared over the wheels.
4744,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4745,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""And then she can't ever get into the pretty new house,"" wailed another."
4746,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Oh, what shall we do! Come back, Bessie!"" she cried, tugging at her"
4747,CARYL'S PLUM.,"sister's skirts. ""Grandmamma, make her come into the carriage, I can't"
4748,CARYL'S PLUM.,"hold her!"""
4749,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4750,CARYL'S PLUM.,"But a crowd of people surging up around them at this moment, took off"
4751,CARYL'S PLUM.,all attention from Bessie and everybody else but the little fugitive
4752,CARYL'S PLUM.,and her kind pursuer. Caryl made her way through the crowd with flushed
4753,CARYL'S PLUM.,"face, her little brown hat hanging by its strings around her neck,"
4754,CARYL'S PLUM.,pantingly dragging after her the little black girl.
4755,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4756,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""It's our Viny,"" she said, ""and something is the matter with Aunt"
4757,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Sylvia! Oh, Madam Grant!"""
4758,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4759,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""My poor child,"" said a sweet-faced woman, reaching out a kind arm,"
4760,CARYL'S PLUM.,"while the children seized hold of Caryl at every available point,"
4761,CARYL'S PLUM.,"between them dragging her and her charge into shelter, ""don't be"
4762,CARYL'S PLUM.,"troubled. Drive just as fast as you can, Thomas, to No. 27, you know,"""
4763,CARYL'S PLUM.,she commanded hurriedly.
4764,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4765,CARYL'S PLUM.,Then the first thing Caryl did was to turn upon Viny and unhook the
4766,CARYL'S PLUM.,"precious brooch as a low sob came from her white lips. ""If it had been"
4767,CARYL'S PLUM.,"lost!"""
4768,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4769,CARYL'S PLUM.,A soft hand stole under the little brown cloak to clasp her own; but
4770,CARYL'S PLUM.,Madam Grant said never a word. She knew what the young girl's heart was
4771,CARYL'S PLUM.,too full for speech; that the mother's brooch would speak more tenderly
4772,CARYL'S PLUM.,"than ever she could, of forgiveness to the little ignorant black girl."
4773,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4774,CARYL'S PLUM.,"The children were all eyes at Viny and her costume, but they said never"
4775,CARYL'S PLUM.,"a word while she howled on steadily, only ejaculating in an occasional"
4776,CARYL'S PLUM.,"gust, ""O Miss Sylvy--Miss Sylvy!"""
4777,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4778,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Caryl, white as a sheet, rushed out of the carriage and into the old"
4779,CARYL'S PLUM.,lodging house the instant the horses paused by the broken gate. Maum
4780,CARYL'S PLUM.,Patty was singing in the little kitchen the refrain she never indulged
4781,CARYL'S PLUM.,"in except in her most complacent moods. Flinging wide the door, Caryl"
4782,CARYL'S PLUM.,"panted out, ""Oh, what is it! Tell me at once!"""
4783,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4784,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Lawks!"" exclaimed Maum Patty, startled from her peaceful enjoyment, and"
4785,CARYL'S PLUM.,turning so suddenly in the old calico-covered chair that she sent her
4786,CARYL'S PLUM.,"spectacles spinning into the middle of the floor. ""Massy, how yer look!"
4787,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Tain't wurth it--don't! He hain't spile't it; I stopped him,"" she added"
4788,CARYL'S PLUM.,exultingly.
4789,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4790,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Stopped what?"" echoed Caryl in bewildered distress. ""Oh, do tell me!"
4791,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Is'nt Aunt Sylvia sick? Tell me, Maum Patty,"" she pleaded. And she"
4792,CARYL'S PLUM.,grasped the old woman's arm in an agony of suspense.
4793,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4794,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Massy, no!"" declared Maum Patty in her most cheery tones, ""she's ben"
4795,CARYL'S PLUM.,"a-laughin' fit to kill herself, an' I don't wonder, for the little"
4796,CARYL'S PLUM.,"rascal looked as cunnin' as an imp. But I stopped him I stopped him!"""
4797,CARYL'S PLUM.,she added triumphantly.
4798,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4799,CARYL'S PLUM.,"Caryl had no strength to ask further, nor to stir. The reaction was too"
4800,CARYL'S PLUM.,"great, and she leaned up against the door for support."
4801,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4802,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""He shuck it, an' shuck it,"" said the old woman, laughing immoderately."
4803,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Laws, how he shuck it--dat Jip did--yer aunt's beyeutiful cap with the"

4812,CARYL'S PLUM.,
4813,CARYL'S PLUM.,"""Viny,"" said Caryl, in her little room, an hour after, when everything"
4814,CARYL'S PLUM.,had been confessed and forgiven; when the delightful story had all come
4815,CARYL'S PLUM.,"out, how they were really and truly to move that very afternoon; how"
4816,CARYL'S PLUM.,Madam Grant had paid the rent in advance for the sunny rooms in the
4817,CARYL'S PLUM.,"little cottage, and they were just driving around to surprise Aunt"
4818,CARYL'S PLUM.,Sylvia when they witnessed Viny's escapade; how the carriage was to come

4820,CARYL'S PLUM.,the price of the lessons was to go for new furniture; how everything
4821,CARYL'S PLUM.,"for the rest of their lives was to be cheery, winsome, and bright to"
4822,CARYL'S PLUM.,"the very last degree--when it was all finished, Caryl looked kindly"
4823,CARYL'S PLUM.,"down into the sorry little black face--""Yes, Viny,"" she said with the"
4824,CARYL'S PLUM.,"happiest little laugh, ""I shall have to forgive you, for it's the last"
