92,KING COLE,[Illustration]
93,KING COLE,
94,KING COLE,"King Cole was King before the troubles came,"
95,KING COLE,"The land was happy while he held the helm,"
96,KING COLE,"The valley-land from Condicote to Thame,"
97,KING COLE,Watered by Thames and green with many an elm.
98,KING COLE,"For many a year he governed well his realm,"
99,KING COLE,"So well-beloved, that, when at last he died,"
100,KING COLE,It was bereavement to the countryside.
101,KING COLE,
102,KING COLE,"So good, so well-beloved, had he been"
103,KING COLE,"In life, that when he reached the judging-place"
104,KING COLE,"(There where the scales are even, the sword keen),"
105,KING COLE,"The Acquitting Judges granted him a grace,"
106,KING COLE,"Aught he might choose, red, black, from king to ace,"
107,KING COLE,Beneath the bright arch of the heaven's span;
108,KING COLE,"He chose, to wander earth, the friend of man."
109,KING COLE,
110,KING COLE,"So, since that time, he wanders shore and shire,"
111,KING COLE,"An old, poor, wandering man, with glittering eyes"
112,KING COLE,Helping distressful folk to their desire
113,KING COLE,By power of spirit that within him lies.
114,KING COLE,"Gentle he is, and quiet, and most wise,"
115,KING COLE,"He wears a ragged grey, he sings sweet words,"
116,KING COLE,And where he walks there flutter little birds.
117,KING COLE,
118,KING COLE,And when the planets glow as dusk begins
119,KING COLE,He pipes a wooden flute to music old.
120,KING COLE,"Men hear him on the downs, in lonely inns,"
121,KING COLE,"In valley woods, or up the Chiltern wold;"
122,KING COLE,"His piping feeds the starved and warms the cold,"
123,KING COLE,It gives the beaten courage; to the lost
124,KING COLE,"It brings back faith, that lodestar of the ghost."
125,KING COLE,
126,KING COLE,"And most he haunts the beech-tree-pasturing chalk,"
127,KING COLE,The Downs and Chilterns with the Thames between.
128,KING COLE,"There still the Berkshire shepherds see him walk,"
129,KING COLE,"Searching the unhelped woe with instinct keen,"
130,KING COLE,"His old hat stuck with never-withering green,"
131,KING COLE,"His flute in poke, and little singings sweet"
132,KING COLE,Coming from birds that flutter at his feet.
133,KING COLE,
134,KING COLE,"Not long ago a circus wandered there,"
135,KING COLE,"Where good King Cole most haunts the public way,"
136,KING COLE,Coming from Reading for St. Giles's Fair
137,KING COLE,Through rain unceasing since Augustine's Day;
138,KING COLE,"The horses spent, the waggons splashed with clay,"
139,KING COLE,"The men with heads bowed to the wester roaring,"
140,KING COLE,Heaving the van-wheels up the hill at Goring.
141,KING COLE,
142,KING COLE,"Wearily plodding up the hill they went,"
143,KING COLE,"Broken by bitter weather and the luck,"
144,KING COLE,"Six vans, and one long waggon with the tent,"
145,KING COLE,"And piebald horses following in the muck,"
146,KING COLE,"Dragging their tired hooves out with a suck,"
147,KING COLE,"And heaving on, like some defeated tribe"
148,KING COLE,Bound for Despair with Death upon their kibe.
149,KING COLE,
150,KING COLE,"All through the morn the circus floundered thus,"
151,KING COLE,"The nooning found them at the Crossing Roads,"
152,KING COLE,Stopped by an axle splitting in its truss.
153,KING COLE,The horses drooped and stared before their loads.
154,KING COLE,"Dark with the wet they were, and cold as toads."
155,KING COLE,"The men were busy with the foundered van,"
156,KING COLE,"The showman stood apart, a beaten man."
157,KING COLE,
158,KING COLE,"He did not heed the dripping of the rain,"
159,KING COLE,"Nor the wood's roaring, nor the blotted hill,"
160,KING COLE,"He stood apart and bit upon his pain,"
161,KING COLE,Biting the bitter meal with bitter will.
162,KING COLE,"Focussed upon himself, he stood, stock still,"
163,KING COLE,"Staring unseeing, while his mind repeated,"
164,KING COLE,"""This is the end; I'm ruined; I'm defeated."""
165,KING COLE,
166,KING COLE,From time to time a haggard woman's face
167,KING COLE,"Peered at him from a van, and then withdrew;"
168,KING COLE,
169,KING COLE,[Illustration:
170,KING COLE,"_Within the cowboy's van the rat-eyed wife,"
171,KING COLE,Her reddish hair in papers twisted close.
172,KING COLE,"Turned wet potatoes round against the knife,"
173,KING COLE,And in a bucket dropped the peelèd Oes._
174,KING COLE,]
175,KING COLE,
176,KING COLE,"Seeds from the hayrack blew about the place,"
177,KING COLE,"The smoke out of the waggon chimneys blew,"
178,KING COLE,From wicker creel the skinny cockerel crew.
179,KING COLE,The men who set the floundered axle straight
180,KING COLE,"Glanced at their chief, and each man nudged his mate."
181,KING COLE,
182,KING COLE,"And one, the second clown, a snub-nosed youth,"
183,KING COLE,"Fair-haired, with broken teeth, discoloured black,"
184,KING COLE,"Muttered, ""He looks a treat, and that's the truth."
185,KING COLE,"I've had enough: I've given him the sack."""
186,KING COLE,"He took his wrench, arose, and stretched his back,"
187,KING COLE,"Swore at a piebald pony trying to bite,"
188,KING COLE,And rolled a cigarette and begged a light.
189,KING COLE,
190,KING COLE,"Within, the second's wife, who leaped the hoops,"
191,KING COLE,"Nursed sour twins, her son and jealousy,"
192,KING COLE,"Thinking of love, in luckier, happier troupes"
193,KING COLE,Known on the roads in summers now gone by
194,KING COLE,"Before her husband had a roving eye,"
195,KING COLE,Before the rat-eyed baggage with red hair
196,KING COLE,Came to do tight rope and make trouble there.
197,KING COLE,
198,KING COLE,"Beside the vans, the clown, old Circus John,"
199,KING COLE,"Growled to the juggler as he sucked his briar,"
200,KING COLE,"""How all the marrow of a show was gone"
201,KING COLE,"Since women came, to sing and walk the wire,"
202,KING COLE,"Killing the clown his act for half his hire,"
203,KING COLE,"Killing the circus trade: because,"" said he,"
204,KING COLE,"""Horses and us are what men want to see."""
205,KING COLE,
206,KING COLE,"The juggler was a young man shaven-clean,"
207,KING COLE,"Even in the mud his dainty way he had,"
208,KING COLE,"Red-cheeked, with eyes like boxer's, quick and keen,"
209,KING COLE,"A jockey-looking youth with legs besprad,"
210,KING COLE,"Humming in baritone a ditty sad,"
211,KING COLE,"And tapping on his teeth his finger-nails,"
212,KING COLE,The while the clown suckt pipe and spat his tales.
213,KING COLE,
214,KING COLE,"Molly, the singer, watched him wearily"
215,KING COLE,"With big black eyes that love had brimmed with tears,"
216,KING COLE,"Her mop of short cut hair was blown awry,"
217,KING COLE,Her firm mouth shewed her wiser than her years.
218,KING COLE,"She stroked a piebald horse and pulled his ears,"
219,KING COLE,"And kissed his muzzle, while her eyes betrayed"
220,KING COLE,"This, that she loved the juggler, not the jade."
221,KING COLE,
222,KING COLE,And growling in a group the music stood
223,KING COLE,"Sucking short pipes, their backs against the rain,"
224,KING COLE,"Plotting rebellion in a bitter mood,"
225,KING COLE,"""A shilling more, or never play again."""
226,KING COLE,"Their old great coats were foul with many a stain,"
227,KING COLE,"Weather and living rough had stamped their faces,"
228,KING COLE,"They were cast clerks, old sailors, old hard cases."
229,KING COLE,
230,KING COLE,"Within the cowboy's van the rat-eyed wife,"
231,KING COLE,"Her reddish hair in papers twisted close,"
232,KING COLE,"Turned wet potatoes round against the knife,"
233,KING COLE,And in a bucket dropped the peelèd Oes.
234,KING COLE,"Her little girl was howling from her blows,"
235,KING COLE,The cowboy smoked and with a spanner whackt
236,KING COLE,The metal target of his shooting act.
237,KING COLE,
238,KING COLE,And in another van more children cried
239,KING COLE,From being beaten or for being chid
240,KING COLE,"By fathers cross or mothers haggard-eyed,"
241,KING COLE,Made savage by the fortunes that betide.
242,KING COLE,The rain dripped from the waggons: the drops glid
243,KING COLE,Along the pony's flanks; the thick boots stamped
244,KING COLE,"The running muck for warmth, and hope was damped."
245,KING COLE,
246,KING COLE,"Yet all of that small troupe in misery stuck,"
247,KING COLE,Were there by virtue of their nature's choosing
248,KING COLE,"To be themselves and take the season's luck,"
249,KING COLE,Counting the being artists worth the bruising.
250,KING COLE,"To be themselves, as artists, even if losing"
251,KING COLE,"Wealth, comfort, health, in doing as they chose,"
252,KING COLE,Alone of all life's ways brought peace to those.
253,KING COLE,
254,KING COLE,"So there below the forlorn woods, they grumbled,"
255,KING COLE,Stamping for warmth and shaking off the rain.
256,KING COLE,"Under the foundered van the tinkers fumbled,"
257,KING COLE,Fishing the splitted truss with wedge and chain.
258,KING COLE,"Soon, all was done, the van could go again,"
259,KING COLE,"Men cracked their whips, the horses' shoulders forged"
260,KING COLE,Up to the collar while the mud disgorged.
261,KING COLE,
262,KING COLE,"So with a jangling of their chains they went,"
263,KING COLE,"Lean horses, swaying vans and creaking wheels,"
264,KING COLE,Bright raindrops tilting off the van roof pent
265,KING COLE,"And reedy cockerels crying in the creels,"
266,KING COLE,"Smoke driving down, men's shouts and children's squeals,"
267,KING COLE,"Whips cracking, and the hayrack sheddings blowing;"
268,KING COLE,The Showman stood aside to watch them going.
269,KING COLE,
270,KING COLE,"What with the rain and misery making mad,"
271,KING COLE,The Showman never saw a stranger come
272,KING COLE,"Till there he stood, a stranger roughly clad"
273,KING COLE,In ragged grey of woollen spun at home.
274,KING COLE,"Green sprigs were in his hat, and other some"
275,KING COLE,"Stuck in his coat; he bore a wooden flute,"
276,KING COLE,And redbreasts hopped and carolled at his foot.
277,KING COLE,
278,KING COLE,"It was King Cole, who smiled and spoke to him."
279,KING COLE,
280,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
281,KING COLE,
282,KING COLE,The mend will hold until you reach a wright.
283,KING COLE,Where do you play?
284,KING COLE,
285,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
286,KING COLE,
287,KING COLE,In Wallingford to-night.
288,KING COLE,
289,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
290,KING COLE,
291,KING COLE,There are great doings there.
292,KING COLE,
293,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
294,KING COLE,
295,KING COLE,I know of none.
296,KING COLE,
297,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
298,KING COLE,
299,KING COLE,The Prince will lay the Hall's foundation stone
300,KING COLE,This afternoon: he and the Queen are there.
301,KING COLE,
302,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
303,KING COLE,
304,KING COLE,"Lord, keep this showman patient, lest he swear."
305,KING COLE,
306,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
307,KING COLE,
308,KING COLE,Why should you swear? Be glad; your town is filled.
309,KING COLE,
310,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
311,KING COLE,
312,KING COLE,What use are crowds to me with business killed?
313,KING COLE,
314,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
315,KING COLE,
316,KING COLE,I see no cause for business to be crosst.
317,KING COLE,
318,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
319,KING COLE,
320,KING COLE,"Counter-attractions, man, at public cost."
321,KING COLE,"Fireworks, dancing, bonfires, soldiers, speeches."
322,KING COLE,In all my tour along the river's reaches
323,KING COLE,I've had ill-luck: I've clashed with public feasts.
324,KING COLE,"At Wycombe fair, we met performing beasts,"
325,KING COLE,"At Henley, waxworks, and at Maidenhead"
326,KING COLE,The Psyche woman talking with the dead.
327,KING COLE,"At Bray, we met the rain, at Reading, flood,"
328,KING COLE,"At Pangbourne, politics, at Goring, mud."
329,KING COLE,"Now here, at Wallingford, the Royal Pair."
330,KING COLE,"Counter-attraction killing everywhere,"
331,KING COLE,Killing a circus dead: God give me peace;
332,KING COLE,"If this be living, death will be release."
333,KING COLE,"By God, it brims the cup; it fills the can."
334,KING COLE,What trade are you?
335,KING COLE,
336,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
337,KING COLE,
338,KING COLE,I am a wandering man.
339,KING COLE,
340,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
341,KING COLE,
342,KING COLE,"You mean, a tramp who flutes for bread and pence?"
343,KING COLE,
344,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
345,KING COLE,
346,KING COLE,"I come, and flute, and then I wander thence."
347,KING COLE,
348,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
349,KING COLE,
350,KING COLE,"Quicksilver Tom, who couldn't keep his place."
351,KING COLE,
352,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
353,KING COLE,
354,KING COLE,"My race being run, I love to watch the race."
355,KING COLE,
356,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
357,KING COLE,
358,KING COLE,You ought to seek your rest.
359,KING COLE,
360,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
361,KING COLE,
362,KING COLE,"My rest is this,"
363,KING COLE,"The world of men, wherever trouble is."
364,KING COLE,
365,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
366,KING COLE,
367,KING COLE,"If trouble rests you, God! your life is rest."
368,KING COLE,
369,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
370,KING COLE,
371,KING COLE,"Even the sun keeps moving, east to west."
372,KING COLE,
373,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
374,KING COLE,
375,KING COLE,Little he gets by moving; less than I.
376,KING COLE,
377,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
378,KING COLE,
379,KING COLE,He sees the great green world go floating by.
380,KING COLE,
381,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
382,KING COLE,
383,KING COLE,"A sorry sight to see, when all is said."
384,KING COLE,Why don't you set to work?
385,KING COLE,
386,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
387,KING COLE,
388,KING COLE,I have no trade.
389,KING COLE,
390,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
391,KING COLE,
392,KING COLE,Where is your home?
393,KING COLE,
394,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
395,KING COLE,
396,KING COLE,"All gone, a long time past."
397,KING COLE,
398,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
399,KING COLE,
400,KING COLE,Your children then?
401,KING COLE,
402,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
403,KING COLE,
404,KING COLE,"All dead, sir, even the last."
405,KING COLE,I am a lonely man; no kith nor kin.
406,KING COLE,
407,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
408,KING COLE,
409,KING COLE,"There is no joy in life when deaths begin,"
410,KING COLE,"I know it, I. How long is't since you ate?"
411,KING COLE,
412,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
413,KING COLE,
414,KING COLE,It was so long ago that I forget.
415,KING COLE,
416,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
417,KING COLE,
418,KING COLE,The proverb says a man can always find
419,KING COLE,One sorrier than himself in state and mind.
420,KING COLE,"'Fore George, it's true. Well, come, then, to the van."
421,KING COLE,"Jane, can you find a meal for this poor man?"
422,KING COLE,
423,KING COLE,"""Yes,"" said his wife. ""Thank God, we still are able"
424,KING COLE,"To help a friend; come in, and sit to table."""
425,KING COLE,"""Come,"" said her man, ""I'll help you up aboard,"
426,KING COLE,"I'll save your legs as far as Wallingford."""
427,KING COLE,
428,KING COLE,They climbed aboard and sat; the woman spread
429,KING COLE,"Food for King Cole, and watched him as he fed."
430,KING COLE,Tears trickled down her cheeks and much she sighed.
431,KING COLE,"""My son,"" she said, ""like you, is wandering wide,"
432,KING COLE,"I know not where; a beggar in the street,"
433,KING COLE,(For all I know) without a crust to eat.
434,KING COLE,"He never could abide the circus life."""
435,KING COLE,
436,KING COLE,[Illustration:
437,KING COLE,_They climbed aboard and sat; the woman spread
438,KING COLE,"Food for King Cole, and watched him as he fed._"
439,KING COLE,]
440,KING COLE,
441,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
442,KING COLE,
443,KING COLE,"It was my fault, I always tell my wife"
444,KING COLE,I put too great constraint upon his will;
445,KING COLE,Things would be changed if he were with us still.
446,KING COLE,I ought not to have forced him to the trade.
447,KING COLE,
448,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
449,KING COLE,
450,KING COLE,"""A forced thing finds a vent,"" my father said;"
451,KING COLE,And yet a quickening tells me that your son
452,KING COLE,Is not far from you now; for I am one
453,KING COLE,"Who feels these things, like comfort in the heart."
454,KING COLE,
455,KING COLE,"The couple watched King Cole and shrank apart,"
456,KING COLE,For brightness covered him with glittering.
457,KING COLE,"""Tell me your present troubles,"" said the King,"
458,KING COLE,"""For you are worn. What sorrow makes you sad?"""
459,KING COLE,
460,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
461,KING COLE,
462,KING COLE,"Why, nothing, sir, except that times are bad,"
463,KING COLE,"Rain all the season through, and empty tents,"
464,KING COLE,And nothing earned for stock or winter rents.
465,KING COLE,"My wife there, ill, poor soul, from very grief,"
466,KING COLE,And now no hope nor prospect of relief;
467,KING COLE,"The season's done, and we're as we began."
468,KING COLE,
469,KING COLE,"Now one can bear one's troubles, being a man,"
470,KING COLE,But what I cannot bear is loss of friends.
471,KING COLE,This troupe will scatter when the season ends:
472,KING COLE,"My clown is going, and the Tricksey Three"
473,KING COLE,"Who juggle and do turns, have split with me;"
474,KING COLE,"And now, to-day, my wife's too ill to dance,"
475,KING COLE,And all my music ask for an advance.
476,KING COLE,There must be poison in a man's distress
477,KING COLE,That makes him mad and people like him less.
478,KING COLE,
479,KING COLE,"Well, men are men. But what I cannot bear"
480,KING COLE,"Is my poor Bet, my piebald Talking Mare,"
481,KING COLE,Gone curby in her hocks from standing up.
482,KING COLE,That's the last drop that overfills the cup.
483,KING COLE,My Bet's been like a Christian friend for years.
484,KING COLE,
485,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
486,KING COLE,
487,KING COLE,"Now courage, friend, no good can come from tears."
488,KING COLE,I know a treatment for a curby hock
489,KING COLE,Good both for inward sprain or outward knock.
490,KING COLE,Here's the receipt; it's sure as flowers in spring;
491,KING COLE,"A certain cure, the Ointment of the King."
492,KING COLE,
493,KING COLE,That cures your mare; your troubles
494,KING COLE,Time will right;
495,KING COLE,A man's ill-fortune passes like the night.
496,KING COLE,Times are already mending at their worst;
497,KING COLE,Think of Spent Simmy when his roof-beam burst.
498,KING COLE,

500,KING COLE,"_Well, men are men. But what I cannot bear"
501,KING COLE,"Is my poor Bet, my piebald Talking Mare,"
502,KING COLE,Gone curby in her hocks from standing up.
503,KING COLE,That's the last drop that overfills the cup.
504,KING COLE,My Bet's been like a Christian friend for years._
505,KING COLE,]
506,KING COLE,
507,KING COLE,His ruined roof fell on him in a rain
508,KING COLE,Of hidden gold that built it up again.
509,KING COLE,"So, courage, and believe God's providence."
510,KING COLE,"Lo, here, the city shining like new pence,"
511,KING COLE,To welcome you; the Prince is lodging there.
512,KING COLE,"Lo, you, the banners flying like a fair."
513,KING COLE,Your circus will be crowded twenty deep.
514,KING COLE,"This city is a field for you to reap,"
515,KING COLE,"For thousands must have come to see the Prince,"
516,KING COLE,"And all are here, all wanting fun. And since"
517,KING COLE,"The grass was green, all men have loved a show."
518,KING COLE,"Success is here, so let your trouble go."
519,KING COLE,
520,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
521,KING COLE,
522,KING COLE,"Well, blessings on your heart for speaking so;"
523,KING COLE,It may be that the tide will turn at last.
524,KING COLE,But royal tours have crossed me in the past
525,KING COLE,"And killed my show, and maybe will again."
526,KING COLE,"One hopes for little after months of rain,"
527,KING COLE,And the little that one hopes one does not get.
528,KING COLE,
529,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
530,KING COLE,
531,KING COLE,"Look, Will, the city gates with sentries set."
532,KING COLE,
533,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
534,KING COLE,
535,KING COLE,It looks to me as if the road were barred.
536,KING COLE,
537,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
538,KING COLE,
539,KING COLE,They are some soldiers of the bodyguard.
540,KING COLE,"I hope, the heralds of your fortune's change."
541,KING COLE,
542,KING COLE,"""Now take this frowsy circus off the range,"""
543,KING COLE,The soldiers at the city entrance cried;
544,KING COLE,"""Keep clear the town, you cannot pass inside,"
545,KING COLE,"The Prince is here, with other things to do"
546,KING COLE,"Than stare at gangs of strollers such as you."""
547,KING COLE,
548,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
549,KING COLE,
550,KING COLE,But I am billed to play here; and must play.
551,KING COLE,
552,KING COLE,_The Soldiers:_
553,KING COLE,
554,KING COLE,"No must at all. You cannot play to-day,"
555,KING COLE,Nor pitch your tents within the city bound.
556,KING COLE,
557,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
558,KING COLE,
559,KING COLE,"Where can I, then?"
560,KING COLE,
561,KING COLE,_The Soldiers:_
562,KING COLE,
563,KING COLE,"Go, find some other ground."
564,KING COLE,
565,KING COLE,_A Policeman:_
566,KING COLE,
567,KING COLE,Pass through the city. You can pitch and play
568,KING COLE,"One mile beyond it, after five to-day."
569,KING COLE,
570,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
571,KING COLE,
572,KING COLE,"One mile beyond, what use is that to me?"
573,KING COLE,
574,KING COLE,_A Policeman:_
575,KING COLE,
576,KING COLE,"Those are the rules, here printed, you can see."
577,KING COLE,
578,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
579,KING COLE,
580,KING COLE,"But let me see the Mayor, to make sure."
581,KING COLE,
582,KING COLE,_The Soldiers:_
583,KING COLE,
584,KING COLE,"These are his printed orders, all secure."
585,KING COLE,"Pass through or back, you must not linger here,"
586,KING COLE,Blocking the road with all this circus gear.
587,KING COLE,"Which will you do, then: back or pass along?"
588,KING COLE,
589,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
590,KING COLE,
591,KING COLE,Pass.
592,KING COLE,
593,KING COLE,_The Soldiers:_
594,KING COLE,
595,KING COLE,"Then away, and save your breath for song,"
596,KING COLE,We cannot bother with your right and wrong.
597,KING COLE,"George, guide these waggons through the western gate."
598,KING COLE,"Now, march, d'ye hear? and do not stop to bait"
599,KING COLE,This side a mile; for that's the order. March!
600,KING COLE,
601,KING COLE,The Showman toppled like a broken arch.
602,KING COLE,The line-squall roared upon them with loud lips.
603,KING COLE,
604,KING COLE,"A green-lit strangeness followed, like eclipse"
605,KING COLE,
606,KING COLE,"They passed within, but, when within, King Cole"
607,KING COLE,Slipped from the van to head the leading team.
608,KING COLE,"He breathed into his flute his very soul,"
609,KING COLE,"A noise like waters in a pebbly stream,"
610,KING COLE,And straight the spirits that inhabit dream
611,KING COLE,"Came round him, and the rain-squall roared its last"
612,KING COLE,And bright the wind-vane shifted as it passed.
613,KING COLE,
614,KING COLE,And in the rush of sun and glittering cloud
615,KING COLE,"That followed on the storm, he led the way,"
616,KING COLE,Fluting the sodden circus through the crowd
617,KING COLE,That trod the city streets in holiday.
618,KING COLE,"And lo, a marvellous thing, the gouted clay,"
619,KING COLE,"Splashed on the waggons and the horses, glowed,"
620,KING COLE,They shone like embers as they trod the road.
621,KING COLE,
622,KING COLE,And round the tired horses came the Powers
623,KING COLE,"That stir men's spirits, waking or asleep,"
624,KING COLE,"To thoughts like planets and to acts like flowers,"
625,KING COLE,Out of the inner wisdom's beauty deep:
626,KING COLE,"These led the horses, and, as marshalled sheep"
627,KING COLE,"Fronting a dog, in line, the people stared"
628,KING COLE,At those bright waggons led by the bright-haired.
629,KING COLE,
630,KING COLE,"And, as they marched, the spirits sang, and all"
631,KING COLE,The horses crested to the tune and stept
632,KING COLE,Like centaurs to a passionate festival
633,KING COLE,With shining throats that mantling criniers swept.
634,KING COLE,And all the hearts of all the watchers leapt
635,KING COLE,To see those horses passing and to hear
636,KING COLE,That song that came like blessing to the ear.
637,KING COLE,
638,KING COLE,"And, to the crowd, the circus artists seemed"
639,KING COLE,"Splendid, because the while that singing quired"
640,KING COLE,Each artist was the part that he had dreamed
641,KING COLE,"And glittered with the Power he desired,"
642,KING COLE,"Women and men, no longer wet or tired"
643,KING COLE,"From long despair, now shone like queens and kings,"
644,KING COLE,There they were crowned with their imaginings.
645,KING COLE,
646,KING COLE,"And with them, walking by the vans, there came"
647,KING COLE,"The wild things from the woodland and the mead,"
648,KING COLE,"The red stag, with his tender-stepping dame,"
649,KING COLE,"Branched, and high-tongued and ever taking heed."
650,KING COLE,"Nose-wrinkling rabbits nibbling at the weed,"
651,KING COLE,"The hares that box by moonlight on the hill,"
652,KING COLE,"The bright trout's death, the otter from the mill."
653,KING COLE,
654,KING COLE,"There, with his mask made virtuous, came the fox,"
655,KING COLE,Talking of landscape while he thought of meat;
656,KING COLE,"Blood-loving weasels, honey-harrying brocks,"
657,KING COLE,"Stoats, and the mice that build among the wheat,"
658,KING COLE,"Dormice, and moles with little hands for feet,"
659,KING COLE,"The water-rat that gnaws the yellow flag,"
660,KING COLE,Toads from the stone and merrows from the quag.
661,KING COLE,
662,KING COLE,"And over them flew birds of every kind,"
663,KING COLE,"Whose way, or song, or speed, or beauty brings"
664,KING COLE,Delight and understanding to the mind;
665,KING COLE,"The bright-eyed, feathery, thready-leggéd things."
666,KING COLE,"There they, too, sang amid a rush of wings,"
667,KING COLE,"With sweet, clear cries and gleams from wing and crest,"
668,KING COLE,"Blue, scarlet, white, gold plume and speckled breast."
669,KING COLE,
670,KING COLE,And all the vans seemed grown with living leaves
671,KING COLE,"And living flowers, the best September knows,"
672,KING COLE,"Moist poppies scarlet from the Hilcote sheaves,"
673,KING COLE,"Green-fingered bine that runs the barley-rows,"
674,KING COLE,"Pale candylips, and those intense blue blows"
675,KING COLE,"That trail the porches in the autumn dusk,"
676,KING COLE,Tempting the noiseless moth to tongue their musk.
677,KING COLE,
678,KING COLE,"So, tired thus, so tended, and so sung,"
679,KING COLE,They crossed the city through the marvelling crowd.
680,KING COLE,"Maids with wide eyes from upper windows hung,"
681,KING COLE,The children waved their toys and sang aloud.
682,KING COLE,But in his van the beaten showman bowed
683,KING COLE,"His head upon his hands, and wept, not knowing"
684,KING COLE,Aught of what passed except that wind was blowing.
685,KING COLE,
686,KING COLE,"All through the town the fluting led them on,"
687,KING COLE,But near the western gate King Cole retired;
688,KING COLE,"And, as he ceased, the vans no longer shone,"
689,KING COLE,The bright procession dimmed like lamps expired;
690,KING COLE,"Again with muddy vans and horses tired,"
691,KING COLE,"And artists cross and women out of luck,"
692,KING COLE,The sodden circus plodded through the muck.
693,KING COLE,
694,KING COLE,The crowd of following children loitered home;
695,KING COLE,Maids shut the windows lest more rain should come;
696,KING COLE,"The circus left the streets of flowers and flags,"
697,KING COLE,"King Cole walked with it, huddling in his rags."
698,KING COLE,They reached the western gate and sought to pass.
699,KING COLE,
700,KING COLE,"""Take back this frowsy show to where it was,"""
701,KING COLE,The sergeant of the gateway-sentry cried;
702,KING COLE,"""You know quite well you cannot pass outside."""
703,KING COLE,
704,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
705,KING COLE,
706,KING COLE,"But we were told to pass here, by the guard."
707,KING COLE,
708,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
709,KING COLE,
710,KING COLE,Here are the printed orders on the card.
711,KING COLE,"No traffic, you can read. Clear out."
712,KING COLE,
713,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
714,KING COLE,
715,KING COLE,But where?
716,KING COLE,
717,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
718,KING COLE,
719,KING COLE,"Where you're not kicked from, or there's room to spare."
720,KING COLE,Go back and out of town the way you came.
721,KING COLE,
722,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
723,KING COLE,
724,KING COLE,I've just been sent from there. Is this a game?
725,KING COLE,
726,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
727,KING COLE,
728,KING COLE,"You'll find it none, my son, if that's your tone."
729,KING COLE,
730,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
731,KING COLE,
732,KING COLE,You redcoats; ev'n your boots are not your own.
733,KING COLE,
734,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
735,KING COLE,
736,KING COLE,"No, they're the Queen's; I represent the Queen."
737,KING COLE,
738,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
739,KING COLE,
740,KING COLE,"Pipeclay your week's accounts, you red marine."
741,KING COLE,
742,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
743,KING COLE,
744,KING COLE,"Thank you, I will. Now vanish. Right-about."
745,KING COLE,
746,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
747,KING COLE,
748,KING COLE,"Right, kick the circus in or kick it out,"
749,KING COLE,"But kick us, kick us hard, we've got no friends,"
750,KING COLE,We've no Queen's boots or busbies on our ends;
751,KING COLE,"We're poor, we like it, no one cares; besides"
752,KING COLE,These dirty artists ought to have thick hides.
753,KING COLE,"The dust, like us, is fit for boots to stamp,"
754,KING COLE,None but Queen's redcoats are allowed to camp
755,KING COLE,In this free country.
756,KING COLE,
757,KING COLE,_A Policeman:_
758,KING COLE,
759,KING COLE,What's the trouble here?
760,KING COLE,
761,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
762,KING COLE,
763,KING COLE,"A redcoat dog, in need of a thick ear."
764,KING COLE,
765,KING COLE,_The Policeman:_
766,KING COLE,
767,KING COLE,"The show turned back? No, sergeant, let them through."
768,KING COLE,"They can't turn back, because the Prince is due."
769,KING COLE,Best let them pass.
770,KING COLE,
771,KING COLE,_The Sergeant:_
772,KING COLE,
773,KING COLE,Then pass; and read the rules
774,KING COLE,Another time.
775,KING COLE,
776,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
777,KING COLE,
778,KING COLE,"You fat, red-coated fools."
779,KING COLE,
780,KING COLE,_The Policeman:_
781,KING COLE,
782,KING COLE,Pass right along.
783,KING COLE,
784,KING COLE,They passed. Beyond the town
785,KING COLE,A farmer gave them leave to settle down
786,KING COLE,In a green field beside the Oxford road.
787,KING COLE,There the spent horses ceased to drag the load;
788,KING COLE,"The tent was pitched beneath a dropping sky,"
789,KING COLE,The green-striped tent with all its gear awry.
790,KING COLE,The men drew close to grumble: in the van
791,KING COLE,The showman parted from the wandering man.
792,KING COLE,
793,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
794,KING COLE,
795,KING COLE,You see; denied a chance; denied bare bread.
796,KING COLE,
797,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
798,KING COLE,
799,KING COLE,I know the stony road that artists tread.
800,KING COLE,
801,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
802,KING COLE,
803,KING COLE,"You take it very mildly, if you do."
804,KING COLE,How would you act if this were done to you?
805,KING COLE,
806,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
807,KING COLE,
808,KING COLE,Go to the Mayor.
809,KING COLE,
810,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
811,KING COLE,
812,KING COLE,"I am not that kind,"
813,KING COLE,I'll kneel to no Court prop with painted rind.
814,KING COLE,You and your snivelling to them may go hang.
815,KING COLE,"I say: ""God curse the Prince and all his gang."""
816,KING COLE,
817,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
818,KING COLE,
819,KING COLE,"Ah, no, my dear, for Life hurts everyone,"
820,KING COLE,Without our cursing. Let the poor Prince be;
821,KING COLE,"We artist folk are happier folk than he,"
822,KING COLE,Hard as it is.
823,KING COLE,
824,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
825,KING COLE,
826,KING COLE,I say: God let him see
827,KING COLE,And taste and know this misery that he makes.
828,KING COLE,"He strains a poor man's spirit till it breaks,"
829,KING COLE,"And then he hangs him, while a poor man's gift"
830,KING COLE,"He leaves unhelped, to wither or to drift."
831,KING COLE,Sergeants at city gates are all his care.
832,KING COLE,We are but outcast artists in despair.
833,KING COLE,They dress in scarlet and he gives them gold.
834,KING COLE,
835,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
836,KING COLE,
837,KING COLE,"Trust still to Life, the day is not yet old."
838,KING COLE,
839,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
840,KING COLE,
841,KING COLE,By God! our lives are all we have to trust.
842,KING COLE,
843,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
844,KING COLE,
845,KING COLE,Life changes every day and ever must.
846,KING COLE,
847,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
848,KING COLE,
849,KING COLE,"It has not changed with us, this season, yet."
850,KING COLE,
851,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
852,KING COLE,
853,KING COLE,Life is as just as Death; Life pays its debt.
854,KING COLE,
855,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
856,KING COLE,
857,KING COLE,What justice is there in our suffering so?
858,KING COLE,
859,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
860,KING COLE,
861,KING COLE,"This: that not knowing, we should try to know."
862,KING COLE,
863,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
864,KING COLE,
865,KING COLE,Try. A sweet doctrine for a broken heart.
866,KING COLE,
867,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
868,KING COLE,
869,KING COLE,The best (men say) in every manly part.
870,KING COLE,
871,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
872,KING COLE,
873,KING COLE,"Is it, by Heaven? I have tried it, I."
874,KING COLE,"I tell you, friend, your justice is a lie;"
875,KING COLE,"Your comfort is a lie, your peace a fraud;"
876,KING COLE,Your trust a folly and your cheer a gaud.
877,KING COLE,"I know what men are, having gone these roads."
878,KING COLE,"Poor bankrupt devils, sweating under loads"
879,KING COLE,While others suck their blood and smile and smile.
880,KING COLE,"You be an artist on the roads a while,"
881,KING COLE,You'll know what justice comes with suffering then.
882,KING COLE,
883,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
884,KING COLE,
885,KING COLE,"Friend, I am one grown old with sorrowing men."
886,KING COLE,
887,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
888,KING COLE,
889,KING COLE,"The old are tamed, they have not blood to feel."
890,KING COLE,
891,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
892,KING COLE,
893,KING COLE,"They've blood to hurt, if not enough to heal."
894,KING COLE,I have seen sorrow close and suffering close.
895,KING COLE,"I know their ways with men, if any knows."
896,KING COLE,I know the harshness of the way they have
897,KING COLE,To loose the base and prison up the brave.
898,KING COLE,I know that some have found the depth they trod
899,KING COLE,In deepest sorrow is the heart of God.
900,KING COLE,Up on the bitter iron there is peace.
901,KING COLE,
902,KING COLE,"In the dark night of prison comes release,"
903,KING COLE,In the black midnight still the cock will crow.
904,KING COLE,There is a help that the abandoned know
905,KING COLE,"Deep in the heart, that conquerors cannot feel."
906,KING COLE,"Abide in hope the turning of the wheel,"
907,KING COLE,The luck will alter and the star will rise.
908,KING COLE,
909,KING COLE,His presence seemed to change before their eyes.
910,KING COLE,"The old, bent, ragged, glittering, wandering fellow,"
911,KING COLE,With thready blood-streaks in the rided yellow
912,KING COLE,"Of cheek and eye, seemed changed to one who held"
913,KING COLE,Earth and the spirit like a king of eld.
914,KING COLE,
915,KING COLE,"He spoke again: ""You have been kind,"" said he."
916,KING COLE,"""In your own trouble you have thought of me."
917,KING COLE,"God will repay. To him who gives is given,"
918,KING COLE,"Corn, water, wine, the world, the starry heaven."""
919,KING COLE,
920,KING COLE,"Then, like a poor old man, he took his way"
921,KING COLE,"Back to the city, while the showman gazed"
922,KING COLE,After his figure like a man amazed.
923,KING COLE,
924,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
925,KING COLE,
926,KING COLE,I think that traveller was an angel sent.
927,KING COLE,
928,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
929,KING COLE,
930,KING COLE,A most strange man. I wonder what he meant.
931,KING COLE,
932,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
933,KING COLE,
934,KING COLE,"Comfort was what he meant, in our distress."
935,KING COLE,
936,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
937,KING COLE,
938,KING COLE,No words of his can make our trouble less.
939,KING COLE,
940,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
941,KING COLE,
942,KING COLE,"O, Will, he made me feel the luck would change."
943,KING COLE,"Look at him, husband; there is something strange"
944,KING COLE,About him there; a robin redbreast comes
945,KING COLE,"Hopping about his feet as though for crumbs,"
946,KING COLE,And little long-tailed tits and wrens that sing
947,KING COLE,Perching upon him.
948,KING COLE,
949,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
950,KING COLE,
951,KING COLE,What a wondrous thing!
952,KING COLE,"I've read of such, but never seen it."
953,KING COLE,
954,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
955,KING COLE,
956,KING COLE,"Look,"
957,KING COLE,These were the dishes and the food he took.
958,KING COLE,
959,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
960,KING COLE,
961,KING COLE,Yes; those were they. What of it?
962,KING COLE,
963,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
964,KING COLE,
965,KING COLE,Did he eat?
966,KING COLE,
967,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
968,KING COLE,
969,KING COLE,Yes; bread and cheese; he would not touch the meat
970,KING COLE,
971,KING COLE,_The Wife:_
972,KING COLE,
973,KING COLE,"But see, the cheese is whole, the loaf unbroken,"
974,KING COLE,"And both are fresh. And see, another token: Those"
975,KING COLE,hard green apples that the farmer gave
976,KING COLE,"Have grown to these gold globes, like Blenheims brave;"
977,KING COLE,"And look, how came these plums of Pershore here?"
978,KING COLE,
979,KING COLE,_The Showman:_
980,KING COLE,
981,KING COLE,"We have been sitting with a saint, my dear."
982,KING COLE,
983,KING COLE,_The Wife._
984,KING COLE,
985,KING COLE,Look at the butterflies!
986,KING COLE,
987,KING COLE,Like floating flowers
988,KING COLE,"Came butterflies, the souls of summer hours,"
989,KING COLE,"Fluttering about the van; Red Admirals rich,"
990,KING COLE,"Scarlet and pale on breathing speeds of pitch,"
991,KING COLE,"Brimstones, like yellow poppy petals blown,"
992,KING COLE,"Brown ox-eyed Peacocks in their purpled roan,"
993,KING COLE,"Blue, silvered things that haunt the grassy chalk,"
994,KING COLE,"Green Hairstreaks bright as green shoots on a stalk,"
995,KING COLE,"And that dark prince, the oakwood haunting thing"
996,KING COLE,Dyed with blue burnish like the mallard's wing.
997,KING COLE,"""He was a saint of God,"" the showman cried."
998,KING COLE,
999,KING COLE,"Meanwhile, within the town, from man to man"
1000,KING COLE,The talk about the wondrous circus ran.
1001,KING COLE,"All were agreed, that nothing ever known"
1002,KING COLE,Had thrilled so tense the marrow in their bone.
1003,KING COLE,"All were agreed, that sights so beautiful"
1004,KING COLE,"Made the Queen's court with all its soldiers dull,"
1005,KING COLE,Made all the red-wrapped masts and papered strings
1006,KING COLE,"Seem fruit of death, not lovely living things."
1007,KING COLE,"And some said loudly that though time were short,"
1008,KING COLE,Men still might hire the circus for the Court.
1009,KING COLE,"And some, agreeing, sought the Mayor's hall,"
1010,KING COLE,To press petition for the show's recall.
1011,KING COLE,
1012,KING COLE,"But as they neared the hall, behold, there came"
1013,KING COLE,A stranger to them dressed as though in flame;
1014,KING COLE,"An old, thin, grinning glitterer, decked with green,"
1015,KING COLE,"With thready blood-streaks in his visage lean,"
1016,KING COLE,And at his wrinkled eyes a look of mirth
1017,KING COLE,Not common among men who walk the earth;
1018,KING COLE,"Yet from his pocket poked a flute of wood,"
1019,KING COLE,And little birds were following him for food.
1020,KING COLE,
1021,KING COLE,"""Sirs,"" said King Cole (for it was he), ""I know"
1022,KING COLE,"You seek the Mayor, but you need not so;"
1023,KING COLE,I have this moment spoken with his grace.
1024,KING COLE,He grants the circus warrant to take place
1025,KING COLE,"Within the city, should the Prince see fit"
1026,KING COLE,To watch such pastime; here is his permit.
1027,KING COLE,I go this instant to the Prince to learn
1028,KING COLE,"His wish herein: wait here till I return."""
1029,KING COLE,
1030,KING COLE,They waited while the old man passed the sentry
1031,KING COLE,"Beside the door, and vanished through the entry."
1032,KING COLE,"They thought, ""This old man shining like New Spain,"
1033,KING COLE,Must be the Prince's lordly chamberlain.
1034,KING COLE,"His cloth of gold so shone, it seemed to burn;"
1035,KING COLE,"Wait till he comes."" They stayed for his return."
1036,KING COLE,
1037,KING COLE,"Meanwhile, above, the Prince stood still to bide"
1038,KING COLE,"The nightly mercy of the eventide,"
1039,KING COLE,Brought nearer by each hour that chimed and ceased.
1040,KING COLE,His head was weary with the city feast
1041,KING COLE,But newly risen from. He stood alone
1042,KING COLE,As heavy as the day's foundation stone.
1043,KING COLE,
1044,KING COLE,The room he stood in was an ancient hall.
1045,KING COLE,Portraits of long dead men were on the wall.
1046,KING COLE,From the dull crimson of their robes there stared
1047,KING COLE,"Passionless eyes, long dead, that judged and glared."
1048,KING COLE,"Above them were the oaken corbels set,"
1049,KING COLE,"Of angels reaching hands that never met,"
1050,KING COLE,Where in the spring the swallows came to build.
1051,KING COLE,
1052,KING COLE,It was the meeting chamber of the Guild.
1053,KING COLE,
1054,KING COLE,"From where he stood, the Prince could see a yard"
1055,KING COLE,Paved with old slabs and cobbles cracked and scarred
1056,KING COLE,"Where weeds had pushed, and tiles and broken glass"
1057,KING COLE,Had fallen and been trodden in the grass.
1058,KING COLE,A gutter dripped upon it from the rain.
1059,KING COLE,
1060,KING COLE,"""It puts a crown of lead upon my brain"
1061,KING COLE,"To live this life of princes,"" thought the Prince."
1062,KING COLE,"""To be a king is to be like a quince,"
1063,KING COLE,"Bitter himself, yet flavour to the rest."
1064,KING COLE,To be a cat among the hay were best;
1065,KING COLE,"There in the upper darkness of the loft,"
1066,KING COLE,"With green eyes bright, soft-lying, purring soft,"
1067,KING COLE,"Hearing the rain without; not forced, as I,"
1068,KING COLE,"To lay foundation stones until I die,"
1069,KING COLE,Or sign State-papers till my hand is sick.
1070,KING COLE,The man who plaits straw crowns upon a rick
1071,KING COLE,Is happier in his crown than I the King.
1072,KING COLE,"And yet, this day, a very marvellous thing"
1073,KING COLE,Came by me as I walked the chamber here.
1074,KING COLE,"Once in my childhood, in my seventh year,"
1075,KING COLE,"I saw them come, and now they have returned,"
1076,KING COLE,"Those strangers, riding upon cars that burned,"
1077,KING COLE,"Or seemed to burn, with gold, while music thrilled,"
1078,KING COLE,"Then beauty following till my heart was filled,"
1079,KING COLE,And life seemed peopled from eternity.
1080,KING COLE,
1081,KING COLE,They brought down Beauty and Wisdom from the sky
1082,KING COLE,"Into the streets, those strangers; I could see"
1083,KING COLE,Beauty and wisdom looking up at me
1084,KING COLE,"As then, in childhood, as they passed below."
1085,KING COLE,
1086,KING COLE,"Men would not let me know them long ago,"
1087,KING COLE,Those strangers bringing joy. They will not now.
1088,KING COLE,I am a prince with gold about my brow;
1089,KING COLE,"Duty, not joy, is all a prince's share."
1090,KING COLE,
1091,KING COLE,"And yet, those strangers from I know not where,"
1092,KING COLE,"From glittering lands, from unknown cities far"
1093,KING COLE,"Beyond the sea-plunge of the evening star,"
1094,KING COLE,"Would give me life, which princedom cannot give."
1095,KING COLE,They would be revelation: I should live.
1096,KING COLE,"I may not deal with wisdom, being a king."""
1097,KING COLE,
1098,KING COLE,There came a noise of someone entering;
1099,KING COLE,He turned his weary head to see who came.
1100,KING COLE,
1101,KING COLE,"It was King Cole, arrayed as though in flame,"
1102,KING COLE,"Like a white opal, glowing from within,"
1103,KING COLE,He entered there in snowy cramoisin.
1104,KING COLE,"The Prince mistook him for a city lord,"
1105,KING COLE,He turned to him and waited for his word.
1106,KING COLE,
1107,KING COLE,"""Sir,"" said King Cole, ""I come to bring you news."
1108,KING COLE,"Sir, in the weary life that princes use"
1109,KING COLE,There is scant time for any prince or king
1110,KING COLE,To taste delights that artists have and bring.
1111,KING COLE,"But here, to-night, no other duty calls,"
1112,KING COLE,And circus artists are without the walls.
1113,KING COLE,"Will you not see them, sir?"""
1114,KING COLE,
1115,KING COLE,_The Prince:_
1116,KING COLE,
1117,KING COLE,Who are these artists; do they paint or write?
1118,KING COLE,
1119,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
1120,KING COLE,
1121,KING COLE,"No, but they serve the arts and love delight."
1122,KING COLE,
1123,KING COLE,_The Prince:_
1124,KING COLE,
1125,KING COLE,What can they do?
1126,KING COLE,
1127,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
1128,KING COLE,
1129,KING COLE,They know full many a rite
1130,KING COLE,"That holds the watcher spell-bound, and they know"
1131,KING COLE,Gay plays of ghosts and jokes of long ago;
1132,KING COLE,"And beauty of bright speed their horses bring,"
1133,KING COLE,Ridden barebacked at gallop round the ring
1134,KING COLE,By girls who stand upon the racing team.
1135,KING COLE,"Jugglers they have, of whom the children dream,"
1136,KING COLE,Who pluck live rabbits from between their lips
1137,KING COLE,And balance marbles on their fingertips.
1138,KING COLE,"Will you not see them, sir? And then, they dance."
1139,KING COLE,
1140,KING COLE,"""Ay,"" said the Prince, ""and thankful for the chance."
1141,KING COLE,"So thankful, that these bags of gold shall buy"
1142,KING COLE,Leave for all comers to be glad as I.
1143,KING COLE,
1144,KING COLE,"And yet, I know not if the Court permits."
1145,KING COLE,King's pleasures must be sifted through the wits
1146,KING COLE,Or want of wit of many a courtly brain.
1147,KING COLE,"I get the lees and chokings of the drain,"
1148,KING COLE,"Not the bright rippling that I perish for."""
1149,KING COLE,
1150,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
1151,KING COLE,
1152,KING COLE,"Sir, I will open the forbidden door,"
1153,KING COLE,"Which, opened, they will enter all in haste."
1154,KING COLE,The life of man is stronger than good taste.
1155,KING COLE,
1156,KING COLE,_The Prince:_
1157,KING COLE,
1158,KING COLE,Custom is stronger than the life of man.
1159,KING COLE,
1160,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
1161,KING COLE,
1162,KING COLE,Custom is but a way that life began.
1163,KING COLE,
1164,KING COLE,_The Prince:_
1165,KING COLE,
1166,KING COLE,"A withering way that makes the leafage fall,"
1167,KING COLE,"Custom, like Winter, is the King of all."
1168,KING COLE,
1169,KING COLE,_King Cole:_
1170,KING COLE,
1171,KING COLE,"Winter makes water solid, yet the spring,"
1172,KING COLE,"That is but flowers, is a stronger thing."
1173,KING COLE,"Custom, the ass man rides, will plod for years,"
1174,KING COLE,But laughter kills him and he dies at tears.
1175,KING COLE,"One word of love, one spark from beauty's fire,"
1176,KING COLE,"And custom is a memory; listen, sire."
1177,KING COLE,
1178,KING COLE,Then at a window looking on the street
1179,KING COLE,"He played his flute like leaves or snowflakes falling,"
1180,KING COLE,"Till men and women, passing, thought: ""How sweet;"
1181,KING COLE,"These notes are in our hearts like flowers falling."""
1182,KING COLE,"And then, they thought, ""An unknown voice is calling"
1183,KING COLE,Like April calling to the seed in earth;
1184,KING COLE,"Madness is quickening deadness into birth."""
1185,KING COLE,
1186,KING COLE,"And then, as in the spring when first men hear,"
1187,KING COLE,"Beyond the black-twigged hedge, the lambling's cry"
1188,KING COLE,"Coming across the snow, a note of cheer"
1189,KING COLE,"Before the storm-cock tells that spring is nigh,"
1190,KING COLE,"Before the first green bramble pushes shy,"
1191,KING COLE,"And all the blood leaps at the lambling's notes,"
1192,KING COLE,The piping brought men's hearts into their throats.
1193,KING COLE,
1194,KING COLE,"Till all were stirred, however old and grand;"
1195,KING COLE,"Generals bestarred, old statesmen, courtiers prim"
1196,KING COLE,"(Whose lips kissed nothing but the Monarch's hand),"
1197,KING COLE,"Stirred in their courtly minds recesses dim,"
1198,KING COLE,The sap of life stirred in the dreary limb.
1199,KING COLE,"The old eyes brightened o'er the pouncet-box,"
1200,KING COLE,"Remembering loves, and brawls, and mains of cocks."
1201,KING COLE,
1202,KING COLE,And through the town the liquid piping's gladness
1203,KING COLE,"Thrilled on its way, rejoicing all who heard,"
1204,KING COLE,To thrust aside their dullness or their sadness
1205,KING COLE,And follow blithely as the fluting stirred
1206,KING COLE,They hurried to the guild like horses spurred.
1207,KING COLE,"There in the road they mustered to await,"
1208,KING COLE,"They knew not what, a dream, a joy, a fate."
1209,KING COLE,
1210,KING COLE,And man to man in exaltation cried:
1211,KING COLE,"""Something has come to make us young again."
1212,KING COLE,"Wisdom has come, and Beauty, Wisdom's bride,"
1213,KING COLE,"And youth like flowering April after rain."""
1214,KING COLE,But still the fluting piped and men were fain
1215,KING COLE,"To sing and ring the bells, they knew not why"
1216,KING COLE,Save that their hearts were in an ecstasy.
1217,KING COLE,
1218,KING COLE,Then to the balcony above them came
1219,KING COLE,King Cole the shining in his robe of flame;
1220,KING COLE,"Behind him came the Prince, who smiled and bowed."
1221,KING COLE,King Cole made silence: then addressed the crowd.
1222,KING COLE,
1223,KING COLE,"""Friends, fellow mortals, bearers of the ghost"
1224,KING COLE,"That burns, and breaks its lamp, but is not lost."
1225,KING COLE,"This day, for one brief hour, a key is given"
1226,KING COLE,"To all, however poor, to enter heaven."
1227,KING COLE,"The Bringers Down of Beauty from the stars,"
1228,KING COLE,Have reached this city in their golden cars.
1229,KING COLE,"They ask, to bring you beauty, if you will."
1230,KING COLE,"You do not answer: rightly, you are still."
1231,KING COLE,"But you will come, to watch the image move"
1232,KING COLE,Of all you dreamed or had the strength to love.
1233,KING COLE,
1234,KING COLE,"Come to the Ring, the image of the path"
1235,KING COLE,That this our planet through the Heaven hath;
1236,KING COLE,"Behold man's skill, man's wisdom, man's delight,"
1237,KING COLE,"And woman's beauty, imaged to the height."
1238,KING COLE,
1239,KING COLE,"Come, for our rulers come; and Death, whose feet"
1240,KING COLE,"Tread at the door, permits a minute's sweet;"
1241,KING COLE,"To each man's soul vouchsafes a glimpse, a gleam,"
1242,KING COLE,"A touch, a breath of his intensest dream."
1243,KING COLE,"Now, to that glimpse, that moment, come with me;"
1244,KING COLE,Our rulers come.
1245,KING COLE,
1246,KING COLE,O brother let there be
1247,KING COLE,Such welcome to our Prince as never was.
1248,KING COLE,"Let there be flowers under foot, not grass,"
1249,KING COLE,Flowers and scented rushes and the sprays
1250,KING COLE,Of purple bramble reddening into blaze.
1251,KING COLE,Let there be bells rung backward till the tune
1252,KING COLE,Be as the joy of all the bees in June.
1253,KING COLE,"Let float your flags, and let your lanterns rise"
1254,KING COLE,"Like fruit upon the trees in Paradise,"
1255,KING COLE,In many-coloured lights as rich as Rome
1256,KING COLE,"O'er road and tent; and let the children come,"
1257,KING COLE,"It is their world, these Beauty Dwellers bring."""
1258,KING COLE,
1259,KING COLE,"Then, like the song of all the birds of spring"
1260,KING COLE,"He played his flute, and all who heard it cried,"
1261,KING COLE,"""Strew flowers before our rulers to the Ring."""
1262,KING COLE,The courtiers hurried for their coats of pride
1263,KING COLE,The upturned faces in that market wide
1264,KING COLE,Glowed in the sunset to a beauty grave
1265,KING COLE,Such as the faces of immortals have.
1266,KING COLE,
1267,KING COLE,"And work was laid aside on desk and bench,"
1268,KING COLE,"The red-lined ledger summed no penny more,"
1269,KING COLE,From lamp-blacked fingers the mechanic's wrench
1270,KING COLE,"Dropped to the kinking wheel chains on the floor,"
1271,KING COLE,The farmer shut the hen roost: at the store
1272,KING COLE,The boys put up the shutters and ran hooting
1273,KING COLE,Wild with delight in freedom to the fluting.
1274,KING COLE,
1275,KING COLE,And now the fluting led that gathered tide
1276,KING COLE,"Of men and women forward through the town,"
1277,KING COLE,"And flowers seemed to fall from every side,"
1278,KING COLE,"White starry blossoms such as brooks bow down,"
1279,KING COLE,White petals clinging in the hair and gown;
1280,KING COLE,And those who marched there thought that starry flowers
1281,KING COLE,"Grew at their sides, as though the streets were bowers."
1282,KING COLE,
1283,KING COLE,"And all, in marching, thought, ""We go to see"
1284,KING COLE,"Life, not the daily coil, but as it is"
1285,KING COLE,"Lived in its beauty in eternity,"
1286,KING COLE,"Above base aim, beyond our miseries;"
1287,KING COLE,"Life that is speed and colour and bright bliss,"
1288,KING COLE,"And beauty seen and strained for, and possest"
1289,KING COLE,"Even as a star forever in the breast."""
1290,KING COLE,
1291,KING COLE,"The fluting led them through the western gate,"
1292,KING COLE,"From many a tossing torch their faces glowed,"
1293,KING COLE,Bright-eyed and ruddy-featured and elate;
1294,KING COLE,"They sang and scattered flowers upon the road,"
1295,KING COLE,Still in their hair the starry blossoms snowed;
1296,KING COLE,"They saw ahead the green-striped tent, their mark,"
1297,KING COLE,Lit now and busy in the gathering dark.
1298,KING COLE,
1299,KING COLE,There at the vans and in the green-striped tent
1300,KING COLE,The circus artists growled their discontent.
1301,KING COLE,Close to the gate a lighted van there was;
1302,KING COLE,The showman's wife thrust back its window glass.
1303,KING COLE,And leaned her head without to see who came
1304,KING COLE,To buy a ticket for the evening's game.
1305,KING COLE,
1306,KING COLE,A roll of tickets and a plate of pence
1307,KING COLE,(For change) lay by her as she leaned from thence.
1308,KING COLE,"She heard the crowd afar, but in her thought"
1309,KING COLE,"She said: ""That's in the city; it is nought."
1310,KING COLE,"They glorify the Queen."""
1311,KING COLE,
1312,KING COLE,Though sick at heart
1313,KING COLE,"She wore her spangles for her evening's part,"
1314,KING COLE,To dance upon the barebacked horse and sing.
1315,KING COLE,"Green velvet was her dress, with tinselling."
1316,KING COLE,"Her sad, worn face had all the nobleness"
1317,KING COLE,That lovely spirits gather from distress.
1318,KING COLE,
1319,KING COLE,"""No one to-night,"" she thought, ""no one to-night."""
1320,KING COLE,
1321,KING COLE,"Within the tent, a flare gave blowing light."
1322,KING COLE,"There, in their scarlet cart, the bandsmen tuned"
1323,KING COLE,"Bugles that whinnied, flageolets that crooned"
1324,KING COLE,And strings that whined and grunted.
1325,KING COLE,
1326,KING COLE,Near the band
1327,KING COLE,Piebald and magpie horses stood at hand
1328,KING COLE,Nosing at grass beneath the green-striped dome
1329,KING COLE,While men caressed them with the curry-comb.
1330,KING COLE,
1331,KING COLE,"The clowns, with whited, raddled faces, heaped"
1332,KING COLE,Old horse cloths round them to the chins; they peeped
1333,KING COLE,Above the rugs; their cigarette ends' light
1334,KING COLE,"Showing black eyes, and scarlet smears and white."
1335,KING COLE,
1336,KING COLE,"They watched the empty benches, and the wry"
1337,KING COLE,Green curtain door which no one entered by.
1338,KING COLE,
1339,KING COLE,Two little children entered and sat still
1340,KING COLE,"With bright wide-opened eyes that stared their fill,"
1341,KING COLE,And red lips round in wonder smeared with tints
1342,KING COLE,From hands and handkerchiefs and peppermints.
1343,KING COLE,
1344,KING COLE,A farm lad entered. That was all the house.
1345,KING COLE,
1346,KING COLE,"""Strike up the band to give the folk a rouse,"""
1347,KING COLE,"The showman said, ""They must be all outside."""
1348,KING COLE,"He said it boldly, though he knew he lied."
1349,KING COLE,
1350,KING COLE,Sad as a funeral march for pleasure gone
1351,KING COLE,"The band lamented out, ""He's got them on."""
1352,KING COLE,"Then paused, as usual, for the crowd to come."
1353,KING COLE,
1354,KING COLE,"Nobody came, though from without a hum"
1355,KING COLE,Of instruments and singing slowly rose.
1356,KING COLE,"""Free feast, with fireworks and public shows,"""
1357,KING COLE,"The bandsmen growled, ""An empty house again."
1358,KING COLE,Two children and a ploughboy and the rain.
1359,KING COLE,"And then a night march through the mud,"" they said."
1360,KING COLE,
1361,KING COLE,"Now to the gate, King Cole his piping played."
1362,KING COLE,The showman's wife from out her window peering
1363,KING COLE,"Saw, in the road, a crowd with lanterns nearing,"
1364,KING COLE,"And, just below her perch, a man who shone"
1365,KING COLE,As though white flame were his caparison;
1366,KING COLE,One upon whom the great-eyed hawk-moths tense
1367,KING COLE,"Settled with feathery feet and quivering sense,"
1368,KING COLE,"Till the white, gleaming robe seemed stuck with eyes."
1369,KING COLE,
1370,KING COLE,"It was the grinning glitterer, white and wise,"
1371,KING COLE,"King Cole, who said, ""Madam, the Court is here,"
1372,KING COLE,"The Court, the Prince, the Queen, all drawing near,"
1373,KING COLE,"We here, the vanguard, set them on their way."
1374,KING COLE,They come intent to see your circus play.
1375,KING COLE,"They ask that all who wish may enter free,"
1376,KING COLE,And in their princely hope that this may be
1377,KING COLE,"They send you these plump bags of minted gold."""
1378,KING COLE,He gave a sack that she could scarcely hold.
1379,KING COLE,"She dropped it trembling, muttering thanks, and then"
1380,KING COLE,"She cried: ""O master, I must tell the men."""
1381,KING COLE,
1382,KING COLE,She rushed out of her van: she reached the Ring;
1383,KING COLE,"Called to her husband, ""Will, the Queen and King,"
1384,KING COLE,"Here at the very gate to see the show!"""
1385,KING COLE,
1386,KING COLE,"""Light some more flares,"" said Will, ""to make a glow."
1387,KING COLE,"'God save the Queen,' there, bandsmen; lively, boys."
1388,KING COLE,"Come on, 'God save our gracious'; make a noise."
1389,KING COLE,"Here, John, bring on the piebalds to the centre,"
1390,KING COLE,"We'll have the horses kneeling as they enter."""
1391,KING COLE,"All sang, and rushed. Without, the trumpets blared."
1392,KING COLE,
1393,KING COLE,"Now children, carrying paper lanterns, made"
1394,KING COLE,A glowing alley to the circus door;
1395,KING COLE,"Then others scattered flowers to pave a floor,"
1396,KING COLE,Along the highway leading from the town.
1397,KING COLE,
1398,KING COLE,[Illustration]
1399,KING COLE,
1400,KING COLE,"Rust-spotted bracken green they scattered down,"
1401,KING COLE,"Blue cornflowers and withering poppies red,"
1402,KING COLE,"Gold charlock, thrift, the purple hardihead,"
1403,KING COLE,"Harebells, the milfoil white, September clover,"
1404,KING COLE,"And boughs that berry red when summer's over,"
1405,KING COLE,"All autumn flowers, with yellow ears of wheat."
1406,KING COLE,
1407,KING COLE,"Then with bruised, burning gums that made all sweet,"
1408,KING COLE,"Came censer-bearing pages, and then came"
1409,KING COLE,"Bearers in white with cressets full of flame,"
1410,KING COLE,Whose red tongues made the shadows dance like devils.
1411,KING COLE,Then the blithe flutes that pipe men to the revels
1412,KING COLE,Thrilled to the marrow softly as men marched.
1413,KING COLE,"Then, tossing leopard-skins from crests that arched,"
1414,KING COLE,The horses of the kettle-drummers stept.
1415,KING COLE,Then with a glitter of bright steel there swept
1416,KING COLE,"The guard of knights, each pennon-bearer bold"
1417,KING COLE,Girt in a crimson cloak with spangs of gold.
1418,KING COLE,"Then came the Sword and Mace, and then the four"
1419,KING COLE,Long silver trumpets thrilling to the core
1420,KING COLE,"Of people's hearts their sound. Then two by two,"
1421,KING COLE,"Proud in caparisons of kingly blue,"
1422,KING COLE,"Bitted with bars of gold, in silver shod,"
1423,KING COLE,"Treading like kings, cream-coloured stallions trod,"
1424,KING COLE,Dragging the carriage with the Prince and Queen.
1425,KING COLE,"The Corporation, walking, closed the scene."
1426,KING COLE,Then came the crowd in-surging like the wave
1427,KING COLE,That closes up the gash the clipper clave.
1428,KING COLE,
1429,KING COLE,Swift in the path their majesties would tread
1430,KING COLE,The showman flung green baize and turkey red.
1431,KING COLE,"Within the tent, with bunting, ropes and bags"
1432,KING COLE,They made a Royal Box festooned with flags.
1433,KING COLE,"Even as the Queen arrived, the work was done,"
1434,KING COLE,"The seven piebald horses kneeled like one,"
1435,KING COLE,"The bandsmen blew their best, while, red as beet,"
1436,KING COLE,The showman bowed his rulers to their seat.
1437,KING COLE,
1438,KING COLE,"Then, through the door, came courtiers wigged and starred;"
1439,KING COLE,The crimson glitterers of the bodyguard;
1440,KING COLE,"The ladies of the Court, broad-browed and noble,"
1441,KING COLE,
1442,KING COLE,[Illustration:
1443,KING COLE,"_The Court, the Prince, the Queen, all drawing near,"
1444,KING COLE,"We here, the vanguard, set them on their way."
1445,KING COLE,They come intent to see your circus play._
1446,KING COLE,]
1447,KING COLE,
1448,KING COLE,Lovely as evening stars o'er seas in trouble;
1449,KING COLE,"The aldermen, in furs, with golden chains,"
1450,KING COLE,"Old cottagers in smocks from country lanes,"
1451,KING COLE,"Shepherds half dumb from silence on the down,"
1452,KING COLE,"And merchants with their households from the town,"
1453,KING COLE,"And, in the front, two rows of eager-hearted"
1454,KING COLE,Children with shining eyes and red lips parted.
1455,KING COLE,
1456,KING COLE,Even as the creeping waves that brim the pool
1457,KING COLE,One following other filled the circus full.
1458,KING COLE,
1459,KING COLE,The showman stood beside his trembling wife.
1460,KING COLE,"""Never,"" he said, ""in all our travelling life"
1461,KING COLE,"Has this old tent looked thus, the front seats full"
1462,KING COLE,With happy little children beautiful.
1463,KING COLE,"Then all this glorious Court, tier after tier!"
1464,KING COLE,"O would our son, the wanderer, were here,"
1465,KING COLE,"Then we'd die happy!"""
1466,KING COLE,
1467,KING COLE,"""Would he were!"" said she."
1468,KING COLE,"""It was my preaching forced him to be free,"""
1469,KING COLE,The showman said.
1470,KING COLE,
1471,KING COLE,"""Ah, no,"" his wife replied,"
1472,KING COLE,"""The great world's glory and the young blood's pride,"
1473,KING COLE,"Those forced him from us, never you, my dear."""
1474,KING COLE,
1475,KING COLE,"""I would be different if we had him here"
1476,KING COLE,"Again,"" the showman said; ""but we must start."
1477,KING COLE,"But all this splendour takes away my heart,"
1478,KING COLE,"I am not used to playing to the King."""
1479,KING COLE,
1480,KING COLE,"""Look,"" said his wife, ""the stranger, in the Ring."""
1481,KING COLE,
1482,KING COLE,"There in the Ring, indeed, the stranger stood,"
1483,KING COLE,"King Cole, the shining, with his flute of wood,"
1484,KING COLE,Waiting until the chattering Court was stilled.
1485,KING COLE,
1486,KING COLE,"Then from his wooden flute his piping thrilled,"
1487,KING COLE,"Then all was tense, and then the leaping fluting"
1488,KING COLE,Clamoured as flowering clamours for the fruiting.
1489,KING COLE,
1490,KING COLE,"And round the ring came Dodo, the brown mare,"
1491,KING COLE,Pied like a tiger-moth; her bright shoes tare
1492,KING COLE,"The scattered petals, while the clown came after"
1493,KING COLE,"Like life, a beauty chased by tragic laughter."
1494,KING COLE,The showman entered in and cracked his whip.
1495,KING COLE,
1496,KING COLE,"Then followed fun and skill and horsemanship,"
1497,KING COLE,"Marvellous all, for all were at their best."
1498,KING COLE,Never had playing gone with such a zest
1499,KING COLE,To those good jesters; never had the tent
1500,KING COLE,So swiftly answered to their merriment
1501,KING COLE,"With cheers, the artist's help, the actor's life."
1502,KING COLE,"Then, at the end, the showman and his wife"
1503,KING COLE,Stood at the entrance listening to the cheers.
1504,KING COLE,They were both happy to the brink of tears.
1505,KING COLE,
1506,KING COLE,King Cole came close and whispered in their ears:
1507,KING COLE,"""There is a soldier here who says he knew"
1508,KING COLE,"You, long ago, and asks to speak to you."
1509,KING COLE,"A sergeant in the guard, a handsome blade."""
1510,KING COLE,
1511,KING COLE,"""Mother!"" the sergeant said. ""What, Jack!"" she said,"
1512,KING COLE,"""Our son come back! look, father, here's our son!"""
1513,KING COLE,
1514,KING COLE,"""Bad pennies do come home to everyone,"""
1515,KING COLE,"The sergeant said. ""And if you'll have me home,"
1516,KING COLE,"And both forgive me, I'll be glad to come."""
1517,KING COLE,
1518,KING COLE,"""Why, son,"" the showman said, ""the fault was ours."""
1519,KING COLE,
1520,KING COLE,Now a bright herald trod across the flowers
1521,KING COLE,"To bid the artists to the Queen and King,"
1522,KING COLE,"Who thanked them for the joyful evening,"
1523,KING COLE,And shook each artist's hand with words of praise.
1524,KING COLE,"""Our happiest hour,"" they said, ""for many days."
1525,KING COLE,"You must perform at Court at Christmas tide."""
1526,KING COLE,
1527,KING COLE,"They left their box: men flung the curtains wide,"
1528,KING COLE,The horses kneeled like one as they withdrew.
1529,KING COLE,
1530,KING COLE,[Illustration:
1531,KING COLE,"_And round the ring came Dodo, the brown mare,"
1532,KING COLE,Pied like a tiger-moth; her bright shoes tare
1533,KING COLE,"The scattered petals, while the clown came after"
1534,KING COLE,"Like life, a beauty chased by tragic laughter._"
1535,KING COLE,]
1536,KING COLE,
1537,KING COLE,They reached the curtained door and loitered through.
1538,KING COLE,"The audience, standing, sang ""God save the Queen."""
1539,KING COLE,The hour of the showman's life had been.
1540,KING COLE,
1541,KING COLE,Now once again a herald crossed the green
1542,KING COLE,"To tell the showman that a feast was laid,"
1543,KING COLE,A supper for the artists who had played
1544,KING COLE,"By the Queen's order, in a tent without."
1545,KING COLE,
1546,KING COLE,In the bright moonlight at the gate the rout
1547,KING COLE,"Of courtiers, formed procession to be gone,"
1548,KING COLE,"Orders were called, steel clinked, and jewels shone,"
1549,KING COLE,The watchers climbed the banks and took their stands.
1550,KING COLE,
1551,KING COLE,"The circus artists shook each others' hands,"
1552,KING COLE,"Their quarrels were forgotten and forgiven,"
1553,KING COLE,Old friendships were restored and sinners shriven.
1554,KING COLE,"""We find we cannot part from Will,"" they said."
1555,KING COLE,
1556,KING COLE,And while they talked the juggler took the maid
1557,KING COLE,"Molly, the singer, to the hawthorn glade"
1558,KING COLE,"Behind the green-striped tent, and told his love,"
1559,KING COLE,"A wild delight, beyond her hope, enough"
1560,KING COLE,Beyond her dream to brim her eyes with tears.
1561,KING COLE,
1562,KING COLE,Now came a ringing cry to march; and cheers
1563,KING COLE,Rose from the crowd; the bright procession fared
1564,KING COLE,Back to the city while the trumpets blared.
1565,KING COLE,
1566,KING COLE,"So the night ended, and the Court retired."
1567,KING COLE,"Back to the town the swaying torches reeked,"
1568,KING COLE,"Within the green-striped tent the lights expired,"
1569,KING COLE,The dew dript from the canvas where it leaked.
1570,KING COLE,"Dark, in the showman's van, a cricket creaked,"
1571,KING COLE,"But, near the waggons, fire was glowing red"
1572,KING COLE,On happy faces where the feast was spread.
1573,KING COLE,
1574,KING COLE,"Gladly they supped, those artists of the show;"
1575,KING COLE,"Then by the perfect moon, together timed,"
1576,KING COLE,"They struck the green-striped tent and laid it low,"
1577,KING COLE,Even as the quarter before midnight chimed.
1578,KING COLE,"Then putting-to the piebald nags, they climbed"
1579,KING COLE,Into their vans and slowly stole away
1580,KING COLE,Along Blown Hilcote on the Icknield Way.
1581,KING COLE,
1582,KING COLE,And as the rumbling of the waggons died
1583,KING COLE,"By Aston Tirrold and the Moretons twain,"
1584,KING COLE,"With axle-clatter in the countryside,"
1585,KING COLE,"Lit by the moon and fragrant from the rain,"
1586,KING COLE,"King Cole moved softly in the Ring again,"
1587,KING COLE,Where now the owls and he were left alone:
1588,KING COLE,The night was loud with water upon stone.
1589,KING COLE,
1590,KING COLE,"He watched the night; then taking up his flute,"
1591,KING COLE,"He breathed a piping of this life of ours,"
1592,KING COLE,"The half-seen prize, the difficult pursuit,"
1593,KING COLE,"The passionate lusts that shut us in their towers,"
1594,KING COLE,"The love that helps us on, the fear that lowers,"
1595,KING COLE,"The pride that makes us and the pride that mars,"
1596,KING COLE,The beauty and the truth that are our stars.
1597,KING COLE,
1598,KING COLE,"And man, the marvellous thing, that in the dark"
1599,KING COLE,"Works with his little strength to make a light,"
1600,KING COLE,"His wit that strikes, his hope that tends, a spark,"
1601,KING COLE,"His sorrow of soul in toil, that brings delight,"
1602,KING COLE,"His friends, who make salt sweet and blackness bright,"
1603,KING COLE,"His birth and growth and change; and death the wise,"
1604,KING COLE,"His peace, that puts a hand upon his eyes."
1605,KING COLE,
1606,KING COLE,"All these his pipings breathed of, until twelve"
1607,KING COLE,Struck on the belfry tower with tremblings numb
1608,KING COLE,(Such as will shudder in the axe's helve
1609,KING COLE,When the head strikes) to tell his hour was come.
1610,KING COLE,Out of the living world of Christendom
1611,KING COLE,He dimmed like mist till one could scarcely note
1612,KING COLE,The robins nestling to his old grey coat.
1613,KING COLE,
1614,KING COLE,"Dimmer he grew, yet still a glimmering stayed"
1615,KING COLE,"Like light on cobwebs, but it dimmed and died."
1616,KING COLE,"Then there was naught but moonlight in the glade,"
1617,KING COLE,Moonlight and water and an owl that cried.
1618,KING COLE,"Far overhead a rush of birds' wings sighed,"
1619,KING COLE,From migrants going south until the spring.
1620,KING COLE,The night seemed fanned by an immortal wing.
1621,KING COLE,
1622,KING COLE,But where the juggler trudged beside his love
1623,KING COLE,"Each felt a touching from beyond our ken,"
1624,KING COLE,"From that bright kingdom where the souls who strove,"
1625,KING COLE,"Live now forever, helping living men."
1626,KING COLE,And as they kissed each other; even then
1627,KING COLE,"Their brows seemed blessed, as though a hand unseen"
1628,KING COLE,Had crowned their loves with never-withering green.
