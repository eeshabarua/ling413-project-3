110,FOREWORD,
111,FOREWORD,Songs from a far-away world; a cry from another sphere. To those of
112,FOREWORD,"us who once experienced the still and pitiless cold, a cry terribly"
113,FOREWORD,"suggestive of the horror-charged gloom, of the icy silence as"
114,FOREWORD,"unbroken as that of unfathomable deeps, of the stern and"
115,FOREWORD,uncompromising individuality of a disturbed and vengeful North.
116,FOREWORD,
117,FOREWORD,"Yet one is also reminded that, even in the Klondyke, in due season"
118,FOREWORD,the brooding spruces are awakened from slumber by the songs of
119,FOREWORD,"happy-throated songsters, that the melancholy of the forest is"
120,FOREWORD,brightened by gay flowers. The weight is then lifted from men's
121,FOREWORD,"hearts; singing is heard in the cabin, and the sound of laughter on"
122,FOREWORD,"the trail. When the mighty Yukon is open to the Behring Sea, the far"
123,FOREWORD,North is in touch with the world and men are glad.
124,FOREWORD,
125,FOREWORD,But the Arctic summer is short-lived. The days of the bird and the
126,FOREWORD,"flower and the rippling creeks are numbered. Soon the sky turns grey,"
127,FOREWORD,"the wind chants the sun's requiem, the snow falls; and then returns"
128,FOREWORD,"the cold, the gloom, the feeling of isolation, the indescribable"
129,FOREWORD,terror.
130,FOREWORD,
131,FOREWORD,"I heard these songs sung in the Arctic, the singer at my side--these"
132,FOREWORD,"songs of nature, songs of hope, home, heart. They seem a part of my"
133,FOREWORD,life. I heard them as the cry of a lone bird in the vast silence of
134,FOREWORD,eternal snows.

302,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",
303,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.","A soldier he, who ne'er forsook his post;"
304,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",Whose actions were more numerous than words;

307,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",
308,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",Worn e'er his time by hardship none may know

323,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",
324,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.","A week ago, at the Palace Bar,"
325,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",She sang the songs of France;

328,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",
329,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.","Kisses she gave and kisses she took,"
330,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",Sinned for her daily bread;
331,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",But all we knew as we eyed the box
332,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",Was: she was dead.
333,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",
334,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",We placed upon it (How much it hurt
335,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",Only the good God knows!)
336,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",A gaud she had worn in her dusky hair--

343,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.",

366,"THE HEIGHTS, CAL.","Under the white, white flakes the rose,"
