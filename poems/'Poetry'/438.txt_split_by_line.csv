37,DEDICATION,
38,DEDICATION,THERE are men and classes of men that stand above the common herd: the
39,DEDICATION,"soldier, the sailor and the shepherd not unfrequently; the artist rarely;"
40,DEDICATION,"rarely still, the clergyman; the physician almost as a rule.  He is the"
41,DEDICATION,flower (such as it is) of our civilisation; and when that stage of man is
42,DEDICATION,"done with, and only remembered to be marvelled at in history, he will be"
43,DEDICATION,"thought to have shared as little as any in the defects of the period, and"
44,DEDICATION,"most notably exhibited the virtues of the race.  Generosity he has, such"
45,DEDICATION,"as is possible to those who practise an art, never to those who drive a"
46,DEDICATION,"trade; discretion, tested by a hundred secrets; tact, tried in a thousand"
47,DEDICATION,"embarrassments; and what are more important, Heraclean cheerfulness and"
48,DEDICATION,"courage.  So it is that he brings air and cheer into the sickroom, and"
49,DEDICATION,"often enough, though not so often as he wishes, brings healing."
50,DEDICATION,
51,DEDICATION,"Gratitude is but a lame sentiment; thanks, when they are expressed, are"
52,DEDICATION,often more embarrassing than welcome; and yet I must set forth mine to a
53,DEDICATION,few out of many doctors who have brought me comfort and help: to Dr.
54,DEDICATION,"Willey of San Francisco, whose kindness to a stranger it must be as"
55,DEDICATION,"grateful to him, as it is touching to me, to remember; to Dr. Karl Ruedi"
56,DEDICATION,"of Davos, the good genius of the English in his frosty mountains; to Dr."
57,DEDICATION,"Herbert of Paris, whom I knew only for a week, and to Dr. Caissot of"
58,DEDICATION,"Montpellier, whom I knew only for ten days, and who have yet written"
59,DEDICATION,their names deeply in my memory; to Dr. Brandt of Royat; to Dr. Wakefield
60,DEDICATION,"of Nice; to Dr. Chepmell, whose visits make it a pleasure to be ill; to"
61,DEDICATION,"Dr. Horace Dobell, so wise in counsel; to Sir Andrew Clark, so unwearied"
62,DEDICATION,"in kindness and to that wise youth, my uncle, Dr. Balfour."
63,DEDICATION,
64,DEDICATION,"I forget as many as I remember; and I ask both to pardon me, these for"
65,DEDICATION,"silence, those for inadequate speech.  But one name I have kept on"
66,DEDICATION,"purpose to the last, because it is a household word with me, and because"
67,DEDICATION,if I had not received favours from so many hands and in so many quarters
68,DEDICATION,"of the world, it should have stood upon this page alone: that of my"
69,DEDICATION,"friend Thomas Bodley Scott of Bournemouth.  Will he accept this, although"
70,DEDICATION,"shared among so many, for a dedication to himself? and when next my"
71,DEDICATION,ill-fortune (which has thus its pleasant side) brings him hurrying to me
72,DEDICATION,"when he would fain sit down to meat or lie down to rest, will he care to"
73,DEDICATION,remember that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool enough to be
74,DEDICATION,ungrateful?

87,NOTE,THE human conscience has fled of late the troublesome domain of conduct
88,NOTE,for what I should have supposed to be the less congenial field of art:
89,NOTE,"there she may now be said to rage, and with special severity in all that"
90,NOTE,touches dialect; so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are
91,NOTE,"tortured, and the reader wearied, to commemorate shades of"
92,NOTE,mis-pronunciation.  Now spelling is an art of great difficulty in my
93,NOTE,"eyes, and I am inclined to lean upon the printer, even in common"
94,NOTE,"practice, rather than to venture abroad upon new quests.  And the Scots"
95,NOTE,"tongue has an orthography of its own, lacking neither “authority nor"
96,NOTE,author.”  Yet the temptation is great to lend a little guidance to the
97,NOTE,bewildered Englishman.  Some simple phonetic artifice might defend your
98,NOTE,"verses from barbarous mishandling, and yet not injure any vested"
99,NOTE,"interest.  So it seems at first; but there are rocks ahead.  Thus, if I"
100,NOTE,"wish the diphthong _ou_ to have its proper value, I may write _oor_"
101,NOTE,"instead of _our_; many have done so and lived, and the pillars of the"
102,NOTE,"universe remained unshaken.  But if I did so, and came presently to"
103,NOTE,"_doun_, which is the classical Scots spelling of the English _down_, I"
104,NOTE,"should begin to feel uneasy; and if I went on a little farther, and came"
105,NOTE,"to a classical Scots word, like _stour_ or _dour_ or _clour_, I should"
106,NOTE,"know precisely where I was—that is to say, that I was out of sight of"
107,NOTE,land on those high seas of spelling reform in which so many strong
108,NOTE,swimmers have toiled vainly.  To some the situation is exhilarating; as
109,NOTE,"for me, I give one bubbling cry and sink.  The compromise at which I have"
110,NOTE,"arrived is indefensible, and I have no thought of trying to defend it."
111,NOTE,"As I have stuck for the most part to the proper spelling, I append a"
112,NOTE,table of some common vowel sounds which no one need consult; and just to
113,NOTE,"prove that I belong to my age and have in me the stuff of a reformer, I"
114,NOTE,"have used modification marks throughout.  Thus I can tell myself, not"
115,NOTE,"without pride, that I have added a fresh stumbling-block for English"
116,NOTE,"readers, and to a page of print in my native tongue, have lent a new"
117,NOTE,uncouthness.  _Sed non nobis_.
118,NOTE,
119,NOTE,"I note again, that among our new dialecticians, the local habitat of"
120,NOTE,every dialect is given to the square mile.  I could not emulate this
121,NOTE,"nicety if I desired; for I simply wrote my Scots as well as I was able,"
122,NOTE,"not caring if it hailed from Lauderdale or Angus, from the Mearns or"
123,NOTE,"Galloway; if I had ever heard a good word, I used it without shame; and"
124,NOTE,"when Scots was lacking, or the rhyme jibbed, I was glad (like my betters)"
125,NOTE,"to fall back on English.  For all that, I own to a friendly feeling for"
126,NOTE,"the tongue of Fergusson and of Sir Walter, both Edinburgh men; and I"
127,NOTE,confess that Burns has always sounded in my ear like something partly
128,NOTE,foreign.  And indeed I am from the Lothians myself; it is there I heard
129,NOTE,the language spoken about my childhood; and it is in the drawling Lothian
130,NOTE,voice that I repeat it to myself.  Let the precisians call my speech that
131,NOTE,"of the Lothians.  And if it be not pure, alas! what matters it?  The day"
132,NOTE,draws near when this illustrious and malleable tongue shall be quite
133,NOTE,"forgotten; and Burn’s Ayrshire, and Dr. Macdonald’s Aberdeen-awa’, and"
134,NOTE,"Scott’s brave, metropolitan utterance will be all equally the ghosts of"
135,NOTE,"speech.  Till then I would love to have my hour as a native Maker, and be"
136,NOTE,read by my own countryfolk in our own dying language: an ambition surely
137,NOTE,"rather of the heart than of the head, so restricted as it is in prospect"
138,NOTE,"of endurance, so parochial in bounds of space."

344,IV,"Now by the stile ablaze she stops,"
345,IV,And his demurer eyes he drops;
346,IV,Now they exchange averted sighs
347,IV,Or stand and marry silent eyes.
348,IV,
349,IV,And he to her a hero is
350,IV,And sweeter she than primroses;

1057,XXIV,"Love for dear love, still suppliant with tears."
1058,XXIV,"Alas, not yet thy human task is done!"
1059,XXIV,A bond at birth is forged; a debt doth lie
1060,XXIV,Immortal on mortality.  It grows—
1061,XXIV,"By vast rebound it grows, unceasing growth;"
1062,XXIV,"Gift upon gift, alms upon alms, upreared,"
1063,XXIV,"From man, from God, from nature, till the soul"
1064,XXIV,At that so huge indulgence stands amazed.
1065,XXIV,
1066,XXIV,"Leave not, my soul, the unfoughten field, nor leave"
1067,XXIV,"Thy debts dishonoured, nor thy place desert"
1068,XXIV,"Without due service rendered.  For thy life,"
1069,XXIV,"Up, spirit, and defend that fort of clay,"
1070,XXIV,"Thy body, now beleaguered; whether soon"
1071,XXIV,Or late she fall; whether to-day thy friends
1072,XXIV,"Bewail thee dead, or, after years, a man"
1073,XXIV,Grown old in honour and the friend of peace.
1074,XXIV,"Contend, my soul, for moments and for hours;"
1075,XXIV,Each is with service pregnant; each reclaimed
1076,XXIV,"Is as a kingdom conquered, where to reign."
1077,XXIV,
1078,XXIV,As when a captain rallies to the fight
1079,XXIV,"His scattered legions, and beats ruin back,"
1080,XXIV,"He, on the field, encamps, well pleased in mind."
1081,XXIV,"Yet surely him shall fortune overtake,"
1082,XXIV,"Him smite in turn, headlong his ensigns drive;"

1097,XXV,
1098,XXV,"Though in the greener paths of earth,"
1099,XXV,"Mother and child, no more"
1100,XXV,We wander; and no more the birth
1101,XXV,"Of me whom once you bore,"

1104,XXV,"Though as all passes, day and night,"
1105,XXV,"The seasons and the years,"

1113,XXV,"In season fit, and still"
1114,XXV,Each must in strength arise to work the almighty will.
1115,XXV,
1116,XXV,"So from the hearth the children flee,"
1117,XXV,By that almighty hand
1118,XXV,Austerely led; so one by sea
1119,XXV,"Goes forth, and one by land;"
1120,XXV,Nor aught of all man’s sons escapes from that command
1121,XXV,
1122,XXV,So from the sally each obeys
1123,XXV,The unseen almighty nod;
1124,XXV,So till the ending all their ways
1125,XXV,Blindfolded loth have trod:
1126,XXV,"Nor knew their task at all, but were the tools of God."
1127,XXV,
1128,XXV,And as the fervent smith of yore
1129,XXV,"Beat out the glowing blade,"
1130,XXV,Nor wielded in the front of war
1131,XXV,"The weapons that he made,"
1132,XXV,But in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade;
1133,XXV,
1134,XXV,So like a sword the son shall roam
1135,XXV,On nobler missions sent;
1136,XXV,And as the smith remained at home
1137,XXV,"In peaceful turret pent,"
1138,XXV,So sits the while at home the mother well content.
