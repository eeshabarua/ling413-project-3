12,FOREWORD,"These poems, first published as ""Song-Surf"" in 1900, by a firm which failed before the book, left the press, were republished with additions as the ""lyrics"" of ""Plays & Lyrics,"" by Hodder & Stoughton, of London, in 1905. Revision and omissions have been made for this volume of a uniform edition in which they now appear. "

81,WITH OMAR,"I sat with Omar by the Tavern door, Musing the mystery of mortals o'er, And soon with answers alternate we strove Whether, beyond death, Life hath any shore. "
82,WITH OMAR,"""_Come, fill the cup,"" said he. ""In the fire of Spring Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling. The Bird of Time has but a little way To flutter--and the Bird is on the Wing._"" "
83,WITH OMAR,"""The Bird of Time?"" I answered. ""Then have I No heart for Wine. Must we not cross the Sky Unto Eternity upon his wings--Or, failing, fall into the Gulf and die?"" "
84,WITH OMAR,"""_Ay; so, for the Glories of this World sigh some, And some for the Prophet's Paradise to come; But you, Friend, take the Cash--the Credit leave, Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!_"" "
85,WITH OMAR,"""What! take the Cash and let the Credit go? Spend all upon the Wine the while I know A possible To-morrow may bring thirst For Drink but Credit then shall cause to flow?"" "
86,WITH OMAR,"""_Yea, make the most of what you yet may spend, Before we too into the Dust descend; Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie, Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End!_"" "
87,WITH OMAR,"""Into the Dust we shall descend--we must. But can the soul not break the crumbling Crust In which he is encaged? To hope or to Despair he will--which is more wise or just?"" "
88,WITH OMAR,"""_The worldly hope men set their hearts upon Turns Ashes--or it prospers: and anon, Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face, Lighting a little hour or two--is gone_."" "
89,WITH OMAR,"""Like Snow it comes--to cool one burning Day; And like it goes--for all our plea or sway. But flooding tears nor Wine can ever purge The Vision it has brought to us away."" "
90,WITH OMAR,"""_But to this world we come and Why not knowing, Nor Whence, like water willy-nilly flowing; And out of it, as Wind along the waste, We know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing_."" "
91,WITH OMAR,"""True, little do we know of _Why_ or _Whence_. But is forsooth our Darkness evidence There is no Light?--the worm may see no star Tho' heaven with myriad multitudes be dense."" "
92,WITH OMAR,"""_But, all unasked, we're hither hurried Whence? And, all unasked, we're Whither hurried hence? O, many a cup of this forbidden Wine Must drown the memory of that insolence._"" "
93,WITH OMAR,"""Yet can not--ever! For it is forbid Still by that quenchless Soul within us hid, Which cries, 'Feed--feed me not on Wine alone, For to Immortal Banquets I am bid.'"" "
94,WITH OMAR,"""_Well oft I think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried CÃ¦sar bled: That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her lap from some once lovely Head._"" "
95,WITH OMAR,"""Then if, from the dull Clay thro' with Life's throes, More beautiful spring Hyacinth and Rose, Will the great Gardener for the uprooted soul Find Use no sweeter than--useless Repose?"" "
96,WITH OMAR,"""_We cannot know--so fill the cup that clears To-day of past regret and future fears: To-morrow!--Why, To-morrow we may be Ourselves with Yesterday's sev'n thousand Years._"" "
97,WITH OMAR,"""No Cup there is to bring oblivion More during than Regret and Fear--no, none! For Wine that's Wine to-day may change and be Marah before to-morrow's Sands have run."" "
98,WITH OMAR,"""_Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument About it and about: but evermore Came out by the same Door where in I went._"" "
99,WITH OMAR,"""The doors of Argument may lead Nowhither, Reason become a Prison where may wither From sunless eyes the Infinite, from hearts All Hope, when their sojourn too long is thither."" "
100,WITH OMAR,"""_Up from Earth's Centre thro' the Seventh Gate I rose, and on the throne of Saturn sate, And many a Knot unravelled by the Road-- But not the Master-knot of Human fate._"" "
101,WITH OMAR,"""The Master-knot knows but the Master-hand That scattered Saturn and his countless Band Like seeds upon the unplanted heaven's Air: The Truth we reap from them is Chaff thrice fanned."" "
102,WITH OMAR,"""_Yet if the Soul can fling the Dust aside And naked on the air of Heaven ride, Wer't not a shame--wer't not a shame for him In this clay carcase crippled to abide?_"" "
103,WITH OMAR,"""No, for a day bound in this Dust may teach More of the SÃ¡ki's Mind than we can reach Through Ã¦ons mounting still from Sky to Sky-- May open through all Mystery a breach."" "
104,WITH OMAR,"""_You speak as if Existence closing your Account, and mine, should know the like no more; The Eternal SÃ¡ki from that Bowl has poured Millions of bubbles like us, and will pour._"" "
105,WITH OMAR,"""Bubbles we are, pricked by the point of Death. But, in each bubble, may there be no Breath That lifts it and at last to Freedom flies, And o'er all heights of Heaven wandereth?"" "
106,WITH OMAR,"""_A moment's halt--a momentary taste Of Being from the Well amid the Waste-- And Lo--the phantom Caravan has reached The Nothing it set out from--Oh, make haste!_"" "
107,WITH OMAR,"""And yet it should be--it should be that we Who drink shall drink of Immortality. The Master of the Well has much to spare: Will He say, 'Taste'--then shall we no more be?"" "
108,WITH OMAR,"""_The Moving Finger writes; and having writ, Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a line, Nor all your tears wash out a word of it._"" "
109,WITH OMAR,"""And were it other, might we not erase The Letter of some Sorrow in whose place No truer sounding, we should fail to spell The Heart which yearns behind the mock-world's Face?"" "
110,WITH OMAR,"""_Well, this I know; whether the one True Light Kindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me, quite, One flash of it within the Tavern caught Better than in the Temple lost outright._"" "
111,WITH OMAR,"""In Temple or in Tavern 't may be lost. And everywhere that Love hath any Cost It may be found; the Wrath it seems is but A Cloud whose Dew should make its power most."" "
112,WITH OMAR,"""_But see His Presence thro' Creation's veins Running Quicksilver-like eludes your pains; Taking all shapes from MÃ¡h to MÃ¡hi; and They change and perish all--but He remains._"" "
113,WITH OMAR,"""All--it may be. Yet lie to sleep, and lo, The soul seems quenched in Darkness--is it so? Rather believe what seemeth not than seems Of Death--until we know--_until we know_."" "
114,WITH OMAR,"""_So wastes the Hour--gone in the vain pursuit Of This and That we strive o'er and dispute. Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit._"" "
115,WITH OMAR,"""Better--unless we hope that grief is thrown Across our Path by urgence of the Unknown, Lest we may think we have no more to live And bide content with dim-lit Earth alone."" "
116,WITH OMAR,"""_Then, strange, is't not? that of the myriads who Before us passed the door of Darkness through Not one returns to tell us of the Road, Which to discover we must travel too?_"" "
117,WITH OMAR,"""Such is the Ban! but even though we heard Love in Life's All we still should crave the word Of one returned. Yet none is _sure_, we know, Though they lie deep, they are by Death deterred."" "
118,WITH OMAR,"""_Send then thy Soul through the Invisible Some letter of the After-life to spell: And by and by thy Soul returned to thee But answers, 'I myself am Heaven and Hell.'_"" "
119,WITH OMAR,"""From the Invisible, he does. But sent Thro' Earth, where living Goodness tho' 'tis blent With Evil dures, may he not read the Voice, 'To make thee but for Death were toil ill spent'?"" "
120,WITH OMAR,"""_Well, when the Angel of the darker drink At last shall find us by the river-brink And offering his Cup invite our souls Forth to our lips to quaff, we shall not shrink._"" "
121,WITH OMAR,"""No. But if in the sable Cup we knew Death without waking were the wilful brew, Nobler it were to curse as Coward Him Who roused us into light--then light withdrew."" "
122,WITH OMAR,"""_Then Thou who didst with pitfall and with gin Beset the Road I was to wander in, Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round Enmesh, and then impute my fall to sin._"" "
123,WITH OMAR,"""He will not. If one evil we endure To ultimate Debasing, oh, be sure 'Tis not of Him predestined, and the sin Not His nor ours--but Fate's He could not cure."" "
124,WITH OMAR,"""_Yet, ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close! The Nightingale that on the branches sang, Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows?_"" "
125,WITH OMAR,"""So does it seem--no other joys like these! Yet Summer comes, and Autumn's honoured ease; And wintry Age, is't ever whisperless Of that Last Spring, whose Verdure may not cease?"" "
126,WITH OMAR,"""_Still, would some winged Angel ere too late Arrest the yet unfolded roll of Fate, And make the stern Recorder otherwise Enregister, or quite obliterate!_"" "
127,WITH OMAR,"""To otherwise enregister believe He toils eternally, nor asks Reprieve. And could Creation perfect from his hands Have come at Dawn, none overmuch should grieve."" "
128,WITH OMAR,"So till the wan and early scent of day We strove, and silent turned at last away, Thinking how men in ages yet unborn Would ask and answer--trust and doubt and pray. "

130,JAEL,"Jehovah! Jehovah! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen? I slew him, that Sisera, prince of the host Thou dost hate. But fear of his blood is upon me, about me is breathen His spirit--by night and by day come voices that wait. "
131,JAEL,"Athirst and affrightened he fled from the star-wrought waters of Kishon. His face was as wool when he swooned at the door of my tent. The Lord hath given him into the hand of perdition, I smiled--but he saw not the face of my cunning intent. "
132,JAEL,He thirsted for water: I fed him the curdless milk of the cattle. He lay in the tent under purple and crimson of Tyre. He slept and he dreamt of the surge and storming of battle. Ah ha! but he woke not to waken Jehovah's ire. 
133,JAEL,He slept as he were a chosen of Israel's God Almighty. A dog out of Canaan!--thought he I was woman alone? I slipt like an asp to his ear and laughed for the sight he Would give when the carrion kites should tear to his bone. 
134,JAEL,"I smote thro' his temple the nail, to the dust, a worm, did I bind him. My heart was a-leap with rage and a-quiver with scorn. And I danced with a holy delight before and behind him-- I that am called blessÃ¨d o'er all unto Judah born. "
135,JAEL,"""Aye, come, I will show thee, O Barak, a woman is more than a warrior,"" I cried as I lifted the door wherein Sisera lay. ""To me did he fly and I shall be called his destroyer-- I, Jael, who am subtle to find for the Lord a way!"" "
136,JAEL,"""Above all the daughters of men be blest--of Gilead or Asshur,"" Sang Deborah, prophetess, then, from her waving palm. ""Behold her, ye people, behold her the heathen's abasher; Behold her the Lord hath uplifted--behold and be calm! "
137,JAEL,"""The mother of him at the window looks out thro' the lattice to listen-- Why roll not the wheels of his chariot? why does he stay? Shall he not return with the booty of battle, and glisten In songs of his triumph--ye women, why do ye not say?"" "
138,JAEL,"And I was as she who danced when the Seas were rended asunder And stood, until Egypt pressed in to be drowned unto death. My breasts were as fire with the glory, the rocks that were under My feet grew quick with the gloating that beat in my breath. "

140,JAEL,"Jehovah! Jehovah! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen? I slew him, that Sisera, prince of the host Thou dost hate. But fear of his blood is upon me, about me is breathen His spirit--by day and by night come voices that wait. "
141,JAEL,"I fly to the desert, I fly to the mountain--but they will not hide me. His gods haunt the winds and the caves with vengeance that cries For judgment upon me; the stars in their courses deride me-- The stars Thou hast hung with a breath in the wandering skies. "

"
145,TO THE SEA,"Or, dost thou labour with the drifting bones Of countless dead, thou mighty Alchemist, Within whose stormy crucible the stones Of sunk primordial shores, granite and schist, Are crumbled by thine all-abrasive beat? With immemorial chanting to the moon, And cosmic incantation, dost thou crave Rest to be found not till thy wild be strewn Frigid and desert over earth's last grave? "
146,TO THE SEA,"Thou seemest with immensity mad, blind-- With raving deaf, with wandering forlorn; Parent of Demogorgon whose dire mind Is night and earthquake, shapeless shame and scorn Of the o'ermounting birth of Harmony. Bound in thy briny bed and gnawing earth With foamy writhing and fierce-panted tides, Thou art as Fate in torment of a dearth Of black disaster and destruction's strides. "
147,TO THE SEA,"And how thou dost drive silence from the world, Incarnate Motion of all mystery! Whose waves are fury-wings, whose winds are hurled Whither thy Ghost tempestuous can see A desolate apocalypse of death. Oh, how thou dost drive silence from the world, With emerald overflowing, waste on waste Of flashing susurration, dashed and swirled O'er isles and continents that shrink abased! "
148,TO THE SEA,"Nay, frustrate Hope art thou, of the Unknown, Gathered from primal mist and firmament; A surging shape of Life's unfathomed moan, Whelming humanity with fears unmeant. Yet do I love thee, O, above all fear, And loving thee unconquerably trust The runes that from thy ageless surfing start Would read, were they revealed, gust upon gust, That Immortality is might of heart!

179,THE CRY OF EVE,THE CRY OF EVE 
180,THE CRY OF EVE,"Down the palm-way from Eden in the mid-night Lay dreaming Eve by her outdriven mate, Pillowed on lilies that still told the sweet Of birth within the Garden's ecstasy. Pitiful round her face that could not lose Its memory of God's perfecting was strewn Her troubled hair, and sigh grieved after sigh Along her loveliness in the white moon. Then sudden her dream, too cruelly impent With pain, broke and a cry fled shuddering Into the wounded stillness from her lips-- As, cold, she fearfully felt for his hand, And tears, that had before ne'er visited Her lids with anguish, drew from her the moan: "
181,THE CRY OF EVE,"""Oh, Adam! What have I dreamed? Now do I understand His words, so dim To creatures that had quivered but with bliss! Since at the dusk thy kiss to me, and I Wept at caresses that were once all joy, I have slept, seeing through Futurity The uncreated ages visibly! Foresuffering phantoms crowded in the womb Of Time, and all with lamentable mien Accusing without mercy, thee and me! And without pity! for tho' some were far From birth, and without name, others were near-- Sodom and dark Gomorrah--from whose flames Fleeing one turned ... how like her look to mine When the tree's horror trembled on my taste! And Babylon upbuilded on our sin; And Nineveh, a city sinking slow Under a shroud of sandy centuries That hid me not from the buried cursing eyes Of women who e'er-bitterly gave birth! Ah, to be mother of all misery! To be first-called out of the earth and fail For a whole world! To shame maternity For women evermore--women whose tears Flooding the night, no hope can wipe away! To see the wings of Death, as, Adam, thou Hast not, endlessly beating, and to hear The swooning ages suffer up to God! And Oh, that birth-cry of a guiltless child In it are sounding of our sin and woe, With prophesy of ill beyond all years! Yearning for beauty never to be seen-- Beatitude redeemless evermore! "
182,THE CRY OF EVE,"""And I whose dream mourned with all motherhood Must hear it soon! Already do soft skill, Assuasive lulls, enticings and quick tones Of tenderness--that will like light awake The folded memory children shall bring Out of the dark--move in me longingly. Yet thou, Adam, dear fallen thought of God, Thou, when thou too shall hear humanity Cry in thy child, wilt groaning wish the world Back in unsummoned Void! and, woe! wilt fill God's ear with troubled wonder and unrest!"" "
183,THE CRY OF EVE,"Softly he soothed her straying hair, and kissed The fever from her lips. Over the palms The sad moon poured her peace into their eyes, Till Sleep, the angel of forgetfulness, Folded again dark wings above their rest. "

209,IN JULY,"I shall find bell-flower spires beside the gap And lady phlox within the hollow's cool; Cedar with sudden memories of Yule Above the tangle tipped with blue skullcap. The high hot mullein fond of the full sun Will watch and tell the low mint when I've won The hither wheat where idle breezes nap, And fluffy quails entrap Me from their brood that crouch to escape mishap. "
210,IN JULY,"Then I shall reach the mossy water-way That gullies the dense hill up to its peak, There dally listening to the eerie eke Of drops into cool chalices of clay. Then on, for elders odorously will steal My senses till I climb up where they heal The livid heat of its malingering ray, And wooingly betray To memory many a long-forgotten day. "
211,IN JULY,"There I shall rest within the woody peace Of afternoon. The bending azure frothed With silveryness, the sunny pastures swathed, Fragrant with morn-mown clover and seed-fleece; The hills where hung mists muse, and Silence calls To Solitude thro' aged forest halls, Will waft into me their mysterious ease, And in the wind's soft cease I shall hear hintings of eternities.

Out of the night Crying to fright The earth he swoops to spoil-- There is furious scathe in the whirl of his wrath, In his path There is misery and moil. "

303,THE DYING POET,"Youth! my wild youth!--O, blood of my heart, Still you can answer with swirling the thought! Still like the mountain-born rapid can dart, Joyous, distraught!... "
304,THE DYING POET,"Love, and her face again! there by the wood!-- Come, thou invisible Dark with thy mask! Shall I not learn if she lives? and could I more of thee ask?... "
305,THE DYING POET,"Turn me away from the ashen west, Where love's sad planet unveils to the dusk. Something is stealing like light from my breast-- Soul from its husk ... "
306,THE DYING POET,"Soft!... Where the dead feel the buried dead, Where the high hermit-bell hourly tolls, Bury me, near to the haunting tread Of life that o'errolls. "
307,THE OUTCAST,THE OUTCAST 
308,THE OUTCAST,"I did not fear, But crept close up to Christ and said, ""Is he not here?"" "
309,THE OUTCAST,They drew me back-- The seraphs who had never bled Of weary lack-- 
310,THE OUTCAST,"But still I cried, With torn robe, clutching at His feet, ""Dear Christ! He died "
311,THE OUTCAST,"""So long ago! Is he not here? Three days, unfleet As mortal flow "
312,THE OUTCAST,"""Of time I've sought-- Till Heaven's amaranthine ways Seem as sere nought!"" "
313,THE OUTCAST,A grieving stole Up from His heart and waned the gaze Of His clear soul 
314,THE OUTCAST,"Into my eyes. ""He is not here,"" troubled He sighed. ""For none who dies "
315,THE OUTCAST,"""Beliefless may Bend lips to this sin-healing Tide, And live alway."" "
316,THE OUTCAST,"Then darkness rose Within me, and drear bitterness. Out of its throes "
317,THE OUTCAST,"I moaned, at last, ""Let me go hence! Take off the dress, The charms Thou hast "
318,THE OUTCAST,"""Around me strown! Beliefless too am I without His love--and lone!"" "
319,THE OUTCAST,"Unto the Gate They led me, tho' with pitying doubt. I did not wait "
320,THE OUTCAST,"But stepped across Its portal, turned not once to heed Or know my loss. "
321,THE OUTCAST,"Then my dream broke, And with it every loveless creed-- Beneath love's stroke. "
322,APRIL,APRIL 
323,APRIL,"A laughter of wind and a leaping of cloud, And April, oh, out under the blue! The brook is awake and the blackbird loud In the dew! "
324,APRIL,"But how does the robin high in the beech, Beside the wood with its shake and toss, Know it--the frenzy of bluets to reach Thro' the moss! "
325,APRIL,"And where did the lark ever learn his speech? Up, wildly sweet, he's over the mead! Is more than the rapture of earth can teach In its creed? "
326,APRIL,"I never shall know--I never shall care! 'Tis, oh, enough to live and to love! To laugh and warble and dream and dare Are to prove! "
327,AUGUST GUESTS,AUGUST GUESTS 
328,AUGUST GUESTS,"The wind slipt over the hill And down the valley. He dimpled the cheek of the rill With a cooling kiss. Then hid on the bank a-glee And began to rally The rushes--Oh, I love the wind for this! "
329,AUGUST GUESTS,"A cloud blew out of the west And spilt his shower Upon the lily-bud crest And the clematis. Then over the virgin corn Besprinkled a dower Of dew-gems--And, I love the cloud for this! "
330,TO A DOVE,TO A DOVE 
331,TO A DOVE,1 
332,TO A DOVE,"Thy mellow passioning amid the leaves, That tremble dimly in the summer dusk, Falls sad along the oatland's sallow sheaves And haunts above the runnel's voice a-husk With plashy willow and bold-wading reed. The solitude's dim spell it breaketh not, But softer mourns unto me from the mead Than airs that in the wood intoning start, Or breath of silences in dells begot To soothe some grief-wan soul with sin a-smart. "
333,TO A DOVE,2 
334,TO A DOVE,"A votaress art thou of Simplicity, Who hath one fane--the heaven above thy nest; One incense--love; one stealing litany Of peace from rivered vale and upland crest. Yea, thou art Hers, who makes prayer of the breeze, Hope of the cool upwelling from sweet soils, Faith of the darkening distance, charities Of vesper scents, and of the glow-worm's throb Joy whose first leaping rends the care-wound coils That would earth of its heavenliness rob. "
335,TO A DOVE,3 
336,TO A DOVE,"But few, how few her worshippers! For we Cast at a myriad shrines our souls, to rise Beliefless, unanointed, bound not free, To sacrificing a vain sacrifice! Let thy lone innocence then quickly null Within our veins doubt-led and wrong desire-- Or drugging knowledge that but fills o'erfull Of feverous mystery the days we drain! Be thy warm notes like an Orphean lyre To lead us to life's Arcady again! "

339,AT TINTERN ABBEY,"O Tintern, Tintern! evermore my dreams Troubled by thy grave beauty shall be born; Thy crumbling loveliness and ivy streams Shall speak to me for ever, from this morn; The wind-wild daws about thy arches drifting, Clouds sweeping o'er thy ruin to the sea, Gray Tintern, all the hills about thee, lifting Their misty waving woodland verdancy! "
340,AT TINTERN ABBEY,"The centuries that draw thee to the earth In envy of thy desolated charm, The summers and the winters, the sky's girth Of sunny blue or bleakness, seek thy harm. But would that I were Time, then only tender Touch upon thee should fall as on I sped; Of every pillar would I be defender, Of every mossy window--of thy dead! "
341,AT TINTERN ABBEY,"Thy dead beneath obliterated stones Upon the sod that is at last thy floor, Who list the Wye not as it lonely moans Nor heed thy Gothic shadows grieving o'er. O Tintern, Tintern! trysting-place, where never Are wanting mysteries that move the breast, I'll hear thy beauty calling, ah, for ever-- Till sinks within me the last voice to rest! "

345,"OH, GO NOT OUT","And it will suck upon thy heart-- The sorcery within her cry-- Till madness out of thee upstart, And rage to die. "
346,"OH, GO NOT OUT","For him she loved, she laughed to death! And as afloat his chill hand lay, ""Ha, ha! to hell I sent his wraith!"" Did she not say? "
347,"OH, GO NOT OUT",And from his finger strive to draw The ring that bound him to her spell? Till on her closed his hand whose awe No curse could quell? 
348,"OH, GO NOT OUT","Oh, yea! and tho' she struggled pale, Did it not hold her cold and fast, Till crawled the tide o'er rock and swale, To her at last? "
349,"OH, GO NOT OUT","Down in the pool where she was swept He holds her--Oh, go not a-near! For none has heard her cry but wept And died that year. "

354,ASHORE,"Aye! for there is no peace to me-- But on the peaceless sea! Never a child was glad at my knee, And the soul of a woman has never been mine. What can a woman's kisses be?-- I fear to think how her arms would twine. (I'm a-longing for the sea!) "
355,ASHORE,"So, not a home and ease for me-- But still the homeless sea! Where I may swing my sorrow to sleep In a hammock hung o'er the voice of the waves, Where I may wake when the tempests heap And hurl their hate--and a brave ship saves. (I'm a-longing for the sea!) "
356,ASHORE,"Then when I die, a grave for me-- But in the graveless sea! Where is no stone for an eye to spell Thro' the lichen a name, a date and a verse. Let me be laid in the deeps that swell And sigh and wander--an ocean hearse! (I'm a-longing for the sea!) "

359,THE VICTORY,"No!--though at the foot he lies, Fallen and vain, With gaze to the peak whose skies He could not attain, The victory is, with strength-- No matter the past!-- He'd dare it again, the dark length, And the fall at last! "

363,AT WINTER'S END,The crows that train o'er desert skies In endless caravans that have no goal But flight--where darkness flies-- From Pole to Pole.

368,MOTHER-LOVE,"But one said, ""Why weepest thou Here in God's heaven-- Is it not fairer than soul can see?"" ""'Tis fair, ah!--but keepest thou Not me depriven Of some one--somewhere--who needeth most me? "

And now from the plentiful South you haste, With lovingest fingers, To ruefully lift and wooingly fan The lily that lingers a-faint on the stalk: As if the chill waste Of the earth's May-dreams, The flowers so full of her joy, Were not--as it seems-- A wanton attempt to destroy.

421,THE RAMBLE,"Then, again, o'er fence, thro' thicket, To the mouth of the rough ravine, Where the weird leaf-hidden cricket Chirrs thro' the weirder green, "
422,THE RAMBLE,"There's a way, o'er rocks--but quicker Is the beat of heart and foot, As the beams above us flicker Sun upon moss and root! "
423,THE RAMBLE,And we leap--as wildness tingles From the air into our blood-- With a cry thro' golden dingles Hid in the heart of the wood.

425,THE RAMBLE,With a climb the ledging summit Of the hill is reached in glee. For an hour we gaze off from it Into the sky's blue sea.

428,RETURN,RETURN 
429,RETURN,"Ah, it was here--September And silence filled the air-- I came last year to remember, And muse, hid away from care. It was here I came--the thistle Was trusting her seed to the wind; The quail in the croft gave whistle As now--and the fields lay thinned. "
430,RETURN,"I know how the hay was steeping, Brown mows under mellow haze; How a frail cloud-flock was creeping As now over lone sky-ways. Just there where the catbird's calling Her mock-hurt note by the shed, The use-worn wain was stalling In the weedy brook's dry bed. "
431,RETURN,"And the cricket, lone little chimer Of day-long dreams in the vines, Chirred on like a doting rhymer O'er-vain of his firstling lines. He's near me now by the aster, Beneath whose shadowy spray A sultry bee seeps faster As the sun slips down the day. "
432,RETURN,"And there are the tall primroses Like maidens waiting to dance. They stood in the same shy poses Last year, as if to entrance The stately mulleins to waken From death and lead them around: And still they will stand untaken, Till drops their gold to the ground. "
433,RETURN,"Yes, it was here--September And silence round me yearned. Again I've come to remember, Again for musing returned To the searing fields' assuaging, And the falling leaves' sad balm: Away from the world's keen waging-- To harvest and hills and calm. "

437,LISETTE,And just as a woman will--even the best of them-- She yielded--brittle. God spare me the rest of them! 
438,LISETTE,"For! though but kisses--she swore!--he had of her, Was it so little? She thought 'twas not bad of her, "
439,LISETTE,"Said I would lavish a burning hour-full On any grisette. And silenced me, powerful! "
440,LISETTE,"But she was mine, and blood is inflammable-- For a Lisette! My rage was undammable.... "
441,LISETTE,Could a stiletto's one prick be prettier? Look at the gaping. No?--then you're her pitier!

"
445,FROM ONE BLIND,"Yet unto me thou art not less divine, I touch thy cheek--and know the mystery hid Within the twilight breeze; I smooth thy hair And understand how slipping hours may twine Themselves into eternity: yea, rid Of all but love, I kiss thine eyes and seem To see all beauty God Himself may dream.

447,IN A CEMETERY,"When Autumn's melancholy robes the land With silence, and sad fadings mystical Of other years move thro' the mellow fields, I turn unto this meadow of the dead, Strewn with the leaves stormed from October trees, And wonder if my resting shall be dug Here by this cedar's moan or under the sway Of yonder cypress--lair of winds that rove As Valkyries sent from Valhalla's court In search of worthy slain. And sundry times with questioning I tease The entombed of their estate--seeking to know Whether 'tis sweeter in the grave to feel The oblivion of Nature's silent flow, Or here to wander wistful o'er her face. Whether the harvesting of pain and joy Which men call Life ends so, or whether death Pours the warm chrism of Immortality Into each human heart whose glow is spent. "
448,IN A CEMETERY,"And oft the Silence hears me. For a voice Of sighing wind may answer, or a gaze, Though wordless, from a marble seraph's face. Or sometimes from unspeakable deeps of gold, That ebb along the west, revealings wing And tremble, like ethereal swift tongues Unskilled of human speech, about my heart-- Till youth, age, death, even earth's all, it seems, Are but brave moments wakened in that Soul, To whom infinities are as a span, Eternities as bird-flights o'er the sun, And worlds as sands blown from Sahara's wilds Into the ceaseless surging of the sea.... "
449,IN A CEMETERY,"Then twilight hours lead back my wandered spirit From out the wilderness of mystery Whence none may find a path to the Unknown, And chastened to content I turn me home. "

463,LINGERING,I lingered and the mellow breeze Blew to me sweetly dewed-- Its touch awoke the sorceries Your last caresses brewed.

468,FAUN-CALL,"Oh, who is he?--His eye must be As a lover's To leap and woo the chicory's hue In the hazel-hovers! "
469,FAUN-CALL,His hope must dance like radiance That hurries To scatter shades from the silent glades Where the quick hare scurries. 
470,FAUN-CALL,And he must see that Autumn's glee And her laughter From his lips and heart will quell all smart-- Of before and after!

475,THE LIGHTHOUSEMAN,"_One_--that means, ""I think of thee!"" _Two_--""I swear me thine!"" _Three_--Ah, hear me tho' you sleep!-- Is, that I know thee mine! Thro' the darkness, One, Two, Three, All the night they sweep: Thro' raging darkness o'er the deep, One--and Two--and Three. "

479,SERENITY,"Ah no, the wind has blown into my veins The blue infinity of sky, the sense Of meadows free to-day from icy pains-- From wintry vents. "

482,WANTON JUNE,"I knew she would come! Sarcastic November Laughed cold and glum On the last red ember Of forest leaves. He was laughing, the scorner, At me forlorner Than any that grieves-- Because I asked him if June would come! "
483,WANTON JUNE,"But I knew she would come When snow-hearted winter Gripped river and loam, And the wind sped flinter On icy heel, I was chafing my sorrow And yearning to borrow A hope that would steal Across the hours--till June should come. "
484,WANTON JUNE,"And now she is here-- The wanton!--I follow Her steps, ever near, To the shade of the hollow Where violets blow: And chide her for leaving, Tho' half believing She taunted me so, To make her abided return more dear. "

486,"(MIYANOSHITA, JAPAN, 1905)","(MIYANOSHITA, JAPAN, 1905) "
487,"(MIYANOSHITA, JAPAN, 1905)",Spirit of rain-- With all thy mountain mists that wander lonely As a gray train Of souls newly discarnate seeking new life only! 
488,"(MIYANOSHITA, JAPAN, 1905)","Spirit of rain! Leading them thro' dim torii, up fane-ways onward Till not in vain They tremble upon the peaks and plunge rejoicing dawnward. "
489,"(MIYANOSHITA, JAPAN, 1905)","Spirit of rain! So would I lead my dead thoughts high and higher, Till they regain Birth and the beauty of a new life's fire. "
490,AUTUMN AT THE BRIDGE,AUTUMN AT THE BRIDGE 
491,AUTUMN AT THE BRIDGE,"Brown dropping of leaves, Soft rush of the wind, Slow searing of sheaves On the hill; Green plunging of frogs, Cool lisp of the brook, Far barking of dogs At the mill; Hot hanging of clouds, High poise of the hawk, Flush laughter of crowds From the Ridge; Nut-falling, quail-calling, Wheel-rumbling, bee-mumbling-- Oh, sadness, gladness, madness, Of an autumn day at the bridge! "
492,TEARLESS,TEARLESS 
493,TEARLESS,"Do women weep when men have died? It cannot be! For I have sat here by his side, Breathing dear names against his face, That he must list to, were his place Over God's throne-- Yet have I wept no tear and made no moan. "
494,TEARLESS,"Do women weep--not gaze stone-eyed? Grief seems in vain. Do women weep?--I was his bride-- They brought him to me cold and pale-- Upon his lids I saw the trail Of deathly pain. They said, ""Her tears will fall like autumn rain."" "
495,TEARLESS,"I cannot weep! Not if hot tears, Dropped on his lids, Might burn him back to life and years Of yearning love, would any rise To flood the anguish from my eyes-- And I'm his bride! Ah me, do women weep when men have died? "
496,SUNSET-LOVERS,SUNSET-LOVERS 
497,SUNSET-LOVERS,"Upon how many a hill, Across how many a field, Beside how many a river's restful flowing, They stand, with eyes a-thrill, And hearts of day-rue healed, Gazing, O wistful sun, upon thy going! "
498,SUNSET-LOVERS,"They have forgotten life, Forgotten sunless death; Desire is gone--is it not gone for ever? No memory of strife Have they, or pain-sick breath. No hopes to fear or fears hope cannot sever. "
499,SUNSET-LOVERS,"Silent the gold steals down The west, and mystery Moves deeper in their hearts and settles darker. 'Tis faded--the day's crown; But strange and shadowy They see the Unseen as night falls stark and starker. "
500,SUNSET-LOVERS,"Like priests whose altar fires Are spent, immovable They stand, in awful ecstasy uplifted. Zephyrs awake tree-lyres, The starry deeps are full, Earth with a mystic majesty is gifted. "
501,SUNSET-LOVERS,"Ah, sunset-lovers, though Time were but pulsing pain, And death no more than its eternal ceasing, Would you not choose the throe, Hold the oblivion vain, To have beheld so many a day's releasing? "
502,THE EMPTY CROSS,THE EMPTY CROSS 
503,THE EMPTY CROSS,"The eve of Golgotha had come, And Christ lay shrouded in the garden Tomb: Among the olives, Oh, how dumb, How sad the sun incarnadined the gloom! "
504,THE EMPTY CROSS,"The hill grew dim--the pleading cross Reached empty arms toward the closing gate. Jerusalem, oh, count thy loss! Oh, hear ye! hear ye! ere it be too late! "
505,THE EMPTY CROSS,Reached bleeding arms--but how in vain! The murmurous multitude within the wall Already had forgot His pain-- To-morrow would forget the cross--and all! 
506,THE EMPTY CROSS,"They knew not Rome, before its sign, Bending her brow bound with the nations' threne, Would sweep all lands from Nile to Rhine In servitude unto the Nazarene. "
507,THE EMPTY CROSS,"Nor knew that millions would forsake Ancestral shrines great with the glow of time, And lifting up its token shake Aeons with thrill of love or battle's crime. "
508,THE EMPTY CROSS,"With empty arms aloft it stood: Ah, Scribe and Pharisee, ye builded well! The cross emblotted with His blood Mounts, highest Hope of men, against earth's hell! "
509,UNBURTHENED,UNBURTHENED 
510,UNBURTHENED,"Not grief nor the sunny wine Of gladness steeps my spirit as I gaze Over these meads that lie engarmented In stubble robes of winter-weary brown. For, as those solitary trees afar Have reached unbudding boughs to the dim day And melted on the infinite calm of space, So have I reached, and am no more distraught With the quivering pangs of memory's yesterday. But the boon of blue skies deeper than despair, Of rest that rises as a tide of sleep, Of care borne on the plumes of swan-swift clouds Away to the sullen shades of the low west, Have lulled my soul with soft infinitude-- And lent it faith's illimitable Peace. "
511,SONG,SONG 
512,SONG,"Her voice is vibrant beauty dipt In dreams of infinite sorrow and delight. Thro' an awaiting soul 'tis slipt And lo, words spring that breathe immortal. "
513,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,TO HER WHO SHALL COME 
514,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,1 
515,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,"Out of the night of lovelessness I call Thee, as, in a chill chamber where no rays Of unbelievable light and freedom fall, Might cry one manacled! And tho' the ways Thou'lt come I cannot see; tho' my heart's sore With emptiness when morning's silent grays Wake me to long aloneness; yet I know Thou hast been with me, who like dawn wilt go Beside me, when I have found thee, evermore! "
516,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,2 
517,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,"So in the garden of my heart each day I plant thee a flower. Now the pansy, peace, And now the lily, faith--or now a spray Of the climbing ivy, hope. And they ne'er cease Around the still unblossoming rose of love To bend in fragrant tribute to her sway. Then--for thy shelter from life's sultrier suns, The oak of strength I set o'er joy that runs With brooklet glee from winds that grieve above. "
518,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,3 
519,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,"But where now art thou? Watching with love's eye The eve-star wander? Listening through dim trees Some thrilled muezzin of the forest cry From his leafy minaret? Or by the sea's Blue brim, while the spectral moon half o'er it hangs Like the faery isle of Avalon, do these My yearnings speak to thee of days thy feet Have never trod?--Sweet, sweet, oh, more than sweet, My own, must be our meeting's mystic pangs. "
520,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,4 
521,TO HER WHO SHALL COME,"And will be soon! For last night near to-day, Dreaming, God called me thro' the space-built sphere Of heaven and said, ""Come, waiting one, and lay Thine ear unto my Heart--there thou shalt hear The secrets of this world where evils war."" Such things I heard as must rend mortal clay To tell, and trembled--till God, pitying, Said, ""Listen"" ... Oh, my love, I heard thee sing Out of thy window to the morning star! "
522,STORM-TWILIGHT,STORM-TWILIGHT 
523,STORM-TWILIGHT,"Tossing, swirling, swept by the wind, Beaten abaft by the rain, The swallows high in the sodden sky Circle oft and again. "
524,STORM-TWILIGHT,"They rise and sink and drift and swing, Twitterless in the chill; A-haste, for stark is the coming dark Over the wet of the hill. "
525,STORM-TWILIGHT,"Wildly, swiftly, at last they stream Into their chimney home. A livid gash in the west, a crash-- Then silence, sadness, gloam. "
526,SLAVES,SLAVES 
527,SLAVES,"A host of bloody centuries lie prone Upon the fields of Time--but still the wake Of Progress loud is haunted with the groan Of myriads, from whose peaceful veins, to slake His scarlet thirst, has War, fierce Polypheme Of fate, insatiately drunk life's stream. We bid the courier lightning leap along Its instant path with spirit speed--command Stars lost in night-eternity to throng Before the magnet eye of Science--stand On Glory's peak and triumphingly cry Out mastery of earth and sea and air. But unto War's necessity we bare Our piteous breasts--and impotently die. "

529,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,"Tho' thou hast ne'er unpent thy pain's delight Upon these airs, bird of the poet's love, Yet must I sing thy singing! For the Night Has poured her jewels o'er the lap of heaven As they who hear thee say thou dost above The wood such ecstasies as were not given By nestling breasts of Venus to the dove. "
530,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,2 
531,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Oft have I watched the moon with her fair gold Still clung to by the tattered mists of day Arise and look for thee. Then hope grew bold. And almost I could see how the near laurels Would tremble with thy trembling: but the sway Of bards who wreathed thee with unfading chorals Has held my longing lips from this poor lay. 
532,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,3 
533,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,"But take it now. And if the lark--who is Too high for earth--may vie for praise with thee In aery rhapsody, yet it is his To sing of day and joy, while thou of sorrow And night o'erhovering singest. So thou'lt be More dear than he--till hearts shall cease to borrow From grief the healing for life's mystery. "
534,WILDNESS,WILDNESS 
535,WILDNESS,"To drift with the drifting clouds, And blow with the blow of breezes, To ripple with waves and murmur with caves To soar, as the sea-mew pleases! "
536,WILDNESS,"To dip with the dipping sails, And burn with the burning heaven-- My life! my soul! for the infinite roll Of a day to wildness given! "
537,BEFORE AUTUMN,BEFORE AUTUMN 
538,BEFORE AUTUMN,Summer's last moon has waned-- Waned As amber fires Of an Aztec shrine. The invisible breath of coming death has stained The withering leaves with its nepenthean wine-- Autumn's near. 
539,BEFORE AUTUMN,Winds in the woodland moan-- Moan As memories Of a chilling yore. Magnolia seeds like Indian beads are strown From crimson pods along the earth's sere floor-- Autumn's near. 
540,BEFORE AUTUMN,"Solitude slowly steals, Steals Her silent way By the songless brook. At the gnarly yoke of a solemn oak she kneels, The musing joy of sadness in her look-- Autumn's near. "
541,BEFORE AUTUMN,"Yes, with her golden days-- Days When hope and toil Are at peace and rest-- Autumn is near, and the tired year 'mid praise Lies down with leaf and blossom on his breast-- Autumn's near. "
542,FULFILMENT,FULFILMENT 
543,FULFILMENT,"A-bask in the mellow beauty of the ripening sun, Sad with the lingering sense of summer's purpose done, The shorn and searing fields stretch from me one by one Along the creek. "
544,FULFILMENT,"The corn-stalks drop their shadows down the fallow hill; Wearing autumnal warmth the farm sleeps by the mill, Around each heavy eave low smoke hangs blue and still-- Life's flow is weak. "
545,FULFILMENT,Along the weedy roads and lanes I walk--or pause-- Ponder a fallen nut or quirking crow whose caws Seem with prehuman hintings fraught or ancient awes Of forest deeps. 
546,FULFILMENT,"Of forest deeps the pale-face hunter never trod, Nor Indian, with the silent stealth of Nature shod; Deeps tense with the timelessness and solitude of God, Who never sleeps. "
547,FULFILMENT,"And many times has Autumn, on her harvest way, Gathered again into the earth leaf, fruit, and spray; Here many times dwelt rueful as she dwells to-day, The while she reaps. "

549,LAST SIGHT OF LAND,"The clouds in woe hang far and dim: I look again, and lo, Only a faint and shadow line Of shore--I watch it go. "
550,LAST SIGHT OF LAND,The gulls have left the ship and wheel Back to the cliff's gray wraith. Will it be so of all our thoughts When we set sail on Death? 
551,LAST SIGHT OF LAND,And what will the last sight be of life As lone we fare and fast? Grief and the face we love in mist-- Then night and awe too vast? 
552,LAST SIGHT OF LAND,"Or the dear light of Hope--like that, Oh, see, from the lost shore Kindling and calling ""Onward, you Shall reach the Evermore!"" "
553,SILENCE,SILENCE 
554,SILENCE,"Silence is song unheard, Is beauty never born, Is light forgotten--left unstirred Upon Creation's morn. "
