280,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,not hitherto appeared in print. It is certainly not in Child's
281,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,Collection. It was taken down from the singing of an aged man of
282,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,"105 years, in Glen Kennaquhair. Internal evidence would tend to"
283,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,show that the incidents recorded in the ballad occurred in the
284,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,"seventeenth century, and that Sir Walter Scott had heard at least"
285,MACFADDEN AND MACFEE.,"one verse of it. The aged singer-now, alas! no more-sang it to the"
