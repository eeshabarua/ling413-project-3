1347,(A.D. 687),"In the chapel at Manhood End,"
1348,(A.D. 687),Ordered a midnight service
1349,(A.D. 687),For such as cared to attend.
1350,(A.D. 687),
1351,(A.D. 687),"But the Saxons were keeping Christmas,"
1352,(A.D. 687),And the night was stormy as well.
1353,(A.D. 687),Nobody came to service
1354,(A.D. 687),Though Eddi rang the bell.
1355,(A.D. 687),
1356,(A.D. 687),"'Wicked weather for walking,'"
1357,(A.D. 687),Said Eddi of Manhood End.

1364,(A.D. 687),And stared at the guttering flame.
1365,(A.D. 687),
1366,(A.D. 687),"The storm beat on at the windows,"
1367,(A.D. 687),"The water splashed on the floor,"
1368,(A.D. 687),"And a wet, yoke-weary bullock"
1369,(A.D. 687),Pushed in through the open door.

1371,(A.D. 687),"'How do I know what is greatest,"

1376,(A.D. 687),'But--three are gathered together--
1377,(A.D. 687),Listen to me and attend.

1379,(A.D. 687),Said Eddi of Manhood End.
1380,(A.D. 687),
1381,(A.D. 687),And he told the Ox of a Manger
1382,(A.D. 687),"And a Stall in Bethlehem,"
1383,(A.D. 687),"And he spoke to the Ass of a Rider,"
1384,(A.D. 687),That rode to Jerusalem.
1385,(A.D. 687),
1386,(A.D. 687),"They steamed and dripped in the chancel,"
1387,(A.D. 687),"They listened and never stirred,"
1388,(A.D. 687),"While, just as though they were Bishops,"
1389,(A.D. 687),Eddi preached them The Word.
1390,(A.D. 687),
1391,(A.D. 687),Till the gale blew off on the marshes
1392,(A.D. 687),"And the windows showed the day,"
1393,(A.D. 687),And the Ox and the Ass together
1394,(A.D. 687),Wheeled and clattered away.
1395,(A.D. 687),
1396,(A.D. 687),"And when the Saxons mocked him,"
1397,(A.D. 687),"Said Eddi of Manhood End,"

3240,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"When first by Eden Tree,"
3241,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"The Four Great Rivers ran,"
3242,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,To each was appointed a Man
3243,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Her Prince and Ruler to be.
3244,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3245,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"But after this was ordained,"
3246,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"(The ancient legends tell),"
3247,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"There came dark Israel,"
3248,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,For whom no River remained.
3249,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3250,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Then He Whom the Rivers obey
3251,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Said to him: 'Fling on the ground
3252,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"A handful of yellow clay,"
3253,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And a Fifth Great River shall run,"
3254,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"Mightier than these Four,"
3255,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,In secret the Earth around;
3256,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And Her secret evermore,"
3257,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Shall be shown to thee and thy Race.'
3258,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,So it was said and done.
3259,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And deep in the veins of Earth,"
3260,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And, fed by a thousand springs"
3261,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"That comfort the market-place,"
3262,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"Or sap the power of Kings,"
3263,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"The Fifth Great River had birth,"
3264,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Even as it was foretold--
3265,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,The Secret River of Gold!
3266,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3267,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,And Israel laid down
3268,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"His sceptre and his crown,"
3269,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"To brood on that River's bank,"
3270,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"Where the waters flashed and sank,"
3271,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And burrowed in earth and fell,"
3272,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"And bided a season below,"
3273,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"For reason that none might know,"
3274,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Save only Israel.
3275,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3276,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He is Lord of the Last--
3277,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"The Fifth, most wonderful, Flood."
3278,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He hears Her thunder past
3279,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,And Her Song is in his blood.
3280,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"He can foresay: 'She will fall,'"
3281,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,For he knows which fountain dries.
3282,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Behind which desert-belt
3283,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,A thousand leagues to the South.
3284,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3285,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He can foresay: 'She will rise.'
3286,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He knows what far snows melt;
3287,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Along what mountain-wall
3288,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,A thousand leagues to the North.
3289,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He snuffs the coming drouth
3290,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"As he snuffs the coming rain,"
3291,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,He knows what each will bring forths
3292,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,And turns it to his gain.
3293,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,
3294,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"A Ruler without a Throne,"
3295,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"A Prince without a Sword,"
3296,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,Israel follows his quest.
3297,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"In every land a guest,"
3298,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"Of many lands a lord,"
3299,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,In no land King is he.
3300,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,But the Fifth Great River keeps
3301,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,The secret of Her deeps
3302,SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER,"For Israel alone,"

3488,THE PRODIGAL SON,"Fed, forgiven and known again,"
3489,THE PRODIGAL SON,Claimed by bone of my bone again
3490,THE PRODIGAL SON,And cheered by flesh of my flesh.
3491,THE PRODIGAL SON,"The fatted calf is dressed for me,"
3492,THE PRODIGAL SON,"But the husks have greater zest for me,"
3493,THE PRODIGAL SON,"I think my pigs will be best for me,"
3494,THE PRODIGAL SON,So I'm off to the Yards afresh.
3495,THE PRODIGAL SON,
3496,THE PRODIGAL SON,"I never was very refined, you see,"
3497,THE PRODIGAL SON,"(And it weighs on my brother's mind, you see)"
3498,THE PRODIGAL SON,"But there's no reproach among swine, d'you see,"
3499,THE PRODIGAL SON,For being a bit of a swine.
3500,THE PRODIGAL SON,So I'm off with wallet and staff to eat
3501,THE PRODIGAL SON,"The bread that is three parts chaff to wheat,"
3502,THE PRODIGAL SON,"But glory be!--there's a laugh to it,"

3517,THE PRODIGAL SON,Worse than my betters have done.
3518,THE PRODIGAL SON,They talk of the money I spent out there--
3519,THE PRODIGAL SON,They hint at the pace that I went out there--
3520,THE PRODIGAL SON,But they all forget I was sent out there
3521,THE PRODIGAL SON,Alone as a rich man's son.
3522,THE PRODIGAL SON,
3523,THE PRODIGAL SON,"So I was a mark for plunder at once,"
3524,THE PRODIGAL SON,"And lost my cash (can you wonder?) at once,"
3525,THE PRODIGAL SON,"But I didn't give up and knock under at once,"
3526,THE PRODIGAL SON,"I worked in the Yards, for a spell."
3527,THE PRODIGAL SON,"Where I spent my nights and my days with hogs,"
3528,THE PRODIGAL SON,"And shared their milk and maize with hogs,"

4517,ACT II.    SCENE 2,He's no eyass
4518,ACT II.    SCENE 2,But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him.
4519,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"Dangerously free o' the air. Faith, were he mine"
4520,ACT II.    SCENE 2,(As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings)

4528,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"Ferdinand,"
4529,ACT II.    SCENE 2,He can endure the tall skies yonder? Cozen

4549,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4550,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_The King_.  Little enough, God knows!  But afterwards? After--"
4551,ACT II.    SCENE 2,There comes the reckoning.  I would save him that.
4552,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4553,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Ferdinand_. Save him dry scars that ache of winter-nights.
4554,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Worn out self-pity and as much of knowledge

4569,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King. _They've set it down. Strange that

4574,ACT II.    SCENE 2,the North park wall which it had climbed to pluck
4575,ACT II.    SCENE 2,nectarines from the alley. Heark again! There
4576,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"was a nectarine in its hand when we found it, and"
4577,ACT II.    SCENE 2,the naughty brick that slipped from the coping
4578,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"beneath its foot and so caused its death, lies now"
4579,ACT II.    SCENE 2,under the wall for the King to see.
4580,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4581,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King (above)_. The King to see! Why should
4582,ACT II.    SCENE 2,he? Who's the man?
4583,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4584,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow_. That is your tale. Swerve from it by so
4585,ACT II.    SCENE 2,much as the breadth of my dagger and here's your
4586,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"instant reward. You heard not, saw not, and by the"
4587,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Horns of ninefold-cuckolded Jupiter you thought not
4588,ACT II.    SCENE 2,nor dreamed not anything more or other!
4589,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4590,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. Ninefold-cuckolded Jupiter. That's a
4591,ACT II.    SCENE 2,rare oath! Shall we look closer?
4592,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4593,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Ferdinand_. Not yet, my Lord! (I cannot hear him"
4594,ACT II.    SCENE 2,breathe.)
4595,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4596,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gardener_. The North park wall? It was so.
4597,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Plucking nectarines. It shall be. But how shall
4598,ACT II.    SCENE 2,I say if any ask why our Lady the Queen--
4599,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4600,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow (stabs him)_. Thus! Hie after the Prince
4601,ACT II.    SCENE 2,and tell him y'are the first fruits of his nectarine
4602,ACT II.    SCENE 2,tree. Bleed there behind the laurels.
4603,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4604,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. Why did Gow buffet the clown?
4605,ACT II.    SCENE 2,What said he? I'll go look.
4606,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4607,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Ferdinand (above)_. Save yourself! It is the
4608,ACT II.    SCENE 2,King!
4609,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4610,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Enter the King and Ferdinand to Gow_
4611,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4612,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow_. God save you! This was the Prince!
4613,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4614,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. The Prince! Not a dead branch?
4615,ACT II.    SCENE 2,(_Uncovers the face_.)
4616,ACT II.    SCENE 2,My flesh and blood! My son! my son! my son!
4617,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4618,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Ferdinand_ (_to Gow_). I had feared something of
4619,ACT II.    SCENE 2,this. And that fool yonder?
4620,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4621,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Gow_. Dead, or as good. He cannot speak."
4622,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4623,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Ferdinand_. Better so.
4624,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4625,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. 'Loosed to adventure early!' Tell
4626,ACT II.    SCENE 2,the tale.
4627,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4628,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow_. Saddest truth alack! I came upon him
4629,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"not a half hour since, fallen from the North park"
4630,ACT II.    SCENE 2,wall over against the Deerpark side--dead--dead!--a
4631,ACT II.    SCENE 2,nectarine in his hand that the dear lad must have
4632,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"climbed for, and plucked the very instant, look you,"
4633,ACT II.    SCENE 2,that a brick slipped on the coping. 'Tis there now.
4634,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"So I lifted him, but his neck was as you see--and"
4635,ACT II.    SCENE 2,already cold.
4636,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4637,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_The King_. Oh, very cold. But why should he"
4638,ACT II.    SCENE 2,have troubled to climb? He was free of all the
4639,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"fruit in my garden, God knows!... What, Gow?"
4640,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4641,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Gow_. Surely, God knows!"
4642,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4643,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. A lad's trick. But I love him the
4644,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"better for it.... True, he's past loving.... And"
4645,ACT II.    SCENE 2,now we must tell our Queen. What a coil at the
4646,ACT II.    SCENE 2,day's end! She'll grieve for him. Not as I shall;
4647,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"Ferdinand, but as youth for youth. They were"
4648,ACT II.    SCENE 2,much of the same age. Playmate for playmate.
4649,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"See, he wears her colours. That is the knot she"
4650,ACT II.    SCENE 2,gave him last--last.... Oh God! When was
4651,ACT II.    SCENE 2,yesterday?
4652,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4653,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Ferdinand_. Come in! Come in, my Lord."
4654,ACT II.    SCENE 2,There's a dew falling.
4655,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4656,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. He'll take no harm of it. I'll follow presently.....
4657,ACT II.    SCENE 2,He's all his mother's now and none of mine--
4658,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Her very face on the bride-pillow. Yet I tricked her.
4659,ACT II.    SCENE 2,But that was later--and she never guessed.
4660,ACT II.    SCENE 2,I do not think he sinned much--he's too young--
4661,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Much the same age as my Queen. God must not judge him
4662,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Too hardly for such slips as youth may fall in.
4663,ACT II.    SCENE 2,But I'll entreat that Throne.
4664,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4665,ACT II.    SCENE 2,(_Prays by the body._)
4666,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4667,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow_. The Heavens hold up still. Earth opens
4668,ACT II.    SCENE 2,not and this dew's mere water. What shall a man
4669,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"think of it all? _(To Gardener.)_ Not dead yet,"
4670,ACT II.    SCENE 2,sirrah? I bade you follow the Prince. Despatch!
4671,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4672,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gardener_. Some kind soul pluck out the dagger.
4673,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Why did you slay me? I'd done no wrong. I'd ha'
4674,ACT II.    SCENE 2,kept it secret till my dying day. But not now--not
4675,ACT II.    SCENE 2,now! I'm dying. The Prince fell from the Queen's
4676,ACT II.    SCENE 2,chamber window. I saw it in the nut alley. He
4677,ACT II.    SCENE 2,was----
4678,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4679,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Ferdinand_. But what made you in the nut alley
4680,ACT II.    SCENE 2,at that hour?
4681,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4682,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gardener_. No wrong. No more than another
4683,ACT II.    SCENE 2,man's wife. Jocasta of the still-room. She'd kissed
4684,ACT II.    SCENE 2,me good-night too; but that's over with the
4685,ACT II.    SCENE 2,rest.... I've stumbled on the Prince's beastly
4686,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"loves, and I pay for all. Let me pass!"
4687,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4688,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Gow_. Count it your fortune, honest man. You"
4689,ACT II.    SCENE 2,would have revealed it to your woman at the next
4690,ACT II.    SCENE 2,meeting. You fleshmongers are all one feather.
4691,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_(Plucks out the dagger.)_
4692,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Go in peace and lay your death to Fortune's door.
4693,ACT II.    SCENE 2,He's sped--thank Fortune!
4694,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4695,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Ferdinand_. Who knows not Fortune, glutted on"
4696,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"easy thrones,"
4697,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Stealing from feasts as rare to coney-catch
4698,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Privily in the hedgerows for a clown.
4699,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"With that same cruel-lustful hand and eye,"
4700,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"Those nails and wedges, that one hammer and lead,"
4701,ACT II.    SCENE 2,And the very gerb of long-stored lightning loosed.
4702,ACT II.    SCENE 2,Yesterday 'gainst some King.
4703,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4704,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_The King_. I have pursued with prayers where my heart warns me

4710,ACT II.    SCENE 2,dearest.... Air!...
4711,ACT II.    SCENE 2,'Loosed to adventure early'
4712,ACT II.    SCENE 2,... I go late. _(Dies.)_
4713,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4714,ACT II.    SCENE 2,_Gow_. So! God hath cut off the Prince in his
4715,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"pleasures. Gow, to save the King, hath silenced one"
4716,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"poor fool who knew how it befell, and now the"

4720,ACT II.    SCENE 2,the road.
4721,ACT II.    SCENE 2,

4724,ACT II.    SCENE 2,
4725,ACT II.    SCENE 2,"_Gow_. To the Duke, if the Queen does not lay"

4830,(A.D. 683),Odin is angry with us!
4831,(A.D. 683),"Heavy odds have we taken,"

4876,(A.D. 683),"Who said the weather's improving,"

5517,THE EGG-SHELL,The wind took off with the sunset--
5518,THE EGG-SHELL,"The fog came up with the tide,"
5519,THE EGG-SHELL,When the Witch of the North took an Egg-shell
5520,THE EGG-SHELL,With a little Blue Devil inside.
5521,THE EGG-SHELL,"'Sink,' she said, 'or swim,' she said,"
5522,THE EGG-SHELL,'It's all you will get from me.
5523,THE EGG-SHELL,And that is the finish of _him_!' she said.
5524,THE EGG-SHELL,And the Egg-shell went to sea.
5525,THE EGG-SHELL,
5526,THE EGG-SHELL,The wind fell dead with the midnight--
5527,THE EGG-SHELL,"The fog shut down like a sheet,"
5528,THE EGG-SHELL,When the Witch of the North heard the Egg-shell
5529,THE EGG-SHELL,Feeling by hand for a fleet.
5530,THE EGG-SHELL,"'Get!' she said, 'or you're gone,' she said,"
5531,THE EGG-SHELL,But the little Blue Devil said 'No!'
5532,THE EGG-SHELL,"'The sights are just coming on,' he said,"
5533,THE EGG-SHELL,And he let the Whitehead go.
5534,THE EGG-SHELL,
5535,THE EGG-SHELL,The wind got up with the morning--
5536,THE EGG-SHELL,"And the fog blew off with the rain,"
5537,THE EGG-SHELL,When the Witch of the North saw the Egg-shell
5538,THE EGG-SHELL,And the little Blue Devil again.
5539,THE EGG-SHELL,"'Did you swim?' she  said. 'Did you sink?' she said,"
5540,THE EGG-SHELL,And the little Blue Devil replied:
5541,THE EGG-SHELL,"'For myself I swam, but I think,' he said,"
5542,THE EGG-SHELL,'There's somebody sinking outside.'

5549,THE KING'S TASK,
5550,THE KING'S TASK,"After the sack of the City, when Rome was sunk to a name,"
5551,THE KING'S TASK,"In the years that the lights were darkened, or ever St. Wilfrid came,"
5552,THE KING'S TASK,Low on the borders of Britain (the ancient poets sing)
5553,THE KING'S TASK,Between the Cliff and the Forest there ruled a Saxon King.
5554,THE KING'S TASK,Stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord--
5555,THE KING'S TASK,"Not to be cowed by the cudgel, scarce to be schooled by the sword;"
5556,THE KING'S TASK,"Quick to turn at their pleasure, cruel to cross in their mood,"
5557,THE KING'S TASK,And set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of Andred's Wood.
5558,THE KING'S TASK,Laws they made in the Witan--the laws of flaying and fine--
5559,THE KING'S TASK,"Common, loppage and pannage, the theft and the track of kine--"
5560,THE KING'S TASK,Statutes of tun and market for the fish and the malt and the meal--
5561,THE KING'S TASK,The tax on the Bramber packhorse and the tax on the Hastings keel.
5562,THE KING'S TASK,Over the graves of the Druids and under the wreck of Rome
5563,THE KING'S TASK,Rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come.
5564,THE KING'S TASK,"Behind the feet of the Legions and before the Norseman's ire,"
5565,THE KING'S TASK,Rudely but greatly begat they the framing of state and shire.
5566,THE KING'S TASK,"Rudely but deeply they laboured, and their labour stands till now,"
5567,THE KING'S TASK,If we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eight-ox plough.
5568,THE KING'S TASK,"There came a king from Hamtun, by Bosenham he came."
5569,THE KING'S TASK,"He filled Use with slaughter, and Lewes he gave to flame."
5570,THE KING'S TASK,"He smote while they sat in the Witan--sudden he smote and sore,"
5571,THE KING'S TASK,That his fleet was gathered at Selsea ere they mustered at Cymen's Ore.
5572,THE KING'S TASK,"Blithe went the Saxons to battle, by down and wood and mere,"
5573,THE KING'S TASK,But thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear.
5574,THE KING'S TASK,"Thrice was the beechmast gathered, and the Beltane fires burned"
5575,THE KING'S TASK,"Thrice, and the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned."
5576,THE KING'S TASK,"They drove that king from Hamtun, by Bosenham o'erthrown,"
5577,THE KING'S TASK,Out of Rugnor to Wilton they made his land their own.
5578,THE KING'S TASK,"Camps they builded at Gilling, at Basing and Alresford,"
5579,THE KING'S TASK,But wrath abode in the Saxons from cottar to overlord.
5580,THE KING'S TASK,"Wrath at the weary war-game, at the foe that snapped and ran"
5581,THE KING'S TASK,"Wolf-wise feigning and flying, and wolf-wise snatching his man."
5582,THE KING'S TASK,"Wrath for their spears unready, their levies new to the blades--"
5583,THE KING'S TASK,Shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscades.
5584,THE KING'S TASK,"At hearth and tavern and market, wherever the tale was told,"
5585,THE KING'S TASK,Shame and wrath had the Saxons because of their boasts of old.
5586,THE KING'S TASK,"And some would drink and deny it, and some would pray and atone;"
5587,THE KING'S TASK,"But the most part, after their anger, avouched that the sin was their own."
5588,THE KING'S TASK,"Wherefore, girding together, up to the Witan they came,"
5589,THE KING'S TASK,And as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder their blame.
5590,THE KING'S TASK,"For that was the wont of the Saxons (the ancient poets sing),"
5591,THE KING'S TASK,And first they spoke in the Witan and then they spoke to the King:
5592,THE KING'S TASK,"'Edward King of the Saxons, thou knowest from sire to son,"
5593,THE KING'S TASK,'One is the King and his People--in gain and ungain one.
5594,THE KING'S TASK,'Count we the gain together. With doubtings and spread dismays
5595,THE KING'S TASK,'We have broken a foolish people--but after many days.
5596,THE KING'S TASK,"'Count we the loss together. Warlocks hampered our arms,"
5597,THE KING'S TASK,"'We were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms."
5598,THE KING'S TASK,"'We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep,"
5599,THE KING'S TASK,"'But our angry eyes were holden, and we struck as they strike in sleep--"
5600,THE KING'S TASK,"'Men new shaken from slumber, sweating, with eyes a-stare"
5601,THE KING'S TASK,'Little blows uncertain dealt on the useless air.
5602,THE KING'S TASK,"'Also a vision betrayed us, and a lying tale made bold"
5603,THE KING'S TASK,'That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold:
5604,THE KING'S TASK,'That a shield should give us shelter--that a sword should give us power--
5605,THE KING'S TASK,'A shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour:
5606,THE KING'S TASK,"'That being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close--"
5607,THE KING'S TASK,'And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes.
5608,THE KING'S TASK,"'This was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide,"
5609,THE KING'S TASK,"'In our own camp we took them, and their names are Sloth and Pride."
5610,THE KING'S TASK,"'Our pride was before the battle: our sloth ere we lifted spear,"
5611,THE KING'S TASK,"'But hid in the heart of the people as the fever hides in the mere,"
5612,THE KING'S TASK,"'Waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise"
5613,THE KING'S TASK,'As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed dries.
5614,THE KING'S TASK,"'But now we are purged of that fever--cleansed by the letting of blood,"
5615,THE KING'S TASK,'Something leaner of body--something keener of mood.
5616,THE KING'S TASK,"'And the men new-freed from the levies return to the fields again,"
5617,THE KING'S TASK,"'Matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane."
5618,THE KING'S TASK,'And they talk aloud in the temples where the ancient wargods are.
5619,THE KING'S TASK,'They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war.
5620,THE KING'S TASK,"'They jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff."
5621,THE KING'S TASK,"'These things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears and laugh."
5622,THE KING'S TASK,"'The men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they range--"
5623,THE KING'S TASK,'And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change;
5624,THE KING'S TASK,"'And change may be good or evil--but we know not what it will bring,"
5625,THE KING'S TASK,"'Therefore our King must teach us. That is thy task, O King!'"

5634,POSEIDON'S LAW,"His fragile raft, Poseidon laughed, and 'Mariner,' said he,"
5635,POSEIDON'S LAW,"'Behold, a Law immutable I lay on thee and thine,"
5636,POSEIDON'S LAW,That never shall ye act or tell a falsehood at my shrine.
5637,POSEIDON'S LAW,
5638,POSEIDON'S LAW,"'Let Zeus adjudge your landward kin, whose votive meal and salt"
5639,POSEIDON'S LAW,"At easy-cheated altars win oblivion for the fault,"
5640,POSEIDON'S LAW,But you the unhoodwinked wave shall test--the immediate gulf condemn--
5641,POSEIDON'S LAW,"Except ye owe the Fates a jest, be slow to jest with them."
5642,POSEIDON'S LAW,
5643,POSEIDON'S LAW,"'Ye shall not clear by Greekly speech, nor cozen from your path"

5654,POSEIDON'S LAW,"He kept Poseidon's Law intact (his ship and freight beside),"
5655,POSEIDON'S LAW,"But, once discharged the dromond's hold, the bireme beached once more,"
5656,POSEIDON'S LAW,Splendaciously mendacious rolled the Brass-bound Man ashore.
5657,POSEIDON'S LAW,
5658,POSEIDON'S LAW,"The thranite now and thalamite are pressures low and high,"
5659,POSEIDON'S LAW,And where three hundred blades bit white the twin-propellers ply:
5660,POSEIDON'S LAW,"The God that hailed, the keel that sailed, are changed beyond recall,"
5661,POSEIDON'S LAW,But the robust and Brass-bound Man he is not changed at all!

5717,A TRUTHFUL SONG,
5718,A TRUTHFUL SONG,Now there wasn't a knot which the riggers knew

5722,A TRUTHFUL SONG,

5802,(A.D. 1487),And comen to Hamull on the Hoke in the countie of Suthampton.
5803,(A.D. 1487),"For there lay _The Mary of the Tower_, his ship of war so strong,"
5804,(A.D. 1487),"And he would discover, certaynely, if his shipwrights did him wrong."
5805,(A.D. 1487),
5806,(A.D. 1487),"He told not none of his setting forth, nor yet where he would go"
5807,(A.D. 1487),"(But only my Lord of Arundel), and meanly did he show,"
5808,(A.D. 1487),In an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark;
5809,(A.D. 1487),"With his frieze hood and cloak above, he looked like any clerk."
5810,(A.D. 1487),
5811,(A.D. 1487),He was at Hamull on the Hoke about the hour of the tide.
5812,(A.D. 1487),"And saw the _Mary_ haled into dock, the winter to abide,"
5813,(A.D. 1487),With all her tackle and habiliments which are the King his own;
5814,(A.D. 1487),But then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone.
5815,(A.D. 1487),
5816,(A.D. 1487),"They heaved the main-mast overboard, that was of a trusty tree,"
5817,(A.D. 1487),And they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea.
5818,(A.D. 1487),"But they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go,"
5819,(A.D. 1487),To maken beds for their own wives and little children also.
5820,(A.D. 1487),
5821,(A.D. 1487),"There was a knave called Slingawai, he crope beneath the deck."
5822,(A.D. 1487),"Crying: 'Good felawes, come and see! The ship is nigh a wreck!"

5825,(A.D. 1487),
5826,(A.D. 1487),"With that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch,"
5827,(A.D. 1487),While all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch;
5828,(A.D. 1487),"All except Bob Brygandyne and he was a yeoman good,"
5829,(A.D. 1487),He caught Slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud.
5830,(A.D. 1487),
5831,(A.D. 1487),"'I have taken plank and rope and nail, without the King his leave,"
5832,(A.D. 1487),"After the custom of Portesmouth, but I will not suffer a thief."
5833,(A.D. 1487),"Nay, never lift up thy hand at me! There's no clean hands in the trade--"
