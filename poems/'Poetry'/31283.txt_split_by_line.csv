75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,The essays here brought together are meant to illustrate English
77,PREFACE,literary criticism during the nineteenth century. A companion volume
78,PREFACE,"representative of Renaissance and Neo-classic criticism will, it is"
79,PREFACE,"hoped, be issued at a future date. Meanwhile this volume may well go"
80,PREFACE,forth alone. For the nineteenth century forms an epoch in English
81,PREFACE,literature whose beginnings are more clearly defined than those of
82,PREFACE,most literary epochs. The publication of the _Lyrical Ballads_ in
83,PREFACE,"1798, and of Wordsworth's Preface to the second edition in 1800, show"
84,PREFACE,"the Romantic Movement grown conscious and deliberate, with results"
85,PREFACE,that have coloured the whole stream of English poetry and criticism
86,PREFACE,ever since.
87,PREFACE,
88,PREFACE,The greater part of the present collection deals with general
89,PREFACE,principles rather than with criticisms of individual books or authors.
90,PREFACE,"The nineteenth century, having discarded the dogmas and 'rules' of"
91,PREFACE,"Neo-classicism, had perforce to investigate afresh the Theory of"
92,PREFACE,"Poetry, and though no systematic treatment of the subject in all its"
93,PREFACE,"bearings appeared, some valuable contributions were made, the most"
94,PREFACE,notable of which came from the poets themselves.
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,The extracts from the _Biographia Literaria_ are placed next to the
97,PREFACE,Wordsworthian doctrines which they criticize; otherwise the
98,PREFACE,arrangement of the essays is chronological.
99,PREFACE,
100,PREFACE,"American criticism is represented--inadequately, but, it is hoped, not"
101,PREFACE,unworthily--by the last two essays.
102,PREFACE,
103,PREFACE,In the preparation of this volume I have received much valuable help
104,PREFACE,"from Mr. J. C. Smith, which I now gratefully acknowledge."

178,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"[Preface to the Second Edition of _Lyrical Ballads_, 1800]"
179,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
180,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
181,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,The first Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to general
182,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"perusal. It was published, as an experiment, which, I hoped, might be"
183,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of some use to ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement"
184,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation,"
185,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted,"
186,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart.
187,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
188,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of
189,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,those Poems: I flattered myself that they who should be pleased with
190,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"them would read them with more than common pleasure: and, on the other"
191,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"hand, I was well aware, that by those who should dislike them, they"
192,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,would be read with more than common dislike. The result has differed
193,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"from my expectation in this only, that a greater number have been"
194,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,pleased than I ventured to hope I should please.

197,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
198,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems, from"
199,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a belief, that, if the views with which they were composed were"
200,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"indeed realized, a class of Poetry would be produced, well adapted to"
201,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the quality, and"
202,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,in the multiplicity of its moral relations: and on this account they
203,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory upon
204,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which the Poems were written. But I was unwilling to undertake the
205,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"task, knowing that on this occasion the Reader would look coldly upon"
206,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"my arguments, since I might be suspected of having been principally"
207,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of _reasoning_ him into an
208,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,approbation of these particular Poems: and I was still more unwilling
209,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to undertake the task, because, adequately to display the opinions,"
210,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and fully to enforce the arguments, would require a space wholly"
211,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"disproportionate to a preface. For, to treat the subject with the"
212,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"clearness and coherence of which it is susceptible, it would be"
213,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public
214,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"taste in this country, and to determine how far this taste is healthy"
215,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"or depraved; which, again, could not be determined, without pointing"
216,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,out in what manner language and the human mind act and re-act on each
217,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"other, and without retracing the revolutions, not of literature alone,"
218,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,but likewise of society itself. I have therefore altogether declined
219,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to enter regularly upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there"
220,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,would be something like impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the
221,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Public, without a few words of introduction, Poems so materially"
222,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,different from those upon which general approbation is at present
223,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,bestowed.
224,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
225,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes a"
226,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of
227,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,association; that he not only thus apprises the Reader that certain
228,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but that"
229,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,others will be carefully excluded. This exponent or symbol held forth
230,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,by metrical language must in different eras of literature have excited
231,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"very different expectations: for example, in the age of Catullus,"
232,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Terence, and Lucretius, and that of Statius or Claudian; and in our"
233,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher, and"
234,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not take upon me"
235,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to determine the exact import of the promise which, by the act of"
236,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"writing in verse, an Author in the present day makes to his reader:"
237,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,but it will undoubtedly appear to many persons that I have not
238,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted. They
239,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,who have been accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of
240,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"many modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to its"
241,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"conclusion, will, no doubt, frequently have to struggle with feelings"
242,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of strangeness and awkwardness: they will look round for poetry, and"
243,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts
244,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,can be permitted to assume that title. I hope therefore the reader
245,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,will not censure me for attempting to state what I have proposed to
246,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,myself to perform; and also (as far as the limits of a preface will
247,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,permit) to explain some of the chief reasons which have determined me
248,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,in the choice of my purpose: that at least he may be spared any
249,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"unpleasant feeling of disappointment, and that I myself may be"
250,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,protected from one of the most dishonourable accusations which can be
251,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"brought against an Author; namely, that of an indolence which"
252,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty, or, when"
253,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"his duty is ascertained, prevents him from performing it."
254,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
255,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose"
256,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe"
257,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language"
258,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"really used by men, and, at the same time, to throw over them a"
259,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be"
260,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"presented to the mind in an unusual aspect; and, further, and above"
261,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"all, to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in"
262,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"them, truly though not ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature:"
263,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"chiefly, as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a"
264,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"state of excitement. Humble and rustic life was generally chosen,"
265,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"because, in that condition, the essential passions of the heart find a"
266,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under"
267,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because in"
268,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,that condition of life our elementary feelings coexist in a state of
269,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"greater simplicity, and, consequently, may be more accurately"
270,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"contemplated, and more forcibly communicated; because the manners of"
271,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"rural life germinate from those elementary feelings, and, from the"
272,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"necessary character of rural occupations, are more easily"
273,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"comprehended, and are more durable; and, lastly, because in that"
274,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and
275,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"permanent forms of nature. The language, too, of these men has been"
276,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"adopted (purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects,"
277,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust) because
278,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best
279,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"part of language is originally derived; and because, from their rank"
280,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse,"
281,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"being less under the influence of social vanity, they convey their"
282,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions.
283,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Accordingly, such a language, arising out of repeated experience and"
284,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"regular feelings, is a more permanent, and a far more philosophical"
285,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"language, than that which is frequently substituted for it by Poets,"
286,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their
287,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"art, in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of"
288,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"men, and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression, in"
289,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"order to furnish food for fickle tastes, and fickle appetites, of"
290,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,their own creation.[1]
291,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
292,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"[1] It is worth while here to observe, that the affecting"
293,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,parts of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure
294,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and universally intelligible even to this day.
295,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
296,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"I cannot, however, be insensible to the present outcry against the"
297,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"triviality and meanness, both of thought and language, which some of"
298,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical
299,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect, where it exists, is"
300,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,more dishonourable to the Writer's own character than false refinement
301,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"or arbitrary innovation, though I should contend at the same time,"
302,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences. From
303,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,such verses the Poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at
304,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"least by one mark of difference, that each of them has a worthy"
305,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,_purpose_. Not that I always began to write with a distinct purpose
306,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"formally conceived; but habits of meditation have, I trust, so"
307,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prompted and regulated my feelings, that my descriptions of such"
308,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"objects as strongly excite those feelings, will be found to carry"
309,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"along with them a _purpose_. If this opinion be erroneous, I can have"
310,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,little right to the name of a Poet. For all good poetry is the
311,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: and though this be true,"
312,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any
313,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"variety of subjects but by a man who, being possessed of more than"
314,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"usual organic sensibility, had also thought long and deeply. For our"
315,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our
316,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"thoughts, which are indeed the representatives of all our past"
317,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"feelings; and, as by contemplating the relation of these general"
318,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"representatives to each other, we discover what is really important to"
319,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"men, so, by the repetition and continuance of this act, our feelings"
320,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"will be connected with important subjects, till at length, if we be"
321,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"originally possessed of much sensibility, such habits of mind will be"
322,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"produced, that, by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of"
323,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"those habits, we shall describe objects, and utter sentiments, of such"
324,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a nature, and in such connexion with each other, that the"
325,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,understanding of the Reader must necessarily be in some degree
326,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"enlightened, and his affections strengthened and purified."
327,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
328,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,It has been said that each of these poems has a purpose. Another
329,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,circumstance must be mentioned which distinguishes these Poems from
330,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the feeling therein"
331,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"developed gives importance to the action and situation, and not the"
332,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,action and situation to the feeling.
333,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
334,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"A sense of false modesty shall not prevent me from asserting, that the"
335,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Reader's attention is pointed to this mark of distinction, far less"
336,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,for the sake of these particular Poems than from the general
337,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,importance of the subject. The subject is indeed important! For the
338,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,human mind is capable of being excited without the application of
339,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,gross and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception
340,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of its beauty and dignity who does not know this, and who does not"
341,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"further know, that one being is elevated above another, in proportion"
342,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"as he possesses this capability. It has therefore appeared to me, that"
343,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best
344,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"services in which, at any period, a Writer can be engaged; but this"
345,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"service, excellent at all times, is especially so at the present day."
346,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are now acting"
347,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind,"
348,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion, to reduce it to a state"
349,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the
350,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"great national events which are daily taking place, and the increasing"
351,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of their"
352,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the"
353,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency
354,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the
355,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,country have conformed themselves. The invaluable works of our elder
356,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"writers, I had almost said the works of Shakespeare and Milton, are"
357,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"driven into neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid German"
358,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.--When"
359,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"I think upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation, I am"
360,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavour made in these
361,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"volumes to counteract it; and, reflecting upon the magnitude of the"
362,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"general evil, I should be oppressed with no dishonourable melancholy,"
363,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,had I not a deep impression of certain inherent and indestructible
364,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain powers in the"
365,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"great and permanent objects that act upon it, which are equally"
366,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,inherent and indestructible; and were there not added to this
367,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"impression a belief, that the time is approaching when the evil will"
368,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"be systematically opposed, by men of greater powers, and with far more"
369,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,distinguished success.
370,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
371,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I shall"
372,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,request the Reader's permission to apprise him of a few circumstances
373,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"relating to their _style_, in order, among other reasons, that he may"
374,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,not censure me for not having performed what I never attempted. The
375,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Reader will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur
376,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in these volumes; and are utterly rejected, as an ordinary device to"
377,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"elevate the style, and raise it above prose. My purpose was to"
378,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men;"
379,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular
380,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"part of that language. They are, indeed, a figure of speech"
381,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"occasionally prompted by passion, and I have made use of them as such;"
382,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,but have endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical device of
383,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"style, or as a family language which Writers in metre seem to lay"
384,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,claim to by prescription. I have wished to keep the Reader in the
385,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"company of flesh and blood, persuaded that by so doing I shall"
386,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,interest him. Others who pursue a different track will interest him
387,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"likewise; I do not interfere with their claim, but wish to prefer a"
388,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,claim of my own. There will also be found in these volumes little of
389,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,what is usually called poetic diction; as much pains has been taken to
390,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,avoid it as is ordinarily taken to produce it; this has been done for
391,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the reason already alleged, to bring my language near to the language"
392,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of men; and further, because the pleasure which I have proposed to"
393,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"myself to impart, is of a kind very different from that which is"
394,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry. Without
395,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"being culpably particular, I do not know how to give my Reader a more"
396,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,exact notion of the style in which it was my wish and intention to
397,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"write, than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured to"
398,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"look steadily at my subject; consequently, there is I hope in these"
399,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Poems little falsehood of description, and my ideas are expressed in"
400,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,language fitted to their respective importance. Something must have
401,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"been gained by this practice, as it is friendly to one property of all"
402,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"good poetry, namely, good sense: but it has necessarily cut me off"
403,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from
404,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of
405,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poets. I have also thought it expedient to restrict myself still
406,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"further, having abstained from the use of many expressions, in"
407,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"themselves proper and beautiful, but which have been foolishly"
408,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"repeated by bad Poets, till such feelings of disgust are connected"
409,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of association to
410,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,overpower.
411,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
412,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"If in a poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a single"
413,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"line, in which the language, though naturally arranged, and according"
414,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to the strict laws of metre, does not differ from that of prose, there"
415,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is a numerous class of critics, who, when they stumble upon these"
416,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prosaisms, as they call them, imagine that they have made a notable"
417,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant of his own"
418,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,profession. Now these men would establish a canon of criticism which
419,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the Reader will conclude he must utterly reject, if he wishes to be"
420,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,pleased with these volumes. And it would be a most easy task to prove
421,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to him, that not only the language of a large portion of every good"
422,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except"
423,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"with reference to the metre, in no respect differ from that of good"
424,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prose, but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the"
425,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose when
426,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be
427,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical
428,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"writings, even of Milton himself. To illustrate the subject in a"
429,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"general manner, I will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who"
430,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"was at the head of those who, by their reasonings, have attempted to"
431,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"widen the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical composition,"
432,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure
433,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of his own poetic diction.
434,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
435,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,"
436,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire:
437,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"The birds in vain their amorous descant join,"
438,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.
439,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"These ears, alas! for other notes repine;"
440,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,_A different object do these eyes require;
441,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
442,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,And in my breast the imperfect joys expire;_
443,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,"
444,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;
445,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;
446,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,To warm their little loves the birds complain.
447,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"_I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,"
448,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,And weep the more because I weep in vain_.
449,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
450,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"It will easily be perceived, that the only part of this Sonnet which"
451,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,is of any value is the lines printed in Italics; it is equally
452,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"obvious, that, except in the rhyme, and in the use of the single word"
453,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"'fruitless' for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the language of"
454,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose.
455,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
456,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,By the foregoing quotation it has been shown that the language of
457,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Prose may yet be well adapted to Poetry; and it was previously
458,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"asserted, that a large portion of the language of every good poem can"
459,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,in no respect differ from that of good Prose. We will go further. It
460,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"may be safely affirmed, that there neither is, nor can be, any"
461,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,_essential_ difference between the language of prose and metrical
462,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,composition. We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and
463,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Painting, and, accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where shall we"
464,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,find bonds of connexion sufficiently strict to typify the affinity
465,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,betwixt metrical and prose composition? They both speak by and to the
466,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,same organs; the bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said
467,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to be of the same substance, their affections are kindred, and almost"
468,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"identical, not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry[2] sheds"
469,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"no tears 'such as Angels weep', but natural and human tears; she can"
470,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,boast of no celestial ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from
471,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,those of prose; the same human blood circulates through the veins of
472,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,them both.
473,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
474,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,[2] I here use the word 'Poetry' (though against my own
475,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"judgement) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonymous with"
476,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,metrical composition. But much confusion has been introduced
477,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"into criticism by this contradistinction of Poetry and Prose,"
478,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,instead of the more philosophical one of Poetry and Matter of
479,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Fact, or Science. The only strict antithesis to Prose is"
480,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Metre; nor is this, in truth, a _strict_ antithesis, because"
481,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing
482,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prose, that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them, even"
483,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,were it desirable.
484,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
485,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves
486,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,constitute a distinction which overturns what has just been said on
487,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose, and paves"
488,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the way for other artificial distinctions which the mind voluntarily
489,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"admits, I answer that the language of such Poetry as is here"
490,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"recommended is, as far as is possible, a selection of the language"
491,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"really spoken by men; that this selection, wherever it is made with"
492,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"true taste and feeling, will of itself form a distinction far greater"
493,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"than would at first be imagined, and will entirely separate the"
494,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary life; and, if"
495,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"metre be superadded thereto, I believe that a dissimilitude will be"
496,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,produced altogether sufficient for the gratification of a rational
497,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,mind. What other distinction would we have? Whence is it to come? And
498,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"where is it to exist? Not, surely, where the Poet speaks through the"
499,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"mouths of his characters: it cannot be necessary here, either for"
500,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"elevation of style, or any of its supposed ornaments: for, if the"
501,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Poet's subject be judiciously chosen, it will naturally, and upon fit"
502,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"occasion, lead him to passions the language of which, if selected"
503,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"truly and judiciously, must necessarily be dignified and variegated,"
504,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and alive with metaphors and figures. I forbear to speak of an
505,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"incongruity which would shock the intelligent Reader, should the Poet"
506,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,interweave any foreign splendour of his own with that which the
507,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,passion naturally suggests: it is sufficient to say that such addition
508,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is unnecessary. And, surely, it is more probable that those passages,"
509,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which with propriety abound with metaphors and figures, will have"
510,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"their due effect, if, upon other occasions where the passions are of a"
511,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"milder character, the style also be subdued and temperate."
512,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
513,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"But, as the pleasure which I hope to give by the Poems now presented"
514,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to the Reader must depend entirely on just notions upon this subject,"
515,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and, as it is in itself of high importance to our taste and moral"
516,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"feelings, I cannot content myself with these detached remarks. And if,"
517,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in what I am about to say, it shall appear to some that my labour is"
518,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"unnecessary, and that I am like a man fighting a battle without"
519,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"enemies, such persons may be reminded, that, whatever be the language"
520,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"outwardly holden by men, a practical faith in the opinions which I am"
521,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,wishing to establish is almost unknown. If my conclusions are
522,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"admitted, and carried as far as they must be carried if admitted at"
523,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"all, our judgements concerning the works of the greatest Poets both"
524,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,ancient and modern will be far different from what they are at
525,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"present, both when we praise, and when we censure: and our moral"
526,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"feelings influencing and influenced by these judgements will, I"
527,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"believe, be corrected and purified."
528,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
529,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Taking up the subject, then, upon general grounds, let me ask, what is"
530,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,meant by the word Poet? What is a Poet? To whom does he address
531,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,himself? And what language is to be expected from him?--He is a man
532,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"speaking to men: a man, it is true, endowed with more lively"
533,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"sensibility, more enthusiasm and tenderness, who has a greater"
534,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"knowledge of human nature, and a more comprehensive soul, than are"
535,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,supposed to be common among mankind; a man pleased with his own
536,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"passions and volitions, and who rejoices more than other men in the"
537,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,spirit of life that is in him; delighting to contemplate similar
538,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"volitions and passions as manifested in the goings-on of the Universe,"
539,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and habitually impelled to create them where he does not find them. To
540,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,these qualities he has added a disposition to be affected more than
541,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,other men by absent things as if they were present; an ability of
542,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"conjuring up in himself passions, which are indeed far from being the"
543,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"same as those produced by real events, yet (especially in those parts"
544,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of the general sympathy which are pleasing and delightful) do more
545,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"nearly resemble the passions produced by real events, than anything"
546,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which, from the motions of their own minds merely, other men are"
547,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"accustomed to feel in themselves:--whence, and from practice, he has"
548,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,acquired a greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks
549,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and feels, and especially those thoughts and feelings which, by his"
550,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"own choice, or from the structure of his own mind, arise in him"
551,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,without immediate external excitement.
552,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
553,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,But whatever portion of this faculty we may suppose even the greatest
554,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Poet to possess, there cannot be a doubt that the language which it"
555,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"will suggest to him, must often, in liveliness and truth, fall short"
556,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of that which is uttered by men in real life, under the actual"
557,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"pressure of those passions, certain shadows of which the Poet thus"
558,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"produces, or feels to be produced, in himself."
559,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
560,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,However exalted a notion we would wish to cherish of the character of
561,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a Poet, it is obvious, that while he describes and imitates passions,"
562,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"his employment is in some degree mechanical, compared with the freedom"
563,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and power of real and substantial action and suffering. So that it
564,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,will be the wish of the Poet to bring his feelings near to those of
565,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the persons whose feelings he describes, nay, for short spaces of"
566,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"time, perhaps, to let himself slip into an entire delusion, and even"
567,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,confound and identify his own feelings with theirs; modifying only the
568,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,language which is thus suggested to him by a consideration that he
569,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"describes for a particular purpose, that of giving pleasure. Here,"
570,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"then, he will apply the principle of selection which has been already"
571,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,insisted upon. He will depend upon this for removing what would
572,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,otherwise be painful or disgusting in the passion; he will feel that
573,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"there is no necessity to trick out or to elevate nature: and, the more"
574,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"industriously he applies this principle, the deeper will be his faith"
575,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"that no words, which _his_ fancy or imagination can suggest, will be"
576,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,to be compared with those which are the emanations of reality and
577,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,truth.
578,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
579,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,But it may be said by those who do not object to the general spirit
580,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of these remarks, that, as it is impossible for the Poet to produce"
581,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,upon all occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the passion as
582,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"that which the real passion itself suggests, it is proper that he"
583,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"should consider himself as in the situation of a translator, who does"
584,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,not scruple to substitute excellencies of another kind for those which
585,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,are unattainable by him; and endeavours occasionally to surpass his
586,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"original, in order to make some amends for the general inferiority to"
587,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which he feels that he must submit. But this would be to encourage
588,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"idleness and unmanly despair. Further, it is the language of men who"
589,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,speak of what they do not understand; who talk of Poetry as of a
590,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,matter of amusement and idle pleasure; who will converse with us as
591,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"gravely about a _taste_ for Poetry, as they express it, as if it were"
592,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a thing as indifferent as a taste for rope-dancing, or Frontiniac or"
593,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Sherry. Aristotle, I have been told, has said, that Poetry is the most"
594,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"philosophic of all writing: it is so: its object is truth, not"
595,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"individual and local, but general, and operative; not standing upon"
596,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"external testimony, but carried alive into the heart by passion; truth"
597,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which is its own testimony, which gives competence and confidence to"
598,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the tribunal to which it appeals, and receives them from the same"
599,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,tribunal. Poetry is the image of man and nature. The obstacles which
600,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"stand in the way of the fidelity of the Biographer and Historian, and"
601,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of their consequent utility, are incalculably greater than those which"
602,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,are to be encountered by the Poet who comprehends the dignity of his
603,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"art. The Poet writes under one restriction only, namely, the necessity"
604,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of giving immediate pleasure to a human Being possessed of that
605,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"information which may be expected from him, not as a lawyer, a"
606,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"physician, a mariner, an astronomer, or a natural philosopher, but as"
607,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a Man. Except this one restriction, there is no object standing"
608,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"between the Poet and the image of things; between this, and the"
609,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Biographer and Historian, there are a thousand."
610,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
611,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Nor let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered
612,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,as a degradation of the Poet's art. It is far otherwise. It is an
613,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"acknowledgement of the beauty of the universe, an acknowledgement the"
614,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"more sincere, because not formal, but indirect; it is a task light and"
615,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love: further, it"
616,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is a homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man, to the grand"
617,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"elementary principle of pleasure, by which he knows, and feels, and"
618,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"lives, and moves. We have no sympathy but what is propagated by"
619,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,pleasure: I would not be misunderstood; but wherever we sympathize
620,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"with pain, it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried"
621,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"on by subtle combinations with pleasure. We have no knowledge, that"
622,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is, no general principles drawn from the contemplation of particular"
623,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"facts, but what has been built up by pleasure, and exists in us by"
624,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"pleasure alone. The Man of science, the Chemist and Mathematician,"
625,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"whatever difficulties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with,"
626,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,know and feel this. However painful may be the objects with which the
627,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Anatomist's knowledge is connected, he feels that his knowledge is"
628,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,pleasure; and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge. What then
629,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,does the Poet? He considers man and the objects that surround him as
630,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"acting and re-acting upon each other, so as to produce an infinite"
631,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,complexity of pain and pleasure; he considers man in his own nature
632,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain quantity
633,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of immediate knowledge, with certain convictions, intuitions, and"
634,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"deductions, which from habit acquire the quality of intuitions; he"
635,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and
636,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"sensations, and finding everywhere objects that immediately excite in"
637,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"him sympathies which, from the necessities of his nature, are"
638,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment.
639,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
640,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"To this knowledge which all men carry about with them, and to these"
641,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"sympathies in which, without any other discipline than that of our"
642,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"daily life, we are fitted to take delight, the Poet principally"
643,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,directs his attention. He considers man and nature as essentially
644,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"adapted to each other, and the mind of man as naturally the mirror of"
645,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the fairest and most interesting properties of nature. And thus the
646,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Poet, prompted by this feeling of pleasure, which accompanies him"
647,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"through the whole course of his studies, converses with general"
648,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"nature, with affections akin to those, which, through labour and"
649,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"length of time, the Man of science has raised up in himself, by"
650,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,conversing with those particular parts of nature which are the objects
651,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of his studies. The knowledge both of the Poet and the Man of science
652,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,is pleasure; but the knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary
653,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"part of our existence, our natural and unalienable inheritance; the"
654,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"other is a personal and individual acquisition, slow to come to us,"
655,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and by no habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with our
656,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,fellow-beings. The Man of science seeks truth as a remote and unknown
657,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"benefactor; he cherishes and loves it in his solitude: the Poet,"
658,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"singing a song in which all human beings join with him, rejoices in"
659,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly companion.
660,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the
661,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all Science.
662,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Emphatically may it be said of the Poet, as Shakespeare hath said of"
663,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"man, 'that he looks before and after.' He is the rock of defence for"
664,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"human nature; an upholder and preserver, carrying everywhere with him"
665,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"relationship and love. In spite of difference of soil and climate, of"
666,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"language and manners, of laws and customs: in spite of things silently"
667,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"gone out of mind, and things violently destroyed; the Poet binds"
668,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society, as"
669,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time. The objects of"
670,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the Poet's thoughts are everywhere; though the eyes and senses of man
671,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"are, it is true, his favourite guides, yet he will follow wheresoever"
672,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings.
673,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poetry is the first and last of all knowledge--it is as immortal as
674,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the heart of man. If the labours of Men of science should ever create
675,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"any material revolution, direct or indirect, in our condition, and in"
676,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the impressions which we habitually receive, the Poet will sleep then"
677,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,no more than at present; he will be ready to follow the steps of the
678,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Man of science, not only in those general indirect effects, but he"
679,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"will be at his side, carrying sensation into the midst of the objects"
680,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of the science itself. The remotest discoveries of the Chemist, the"
681,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Botanist, or Mineralogist, will be as proper objects of the Poet's art"
682,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"as any upon which it can be employed, if the time should ever come"
683,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"when these things shall be familiar to us, and the relations under"
684,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective
685,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying
686,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,and suffering beings. If the time should ever come when what is now
687,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"called science, thus familiarized to men, shall be ready to put on, as"
688,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"it were, a form of flesh and blood, the Poet will lend his divine"
689,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"spirit to aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the Being thus"
690,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"produced, as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man.--It is"
691,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"not, then, to be supposed that any one, who holds that sublime notion"
692,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of Poetry which I have attempted to convey, will break in upon the"
693,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,sanctity and truth of his pictures by transitory and accidental
694,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"ornaments, and endeavour to excite admiration of himself by arts, the"
695,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,necessity of which must manifestly depend upon the assumed meanness of
696,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,his subject.
697,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
698,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,What has been thus far said applies to Poetry in general; but
699,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,especially to those parts of composition where the Poet speaks through
700,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the mouths of his characters; and upon this point it appears to
701,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"authorize the conclusion that there are few persons of good sense, who"
702,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"would not allow that the dramatic parts of composition are defective,"
703,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in proportion as they deviate from the real language of nature, and"
704,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"are coloured by a diction of the Poet's own, either peculiar to him as"
705,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,an individual Poet or belonging simply to Poets in general; to a body
706,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of men who, from the circumstance of their compositions being in"
707,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"metre, it is expected will employ a particular language."
708,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
709,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"It is not, then, in the dramatic parts of composition that we look"
710,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,for this distinction of language; but still it may be proper and
711,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,necessary where the Poet speaks to us in his own person and character.
712,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,To this I answer by referring the Reader to the description before
713,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,given of a Poet. Among the qualities there enumerated as principally
714,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"conducing to form a Poet, is implied nothing differing in kind from"
715,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"other men, but only in degree. The sum of what was said is, that the"
716,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by a greater promptness
717,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to think and feel without immediate external excitement, and a greater"
718,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,power in expressing such thoughts and feelings as are produced in him
719,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,in that manner. But these passions and thoughts and feelings are the
720,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,general passions and thoughts and feelings of men. And with what are
721,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,they connected? Undoubtedly with our moral sentiments and animal
722,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"sensations, and with the causes which excite these; with the"
723,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"operations of the elements, and the appearances of the visible"
724,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"universe; with storm and sunshine, with the revolutions of the"
725,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"seasons, with cold and heat, with loss of friends and kindred, with"
726,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"injuries and resentments, gratitude and hope, with fear and sorrow."
727,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"These, and the like, are the sensations and objects which the Poet"
728,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"describes, as they are the sensations of other men, and the objects"
729,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which interest them. The Poet thinks and feels in the spirit of human
730,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"passions. How, then, can his language differ in any material degree"
731,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,from that of all other men who feel vividly and see clearly? It might
732,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,be _proved_ that it is impossible. But supposing that this were not
733,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the case, the Poet might then be allowed to use a peculiar language"
734,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"when expressing his feelings for his own gratification, or that of"
735,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"men like himself. But Poets do not write for Poets alone, but for men."
736,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Unless therefore we are advocates for that admiration which subsists
737,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"upon ignorance, and that pleasure which arises from hearing what we do"
738,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"not understand, the Poet must descend from this supposed height; and,"
739,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in order to excite rational sympathy, he must express himself as other"
740,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"men express themselves. To this it may be added, that while he is only"
741,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"selecting from the real language of men, or, which amounts to the same"
742,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"thing, composing accurately in the spirit of such selection, he is"
743,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"treading upon safe ground, and we know what we are to expect from him."
744,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Our feelings are the same with respect to metre; for, as it may be"
745,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"proper to remind the Reader, the distinction of metre is regular and"
746,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"uniform, and not, like that which is produced by what is usually"
747,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"called POETIC DICTION, arbitrary, and subject to infinite caprices"
748,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"upon which no calculation whatever can be made. In the one case, the"
749,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet, respecting what imagery or"
750,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"diction he may choose to connect with the passion; whereas, in the"
751,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"other, the metre obeys certain laws, to which the Poet and Reader both"
752,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"willingly submit because they are certain, and because no interference"
753,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is made by them with the passion, but such as the concurring testimony"
754,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of ages has shown to heighten and improve the pleasure which co-exists
755,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,with it.
756,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
757,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"It will now be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, Why,"
758,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"professing these opinions, have I written in verse? To this, in"
759,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"addition to such answer as is included in what has been already said,"
760,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"I reply, in the first place, Because, however I may have restricted"
761,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"myself, there is still left open to me what confessedly constitutes"
762,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the most valuable object of all writing, whether in prose or verse;"
763,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the great and universal passions of men, the most general and"
764,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"interesting of their occupations, and the entire world of nature"
765,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"before me--to supply endless combinations of forms and imagery. Now,"
766,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,supposing for a moment that whatever is interesting in these objects
767,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"may be as vividly described in prose, why should I be condemned for"
768,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"attempting to superadd to such description the charm which, by the"
769,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"consent of all nations, is acknowledged to exist in metrical language?"
770,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"To this, by such as are yet unconvinced, it may be answered that a"
771,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,very small part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon the
772,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"metre, and that it is injudicious to write in metre, unless it be"
773,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,accompanied with the other artificial distinctions of style with which
774,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"metre is usually accompanied, and that, by such deviation, more will"
775,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,be lost from the shock which will thereby be given to the Reader's
776,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can
777,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who still
778,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain
779,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its
780,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly underrate the"
781,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"power of metre in itself, it might, perhaps, as far as relates to"
782,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"these Volumes, have been almost sufficient to observe, that poems are"
783,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"extant, written upon more humble subjects, and in a still more naked"
784,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and simple style, which have continued to give pleasure from"
785,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"generation to generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a"
786,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"defect, the fact here mentioned affords a strong presumption that"
787,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,poems somewhat less naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure
788,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"at the present day; and, what I wished _chiefly_ to attempt, at"
789,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"present, was to justify myself for having written under the impression"
790,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of this belief.
791,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
792,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"But various causes might be pointed out why, when the style is manly,"
793,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and the subject of some importance, words metrically arranged will"
794,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who proves
795,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart. The end of
796,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Poetry is to produce excitement in co-existence with an overbalance of
797,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"pleasure; but, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and"
798,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"irregular state of the mind; ideas and feelings do not, in that state,"
799,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"succeed each other in accustomed order. If the words, however, by"
800,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which this excitement is produced be in themselves powerful, or the"
801,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with
802,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"them, there is some danger that the excitement may be carried beyond"
803,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"its proper bounds. Now the co-presence of something regular, something"
804,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in a less
805,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and"
806,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling, and of"
807,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion. This
808,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is unquestionably true; and hence, though the opinion will at first"
809,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"appear paradoxical, from the tendency of metre to divest language, in"
810,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"a certain degree, of its reality, and thus to throw a sort of"
811,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,half-consciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole
812,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"composition, there can be little doubt but that more pathetic"
813,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"situations and sentiments, that is, those which have a greater"
814,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"proportion of pain connected with them, may be endured in metrical"
815,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"composition, especially in rhyme, than in prose. The metre of the old"
816,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,ballads is very artless; yet they contain many passages which would
817,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"illustrate this opinion; and, I hope, if the following Poems be"
818,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"attentively perused, similar instances will be found in them. This"
819,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the Reader's own
820,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the re-perusal of
821,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the distressful parts of _Clarissa Harlowe_, or the _Gamester_; while"
822,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Shakespeare's writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon"
823,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"us, as pathetic, beyond the bounds of pleasure--an effect which, in a"
824,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"much greater degree than might at first be imagined, is to be ascribed"
825,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise"
826,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,from the metrical arrangement.--On the other hand (what it must be
827,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,allowed will much more frequently happen) if the Poet's words should
828,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to raise the Reader"
829,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to a height of desirable excitement, then (unless the Poet's choice of"
830,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"his metre has been grossly injudicious), in the feelings of pleasure"
831,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which the Reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in general,"
832,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and in the feeling, whether cheerful or melancholy, which he has been"
833,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre, there"
834,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart
835,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet"
836,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,proposes to himself.
837,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
838,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,If I had undertaken a SYSTEMATIC defence of the theory here
839,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"maintained, it would have been my duty to develop the various causes"
840,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among
841,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be
842,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,well known to those who have made any of the Arts the object of
843,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"accurate reflection; namely, the pleasure which the mind derives from"
844,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the perception of similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the
845,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"great spring of the activity of our minds, and their chief feeder."
846,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"From this principle the direction of the sexual appetite, and all the"
847,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"passions connected with it, take their origin: it is the life of our"
848,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,ordinary conversation; and upon the accuracy with which similitude in
849,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend"
850,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,our taste and our moral feelings. It would not be a useless employment
851,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to apply this principle to the consideration of metre, and to show"
852,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure, and to point out"
853,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,in what manner that pleasure is produced. But my limits will not
854,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must content myself with a"
855,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,general summary.
856,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
857,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
858,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in
859,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till, by a species of"
860,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"reaction, the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion,"
861,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is"
862,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind. In"
863,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"this mood successful composition generally begins, and in a mood"
864,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind,"
865,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and in whatever degree, from various causes, is qualified by various"
866,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"pleasures, so that in describing any passions whatsoever, which are"
867,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"voluntarily described, the mind will, upon the whole, be in a state of"
868,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,enjoyment. If Nature be thus cautious to preserve in a state of
869,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"enjoyment a being so employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson"
870,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"held forth to him, and ought especially to take care, that, whatever"
871,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"passions he communicates to his Reader, those passions, if his"
872,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Reader's mind be sound and vigorous, should always be accompanied with"
873,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of harmonious metrical
874,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind association"
875,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or
876,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"metre of the same or similar construction, an indistinct perception"
877,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of real life,"
878,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and yet, in the circumstance of metre, differing from it so"
879,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"widely--all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight,"
880,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling
881,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper
882,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned
883,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"poetry; while, in lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness with"
884,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a
885,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,principal source of the gratification of the Reader. All that it is
886,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"_necessary_ to say, however, upon this subject, may be effected by"
887,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"affirming, what few persons will deny, that, of two descriptions,"
888,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"either of passions, manners, or characters, each of them equally well"
889,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"executed, the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse will be"
890,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,read a hundred times where the prose is read once.
891,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
892,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Having thus explained a few of my reasons for writing in verse, and"
893,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"why I have chosen subjects from common life, and endeavoured to bring"
894,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"my language near to the real language of men, if I have been too"
895,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the same time been treating"
896,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,a subject of general interest; and for this reason a few words shall
897,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"be added with reference solely to these particular poems, and to some"
898,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,defects which will probably be found in them. I am sensible that my
899,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general,"
900,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance, I may"
901,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,have sometimes written upon unworthy subjects; but I am less
902,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"apprehensive on this account, than that my language may frequently"
903,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,have suffered from those arbitrary connexions of feelings and ideas
904,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"with particular words and phrases, from which no man can altogether"
905,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"protect himself. Hence I have no doubt, that, in some instances,"
906,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"feelings, even of the ludicrous, may be given to my Readers by"
907,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic. Such faulty
908,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present, and that"
909,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly take all"
910,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,reasonable pains to correct. But it is dangerous to make these
911,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals, or even of"
912,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,certain classes of men; for where the understanding of an Author is
913,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be done without"
914,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,great injury to himself: for his own feelings are his stay and
915,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"support; and, if he set them aside in one instance, he may be induced"
916,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to repeat this act till his mind shall lose all confidence in itself,"
917,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and become utterly debilitated. To this it may be added, that the"
918,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,critic ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same
919,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"errors as the Poet, and, perhaps, in a much greater degree: for there"
920,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"can be no presumption in saying of most readers, that it is not"
921,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,probable they will be so well acquainted with the various stages of
922,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"meaning through which words have passed, or with the fickleness or"
923,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other; and,"
924,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"above all, since they are so much less interested in the subject, they"
925,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,may decide lightly and carelessly.
926,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
927,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Long as the Reader has been detained, I hope he will permit me to"
928,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied
929,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to Poetry, in which the language closely resembles that of life and"
930,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"nature. Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies, of which Dr."
931,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Johnson's stanza is a fair specimen:--
932,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
933,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,I put my hat upon my head
934,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"And walked into the Strand,"
935,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,And there I met another man
936,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Whose hat was in his hand.
937,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
938,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Immediately under these lines let us place one of the most
939,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,justly-admired stanzas of the 'Babes in the Wood.'
940,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
941,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,These pretty Babes with hand in hand
942,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Went wandering up and down;
943,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,But never more they saw the Man
944,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,Approaching from the Town.
945,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
946,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"In both these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in no"
947,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation. There are
948,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"words in both, for example, 'the Strand', and 'the Town', connected"
949,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the one stanza we admit as
950,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"admirable, and the other as a fair example of the superlatively"
951,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"contemptible. Whence arises this difference? Not from the metre, not"
952,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"from the language, not from the order of the words; but the _matter_"
953,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,expressed in Dr. Johnson's stanza is contemptible. The proper method
954,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"of treating trivial and simple verses, to which Dr. Johnson's stanza"
955,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"would be a fair parallelism, is not to say, this is a bad kind of"
956,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"poetry, or, this is not poetry; but, this wants sense; it is neither"
957,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"interesting in itself, nor can _lead_ to anything interesting; the"
958,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"images neither originate in that sane state of feeling, which arises"
959,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in the Reader. This"
960,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses. Why trouble
961,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,yourself about the species till you have previously decided upon the
962,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"genus? Why take pains to prove that an ape is not a Newton, when it is"
963,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,self-evident that he is not a man?
964,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
965,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"One request I must make of my reader, which is, that in judging these"
966,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by"
967,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,reflection upon what will probably be the judgement of others. How
968,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"common is it to hear a person say, I myself do not object to this"
969,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"style of composition, or this or that expression, but, to such and"
970,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous! This mode of
971,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"criticism, so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgement, is"
972,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"almost universal: let the Reader then abide, independently, by his own"
973,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"feelings, and, if he finds himself affected, let him not suffer such"
974,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,conjectures to interfere with his pleasure.
975,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
976,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"If an Author, by any single composition, has impressed us with respect"
977,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"for his talents, it is useful to consider this as affording a"
978,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"presumption, that on other occasions where we have been displeased,"
979,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"he, nevertheless, may not have written ill or absurdly; and further,"
980,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us
981,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"to review what has displeased us, with more care than we should"
982,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"otherwise have bestowed upon it. This is not only an act of justice,"
983,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"but, in our decisions upon poetry especially, may conduce, in a high"
984,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"degree, to the improvement of our own taste; for an _accurate_ taste"
985,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"in poetry, and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has"
986,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"observed, is an _acquired_ talent, which can only be produced by"
987,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,thought and a long-continued intercourse with the best models of
988,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"composition. This is mentioned, not with so ridiculous a purpose as to"
989,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I"
990,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,have already said that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to
991,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest, that, if Poetry be a"
992,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgement may be"
993,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"erroneous; and that, in many cases, it necessarily will be so."
994,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
995,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"Nothing would, I know, have so effectually contributed to further the"
996,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"end which I have in view, as to have shown of what kind the pleasure"
997,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is, and how that pleasure is produced, which is confessedly produced"
998,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,by metrical composition essentially different from that which I have
999,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,here endeavoured to recommend: for the Reader will say that he has
1000,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,been pleased by such composition; and what more can be done for him?
1001,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"The power of any art is limited; and he will suspect, that, if it be"
1002,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"proposed to furnish him with new friends, that can be only upon"
1003,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"condition of his abandoning his old friends. Besides, as I have said,"
1004,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the Reader is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received
1005,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"from such composition, composition to which he has peculiarly attached"
1006,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"the endearing name of Poetry; and all men feel an habitual gratitude,"
1007,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"and something of an honourable bigotry, for the objects which have"
1008,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"long continued to please them: we not only wish to be pleased, but to"
1009,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,be pleased in that particular way in which we have Been accustomed to
1010,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,be pleased. There is in these feelings enough to resist a host of
1011,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"arguments; and I should be the less able to combat them successfully,"
1012,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the Poetry"
1013,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what"
1014,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"is ordinarily enjoyed. But, would my limits have permitted me to point"
1015,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"out how this pleasure is produced, many obstacles might have been"
1016,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"removed, and the Reader assisted in perceiving that the powers of"
1017,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,language are not so limited as he may suppose; and that it is possible
1018,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"for poetry to give other enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and"
1019,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,more exquisite nature. This part of the subject has not been
1020,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"altogether neglected, but it has not been so much my present aim to"
1021,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"prove, that the interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is less"
1022,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind, as to offer"
1023,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"reasons for presuming, that if my purpose were fulfilled, a species of"
1024,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in its nature well"
1025,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important in"
1026,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations.
1027,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,
1028,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"From what has been said, and from a perusal of the Poems, the Reader"
1029,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,will be able clearly to perceive the object which I had in view: he
1030,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"will determine how far it has been attained; and, what is a much more"
1031,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,"important question, whether it be worth attaining: and upon the"
1032,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation
1033,POETRY AND POETIC DICTION,of the Public.

1040,ON POETIC DICTION,"Perhaps, as I have no right to expect that attentive perusal, without"
1041,ON POETIC DICTION,"which, confined, as I have been, to the narrow limits of a preface, my"
1042,ON POETIC DICTION,"meaning cannot be thoroughly understood, I am anxious to give an exact"
1043,ON POETIC DICTION,notion of the sense in which the phrase poetic diction has been used;
1044,ON POETIC DICTION,"and for this purpose, a few words shall here be added, concerning the"
1045,ON POETIC DICTION,"origin and characteristics of the phraseology, which I have condemned"
1046,ON POETIC DICTION,under that name.
1047,ON POETIC DICTION,
1048,ON POETIC DICTION,The earliest poets of all nations generally wrote from passion excited
1049,ON POETIC DICTION,"by real events; they wrote naturally, and as men: feeling powerfully"
1050,ON POETIC DICTION,"as they did, their language was daring, and figurative. In succeeding"
1051,ON POETIC DICTION,"times, Poets, and Men ambitious of the fame of Poets, perceiving the"
1052,ON POETIC DICTION,"influence of such language, and desirous of producing the same effect"
1053,ON POETIC DICTION,"without being animated by the same passion, set themselves to a"
1054,ON POETIC DICTION,"mechanical adoption of these figures of speech, and made use of them,"
1055,ON POETIC DICTION,"sometimes with propriety, but much more frequently applied them to"
1056,ON POETIC DICTION,feelings and thoughts with which they had no natural connexion
1057,ON POETIC DICTION,"whatsoever. A language was thus insensibly produced, differing"
1058,ON POETIC DICTION,materially from the real language of men in _any situation_. The
1059,ON POETIC DICTION,Reader or Hearer of this distorted language found himself in a
1060,ON POETIC DICTION,perturbed and unusual state of mind: when affected by the genuine
1061,ON POETIC DICTION,language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of
1062,ON POETIC DICTION,mind also: in both cases he was willing that his common judgement and
1063,ON POETIC DICTION,"understanding should be laid asleep, and he had no instinctive and"
1064,ON POETIC DICTION,infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false; the
1065,ON POETIC DICTION,one served as a passport for the other. The emotion was in both cases
1066,ON POETIC DICTION,"delightful, and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other, and"
1067,ON POETIC DICTION,"believed them both to be produced by the same, or similar causes."
1068,ON POETIC DICTION,"Besides, the Poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked"
1069,ON POETIC DICTION,"up to, a man of genius and authority. Thus, and from a variety of"
1070,ON POETIC DICTION,"other causes, this distorted language was received with admiration;"
1071,ON POETIC DICTION,"and Poets, it is probable, who had before contented themselves for the"
1072,ON POETIC DICTION,most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been
1073,ON POETIC DICTION,"dictated by real passion, carried the abuse still further, and"
1074,ON POETIC DICTION,introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original
1075,ON POETIC DICTION,"figurative language of passion, yet altogether of their own invention,"
1076,ON POETIC DICTION,and characterized by various degrees of wanton deviation from good
1077,ON POETIC DICTION,sense and nature.
1078,ON POETIC DICTION,
1079,ON POETIC DICTION,"It is indeed true, that the language of the earliest Poets was felt to"
1080,ON POETIC DICTION,"differ materially from ordinary language, because it was the language"
1081,ON POETIC DICTION,"of extraordinary occasions; but it was really spoken by men, language"
1082,ON POETIC DICTION,which the Poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the
1083,ON POETIC DICTION,"events which he described, or which he had heard uttered by those"
1084,ON POETIC DICTION,around him. To this language it is probable that metre of some sort or
1085,ON POETIC DICTION,other was early superadded. This separated the genuine language of
1086,ON POETIC DICTION,"Poetry still further from common life, so that whoever read or heard"
1087,ON POETIC DICTION,the poems of these earliest Poets felt himself moved in a way in which
1088,ON POETIC DICTION,"he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life, and by causes"
1089,ON POETIC DICTION,manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life.
1090,ON POETIC DICTION,This was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have
1091,ON POETIC DICTION,followed: under the protection of this feeling succeeding Poets
1092,ON POETIC DICTION,"constructed a phraseology which had one thing, it is true, in common"
1093,ON POETIC DICTION,"with the genuine language of poetry, namely, that it was not heard in"
1094,ON POETIC DICTION,"ordinary conversation; that it was unusual. But the first Poets, as I"
1095,ON POETIC DICTION,"have said, spake a language which, though unusual, was still the"
1096,ON POETIC DICTION,"language of men. This circumstance, however, was disregarded by their"
1097,ON POETIC DICTION,successors; they found that they could please by easier means: they
1098,ON POETIC DICTION,became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had
1099,ON POETIC DICTION,"invented, and which were uttered only by themselves. In process of"
1100,ON POETIC DICTION,"time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language, and"
1101,ON POETIC DICTION,"whoever took upon him to write in metre, according as he possessed"
1102,ON POETIC DICTION,"more or less of true poetic genius, introduced less or more of this"
1103,ON POETIC DICTION,"adulterated phraseology into his compositions, and the true and the"
1104,ON POETIC DICTION,"false were inseparably interwoven until, the taste of men becoming"
1105,ON POETIC DICTION,"gradually perverted, this language was received as a natural language:"
1106,ON POETIC DICTION,"and at length, by the influence of books upon men, did to a certain"
1107,ON POETIC DICTION,degree really become so. Abuses of this kind were imported from one
1108,ON POETIC DICTION,"nation to another, and with the progress of refinement this diction"
1109,ON POETIC DICTION,"became daily more and more corrupt, thrusting out of sight the plain"
1110,ON POETIC DICTION,"humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks, quaintnesses,"
1111,ON POETIC DICTION,"hieroglyphics, and enigmas."
1112,ON POETIC DICTION,
1113,ON POETIC DICTION,It would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure
1114,ON POETIC DICTION,given by this extravagant and absurd diction. It depends upon a great
1115,ON POETIC DICTION,"variety of causes, but upon none, perhaps, more than its influence in"
1116,ON POETIC DICTION,impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet's
1117,ON POETIC DICTION,"character, and in flattering the Reader's self-love by bringing him"
1118,ON POETIC DICTION,nearer to a sympathy with that character; an effect which is
1119,ON POETIC DICTION,"accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking, and thus"
1120,ON POETIC DICTION,assisting the Reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of
1121,ON POETIC DICTION,"mind in which if he does not find himself, he imagines that he is"
1122,ON POETIC DICTION,_balked_ of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow.
1123,ON POETIC DICTION,
1124,ON POETIC DICTION,"The sonnet quoted from Gray, in the Preface, except the lines printed"
1125,ON POETIC DICTION,"in Italics, consists of little else but this diction, though not of"
1126,ON POETIC DICTION,"the worst kind; and indeed, if one may be permitted to say so, it is"
1127,ON POETIC DICTION,far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern. Perhaps in
1128,ON POETIC DICTION,"no way, by positive example, could more easily be given a notion of"
1129,ON POETIC DICTION,what I mean by the phrase _poetic diction_ than by referring to a
1130,ON POETIC DICTION,comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages
1131,ON POETIC DICTION,"in the Old and New Testament, and those passages as they exist in our"
1132,ON POETIC DICTION,common Translation. See Pope's 'Messiah' throughout; Prior's 'Did
1133,ON POETIC DICTION,"sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue,' &c. &c. 'Though I speak with"
1134,ON POETIC DICTION,"the tongues of men and of angels,' &c. &c. 1 Corinthians, chap. xiii."
1135,ON POETIC DICTION,By way of immediate example take the following of Dr. Johnson:--
1136,ON POETIC DICTION,
1137,ON POETIC DICTION,"Turn on the prudent Ant thy heedless eyes,"
1138,ON POETIC DICTION,"Observe her labours, Sluggard, and be wise;"
1139,ON POETIC DICTION,"No stern command, no monitory voice,"
1140,ON POETIC DICTION,"Prescribes her duties, or directs her choice;"
1141,ON POETIC DICTION,"Yet, timely provident, she hastes away"
1142,ON POETIC DICTION,To snatch the blessings of a plenteous day;
1143,ON POETIC DICTION,"When fruitful Summer loads the teeming plain,"
1144,ON POETIC DICTION,"She crops the harvest, and she stores the grain."
1145,ON POETIC DICTION,"How long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours,"
1146,ON POETIC DICTION,"Unnerve thy vigour, and enchain thy powers?"
1147,ON POETIC DICTION,"While artful shades thy downy couch enclose,"
1148,ON POETIC DICTION,"And soft solicitation courts repose,"
1149,ON POETIC DICTION,"Amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight,"
1150,ON POETIC DICTION,"Year chases year with unremitted flight,"
1151,ON POETIC DICTION,"Till Want now following, fraudulent and slow,"
1152,ON POETIC DICTION,"Shall spring to seize thee, like an ambush'd foe."
1153,ON POETIC DICTION,
1154,ON POETIC DICTION,"From this hubbub of words pass to the original. 'Go to the Ant, thou"
1155,ON POETIC DICTION,"Sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise: which having no guide,"
1156,ON POETIC DICTION,"overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth"
1157,ON POETIC DICTION,"her food in the harvest. How long wilt thou sleep, O Sluggard? when"
1158,ON POETIC DICTION,"wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little"
1159,ON POETIC DICTION,"slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty"

1162,ON POETIC DICTION,
1163,ON POETIC DICTION,"One more quotation, and I have done. It is from Cowper's _Verses"
1164,ON POETIC DICTION,supposed to be written by Alexander Selkirk_:
1165,ON POETIC DICTION,
1166,ON POETIC DICTION,Religion! what treasure untold
1167,ON POETIC DICTION,Resides in that heavenly word!
1168,ON POETIC DICTION,"More precious than silver and gold,"
1169,ON POETIC DICTION,Or all that this earth can afford.
1170,ON POETIC DICTION,But the sound of the church-going bell
1171,ON POETIC DICTION,"These valleys and rocks never heard,"
1172,ON POETIC DICTION,"Ne'er sighed at the sound of a knell,"
1173,ON POETIC DICTION,Or smiled when a sabbath appeared.
1174,ON POETIC DICTION,"Ye winds, that have made me your sport,"
1175,ON POETIC DICTION,Convey to this desolate shore
1176,ON POETIC DICTION,Some cordial endearing report
1177,ON POETIC DICTION,Of a land I must visit no more.
1178,ON POETIC DICTION,"My Friends, do they now and then send"
1179,ON POETIC DICTION,A wish or a thought after me?
1180,ON POETIC DICTION,"O tell me I yet have a friend,"
1181,ON POETIC DICTION,Though a friend I am never to see.
1182,ON POETIC DICTION,
1183,ON POETIC DICTION,This passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of
1184,ON POETIC DICTION,composition. The first four lines are poorly expressed; some Critics
1185,ON POETIC DICTION,"would call the language prosaic; the fact is, it would be bad prose,"
1186,ON POETIC DICTION,"so bad, that it is scarcely worse in metre. The epithet 'church-going'"
1187,ON POETIC DICTION,"applied to a bell, and that by so chaste a writer as Cowper, is an"
1188,ON POETIC DICTION,instance of the strange abuses which Poets have introduced into their
1189,ON POETIC DICTION,"language, till they and their Readers take them as matters of course,"
1190,ON POETIC DICTION,if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration. The
1191,ON POETIC DICTION,"two lines 'Ne'er sighed at the sound', &c., are, in my opinion, an"
1192,ON POETIC DICTION,"instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use, and,"
1193,ON POETIC DICTION,"from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre, applied"
1194,ON POETIC DICTION,upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions; and I
1195,ON POETIC DICTION,"should condemn the passage, though perhaps few Readers will agree with"
1196,ON POETIC DICTION,"me, as vicious poetic diction. The last stanza is throughout admirably"
1197,ON POETIC DICTION,"expressed: it would be equally good whether in prose or verse, except"
1198,ON POETIC DICTION,that the Reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural
1199,ON POETIC DICTION,language so naturally connected with metre. The beauty of this stanza
1200,ON POETIC DICTION,tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost
1201,ON POETIC DICTION,"sight of, and which has been my chief guide in all I have"
1202,ON POETIC DICTION,"said,--namely, that in works of _imagination and sentiment_, for of"
1203,ON POETIC DICTION,"these only have I been treating, in proportion as ideas and feelings"
1204,ON POETIC DICTION,"are valuable, whether the composition be in prose or in verse, they"
1205,ON POETIC DICTION,require and exact one and the same language. Metre is but adventitious
1206,ON POETIC DICTION,"to composition, and the phraseology for which that passport is"
1207,ON POETIC DICTION,"necessary, even where it may be graceful at all, will be little valued"
1208,ON POETIC DICTION,by the judicious.

1234,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"deserves all praise, both for the attempt and for the execution. The"
1235,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,provocations to this remonstrance in behalf of truth and nature were
1236,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,still of perpetual recurrence before and after the publication of this
1237,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"preface. I cannot likewise but add, that the comparison of such poems"
1238,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of merit, as have been given to the public within the last ten or"
1239,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"twelve years, with the majority of those produced previously to the"
1240,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"appearance of that preface, leave no doubt on my mind, that Mr."
1241,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Wordsworth is fully justified in believing his efforts to have been by
1242,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,no means ineffectual. Not only in the verses of those who have
1243,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"professed their admiration of his genius, but even of those who have"
1244,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"distinguished themselves by hostility to his theory, and depreciation"
1245,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of his writings, are the impressions of his principles plainly"
1246,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"visible. It is possible, that with these principles others may have"
1247,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"been blended, which are not equally evident; and some which are"
1248,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,unsteady and subvertible from the narrowness or imperfection of their
1249,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"basis. But it is more than possible, that these errors of defect or"
1250,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"exaggeration, by kindling and feeding the controversy, may have"
1251,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"conduced not only to the wider propagation of the accompanying truths,"
1252,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"but that, by their frequent presentation to the mind in an excited"
1253,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"state, they may have won for them a more permanent and practical"
1254,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"result. A man will borrow a part from his opponent the more easily, if"
1255,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,he feels himself justified in continuing to reject a part. While there
1256,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,remain important points in which he can still feel himself in the
1257,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"right, in which he still finds firm footing for continued resistance,"
1258,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"he will gradually adopt those opinions, which were the least remote"
1259,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"from his own convictions, as not less congruous with his own theory"
1260,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,than with that which he reprobates. In like manner with a kind of
1261,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"instinctive prudence, he will abandon by little and little his weakest"
1262,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"posts, till at length he seems to forget that they had ever belonged"
1263,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"to him, or affects to consider them at most as accidental and 'petty"
1264,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"annexments', the removal of which leaves the citadel unhurt and"
1265,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,unendangered.
1266,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1267,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,My own differences from certain supposed parts of Mr. Wordsworth's
1268,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"theory ground themselves on the assumption, that his words had been"
1269,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"rightly interpreted, as purporting that the proper diction for poetry"
1270,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"in general consists altogether in a language taken, with due"
1271,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"exceptions, from the mouths of men in real life, a language which"
1272,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,actually constitutes the natural conversation of men under the
1273,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"influence of natural feelings. My objection is, first, that in any"
1274,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,sense this rule is applicable only to certain classes of poetry;
1275,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"secondly, that even to these classes it is not applicable, except in"
1276,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"such a sense, as hath never by any one (as far as I know or have read)"
1277,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"been denied or doubted; and lastly, that as far as, and in that degree"
1278,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"in which it is practicable, yet as a rule it is useless, if not"
1279,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"injurious, and therefore either need not, or ought not to be"
1280,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,practised. The poet informs his reader that he had generally chosen
1281,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"low and rustic life; but not _as_ low and rustic, or in order to"
1282,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"repeat that pleasure of doubtful moral effect, which persons of"
1283,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,elevated rank and of superior refinement oftentimes derive from a
1284,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,happy imitation of the rude unpolished manners and discourse of their
1285,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,inferiors. For the pleasure so derived may be traced to three exciting
1286,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"causes. The first is the naturalness, in fact, of the things"
1287,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,represented. The second is the apparent naturalness of the
1288,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"representation, as raised and qualified by an imperceptible infusion"
1289,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of the author's own knowledge and talent, which infusion does, indeed,"
1290,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,constitute it an imitation as distinguished from a mere copy. The
1291,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,third cause may be found in the reader's conscious feeling of his
1292,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,superiority awakened by the contrast presented to him; even as for the
1293,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,same purpose the kings and great barons of yore retained sometimes
1294,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"actual clowns and fools, but more frequently shrewd and witty fellows"
1295,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"in that character. These, however, were not Mr. Wordsworth's objects."
1296,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"He chose low and rustic life, 'because in that condition the essential"
1297,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"passions of the heart find a better soil, in which they can attain"
1298,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer and more"
1299,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,emphatic language; because in that condition of life our elementary
1300,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity, and consequently"
1301,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"may be more accurately contemplated, and more forcibly communicated;"
1302,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary
1303,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,feelings; and from the necessary character of rural occupations are
1304,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"more easily comprehended, and are more durable; and lastly, because in"
1305,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,that condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful
1306,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,and permanent forms of nature.'
1307,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1308,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Now it is clear to me, that in the most interesting of the poems, in"
1309,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"which the author is more or less dramatic, as the _Brothers_,"
1310,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"_Michael_, _Ruth_, the _Mad Mother_, &c., the persons introduced are"
1311,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,by no means taken from low or rustic life in the common acceptation of
1312,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"those words; and it is not less clear, that the sentiments and"
1313,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language, as far as they can be conceived to have been really"
1314,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"transferred from the minds and conversation of such persons, are"
1315,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,attributable to causes and circumstances not necessarily connected
1316,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"with 'their occupations and abode'. The thoughts, feelings, language,"
1317,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,and manners of the shepherd-farmers in the vales of Cumberland and
1318,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Westmoreland, as far as they are actually adopted in those poems, may"
1319,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"be accounted for from causes, which will and do produce the same"
1320,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"results in every state of life, whether in town or country. As the two"
1321,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"principal I rank that INDEPENDENCE, which raises a man above"
1322,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"servitude, or daily toil for the profit of others, yet not above the"
1323,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,necessity of industry and a frugal simplicity of domestic life; and
1324,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the accompanying unambitious, but solid and religious, EDUCATION,"
1325,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"which has rendered few books familiar, but the Bible, and the liturgy"
1326,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"or hymnbook. To the latter cause, indeed, which is so far accidental,"
1327,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"that it is the blessing of particular countries and a particular age,"
1328,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"not the product of particular places or employments, the poet owes the"
1329,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"show of probability, that his personages might really feel, think, and"
1330,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,talk with any tolerable resemblance to his representation. It is an
1331,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,excellent remark of Dr. Henry More's that 'a man of confined
1332,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"education, but of good parts, by constant reading of the Bible will"
1333,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,naturally form a more winning and commanding rhetoric than those that
1334,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,are learned: the intermixture of tongues and of artificial phrases
1335,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,debasing their style'.
1336,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1337,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"It is, moreover, to be considered that to the formation of healthy"
1338,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"feelings, and a reflecting mind, negations involve impediments not"
1339,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,less formidable than sophistication and vicious intermixture. I am
1340,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"convinced, that for the human soul to prosper in rustic life a certain"
1341,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,vantage-ground is pre-requisite. It is not every man that is likely to
1342,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"be improved by a country life or by country labours. Education, or"
1343,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"original sensibility, or both, must pre-exist, if the changes, forms,"
1344,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,and incidents of nature are to prove a sufficient stimulant. And where
1345,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"these are not sufficient, the mind contracts and hardens by want of"
1346,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"stimulants: and the man becomes selfish, sensual, gross, and"
1347,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"hard-hearted. Let the management of the POOR LAWS in Liverpool,"
1348,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Manchester, or Bristol be compared with the ordinary dispensation of"
1349,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the poor rates in agricultural villages, where the farmers are the"
1350,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,overseers and guardians of the poor. If my own experience have not
1351,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"been particularly unfortunate, as well as that of the many respectable"
1352,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"country clergymen with whom I have conversed on the subject, the"
1353,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,result would engender more than scepticism concerning the desirable
1354,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,influences of low and rustic life in and for itself. Whatever may be
1355,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"concluded on the other side, from the stronger local attachments and"
1356,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"enterprising spirit of the Swiss, and other mountaineers, applies to a"
1357,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"particular mode of pastoral life, under forms of property that permit"
1358,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"and beget manners truly republican, not to rustic life in general, or"
1359,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,to the absence of artificial cultivation. On the contrary the
1360,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"mountaineers, whose manners have been so often eulogized, are in"
1361,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,general better educated and greater readers than men of equal rank
1362,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"elsewhere. But where this is not the case, as among the peasantry of"
1363,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"North Wales, the ancient mountains, with all their terrors and all"
1364,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"their glories, are pictures to the blind, and music to the deaf."
1365,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1366,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"I should not have entered so much into detail upon this passage, but"
1367,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"here seems to be the point, to which all the lines of difference"
1368,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"converge as to their source and centre;--I mean, as far as, and in"
1369,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"whatever respect, my poetic creed does differ from the doctrines"
1370,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,promulgated in this preface. I adopt with full faith the principle of
1371,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Aristotle, that poetry, as poetry, is essentially ideal, that it"
1372,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,avoids and excludes all accident; that its apparent individualities
1373,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of rank, character, or occupation must be representative of a class;"
1374,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,and that the persons of poetry must be clothed with generic
1375,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"attributes, with the common attributes of the class: not with such as"
1376,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"one gifted individual might possibly possess, but such as from his"
1377,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,situation it is most probable beforehand that he would possess. If my
1378,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"premises are right and my deductions legitimate, it follows that there"
1379,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,can be no poetic medium between the swains of Theocritus and those of
1380,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,an imaginary golden age.
1381,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1382,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,The characters of the vicar and the shepherd-mariner in the poem of
1383,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"_The Brothers_, that of the shepherd of Green-head Ghyll in the"
1384,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"_Michael_, have all the verisimilitude and representative quality,"
1385,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,that the purposes of poetry can require. They are persons of a known
1386,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"and abiding class, and their manners and sentiments the natural"
1387,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,product of circumstances common to the class. Take Michael for
1388,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,instance:
1389,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1390,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"An old man stout of heart, and strong of limb:"
1391,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
1392,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,"
1393,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,"
1394,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
1395,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,And watchful more than ordinary men.
1396,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Hence he had learned the meaning of all winds,"
1397,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes
1398,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"When others heeded not, he heard the South"
1399,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Make subterraneous music, like the noise"
1400,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.
1401,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"The shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
1402,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
1403,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,The winds are now devising work for me!
1404,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And truly at all times the storm, that drives"
1405,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"The traveller to a shelter, summon'd him"
1406,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Up to the mountains. He had been alone
1407,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
1408,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,That came to him and left him on the heights.
1409,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"So liv'd he, until his eightieth year was pass'd."
1410,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
1411,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
1412,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts.
1413,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Fields, where with chearful spirits he had breath'd"
1414,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"The common air; the hills, which he so oft"
1415,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Had climb'd with vigorous steps; which had impress'd
1416,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,So many incidents upon his mind
1417,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
1418,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Which, like a book, preserved the memory"
1419,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Of the dumb animals, whom he had sav'd,"
1420,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Had fed or shelter'd, linking to such acts,"
1421,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"So grateful in themselves, the certainty"
1422,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Of honourable gain; these fields, these hills"
1423,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Which were his living being, even more"
1424,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Than his own blood--what could they less? had laid
1425,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Strong hold on his affections, were to him"
1426,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,A pleasureable feeling of blind love.
1427,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,The pleasure which there is in life itself.
1428,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1429,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"On the other hand, in the poems which are pitched at a lower note, as"
1430,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the _Harry Gill_, _Idiot Boy_, the feelings are those of human nature"
1431,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,in general; though the poet has judiciously laid the scene in the
1432,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"country, in order to place himself in the vicinity of interesting"
1433,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"images, without the necessity of ascribing a sentimental perception of"
1434,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"their beauty to the persons of his drama. In _The Idiot Boy_, indeed,"
1435,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,the mother's character is not so much a real and native product of a
1436,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,'situation where the essential passions of the heart find a better
1437,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"soil, in which they can attain their maturity and speak a plainer and"
1438,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"more emphatic language', as it is an impersonation of an instinct"
1439,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,abandoned by judgement. Hence the two following charges seem to me not
1440,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"wholly groundless: at least, they are the only plausible objections,"
1441,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"which I have heard to that fine poem. The one is, that the author has"
1442,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"not, in the poem itself, taken sufficient care to preclude from the"
1443,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"reader's fancy the disgusting images of ordinary morbid idiocy, which"
1444,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,yet it was by no means his intention to represent. He has even by the
1445,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"'burr, burr, burr', uncounteracted by any preceding description of the"
1446,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"boy's beauty, assisted in recalling them. The other is, that the"
1447,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"idiocy of the boy is so evenly balanced by the folly of the mother, as"
1448,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,to present to the general reader rather a laughable burlesque on the
1449,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"blindness of anile dotage, than an analytic display of maternal"
1450,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,affection in its ordinary workings.
1451,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1452,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"In _The Thorn_, the poet himself acknowledges in a note the necessity"
1453,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of an introductory poem, in which he should have portrayed the"
1454,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,character of the person from whom the words of the poem are supposed
1455,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"to proceed: a superstitious man moderately imaginative, of slow"
1456,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"faculties and deep feelings, 'a captain of a small trading vessel, for"
1457,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"example, who, being past the middle age of life, had retired upon an"
1458,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"annuity, or small independent income, to some village or country town"
1459,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been accustomed"
1460,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,to live. Such men having nothing to do become credulous and talkative
1461,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"from indolence'. But in a poem, still more in a lyric poem--and the"
1462,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Nurse in Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_ alone prevents me from
1463,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"extending the remark even to dramatic poetry, if indeed even the Nurse"
1464,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,itself can be deemed altogether a case in point--it is not possible to
1465,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"imitate truly a dull and garrulous discourser, without repeating the"
1466,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"effects of dullness and garrulity. However this may be, I dare assert,"
1467,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,that the parts--(and these form the far larger portion of the
1468,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,whole)--which might as well or still better have proceeded from the
1469,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"poet's own imagination, and have been spoken in his own character, are"
1470,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"those which have given, and which will continue to give, universal"
1471,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,delight; and that the passages exclusively appropriate to the supposed
1472,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"narrator, such as the last couplet of the third stanza;[3] the seven"
1473,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"last lines of the tenth;[4] and the five following stanzas, with the"
1474,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,exception of the four admirable lines at the commencement of the
1475,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"fourteenth, are felt by many unprejudiced and unsophisticated hearts,"
1476,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,as sudden and unpleasant sinkings from the height to which the poet
1477,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"had previously lifted them, and to which he again re-elevates both"
1478,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,himself and his reader.
1479,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1480,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,[3]
1481,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1482,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,I've measured it from side to side;

1486,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1487,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Nay, rack your brain--'tis all in vain,"
1488,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,I'll tell you every thing I know;
1489,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"But to the Thorn, and to the Pond"
1490,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Which is a little step beyond,"
1491,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,I wish that you would go:
1492,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Perhaps, when you are at the place,"
1493,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,You something of her tale may trace.
1494,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1495,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,I'll give you the best help I can:
1496,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Before you up the mountain go,"
1497,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Up to the dreary mountain-top,"
1498,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,I'll tell you all I know.
1499,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,'Tis now some two-and-twenty years
1500,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Since she (her name is Martha Ray)
1501,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Gave, with a maiden's true good will,"
1502,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Her company to Stephen Hill;
1503,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And she was blithe and gay,"
1504,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And she was happy, happy still"
1505,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Whene'er she thought of Stephen Hill.
1506,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1507,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And they had fix'd the wedding-day,"
1508,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,The morning that must wed them both;
1509,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,But Stephen to another maid
1510,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Had sworn another oath;
1511,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And, with this other maid, to church"
1512,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Unthinking Stephen went--
1513,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Poor Martha! on that woeful day
1514,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,A pang of pitiless dismay
1515,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Into her soul was sent;
1516,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"A fire was kindled in her breast,"
1517,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Which might not burn itself to rest.
1518,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1519,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"They say, full six months after this,"
1520,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"While yet the summer leaves were green,"

1537,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Old farmer Simpson did maintain,"

1543,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1544,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"No more I know, I wish I did,"
1545,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,And I would tell it all to you:
1546,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,For what became of this poor child
1547,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,There's none that ever knew:
1548,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And if a child was born or no,"
1549,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,There's no one that could ever tell;
1550,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And if 'twas born alive or dead,"
1551,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"There's no one knows, as I have said:"
1552,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"But some remember well,"
1553,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,That Martha Ray about this time
1554,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Would up the mountain often climb.
1555,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1556,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"If then I am compelled to doubt the theory, by which the choice of"
1557,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"characters was to be directed, not only _à priori_, from grounds of"
1558,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"reason, but both from the few instances in which the poet himself need"
1559,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"be supposed to have been governed by it, and from the comparative"
1560,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,inferiority of those instances; still more must I hesitate in my
1561,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,assent to the sentence which immediately follows the former citation;
1562,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"and which I can neither admit as particular fact, nor as general rule."
1563,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"'The language, too, of these men is adopted (purified indeed from what"
1564,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"appear to be its real defects, from all lasting and rational causes of"
1565,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,dislike or disgust) because such men hourly communicate with the best
1566,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,objects from which the best part of language is originally derived;
1567,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"and because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow"
1568,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"circle of their intercourse, being less under the action of social"
1569,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"vanity, they convey their feelings and notions in simple and"
1570,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"unelaborated expressions.' To this I reply; that a rustic's language,"
1571,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"purified from all provincialism and grossness, and so far"
1572,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,reconstructed as to be made consistent with the rules of
1573,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,grammar--(which are in essence no other than the laws of universal
1574,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"logic, applied to psychological materials)--will not differ from the"
1575,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language of any other man of common sense, however learned or refined"
1576,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"he may be, except as far as the notions, which the rustic has to"
1577,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"convey, are fewer and more indiscriminate. This will become still"
1578,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"clearer, if we add the consideration--(equally important though less"
1579,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"obvious)--that the rustic, from the more imperfect development of his"
1580,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"faculties, and from the lower state of their cultivation, aims almost"
1581,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"solely to convey insulated facts, either those of his scanty"
1582,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,experience or his traditional belief; while the educated man chiefly
1583,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"seeks to discover and express those connexions of things, or those"
1584,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"relative bearings of fact to fact, from which some more or less"
1585,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"general law is deducible. For facts are valuable to a wise man,"
1586,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"chiefly as they lead to the discovery of the indwelling law, which is"
1587,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the true being of things, the sole solution of their modes of"
1588,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"existence, and in the knowledge of which consists our dignity and our"
1589,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,power.
1590,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1591,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"As little can I agree with the assertion, that from the objects with"
1592,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,which the rustic hourly communicates the best part of language is
1593,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"formed. For first, if to communicate with an object implies such an"
1594,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"acquaintance with it, as renders it capable of being discriminately"
1595,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,reflected on; the distinct knowledge of an uneducated rustic would
1596,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,furnish a very scanty vocabulary. The few things and modes of action
1597,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,requisite for his bodily conveniences would alone be individualized;
1598,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,while all the rest of nature would be expressed by a small number of
1599,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"confused general terms. Secondly, I deny that the words and"
1600,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"combinations of words derived from the objects, with which the rustic"
1601,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"is familiar, whether with distinct or confused knowledge, can be"
1602,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,justly said to form the best part of language. It is more than
1603,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"probable, that many classes of the brute creation possess"
1604,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"discriminating sounds, by which they can convey to each other notices"
1605,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of such objects as concern their food, shelter, or safety. Yet we"
1606,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"hesitate to call the aggregate of such sounds a language, otherwise"
1607,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"than metaphorically. The best part of human language, properly so"
1608,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"called, is derived from reflection on the acts of the mind itself. It"
1609,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,is formed by a voluntary appropriation of fixed symbols to internal
1610,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"acts, to processes and results of imagination, the greater part of"
1611,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,which have no place in the consciousness of uneducated man; though in
1612,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"civilized society, by imitation and passive remembrance of what they"
1613,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"hear from their religious instructors and other superiors, the most"
1614,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,uneducated share in the harvest which they neither sowed nor reaped.
1615,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,If the history of the phrases in hourly currency among our peasants
1616,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"were traced, a person not previously aware of the fact would be"
1617,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"surprised at finding so large a number, which three or four centuries"
1618,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,ago were the exclusive property of the universities and the schools;
1619,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"and, at the commencement of the Reformation, had been transferred from"
1620,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the school to the pulpit, and thus gradually passed into common life."
1621,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"The extreme difficulty, and often the impossibility, of finding words"
1622,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,for the simplest moral and intellectual processes of the languages of
1623,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,uncivilized tribes has proved perhaps the weightiest obstacle to the
1624,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,progress of our most zealous and adroit missionaries. Yet these tribes
1625,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,are surrounded by the same nature as our peasants are; but in still
1626,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"more impressive forms; and they are, moreover, obliged to"
1627,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"particularize many more of them. When, therefore, Mr. Wordsworth adds,"
1628,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"'accordingly, such a language'--(meaning, as before, the language of"
1629,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,rustic life purified from provincialism)--'arising out of repeated
1630,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"experience and regular feelings, is a more permanent, and a far more"
1631,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"philosophical language, than that which is frequently substituted for"
1632,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"it by poets, who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves"
1633,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,and their art in proportion as they indulge in arbitrary and
1634,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"capricious habits of expression;' it may be answered, that the"
1635,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language, which he has in view, can be attributed to rustics with no"
1636,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"greater right, than the style of Hooker or Bacon to Tom Brown or Sir"
1637,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Roger L'Estrange. Doubtless, if what is peculiar to each were omitted"
1638,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"in each, the result must needs be the same. Further, that the poet,"
1639,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"who uses an illogical diction, or a style fitted to excite only the"
1640,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"low and changeable pleasure of wonder by means of groundless novelty,"
1641,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"substitutes a language of folly and vanity, not for that of the"
1642,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"rustic, but for that of good sense and natural feeling."
1643,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1644,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"Here let me be permitted to remind the reader, that the positions,"
1645,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"which I controvert, are contained in the sentences--'_a selection of"
1646,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,the_ REAL _language of men_';--'_the language of these men_' (i. e.
1647,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"men in low and rustic life) '_I propose to myself to imitate, and, as"
1648,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"far as is possible, to adopt the very language of men._' '_Between the"
1649,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language of prose and that of metrical composition, there neither is,"
1650,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"nor can be, any essential difference._' It is against these"
1651,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,exclusively that my opposition is directed.
1652,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1653,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"I object, in the very first instance, to an equivocation in the use of"
1654,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the word 'real'. Every man's language varies, according to the extent"
1655,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of his knowledge, the activity of his faculties, and the depth or"
1656,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"quickness of his feelings. Every man's language has, first, its"
1657,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"individualities; secondly, the common properties of the class to which"
1658,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"he belongs; and thirdly, words and phrases of universal use. The"
1659,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language of Hooker, Bacon, Bishop Taylor, and Burke differs from the"
1660,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,common language of the learned class only by the superior number and
1661,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,novelty of the thoughts and relations which they had to convey. The
1662,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language of Algernon Sidney differs not at all from that, which every"
1663,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"well-educated gentleman would wish to write, and (with due allowance"
1664,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"for the undeliberateness, and less connected train, of thinking"
1665,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,natural and proper to conversation) such as he would wish to talk.
1666,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Neither one nor the other differ half so much from the general
1667,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"language of cultivated society, as the language of Mr. Wordsworth's"
1668,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,homeliest composition differs from that of a common peasant. For
1669,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"'real' therefore, we must substitute ordinary, or _lingua communis_."
1670,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"And this, we have proved, is no more to be found in the phraseology of"
1671,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,low and rustic life than in that of any other class. Omit the
1672,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,peculiarities of each and the result of course must be common to all.
1673,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,And assuredly the omissions and changes to be made in the language of
1674,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"rustics, before it could be transferred to any species of poem, except"
1675,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the drama or other professed imitation, are at least as numerous and"
1676,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"weighty, as would be required in adapting to the same purpose the"
1677,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"ordinary language of tradesmen and manufacturers. Not to mention, that"
1678,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,the language so highly extolled by Mr. Wordsworth varies in every
1679,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"county, nay in every village, according to the accidental character of"
1680,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the clergyman, the existence or non-existence of schools; or even,"
1681,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"perhaps, as the exciseman, publican, and barber happen to be, or not"
1682,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"to be, zealous politicians, and readers of the weekly newspaper _pro"
1683,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,bono publico_. Anterior to cultivation the _lingua communis_ of every
1684,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"country, as Dante has well observed, exists everywhere in parts, and"
1685,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,nowhere as a whole.
1686,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,
1687,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Neither is the case rendered at all more tenable by the addition of
1688,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"the words, _in a state of excitement_. For the nature of a man's"
1689,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"words, where he is strongly affected by joy, grief, or anger, must"
1690,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"necessarily depend on the number and quality of the general truths,"
1691,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"conceptions and images, and of the words expressing them, with which"
1692,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,his mind had been previously stored. For the property of passion is
1693,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"not to create; but to set in increased activity. At least, whatever"
1694,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"new connexions of thoughts or images, or (which is equally, if not"
1695,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"more than equally, the appropriate effect of strong excitement)"
1696,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,whatever generalizations of truth or experience the heat of passion
1697,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,may produce; yet the terms of their conveyance must have pre-existed
1698,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"in his former conversations, and are only collected and crowded"
1699,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,together by the unusual stimulation. It is indeed very possible to
1700,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"adopt in a poem the unmeaning repetitions, habitual phrases, and other"
1701,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"blank counters, which an unfurnished or confused understanding"
1702,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"interposes at short intervals, in order to keep hold of his subject,"
1703,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"which is still slipping from him, and to give him time for"
1704,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"recollection; or, in mere aid of vacancy, as in the scanty companies"
1705,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of a country stage the same player pops backwards and forwards, in"
1706,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"order to prevent the appearance of empty spaces, in the procession of"
1707,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"_Macbeth_, or _Henry VIII_. But what assistance to the poet, or"
1708,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"ornament to the poem, these can supply, I am at a loss to conjecture."
1709,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,Nothing assuredly can differ either in origin or in mode more widely
1710,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"from the apparent tautologies of intense and turbulent feeling, in"
1711,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,which the passion is greater and of longer endurance than to be
1712,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,exhausted or satisfied by a single representation of the image or
1713,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,incident exciting it. Such repetitions I admit to be a beauty of the
1714,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,highest kind; as illustrated by Mr. Wordsworth himself from the song
1715,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"of Deborah. _At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet"
1716,WORDSWORTH'S THEORY OF DICTION,"he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead._"

1723,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I conclude, therefore, that the attempt is impracticable; and that,"
1724,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"were it not impracticable, it would still be useless. For the very"
1725,METRICAL COMPOSITION,power of making the selection implies the previous possession of the
1726,METRICAL COMPOSITION,language selected. Or where can the poet have lived? And by what rules
1727,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"could he direct his choice, which would not have enabled him to select"
1728,METRICAL COMPOSITION,and arrange his words by the light of his own judgement? We do not
1729,METRICAL COMPOSITION,adopt the language of a class by the mere adoption of such words
1730,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"exclusively, as that class would use, or at least understand; but"
1731,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"likewise by following the order, in which the words of such men are"
1732,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"wont to succeed each other. Now this order, in the intercourse of"
1733,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"uneducated men, is distinguished from the diction of their superiors"
1734,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in knowledge and power, by the greater disjunction and separation in"
1735,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the component parts of that, whatever it be, which they wish to"

1737,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"surview, which enables a man to foresee the whole of what he is to"
1738,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"convey, appertaining to any one point; and by this means so to"

1740,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"relative importance, as to convey it at once, and as an organized"

1743,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Now I will take the first stanza, on which I have chanced to open, in"

1746,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1747,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"In distant countries have I been,"
1748,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And yet I have not often seen
1749,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"A healthy man, a man full grown,"
1750,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Weep in the public roads, alone."
1751,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"But such a one, on English ground,"
1752,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And in the broad highway, I met;"
1753,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Along the broad highway he came,"
1754,METRICAL COMPOSITION,His cheeks with tears were wet:
1755,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Sturdy he seem'd, though he was sad;"
1756,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And in his arms a lamb he had.
1757,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1758,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The words here are doubtless such as are current in all ranks of life;
1759,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and of course not less so in the hamlet and cottage than in the shop,"
1760,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"manufactory, college, or palace. But is this the order, in which the"
1761,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"rustic would have placed the words? I am grievously deceived, if the"
1762,METRICAL COMPOSITION,following less compact mode of commencing the same tale be not a far
1763,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"more faithful copy. 'I have been in a many parts, far and near, and I"
1764,METRICAL COMPOSITION,don't know that I ever saw before a man crying by himself in the
1765,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"public road; a grown man I mean, that was neither sick nor hurt,' &c.,"
1766,METRICAL COMPOSITION,&c. But when I turn to the following stanza in _The Thorn_:
1767,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1768,METRICAL COMPOSITION,At all times of the day and night
1769,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"This wretched woman thither goes,"
1770,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And she is known to every star,"
1771,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And every wind that blows:
1772,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And there, beside the thorn, she sits,"
1773,METRICAL COMPOSITION,When the blue day-light's in the skies:
1774,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And when the whirlwind's on the hill,"
1775,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Or frosty air is keen and still;
1776,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And to herself she cries,"
1777,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Oh misery! Oh misery!
1778,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Oh woe is me! Oh misery!
1779,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1780,METRICAL COMPOSITION,and compare this with the language of ordinary men; or with that which
1781,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I can conceive at all likely to proceed, in real life, from such a"
1782,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"narrator, as is supposed in the note to the poem; compare it either in"
1783,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the succession of the images or of the sentences; I am reminded of the
1784,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"sublime prayer and hymn of praise, which MILTON, in opposition to an"
1785,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"established liturgy, presents as a fair specimen of common extemporary"
1786,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"devotion, and such as we might expect to hear from every self-inspired"
1787,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"minister of a conventicle! And I reflect with delight, how little a"
1788,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"mere theory, though of his own workmanship, interferes with the"
1789,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"processes of genuine imagination in a man of true poetic genius, who"
1790,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"possesses, as Mr. Wordsworth, if ever man did, most assuredly does"

1797,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"One point then alone remains, but that the most important; its"
1798,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"examination having been, indeed, my chief inducement for the preceding"
1799,METRICAL COMPOSITION,inquisition. '_There neither is nor can be any essential difference
1800,METRICAL COMPOSITION,between the language of prose and metrical composition._' Such is Mr.
1801,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Wordsworth's assertion. Now prose itself, at least in all"
1802,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"argumentative and consecutive works, differs, and ought to differ,"
1803,METRICAL COMPOSITION,from the language of conversation; even as reading ought to differ
1804,METRICAL COMPOSITION,from talking. Unless therefore the difference denied be that of the
1805,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"mere words, as materials common to all styles of writing, and not of"
1806,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the style itself in the universally admitted sense of the term, it"
1807,METRICAL COMPOSITION,might be naturally presumed that there must exist a still greater
1808,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"between the ordonnance of poetic composition and that of prose, than"
1809,METRICAL COMPOSITION,is expected to distinguish prose from ordinary conversation.
1810,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1811,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"There are not, indeed, examples wanting in the history of literature,"
1812,METRICAL COMPOSITION,of apparent paradoxes that have summoned the public wonder as new and
1813,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"startling truths, but which, on examination, have shrunk into tame and"
1814,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"harmless truisms; as the eyes of a cat, seen in the dark, have been"
1815,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"mistaken for flames of fire. But Mr. Wordsworth is among the last men,"
1816,METRICAL COMPOSITION,to whom a delusion of this kind would be attributed by any one who had
1817,METRICAL COMPOSITION,enjoyed the slightest opportunity of understanding his mind and
1818,METRICAL COMPOSITION,character. Where an objection has been anticipated by such an author
1819,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"as natural, his answer to it must needs be interpreted in some sense"
1820,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which either is, or has been, or is capable of being controverted. My"
1821,METRICAL COMPOSITION,object then must be to discover some other meaning for the term
1822,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"'_essential difference_' in this place, exclusive of the indistinction"
1823,METRICAL COMPOSITION,and community of the words themselves. For whether there ought to
1824,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"exist a class of words in the English, in any degree resembling the"
1825,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poetic dialect of the Greek and Italian, is a question of very"
1826,METRICAL COMPOSITION,subordinate importance. The number of such words would be small
1827,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"indeed, in our language; and even in the Italian and Greek, they"
1828,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"consist not so much of different words, as of slight differences in"
1829,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the forms of declining and conjugating the same words; forms,"
1830,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"doubtless, which having been, at some period more or less remote, the"
1831,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"common grammatic flexions of some tribe or province, had been"
1832,METRICAL COMPOSITION,accidentally appropriated to poetry by the general admiration of
1833,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"certain master intellects, the first established lights of"
1834,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"inspiration, to whom that dialect happened to be native."
1835,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1836,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Essence, in its primary signification, means the principle of"
1837,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"individuation, the inmost principle of the possibility of any thing,"
1838,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"as that particular thing. It is equivalent to the idea of a thing,"
1839,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"whenever we use the word, idea, with philosophic precision. Existence,"
1840,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"on the other hand, is distinguished from essence, by the"
1841,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"superinduction of reality. Thus we speak of the essence, and essential"
1842,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"properties of a circle; but we do not therefore assert, that any"
1843,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"thing, which really exists, is mathematically circular. Thus too,"
1844,METRICAL COMPOSITION,without any tautology we contend for the existence of the Supreme
1845,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Being; that is, for a reality correspondent to the idea. There is,"
1846,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"next, a secondary use of the word essence, in which it signifies the"
1847,METRICAL COMPOSITION,point or ground of contradistinction between two modifications of the
1848,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"same substance or subject. Thus we should be allowed to say, that the"
1849,METRICAL COMPOSITION,style of architecture of Westminster Abbey is essentially different
1850,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"from that of St. Paul's, even though both had been built with blocks"
1851,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"cut into the same form, and from the same quarry. Only in this latter"
1852,METRICAL COMPOSITION,sense of the term must it have been denied by Mr. Wordsworth (for in
1853,METRICAL COMPOSITION,this sense alone is it affirmed by the general opinion) that the
1854,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"language of poetry (i. e. the formal construction, or architecture, of"
1855,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the words and phrases) is essentially different from that of prose.
1856,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Now the burthen of the proof lies with the oppugner, not with the"
1857,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"supporters of the common belief. Mr. Wordsworth, in consequence,"
1858,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"assigns as the proof of his position, 'that not only the language of a"
1859,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"large portion of every good poem, even of the most elevated character,"
1860,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"must necessarily, except with reference to the metre, in no respect"
1861,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the most"
1862,METRICAL COMPOSITION,interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the
1863,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"language of prose, when prose is well written. The truth of this"
1864,METRICAL COMPOSITION,assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost
1865,METRICAL COMPOSITION,all the poetical writings even of Milton himself.' He then quotes
1866,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Gray's sonnet:--
1867,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1868,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,"
1869,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;
1870,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"The birds in vain their amorous descant join,"
1871,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.
1872,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"These ears, alas! for other notes repine;"
1873,METRICAL COMPOSITION,_A different object do these eyes require;
1874,METRICAL COMPOSITION,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
1875,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And in my breast the imperfect joys expire._
1876,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,"
1877,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And newborn pleasure brings to happier men;
1878,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"The fields to all their wonted tribute bear,"
1879,METRICAL COMPOSITION,To warm their little loves the birds complain.
1880,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"_I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,"
1881,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And weep the more because I weep in vain_,"
1882,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1883,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and adds the following remark:--'It will easily be perceived, that the"
1884,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"only part of this Sonnet, which is of any value, is the lines printed"
1885,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in italics. It is equally obvious, that, except in the rhyme, and in"
1886,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the use of the single word ""fruitless"" for ""fruitlessly"", which is so"
1887,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"far a defect, the language of these lines does in no respect differ"
1888,METRICAL COMPOSITION,from that of prose.'
1889,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1890,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"An idealist defending his system by the fact, that when asleep we"
1891,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"often believe ourselves awake, was well answered by his plain"
1892,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"neighbour, 'Ah, but when awake do we ever believe ourselves"
1893,METRICAL COMPOSITION,asleep?'--Things identical must be convertible. The preceding passage
1894,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"seems to rest on a similar sophism. For the question is not, whether"
1895,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"there may not occur in prose an order of words, which would be equally"
1896,METRICAL COMPOSITION,proper in a poem; nor whether there are not beautiful lines and
1897,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"sentences of frequent occurrence in good poems, which would be equally"
1898,METRICAL COMPOSITION,becoming as well as beautiful in good prose; for neither the one nor
1899,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the other has ever been either denied or doubted by any one. The true
1900,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"question must be, whether there are not modes of expression, a"
1901,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"construction, and an order of sentences, which are in their fit and"
1902,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"natural place in a serious prose composition, but would be"
1903,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry; and, vice"
1904,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"versa, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be an"
1905,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"arrangement both of words and sentences, and a use and selection of"
1906,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"(what are called) _figures of speech_, both as to their kind, their"
1907,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject of equal weight"
1908,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"would be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend, that"
1909,METRICAL COMPOSITION,in both cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other
1910,METRICAL COMPOSITION,frequently will and ought to exist.
1911,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1912,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And first from the origin of metre. This I would trace to the balance
1913,METRICAL COMPOSITION,in the mind effected by that spontaneous effort which strives to hold
1914,METRICAL COMPOSITION,in check the workings of passion. It might be easily explained
1915,METRICAL COMPOSITION,likewise in what manner this salutary antagonism is assisted by the
1916,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"very state, which it counteracts; and how this balance of antagonists"
1917,METRICAL COMPOSITION,became organized into metre (in the usual acceptation of that term) by
1918,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"a supervening act of the will and judgement, consciously and for the"
1919,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"foreseen purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles, as the data"
1920,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of our argument, we deduce from them two legitimate conditions, which"
1921,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work. First, that,"
1922,METRICAL COMPOSITION,as the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of increased
1923,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"excitement, so the metre itself should be accompanied by the natural"
1924,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"language of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements are formed"
1925,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"into metre artificially, by a voluntary act, with the design and for"
1926,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the purpose of blending delight with emotion, so the traces of present"
1927,METRICAL COMPOSITION,volition should throughout the metrical language be proportionately
1928,METRICAL COMPOSITION,discernible. Now these two conditions must be reconciled and
1929,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"co-present. There must be not only a partnership, but a union; an"
1930,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"interpenetration of passion and of will, of spontaneous impulse and of"
1931,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"voluntary purpose. Again, this union can be manifested only in a"
1932,METRICAL COMPOSITION,frequency of forms and figures of speech (originally the offspring of
1933,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"passion, but now the adopted children of power), greater than would be"
1934,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"desired or endured, where the emotion is not voluntarily encouraged"
1935,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and kept up for the sake of that pleasure, which such emotion, so"
1936,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"tempered and mastered by the will, is found capable of communicating."
1937,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"It not only dictates, but of itself tends to produce, a more frequent"
1938,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"employment of picturesque and vivifying language, than would be"
1939,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"natural in any other case, in which there did not exist, as there does"
1940,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in the present, a previous and well understood, though tacit,"
1941,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"_compact_ between the poet and his reader, that the latter is entitled"
1942,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"to expect, and the former bound to supply, this species and degree of"
1943,METRICAL COMPOSITION,pleasurable excitement. We may in some measure apply to this union the
1944,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"answer of POLIXENES, in the _Winter's Tale_, to PERDITA'S neglect of"
1945,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the streaked gilly-flowers, because she had heard it said:"
1946,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1947,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"There is an art which, in their piedness, shares"
1948,METRICAL COMPOSITION,With great creating nature.
1949,METRICAL COMPOSITION,_Pol._ Say there be;
1950,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Yet nature is made better by no mean,"
1951,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"But nature makes that mean; so, ev'n that art,"
1952,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art,"
1953,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
1954,METRICAL COMPOSITION,_A gentler scion to the wildest stock;_
1955,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And make conceive a bark of ruder kind
1956,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"By bud of nobler race. This is an art,"
1957,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Which does mend nature--change it rather; but
1958,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The art itself is nature.
1959,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1960,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Secondly, I argue from the EFFECTS of metre. As far as metre acts in"
1961,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and for itself, it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility"
1962,METRICAL COMPOSITION,both of the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it
1963,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"produces by the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick"
1964,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"reciprocations of curiosity still gratified and still re-excited,"
1965,METRICAL COMPOSITION,which are too slight indeed to be at any one moment objects of
1966,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"distinct consciousness, yet become considerable in their aggregate"
1967,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"influence. As a medicated atmosphere, or as wine during animated"
1968,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"conversation, they act powerfully, though themselves unnoticed. Where,"
1969,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"therefore, correspondent food and appropriate matter are not provided"
1970,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"for the attention and feelings thus roused, there must needs be a"
1971,METRICAL COMPOSITION,disappointment felt; like that of leaping in the dark from the last
1972,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"step of a staircase, when we had prepared our muscles for a leap of"
1973,METRICAL COMPOSITION,three or four.
1974,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1975,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The discussion on the powers of metre in the preface is highly
1976,METRICAL COMPOSITION,ingenious and touches at all points on truth. But I cannot find any
1977,METRICAL COMPOSITION,statement of its powers considered abstractly and separately. On the
1978,METRICAL COMPOSITION,contrary Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers
1979,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which it exerts during (and, as I think, in consequence of) its"
1980,METRICAL COMPOSITION,combination with other elements of poetry. Thus the previous
1981,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"difficulty is left unanswered, what the elements are with which it"
1982,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"must be combined, in order to produce its own effects to any"
1983,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"pleasureable purpose. Double and tri-syllable rhymes, indeed, form a"
1984,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"lower species of wit, and, attended to exclusively for their own sake,"
1985,METRICAL COMPOSITION,may become a source of momentary amusement; as in poor Smart's distich
1986,METRICAL COMPOSITION,to the Welsh Squire who had promised him a hare:
1987,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1988,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Tell me, thou son of great Cadwallader!"
1989,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Hast sent the hare? or hast thou swallowed her?
1990,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1991,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"But for any poetic purposes, metre resembles (if the aptness of the"
1992,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"simile may excuse its meanness) yeast, worthless or disagreeable by"
1993,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"itself, but giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is"
1994,METRICAL COMPOSITION,proportionately combined.
1995,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
1996,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The reference to _The Children in the Wood_ by no means satisfies my
1997,METRICAL COMPOSITION,judgement. We all willingly throw ourselves back for awhile into the
1998,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"feelings of our childhood. This ballad, therefore, we read under such"
1999,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"recollections of our own childish feelings, as would equally endear to"
2000,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"us poems, which Mr. Wordsworth himself would regard as faulty in the"
2001,METRICAL COMPOSITION,opposite extreme of gaudy and technical ornament. Before the invention
2002,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of printing, and in a still greater degree, before the introduction of"
2003,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"writing, metre, especially alliterative metre (whether alliterative at"
2004,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the beginning of the words, as in _Piers Plowman_, or at the end, as"
2005,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in rhymes), possessed an independent value as assisting the"
2006,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"recollection, and consequently the preservation, of _any_ series of"
2007,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"truths or incidents. But I am not convinced by the collation of facts,"
2008,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"that _The Children in the Wood_ owes either its preservation, or its"
2009,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"popularity, to its metrical form. Mr. Marshal's repository affords a"
2010,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"number of tales in prose inferior in pathos and general merit, some of"
2011,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"as old a date, and many as widely popular. _Tom Hickathrift_, _Jack"
2012,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the Giant-killer_, _Goody Two-shoes_, and _Little Red Riding-hood_ are"
2013,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"formidable rivals. And that they have continued in prose, cannot be"
2014,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"fairly explained by the assumption, that the comparative meanness of"
2015,METRICAL COMPOSITION,their thoughts and images precluded even the humblest forms of metre.
2016,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The scene of _Goody Two-shoes_ in the church is perfectly susceptible
2017,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of metrical narration; and, among the [Greek: Thaumata thaumastotata]"
2018,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"even of the present age, I do not recollect a more astonishing image"
2019,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"than that of the '_whole rookery, that flew out of the giant's"
2020,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"beard_', scared by the tremendous voice, with which this monster"
2021,METRICAL COMPOSITION,answered the challenge of the heroic _Tom Hickathrift_!
2022,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2023,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"If from these we turn to compositions universally, and independently"
2024,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of all early associations, beloved and admired, would _The Maria_,"
2025,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"_The Monk_, or _The Poor Man's Ass_ of Sterne, be read with more"
2026,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"delight, or have a better chance of immortality, had they without any"
2027,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"change in the diction been composed in rhyme, than in their present"
2028,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"state? If I am not grossly mistaken, the general reply would be in the"
2029,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"negative. Nay, I will confess, that, in Mr. Wordsworth's own volumes,"
2030,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the _Anecdote for Fathers_, _Simon Lee_, _Alice Fell_, _The Beggars_,"
2031,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and _The Sailor's Mother_, notwithstanding the beauties which are to"
2032,METRICAL COMPOSITION,be found in each of them where the poet interposes the music of his
2033,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"own thoughts, would have been more delightful to me in prose, told and"
2034,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"managed, as by Mr. Wordsworth they would have been, in a moral essay,"
2035,METRICAL COMPOSITION,or pedestrian tour.
2036,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2037,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention, and therefore"
2038,METRICAL COMPOSITION,excites the question: Why is the attention to be thus stimulated? Now
2039,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself:
2040,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"for this we have shown to be conditional, and dependent on the"
2041,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions, to which the metrical"
2042,METRICAL COMPOSITION,form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any other answer that can
2043,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"be rationally given, short of this: I write in metre, because I am"
2044,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"about to use a language different from that of prose. Besides, where"
2045,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the language is not such, how interesting soever the reflections are,"
2046,METRICAL COMPOSITION,that are capable of being drawn by a philosophic mind from the
2047,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"thoughts or incidents of the poem, the metre itself must often become"
2048,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"feeble. Take the last three stanzas of _The Sailor's Mother_, for"
2049,METRICAL COMPOSITION,instance. If I could for a moment abstract from the effect produced on
2050,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the author's feelings, as a man, by the incident at the time of its"
2051,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"real occurrence, I would dare appeal to his own judgement, whether in"
2052,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the metre itself he found a sufficient reason for their being written
2053,METRICAL COMPOSITION,metrically?
2054,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2055,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And, thus continuing, she said,"
2056,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I had a son, who many a day"
2057,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Sailed on the seas; but he is dead;
2058,METRICAL COMPOSITION,In Denmark he was cast away;
2059,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And I have travelled far as Hull, to see"
2060,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"What clothes he might have left, or other property."
2061,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2062,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The bird and cage they both were his:
2063,METRICAL COMPOSITION,'Twas my son's bird; and neat and trim
2064,METRICAL COMPOSITION,He kept it: many voyages
2065,METRICAL COMPOSITION,This singing-bird hath gone with him;
2066,METRICAL COMPOSITION,When last he sailed he left the bird behind;
2067,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"As it might be, perhaps, from bodings of his mind."
2068,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2069,METRICAL COMPOSITION,He to a fellow-lodger's care
2070,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Had left it, to be watched and fed,"
2071,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Till he came back again; and there
2072,METRICAL COMPOSITION,I found it when my son was dead;
2073,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And now, God help me for my little wit!"
2074,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I trail it with me, Sir! he took so much delight in it."
2075,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2076,METRICAL COMPOSITION,If disproportioning the emphasis we read these stanzas so as to make
2077,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the rhymes perceptible, even tri-syllable rhymes could scarcely"
2078,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"produce an equal sense of oddity and strangeness, as we feel here in"
2079,METRICAL COMPOSITION,finding rhymes at all in sentences so exclusively colloquial. I would
2080,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"further ask whether, but for that visionary state, into which the"
2081,METRICAL COMPOSITION,figure of the woman and the susceptibility of his own genius had
2082,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"placed the poet's imagination (a state, which spreads its influence"
2083,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and colouring over all, that co-exists with the exciting cause, and in"
2084,METRICAL COMPOSITION,which
2085,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2086,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"The simplest, and the most familiar things"
2087,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Gain a strange power of spreading awe around them),"
2088,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2089,METRICAL COMPOSITION,I would ask the poet whether he would not have felt an abrupt downfall
2090,METRICAL COMPOSITION,in these verses from the preceding stanza?
2091,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2092,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The ancient spirit is not dead;
2093,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Old times, thought I, are breathing there;"
2094,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Proud was I that my country bred
2095,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Such strength, a dignity so fair:"
2096,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;"
2097,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate."
2098,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2099,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"It must not be omitted, and is besides worthy of notice, that those"
2100,METRICAL COMPOSITION,stanzas furnish the only fair instance that I have been able to
2101,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"discover in all Mr. Wordsworth's writings, of an actual adoption, or"
2102,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"true imitation, of the real and very language of low and rustic life,"
2103,METRICAL COMPOSITION,freed from provincialisms.
2104,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2105,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned,"
2106,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which render metre the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect and"
2107,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"defective without metre. Metre, therefore, having been connected with"
2108,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poetry most often and by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined"
2109,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"with metre must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have"
2110,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"nevertheless some property in common with poetry, as an intermedium of"
2111,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"affinity, a sort (if I may dare borrow a well-known phrase from"
2112,METRICAL COMPOSITION,technical chemistry) of _mordaunt_ between it and the superadded
2113,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"metre. Now poetry, Mr. Wordsworth truly affirms, does always imply"
2114,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"PASSION: which word must be here understood in its most general sense,"
2115,METRICAL COMPOSITION,as an excited state of the feelings and faculties. And as every
2116,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"passion has its proper pulse, so will it likewise have its"
2117,METRICAL COMPOSITION,characteristic modes of expression. But where there exists that degree
2118,METRICAL COMPOSITION,of genius and talent which entitles a writer to aim at the honours of
2119,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"a poet, the very act of poetic composition itself is, and is allowed"
2120,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"to imply and to produce, an unusual state of excitement, which of"
2121,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"course justifies and demands a correspondent difference of language,"
2122,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"as truly, though not perhaps in as marked a degree, as the excitement"
2123,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of love, fear, rage, or jealousy. The vividness of the descriptions or"
2124,METRICAL COMPOSITION,declamations in DONNE or DRYDEN is as much and as often derived from
2125,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the force and fervour of the describer, as from the reflections, forms"
2126,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"or incidents, which constitute their subject and materials. The wheels"
2127,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"take fire from the mere rapidity of their motion. To what extent, and"
2128,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"under what modifications, this may be admitted to act, I shall attempt"
2129,METRICAL COMPOSITION,to define in an after remark on Mr. Wordsworth's reply to this
2130,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"objection, or rather on his objection to this reply, as already"
2131,METRICAL COMPOSITION,anticipated in his preface.
2132,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2133,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Fourthly, and as intimately connected with this, if not the same"
2134,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"argument in a more general form, I adduce the high spiritual instinct"
2135,METRICAL COMPOSITION,of the human being impelling us to seek unity by harmonious
2136,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"adjustment, and thus establishing the principle, that all the parts of"
2137,METRICAL COMPOSITION,an organized whole must be assimilated to the more important and
2138,METRICAL COMPOSITION,essential parts. This and the preceding arguments may be strengthened
2139,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"by the reflection, that the composition of a poem is among the"
2140,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists"
2141,METRICAL COMPOSITION,either in the interfusion of the same throughout the radically
2142,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"different, or of the different throughout a base radically the same."
2143,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2144,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Lastly, I appeal to the practice of the best poets, of all countries"
2145,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and in all ages, as authorizing the opinion, (deduced from all the"
2146,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"foregoing,) that in every import of the word essential, which would"
2147,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"not here involve a mere truism, there may be, is, and ought to be an"
2148,METRICAL COMPOSITION,essential difference between the language of prose and of metrical
2149,METRICAL COMPOSITION,composition.
2150,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2151,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"In Mr. Wordsworth's criticism of Gray's Sonnet, the readers' sympathy"
2152,METRICAL COMPOSITION,with his praise or blame of the different parts is taken for granted
2153,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"rather perhaps too easily. He has not, at least, attempted to win or"
2154,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"compel it by argumentative analysis. In my conception at least, the"
2155,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"lines rejected as of no value do, with the exception of the two first,"
2156,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"differ as much and as little from the language of common life, as"
2157,METRICAL COMPOSITION,those which he has printed in italics as possessing genuine
2158,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"excellence. Of the five lines thus honourably distinguished, two of"
2159,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"them differ from prose, even more widely than the lines which either"
2160,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"precede or follow, in the position of the words."
2161,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2162,METRICAL COMPOSITION,_A different object do these eyes require;_
2163,METRICAL COMPOSITION,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
2164,METRICAL COMPOSITION,_And in my breast the imperfect joys expire._
2165,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2166,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"But were it otherwise, what would this prove, but a truth, of which no"
2167,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"man ever doubted? Videlicet, that there are sentences, which would be"
2168,METRICAL COMPOSITION,equally in their place both in verse and prose. Assuredly it does not
2169,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"prove the point, which alone requires proof; namely, that there are"
2170,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"not passages, which would suit the one and not suit the other. The"
2171,METRICAL COMPOSITION,first line of this sonnet is distinguished from the ordinary language
2172,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of men by the epithet to '_morning_'. (For we will set aside, at"
2173,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"present, the consideration, that the particular word '_smiling_' is"
2174,METRICAL COMPOSITION,hackneyed and (as it involves a sort of personification) not quite
2175,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"congruous with the common and material attribute of _shining_.) And,"
2176,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"doubtless, this adjunction of epithets for the purpose of additional"
2177,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"description, where no particular attention is demanded for the quality"
2178,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of the thing, would be noticed as giving a poetic cast to a man's"
2179,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"conversation. Should the sportsman exclaim, '_Come boys! the rosy"
2180,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"morning calls you up_', he will be supposed to have some song in his"
2181,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"head. But no one suspects this, when he says, 'A wet morning shall not"
2182,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"confine us to our beds.' This then is either a defect in poetry, or it"
2183,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"is not. Whoever should decide in the affirmative, I would request him"
2184,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"to re-peruse any one poem, of any confessedly great poet from Homer to"
2185,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Milton, or from Aeschylus to Shakespeare; and to strike out (in"
2186,METRICAL COMPOSITION,thought I mean) every instance of this kind. If the number of these
2187,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"fancied erasures did not startle him, or if he continued to deem the"
2188,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"work improved by their total omission, he must advance reasons of no"
2189,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"ordinary strength and evidence, reasons grounded in the essence of"
2190,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"human nature. Otherwise, I should not hesitate to consider him as a"
2191,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"man not so much proof against all authority, as dead to it."
2192,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2193,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"The second line,"
2194,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2195,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;--
2196,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2197,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"has indeed almost as many faults as words. But then it is a bad line,"
2198,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"not because the language is distinct from that of prose, but because"
2199,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"it conveys incongruous images, because it confounds the cause and the"
2200,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"effect, the real thing with the personified representative of the"
2201,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"thing; in short, because it differs from the language of good sense!"
2202,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"That the 'Phoebus' is hackneyed, and a school-boy image, is an"
2203,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"accidental fault, dependent on the age in which the author wrote, and"
2204,METRICAL COMPOSITION,not deduced from the nature of the thing. That it is part of an
2205,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"exploded mythology, is an objection more deeply grounded. Yet when the"
2206,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"torch of ancient learning was rekindled, so cheering were its beams,"
2207,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"that our eldest poets, cut off by Christianity from all accredited"
2208,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"machinery, and deprived of all acknowledged guardians and symbols of"
2209,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the great objects of nature, were naturally induced to adopt, as a"
2210,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poetic language, those fabulous personages, those forms of the"
2211,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"supernatural in nature, which had given them such dear delight in the"
2212,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poems of their great masters. Nay, even at this day what scholar of"
2213,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"genial taste will not so far sympathize with them, as to read with"
2214,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"pleasure in Petrarch, Chaucer, or Spenser, what he would perhaps"
2215,METRICAL COMPOSITION,condemn as puerile in a modern poet?
2216,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2217,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"I remember no poet, whose writings would safelier stand the test of"
2218,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Mr. Wordsworth's theory, than Spenser. Yet will Mr. Wordsworth say,"
2219,METRICAL COMPOSITION,that the style of the following stanza is either undistinguished from
2220,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"prose, and the language of ordinary life? Or that it is vicious, and"
2221,METRICAL COMPOSITION,that the stanzas are blots in the _Faerie Queene_?
2222,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2223,METRICAL COMPOSITION,By this the northern wagoner had set
2224,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"His sevenfold teme behind the steadfast starre,"
2225,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"That was in ocean waves yet never wet,"
2226,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre"
2227,METRICAL COMPOSITION,To all that in the wild deep wandering are:

2236,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Of greatest heaven gan to open fayre,"
2237,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And Phoebus fresh, as brydegrome to his mate,"
2238,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie hayre,"
2239,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And hurl'd his glist'ring beams through gloomy ayre:
2240,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Which when the wakeful elfe perceived, streightway"
2241,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"He started up, and did him selfe prepayre"
2242,METRICAL COMPOSITION,In sun-bright armes and battailous array;

2246,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2247,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"On the contrary to how many passages, both in hymn books and in blank"
2248,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"verse poems, could I (were it not invidious) direct the reader's"
2249,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"attention, the style of which is most unpoetic, because, and only"
2250,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"because, it is the style of prose? He will not suppose me capable of"
2251,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"having in my mind such verses, as"
2252,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2253,METRICAL COMPOSITION,I put my hat upon my head
2254,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And walk'd into the Strand;
2255,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And there I met another man,"
2256,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Whose hat was in his hand.
2257,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2258,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"To such specimens it would indeed be a fair and full reply, that these"
2259,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"lines are not bad, because they are unpoetic; but because they are"
2260,METRICAL COMPOSITION,empty of all sense and feeling; and that it were an idle attempt to
2261,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"prove that an ape is not a Newton, when it is evident that he is not a"
2262,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"man. But the sense shall be good and weighty, the language correct and"
2263,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"dignified, the subject interesting and treated with feeling; and yet"
2264,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the style shall, notwithstanding all these merits, be justly blamable"
2265,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"as prosaic, and solely because the words and the order of the words"
2266,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"would find their appropriate place in prose, but are not suitable to"
2267,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"metrical composition. The _Civil Wars_ of Daniel is an instructive,"
2268,METRICAL COMPOSITION,and even interesting work; but take the following stanzas (and from
2269,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the hundred instances which abound I might probably have selected
2270,METRICAL COMPOSITION,others far more striking):
2271,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2272,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And to the end we may with better ease
2273,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Discern the true discourse, vouchsafe to show"
2274,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"What were the times foregoing near to these,"
2275,METRICAL COMPOSITION,That these we may with better profit know.
2276,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Tell how the world fell into this disease;
2277,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And how so great distemperature did grow;
2278,METRICAL COMPOSITION,So shall we see with what degrees it came;
2279,METRICAL COMPOSITION,How things at full do soon wax out of frame.
2280,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2281,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Ten kings had from the Norman conqu'ror reign'd
2282,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"With intermixt and variable fate,"
2283,METRICAL COMPOSITION,When England to her greatest height attain'd
2284,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Of power, dominion, glory, wealth, and state;"
2285,METRICAL COMPOSITION,After it had with much ado sustain'd
2286,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"The violence of princes, with debate"
2287,METRICAL COMPOSITION,For titles and the often mutinies
2288,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Of nobles for their ancient liberties.
2289,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2290,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"For first, the Norman, conqu'ring all by might,"
2291,METRICAL COMPOSITION,By might was forc'd to keep what he had got;
2292,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Mixing our customs and the form of right
2293,METRICAL COMPOSITION,With foreign constitutions he had brought;
2294,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Mast'ring the mighty, humbling the poorer wight,"
2295,METRICAL COMPOSITION,By all severest means that could be wrought;

2301,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Will it be contended on the one side, that these lines are mean and"
2302,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"senseless? Or on the other, that they are not prosaic, and for that"
2303,METRICAL COMPOSITION,reason unpoetic? This poet's well-merited epithet is that of the
2304,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"'_well-languaged Daniel_'; but likewise, and by the consent of his"
2305,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"contemporaries no less than of all succeeding critics, the 'prosaic"
2306,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Daniel.' Yet those, who thus designate this wise and amiable writer,"
2307,METRICAL COMPOSITION,from the frequent incorrespondency of his diction to his metre in the
2308,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"majority of his compositions, not only deem them valuable and"
2309,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"interesting on other accounts, but willingly admit that there are to"
2310,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"be found throughout his poems, and especially in his _Epistles_ and in"
2311,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"his _Hymen's Triumph_, many and exquisite specimens of that style"
2312,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which, as the neutral ground of prose and verse, is common to both. A"
2313,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"fine and almost faultless extract, eminent, as for other beauties, so"
2314,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"for its perfection in these species of diction, may be seen in Lamb's"
2315,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"_Dramatic Specimens_, &c., a work of various interest from the nature"
2316,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of the selections themselves, (all from the plays of Shakespeare's"
2317,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"contemporaries), and deriving a high additional value from the notes,"
2318,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which are full of just and original criticism, expressed with all the"
2319,METRICAL COMPOSITION,freshness of originality.
2320,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2321,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Among the possible effects of practical adherence to a theory that
2322,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"aims to identify the style of prose and verse,--(if it does not indeed"
2323,METRICAL COMPOSITION,claim for the latter a yet nearer resemblance to the average style of
2324,METRICAL COMPOSITION,men in the viva voce intercourse of real life)--we might anticipate
2325,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the following as not the least likely to occur. It will happen, as I"
2326,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"have indeed before observed, that the metre itself, the sole"
2327,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"acknowledged difference, will occasionally become metre to the eye"
2328,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"only. The existence of prosaisms, and that they detract from the"
2329,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"merit of a poem, must at length be conceded, when a number of"
2330,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"successive lines can be rendered, even to the most delicate ear,"
2331,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"unrecognizable as verse, or as having even been intended for verse, by"
2332,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"simply transcribing them as prose; when if the poem be in blank verse,"
2333,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"this can be effected without any alteration, or at most by merely"
2334,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"restoring one or two words to their proper places, from which they"
2335,METRICAL COMPOSITION,have been transplanted[5] for no assignable cause or reason but that
2336,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of the author's convenience; but if it be in rhyme, by the mere"
2337,METRICAL COMPOSITION,exchange of the final word of each line for some other of the same
2338,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"meaning, equally appropriate, dignified and euphonic."
2339,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2340,METRICAL COMPOSITION,[5] As the ingenious gentleman under the influence of the
2341,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Tragic Muse contrived to dislocate, 'I wish you a good"
2342,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"morning, Sir! Thank you, Sir, and I wish you the same,' into"
2343,METRICAL COMPOSITION,two blank-verse heroics:--
2344,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2345,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"To you a good morning, good Sir! I wish."
2346,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"You, Sir! I thank: to you the same wish I."
2347,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2348,METRICAL COMPOSITION,In those parts of Mr. Wordsworth's works which I have
2349,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"thoroughly studied, I find fewer instances in which this"
2350,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"would be practicable than I have met in many poems, where an"
2351,METRICAL COMPOSITION,approximation of prose has been sedulously and on system
2352,METRICAL COMPOSITION,guarded against. Indeed excepting the stanzas already quoted
2353,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"from _The Sailor's Mother_, I can recollect but one instance:"
2354,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"viz. a short passage of four or five lines in _The Brothers_,"
2355,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"that model of English pastoral, which I never yet read with"
2356,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"unclouded eye.--'James, pointing to its summit, over which"
2357,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"they had all purposed to return together, informed them that"
2358,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"he would wait for them there. They parted, and his comrades"
2359,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"passed that way some two hours after, but they did not find"
2360,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"him at the appointed place, _a circumstance of which they"
2361,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"took no heed_: but one of them, going by chance into the"
2362,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"house, which at this time was James's house, learnt _there_,"
2363,METRICAL COMPOSITION,that nobody had seen him all that day.' The only change which
2364,METRICAL COMPOSITION,has been made is in the position of the little word _there_
2365,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in two instances, the position in the original being clearly"
2366,METRICAL COMPOSITION,such as is not adopted in ordinary conversation. The other
2367,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"words printed in _italics_ were so marked because, though"
2368,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"good and genuine English, they are not the phraseology of"
2369,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"common conversation either in the word put in apposition, or"
2370,METRICAL COMPOSITION,in the connexion by the genitive pronoun. Men in general
2371,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"would have said, 'but that was a circumstance they paid no"
2372,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"attention to, or took no notice of;' and the language is, on"
2373,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"the theory of the preface, justified only by the narrator's"
2374,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"being the _Vicar_. Yet if any ear _could_ suspect, that these"
2375,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"sentences were ever printed as metre, on those very words"
2376,METRICAL COMPOSITION,alone could the suspicion have been grounded.
2377,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2378,METRICAL COMPOSITION,The answer or objection in the preface to the anticipated remark 'that
2379,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"metre paves the way to other distinctions', is contained in the"
2380,METRICAL COMPOSITION,following words. 'The distinction of rhyme and metre is voluntary and
2381,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"uniform, and not, like that produced by (what is called) poetic"
2382,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"diction, arbitrary, and subject to infinite caprices, upon which no"
2383,METRICAL COMPOSITION,calculation whatever can be made. In the one case the reader is
2384,METRICAL COMPOSITION,utterly at the mercy of the poet respecting what imagery or diction he
2385,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"may choose to connect with the passion.' But is this a poet, of whom a"
2386,METRICAL COMPOSITION,poet is speaking? No surely! rather of a fool or madman: or at best of
2387,METRICAL COMPOSITION,a vain or ignorant phantast! And might not brains so wild and so
2388,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"deficient make just the same havoc with rhymes and metres, as they are"
2389,METRICAL COMPOSITION,supposed to effect with modes and figures of speech? How is the reader
2390,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"at the mercy of such men? If he continue to read their nonsense, is it"
2391,METRICAL COMPOSITION,not his own fault? The ultimate end of criticism is much more to
2392,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"establish the principles of writing, than to furnish rules how to pass"
2393,METRICAL COMPOSITION,judgement on what has been written by others; if indeed it were
2394,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"possible that the two could be separated. But if it be asked, by what"
2395,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"principles the poet is to regulate his own style, if he do not adhere"
2396,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"closely to the sort and order of words which he hears in the market,"
2397,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"wake, high-road, or plough-field? I reply; by principles, the"
2398,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"ignorance or neglect of which would convict him of being no poet, but"
2399,METRICAL COMPOSITION,a silly or presumptuous usurper of the name! By the principles of
2400,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"grammar, logic, psychology! In one word, by such a knowledge of the"
2401,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"facts, material and spiritual, that most appertain to his art, as, if"
2402,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"it have been governed and applied by good sense, and rendered"
2403,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"instinctive by habit, becomes the representative and reward of our"
2404,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"past conscious reasonings, insights, and conclusions, and acquires the"
2405,METRICAL COMPOSITION,name of TASTE. By what rule that does not leave the reader at the
2406,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poet's mercy, and the poet at his own, is the latter to distinguish"
2407,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"between the language suitable to suppressed, and the language, which"
2408,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"is characteristic of indulged, anger? Or between that of rage and that"
2409,METRICAL COMPOSITION,of jealousy? Is it obtained by wandering about in search of angry or
2410,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"jealous people in uncultivated society, in order to copy their words?"
2411,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Or not far rather by the power of imagination proceeding upon the all
2412,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"in each of human nature? By meditation, rather than by observation?"
2413,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And by the latter in consequence only of the former? As eyes, for"
2414,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which the former has pre-determined their field of vision, and to"
2415,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which, as to its organ, it communicates a microscopic power? There is"
2416,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"not, I firmly believe, a man now living, who has, from his own inward"
2417,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"experience, a clearer intuition than Mr. Wordsworth himself, that the"
2418,METRICAL COMPOSITION,last mentioned are the true sources of genial discrimination. Through
2419,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the same process and by the same creative agency will the poet
2420,METRICAL COMPOSITION,distinguish the degree and kind of the excitement produced by the very
2421,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"act of poetic composition. As intuitively will he know, what"
2422,METRICAL COMPOSITION,differences of style it at once inspires and justifies; what
2423,METRICAL COMPOSITION,intermixture of conscious volition is natural to that state; and in
2424,METRICAL COMPOSITION,what instances such figures and colours of speech degenerate into mere
2425,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"creatures of an arbitrary purpose, cold technical artifices of"
2426,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"ornament or connexion. For, even as truth is its own light and"
2427,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"evidence, discovering at once itself and falsehood, so is it the"
2428,METRICAL COMPOSITION,prerogative of poetic genius to distinguish by parental instinct its
2429,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"proper offspring from the changelings, which the gnomes of vanity or"
2430,METRICAL COMPOSITION,the fairies of fashion may have laid in its cradle or called by its
2431,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"names. Could a rule be given from without, poetry would cease to be"
2432,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poetry, and sink into a mechanical art. It would be [Greek:"
2433,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"morphôsis], not [Greek: poiêsis]. The rules of the IMAGINATION are"
2434,METRICAL COMPOSITION,themselves the very powers of growth and production. The words to
2435,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"which they are reducible, present only the outlines and external"
2436,METRICAL COMPOSITION,appearance of the fruit. A deceptive counterfeit of the superficial
2437,METRICAL COMPOSITION,form and colours may be elaborated; but the marble peach feels cold
2438,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and heavy, and children only put it to their mouths. We find no"
2439,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"difficulty in admitting as excellent, and the legitimate language of"
2440,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"poetic fervour self-impassioned, Donne's apostrophe to the Sun in the"
2441,METRICAL COMPOSITION,second stanza of his _Progress of the Soul_.
2442,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2443,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Thee, eye of heaven! this great soul envies not;"
2444,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"By thy male force is all, we have, begot."
2445,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"In the first East thou now beginn'st to shine,"
2446,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Suck'st early balm and island spices there,"
2447,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And wilt anon in thy loose-rein'd career
2448,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"At Tagus, Po, Seine, Thames, and Danow dine,"
2449,METRICAL COMPOSITION,And see at night this western world of mine:
2450,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Yet hast thou not more nations seen than she,"
2451,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Who before thee one day began to be,"
2452,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And, thy frail light being quench'd, shall long, long outlive thee!"
2453,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2454,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Or the next stanza but one:
2455,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2456,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Great destiny, the commissary of God,"
2457,METRICAL COMPOSITION,That hast mark'd out a path and period
2458,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"For ev'ry thing! Who, where we offspring took,"
2459,METRICAL COMPOSITION,Our way and ends see'st at one instant: thou
2460,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Knot of all causes! Thou, whose changeless brow"
2461,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Ne'er smiles nor frowns! O! vouchsafe thou to look,"
2462,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"And show my story in thy eternal book, &c."
2463,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2464,METRICAL COMPOSITION,As little difficulty do we find in excluding from the honours of
2465,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"unaffected warmth and elevation the madness prepense of pseudo-poesy,"
2466,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"or the startling hysteric of weakness over-exerting itself, which"
2467,METRICAL COMPOSITION,bursts on the unprepared reader in sundry odes and apostrophes to
2468,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"abstract terms. Such are the Odes to Jealousy, to Hope, to Oblivion,"
2469,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"and the like, in Dodsley's collection and the magazines of that day,"
2470,METRICAL COMPOSITION,which seldom fail to remind me of an Oxford copy of verses on the two
2471,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"Suttons, commencing with"
2472,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2473,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"INOCULATION, heavenly maid! descend!"
2474,METRICAL COMPOSITION,
2475,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"It is not to be denied that men of undoubted talents, and even poets"
2476,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"of true, though not of first-rate, genius, have from a mistaken theory"
2477,METRICAL COMPOSITION,deluded both themselves and others in the opposite extreme. I once
2478,METRICAL COMPOSITION,read to a company of sensible and well-educated women the introductory
2479,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"period of Cowley's preface to his _Pindaric Odes, written in imitation"
2480,METRICAL COMPOSITION,of the style and manner of the odes of Pindar_. 'If (says Cowley) a
2481,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"man should undertake to translate Pindar, word for word, it would be"
2482,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"thought that one madman had translated another: as may appear, when"
2483,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"he, that understands not the original, reads the verbal traduction of"
2484,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"him into Latin prose, than which nothing seems more raving.' I then"
2485,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"proceeded with his own free version of the second Olympic, composed"
2486,METRICAL COMPOSITION,for the charitable purpose of rationalizing the Theban Eagle.
2487,METRICAL COMPOSITION,

2512,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"sober majesty of lofty sense, it appeared to them to approach more"
2513,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"nearly, than any other poetry they had heard, to the style of our"

2534,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"precluded, but by the rejection of all distinctions between prose and"
2535,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"verse, save that of metre? Surely good sense, and a moderate insight"
2536,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"into the constitution of the human mind, would be amply sufficient to"
2537,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"prove, that such language and such combinations are the native produce"
2538,METRICAL COMPOSITION,neither of the fancy nor of the imagination; that their operation
2539,METRICAL COMPOSITION,consists in the excitement of surprise by the juxtaposition and
2540,METRICAL COMPOSITION,apparent reconciliation of widely different or incompatible things. As
2541,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"when, for instance, the hills are made to reflect the image of a"
2542,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"voice. Surely, no unusual taste is requisite to see clearly, that this"
2543,METRICAL COMPOSITION,compulsory juxtaposition is not produced by the presentation of
2544,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"impressive or delightful forms to the inward vision, nor by any"
2545,METRICAL COMPOSITION,sympathy with the modifying powers with which the genius of the poet
2546,METRICAL COMPOSITION,had united and inspirited all the objects of his thought; that it is
2547,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"therefore a species of wit, a pure work of the will, and implies a"

2551,METRICAL COMPOSITION,"When a poem, or a part of a poem, shall be adduced, which is evidently"

2575,TO CANTERBURY[6],[6] From _A Descriptive Catalogue of Pictures_.
2576,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2577,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2578,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The time chosen is early morning, before sunrise, when the jolly"
2579,TO CANTERBURY[6],company are just quitting the Tabarde Inn. The Knight and Squire with
2580,TO CANTERBURY[6],the Squire's Yeoman lead the Procession; next follow the youthful
2581,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Abbess, her Nun, and three Priests; her greyhounds attend her:"
2582,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2583,TO CANTERBURY[6],Of small hounds had she that she fed
2584,TO CANTERBURY[6],"With roast flesh, milk, and wastel bread."
2585,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2586,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Next follow the Friar and Monk; then the Tapiser, the Pardoner, and"
2587,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the Sompnour and Manciple. After these 'Our Host', who occupies the"
2588,TO CANTERBURY[6],"centre of the cavalcade, directs them to the Knight as the person who"
2589,TO CANTERBURY[6],would be likely to commence their task of each telling a tale in their
2590,TO CANTERBURY[6],"order. After the Host follow the Shipman, the Haberdasher, the Dyer,"
2591,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the Franklin, the Physician, the Ploughman, the Lawyer, the Poor"
2592,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Parson, the Merchant, the Wife of Bath, the Miller, the Cook, the"
2593,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Oxford Scholar, Chaucer himself; and the Reeve comes as Chaucer has"
2594,TO CANTERBURY[6],described:
2595,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2596,TO CANTERBURY[6],And ever he rode hinderest of the rout.
2597,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2598,TO CANTERBURY[6],These last are issuing from the gateway of the Inn the Cook and the
2599,TO CANTERBURY[6],Wife of Bath are both taking their morning's draught of comfort.
2600,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Spectators stand at the gateway of the Inn, and are composed of an old"
2601,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Man, a Woman, and Children."
2602,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2603,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Landscape is an eastward view of the country, from the Tabarde Inn"
2604,TO CANTERBURY[6],"in Southwark, as it may be supposed to have appeared in Chaucer's"
2605,TO CANTERBURY[6],"time, interspersed with cottages and villages. The first beams of the"
2606,TO CANTERBURY[6],Sun are seen above the horizon; some buildings and spires indicate the
2607,TO CANTERBURY[6],"situation of the Great City. The Inn is a Gothic building, which"
2608,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Thynne in his Glossary says was the lodging of the Abbot of Hyde, by"
2609,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Winchester. On the Inn is inscribed its title, and a proper advantage"
2610,TO CANTERBURY[6],is taken of this circumstance to describe the subject of the Picture.
2611,TO CANTERBURY[6],The words written over the gateway of the Inn are as follow: 'The
2612,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Tabarde Inn, by Henry Baillie, the lodgynge-house for Pilgrims who"
2613,TO CANTERBURY[6],journey to Saint Thomas's Shrine at Canterbury.'
2614,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2615,TO CANTERBURY[6],The characters of Chaucer's Pilgrims are the characters which compose
2616,TO CANTERBURY[6],"all ages and nations. As one age falls, another rises, different to"
2617,TO CANTERBURY[6],"mortal sight, but to immortals only the same; for we see the same"
2618,TO CANTERBURY[6],"characters repeated again and again, in animals, vegetables, minerals,"
2619,TO CANTERBURY[6],and in men. Nothing new occurs in identical existence; Accident ever
2620,TO CANTERBURY[6],"varies, Substance can never suffer change nor decay."
2621,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2622,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Of Chaucer's characters, as described in his _Canterbury Tales_, some"
2623,TO CANTERBURY[6],"of the names or titles are altered by time, but the characters"
2624,TO CANTERBURY[6],themselves for ever remain unaltered; and consequently they are the
2625,TO CANTERBURY[6],"physiognomies or lineaments of universal human life, beyond which"
2626,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Nature never steps. Names alter, things never alter. I have known"
2627,TO CANTERBURY[6],"multitudes of those who would have been monks in the age of monkery,"
2628,TO CANTERBURY[6],"who in this deistical age are deists. As Newton numbered the stars,"
2629,TO CANTERBURY[6],"and as Linnaeus numbered the plants, so Chaucer numbered the classes"
2630,TO CANTERBURY[6],of men.
2631,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2632,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Painter has consequently varied the heads and forms of his
2633,TO CANTERBURY[6],personages into all Nature's varieties; the horses he has also varied
2634,TO CANTERBURY[6],to accord to their riders; the costume is correct according to
2635,TO CANTERBURY[6],authentic monuments.
2636,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2637,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Knight and Squire with the Squire's Yeoman lead the Procession, as"
2638,TO CANTERBURY[6],Chaucer has also placed them first in his Prologue. The Knight is a
2639,TO CANTERBURY[6],"true Hero, a good, great and wise man; his whole-length portrait on"
2640,TO CANTERBURY[6],"horseback, as written by Chaucer, cannot be surpassed. He has spent"
2641,TO CANTERBURY[6],"his life in the field, has ever been a conqueror, and is that species"
2642,TO CANTERBURY[6],of character which in every age stands as the guardian of man against
2643,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the oppressor. His son is like him, with the germ of perhaps greater"
2644,TO CANTERBURY[6],"perfection still, as he blends literature and the arts with his"
2645,TO CANTERBURY[6],"warlike studies. Their dress and their horses are of the first rate,"
2646,TO CANTERBURY[6],"without ostentation, and with all the true grandeur that unaffected"
2647,TO CANTERBURY[6],simplicity when in high rank always displays. The Squire's Yeoman is
2648,TO CANTERBURY[6],"also a great character, a man perfectly knowing in his profession:"
2649,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2650,TO CANTERBURY[6],And in his hand he bare a mighty bow.
2651,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2652,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Chaucer describes here a mighty man, one who in war is the worthy"
2653,TO CANTERBURY[6],attendant on noble heroes.
2654,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2655,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Prioress follows these with her female Chaplain:
2656,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2657,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Another Nonne also with her had she,"
2658,TO CANTERBURY[6],"That was her Chaplaine, and Priests three."
2659,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2660,TO CANTERBURY[6],"This Lady is described also as of the first rank, rich and honoured."
2661,TO CANTERBURY[6],"She has certain peculiarities and little delicate affectations, not"
2662,TO CANTERBURY[6],"unbecoming in her, being accompanied with what is truly grand and"
2663,TO CANTERBURY[6],really polite; her person and face Chaucer has described with
2664,TO CANTERBURY[6],"minuteness; it is very elegant, and was the beauty of our ancestors"
2665,TO CANTERBURY[6],"till after Elizabeth's time, when voluptuousness and folly began to be"
2666,TO CANTERBURY[6],accounted beautiful.
2667,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2668,TO CANTERBURY[6],Her companion and her three Priests were no doubt all perfectly
2669,TO CANTERBURY[6],delineated in those parts of Chaucer's work which are now lost; we
2670,TO CANTERBURY[6],ought to suppose them suitable attendants on rank and fashion.
2671,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2672,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Monk follows these with the Friar. The Painter has also grouped
2673,TO CANTERBURY[6],"with these the Pardoner and the Sompnour and the Manciple, and has"
2674,TO CANTERBURY[6],here also introduced one of the rich citizens of London--characters
2675,TO CANTERBURY[6],"likely to ride in company, all being above the common rank in life, or"
2676,TO CANTERBURY[6],attendants on those who were so.
2677,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2678,TO CANTERBURY[6],"For the Monk is described by Chaucer, as a man of the first rank in"
2679,TO CANTERBURY[6],"society, noble, rich, and expensively attended; he is a leader of the"
2680,TO CANTERBURY[6],"age, with certain humorous accompaniments in his character, that do"
2681,TO CANTERBURY[6],"not degrade, but render him an object of dignified mirth, but also"
2682,TO CANTERBURY[6],with other accompaniments not so respectable.
2683,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2684,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Friar is a character of a mixed kind:
2685,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2686,TO CANTERBURY[6],"A friar there was, a wanton and a merry;"
2687,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2688,TO CANTERBURY[6],"but in his office he is said to be a 'full solemn man'; eloquent,"
2689,TO CANTERBURY[6],"amorous, witty and satirical; young, handsome and rich; he is a"
2690,TO CANTERBURY[6],"complete rogue, with constitutional gaiety enough to make him a"
2691,TO CANTERBURY[6],master of all the pleasures of the world:
2692,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2693,TO CANTERBURY[6],"His neck was white as the flour de lis,"
2694,TO CANTERBURY[6],Thereto strong he was as a champioun.
2695,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2696,TO CANTERBURY[6],"It is necessary here to speak of Chaucer's own character, that I may"
2697,TO CANTERBURY[6],set certain mistaken critics right in their conception of the humour
2698,TO CANTERBURY[6],and fun that occur on the journey. Chaucer is himself the great
2699,TO CANTERBURY[6],"poetical observer of men, who in every age is born to record and"
2700,TO CANTERBURY[6],"eternize its acts. This he does as a master, as a father and superior,"
2701,TO CANTERBURY[6],"who looks down on their little follies from the Emperor to the Miller,"
2702,TO CANTERBURY[6],"sometimes with severity, oftener with joke and sport."
2703,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2704,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Accordingly Chaucer has made his Monk a great tragedian, one who"
2705,TO CANTERBURY[6],"studied poetical art. So much so that the generous Knight is, in the"
2706,TO CANTERBURY[6],"compassionate dictates of his soul, compelled to cry out:"
2707,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2708,TO CANTERBURY[6],"'Ho,' quoth the Knyght, 'good Sir, no more of this;"
2709,TO CANTERBURY[6],"That ye have said is right ynough, I wis,"
2710,TO CANTERBURY[6],And mokell more; for little heaviness
2711,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Is right enough for much folk, as I guesse."
2712,TO CANTERBURY[6],"I say, for me, it is a great disease,"
2713,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Whereas men have been in wealth and ease,"
2714,TO CANTERBURY[6],"To heare of their sudden fall, alas!"
2715,TO CANTERBURY[6],And the contrary is joy and solas.'
2716,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2717,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Monk's definition of tragedy in the proem to his tale is worth
2718,TO CANTERBURY[6],repeating:
2719,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2720,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Tragedie is to tell a certain story,"
2721,TO CANTERBURY[6],"As old books us maken memory,"
2722,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Of hem that stood in great prosperity,"
2723,TO CANTERBURY[6],"And be fallen out of high degree,"
2724,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Into miserie, and ended wretchedly."
2725,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2726,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Though a man of luxury, pride and pleasure, he is a master of art and"
2727,TO CANTERBURY[6],"learning, though affecting to despise it. Those who can think that"
2728,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the proud huntsman and noble housekeeper, Chaucer's Monk, is intended"
2729,TO CANTERBURY[6],"for a buffoon or burlesque character, know little of Chaucer."
2730,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2731,TO CANTERBURY[6],"For the Host who follows this group, and holds the centre of the"
2732,TO CANTERBURY[6],"cavalcade, is a first-rate character, and his jokes are no trifles;"
2733,TO CANTERBURY[6],"they are always, though uttered with audacity, and equally free with"
2734,TO CANTERBURY[6],the Lord and the Peasant--they are always substantially and weightily
2735,TO CANTERBURY[6],"expressive of knowledge and experience; Henry Baillie, the keeper of"
2736,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the greatest Inn of the greatest City, for such was the Tabarde Inn in"
2737,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Southwark near London, our Host, was also a leader of the age."
2738,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2739,TO CANTERBURY[6],By way of illustration I instance Shakespeare's Witches in _Macbeth_.
2740,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Those who dress them for the stage, consider them as wretched old"
2741,TO CANTERBURY[6],"women, and not, as Shakespeare intended, the Goddesses of Destiny;"
2742,TO CANTERBURY[6],this shows how Chaucer has been misunderstood in his sublime work.
2743,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Shakespeare's Fairies also are the rulers of the vegetable world, and"
2744,TO CANTERBURY[6],"so are Chaucer's; let them be so considered, and then the poet will be"
2745,TO CANTERBURY[6],"understood, and not else."
2746,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2747,TO CANTERBURY[6],"But I have omitted to speak of a very prominent character, the"
2748,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Pardoner, the Age's Knave, who always commands and domineers over the"
2749,TO CANTERBURY[6],high and low vulgar. This man is sent in every age for a rod and
2750,TO CANTERBURY[6],"scourge, and for a blight, for a trial of men, to divide the classes"
2751,TO CANTERBURY[6],"of men; he is in the most holy sanctuary, and he is suffered by"
2752,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Providence for wise ends, and has also his great use, and his grand"
2753,TO CANTERBURY[6],leading destiny.
2754,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2755,TO CANTERBURY[6],"His companion the Sompnour is also a Devil of the first magnitude,"
2756,TO CANTERBURY[6],"grand, terrific, rich, and honoured in the rank of which he holds the"
2757,TO CANTERBURY[6],destiny. The uses to society are perhaps equal of the Devil and of the
2758,TO CANTERBURY[6],Angel; their sublimity who can dispute?
2759,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2760,TO CANTERBURY[6],"In daunger had he at his own gise,"
2761,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The young girls of his diocese,"
2762,TO CANTERBURY[6],"And he knew well their counsel, &c."
2763,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2764,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The principal figure in the next group is the Good Parson; an Apostle,"
2765,TO CANTERBURY[6],"a real Messenger of Heaven, sent in every age for its light and its"
2766,TO CANTERBURY[6],"warmth. This man is beloved and venerated by all, and neglected by"
2767,TO CANTERBURY[6],"all: he serves all, and is served by none. He is, according to"
2768,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Christ's definition, the greatest of his age: yet he is a Poor Parson"
2769,TO CANTERBURY[6],"of a town. Read Chaucer's description of the Good Parson, and bow the"
2770,TO CANTERBURY[6],"head and the knee to Him, Who in every age sends us such a burning and"
2771,TO CANTERBURY[6],"a shining light. Search, O ye rich and powerful, for these men and"
2772,TO CANTERBURY[6],obey their counsel; then shall the golden age return. But alas! you
2773,TO CANTERBURY[6],will not easily distinguish him from the Friar or the Pardoner; they
2774,TO CANTERBURY[6],"also are 'full solemn men', and their counsel you will continue to"
2775,TO CANTERBURY[6],follow.
2776,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2777,TO CANTERBURY[6],"I have placed by his side the Sergeant-at-Lawe, who appears delighted"
2778,TO CANTERBURY[6],"to ride in his company, and between him and his brother the Ploughman;"
2779,TO CANTERBURY[6],"as I wish men of law would always ride with them, and take their"
2780,TO CANTERBURY[6],"counsel, especially in all difficult points. Chaucer's Lawyer is a"
2781,TO CANTERBURY[6],"character of great venerableness, a Judge and a real master of the"
2782,TO CANTERBURY[6],jurisprudence of his age.
2783,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2784,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Doctor of Physic is in this group; and the Franklin, the"
2785,TO CANTERBURY[6],"voluptuous country gentleman, contrasted with the Physician, and, on"
2786,TO CANTERBURY[6],"his other hand, with two Citizens of London. Chaucer's characters"
2787,TO CANTERBURY[6],live age after age. Every age is a Canterbury Pilgrimage; we all pass
2788,TO CANTERBURY[6],"on, each sustaining one of these characters; nor can a child be born"
2789,TO CANTERBURY[6],who is not one or other of these characters of Chaucer. The Doctor of
2790,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Physic is described as the first of his profession, perfect, learned,"
2791,TO CANTERBURY[6],completely Master and Doctor in his art. Thus the reader will observe
2792,TO CANTERBURY[6],that Chaucer makes every one of his characters perfect in his kind;
2793,TO CANTERBURY[6],"every one is an Antique Statue, the image of a class and not of an"
2794,TO CANTERBURY[6],imperfect individual.
2795,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2796,TO CANTERBURY[6],"This group also would furnish substantial matter, on which volumes"
2797,TO CANTERBURY[6],"might be written. The Franklin is one who keeps open table, who is the"
2798,TO CANTERBURY[6],"genius of eating and drinking, the Bacchus; as the Doctor of Physic is"
2799,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the Aesculapius, the Host is the Silenus, the Squire is the Apollo,"
2800,TO CANTERBURY[6],"the Miller is the Hercules, &c. Chaucer's characters are a description"
2801,TO CANTERBURY[6],of the eternal Principles that exist in all ages. The Franklin is
2802,TO CANTERBURY[6],"voluptuousness itself, most nobly portrayed:"
2803,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2804,TO CANTERBURY[6],It snewed in his house of meat and drink.
2805,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2806,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Ploughman is simplicity itself, with wisdom and strength for its"
2807,TO CANTERBURY[6],stamina. Chaucer has divided the ancient character of Hercules between
2808,TO CANTERBURY[6],his Miller and his Ploughman. Benevolence is the Ploughman's great
2809,TO CANTERBURY[6],"characteristic; he is thin with excessive labour, and not with old age"
2810,TO CANTERBURY[6],as some have supposed:
2811,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2812,TO CANTERBURY[6],"He would thresh, and thereto dike and delve,"
2813,TO CANTERBURY[6],"For Christe's sake, for every poore wight,"
2814,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Withouten hire, if it lay in his might."
2815,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2816,TO CANTERBURY[6],Visions of these eternal principles or characters of human life appear
2817,TO CANTERBURY[6],to poets in all ages; the Grecian gods were the ancient Cherubim of
2818,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Phoenicia; but the Greeks, and since them the Moderns, have neglected"
2819,TO CANTERBURY[6],to subdue the gods of Priam. These gods are visions of the eternal
2820,TO CANTERBURY[6],"attributes, or divine names, which, when erected into gods, become"
2821,TO CANTERBURY[6],"destructive to humanity. They ought to be the servants, and not the"
2822,TO CANTERBURY[6],masters of man or of society. They ought to be made to sacrifice to
2823,TO CANTERBURY[6],"man, and not man compelled to sacrifice to them; for, when separated"
2824,TO CANTERBURY[6],"from man or humanity, who is Jesus the Saviour, the Vine of Eternity?"
2825,TO CANTERBURY[6],"They are thieves and rebels, they are destroyers."
2826,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2827,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Ploughman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme Eternal State,"
2828,TO CANTERBURY[6],"divested of his Spectrous Shadow, which is the Miller, a terrible"
2829,TO CANTERBURY[6],"fellow, such as exists in all times and places for the trial of men,"
2830,TO CANTERBURY[6],"to astonish every neighbourhood with brutal strength and courage, to"
2831,TO CANTERBURY[6],"get rich and powerful, to curb the pride of Man."
2832,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2833,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Reeve and the Manciple are two characters of the most consummate
2834,TO CANTERBURY[6],"worldly wisdom. The Shipman, or Sailor, is a similar genius of"
2835,TO CANTERBURY[6],"Ulyssean art, but with the highest courage superadded."
2836,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2837,TO CANTERBURY[6],The Citizens and their Cook are each leaders of a class. Chaucer has
2838,TO CANTERBURY[6],"been somehow made to number four citizens, which would make his whole"
2839,TO CANTERBURY[6],"company, himself included, thirty-one. But he says there was but"
2840,TO CANTERBURY[6],nine-and-twenty in his company:
2841,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2842,TO CANTERBURY[6],Full nine and twenty in a company.
2843,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2844,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Webbe, or Weaver, and the Tapiser, or Tapestry Weaver, appear to"
2845,TO CANTERBURY[6],"me to be the same person; but this is only an opinion, for 'full nine"
2846,TO CANTERBURY[6],and twenty' may signify one more or less. But I daresay that Chaucer
2847,TO CANTERBURY[6],"wrote 'A Webbe Dyer', that is a Cloth Dyer:"
2848,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2849,TO CANTERBURY[6],A Webbe Dyer and a Tapiser.
2850,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2851,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The Merchant cannot be one of the Three Citizens, as his dress is"
2852,TO CANTERBURY[6],"different, and his character is more marked, whereas Chaucer says of"
2853,TO CANTERBURY[6],his rich citizens:
2854,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2855,TO CANTERBURY[6],All were yclothed in o liverie.
2856,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2857,TO CANTERBURY[6],"The characters of Women Chaucer has divided into two classes, the Lady"
2858,TO CANTERBURY[6],Prioress and the Wife of Bath. Are not these leaders of the ages of
2859,TO CANTERBURY[6],men? The Lady Prioress in some ages predominates; and in some the Wife
2860,TO CANTERBURY[6],"of Bath, in whose character Chaucer has been equally minute and exact;"
2861,TO CANTERBURY[6],because she is also a scourge and a blight. I shall say no more of
2862,TO CANTERBURY[6],"her, nor expose what Chaucer has left hidden; let the young reader"
2863,TO CANTERBURY[6],study what he has said of her: it is useful as a scarecrow. There are
2864,TO CANTERBURY[6],of such characters born too many for the peace of the world.
2865,TO CANTERBURY[6],
2866,TO CANTERBURY[6],I come at length to the Clerk of Oxenford. This character varies from
2867,TO CANTERBURY[6],"that of Chaucer, as the contemplative philosopher varies from the"
2868,TO CANTERBURY[6],"poetical genius. There are always these two classes of learned sages,"
2869,TO CANTERBURY[6],the poetical and the philosophical. The Painter has put them side by
2870,TO CANTERBURY[6],"side, as if the youthful clerk had put himself under the tuition of"
2871,TO CANTERBURY[6],the mature poet. Let the Philosopher always be the servant and scholar
2872,TO CANTERBURY[6],"of Inspiration, and all will be happy."

2931,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,imitation of the signs of these passions in the countenance or

2938,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"(without a metaphor) can speak, or the muscles utter intelligible"

2940,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"we take in at the eye and ear at a playhouse, compared with the slow"
2941,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"apprehension oftentimes of the understanding in reading, that we are"
2942,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,apt not only to sink the play-writer in the consideration which we pay
2943,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to the actor, but even to identify in our minds in a perverse manner,"
2944,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,the actor with the character which he represents. It is difficult for

2949,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,necessarily dependent upon the stage-player for all the pleasure which

2954,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
2955,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,[7] It is observable that we fall into this confusion only in

2965,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Never let me be so ungrateful as to forget the very high degree of

2983,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"fine passage, may be seen in those speeches from _Henry the Fifth_,"

2988,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"good, bad, or indifferent, it has been so handled and pawed about by"

2993,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"It may seem a paradox, but I cannot help being of opinion that the"
2994,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"plays of Shakespeare are less calculated for performance on a stage,"
2995,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,than those of almost any other dramatist whatever. Their distinguished
2996,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,excellence is a reason that they should be so. There is so much in
2997,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"them, which comes not under the province of acting, with which eye,"

3005,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"talk themselves out of it again, have always been the most popular"
3006,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"upon our stage. And the reason is plain, because the spectators are"

3008,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of words, they are the legitimate ring that should be formed round"

3048,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and therefore we judge it a fit subject of dramatic representation.

3050,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and therefore we consider it as a proper vehicle for conveying moral

3058,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"for the sake of the reader, who must else remain ignorant of what is"

3060,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"ruminations, which the tongue scarce dares utter to deaf walls and"
3061,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"chambers, how can they be represented by a gesticulating actor, who"
3062,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"comes and mouths them out before an audience, making four hundred"
3063,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,people his confidants at once? I say not that it is the fault of the
3064,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"actor so to do; he must pronounce them _ore rotundo_, he must"

3076,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,is made another thing by being acted. I have heard much of the wonders
3077,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"which Garrick performed in this part; but as I never saw him, I must"
3078,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,have leave to doubt whether the representation of such a character
3079,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"came within the province of his art. Those who tell me of him, speak"
3080,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of his eye, of the magic of his eye, and of his commanding voice:"
3081,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"physical properties, vastly desirable in an actor, and without which"
3082,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"he can never insinuate meaning into an auditory,--but what have they"
3083,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to do with Hamlet? what have they to do with intellect? In fact, the"
3084,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"things aimed at in theatrical representation, are to arrest the"
3085,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"spectator's eye upon the form and the gesture, and so to gain a more"
3086,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"favourable hearing to what is spoken: it is not what the character is,"
3087,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"but how he looks; not what he says, but how he speaks it. I see no"
3088,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,reason to think that if the play of _Hamlet_ were written over again
3089,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"by some such writer as Banks or Lillo, retaining the process of the"
3090,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"story, but totally omitting all the poetry of it, all the divine"
3091,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"features of Shakespeare, his stupendous intellect; and only taking"
3092,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"care to give us enough of passionate dialogue, which Banks or Lillo"
3093,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,were never at a loss to furnish; I see not how the effect could be
3094,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"much different upon an audience, nor how the actor has it in his power"
3095,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,to represent Shakespeare to us differently from his representation of
3096,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Banks or Lillo. Hamlet would still be a youthful accomplished prince,"
3097,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"and must be gracefully personated; he might be puzzled in his mind,"
3098,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"wavering in his conduct, seemingly-cruel to Ophelia, he might see a"
3099,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"ghost, and start at it, and address it kindly when he found it to be"
3100,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,his father; all this in the poorest and most homely language of the
3101,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,servilest creeper after nature that ever consulted the palate of an
3102,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,audience; without troubling Shakespeare for the matter: and I see not
3103,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"but there would be room for all the power which an actor has, to"
3104,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,display itself. All the passions and changes of passion might remain:
3105,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"for those are much less difficult to write or act than is thought, it"
3106,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"is a trick easy to be attained, it is but rising or falling a note or"
3107,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"two in the voice, a whisper with a significant foreboding look to"
3108,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"announce its approach, and so contagious the counterfeit appearance of"
3109,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"any emotion is, that let the words be what they will, the look and"
3110,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,tone shall carry it off and make it pass for deep skill in the
3111,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,passions.
3112,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3113,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,It is common for people to talk of Shakespeare's plays being _so
3114,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"natural_; that everybody can understand him. They are natural indeed,"
3115,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"they are grounded deep in nature, so deep that the depth of them lies"
3116,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,out of the reach of most of us. You shall hear the same persons say
3117,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"that George Barnwell is very natural, and Othello is very natural,"
3118,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,that they are both very deep; and to them they are the same kind of
3119,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"thing. At the one they sit and shed tears, because a good sort of"
3120,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,young man is tempted by a naughty woman to commit _a trifling
3121,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"peccadillo_, the murder of an uncle or so, that is all, and so comes"
3122,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to an untimely end, which is _so moving_; and at the other, because a"
3123,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,blackamoor in a fit of jealousy kills his innocent white wife: and the
3124,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,odds are that ninety-nine out of a hundred would willingly behold the
3125,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"same catastrophe happen to both the heroes, and have thought the rope"
3126,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,more due to Othello than to Barnwell. For of the texture of Othello's
3127,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"mind, the inward construction marvellously laid open with all its"
3128,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"strengths and weaknesses, its heroic confidences and its human"
3129,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"misgivings, its agonies of hate springing from the depths of love,"
3130,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"they see no more than the spectators at a cheaper rate, who pay their"
3131,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"pennies a-piece to look through the man's telescope in Leicester-fields,"
3132,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,see into the inward plot and topography of the moon. Some dim thing or
3133,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"other they see, they see an actor personating a passion, of grief, or"
3134,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"anger, for instance, and they recognize it as a copy of the usual"
3135,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,external effects of such passions; for at least as being true to _that
3136,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"symbol of the emotion which passes current at the theatre for it_, for"
3137,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it is often no more than that: but of the grounds of the passion, its"
3138,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"correspondence to a great or heroic nature, which is the only worthy"
3139,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"object of tragedy,--that common auditors know any thing of this, or"
3140,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,can have any such notions dinned into them by the mere strength of an
3141,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"actor's lungs,--that apprehensions foreign to them should be thus"
3142,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"infused into them by storm, I can neither believe, nor understand how"
3143,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,it can be possible.
3144,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3145,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"We talk of Shakespeare's admirable observation of life, when we should"
3146,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"feel, that not from a petty inquisition into those cheap and every-day"
3147,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"characters which surrounded him, as they surround us, but from his own"
3148,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"mind, which was, to borrow a phrase of Ben Jonson's, the very 'sphere"
3149,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of humanity', he fetched those images of virtue and of knowledge, of"
3150,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"which every one of us recognizing a part, think we comprehend in our"
3151,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,natures the whole; and oftentimes mistake the powers which he
3152,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"positively creates in us, for nothing more than indigenous faculties"
3153,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,of our own minds which only waited the action of corresponding virtues
3154,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,in him to return a full and clear echo of the same.
3155,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3156,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,To return to Hamlet.--Among the distinguishing features of that
3157,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"wonderful character, one of the most interesting (yet painful) is that"
3158,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,soreness of mind which makes him treat the intrusions of Polonius
3159,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"with harshness, and that asperity which he puts on in his interviews"
3160,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,with Ophelia. These tokens of an unhinged mind (if they be not mixed
3161,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"in the latter case with a profound artifice of love, to alienate"
3162,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Ophelia by affected discourtesies, so to prepare her mind for the"
3163,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"breaking off of that loving intercourse, which can no longer find a"
3164,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,place amidst business so serious as that which he has to do) are parts
3165,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of his character, which to reconcile with our admiration of Hamlet,"
3166,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,the most patient consideration of his situation is no more than
3167,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"necessary; they are what we _forgive afterwards_, and explain by the"
3168,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"whole of his character, but _at the time_ they are harsh and"
3169,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,unpleasant. Yet such is the actor's necessity of giving strong blows
3170,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to the audience, that I have never seen a player in this character,"
3171,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,who did not exaggerate and strain to the utmost these ambiguous
3172,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"features,--these temporary deformities in the character. They make him"
3173,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,express a vulgar scorn at Polonius which utterly degrades his
3174,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"gentility, and which no explanation can render palatable; they make"
3175,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"him show contempt, and curl up the nose at Ophelia's father,--contempt"
3176,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,in its very grossest and most hateful form; but they get applause by
3177,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it: it is natural, people say; that is, the words are scornful, and"
3178,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the actor expresses scorn, and that they can judge of: but why so much"
3179,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"scorn, and of that sort, they never think of asking."
3180,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3181,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"So to Ophelia.--All the Hamlets that I have ever seen, rant and rave"
3182,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"at her as if she had committed some great crime, and the audience are"
3183,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"highly pleased, because the words of the part are satirical, and they"
3184,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,are enforced by the strongest expression of satirical indignation of
3185,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"which the face and voice are capable. But then, whether Hamlet is"
3186,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,likely to have put on such brutal appearances to a lady whom he loved
3187,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"so dearly, is never thought on. The truth is, that in all such deep"
3188,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"affections as had subsisted between Hamlet and Ophelia, there is a"
3189,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"stock of _supererogatory love_, (if I may venture to use the"
3190,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"expression) which in any great grief of heart, especially where that"
3191,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"which preys upon the mind cannot be communicated, confers a kind of"
3192,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"indulgence upon the grieved party to express itself, even to its"
3193,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"heart's dearest object, in the language of a temporary alienation; but"
3194,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it is not alienation, it is a distraction purely, and so it always"
3195,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"makes itself to be felt by that object: it is not anger, but grief"
3196,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"assuming the appearance of anger,--love awkwardly counterfeiting hate,"
3197,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,as sweet countenances when they try to frown: but such sternness and
3198,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"fierce disgust as Hamlet is made to show, is no counterfeit, but the"
3199,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"real face of absolute aversion,--of irreconcilable alienation. It may"
3200,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,be said he puts on the madman; but then he should only so far put on
3201,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,this counterfeit lunacy as his own real distraction will give him
3202,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"leave; that is, incompletely, imperfectly; not in that confirmed"
3203,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"practised way, like a master of his art, or, as Dame Quickly would"
3204,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"say, 'like one of those harlotry players.'"
3205,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3206,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"I mean no disrespect to any actor, but the sort of pleasure which"
3207,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Shakespeare's plays give in the acting seems to me not at all to
3208,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,differ from that which the audience receive from those of other
3209,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"writers; and, _they being in themselves essentially so different from"
3210,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"all others_, I must conclude that there is something in the nature of"
3211,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"acting which levels all distinctions. And in fact, who does not speak"
3212,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,indifferently of the _Gamester_ and of _Macbeth_ as fine stage
3213,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"performances, and praise the Mrs. Beverley in the same way as the Lady"
3214,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Macbeth of Mrs. S.? Belvidera, and Calista, and Isabella, and"
3215,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Euphrasia, are they less liked than Imogen, or than Juliet, or than"
3216,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Desdemona? Are they not spoken of and remembered in the same way? Is
3217,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,not the female performer as great (as they call it) in one as in the
3218,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"other? Did not Garrick shine, and was not he ambitious of shining in"
3219,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"every drawling tragedy that his wretched day produced,--the"
3220,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"productions of the Hills and the Murphys and the Browns,--and shall he"
3221,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,have that honour to dwell in our minds for ever as an inseparable
3222,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,concomitant with Shakespeare? A kindred mind! O who can read that
3223,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,affecting sonnet of Shakespeare which alludes to his profession as a
3224,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,player:
3225,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3226,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Oh for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
3227,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
3228,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,That did not better for my life provide
3229,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Than public means which public custom breeds--
3230,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;
3231,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,And almost thence my nature is subdued
3232,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"To what it works in, like the dyer's hand--"
3233,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3234,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Or that other confession:
3235,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3236,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,"
3237,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"And made myself a motley to thy view,"
3238,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear--"
3239,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3240,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Who can read these instances of jealous self-watchfulness in our sweet
3241,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Shakespeare, and dream of any congeniality between him and one that,"
3242,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"by every tradition of him, appears to have been as mere a player as"
3243,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,ever existed; to have had his mind tainted with the lowest players'
3244,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"vices,--envy and jealousy, and miserable cravings after applause; one"
3245,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,who in the exercise of his profession was jealous even of the
3246,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,women-performers that stood in his way; a manager full of managerial
3247,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,tricks and stratagems and finesse: that any resemblance should be
3248,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"dreamed of between him and Shakespeare,--Shakespeare who, in the"
3249,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"plenitude and consciousness of his own powers, could with that noble"
3250,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"modesty, which we can neither imitate nor appreciate, express himself"
3251,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,thus of his own sense of his own defects:
3252,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3253,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
3254,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Featur'd like him, like him with friends possest;"
3255,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Desiring _this man's art, and that man's scope_."
3256,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3257,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,I am almost disposed to deny to Garrick the merit of being an admirer
3258,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,of Shakespeare. A true lover of his excellences he certainly was not;
3259,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,for would any true lover of them have admitted into his matchless
3260,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"scenes such ribald trash as Tate and Cibber, and the rest of them,"
3261,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,that
3262,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3263,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"With their darkness durst affront his light,"
3264,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3265,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,have foisted into the acting plays of Shakespeare? I believe it
3266,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"impossible that he could have had a proper reverence for Shakespeare,"
3267,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and have condescended to go through that interpolated scene in Richard
3268,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the Third, in which Richard tries to break his wife's heart by telling"
3269,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"her he loves another woman, and says, 'if she survives this she is"
3270,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,immortal.' Yet I doubt not he delivered this vulgar stuff with as much
3271,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"anxiety of emphasis as any of the genuine parts; and for acting, it is"
3272,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,as well calculated as any. But we have seen the part of Richard lately
3273,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"produce great fame to an actor by his manner of playing it, and it"
3274,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"lets us into the secret of acting, and of popular judgements of"
3275,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Shakespeare derived from acting. Not one of the spectators who have
3276,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"witnessed Mr. C.'s exertions in that part, but has come away with a"
3277,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"proper conviction that Richard is a very wicked man, and kills little"
3278,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"children in their beds, with something like the pleasure which the"
3279,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,giants and ogres in children's books are represented to have taken in
3280,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"that practice; moreover, that he is very close and shrewd and devilish"
3281,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"cunning, for you could see that by his eye."
3282,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3283,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,But is in fact this the impression we have in reading the Richard of
3284,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Shakespeare? Do we feel anything like disgust, as we do at that"
3285,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,butcher-like representation of him that passes for him on the stage? A
3286,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"horror at his crimes blends with the effect which we feel, but how is"
3287,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it qualified, how is it carried off, by the rich intellect which he"
3288,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"displays, his resources, his wit, his buoyant spirits, his vast"
3289,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"knowledge and insight into characters, the poetry of his part,--not an"
3290,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,atom of all which is made perceivable in Mr. C.'s way of acting it.
3291,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Nothing but his crimes, his actions, is visible; they are prominent"
3292,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"and staring; the murderer stands out, but where is the lofty genius,"
3293,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the man of vast capacity,--the profound, the witty, accomplished"
3294,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Richard?
3295,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3296,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"The truth is, the Characters of Shakespeare are so much the objects of"
3297,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"meditation rather than of interest or curiosity as to their actions,"
3298,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"that while we are reading any of his great criminal characters,--Macbeth,"
3299,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Richard, even Iago,--we think not so much of the crimes which they"
3300,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"commit, as of the ambition, the aspiring spirit, the intellectual"
3301,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"activity, which prompts them to overleap those moral fences. Barnwell"
3302,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,is a wretched murderer; there is a certain fitness between his neck
3303,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and the rope; he is the legitimate heir to the gallows; nobody who
3304,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,thinks at all can think of any alleviating circumstances in his case
3305,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,to make him a fit object of mercy. Or to take an instance from the
3306,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"higher tragedy, what else but a mere assassin is Glenalvon! Do we"
3307,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"think of anything but of the crime which he commits, and the rack"
3308,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which he deserves? That is all which we really think about him.
3309,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Whereas in corresponding characters in Shakespeare so little do the
3310,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"actions comparatively affect us, that while the impulses, the inner"
3311,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"mind in all its perverted greatness, solely seems real and is"
3312,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"exclusively attended to, the crime is comparatively nothing. But when"
3313,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"we see these things represented, the acts which they do are"
3314,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"comparatively everything, their impulses nothing. The state of sublime"
3315,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,emotion into which we are elevated by those images of night and horror

3317,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,entertains the time till the bell shall strike which is to call him to
3318,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"murder Duncan,--when we no longer read it in a book, when we have"
3319,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,given up that vantage-ground of abstraction which reading possesses
3320,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"over seeing, and come to see a man in his bodily shape before our eyes"
3321,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"actually preparing to commit a murder, if the acting be true and"
3322,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"impressive, as I have witnessed it in Mr. K.'s performance of that"
3323,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"part, the painful anxiety about the act, the natural longing to"
3324,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"prevent it while it yet seems unperpetrated, the too close pressing"
3325,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"semblance of reality, give a pain and an uneasiness which totally"
3326,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"destroy all the delight which the words in the book convey, where the"
3327,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,deed doing never presses upon us with the painful sense of presence:
3328,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it rather seems to belong to history,--to something past and"
3329,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"inevitable, if it has anything to do with time at all. The sublime"
3330,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"images, the poetry alone, is that which is present to our minds in the"
3331,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,reading.
3332,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3333,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,So to see Lear acted--to see an old man tottering about the stage with
3334,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"a walking-stick, turned out of doors by his daughters in a rainy"
3335,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting. We want"
3336,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,to take him into shelter and relieve him. That is all the feeling
3337,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which the acting of Lear ever produced in me. But the Lear of
3338,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Shakespeare cannot be acted. The contemptible machinery by which they
3339,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"mimic the storm which he goes out in, is not more inadequate to"
3340,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"represent the horrors of the real elements, than any actor can be to"
3341,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,represent Lear: they might more easily propose to personate the Satan
3342,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of Milton upon a stage, or one of Michael Angelo's terrible figures."
3343,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"The greatness of Lear is not in corporal dimension, but in"
3344,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,intellectual: the explosions of his passion are terrible as a volcano:
3345,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"they are storms turning up and disclosing to the bottom that sea, his"
3346,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"mind, with all its vast riches. It is his mind which is laid bare."
3347,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,This case of flesh and blood seems too insignificant to be thought on;
3348,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,even as he himself neglects it. On the stage we see nothing but
3349,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"corporal infirmities and weakness, the impotence of rage; while we"
3350,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"read it, we see not Lear, but we are Lear,--we are in his mind, we are"
3351,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters and
3352,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"storms; in the aberrations of his reason, we discover a mighty"
3353,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"irregular power of reasoning, immethodized from the ordinary purposes"
3354,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of life, but exerting its powers, as the wind blows where it listeth,"
3355,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"at will upon the corruptions and abuses of mankind. What have looks,"
3356,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"or tones, to do with that sublime identification of his age with that"
3357,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of the _heavens themselves_, when in his reproaches to them for"
3358,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"conniving at the injustice of his children, he reminds them that 'they"
3359,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,themselves are old'. What gesture shall we appropriate to this? What
3360,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,has the voice or the eye to do with such things? But the play is
3361,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"beyond all art, as the tamperings with it show: it is too hard and"
3362,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"stony; it must have love-scenes, and a happy ending. It is not enough"
3363,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"that Cordelia is a daughter, she must shine as a lover too. Tate has"
3364,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"put his hook in the nostrils of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his"
3365,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"followers, the showmen of the scene, to draw the mighty beast about"
3366,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,more easily. A happy ending!--as if the living martyrdom that Lear had
3367,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"gone through,--the flaying of his feelings alive, did not make a fair"
3368,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him. If
3369,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"he is to live and be happy after, if he could sustain this world's"
3370,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"burden after, why all this pudder and preparation,--why torment us"
3371,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,with all this unnecessary sympathy? As if the childish pleasure of
3372,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,getting his gilt robes and sceptre again could tempt him to act over
3373,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"again his misused station,--as if at his years, and with his"
3374,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"experience, anything was left but to die."
3375,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3376,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Lear is essentially impossible to be represented on a stage. But how
3377,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"many dramatic personages are there in Shakespeare, which though more"
3378,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"tractable and feasible (if I may so speak) than Lear, yet from some"
3379,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"circumstance, some adjunct to their character, are improper to be"
3380,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,shown to our bodily eye. Othello for instance. Nothing can be more
3381,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"soothing, more flattering to the nobler parts of our natures, than to"
3382,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"read of a young Venetian lady of highest extraction, through the force"
3383,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of love and from a sense of merit in him whom she loved, laying aside"
3384,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"every consideration of kindred, and country, and colour, and wedding"
3385,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"with _a coal-black Moor_--(for such he is represented, in the"
3386,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,imperfect state of knowledge respecting foreign countries in those
3387,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"days, compared with our own, or in compliance with popular notions,"
3388,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,though the Moors are now well enough known to be by many shades less
3389,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,unworthy of a white woman's fancy)--it is the perfect triumph of
3390,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"virtue over accidents, of the imagination over the senses. She sees"
3391,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Othello's colour in his mind. But upon the stage, when the imagination"
3392,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"is no longer the ruling faculty, but we are left to our poor"
3393,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"unassisted senses, I appeal to every one that has seen Othello played,"
3394,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"whether he did not, on the contrary, sink Othello's mind in his"
3395,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,colour; whether he did not find something extremely revolting in the
3396,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,courtship and wedded caresses of Othello and Desdemona; and whether
3397,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,the actual sight of the thing did not over-weigh all that beautiful
3398,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,compromise which we make in reading;--and the reason it should do so
3399,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"is obvious, because there is just so much reality presented to our"
3400,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"senses as to give a perception of disagreement, with not enough of"
3401,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,belief in the internal motives--all that which is unseen--to overpower
3402,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and reconcile the first and obvious prejudices.[8] What we see upon a
3403,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,stage is body and bodily action; what we are conscious of in reading
3404,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"is almost exclusively the mind, and its movements: and this I think"
3405,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,may sufficiently account for the very different sort of delight with
3406,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which the same play so often affects us in the reading and the seeing.
3407,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3408,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,[8] The error of supposing that because Othello's colour does
3409,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"not offend us in the reading, it should also not offend us in"
3410,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the seeing, is just such a fallacy as supposing that an Adam"
3411,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,and Eve in a picture shall affect us just as they do in the
3412,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,poem. But in the poem we for a while have Paradisaical senses
3413,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"given us, which vanish when we see a man and his wife without"
3414,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"clothes in the picture. The painters themselves feel this, as"
3415,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"is apparent by the awkward shifts they have recourse to, to"
3416,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,make them look not quite naked; by a sort of prophetic
3417,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"anachronism, antedating the invention of fig-leaves. So in"
3418,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the reading of the play, we see with Desdemona's eyes; in the"
3419,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"seeing of it, we are forced to look with our own."
3420,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3421,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"It requires little reflection to perceive, that if those characters in"
3422,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Shakespeare which are within the precincts of nature, have yet"
3423,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"something in them which appeals too exclusively to the imagination, to"
3424,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,admit of their being made objects to the senses without suffering a
3425,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"change and a diminution,--that still stronger the objection must lie"
3426,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"against representing another line of characters, which Shakespeare has"
3427,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,introduced to give a wildness and a supernatural elevation to his
3428,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"scenes, as if to remove them still farther from that assimilation to"
3429,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,common life in which their excellence is vulgarly supposed to consist.
3430,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,When we read the incantations of those terrible beings the Witches in
3431,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"_Macbeth_, though some of the ingredients of their hellish composition"
3432,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"savour of the grotesque, yet is the effect upon us other than the most"
3433,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,serious and appalling that can be imagined? Do we not feel spell-bound
3434,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,as Macbeth was? Can any mirth accompany a sense of their presence? We
3435,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,might as well laugh under a consciousness of the principle of Evil
3436,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,himself being truly and really present with us. But attempt to bring
3437,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"these beings on to a stage, and you turn them instantly into so many"
3438,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"old women, that men and children are to laugh at. Contrary to the old"
3439,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"saying, that 'seeing is believing', the sight actually destroys the"
3440,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"faith; and the mirth in which we indulge at their expense, when we see"
3441,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"these creatures upon a stage, seems to be a sort of indemnification"
3442,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which we make to ourselves for the terror which they put us in when
3443,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"reading made them an object of belief,--when we surrendered up our"
3444,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"reason to the poet, as children, to their nurses and their elders; and"
3445,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"we laugh at our fears, as children who thought they saw something in"
3446,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the dark, triumph when the bringing in of a candle discovers the"
3447,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,vanity of their fears. For this exposure of supernatural agents upon a
3448,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,stage is truly bringing in a candle to expose their own delusiveness.
3449,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,It is the solitary taper and the book that generates a faith in these
3450,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"terrors: a ghost by chandelier light, and in good company, deceives no"
3451,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"spectators,--a ghost that can be measured by the eye, and his human"
3452,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"dimensions made out at leisure. The sight of a well-lighted house, and"
3453,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"a well-dressed audience, shall arm the most nervous child against any"
3454,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,apprehensions: as Tom Brown says of the impenetrable skin of Achilles
3455,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"with his impenetrable armour over it, 'Bully Dawson would have fought"
3456,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,the devil with such advantages.'
3457,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3458,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Much has been said, and deservedly, in reprobation of the vile mixture"
3459,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which Dryden has thrown into the _Tempest_: doubtless without some
3460,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"such vicious alloy, the impure ears of that age would never have sate"
3461,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,out to hear so much innocence of love as is contained in the sweet
3462,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,courtship of Ferdinand and Miranda. But is the _Tempest_ of
3463,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,Shakespeare at all a subject for stage representation? It is one thing
3464,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to read of an enchanter, and to believe the wondrous tale while we are"
3465,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,reading it; but to have a conjurer brought before us in his
3466,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"conjuring-gown, with his spirits about him, which none but himself and"
3467,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,some hundred of favoured spectators before the curtain are supposed to
3468,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"see, involves such a quantity of the _hateful incredible_, that all"
3469,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,our reverence for the author cannot hinder us from perceiving such
3470,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,gross attempts upon the senses to be in the highest degree childish
3471,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"and inefficient. Spirits and fairies cannot be represented, they"
3472,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"cannot even be painted,--they can only be believed. But the elaborate"
3473,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"and anxious provision of scenery, which the luxury of the age demands,"
3474,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,in these cases works a quite contrary effect to what is intended. That
3475,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"which in comedy, or plays of familiar life, adds so much to the life"
3476,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of the imitation, in plays which appeal to the higher faculties,"
3477,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,positively destroys the illusion which it is introduced to aid. A
3478,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"parlour or a drawing-room,--a library opening into a garden,--a garden"
3479,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"with an alcove in it,--a street, or the piazza of Covent Garden, does"
3480,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,well enough in a scene; we are content to give as much credit to it as
3481,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"it demands; or rather, we think little about it,--it is little more"
3482,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"than reading at the top of a page, 'Scene, a Garden;' we do not"
3483,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"imagine ourselves there, but we readily admit the imitation of"
3484,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,familiar objects. But to think by the help of painted trees and
3485,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"caverns, which we know to be painted, to transport our minds to"
3486,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Prospero, and his island and his lonely cell;[9] or by the aid of a"
3487,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"fiddle dexterously thrown in, in an interval of speaking, to make us"
3488,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,believe that we hear those supernatural noises of which the isle was
3489,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"full:--the Orrery Lecturer at the Haymarket might as well hope, by his"
3490,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"musical glasses cleverly stationed out of sight behind his apparatus,"
3491,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,to make us believe that we do indeed hear the chrystal spheres ring
3492,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"out that chime, which if it were to inwrap our fancy long, Milton"
3493,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"thinks,"
3494,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3495,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Time would run back and fetch the age of gold,"
3496,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,And speckled vanity
3497,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Would sicken soon and die,"
3498,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,And leprous Sin would melt from earthly mould;
3499,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Yea Hell itself would pass away,"
3500,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,And leave its dolorous mansions to the peering day.
3501,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3502,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"The Garden of Eden, with our first parents in it, is not more"
3503,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"impossible to be shown on a stage, than the Enchanted Isle, with its"
3504,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,no less interesting and innocent first settlers.
3505,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3506,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,[9] It will be said these things are done in pictures. But
3507,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,pictures and scenes are very different things. Painting is a
3508,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"world of itself, but in scene-painting there is the attempt"
3509,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"to deceive; and there is the discordancy, never to be got"
3510,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"over, between painted scenes and real people."
3511,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3512,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"The subject of Scenery is closely connected with that of the Dresses,"
3513,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,which are so anxiously attended to on our stage. I remember the last
3514,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"time I saw Macbeth played, the discrepancy I felt at the changes of"
3515,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"garment which he varied--the shiftings and re-shiftings, like a Romish"
3516,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"priest at mass. The luxury of stage-improvements, and the importunity"
3517,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"of the public eye, require this. The coronation robe of the Scottish"
3518,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,monarch was fairly a counterpart to that which our king wears when he
3519,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"goes to the Parliament-house,--just so full and cumbersome, and set"
3520,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"out with ermine and pearls. And if things must be represented, I see"
3521,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"not what to find fault with in this. But in reading, what robe are we"
3522,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"conscious of? Some dim images of royalty--a crown and sceptre, may"
3523,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"float before our eyes, but who shall describe the fashion of it? Do we"
3524,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,see in our mind's eye what Webb or any other robe-maker could pattern?
3525,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"This is the inevitable consequence of imitating everything, to make"
3526,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,all things natural. Whereas the reading of a tragedy is a fine
3527,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,abstraction. It presents to the fancy just so much of external
3528,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"appearances as to make us feel that we are among flesh and blood,"
3529,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,while by far the greater and better part of our imagination is
3530,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,employed upon the thoughts and internal machinery of the character.
3531,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"But in acting, scenery, dress, the most contemptible things, call upon"
3532,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,us to judge of their naturalness.
3533,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,
3534,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"Perhaps it would be no bad similitude, to liken the pleasure which we"
3535,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"take in seeing one of these fine plays acted, compared with that quiet"
3536,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"delight which we find in the reading of it, to the different feelings"
3537,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"with which a reviewer, and a man that is not a reviewer, reads a fine"
3538,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"poem. The accursed critical habit,--the being called upon to judge and"
3539,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"pronounce, must make it quite a different thing to the former. In"
3540,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"seeing these plays acted, we are affected just as judges. When Hamlet"
3541,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"compares the two pictures of Gertrude's first and second husband, who"
3542,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"wants to see the pictures? But in the acting, a miniature must be"
3543,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"lugged out; which we know not to be the picture, but only to show how"
3544,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"finely a miniature may be represented. This showing of everything,"
3545,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"levels all things: it makes tricks, bows, and curtesies, of"
3546,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,importance. Mrs. S. never got more fame by anything than by the
3547,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,manner in which she dismisses the guests in the banquet-scene in
3548,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,_Macbeth_: it is as much remembered as any of her thrilling tones or
3549,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,impressive looks. But does such a trifle as this enter into the
3550,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,imaginations of the readers of that wild and wonderful scene? Does not
3551,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,the mind dismiss the feasters as rapidly as it can? Does it care about
3552,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"the gracefulness of the doing it? But by acting, and judging of"
3553,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,"acting, all these non-essentials are raised into an importance,"
3554,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,injurious to the main interest of the play.
3555,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION,

3574,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"According to one mode of regarding those two classes of mental action,"
3575,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"which are called reason and imagination, the former may be considered"
3576,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"as mind contemplating the relations borne by one thought to another,"
3577,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"however produced; and the latter, as mind acting upon those thoughts"
3578,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"so as to colour them with its own light, and composing from them, as"
3579,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"from elements, other thoughts, each containing within itself the"
3580,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"principle of its own integrity. The one is the [Greek: to poiein], or"
3581,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the principle of synthesis, and has for its objects those forms which"
3582,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),are common to universal nature and existence itself; the other is the
3583,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"[Greek: to logizein], or principle of analysis, and its action regards"
3584,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the relations of things, simply as relations; considering thoughts,"
3585,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"not in their integral unity, but as the algebraical representations"
3586,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which conduct to certain general results. Reason is the enumeration of
3587,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),quantities already known; imagination is the perception of the value
3588,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of those quantities, both separately and as a whole. Reason respects"
3589,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the differences, and imagination the similitudes of things. Reason is"
3590,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"to the imagination as the instrument to the agent, as the body to the"
3591,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"spirit, as the shadow to the substance."
3592,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3593,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be 'the expression of"
3594,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the imagination': and poetry is connate with the origin of man. Man is
3595,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),an instrument over which a series of external and internal impressions
3596,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"are driven, like the alternations of an ever-changing wind over an"
3597,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Aeolian lyre, which move it by their motion to ever-changing melody."
3598,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"But there is a principle within the human being, and perhaps within"
3599,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"all sentient beings, which acts otherwise than in the lyre, and"
3600,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"produces not melody alone, but harmony, by an internal adjustment of"
3601,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the sounds or motions thus excited to the impressions which excite
3602,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),them. It is as if the lyre could accommodate its chords to the motions
3603,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of that which strikes them, in a determined proportion of sound; even"
3604,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),as the musician can accommodate his voice to the sound of the lyre. A
3605,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),child at play by itself will express its delight by its voice and
3606,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),motions; and every inflexion of tone and every gesture will bear exact
3607,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),relation to a corresponding antitype in the pleasurable impressions
3608,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which awakened it; it will be the reflected image of that impression;
3609,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and as the lyre trembles and sounds after the wind has died away, so"
3610,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the child seeks, by prolonging in its voice and motions the duration"
3611,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the effect, to prolong also a consciousness of the cause. In"
3612,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"relation to the objects which delight a child, these expressions are,"
3613,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),what poetry is to higher objects. The savage (for the savage is to
3614,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),ages what the child is to years) expresses the emotions produced in
3615,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),him by surrounding objects in a similar manner; and language and
3616,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"gesture, together with plastic or pictorial imitation, become the"
3617,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"image of the combined effect of those objects, and of his apprehension"
3618,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of them. Man in society, with all his passions and his pleasures,"
3619,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),next becomes the object of the passions and pleasures of man; an
3620,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),additional class of emotions produces an augmented treasure of
3621,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"expressions; and language, gesture, and the imitative arts, become at"
3622,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"once the representation and the medium, the pencil and the picture,"
3623,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the chisel and the statue, the chord and the harmony. The social"
3624,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sympathies, or those laws from which, as from its elements, society"
3625,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"results, begin to develop themselves from the moment that two human"
3626,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"beings coexist; the future is contained within the present, as the"
3627,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"plant within the seed; and equality, diversity, unity, contrast,"
3628,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"mutual dependence, become the principles alone capable of affording"
3629,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the motives according to which the will of a social being is
3630,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"determined to action, inasmuch as he is social; and constitute"
3631,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"pleasure in sensation, virtue in sentiment, beauty in art, truth in"
3632,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"reasoning, and love in the intercourse of kind. Hence men, even in the"
3633,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"infancy of society, observe a certain order in their words and"
3634,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"actions, distinct from that of the objects and the impressions"
3635,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"represented by them, all expression being subject to the laws of that"
3636,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),from which it proceeds. But let us dismiss those more general
3637,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),considerations which might involve an inquiry into the principles of
3638,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"society itself, and restrict our view to the manner in which the"
3639,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),imagination is expressed upon its forms.
3640,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3641,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and imitate natural"
3642,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"objects, observing in these actions, as in all others, a certain"
3643,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"rhythm or order. And, although all men observe a similar, they observe"
3644,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"not the same order, in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the"
3645,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"song, in the combinations of language, in the series of their"
3646,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),imitations of natural objects. For there is a certain order or rhythm
3647,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"belonging to each of these classes of mimetic representation, from"
3648,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which the hearer and the spectator receive an intenser and purer
3649,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),pleasure than from any other: the sense of an approximation to this
3650,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),order has been called taste by modern writers. Every man in the
3651,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),infancy of art observes an order which approximates more or less
3652,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),closely to that from which this highest delight results: but the
3653,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"diversity is not sufficiently marked, as that its gradations should be"
3654,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sensible, except in those instances where the predominance of this"
3655,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),faculty of approximation to the beautiful (for so we may be permitted
3656,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to name the relation between this highest pleasure and its cause) is
3657,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"very great. Those in whom it exists in excess are poets, in the most"
3658,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universal sense of the word; and the pleasure resulting from the
3659,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),manner in which they express the influence of society or nature upon
3660,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"their own minds, communicates itself to others, and gathers a sort of"
3661,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),reduplication from that community. Their language is vitally
3662,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"metaphorical; that is, it marks the before unapprehended relations of"
3663,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"things and perpetuates their apprehension, until the words which"
3664,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"represent them become, through time, signs for portions or classes of"
3665,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then if no new
3666,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been
3667,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"thus disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of"
3668,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),human intercourse. These similitudes or relations are finely said by
3669,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Lord Bacon to be 'the same footsteps of nature impressed upon the
3670,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),various subjects of the world';[10] and he considers the faculty
3671,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which perceives them as the storehouse of axioms common to all
3672,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),knowledge. In the infancy of society every author is necessarily a
3673,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poet, because language itself is poetry; and to be a poet is to"
3674,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"apprehend the true and the beautiful, in a word, the good which exists"
3675,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"in the relation, subsisting, first between existence and perception,"
3676,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and secondly between perception and expression. Every original
3677,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),language near to its source is in itself the chaos of a cyclic poem:
3678,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar are
3679,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the works of a later age, and are merely the catalogue and the form of"
3680,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the creations of poetry.
3681,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3682,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"[10] _De Augment. Scient._, cap. i, lib. iii."
3683,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3684,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"But poets, or those who imagine and express this indestructible order,"
3685,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"are not only the authors of language and of music, of the dance, and"
3686,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"architecture, and statuary, and painting; they are the institutors of"
3687,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"laws, and the founders of civil society, and the inventors of the arts"
3688,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of life, and the teachers who draw into a certain propinquity with the"
3689,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"beautiful and the true, that partial apprehension of the agencies of"
3690,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the invisible world which is called religion. Hence all original
3691,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"religions are allegorical, or susceptible of allegory, and, like"
3692,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Janus, have a double face of false and true. Poets, according to the"
3693,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"circumstances of the age and nation in which they appeared, were"
3694,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"called, in the earlier epochs of the world, legislators, or prophets:"
3695,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),a poet essentially comprises and unites both these characters. For he
3696,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"not only beholds intensely the present as it is, and discovers those"
3697,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"laws according to which present things ought to be ordered, but he"
3698,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"beholds the future in the present, and his thoughts are the germs of"
3699,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the flower and the fruit of latest time. Not that I assert poets to
3700,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"be prophets in the gross sense of the word, or that they can foretell"
3701,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the form as surely as they foreknow the spirit of events: such is the
3702,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"pretence of superstition, which would make poetry an attribute of"
3703,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"prophecy, rather than prophecy an attribute of poetry. A poet"
3704,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"participates in the eternal, the infinite, and the one; as far as"
3705,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"relates to his conceptions, time and place and number are not. The"
3706,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"grammatical forms which express the moods of time, and the difference"
3707,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of persons, and the distinction of place, are convertible with respect"
3708,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to the highest poetry without injuring it as poetry; and the choruses
3709,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of Aeschylus, and the book of _Job_, and Dante's _Paradise_, would"
3710,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"afford, more than any other writings, examples of this fact, if the"
3711,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),limits of this essay did not forbid citation. The creations of
3712,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sculpture, painting, and music, are illustrations still more decisive."
3713,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3714,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Language, colour, form, and religious and civil habits of action, are"
3715,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),all the instruments and materials of poetry; they may be called poetry
3716,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a synonym of
3717,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those
3718,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"arrangements of language, and especially metrical language, which are"
3719,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"created by that imperial faculty, whose throne is curtained within the"
3720,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),invisible nature of man. And this springs from the nature itself of
3721,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language, which is a more direct representation of the actions and"
3722,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"passions of our internal being, and is susceptible of more various and"
3723,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"delicate combinations, than colour, form, or motion, and is more"
3724,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),plastic and obedient to the control of that faculty of which it is the
3725,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"creation. For language is arbitrarily produced by the imagination, and"
3726,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"has relation to thoughts alone; but all other materials, instruments,"
3727,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and conditions of art, have relations among each other, which limit"
3728,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and interpose between conception and expression. The former is as a
3729,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"mirror which reflects, the latter as a cloud which enfeebles, the"
3730,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),light of which both are mediums of communication. Hence the fame of
3731,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sculptors, painters, and musicians, although the intrinsic powers of"
3732,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the great masters of these arts may yield in no degree to that of
3733,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),those who have employed language as the hieroglyphic of their
3734,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"thoughts, has never equalled that of poets in the restricted sense of"
3735,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the term; as two performers of equal skill will produce unequal
3736,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),effects from a guitar and a harp. The fame of legislators and founders
3737,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of religions, so long as their institutions last, alone seems to"
3738,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),exceed that of poets in the restricted sense; but it can scarcely be a
3739,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"question, whether, if we deduct the celebrity which their flattery of"
3740,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the gross opinions of the vulgar usually conciliates, together with"
3741,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that which belonged to them in their higher character of poets, any"
3742,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),excess will remain.
3743,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3744,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),We have thus circumscribed the word poetry within the limits of that
3745,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),art which is the most familiar and the most perfect expression of the
3746,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"faculty itself. It is necessary, however, to make the circle still"
3747,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"narrower, and to determine the distinction between measured and"
3748,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),unmeasured language; for the popular division into prose and verse is
3749,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),inadmissible in accurate philosophy.
3750,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3751,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each other and
3752,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"towards that which they represent, and a perception of the order of"
3753,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),those relations has always been found connected with a perception of
3754,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the order of the relations of thoughts. Hence the language of poets
3755,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of
3756,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely less"
3757,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"indispensable to the communication of its influence, than the words"
3758,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"themselves, without reference to that peculiar order. Hence the vanity"
3759,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of translation; it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that
3760,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"you might discover the formal principle of its colour and odour, as"
3761,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),seek to transfuse from one language into another the creations of a
3762,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poet. The plant must spring again from its seed, or it will bear no"
3763,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),flower--and this is the burthen of the curse of Babel.
3764,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3765,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),An observation of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony in the
3766,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language of poetical minds, together with its relation to music,"
3767,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"produced metre, or a certain system of traditional forms of harmony"
3768,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and language. Yet it is by no means essential that a poet should
3769,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"accommodate his language to this traditional form, so that the"
3770,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"harmony, which is its spirit, be observed. The practice is indeed"
3771,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"convenient and popular, and to be preferred, especially in such"
3772,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),composition as includes much action: but every great poet must
3773,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),inevitably innovate upon the example of his predecessors in the exact
3774,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),structure of his peculiar versification. The distinction between poets
3775,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and prose writers is a vulgar error. The distinction between
3776,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),philosophers and poets has been anticipated. Plato was essentially a
3777,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poet--the truth and splendour of his imagery, and the melody of his"
3778,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language, are the most intense that it is possible to conceive. He"
3779,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"rejected the measure of the epic, dramatic, and lyrical forms, because"
3780,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),he sought to kindle a harmony in thoughts divested of shape and
3781,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"action, and he forbore to invent any regular plan of rhythm which"
3782,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"would include, under determinate forms, the varied pauses of his"
3783,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"style. Cicero sought to imitate the cadence of his periods, but with"
3784,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),little success. Lord Bacon was a poet.[11] His language has a sweet
3785,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and majestic rhythm, which satisfies the sense, no less than the"
3786,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),almost superhuman wisdom of his philosophy satisfies the intellect; it
3787,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is a strain which distends, and then bursts the circumference of the"
3788,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"reader's mind, and pours itself forth together with it into the"
3789,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universal element with which it has perpetual sympathy. All the
3790,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),authors of revolutions in opinion are not only necessarily poets as
3791,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"they are inventors, nor even as their words unveil the permanent"
3792,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),analogy of things by images which participate in the life of truth;
3793,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"but as their periods are harmonious and rhythmical, and contain in"
3794,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),themselves the elements of verse; being the echo of the eternal music.
3795,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Nor are those supreme poets, who have employed traditional forms of"
3796,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"rhythm on account of the form and action of their subjects, less"
3797,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"capable of perceiving and teaching the truth of things, than those who"
3798,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"have omitted that form. Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton (to confine"
3799,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),ourselves to modern writers) are philosophers of the very loftiest
3800,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),power.

3804,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3805,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),A poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth. There
3806,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is this difference between a story and a poem, that a story is a"
3807,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"catalogue of detached facts, which have no other connexion than time,"
3808,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"place, circumstance, cause and effect; the other is the creation of"
3809,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"actions according to the unchangeable forms of human nature, as"
3810,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"existing in the mind of the Creator, which is itself the image of all"
3811,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"other minds. The one is partial, and applies only to a definite period"
3812,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of time, and a certain combination of events which can never again"
3813,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"recur; the other is universal, and contains within itself the germ of"
3814,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),a relation to whatever motives or actions have place in the possible
3815,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"varieties of human nature. Time, which destroys the beauty and the use"
3816,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the story of particular facts, stripped of the poetry which should"
3817,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"invest them, augments that of poetry, and for ever develops new and"
3818,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),wonderful applications of the eternal truth which it contains. Hence
3819,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),epitomes have been called the moths of just history; they eat out the
3820,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poetry of it. A story of particular facts is as a mirror which
3821,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),obscures and distorts that which should be beautiful: poetry is a
3822,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),mirror which makes beautiful that which is distorted.
3823,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3824,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The parts of a composition may be poetical, without the composition as"
3825,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"a whole being a poem. A single sentence may be considered as a whole,"
3826,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),though it may be found in the midst of a series of unassimilated
3827,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),portions: a single word even may be a spark of inextinguishable
3828,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"thought. And thus all the great historians, Herodotus, Plutarch, Livy,"
3829,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"were poets; and although the plan of these writers, especially that of"
3830,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Livy, restrained them from developing this faculty in its highest"
3831,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"degree, they made copious and ample amends for their subjection, by"
3832,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),filling all the interstices of their subjects with living images.
3833,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3834,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Having determined what is poetry, and who are poets, let us proceed to"
3835,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),estimate its effects upon society.
3836,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3837,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Poetry is ever accompanied with pleasure: all spirits on which it
3838,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),falls open themselves to receive the wisdom which is mingled with its
3839,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"delight. In the infancy of the world, neither poets themselves nor"
3840,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),their auditors are fully aware of the excellence of poetry: for it
3841,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"acts in a divine and unapprehended manner, beyond and above"
3842,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),consciousness; and it is reserved for future generations to
3843,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),contemplate and measure the mighty cause and effect in all the
3844,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"strength and splendour of their union. Even in modern times, no living"
3845,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poet ever arrived at the fullness of his fame; the jury which sits in
3846,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"judgement upon a poet, belonging as he does to all time, must be"
3847,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),composed of his peers: it must be impanelled by Time from the
3848,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"selectest of the wise of many generations. A poet is a nightingale,"
3849,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet
3850,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen
3851,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not"
3852,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),whence or why. The poems of Homer and his contemporaries were the
3853,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),delight of infant Greece; they were the elements of that social system
3854,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which is the column upon which all succeeding civilization has
3855,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),reposed. Homer embodied the ideal perfection of his age in human
3856,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),character; nor can we doubt that those who read his verses were
3857,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"awakened to an ambition of becoming like to Achilles, Hector, and"
3858,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Ulysses: the truth and beauty of friendship, patriotism, and"
3859,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"persevering devotion to an object, were unveiled to the depths in"
3860,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),these immortal creations: the sentiments of the auditors must have
3861,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),been refined and enlarged by a sympathy with such great and lovely
3862,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"impersonations, until from admiring they imitated, and from imitation"
3863,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),they identified themselves with the objects of their admiration. Nor
3864,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"let it be objected, that these characters are remote from moral"
3865,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"perfection, and that they can by no means be considered as edifying"
3866,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"patterns for general imitation. Every epoch, under names more or less"
3867,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"specious, has deified its peculiar errors; Revenge is the naked idol"
3868,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the worship of a semi-barbarous age; and Self-deceit is the veiled
3869,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"image of unknown evil, before which luxury and satiety lie prostrate."
3870,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),But a poet considers the vices of his contemporaries as a temporary
3871,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dress in which his creations must be arrayed, and which cover without"
3872,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),concealing the eternal proportions of their beauty. An epic or
3873,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dramatic personage is understood to wear them around his soul, as he"
3874,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),may the ancient armour or the modern uniform around his body; whilst
3875,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),it is easy to conceive a dress more graceful than either. The beauty
3876,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the internal nature cannot be so far concealed by its accidental
3877,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"vesture, but that the spirit of its form shall communicate itself to"
3878,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the very disguise, and indicate the shape it hides from the manner in"
3879,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which it is worn. A majestic form and graceful motions will express
3880,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),themselves through the most barbarous and tasteless costume. Few poets
3881,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the highest class have chosen to exhibit the beauty of their
3882,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),conceptions in its naked truth and splendour; and it is doubtful
3883,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"whether the alloy of costume, habit, &c., be not necessary to temper"
3884,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),this planetary music for mortal ears.
3885,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3886,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The whole objection, however, of the immorality of poetry rests upon a"
3887,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),misconception of the manner in which poetry acts to produce the moral
3888,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),improvement of man. Ethical science arranges the elements which poetry
3889,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"has created, and propounds schemes and proposes examples of civil and"
3890,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable doctrines that men
3891,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one"
3892,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),another. But poetry acts in another and diviner manner. It awakens and
3893,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand
3894,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),unapprehended combinations of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the
3895,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they"
3896,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"were not familiar; it reproduces all that it represents, and the"
3897,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),impersonations clothed in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in the
3898,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"minds of those who have once contemplated them, as memorials of that"
3899,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all thoughts and
3900,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),actions with which it coexists. The great secret of morals is love; or
3901,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with"
3902,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own."
3903,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively;"
3904,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the
3905,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),pains and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great
3906,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),instrument of moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers to
3907,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the effect by acting upon the cause. Poetry enlarges the circumference
3908,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the imagination by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new
3909,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"delight, which have the power of attracting and assimilating to their"
3910,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"own nature all other thoughts, and which form new intervals and"
3911,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food. Poetry strengthens
3912,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the faculty which is the organ of the moral nature of man, in the same"
3913,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),manner as exercise strengthens a limb. A poet therefore would do ill
3914,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"to embody his own conceptions of right and wrong, which are usually"
3915,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"those of his place and time, in his poetical creations, which"
3916,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),participate in neither. By this assumption of the inferior office of
3917,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"interpreting the effect, in which perhaps after all he might acquit"
3918,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"himself but imperfectly, he would resign a glory in a participation in"
3919,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the cause. There was little danger that Homer, or any of the eternal"
3920,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poets, should have so far misunderstood themselves as to have"
3921,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),abdicated this throne of their widest dominion. Those in whom the
3922,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poetical faculty, though great, is less intense, as Euripides, Lucan,"
3923,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Tasso, Spenser, have frequently affected a moral aim, and the effect"
3924,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of their poetry is diminished in exact proportion to the degree in
3925,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which they compel us to advert to this purpose.
3926,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3927,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Homer and the cyclic poets were followed at a certain interval by the
3928,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dramatic and lyrical poets of Athens, who flourished contemporaneously"
3929,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),with all that is most perfect in the kindred expressions of the
3930,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poetical faculty; architecture, painting, music, the dance, sculpture,"
3931,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"philosophy, and, we may add, the forms of civil life. For although the"
3932,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),scheme of Athenian society was deformed by many imperfections which
3933,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the poetry existing in chivalry and Christianity has erased from the
3934,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),habits and institutions of modern Europe; yet never at any other
3935,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"period has so much energy, beauty, and virtue, been developed; never"
3936,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),was blind strength and stubborn form so disciplined and rendered
3937,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"subject to the will of man, or that will less repugnant to the"
3938,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dictates of the beautiful and the true, as during the century which"
3939,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),preceded the death of Socrates. Of no other epoch in the history of
3940,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),our species have we records and fragments stamped so visibly with the
3941,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"image of the divinity in man. But it is poetry alone, in form, in"
3942,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"action, or in language, which has rendered this epoch memorable above"
3943,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"all others, and the storehouse of examples to everlasting time. For"
3944,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),written poetry existed at that epoch simultaneously with the other
3945,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"arts, and it is an idle inquiry to demand which gave and which"
3946,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"received the light, which all, as from a common focus, have scattered"
3947,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),over the darkest periods of succeeding time. We know no more of cause
3948,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and effect than a constant conjunction of events: poetry is ever found
3949,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to co-exist with whatever other arts contribute to the happiness and
3950,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),perfection of man. I appeal to what has already been established to
3951,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),distinguish between the cause and the effect.
3952,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3953,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"It was at the period here adverted to, that the drama had its birth;"
3954,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and however a succeeding writer may have equalled or surpassed those
3955,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),few great specimens of the Athenian drama which have been preserved to
3956,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"us, it is indisputable that the art itself never was understood or"
3957,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"practised according to the true philosophy of it, as at Athens. For"
3958,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the Athenians employed language, action, music, painting, the dance,"
3959,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and religious institutions, to produce a common effect in the"
3960,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),representation of the highest idealisms of passion and of power; each
3961,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),division in the art was made perfect in its kind by artists of the
3962,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"most consummate skill, and was disciplined into a beautiful proportion"
3963,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and unity one towards the other. On the modern stage a few only of the
3964,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),elements capable of expressing the image of the poet's conception are
3965,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),employed at once. We have tragedy without music and dancing; and music
3966,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and dancing without the highest impersonations of which they are the
3967,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"fit accompaniment, and both without religion and solemnity. Religious"
3968,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),institution has indeed been usually banished from the stage. Our
3969,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"system of divesting the actor's face of a mask, on which the many"
3970,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),expressions appropriated to his dramatic character might be moulded
3971,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"into one permanent and unchanging expression, is favourable only to a"
3972,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),partial and inharmonious effect; it is fit for nothing but a
3973,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"monologue, where all the attention may be directed to some great"
3974,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),master of ideal mimicry. The modern practice of blending comedy with
3975,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"tragedy, though liable to great abuse in point of practice, is"
3976,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),undoubtedly an extension of the dramatic circle; but the comedy should
3977,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"be as in _King Lear_, universal, ideal, and sublime. It is perhaps the"
3978,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),intervention of this principle which determines the balance in favour
3979,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of _King Lear_ against the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ or the _Agamemnon_, or,"
3980,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"if you will, the trilogies with which they are connected; unless the"
3981,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"intense power of the choral poetry, especially that of the latter,"
3982,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"should be considered as restoring the equilibrium. _King Lear_, if it"
3983,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"can sustain this comparison, may be judged to be the most perfect"
3984,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),specimen of the dramatic art existing in the world; in spite of the
3985,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),narrow conditions to which the poet was subjected by the ignorance of
3986,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the philosophy of the drama which has prevailed in modern Europe.
3987,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Calderon, in his religious _Autos_, has attempted to fulfil some of"
3988,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the high conditions of dramatic representation neglected by
3989,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Shakespeare; such as the establishing a relation between the drama and
3990,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"religion, and the accommodating them to music and dancing; but he"
3991,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"omits the observation of conditions still more important, and more is"
3992,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),lost than gained by the substitution of the rigidly-defined and
3993,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),ever-repeated idealisms of a distorted superstition for the living
3994,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),impersonations of the truth of human passion.
3995,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
3996,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),But I digress.--The connexion of scenic exhibitions with the
3997,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"improvement or corruption of the manners of men, has been universally"
3998,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"recognized: in other words, the presence or absence of poetry in its"
3999,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"most perfect and universal form, has been found to be connected with"
4000,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),good and evil in conduct or habit. The corruption which has been
4001,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"imputed to the drama as an effect, begins, when the poetry employed in"
4002,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),its constitution ends: I appeal to the history of manners whether the
4003,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),periods of the growth of the one and the decline of the other have not
4004,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),corresponded with an exactness equal to any example of moral cause and
4005,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),effect.
4006,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4007,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The drama at Athens, or wheresoever else it may have approached to its"
4008,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"perfection, ever co-existed with the moral and intellectual greatness"
4009,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the age. The tragedies of the Athenian poets are as mirrors in
4010,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"which the spectator beholds himself, under a thin disguise of"
4011,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"circumstance, stript of all but that ideal perfection and energy which"
4012,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"every one feels to be the internal type of all that he loves, admires,"
4013,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and would become. The imagination is enlarged by a sympathy with pains
4014,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and passions so mighty, that they distend in their conception the"
4015,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),capacity of that by which they are conceived; the good affections are
4016,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"strengthened by pity, indignation, terror, and sorrow; and an exalted"
4017,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),calm is prolonged from the satiety of this high exercise of them into
4018,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the tumult of familiar life: even crime is disarmed of half its horror
4019,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and all its contagion by being represented as the fatal consequence
4020,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the unfathomable agencies of nature; error is thus divested of its
4021,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),wilfulness; men can no longer cherish it as the creation of their
4022,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),choice. In a drama of the highest order there is little food for
4023,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),censure or hatred; it teaches rather self-knowledge and self-respect.
4024,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Neither the eye nor the mind can see itself, unless reflected upon"
4025,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that which it resembles. The drama, so long as it continues to express"
4026,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poetry, is as a prismatic and many-sided mirror, which collects the"
4027,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),brightest rays of human nature and divides and reproduces them from
4028,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the simplicity of these elementary forms, and touches them with"
4029,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"majesty and beauty, and multiplies all that it reflects, and endows it"
4030,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),with the power of propagating its like wherever it may fall.
4031,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4032,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"But in periods of the decay of social life, the drama sympathizes with"
4033,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),that decay. Tragedy becomes a cold imitation of the form of the great
4034,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"masterpieces of antiquity, divested of all harmonious accompaniment of"
4035,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the kindred arts; and often the very form misunderstood, or a weak"
4036,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"attempt to teach certain doctrines, which the writer considers as"
4037,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),moral truths; and which are usually no more than specious flatteries
4038,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of some gross vice or weakness, with which the author, in common with"
4039,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"his auditors, are infected. Hence what has been called the classical"
4040,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and domestic drama. Addison's _Cato_ is a specimen of the one; and
4041,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),would it were not superfluous to cite examples of the other! To such
4042,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),purposes poetry cannot be made subservient. Poetry is a sword of
4043,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would"
4044,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),contain it. And thus we observe that all dramatic writings of this
4045,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),nature are unimaginative in a singular degree; they affect sentiment
4046,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and passion, which, divested of imagination, are other names for"
4047,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),caprice and appetite. The period in our own history of the grossest
4048,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"degradation of the drama is the reign of Charles II, when all forms in"
4049,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which poetry had been accustomed to be expressed became hymns to the
4050,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),triumph of kingly power over liberty and virtue. Milton stood alone
4051,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),illuminating an age unworthy of him. At such periods the calculating
4052,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"principle pervades all the forms of dramatic exhibition, and poetry"
4053,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),ceases to be expressed upon them. Comedy loses its ideal universality:
4054,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"wit succeeds to humour; we laugh from self-complacency and triumph,"
4055,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"instead of pleasure; malignity, sarcasm, and contempt, succeed to"
4056,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sympathetic merriment; we hardly laugh, but we smile. Obscenity, which"
4057,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life, becomes, from the"
4058,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"very veil which it assumes, more active if less disgusting: it is a"
4059,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),monster for which the corruption of society for ever brings forth new
4060,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"food, which it devours in secret."
4061,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4062,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The drama being that form under which a greater number of modes of
4063,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"expression of poetry are susceptible of being combined than any other,"
4064,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the connexion of poetry and social good is more observable in the
4065,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),drama than in whatever other form. And it is indisputable that the
4066,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),highest perfection of human society has ever corresponded with the
4067,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),highest dramatic excellence; and that the corruption or the extinction
4068,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the drama in a nation where it has once flourished, is a mark of a"
4069,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"corruption of manners, and an extinction of the energies which sustain"
4070,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the soul of social life. But, as Machiavelli says of political"
4071,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"institutions, that life may be preserved and renewed, if men should"
4072,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),arise capable of bringing back the drama to its principles. And this
4073,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),is true with respect to poetry in its most extended sense: all
4074,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language, institution and form, require not only to be produced but to"
4075,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),be sustained: the office and character of a poet participates in the
4076,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"divine nature as regards providence, no less than as regards creation."
4077,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4078,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Civil war, the spoils of Asia, and the fatal predominance first of the"
4079,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Macedonian, and then of the Roman arms, were so many symbols of the"
4080,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),extinction or suspension of the creative faculty in Greece. The
4081,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"bucolic writers, who found patronage under the lettered tyrants of"
4082,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Sicily and Egypt, were the latest representatives of its most glorious"
4083,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),reign. Their poetry is intensely melodious; like the odour of the
4084,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"tuberose, it overcomes and sickens the spirit with excess of"
4085,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sweetness; whilst the poetry of the preceding age was as a meadow-gale
4086,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of June, which mingles the fragrance of all the flowers of the field,"
4087,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and adds a quickening and harmonizing spirit of its own, which endows"
4088,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the sense with a power of sustaining its extreme delight. The bucolic
4089,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and erotic delicacy in written poetry is correlative with that
4090,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"softness in statuary, music, and the kindred arts, and even in manners"
4091,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and institutions, which distinguished the epoch to which I now refer."
4092,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Nor is it the poetical faculty itself, or any misapplication of it, to"
4093,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which this want of harmony is to be imputed. An equal sensibility to
4094,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the influence of the senses and the affections is to be found in the
4095,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"writings of Homer and Sophocles: the former, especially, has clothed"
4096,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sensual and pathetic images with irresistible attractions. Their
4097,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),superiority over these succeeding writers consists in the presence of
4098,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"those thoughts which belong to the inner faculties of our nature, not"
4099,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),in the absence of those which are connected with the external: their
4100,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),incomparable perfection consists in a harmony of the union of all. It
4101,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is not what the erotic poets have, but what they have not, in which"
4102,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"their imperfection consists. It is not inasmuch as they were poets,"
4103,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"but inasmuch as they were not poets, that they can be considered with"
4104,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),any plausibility as connected with the corruption of their age. Had
4105,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),that corruption availed so as to extinguish in them the sensibility to
4106,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"pleasure, passion, and natural scenery, which is imputed to them as an"
4107,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"imperfection, the last triumph of evil would have been achieved. For"
4108,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the end of social corruption is to destroy all sensibility to
4109,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"pleasure; and, therefore, it is corruption. It begins at the"
4110,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"imagination and the intellect as at the core, and distributes itself"
4111,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"thence as a paralysing venom, through the affections into the very"
4112,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"appetites, until all become a torpid mass in which hardly sense"
4113,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"survives. At the approach of such a period, poetry ever addresses"
4114,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"itself to those faculties which are the last to be destroyed, and its"
4115,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"voice is heard, like the footsteps of Astraea, departing from the"
4116,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),world. Poetry ever communicates all the pleasure which men are capable
4117,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of receiving: it is ever still the light of life; the source of
4118,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),whatever of beautiful or generous or true can have place in an evil
4119,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),time. It will readily be confessed that those among the luxurious
4120,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"citizens of Syracuse and Alexandria, who were delighted with the poems"
4121,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of Theocritus, were less cold, cruel, and sensual than the remnant of"
4122,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),their tribe. But corruption must utterly have destroyed the fabric of
4123,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),human society before poetry can ever cease. The sacred links of that
4124,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"chain have never been entirely disjoined, which descending through"
4125,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the minds of many men is attached to those great minds, whence as from"
4126,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"a magnet the invisible effluence is sent forth, which at once"
4127,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"connects, animates, and sustains the life of all. It is the faculty"
4128,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which contains within itself the seeds at once of its own and of
4129,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),social renovation. And let us not circumscribe the effects of the
4130,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),bucolic and erotic poetry within the limits of the sensibility of
4131,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),those to whom it was addressed. They may have perceived the beauty of
4132,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"those immortal compositions, simply as fragments and isolated"
4133,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"portions: those who are more finely organized, or born in a happier"
4134,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"age, may recognize them as episodes to that great poem, which all"
4135,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have built up"
4136,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),since the beginning of the world.
4137,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4138,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The same revolutions within a narrower sphere had place in ancient
4139,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Rome; but the actions and forms of its social life never seem to have
4140,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),been perfectly saturated with the poetical element. The Romans appear
4141,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to have considered the Greeks as the selectest treasuries of the
4142,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"selectest forms of manners and of nature, and to have abstained from"
4143,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"creating in measured language, sculpture, music, or architecture,"
4144,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),anything which might bear a particular relation to their own
4145,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"condition, whilst it should bear a general one to the universal"
4146,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"constitution of the world. But we judge from partial evidence, and we"
4147,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"judge perhaps partially. Ennius, Varro, Pacuvius, and Accius, all"
4148,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"great poets, have been lost. Lucretius is in the highest, and Virgil"
4149,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"in a very high sense, a creator. The chosen delicacy of expressions of"
4150,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the latter, are as a mist of light which conceal from us the intense"
4151,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and exceeding truth of his conceptions of nature. Livy is instinct
4152,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"with poetry. Yet Horace, Catullus, Ovid, and generally the other great"
4153,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"writers of the Virgilian age, saw man and nature in the mirror of"
4154,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Greece. The institutions also, and the religion of Rome were less"
4155,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poetical than those of Greece, as the shadow is less vivid than the"
4156,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"substance. Hence poetry in Rome seemed to follow, rather than"
4157,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"accompany, the perfection of political and domestic society. The true"
4158,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poetry of Rome lived in its institutions; for whatever of beautiful,"
4159,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"true, and majestic, they contained, could have sprung only from the"
4160,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),faculty which creates the order in which they consist. The life of
4161,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Camillus, the death of Regulus; the expectation of the senators, in"
4162,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"their godlike state, of the victorious Gauls: the refusal of the"
4163,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"republic to make peace with Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, were"
4164,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),not the consequences of a refined calculation of the probable personal
4165,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"advantage to result from such a rhythm and order in the shows of life,"
4166,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to those who were at once the poets and the actors of these immortal
4167,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dramas. The imagination beholding the beauty of this order, created it"
4168,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"out of itself according to its own idea; the consequence was empire,"
4169,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and the reward everliving fame. These things are not the less poetry
4170,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),_quia carent vate sacro_. They are the episodes of that cyclic poem
4171,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"written by Time upon the memories of men. The Past, like an inspired"
4172,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"rhapsodist, fills the theatre of everlasting generations with their"
4173,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),harmony.
4174,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4175,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),At length the ancient system of religion and manners had fulfilled the
4176,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),circle of its revolutions. And the world would have fallen into utter
4177,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"anarchy and darkness, but that, there were found poets among the"
4178,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),authors of the Christian and chivalric systems of manners and
4179,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"religion, who created forms of opinion and action never before"
4180,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"conceived; which, copied into the imaginations of men, become as"
4181,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),generals to the bewildered armies of their thoughts. It is foreign to
4182,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the present purpose to touch upon the evil produced by these systems:
4183,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"except that we protest, on the ground of the principles already"
4184,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"established, that no portion of it can be attributed to the poetry"
4185,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),they contain.
4186,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4187,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"It is probable that the poetry of Moses, Job, David, Solomon, and"
4188,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Isaiah, had produced a great effect upon the mind of Jesus and his"
4189,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),disciples. The scattered fragments preserved to us by the biographers
4190,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of this extraordinary person, are all instinct with the most vivid"
4191,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poetry. But his doctrines seem to have been quickly distorted. At a
4192,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),certain period after the prevalence of a system of opinions founded
4193,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"upon those promulgated by him, the three forms into which Plato had"
4194,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"distributed the faculties of mind underwent a sort of apotheosis, and"
4195,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),became the object of the worship of the civilized world. Here it is to
4196,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"be confessed that 'Light seems to thicken', and"
4197,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4198,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The crow makes wing to the rooky wood,"
4199,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,"
4200,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),And night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
4201,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4202,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),But mark how beautiful an order has sprung from the dust and blood of
4203,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"this fierce chaos! how the world, as from a resurrection, balancing"
4204,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"itself on the golden wings of knowledge and of hope, has reassumed its"
4205,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"yet unwearied flight into the heaven of time. Listen to the music,"
4206,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"unheard by outward ears, which is as a ceaseless and invisible wind,"
4207,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),nourishing its everlasting course with strength and swiftness.
4208,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4209,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The poetry in the doctrines of Jesus Christ, and the mythology and"
4210,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"institutions of the Celtic conquerors of the Roman empire, outlived"
4211,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the darkness and the convulsions connected with their growth and
4212,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"victory, and blended themselves in a new fabric of manners and"
4213,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),opinion. It is an error to impute the ignorance of the dark ages to
4214,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the Christian doctrines or the predominance of the Celtic nations.
4215,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Whatever of evil their agencies may have contained sprang from the
4216,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"extinction of the poetical principle, connected with the progress of"
4217,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"despotism and superstition. Men, from causes too intricate to be here"
4218,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"discussed, had become insensible and selfish: their own will had"
4219,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"become feeble, and yet they were its slaves, and thence the slaves of"
4220,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the will of others; lust, fear, avarice, cruelty, and fraud,"
4221,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),characterized a race amongst whom no one was to be found capable of
4222,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"_creating_ in form, language, or institution. The moral anomalies of"
4223,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),such a state of society are not justly to be charged upon any class of
4224,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"events immediately connected with them, and those events are most"
4225,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),entitled to our approbation which could dissolve it most
4226,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),expeditiously. It is unfortunate for those who cannot distinguish
4227,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"words from thoughts, that many of these anomalies have been"
4228,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),incorporated into our popular religion.
4229,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4230,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),It was not until the eleventh century that the effects of the poetry
4231,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the Christian and chivalric systems began to manifest themselves.
4232,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The principle of equality had been discovered and applied by Plato in
4233,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"his _Republic_, as the theoretical rule of the mode in which the"
4234,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"materials of pleasure and of power, produced by the common skill and"
4235,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"labour of human beings, ought to be distributed among them. The"
4236,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),limitations of this rule were asserted by him to be determined only by
4237,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the sensibility of each, or the utility to result to all. Plato,"
4238,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"following the doctrines of Timaeus and Pythagoras, taught also a moral"
4239,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and intellectual system of doctrine, comprehending at once the past,"
4240,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the present, and the future condition of man. Jesus Christ divulged"
4241,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the sacred and eternal truths contained in these views to mankind, and"
4242,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Christianity, in its abstract purity, became the exoteric expression"
4243,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the esoteric doctrines of the poetry and wisdom of antiquity. The
4244,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),incorporation of the Celtic nations with the exhausted population of
4245,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the south, impressed upon it the figure of the poetry existing in"
4246,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),their mythology and institutions. The result was a sum of the action
4247,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and reaction of all the causes included in it; for it may be assumed
4248,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),as a maxim that no nation or religion can supersede any other without
4249,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),incorporating into itself a portion of that which it supersedes. The
4250,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"abolition of personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation of"
4251,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"women from a great part of the degrading restraints of antiquity, were"
4252,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),among the consequences of these events.
4253,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4254,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The abolition of personal slavery is the basis of the highest
4255,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),political hope that it can enter into the mind of man to conceive. The
4256,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),freedom of women produced the poetry of sexual love. Love became a
4257,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"religion, the idols of whose worship were ever present. It was as if"
4258,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the statues of Apollo and the Muses had been endowed with life and
4259,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"motion, and had walked forth among their worshippers; so that earth"
4260,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),became peopled by the inhabitants of a diviner world. The familiar
4261,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"appearance and proceedings of life became wonderful and heavenly, and"
4262,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),a paradise was created as out of the wrecks of Eden. And as this
4263,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"creation itself is poetry, so its creators were poets; and language"
4264,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"was the instrument of their art: 'Galeotto fù il libro, e chi lo"
4265,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"scrisse.' The Provençal Trouveurs, or inventors, preceded Petrarch,"
4266,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"whose verses are as spells, which unseal the inmost enchanted"
4267,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),fountains of the delight which is in the grief of love. It is
4268,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),impossible to feel them without becoming a portion of that beauty
4269,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which we contemplate: it were superfluous to explain how the
4270,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),gentleness and the elevation of mind connected with these sacred
4271,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"emotions can render men more amiable, more generous and wise, and lift"
4272,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),them out of the dull vapours of the little world of self. Dante
4273,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),understood the secret things of love even more than Petrarch. His
4274,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),_Vita Nuova_ is an inexhaustible fountain of purity of sentiment and
4275,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language: it is the idealized history of that period, and those"
4276,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),intervals of his life which were dedicated to love. His apotheosis of
4277,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Beatrice in Paradise, and the gradations of his own love and her"
4278,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"loveliness, by which as by steps he feigns himself to have ascended to"
4279,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the throne of the Supreme Cause, is the most glorious imagination of"
4280,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),modern poetry. The acutest critics have justly reversed the judgement
4281,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the vulgar, and the order of the great acts of the 'Divine Drama',"
4282,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"in the measure of the admiration which they accord to the Hell,"
4283,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Purgatory, and Paradise. The latter is a perpetual hymn of everlasting"
4284,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"love. Love, which found a worthy poet in Plato alone of all the"
4285,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"ancients, has been celebrated by a chorus of the greatest writers of"
4286,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the renovated world; and the music has penetrated the caverns of
4287,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"society, and its echoes still drown the dissonance of arms and"
4288,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"superstition. At successive intervals, Ariosto, Tasso, Shakespeare,"
4289,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Spenser, Calderon, Rousseau, and the great writers of our own age,"
4290,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"have celebrated the dominion of love, planting as it were trophies in"
4291,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the human mind of that sublimest victory over sensuality and force.
4292,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The true relation borne to each other by the sexes into which human
4293,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"kind is distributed, has become less misunderstood; and if the error"
4294,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which confounded diversity with inequality of the powers of the two
4295,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sexes has been partially recognized in the opinions and institutions
4296,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of modern Europe, we owe this great benefit to the worship of which"
4297,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"chivalry was the law, and poets the prophets."
4298,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4299,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The poetry of Dante may be considered as the bridge thrown over the
4300,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"stream of time, which unites the modern and ancient world. The"
4301,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),distorted notions of invisible things which Dante and his rival Milton
4302,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"have idealized, are merely the mask and the mantle in which these"
4303,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),great poets walk through eternity enveloped and disguised. It is a
4304,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),difficult question to determine how far they were conscious of the
4305,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),distinction which must have subsisted in their minds between their own
4306,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),creeds and that of the people. Dante at least appears to wish to mark
4307,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the full extent of it by placing Riphaeus, whom Virgil calls"
4308,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"_iustissimus unus_, in Paradise, and observing a most heretical"
4309,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),caprice in his distribution of rewards and punishments. And Milton's
4310,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poem contains within itself a philosophical refutation of that system,"
4311,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of which, by a strange and natural antithesis, it has been a chief"
4312,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),popular support. Nothing can exceed the energy and magnificence of the
4313,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),character of Satan as expressed in _Paradise Lost_. It is a mistake to
4314,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),suppose that he could ever have been intended for the popular
4315,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"personification of evil. Implacable hate, patient cunning, and a"
4316,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sleepless refinement of device to inflict the extremest anguish on an
4317,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"enemy, these things are evil; and, although venial in a slave, are not"
4318,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to be forgiven in a tyrant; although redeemed by much that ennobles
4319,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"his defeat in one subdued, are marked by all that dishonours his"
4320,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),conquest in the victor. Milton's Devil as a moral being is as far
4321,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"superior to his God, as one who perseveres in some purpose which he"
4322,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"has conceived to be excellent in spite of adversity and torture, is to"
4323,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),one who in the cold security of undoubted triumph inflicts the most
4324,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"horrible revenge upon his enemy, not from any mistaken notion of"
4325,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"inducing him to repent of a perseverance in enmity, but with the"
4326,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),alleged design of exasperating him to deserve new torments. Milton has
4327,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),so far violated the popular creed (if this shall be judged to be a
4328,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),violation) as to have alleged no superiority of moral virtue to his
4329,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),God over his Devil. And this bold neglect of a direct moral purpose is
4330,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the most decisive proof of the supremacy of Milton's genius. He
4331,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),mingled as it were the elements of human nature as colours upon a
4332,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"single pallet, and arranged them in the composition of his great"
4333,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"picture according to the laws of epic truth; that is, according to the"
4334,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),laws of that principle by which a series of actions of the external
4335,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universe and of intelligent and ethical beings is calculated to excite
4336,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the sympathy of succeeding generations of mankind. The _Divina
4337,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Commedia_ and _Paradise Lost_ have conferred upon modern mythology a
4338,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),systematic form; and when change and time shall have added one more
4339,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),superstition to the mass of those which have arisen and decayed upon
4340,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the earth, commentators will be learnedly employed in elucidating the"
4341,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"religion of ancestral Europe, only not utterly forgotten because it"
4342,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),will have been stamped with the eternity of genius.
4343,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4344,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Homer was the first and Dante the second epic poet: that is, the"
4345,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"second poet, the series of whose creations bore a defined and"
4346,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),intelligible relation to the knowledge and sentiment and religion of
4347,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the age in which he lived, and of the ages which followed it:"
4348,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),developing itself in correspondence with their development. For
4349,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Lucretius had limed the wings of his swift spirit in the dregs of the
4350,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sensible world; and Virgil, with a modesty that ill became his genius,"
4351,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"had affected the fame of an imitator, even whilst he created anew all"
4352,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that he copied; and none among the flock of mock-birds, though their"
4353,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"notes were sweet, Apollonius Rhodius, Quintus Calaber, Nonnus, Lucan,"
4354,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Statius, or Claudian, have sought even to fulfil a single condition of"
4355,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),epic truth. Milton was the third epic poet. For if the title of epic
4356,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"in its highest sense be refused to the _Aeneid_, still less can it be"
4357,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"conceded to the _Orlando Furioso_, the _Gerusalemme Liberata_, the"
4358,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"_Lusiad_, or the _Faerie Queene_."
4359,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4360,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Dante and Milton were both deeply penetrated with the ancient religion
4361,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of the civilized world; and its spirit exists in their poetry probably
4362,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),in the same proportion as its forms survived in the unreformed worship
4363,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of modern Europe. The one preceded and the other followed the
4364,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Reformation at almost equal intervals. Dante was the first religious
4365,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"reformer, and Luther surpassed him rather in the rudeness and"
4366,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"acrimony, than in the boldness of his censures of papal usurpation."
4367,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Dante was the first awakener of entranced Europe; he created a
4368,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"language, in itself music and persuasion, out of a chaos of"
4369,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),inharmonious barbarisms. He was the congregator of those great spirits
4370,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),who presided over the resurrection of learning; the Lucifer of that
4371,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),starry flock which in the thirteenth century shone forth from
4372,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"republican Italy, as from a heaven, into the darkness of the benighted"
4373,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"world. His very words are instinct with spirit; each is as a spark, a"
4374,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),burning atom of inextinguishable thought; and many yet lie covered in
4375,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the ashes of their birth, and pregnant with a lightning which has yet"
4376,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),found no conductor. All high poetry is infinite; it is as the first
4377,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"acorn, which contained all oaks potentially. Veil after veil may be"
4378,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"undrawn, and the inmost naked beauty of the meaning never exposed. A"
4379,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),great poem is a fountain for ever overflowing with the waters of
4380,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),wisdom and delight; and after one person and one age has exhausted all
4381,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),its divine effluence which their peculiar relations enable them to
4382,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"share, another and yet another succeeds, and new relations are ever"
4383,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"developed, the source of an unforeseen and an unconceived delight."
4384,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4385,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The age immediately succeeding to that of Dante, Petrarch, and"
4386,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Boccaccio, was characterized by a revival of painting, sculpture, and"
4387,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"architecture. Chaucer caught the sacred inspiration, and the"
4388,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),superstructure of English literature is based upon the materials of
4389,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Italian invention.
4390,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4391,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),But let us not be betrayed from a defence into a critical history of
4392,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poetry and its influence on society. Be it enough to have pointed out
4393,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the effects of poets, in the large and true sense of the word, upon"
4394,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),their own and all succeeding times.
4395,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4396,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),But poets have been challenged to resign the civic crown to reasoners
4397,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and mechanists, on another plea. It is admitted that the exercise of"
4398,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the imagination is most delightful, but it is alleged that that of"
4399,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),reason is more useful. Let us examine as the grounds of this
4400,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"distinction, what is here meant by utility. Pleasure or good, in a"
4401,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"general sense, is that which the consciousness of a sensitive and"
4402,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"intelligent being seeks, and in which, when found, it acquiesces."
4403,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"There are two kinds of pleasure, one durable, universal and permanent;"
4404,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the other transitory and particular. Utility may either express the
4405,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"means of producing the former or the latter. In the former sense,"
4406,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"whatever strengthens and purifies the affections, enlarges the"
4407,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"imagination, and adds spirit to sense, is useful. But a narrower"
4408,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"meaning may be assigned to the word utility, confining it to express"
4409,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that which banishes the importunity of the wants of our animal nature,"
4410,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the surrounding men with security of life, the dispersing the grosser"
4411,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"delusions of superstition, and the conciliating such a degree of"
4412,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),mutual forbearance among men as may consist with the motives of
4413,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),personal advantage.
4414,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4415,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Undoubtedly the promoters of utility, in this limited sense, have"
4416,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"their appointed office in society. They follow the footsteps of poets,"
4417,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and copy the sketches of their creations into the book of common life.
4418,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"They make space, and give time. Their exertions are of the highest"
4419,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"value, so long as they confine their administration of the concerns of"
4420,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the inferior powers of our nature within the limits due to the
4421,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"superior ones. But whilst the sceptic destroys gross superstitions,"
4422,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"let him spare to deface, as some of the French writers have defaced,"
4423,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the eternal truths charactered upon the imaginations of men. Whilst
4424,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the mechanist abridges, and the political economist combines labour,"
4425,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"let them beware that their speculations, for want of correspondence"
4426,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"with those first principles which belong to the imagination, do not"
4427,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"tend, as they have in modern England, to exasperate at once the"
4428,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"extremes of luxury and want. They have exemplified the saying, 'To him"
4429,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that hath, more shall be given; and from him that hath not, the little"
4430,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that he hath shall be taken away.' The rich have become richer, and"
4431,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven
4432,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism. Such are
4433,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the effects which must ever flow from an unmitigated exercise of the
4434,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),calculating faculty.
4435,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4436,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),It is difficult to define pleasure in its highest sense; the
4437,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"definition involving a number of apparent paradoxes. For, from an"
4438,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"inexplicable defect of harmony in the constitution of human nature,"
4439,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the pain of the inferior is frequently connected with the pleasures of
4440,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the superior portions of our being. Sorrow, terror, anguish, despair"
4441,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"itself, are often the chosen expressions of an approximation to the"
4442,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),highest good. Our sympathy in tragic fiction depends on this
4443,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),principle; tragedy delights by affording a shadow of the pleasure
4444,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which exists in pain. This is the source also of the melancholy which
4445,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),is inseparable from the sweetest melody. The pleasure that is in
4446,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself. And hence the
4447,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"saying, 'It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the"
4448,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),house of mirth.' Nor that this highest species of pleasure is
4449,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"necessarily linked with pain. The delight of love and friendship, the"
4450,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"ecstasy of the admiration of nature, the joy of the perception and"
4451,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"still more of the creation of poetry, is often wholly unalloyed."
4452,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4453,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The production and assurance of pleasure in this highest sense is true
4454,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),utility. Those who produce and preserve this pleasure are poets or
4455,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poetical philosophers.
4456,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4457,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"The exertions of Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, Rousseau,[12] and"
4458,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"their disciples, in favour of oppressed and deluded humanity, are"
4459,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),entitled to the gratitude of mankind. Yet it is easy to calculate the
4460,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),degree of moral and intellectual improvement which the world would
4461,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"have exhibited, had they never lived. A little more nonsense would"
4462,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"have been talked for a century or two; and perhaps a few more men,"
4463,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"women, and children, burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment"
4464,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),have been congratulating each other on the abolition of the
4465,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Inquisition in Spain. But it exceeds all imagination to conceive what
4466,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"would have been the moral condition of the world if neither Dante,"
4467,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor"
4468,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Milton, had ever existed; if Raphael and Michael Angelo had never been"
4469,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been translated; if a revival of
4470,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the study of Greek literature had never taken place; if no monuments
4471,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of ancient sculpture had been handed down to us; and if the poetry of
4472,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the religion of the ancient world had been extinguished together with
4473,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"its belief. The human mind could never, except by the intervention of"
4474,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"these excitements, have been awakened to the invention of the grosser"
4475,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sciences, and that application of analytical reasoning to the"
4476,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"aberrations of society, which it is now attempted to exalt over the"
4477,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),direct expression of the inventive and creative faculty itself.
4478,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4479,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"[12] Although Rousseau has been thus classed, he was"
4480,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"essentially a poet. The others, even Voltaire, were mere"
4481,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),reasoners.
4482,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4483,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"We have more moral, political and historical wisdom, than we know how"
4484,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to reduce into practice; we have more scientific and economical
4485,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),knowledge than can be accommodated to the just distribution of the
4486,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these systems of thought,"
4487,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating processes.
4488,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in
4489,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"morals, government, and political economy, or at least, what is wiser"
4490,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and better than what men now practise and endure. But we let '_I dare
4491,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"not_ wait upon _I would_, like the poor cat in the adage.' We want the"
4492,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want the generous
4493,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),impulse to act that which we imagine; we want the poetry of life: our
4494,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can
4495,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),digest. The cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the
4496,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"limits of the empire of man over the external world, has, for want of"
4497,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed those of the"
4498,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"internal world; and man, having enslaved the elements, remains himself"
4499,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),a slave. To what but a cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree
4500,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"disproportioned to the presence of the creative faculty, which is the"
4501,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"basis of all knowledge, is to be attributed the abuse of all invention"
4502,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"for abridging and combining labour, to the exasperation of the"
4503,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),inequality of mankind? From what other cause has it arisen that the
4504,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"discoveries which should have lightened, have added a weight to the"
4505,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"curse imposed on Adam? Poetry, and the principle of Self, of which"
4506,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"money is the visible incarnation, are the God and Mammon of the world."
4507,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4508,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The functions of the poetical faculty are twofold; by one it creates
4509,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),new materials of knowledge and power and pleasure; by the other it
4510,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),engenders in the mind a desire to reproduce and arrange them according
4511,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),to a certain rhythm and order which may be called the beautiful and
4512,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the good. The cultivation of poetry is never more to be desired than
4513,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"at periods when, from an excess of the selfish and calculating"
4514,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"principle, the accumulation of the materials of external life exceed"
4515,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the quantity of the power of assimilating them to the internal laws of
4516,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),human nature. The body has then become too unwieldy for that which
4517,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),animates it.
4518,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4519,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the centre and
4520,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"circumference of knowledge; it is that which comprehends all science,"
4521,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and that to which all science must be referred. It is at the same time
4522,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the root and blossom of all other systems of thought; it is that from
4523,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"which all spring, and that which adorns all; and that which, if"
4524,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"blighted, denies the fruit and the seed, and withholds from the barren"
4525,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),world the nourishment and the succession of the scions of the tree of
4526,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),life. It is the perfect and consummate surface and bloom of all
4527,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),things; it is as the odour and the colour of the rose to the texture
4528,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the elements which compose it, as the form and splendour of unfaded"
4529,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"beauty to the secrets of anatomy and corruption. What were virtue,"
4530,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"love, patriotism, friendship--what were the scenery of this beautiful"
4531,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universe which we inhabit; what were our consolations on this side of
4532,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the grave--and what were our aspirations beyond it, if poetry did not"
4533,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),ascend to bring light and fire from those eternal regions where the
4534,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),owl-winged faculty of calculation dare not ever soar? Poetry is not
4535,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"like reasoning, a power to be exerted according to the determination"
4536,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the will. A man cannot say, 'I will compose poetry.' The greatest"
4537,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poet even cannot say it; for the mind in creation is as a fading coal,"
4538,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"which some invisible influence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to"
4539,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"transitory brightness; this power arises from within, like the colour"
4540,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of a flower which fades and changes as it is developed, and the"
4541,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),conscious portions of our natures are unprophetic either of its
4542,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),approach or its departure. Could this influence be durable in its
4543,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"original purity and force, it is impossible to predict the greatness"
4544,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the results; but when composition begins, inspiration is already on"
4545,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the decline, and the most glorious poetry that has ever been"
4546,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),communicated to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the original
4547,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),conceptions of the poet. I appeal to the greatest poets of the present
4548,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"day, whether it is not an error to assert that the finest passages of"
4549,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),poetry are produced by labour and study. The toil and the delay
4550,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),recommended by critics can be justly interpreted to mean no more than
4551,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"a careful observation of the inspired moments, and an artificial"
4552,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),connexion of the spaces between their suggestions by the intertexture
4553,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of conventional expressions; a necessity only imposed by the
4554,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),limitedness of the poetical faculty itself; for Milton conceived the
4555,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),_Paradise Lost_ as a whole before he executed it in portions. We have
4556,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),his own authority also for the muse having 'dictated' to him the
4557,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),'unpremeditated song'. And let this be an answer to those who would
4558,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),allege the fifty-six various readings of the first line of the
4559,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),_Orlando Furioso_. Compositions so produced are to poetry what mosaic
4560,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),is to painting. This instinct and intuition of the poetical faculty is
4561,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),still more observable in the plastic and pictorial arts; a great
4562,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),statue or picture grows under the power of the artist as a child in
4563,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the mother's womb; and the very mind which directs the hands in
4564,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"formation is incapable of accounting to itself for the origin, the"
4565,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"gradations, or the media of the process."
4566,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4567,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest
4568,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),and best minds. We are aware of evanescent visitations of thought and
4569,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"feeling sometimes associated with place or person, sometimes regarding"
4570,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"our own mind alone, and always arising unforeseen and departing"
4571,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"unbidden, but elevating and delightful beyond all expression: so that"
4572,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"even in the desire and regret they leave, there cannot but be"
4573,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"pleasure, participating as it does in the nature of its object. It is"
4574,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),as it were the interpenetration of a diviner nature through our own;
4575,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"but its footsteps are like those of a wind over the sea, which the"
4576,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"coming calm erases, and whose traces remain only, as on the wrinkled"
4577,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sand which paves it. These and corresponding conditions of being are
4578,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),experienced principally by those of the most delicate sensibility and
4579,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the most enlarged imagination; and the state of mind produced by them
4580,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is at war with every base desire. The enthusiasm of virtue, love,"
4581,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"patriotism, and friendship, is essentially linked with such emotions;"
4582,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and whilst they last, self appears as what it is, an atom to a"
4583,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universe. Poets are not only subject to these experiences as spirits
4584,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of the most refined organization, but they can colour all that they"
4585,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"combine with the evanescent hues of this ethereal world; a word, a"
4586,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"trait in the representation of a scene or a passion, will touch the"
4587,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"enchanted chord, and reanimate, in those who have ever experienced"
4588,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"these emotions, the sleeping, the cold, the buried image of the past."
4589,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Poetry thus makes immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the
4590,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),world; it arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt the
4591,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"interlunations of life, and veiling them, or in language or in form,"
4592,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sends them forth among mankind, bearing sweet news of kindred joy to"
4593,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"those with whom their sisters abide--abide, because there is no portal"
4594,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),of expression from the caverns of the spirit which they inhabit into
4595,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the universe of things. Poetry redeems from decay the visitations of
4596,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),the divinity in man.
4597,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4598,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),Poetry turns all things to loveliness; it exalts the beauty of that
4599,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"which is most beautiful, and it adds beauty to that which is most"
4600,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"deformed; it marries exultation and horror, grief and pleasure,"
4601,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),eternity and change; it subdues to union under its light yoke all
4602,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"irreconcilable things. It transmutes all that it touches, and every"
4603,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),form moving within the radiance of its presence is changed by wondrous
4604,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sympathy to an incarnation of the spirit which it breathes: its secret
4605,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),alchemy turns to potable gold the poisonous waters which flow from
4606,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"death through life; it strips the veil of familiarity from the world,"
4607,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and lays bare the naked and sleeping beauty, which is the spirit of"
4608,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),its forms.
4609,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4610,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),All things exist as they are perceived; at least in relation to the
4611,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"percipient. 'The mind is its own place, and of itself can make a"
4612,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.' But poetry defeats the curse which"
4613,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding impressions.
4614,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"And whether it spreads its own figured curtain, or withdraws life's"
4615,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"dark veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a"
4616,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),being within our being. It makes us the inhabitants of a world to
4617,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which the familiar world is a chaos. It reproduces the common universe
4618,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of which we are portions and percipients, and it purges from our"
4619,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),inward sight the film of familiarity which obscures from us the wonder
4620,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of our being. It compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to"
4621,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"imagine that which we know. It creates anew the universe, after it has"
4622,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),been annihilated in our minds by the recurrence of impressions blunted
4623,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),by reiteration. It justifies the bold and true words of Tasso: _Non
4624,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"merita nome di creatore, se non Iddio ed il Poeta_."
4625,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4626,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"A poet, as he is the author to others of the highest wisdom, pleasure,"
4627,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"virtue and glory, so he ought personally to be the happiest, the best,"
4628,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the wisest, and the most illustrious of men. As to his glory, let time"
4629,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),be challenged to declare whether the fame of any other institutor of
4630,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"human life be comparable to that of a poet. That he is the wisest, the"
4631,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"happiest, and the best, inasmuch as he is a poet, is equally"
4632,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),incontrovertible: the greatest poets have been men of the most
4633,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"spotless virtue, of the most consummate prudence, and, if we would"
4634,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"look into the interior of their lives, the most fortunate of men: and"
4635,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the exceptions, as they regard those who possessed the poetic faculty"
4636,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"in a high yet inferior degree, will be found on consideration to"
4637,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),confine rather than destroy the rule. Let us for a moment stoop to the
4638,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"arbitration of popular breath, and usurping and uniting in our own"
4639,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"persons the incompatible characters of accuser, witness, judge, and"
4640,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"executioner, let us decide without trial, testimony, or form, that"
4641,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),certain motives of those who are 'there sitting where we dare not
4642,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"soar', are reprehensible. Let us assume that Homer was a drunkard,"
4643,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"that Virgil was a flatterer, that Horace was a coward, that Tasso was"
4644,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"a madman, that Lord Bacon was a peculator, that Raphael was a"
4645,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"libertine, that Spenser was a poet laureate. It is inconsistent with"
4646,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"this division of our subject to cite living poets, but posterity has"
4647,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),done ample justice to the great names now referred to. Their errors
4648,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),have been weighed and found to have been dust in the balance; if their
4649,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"sins 'were as scarlet, they are now white as snow': they have been"
4650,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"washed in the blood of the mediator and redeemer, Time. Observe in"
4651,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),what a ludicrous chaos the imputations of real or fictitious crime
4652,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),have been confused in the contemporary calumnies against poetry and
4653,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"poets; consider how little is, as it appears--or appears, as it is;"
4654,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"look to your own motives, and judge not, lest ye be judged."
4655,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4656,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Poetry, as has been said, differs in this respect from logic, that it"
4657,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"is not subject to the control of the active powers of the mind, and"
4658,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),that its birth and recurrence have no necessary connexion with the
4659,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),consciousness or will. It is presumptuous to determine that these are
4660,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the necessary conditions of all mental causation, when mental effects"
4661,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),are experienced unsusceptible of being referred to them. The frequent
4662,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"recurrence of the poetical power, it is obvious to suppose, may"
4663,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),produce in the mind a habit of order and harmony correlative with its
4664,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),own nature and with its effects upon other minds. But in the intervals
4665,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"of inspiration, and they may be frequent without being durable, a poet"
4666,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"becomes a man, and is abandoned to the sudden reflux of the influences"
4667,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),under which others habitually live. But as he is more delicately
4668,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"organized than other men, and sensible to pain and pleasure, both his"
4669,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"own and that of others, in a degree unknown to them, he will avoid the"
4670,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),one and pursue the other with an ardour proportioned to this
4671,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"difference. And he renders himself obnoxious to calumny, when he"
4672,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),neglects to observe the circumstances under which these objects of
4673,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),universal pursuit and flight have disguised themselves in one
4674,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),another's garments.
4675,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4676,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"But there is nothing necessarily evil in this error, and thus cruelty,"
4677,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"envy, revenge, avarice, and the passions purely evil, have never"
4678,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),formed any portion of the popular imputations on the lives of poets.
4679,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4680,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),I have thought it most favourable to the cause of truth to set down
4681,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),these remarks according to the order in which they were suggested to
4682,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"my mind, by a consideration of the subject itself, instead of"
4683,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),observing the formality of a polemical reply; but if the view which
4684,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"they contain be just, they will be found to involve a refutation of"
4685,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"the arguers against poetry, so far at least as regards the first"
4686,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),division of the subject. I can readily conjecture what should have
4687,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),moved the gall of some learned and intelligent writers who quarrel
4688,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"with certain versifiers; I confess myself, like them, unwilling to be"
4689,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),stunned by the Theseids of the hoarse Codri of the day. Bavius and
4690,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"Maevius undoubtedly are, as they ever were, insufferable persons. But"
4691,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),it belongs to a philosophical critic to distinguish rather than
4692,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),confound.
4693,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4694,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The first part of these remarks has related to poetry in its elements
4695,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and principles; and it has been shown, as well as the narrow limits"
4696,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"assigned them would permit, that what is called poetry, in a"
4697,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"restricted sense, has a common source with all other forms of order"
4698,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"and of beauty, according to which the materials of human life are"
4699,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"susceptible of being arranged, and which is poetry in a universal"
4700,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),sense.
4701,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),
4702,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),The second part[13] will have for its object an application of these
4703,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"principles to the present state of the cultivation of poetry, and a"
4704,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),defence of the attempt to idealize the modern forms of manners and
4705,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"opinions, and compel them into a subordination to the imaginative and"
4706,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"creative faculty. For the literature of England, an energetic"
4707,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),development of which has ever preceded or accompanied a great and free
4708,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"development of the national will, has arisen as it were from a new"
4709,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),birth. In spite of the low-thoughted envy which would undervalue
4710,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"contemporary merit, our own will be a memorable age in intellectual"
4711,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"achievements, and we live among such philosophers and poets as surpass"
4712,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),beyond comparison any who have appeared since the last national
4713,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"struggle for civil and religious liberty. The most unfailing herald,"
4714,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"companion, and follower of the awakening of a great people to work a"
4715,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"beneficial change in opinion or institution, is poetry. At such"
4716,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),periods there is an accumulation of the power of communicating and
4717,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),receiving intense and impassioned conceptions respecting man and
4718,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"nature. The persons in whom this power resides may often, as far as"
4719,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"regards many portions of their nature, have little apparent"
4720,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),correspondence with that spirit of good of which they are the
4721,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"ministers. But even whilst they deny and abjure, they are yet"
4722,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"compelled to serve, the power which is seated on the throne of their"
4723,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),own soul. It is impossible to read the compositions of the most
4724,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),celebrated writers of the present day without being startled with the
4725,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),electric life which burns within their words. They measure the
4726,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),circumference and sound the depths of human nature with a
4727,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"comprehensive and all-penetrating spirit, and they are themselves"
4728,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),perhaps the most sincerely astonished at its manifestations; for it is
4729,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),less their spirit than the spirit of the age. Poets are the
4730,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the
4731,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words
4732,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to
4733,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved"
4734,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),"not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the"
4735,A DEFENCE OF POETRY (1821),world.

4749,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),My father was a Dissenting Minister at Wem in Shropshire; and in the

4751,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"'dreaded name of Demogorgon') Mr. Coleridge came to Shrewsbury, to"
4752,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),succeed Mr. Rowe in the spiritual charge of a Unitarian congregation
4753,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),there. He did not come till late on the Saturday afternoon before he
4754,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was to preach; and Mr. Rowe, who himself went down to the coach in a"
4755,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),state of anxiety and expectation to look for the arrival of his
4756,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"successor, could find no one at all answering the description but a"
4757,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),round-faced man in a short black coat (like a shooting-jacket) which
4758,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"hardly seemed to have been made for him, but who seemed to be talking"
4759,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),at a great rate to his fellow-passengers. Mr. Rowe had scarce returned
4760,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to give an account of his disappointment, when the round-faced man in"
4761,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"black entered, and dissipated all doubts on the subject, by beginning"
4762,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to talk. He did not cease while he stayed; nor has he since, that I"

4764,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"for three weeks that he remained there, 'fluttering the _proud"

4775,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),I had no notion then that I should ever be able to express my

4779,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"helpless, like a worm by the way-side, crushed, bleeding, lifeless;"

4787,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"unsatisfied; my heart, shut up in the prison-house of this rude clay,"
4788,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"has never found, nor will it ever find, a heart to speak to; but that"

4803,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),probable successor; but in the meantime I had gone to hear him preach

4805,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"a Unitarian pulpit to preach the Gospel, was a romance in these"

4818,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"he went up into the mountain to pray, HIMSELF, ALONE.' As he gave out"
4819,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"this text, his voice 'rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,'"
4820,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and when he came to the two last words, which he pronounced loud,"
4821,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"deep, and distinct, it seemed to me, who was then young, as if the"
4822,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and as if that"
4823,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe. The
4824,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"idea of St. John came into mind, 'of one crying in the wilderness, who"
4825,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"had his loins girt about, and whose food was locusts and wild honey.'"
4826,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"The preacher then launched into his subject, like an eagle dallying"
4827,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),with the wind. The sermon was upon peace and war; upon church and
4828,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"state--not their alliance, but their separation--on the spirit of the"
4829,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"world and the spirit of Christianity, not as the same, but as opposed"
4830,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),to one another. He talked of those who had 'inscribed the cross of
4831,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Christ on banners dripping with human gore.' He made a poetical and
4832,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pastoral excursion,--and to show the fatal effects of war, drew a"
4833,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"striking contrast between the simple shepherd boy, driving his team"
4834,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"afield, or sitting under the hawthorn, piping to his flock, 'as though"
4835,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"he should never be old,' and the same poor country-lad, crimped,"
4836,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"kidnapped, brought into town, made drunk at an alehouse, turned into a"
4837,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"wretched drummer-boy, with his hair sticking on end with powder and"
4838,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pomatum, a long cue at his back, and tricked out in the loathsome"
4839,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),finery of the profession of blood.
4840,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4841,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Such were the notes our once-lov'd poet sung.
4842,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4843,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"And for myself, I could not have been more delighted if I had heard"
4844,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the music of the spheres. Poetry and Philosophy had met together,"
4845,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with the sanction of"
4846,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Religion. This was even beyond my hopes. I returned home well
4847,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),satisfied. The sun that was still labouring pale and wan through the
4848,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sky, obscured by thick mists, seemed an emblem of the _good cause_;"
4849,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),and the cold dank drops of dew that hung half-melted on the beard of
4850,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the thistle, had something genial and refreshing in them; for there"
4851,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was a spirit of hope and youth in all nature, that turned everything"
4852,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),into good The face of nature had not then the brand of JUS DIVINUM on
4853,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),it:
4854,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4855,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe.
4856,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4857,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"On the Tuesday following, the half-inspired speaker came. I was called"
4858,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"down into the room where he was, and went half-hoping, half-afraid. He"
4859,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"received me very graciously, and I listened for a long time without"
4860,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),uttering a word. I did not suffer in his opinion by my silence. 'For
4861,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"those two hours,' he afterwards was pleased to say, 'he was conversing"
4862,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),with W. H.'s forehead!' His appearance was different from what I had
4863,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"anticipated from seeing him before. At a distance, and in the dim"
4864,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"light of the chapel, there was to me a strange wildness in his aspect,"
4865,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"a dusky obscurity, and I thought him pitted with the small-pox. His"
4866,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"complexion was at that time clear, and even bright--"
4867,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4868,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),As are the children of yon azure sheen.
4869,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4870,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"His forehead was broad and high, light as if built of ivory, with"
4871,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"large projecting eyebrows, and his eyes rolling beneath them like a"
4872,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),sea with darkened lustre. 'A certain tender bloom his face
4873,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"o'erspread,' a purple tinge as we see it in the pale thoughtful"
4874,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"complexions of the Spanish portrait-painters, Murillo and Velasquez."
4875,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"His mouth was gross, voluptuous, open, eloquent; his chin"
4876,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"good-humoured and round; but his nose, the rudder of the face, the"
4877,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"index of the will, was small, feeble, nothing--like what he has done."
4878,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),It might seem that the genius of his face as from a height surveyed
4879,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),and projected him (with sufficient capacity and huge aspiration) into
4880,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the world unknown of thought and imagination, with nothing to support"
4881,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"or guide his veering purpose, as if Columbus had launched his"
4882,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"adventurous course for the New World in a scallop, without oars or"
4883,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),compass. So at least I comment on it after the event. Coleridge in his
4884,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"person was rather above the common size, inclining to the corpulent,"
4885,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"or like Lord Hamlet, 'somewhat fat and pursy.' His hair (now, alas!"
4886,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"grey) was then black and glossy as the raven's, and fell in smooth"
4887,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),masses over his forehead. This long pendulous hair is peculiar to
4888,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"enthusiasts, to those whose minds tend heavenward; and is"
4889,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),traditionally inseparable (though of a different colour) from the
4890,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pictures of Christ. It ought to belong, as a character to all who"
4891,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"preach _Christ crucified_, and Coleridge was at that time one of"
4892,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),those!
4893,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4894,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"It was curious to observe the contrast between him and my father, who"
4895,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was a veteran in the cause, and then declining into the vale of years."
4896,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"He had been a poor Irish lad, carefully brought up by his parents, and"
4897,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),sent to the University of Glasgow (where he studied under Adam Smith)
4898,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),to prepare him for his future destination. It was his mother's
4899,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),proudest wish to see her son a Dissenting Minister. So if we look back
4900,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to past generations (as far as eye can reach) we see the same hopes,"
4901,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"fears, wishes, followed by the same disappointments, throbbing in the"
4902,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),human heart; and so we may see them (if we look forward) rising up for
4903,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"ever, and disappearing, like vapourish bubbles, in the human breast!"
4904,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),After being tossed about from congregation to congregation in the
4905,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"heats of the Unitarian controversy, and squabbles about the American"
4906,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"war, he had been relegated to an obscure village, where he was to"
4907,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"spend the last thirty years of his life, far from the only converse"
4908,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that he loved, the talk about disputed texts of Scripture and the"
4909,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"cause of civil and religious liberty. Here he passed his days,"
4910,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"repining but resigned, in the study of the Bible, and the perusal of"
4911,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the Commentators--huge folios, not easily got through, one of which"
4912,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),would outlast a winter! Why did he pore on these from morn to night
4913,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),(with the exception of a walk in the fields or a turn in the garden to
4914,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"gather broccoli-plants or kidney-beans of his own rearing, with no"
4915,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),small degree of pride and pleasure)?--Here were 'no figures nor no
4916,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"fantasies,'--neither poetry nor philosophy--nothing to dazzle, nothing"
4917,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),to excite modern curiosity; but to his lack-lustre eyes there
4918,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"appeared, within the pages of the ponderous, unwieldy, neglected"
4919,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"tomes, the sacred name of JEHOVAH in Hebrew capitals: pressed down by"
4920,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the weight of the style, worn to the last fading thinness of the"
4921,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"understanding, there were glimpses, glimmering notions of the"
4922,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"patriarchal wanderings, with palm-trees hovering in the horizon, and"
4923,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),processions of camels at the distance of three thousand years; there
4924,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was Moses with the Burning Bush, the number of the Twelve Tribes,"
4925,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"types, shadows, glosses on the law and the prophets; there were"
4926,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"discussions (dull enough) on the age of Methuselah, a mighty"
4927,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"speculation! there were outlines, rude guesses at the shape of Noah's"
4928,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Ark and at the riches of Solomon's Temple; questions as to the date of
4929,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the creation, predictions of the end of all things; the great lapses"
4930,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"of time, the strange mutations of the globe were unfolded with the"
4931,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"voluminous leaf, as it turned over; and though the soul might slumber"
4932,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"with an hieroglyphic veil of inscrutable mysteries drawn over it, yet"
4933,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),it was in a slumber ill-exchanged for all the sharpened realities of
4934,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sense, wit, fancy, or reason. My father's life was comparatively a"
4935,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"dream; but it was a dream of infinity and eternity, of death, the"
4936,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"resurrection, and a judgement to come!"
4937,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
4938,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),No two individuals were ever more unlike than were the host and his
4939,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),guest. A poet was to my father a sort of nondescript: yet whatever
4940,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),added grace to the Unitarian cause was to him welcome. He could hardly
4941,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"have been more surprised or pleased, if our visitor had worn wings."
4942,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Indeed, his thoughts had wings; and as the silken sounds rustled round"
4943,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"our little wainscoted parlour, my father threw back his spectacles"
4944,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"over his forehead, his white hairs mixing with its sanguine hue; and a"
4945,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"smile of delight beamed across his rugged cordial face, to think that"
4946,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Truth had found a new ally in Fancy![14] Besides, Coleridge seemed to"
4947,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"take considerable notice of me, and that of itself was enough. He"
4948,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"talked very familiarly, but agreeably, and glanced over a variety of"
4949,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"subjects. At dinner-time he grew more animated, and dilated in a very"
4950,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"edifying manner on Mary Wollstonecraft and Mackintosh. The last, he"
4951,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"said, he considered (on my father's speaking of his _Vindiciae"
4952,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Gallicae_ as a capital performance) as a clever scholastic man--a
4953,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"master of the topics,--or as the ready warehouseman of letters, who"
4954,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"knew exactly where to lay his hand on what he wanted, though the goods"
4955,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"were not his own. He thought him no match for Burke, either in style"
4956,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"or matter. Burke was a metaphysician, Mackintosh a mere logician."
4957,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Burke was an orator (almost a poet) who reasoned in figures, because"
4958,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"he had an eye for nature: Mackintosh, on the other hand, was a"
4959,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"rhetorician, who had only an eye to commonplaces. On this I ventured"
4960,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to say that I had always entertained a great opinion of Burke, and"
4961,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),that (as far as I could find) the speaking of him with contempt might
4962,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),be made the test of a vulgar democratical mind. This was the first
4963,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"observation I ever made to Coleridge, and he said it was a very just"
4964,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),and striking one. I remember the leg of Welsh mutton and the turnips
4965,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),on the table that day had the finest flavour imaginable. Coleridge
4966,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"added that Mackintosh and Tom Wedgwood (of whom, however, he spoke"
4967,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),highly) had expressed a very indifferent opinion of his friend Mr.
4968,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Wordsworth, on which he remarked to them--'He strides on so far before"
4969,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"you, that he dwindles in the distance!' Godwin had once boasted to him"
4970,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),of having carried on an argument with Mackintosh for three hours with
4971,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),dubious success; Coleridge told him--'If there had been a man of
4972,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),genius in the room he would have settled the question in five
4973,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"minutes.' He asked me if I had ever seen Mary Wollstonecraft, and I"
4974,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"said, I had once for a few moments, and that she seemed to me to turn"
4975,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),off Godwin's objections to something she advanced with quite a
4976,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"playful, easy air. He replied, that 'this was only one instance of the"
4977,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),ascendancy which people of imagination exercised over those of mere
4978,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),intellect.' He did not rate Godwin very high[15] (this was caprice or
4979,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"prejudice, real or affected) but he had a great idea of Mrs."
4980,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Wollstonecraft's powers of conversation, none at all of her talent for"
4981,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),book-making. We talked a little about Holcroft. He had been asked if
4982,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"he was not much struck _with_ him, and he said, he thought himself in"
4983,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),more danger of being struck _by_ him. I complained that he would not
4984,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"let me get on at all, for he required a definition of every the"
4985,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"commonest word, exclaiming, 'What do you mean by a _sensation_, Sir?"
4986,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"What do you mean by an _idea_?' This, Coleridge said, was barricadoing"
4987,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the road to truth:--it was setting up a turnpike-gate at every step we
4988,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"took. I forget a great number of things, many more than I remember;"
4989,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"but the day passed off pleasantly, and the next morning Mr. Coleridge"
4990,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was to return to Shrewsbury. When I came down to breakfast, I found"
4991,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that he had just received a letter from his friend, T. Wedgwood,"
4992,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),making him an offer of 150_l._ a year if he chose to waive his present
4993,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pursuit, and devote himself entirely to the study of poetry and"
4994,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),philosophy. Coleridge seemed to make up his mind to close with this
4995,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),proposal in the act of tying on one of his shoes. It threw an
4996,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),additional damp on his departure. It took the wayward enthusiast quite
4997,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"from us to cast him into Deva's winding vales, or by the shores of old"
4998,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"romance. Instead of living at ten miles' distance, of being the pastor"
4999,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"of a Dissenting congregation at Shrewsbury, he was henceforth to"
5000,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"inhabit the Hill of Parnassus, to be a Shepherd on the Delectable"
5001,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Mountains. Alas! I knew not the way thither, and felt very little"
5002,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),gratitude for Mr. Wedgwood's bounty. I was presently relieved from
5003,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"this dilemma; for Mr. Coleridge, asking for a pen and ink, and going"
5004,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to a table to write something on a bit of card, advanced towards me"
5005,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"with undulating step, and giving me the precious document, said that"
5006,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that was his address, _Mr. Coleridge, Nether-Stowey, Somersetshire_;"
5007,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and that he should be glad to see me there in a few weeks' time, and,"
5008,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"if I chose, would come half-way to meet me. I was not less surprised"
5009,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),than the shepherd-boy (this simile is to be found in _Cassandra_) when
5010,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),he sees a thunderbolt fall close at his feet. I stammered out my
5011,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),acknowledgements and acceptance of this offer (I thought Mr.
5012,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Wedgwood's annuity a trifle to it) as well as I could; and this mighty
5013,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"business being settled, the poet-preacher took leave, and I"
5014,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),accompanied him six miles on the road. It was a fine morning in the
5015,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"middle of winter, and he talked the whole way. The scholar in Chaucer"
5016,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),is described as going
5017,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5018,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),----Sounding on his way.
5019,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5020,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),[14] My father was one of those who mistook his talent after
5021,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),all. He used to be very much dissatisfied that I preferred
5022,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),his Letters to his Sermons. The last were forced and dry; the
5023,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"first came naturally from him. For ease, half-plays on words,"
5024,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and a supine, monkish, indolent pleasantry, I have never seen"
5025,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),them equalled.
5026,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5027,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),[15] He complained in particular of the presumption of his
5028,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"attempting to establish the future immortality of man,"
5029,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),'without' (as he said) 'knowing what Death was or what Life
5030,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),was'--and the tone in which he pronounced these two words
5031,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),seemed to convey a complete image of both.
5032,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5033,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"So Coleridge went on his. In digressing, in dilating, in passing from"
5034,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"subject to subject, he appeared to me to float in air, to slide on"
5035,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),ice. He told me in confidence (going along) that he should have
5036,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"preached two sermons before he accepted the situation at Shrewsbury,"
5037,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"one on Infant Baptism, the other on the Lord's Supper, showing that he"
5038,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"could not administer either, which would have effectually disqualified"
5039,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),him for the object in view. I observed that he continually crossed me
5040,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),on the way by shifting from one side of the footpath to the other.
5041,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),This struck me as an odd movement; but I did not at that time connect
5042,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"it with any instability of purpose or involuntary change of principle,"
5043,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),as I have done since. He seemed unable to keep on in a straight line.
5044,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),He spoke slightingly of Hume (whose Essay on Miracles he said was
5045,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),stolen from an objection started in one of South's Sermons--_Credat
5046,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Judaeus Apella!_). I was not very much pleased at this account of
5047,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Hume, for I had just been reading, with infinite relish, that"
5048,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"completest of all metaphysical _choke-pears_, his _Treatise on Human"
5049,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Nature_, to which the _Essays_, in point of scholastic subtlety and"
5050,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"close reasoning, are mere elegant trifling, light summer-reading."
5051,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Coleridge even denied the excellence of Hume's general style, which I"
5052,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),think betrayed a want of taste or candour. He however made me amends
5053,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),by the manner in which he spoke of Berkeley. He dwelt particularly on
5054,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),his _Essay on Vision_ as a masterpiece of analytical reasoning. So it
5055,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),undoubtedly is. He was exceedingly angry with Dr. Johnson for striking
5056,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the stone with his foot, in allusion to this author's Theory of Matter"
5057,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and Spirit, and saying, 'Thus I confute him, Sir.' Coleridge drew a"
5058,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),parallel (I don't know how he brought about the connexion) between
5059,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Bishop Berkeley and Tom Paine. He said the one was an instance of a
5060,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"subtle, the other of an acute mind, than which no two things could be"
5061,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"more distinct. The one was a shop-boy's quality, the other the"
5062,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),characteristic of a philosopher. He considered Bishop Butler as a true
5063,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"philosopher, a profound and conscientious thinker, a genuine reader of"
5064,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"nature and his own mind. He did not speak of his _Analogy_, but of his"
5065,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"_Sermons at the Rolls' Chapel_, of which I had never heard. Coleridge"
5066,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),somehow always contrived to prefer the _unknown_ to the _known_. In
5067,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"this instance he was right. The _Analogy_ is a tissue of sophistry, of"
5068,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"wire-drawn, theological special-pleading; the _Sermons_ (with the"
5069,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Preface to them) are in a fine vein of deep, matured reflection, a"
5070,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"candid appeal to our observation of human nature, without pedantry and"
5071,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"without bias. I told Coleridge I had written a few remarks, and was"
5072,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),sometimes foolish enough to believe that I had made a discovery on the
5073,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),same subject (the _Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind_)--and
5074,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I tried to explain my view of it to Coleridge, who listened with great"
5075,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"willingness, but I did not succeed in making myself understood. I sat"
5076,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"down to the task shortly afterwards for the twentieth time, got new"
5077,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pens and paper, determined to make clear work of it, wrote a few"
5078,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),meagre sentences in the skeleton style of a mathematical
5079,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"demonstration, stopped half-way down the second page; and, after"
5080,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"trying in vain to pump up any words, images, notions, apprehensions,"
5081,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"facts, or observations, from that gulf of abstraction in which I had"
5082,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"plunged myself for four or five years preceding, gave up the attempt"
5083,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"as labour in vain, and shed tears of helpless despondency on the blank"
5084,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),unfinished paper. I can write fast enough now. Am I better than I was
5085,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"then? Oh no! One truth discovered, one pang of regret at not being"
5086,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"able to express it, is better than all the fluency and flippancy in"
5087,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the world. Would that I could go back to what I then was! Why can we
5088,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),not revive past times as we can revisit old places? If I had the
5089,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"quaint Muse of Sir Philip Sidney to assist me, I would write a _Sonnet"
5090,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to the Road between Wem and Shrewsbury_, and immortalize every step"
5091,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),of it by some fond enigmatical conceit. I would swear that the very
5092,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"milestones had ears, and that Harmer-hill stooped with all its pines,"
5093,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to listen to a poet, as he passed! I remember but one other topic of"
5094,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"discourse in this walk. He mentioned Paley, praised the naturalness"
5095,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and clearness of his style, but condemned his sentiments, thought him"
5096,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"a mere time-serving casuist, and said that 'the fact of his work on"
5097,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Moral and Political Philosophy being made a text-book in our
5098,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Universities was a disgrace to the national character.' We parted at
5099,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the six-mile stone; and I returned homeward pensive but much pleased.
5100,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),I had met with unexpected notice from a person whom I believed to have
5101,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),been prejudiced against me. 'Kind and affable to me had been his
5102,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"condescension, and should be honoured ever with suitable regard.' He"
5103,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was the first poet I had known, and he certainly answered to that"
5104,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"inspired name. I had heard a great deal of his powers of conversation,"
5105,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and was not disappointed. In fact, I never met with any thing at all"
5106,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"like them, either before or since. I could easily credit the accounts"
5107,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),which were circulated of his holding forth to a large party of ladies
5108,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and gentlemen, an evening or two before, on the Berkeleian Theory,"
5109,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),when he made the whole material universe look like a transparency of
5110,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),fine words; and another story (which I believe he has somewhere told
5111,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"himself) of his being asked to a party at Birmingham, of his smoking"
5112,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"tobacco and going to sleep after dinner on a sofa, where the company"
5113,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"found him to their no small surprise, which was increased to wonder"
5114,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"when he started up of a sudden, and rubbing his eyes, looked about"
5115,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"him, and launched into a three hours' description of the third"
5116,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"heaven, of which he had had a dream, very different from Mr. Southey's"
5117,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Vision of Judgement, and also from that other Vision of Judgement,"
5118,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"which Mr. Murray, the Secretary of the Bridge Street Junto, has taken"
5119,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),into his especial keeping.
5120,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5121,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"On my way back, I had a sound in my ears, it was the voice of Fancy: I"
5122,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"had a light before me, it was the face of Poetry. The one still"
5123,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"lingers there, the other has not quitted my side! Coleridge in truth"
5124,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"met me half-way on the ground of philosophy, or I should not have been"
5125,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"won over to his imaginative creed. I had an uneasy, pleasurable"
5126,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sensation all the time, till I was to visit him. During those months"
5127,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the chill breath of winter gave me a welcoming; the vernal air was
5128,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"balm and inspiration to me. The golden sunsets, the silver star of"
5129,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"evening, lighted me on my way to new hopes and prospects. _I was to"
5130,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),visit Coleridge in the Spring._ This circumstance was never absent
5131,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"from my thoughts, and mingled with all my feelings. I wrote to him at"
5132,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the time proposed, and received an answer postponing my intended visit"
5133,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"for a week or two, but very cordially urging me to complete my promise"
5134,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"then. This delay did not damp, but rather increase my ardour. In the"
5135,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"meantime I went to Llangollen Vale, by way of initiating myself in the"
5136,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),mysteries of natural scenery; and I must say I was enchanted with it.
5137,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I had been reading Coleridge's description of England, in his fine"
5138,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"_Ode on the Departing Year_, and I applied it, _con amore_, to the"
5139,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),objects before me. That valley was to me (in a manner) the cradle of a
5140,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"new existence: in the river that winds through it, my spirit was"
5141,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),baptized in the waters of Helicon!
5142,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5143,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I returned home, and soon after set out on my journey with unworn"
5144,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"heart and untried feet. My way lay through Worcester and Gloucester,"
5145,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and by Upton, where I thought of Tom Jones and the adventure of the"
5146,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"muff. I remember getting completely wet through one day, and stopping"
5147,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),at an inn (I think it was at Tewkesbury) where I sat up all night to
5148,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),read _Paul and Virginia_. Sweet were the showers in early youth that
5149,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"drenched my body, and sweet the drops of pity that fell upon the books"
5150,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I read! I recollect a remark of Coleridge's upon this very book, that"
5151,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),nothing could show the gross indelicacy of French manners and the
5152,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),entire corruption of their imagination more strongly than the
5153,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"behaviour of the heroine in the last fatal scene, who turns away from"
5154,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"a person on board the sinking vessel, that offers to save her life,"
5155,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),because he has thrown off his clothes to assist him in swimming. Was
5156,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),this a time to think of such a circumstance? I once hinted to
5157,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Wordsworth, as we were sailing in his boat on Grasmere lake, that I"
5158,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),thought he had borrowed the idea of his _Poems on the Naming of
5159,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Places_ from the local inscriptions of the same kind in _Paul and
5160,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Virginia_. He did not own the obligation, and stated some distinction"
5161,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"without a difference, in defence of his claim to originality. And the"
5162,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),slightest variation would be sufficient for this purpose in his mind;
5163,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),for whatever _he_ added or omitted would inevitably be worth all that
5164,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"any one else had done, and contain the marrow of the sentiment.--I was"
5165,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"still two days before the time fixed for my arrival, for I had taken"
5166,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"care to set out early enough. I stopped these two days at Bridgewater,"
5167,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and when I was tired of sauntering on the banks of its muddy river,"
5168,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"returned to the inn, and read _Camilla_. So have I loitered my life"
5169,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"away, reading books, looking at pictures, going to plays, hearing,"
5170,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"thinking, writing on what pleased me best. I have wanted only one"
5171,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"thing to make me happy; but wanting that, have wanted everything!"
5172,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5173,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I arrived, and was well received. The country about Nether Stowey is"
5174,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"beautiful, green and hilly, and near the sea-shore. I saw it but the"
5175,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"other day, after an interval of twenty years, from a hill near"
5176,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Taunton. How was the map of my life spread out before me, as the map"
5177,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"of the country lay at my feet! In the afternoon, Coleridge took me"
5178,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"over to All-Foxden, a romantic old family mansion of the St. Aubins,"
5179,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),where Wordsworth lived. It was then in the possession of a friend of
5180,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the poet's, who gave him the free use of it. Somehow that period (the"
5181,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),time just after the French Revolution) was not a time when _nothing
5182,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was given for nothing_. The mind opened, and a softness might be"
5183,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"perceived coming over the heart of individuals, beneath 'the scales"
5184,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that fence' our self-interest. Wordsworth himself was from home, but"
5185,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"his sister kept house, and set before us a frugal repast; and we had"
5186,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"free access to her brother's poems, the _Lyrical Ballads_, which were"
5187,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"still in manuscript, or in the form of _Sibylline Leaves_. I dipped"
5188,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"into a few of these with great satisfaction, and with the faith of a"
5189,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"novice. I slept that night in an old room with blue hangings, and"
5190,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),covered with the round-faced family-portraits of the age of George I
5191,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and II, and from the wooded declivity of the adjoining park that"
5192,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"overlooked my window, at the dawn of day, could"
5193,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5194,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),----hear the loud stag speak.
5195,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5196,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),In the outset of life (and particularly at this time I felt it so) our
5197,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),imagination has a body to it. We are in a state between sleeping and
5198,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"waking, and have indistinct but glorious glimpses of strange shapes,"
5199,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),and there is always something to come better than what we see. As in
5200,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),our dreams the fullness of the blood gives warmth and reality to the
5201,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"coinage of the brain, so in youth our ideas are clothed, and fed, and"
5202,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),pampered with our good spirits; we breathe thick with thoughtless
5203,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"happiness, the weight of future years presses on the strong pulses of"
5204,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the heart, and we repose with undisturbed faith in truth and good. As"
5205,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"we advance, we exhaust our fund of enjoyment and of hope. We are no"
5206,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"longer wrapped in _lamb's-wool_, lulled in Elysium. As we taste the"
5207,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pleasures of life, their spirit evaporates, the sense palls; and"
5208,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"nothing is left but the phantoms, the lifeless shadows of what _has"
5209,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),been_!
5210,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5211,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"That morning, as soon as breakfast was over, we strolled out into the"
5212,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"park, and seating ourselves on the trunk of an old ash-tree that"
5213,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"stretched along the ground, Coleridge read aloud with a sonorous and"
5214,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"musical voice, the ballad of _Betty Foy_. I was not critically or"
5215,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sceptically inclined. I saw touches of truth and nature, and took the"
5216,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"rest for granted. But in the _Thorn_, the _Mad Mother_, and the"
5217,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"_Complaint of a Poor Indian Woman_, I felt that deeper power and"
5218,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pathos which have been since acknowledged,"
5219,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5220,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"In spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,"
5221,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5222,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),as the characteristics of this author; and the sense of a new style
5223,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),and a new spirit in poetry came over me. It had to me something of
5224,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the effect that arises from the turning up of the fresh soil, or of"
5225,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the first welcome breath of Spring,"
5226,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5227,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),While yet the trembling year is unconfirmed.
5228,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5229,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Coleridge and myself walked back to Stowey that evening, and his voice"
5230,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),sounded high
5231,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5232,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,"
5233,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Fix'd fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,"
5234,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5235,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"as we passed through echoing grove, by fairy stream or waterfall,"
5236,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),gleaming in the summer moonlight! He lamented that Wordsworth was not
5237,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"prone enough to believe in the traditional superstitions of the place,"
5238,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and that there was a something corporeal, a _matter-of-fact-ness_, a"
5239,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"clinging to the palpable, or often to the petty, in his poetry, in"
5240,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),consequence. His genius was not a spirit that descended to him through
5241,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the air; it sprung out of the ground like a flower, or unfolded itself"
5242,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"from a green spray, on which the goldfinch sang. He said, however (if"
5243,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I remember right), that this objection must be confined to his"
5244,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"descriptive pieces, that his philosophic poetry had a grand and"
5245,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"comprehensive spirit in it, so that his soul seemed to inhabit the"
5246,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"universe like a palace, and to discover truth by intuition, rather"
5247,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),than by deduction. The next day Wordsworth arrived from Bristol at
5248,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Coleridge's cottage. I think I see him now. He answered in some degree
5249,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to his friend's description of him, but was more gaunt and Don"
5250,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Quixote-like. He was quaintly dressed (according to the _costume_ of
5251,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),that unconstrained period) in a brown fustian jacket and striped
5252,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pantaloons. There was something of a roll, a lounge in his gait, not"
5253,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"unlike his own Peter Bell. There was a severe, worn pressure of"
5254,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"thought about his temples, a fire in his eye (as if he saw something"
5255,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"in objects more than the outward appearance), an intense high narrow"
5256,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"forehead, a Roman nose, cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling,"
5257,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and a convulsive inclination to laughter about the mouth, a good deal"
5258,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"at variance with the solemn, stately expression of the rest of his"
5259,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),face. Chantrey's bust wants the marking traits; but he was teased into
5260,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"making it regular and heavy: Haydon's head of him, introduced into the"
5261,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"_Entrance of Christ into Jerusalem_, is the most like his drooping"
5262,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),weight of thought and expression. He sat down and talked very
5263,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"naturally and freely, with a mixture of clear gushing accents in his"
5264,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"voice, a deep guttural intonation, and a strong tincture of the"
5265,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"northern _burr_, like the crust on wine. He instantly began to make"
5266,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"havoc of the half of a Cheshire cheese on the table, and said"
5267,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),triumphantly that 'his marriage with experience had not been so
5268,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),productive as Mr. Southey's in teaching him a knowledge of the good
5269,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),things of this life.' He had been to see the _Castle Spectre_ by Monk
5270,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Lewis, while at Bristol, and described it very well. He said 'it"
5271,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),fitted the taste of the audience like a glove.' This _ad captandum_
5272,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"merit was, however, by no means a recommendation of it, according to"
5273,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the severe principles of the new school, which reject rather than"
5274,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"court popular effect. Wordsworth, looking out of the low, latticed"
5275,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"window, said, 'How beautifully the sun sets on that yellow bank!' I"
5276,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"thought within myself, 'With what eyes these poets see nature!' and"
5277,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"ever after, when I saw the sunset stream upon the objects facing it,"
5278,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"conceived I had made a discovery, or thanked Mr. Wordsworth for"
5279,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),having made one for me! We went over to All-Foxden again the day
5280,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"following, and Wordsworth read us the story of Peter Bell in the open"
5281,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),air; and the comment made upon it by his face and voice was very
5282,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),different from that of some later critics! Whatever might be thought
5283,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"of the poem, 'his face was as a book where men might read strange"
5284,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"matters,' and he announced the fate of his hero in prophetic tones."
5285,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),There is a _chaunt_ in the recitation both of Coleridge and
5286,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Wordsworth, which acts as a spell upon the hearer, and disarms the"
5287,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),judgement. Perhaps they have deceived themselves by making habitual
5288,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"use of this ambiguous accompaniment. Coleridge's manner is more full,"
5289,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"animated, and varied; Wordsworth's more equable, sustained, and"
5290,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"internal. The one might be termed more _dramatic_, the other more"
5291,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),_lyrical_. Coleridge has told me that he himself liked to compose in
5292,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"walking over uneven ground, or breaking through the straggling"
5293,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),branches of a copse wood; whereas Wordsworth always wrote (if he
5294,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"could) walking up and down a straight gravel-walk, or in some spot"
5295,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),where the continuity of his verse met with no collateral interruption.
5296,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Returning that same evening, I got into a metaphysical argument with"
5297,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Wordsworth, while Coleridge was explaining the different notes of the"
5298,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"nightingale to his sister, in which we neither of us succeeded in"
5299,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),making ourselves perfectly clear and intelligible. Thus I passed three
5300,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"weeks at Nether Stowey and in the neighbourhood, generally devoting"
5301,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the afternoons to a delightful chat in an arbour made of bark by the
5302,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"poet's friend Tom Poole, sitting under two fine elm-trees, and"
5303,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"listening to the bees humming round us, while we quaffed our _flip_."
5304,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"It was agreed, among other things, that we should make a jaunt down"
5305,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the Bristol Channel, as far as Lynton. We set off together on foot,"
5306,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Coleridge, John Chester, and I. This Chester was a native of Nether"
5307,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Stowey, one of those who were attracted to Coleridge's discourse as"
5308,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"flies are to honey, or bees in swarming-time to the sound of a brass"
5309,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"pan. He 'followed in the chace, like a dog who hunts, not like one"
5310,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that made up the cry.' He had on a brown cloth coat, boots, and"
5311,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"corduroy breeches, was low in stature, bow-legged, had a drag in his"
5312,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"walk like a drover, which he assisted by a hazel switch, and kept on a"
5313,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sort of trot by the side of Coleridge, like a running footman by a"
5314,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"state coach, that he might not lose a syllable or sound, that fell"
5315,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"from Coleridge's lips. He told me his private opinion, that Coleridge"
5316,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"was a wonderful man. He scarcely opened his lips, much less offered an"
5317,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"opinion the whole way: yet of the three, had I to choose during that"
5318,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"journey, I would be John Chester. He afterwards followed Coleridge"
5319,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"into Germany, where the Kantean philosophers were puzzled how to bring"
5320,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),him under any of their categories. When he sat down at table with his
5321,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"idol, John's felicity was complete; Sir Walter Scott's, or Mr."
5322,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Blackwood's, when they sat down at the same table with the King, was"
5323,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"not more so. We passed Dunster on our right, a small town between the"
5324,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),brow of a hill and the sea. I remember eyeing it wistfully as it lay
5325,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"below us: contrasted with the woody scene around, it looked as clear,"
5326,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"as pure, as _embrowned_ and ideal as any landscape I have seen since,"
5327,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),of Gaspar Poussin's or Domenichino's. We had a long day's march--(our
5328,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),feet kept time to the echoes of Coleridge's tongue)--through Minehead
5329,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"and by the Blue Anchor, and on to Lynton, which we did not reach till"
5330,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"near midnight, and where we had some difficulty in making a lodgement."
5331,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"We, however, knocked the people of the house up at last, and we were"
5332,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),repaid for our apprehensions and fatigue by some excellent rashers of
5333,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),fried bacon and eggs. The view in coming along had been splendid. We
5334,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),walked for miles and miles on dark brown heaths overlooking the
5335,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"channel, with the Welsh hills beyond, and at times descended into"
5336,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"little sheltered valleys close by the sea-side, with a smuggler's face"
5337,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"scowling by us, and then had to ascend conical hills with a path"
5338,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"winding up through a coppice to a barren top, like a monk's shaven"
5339,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"crown, from one of which I pointed out to Coleridge's notice the bare"
5340,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"masts of a vessel on the very edge of the horizon, and within the"
5341,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"red-orbed disk of the setting sun, like his own spectre-ship in the"
5342,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),_Ancient Mariner_. At Lynton the character of the sea-coast becomes
5343,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),more marked and rugged. There is a place called the 'Valley of Rocks'
5344,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),(I suspect this was only the poetical name for it) bedded among
5345,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"precipices overhanging the sea, with rocky caverns beneath, into which"
5346,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the waves dash, and where the sea-gull for ever wheels its screaming"
5347,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"flight. On the tops of these are huge stones thrown transverse, as if"
5348,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"an earthquake had tossed them there, and behind these is a fretwork of"
5349,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"perpendicular rocks, something like the 'Giant's Causeway'. A"
5350,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"thunder-storm came on while we were at the inn, and Coleridge was"
5351,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),running out bareheaded to enjoy the commotion of the elements in the
5352,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"'Valley of Rocks', but as if in spite, the clouds only muttered a few"
5353,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"angry sounds, and let fall a few refreshing drops. Coleridge told me"
5354,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),that he and Wordsworth were to have made this place the scene of a
5355,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"prose-tale, which was to have been in the manner of, but far superior"
5356,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"to, the _Death of Abel_, but they had relinquished the design. In the"
5357,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"morning of the second day, we breakfasted luxuriously in an"
5358,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"old-fashioned parlour on tea, toast, eggs, and honey, in the very"
5359,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"sight of the bee-hives from which it had been taken, and a garden full"
5360,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),of thyme and wild flowers that had produced it. On this occasion
5361,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Coleridge spoke of Virgil's _Georgics_, but not well. I do not think"
5362,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),he had much feeling for the classical or elegant. It was in this room
5363,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that we found a little worn-out copy of the _Seasons_, lying in a"
5364,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"window-seat, on which Coleridge exclaimed, '_That_ is true fame!' He"
5365,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"said Thomson was a great poet, rather than a good one; his style was"
5366,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),as meretricious as his thoughts were natural. He spoke of Cowper as
5367,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the best modern poet. He said the _Lyrical Ballads_ were an experiment
5368,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public"
5369,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style
5370,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),than had hitherto been attempted; totally discarding the artifices of
5371,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"poetical diction, and making use only of such words as had probably"
5372,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.
5373,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),Some comparison was introduced between Shakespeare and Milton. He said
5374,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),'he hardly knew which to prefer. Shakespeare appeared to him a mere
5375,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"stripling in the art; he was as tall and as strong, with infinitely"
5376,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"more activity than Milton, but he never appeared to have come to man's"
5377,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"estate; or if he had, he would not have been a man, but a monster.' He"
5378,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"spoke with contempt of Gray, and with intolerance of Pope. He did not"
5379,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),like the versification of the latter. He observed that 'the ears of
5380,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"these couplet-writers might be charged with having short memories,"
5381,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),that could not retain the harmony of whole passages.' He thought
5382,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),little of Junius as a writer; he had a dislike of Dr. Johnson; and a
5383,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"much higher opinion of Burke as an orator and politician, than of Fox"
5384,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),or Pitt. He however thought him very inferior in richness of style and
5385,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"imagery to some of our elder prose-writers, particularly Jeremy"
5386,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Taylor. He liked Richardson, but not Fielding; nor could I get him to"
5387,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"enter into the merits of _Caleb Williams_.[16] In short, he was"
5388,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),profound and discriminating with respect to those authors whom he
5389,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"liked, and where he gave his judgement fair play; capricious,"
5390,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"perverse, and prejudiced in his antipathies and distastes. We loitered"
5391,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"on the 'ribbed sea-sands', in such talk as this, a whole morning, and"
5392,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I recollect met with a curious sea-weed, of which John Chester told us"
5393,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),the country name! A fisherman gave Coleridge an account of a boy that
5394,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"had been drowned the day before, and that they had tried to save him"
5395,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),at the risk of their own lives. He said 'he did not know how it was
5396,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that they ventured, but, Sir, we have a _nature_ towards one another.'"
5397,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"This expression, Coleridge remarked to me, was a fine illustration of"
5398,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),that theory of disinterestedness which I (in common with Butler) had
5399,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),adopted. I broached to him an argument of mine to prove that
5400,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),_likeness_ was not mere association of ideas. I said that the mark in
5401,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the sand put one in mind of a man's foot, not because it was part of a"
5402,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),former impression of a man's foot (for it was quite new) but because
5403,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),it was like the shape of a man's foot. He assented to the justness of
5404,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"this distinction (which I have explained at length elsewhere, for the"
5405,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),benefit of the curious) and John Chester listened; not from any
5406,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"interest in the subject, but because he was astonished that I should"
5407,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),be able to suggest anything to Coleridge that he did not already know.
5408,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"We returned on the third morning, and Coleridge remarked the silent"
5409,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"cottage-smoke curling up the valleys where, a few evenings before, we"
5410,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),had seen the lights gleaming through the dark.
5411,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5412,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"[16] He had no idea of pictures, of Claude or Raphael, and at"
5413,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),this time I had as little as he. He sometimes gives a
5414,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),striking account at present of the Cartoons at Pisa by
5415,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Buffamalco and others; of one in particular, where Death is"
5416,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"seen in the air brandishing his scythe, and the great and"
5417,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"mighty of the earth shudder at his approach, while the"
5418,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),beggars and the wretched kneel to him as their deliverer. He
5419,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"would, of course, understand so broad and fine a moral as"
5420,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),this at any time.
5421,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5422,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"In a day or two after we arrived at Stowey, we set out, I on my return"
5423,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"home, and he for Germany. It was a Sunday morning, and he was to"
5424,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),preach that day for Dr. Toulmin of Taunton. I asked him if he had
5425,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),prepared anything for the occasion? He said he had not even thought of
5426,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the text, but should as soon as we parted. I did not go to hear"
5427,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"him,--this was a fault,--but we met in the evening at Bridgewater. The"
5428,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"next day we had a long day's walk to Bristol, and sat down, I"
5429,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"recollect, by a well-side on the road, to cool ourselves and satisfy"
5430,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"our thirst, when Coleridge repeated to me some descriptive lines of"
5431,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),his tragedy of _Remorse_; which I must say became his mouth and that
5432,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"occasion better than they, some years after, did Mr. Elliston's and"
5433,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"the Drury Lane boards,--"

5435,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"Oh memory! shield me from the world's poor strife,"
5436,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),And give those scenes thine everlasting life.
5437,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),
5438,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"I saw no more of him for a year or two, during which period he had"
5439,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),been wandering in the Hartz Forest in Germany; and his return was
5440,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"cometary, meteorous, unlike his setting out. It was not till some time"
5441,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),after that I knew his friends Lamb and Southey. The last always
5442,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),appears to me (as I first saw him) with a commonplace book under his
5443,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"arm, and the first with a _bon-mot_ in his mouth. It was at Godwin's"
5444,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"that I met him with Holcroft and Coleridge, where they were disputing"
5445,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"fiercely which was the best--_Man as he was, or man as he is to be_."
5446,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"'Give me', says Lamb, 'man as he is _not_ to be.' This saying was the"
5447,MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS (1823),"beginning of a friendship between us, which I believe still"

5469,SACRED POETRY (1825),"least of all admit, with propriety, either in the author or critic,"
5470,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the exercise of intellectual subtlety. For the _practical_ tendency,"
5471,SACRED POETRY (1825),"indeed, of such compositions, both are most deeply responsible; the"
5472,SACRED POETRY (1825),"author who publishes, and the critic who undertakes to recommend or to"
5473,SACRED POETRY (1825),censure them. But if they appear to be written with any degree of
5474,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sincerity and earnestness, we naturally shrink from treating them"
5475,SACRED POETRY (1825),merely as literary efforts. To interrupt the current of a reader's
5476,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sympathy in such a case, by critical objections, is not merely to"
5477,SACRED POETRY (1825),"deprive him of a little harmless pleasure, it is to disturb him almost"
5478,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in a devotional exercise. The most considerate reviewer, therefore, of"
5479,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a volume of sacred poetry, will think it a subject on which it is"
5480,SACRED POETRY (1825),easier to say too much than too little.
5481,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5482,SACRED POETRY (1825),"In the present instance, this consideration is enforced by the"
5483,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unpretending tone of the volume, which bears internal evidence, for"
5484,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the most part, of not having been written to meet the eye of the"
5485,SACRED POETRY (1825),world. It is in vain to say that this claim on the critic's favour is
5486,SACRED POETRY (1825),"nullified by publication. The author may give it up, and yet the work"
5487,SACRED POETRY (1825),may retain it. We may still feel that we have no right to judge
5488,SACRED POETRY (1825),"severely of what was not, at first, intended to come before our"
5489,SACRED POETRY (1825),"judgement at all. This of course applies only to those compositions,"
5490,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which indicate, by something within themselves, this freedom from the"
5491,SACRED POETRY (1825),pretension of authorship. And such are most of those to which we are
5492,SACRED POETRY (1825),now bespeaking our readers' attention.
5493,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5494,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_Most_ of them, we say, because the first poem in the volume, _The"
5495,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Star in the East_, is of a more ambitious and less pleasing character."
5496,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Although in blank verse, it is, in fact, a lyrical effusion; an ode on"
5497,SACRED POETRY (1825),the rapid progress and final triumph of the Gospel. It looks like the
5498,SACRED POETRY (1825),"composition of a young man: harsh and turgid in parts, but"
5499,SACRED POETRY (1825),interspersed with some rather beautiful touches. The opening lines are
5500,SACRED POETRY (1825),a fair specimen.
5501,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5502,SACRED POETRY (1825),"O to have heard th' unearthly symphonies,"
5503,SACRED POETRY (1825),Which o'er the starlight peace of Syrian skies
5504,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Came floating like a dream, that blessed night"
5505,SACRED POETRY (1825),"When angel songs were heard by sinful men,"
5506,SACRED POETRY (1825),Hymning Messiah's advent! O to have watch'd
5507,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The night with those poor shepherds, whom, when first"
5508,SACRED POETRY (1825),The glory of the Lord shed sudden day--
5509,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Day without dawn, starting from midnight, day"
5510,SACRED POETRY (1825),Brighter than morning--on those lonely hills
5511,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Strange fear surpris'd--fear lost in wondering joy,"
5512,SACRED POETRY (1825),When from th' angelic multitude swell'd forth
5513,SACRED POETRY (1825),The many-voicèd consonance of praise:--
5514,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Glory in th' highest to God, and upon earth"
5515,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Peace, towards men good will. But once before,"
5516,SACRED POETRY (1825),"In such glad strains of joyous fellowship,"
5517,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The silent earth was greeted by the heavens,"
5518,SACRED POETRY (1825),When at its first foundation they looked down
5519,SACRED POETRY (1825),"From their bright orbs, those heavenly ministries,"
5520,SACRED POETRY (1825),Hailing the new-born world with bursts of joy.
5521,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5522,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Notwithstanding beauties scattered here and there, there is an effort"
5523,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and constrained stateliness in the poem, very different from the"
5524,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rapidity and simplicity of many of the shorter lyrics, which follow"
5525,SACRED POETRY (1825),"under the titles of Sacred and Domestic Poems. Such, for instance, as"
5526,SACRED POETRY (1825),the Poor Man's Hymn
5527,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5528,SACRED POETRY (1825),As much have I of worldly good
5529,SACRED POETRY (1825),As e'er my master had:
5530,SACRED POETRY (1825),"I diet on as dainty food,"
5531,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And am as richly clad,"
5532,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Tho' plain my garb, though scant my board,"
5533,SACRED POETRY (1825),As Mary's Son and Nature's Lord.
5534,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5535,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The manger was his infant bed,"
5536,SACRED POETRY (1825),"His home, the mountain-cave,"
5537,SACRED POETRY (1825),"He had not where to lay his head,"
5538,SACRED POETRY (1825),He borrow'd even his grave.
5539,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Earth yielded him no resting spot,--"
5540,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Her Maker, but she knew him not."
5541,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5542,SACRED POETRY (1825),"As much the world's good will I bear,"
5543,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Its favours and applause,"
5544,SACRED POETRY (1825),"As He, whose blessed name I bear,--"
5545,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Hated without a cause,"
5546,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Despis'd, rejected, mock'd by pride,"
5547,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Betray'd, forsaken, crucified."
5548,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5549,SACRED POETRY (1825),Why should I court my Master's foe?
5550,SACRED POETRY (1825),Why should I fear its frown?
5551,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Why should I seek for rest below,"
5552,SACRED POETRY (1825),Or sigh for brief renown?--
5553,SACRED POETRY (1825),"A pilgrim to a better land,"
5554,SACRED POETRY (1825),An heir of joys at GOD's right hand?
5555,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5556,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Or the following sweet lines on Home, which occur among the Domestic"
5557,SACRED POETRY (1825),poems:
5558,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5559,SACRED POETRY (1825),"That is not home, where day by day"
5560,SACRED POETRY (1825),I wear the busy hours away.
5561,SACRED POETRY (1825),"That is not home, where lonely night"
5562,SACRED POETRY (1825),Prepares me for the toils of light--
5563,SACRED POETRY (1825),"'Tis hope, and joy, and memory, give"
5564,SACRED POETRY (1825),A home in which the heart can live--
5565,SACRED POETRY (1825),"These walls no lingering hopes endear,"
5566,SACRED POETRY (1825),"No fond remembrance chains me here,"
5567,SACRED POETRY (1825),Cheerless I heave the lonely sigh--
5568,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Eliza, canst thou tell me why?"
5569,SACRED POETRY (1825),"'Tis where thou art is home to me,"
5570,SACRED POETRY (1825),And home without thee cannot be.
5571,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5572,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There are who strangely love to roam,"
5573,SACRED POETRY (1825),And find in wildest haunts their home;
5574,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And some in halls of lordly state,"
5575,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Who yet are homeless, desolate."
5576,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The sailor's home is on the main,"
5577,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The warrior's, on the tented plain,"
5578,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The maiden's, in her bower of rest,"
5579,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The infant's, on his mother's breast--"
5580,SACRED POETRY (1825),"But where thou art is home to me,"
5581,SACRED POETRY (1825),And home without thee cannot be.
5582,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5583,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There is no home in halls of pride,"
5584,SACRED POETRY (1825),"They are too high, and cold, and wide."
5585,SACRED POETRY (1825),No home is by the wanderer found:
5586,SACRED POETRY (1825),'Tis not in place: it hath no bound.
5587,SACRED POETRY (1825),It is a circling atmosphere
5588,SACRED POETRY (1825),Investing all the heart holds dear;--
5589,SACRED POETRY (1825),"A law of strange attractive force,"
5590,SACRED POETRY (1825),That holds the feelings in their course;
5591,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5592,SACRED POETRY (1825),"It is a presence undefin'd,"
5593,SACRED POETRY (1825),"O'er-shadowing the conscious mind,"
5594,SACRED POETRY (1825),Where love and duty sweetly blend
5595,SACRED POETRY (1825),To consecrate the name of friend;--
5596,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Where'er thou art is home to me,"
5597,SACRED POETRY (1825),And home without thee cannot be.
5598,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5599,SACRED POETRY (1825),"My love, forgive the anxious sigh--"
5600,SACRED POETRY (1825),"I hear the moments rushing by,"
5601,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And think that life is fleeting fast,"
5602,SACRED POETRY (1825),That youth with us will soon be past.
5603,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Oh! when will time, consenting, give"
5604,SACRED POETRY (1825),The home in which my heart can live?
5605,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There shall the past and future meet,"
5606,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And o'er our couch, in union sweet,"
5607,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Extend their cherub wings, and shower"
5608,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Bright influence on the present hour,"
5609,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Oh! when shall Israel's mystic guide,"
5610,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The pillar'd cloud, our steps decide,"
5611,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Then, resting, spread its guardian shade,"
5612,SACRED POETRY (1825),To bless the home which love hath made?
5613,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Daily, my love, shall thence arise"
5614,SACRED POETRY (1825),Our hearts' united sacrifice;
5615,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And home indeed a home will be,"
5616,SACRED POETRY (1825),Thus consecrate and shar'd with thee.
5617,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5618,SACRED POETRY (1825),"We will add one more specimen of the same kind, which forms a natural"
5619,SACRED POETRY (1825),and pleasing appendix to the preceding lines.
5620,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5621,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Louise! you wept, that morn of gladness"
5622,SACRED POETRY (1825),Which made your Brother blest;
5623,SACRED POETRY (1825),And tears of half-reproachful sadness
5624,SACRED POETRY (1825),Fell on the Bridegroom's vest:
5625,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Yet, pearly tears were those, to gem"
5626,SACRED POETRY (1825),A Sister's bridal diadem.
5627,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5628,SACRED POETRY (1825),"No words could half so well have spoken,"
5629,SACRED POETRY (1825),What thus was deeply shown
5630,SACRED POETRY (1825),"By Nature's simplest, dearest token,"
5631,SACRED POETRY (1825),How much was then my own;
5632,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Endearing her for whom they fell,"
5633,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And Thee, for having loved so well."
5634,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5635,SACRED POETRY (1825),"But now no more--nor let a Brother,"
5636,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Louise, regretful see,"
5637,SACRED POETRY (1825),"That still 'tis sorrow to another,"
5638,SACRED POETRY (1825),That he should happy be.
5639,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Those were, I trust, the only tears"
5640,SACRED POETRY (1825),That day shall cost through coming years.
5641,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5642,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Smile with us. Happy and light-hearted,"
5643,SACRED POETRY (1825),We three the time will while.
5644,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And, when sometimes a season parted,"
5645,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Still think of us, and smile."
5646,SACRED POETRY (1825),But come to us in gloomy weather;
5647,SACRED POETRY (1825),"We'll weep, when we must weep, together."
5648,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5649,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Now, what is the reason of the great difference between these extracts"
5650,SACRED POETRY (1825),and that from the _Star in the East_?--a difference which the earlier
5651,SACRED POETRY (1825),"date of the latter, so far from accounting for, only makes the more"
5652,SACRED POETRY (1825),"extraordinary. In some instances, the interval of time is very short,"
5653,SACRED POETRY (1825),but at all events more effort and turgidness might have been expected
5654,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in the earlier poems, more simplicity and care and a more subdued tone"
5655,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in the later. We suspect a reason, which both poets and poetical"
5656,SACRED POETRY (1825),readers are too apt to leave out of sight. There is a want of _truth_
5657,SACRED POETRY (1825),in the _Star in the East_--not that the author is otherwise than quite
5658,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in earnest--but his earnestness seems rather an artificial glow, to"
5659,SACRED POETRY (1825),which he has been worked up by reading and conversation of a
5660,SACRED POETRY (1825),"particular cast, than the overflowing warmth of his own natural"
5661,SACRED POETRY (1825),"feelings, kindled by circumstances in which he was himself placed. In"
5662,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a word, when he writes of the success of the Bible Society, and the"
5663,SACRED POETRY (1825),"supposed amelioration of the world in consequence, he writes from"
5664,SACRED POETRY (1825),"report and fancy only; but when he speaks of a happy home, of kindly"
5665,SACRED POETRY (1825),"affections, of the comforts which piety can administer in"
5666,SACRED POETRY (1825),"disappointment and sorrow; either we are greatly mistaken, or he"
5667,SACRED POETRY (1825),speaks from real and present experience. The poetical result is what
5668,SACRED POETRY (1825),the reader has seen:
5669,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5670,SACRED POETRY (1825),"----mens onus reponit, et peregrino"
5671,SACRED POETRY (1825),Labore fessi venimus Larem ad nostrum--
5672,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5673,SACRED POETRY (1825),We turn gladly from our fairy voyage round the world to refresh
5674,SACRED POETRY (1825),"ourselves with a picture, which we feel to be drawn from the life, of"
5675,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a happy and innocent fireside. Nor is it, in the slightest degree,"
5676,SACRED POETRY (1825),"derogatory to an author's talent to say that he has failed,"
5677,SACRED POETRY (1825),"comparatively, on that subject of which he must have known"
5678,SACRED POETRY (1825),comparatively little.
5679,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5680,SACRED POETRY (1825),Let us here pause a moment to explain what is meant when we speak of
5681,SACRED POETRY (1825),"such prospects as are above alluded to, being shadowy and unreal in"
5682,SACRED POETRY (1825),respect of what is matter of experience. It is not that we doubt the
5683,SACRED POETRY (1825),"tenor of the Scripture, regarding the final conversion of the whole"
5684,SACRED POETRY (1825),"world, or that we close our eyes to the wonderful arrangements, if the"
5685,SACRED POETRY (1825),"expression may be used, which Divine Providence seems everywhere"
5686,SACRED POETRY (1825),"making, with a view to that great consummation. One circumstance, in"
5687,SACRED POETRY (1825),"particular, arrests our attention, as pervading the whole of modern"
5688,SACRED POETRY (1825),"history, but gradually standing out in a stronger light as the view"
5689,SACRED POETRY (1825),draws nearer our own times: we mean the rapid increase of colonization
5690,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_from Christian nations only_. So that the larger half of the globe,"
5691,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and what in the nature of things will soon become the more populous,"
5692,SACRED POETRY (1825),"is already, in profession, Christian. The event, therefore, is"
5693,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unquestionable: but experience, we fear, will hardly warrant the"
5694,SACRED POETRY (1825),"exulting anticipations, which our author, in common with many of whose"
5695,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sincerity there is no reason to doubt, has raised upon it. It is but"
5696,SACRED POETRY (1825),"too conceivable that the whole world may become nominally Christian,"
5697,SACRED POETRY (1825),yet the face of things may be very little changed for the better. And
5698,SACRED POETRY (1825),"any view of the progress of the gospel, whether in verse or in prose,"
5699,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which leaves out this possibility, is so far wanting in truth, and in"
5700,SACRED POETRY (1825),that depth of thought which is as necessary to the higher kinds of
5701,SACRED POETRY (1825),poetical beauty as to philosophy or theology itself.
5702,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5703,SACRED POETRY (1825),"This, however, is too solemn and comprehensive a subject to be lightly"
5704,SACRED POETRY (1825),"or hastily spoken of. It is enough to have glanced at it, as"
5705,SACRED POETRY (1825),"accounting, in some measure, for the general failure of modern poets"
5706,SACRED POETRY (1825),in their attempts to describe the predicted triumph of the gospel in
5707,SACRED POETRY (1825),the latter days.
5708,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5709,SACRED POETRY (1825),"To return to the sacred and domestic poems, thus advantageously"
5710,SACRED POETRY (1825),"distinguished from that which gives name to the volume. Affection,"
5711,SACRED POETRY (1825),"whether heavenly or earthly, is the simplest idea that can be; and in"
5712,SACRED POETRY (1825),the graceful and harmonious expression of it lies the principal beauty
5713,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of these poems. In the descriptive parts, and in the development of"
5714,SACRED POETRY (1825),"abstract sentiment, there is more of effort, and occasionally"
5715,SACRED POETRY (1825),"something very like affectation: approaching, in one instance (the"
5716,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_Nightingale_,) far nearer than we could wish, to the most vicious of"
5717,SACRED POETRY (1825),"all styles, the style of Mr. Leigh Hunt and his miserable followers."
5718,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5719,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Now, these are just the sort of merit and the sort of defect, which"
5720,SACRED POETRY (1825),one might naturally expect to find united; the very simplicity of
5721,SACRED POETRY (1825),"attachment, which qualifies the mind for sacred or domestic poetry,"
5722,SACRED POETRY (1825),"making its movements awkward and constrained, when scenes are to be"
5723,SACRED POETRY (1825),"described, or thoughts unravelled of more complication and less"
5724,SACRED POETRY (1825),"immediate interest. This is the rather to be observed, as many other"
5725,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sacred poets have become less generally pleasing and useful, than they"
5726,SACRED POETRY (1825),"otherwise would have been, from this very circumstance. The simple and"
5727,SACRED POETRY (1825),touching devoutness of many of Bishop Ken's lyrical effusions has been
5728,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unregarded, because of the ungraceful contrivances, and heavy movement"
5729,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of his narrative. The same may be said, in our own times, of some"
5730,SACRED POETRY (1825),"parts of Montgomery's writings. His bursts of sacred poetry, compared"
5731,SACRED POETRY (1825),"with his _Greenland_, remind us of a person singing enchantingly by"
5732,SACRED POETRY (1825),"ear, but becoming languid and powerless the moment he sits down to a"
5733,SACRED POETRY (1825),note-book.
5734,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5735,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Such writers, it is obvious, do not sufficiently trust to the command"
5736,SACRED POETRY (1825),which the simple expression of their feelings would obtain over their
5737,SACRED POETRY (1825),readers. They think it must be relieved with something of more variety
5738,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and imagery, to which they work themselves up with laborious, and"
5739,SACRED POETRY (1825),"therefore necessarily unsuccessful, efforts. The model for correcting"
5740,SACRED POETRY (1825),"their error is to be found in the inspired volume. We can, in general,"
5741,SACRED POETRY (1825),"be but incompetent judges of this, because we have been used to it"
5742,SACRED POETRY (1825),"from our boyhood. But let us suppose a person, whose ideas of poetry"
5743,SACRED POETRY (1825),"were entirely gathered from modern compositions, taking up the Psalms"
5744,SACRED POETRY (1825),"for the first time. Among many other remarkable differences, he would"
5745,SACRED POETRY (1825),surely be impressed with the sacred writer's total carelessness about
5746,SACRED POETRY (1825),"originality, and what is technically called _effect_. He would say,"
5747,SACRED POETRY (1825),'This is something better than merely attractive poetry; it is
5748,SACRED POETRY (1825),absolute and divine truth.' The same remark ought to be suggested by
5749,SACRED POETRY (1825),"all sacred hymns; and it is, indeed, greatly to be lamented, that such"
5750,SACRED POETRY (1825),writers as we have just mentioned should have ever lost sight of
5751,SACRED POETRY (1825),"it--should have had so little confidence in the power of simplicity,"
5752,SACRED POETRY (1825),and have condescended so largely to the laborious refinements of the
5753,SACRED POETRY (1825),profane Muse.
5754,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5755,SACRED POETRY (1825),"To put the same truth in a light somewhat different; it is required,"
5756,SACRED POETRY (1825),"we apprehend, in all poets, but particularly in sacred poets, that"
5757,SACRED POETRY (1825),"they should seem to write with a view of unburthening their minds, and"
5758,SACRED POETRY (1825),"not for the sake of writing; for love of the subject, not of the"
5759,SACRED POETRY (1825),employment. The distinction is very striking in descriptive poetry.
5760,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Compare the landscapes of Cowper with those of Burns. There is, if we"
5761,SACRED POETRY (1825),"mistake not, the same sort of difference between them, as in the"
5762,SACRED POETRY (1825),"conversation of two persons on scenery, the one originally an"
5763,SACRED POETRY (1825),"enthusiast in his love of the works of nature, the other driven, by"
5764,SACRED POETRY (1825),"disappointment or weariness, to solace himself with them as he might."
5765,SACRED POETRY (1825),"It is a contrast which every one must have observed, when such topics"
5766,SACRED POETRY (1825),"come under discussion in society; and those who think it worth while,"
5767,SACRED POETRY (1825),may find abundant illustration of it in the writings of this
5768,SACRED POETRY (1825),unfortunate but illustrious pair. The one all overflowing with the
5769,SACRED POETRY (1825),"love of nature, and indicating, at every turn, that whatever his lot"
5770,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in life, he could not have been happy without her. The other visibly"
5771,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and wisely soothing himself, but not without effort, by attending to"
5772,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rural objects, in default of some more congenial happiness, of which"
5773,SACRED POETRY (1825),"he had almost come to despair. The latter, in consequence, laboriously"
5774,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sketching every object that came in his way: the other, in one or two"
5775,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rapid lines, which operate, as it were, like a magician's spell,"
5776,SACRED POETRY (1825),"presenting to the fancy just that picture, which was wanted to put the"
5777,SACRED POETRY (1825),"reader's mind in unison with the writer's. We would quote, as an"
5778,SACRED POETRY (1825),"instance, the description of Evening in the Fourth Book of the _Task_:"
5779,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5780,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Come Ev'ning, once again, season of peace;"
5781,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Return, sweet Ev'ning, and continue long!"
5782,SACRED POETRY (1825),Methinks I see thee in the streaking west
5783,SACRED POETRY (1825),"With matron-step slow-moving, while the night"
5784,SACRED POETRY (1825),Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employ'd
5785,SACRED POETRY (1825),In letting fall the curtain of repose
5786,SACRED POETRY (1825),"On bird and beast, the other charg'd for man"
5787,SACRED POETRY (1825),With sweet oblivion of the cares of day:
5788,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Not sumptuously adorn'd, nor needing aid,"
5789,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Like homely-featur'd night, of clust'ring gems;"
5790,SACRED POETRY (1825),"A star or two, just twinkling on thy brow,"
5791,SACRED POETRY (1825),Suffices thee; save that the moon is thine
5792,SACRED POETRY (1825),"No less than her's, not worn indeed on high"
5793,SACRED POETRY (1825),"With ostentatious pageantry, but set"
5794,SACRED POETRY (1825),"With modest grandeur in thy purple zone,"
5795,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Resplendent less, but of an ampler round."
5796,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Come then, and thou shalt find thy vot'ry calm,"
5797,SACRED POETRY (1825),Or make me so. Composure is thy gift.
5798,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5799,SACRED POETRY (1825),And we would set over against it that purely pastoral chant:
5800,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5801,SACRED POETRY (1825),Now rosy May comes in wi' flowers
5802,SACRED POETRY (1825),"To deck her gay, green spreading bowers;"
5803,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And now comes in my happy hours,"
5804,SACRED POETRY (1825),To wander wi' my Davie.
5805,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Meet me on the warlock knowe,"
5806,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Dainty Davie, dainty Davie,"
5807,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There I'll spend the day wi' you,"
5808,SACRED POETRY (1825),My ain dear dainty Davie.
5809,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5810,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The crystal waters round us fa',"
5811,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The merry birds are lovers a',"
5812,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The scented breezes round us blaw,"
5813,SACRED POETRY (1825),A wandering wi' my Davie.
5814,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Meet me, &c."
5815,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5816,SACRED POETRY (1825),When purple morning starts the hare
5817,SACRED POETRY (1825),"To steal upon her early fare,"
5818,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Then thro' the dews I will repair,"
5819,SACRED POETRY (1825),To meet my faithful Davie.
5820,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Meet me, &c."
5821,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5822,SACRED POETRY (1825),"When day, expiring in the west,"
5823,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The curtain draws o' nature's rest,"
5824,SACRED POETRY (1825),"I flee to his arms I lo'e best,"
5825,SACRED POETRY (1825),And that's my ain dear Davie.
5826,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Meet me, &c."
5827,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5828,SACRED POETRY (1825),There is surely no need to explain how this instinctive attachment to
5829,SACRED POETRY (1825),his subject is especially requisite in the sacred poet. If even the
5830,SACRED POETRY (1825),"description of material objects is found to languish without it, much"
5831,SACRED POETRY (1825),more will it be looked for when the best and highest of all affections
5832,SACRED POETRY (1825),is to be expressed and communicated to others. The nobler and worthier
5833,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the object, the greater our disappointment to find it approached with"
5834,SACRED POETRY (1825),anything like languor or constraint.
5835,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5836,SACRED POETRY (1825),"We must just mention one more quality, which may seem, upon"
5837,SACRED POETRY (1825),"consideration, essential to perfection in this kind: viz. that the"
5838,SACRED POETRY (1825),feelings the writer expresses should appear to be specimens of his
5839,SACRED POETRY (1825),"general tone of thought, not sudden bursts and mere flashes of"
5840,SACRED POETRY (1825),goodness. Wordsworth's beautiful description of the Stock-dove might
5841,SACRED POETRY (1825),not unaptly be applied to him. He should sing
5842,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5843,SACRED POETRY (1825),"'of love with silence blending,"
5844,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Slow to begin, yet never ending,"
5845,SACRED POETRY (1825),Of serious faith and inward glee'.
5846,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5847,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Some may, perhaps, object to this, as a dull and languid strain of"
5848,SACRED POETRY (1825),sentiment. But before we yield to their censures we would inquire of
5849,SACRED POETRY (1825),"them what style they consider, themselves, as most appropriate to"
5850,SACRED POETRY (1825),"similar subjects in a kindred art. If grave, simple, sustained"
5851,SACRED POETRY (1825),melodies--if tones of deep but subdued emotion are what our minds
5852,SACRED POETRY (1825),naturally suggest to us upon the mention of sacred _music_--why should
5853,SACRED POETRY (1825),"there not be something analogous, a kind of plain chant, in sacred"
5854,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_poetry_ also? fervent, yet sober; awful, but engaging; neither wild"
5855,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and passionate, nor light and airy; but such as we may with submission"
5856,SACRED POETRY (1825),"presume to be the most acceptable offering in its kind, as being"
5857,SACRED POETRY (1825),indeed the truest expression of the best state of the affections. To
5858,SACRED POETRY (1825),"many, perhaps to most, men, a tone of more violent emotion may sound"
5859,SACRED POETRY (1825),"at first more attractive. But before we _indulge_ such a preference,"
5860,SACRED POETRY (1825),"we should do well to consider, whether it is quite agreeable to that"
5861,SACRED POETRY (1825),"spirit, which alone can make us worthy readers of sacred poetry."
5862,SACRED POETRY (1825),"'[Greek: Entheon hê poiêsis]', it is true; there must be rapture and"
5863,SACRED POETRY (1825),"inspiration, but these will naturally differ in their character as the"
5864,SACRED POETRY (1825),powers do from whom they proceed. The worshippers of Baal may be rude
5865,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and frantic in their cries and gestures; but the true Prophet,"
5866,SACRED POETRY (1825),"speaking to or of the true GOD, is all dignity and calmness."
5867,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5868,SACRED POETRY (1825),"If then, in addition to the ordinary difficulties of poetry, all these"
5869,SACRED POETRY (1825),things are essential to the success of the Christian lyrist--if what
5870,SACRED POETRY (1825),"he sets before us must be true in substance, and in manner marked by a"
5871,SACRED POETRY (1825),"noble simplicity and confidence in that truth, by a sincere attachment"
5872,SACRED POETRY (1825),"to it, and entire familiarity with it--then we need not wonder that so"
5873,SACRED POETRY (1825),"few should have become eminent in this branch of their art, nor need"
5874,SACRED POETRY (1825),we have recourse to the disheartening and unsatisfactory solutions
5875,SACRED POETRY (1825),which are sometimes given of that circumstance.
5876,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5877,SACRED POETRY (1825),"'Contemplative piety,' says Dr. Johnson, 'or the intercourse"
5878,SACRED POETRY (1825),"between God and the human soul, cannot be poetical. Man,"
5879,SACRED POETRY (1825),"admitted to implore the mercy of his Creator, and plead the"
5880,SACRED POETRY (1825),"merits of his Redeemer, is already in a higher state than"
5881,SACRED POETRY (1825),poetry can confer.'[17]
5882,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5883,SACRED POETRY (1825),[17] _Life of Waller._
5884,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5885,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The sentiment is not uncommon among serious, but somewhat fearful,"
5886,SACRED POETRY (1825),"believers; and though we believe it erroneous, we desire to treat it"
5887,SACRED POETRY (1825),"not only with tenderness, but with reverence. They start at the very"
5888,SACRED POETRY (1825),"mention of sacred poetry, as though poetry were in its essence a"
5889,SACRED POETRY (1825),"profane amusement. It is, unquestionably, by far the safer extreme to"
5890,SACRED POETRY (1825),be too much afraid of venturing with the imagination upon sacred
5891,SACRED POETRY (1825),"ground. Yet, if it be an error, and a practical error, it may be worth"
5892,SACRED POETRY (1825),"while cautiously to examine the grounds of it. In the generality,"
5893,SACRED POETRY (1825),"perhaps, it is not so much a deliberate opinion, as a prejudice"
5894,SACRED POETRY (1825),"against the use of the art, arising out of its abuse. But the great"
5895,SACRED POETRY (1825),writer just referred to has endeavoured to establish it by direct
5896,SACRED POETRY (1825),"reasoning. He argues the point, first, from the nature of poetry, and"
5897,SACRED POETRY (1825),afterwards from that of devotion.
5898,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5899,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The essence of poetry is invention; such invention as, by"
5900,SACRED POETRY (1825),"producing something unexpected, surprises and delights. The"
5901,SACRED POETRY (1825),topics of devotion are few.
5902,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5903,SACRED POETRY (1825),It is to be hoped that many men's experience will refute the latter
5904,SACRED POETRY (1825),"part of this statement. How can the topics of devotion be few, when we"
5905,SACRED POETRY (1825),"are taught to make every part of life, every scene in nature, an"
5906,SACRED POETRY (1825),"occasion--in other words, a topic--of devotion? It might as well be"
5907,SACRED POETRY (1825),"said that connubial love is an unfit subject for poetry, as being"
5908,SACRED POETRY (1825),"incapable of novelty, because, after all, it is only ringing the"
5909,SACRED POETRY (1825),"changes upon one simple affection, which every one understands. The"
5910,SACRED POETRY (1825),"novelty there consists, not in the original topic, but in continually"
5911,SACRED POETRY (1825),"bringing ordinary things, by happy strokes of natural ingenuity, into"
5912,SACRED POETRY (1825),new associations with the ruling passion.
5913,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5914,SACRED POETRY (1825),There's not a bonny flower that springs
5915,SACRED POETRY (1825),"By fountain, shaw, or green;"
5916,SACRED POETRY (1825),There's not a bonnie bird that sings
5917,SACRED POETRY (1825),But minds me of my Jean.
5918,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5919,SACRED POETRY (1825),Why need we fear to extend this most beautiful and natural sentiment
5920,SACRED POETRY (1825),"to 'the intercourse between the human soul and its Maker', possessing,"
5921,SACRED POETRY (1825),"as we do, the very highest warrant for the analogy which subsists"
5922,SACRED POETRY (1825),between conjugal and divine love?
5923,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5924,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Novelty, therefore, sufficient for all the purposes of poetry, we may"
5925,SACRED POETRY (1825),have on sacred subjects. Let us pass to the next objection.
5926,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5927,SACRED POETRY (1825),Poetry pleases by exhibiting an idea more grateful to the
5928,SACRED POETRY (1825),mind than things themselves afford. This effect proceeds
5929,SACRED POETRY (1825),"from the display of those parts of nature which attract,"
5930,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and the concealment of those which repel, the imagination;"
5931,SACRED POETRY (1825),but religion must be shown as it is; suppression and
5932,SACRED POETRY (1825),"addition equally corrupt it; and, such as it is, it is known"
5933,SACRED POETRY (1825),already.
5934,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5935,SACRED POETRY (1825),A fallacy may be apprehended in both parts of this statement. There
5936,SACRED POETRY (1825),"are, surely, real landscapes which delight the mind as sincerely and"
5937,SACRED POETRY (1825),intensely as the most perfect description could; and there are family
5938,SACRED POETRY (1825),groups which give a more exquisite sensation of domestic happiness
5939,SACRED POETRY (1825),"than anything in Milton, or even Shakespeare. It is partly by"
5940,SACRED POETRY (1825),"association with these, the treasures of the memory, and not"
5941,SACRED POETRY (1825),"altogether by mere excitement of the imagination, that Poetry does her"
5942,SACRED POETRY (1825),work. By the same rule sacred pictures and sacred songs cannot fail to
5943,SACRED POETRY (1825),"gratify the mind which is at all exercised in devotion; recalling, as"
5944,SACRED POETRY (1825),"they will, whatever of highest perfection in that way she can remember"
5945,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in herself, or has learned of others."
5946,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5947,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Then again, it is not the religious doctrine itself, so much as the"
5948,SACRED POETRY (1825),"effect of it upon the human mind and heart, which the sacred poet has"
5949,SACRED POETRY (1825),to describe. What is said of suppression and addition may be true
5950,SACRED POETRY (1825),"enough with regard to the former, but is evidently incorrect when"
5951,SACRED POETRY (1825),applied to the latter: it being an acknowledged difficulty in all
5952,SACRED POETRY (1825),"devotional writings, and not in devotional verse only, to keep clear"
5953,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of the extreme of languor on the one hand, and debasing rapture on the"
5954,SACRED POETRY (1825),other. This requires a delicacy in the perception and enunciation of
5955,SACRED POETRY (1825),"truth, of which the most earnest believer may be altogether destitute."
5956,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And since, probably, no man's condition, in regard to eternal things,"
5957,SACRED POETRY (1825),"is exactly like that of any other man, and yet it is the business of"
5958,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the sacred poet to sympathize with all, his store of subjects is"
5959,SACRED POETRY (1825),"clearly inexhaustible, and his powers of discrimination--in other"
5960,SACRED POETRY (1825),"words, of suppression and addition--are kept in continual exercise."
5961,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5962,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Nor is he, by any means, so straitly limited in the other and more"
5963,SACRED POETRY (1825),"difficult branch of his art, the exhibition of religious doctrine"
5964,SACRED POETRY (1825),"itself, as is supposed in the following statement:"
5965,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5966,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Whatever is great, desirable, or tremendous, is comprised in"
5967,SACRED POETRY (1825),the name of the Supreme Being. Omnipotence cannot be
5968,SACRED POETRY (1825),exalted; infinity cannot be amplified; perfection cannot be
5969,SACRED POETRY (1825),improved.
5970,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5971,SACRED POETRY (1825),True: all perfection is implied in the name of GOD; and so all the
5972,SACRED POETRY (1825),beauties and luxuries of spring are comprised in that one word. But is
5973,SACRED POETRY (1825),it not the very office of poetry to develop and display the
5974,SACRED POETRY (1825),"particulars of such complex ideas? in such a way, for example, as the"
5975,SACRED POETRY (1825),idea of GOD'S omnipresence is developed in the 139th Psalm? and thus
5976,SACRED POETRY (1825),"detaining the mind for a while, to force or help her to think steadily"
5977,SACRED POETRY (1825),"on truths which she would hurry unprofitably over, how strictly soever"
5978,SACRED POETRY (1825),they may be implied in the language which she uses. It is really
5979,SACRED POETRY (1825),surprising that this great and acute critic did not perceive that the
5980,SACRED POETRY (1825),objection applies as strongly against any kind of composition of which
5981,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the Divine Nature is the subject, as against devotional poems."
5982,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5983,SACRED POETRY (1825),"We forbear to press the consideration that, even if the objection were"
5984,SACRED POETRY (1825),"allowed in respect of natural religion, it would not hold against the"
5985,SACRED POETRY (1825),devotional compositions of a Christian; the object of whose worship
5986,SACRED POETRY (1825),"has condescended also to become the object of description, affection,"
5987,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and sympathy, in the literal sense of these words. But this is,"
5988,SACRED POETRY (1825),"perhaps, too solemn and awful an argument for this place; and"
5989,SACRED POETRY (1825),therefore we pass on to the concluding statement of the passage under
5990,SACRED POETRY (1825),"consideration, in which the writer turns his view downwards, and"
5991,SACRED POETRY (1825),"argues against sacred poetry from the nature of man, as he had before"
5992,SACRED POETRY (1825),from the nature of GOD.
5993,SACRED POETRY (1825),
5994,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The employments of pious meditation are faith, thanksgiving,"
5995,SACRED POETRY (1825),"repentance and supplication. Faith, invariably uniform,"
5996,SACRED POETRY (1825),"cannot be invested by fancy with decorations. Thanksgiving,"
5997,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the most joyful of all holy effusions, yet addressed to a"
5998,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Being without passions, is confined to a few modes, and is"
5999,SACRED POETRY (1825),to be felt rather than expressed.
6000,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6001,SACRED POETRY (1825),"What we have said of the variation of the devout affections, as they"
6002,SACRED POETRY (1825),"exist in various persons, is sufficient, we apprehend, to answer this."
6003,SACRED POETRY (1825),But the rest of the paragraph requires some additional reflection:
6004,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6005,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Repentance, trembling in the presence of the Judge, is not"
6006,SACRED POETRY (1825),at leisure for cadences and epithets.
6007,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6008,SACRED POETRY (1825),"This is rather invidiously put, and looks as if the author had not"
6009,SACRED POETRY (1825),"entire confidence in the truth of what he was saying. Indeed, it may"
6010,SACRED POETRY (1825),"very well be questioned; since many of the more refined passions, it"
6011,SACRED POETRY (1825),"is certain, naturally express themselves in poetical language. But"
6012,SACRED POETRY (1825),"repentance is not merely a passion, nor is its only office to tremble"
6013,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in the presence of the Judge. So far from it, that one great business"
6014,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of sacred poetry, as of sacred music, is to quiet and sober the"
6015,SACRED POETRY (1825),feelings of the penitent--to make his compunction as much of 'a
6016,SACRED POETRY (1825),reasonable service' as possible.
6017,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6018,SACRED POETRY (1825),To proceed:
6019,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6020,SACRED POETRY (1825),Supplication of man to man may diffuse itself through many
6021,SACRED POETRY (1825),topics of persuasion: but supplication to God can only cry
6022,SACRED POETRY (1825),for mercy.
6023,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6024,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Certainly, this would be true, if the abstract nature of the Deity"
6025,SACRED POETRY (1825),"were alone considered. But if we turn to the sacred volume, which"
6026,SACRED POETRY (1825),"corrects so many of our erring anticipations, we there find that,"
6027,SACRED POETRY (1825),"whether in condescension to our infirmities, or for other wise"
6028,SACRED POETRY (1825),"purposes, we are furnished with inspired precedents for addressing"
6029,SACRED POETRY (1825),"ourselves to God in all the various tones, and by all the various"
6030,SACRED POETRY (1825),"topics, which we should use to a good and wise man standing in the"
6031,SACRED POETRY (1825),highest and nearest relation to us. This is so palpably the case
6032,SACRED POETRY (1825),"throughout the scriptures, that it is quite surprising how a person of"
6033,SACRED POETRY (1825),so much serious thought as Dr. Johnson could have failed to recollect
6034,SACRED POETRY (1825),"it when arguing on the subject of prayer. In fact, there is a simple"
6035,SACRED POETRY (1825),"test, by which, perhaps, the whole of his reasoning on Sacred Poetry"
6036,SACRED POETRY (1825),"might be fairly and decisively tried. Let the reader, as he goes over"
6037,SACRED POETRY (1825),"it, bear in mind the Psalms of David, and consider whether every one"
6038,SACRED POETRY (1825),of his statements and arguments is not there practically refuted.
6039,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6040,SACRED POETRY (1825),"It is not, then, because sacred subjects are peculiarly unapt for"
6041,SACRED POETRY (1825),"poetry, that so few sacred poets are popular. We have already glanced"
6042,SACRED POETRY (1825),at some of the causes to which we attribute it--we ought to add
6043,SACRED POETRY (1825),"another, which strikes us as important. Let us consider how the case"
6044,SACRED POETRY (1825),stands with regard to books of devotion in _prose_.
6045,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6046,SACRED POETRY (1825),"We may own it reluctantly, but must it not be owned? that if two new"
6047,SACRED POETRY (1825),"publications meet the eye at once, of which no more is known than that"
6048,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the one is what is familiarly called _a good book_, the other a work"
6049,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of mere literature, nine readers out of ten will take up the second"
6050,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rather than the first? If this be allowed, whatever accounts for it"
6051,SACRED POETRY (1825),will contribute to account also for the comparative failure of
6052,SACRED POETRY (1825),devotional poetry. For this sort of coldness and languor in the reader
6053,SACRED POETRY (1825),must act upon the author in more ways than one. The large class who
6054,SACRED POETRY (1825),"write for money or applause will of course be carried, by the tide of"
6055,SACRED POETRY (1825),"popularity, towards some other subject. Men of more sincere minds,"
6056,SACRED POETRY (1825),"either from true or false delicacy, will have little heart to expose"
6057,SACRED POETRY (1825),their retired thoughts to the risk of mockery or neglect; and if they
6058,SACRED POETRY (1825),"do venture, will be checked every moment, like an eager but bashful"
6059,SACRED POETRY (1825),"musician before a strange audience, not knowing how far the reader's"
6060,SACRED POETRY (1825),"feelings will harmonize with their own. This leaves the field open, in"
6061,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a great measure, to harder or more enthusiastic spirits; who offending"
6062,SACRED POETRY (1825),"continually, in their several ways, against delicacy, the one by"
6063,SACRED POETRY (1825),"wildness, the other by coarseness, aggravate the evil which they"
6064,SACRED POETRY (1825),wished to cure; till the sacred subject itself comes at last to bear
6065,SACRED POETRY (1825),the blame due to the indifference of the reader and the indiscretion
6066,SACRED POETRY (1825),of the writer.
6067,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6068,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Such, we apprehend, would be a probable account of the condition of"
6069,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sacred poetry, in a country where religion was coldly acknowledged,"
6070,SACRED POETRY (1825),and literature earnestly pursued. How far the description may apply to
6071,SACRED POETRY (1825),"England and English literature, in their various changes since the"
6072,SACRED POETRY (1825),Reformation--how far it may hold true of our own times--is an inquiry
6073,SACRED POETRY (1825),which would lead us too far at present; but it is surely worth
6074,SACRED POETRY (1825),considering. It goes deeper than any question of mere literary
6075,SACRED POETRY (1825),curiosity. It is a sort of test of the genuineness of those
6076,SACRED POETRY (1825),"pretensions, which many of us are, perhaps, too forward to advance, to"
6077,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a higher state of morality and piety, as well as knowledge and"
6078,SACRED POETRY (1825),"refinement, than has been known elsewhere or in other times."
6079,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6080,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Those who, in spite of such difficulties, desire in earnest to do good"
6081,SACRED POETRY (1825),"by the poetical talent, which they may happen to possess, have only,"
6082,SACRED POETRY (1825),"as it should seem, the following alternative. Either they must veil,"
6083,SACRED POETRY (1825),"as it were, the sacredness of the subject--not necessarily by"
6084,SACRED POETRY (1825),"allegory, for it may be done in a thousand other ways--and so deceive"
6085,SACRED POETRY (1825),the world of taste into devotional reading--
6086,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6087,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Succhi amari intanto ei beve,"
6088,SACRED POETRY (1825),E dall' inganno sua vita riceve--
6089,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6090,SACRED POETRY (1825),"or else, directly avowing that their subject as well as purpose is"
6091,SACRED POETRY (1825),"devotion, they must be content with a smaller number of readers; a"
6092,SACRED POETRY (1825),"disadvantage, however, compensated by the fairer chance of doing good"
6093,SACRED POETRY (1825),to each.
6094,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6095,SACRED POETRY (1825),"It may be worth while to endeavour to trace this distinction, as"
6096,SACRED POETRY (1825),exemplified in the most renowned of the sacred poets of England; and
6097,SACRED POETRY (1825),"to glean from such a survey the best instruction we can, in the happy"
6098,SACRED POETRY (1825),art of turning the most fascinating part of literature to the highest
6099,SACRED POETRY (1825),purposes of religion.
6100,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6101,SACRED POETRY (1825),We must premise that we limit the title of 'sacred poet' by excluding
6102,SACRED POETRY (1825),those who only devoted a small portion of their time and talent now
6103,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and then, to sacred subjects. In all ages of our literary history it"
6104,SACRED POETRY (1825),seems to have been considered almost as an essential part of a poet's
6105,SACRED POETRY (1825),"duty to give up some pages to scriptural story, or to the praise of"
6106,SACRED POETRY (1825),"his Maker, how remote so ever from anything like religion the general"
6107,SACRED POETRY (1825),strain of his writings might be. Witness the Lamentation of Mary
6108,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Magdalene in the works of Chaucer, and the beautiful legend of Hew of"
6109,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Lincoln, which he has inserted in his Canterbury Tales; witness also"
6110,SACRED POETRY (1825),the hymns of Ben Jonson. But these fragments alone will not entitle
6111,SACRED POETRY (1825),their authors to be enrolled among sacred poets. They indicate the
6112,SACRED POETRY (1825),"taste of their age, rather than their own; a fact which may be thought"
6113,SACRED POETRY (1825),to stand rather in painful contrast with the literary history of later
6114,SACRED POETRY (1825),days.
6115,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6116,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There is another class likewise, of whom little need be said in this"
6117,SACRED POETRY (1825),"place; we mean those who composed, strictly and only, for the sake of"
6118,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unburthening their own minds, without any thought of publication. But"
6119,SACRED POETRY (1825),as Chaucer's sacred effusions indicate chiefly the character of the
6120,SACRED POETRY (1825),"times, so poems such as those we now allude to, mark only the turn of"
6121,SACRED POETRY (1825),mind of the individual writers; and our present business is rather
6122,SACRED POETRY (1825),with that sort of poetry which combines both sorts of instruction;
6123,SACRED POETRY (1825),"that, namely, which bears internal evidence of having been written by"
6124,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sincere men, with an intention of doing good, and with consideration"
6125,SACRED POETRY (1825),of the taste of the age in which they lived.
6126,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6127,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Recurring then to the distinction above laid down, between the direct"
6128,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and indirect modes of sacred poetry; at the head of the two classes,"
6129,SACRED POETRY (1825),"as the reader may perhaps have anticipated, we set the glorious names"
6130,SACRED POETRY (1825),of Spenser and of Milton. The claim of Spenser to be considered as a
6131,SACRED POETRY (1825),sacred poet does by no means rest upon his hymns alone: although even
6132,SACRED POETRY (1825),those would be enough alone to embalm and consecrate the whole volume
6133,SACRED POETRY (1825),which contains them; as a splinter of the true cross is supposed by
6134,SACRED POETRY (1825),Catholic sailors to ensure the safety of the vessel. But whoever will
6135,SACRED POETRY (1825),"attentively consider the _Faerie Queene_ itself, will find that it is,"
6136,SACRED POETRY (1825),"almost throughout, such as might have been expected from the author of"
6137,SACRED POETRY (1825),"those truly sacred hymns. It is a continual, deliberate endeavour to"
6138,SACRED POETRY (1825),enlist the restless intellect and chivalrous feeling of an inquiring
6139,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and romantic age, on the side of goodness and faith, of purity and"
6140,SACRED POETRY (1825),justice.
6141,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6142,SACRED POETRY (1825),"This position is to be made good, not solely or perhaps chiefly, yet"
6143,SACRED POETRY (1825),"with no small force, from the allegorical structure of the poem. Most"
6144,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of us, perhaps, are rather disposed to undervalue this contrivance;"
6145,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and even among the genuine admirers of Spenser, there are not a few"
6146,SACRED POETRY (1825),"who on purpose leave it out of their thoughts; finding, as they say,"
6147,SACRED POETRY (1825),that it only embarrasses their enjoyment of the poetry. This is
6148,SACRED POETRY (1825),"certainly far from reasonable: it is a relic of childish feeling, and"
6149,SACRED POETRY (1825),"mere love of amusement, which ill becomes any one who is old enough to"
6150,SACRED POETRY (1825),"appreciate the real beauties of Spenser. Yet it is so natural, so"
6151,SACRED POETRY (1825),"obviously to be expected, that we must suppose a scholar and"
6152,SACRED POETRY (1825),"philosopher (for such Spenser was, as well as a poet) to have been"
6153,SACRED POETRY (1825),"aware of it, and to have made up his mind to it, with all its"
6154,SACRED POETRY (1825),"disadvantages, for some strong reason or other. And what reason so"
6155,SACRED POETRY (1825),"likely as the hope of being seriously useful, both to himself and his"
6156,SACRED POETRY (1825),readers?
6157,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6158,SACRED POETRY (1825),"To _himself_, because the constant recurrence to his allegory would"
6159,SACRED POETRY (1825),"serve as a check upon a fancy otherwise too luxuriant, and would"
6160,SACRED POETRY (1825),"prevent him from indulging in such liberties as the Italian poets, in"
6161,SACRED POETRY (1825),"other respects his worthy masters, were too apt to take. The"
6162,SACRED POETRY (1825),"consequence is, that even in his freest passages, and those which one"
6163,SACRED POETRY (1825),"would most wish unwritten, Spenser is by no means a _seductive_ poet."
6164,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Vice in him, however truly described, is always made contemptible or"
6165,SACRED POETRY (1825),odious. The same may be said of Milton and Shakespeare; but Milton was
6166,SACRED POETRY (1825),of a cast of mind originally austere and rigorous. He looked on vice
6167,SACRED POETRY (1825),"as a judge; Shakespeare, as a satirist. Spenser was far more indulgent"
6168,SACRED POETRY (1825),"than either, and acted therefore the more wisely in setting himself a"
6169,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rule, which should make it essential to the plan of his poem to be"
6170,SACRED POETRY (1825),"always recommending some virtue; and remind him, like a voice from"
6171,SACRED POETRY (1825),"heaven, that the place on which he was standing was holy ground."
6172,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6173,SACRED POETRY (1825),Then as to the benefit which the _readers_ of the _Faerie Queene_ may
6174,SACRED POETRY (1825),derive from its allegorical form; a good deal surely is to be gained
6175,SACRED POETRY (1825),from the mere habit of looking at things with a view to something
6176,SACRED POETRY (1825),beyond their qualities merely sensible; to their sacred and moral
6177,SACRED POETRY (1825),"meaning, and to the high associations they were intended to create in"
6178,SACRED POETRY (1825),"us. Neither the works nor the word of God, neither poetry nor"
6179,SACRED POETRY (1825),"theology, can be duly comprehended without constant mental exercise of"
6180,SACRED POETRY (1825),this kind. The comparison of the Old Testament with the New is nothing
6181,SACRED POETRY (1825),"else from beginning to end. And without something of this sort,"
6182,SACRED POETRY (1825),"poetry, and all the other arts, would indeed be relaxing to the tone"
6183,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of the mind. The allegory obviates this ill effect, by serving as a"
6184,SACRED POETRY (1825),frequent remembrancer of this higher application. Not that it is
6185,SACRED POETRY (1825),necessary to bend and strain everything into conformity with it; a
6186,SACRED POETRY (1825),"little leaven, of the genuine kind, will go a good way towards"
6187,SACRED POETRY (1825),leavening the whole lump. And so it is in the _Faerie Queene_; for one
6188,SACRED POETRY (1825),stanza of direct allegory there are perhaps fifty of poetical
6189,SACRED POETRY (1825),"embellishment; and it is in these last, after all, that the chief"
6190,SACRED POETRY (1825),moral excellency of the poem lies; as we are now about to show.
6191,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6192,SACRED POETRY (1825),"But to be understood rightly, we would premise, that there is a"
6193,SACRED POETRY (1825),"disposition,--the very reverse of that which leads to parody and"
6194,SACRED POETRY (1825),"caricature,--which is common indeed to all generous minds, but is"
6195,SACRED POETRY (1825),perhaps unrivalled in Spenser. As parody and caricature debase what is
6196,SACRED POETRY (1825),"truly noble, by connecting it with low and ludicrous associations; so"
6197,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a mind, such as we are now speaking of, ennobles what of itself might"
6198,SACRED POETRY (1825),"seem trivial; its thoughts and language, on all occasions, taking a"
6199,SACRED POETRY (1825),uniform and almost involuntary direction towards the best and highest
6200,SACRED POETRY (1825),things.
6201,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6202,SACRED POETRY (1825),"This, however, is a subject which can be hardly comprehended without"
6203,SACRED POETRY (1825),examples. The first which occurs to us is the passage which relates
6204,SACRED POETRY (1825),the origin of Belphoebe.
6205,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6206,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Her birth was of the womb of morning dew,"
6207,SACRED POETRY (1825),"And her conception of the joyous prime,"
6208,SACRED POETRY (1825),And all her whole creation did her show
6209,SACRED POETRY (1825),Pure and unspotted from all loathly crime
6210,SACRED POETRY (1825),That is ingenerate in fleshly slime.
6211,SACRED POETRY (1825),"So was this Virgin born, so was she bred,"
6212,SACRED POETRY (1825),"So was she trained up from time to time,"
6213,SACRED POETRY (1825),"In all chaste virtue and true bounti-hed,"
6214,SACRED POETRY (1825),Till to her due perfection she was ripenèd.
6215,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6216,SACRED POETRY (1825),It is evident how high and sacred a subject was present to the poet's
6217,SACRED POETRY (1825),mind in composing this stanza; and any person who is well read in the
6218,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Bible, with a clue like this may satisfy himself that all Spenser's"
6219,SACRED POETRY (1825),writings are replete with similar tacit allusions to the language and
6220,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the doctrines of sacred writ; allusions breathed, if we may so speak,"
6221,SACRED POETRY (1825),"rather than uttered, and much fitter to be silently considered, than"
6222,SACRED POETRY (1825),"to be dragged forward for quotation or minute criticism. Of course,"
6223,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the more numerous and natural such allusions are, the more entirely"
6224,SACRED POETRY (1825),are we justified in the denomination we have ventured to bestow on
6225,SACRED POETRY (1825),"their author, of a truly 'sacred' poet."
6226,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6227,SACRED POETRY (1825),"It may be felt, as some derogation from this high character, what he"
6228,SACRED POETRY (1825),has himself avowed--that much of his allegory has a turn designedly
6229,SACRED POETRY (1825),given it in honour of Queen Elizabeth; a turn which will be called
6230,SACRED POETRY (1825),"courtly or adulatory according to the humour of the critic. But, in"
6231,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the first place, such was the custom of the times; it was adopted even"
6232,SACRED POETRY (1825),in sermons by men whose sincerity it would be almost sacrilege to
6233,SACRED POETRY (1825),"question. Then, the merits of Queen Elizabeth in respect of the"
6234,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Protestant cause were of that dazzling order, which might excuse a"
6235,SACRED POETRY (1825),"little poetical exuberance in her praise. And, what is very deserving"
6236,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of consideration, it is certain that the most gentle and generous"
6237,SACRED POETRY (1825),spirits are commonly found laying themselves open to this charge of
6238,SACRED POETRY (1825),excessive compliment in addressing princes and patrons. Witness the
6239,SACRED POETRY (1825),"high style adopted by the venerable Hooker, in speaking of this very"
6240,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Queen Elizabeth: 'Whose sacred power, matched with incomparable"
6241,SACRED POETRY (1825),"goodness of nature, hath hitherto been God's most happy instrument, by"
6242,SACRED POETRY (1825),him miraculously kept for works of so miraculous preservation and
6243,SACRED POETRY (1825),"safety unto others,' &c. Another instance of the same kind may be seen"
6244,SACRED POETRY (1825),in Jeremy Taylor's dedication of his _Worthy Communicant_ to the
6245,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Princess of Orange. Nor is it any wonder it should be so, since such"
6246,SACRED POETRY (1825),men feel most ardently the blessing and benefit as well as the
6247,SACRED POETRY (1825),difficulty of whatever is right in persons of such exalted station;
6248,SACRED POETRY (1825),and are also most strongly tempted to bear their testimony against the
6249,SACRED POETRY (1825),"illiberal and envious censures of the vulgar. All these things, duly"
6250,SACRED POETRY (1825),"weighed, may seem to leave little, if anything, in the panegyrical"
6251,SACRED POETRY (1825),"strains of this greatest of laureates, to be excused by the common"
6252,SACRED POETRY (1825),infirmity of human nature; little to detract from our deliberate
6253,SACRED POETRY (1825),"conviction that he was seriously guided, in the exercise of his art,"
6254,SACRED POETRY (1825),"by a sense of duty, and zeal for what is durably important."
6255,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6256,SACRED POETRY (1825),Spenser then was essentially a _sacred_ poet; but the delicacy and
6257,SACRED POETRY (1825),insinuating gentleness of his disposition were better fitted to the
6258,SACRED POETRY (1825),veiled than the direct mode of instruction. His was a mind which would
6259,SACRED POETRY (1825),have shrunk more from the chance of debasing a sacred subject by
6260,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unhandsome treatment, than of incurring ridicule by what would be"
6261,SACRED POETRY (1825),called unseasonable attempts to hallow things merely secular. It was
6262,SACRED POETRY (1825),"natural therefore for him to choose not a scriptural story, but a tale"
6263,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of chivalry and romance; and the popular literature, and, in no small"
6264,SACRED POETRY (1825),"measure, the pageantry and manners of his time, would join to attract"
6265,SACRED POETRY (1825),"his efforts that way. In this way too he was enabled, with more"
6266,SACRED POETRY (1825),"propriety and grace, to introduce allusions, political or courtly, to"
6267,SACRED POETRY (1825),subjects with which his readers were familiar; thus agreeably
6268,SACRED POETRY (1825),"diversifying his allegory, and gratifying his affection for his"
6269,SACRED POETRY (1825),"friends and patrons, without the coarseness of direct compliment."
6270,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6271,SACRED POETRY (1825),"In Milton, most evidently, a great difference was to be expected: both"
6272,SACRED POETRY (1825),from his own character and from that of the times in which he lived.
6273,SACRED POETRY (1825),Religion was in those days the favourite topic of discussion; and it
6274,SACRED POETRY (1825),"is indeed painful to reflect, how sadly it was polluted by"
6275,SACRED POETRY (1825),intermixture with earthly passions: the most awful turns and most
6276,SACRED POETRY (1825),surprising miracles of the Jewish history being made to serve the base
6277,SACRED POETRY (1825),"purposes of persons, of whom it is hard to say whether they were more"
6278,SACRED POETRY (1825),"successful in misleading others, or in deceiving themselves. It was an"
6279,SACRED POETRY (1825),effort worthy of a manly and devout spirit to rescue religion from
6280,SACRED POETRY (1825),"such degradation, by choosing a subject, which, being scriptural,"
6281,SACRED POETRY (1825),"would suit the habit of the times, yet, from its universal and eternal"
6282,SACRED POETRY (1825),"importance, would give least opportunity for debasing temporary"
6283,SACRED POETRY (1825),application. Then it was the temper of the man always to speak out.
6284,SACRED POETRY (1825),"He carried it to a faulty excess, as his prose works too amply"
6285,SACRED POETRY (1825),"demonstrate. The more unfashionable his moral was, the more he would"
6286,SACRED POETRY (1825),have disdained to veil it: neither had he the shrinking delicacy of
6287,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Spenser to keep him back, through fear of profaning things hallowed by"
6288,SACRED POETRY (1825),an unworthy touch.
6289,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6290,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Thus the great epic poem of our language came to be, avowedly, a"
6291,SACRED POETRY (1825),sacred poem. One hardly dares to wish any thing other than it is in
6292,SACRED POETRY (1825),such a composition; yet it may be useful to point out in what respects
6293,SACRED POETRY (1825),"the moral infirmity of the times, or of the author, has affected the"
6294,SACRED POETRY (1825),work; so that we are occasionally tempted to regret even Milton's
6295,SACRED POETRY (1825),choice. But as the leading error of his mind appears to have been
6296,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_intellectual_ pride, and as the leading fault of the generation with"
6297,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which he acted was unquestionably _spiritual_ pride, so the main"
6298,SACRED POETRY (1825),defects of his poetry may probably be attributed to the same causes.
6299,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6300,SACRED POETRY (1825),"There is a studious undervaluing of the female character, which may be"
6301,SACRED POETRY (1825),most distinctly perceived by comparing the character of Eve with that
6302,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of the Lady in Comus: the latter conceived, as we imagine, before the"
6303,SACRED POETRY (1825),mind of the poet had become so deeply tainted with the fault here
6304,SACRED POETRY (1825),imputed to him. A remarkable instance of it is his describing Eve as
6305,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unwilling, or unworthy, to discourse herself with the angel."
6306,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6307,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Such pleasure she reserved,"
6308,SACRED POETRY (1825),Adam relating; she sole auditress.--
6309,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6310,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The sentiment may be natural enough, since the primaeval curse upon"
6311,SACRED POETRY (1825),women: but does it not argue rather too strong a sense of her original
6312,SACRED POETRY (1825),"inferiority, to put it into her mind before the fall?"
6313,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6314,SACRED POETRY (1825),"What again can be said for the reproachful and insulting tone, in"
6315,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which, more than once, the good angels are made to address the bad"
6316,SACRED POETRY (1825),"ones? or of the too attractive colours, in which, perhaps"
6317,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unconsciously, the poet has clothed the Author of Evil himself? It is"
6318,SACRED POETRY (1825),"a well-known complaint among many of the readers of _Paradise Lost_,"
6319,SACRED POETRY (1825),"that they can hardly keep themselves from sympathizing, in some sort,"
6320,SACRED POETRY (1825),"with Satan, as the hero of the poem. The most probable account of"
6321,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which surely is, that the author himself partook largely of the"
6322,SACRED POETRY (1825),haughty and vindictive republican spirit which he has assigned to the
6323,SACRED POETRY (1825),"character, and consequently, though perhaps unconsciously, drew the"
6324,SACRED POETRY (1825),portrait with a peculiar zest.
6325,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6326,SACRED POETRY (1825),These blemishes are in part attributable to the times in which he
6327,SACRED POETRY (1825),"lived: but there is another now to be mentioned, which cannot be so"
6328,SACRED POETRY (1825),accounted for: we mean a want of purity and spirituality in his
6329,SACRED POETRY (1825),conceptions of Heaven and heavenly joys. His Paradise is a vision not
6330,SACRED POETRY (1825),to be surpassed; but his attempts to soar higher are embarrassed with
6331,SACRED POETRY (1825),too much of earth still clinging as it were to his wings. Remarks of
6332,SACRED POETRY (1825),"this kind are in general best understood by comparison, and we invite"
6333,SACRED POETRY (1825),"our readers to compare Milton with Dante, in their descriptions of"
6334,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Heaven. The one as simple as possible in his imagery, producing"
6335,SACRED POETRY (1825),intense effect by little more than various combinations of _three_
6336,SACRED POETRY (1825),"leading ideas--light, motion, and music--as if he feared to introduce"
6337,SACRED POETRY (1825),"anything more gross and earthly, and would rather be censured, as"
6338,SACRED POETRY (1825),"doubtless he often is, for coldness and poverty of invention. Whereas"
6339,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Milton, with very little selection or refinement, transfers to the"
6340,SACRED POETRY (1825),immediate neighbourhood of God's throne the imagery of Paradise and
6341,SACRED POETRY (1825),Earth. Indeed he seems himself to have been aware of something
6342,SACRED POETRY (1825),"unsatisfactory in this, and has inserted into the mouth of an angel,"
6343,SACRED POETRY (1825),a kind of apology for it:
6344,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6345,SACRED POETRY (1825),Though what if earth
6346,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Be but the shadow of heav'n, and things therein"
6347,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?"
6348,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6349,SACRED POETRY (1825),"These are blemishes, and sometimes almost tempt us to wish that even"
6350,SACRED POETRY (1825),Milton had taken some subject not so immediately and avowedly
6351,SACRED POETRY (1825),connected with religion. But they do not affect his claim to be
6352,SACRED POETRY (1825),considered as the very lodestar and pattern of that class of sacred
6353,SACRED POETRY (1825),poets in England. As such we have here considered him next to Spenser;
6354,SACRED POETRY (1825),not that there were wanting others of the same order before him. In
6355,SACRED POETRY (1825),"fact, most of the distinguished names in the poetical annals of"
6356,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I, might be included in the list. It"
6357,SACRED POETRY (1825),"may be enough just to recollect Drayton and Cowley, Herbert, Crashaw"
6358,SACRED POETRY (1825),and Quarles.
6359,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6360,SACRED POETRY (1825),"The mention of these latter names suggests the remark, how very"
6361,SACRED POETRY (1825),"desirable it is to encourage as indulgent and, if we may so term it,"
6362,SACRED POETRY (1825),"_catholic_ a spirit as may be, in poetical criticism. From having been"
6363,SACRED POETRY (1825),"over-praised in their own days, they are come now to be as much"
6364,SACRED POETRY (1825),"undervalued; yet their quaintness of manner and constrained imagery,"
6365,SACRED POETRY (1825),"adopted perhaps in compliance with the taste of their age, should"
6366,SACRED POETRY (1825),hardly suffice to overbalance their sterling merits. We speak
6367,SACRED POETRY (1825),especially of Crashaw and Quarles: for Herbert is a name too venerable
6368,SACRED POETRY (1825),to be more than mentioned in our present discussion.
6369,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6370,SACRED POETRY (1825),"After Milton, sacred poetry seems to have greatly declined, both in"
6371,SACRED POETRY (1825),the number and merit of those who cultivated it. No other could be
6372,SACRED POETRY (1825),expected from the conflicting evils of those times: in which one party
6373,SACRED POETRY (1825),"was used to brand everything sacred with the name of Puritanism, and"
6374,SACRED POETRY (1825),the other to suspect every thing poetical of being contrary to
6375,SACRED POETRY (1825),morality and religion.
6376,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6377,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Yet most of the great names of that age, especially among the"
6378,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Romanists, as Dryden, Pope, and before them Habington, continued to"
6379,SACRED POETRY (1825),dedicate some of their poetry to religion. By their faith they were
6380,SACRED POETRY (1825),"remote from the controversies which agitated the established church,"
6381,SACRED POETRY (1825),and their devotion might indulge itself without incurring the
6382,SACRED POETRY (1825),suspicion of a fanatical spirit. Then the solemnity of their worship
6383,SACRED POETRY (1825),"is fitted to inspire splendid and gorgeous strains, such as Dryden's"
6384,SACRED POETRY (1825),paraphrase of the Veni Creator; and their own fallen fortunes in
6385,SACRED POETRY (1825),"England, no less naturally, would fill them with a sense of decay very"
6386,SACRED POETRY (1825),favourable to the plaintive tenderness of Habington and Crashaw.
6387,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6388,SACRED POETRY (1825),"A feeling of this kind, joined to the effect of distressing languor"
6389,SACRED POETRY (1825),"and sickness, may be discerned, occasionally, in the writings of"
6390,SACRED POETRY (1825),Bishop Ken; though he was far indeed from being a Romanist. We shall
6391,SACRED POETRY (1825),"hardly find, in all ecclesiastical history, a greener spot than the"
6392,SACRED POETRY (1825),later years of this courageous and affectionate pastor; persecuted
6393,SACRED POETRY (1825),"alternately by both parties, and driven from his station in his"
6394,SACRED POETRY (1825),"declining age; yet singing on, with unabated cheerfulness, to the"
6395,SACRED POETRY (1825),"last. His poems are not popular, nor probably ever will be, for"
6396,SACRED POETRY (1825),reasons already touched upon; but whoever in earnest loves his three
6397,SACRED POETRY (1825),"well-known hymns, and knows how to value such unaffected strains of"
6398,SACRED POETRY (1825),"poetical devotion, will find his account, in turning over his four"
6399,SACRED POETRY (1825),"volumes, half narrative and half lyric, and all avowedly on sacred"
6400,SACRED POETRY (1825),"subjects; the narrative often cumbrous, and the lyric verse not seldom"
6401,SACRED POETRY (1825),"languid and redundant: yet all breathing such an angelic spirit,"
6402,SACRED POETRY (1825),"interspersed with such pure and bright touches of poetry, that such a"
6403,SACRED POETRY (1825),reader as we have supposed will scarcely find it in his heart to
6404,SACRED POETRY (1825),criticize them.
6405,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6406,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Between that time and ours, the form of sacred poetry which has"
6407,SACRED POETRY (1825),"succeeded best in attracting public attention, is the didactic: of"
6408,SACRED POETRY (1825),"which Davies in Queen Elizabeth's reign, Sir Richard Blackmore in King"
6409,SACRED POETRY (1825),"William's, Young in the middle, and Cowper in the close, of the last"

6411,SACRED POETRY (1825),according to the differences of their respective literary eras.
6412,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Davies, with his Lucretian majesty (although he wants the moral pathos"
6413,SACRED POETRY (1825),"of the Roman poet), representing aptly enough the age of Elizabeth;"

6415,SACRED POETRY (1825),"Charles's days; Young, with his pointed sentences, transferring to"
6416,SACRED POETRY (1825),"graver subjects a good deal of the manner of Pope; and Cowper, with"
6417,SACRED POETRY (1825),"his agreeable but too unsparing descriptions, coming nearer to the"
6418,SACRED POETRY (1825),"present day, which appears, both in manners and in scenery, to delight"
6419,SACRED POETRY (1825),"in Dutch painting, rather than in what is more delicately classical."
6420,SACRED POETRY (1825),
6421,SACRED POETRY (1825),"With regard to the indirect, and, perhaps, more effective, species of"
6422,SACRED POETRY (1825),"sacred poetry, we fear it must be acknowledged, to the shame of the"
6423,SACRED POETRY (1825),"last century, that there is hardly a single specimen of it (excepting,"
6424,SACRED POETRY (1825),"perhaps, Gray's Elegy, and possibly some of the most perfect of"

6431,SACRED POETRY (1825),"likely, in every way, to answer the purposes of his art; especially in"

6530,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6531,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Aristotle considers the excellence of a tragedy to depend upon its
6532,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"_plot_--and, since a tragedy, as such, is obviously the exhibition of"

6534,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Accordingly he directs his principal attention to the economy of the

6536,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,traces its progress from a complication of incidents to their just

6539,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,character may be made subservient to the purposes of the action. His
6540,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"treatise is throughout interesting and valuable. It is one thing,"
6541,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"however, to form the beau idéal of a tragedy on scientific principles;"

6543,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,dramatic composition. The Greek tragedians are not generally
6544,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"felicitous in the construction of their plots. Aristotle, then, rather"
6545,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"tells us what tragedy should be, than what Greek tragedy really was."
6546,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"And this doubtless was the intention of the philosopher. Since,"
6547,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"however, the Greek drama has obtained so extended and lasting a"
6548,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"celebrity, and yet its excellence does not fall under the strict rules"
6549,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of the critical art, we should inquire in what it consists."
6550,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6551,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,That the charm of Greek tragedy does not ordinarily arise from
6552,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"scientific correctness of plot, is certain as a matter of fact. Seldom"
6553,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"does any great interest arise from the action; which, instead of being"
6554,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"progressive and sustained, is commonly either a mere necessary"
6555,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"condition of the drama, or a convenience for the introduction of"
6556,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,matter more important than itself. It is often stationary--often
6557,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,irregular--sometimes either wants or outlives the catastrophe. In the
6558,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,plays of Aeschylus it is always simple and inartificial--in four out
6559,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of the seven there is hardly any plot at all;--and, though it is of"
6560,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"more prominent importance in those of Sophocles, yet even here the"
6561,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"_Oedipus at Colonus_ is a mere series of incidents, and the _Ajax_ a"
6562,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"union of two separate tales; while in the _Philoctetes_, which is"
6563,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"apparently busy, the circumstances of the action are but slightly"
6564,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,connected with the _dénouement_. The carelessness of Euripides in the
6565,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,construction of his plots is well known. The action then will be more

6568,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the plot, but in the characters, sentiments, and diction, that the"
6569,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,actual merit and poetry of the composition is placed. To show this to
6570,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the satisfaction of the reader, would require a minuter investigation"
6571,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of details than our present purpose admits; yet a few instances in
6572,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,point may suggest others to the memory. E. g. in neither the _Oedipus
6573,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Coloneus_ nor the _Philoctetes_, the two most beautiful plays of"
6574,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Sophocles, is the plot striking; but how exquisite is the delineation"
6575,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of the characters of Antigone and Oedipus, in the former tragedy,"
6576,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"particularly in their interview with Polynices, and the various"
6577,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,descriptions of the scene itself which the Chorus furnishes! In the
6578,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"_Philoctetes_, again, it is the contrast between the worldly wisdom of"
6579,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Ulysses, the inexperienced frankness of Neoptolemus, and the"
6580,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"simplicity of the afflicted Philoctetes, which constitutes the"
6581,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,principal charm of the drama. Or we may instance the spirit and nature
6582,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,displayed in the grouping of the characters in the _Prometheus_ which
6583,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,is almost without action;--the stubborn enemy of the new dynasty of
6584,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"gods; Oceanus trimming, as an accomplished politician, with the change"
6585,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of affairs; the single-hearted and generous Nereids; and Hermes the
6586,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"favourite and instrument of the usurping potentate. So again, the"
6587,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,beauties of the _Thebae_ are almost independent of the plot;--it is
6588,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the Chorus which imparts grace and interest to the actionless scene;
6589,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"and the speech of Antigone at the end, one of the most simply striking"
6590,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"in any play, has, scientifically speaking, no place in the tragedy,"
6591,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,which should already have been brought to its conclusion. Amid the
6592,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"multitude of the beauties of the irregular Euripides, it is obvious to"
6593,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,notice the characters of Alcestis and the Clytemnestra of the
6594,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,_Electra_; the soliloquies of _Medea_; the picturesque situation of
6595,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Ion, the minister of the Pythian temple; the opening scene of the"
6596,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,_Orestes_; and the dialogues between Phaedra and her attendant in the
6597,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"_Hippolytus_, and the old man and Antigone in the _Phoenissae_;--passages"
6598,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"which are either unconnected with the development of the plot, or of"
6599,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"an importance superior to it. Thus the Greek drama, as a fact, was"
6600,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,modelled on no scientific principle. It was a pure recreation of the
6601,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"imagination, revelling without object or meaning beyond its own"
6602,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"exhibition. Gods, heroes, kings, and dames, enter and retire: they may"
6603,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,have a good reason for appearing--they may have a very poor one;
6604,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"whatever it is, still we have no right to ask for it;--the question is"
6605,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,impertinent. Let us listen to their harmonious and majestic

6607,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,emotion--to the animated odes of the chorus. Why interrupt so divine a

6609,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"every-day events, and implying incompleteness in the action till a"
6610,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,catastrophe arrives? The very spirit of beauty breathes through every
6611,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,part of the composition. We may liken the Greek drama to the music of
6612,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the Italian school; in which the wonder is, how so much richness of"
6613,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,invention in detail can be accommodated to a style so simple and
6614,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"uniform. Each is the development of grace, fancy, pathos, and taste,"
6615,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,in the respective media of representation and sound.

6619,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the most part, Greek Tragedy has its own distinct and peculiar praise,"
6620,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"which must not be lessened by a criticism conducted on principles,"
6621,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"whether correct or not, still leading to excellence of another"
6622,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"character. This being, as we hope, shown, we shall be still bolder,"
6623,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and proceed to question even the sufficiency of the rules of Aristotle
6624,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"for the production of dramas of the highest order. These rules, it"
6625,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"would appear, require a plot not merely natural and unaffected, as a"
6626,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"vehicle of more poetical matter, but one laboured and complicated as"
6627,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the sole legitimate channel of tragic effect; and thus tend to
6628,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,withdraw the mind of the poet from the spontaneous exhibition of
6629,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"pathos or imagination, to a minute diligence in the formation of a"
6630,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"plan. To explain our views on the subject, we will institute a short"
6631,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"comparison between three tragedies, the _Agamemnon_, the _Oedipus_,"
6632,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"and the _Bacchae_, one of each of the tragic poets, where, by"
6633,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"reference to Aristotle's principles, we think it will be found that"
6634,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the most perfect in plot is not the most poetical.
6635,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6636,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Of these the action of the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is frequently instanced
6637,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,by the critic as a specimen of judgement and skill in the selection
6638,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and combination of the incidents; and in this point of view it is
6639,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"truly a masterly composition. The clearness, precision, certainty,"
6640,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"and vigour, with which the line of the action moves on to its"
6641,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"termination, is admirable. The character of Oedipus too is finely"
6642,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"drawn, and identified with the development of the action."
6643,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6644,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,The _Agamemnon_ of Aeschylus presents us with the slow and difficult
6645,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,birth of a portentous secret--an event of old written in the resolves
6646,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of destiny, a crime long meditated in the bosom of the human agents."
6647,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,The Chorus here has an importance altogether wanting in the Chorus of
6648,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the _Oedipus_. They throw a pall of ancestral honour over the bier of
6649,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the hereditary monarch, which would have been unbecoming in the case"
6650,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of the upstart king of Thebes. Till the arrival of Agamemnon, they"
6651,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"occupy our attention, as the prophetic organ, not commissioned indeed"
6652,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"but employed by heaven, to proclaim the impending horrors. Succeeding"
6653,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"to the brief intimation of the watcher who opens the play, they seem"
6654,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,oppressed with forebodings of woe and crime which they can neither
6655,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,justify nor analyse. The expression of their anxiety forms the stream
6656,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"in which the plot flows--every thing, even news of joy, takes a"
6657,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"colouring from the depth of their gloom. On the arrival of the king,"
6658,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"they retire before Cassandra, a more regularly commissioned"
6659,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"prophetess; who, speaking first in figure, then in plain terms, only"
6660,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"ceases that we may hear the voice of the betrayed monarch himself,"
6661,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,informing us of the striking of the fatal blow. Here then the very
6662,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,simplicity of the fable constitutes its especial beauty. The death of
6663,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Agamemnon is intimated at first--it is accomplished at last:
6664,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,throughout we find but the growing in volume and intensity of one and
6665,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the same note--it is a working up of one musical ground, by fugue and"
6666,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"imitation, into the richness of combined harmony. But we look in vain"
6667,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,for the progressive and thickening incidents of the _Oedipus_.
6668,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6669,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,The action of the _Bacchae_ is also simple. It is the history of the
6670,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"reception of the worship of Bacchus in Thebes; who, first depriving"
6671,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Pentheus of his reason, and thereby drawing him on to his ruin,"
6672,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,establishes his divinity. The interest of the scene arises from the
6673,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,gradual process by which the derangement of the Theban king is
6674,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"effected, which is powerfully and originally described. It would be"
6675,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"comic, were it unconnected with religion. As it is, it exhibits the"
6676,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"grave irony of a god triumphing over the impotent presumption of man,"
6677,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the sport and terrible mischievousness of an insulted deity. It is an

6679,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,dementat_. So delicately balanced is the action along the verge of the
6680,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"sublime and grotesque, that it is both solemn and humorous, without"
6681,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,violence to the propriety of the composition: the mad and merry fire
6682,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of the Chorus, the imbecile mirth of old Cadmus and Tiresias, and the"
6683,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"infatuation of Pentheus, who is ultimately induced to dress himself in"

6686,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the intruder. Perhaps the victim's first discovery of the disguised
6687,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,deity is the finest conception in this splendid drama. His madness
6688,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"enables him to discern the emblematic horns on the head of Bacchus,"
6689,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"which were hid from him when in his sound mind; yet this discovery,"

6824,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,passages more so than in others; and sometimes not poetical at all. We
6825,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,only maintain--not that writers forfeit the name of poet who fail at

6846,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
6847,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,We will notice _descriptive poetry_ first. Empedocles wrote his
6848,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"physics in verse, and Oppian his history of animals. Neither were"
6849,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"poets--the one was an historian of nature, the other a sort of"

6853,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"painted with a meaning, beauty, and harmonious order not their own."
6854,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Thomson has sometimes been commended for the novelty and minuteness of
6855,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,his remarks upon nature. This is not the praise of a poet; whose
6856,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,office rather is to represent _known_ phenomena in a new connexion or
6857,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,medium. In _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ the poetical magician
6858,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"invests the commonest scenes of a country life with the hues, first of"
6859,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"a mirthful, then of a pensive mind.[21] Pastoral poetry is a"

6862,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"and others, have run into the fault of colouring too highly;--instead"
6863,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of drawing generalized and ideal forms of _shepherds_, they have given"
6864,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,us pictures of _gentlemen_ and _beaux_. Their composition may be
6865,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"poetry, but it is not pastoral poetry."

6869,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,writers (e. g.) compare aged men to trees in autumn--a gifted
6870,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poet will reverse the metaphor. Thus:--

6899,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and decorated by the poetry of his own mind. Miss Edgeworth sometimes
6900,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"apologizes for certain incidents in her tales, by stating they took"

6907,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,lights and forms. Yet some of Miss Edgeworth's works contain much

6917,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"in the same degree unpoetical. Portrait-painting, to be poetical,"
6918,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,should furnish an abstract representation of an individual; the

6930,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"actual, and not poetical--nor were they intended to be so. They are"
6931,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"interesting, because they are faithful. If there is poetry about them,"
6932,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"it exists in the personages themselves, not in her representation of"
6933,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,them. She is only the accurate reporter in word of what was poetical

6950,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,consistency and ease. Nor does it exclude the introduction of
6951,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,imperfect or odious characters. The original conception of a weak or
6952,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"guilty mind may have its intrinsic beauty. And much more so, when it"
6953,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,is connected with a tale which finally adjusts whatever is
6954,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,reprehensible in the personages themselves. Richard and Iago are
6955,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,subservient to the plot. Moral excellence of character may sometimes
6956,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"be even a fault. The Clytemnestra of Euripides is so interesting, that"
6957,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the divine vengeance, which is the main subject of the drama, seems"
6958,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"almost unjust. Lady Macbeth, on the contrary, is the conception of one"

6960,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"heinous crimes, and meets the fate she deserves. Yet there is nothing"
6961,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"in the picture to offend the taste, and much to feed the imagination."
6962,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Romeo and Juliet are too good for the termination to which the plot

7061,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,known better;--they have subjected metaphysics to their art. In

7063,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,is but the material of the poet. These personages are ideal; they are

7068,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,parts of Crabbe's _Tales of the Hall_. In the writings of this author
7069,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,there is much to offend a refined taste; but at least in the work in
7070,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,question there is much of a highly poetical cast. It is a
7071,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,representation of the action and re-action of two minds upon each
7072,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,other and upon the world around them. Two brothers of different

7079,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"connected narrative. We are tempted to single out the fourth book,"
7080,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,which gives an account of the childhood and education of the younger
7081,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"brother, and which for variety of thought as well as fidelity of"
7082,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,description is in our judgement beyond praise. The Waverley novels
7083,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,would afford us specimens of a similar excellence. One striking
7084,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,peculiarity of these tales is the author's practice of describing a
7085,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"group of characters bearing the same general features of mind, and"
7086,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,placed in the same general circumstances; yet so contrasted with each
7087,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"other in minute differences of mental constitution, that each diverges"
7088,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,from the common starting-place into a path peculiar to himself. The
7089,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"brotherhood of villains in _Kenilworth_, of knights in _Ivanhoe_, and"
7090,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of enthusiasts in _Old Mortality_ are instances of this. This bearing
7091,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of character and plot on each other is not often found in Byron's
7092,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poems. The Corsair is intended for a remarkable personage. We pass by
7093,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the inconsistencies of his character, considered by itself. The grand"
7094,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"fault is that, whether it be natural or not, we are obliged to accept"
7095,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the author's word for the fidelity of his portrait. We are told, not"
7096,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"shown, what the hero was. There is nothing in the plot which results"
7097,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,from his peculiar formation of mind. An every-day bravo might equally
7098,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"well have satisfied the requirements of the action. Childe Harold,"
7099,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"again, if he is any thing, is a being professedly isolated from the"
7100,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"world, and uninfluenced by it. One might as well draw Tityrus's stags"
7101,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"grazing in the air, as a character of this kind; which yet, with more"
7102,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"or less alteration, passes through successive editions in his other"
7103,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poems. Byron had very little versatility or elasticity of genius; he
7104,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,did not know how to make poetry out of existing materials. He declaims
7105,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"in his own way, and has the upper hand as long as he is allowed to go"
7106,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"on; but, if interrogated on principles of nature and good sense, he is"
7107,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,at once put out and brought to a stand. Yet his conception of
7108,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Sardanapalus and Myrrha is fine and ideal, and in the style of"
7109,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,excellence which we have just been admiring in Shakespeare and Scott.

7118,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
7119,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,Originality may perhaps be defined as the power of abstracting for
7120,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"oneself, and is in thought what strength of mind is in action. Our"
7121,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,opinions are commonly derived from education and society. Common minds

7123,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,original talent feel a continual propensity to investigate subjects
7124,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and strike out views for themselves;--so that even old and established

7126,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,to this process of mental digestion. Even the style of original
7127,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,writers is stamped with the peculiarities of their minds. When
7128,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"originality is found apart from good sense, which more or less is"
7129,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"frequently the case, it shows itself in paradox and rashness of"

7131,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"hand, cannot be separated from its good sense, or taste, as it is"
7132,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,called; which is one of its elements. It is originality energizing in
7133,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the world of beauty; the originality of grace, purity, refinement, and"
7134,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"feeling. We do not hesitate to say, that poetry is ultimately founded"

7177,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the religion of nature and the heart, at times debased by polytheism."
7178,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,All these poets are religious:--the occasional irreligion of Virgil's
7179,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poetry is painful to the admirers of his general taste and delicacy.
7180,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Dryden's _Alexander's Feast_ is a magnificent composition, and has"
7181,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,high poetical beauties; but to a delicate judgement there is something
7182,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"intrinsically unpoetical in the end to which it is devoted, the"
7183,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,praises of revel and sensuality. It corresponds to a process of
7184,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,clever reasoning erected on an untrue foundation--the one is a
7185,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"fallacy, the other is out of taste. Lord Byron's _Manfred_ is in parts"
7186,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,intensely poetical; yet the refined mind naturally shrinks from the
7187,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"spirit which here and there reveals itself, and the basis on which the"
7188,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"fable is built. From a perusal of it we should infer, according to the"
7189,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"above theory, that there was right and fine feeling in the poet's"

7191,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the history of his life we know this to be the fact. The connexion
7192,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"between want of the religious principle and want of poetical feeling,"
7193,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,is seen in the instances of Hume and Gibbon; who had radically
7194,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"unpoetical minds. Rousseau is not an exception to our doctrine, for"
7195,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,his heart was naturally religious. Lucretius too had much poetical
7196,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,talent; but his work evinces that his miserable philosophy was rather
7197,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the result of a bewildered judgement than a corrupt heart.
7198,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
7199,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"According to the above theory, revealed religion should be especially"
7200,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poetical--and it is so in fact. While its disclosures have an
7201,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"originality in them to engage the intellect, they have a beauty to"
7202,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,satisfy the moral nature. It presents us with those ideal forms of

7204,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and harmony are associated. It brings us into a new world--a world of

7206,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,purest feelings. The peculiar grace of mind of the New Testament
7207,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,writers is as striking as the actual effect produced upon the hearts
7208,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of those who have imbibed their spirit. At present we are not
7209,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"concerned with the practical, but the poetical nature of revealed"
7210,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,truth. With Christians a poetical view of things is a duty--we are bid
7211,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"to colour all things with hues of faith, to see a divine meaning in"
7212,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"every event, and a superhuman tendency. Even our friends around are"
7213,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"invested with unearthly brightness--no longer imperfect men, but"
7214,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"beings taken into divine favour, stamped with his seal, and in"
7215,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,training for future happiness. It may be added that the virtues
7216,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"peculiarly Christian are especially poetical;--meekness, gentleness,"
7217,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"compassion, contentment, modesty, not to mention the devotional"
7218,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,virtues: whereas the ruder and more ordinary feelings are the
7219,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"instruments of rhetoric more justly than of poetry--anger,"
7220,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"indignation, emulation, martial spirit, and love of independence."

7223,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,composition is merely accessory to the poetical talent. But where that
7224,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"talent exists it necessarily gives its own character to the style, and"
7225,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,renders it perfectly different from all others. As the poet's habits
7226,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of mind lead to contemplation rather than communication with others,"
7227,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"he is more or less obscure, according to the particular style of"
7228,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"poetry he has adopted; less so, in epic or narrative and dramatic"
7229,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"representation--more so, in odes and choruses. He will be obscure,"
7230,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"moreover, from the depth of his feelings, which require a congenial"
7231,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"reader to enter into them--and from their acuteness, which shrinks"
7232,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,from any formal accuracy in the expression of them. And he will be
7233,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"obscure, not only from the carelessness of genius and from the"
7234,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"originality of his conceptions, but (it may be) from natural"
7235,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"deficiency in the power of clear and eloquent expression, which, we"
7236,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"must repeat, is a talent distinct from poetry, though often mistaken"
7237,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,for it.
7238,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
7239,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Dexterity in composition, or _eloquence_ as it may be called in a"
7240,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"contracted sense of the word, is however manifestly more or less"
7241,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"necessary in every branch of literature, though its elements may be"
7242,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"different in each. _Poetical_ eloquence consists, first in the power"
7243,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"of illustration--which the poet uses, not as the orator, voluntarily,"
7244,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"for the sake of clearness or ornament; but almost by constraint, as"
7245,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the sole outlet and expression of intense inward feeling. The
7246,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,spontaneous power of comparison is in some poetical minds entirely
7247,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,wanting; these of course cannot show to advantage as poets.--Another
7248,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,talent necessary to composition is the power of unfolding the meaning
7249,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,in an orderly manner. A poetical mind is often too impatient to
7250,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"explain itself justly; it is overpowered by a rush of emotions, which"
7251,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"sometimes want of power, sometimes the indolence of inward enjoyment"
7252,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,prevents it from describing. Nothing is more difficult than to analyse
7253,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the feelings of our own minds; and the power of doing so, whether"
7254,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"natural or acquired, is clearly distinct from experiencing them. Yet,"
7255,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"though distinct from the poetical talent, it is obviously necessary to"
7256,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"its exhibition. Hence it is a common praise bestowed upon writers,"
7257,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,that they express what we have often felt but could never describe.
7258,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"The power of arrangement, which is necessary for an extended poem, is"
7259,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,a modification of the same talent;--being to poetry what method is to
7260,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"logic. Besides these qualifications, poetical compositions requires"
7261,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,that command of language which is the mere effect of practice. The
7262,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,poet is a compositor; words are his types; he must have them within
7263,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"reach, and in unlimited abundance. Hence the need of careful labour to"
7264,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the accomplished poet--not in order that his diction may attract, but"
7265,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,that language may be subjected to him. He studies the art of
7266,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,composition as we might learn dancing or elocution; not that we may
7267,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"move or speak according to rule, but that by the very exercise our"
7268,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,voice and carriage may become so unembarrassed as to allow of our
7269,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,doing what we will with them.
7270,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,
7271,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"A talent for composition then is no essential part of poetry, though"
7272,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,indispensable to its exhibition. Hence it would seem that attention to
7273,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the language _for its own sake_ evidences not the true poet but the
7274,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,mere artist. Pope is said to have tuned our tongue. We certainly owe
7275,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"much to him--his diction is rich, musical, and expressive. Still he is"
7276,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,not on this account a poet; he elaborated his composition for its own
7277,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"sake. If we give him poetical praise on this account, we may as"
7278,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,appropriately bestow it on a tasteful cabinet-maker. This does not
7279,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,forbid us to ascribe the grace of his verse to an inward principle of
7280,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"poetry, which supplied him with archetypes of the beautiful and"
7281,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,splendid to work by. But a similar internal gift must direct the skill
7282,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,of every fancy-artist who subserves the luxuries and elegancies of
7283,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"life. On the other hand, though Virgil is celebrated as a master of"
7284,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"composition, yet his style is so identified with his conceptions, as"
7285,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"their outward development, as to preclude the possibility of our"
7286,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"viewing the one apart from the other. In Milton, again, the harmony of"
7287,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the verse is but the echo of the inward music which the thoughts of
7288,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,the poet breathe. In Moore's style the ornament continually outstrips
7289,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"the sense. Cowper and Walter Scott, on the other hand, are slovenly in"
7290,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"their versification. Sophocles writes, on the whole, without studied"
7291,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,attention to the style; but Euripides frequently affects a simplicity
7292,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,and prettiness which exposed him to the ridicule of the comic poets.
7293,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"Lastly, the style of Homer's poems is perfect in their particular"

7295,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,varied. It is the style of one who rhapsodized without deference to
7296,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,"hearer or judge, in an age prior to the temptations which more or less"
7297,WITH REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S POETICS (1829).,prevailed over succeeding writers--before the theatre had degraded

7372,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7373,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),*       *       *       *       *
7374,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7375,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Poet and Prophet differ greatly in our loose modern notions of them.
7376,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"In some old languages, again, the titles are synonymous; _Vates_ means"
7377,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"both Prophet and Poet: and indeed at all times, Prophet and Poet, well"
7378,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"understood, have much kindred of meaning. Fundamentally indeed they"
7379,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"are still the same; in this most important respect especially, That"
7380,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),they have penetrated both of them into the sacred mystery of the
7381,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Universe; what Goethe calls 'the open secret'. 'Which is the great
7382,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"secret?' asks one.--'The _open_ secret,'--open to all, seen by almost"
7383,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"none! That divine mystery, which lies everywhere in all Beings, 'the"
7384,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Divine Idea of the World, that which lies at the bottom of"
7385,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Appearance,' as Fichte styles it; of which all Appearance, from the"
7386,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"starry sky to the grass of the field, but especially the Appearance of"
7387,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Man and his work, is but the _vesture_, the embodiment that renders it"
7388,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),visible. This divine mystery _is_ in all times and in all places;
7389,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),veritably is. In most times and places it is greatly overlooked; and
7390,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Universe, definable always in one or the other dialect, as the"
7391,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"realized Thought of God, is considered a trivial, inert, commonplace"
7392,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"matter,--as if, says the Satirist, it were a dead thing, which some"
7393,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"upholsterer had put together! It could do no good, at present, to"
7394,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),_speak_ much about this; but it is a pity for every one of us if we do
7395,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not know it, live ever in the knowledge of it. Really a most mournful"
7396,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"pity;--a failure to live at all, if we live otherwise!"
7397,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7398,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"But now, I say, whoever may forget this divine mystery, the _Vates_,"
7399,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"whether Prophet or Poet, has penetrated into it; is a man sent hither"
7400,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),to make it more impressively known to us. That always is his message;
7401,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"he is to reveal that to us,--that sacred mystery which he more than"
7402,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"others lives ever present with. While others forget it, he knows"
7403,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it;--I might say, he has been driven to know it; without consent asked"
7404,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of _him_, he finds himself living in it, bound to live in it. Once"
7405,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"more, here is no Hearsay, but a direct Insight and Belief; this man"
7406,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),too could not help being a sincere man! Whosoever may live in the
7407,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"shows of things, it is for him a necessity of nature to live in the"
7408,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"very fact of things. A man, once more, in earnest with the Universe,"
7409,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"though all others were but toying with it. He is a _Vates_, first of"
7410,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all, in virtue of being sincere. So far Poet and Prophet,"
7411,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"participators in the 'open secret,' are one."
7412,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7413,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"With respect to their distinction again: The _Vates_ Prophet, we might"
7414,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"say, has seized that sacred mystery rather on the moral side, as Good"
7415,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and Evil, Duty and Prohibition; the _Vates_ Poet on what the Germans"
7416,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"call the æsthetic side, as Beautiful, and the like. The one we may"
7417,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"call a revealer of what we are to do, the other of what we are to"
7418,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"love. But indeed these two provinces run into one another, and cannot"
7419,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),be disjoined. The Prophet too has his eye on what we are to love: how
7420,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),else shall he know what it is we are to do? The highest Voice ever
7421,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"heard on this Earth said withal, 'Consider the lilies of the field;"
7422,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"they toil not, neither do they spin: yet Solomon in all his glory was"
7423,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not arrayed like one of these.' A glance, that, into the deepest deep"
7424,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of Beauty. 'The lilies of the field,'--dressed finer than earthly"
7425,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"princes, springing up there in the humble furrow-field; a beautiful"
7426,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_eye_ looking out on you, from the great inner Sea of Beauty! How"
7427,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"could the rude Earth make these, if her Essence, rugged as she looks"
7428,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and is, were not inwardly Beauty?--In this point of view, too, a"
7429,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"saying of Goethe's, which has staggered several, may have meaning:"
7430,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"'The Beautiful', he intimates, 'is higher than the Good; the Beautiful"
7431,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"includes in it the Good.' The _true_ Beautiful; which however, I have"
7432,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"said somewhere, 'differs from the _false_, as Heaven does from"
7433,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Vauxhall!' So much for the distinction and identity of Poet and
7434,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Prophet.--
7435,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7436,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"In ancient and also in modern periods, we find a few Poets who are"
7437,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),accounted perfect; whom it were a kind of treason to find fault with.
7438,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),This is noteworthy; this is right: yet in strictness it is only an
7439,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"illusion. At bottom, clearly enough, there is no perfect Poet! A vein"
7440,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of Poetry exists in the hearts of all men; no man is made altogether
7441,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of Poetry. We are all poets when we _read_ a poem well. The
7442,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"'imagination that shudders at the Hell of Dante,' is not that the same"
7443,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"faculty, weaker in degree, as Dante's own? No one but Shakespeare can"
7444,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"embody, out of Saxo Grammaticus, the story of _Hamlet_ as Shakespeare"
7445,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),did: but every one models some kind of story out of it; every one
7446,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),embodies it better or worse. We need not spend time in defining. Where
7447,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"there is no specific difference, as between round and square, all"
7448,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),definition must be more or less arbitrary. A man that has _so_ much
7449,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),more of the poetic element developed in him as to have become
7450,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"noticeable, will be called Poet by his neighbours. World-Poets too,"
7451,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"those whom we are to take for perfect Poets, are settled by critics in"
7452,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),the same way. One who rises _so_ far above the general level of Poets
7453,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"will, to such and such critics, seem a Universal Poet; as he ought to"
7454,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"do. And yet it is, and must be, an arbitrary distinction. All Poets,"
7455,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all men, have some touches of the Universal; no man is wholly made of"
7456,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),that. Most Poets are very soon forgotten: but not the noblest
7457,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Shakespeare or Homer of them can be remembered _for ever_;--a day
7458,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),comes when he too is not!
7459,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7460,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Nevertheless, you will say, there must be a difference between true"
7461,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Poetry and true Speech not Poetical: what is the difference? On this
7462,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"point many things have been written, especially by late German"
7463,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Critics, some of which are not very intelligible at first. They say,"
7464,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"for example, that the Poet has an _infinitude_ in him; communicates an"
7465,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_Unendlichkeit_, a certain character of 'infinitude', to whatsoever he"
7466,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"delineates. This, though not very precise, yet on so vague a matter is"
7467,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"worth remembering: if well meditated, some meaning will gradually be"
7468,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"found in it. For my own part, I find considerable meaning in the old"
7469,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"vulgar distinction of Poetry being _metrical_, having music in it,"
7470,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"being a Song. Truly, if pressed to give a definition, one might say"
7471,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),this as soon as anything else: If your delineation be authentically
7472,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_musical_, musical not in word only, but in heart and substance, in"
7473,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all the thoughts and utterances of it, in the whole conception of it,"
7474,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"then it will be poetical; if not, not.--Musical: how much lies in"
7475,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),that! A _musical_ thought is one spoken by a mind that has penetrated
7476,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"into the inmost heart of the thing; detected the inmost mystery of it,"
7477,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),namely the _melody_ that lies hidden in it; the inward harmony of
7478,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"coherence which is its soul, whereby it exists, and has a right to be,"
7479,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"here in this world. All inmost things, we may say, are melodious;"
7480,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),naturally utter themselves in Song. The meaning of Song goes deep. Who
7481,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is there that, in logical words, can express the effect music has on"
7482,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"us? A kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech, which leads us to the"
7483,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"edge of the Infinite, and lets us for moments gaze into that!"
7484,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7485,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Nay all speech, even the commonest speech, has something of song in"
7486,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),it: not a parish in the world but has its parish-accent;--the rhythm
7487,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),or _tune_ to which the people there _sing_ what they have to say!
7488,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Accent is a kind of chanting; all men have accent of their
7489,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"own,--though they only _notice_ that of others. Observe too how all"
7490,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"passionate language does of itself become musical,--with a finer music"
7491,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),than the mere accent; the speech of a man even in zealous anger
7492,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"becomes a chant, a song. All deep things are Song. It seems somehow"
7493,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the very central essence of us, Song; as if all the rest were but"
7494,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"wrappages and hulls! The primal element of us; of us, and of all"
7495,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),things. The Greeks fabled of Sphere-Harmonies: it was the feeling they
7496,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),had of the inner structure of Nature; that the soul of all her voices
7497,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and utterances was perfect music. Poetry, therefore, we will call"
7498,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),_musical Thought_. The Poet is he who _thinks_ in that manner. At
7499,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"bottom, it turns still on power of intellect; it is a man's sincerity"
7500,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and depth of vision that makes him a Poet. See deep enough, and you"
7501,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"see musically; the heart of Nature _being_ everywhere music, if you"
7502,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),can only reach it.
7503,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7504,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"The _Vates_ Poet, with his melodious Apocalypse of Nature, seems to"
7505,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"hold a poor rank among us, in comparison with the _Vates_ Prophet; his"
7506,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"function, and our esteem of him for his function, alike slight. The"
7507,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Hero taken as Divinity; the Hero taken as Prophet; then next the Hero
7508,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),taken only as Poet: does it not look as if our estimate of the Great
7509,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Man, epoch after epoch, were continually diminishing? We take him"
7510,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"first for a god, then for one god-inspired; and now in the next stage"
7511,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of it, his most miraculous word gains from us only the recognition"
7512,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that he is a Poet, beautiful verse-maker, man of genius, or"
7513,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),such-like!--It looks so; but I persuade myself that intrinsically it
7514,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is not so. If we consider well, it will perhaps appear that in man"
7515,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),still there is the _same_ altogether peculiar admiration for the
7516,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Heroic Gift, by what name soever called, that there at any time was."
7517,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7518,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"I should say, if we do not now reckon a Great Man literally divine, it"
7519,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is that our notions of God, of the supreme unattainable Fountain of"
7520,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Splendour, Wisdom and Heroism, are ever rising _higher_; not"
7521,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"altogether that our reverence for these qualities, as manifested in"
7522,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"our like, is getting lower. This is worth taking thought of. Sceptical"
7523,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Dilettantism, the curse of these ages, a curse which will not last for"
7524,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ever, does indeed in this the highest province of human things, as in"
7525,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all provinces, make sad work; and our reverence for great men, all"
7526,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"crippled, blinded, paralytic as it is, comes out in poor plight,"
7527,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),hardly recognizable. Men worship the shows of great men; the most
7528,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),disbelieve that there is any reality of great men to worship. The
7529,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"dreariest, fatallest faith; believing which, one would literally"
7530,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"despair of human things. Nevertheless look, for example, at Napoleon!"
7531,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),A Corsican lieutenant of artillery; that is the show of _him_: yet is
7532,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"he not obeyed, _worshipped_ after his sort, as all the Tiaraed and"
7533,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Diademed of the world put together could not be? High Duchesses, and"
7534,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ostlers of inns, gather round the Scottish rustic, Burns;--a strange"
7535,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"feeling dwelling in each that they never heard a man like this; that,"
7536,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"on the whole, this is the man! In the secret heart of these people it"
7537,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"still dimly reveals itself, though there is no accredited way of"
7538,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"uttering it at present, that this rustic, with his black brows and"
7539,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"flashing sun-eyes, and strange words moving laughter and tears, is of"
7540,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"a dignity far beyond all others, incommensurable with all others. Do"
7541,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not we feel it so? But now, were Dilettantism, Scepticism, Triviality,"
7542,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and all that sorrowful brood, cast-out of us,--as, by God's blessing,"
7543,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),they shall one day be; were faith in the shows of things entirely
7544,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"swept out, replaced by clear faith in the _things_, so that a man"
7545,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"acted on the impulse of that only, and counted the other non-extant;"
7546,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),what a new livelier feeling towards this Burns were it!
7547,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7548,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Nay here in these ages, such as they are, have we not two mere Poets,"
7549,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"if not deified, yet we may say beatified? Shakespeare and Dante are"
7550,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Saints of Poetry; really, if we will think of it, _canonized_, so that"
7551,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it is impiety to meddle with them. The unguided instinct of the world,"
7552,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"working across all these perverse impediments, has arrived at such"
7553,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"result. Dante and Shakespeare are a peculiar Two. They dwell apart, in"
7554,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"a kind of royal solitude; none equal, none second to them: in the"
7555,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"general feeling of the world, a certain transcendentalism, a glory as"
7556,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of complete perfection, invests these two. They _are_ canonized,"
7557,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"though no Pope or Cardinals took hand in doing it! Such, in spite of"
7558,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"every perverting influence, in the most unheroic times, is still our"
7559,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),indestructible reverence for heroism.--We will look a little at these
7560,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Two, the Poet Dante and the Poet Shakespeare: what little it is"
7561,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),permitted us to say here of the Hero as Poet will most fitly arrange

7566,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Many volumes have been written by way of commentary on Dante and his
7567,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Book; yet, on the whole, with no great result. His Biography is, as it"
7568,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"were, irrecoverably lost for us. An unimportant, wandering,"
7569,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sorrowstricken man, not much note was taken of him while he lived; and"
7570,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the most of that has vanished, in the long space that now intervenes."
7571,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),It is five centuries since he ceased writing and living here. After

7575,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),whoever did it. To me it is a most touching face; perhaps of all faces
7576,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that I know, the most so. Lonely there, painted as on vacancy, with"
7577,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the simple laurel wound round it; the deathless sorrow and pain, the"
7578,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),known victory which is also deathless;--significant of the whole
7579,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),history of Dante! I think it is the mournfullest face that ever was
7580,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"painted from reality; an altogether tragic, heart-affecting face."
7581,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"There is in it, as foundation of it, the softness, tenderness, gentle"
7582,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),affection as of a child; but all this is as if congealed into sharp
7583,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"contradiction, into abnegation, isolation, proud hopeless pain. A soft"
7584,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ethereal soul looking out so stern, implacable, grim-trenchant, as"
7585,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"from imprisonment of thick-ribbed ice! Withal it is a silent pain too,"
7586,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),a silent scornful one: the lip is curled in a kind of god-like disdain
7587,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of the thing that is eating-out his heart,--as if it were withal a"
7588,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"mean insignificant thing, as if he whom it had power to torture and"
7589,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"strangle were greater than it. The face of one wholly in protest, and"

7597,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),The little that we know of Dante's Life corresponds well enough with

7599,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"class of society, in the year 1265. His education was the best then"
7600,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"going; much school-divinity, Aristotelean logic, some Latin"
7601,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"classics,--no inconsiderable insight into certain provinces of things:"
7602,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and Dante, with his earnest intelligent nature, we need not doubt,"
7603,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),learned better than most all that was learnable. He has a clear
7604,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"cultivated understanding, and of great subtlety; this best fruit of"
7605,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),education he had contrived to realize from these scholastics. He knows
7606,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"accurately and well what lies close to him; but, in such a time,"
7607,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"without printed books or free intercourse, he could not know well what"
7608,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"was distant: the small clear light, most luminous for what is near,"
7609,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),breaks itself into singular _chiaroscuro_ striking on what is far off.
7610,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"This was Dante's learning from the schools. In life, he had gone"
7611,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),through the usual destinies; been twice out campaigning as a soldier
7612,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"for the Florentine State, been on embassy; had in his thirty-fifth"
7613,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"year, by natural gradation of talent and service, become one of the"
7614,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Chief Magistrates of Florence. He had met in boyhood a certain
7615,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Beatrice Portinari, a beautiful little girl of his own age and rank,"
7616,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and grown-up thenceforth in partial sight of her, in some distant"
7617,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),intercourse with her. All readers know his graceful affecting account
7618,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of this; and then of their being parted; of her being wedded to
7619,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"another, and of her death soon after. She makes a great figure in"
7620,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Dante's Poem; seems to have made a great figure in his life. Of all
7621,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"beings it might seem as if she, held apart from him, far apart at last"
7622,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in the dim Eternity, were the only one he had ever with his whole"
7623,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),strength of affection loved. She died: Dante himself was wedded; but
7624,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it seems not happily, far from happily. I fancy, the rigorous earnest"
7625,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man, with his keen excitabilities, was not altogether easy to make"
7626,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),happy.
7627,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7628,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),We will not complain of Dante's miseries: had all gone right with him
7629,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"as he wished it, he might have been Prior, Podestà, or whatsoever they"
7630,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"call it, of Florence, well accepted among neighbours,--and the world"
7631,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),had wanted one of the most notable words ever spoken or sung. Florence
7632,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),would have had another prosperous Lord Mayor; and the ten dumb
7633,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"centuries continued voiceless, and the ten other listening centuries"
7634,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),(for there will be ten of them and more) had no _Divina Commedia_ to
7635,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),hear! We will complain of nothing. A nobler destiny was appointed for
7636,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"this Dante; and he, struggling like a man led towards death and"
7637,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"crucifixion, could not help fulfilling it. Give _him_ the choice of"
7638,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his happiness! He knew not, more than we do, what was really happy,"
7639,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),what was really miserable.
7640,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7641,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"In Dante's Priorship, the Guelf-Ghibelline, Bianchi-Neri, or some"
7642,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"other confused disturbances rose to such a height, that Dante, whose"
7643,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"party had seemed the stronger, was with his friends cast unexpectedly"
7644,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),forth into banishment; doomed thenceforth to a life of woe and
7645,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),wandering. His property was all confiscated and more; he had the
7646,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"fiercest feeling that it was entirely unjust, nefarious in the sight"
7647,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of God and man. He tried what was in him to get reinstated; tried even
7648,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"by warlike surprisal, with arms in his hand: but it would not do; bad"
7649,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"only had become worse. There is a record, I believe, still extant in"
7650,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Florence Archives, dooming this Dante, wheresoever caught, to be"
7651,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"burnt alive. Burnt alive; so it stands, they say: a very curious"
7652,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"civic document. Another curious document, some considerable number of"
7653,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"years later, is a Letter of Dante's to the Florentine Magistrates,"
7654,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"written in answer to a milder proposal of theirs, that he should"
7655,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"return on condition of apologizing and paying a fine. He answers, with"
7656,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"fixed stern pride: 'If I cannot return without calling myself guilty,"
7657,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"I will never return, _nunquam revertar_.'"
7658,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7659,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),For Dante there was now no home in this world. He wandered from patron
7660,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"to patron, from place to place; proving, in his own bitter words, 'How"
7661,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"hard is the path, _Come è duro calle_.' The wretched are not cheerful"
7662,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"company. Dante, poor and banished, with his proud earnest nature, with"
7663,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his moody humours, was not a man to conciliate men. Petrarch reports"
7664,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of him that being at Can della Scala's court, and blamed one day for"
7665,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his gloom and taciturnity, he answered in no courtier-like way. Della"
7666,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Scala stood among his courtiers, with mimes and buffoons (_nebulones"
7667,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ac histriones_) making him heartily merry; when turning to Dante, he"
7668,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"said: 'Is it not strange, now, that this poor fool should make himself"
7669,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"so entertaining; while you, a wise man, sit there day after day, and"
7670,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"have nothing to amuse us with at all?' Dante answered bitterly: 'No,"
7671,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not strange; your Highness is to recollect the Proverb, _Like to"
7672,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Like_;'--given the amuser, the amusee must also be given! Such a man,"
7673,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"with his proud silent ways, with his sarcasms and sorrows, was not"
7674,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"made to succeed at court. By degrees, it came to be evident to him"
7675,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that he had no longer any resting-place, or hope of benefit, in this"
7676,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"earth. The earthly world had cast him forth, to wander, wander; no"
7677,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),living heart to love him now; for his sore miseries there was no
7678,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),solace here.
7679,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7680,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),The deeper naturally would the Eternal World impress itself on him;
7681,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that awful reality over which, after all, this Time-world, with its"
7682,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Florences and banishments, only flutters as an unreal shadow. Florence"
7683,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),thou shalt never see: but Hell and Purgatory and Heaven thou shalt
7684,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"surely see! What is Florence, Can della Scala, and the World and Life"
7685,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"altogether? ETERNITY: thither, of a truth, not elsewhither, art thou"
7686,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and all things bound! The great soul of Dante, homeless on earth, made"
7687,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),its home more and more in that awful other world. Naturally his
7688,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"thoughts brooded on that, as on the one fact important for him. Bodied"
7689,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"or bodiless, it is the one fact important for all men:--but to Dante,"
7690,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in that age, it was bodied in fixed certainty of scientific shape; he"
7691,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"no more doubted of that _Malebolge_ Pool, that it all lay there with"
7692,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"its gloomy circles, with its _alti guai_, and that he himself should"
7693,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"see it, than we doubt that we should see Constantinople if we went"
7694,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"thither. Dante's heart, long filled with this, brooding over it in"
7695,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"speechless thought and awe, bursts forth at length into 'mystic"
7696,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"unfathomable song'; and this his _Divine Comedy_, the most remarkable"
7697,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of all modern Books, is the result."
7698,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7699,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"It must have been a great solacement to Dante, and was, as we can see,"
7700,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"a proud thought for him at times, That he, here in exile, could do"
7701,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"this work; that no Florence, nor no man or men, could hinder him from"
7702,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"doing it, or even much help him in doing it. He knew too, partly, that"
7703,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it was great; the greatest a man could do. 'If thou follow thy star,"
7704,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_Se tu segui tua stella_,'--so could the Hero, in his forsakenness, in"
7705,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his extreme need, still say to himself: 'Follow thou thy star, thou"
7706,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"shalt not fail of a glorious heaven!' The labour of writing, we find,"
7707,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and indeed could know otherwise, was great and painful for him; he"
7708,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"says, This Book, 'which has made me lean for many years.' Ah yes, it"
7709,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"was won, all of it, with pain and sore toil,--not in sport, but in"

7711,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"written, in many senses, with his heart's blood. It is his whole"
7712,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"history, this Book. He died after finishing it; not yet very old, at"
7713,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the age of fifty-six;--broken-hearted rather, as is said. He lies"

7755,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),otherwise; for the essence and material of the work are themselves
7756,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"rhythmic. Its depth, and rapt passion and sincerity, makes it"
7757,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"musical;--go _deep_ enough, there is music everywhere. A true inward"
7758,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"symmetry, what one calls an architectural harmony, reigns in it,"
7759,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),proportionates it all: architectural; which also partakes of the
7760,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"character of music. The three kingdoms, _Inferno_, _Purgatorio_,"
7761,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_Paradiso_, look out on one another like compartments of a great"
7762,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"edifice; a great supernatural world-cathedral, piled up there, stern,"
7763,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"solemn, awful; Dante's World of Souls! It is, at bottom, the"
7764,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_sincerest_ of all Poems; sincerity, here too, we find to be the"
7765,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),measure of worth. It came deep out of the author's heart of hearts;
7766,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and it goes deep, and through long generations, into ours. The people"
7767,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of Verona, when they saw him on the streets, used to say, '_Eccovi l'"
7768,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"uom ch' è stato all' Inferno_, See, there is the man that was in"
7769,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Hell!' Ah, yes, he had been in Hell;--in Hell enough, in long severe"
7770,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),sorrow and struggle; as the like of him is pretty sure to have been.
7771,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Commedias that come-out _divine_ are not accomplished otherwise.
7772,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Thought, true labour of any kind, highest virtue itself, is it not the"
7773,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"daughter of Pain? Born as out of the black whirlwind;--true _effort_,"
7774,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in fact, as of a captive struggling to free himself: that is Thought."
7775,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"In all ways we are 'to become perfect through _suffering_.'--But, as I"
7776,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"say, no work known to me is so elaborated as this of Dante's. It has"
7777,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all been as if molten, in the hottest furnace of his soul. It had made"
7778,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),him 'lean' for many years. Not the general whole only; every
7779,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"compartment of it is worked-out, with intense earnestness, into truth,"
7780,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),into clear visuality. Each answers to the other; each fits in its
7781,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"place, like a marble stone accurately hewn and polished. It is the"
7782,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"soul of Dante, and in this the soul of the Middle Ages, rendered for"
7783,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),ever rhythmically visible there. No light task; a right intense one:
7784,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),but a task which is _done_.
7785,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7786,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Perhaps one would say, _intensity_, with the much that depends on it,"
7787,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),is the prevailing character of Dante's genius. Dante does not come
7788,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"before us as a large catholic mind; rather as a narrow, and even"
7789,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sectarian mind: it is partly the fruit of his age and position, but"
7790,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"partly too of his own nature. His greatness has, in all senses,"
7791,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),concentered itself into fiery emphasis and depth. He is world-great
7792,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not because he is world-wide, but because he is world-deep. Through"
7793,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),all objects he pierces as it were down into the heart of Being. I know
7794,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"nothing so intense as Dante. Consider, for example, to begin with the"
7795,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"outermost development of his intensity, consider how he paints. He has"
7796,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),a great power of vision; seizes the very type of a thing; presents
7797,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),that and nothing more. You remember that first view he gets of the
7798,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Hall of Dite: _red_ pinnacle, red-hot cone of iron glowing through the"
7799,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"dim immensity of gloom;--so vivid, so distinct, visible at once and"
7800,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),for ever! It is as an emblem of the whole genius of Dante. There is a
7801,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"brevity, an abrupt precision in him: Tacitus is not briefer, more"
7802,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"condensed; and then in Dante it seems a natural condensation,"
7803,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"spontaneous to the man. One smiting word; and then there is silence,"
7804,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),nothing more said. His silence is more eloquent than words. It is
7805,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),strange with what a sharp decisive grace he snatches the true likeness
7806,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of a matter: cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire. Plutus, the"
7807,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"blustering giant, collapses at Virgil's rebuke; it is 'as the sails"
7808,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sink, the mast being suddenly broken'. Or that poor Sordello, with the"
7809,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_cotto aspetto_, 'face _baked_', parched brown and lean; and the"
7810,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"'fiery snow' that falls on them there, a 'fiery snow without wind',"
7811,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"slow, deliberate, never-ending! Or the lids of those Tombs; square"
7812,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sarcophaguses, in that silent dim-burning Hall, each with its Soul in"
7813,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),torment; the lids laid open there; they are to be shut at the Day of
7814,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Judgement, through Eternity. And how Farinata rises; and how"
7815,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Cavalcante falls--at hearing of his Son, and the past tense '_fue_!'"
7816,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"The very movements in Dante have something brief; swift, decisive,"
7817,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),almost military. It is of the inmost essence of his genius this sort
7818,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of painting. The fiery, swift Italian nature of the man, so silent,"
7819,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"passionate, with its quick abrupt movements, its silent 'pale rages',"
7820,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),speaks itself in these things.
7821,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7822,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),For though this of painting is one of the outermost developments of a
7823,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man, it comes like all else from the essential faculty of him; it is"
7824,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),physiognomical of the whole man. Find a man whose words paint you a
7825,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"likeness, you have found a man worth something; mark his manner of"
7826,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"doing it, as very characteristic of him. In the first place, he could"
7827,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not have discerned the object at all, or seen the vital type of it,"
7828,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"unless he had, what we may call, _sympathized_ with it,--had sympathy"
7829,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),in him to bestow on objects. He must have been _sincere_ about it too;
7830,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),sincere and sympathetic: a man without worth cannot give you the
7831,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"likeness of any object; he dwells in vague outwardness, fallacy and"
7832,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"trivial hearsay, about all objects. And indeed may we not say that"
7833,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),intellect altogether expresses itself in this power of discerning what
7834,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),an object is? Whatsoever of faculty a man's mind may have will come
7835,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"out here. Is it even of business, a matter to be done? The gifted man"
7836,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is he who _sees_ the essential point, and leaves all the rest aside as"
7837,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"surplusage: it is his faculty too, the man of business's faculty, that"
7838,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"he discern the true _likeness_, not the false superficial one, of the"
7839,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),thing he has got to work in. And how much of _morality_ is in the kind
7840,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of insight we get of anything; 'the eye seeing in all things what it
7841,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),brought with it the faculty of seeing!' To the mean eye all things are
7842,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"trivial, as certainly as to the jaundiced they are yellow. Raphael,"
7843,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Painters tell us, is the best of all Portrait-painters withal. No"
7844,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),most gifted eye can exhaust the significance of any object. In the
7845,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),commonest human face there lies more than Raphael will take away with
7846,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),him.
7847,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7848,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Dante's painting is not graphic only, brief, true, and of a vividness"
7849,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"as of fire in dark night; taken on the wider scale, it is everyway"
7850,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"noble, and the outcome of a great soul. Francesca and her Lover, what"
7851,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"qualities in that! A thing woven as out of rainbows, on a ground of"
7852,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"eternal black. A small flute-voice of infinite wail speaks there, into"
7853,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),our very heart of hearts. A touch of womanhood in it too: _della bella
7854,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"persona, che mi fu tolta_; and how, even in the Pit of woe, it is a"
7855,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),solace that _he_ will never part from her! Saddest tragedy in these
7856,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_alti guai_. And the racking winds, in that _aer bruno_, whirl them"
7857,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"away again, to wail for ever!--Strange to think: Dante was the friend"
7858,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of this poor Francesca's father; Francesca herself may have sat upon
7859,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Poet's knee, as a bright innocent little child. Infinite pity, yet"
7860,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),also infinite rigour of law: it is so Nature is made; it is so Dante
7861,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),discerned that she was made. What a paltry notion is that of his
7862,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),_Divine Comedy's_ being a poor splenetic impotent terrestrial libel;
7863,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),putting those into Hell whom he could not be avenged upon on earth! I
7864,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"suppose if ever pity, tender as a mother's, was in the heart of any"
7865,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man, it was in Dante's. But a man who does not know rigour cannot pity"
7866,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"either. His very pity will be cowardly, egoistic,--sentimentality, or"
7867,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),little better. I know not in the world an affection equal to that of
7868,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Dante. It is a tenderness, a trembling, longing, pitying love: like"
7869,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the wail of Aeolean harps, soft, soft; like a child's young"
7870,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"heart;--and then that stern, sore-saddened heart! These longings of"
7871,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),his towards his Beatrice; their meeting together in the _Paradiso_;
7872,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his gazing in her pure transfigured eyes, her that had been purified"
7873,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"by death so long, separated from him so far:--one likens it to the"
7874,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"gong of angels; it is among the purest utterances of affection,"
7875,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"perhaps the very purest, that ever came out of a human soul."
7876,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7877,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),For the _intense_ Dante is intense in all things; he has got into the
7878,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"essence of all. His intellectual insight as painter, on occasion too"
7879,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"as reasoner, is but the result of all other sorts of intensity."
7880,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Morally great, above all, we must call him; it is the beginning of"
7881,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all. His scorn, his grief are as transcendent as his love;--as indeed,"
7882,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),what are they but the _inverse_ or _converse_ of his love? '_A Dio
7883,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"spiacenti, ed a' nemici sui_, Hateful to God and to the enemies of"
7884,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"God:' lofty scorn, unappeasable silent reprobation and aversion; '_Non"
7885,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ragionam di lor_, We will not speak of _them_, look only and pass.' Or"
7886,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"think of this: 'They have not the _hope_ to die, _Non han speranza di"
7887,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"morte_.' One day, it had risen sternly benign on the scathed heart of"
7888,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Dante, that he, wretched, never-resting, worn as he was, would full"
7889,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),surely _die_; 'that Destiny itself could not doom him not to die.'
7890,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Such words are in this man. For rigour, earnestness and depth, he is"
7891,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),not to be paralleled in the modern world; to seek his parallel we must
7892,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"go into the Hebrew Bible, and live with the antique Prophets there."
7893,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
7894,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"I do not agree with much modern criticism, in greatly preferring the"
7895,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),_Inferno_ to the two other parts of the Divine _Commedia_. Such
7896,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"preference belongs, I imagine, to our general Byronism of taste, and"
7897,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is like to be a transient feeling. The _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_,"
7898,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"especially the former, one would almost say, is even more excellent"
7899,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"than it. It is a noble thing that _Purgatorio_, 'Mountain of"
7900,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Purification'; an emblem of the noblest conception of that age. If Sin
7901,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is so fatal, and Hell is and must be so rigorous, awful, yet in"
7902,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Repentance too is man purified; Repentance is the grand Christian act.
7903,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"It is beautiful how Dante works it out. The _tremolar dell' onde_,"
7904,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that 'trembling' of the ocean-waves, under the first pure gleam of"
7905,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"morning, dawning afar on the wandering Two, is as the type of an"
7906,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"altered mood. Hope has now dawned; never-dying Hope, if in company"
7907,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),still with heavy sorrow. The obscure sojourn of daemons and reprobate
7908,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is under foot; a soft breathing of penitence mounts higher and higher,"
7909,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"to the Throne of Mercy itself. 'Pray for me,' the denizens of that"
7910,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Mount of Pain all say to him. 'Tell my Giovanna to pray for me,' my"
7911,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),daughter Giovanna; 'I think her mother loves me no more!' They toil
7912,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"painfully up by that winding steep, 'bent-down like corbels of a"
7913,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"building,' some of them,--crushed together so 'for the sin of pride';"
7914,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"yet nevertheless in years, in ages and aeons, they shall have reached"
7915,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the top, which is Heaven's gate, and by Mercy shall have been admitted"
7916,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in. The joy too of all, when one has prevailed; the whole Mountain"
7917,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"shakes with joy, and a psalm of praise rises, when one soul has"
7918,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"perfected repentance, and got its sin and misery left behind! I call"
7919,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),all this a noble embodiment of a true noble thought.

7922,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"indispensable to one another. The _Paradiso_, a kind of inarticulate"
7923,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"music to me, is the redeeming side of the _Inferno_; the _Inferno_"
7924,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"without it were untrue. All three make up the true Unseen World, as"
7925,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),figured in the Christianity of the Middle Ages; a thing for ever
7926,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"memorable, for ever true in the essence of it, to all men. It was"
7927,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),perhaps delineated in no human soul with such depth of veracity as in
7928,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"this of Dante's; a man _sent_ to sing it, to keep it long memorable."
7929,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Very notable with what brief simplicity he passes out of the every-day
7930,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"reality, into the Invisible one; and in the second or third stanza, we"
7931,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"find ourselves in the World of Spirits; and dwell there, as among"
7932,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"things palpable, indubitable! To Dante they _were_ so; the real world,"
7933,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"as it is called, and its facts, was but the threshold to an infinitely"
7934,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"higher Fact of a World. At bottom, the one was as _preter_natural as"
7935,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the other. Has not each man a soul? He will not only be a spirit, but"
7936,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),is one. To the earnest Dante it is all one visible Fact; he believes
7937,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it, sees it; is the Poet of it in virtue of that. Sincerity, I say"
7938,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"again, is the saving merit, now as always."
7939,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),

7943,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"altogether to think as Dante did, may find this too all an 'Allegory',"
7944,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"perhaps an idle Allegory! It is a sublime embodiment, or sublimest, of"
7945,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the soul of Christianity. It expresses, as in huge world-wide"
7946,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"architectural emblems, how the Christian Dante felt Good and Evil to"
7947,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"be the two polar elements of this Creation, on which it all turns;"
7948,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that these two differ not by _preferability_ of one to the other, but"
7949,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),by incompatibility absolute and infinite; that the one is excellent
7950,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and high as light and Heaven, the other hideous, black as Gehenna and"
7951,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Pit of Hell! Everlasting Justice, yet with Penitence, with"
7952,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"everlasting Pity,--all Christianism, as Dante and the Middle Ages had"
7953,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it, is emblemed there. Emblemed: and yet, as I urged the other day,"
7954,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),with what entire truth of purpose; how unconscious of any embleming!
7955,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Hell, Purgatory, Paradise: these things were not fashioned as emblems;"
7956,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"was there, in our Modern European Mind, any thought at all of their"
7957,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),being emblems! Were they not indubitable awful facts; the whole heart
7958,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of man taking them for practically true, all Nature everywhere"
7959,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),confirming them? So is it always in these things. Men do not believe
7960,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"an Allegory. The future Critic, whatever his new thought may be, who"
7961,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"considers this of Dante to have been all got-up as an Allegory, will"
7962,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),commit one sore mistake!--Paganism we recognized as a veracious
7963,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),expression of the earnest awe-struck feeling of man towards the
7964,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Universe; veracious, true once, and still not without worth for us."
7965,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),But mark here the difference of Paganism and Christianism; one great
7966,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),difference. Paganism emblemed chiefly the Operations of Nature; the
7967,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"destinies, efforts, combinations, vicissitudes of things and men in"
7968,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"this world; Christianism emblemed the Law of Human Duty, the Moral Law"
7969,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of Man. One was for the sensuous nature: a rude helpless utterance of
7970,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the _first_ Thought of men,--the chief recognized virtue, Courage,"
7971,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Superiority to Fear. The other was not for the sensuous nature, but"
7972,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"for the moral. What a progress is here, if in that one respect only!--"

7979,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the finishing of it is Dante's. So always. The craftsman there, the"
7980,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"smith with that metal of his, with these tools, with these cunning"
7981,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"methods,--how little of all he does is properly _his_ work! All past"

7983,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),things. Dante is the spokesman of the Middle Ages; the Thought they
7984,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"lived by stands here, in everlasting music. These sublime ideas of"
7985,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his, terrible and beautiful, are the fruit of the Christian Meditation"
7986,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of all the good men who had gone before him. Precious they; but also

8000,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),differs altogether from what is uttered by the outer part. The outer
8001,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is of the day, under the empire of mode; the outer passes away, in"
8002,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"swift endless changes; the inmost is the same yesterday, to-day, and"

8006,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),they will feel that this Dante too was a brother. Napoleon in
8007,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Saint-Helena is charmed with the genial veracity of old Homer. The

8011,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"for depth of sincerity, is like an antique Prophet too; his words,"
8012,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"like theirs, come from his very heart. One need not wonder if it were"

8014,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),has yet made; for nothing so endures as a truly spoken word. All
8015,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"cathedrals, pontificalities, brass and stone, and outer arrangement"
8016,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"never so lasting, are brief in comparison to an unfathomable"
8017,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"heart-song like this: one feels as if it might survive, still of"
8018,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"importance to men, when these had all sunk into new irrecognizable"
8019,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"combinations, and had ceased individually to be. Europe has made much;"
8020,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"great cities, great empires, encyclopaedias, creeds, bodies of opinion"
8021,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),and practice: but it has made little of the class of Dante's Thought.
8022,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Homer yet _is_, veritably present face to face with every open soul of"

8025,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),existence of it all gone. Like a dream; like the dust of King
8026,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Agamemnon! Greece was; Greece, except in the _words_ it spoke, is not."
8027,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8028,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),The uses of this Dante? We will not say much about his 'uses'. A human
8029,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"soul who has once got into that primal element of _Song_, and sung"
8030,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"forth fitly somewhat therefrom, has worked in the _depths_ of our"
8031,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),existence; feeding through long times the life-_roots_ of all
8032,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"excellent human things whatsoever,--in a way that 'utilities' will not"
8033,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),succeed well in calculating! We will not estimate the Sun by the
8034,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"quantity of gas-light it saves us; Dante shall be invaluable, or of no"
8035,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),value. One remark I may make: the contrast in this respect between the
8036,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Hero-Poet and the Hero-Prophet. In a hundred years, Mahomet, as we"
8037,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"saw, had his Arabians at Grenada and at Delhi; Dante's Italians seem"
8038,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"to be yet very much where they were. Shall we say, then, Dante's"
8039,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),effect on the world was small in comparison? Not so: his arena is far
8040,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"more restricted; but also it is far nobler, clearer;--perhaps not less"
8041,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"but more important. Mahomet speaks to great masses of men, in the"
8042,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"coarse dialect adapted to such; a dialect filled with inconsistencies,"
8043,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"crudities, follies: on the great masses alone can he act, and there"
8044,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"with good and with evil strangely blended. Dante speaks to the noble,"
8045,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the pure and great, in all times and places. Neither does he grow"
8046,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"obsolete, as the other does. Dante burns as a pure star, fixed there"
8047,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in the firmament, at which the great and the high of all ages kindle"
8048,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),themselves: he is the possession of all the chosen of the world for
8049,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"uncounted time. Dante, one calculates, may long survive Mahomet. In"
8050,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),this way the balance may be made straight again.
8051,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8052,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"But, at any rate, it is not by what is called their effect on the"
8053,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"world by what _we_ can judge of their effect there, that a man and his"
8054,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),work are measured. Effect? Influence? Utility? Let a man _do_ his
8055,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),work; the fruit of it is the care of Another than he. It will grow its
8056,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),own fruit; and whether embodied in Caliph Thrones and Arabian
8057,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Conquests, so that it 'fills all Morning and Evening Newspapers', and"
8058,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all Histories, which are a kind of distilled Newspapers; or not"
8059,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),embodied so at all;--what matters that? That is not the real fruit of
8060,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it! The Arabian Caliph, in so far only as he did something, was"
8061,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"something. If the great Cause of Man, and Man's work in God's Earth,"
8062,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"got no furtherance from the Arabian Caliph, then no matter how many"
8063,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"scimitars he drew, how many gold piastres pocketed, and what uproar"
8064,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and blaring he made in this world,--_he_ was but a loud-sounding"
8065,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"inanity and futility; at bottom, he _was_ not at all. Let us honour"

8135,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Shakespeare was the free gift of Nature; given altogether
8136,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"silently;--received altogether silently, as if it had been a thing of"
8137,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"little account. And yet, very literally, it is a priceless thing. One"
8138,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),should look at that side of matters too.
8139,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8140,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Of this Shakespeare of ours, perhaps the opinion one sometimes hears a"
8141,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"little idolatrously expressed is, in fact, the right one; I think the"
8142,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"best judgement not of this country only, but of Europe at large, is"
8143,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"slowly pointing to the conclusion, That Shakespeare is the chief of"
8144,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all Poets hitherto; the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world,"
8145,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"has left record of himself in the way of literature. On the whole, I"
8146,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"know not such a power of vision, such a faculty of thought, if we take"
8147,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all the characters of it, in any other man. Such a calmness of depth;"
8148,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),placid joyous strength; all things imaged in that great soul of his so
8149,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"true and clear, as in a tranquil unfathomable sea! It has been said,"
8150,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that in the constructing of Shakespeare's Dramas there is, apart from"
8151,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all other 'faculties' as they are called, an understanding manifested,"
8152,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),equal to that in Bacon's _Novum Organum_. That is true; and it is not
8153,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),a truth that strikes every one. It would become more apparent if we
8154,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"tried, any of us for himself, how, out of Shakespeare's dramatic"
8155,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"materials, _we_ could fashion such a result! The built house seems all"
8156,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"so fit,--everyway as it should be, as if it came there by its own law"
8157,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and the nature of things,--we forget the rude disorderly quarry it was"
8158,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"shaped from. The very perfection of the house, as if Nature herself"
8159,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"had made it, hides the builder's merit. Perfect, more perfect than any"
8160,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"other man, we may call Shakespeare in this: he discerns, knows as by"
8161,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"instinct, what condition he works under, what his materials are, what"
8162,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),his own force and its relation to them is. It is not a transitory
8163,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),glance of insight that will suffice; it is deliberate illumination of
8164,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the whole matter; it is a calmly _seeing_ eye; a great intellect, in"
8165,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"short. How a man, of some wide thing that he has witnessed, will"
8166,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"construct a narrative, what kind of picture and delineation he will"
8167,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"give of it,--is the best measure you could get of what intellect is"
8168,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),in the man. Which circumstance is vital and shall stand prominent;
8169,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"which unessential, fit to be suppressed; where is the true"
8170,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_beginning_, the true sequence and ending? To find out this, you task"
8171,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),the whole force of insight that is in the man. He must _understand_
8172,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the thing; according to the depth of his understanding, will the"
8173,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),fitness of his answer be. You will try him so. Does like join itself
8174,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"to like; does the spirit of method stir in that confusion, so that its"
8175,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"embroilment becomes order? Can the man say, _Fiat lux_, Let there be"
8176,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"light; and out of chaos make a world? Precisely as there, is _light_"
8177,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in himself, will he accomplish this."
8178,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8179,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Or indeed we may say again, it is in what I called Portrait-painting,"
8180,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"delineating of men and things, especially of men, that Shakespeare is"
8181,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),great. All the greatness of the man comes out decisively here. It is
8182,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"unexampled, I think, that calm creative perspicacity of Shakespeare."
8183,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"The thing he looks at reveals not this or that face of it, but its"
8184,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),inmost heart and generic secret: it dissolves itself as in light
8185,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"before him, so that he discerns the perfect structure of it. Creative,"
8186,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"we said: poetic creation, what is this too but _seeing_ the thing"
8187,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sufficiently? The _word_ that will describe the thing, follows of"
8188,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),itself from such clear intense sight of the thing. And is not
8189,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Shakespeare's _morality_, his valour, candour, tolerance,"
8190,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"truthfulness; his whole victorious strength and greatness, which can"
8191,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"triumph over such obstructions, visible there too? Great as the world!"
8192,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"No _twisted_, poor convex-concave mirror, reflecting all objects with"
8193,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),its own convexities and concavities; a perfectly _level_ mirror;--that
8194,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"is to say withal, if we will understand it, a man justly related to"
8195,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all things and men, a good man. It is truly a lordly spectacle how"
8196,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"this great soul takes in all kinds of men and objects, a Falstaff, an"
8197,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Othello, a Juliet, a Coriolanus; sets them all forth to us in their"
8198,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"round completeness; loving, just, the equal brother of all. _Novum"
8199,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Organum_, and all the intellect you will find in Bacon, is of a quite"
8200,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"secondary order; earthy, material, poor in comparison with this. Among"
8201,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"modern men, one finds, in strictness, almost nothing of the same rank."
8202,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Goethe alone, since the days of Shakespeare, reminds me of it. Of him"
8203,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),too you say that he _saw_ the object; you may say what he himself says
8204,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of Shakespeare: 'His characters are like watches with dial-plates of
8205,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"transparent crystal; they show you the hour like others, and the"
8206,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),inward mechanism also is all visible.'
8207,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8208,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),The seeing eye! It is this that discloses the inner harmony of things;
8209,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"what Nature meant, what musical idea Nature has wrapped up in these"
8210,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),often rough embodiments. Something she did mean. To the seeing eye
8211,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"that something were discernible. Are they base, miserable things? You"
8212,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"can laugh over them, you can weep over them; you can in some way or"
8213,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"other genially relate yourself to them;--you can, at lowest, hold your"
8214,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"peace about them, turn away your own and others' face from them, till"
8215,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),the hour come for practically exterminating and extinguishing them! At
8216,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"bottom, it is the Poet's first gift, as it is all men's, that he have"
8217,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),intellect enough. He will be a Poet if he have: a Poet in word; or
8218,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"failing that, perhaps still better, a Poet in act. Whether he write at"
8219,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all; and if so, whether in prose or in verse, will depend on"
8220,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"accidents: who knows on what extremely trivial accidents,--perhaps on"
8221,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"his having had a singing-master, on his being taught to sing in his"
8222,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),boyhood! But the faculty which enables him to discern the inner heart
8223,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of things, and the harmony that dwells there (for what soever exists"
8224,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"has a harmony in the heart of it, or it would not hold together and"
8225,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"exist), is not the result of habits or accidents, but the gift of"
8226,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Nature herself; the primary outfit for a Heroic Man in what sort
8227,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"soever. To the Poet, as to every other, we say first of all, _See_. If"
8228,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"you cannot do that, it is of no use to keep stringing rhymes together,"
8229,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"jingling sensibilities against each other, and _name_ yourself a Poet;"
8230,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"there is no hope for you. If you can, there is, in prose or verse, in"
8231,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"action or speculation, all manner of hope. The crabbed old"
8232,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Schoolmaster used to ask, when they brought him a new pupil, 'But are"
8233,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ye sure he's _not a dunce_?' Why, really one might ask the same thing,"
8234,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),in regard to every man proposed for whatsoever function; and consider
8235,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"it as the one inquiry needful: Are ye sure he's not a dunce? There is,"
8236,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in this world, no other entirely fatal person."
8237,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8238,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"For, in fact, I say the degree of vision that dwells in a man is a"
8239,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"correct measure of the man. If called to define Shakespeare's faculty,"
8240,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"I should say superiority of Intellect, and think I had included all"
8241,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),under that. What indeed are faculties? We talk of faculties as if they
8242,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"were distinct, things separable; as if a man had intellect,"
8243,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"imagination, fancy, &c., as he has hands, feet and arms. That is a"
8244,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"capital error. Then again, we hear of a man's 'intellectual nature',"
8245,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"and of his 'moral nature', as if these again were divisible, and"
8246,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),existed apart. Necessities of language do perhaps prescribe such forms
8247,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of utterance; we must speak, I am aware, in that way, if we are to"
8248,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),speak at all. But words ought not to harden into things for us. It
8249,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"seems to me, our apprehension of this matter is, for most part,"
8250,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"radically falsified thereby. We ought to know withal, and to keep for"
8251,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ever in mind, that these divisions are at bottom but _names_; that"
8252,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man's spiritual nature, the vital Force which dwells in him, is"
8253,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"essentially one and indivisible; that what we call imagination, fancy,"
8254,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"understanding, and so forth, are but different figures of the same"
8255,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Power of Insight, all indissolubly connected with each other,"
8256,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"physiognomically related; that if we knew one of them, we might know"
8257,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all of them. Morality itself, what we call the moral quality of a man,"
8258,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),what is this but another _side_ of the one vital Force whereby he is
8259,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),and works? All that a man does is physiognomical of him. You may see
8260,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"how a man would fight, by the way in which he sings; his courage, or"
8261,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"want of courage, is visible in the word he utters, in the opinion he"
8262,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"has formed, no less than in the stroke he strikes. He is _one_; and"
8263,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),preaches the same Self abroad in all these ways.
8264,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8265,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Without hands a man might have feet, and could still walk: but,"
8266,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"consider it,--without morality, intellect were impossible for him; a"
8267,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),thoroughly immoral _man_ could not know anything at all! To know a
8268,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"thing, what we can call knowing, a man must first _love_ the thing,"
8269,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"sympathize with it: that is, be _virtuously_ related to it. If he have"
8270,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not the justice to put down his own selfishness at every turn, the"
8271,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"courage to stand by the dangerous-true at every turn, how shall he"
8272,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"know? His virtues, all of them, will lie recorded in his knowledge."
8273,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Nature, with her truth, remains to the bad, to the selfish and the"
8274,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),pusillanimous for ever a sealed book: what such can know of Nature is
8275,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"mean, superficial, small; for the uses of the day merely.--But does"
8276,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),not the very Fox know something of Nature? Exactly so: it knows where
8277,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the geese lodge! The human Reynard, very frequent everywhere in the"
8278,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"world, what more does he know but this and the like of this? Nay, it"
8279,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"should be considered too, that if the Fox had not a certain vulpine"
8280,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_morality_, he could not even know where the geese were, or get at the"
8281,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),geese! If he spent his time in splenetic atrabiliar reflections on his
8282,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"own misery, his ill usage by Nature, Fortune and other Foxes, and so"
8283,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"forth; and had not courage, promptitude, practicality, and other"
8284,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"suitable vulpine gifts and graces, he would catch no geese. We may say"
8285,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"of the Fox too, that his morality and insight are of the same"
8286,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),dimensions; different faces of the same internal unity of vulpine
8287,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),life!--These things are worth stating; for the contrary of them acts
8288,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"with manifold very baleful perversion, in this time: what limitations,"
8289,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"modifications they require, your own candour will supply."
8290,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8291,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"If I say, therefore, that Shakespeare is the greatest of Intellects, I"
8292,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),have said all concerning him. But there is more in Shakespeare's
8293,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),intellect than we have yet seen. It is what I call an unconscious
8294,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),intellect; there is more virtue in it than he himself is aware of.
8295,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Novalis beautifully remarks of him, that those Dramas of his are"
8296,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Products of Nature too, deep as Nature herself. I find a great truth"
8297,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),in this saying. Shakespeare's Art is not Artifice; the noblest worth
8298,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of it is not there by plan or precontrivance. It grows up from the
8299,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"deeps of Nature, through this noble sincere soul, who is a voice of"
8300,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Nature. The latest generations of men will find new meanings in
8301,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Shakespeare, new elucidations of their own human being; 'new harmonies"
8302,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),with the infinite structure of the Universe; concurrences with later
8303,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"ideas, affinities with the higher powers and senses of man.' This"
8304,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),well deserves meditating. It is Nature's highest award to a true
8305,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"simple great soul, that he get thus to be _a part of herself_. Such a"
8306,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man's works, whatsoever he with utmost conscious exertion and"
8307,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"forethought shall accomplish, grow up withal _un_consciously, from the"
8308,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"unknown deeps in him;--as the oak-tree grows from the Earth's bosom,"
8309,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),as the mountains and waters shape themselves; with a symmetry grounded
8310,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"on Nature's own laws, conformable to all Truth whatsoever. How much in"
8311,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Shakespeare lies hid; his sorrows, his silent struggles known to"
8312,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"himself; much that was not known at all, not speakable at all: like"
8313,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"_roots_, like sap and forces working underground! Speech is great; but"
8314,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Silence is greater.
8315,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),
8316,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),Withal the joyful tranquillity of this man is notable. I will not
8317,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),blame Dante for his misery: it is as battle without victory; but true
8318,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"battle,--the first, indispensable thing. Yet I call Shakespeare"
8319,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"greater than Dante, in that he fought truly, and did conquer. Doubt it"
8320,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"not, he had his own sorrows: those _Sonnets_ of his will even testify"
8321,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"expressly in what deep waters he had waded, and swum struggling for"
8322,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),his life;--as what man like him ever failed to have to do? It seems to
8323,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"me a heedless notion, our common one, that he sat like a bird on the"

8326,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"forward from rustic deer-poaching to such tragedy-writing, and not"
8327,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"fall in with sorrows by the way? Or, still better, how could a man"

8333,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"pierce and burn, are to be found in Shakespeare; yet he is always in"
8334,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),measure here; never what Johnson would remark as a specially 'good
8335,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),hater'. But his laughter seems to pour from him in floods; he heaps
8336,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"all manner of ridiculous nicknames on the butt he is bantering,"
8337,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"tumbles and tosses him in all sorts of horse-play; you would say,"
8338,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"roars and laughs. And then, if not always the finest, it is always a"
8339,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"genial laughter. Not at mere weakness, at misery or poverty; never. No"
8340,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"man who _can_ laugh, what we call laughing, will laugh at these"
8341,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"things. It is some poor character only _desiring_ to laugh, and have"
8342,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the credit of wit, that does so. Laughter means sympathy; good"
8343,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),laughter is not 'the crackling of thorns under the pot'. Even at
8344,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),stupidity and pretension this Shakespeare does not laugh otherwise
8345,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),than genially. Dogberry and Verges tickle our very hearts; and we
8346,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),dismiss them covered with explosions of laughter: but we like the poor
8347,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),fellows only the better for our laughing; and hope they will get on
8348,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"well there, and continue Presidents of the City-watch.--Such laughter,"
8349,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"like sunshine on the deep sea, is very beautiful to me."

8365,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),which indeed together form one beautiful thing. That battle of

8389,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"the Globe Playhouse: his great soul had to crush itself, as it could,"

8411,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"worship as they can! We may say without offence, that there rises a"
8412,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),kind of universal Psalm out of this Shakespeare too; not unfit to make
8413,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),itself heard among the still more sacred Psalms. Not in disharmony
8414,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"with these, if we understood them, but in unison!--I cannot call this"
8415,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"Shakespeare a 'Sceptic', as some do; his indifference to the creeds"
8416,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),and theological quarrels of his time misleading them. No: neither

8419,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),fruit of his greatness withal: his whole heart was in his own grand

8421,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"vitally important to other men, were not vital to him."

8426,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),of such a man being sent into this Earth. Is he not an eye to us all;
8427,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"a blessed heaven-sent Bringer of Light?--And, at bottom, was it not"
8428,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"perhaps far better that this Shakespeare, everyway an unconscious man,"
8429,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"was _conscious_ of no Heavenly message? He did not feel, like Mahomet,"
8430,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"because he saw into those internal Splendours, that he specially was"

8433,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),more successful. It was intrinsically an error that notion of

8435,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),inextricably involved in error to this day; dragging along with it

8440,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"in Arabia, as I compute, Mahomet will have exhausted himself and"

8449,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),"he was _conscious_ of was a mere error; a futility and triviality,--as"
8450,THE HERO AS POET. DANTE; SHAKESPEARE (1840),indeed such ever is. The truly great in him too was the unconscious:

8535,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),WHAT IS POETRY? (1844)
8536,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8537,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8538,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Poetry, strictly and artistically so called, that is to say,"
8539,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"considered not merely as poetic feeling, which is more or less shared"
8540,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"by all the world, but as the operation of that feeling, such as we see"
8541,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it in the poet's book, is the utterance of a passion for truth,"
8542,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beauty, and power, embodying and illustrating its conceptions by"
8543,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination and fancy, and modulating its language on the principle of"
8544,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),variety in uniformity. Its means are whatever the universe contains;
8545,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and its ends, pleasure and exaltation. Poetry stands between nature"
8546,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and convention, keeping alive among us the enjoyment of the external"
8547,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and the spiritual world: it has constituted the most enduring fame of
8548,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nations; and, next to Love and Beauty, which are its parents, is the"
8549,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"greatest proof to man of the pleasure to be found in all things, and"
8550,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of the probable riches of infinitude.
8551,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8552,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Poetry is a passion,[25] because it seeks the deepest impressions; and"
8553,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"because it must undergo, in order to convey, them."
8554,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8555,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"[25] _Passio_, suffering in a good sense,--ardent subjection"
8556,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of one's-self to emotion.
8557,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8558,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is a passion for truth, because without truth the impression would"
8559,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),be false or defective.
8560,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8561,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is a passion for beauty, because its office is to exalt and refine"
8562,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"by means of pleasure, and because beauty is nothing but the loveliest"
8563,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),form of pleasure.
8564,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8565,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is a passion for power, because power is impression triumphant,"
8566,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"whether over the poet, as desired by himself, or over the reader, as"
8567,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),affected by the poet.
8568,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8569,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It embodies and illustrates its impressions by imagination, or images"
8570,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of the objects of which it treats, and other images brought in to"
8571,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"throw light on those objects, in order that it may enjoy and impart"
8572,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the feeling of their truth in its utmost conviction and affluence.
8573,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8574,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It illustrates them by fancy, which is a lighter play of imagination,"
8575,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"or the feeling of analogy coming short of seriousness, in order that"
8576,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it may laugh with what it loves, and show how it can decorate it with"
8577,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),fairy ornament.
8578,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8579,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It modulates what it utters, because in running the whole round of"
8580,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beauty it must needs include beauty of sound; and because, in the"
8581,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"height of its enjoyment, it must show the perfection of its triumph,"
8582,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and make difficulty itself become part of its facility and joy.
8583,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8584,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And lastly, Poetry shapes this modulation into uniformity for its"
8585,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"outline, and variety for its parts, because it thus realizes the last"
8586,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"idea of beauty itself, which includes the charm of diversity within"
8587,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the flowing round of habit and ease.
8588,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8589,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Poetry is imaginative passion. The quickest and subtlest test of the
8590,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),possession of its essence is in expression; the variety of things to
8591,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),be expressed shows the amount of its resources; and the continuity of
8592,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the song completes the evidence of its strength and greatness. He who
8593,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"has thought, feeling, expression, imagination, action, character, and"
8594,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"continuity, all in the largest amount and highest degree, is the"
8595,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),greatest poet.
8596,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8597,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Poetry includes whatsoever of painting can be made visible to the
8598,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"mind's eye, and whatsoever of music can be conveyed by sound and"
8599,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),proportion without singing or instrumentation. But it far surpasses
8600,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"those divine arts in suggestiveness, range, and intellectual"
8601,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"wealth;--the first, in expression of thought, combination of images,"
8602,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and the triumph over space and time; the second, in all that can be"
8603,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"done by speech, apart from the tones and modulations of pure sound."
8604,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Painting and music, however, include all those portions of the gift of"
8605,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),poetry that can be expressed and heightened by the visible and
8606,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"melodious. Painting, in a certain apparent manner, is things"
8607,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"themselves; music, in a certain audible manner, is their very emotion"
8608,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and grace. Music and painting are proud to be related to poetry, and"
8609,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),poetry loves and is proud of them.
8610,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8611,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Poetry begins where matter of fact or of science ceases to be merely
8612,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"such, and to exhibit a further truth; that is to say, the connexion it"
8613,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"has with the world of emotion, and its power to produce imaginative"
8614,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"pleasure. Inquiring of a gardener, for instance, what flower it is we"
8615,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"see yonder, he answers, 'a lily'. This is matter of fact. The botanist"
8616,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),pronounces it to be of the order of 'Hexandria Monogynia'. This is
8617,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"matter of science. It is the 'lady' of the garden, says Spenser; and"
8618,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),here we begin to have a poetical sense of its fairness and grace. It
8619,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),is
8620,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8621,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The plant and flower of _light_,"
8622,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8623,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),says Ben Jonson; and poetry then shows us the beauty of the flower in
8624,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),all its mystery and splendour.
8625,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8626,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"If it be asked, how we know perceptions like these to be true, the"
8627,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"answer is, by the fact of their existence--by the consent and delight"
8628,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of poetic readers. And as feeling is the earliest teacher, and"
8629,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"perception the only final proof, of things the most demonstrable by"
8630,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"science, so the remotest imaginations of the poets may often be found"
8631,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),to have the closest connexion with matter of fact; perhaps might
8632,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"always be so, if the subtlety of our perceptions were a match for the"
8633,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),causes of them. Consider this image of Ben Jonson's--of a lily being
8634,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the flower of light. Light, undecomposed, is white; and as the lily is"
8635,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"white, and light is white, and whiteness itself is nothing _but_"
8636,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"light, the two things, so far, are not merely similar, but identical."
8637,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"A poet might add, by an analogy drawn from the connexion of light and"
8638,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"colour, that there is a 'golden dawn' issuing out of the white lily,"
8639,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),in the rich yellow of the stamens. I have no desire to push this
8640,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),similarity farther than it may be worth. Enough has been stated to
8641,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"show that, in poetical as in other analogies, 'the same feet of"
8642,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Nature', as Bacon says, may be seen 'treading in different paths'; and"
8643,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"that the most scornful, that is to say, dullest disciple of fact,"
8644,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),should be cautious how he betrays the shallowness of his philosophy by
8645,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),discerning no poetry in its depths.
8646,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8647,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),But the poet is far from dealing only with these subtle and analogical
8648,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"truths. Truth of every kind belongs to him, provided it can bud into"
8649,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"any kind of beauty, or is capable of being illustrated and impressed"
8650,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"by the poetic faculty. Nay, the simplest truth is often so beautiful"
8651,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and impressive of itself, that one of the greatest proofs of his"
8652,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"genius consists in his leaving it to stand alone, illustrated by"
8653,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nothing but the light of its own tears or smiles, its own wonder,"
8654,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"might, or playfulness. Hence the complete effect of many a simple"
8655,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"passage in our old English ballads and romances, and of the passionate"
8656,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sincerity in general of the greatest early poets, such as Homer and"
8657,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Chaucer, who flourished before the existence of a 'literary world',"
8658,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and were not perplexed by a heap of notions and opinions, or by doubts"
8659,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),how emotion ought to be expressed. The greatest of their successors
8660,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"never write equally to the purpose, except when they can dismiss"
8661,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),everything from their minds but the like simple truth. In the
8662,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beautiful poem of _Sir Eger, Sir Graham and Sir Gray-Steel_ (see it in"
8663,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Ellis's _Specimens_, or Laing's _Early Metrical Tales_), a knight"
8664,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),thinks himself disgraced in the eyes of his mistress:--
8665,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8666,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Sir Eger said, 'If it be so,"
8667,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Then wot I well I must forgo
8668,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Love-liking, and manhood, all clean!'"

8701,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
8702,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8703,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is thus, by exquisite pertinence, melody, and the implied power of"
8704,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"writing with exuberance, if need be, that beauty and truth become"
8705,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"identical in poetry, and that pleasure, or at the very worst, a balm"

8708,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is a great and rare thing, and shows a lovely imagination, when the"

8710,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"passages of nature, and be thanked for the addition. There is an"
8711,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"instance of this kind in Warner, an old Elizabethan poet, than which I"
8712,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"know nothing sweeter in the world. He is speaking of Fair Rosamond,"
8713,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and of a blow given her by Queen Eleanor.
8714,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8715,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"With that she dash'd her on the lips,"
8716,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_So dyèd double red:

8720,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"There are different kinds and degrees of imagination, some of them"
8721,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"necessary to the formation of every true poet, and all of them"
8722,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),possessed by the greatest. Perhaps they may be enumerated as
8723,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"follows:--First, that which presents to the mind any object or"
8724,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),circumstance in every-day life; as when we imagine a man holding a
8725,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sword, or looking out of a window;--Second, that which presents real,"
8726,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"but not every-day circumstances; as King Alfred tending the loaves,"
8727,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"or Sir Philip Sidney giving up the water to the dying soldier;--Third,"
8728,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),that which combines character and events directly imitated from real
8729,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"life, with imitative realities of its own invention; as the probable"
8730,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"parts of the histories of Priam and _Macbeth_, or what may be called"
8731,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"natural fiction as distinguished from supernatural;--Fourth, that"
8732,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),which conjures up things and events not to be found in nature; as
8733,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Homer's gods, and Shakespeare's witches, enchanted horses and spears,"
8734,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Ariosto's hippogriff, &c.;--Fifth, that which, in order to illustrate"
8735,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"or aggravate one image, introduces another; sometimes in simile, as"
8736,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),when Homer compares Apollo descending in his wrath at noon-day to the
8737,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"coming of night-time: sometimes in metaphor, or simile comprised in a"
8738,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"word, as in Milton's 'motes that _people_ the sunbeams'; sometimes in"
8739,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"concentrating into a word the main history of any person or thing,"
8740,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"past or even future, as in the 'starry Galileo' of Byron, and that"
8741,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),ghastly foregone conclusion of the epithet 'murdered' applied to the
8742,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"yet living victim in Keats's story from Boccaccio,--"
8743,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8744,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),So the two brothers and their _murder'd_ man
8745,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Rode towards fair Florence;--
8746,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8747,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sometimes in the attribution of a certain representative quality which
8748,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),makes one circumstance stand for others; as in Milton's grey-fly
8749,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"winding its '_sultry_ horn', which epithet contains the heat of a"
8750,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"summer's day;--Sixth, that which reverses this process, and makes a"
8751,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"variety of circumstances take colour from one, like nature seen with"
8752,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"jaundiced or glad eyes, or under the influence of storm or sunshine;"
8753,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as when in _Lycidas_, or the Greek pastoral poets, the flowers and"
8754,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the flocks are made to sympathize with a man's death; or, in the"
8755,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Italian poet, the river flowing by the sleeping Angelica seems talking"
8756,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of love--
8757,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8758,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Parea che l'erba le fiorisse intorno,"
8759,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_E d'amor ragionasse quella riva!_
8760,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8761,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Orlando Innamorato_, Canto iii."
8762,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8763,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),or in the voluptuous homage paid to the sleeping Imogen by the very
8764,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"light in the chamber, and the reaction of her own beauty upon itself;"
8765,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),or in the 'witch element' of the tragedy of _Macbeth_ and the May-day
8766,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"night of _Faust_;--Seventh, and last, that which by a single"
8767,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"expression, apparently of the vaguest kind, not only meets but"
8768,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),surpasses in its effect the extremest force of the most particular
8769,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"description; as in that exquisite passage of Coleridge's _Christabel_,"
8770,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),where the unsuspecting object of the witch's malignity is bidden to go
8771,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),to bed:
8772,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8773,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Quoth Christabel, So let it be!"
8774,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And as the lady bade, did she."
8775,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
8776,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_And lay down in her loveliness;--_
8777,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8778,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"a perfect verse surely, both for feeling and music. The very"
8779,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),smoothness and gentleness of the limbs is in the series of the letter
8780,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_l's_.
8781,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8782,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),I am aware of nothing of the kind surpassing that most lovely
8783,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"inclusion of physical beauty in moral, neither can I call to mind any"
8784,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),instances of the imagination that turns accompaniments into
8785,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"accessories, superior to those I have alluded to. Of the class of"
8786,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"comparison, one of the most touching (many a tear must it have drawn"
8787,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),from parents and lovers) is in a stanza which has been copied into
8788,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the _Friar of Orders Grey_, out of Beaumont and Fletcher:"
8789,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8790,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Weep no more, lady, weep no more,"
8791,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Thy sorrow is in vain;
8792,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_For violets pluck'd the sweetest showers
8793,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Will ne'er make grow again._
8794,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8795,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And Shakespeare and Milton abound in the very grandest; such as
8796,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Antony's likening his changing fortunes to the cloud-rack; Lear's
8797,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),appeal to the old age of the heavens; Satan's appearance in the
8798,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"horizon, like a fleet 'hanging in the clouds'; and the comparisons of"
8799,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),him with the comet and the eclipse. Nor unworthy of this glorious
8800,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"company, for its extraordinary combination of delicacy and vastness,"
8801,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),is that enchanting one of Shelley's in the _Adonais_:
8802,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8803,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,"
8804,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Stains the white radiance of eternity.
8805,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8806,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),I multiply these particulars in order to impress upon the reader's
8807,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"mind the great importance of imagination in all its phases, as a"
8808,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),constituent part of the highest poetic faculty.
8809,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8810,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The happiest instance I remember of imaginative metaphor, is"
8811,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Shakespeare's moonlight 'sleeping' on a bank; but half his poetry may
8812,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be said to be made up of it, metaphor indeed being the common coin of"
8813,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"discourse. Of imaginary creatures, none out of the pale of mythology"
8814,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and the East are equal, perhaps, in point of invention, to"
8815,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Shakespeare's Ariel and Caliban; though poetry may grudge to prose the
8816,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"discovery of a Winged Woman, especially such as she has been described"
8817,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),by her inventor in the story of _Peter Wilkins_; and in point of
8818,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"treatment, the Mammon and Jealousy of Spenser, some of the monsters"
8819,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in Dante, particularly his Nimrod, his interchangements of creatures"
8820,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"into one another, and (if I am not presumptuous in anticipating what I"
8821,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),think will be the verdict of posterity) the Witch in Coleridge's
8822,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Christabel_, may rank even with the creations of Shakespeare. It may"
8823,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be doubted, indeed, whether Shakespeare had bile and nightmare enough"
8824,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),in him to have thought of such detestable horrors as those of the
8825,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"interchanging adversaries (now serpent, now man), or even of the huge,"
8826,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"half-blockish enormity of Nimrod,--in Scripture, the 'mighty hunter'"
8827,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and builder of the tower of Babel,--in Dante, a tower of a man in his"
8828,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"own person, standing with some of his brother giants up to the middle"
8829,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in a pit in hell, blowing a horn to which a thunderclap is a whisper,"
8830,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and hallooing after Dante and his guide in the jargon of a lost
8831,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),tongue! The transformations are too odious to quote: but of the
8832,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),towering giant we cannot refuse ourselves the 'fearful joy' of a
8833,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"specimen. It was twilight, Dante tells us, and he and his guide Virgil"
8834,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"were silently pacing through one of the dreariest regions of hell,"
8835,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),when the sound of a tremendous horn made him turn all his attention to
8836,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the spot from which it came. He there discovered through the dusk,"
8837,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"what seemed to be the towers of a city. Those are no towers, said his"
8838,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"guide; they are giants, standing up to the middle in one of these"
8839,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),circular pits.
8840,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8841,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"I look'd again; and as the eye makes out,"
8842,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"By little and little, what the mist conceal'd"
8843,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"In which, till clearing up, the sky was steep'd;"
8844,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So, looming through the gross and darksome air,"
8845,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"As we drew nigh, those mighty bulks grew plain,"
8846,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And error quitted me, and terror join'd:"
8847,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),For in like manner as all round its height
8848,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Montereggione crowns itself with towers,"
8849,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So tower'd above the circuit of that pit,"
8850,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Though but half out of it, and half within,"
8851,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The horrible giants that fought Jove, and still"
8852,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Are threaten'd when he thunders. As we near'd
8853,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The foremost, I discern'd his mighty face,"
8854,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His shoulders, breast, and more than half his trunk,"
8855,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),With both the arms down hanging by the sides.
8856,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His face appear'd to me, in length and breadth,"
8857,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Huge as St. Peter's pinnacle at Rome,"
8858,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And of a like proportion all his bones.
8859,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"He open'd, as we went, his dreadful mouth,"
8860,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Fit for no sweeter psalmody; and shouted
8861,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"After us, in the words of some strange tongue,"
8862,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Ràfel ma-èe amech zabèe almee!--
8863,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'Dull wretch!' my leader cried, 'keep to thine horn,"
8864,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And so vent better whatsoever rage
8865,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Or other passion stuff thee. Feel thy throat
8866,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And find the chain upon thee, thou confusion!"
8867,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Lo! what a hoop is clench'd about thy gorge.'
8868,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Then turning to myself, he said, 'His howl"
8869,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Is its own mockery. This is Nimrod, he"
8870,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Through whose ill thought it was that humankind
8871,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Were tongue-confounded. Pass him, and say nought:"
8872,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For as he speaketh language known of none,"
8873,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),So none can speak save jargon to himself.'
8874,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8875,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Inferno_, Canto xxxi, ver. 34."
8876,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8877,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Assuredly it could not have been easy to find a fiction so uncouthly
8878,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),terrible as this in the hypochondria of Hamlet. Even his father had
8879,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),evidently seen no such ghost in the other world. All his phantoms were
8880,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in the world he had left. Timon, Lear, Richard, Brutus, Prospero,"
8881,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Macbeth himself, none of Shakespeare's men had, in fact, any thought"
8882,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"but of the earth they lived on, whatever supernatural fancy crossed"
8883,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"them. The thing fancied was still a thing of this world, 'in its habit"
8884,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as it lived,' or no remoter acquaintance than a witch or a fairy. Its"
8885,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),lowest depths (unless Dante suggested them) were the cellars under the
8886,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),stage. Caliban himself is a cross-breed between a witch and a clown.
8887,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),No offence to Shakespeare; who was not bound to be the greatest of
8888,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"healthy poets, and to have every morbid inspiration besides. What he"
8889,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"might have done, had he set his wits to compete with Dante, I know"
8890,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not: all I know is, that in the infernal line he did nothing like him;"
8891,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and it is not to be wished he had. It is far better that, as a higher,"
8892,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"more universal, and more beneficent variety of the genus Poet, he"
8893,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"should have been the happier man he was, and left us the plump cheeks"
8894,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"on his monument, instead of the carking visage of the great, but"
8895,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"over-serious, and comparatively one-sided Florentine. Even the"
8896,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination of Spenser, whom we take to have been a 'nervous"
8897,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"gentleman' compared with Shakespeare, was visited with no such dreams"
8898,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as Dante. Or, if it was, he did not choose to make himself thinner (as"
8899,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Dante says _he_ did) with dwelling upon them. He had twenty visions of
8900,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nymphs and bowers, to one of the mud of Tartarus. Chaucer, for all he"
8901,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"was 'a man of this world' as well as the poets' world, and as great,"
8902,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"perhaps a greater enemy of oppression than Dante, besides being one of"
8903,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the profoundest masters of pathos that ever lived, had not the heart"
8904,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to conclude the story of the famished father and his children, as"
8905,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),finished by the inexorable anti-Pisan. But enough of Dante in this
8906,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"place. Hobbes, in order to daunt the reader from objecting to his"
8907,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"friend Davenant's want of invention, says of these fabulous creations"
8908,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in general, in his letter prefixed to the poem of _Gondibert_, that"
8909,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'impenetrable armours, enchanted castles, invulnerable bodies, iron"
8910,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"men, flying horses, and a thousand other such things, are easily"
8911,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),feigned by them that dare'. These are girds at Spenser and Ariosto.
8912,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But, with leave of Hobbes (who translated Homer as if on purpose to"
8913,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"show what execrable verses could be written by a philosopher),"
8914,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),enchanted castles and flying horses are not easily feigned as Ariosto
8915,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and Spenser feigned them; and that just makes all the difference. For
8916,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"proof, see the accounts of Spenser's enchanted castle in Book the"
8917,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Third, Canto Twelfth, of the _Faerie Queene_; and let the reader of"
8918,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Italian open the _Orlando Furioso_ at its first introduction of the
8919,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Hippogriff (Canto iii, st. 4), where Bradamante, coming to an inn,"
8920,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"hears a great noise, and sees all the people looking up at something"
8921,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in the air; upon which, looking up herself, she sees a knight in"
8922,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),shining armour riding towards the sunset upon a creature with
8923,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"variegated wings, and then dipping and disappearing among the hills."
8924,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Chaucer's steed of brass, that was"
8925,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8926,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So horsly and so quick of eye,"
8927,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8928,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),is copied from the life. You might pat him and feel his brazen
8929,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"muscles. Hobbes, in objecting to what he thought childish, made a"
8930,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),childish mistake. His criticism is just such as a boy might pique
8931,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"himself upon, who was educated on mechanical principles, and thought"
8932,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),he had outgrown his Goody Two-shoes. With a wonderful dimness of
8933,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"discernment in poetic matters, considering his acuteness in others, he"
8934,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),fancies he has settled the question by pronouncing such creations
8935,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'impossible'! To the brazier they are impossible, no doubt; but not to"
8936,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the poet. Their possibility, if the poet wills it, is to be conceded;"
8937,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the problem is, the creature being given, how to square its actions"
8938,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with probability, according to the nature assumed of it. Hobbes did"
8939,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not see, that the skill and beauty of these fictions lay in bringing"
8940,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),them within those very regions of truth and likelihood in which he
8941,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"thought they could not exist. Hence the serpent Python of Chaucer,"
8942,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8943,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Sleeping against the sun upon a day,_"
8944,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8945,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"when Apollo slew him. Hence the chariot-drawing dolphins of Spenser,"
8946,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),softly swimming along the shore lest they should hurt themselves
8947,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"against the stones and gravel. Hence Shakespeare's Ariel, living under"
8948,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"blossoms, and riding at evening on the bat; and his domestic namesake"
8949,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),in the _Rape of the Lock_ (the imagination of the drawing-room) saving
8950,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"a lady's petticoat from the coffee with his plumes, and directing"
8951,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),atoms of snuff into a coxcomb's nose. In the _Orlando Furioso_ (Canto
8952,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"xv, st. 65) is a wild story of a cannibal necromancer, who laughs at"
8953,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"being cut to pieces, coming together again like quicksilver, and"
8954,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"picking up his head when it is cut off, sometimes by the hair,"
8955,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sometimes by the nose! This, which would be purely childish and"
8956,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"ridiculous in the hands of an inferior poet, becomes interesting, nay"
8957,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"grand, in Ariosto's, from the beauties of his style, and its"
8958,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),conditional truth to nature. The monster has a fated hair on his
8959,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"head,--a single hair,--which must be taken from it before he can be"
8960,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"killed. Decapitation itself is of no consequence, without that"
8961,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"proviso. The Paladin Astolfo, who has fought this phenomenon on"
8962,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"horseback, and succeeded in getting the head and galloping off with"
8963,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it, is therefore still at a loss what to be at. How is he to discover"
8964,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),such a needle in such a bottle of hay? The trunk is spurring after him
8965,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to recover it, and he seeks for some evidence of the hair in vain. At"
8966,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),length he bethinks him of scalping the head. He does so; and the
8967,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"moment the operation arrives at the place of the hair, _the face of"
8968,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the head becomes pale, the eyes turn in their sockets_, and the"
8969,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),lifeless pursuer tumbles from his horse.
8970,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8971,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Then grew the visage pale, and deadly wet;"
8972,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The eyes turn'd in their sockets, drearily;"
8973,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And all things show'd the villain's sun was set.
8974,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His trunk that was in chase, fell from its horse,"
8975,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And giving the last shudder, was a corse."
8976,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
8977,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is thus, and thus only, by making Nature his companion wherever he"
8978,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"goes, even in the most supernatural region, that the poet, in the"
8979,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"words of a very instructive phrase, takes the world along with him. It"
8980,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is true, he must not (as the Platonists would say) humanize weakly or"
8981,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),mistakenly in that region; otherwise he runs the chance of forgetting
8982,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to be true to the supernatural itself, and so betraying a want of"
8983,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),imagination from that quarter. His nymphs will have no taste of their
8984,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),woods and waters; his gods and goddesses be only so many fair or
8985,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"frowning ladies and gentlemen, such as we see in ordinary paintings;"
8986,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),he will be in no danger of having his angels likened to a sort of
8987,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"wild-fowl, as Rembrandt has made them in his Jacob's Dream. His"
8988,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Bacchuses will never remind us, like Titian's, of the force and fury,"
8989,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as well as of the graces, of wine. His Jupiter will reduce no females"
8990,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),to ashes; his fairies be nothing fantastical; his gnomes not 'of the
8991,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"earth, earthy'. And this again will be wanting to Nature; for it will"
8992,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be wanting to the supernatural, as Nature would have made it, working"
8993,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in a supernatural direction. Nevertheless, the poet, even for"
8994,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination's sake, must not become a bigot to imaginative truth,"
8995,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"dragging it down into the region of the mechanical and the limited,"
8996,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and losing sight of its paramount privilege, which is to make beauty,"
8997,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"in a human sense, the lady and queen of the universe. He would gain"
8998,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nothing by making his ocean-nymphs mere fishy creatures, upon the plea"
8999,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),that such only could live in the water: his wood-nymphs with faces of
9000,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"knotted oak; his angels without breath and song, because no lungs"
9001,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),could exist between the earth's atmosphere and the empyrean. The
9002,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Grecian tendency in this respect is safer than the Gothic; nay, more"
9003,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imaginative; for it enables us to imagine _beyond_ imagination, and to"
9004,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),bring all things healthily round to their only present final ground of
9005,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sympathy,--the human. When we go to heaven, we may idealize in a"
9006,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"superhuman mode, and have altogether different notions of the"
9007,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),beautiful; but till then we must be content with the loveliest
9008,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),capabilities of earth. The sea-nymphs of Greece were still beautiful
9009,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"women, though they lived in the water. The gills and fins of the"
9010,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),ocean's natural inhabitants were confined to their lowest semi-human
9011,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"attendants; or if Triton himself was not quite human, it was because"
9012,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be represented the fiercer part of the vitality of the seas, as they"
9013,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),did the fairer.
9014,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9015,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"To conclude this part of my subject, I will quote from the greatest of"
9016,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),all narrative writers two passages;--one exemplifying the imagination
9017,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"which brings supernatural things to bear on earthly, without"
9018,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"confounding them; the other, that which paints events and"
9019,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"circumstances after real life. The first is where Achilles, who has"
9020,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),long absented himself from the conflict between his countrymen and the
9021,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Trojans, has had a message from heaven bidding him reappear in the"
9022,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"enemy's sight, standing outside the camp-wall upon the trench, but"
9023,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"doing nothing more; that is to say, taking no part in the fight. He is"
9024,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),simply to be seen. The two armies down by the sea-side are contending
9025,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),which shall possess the body of Patroclus; and the mere sight of the
9026,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"dreadful Grecian chief--supernaturally indeed impressed upon them, in"
9027,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),order that nothing may be wanting to the full effect of his courage
9028,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and conduct upon courageous men--is to determine the question. We are
9029,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to imagine a slope of ground towards the sea, in order to elevate the"
9030,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"trench; the camp is solitary; the battle ('a dreadful roar of men,' as"
9031,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Homer calls it) is raging on the sea-shore; and the goddess Iris has
9032,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"just delivered her message, and disappeared."
9033,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9034,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But up Achilles rose, the lov'd of heaven;"
9035,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And Pallas on his mighty shoulders cast
9036,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The shield of Jove; and round about his head
9037,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"She put the glory of a golden mist,"
9038,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),From which there burnt a fiery-flaming light.
9039,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And as, when smoke goes heavenward from a town,"
9040,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"In some far island which its foes besiege,"
9041,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Who all day long with dreadful martialness
9042,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Have pour'd from their own town; soon as the sun
9043,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Has set, thick lifted fires are visible,"
9044,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Which, rushing upward, make a light in the sky,"
9045,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And let the neighbours know, who may perhaps"
9046,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Bring help across the sea; so from the head
9047,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Of great Achilles went up an effulgence.
9048,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9049,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Upon the trench he stood, without the wall,"
9050,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But mix'd not with the Greeks, for he rever'd"
9051,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His mother's word; and so, thus standing there,"
9052,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"He shouted; and Minerva, to his shout,"
9053,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Added a dreadful cry; and there arose

9055,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And as the clear voice of a trumpet, blown"
9056,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Against a town by spirit-withering foes,"
9057,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),So sprang the clear voice of Aeacides.
9058,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And when they heard the brazen cry, their hearts"
9059,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),All leap'd within them; and the proud-maned horses
9060,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Ran with the chariots round, for they foresaw"
9061,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Calamity; and the charioteers were smitten,"
9062,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),When they beheld the ever-active fire
9063,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Upon the dreadful head of the great-minded one
9064,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Burning; for bright-eyed Pallas made it burn.
9065,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Thrice o'er the trench divine Achilles shouted;
9066,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And thrice the Trojans and their great allies
9067,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Roll'd back; and twelve of all their noblest men
9068,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Then perish'd, crush'd by their own arms and chariots."

9071,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9072,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Of course there is no further question about the body of Patroclus. It
9073,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is drawn out of the press, and received by the awful hero with tears."
9074,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9075,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The other passage is where Priam, kneeling before Achilles, and"
9076,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imploring him to give up the dead body of Hector, reminds him of his"
9077,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"own father; who, whatever (says the poor old king) may be his troubles"
9078,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with his enemies, has the blessing of knowing that his son is still"
9079,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"alive, and may daily hope to see him return. Achilles, in accordance"
9080,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with the strength and noble honesty of the passions in those times,"
9081,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"weeps aloud himself at this appeal, feeling, says Homer, 'desire' for"
9082,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),his father in his very 'limbs'. He joins in grief with the venerable
9083,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sufferer, and can no longer withstand the look of 'his grey head and"
9084,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),his grey _chin_'. Observe the exquisite introduction of this last
9085,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),word. It paints the touching fact of the chin's being imploringly
9086,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"thrown upward by the kneeling old man, and the very motion of his"
9087,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),beard as he speaks.
9088,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9089,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So saying, Mercury vanished up to heaven:"
9090,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And Priam then alighted from his chariot,"
9091,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Leaving Idaeus with it, who remain'd"
9092,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Holding the mules and horses; and the old man
9093,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Went straight indoors, where the belov'd of Jove"
9094,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Achilles sat, and found him. In the room"
9095,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Were others, but apart; and two alone,"
9096,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The hero Automedon, and Alcimus,"
9097,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"A branch of Mars, stood by him. They had been"
9098,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"At meals, and had not yet remov'd the board."
9099,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Great Priam came, without their seeing him,"
9100,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And kneeling down, he clasp'd Achilles' knees,"
9101,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And kiss'd those terrible, homicidal hands,"
9102,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Which had deprived him of so many sons.
9103,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And as a man who is press'd heavily
9104,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For having slain another, flies away"
9105,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"To foreign lands, and comes into the house"
9106,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Of some great man, and is beheld with wonder,"
9107,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),So did Achilles wonder to see Priam;
9108,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And the rest wonder'd, looking at each other."
9109,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But Priam, praying to him, spoke these words:--"
9110,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'God-like Achilles, think of thine own father!"
9111,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"To the same age have we both come, the same"
9112,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Weak pass; and though the neighbouring chiefs may vex
9113,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Him also, and his borders find no help,"
9114,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Yet when he hears that thou art still alive,"
9115,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"He gladdens inwardly, and daily hopes"
9116,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To see his dear son coming back from Troy.
9117,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But I, bereav'd old Priam! I had once"
9118,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Brave sons in Troy, and now I cannot say"
9119,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"That one is left me. Fifty children had I,"
9120,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),When the Greeks came; nineteen were of one womb;
9121,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The rest my women bore me in my house.
9122,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The knees of many of these fierce Mars has loosen'd;
9123,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And he who had no peer, Troy's prop and theirs,"
9124,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Him hast thou kill'd now, fighting for his country,"
9125,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Hector; and for his sake am I come here
9126,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"To ransom him, bringing a countless ransom."
9127,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"But thou, Achilles, fear the gods, and think"
9128,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Of thine own father, and have mercy on me:"
9129,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For I am much more wretched, and have borne"
9130,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"What never mortal bore, I think on earth,"
9131,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To lift unto my lips the hand of him
9132,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Who slew my boys.'
9133,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9134,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),He ceased; and there arose
9135,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Sharp longing in Achilles for his father;
9136,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And taking Priam by the hand, he gently"
9137,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Put him away; for both shed tears to think
9138,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Of other times; the one most bitter ones
9139,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For Hector, and with wilful wretchedness"
9140,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Lay right before Achilles: and the other,"
9141,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For his own father now, and now his friend;"
9142,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And the whole house might hear them as they moan'd.
9143,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),But when divine Achilles had refresh'd
9144,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His soul with tears, and sharp desire had left"
9145,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His heart and limbs, he got up from his throne,"
9146,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And rais'd the old man by the hand, and took"
9147,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Pity on his grey head and his grey chin.
9148,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9149,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Iliad_, xxiv. 468."
9150,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9151,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),O lovely and immortal privilege of genius! that can stretch its hand
9152,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"out of the wastes of time, thousands of years back, and touch our"
9153,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),eyelids with tears. In these passages there is not a word which a man
9154,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of the most matter-of-fact understanding might not have written, _if"
9155,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"he had thought of it_. But in poetry, feeling and imagination are"
9156,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),necessary to the perception and presentation even of matters of fact.
9157,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"They, and they only, see what is proper to be told, and what to be"
9158,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"kept back; what is pertinent, affecting, and essential. Without"
9159,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"feeling, there is a want of delicacy and distinction; without"
9160,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination, there is no true embodiment. In poets, even good of their"
9161,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"kind, but without a genius for narration, the action would have been"
9162,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),encumbered or diverted with ingenious mistakes. The over-contemplative
9163,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"would have given us too many remarks; the over-lyrical, a style too"
9164,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"much carried away; the over-fanciful, conceits and too many similes;"
9165,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the unimaginative, the facts without the feeling, and not even those."
9166,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"We should have been told nothing of the 'grey chin', of the house"
9167,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"hearing them as they moaned, or of Achilles gently putting the old man"
9168,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"aside; much less of that yearning for his father, which made the hero"
9169,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),tremble in every limb. Writers without the greatest passion and power
9170,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"do not feel in this way, nor are capable of expressing the feeling;"
9171,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),though there is enough sensibility and imagination all over the world
9172,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to enable mankind to be moved by it, when the poet strikes his truth"
9173,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),into their hearts.
9174,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9175,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The reverse of imagination is exhibited in pure absence of ideas, in"
9176,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"commonplaces, and, above all, in conventional metaphor, or such images"
9177,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and their phraseology as have become the common property of discourse
9178,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and writing. Addison's _Cato_ is full of them.

9181,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Plant daggers in my breast._

9185,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9186,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The virtuous Marcia _towers above her sex_.

9190,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nerve'--'copying a bright example'; in short, the whole play, relieved"
9191,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),now and then with a smart sentence or turn of words. The following is
9192,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),a pregnant example of plagiarism and weak writing. It is from another
9193,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),tragedy of Addison's time--the _Mariamne_ of Fenton:
9194,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9195,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Mariamne, _with superior charms_,"
9196,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Triumphs o'er reason_: in her look she _bears_
9197,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),A paradise of ever-blooming sweets;
9198,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Fair as the first idea beauty _prints_
9199,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),In the young lover's soul; a winning grace
9200,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Guides every gesture, and obsequious love"
9201,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Attends_ on all her steps.
9202,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9203,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),'Triumphing o'er reason' is an old acquaintance of everybody's.
9204,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),'Paradise in her look' is from the Italian poets through Dryden. 'Fair

9210,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"To come now to Fancy,--she is a younger sister of Imagination, without"

9213,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),affecting analogies; the perception of sympathies in the natures of
9214,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"things, or in their popular attributes. Fancy is a sporting with their"

9268,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"identical, or used as such; and neither is the best that might be"
9269,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),found. The term Imagination is too confined: often too material. It
9270,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),presents too invariably the idea of a solid body;--of 'images' in the
9271,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sense of the plaster-cast cry about the streets. Fancy, on the other"

9291,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Fancy turns her sister's wizard instruments into toys. She takes a
9292,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"telescope in her hand, and puts a mimic star on her forehead, and"
9293,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sallies forth as an emblem of astronomy. Her tendency is to the
9294,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"child-like and sportive. She chases butterflies, while her sister"
9295,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"takes flight with angels. She is the genius of fairies, of"
9296,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"gallantries, of fashions; of whatever is quaint and light, showy and"
9297,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),capricious; of the poetical part of wit. She adds wings and feelings
9298,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),to the images of wit; and delights as much to people nature with
9299,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"smiling ideal sympathies, as wit does to bring antipathies together,"
9300,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and make them strike light on absurdity. Fancy, however, is not"
9301,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),incapable of sympathy with Imagination. She is often found in her
9302,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"company; always, in the case of the greatest poets; often in that of"
9303,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"less, though with them she is the greater favourite. Spenser has great"
9304,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination and fancy too, but more of the latter; Milton both also,"
9305,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the very greatest, but with imagination predominant; Chaucer, the"
9306,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"strongest imagination of real life, beyond any writers but Homer,"
9307,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Dante, and Shakespeare, and in comic painting inferior to none; Pope"

9361,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Suckling, in his _Ballad on a Wedding_, has given some of the most"
9362,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),playful and charming specimens in the language. They glance like
9363,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"twinkles of the eye, or cherries bedewed:"
9364,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9365,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Her feet beneath her petticoat,"
9366,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Like little mice stole in and out,"
9367,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),As if they fear'd the light:_

9369,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_No sun upon an Easter day_

9374,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the heavens, so she, in the blaze of her beauty, on earth. This is"
9375,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),imagination fairly displacing fancy. The following has enchanted
9376,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),everybody:
9377,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9378,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Her lips were red, _and one was thin_"
9379,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Compared with that was next her chin,"
9380,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Some bee had stung it newly._
9381,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9382,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Every reader has stolen a kiss at that lip, gay or grave."
9383,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9384,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),With regard to the principle of Variety in Uniformity by which verse
9385,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"ought to be modulated, and oneness of impression diversely produced,"
9386,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it has been contended by some, that Poetry need not be written in"
9387,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"verse at all; that prose is as good a medium, provided poetry be"
9388,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),conveyed through it; and that to think otherwise is to confound letter
9389,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with spirit, or form with essence. But the opinion is a prosaical"
9390,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"mistake. Fitness and unfitness for _song_, or metrical excitement,"
9391,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),just make all the difference between a poetical and prosaical subject;
9392,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and the reason why verse is necessary to the form of poetry, is, that"
9393,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the perfection of poetical spirit demands it;--that the circle of its
9394,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"enthusiasm, beauty and power, is incomplete without it. I do not mean"
9395,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to say that a poet can never show himself a poet in prose; but that,"
9396,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"being one, his desire and necessity will be to write in verse; and"
9397,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"that, if he were unable to do so, he would not, and could not, deserve"
9398,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),his title. Verse to the true poet is no clog. It is idly called a
9399,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),trammel and a difficulty. It is a help. It springs from the same
9400,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"enthusiasm as the rest of his impulses, and is necessary to their"
9401,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),satisfaction and effect. Verse is no more a clog than the condition of
9402,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"rushing upward is a clog to fire, or than the roundness and order of"
9403,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the globe we live on is a clog to the freedom and variety that abound
9404,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"within its sphere. Verse is no dominator over the poet, except"
9405,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"inasmuch as the bond is reciprocal, and the poet dominates over the"
9406,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"verse. They are lovers, playfully challenging each other's rule, and"
9407,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),delighted equally to rule and to obey. Verse is the final proof to the
9408,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),poet that his mastery over his art is complete. It is the shutting up
9409,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of his powers in '_measureful_ content'; the answer of form to his
9410,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),spirit; of strength and ease to his guidance. It is the willing
9411,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"action, the proud and fiery happiness, of the winged steed on whose"
9412,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"back he has vaulted,"
9413,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9414,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To witch the world with wondrous horsemanship.
9415,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9416,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Verse, in short, is that finishing, and rounding, and 'tuneful"
9417,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"planetting' of the poet's creations, which is produced of necessity by"
9418,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the smooth tendencies of their energy or inward working, and the"
9419,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),harmonious dance into which they are attracted round the orb of the
9420,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beautiful. Poetry, in its complete sympathy with beauty, must, of"
9421,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"necessity, leave no sense of the beautiful, and no power over its"
9422,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"forms, unmanifested; and verse flows as inevitably from this condition"
9423,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of its integrity, as other laws of proportion do from any other kind"
9424,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of embodiment of beauty (say that of the human figure), however free"
9425,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and various the movements may be that play within their limits. What
9426,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),great poet ever wrote his poems in prose? or where is a good prose
9427,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poem, of any length, to be found? The poetry of the Bible is"
9428,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"understood to be in verse, in the original. Mr. Hazlitt has said a"
9429,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"good word for those prose enlargements of some fine old song, which"
9430,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),are known by the name of Ossian; and in passages they deserve what he
9431,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),said; but he judiciously abstained from saying anything about the
9432,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),form. Is Gesner's _Death of Abel_ a poem? or Hervey's _Meditations_?
9433,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The _Pilgrim's Progress_ has been called one; and, undoubtedly, Bunyan"
9434,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"had a genius which tended to make him a poet, and one of no mean"
9435,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),order: and yet it was of as ungenerous and low a sort as was
9436,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),compatible with so lofty an affinity; and this is the reason why it
9437,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"stopped where it did. He had a craving after the beautiful, but not"
9438,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"enough of it in himself to echo to its music. On the other hand, the"
9439,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),possession of the beautiful will not be sufficient without force to
9440,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),utter it. The author of _Telemachus_ had a soul full of beauty and
9441,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"tenderness. He was not a man who, if he had had a wife and children,"
9442,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"would have run away from them, as Bunyan's hero did, to get a place by"
9443,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"himself in heaven. He was 'a little lower than the angels', like our"
9444,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),own Bishop Jewells and Berkeleys; and yet he was no poet. He was too
9445,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"delicately, not to say feebly, absorbed in his devotions, to join in"
9446,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the energies of the seraphic choir.
9447,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9448,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Every poet, then, is a versifier; every fine poet an excellent one;"
9449,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and he is the best whose verse exhibits the greatest amount of
9450,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"strength, sweetness, straightforwardness, unsuperfluousness,"
9451,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_variety_, and _oneness_;--oneness, that is to say, consistency, in"
9452,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the general impression, metrical and moral; and variety, or every"
9453,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"pertinent diversity of tone and rhythm, in the process. _Strength_ is"
9454,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the muscle of verse, and shows itself in the number and force of the"
9455,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"marked syllables; as,"

9507,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9508,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),[30] Pray let not the reader consent to read this first half
9509,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of the line in any manner less marked and peremptory. It is a
9510,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),striking instance of the beauty of that 'acceleration and
9511,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),retardation of true verse' which Coleridge speaks of. There
9512,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is to be a hurry on the words _as the_, and a passionate"
9513,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),emphasis and passing stop on the word _god_; and so of the
9514,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),next three words.
9515,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9516,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The abuse of strength is harshness and heaviness; the reverse of it is
9517,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),weakness. There is a noble sentiment--it appears both in Daniel's and
9518,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Sir John Beaumont's works, but is most probably the latter's,--which"
9519,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),is a perfect outrage of strength in the sound of the words:
9520,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9521,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Only the firmest and the _constant'st_ hearts
9522,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),God sets to act the _stout'st_ and hardest parts.
9523,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9524,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Stout'st_ and _constant'st_ for 'stoutest' and 'most constant'! It is
9525,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),as bad as the intentional crabbedness of the line in _Hudibras_:
9526,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9527,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"He that hangs or _beats out's_ brains,"
9528,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The devil's in him if _he_ feigns.
9529,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9530,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Beats out's brains_, for 'beats out his brains'. Of heaviness,"
9531,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Davenant's _Gondibert_ is a formidable specimen, almost throughout:"
9532,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),

9542,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And so he goes digging and lumbering on, like a heavy preacher"
9543,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"thumping the pulpit in italics, and spoiling many ingenious"
9544,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),reflections.
9545,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9546,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Weakness in versification is want of accent and emphasis. It generally
9547,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"accompanies prosaicalness, and is the consequence of weak thoughts,"
9548,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and of the affectation of a certain well-bred enthusiasm. The writings
9549,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of the late Mr. Hayley were remarkable for it; and it abounds among
9550,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the lyrical imitators of Cowley, and the whole of what is called our"
9551,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"French school of poetry, when it aspired above its wit and 'sense'. It"
9552,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sometimes breaks down in a horrible, hopeless manner, as if giving way"
9553,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"at the first step. The following ludicrous passage in Congreve,"
9554,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"intended to be particularly fine, contains an instance:"
9555,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9556,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And lo! Silence himself is here;
9557,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Methinks I see the midnight god appear.
9558,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"In all his downy pomp array'd,"
9559,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Behold the reverend shade.
9560,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_An ancient sigh he sits upon!!!_
9561,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Whose memory of sound is long since gone,"
9562,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_And purposely annihilated for his throne!!!_
9563,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9564,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Ode on the singing of Mrs. Arabella Hunt._
9565,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9566,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),See also the would-be enthusiasm of Addison about music:
9567,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),

9571,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And all of heaven we have below,"
9572,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Music can noble HINTS _impart!!!_
9573,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9574,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),It is observable that the unpoetic masters of ridicule are apt to make
9575,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the most ridiculous mistakes, when they come to affect a strain higher"
9576,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),than the one they are accustomed to. But no wonder. Their habits
9577,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),neutralize the enthusiasm it requires.
9578,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9579,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Sweetness_, though not identical with smoothness, any more than"
9580,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"feeling is with sound, always includes it; and smoothness is a thing"
9581,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"so little to be regarded for its own sake, and indeed so worthless in"
9582,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poetry but for some taste of sweetness, that I have not thought"
9583,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),necessary to mention it by itself; though such an all-in-all in
9584,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"versification was it regarded not a hundred years back, that Thomas"
9585,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Warton himself, an idolater of Spenser, ventured to wish the following"
9586,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"line in the _Faerie Queene_,"
9587,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9588,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And was admirèd much of fools, _wòmen_, and boys--"
9589,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9590,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),altered to
9591,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9592,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And was admirèd much of women, fools, and boys--"
9593,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9594,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),thus destroying the fine scornful emphasis on the first syllable of
9595,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'women'! (an ungallant intimation, by the way, against the fair sex,"
9596,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),very startling in this no less woman-loving than great poet). Any
9597,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poetaster can be smooth. Smoothness abounds in all small poets, as"
9598,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sweetness does in the greater. Sweetness is the smoothness of grace
9599,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and delicacy,--of the sympathy with the pleasing and lovely. Spenser"
9600,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is full of it,--Shakespeare--Beaumont and Fletcher--Coleridge. Of"
9601,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Spenser's and Coleridge's versification it is the prevailing
9602,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),characteristic. Its main secrets are a smooth progression between
9603,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"variety and sameness, and a voluptuous sense of the continuous,--'linked"
9604,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sweetness long drawn out'. Observe the first and last lines of the
9605,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"stanza in the _Faerie Queene_, describing a shepherd brushing away the"
9606,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"gnats;--the open and the close _e's_ in the one,"

9615,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So in his description of two substances in the handling, both equally"
9616,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),smooth:

9620,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),An abundance of examples from his poetry will be found in the volume
9621,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),before us. His beauty revolves on itself with conscious loveliness.
9622,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And Coleridge is worthy to be named with him, as the reader will see"
9623,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"also, and has seen already. Let him take a sample meanwhile from the"
9624,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),poem called the _Day Dream_! Observe both the variety and sameness of
9625,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the vowels, and the repetition of the soft consonants:"
9626,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9627,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),My eyes make pictures when they're shut:--
9628,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"I see a fountain, large and fair,"
9629,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"A willow and a ruin'd hut,"
9630,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And _thee_ and _me_ and Mary there.
9631,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_O Mary! make thy gentle lap our pillow;
9632,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Bend o'er us, like a bower, my beautiful green willow._"
9633,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9634,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"By _Straightforwardness_ is meant the flow of words, in their natural"
9635,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"order, free alike from mere prose, and from those inversions to which"
9636,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"bad poets recur in order to escape the charge of prose, but chiefly to"
9637,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"accommodate their rhymes. In Shadwell's play of _Psyche_, Venus gives"
9638,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the sisters of the heroine an answer, of which the following is the"
9639,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_entire_ substance, literally, in so many words. The author had"
9640,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),nothing better for her to say:
9641,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9642,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"I receive your prayers with kindness, and will give success"
9643,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to your hopes. I have seen, with anger, mankind adore your"
9644,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sister's beauty and deplore her scorn: which they shall do
9645,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"no more. For I'll so resent their idolatry, as shall content"
9646,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),your wishes to the full.
9647,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9648,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Now in default of all imagination, fancy, and expression, how was the"
9649,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),writer to turn these words into poetry or rhyme? Simply by diverting
9650,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"them from their natural order, and twisting the halves of the"
9651,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sentences each before the other.
9652,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9653,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"With kindness I your prayers receive,"
9654,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And to your hopes success will give.
9655,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"I have, with anger, seen mankind adore"
9656,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Your sister's beauty and her scorn deplore;
9657,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Which they shall do no more.
9658,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For their idolatry I'll so resent,"
9659,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),As shall your wishes to the full content!!
9660,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9661,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),This is just as if a man were to allow that there was no poetry in the
9662,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"words, 'How do you find yourself?' 'Very well, I thank you'; but to"
9663,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"hold them inspired, if altered into"
9664,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9665,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Yourself how do you find?
9666,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Very well, you I thank."
9667,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9668,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It is true, the best writers in Shadwell's age were addicted to these"
9669,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"inversions, partly for their own reasons, as far as rhyme was"
9670,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"concerned, and partly because they held it to be writing in the"
9671,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),classical and Virgilian manner. What has since been called Artificial
9672,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Poetry was then flourishing, in contradistinction to Natural; or"
9673,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Poetry seen chiefly through art and books, and not in its first"
9674,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sources. But when the artificial poet partook of the natural, or, in"
9675,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"other words, was a true poet after his kind, his best was always"
9676,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),written in his most natural and straightforward manner. Hear
9677,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Shadwell's antagonist Dryden. Not a particle of inversion, beyond what"
9678,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is used for the sake of emphasis in common discourse, and this only in"
9679,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"one line (the last but three), is to be found in his immortal"
9680,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),character of the Duke of Buckingham:
9681,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9682,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"A man so various, that he seemed to be"
9683,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Not one, but all mankind's epitome:"
9684,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Stiff in opinions, _always in the wrong_,"
9685,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Was everything by starts, and nothing long;_"
9686,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),But in the course of one revolving moon
9687,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:"
9688,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Then all for women, rhyming, dancing, drinking,"
9689,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking._
9690,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Blest madman!_ who could every hour employ
9691,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_With something new to wish or to enjoy!_
9692,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Railing and praising were his usual themes;
9693,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"And both, to show his judgement, in extremes:"
9694,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"So over violent, or over civil,"
9695,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_That every man with him was god or devil._
9696,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),In squandering wealth was his peculiar art;
9697,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Nothing went unrewarded, but desert._"
9698,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late,"
9699,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_He had his jest, and they had his estate._"
9700,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9701,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Inversion itself was often turned into a grace in these poets, and may"
9702,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be in others, by the power of being superior to it; using it only with"
9703,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"a classical air, and as a help lying next to them, instead of a"
9704,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),salvation which they are obliged to seek. In jesting passages also it
9705,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sometimes gave the rhyme a turn agreeably wilful, or an appearance of"
9706,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),choosing what lay in its way; as if a man should pick up a stone to
9707,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"throw at another's head, where a less confident foot would have"
9708,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),stumbled over it. Such is Dryden's use of the word _might_--the mere
9709,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sign of a tense--in his pretended ridicule of the monkish practice of
9710,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),rising to sing psalms in the night.
9711,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9712,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And much they griev'd to see so nigh their hall
9713,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The bird that warn'd St. Peter of his fall;
9714,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"That he should raise his mitred crest on high,"
9715,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And clap his wings and call his family
9716,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To sacred rites; and vex th' ethereal powers
9717,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),With midnight matins at uncivil hours;
9718,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Nay more, his quiet neighbours should molest"
9719,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Just in the sweetness of their morning rest._
9720,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9721,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),(What a line full of 'another doze' is that!)
9722,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9723,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Beast of a bird!_ supinely, when he _might_"
9724,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Lie snug and sleep, to rise before the light!"
9725,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),What if his dull forefathers used that cry?
9726,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Could he not let a bad example die?
9727,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9728,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"I the more gladly quote instances like those of Dryden, to illustrate"
9729,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the points in question, because they are specimens of the very highest"
9730,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),kind of writing in the heroic couplet upon subjects not heroical. As
9731,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to prosaicalness in general, it is sometimes indulged in by young"
9732,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),writers on the plea of its being natural; but this is a mere
9733,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"confusion of triviality with propriety, and is usually the result of"
9734,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),indolence.
9735,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9736,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_Unsuperfluousness_ is rather a matter of style in general, than of"
9737,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the sound and order of words: and yet versification is so much
9738,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"strengthened by it, and so much weakened by its opposite, that it"
9739,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),could not but come within the category of its requisites. When
9740,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),superfluousness of words is not occasioned by overflowing animal
9741,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"spirits, as in Beaumont and Fletcher, or by the very genius of luxury,"
9742,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as in Spenser (in which cases it is enrichment as well as overflow),"
9743,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"there is no worse sign for a poet altogether, except pure barrenness."
9744,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Every word that could be taken away from a poem, unreferable to either"
9745,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of the above reasons for it, is a damage; and many such are death; for"
9746,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),there is nothing that posterity seems so determined to resent as this
9747,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),want of respect for its time and trouble. The world is too rich in
9748,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),books to endure it. Even true poets have died of this Writer's Evil.
9749,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Trifling ones have survived, with scarcely any pretensions but the"
9750,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),terseness of their trifles. What hope can remain for wordy mediocrity?
9751,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Let the discerning reader take up any poem, pen in hand, for the"
9752,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),purpose of discovering how many words he can strike out of it that
9753,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"give him no requisite ideas, no relevant ones that he cares for, and"
9754,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"no reasons for the rhyme beyond its necessity, and he will see what"
9755,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),blot and havoc he will make in many an admired production of its
9756,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"day,--what marks of its inevitable fate. Bulky authors in particular,"
9757,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"however safe they may think themselves, would do well to consider what"
9758,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),parts of their cargo they might dispense with in their proposed voyage
9759,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"down the gulfs of time; for many a gallant vessel, thought"
9760,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"indestructible in its age, has perished;--many a load of words,"
9761,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"expected to be in eternal demand, gone to join the wrecks of"
9762,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"self-love, or rotted in the warehouses of change and vicissitude. I"
9763,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"have said the more on this point, because in an age when the true"
9764,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),inspiration has undoubtedly been reawakened by Coleridge and his
9765,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"fellows, and we have so many new poets coming forward, it may be as"
9766,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),well to give a general warning against that tendency to an
9767,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"accumulation and ostentation of _thoughts_, which is meant to be a"
9768,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"refutation in full of the pretensions of all poetry less cogitabund,"
9769,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),whatever may be the requirements of its class. Young writers should
9770,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"bear in mind, that even some of the very best materials for poetry are"
9771,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not poetry built; and that the smallest marble shrine, of exquisite"
9772,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"workmanship, outvalues all that architect ever chipped away. Whatever"
9773,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),can be so dispensed with is rubbish.
9774,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9775,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_Variety_ in versification consists in whatsoever can be done for the
9776,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"prevention of monotony, by diversity of stops and cadences,"
9777,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"distribution of emphasis, and retardation and acceleration of time;"
9778,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"for the whole real secret of versification is a musical secret, and is"
9779,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not attainable to any vital effect, save by the ear of genius. All the"
9780,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"mere knowledge of feet and numbers, of accent and quantity, will no"
9781,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"more impart it, than a knowledge of the 'Guide to Music' will make a"
9782,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Beethoven or a Paisiello. It is a matter of sensibility and
9783,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagination; of the beautiful in poetical passion, accompanied by"
9784,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"musical; of the imperative necessity for a pause here, and a cadence"
9785,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"there, and a quicker or slower utterance in this or that place,"
9786,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"created by analogies of sound with sense, by the fluctuations of"
9787,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"feeling, by the demands of the gods and graces that visit the poet's"
9788,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"harp, as the winds visit that of Aeolus. The same time and quantity"
9789,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"which are occasioned by the spiritual part of this secret, thus become"
9790,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"its formal ones,--not feet and syllables, long and short, iambics or"
9791,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),trochees; which are the reduction of it to its _less_ than dry bones.
9792,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"You might get, for instance, not only ten and eleven, but thirteen or"
9793,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"fourteen syllables into a rhyming, as well as blank, heroical verse,"
9794,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),if time and the feeling permitted; and in irregular measure this is
9795,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),often done; just as musicians put twenty notes in a bar instead of
9796,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"two, quavers instead of minims, according as the feeling they are"
9797,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),expressing impels them to fill up the time with short and hurried
9798,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"notes, or with long; or as the choristers in a cathedral retard or"
9799,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"precipitate the words of the chant, according as the quantity of its"
9800,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"notes, and the colon which divides the verse of the psalm, conspire to"
9801,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),demand it. Had the moderns borne this principle in mind when they
9802,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"settled the prevailing systems of verse, instead of learning them, as"
9803,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"they appear to have done, from the first drawling and one-syllabled"
9804,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"notation of the church hymns, we should have retained all the"
9805,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"advantages of the more numerous versification of the ancients, without"
9806,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),being compelled to fancy that there was no alternative for us between
9807,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),our syllabical uniformity and the hexameters or other special forms
9808,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"unsuited to our tongues. But to leave this question alone, we will"
9809,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),present the reader with a few sufficing specimens of the difference
9810,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"between monotony and variety in versification, first from Pope,"
9811,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Dryden, and Milton, and next from Gay and Coleridge. The following is"
9812,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the boasted melody of the nevertheless exquisite poet of the _Rape of
9813,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the Lock_,--exquisite in his wit and fancy, though not in his numbers."
9814,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The reader will observe that it is literally _see-saw_, like the"
9815,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"rising and falling of a plank, with a light person at one end who is"
9816,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"jerked up in the briefer time, and a heavier one who is set down more"
9817,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),leisurely at the other. It is in the otherwise charming description of
9818,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the heroine of that poem:
9819,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9820,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"On her white breast--a sparkling cross she wore,"
9821,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Which Jews might kiss--and infidels adore;
9822,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Her lively looks--a sprightly mind disclose,"
9823,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Quick as her eyes--and as unfix'd as those;
9824,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Favours to none--to all she smiles extends,"
9825,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Oft she rejects--but never once offends;
9826,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Bright as the sun--her eyes the gazers strike,"
9827,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And like the sun--they shine on all alike;
9828,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Yet graceful ease--and sweetness void of pride,"
9829,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Might hide her faults--if belles had faults to hide;
9830,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"If to her share--some female errors fall,"
9831,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Look on her face--and you'll forget them all.
9832,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9833,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Compare with this the description of Iphigenia in one of Dryden's
9834,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),stories from Boccaccio:
9835,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9836,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It happen'd--on a summer's holiday,                        }"
9837,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"That to the greenwood shade--he took his way,              }"
9838,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),For Cymon shunn'd the church--and used not much to pray.   }
9839,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"His quarter-staff--which he could ne'er forsake,"
9840,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Hung half before--and half behind his back;
9841,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"He trudg'd along--not knowing what he sought,"
9842,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And whistled as he went--for want of thought.
9843,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9844,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"By chance conducted--or by thirst constrain'd,"
9845,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The deep recesses of a grove he gain'd:--
9846,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Where--in a plain defended by a wood,              }"
9847,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Crept through the matted grass--a crystal flood,   }"
9848,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),By which--an alabaster fountain stood;             }
9849,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And on the margent of the fount was laid--
9850,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Attended by her slaves--a sleeping maid;
9851,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Like Dian and her nymphs--when, tir'd with sport,"
9852,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To rest by cool Eurotas they resort.--
9853,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"The dame herself--the goddess well express'd,"
9854,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Not more distinguished by her purple vest--
9855,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Than by the charming features of the face--
9856,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),And e'en in slumber--a superior grace:
9857,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Her comely limbs--compos'd with decent care,    }"
9858,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Her body shaded--by a light cymar,              }"
9859,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Her bosom to the view--was only bare;           }
9860,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Where two beginning paps were scarcely spied--
9861,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),For yet their places were but signified.--
9862,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The fanning wind upon her bosom blows--                      }
9863,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),To meet the fanning wind--the bosom rose;                    }
9864,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The fanning wind--and purling stream--continue her repose.   }
9865,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9866,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"For a further variety take, from the same author's _Theodore and"
9867,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Honoria_, a passage in which the couplets are run one into the other,"
9868,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and all of it modulated, like the former, according to the feeling"
9869,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),demanded by the occasion:
9870,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9871,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Whilst listening to the murmuring leaves he stood--
9872,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),More than a mile immers'd within the wood--
9873,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),At once the wind was laid.|--The whispering sound
9874,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Was dumb.|--A rising earthquake rock'd the ground.
9875,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),With deeper brown the grove was overspread--         }
9876,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),A sudden horror seiz'd his giddy head--              }

9909,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),verse in it which is not varied and harmonized in the most remarkable
9910,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),manner. Let him notice in particular that curious balancing of the
9911,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),lines in the sixth and tenth verses:
9912,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9913,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_In_ with the river sunk, &c."

9919,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It might, indeed, be objected to the versification of Milton, that it"
9920,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),exhibits too constant a perfection of this kind. It sometimes forces
9921,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),upon us too great a sense of consciousness on the part of the
9922,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"composer. We miss the first sprightly runnings of verse,--the ease and"
9923,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sweetness of spontaneity. Milton, I think, also too often condenses"
9924,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),weight into heaviness.
9925,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9926,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Thus much concerning the chief of our two most popular measures. The
9927,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"other, called octo-syllabic, or the measure of eight syllables,"
9928,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"offered such facilities for _namby-pamby_, that it had become a jest"
9929,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as early as the time of Shakespeare, who makes Touchstone call it the"
9930,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'butterwoman's rate to market', and the 'very false gallop of verses'."
9931,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"It has been advocated, in opposition to the heroic measure, upon the"
9932,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),ground that ten syllables lead a man into epithets and other
9933,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"superfluities, while eight syllables compress him into a sensible and"
9934,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),pithy gentleman. But the heroic measure laughs at it. So far from
9935,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"compressing, it converts one line into two, and sacrifices everything"
9936,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to the quick and importunate return of the rhyme. With Dryden, compare"

9961,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Virtue resides on earth no more!
9962,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
9963,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Coleridge saw the mistake which had been made with regard to this
9964,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"measure, and restored it to the beautiful freedom of which it was"
9965,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"capable, by calling to mind the liberties allowed its old musical"
9966,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"professors the minstrels, and dividing it by _time_ instead of"
9967,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),_syllables_;--by the _beat of four_ into which you might get as many
9968,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"syllables as you could, instead of allotting eight syllables to the"
9969,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poor time, whatever it might have to say. He varied it further with"
9970,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"alternate rhymes and stanzas, with rests and omissions precisely"
9971,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"analogous to those in music, and rendered it altogether worthy to"
9972,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),utter the manifold thoughts and feelings of himself and his lady
9973,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Christabel. He even ventures, with an exquisite sense of solemn"
9974,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"strangeness and licence (for there is witchcraft going forward), to"
9975,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"introduce a couplet of blank verse, itself as mystically and"

10061,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),The principle of Variety in Uniformity is here worked out in a style
10062,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),'beyond the reach of art'. Everything is diversified according to the
10063,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"demand of the moment, of the sounds, the sights, the emotions; the"
10064,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),very uniformity of the outline is gently varied; and yet we feel that
10065,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"_the whole is one and of the same character_, the single and sweet"
10066,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),unconsciousness of the heroine making all the rest seem more
10067,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"conscious, and ghastly, and expectant. It is thus that _versification"
10068,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"itself becomes part of the sentiment of a poem_, and vindicates the"
10069,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),pains that have been taken to show its importance. I know of no very
10070,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),fine versification unaccompanied with fine poetry; no poetry of a mean
10071,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),order accompanied with verse of the highest.

10073,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"As to Rhyme, which might be thought too insignificant to mention, it"
10074,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"is not at all so. The universal consent of modern Europe, and of the"
10075,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"East in all ages, has made it one of the musical beauties of verse for"
10076,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"all poetry but epic and dramatic, and even for the former with"
10077,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Southern Europe,--a sustainment for the enthusiasm, and a demand to"
10078,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),enjoy. The mastery of it consists in never writing it for its own
10079,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sake, or at least never appearing to do so; in knowing how to vary"
10080,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it, to give it novelty, to render it more or less strong, to divide"
10081,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it (when not in couplets) at the proper intervals, to repeat it many"
10082,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),times where luxury or animal spirits demand it (see an instance in
10083,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Titania's speech to the Fairies), to impress an affecting or startling"

10164,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"on? the answer is, the only and twofold way: first, the perusal of the"
10165,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"best poets with the greatest attention; and, second, the cultivation"
10166,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of that love of truth and beauty which made them what they are. Every
10167,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),true reader of poetry partakes a more than ordinary portion of the
10168,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poetic nature; and no one can be completely such, who does not love,"
10169,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"or take an interest in, everything that interests the poet, from the"
10170,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"firmament to the daisy,--from the highest heart of man to the most"
10171,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"pitiable of the low. It is a good practice to read with pen in hand,"
10172,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"marking what is liked or doubted. It rivets the attention, realizes"
10173,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the greatest amount of enjoyment, and facilitates reference. It"
10174,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"enables the reader also, from time to time, to see what progress he"
10175,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"makes with his own mind, and how it grows up towards the stature of"
10176,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),its exalter.
10177,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10178,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"If the same person should ask, What class of poetry is the highest? I"
10179,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"should say, undoubtedly, the Epic; for it includes the drama, with"
10180,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"narration besides; or the speaking and action of the characters, with"
10181,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"the speaking of the poet himself, whose utmost address is taxed to"
10182,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"relate all well for so long a time, particularly in the passages least"
10183,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sustained by enthusiasm. Whether this class has included the greatest
10184,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"poet, is another question still under trial; for Shakespeare perplexes"
10185,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"all such verdicts, even when the claimant is Homer; though, if a"
10186,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"judgement may be drawn from his early narratives (_Venus and Adonis_,"
10187,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and the _Rape of Lucrece_), it is to be doubted whether even"
10188,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Shakespeare could have told a story like Homer, owing to that"
10189,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"incessant activity and superfoetation of thought, a little less of"
10190,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),which might be occasionally desired even in his plays;--if it were
10191,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"possible, once possessing anything of his, to wish it away. Next to"
10192,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Homer and Shakespeare come such narrators as the less universal, but"
10193,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"still intenser Dante; Milton, with his dignified imagination; the"
10194,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"universal, profoundly simple Chaucer; and luxuriant, remote"
10195,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Spenser--immortal child in poetry's most poetic solitudes: then the
10196,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),great second-rate dramatists; unless those who are better acquainted
10197,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with Greek tragedy than I am, demand a place for them before Chaucer:"
10198,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"then the airy yet robust universality of Ariosto; the hearty,"
10199,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"out-of-door nature of Theocritus, also a universalist; the finest"
10200,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"lyrical poets (who only take short flights, compared with the"
10201,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),narrators); the purely contemplative poets who have more thought than
10202,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"feeling; the descriptive, satirical, didactic, epigrammatic. It is to"
10203,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"be borne in mind, however, that the first poet of an inferior class"
10204,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"may be superior to followers in the train of a higher one, though the"
10205,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),superiority is by no means to be taken for granted; otherwise Pope
10206,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"would be superior to Fletcher, and Butler to Pope. Imagination,"
10207,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"teeming with action and character, makes the greatest poets; feeling"
10208,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and thought the next; fancy (by itself) the next; wit the last.
10209,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Thought by itself makes no poet at all; for the mere conclusions of
10210,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the understanding can at best be only so many intellectual matters of
10211,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"fact. Feeling, even destitute of conscious thought, stands a far"
10212,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),better poetical chance; feeling being a sort of thought without the
10213,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"process of thinking,--a grasper of the truth without seeing it. And"
10214,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"what is very remarkable, feeling seldom makes the blunders that"
10215,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),thought does. An idle distinction has been made between taste and
10216,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),judgement. Taste is the very maker of judgement. Put an artificial
10217,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"fruit in your mouth, or only handle it, and you will soon perceive the"
10218,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"difference between judging from taste or tact, and judging from the"
10219,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),abstract figment called judgement. The latter does but throw you into
10220,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),guesses and doubts. Hence the conceits that astonish us in the
10221,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"gravest, and even subtlest, thinkers, whose taste is not proportionate"
10222,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to their mental perceptions; men like Donne, for instance; who, apart"
10223,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"from accidental personal impressions, seem to look at nothing as it"
10224,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"really is, but only as to what may be thought of it. Hence, on the"
10225,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"other hand, the delightfulness of those poets who never violate truth"
10226,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of feeling, whether in things real or imaginary; who are always"
10227,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),consistent with their object and its requirements; and who run the
10228,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"great round of nature, not to perplex and be perplexed, but to make"
10229,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"themselves and us happy. And luckily, delightfulness is not"
10230,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"incompatible with greatness, willing soever as men may be in their"
10231,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),present imperfect state to set the power to subjugate above the power
10232,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to please. Truth, of any great kind whatsoever, makes great writing."
10233,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"This is the reason why such poets as Ariosto, though not writing with"
10234,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"a constant detail of thought and feeling like Dante, are justly"
10235,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),considered great as well as delightful. Their greatness proves itself
10236,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"by the same truth of nature, and sustained power, though in a"
10237,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),different way. Their action is not so crowded and weighty; their
10238,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sphere has more territories less fertile; but it has enchantments of
10239,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"its own, which excess of thought would spoil,--luxuries, laughing"
10240,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"graces, animal spirits; and not to recognize the beauty and greatness"
10241,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of these, treated as they treat them, is simply to be defective in"
10242,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sympathy. Every planet is not Mars or Saturn. There is also Venus and
10243,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Mercury. There is one genius of the south, and another of the north,"
10244,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and others uniting both. The reader who is too thoughtless or too
10245,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"sensitive to like intensity of any sort, and he who is too thoughtful"
10246,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),or too dull to like anything but the greatest possible stimulus of
10247,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"reflection or passion, are equally wanting in complexional fitness"
10248,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),for a thorough enjoyment of books. Ariosto occasionally says as fine
10249,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"things as Dante, and Spenser as Shakespeare; but the business of both"
10250,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),is to enjoy; and in order to partake their enjoyment to its full
10251,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"extent, you must feel what poetry is in the general as well as the"
10252,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"particular, must be aware that there are different songs of the"
10253,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"spheres, some fuller of notes, and others of a sustained delight; and"
10254,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as the former keep you perpetually alive to thought or passion, so"
10255,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),from the latter you receive a constant harmonious sense of truth and
10256,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beauty, more agreeable perhaps on the whole, though less exciting."
10257,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Ariosto, for instance, does not _tell a story_ with the brevity and"
10258,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),concentrated passion of Dante; every sentence is not so full of
10259,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"matter, nor the style so removed from the indifference of prose; yet"
10260,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"you are charmed with a truth of another sort, equally characteristic"
10261,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of the writer, equally drawn from nature and substituting a healthy"
10262,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),sense of enjoyment for intenser emotion. Exclusiveness of liking for
10263,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"this or that mode of truth, only shows, either that a reader's"
10264,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"perceptions are limited, or that he would sacrifice truth itself to"
10265,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"his favourite form of it. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was as trenchant"
10266,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with his pen as his sword, hailed the _Faerie Queene_ of his friend"
10267,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Spenser in verses in which he said that 'Petrarch' was thenceforward
10268,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"to be no more heard of; and that in all English poetry, there was"
10269,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),nothing he counted 'of any price' but the effusions of the new author.
10270,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Yet Petrarch is still living; Chaucer was not abolished by Sir Walter;
10271,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and Shakespeare is thought somewhat valuable. A botanist might as well
10272,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"have said, that myrtles and oaks were to disappear, because acacias"
10273,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"had come up. It is with the poet's creations, as with nature's, great"
10274,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"or small. Wherever truth and beauty, whatever their amount, can be"
10275,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"worthily shaped into verse, and answer to some demand for it in our"
10276,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"hearts, there poetry is to be found; whether in productions grand and"
10277,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beautiful as some great event, or some mighty, leafy solitude, or no"
10278,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),bigger and more pretending than a sweet face or a bunch of violets;
10279,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"whether in Homer's epic or Gray's _Elegy_, in the enchanted gardens of"
10280,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Ariosto and Spenser, or the very pot-herbs of the _Schoolmistress_ of"
10281,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Shenstone, the balms of the simplicity of a cottage. Not to know and"
10282,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"feel this, is to be deficient in the universality of Nature herself,"
10283,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"who is a poetess on the smallest as well as the largest scale, and who"
10284,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),calls upon us to admire all her productions; not indeed with the same
10285,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"degree of admiration, but with no refusal of it, except to defect."
10286,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10287,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),I cannot draw this essay towards its conclusion better than with three
10288,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"memorable words of Milton; who has said, that poetry, in comparison"
10289,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with science, is 'simple, sensuous, and passionate'. By simple, he"
10290,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"means unperplexed and self-evident; by sensuous, genial and full of"
10291,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"imagery; by passionate, excited and enthusiastic. I am aware that"
10292,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),different constructions have been put on some of these words; but the
10293,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"context seems to me to necessitate those before us. I quote, however,"
10294,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not from the original, but from an extract in the _Remarks on Paradise"
10295,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Lost_ by Richardson.
10296,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10297,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),What the poet has to cultivate above all things is love and
10298,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"truth;--what he has to avoid, like poison, is the fleeting and the"
10299,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),false. He will get no good by proposing to be 'in earnest at the
10300,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"moment'. His earnestness must be innate and habitual; born with him,"
10301,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and felt to be his most precious inheritance. 'I expect neither
10302,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"profit nor general fame by my writings,' says Coleridge, in the"
10303,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),Preface to his Poems; 'and I consider myself as having been amply
10304,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"repaid without either. Poetry has been to me its ""_own exceeding great"
10305,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"reward_""; it has soothed my afflictions; it has multiplied and refined"
10306,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude; and it has given me the habit
10307,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),of wishing to discover the good and the beautiful in all that meets
10308,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and surrounds me.'
10309,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10310,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'Poetry', says Shelley, 'lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the"
10311,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"world, _and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar_."
10312,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),It reproduces all that it represents; and the impersonations clothed
10313,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in the minds of those who
10314,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"have once contemplated them, as memorials of that gentle and exalted"
10315,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),content which extends itself over all thoughts and actions with which
10316,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"it co-exists. The great secret of morals is love, or a going out of"
10317,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful"
10318,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man, to be"
10319,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put"
10320,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"himself in the place of another, and of many others: the pains and"
10321,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument of
10322,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),moral good is imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by
10323,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),acting upon the cause.'
10324,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10325,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),I would not willingly say anything after perorations like these; but
10326,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),as treatises on poetry may chance to have auditors who think
10327,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),themselves called upon to vindicate the superiority of what is termed
10328,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"useful knowledge, it may be as well to add, that if the poet may be"
10329,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"allowed to pique himself on any one thing more than another, compared"
10330,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with those who undervalue him, it is on that power of undervaluing"
10331,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"nobody, and no attainments different from his own, which is given him"
10332,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),by the very faculty of imagination they despise. The greater includes
10333,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the less. They do not see that their inability to comprehend him
10334,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),argues the smaller capacity. No man recognizes the worth of utility
10335,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),more than the poet: he only desires that the meaning of the term may
10336,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"not come short of its greatness, and exclude the noblest necessities"
10337,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"of his fellow-creatures. He is quite as much pleased, for instance,"
10338,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"with the facilities for rapid conveyance afforded him by the railroad,"
10339,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"as the dullest confiner of its advantages to that single idea, or as"
10340,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),the greatest two-idea'd man who varies that single idea with hugging
10341,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),himself on his 'buttons' or his good dinner. But he sees also the
10342,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"beauty of the country through which he passes, of the towns, of the"
10343,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"heavens, of the steam-engine itself, thundering and fuming along like"
10344,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"a magic horse, of the affections that are carrying, perhaps, half the"
10345,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"passengers on their journey, nay, of those of the great two-idea'd"
10346,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"man; and, beyond all this, he discerns the incalculable amount of"
10347,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"good, and knowledge, and refinement, and mutual consideration, which"
10348,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"this wonderful invention is fitted to circulate over the globe,"
10349,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"perhaps to the displacement of war itself, and certainly to the"
10350,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),diffusion of millions of enjoyments.
10351,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10352,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"'And a button-maker, after all, invented it!' cries our friend."
10353,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),
10354,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"Pardon me--it was a nobleman. A button-maker may be a very excellent,"
10355,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"and a very poetical man too, and yet not have been the first man"
10356,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),visited by a sense of the gigantic powers of the combination of water
10357,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),and fire. It was a nobleman who first thought of this most poetical
10358,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),bit of science. It was a nobleman who first thought of it--a captain
10359,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),who first tried it--and a button-maker who perfected it. And he who
10360,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"put the nobleman on such thoughts was the great philosopher, Bacon,"
10361,WHAT IS POETRY? (1844),"who said that poetry had 'something divine in it', and was necessary"

10386,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,intended to delineate the feelings of one of the last of the Greek
10387,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"religious philosophers, one of the family of Orpheus and Musaeus,"
10388,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"having survived his fellows, living on into a time when the habits of"
10389,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Greek thought and feeling had begun fast to change, character to"

10391,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,of a man so situated there entered much that we are accustomed to
10392,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"consider as exclusively modern; how much, the fragments of Empedocles"
10393,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,himself which remain to us are sufficient at least to indicate. What
10394,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,those who are familiar only with the great monuments of early Greek
10395,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"genius suppose to be its exclusive characteristics, have disappeared;"
10396,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the calm, the cheerfulness, the disinterested objectivity have"
10397,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,disappeared: the dialogue of the mind with itself has commenced;
10398,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"modern problems have presented themselves; we hear already the doubts,"
10399,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"we witness the discouragement, of Hamlet and of Faust."
10400,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10401,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"The representation of such a man's feelings must be interesting, if"
10402,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"consistently drawn. We all naturally take pleasure, says Aristotle, in"
10403,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,any imitation or representation whatever: this is the basis of our
10404,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"love of Poetry: and we take pleasure in them, he adds, because all"

10409,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_not_ interesting, is that which does not add to our knowledge of any"

10413,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10414,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,Any accurate representation may therefore be expected to be

10417,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,also that it shall inspirit and rejoice the reader: that it shall
10418,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"convey a charm, and infuse delight. For the Muses, as Hesiod says,"

10420,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,from cares'; and it is not enough that the Poet should add to the
10421,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"knowledge of men, it is required of him also that he should add to"
10422,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their happiness. 'All Art', says Schiller, 'is dedicated to Joy, and"
10423,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"there is no higher and no more serious problem, than how to make men"
10424,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"happy. The right Art is that alone, which creates the highest"
10425,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,enjoyment.'
10426,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10427,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"A poetical work, therefore, is not yet justified when it has been"
10428,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"shown to be an accurate, and therefore interesting, representation; it"
10429,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,has to be shown also that it is a representation from which men can
10430,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"derive enjoyment. In presence of the most tragic circumstances,"
10431,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"represented in a work of Art, the feeling of enjoyment, as is well"
10432,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"known, may still subsist: the representation of the most utter"
10433,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"calamity, of the liveliest anguish, is not sufficient to destroy it:"
10434,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the more tragic the situation, the deeper becomes the enjoyment; and"
10435,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the situation is more tragic in proportion as it becomes more
10436,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,terrible.
10437,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10438,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"What then are the situations, from the representation of which, though"
10439,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"accurate, no poetical enjoyment can be derived? They are those in"
10440,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,which the suffering finds no vent in action; in which a continuous
10441,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"state of mental distress is prolonged, unrelieved by incident, hope,"
10442,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"or resistance; in which there is everything to be endured, nothing to"
10443,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"be done. In such situations there is inevitably something morbid, in"
10444,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the description of them something monotonous. When they occur in
10445,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"actual life, they are painful, not tragic; the representation of them"
10446,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,in poetry is painful also.
10447,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10448,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"To this class of situations, poetically faulty as it appears to me,"
10449,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"that of Empedocles, as I have endeavoured to represent him, belongs;"
10450,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,and I have therefore excluded the Poem from the present collection.
10451,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10452,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"And why, it may be asked, have I entered into this explanation"
10453,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,respecting a matter so unimportant as the admission or exclusion of
10454,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the Poem in question? I have done so, because I was anxious to avow"
10455,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,that the sole reason for its exclusion was that which has been stated
10456,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,above; and that it has not been excluded in deference to the opinion
10457,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,which many critics of the present day appear to entertain against
10458,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"subjects chosen from distant times and countries: against the choice,"
10459,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in short, of any subjects but modern ones."
10460,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10461,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"'The Poet,' it is said, and by an intelligent critic, 'the Poet who"
10462,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"would really fix the public attention must leave the exhausted past,"
10463,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"and draw his subjects from matters of present import, and _therefore_"
10464,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,both of interest and novelty.'
10465,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10466,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Now this view I believe to be completely false. It is worth examining,"
10467,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,inasmuch as it is a fair sample of a class of critical dicta
10468,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"everywhere current at the present day, having a philosophical form and"
10469,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"air, but no real basis in fact; and which are calculated to vitiate"
10470,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the judgement of readers of poetry, while they exert, so far as they"
10471,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"are adopted, a misleading influence on the practice of those who write"
10472,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,it.
10473,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10474,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"What are the eternal objects of Poetry, among all nations and at all"
10475,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,times? They are actions; human actions; possessing an inherent
10476,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"interest in themselves, and which are to be communicated in an"
10477,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,interesting manner by the art of the Poet. Vainly will the latter
10478,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,imagine that he has everything in his own power; that he can make an
10479,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,intrinsically inferior action equally delightful with a more excellent
10480,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,one by his treatment of it: he may indeed compel us to admire his
10481,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"skill, but his work will possess, within itself, an incurable defect."
10482,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10483,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"The Poet, then, has in the first place to select an excellent action;"
10484,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"and what actions are the most excellent? Those, certainly, which most"
10485,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,powerfully appeal to the great primary human affections: to those
10486,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"elementary feelings which subsist permanently in the race, and which"
10487,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,are independent of time. These feelings are permanent and the same;
10488,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,that which interests them is permanent and the same also. The
10489,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"modernness or antiquity of an action, therefore, has nothing to do"
10490,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,with its fitness for poetical representation; this depends upon its
10491,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"inherent qualities. To the elementary part of our nature, to our"
10492,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"passions, that which is great and passionate is eternally interesting;"
10493,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,and interesting solely in proportion to its greatness and to its
10494,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,passion. A great human action of a thousand years ago is more
10495,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"interesting to it than a smaller human action of to-day, even though"
10496,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,upon the representation of this last the most consummate skill may
10497,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"have been expended, and though it has the advantage of appealing by"
10498,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"its modern language, familiar manners, and contemporary allusions, to"
10499,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"all our transient feelings and interests. These, however, have no"
10500,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,right to demand of a poetical work that it shall satisfy them; their
10501,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,claims are to be directed elsewhere. Poetical works belong to the
10502,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"domain of our permanent passions: let them interest these, and the"
10503,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,voice of all subordinate claims upon them is at once silenced.
10504,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10505,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Achilles, Prometheus, Clytemnestra, Dido--what modern poem presents"
10506,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"personages as interesting, even to us moderns, as these personages of"
10507,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,an 'exhausted past'? We have the domestic epic dealing with the
10508,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,details of modern life which pass daily under our eyes; we have poems
10509,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,representing modern personages in contact with the problems of modern
10510,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"life, moral, intellectual, and social; these works have been produced"
10511,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,by poets the most distinguished of their nation and time; yet I
10512,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"fearlessly assert that _Hermann and Dorothea_, _Childe Harold_,"
10513,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_Jocelyn_, _The Excursion_, leave the reader cold in comparison with"
10514,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the effect produced upon him by the latter books of the Iliad, by the"
10515,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_Orestea_, or by the episode of Dido. And why is this? Simply because"
10516,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in the three latter cases the action is greater, the personages"
10517,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"nobler, the situations more intense: and this is the true basis of the"
10518,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"interest in a poetical work, and this alone."
10519,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10520,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"It may be urged, however, that past actions may be interesting in"
10521,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"themselves, but that they are not to be adopted by the modern Poet,"
10522,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,because it is impossible for him to have them clearly present to his
10523,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"own mind, and he cannot therefore feel them deeply, nor represent them"
10524,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,forcibly. But this is not necessarily the case. The externals of a
10525,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"past action, indeed, he cannot know with the precision of a"
10526,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,contemporary; but his business is with its essentials. The outward man
10527,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of Oedipus or of Macbeth, the houses in which they lived, the"
10528,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"ceremonies of their courts, he cannot accurately figure to himself;"
10529,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,but neither do they essentially concern him. His business is with
10530,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,their inward man; with their feelings and behaviour in certain tragic
10531,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"situations, which engage their passions as men; these have in them"
10532,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,nothing local and casual; they are as accessible to the modern Poet as
10533,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,to a contemporary.
10534,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10535,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"The date of an action, then, signifies nothing: the action itself, its"
10536,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"selection and construction, this is what is all-important. This the"
10537,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,Greeks understood far more clearly than we do. The radical difference
10538,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"between their poetical theory and ours consists, as it appears to me,"
10539,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in this: that, with them, the poetical character of the action in"
10540,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"itself, and the conduct of it, was the first consideration; with us,"
10541,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,attention is fixed mainly on the value of the separate thoughts and
10542,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,images which occur in the treatment of an action. They regarded the
10543,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"whole; we regard the parts. With them, the action predominated over"
10544,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the expression of it; with us, the expression predominates over the"
10545,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"action. Not that they failed in expression, or were inattentive to it;"
10546,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"on the contrary, they are the highest models of expression, the"
10547,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,unapproached masters of the _grand style_: but their expression is so
10548,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,excellent because it is so admirably kept in its right degree of
10549,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,prominence; because it is so simple and so well subordinated; because
10550,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,it draws its force directly from the pregnancy of the matter which it
10551,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,conveys. For what reason was the Greek tragic poet confined to so
10552,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,limited a range of subjects? Because there are so few actions which
10553,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"unite in themselves, in the highest degree, the conditions of"
10554,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,excellence: and it was not thought that on any but an excellent
10555,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"subject could an excellent Poem be constructed. A few actions,"
10556,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"therefore, eminently adapted for tragedy, maintained almost exclusive"
10557,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,possession of the Greek tragic stage; their significance appeared
10558,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"inexhaustible; they were as permanent problems, perpetually offered to"
10559,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the genius of every fresh poet. This too is the reason of what appears
10560,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,to us moderns a certain baldness of expression in Greek tragedy; of
10561,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the triviality with which we often reproach the remarks of the
10562,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Chorus, where it takes part in the dialogue: that the action itself,"
10563,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the situation of Orestes, or Merope, or Alcmaeon, was to stand the"
10564,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"central point of interest, unforgotten, absorbing, principal; that no"
10565,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,accessories were for a moment to distract the spectator's attention
10566,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"from this; that the tone of the parts was to be perpetually kept down,"
10567,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,in order not to impair the grandiose effect of the whole. The terrible
10568,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"old mythic story on which the drama was founded stood, before he"
10569,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"entered the theatre, traced in its bare outlines upon the spectator's"
10570,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"mind; it stood in his memory, as a group of statuary, faintly seen, at"
10571,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the end of a long and dark vista: then came the Poet, embodying"
10572,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"outlines, developing situations, not a word wasted, not a sentiment"
10573,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"capriciously thrown in; stroke upon stroke, the drama proceeded: the"
10574,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,light deepened upon the group; more and more it revealed itself to the
10575,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"riveted gaze of the spectator: until at last, when the final words"
10576,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"were spoken, it stood before him in broad sunlight, a model of"
10577,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,immortal beauty.
10578,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10579,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,This was what a Greek critic demanded; this was what a Greek poet
10580,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,endeavoured to effect. It signified nothing to what time an action
10581,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,belonged; we do not find that the _Persae_ occupied a particularly
10582,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"high rank among the dramas of Aeschylus, because it represented a"
10583,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,matter of contemporary interest: this was not what a cultivated
10584,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,Athenian required; he required that the permanent elements of his
10585,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"nature should be moved; and dramas of which the action, though taken"
10586,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"from a long-distant mythic time, yet was calculated to accomplish this"
10587,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in a higher degree than that of the _Persae_, stood higher in his"
10588,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"estimation accordingly. The Greeks felt, no doubt, with their"
10589,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"exquisite sagacity of taste, that an action of present times was too"
10590,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"near them, too much mixed up with what was accidental and passing, to"
10591,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"form a sufficiently grand, detached, and self-subsistent object for a"
10592,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"tragic poem: such objects belonged to the domain of the comic poet,"
10593,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"and of the lighter kinds of poetry. For the more serious kinds, for"
10594,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_pragmatic_ poetry, to use an excellent expression of Polybius, they"
10595,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,were more difficult and severe in the range of subjects which they
10596,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"permitted. Their theory and practice alike, the admirable treatise of"
10597,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Aristotle, and the unrivalled works of their poets, exclaim with a"
10598,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,thousand tongues--'All depends upon the subject; choose a fitting
10599,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"action, penetrate yourself with the feeling of its situations; this"
10600,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"done, everything else will follow.'"
10601,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10602,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,But for all kinds of poetry alike there was one point on which they
10603,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,were rigidly exacting; the adaptability of the subject to the kind of
10604,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poetry selected, and the careful construction of the poem."
10605,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10606,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,How different a way of thinking from this is ours! We can hardly at
10607,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the present day understand what Menander meant, when he told a man who"
10608,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"inquired as to the progress of his comedy that he had finished it, not"
10609,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"having yet written a single line, because he had constructed the"
10610,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,action of it in his mind. A modern critic would have assured him that
10611,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the merit of his piece depended on the brilliant things which arose
10612,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,under his pen as he went along. We have poems which seem to exist
10613,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,merely for the sake of single lines and passages; not for the sake of
10614,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,producing any total impression. We have critics who seem to direct
10615,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their attention merely to detached expressions, to the language about"
10616,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the action, not to the action itself. I verily think that the"
10617,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,majority of them do not in their hearts believe that there is such a
10618,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"thing as a total-impression to be derived from a poem at all, or to be"
10619,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,demanded from a poet; they think the term a commonplace of
10620,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,metaphysical criticism. They will permit the Poet to select any action
10621,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"he pleases, and to suffer that action to go as it will, provided he"
10622,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"gratifies them with occasional bursts of fine writing, and with a"
10623,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"shower of isolated thoughts and images. That is, they permit him to"
10624,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"leave their poetical sense ungratified, provided that he gratifies"
10625,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,their rhetorical sense and their curiosity. Of his neglecting to
10626,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"gratify these, there is little danger; he needs rather to be warned"
10627,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,against the danger of attempting to gratify these alone; he needs
10628,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,rather to be perpetually reminded to prefer his action to everything
10629,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"else; so to treat this, as to permit its inherent excellences to"
10630,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"develop themselves, without interruption from the intrusion of his"
10631,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,personal peculiarities: most fortunate when he most entirely succeeds
10632,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in effacing himself, and in enabling a noble action to subsist as it"
10633,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,did in nature.
10634,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10635,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,But the modern critic not only permits a false practice; he absolutely
10636,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,prescribes false aims.--'A true allegory of the state of one's own
10637,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"mind in a representative history,' the Poet is told, 'is perhaps the"
10638,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,highest thing that one can attempt in the way of poetry.'--And
10639,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,accordingly he attempts it. An allegory of the state of one's own
10640,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"mind, the highest problem of an art which imitates actions! No"
10641,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"assuredly, it is not, it never can be so: no great poetical work has"
10642,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"ever been produced with such an aim. _Faust_ itself, in which"
10643,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"something of the kind is attempted, wonderful passages as it contains,"
10644,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,and in spite of the unsurpassed beauty of the scenes which relate to
10645,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Margaret, _Faust_ itself, judged as a whole, and judged strictly as a"
10646,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poetical work, is defective: its illustrious author, the greatest poet"
10647,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of modern times, the greatest critic of all times, would have been the"
10648,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"first to acknowledge it; he only defended his work, indeed, by"
10649,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,asserting it to be 'something incommensurable'.
10650,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10651,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"The confusion of the present times is great, the multitude of voices"
10652,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"counselling different things bewildering, the number of existing works"
10653,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,capable of attracting a young writer's attention and of becoming his
10654,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"models, immense: what he wants is a hand to guide him through the"
10655,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"confusion, a voice to prescribe to him the aim which he should keep in"
10656,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"view, and to explain to him that the value of the literary works which"
10657,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,offer themselves to his attention is relative to their power of
10658,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,helping him forward on his road towards this aim. Such a guide the
10659,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"English writer at the present day will nowhere find. Failing this, all"
10660,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"that can be looked for, all indeed that can be desired, is, that his"
10661,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"attention should be fixed on excellent models; that he may reproduce,"
10662,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"at any rate, something of their excellence, by penetrating himself"
10663,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"with their works and by catching their spirit, if he cannot be taught"
10664,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,to produce what is excellent independently.
10665,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10666,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,Foremost among these models for the English writer stands Shakespeare:
10667,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,a name the greatest perhaps of all poetical names; a name never to be
10668,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"mentioned without reverence. I will venture, however, to express a"
10669,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"doubt, whether the influence of his works, excellent and fruitful for"
10670,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the readers of poetry, for the great majority, has been of unmixed"
10671,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,advantage to the writers of it. Shakespeare indeed chose excellent
10672,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"subjects; the world could afford no better than Macbeth, or Romeo and"
10673,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Juliet, or Othello: he had no theory respecting the necessity of"
10674,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"choosing subjects of present import, or the paramount interest"
10675,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,attaching to allegories of the state of one's own mind; like all great
10676,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poets, he knew well what constituted a poetical action; like them,"
10677,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"wherever he found such an action, he took it; like them, too, he found"
10678,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,his best in past times. But to these general characteristics of all
10679,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"great poets, he added a special one of his own; a gift, namely, of"
10680,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"happy, abundant, and ingenious expression, eminent and unrivalled: so"
10681,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"eminent as irresistibly to strike the attention first in him, and even"
10682,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,to throw into comparative shade his other excellences as a poet. Here
10683,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,has been the mischief. These other excellences were his fundamental
10684,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,excellences _as a poet_; what distinguishes the artist from the mere
10685,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"amateur, says Goethe, is _Architectonicè_ in the highest sense; that"
10686,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"power of execution, which creates, forms, and constitutes: not the"
10687,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"profoundness of single thoughts, not the richness of imagery, not the"
10688,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,abundance of illustration. But these attractive accessories of a
10689,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poetical work being more easily seized than the spirit of the whole,"
10690,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,and these accessories being possessed by Shakespeare in an unequalled
10691,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"degree, a young writer having recourse to Shakespeare as his model"
10692,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"runs great risk of being vanquished and absorbed by them, and, in"
10693,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"consequence, of reproducing, according to the measure of his power,"
10694,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"these, and these alone. Of this preponderating quality of"
10695,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Shakespeare's genius, accordingly, almost the whole of modern English"
10696,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poetry has, it appears to me, felt the influence. To the exclusive"
10697,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,attention on the part of his imitators to this it is in a great degree
10698,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"owing, that of the majority of modern poetical works the details"
10699,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"alone are valuable, the composition worthless. In reading them one is"
10700,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,perpetually reminded of that terrible sentence on a modern French
10701,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poet--_il dit tout ce qu'il veut, mais malheureusement il n'a rien à"
10702,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,dire_.
10703,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10704,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,Let me give an instance of what I mean. I will take it from the works
10705,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,of the very chief among those who seem to have been formed in the
10706,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,school of Shakespeare: of one whose exquisite genius and pathetic
10707,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,death render him for ever interesting. I will take the poem of
10708,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_Isabella, or the Pot of Basil_, by Keats. I choose this rather than"
10709,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the _Endymion_, because the latter work (which a modern critic has"
10710,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"classed with the _Faerie Queene_!), although undoubtedly there blows"
10711,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"through it the breath of genius, is yet as a whole so utterly"
10712,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"incoherent, as not strictly to merit the name of a poem at all. The"
10713,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poem of _Isabella_, then, is a perfect treasure-house of graceful and"
10714,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,felicitous words and images: almost in every stanza there occurs one
10715,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of those vivid and picturesque turns of expression, by which the"
10716,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"object is made to flash upon the eye of the mind, and which thrill the"
10717,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"reader with a sudden delight. This one short poem contains, perhaps, a"
10718,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,greater number of happy single expressions which one could quote than
10719,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"all the extant tragedies of Sophocles. But the action, the story? The"
10720,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,action in itself is an excellent one; but so feebly is it conceived by
10721,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the Poet, so loosely constructed, that the effect produced by it, in"
10722,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"and for itself, is absolutely null. Let the reader, after he has"
10723,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"finished the poem of Keats, turn to the same story in the _Decameron_:"
10724,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,he will then feel how pregnant and interesting the same action has
10725,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"become in the hands of a great artist, who above all things"
10726,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,delineates his object; who subordinates expression to that which it is
10727,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,designed to express.
10728,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10729,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"I have said that the imitators of Shakespeare, fixing their attention"
10730,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"on his wonderful gift of expression, have directed their imitation to"
10731,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"this, neglecting his other excellences. These excellences, the"
10732,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"fundamental excellences of poetical art, Shakespeare no doubt"
10733,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,possessed them--possessed many of them in a splendid degree; but it
10734,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,may perhaps be doubted whether even he himself did not sometimes give
10735,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,scope to his faculty of expression to the prejudice of a higher
10736,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,poetical duty. For we must never forget that Shakespeare is the great
10737,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,poet he is from his skill in discerning and firmly conceiving an
10738,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"excellent action, from his power of intensely feeling a situation, of"
10739,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,intimately associating himself with a character; not from his gift of
10740,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"expression, which rather even leads him astray, degenerating sometimes"
10741,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"into a fondness for curiosity of expression, into an irritability of"
10742,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"fancy, which seems to make it impossible for him to say a thing"
10743,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"plainly, even when the press of the action demands the very directest"
10744,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"language, or its level character the very simplest. Mr. Hallam, than"
10745,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"whom it is impossible to find a saner and more judicious critic, has"
10746,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"had the courage (for at the present day it needs courage) to remark,"
10747,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,how extremely and faultily difficult Shakespeare's language often is.
10748,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"It is so: you may find main scenes in some of his greatest tragedies,"
10749,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"_King Lear_ for instance, where the language is so artificial, so"
10750,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"curiously tortured, and so difficult, that every speech has to be read"
10751,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,two or three times before its meaning can be comprehended. This
10752,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,overcuriousness of expression is indeed but the excessive employment
10753,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,of a wonderful gift--of the power of saying a thing in a happier way
10754,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"than any other man; nevertheless, it is carried so far that one"
10755,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"understands what M. Guizot meant, when he said that Shakespeare"
10756,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,appears in his language to have tried all styles except that of
10757,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,simplicity. He has not the severe and scrupulous self-restraint of the
10758,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"ancients, partly, no doubt, because he had a far less cultivated and"
10759,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"exacting audience: he has indeed a far wider range than they had, a"
10760,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,far richer fertility of thought; in this respect he rises above them:
10761,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in his strong conception of his subject, in the genuine way in which"
10762,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"he is penetrated with it, he resembles them, and is unlike the"
10763,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"moderns: but in the accurate limitation of it, the conscientious"
10764,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"rejection of superfluities, the simple and rigorous development of it"
10765,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"from the first line of his work to the last, he falls below them, and"
10766,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"comes nearer to the moderns. In his chief works, besides what he has"
10767,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of his own, he has the elementary soundness of the ancients; he has"
10768,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,their important action and their large and broad manner: but he has
10769,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,not their purity of method. He is therefore a less safe model; for
10770,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"what he has of his own is personal, and inseparable from his own rich"
10771,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"nature; it may be imitated and exaggerated, it cannot be learned or"
10772,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"applied as an art; he is above all suggestive; more valuable,"
10773,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"therefore, to young writers as men than as artists. But clearness of"
10774,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"arrangement, rigour of development, simplicity of style--these may to"
10775,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"a certain extent be learned: and these may, I am convinced, be learned"
10776,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"best from the ancients, who, although infinitely less suggestive than"
10777,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Shakespeare, are thus, to the artist, more instructive."
10778,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10779,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"What then, it will be asked, are the ancients to be our sole models?"
10780,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the ancients with their comparatively narrow range of experience, and"
10781,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their widely different circumstances? Not, certainly, that which is"
10782,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"narrow in the ancients, nor that in which we can no longer sympathize."
10783,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"An action like the action of the _Antigone_ of Sophocles, which turns"
10784,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,upon the conflict between the heroine's duty to her brother's corpse
10785,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"and that to the laws of her country, is no longer one in which it is"
10786,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"possible that we should feel a deep interest. I am speaking too, it"
10787,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"will be remembered, not of the best sources of intellectual stimulus"
10788,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"for the general reader, but of the best models of instruction for the"
10789,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"individual writer. This last may certainly learn of the ancients,"
10790,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"better than anywhere else, three things which it is vitally important"
10791,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,for him to know:--the all-importance of the choice of a subject; the
10792,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,necessity of accurate construction; and the subordinate character of
10793,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,expression. He will learn from them how unspeakably superior is the
10794,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,effect of the one moral impression left by a great action treated as a
10795,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"whole, to the effect produced by the most striking single thought or"
10796,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,by the happiest image. As he penetrates into the spirit of the great
10797,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"classical works, as he becomes gradually aware of their intense"
10798,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"significance, their noble simplicity, and their calm pathos, he will"
10799,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"be convinced that it is this effect, unity and profoundness of moral"
10800,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"impression, at which the ancient Poets aimed; that it is this which"
10801,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"constitutes the grandeur of their works, and which makes them"
10802,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,immortal. He will desire to direct his own efforts towards producing
10803,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the same effect. Above all, he will deliver himself from the jargon of"
10804,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"modern criticism, and escape the danger of producing poetical works"
10805,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"conceived in the spirit of the passing time, and which partake of its"
10806,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,transitoriness.
10807,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10808,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"The present age makes great claims upon us: we owe it service, it will"
10809,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"not be satisfied without our admiration. I know not how it is, but"
10810,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their commerce with the ancients appears to me to produce, in those"
10811,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"who constantly practise it, a steadying and composing effect upon"
10812,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their judgement, not of literary works only, but of men and events in"
10813,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,general. They are like persons who have had a very weighty and
10814,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,impressive experience; they are more truly than others under the
10815,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"empire of facts, and more independent of the language current among"
10816,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,those with whom they live. They wish neither to applaud nor to revile
10817,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"their age: they wish to know what it is, what it can give them, and"
10818,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"whether this is what they want. What they want, they know very well;"
10819,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,they want to educe and cultivate what is best and noblest in
10820,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"themselves: they know, too, that this is no easy task--[Greek:"
10821,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"chalepon], as Pittacus said, [Greek: chalepon esthlon emmenai]--and"
10822,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,they ask themselves sincerely whether their age and its literature can
10823,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,assist them in the attempt. If they are endeavouring to practise any
10824,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"art, they remember the plain and simple proceedings of the old"
10825,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"artists, who attained their grand results by penetrating themselves"
10826,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"with some noble and significant action, not by inflating themselves"
10827,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,with a belief in the pre-eminent importance and greatness of their own
10828,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"times. They do not talk of their mission, nor of interpreting their"
10829,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"age, nor of the coming Poet; all this, they know, is the mere delirium"
10830,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of vanity; their business is not to praise their age, but to afford to"
10831,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,the men who live in it the highest pleasure which they are capable of
10832,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,feeling. If asked to afford this by means of subjects drawn from the
10833,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"age itself, they ask what special fitness the present age has for"
10834,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"supplying them: they are told that it is an era of progress, an age"
10835,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,commissioned to carry out the great ideas of industrial development
10836,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,and social amelioration. They reply that with all this they can do
10837,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,nothing; that the elements they need for the exercise of their art are
10838,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"great actions, calculated powerfully and delightfully to affect what"
10839,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,is permanent in the human soul; that so far as the present age can
10840,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"supply such actions, they will gladly make use of them; but that an"
10841,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"age wanting in moral grandeur can with difficulty supply such, and an"
10842,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,age of spiritual discomfort with difficulty be powerfully and
10843,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,delightfully affected by them.
10844,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10845,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,A host of voices will indignantly rejoin that the present age is
10846,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,inferior to the past neither in moral grandeur nor in spiritual
10847,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,health. He who possesses the discipline I speak of will content
10848,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"himself with remembering the judgements passed upon the present age,"
10849,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"in this respect, by the two men, the one of strongest head, the other"
10850,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"of widest culture, whom it has produced; by Goethe and by Niebuhr. It"
10851,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,will be sufficient for him that he knows the opinions held by these
10852,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,two great men respecting the present age and its literature; and that
10853,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,he feels assured in his own mind that their aims and demands upon life
10854,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"were such as he would wish, at any rate, his own to be; and their"
10855,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,judgement as to what is impeding and disabling such as he may safely
10856,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"follow. He will not, however, maintain a hostile attitude towards the"
10857,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,false pretensions of his age; he will content himself with not being
10858,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,overwhelmed by them. He will esteem himself fortunate if he can
10859,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"succeed in banishing from his mind all feelings of contradiction, and"
10860,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"irritation, and impatience; in order to delight himself with the"
10861,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"contemplation of some noble action of a heroic time, and to enable"
10862,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"others, through his representation of it, to delight in it also."
10863,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10864,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"I am far indeed from making any claim, for myself, that I possess this"
10865,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"discipline; or for the following Poems, that they breathe its spirit."
10866,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"But I say, that in the sincere endeavour to learn and practise, amid"
10867,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the bewildering confusion of our times, what is sound and true in"
10868,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"poetical art, I seemed to myself to find the only sure guidance, the"
10869,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"only solid footing, among the ancients. They, at any rate, knew what"
10870,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"they wanted in Art, and we do not. It is this uncertainty which is"
10871,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"disheartening, and not hostile criticism. How often have I felt this"
10872,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,when reading words of disparagement or of cavil: that it is the
10873,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,uncertainty as to what is really to be aimed at which makes our
10874,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"difficulty, not the dissatisfaction of the critic, who himself suffers"
10875,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,from the same uncertainty. _Non me tua fervida terrent Dicta; Dii me
10876,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"terrent, et Jupiter hostis._"
10877,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,
10878,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"Two kinds of _dilettanti_, says Goethe, there are in poetry: he who"
10879,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"neglects the indispensable mechanical part, and thinks he has done"
10880,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,enough if he shows spirituality and feeling; and he who seeks to
10881,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"arrive at poetry merely by mechanism, in which he can acquire an"
10882,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"artisan's readiness, and is without soul and matter. And he adds, that"
10883,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"the first does most harm to Art, and the last to himself. If we must"
10884,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"be _dilettanti_: if it is impossible for us, under the circumstances"
10885,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"amidst which we live, to think clearly, to feel nobly, and to"
10886,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,delineate firmly: if we cannot attain to the mastery of the great
10887,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"artists--let us, at least, have so much respect for our Art as to"
10888,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,prefer it to ourselves: let us not bewilder our successors: let us
10889,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"transmit to them the practice of Poetry, with its boundaries and"
10890,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"wholesome regulative laws, under which excellent works may again,"
10891,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"perhaps, at some future time, be produced, not yet fallen into"
10892,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"oblivion through our neglect, not yet condemned and cancelled by the"
10893,THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS IN POETRY,"influence of their eternal enemy, Caprice."

10899,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
10900,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,I have allowed the Preface to the former edition of these Poems to
10901,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"stand almost without change, because I still believe it to be, in the"
10902,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"main, true. I must not, however, be supposed insensible to the force"
10903,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of much that has been alleged against portions of it, or unaware that"
10904,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"it contains many things incompletely stated, many things which need"

10906,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"what manner, the opinions there expressed respecting the choice of"
10907,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,subjects apply to lyric poetry; that region of the poetical field
10908,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,which is chiefly cultivated at present. But neither have I time now to
10909,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"supply these deficiencies, nor is this the proper place for attempting"
10910,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"it: on one or two points alone I wish to offer, in the briefest"
10911,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"possible way, some explanation."
10912,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
10913,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"An objection has been ably urged to the classing together, as subjects"
10914,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"equally belonging to a past time, Oedipus and Macbeth. And it is no"
10915,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"doubt true that to Shakespeare, standing on the verge of the Middle"
10916,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Ages, the epoch of Macbeth was more familiar than that of Oedipus. But"
10917,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,I was speaking of actions as they presented themselves to us moderns:
10918,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and it will hardly be said that the European mind, since Voltaire, has"
10919,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,much more affinity with the times of Macbeth than with those of
10920,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Oedipus. As moderns, it seems to me, we have no longer any direct"
10921,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,affinity with the circumstances and feelings of either; as
10922,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"individuals, we are attracted towards this or that personage, we have"
10923,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"a capacity for imagining him, irrespective of his times, solely"
10924,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,according to a law of personal sympathy; and those subjects for which
10925,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"we feel this personal attraction most strongly, we may hope to treat"
10926,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"successfully. Alcestis or Joan of Arc, Charlemagne or Agamemnon--one"
10927,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,of these is not really nearer to us now than another; each can be made
10928,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,present only by an act of poetic imagination: but this man's
10929,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"imagination has an affinity for one of them, and that man's for"
10930,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,another.
10931,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
10932,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"It has been said that I wish to limit the Poet, in his choice of"
10933,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,subjects to the period of Greek and Roman antiquity: but it is not so:
10934,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"I only counsel him to choose for his subjects great actions, without"
10935,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,regarding to what time they belong. Nor do I deny that the poetic
10936,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,faculty can and does manifest itself in treating the most trifling
10937,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"action, the most hopeless subject. But it is a pity that power should"
10938,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,be wasted; and that the Poet should be compelled to impart interest
10939,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and force to his subject, instead of receiving them from it, and"
10940,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"thereby doubling his impressiveness. There is, it has been excellently"
10941,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"said, an immortal strength in the stories of great actions: the most"
10942,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"gifted poet, then, may well be glad to supplement with it that mortal"
10943,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"weakness, which, in presence of the vast spectacle of life and the"

10945,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,
10946,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Again, with respect to the study of the classical writers of"

10981,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The word 'Blue', say certain philosophers, means the sensation of"
10982,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"colour which the human eye receives in looking at the open sky, or at"
10983,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,a bell gentian.
10984,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
10985,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Now, say they farther, as this sensation can only be felt when the eye"
10986,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"is turned to the object, and as, therefore, no such sensation is"
10987,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"produced by the object when nobody looks at it, therefore the thing,"
10988,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"when it is not looked at, is not blue; and thus (say they) there are"
10989,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,many qualities of things which depend as much on something else as on
10990,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"themselves. To be sweet, a thing must have a taster; it is only sweet"
10991,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"while it is being tasted, and if the tongue had not the capacity of"
10992,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"taste, then the sugar would not have the quality of sweetness."
10993,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
10994,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,And then they agree that the qualities of things which thus depend
10995,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"upon our perception of them, and upon our human nature as affected by"
10996,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"them, shall be called Subjective; and the qualities of things which"
10997,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"they always have, irrespective of any other nature, as roundness or"
10998,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"squareness, shall be called Objective."
10999,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11000,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"From these ingenious views the step is very easy to a farther opinion,"
11001,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"that it does not much matter what things are in themselves, but only"
11002,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,what they are to us; and that the only real truth of them is their
11003,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"appearance to, or effect upon, us. From which position, with a hearty"
11004,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"desire for mystification, and much egotism, selfishness, shallowness,"
11005,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"and impertinence, a philosopher may easily go so far as to believe,"
11006,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"and say, that everything in the world depends upon his seeing or"
11007,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"thinking of it, and that nothing, therefore, exists, but what he sees"
11008,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,or thinks of.
11009,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11010,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 2. Now, to get rid of all these ambiguities and troublesome words at"
11011,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"once, be it observed that the word 'Blue' does _not_ mean the"
11012,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,_sensation_ caused by a gentian on the human eye; but it means the
11013,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"_power_ of producing that sensation; and this power is always there,"
11014,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"in the thing, whether we are there to experience it or not, and would"
11015,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,remain there though there were not left a man on the face of the
11016,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,earth. Precisely in the same way gunpowder has a power of exploding.
11017,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,It will not explode if you put no match to it. But it has always the
11018,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"power of so exploding, and is therefore called an explosive compound,"
11019,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"which it very positively and assuredly is, whatever philosophy may say"
11020,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,to the contrary.
11021,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11022,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"In like manner, a gentian does not produce the sensation of blueness"
11023,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,if you don't look at it. But it has always the power of doing so; its
11024,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"particles being everlastingly so arranged by its Maker. And,"
11025,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"therefore, the gentian and the sky are always verily blue, whatever"
11026,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,philosophy may say to the contrary; and if you do not see them blue
11027,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"when you look at them, it is not their fault but yours."
11028,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11029,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 3. Hence I would say to these philosophers: If, instead of using the"
11030,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"sonorous phrase, 'It is objectively so,' you will use the plain old"
11031,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"phrase, 'It _is_ so;' and if instead of the sonorous phrase, 'It is"
11032,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"subjectively so,' you will say, in plain old English, 'It does so,' or"
11033,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'It seems so to me;' you will, on the whole, be more intelligible to"
11034,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"your fellow-creatures: and besides, if you find that a thing which"
11035,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,generally 'does so' to other people (as a gentian looks blue to most
11036,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"men), does _not_ so to you, on any particular occasion, you will not"
11037,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"fall into the impertinence of saying, that the thing is not so, or did"
11038,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"not so, but you will say simply (what you will be all the better for"
11039,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"speedily finding out), that something is the matter with you. If you"
11040,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"find that you cannot explode the gunpowder, you will not declare that"
11041,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"all gunpowder is subjective, and all explosion imaginary, but you will"
11042,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"simply suspect and declare yourself to be an ill-made match. Which, on"
11043,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the whole, though there may be a distant chance of a mistake about it,"
11044,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"is, nevertheless, the wisest conclusion you can come to until farther"
11045,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,experiment.
11046,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11047,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 4. Now, therefore, putting these tiresome and absurd words quite out"
11048,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"of our way, we may go on at our ease to examine the point in"
11049,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"question--namely, the difference between the ordinary, proper, and"
11050,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"true appearances of things to us; and the extraordinary, or false"
11051,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"appearances, when we are under the influence of emotion, or"
11052,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"contemplative fancy; false appearances, I say, as being entirely"
11053,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"unconnected with any real power or character in the object, and only"
11054,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,imputed to it by us.
11055,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11056,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,For instance--
11057,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11058,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The spendthrift crocus, bursting through the mould"
11059,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Naked and shivering, with his cup of gold."
11060,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11061,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"This is very beautiful, and yet very untrue. The crocus is not a"
11062,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"spendthrift, but a hardy plant; its yellow is not gold, but saffron."
11063,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,How is it that we enjoy so much the having it put into our heads that
11064,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,it is anything else than a plain crocus?
11065,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11066,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"It is an important question. For, throughout our past reasonings about"
11067,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"art, we have always found that nothing could be good, or useful, or"
11068,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"ultimately pleasurable, which was untrue. But here is something"
11069,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,pleasurable in written poetry which is nevertheless _un_true. And what
11070,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"is more, if we think over our favourite poetry, we shall find it full"
11071,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"of this kind of fallacy, and that we like it all the more for being"
11072,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,so.
11073,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11074,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 5. It will appear also, on consideration of the matter, that this"
11075,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"fallacy is of two principal kinds. Either, as in this case of the"
11076,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"crocus, it is the fallacy of wilful fancy, which involves no real"
11077,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,expectation that it will be believed; or else it is a fallacy caused
11078,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"by an excited state of the feelings, making us, for the time, more or"
11079,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,less irrational. Of the cheating of the fancy we shall have to speak
11080,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"presently; but, in this chapter, I want to examine the nature of the"
11081,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"other error, that which the mind admits when affected strongly by"
11082,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"emotion. Thus, for instance, in Alton Locke--"
11083,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11084,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,They rowed her in across the rolling foam--
11085,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The cruel, crawling foam."
11086,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11087,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl. The state of mind which"
11088,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which
11089,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,the reason is unhinged by grief. All violent feelings have the same
11090,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,effect. They produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of
11091,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"external things, which I would generally characterize as the 'Pathetic"
11092,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Fallacy'.
11093,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11094,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 6. Now we are in the habit of considering this fallacy as eminently
11095,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"a character of poetical description, and the temper of mind in which"
11096,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"we allow it as one eminently poetical, because passionate. But, I"
11097,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"believe, if we look well into the matter, that we shall find the"
11098,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,greatest poets do not often admit this kind of falseness--that it is
11099,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,only the second order of poets who much delight in it.[31]
11100,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11101,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"[31] I admit two orders of poets, but no third; and by these"
11102,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"two orders I mean the Creative (Shakespeare, Homer, Dante),"
11103,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"and Reflective or Perceptive (Wordsworth, Keats, Tennyson)."
11104,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"But both of these must be _first_-rate in their range, though"
11105,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,their range is different; and with poetry second-rate in
11106,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,_quality_ no one ought to be allowed to trouble mankind.
11107,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"There is quite enough of the best,--much more than we can"
11108,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,ever read or enjoy in the length of a life; and it is a
11109,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,literal wrong or sin in any person to encumber us with
11110,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,inferior work. I have no patience with apologies made by
11111,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"young pseudo-poets, 'that they believe there is _some_ good"
11112,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,in what they have written: that they hope to do better in
11113,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"time,' &c. _Some_ good! If there is not _all_ good, there is"
11114,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"no good. If they ever hope to do better, why do they trouble"
11115,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"us now? Let them rather courageously burn all they have done,"
11116,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"and wait for the better days. There are few men, ordinarily"
11117,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"educated, who in moments of strong feeling could not strike"
11118,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"out a poetical thought, and afterwards polish it so as to be"
11119,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,presentable. But men of sense know better than so to waste
11120,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"their time; and those who sincerely love poetry, know the"
11121,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,touch of the master's hand on the chords too well to fumble
11122,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"among them after him. Nay, more than this; all inferior"
11123,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"poetry is an injury to the good, inasmuch as it takes away"
11124,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the freshness of rhymes, blunders upon and gives a wretched"
11125,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"commonalty to good thoughts; and, in general, adds to the"
11126,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,weight of human weariness in a most woful and culpable
11127,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,manner. There are few thoughts likely to come across ordinary
11128,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"men, which have not already been expressed by greater men in"
11129,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the best possible way; and it is a wiser, more generous, more"
11130,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"noble thing to remember and point out the perfect words, than"
11131,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"to invent poorer ones, wherewith to encumber temporarily the"
11132,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,world.
11133,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11134,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Thus, when Dante describes the spirits falling from the bank of"
11135,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Acheron 'as dead leaves flutter from a bough', he gives the most"
11136,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"perfect image possible of their utter lightness, feebleness,"
11137,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"passiveness, and scattering agony of despair, without, however, for an"
11138,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"instant losing his own clear perception that _these_ are souls, and"
11139,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,_those_ are leaves; he makes no confusion of one with the other. But
11140,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,when Coleridge speaks of
11141,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11142,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,"
11143,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"That dances as often as dance it can,"
11144,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11145,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"he has a morbid, that is to say, a so far false, idea about the leaf:"
11146,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"he fancies a life in it, and will, which there are not; confuses its"
11147,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"powerlessness with choice, its fading death with merriment, and the"
11148,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"wind that shakes it with music. Here, however, there is some beauty,"
11149,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,even in the morbid passage; but take an instance in Homer and Pope.
11150,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Without the knowledge of Ulysses, Elpenor, his youngest follower, has"
11151,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"fallen from an upper chamber in the Circean palace, and has been left"
11152,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"dead, unmissed by his leader, or companions, in the haste of their"
11153,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,departure. They cross the sea to the Cimmerian land; and Ulysses
11154,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,summons the shades from Tartarus. The first which appears is that of
11155,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the lost Elpenor. Ulysses, amazed, and in exactly the spirit of bitter"
11156,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"and terrified lightness which is seen in Hamlet,[32] addresses the"
11157,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"spirit with the simple, startled words:--"
11158,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11159,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Elpenor! How camest thou under the shadowy darkness? Hast
11160,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,thou come faster on foot than I in my black ship?
11161,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11162,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"[32] 'Well said, old mole! can'st work i' the ground so"
11163,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,fast?'
11164,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11165,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Which Pope renders thus:--
11166,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11167,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"O, say, what angry power Elpenor led"
11168,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"To glide in shades, and wander with the dead?"
11169,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoined,"
11170,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Outfly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind?"
11171,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11172,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"I sincerely hope the reader finds no pleasure here, either in the"
11173,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"nimbleness of the sail, or the laziness of the wind! And yet how is it"
11174,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"that these conceits are so painful now, when they have been pleasant"
11175,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,to us in the other instances?
11176,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11177,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 7. For a very simple reason. They are not a _pathetic_ fallacy at
11178,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"all, for they are put into the mouth of the wrong passion--a passion"
11179,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,which never could possibly have spoken them--agonized curiosity.
11180,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Ulysses wants to know the facts of the matter; and the very last thing
11181,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"his mind could do at the moment would be to pause, or suggest in"
11182,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"anywise what was _not_ a fact. The delay in the first three lines, and"
11183,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"conceit in the last, jar upon us instantly, like the most frightful"
11184,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,discord in music. No poet of true imaginative power could possibly
11185,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,have written the passage.[33]
11186,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11187,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,[33] It is worth while comparing the way a similar question
11188,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is put by the exquisite sincerity of Keats:--
11189,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11190,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"He wept, and his bright tears"
11191,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
11192,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Thus, with half-shut, suffused eyes, he stood;"
11193,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"While from beneath some cumb'rous boughs hard by,"
11194,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"With solemn step, an awful goddess came."
11195,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And there was purport in her looks for him,"
11196,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Which he with eager guess began to read:
11197,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Perplexed the while, melodiously he said,"
11198,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,'_How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?_'
11199,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11200,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Therefore, we see that the spirit of truth must guide us in some"
11201,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"sort, even in our enjoyment of fallacy. Coleridge's fallacy has no"
11202,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"discord in it, but Pope's has set our teeth on edge. Without farther"
11203,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"questioning, I will endeavour to state the main bearings of this"
11204,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,matter.
11205,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11206,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 8. The temperament which admits the pathetic fallacy, is, as I said"
11207,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"above, that of a mind and body in some sort too weak to deal fully"
11208,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"with what is before them or upon them; borne away, or overclouded, or"
11209,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"over-dazzled by emotion; and it is a more or less noble state,"
11210,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,according to the force of the emotion which has induced it. For it is
11211,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,no credit to a man that he is not morbid or inaccurate in his
11212,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"perceptions, when he has no strength of feeling to warp them; and it"
11213,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is in general a sign of higher capacity and stand in the ranks of
11214,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"being, that the emotions should be strong enough to vanquish, partly,"
11215,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the intellect, and make it believe what they choose. But it is still a"
11216,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"grander condition when the intellect also rises, till it is strong"
11217,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"enough to assert its rule against, or together with, the utmost"
11218,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"efforts of the passions; and the whole man stands in an iron glow,"
11219,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"white hot, perhaps, but still strong, and in no wise evaporating; even"
11220,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"if he melts, losing none of his weight."
11221,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11222,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"So, then, we have the three ranks: the man who perceives rightly,"
11223,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"because he does not feel, and to whom the primrose is very accurately"
11224,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the primrose, because he does not love it. Then, secondly, the man who"
11225,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"perceives wrongly, because he feels, and to whom the primrose is"
11226,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"anything else than a primrose: a star, or a sun, or a fairy's shield,"
11227,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"or a forsaken maiden. And then, lastly, there is the man who perceives"
11228,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"rightly in spite of his feelings, and to whom the primrose is for"
11229,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"ever nothing else than itself--a little flower, apprehended in the"
11230,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"very plain and leafy fact of it, whatever and how many soever the"
11231,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"associations and passions may be, that crowd around it. And, in"
11232,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"general, these three classes may be rated in comparative order, as the"
11233,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"men who are not poets at all, and the poets of the second order, and"
11234,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the poets of the first; only however great a man may be, there are"
11235,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"always some subjects which _ought_ to throw him off his balance; some,"
11236,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"by which his poor human capacity of thought should be conquered, and"
11237,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"brought into the inaccurate and vague state of perception, so that the"
11238,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"language of the highest inspiration becomes broken, obscure, and wild"
11239,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"in metaphor, resembling that of the weaker man, overborne by weaker"
11240,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,things.
11241,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11242,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 9. And thus, in full, there are four classes: the men who feel"
11243,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"nothing, and therefore see truly; the men who feel strongly, think"
11244,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"weakly, and see untruly (second order of poets); the men who feel"
11245,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"strongly, think strongly, and see truly (first order of poets); and"
11246,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the men who, strong as human creatures can be, are yet submitted to"
11247,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"influences stronger than they, and see in a sort untruly, because what"
11248,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,they see is inconceivably above them. This last is the usual condition
11249,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,of prophetic inspiration.
11250,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11251,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 10. I separate these classes, in order that their character may be"
11252,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,clearly understood; but of course they are united each to the other by
11253,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"imperceptible transitions, and the same mind, according to the"
11254,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"influences to which it is subjected, passes at different times into"
11255,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the various states. Still, the difference between the great and less"
11256,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"man is, on the whole, chiefly in this point of _alterability_. That is"
11257,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"to say, the one knows too much, and perceives and feels too much of"
11258,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the past and future, and of all things beside and around that which"
11259,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"immediately affects him, to be in anywise shaken by it. His mind is"
11260,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,made up; his thoughts have an accustomed current; his ways are
11261,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,steadfast; it is not this or that new sight which will at once
11262,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"unbalance him. He is tender to impression at the surface, like a rock"
11263,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,with deep moss upon it; but there is too much mass of him to be moved.
11264,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The smaller man, with the same degree of sensibility, is at once"
11265,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,carried off his feet; he wants to do something he did not want to do
11266,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,before; he views all the universe in a new light through his tears; he
11267,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"is gay or enthusiastic, melancholy or passionate, as things come and"
11268,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"go to him. Therefore the high creative poet might even be thought, to"
11269,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"a great extent, impassive (as shallow people think Dante stern),"
11270,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"receiving indeed all feelings to the full, but having a great centre"
11271,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"of reflection and knowledge in which he stands serene, and watches the"
11272,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"feeling, as it were, from far off."
11273,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11274,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Dante, in his most intense moods, has entire command of himself, and"
11275,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"can look around calmly, at all moments, for the image or the word that"
11276,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,will best tell what he sees to the upper or lower world. But Keats and
11277,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Tennyson, and the poets of the second order, are generally themselves"
11278,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"subdued by the feelings under which they write, or, at least, write as"
11279,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"choosing to be so, and therefore admit certain expressions and modes"
11280,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,of thought which are in some sort diseased or false.
11281,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11282,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 11. Now so long as we see that the _feeling_ is true, we pardon, or"
11283,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"are even pleased by, the confessed fallacy of sight which it induces:"
11284,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"we are pleased, for instance, with those lines of Kingsley's, above"
11285,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"quoted, not because they fallaciously describe foam, but because they"
11286,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,faithfully describe sorrow. But the moment the mind of the speaker
11287,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"becomes cold, that moment every such expression becomes untrue, as"
11288,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,being for ever untrue in the external facts. And there is no greater
11289,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,baseness in literature than the habit of using these metaphorical
11290,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"expressions in cold blood. An inspired writer, in full impetuosity of"
11291,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"passion, may speak wisely and truly of 'raging waves of the sea,"
11292,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,foaming out their own shame'; but it is only the basest writer who
11293,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"cannot speak of the sea without talking of 'raging waves',"
11294,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'remorseless floods', 'ravenous billows', &c.; and it is one of the"
11295,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,signs of the highest power in a writer to check all such habits of
11296,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"thought, and to keep his eyes fixed firmly on the _pure fact_, out of"
11297,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"which if any feeling comes to him or his reader, he knows it must be a"
11298,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,true one.
11299,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11300,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"To keep to the waves, I forget who it is who represents a man in"
11301,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"despair, desiring that his body may be cast into the sea,"
11302,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11303,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"_Whose changing mound, and foam that passed away,_"
11304,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Might mock the eye that questioned where I lay.
11305,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11306,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Observe, there is not a single false, or even overcharged, expression."
11307,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,'Mound' of the sea wave is perfectly simple and true; 'changing' is as
11308,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"familiar as may be; 'foam that passed away', strictly literal; and the"
11309,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,whole line descriptive of the reality with a degree of accuracy which
11310,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"I know not any other verse, in the range of poetry, that altogether"
11311,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,equals. For most people have not a distinct idea of the clumsiness and
11312,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,massiveness of a large wave. The word 'wave' is used too generally of
11313,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"ripples and breakers, and bendings in light drapery or grass: it does"
11314,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"not by itself convey a perfect image. But the word 'mound' is heavy,"
11315,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"large, dark, definite; there is no mistaking the kind of wave meant,"
11316,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,nor missing the sight of it. Then the term 'changing' has a peculiar
11317,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,force also. Most people think of waves as rising and falling. But if
11318,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"they look at the sea carefully, they will perceive that the waves do"
11319,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"not rise and fall. They change. Change both place and form, but they"
11320,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"do not fall; one wave goes on, and on, and still on; now lower, now"
11321,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"higher, now tossing its mane like a horse, now building itself"
11322,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"together like a wall, now shaking, now steady, but still the same"
11323,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"wave, till at last it seems struck by something, and changes, one"
11324,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"knows not how,--becomes another wave."
11325,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11326,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The close of the line insists on this image, and paints it still more"
11327,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"perfectly,--'foam that passed away'. Not merely melting, disappearing,"
11328,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"but passing on, out of sight, on the career of the wave. Then, having"
11329,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"put the absolute ocean fact as far as he may before our eyes, the poet"
11330,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"leaves us to feel about it as we may, and to trace for ourselves the"
11331,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"opposite fact,--the image of the green mounds that do not change, and"
11332,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,the white and written stones that do not pass away; and thence to
11333,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,follow out also the associated images of the calm life with the quiet
11334,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"grave, and the despairing life with the fading foam:"
11335,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11336,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Let no man move his bones.
11337,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11338,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"As for Samaria, her king is out off like the foam upon the water."
11339,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11340,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"But nothing of this is actually told or pointed out, and the"
11341,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"expressions, as they stand, are perfectly severe and accurate, utterly"
11342,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,uninfluenced by the firmly governed emotion of the writer. Even the
11343,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"word 'mock' is hardly an exception, as it may stand merely for"
11344,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'deceive' or 'defeat', without implying any impersonation of the"
11345,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,waves.
11346,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11347,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"§ 12. It may be well, perhaps, to give one or two more instances to"
11348,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,show the peculiar dignity possessed by all passages which thus limit
11349,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"their expression to the pure fact, and leave the hearer to gather what"
11350,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"he can from it. Here is a notable one from the Iliad. Helen, looking"
11351,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"from the Scaean gate of Troy over the Grecian host, and telling Priam"
11352,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the names of its captains, says at last:"
11353,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11354,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,I see all the other dark-eyed Greeks; but two I cannot
11355,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"see,--Castor and Pollux,--whom one mother bore with me. Have"
11356,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"they not followed from fair Lacedaemon, or have they indeed"
11357,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"come in their sea-wandering ships, but now will not enter"
11358,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"into the battle of men, fearing the shame and the scorn that"
11359,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is in Me?
11360,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11361,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Then Homer:
11362,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11363,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"So she spoke. But them, already, the life-giving earth"
11364,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"possessed, there in Lacedaemon, in the dear fatherland."
11365,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11366,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Note, here, the high poetical truth carried to the extreme. The poet"
11367,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"has to speak of the earth in sadness, but he will not let that sadness"
11368,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,affect or change his thoughts of it. No; though Castor and Pollux be
11369,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"dead, yet the earth is our mother still, fruitful, life-giving. These"
11370,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,are the facts of the thing. I see nothing else than these. Make what
11371,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,you will of them.
11372,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11373,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 13. Take another very notable instance from Casimir de la Vigne's
11374,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"terrible ballad, _La Toilette de Constance_. I must quote a few lines"
11375,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"out of it here and there, to enable the reader who has not the book by"
11376,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"him, to understand its close."
11377,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11378,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Vite, Anna, vite; au miroir"
11379,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Plus vite, Anna. L'heure s'avance,"
11380,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Et je vais au bal ce soir
11381,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Chez l'ambassadeur de France.
11382,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11383,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Y pensez-vous, ils sont fanés, ces noeuds,"
11384,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Ils sont d'hier, mon Dieu, comme tout passe!"
11385,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Que du réseau qui retient mes cheveux
11386,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Les glands d'azur retombent avec grâce.
11387,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Plus haut! Plus bas! Vous ne comprenez rien!
11388,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Que sur mon front ce saphir étincelle:
11389,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Vous me piquez, maladroite. Ah, c'est bien,"
11390,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Bien,--chère Anna! Je t'aime, je suis belle."
11391,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11392,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Celui qu'en vain je voudrais oublier
11393,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"(Anna, ma robe) il y sera, j'espere."
11394,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"(Ah, fi! profane, est-ce là mon collier?"

11401,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Vite un coup d'oeil au miroir,"
11402,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Le dernier. ----J'ai l'assurance
11403,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Qu'on va m'adorer ce soir
11404,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Chez l'ambassadeur de France.
11405,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11406,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Près du foyer, Constance s'admirait."
11407,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Dieu! sur sa robe il vole une étincelle!
11408,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Au feu! Courez! Quand l'espoir l'enivrait,"
11409,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Tout perdre ainsi! Quoi! Mourir,--et si belle!"
11410,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,L'horrible feu ronge avec volupté
11411,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Ses bras, son sein, et l'entoure, et s'élève,"
11412,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Et sans pitié dévore sa beauté,"
11413,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Ses dix-huit ans, hélas, et son doux rêve!"
11414,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11415,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Adieu, bal, plaisir, amour!"
11416,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"On disait, Pauvre Constance!"
11417,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Et on dansait, jusqu'au jour,"
11418,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Chez l'ambassadeur de France.
11419,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11420,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Yes, that is the fact of it. Right or wrong, the poet does not say."
11421,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"What you may think about it, he does not know. He has nothing to do"
11422,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,with that. There lie the ashes of the dead girl in her chamber. There
11423,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"they danced, till the morning, at the Ambassador's of France. Make"
11424,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,what you will of it.
11425,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11426,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"If the reader will look through the ballad, of which I have quoted"
11427,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"only about the third part, he will find that there is not, from"
11428,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"beginning to end of it, a single poetical (so called) expression,"
11429,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,except in one stanza. The girl speaks as simple prose as may be; there
11430,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is not a word she would not have actually used as she was dressing.
11431,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The poet stands by, impassive as a statue, recording her words just as"
11432,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"they come. At last the doom seizes her, and in the very presence of"
11433,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"death, for an instant, his own emotions conquer him. He records no"
11434,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"longer the facts only, but the facts as they seem to him. The fire"
11435,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,gnaws with _voluptuousness--without pity_. It is soon past. The fate
11436,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is fixed for ever; and he retires into his pale and crystalline
11437,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"atmosphere of truth. He closes all with the calm veracity,"
11438,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11439,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"They said, 'Poor Constance!'"
11440,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11441,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 14. Now in this there is the exact type of the consummate poetical
11442,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"temperament. For, be it clearly and constantly remembered, that the"
11443,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"greatness of a poet depends upon the two faculties, acuteness of"
11444,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"feeling, and command of it. A poet is great, first in proportion to"
11445,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the strength of his passion, and then, that strength being granted, in"
11446,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"proportion to his government of it; there being, however, always a"
11447,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,point beyond which it would be inhuman and monstrous if he pushed this
11448,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"government, and, therefore, a point at which all feverish and wild"
11449,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,fancy becomes just and true. Thus the destruction of the kingdom of
11450,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Assyria cannot be contemplated firmly by a prophet of Israel. The fact
11451,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"is too great, too wonderful. It overthrows him, dashes him into a"
11452,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"confused element of dreams. All the world is, to his stunned thought,"
11453,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"full of strange voices. 'Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the"
11454,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"cedars of Lebanon, saying, ""Since thou art gone down to the grave, no"
11455,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"feller is come up against us.""' So, still more, the thought of the"
11456,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,presence of Deity cannot be borne without this great astonishment.
11457,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,'The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
11458,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.'"
11459,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11460,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 15. But by how much this feeling is noble when it is justified by
11461,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"the strength of its cause, by so much it is ignoble when there is not"
11462,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,cause enough for it; and beyond all other ignobleness is the mere
11463,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"affectation of it, in hardness of heart. Simply bad writing may almost"
11464,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"always, as above noticed, be known by its adoption of these fanciful"
11465,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"metaphorical expressions, as a sort of current coin; yet there is even"
11466,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"a worse, at least a more harmful, condition of writing than this, in"
11467,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"which such expressions are not ignorantly and feelinglessly caught up,"
11468,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"but, by some master, skilful in handling, yet insincere, deliberately"
11469,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,wrought out with chill and studied fancy; as if we should try to make
11470,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"an old lava stream look red-hot again, by covering it with dead"
11471,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"leaves, or white-hot, with hoar-frost."
11472,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11473,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"When Young is lost in veneration, as he dwells on the character of a"
11474,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"truly good and holy man, he permits himself for a moment to be"
11475,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,overborne by the feeling so far as to exclaim:
11476,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11477,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Where shall I find him? angels, tell me where."
11478,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,You know him; he is near you; point him out.
11479,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Shall I see glories beaming from his brow,"
11480,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers?
11481,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11482,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"This emotion has a worthy cause, and is thus true and right. But now"
11483,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,hear the cold-hearted Pope say to a shepherd girl:
11484,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11485,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Where'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade;"
11486,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade;"
11487,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Your praise the birds shall chant in every grove,"
11488,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,And winds shall waft it to the powers above.
11489,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"But would you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain,"
11490,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,The wondering forests soon should dance again;
11491,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The moving mountains hear the powerful call,"
11492,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And headlong streams hang, listening, in their fall."
11493,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11494,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"This is not, nor could it for a moment be mistaken for, the language"
11495,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"of passion. It is simple falsehood, uttered by hypocrisy; definite"
11496,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"absurdity, rooted in affectation, and coldly asserted in the teeth of"
11497,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,nature and fact. Passion will indeed go far in deceiving itself; but
11498,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"it must be a strong passion, not the simple wish of a lover to tempt"
11499,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,his mistress to sing. Compare a very closely parallel passage in
11500,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Wordsworth, in which the lover has lost his mistress:"
11501,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11502,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid,"
11503,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,When thus his moan he made:--
11504,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11505,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'Oh move, thou cottage, from behind yon oak,"
11506,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Or let the ancient tree uprooted lie,"
11507,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,That in some other way yon smoke
11508,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,May mount into the sky.
11509,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"If still behind yon pine-tree's ragged bough,"
11510,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Headlong, the waterfall must come,"
11511,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Oh, let it, then, be dumb--"
11512,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Be anything, sweet stream, but that which thou art now.'"
11513,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11514,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Here is a cottage to be moved, if not a mountain, and a waterfall to"
11515,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"be silent, if it is not to hang listening: but with what different"
11516,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"relation to the mind that contemplates them! Here, in the extremity of"
11517,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"its agony, the soul cries out wildly for relief, which at the same"
11518,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"moment it partly knows to be impossible, but partly believes possible,"
11519,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,in a vague impression that a miracle _might_ be wrought to give relief
11520,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"even to a less sore distress,--that nature is kind, and God is kind,"
11521,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,and that grief is strong: it knows not well what _is_ possible to such
11522,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"grief. To silence a stream, to move a cottage wall,--one might think"
11523,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,it could do as much as that!
11524,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11525,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,§ 16. I believe these instances are enough to illustrate the main
11526,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"point I insist upon respecting the pathetic fallacy,--that so far as"
11527,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"it _is_ a fallacy, it is always the sign of a morbid state of mind,"
11528,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,and comparatively of a weak one. Even in the most inspired prophet it
11529,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,is a sign of the incapacity of his human sight or thought to bear what
11530,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"has been revealed to it. In ordinary poetry, if it is found in the"
11531,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"thoughts of the poet himself, it is at once a sign of his belonging to"
11532,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,the inferior school; if in the thoughts of the characters imagined by
11533,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"him, it is right or wrong according to the genuineness of the emotion"
11534,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"from which it springs; always, however, implying necessarily _some_"
11535,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,degree of weakness in the character.
11536,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11537,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Take two most exquisite instances from master hands. The Jessy of
11538,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Shenstone, and the Ellen of Wordsworth, have both been betrayed and"
11539,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"deserted. Jessy, in the course of her most touching complaint, says:"
11540,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11541,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"If through the garden's flowery tribes I stray,"
11542,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Where bloom the jasmines that could once allure,"
11543,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'Hope not to find delight in us,' they say,"
11544,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'For we are spotless, Jessy; we are pure.'"
11545,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11546,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Compare with this some of the words of Ellen:
11547,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11548,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'Ah, why,' said Ellen, sighing to herself,"
11549,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'Why do not words, and kiss, and solemn pledge,"
11550,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And nature, that is kind in woman's breast,"
11551,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And reason, that in man is wise and good,"
11552,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And fear of Him who is a righteous Judge,--"
11553,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Why do not these prevail for human life,"
11554,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"To keep two hearts together, that began"
11555,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Their springtime with one love, and that have need"
11556,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Of mutual pity and forgiveness, sweet"
11557,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"To grant, or be received; while that poor bird--"
11558,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"O, come and hear him! Thou who hast to me"
11559,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Been faithless, hear him;--though a lowly creature,"
11560,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"One of God's simple children, that yet know not"
11561,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The Universal Parent, _how_ he sings!"
11562,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,As if he wished the firmament of heaven
11563,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Should listen, and give back to him the voice"
11564,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,Of his triumphant constancy and love.
11565,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The proclamation that he makes, how far"
11566,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,His darkness doth transcend our fickle light.'
11567,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11568,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"The perfection of both these passages, as far as regards truth and"
11569,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"tenderness of imagination in the two poets, is quite insuperable. But,"
11570,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"of the two characters imagined, Jessy is weaker than Ellen, exactly in"
11571,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,so far as something appears to her to be in nature which is not. The
11572,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"flowers do not really reproach her. God meant them to comfort her, not"
11573,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,to taunt her; they would do so if she saw them rightly.
11574,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11575,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"Ellen, on the other hand, is quite above the slightest erring emotion."
11576,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,There is not the barest film of fallacy in all her thoughts. She
11577,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"reasons as calmly as if she did not feel. And, although the singing of"
11578,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,the bird suggests to her the idea of its desiring to be heard in
11579,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"heaven, she does not for an instant admit any veracity in the thought."
11580,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"'As if,' she says,--'I know he means nothing of the kind; but it does"
11581,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"verily seem as if.' The reader will find, by examining the rest of the"
11582,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"poem, that Ellen's character is throughout consistent in this clear"
11583,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,though passionate strength.[34]
11584,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11585,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,[34] I cannot quit this subject without giving two more
11586,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"instances, both exquisite, of the pathetic fallacy, which I"
11587,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"have just come upon, in _Maud_:"
11588,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11589,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,For a great speculation had fail'd;
11590,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And ever he mutter'd and madden'd, and ever wann'd with despair;"
11591,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And out he walk'd, when the wind like a broken worldling wail'd,"
11592,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And the _flying gold of the ruin'd woodlands drove, thro'"

11597,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"_The red rose cries, 'She is near, she is near!'"
11598,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"And the white rose weeps, 'She is late.'"

11601,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,
11602,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"It is, I hope, now made clear to the reader in all respects that the"
11603,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"pathetic fallacy is powerful only so far as it is pathetic, feeble so"
11604,OF THE PATHETIC FALLACY,"far as it is fallacious, and, therefore, that the dominion of Truth is"

11619,I,
11620,I,"It has often been asked, What is Poetry? And many and various are the"
11621,I,answers which have been returned. The vulgarest of all--one with which
11622,I,no person possessed of the faculties to which Poetry addresses itself
11623,I,can ever have been satisfied--is that which confounds poetry with
11624,I,"metrical composition: yet to this wretched mockery of a definition,"
11625,I,"many have been led back, by the failure of all their attempts to find"
11626,I,any other that would distinguish what they have been accustomed to
11627,I,"call poetry, from much which they have known only under other names."
11628,I,
11629,I,"That, however, the word 'poetry' imports something quite peculiar in"
11630,I,"its nature, something which may exist in what is called prose as well"
11631,I,"as in verse, something which does not even require the instrument of"
11632,I,"words, but can speak through the other audible symbols called musical"
11633,I,"sounds, and even through the visible ones which are the language of"
11634,I,"sculpture, painting, and architecture; all this, we believe, is and"
11635,I,"must be felt, though perhaps indistinctly, by all upon whom poetry in"
11636,I,any of its shapes produces any impression beyond that of tickling the
11637,I,"ear. The distinction between poetry and what is not poetry, whether"
11638,I,"explained or not, is felt to be fundamental: and where every one feels"
11639,I,"a difference, a difference there must be. All other appearances may be"
11640,I,"fallacious, but the appearance of a difference is a real difference."
11641,I,"Appearances too, like other things, must have a cause, and that which"
11642,I,"can cause anything, even an illusion, must be a reality. And hence,"
11643,I,while a half-philosophy disdains the classifications and distinctions
11644,I,"indicated by popular language, philosophy carried to its highest point"
11645,I,"frames new ones, but rarely sets aside the old, content with"
11646,I,"correcting and regularizing them. It cuts fresh channels for thought,"
11647,I,"but does not fill up such as it finds ready-made; it traces, on the"
11648,I,"contrary, more deeply, broadly, and distinctly, those into which the"
11649,I,current has spontaneously flowed.
11650,I,
11651,I,"Let us then attempt, in the way of modest inquiry, not to coerce and"
11652,I,"confine nature within the bounds of an arbitrary definition, but"
11653,I,"rather to find the boundaries which she herself has set, and erect a"
11654,I,barrier round them; not calling mankind to account for having
11655,I,"misapplied the word 'poetry', but attempting to clear up the"
11656,I,"conception which they already attach to it, and to bring forward as a"
11657,I,"distinct principle that which, as a vague feeling, has really guided"
11658,I,them in their employment of the term.
11659,I,
11660,I,The object of poetry is confessedly to act upon the emotions; and
11661,I,therein is poetry sufficiently distinguished from what Wordsworth
11662,I,"affirms to be its logical opposite, namely, not prose, but matter of"
11663,I,"fact or science. The one addresses itself to the belief, the other to"
11664,I,"the feelings. The one does its work by convincing or persuading, the"
11665,I,other by moving. The one acts by presenting a proposition to the
11666,I,"understanding, the other by offering interesting objects of"
11667,I,contemplation to the sensibilities.
11668,I,
11669,I,"This, however, leaves us very far from a definition of poetry. This"
11670,I,"distinguishes it from one thing, but we are bound to distinguish it"
11671,I,from everything. To bring thoughts or images before the mind for the
11672,I,"purpose of acting upon the emotions, does not belong to poetry alone."
11673,I,It is equally the province (for example) of the novelist: and yet the
11674,I,faculty of the poet and that of the novelist are as distinct as any
11675,I,other two faculties; as the faculties of the novelist and of the
11676,I,"orator, or of the poet and the metaphysician. The two characters may"
11677,I,"be united, as characters the most disparate may; but they have no"
11678,I,natural connexion.
11679,I,
11680,I,"Many of the greatest poems are in the form of fictitious narratives,"
11681,I,and in almost all good serious fictions there is true poetry. But
11682,I,there is a radical distinction between the interest felt in a story as
11683,I,"such, and the interest excited by poetry; for the one is derived from"
11684,I,"incident, the other from the representation of feeling. In one, the"
11685,I,source of the emotion excited is the exhibition of a state or states
11686,I,"of human sensibility; in the other, of a series of states of mere"
11687,I,"outward circumstances. Now, all minds are capable of being affected"
11688,I,"more or less by representations of the latter kind, and all, or almost"
11689,I,"all, by those of the former; yet the two sources of interest"
11690,I,"correspond to two distinct, and (as respects their greatest"
11691,I,"development) mutually exclusive, characters of mind."
11692,I,
11693,I,"At what age is the passion for a story, for almost any kind of story,"
11694,I,"merely as a story, the most intense? In childhood. But that also is"
11695,I,"the age at which poetry, even of the simplest description, is least"
11696,I,relished and least understood; because the feelings with which it is
11697,I,"especially conversant are yet undeveloped, and not having been even in"
11698,I,"the slightest degree experienced, cannot be sympathized with. In what"
11699,I,"stage of the progress of society, again, is story-telling most valued,"
11700,I,and the story-teller in greatest request and honour?--In a rude state
11701,I,"like that of the Tartars and Arabs at this day, and of almost all"
11702,I,nations in the earliest ages. But in this state of society there is
11703,I,"little poetry except ballads, which are mostly narrative, that is,"
11704,I,"essentially stories, and derive their principal interest from the"
11705,I,"incidents. Considered as poetry, they are of the lowest and most"
11706,I,"elementary kind: the feelings depicted, or rather indicated, are the"
11707,I,simplest our nature has; such joys and griefs as the immediate
11708,I,"pressure of some outward event excites in rude minds, which live"
11709,I,"wholly immersed in outward things, and have never, either from choice"
11710,I,"or a force they could not resist, turned themselves to the"
11711,I,"contemplation of the world within. Passing now from childhood, and"
11712,I,"from the childhood of society, to the grown-up men and women of this"
11713,I,most grown-up and unchildlike age--the minds and hearts of greatest
11714,I,depth and elevation are commonly those which take greatest delight in
11715,I,"poetry; the shallowest and emptiest, on the contrary, are, at all"
11716,I,"events, not those least addicted to novel-reading. This accords, too,"
11717,I,with all analogous experience of human nature. The sort of persons
11718,I,"whom not merely in books but in their lives, we find perpetually"
11719,I,"engaged in hunting for excitement from without, are invariably those"
11720,I,"who do not possess, either in the vigour of their intellectual powers"
11721,I,"or in the depth of their sensibilities, that which would enable them"
11722,I,to find ample excitement nearer home. The most idle and frivolous
11723,I,persons take a natural delight in fictitious narrative; the excitement
11724,I,it affords is of the kind which comes from without. Such persons are
11725,I,"rarely lovers of poetry, though they may fancy themselves so, because"
11726,I,"they relish novels in verse. But poetry, which is the delineation of"
11727,I,"the deeper and more secret workings of human emotion, is interesting"
11728,I,"only to those to whom it recalls what they have felt, or whose"
11729,I,"imagination it stirs up to conceive what they could feel, or what they"
11730,I,"might have been able to feel, had their outward circumstances been"
11731,I,different.
11732,I,
11733,I,"Poetry, when it is really such, is truth; and fiction also, if it is"
11734,I,"good for anything, is truth: but they are different truths. The truth"
11735,I,of poetry is to paint the human soul truly: the truth of fiction is to
11736,I,"give a true picture of life. The two kinds of knowledge are different,"
11737,I,"and come by different ways, come mostly to different persons. Great"
11738,I,poets are often proverbially ignorant of life. What they know has come
11739,I,by observation of themselves; they have found within them one highly
11740,I,"delicate and sensitive specimen of human nature, on which the laws of"
11741,I,"emotion are written in large characters, such as can be read off"
11742,I,"without much study. Other knowledge of mankind, such as comes to men"
11743,I,"of the world by outward experience, is not indispensable to them as"
11744,I,poets: but to the novelist such knowledge is all in all; he has to
11745,I,"describe outward things, not the inward man; actions and events, not"
11746,I,"feelings; and it will not do for him to be numbered among those who,"
11747,I,"as Madame Roland said of Brissot, know man but not _men_."
11748,I,
11749,I,"All this is no bar to the possibility of combining both elements,"
11750,I,"poetry and narrative or incident, in the same work, and calling it"
11751,I,either a novel or a poem; but so may red and white combine on the same
11752,I,"human features, or on the same canvas. There is one order of"
11753,I,"composition which requires the union of poetry and incident, each in"
11754,I,its highest kind--the dramatic. Even there the two elements are
11755,I,"perfectly distinguishable, and may exist of unequal quality, and in"
11756,I,the most various proportion. The incidents of a dramatic poem may be
11757,I,"scanty and ineffective, though the delineation of passion and"
11758,I,character may be of the highest order; as in Goethe's admirable
11759,I,"_Torquato Tasso_; or again, the story as a mere story may be well got"
11760,I,"up for effect, as is the case with some of the most trashy productions"
11761,I,"of the Minerva press: it may even be, what those are not, a coherent"
11762,I,"and probable series of events, though there be scarcely a feeling"
11763,I,"exhibited which is not represented falsely, or in a manner absolutely"
11764,I,commonplace. The combination of the two excellences is what renders
11765,I,"Shakespeare so generally acceptable, each sort of readers finding in"
11766,I,him what is suitable to their faculties. To the many he is great as a
11767,I,"story-teller, to the few as a poet."
11768,I,
11769,I,"In limiting poetry to the delineation of states of feeling, and"
11770,I,"denying the name where nothing is delineated but outward objects, we"
11771,I,may be thought to have done what we promised to avoid--to have not
11772,I,"found, but made a definition, in opposition to the usage of language,"
11773,I,since it is established by common consent that there is a poetry
11774,I,called descriptive. We deny the charge. Description is not poetry
11775,I,"because there is descriptive poetry, no more than science is poetry"
11776,I,because there is such a thing as a didactic poem. But an object which
11777,I,"admits of being described, or a truth which may fill a place in a"
11778,I,"scientific treatise, may also furnish an occasion for the generation"
11779,I,"of poetry, which we thereupon choose to call descriptive or didactic."
11780,I,"The poetry is not in the object itself, nor in the scientific truth"
11781,I,"itself, but in the state of mind in which the one and the other may be"
11782,I,contemplated. The mere delineation of the dimensions and colours of
11783,I,"external objects is not poetry, no more than a geometrical ground-plan"
11784,I,of St. Peter's or Westminster Abbey is painting. Descriptive poetry
11785,I,"consists, no doubt, in description, but in description of things as"
11786,I,"they appear, not as they are; and it paints them not in their bare and"
11787,I,"natural lineaments, but seen through the medium and arrayed in the"
11788,I,colours of the imagination set in action by the feelings. If a poet
11789,I,"describes a lion, he does not describe him as a naturalist would, nor"
11790,I,"even as a traveller would, who was intent upon stating the truth, the"
11791,I,"whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He describes him by imagery,"
11792,I,"that is, by suggesting the most striking likenesses and contrasts"
11793,I,"which might occur to a mind contemplating the lion, in the state of"
11794,I,"awe, wonder, or terror, which the spectacle naturally excites, or is,"
11795,I,"on the occasion, supposed to excite. Now this is describing the lion"
11796,I,"professedly, but the state of excitement of the spectator really. The"
11797,I,"lion may be described falsely or with exaggeration, and the poetry be"
11798,I,all the better; but if the human emotion be not painted with
11799,I,"scrupulous truth, the poetry is bad poetry, i. e. is not poetry at"
11800,I,"all, but a failure."
11801,I,
11802,I,Thus far our progress towards a clear view of the essentials of
11803,I,poetry has brought us very close to the last two attempts at a
11804,I,"definition of poetry which we happen to have seen in print, both of"
11805,I,"them by poets and men of genius. The one is by Ebenezer Elliott, the"
11806,I,"author of _Corn-Law Rhymes_, and other poems of still greater merit."
11807,I,"'Poetry', says he, 'is impassioned truth.' The other is by a writer in"
11808,I,"_Blackwood's Magazine_, and comes, we think, still nearer the mark. He"
11809,I,"defines poetry, 'man's thoughts tinged by his feelings'. There is in"
11810,I,either definition a near approximation to what we are in search of.
11811,I,"Every truth which a human being can enunciate, every thought, even"
11812,I,"every outward impression, which can enter into his consciousness, may"
11813,I,"become poetry when shown through any impassioned medium, when invested"
11814,I,"with the colouring of joy, or grief, or pity, or affection, or"
11815,I,"admiration, or reverence, or awe, or even hatred or terror: and,"
11816,I,"unless so coloured, nothing, be it as interesting as it may, is"
11817,I,poetry. But both these definitions fail to discriminate between poetry
11818,I,"and eloquence. Eloquence, as well as poetry, is impassioned truth;"
11819,I,"eloquence, as well as poetry, is thoughts coloured by the feelings."
11820,I,Yet common apprehension and philosophic criticism alike recognize a
11821,I,distinction between the two: there is much that every one would call
11822,I,"eloquence, which no one would think of classing as poetry. A question"
11823,I,"will sometimes arise, whether some particular author is a poet; and"
11824,I,"those who maintain the negative commonly allow that, though not a"
11825,I,"poet, he is a highly eloquent writer. The distinction between poetry"
11826,I,and eloquence appears to us to be equally fundamental with the
11827,I,"distinction between poetry and narrative, or between poetry and"
11828,I,"description, while it is still farther from having been satisfactorily"
11829,I,cleared up than either of the others.
11830,I,
11831,I,Poetry and eloquence are both alike the expression or utterance of
11832,I,"feeling. But if we may be excused the antithesis, we should say that"
11833,I,"eloquence is _heard_, poetry is _over_heard. Eloquence supposes an"
11834,I,audience; the peculiarity of poetry appears to us to lie in the poet's
11835,I,utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling confessing
11836,I,"itself to itself, in moments of solitude, and embodying itself in"
11837,I,symbols which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling
11838,I,in the exact shape in which it exists in the poet's mind. Eloquence is
11839,I,"feeling pouring itself out to other minds, courting their sympathy, or"
11840,I,endeavouring to influence their belief or move them to passion or to
11841,I,action.
11842,I,
11843,I,All poetry is of the nature of soliloquy. It may be said that poetry
11844,I,"which is printed on hot-pressed paper and sold at a bookseller's shop,"
11845,I,"is a soliloquy in full dress, and on the stage. It is so; but there is"
11846,I,nothing absurd in the idea of such a mode of soliloquizing. What we
11847,I,"have said to ourselves, we may tell to others afterwards; what we have"
11848,I,"said or done in solitude, we may voluntarily reproduce when we know"
11849,I,that other eyes are upon us. But no trace of consciousness that any
11850,I,eyes are upon us must be visible in the work itself. The actor knows
11851,I,"that there is an audience present; but if he act as though he knew it,"
11852,I,he acts ill. A poet may write poetry not only with the intention of
11853,I,"printing it, but for the express purpose of being paid for it; that it"
11854,I,"should _be_ poetry, being written under such influences, is less"
11855,I,"probable; not, however, impossible; but no otherwise possible than if"
11856,I,he can succeed in excluding from his work every vestige of such
11857,I,"lookings-forth into the outward and every-day world, and can express"
11858,I,"his emotions exactly as he has felt them in solitude, or as he is"
11859,I,conscious that he should feel them though they were to remain for ever
11860,I,"unuttered, or (at the lowest) as he knows that others feel them in"
11861,I,similar circumstances of solitude. But when he turns round and
11862,I,addresses himself to another person; when the act of utterance is not
11863,I,"itself the end, but a means to an end,--viz. by the feelings he"
11864,I,"himself expresses, to work upon the feelings, or upon the belief, or"
11865,I,"the will, of another,--when the expression of his emotions, or of his"
11866,I,"thoughts tinged by his emotions, is tinged also by that purpose, by"
11867,I,"that desire of making an impression upon another mind, then it ceases"
11868,I,"to be poetry, and becomes eloquence."
11869,I,
11870,I,"Poetry, accordingly, is the natural fruit of solitude and meditation;"
11871,I,"eloquence, of intercourse with the world. The persons who have most"
11872,I,"feeling of their own, if intellectual culture has given them a"
11873,I,"language in which to express it, have the highest faculty of poetry;"
11874,I,"those who best understand the feelings of others, are the most"
11875,I,"eloquent. The persons, and the nations, who commonly excel in poetry,"
11876,I,are those whose character and tastes render them least dependent upon
11877,I,"the applause, or sympathy, or concurrence of the world in general."
11878,I,"Those to whom that applause, that sympathy, that concurrence are most"
11879,I,"necessary, generally excel most in eloquence. And hence, perhaps, the"
11880,I,"French, who are the least poetical of all great and intellectual"
11881,I,"nations, are among the most eloquent: the French, also, being the most"
11882,I,"sociable, the vainest, and the least self-dependent."
11883,I,
11884,I,"If the above be, as we believe, the true theory of the distinction"
11885,I,commonly admitted between eloquence and poetry; or even though it be
11886,I,"not so, yet if, as we cannot doubt, the distinction above stated be a"
11887,I,"real bona fide distinction, it will be found to hold, not merely in"
11888,I,"the language of words, but in all other language, and to intersect the"
11889,I,whole domain of art.
11890,I,
11891,I,"Take, for example, music: we shall find in that art, so peculiarly the"
11892,I,"expression of passion, two perfectly distinct styles; one of which may"
11893,I,"be called the poetry, the other the oratory of music. This difference,"
11894,I,"being seized, would put an end to much musical sectarianism. There has"
11895,I,"been much contention whether the music of the modern Italian school,"
11896,I,"that of Rossini and his successors, be impassioned or not. Without"
11897,I,"doubt, the passion it expresses is not the musing, meditative"
11898,I,"tenderness, or pathos, or grief of Mozart or Beethoven. Yet it is"
11899,I,"passion, but garrulous passion--the passion which pours itself into"
11900,I,"other ears; and therein the better calculated for dramatic effect,"
11901,I,having a natural adaptation for dialogue. Mozart also is great in
11902,I,musical oratory; but his most touching compositions are in the
11903,I,opposite style--that of soliloquy. Who can imagine 'Dove sono'
11904,I,_heard_? We imagine it _over_heard.
11905,I,
11906,I,Purely pathetic music commonly partakes of soliloquy. The soul is
11907,I,"absorbed in its distress, and though there may be bystanders, it is"
11908,I,"not thinking of them. When the mind is looking within, and not"
11909,I,"without, its state does not often or rapidly vary; and hence the even,"
11910,I,"uninterrupted flow, approaching almost to monotony, which a good"
11911,I,"reader, or a good singer, will give to words or music of a pensive or"
11912,I,"melancholy cast. But grief taking the form of a prayer, or of a"
11913,I,"complaint, becomes oratorical; no longer low, and even, and subdued,"
11914,I,"it assumes a more emphatic rhythm, a more rapidly returning accent;"
11915,I,"instead of a few slow equal notes, following one after another at"
11916,I,"regular intervals, it crowds note upon note, and often assumes a hurry"
11917,I,and bustle like joy. Those who are familiar with some of the best of
11918,I,"Rossini's serious compositions, such as the air 'Tu che i miseri"
11919,I,"conforti', in the opera of _Tancredi_, or the duet 'Ebben per mia"
11920,I,"memoria', in _La Gazza Ladra_, will at once understand and feel our"
11921,I,meaning. Both are highly tragic and passionate; the passion of both is
11922,I,"that of oratory, not poetry. The like may be said of that most moving"
11923,I,invocation in Beethoven's _Fidelio_--
11924,I,
11925,I,"Komm, Hoffnung, lass das letzte Stern"
11926,I,Der Müde nicht erbleichen;
11927,I,
11928,I,in which Madame Schröder Devrient exhibited such consummate powers of
11929,I,"pathetic expression. How different from Winter's beautiful 'Paga fui',"
11930,I,the very soul of melancholy exhaling itself in solitude; fuller of
11931,I,"meaning, and, therefore, more profoundly poetical than the words for"
11932,I,"which it was composed--for it seems to express not simple melancholy,"
11933,I,but the melancholy of remorse.
11934,I,
11935,I,"If, from vocal music, we now pass to instrumental, we may have a"
11936,I,specimen of musical oratory in any fine military symphony or march:
11937,I,while the poetry of music seems to have attained its consummation in
11938,I,"Beethoven's Overture to Egmont, so wonderful in its mixed expression"
11939,I,of grandeur and melancholy.
11940,I,
11941,I,"In the arts which speak to the eye, the same distinctions will be"
11942,I,"found to hold, not only between poetry and oratory, but between"
11943,I,"poetry, oratory, narrative, and simple imitation or description."
11944,I,
11945,I,Pure description is exemplified in a mere portrait or a mere
11946,I,"landscape--productions of art, it is true, but of the mechanical"
11947,I,"rather than of the fine arts, being works of simple imitation, not"
11948,I,"creation. We say, a mere portrait, or a mere landscape, because it is"
11949,I,"possible for a portrait or a landscape, without ceasing to be such, to"
11950,I,"be also a picture; like Turner's landscapes, and the great portraits"
11951,I,by Titian or Vandyke.
11952,I,
11953,I,Whatever in painting or sculpture expresses human feeling--or
11954,I,"character, which is only a certain state of feeling grown"
11955,I,"habitual--may be called, according to circumstances, the poetry, or"
11956,I,"the eloquence, of the painter's or the sculptor's art: the poetry, if"
11957,I,the feeling declares itself by such signs as escape from us when we
11958,I,"are unconscious of being seen; the oratory, if the signs are those we"
11959,I,use for the purpose of voluntary communication.
11960,I,
11961,I,"The narrative style answers to what is called historical painting,"
11962,I,which it is the fashion among connoisseurs to treat as the climax of
11963,I,the pictorial art. That it is the most difficult branch of the art we
11964,I,"do not doubt, because, in its perfection, it includes the perfection"
11965,I,"of all the other branches: as in like manner an epic poem, though in"
11966,I,"so far as it is epic (i. e. narrative) it is not poetry at all, is yet"
11967,I,"esteemed the greatest effort of poetic genius, because there is no"
11968,I,kind whatever of poetry which may not appropriately find a place in
11969,I,"it. But an historical picture as such, that is, as the representation"
11970,I,"of an incident, must necessarily, as it seems to us, be poor and"
11971,I,ineffective. The narrative powers of painting are extremely limited.
11972,I,"Scarcely any picture, scarcely even any series of pictures, tells its"
11973,I,own story without the aid of an interpreter. But it is the single
11974,I,"figures which, to us, are the great charm even of an historical"
11975,I,picture. It is in these that the power of the art is really seen. In
11976,I,"the attempt to narrate, visible and permanent signs are too far behind"
11977,I,"the fugitive audible ones, which follow so fast one after another,"
11978,I,"while the faces and figures in a narrative picture, even though they"
11979,I,"be Titian's, stand still. Who would not prefer one Virgin and Child of"
11980,I,"Raphael, to all the pictures which Rubens, with his fat, frouzy Dutch"
11981,I,"Venuses, ever painted? Though Rubens, besides excelling almost every"
11982,I,"one in his mastery over the mechanical parts of his art, often shows"
11983,I,"real genius in _grouping_ his figures, the peculiar problem of"
11984,I,"historical painting. But then, who, except a mere student of drawing"
11985,I,"and colouring, ever cared to look twice at any of the figures"
11986,I,"themselves? The power of painting lies in poetry, of which Rubens had"
11987,I,"not the slightest tincture--not in narrative, wherein he might have"
11988,I,excelled.
11989,I,
11990,I,"The single figures, however, in an historical picture, are rather the"
11991,I,eloquence of painting than the poetry: they mostly (unless they are
11992,I,quite out of place in the picture) express the feelings of one person
11993,I,as modified by the presence of others. Accordingly the minds whose
11994,I,"bent leads them rather to eloquence than to poetry, rush to historical"
11995,I,"painting. The French painters, for instance, seldom attempt, because"
11996,I,"they could make nothing of, single heads, like those glorious ones of"
11997,I,"the Italian masters, with which they might feed themselves day after"
11998,I,"day in their own Louvre. They must all be historical; and they are,"
11999,I,"almost to a man, attitudinizers. If we wished to give any young"
12000,I,artist the most impressive warning our imagination could devise
12001,I,"against that kind of vice in the pictorial, which corresponds to rant"
12002,I,"in the histrionic art, we would advise him to walk once up and once"
12003,I,down the gallery of the Luxembourg. Every figure in French painting or
12004,I,statuary seems to be showing itself off before spectators; they are
12005,I,"not poetical, but in the worst style of corrupted eloquence."
12006,I,
12007,I,
12008,II,II
12009,II,
12010,II,"_Nascitur Poeta_ is a maxim of classical antiquity, which has passed"
12011,II,to these latter days with less questioning than most of the doctrines
12012,II,"of that early age. When it originated, the human faculties were"
12013,II,"occupied, fortunately for posterity, less in examining how the works"
12014,II,"of genius are created, than in creating them: and the adage, probably,"
12015,II,had no higher source than the tendency common among mankind to
12016,II,"consider all power which is not visibly the effect of practice, all"
12017,II,"skill which is not capable of being reduced to mechanical rules, as"
12018,II,"the result of a peculiar gift. Yet this aphorism, born in the infancy"
12019,II,"of psychology, will perhaps be found, now when that science is in its"
12020,II,"adolescence, to be as true as an epigram ever is, that is, to contain"
12021,II,"some truth: truth, however, which has been so compressed and bent out"
12022,II,"of shape, in order to tie it up into so small a knot of only two words"
12023,II,that it requires an almost infinite amount of unrolling and laying
12024,II,"straight, before it will resume its just proportions."
12025,II,
12026,II,We are not now intending to remark upon the grosser misapplications of
12027,II,"this ancient maxim, which have engendered so many races of"
12028,II,poetasters. The days are gone by when every raw youth whose borrowed
12029,II,"phantasies have set themselves to a borrowed tune, mistaking, as"
12030,II,"Coleridge says, an ardent desire of poetic reputation for poetic"
12031,II,"genius, while unable to disguise from himself that he had taken no"
12032,II,"means whereby he might _become_ a poet, could fancy himself a born"
12033,II,"one. Those who would reap without sowing, and gain the victory without"
12034,II,"fighting the battle, are ambitious now of another sort of distinction,"
12035,II,"and are born novelists, or public speakers, not poets. And the wiser"
12036,II,thinkers understand and acknowledge that poetic excellence is subject
12037,II,to the same necessary conditions with any other mental endowment; and
12038,II,that to no one of the spiritual benefactors of mankind is a higher or
12039,II,a more assiduous intellectual culture needful than to the poet. It is
12040,II,"true, he possesses this advantage over others who use the 'instrument"
12041,II,"of words', that, of the truths which he utters, a larger proportion"
12042,II,"are derived from personal consciousness, and a smaller from"
12043,II,philosophic investigation. But the power itself of discriminating
12044,II,"between what really is consciousness, and what is only a process of"
12045,II,inference completed in a single instant--and the capacity of
12046,II,distinguishing whether that of which the mind is conscious be an
12047,II,"eternal truth, or but a dream--are among the last results of the most"
12048,II,"matured and perfect intellect. Not to mention, that the poet, no more"
12049,II,"than any other person who writes, confines himself altogether to"
12050,II,"intuitive truths, nor has any means of communicating even these but by"
12051,II,"words, every one of which derives all its power of conveying a"
12052,II,"meaning, from a whole host of acquired notions, and facts learnt by"
12053,II,study and experience.
12054,II,
12055,II,"Nevertheless, it seems undeniable in point of fact, and consistent"
12056,II,"with the principles of a sound metaphysics, that there are poetic"
12057,II,"_natures_. There is a mental and physical constitution or temperament,"
12058,II,peculiarly fitted for poetry. This temperament will not of itself make
12059,II,"a poet, no more than the soil will the fruit; and as good fruit may be"
12060,II,"raised by culture from indifferent soils, so may good poetry from"
12061,II,naturally unpoetical minds. But the poetry of one who is a poet by
12062,II,"nature, will be clearly and broadly distinguishable from the poetry of"
12063,II,mere culture. It may not be truer; it may not be more useful; but it
12064,II,"will be different: fewer will appreciate it, even though many should"
12065,II,"affect to do so; but in those few it will find a keener sympathy, and"
12066,II,will yield them a deeper enjoyment.
12067,II,
12068,II,"One may write genuine poetry, and not be a poet; for whosoever writes"
12069,II,"out truly any human feeling, writes poetry. All persons, even the most"
12070,II,"unimaginative, in moments of strong emotion, speak poetry; and hence"
12071,II,"the drama is poetry, which else were always prose, except when a poet"
12072,II,"is one of the characters. What _is_ poetry, but the thoughts and words"
12073,II,in which emotion spontaneously embodies itself? As there are few who
12074,II,"are not, at least for some moments and in some situations, capable of"
12075,II,"some strong feeling, poetry is natural to most persons at some period"
12076,II,"of their lives. And any one whose feelings are genuine, though but of"
12077,II,"the average strength,--if he be not diverted by uncongenial thoughts"
12078,II,"or occupations from the indulgence of them, and if he acquire by"
12079,II,"culture, as all persons may, the faculty of delineating them"
12080,II,"correctly,--has it in his power to be a poet, so far as a life passed"
12081,II,in writing unquestionable poetry may be considered to confer that
12082,II,"title. But _ought_ it to do so? Yes, perhaps, in a collection of"
12083,II,"'British Poets'. But 'poet' is the name also of a variety of man, not"
12084,II,"solely of the author of a particular variety of book: now, to have"
12085,II,written whole volumes of real poetry is possible to almost all kinds
12086,II,"of characters, and implies no greater peculiarity of mental"
12087,II,"construction, than to be the author of a history, or a novel."
12088,II,
12089,II,"Whom, then, shall we call poets? Those who are so constituted, that"
12090,II,"emotions are the links of association by which their ideas, both"
12091,II,"sensuous and spiritual, are connected together. This constitution"
12092,II,belongs (within certain limits) to all in whom poetry is a pervading
12093,II,"principle. In all others, poetry is something extraneous and"
12094,II,"superinduced: something out of themselves, foreign to the habitual"
12095,II,course of their every-day lives and characters; a world to which they
12096,II,"may make occasional visits, but where they are sojourners, not"
12097,II,"dwellers, and which, when out of it, or even when in it, they think"
12098,II,"of, peradventure, but as a phantom-world, a place of _ignes fatui_ and"
12099,II,spectral illusions. Those only who have the peculiarity of association
12100,II,"which we have mentioned, and which is a natural though not a universal"
12101,II,"consequence of intense sensibility, instead of seeming not themselves"
12102,II,"when they are uttering poetry, scarcely seem themselves when uttering"
12103,II,anything to which poetry is foreign. Whatever be the thing which they
12104,II,"are contemplating, if it be capable of connecting itself with their"
12105,II,"emotions, the aspect under which it first and most naturally paints"
12106,II,"itself to them, is its poetic aspect. The poet of culture sees his"
12107,II,"object in prose, and describes it in poetry; the poet of nature"
12108,II,actually sees it in poetry.
12109,II,
12110,II,"This point is perhaps worth some little illustration; the rather, as"
12111,II,"metaphysicians (the ultimate arbiters of all philosophical criticism),"
12112,II,"while they have busied themselves for two thousand years, more or"
12113,II,"less, about the few _universal_ laws of human nature, have strangely"
12114,II,"neglected the analysis of its _diversities_. Of these, none lie deeper"
12115,II,or reach further than the varieties which difference of nature and of
12116,II,education makes in what may be termed the habitual bond of
12117,II,"association. In a mind entirely uncultivated, which is also without"
12118,II,"any strong feelings, objects whether of sense or of intellect arrange"
12119,II,"themselves in the mere casual order in which they have been seen,"
12120,II,"heard, or otherwise perceived. Persons of this sort may be said to"
12121,II,"think chronologically. If they remember a fact, it is by reason of a"
12122,II,fortuitous coincidence with some trifling incident or circumstance
12123,II,"which took place at the very time. If they have a story to tell, or"
12124,II,"testimony to deliver in a witness-box, their narrative must follow the"
12125,II,"exact order in which the events took place: _dodge_ them, and the"
12126,II,thread of association is broken; they cannot go on. Their
12127,II,"associations, to use the language of philosophers, are chiefly of the"
12128,II,"successive, not the synchronous kind, and whether successive or"
12129,II,"synchronous, are mostly casual."
12130,II,
12131,II,"To the man of science, again, or of business, objects group themselves"
12132,II,according to the artificial classifications which the understanding
12133,II,has voluntarily made for the convenience of thought or of practice.
12134,II,"But where any of the impressions are vivid and intense, the"
12135,II,associations into which these enter are the ruling ones: it being a
12136,II,"well-known law of association, that the stronger a feeling is, the"
12137,II,more quickly and strongly it associates itself with any other object
12138,II,"or feeling. Where, therefore, nature has given strong feelings, and"
12139,II,education has not created factitious tendencies stronger than the
12140,II,"natural ones, the prevailing associations will be those which connect"
12141,II,"objects and ideas with emotions, and with each other through the"
12142,II,"intervention of emotions. Thoughts and images will be linked together,"
12143,II,according to the similarity of the feelings which cling to them. A
12144,II,thought will introduce a thought by first introducing a feeling which
12145,II,is allied with it. At the centre of each group of thoughts or images
12146,II,will be found a feeling; and the thoughts or images will be there only
12147,II,because the feeling was there. The combinations which the mind puts
12148,II,"together, the pictures which it paints, the wholes which Imagination"
12149,II,"constructs out of the materials supplied by Fancy, will be indebted to"
12150,II,"some dominant _feeling_, not as in other natures to a dominant"
12151,II,"_thought_, for their unity and consistency of character, for what"
12152,II,distinguishes them from incoherencies.
12153,II,
12154,II,"The difference, then, between the poetry of a poet, and the poetry of"
12155,II,"a cultivated but not naturally poetic mind, is, that in the latter,"
12156,II,with however bright a halo of feeling the thought may be surrounded
12157,II,"and glorified, the thought itself is always the conspicuous object;"
12158,II,"while the poetry of a poet is Feeling itself, employing Thought only"
12159,II,"as the medium of its expression. In the one, feeling waits upon"
12160,II,"thought; in the other, thought upon feeling. The one writer has a"
12161,II,"distinct aim, common to him with any other didactic author; he desires"
12162,II,"to convey the thought, and he conveys it clothed in the feelings which"
12163,II,"it excites in himself, or which he deems most appropriate to it. The"
12164,II,other merely pours forth the overflowing of his feelings; and all the
12165,II,thoughts which those feelings suggest are floated promiscuously along
12166,II,the stream.
12167,II,
12168,II,"It may assist in rendering our meaning intelligible, if we illustrate"
12169,II,it by a parallel between the two English authors of our own day who
12170,II,"have produced the greatest quantity of true and enduring poetry,"
12171,II,Wordsworth and Shelley. Apter instances could not be wished for; the
12172,II,"one might be cited as the type, the _exemplar_, of what the poetry of"
12173,II,culture may accomplish: the other as perhaps the most striking example
12174,II,"ever known of the poetic temperament. How different, accordingly, is"
12175,II,"the poetry of these two great writers! In Wordsworth, the poetry is"
12176,II,almost always the mere setting of a thought. The thought may be more
12177,II,"valuable than the setting, or it may be less valuable, but there can"
12178,II,be no question as to which was first in his mind: what he is impressed
12179,II,"with, and what he is anxious to impress, is some proposition, more or"
12180,II,"less distinctly conceived; some truth, or something which he deems"
12181,II,"such. He lets the thought dwell in his mind, till it excites, as is"
12182,II,"the nature of thought, other thoughts, and also such feelings as the"
12183,II,measure of his sensibility is adequate to supply. Among these thoughts
12184,II,"and feelings, had he chosen a different walk of authorship (and there"
12185,II,"are many in which he might equally have excelled), he would probably"
12186,II,have made a different selection of media for enforcing the parent
12187,II,"thought: his habits, however, being those of poetic composition, he"
12188,II,"selects in preference the strongest feelings, and the thoughts with"
12189,II,which most of feeling is naturally or habitually connected. His
12190,II,"poetry, therefore, may be defined to be, his thoughts, coloured by,"
12191,II,"and impressing themselves by means of, emotions. Such poetry,"
12192,II,Wordsworth has occupied a long life in producing. And well and wisely
12193,II,"has he so done. Criticisms, no doubt, may be made occasionally both"
12194,II,"upon the thoughts themselves, and upon the skill he has demonstrated"
12195,II,"in the choice of his media: for an affair of skill and study, in the"
12196,II,"most rigorous sense, it evidently was. But he has not laboured in"
12197,II,"vain; he has exercised, and continues to exercise, a powerful, and"
12198,II,mostly a highly beneficial influence over the formation and growth of
12199,II,not a few of the most cultivated and vigorous of the youthful minds of
12200,II,"our time, over whose heads poetry of the opposite description would"
12201,II,"have flown, for want of an original organization, physical or mental,"
12202,II,in sympathy with it.
12203,II,
12204,II,"On the other hand, Wordsworth's poetry is never bounding, never"
12205,II,ebullient; has little even of the appearance of spontaneousness: the
12206,II,well is never so full that it overflows. There is an air of calm
12207,II,"deliberateness about all he writes, which is not characteristic of the"
12208,II,"poetic temperament: his poetry seems one thing, himself another; he"
12209,II,"seems to be poetical because he wills to be so, not because he cannot"
12210,II,"help it: did he will to dismiss poetry, he need never again, it might"
12211,II,"almost seem, have a poetical thought. He never seems _possessed_ by"
12212,II,"any feeling; no emotion seems ever so strong as to have entire sway,"
12213,II,"for the time being, over the current of his thoughts. He never, even"
12214,II,"for the space of a few stanzas, appears entirely given up to"
12215,II,"exultation, or grief, or pity, or love, or admiration, or devotion, or"
12216,II,"even animal spirits. He now and then, though seldom, attempts to write"
12217,II,"as if he were: and never, we think, without leaving an impression of"
12218,II,poverty: as the brook which on nearly level ground quite fills its
12219,II,"banks, appears but a thread when running rapidly down a precipitous"
12220,II,"declivity. He has feeling enough to form a decent, graceful, even"
12221,II,beautiful decoration to a thought which is in itself interesting and
12222,II,moving; but not so much as suffices to stir up the soul by mere
12223,II,"sympathy with itself in its simplest manifestation, nor enough to"
12224,II,summon up that array of 'thoughts of power' which in a richly stored
12225,II,mind always attends the call of really intense feeling. It is for this
12226,II,"reason, doubtless, that the genius of Wordsworth is essentially"
12227,II,"unlyrical. Lyric poetry, as it was the earliest kind, is also, if the"
12228,II,"view we are now taking of poetry be correct, more eminently and"
12229,II,peculiarly poetry than any other: it is the poetry most natural to a
12230,II,"really poetic temperament, and least capable of being successfully"
12231,II,imitated by one not so endowed by nature.
12232,II,
12233,II,"Shelley is the very reverse of all this. Where Wordsworth is strong,"
12234,II,"he is weak; where Wordsworth is weak, he is strong. Culture, that"
12235,II,culture by which Wordsworth has reared from his own inward nature the
12236,II,"richest harvest ever brought forth by a soil of so little depth, is"
12237,II,"precisely what was wanting to Shelley: or let us rather say, he had"
12238,II,"not, at the period of his deplorably early death, reached sufficiently"
12239,II,"far in that intellectual progression of which he was capable, and"
12240,II,"which, if it has done so much for greatly inferior natures, might have"
12241,II,"made of him the most perfect, as he was already the most gifted of our"
12242,II,"poets. For him, voluntary mental discipline had done little: the"
12243,II,vividness of his emotions and of his sensations had done all. He
12244,II,"seldom follows up an idea; it starts into life, summons from the"
12245,II,"fairy-land of his inexhaustible fancy some three or four bold images,"
12246,II,"then vanishes, and straight he is off on the wings of some casual"
12247,II,association into quite another sphere. He had scarcely yet acquired
12248,II,the consecutiveness of thought necessary for a long poem; his more
12249,II,ambitious compositions too often resemble the scattered fragments of a
12250,II,"mirror; colours brilliant as life, single images without end, but no"
12251,II,picture. It is only when under the overruling influence of some one
12252,II,"state of feeling, either actually experienced, or summoned up in the"
12253,II,"vividness of reality by a fervid imagination, that he writes as a"
12254,II,great poet; unity of feeling being to him the harmonizing principle
12255,II,"which a central idea is to minds of another class, and supplying the"
12256,II,coherency and consistency which would else have been wanting. Thus it
12257,II,"is in many of his smaller, and especially his lyrical poems. They are"
12258,II,"obviously written to exhale, perhaps to relieve, a state of feeling,"
12259,II,"or of conception of feeling, almost oppressive from its vividness. The"
12260,II,"thoughts and imagery are suggested by the feeling, and are such as it"
12261,II,finds unsought. The state of feeling may be either of soul or of
12262,II,"sense, or oftener (might we not say invariably?) of both: for the"
12263,II,"poetic temperament is usually, perhaps always, accompanied by"
12264,II,exquisite senses. The exciting cause may be either an object or an
12265,II,"idea. But whatever of sensation enters into the feeling, must not be"
12266,II,"local, or consciously organic; it is a condition of the whole frame,"
12267,II,not of a part only. Like the state of sensation produced by a fine
12268,II,"climate, or indeed like all strongly pleasurable or painful sensations"
12269,II,"in an impassioned nature, it pervades the entire nervous system."
12270,II,"States of feeling, whether sensuous or spiritual, which thus possess"
12271,II,"the whole being, are the fountains of that which we have called the"
12272,II,poetry of poets; and which is little else than a pouring forth of the
12273,II,thoughts and images that pass across the mind while some permanent
12274,II,state of feeling is occupying it.
12275,II,
12276,II,"To the same original fineness of organization, Shelley was doubtless"
12277,II,"indebted for another of his rarest gifts, that exuberance of imagery,"
12278,II,"which when unrepressed, as in many of his poems it is, amounts to a"
12279,II,"fault. The susceptibility of his nervous system, which made his"
12280,II,"emotions intense, made also the impressions of his external senses"
12281,II,"deep and clear; and agreeably to the law of association by which, as"
12282,II,"already remarked, the strongest impressions are those which associate"
12283,II,"themselves the most easily and strongly, these vivid sensations were"
12284,II,readily recalled to mind by all objects or thoughts which had
12285,II,"co-existed with them, and by all feelings which in any degree"
12286,II,resembled them. Never did a fancy so teem with sensuous imagery as
12287,II,"Shelley's. Wordsworth economizes an image, and detains it until he has"
12288,II,"distilled all the poetry out of it, and it will not yield a drop more:"
12289,II,Shelley lavishes his with a profusion which is unconscious because it
12290,II,is inexhaustible.
12291,II,
12292,II,"If, then, the maxim _Nascitur poeta_ mean, either that the power of"
12293,II,producing poetical compositions is a peculiar faculty which the poet
12294,II,"brings into the world with him, which grows with his growth like any"
12295,II,"of his bodily powers, and is as independent of culture as his height,"
12296,II,and his complexion; or that any natural peculiarity whatever is
12297,II,"implied in producing poetry, real poetry, and in any quantity--such"
12298,II,"poetry too, as, to the majority of educated and intelligent readers,"
12299,II,"shall appear quite as good as, or even better than, any other; in"
12300,II,"either sense the doctrine is false. And nevertheless, there _is_"
12301,II,poetry which could not emanate but from a mental and physical
12302,II,"constitution peculiar, not in the kind, but in the degree of its"
12303,II,susceptibility: a constitution which makes its possessor capable of
12304,II,"greater happiness than mankind in general, and also of greater"
12305,II,"unhappiness; and because greater, so also more various. And such"
12306,II,"poetry, to all who know enough of nature to own it as being in nature,"
12307,II,"is much more poetry, is poetry in a far higher sense, than any other;"
12308,II,"since the common element of all poetry, that which constitutes poetry,"
12309,II,"human feeling, enters far more largely into this than into the poetry"
12310,II,of culture. Not only because the natures which we have called
12311,II,"poetical, really feel more, and consequently have more feeling to"
12312,II,"express; but because, the capacity of feeling being so great, feeling,"
12313,II,"when excited and not voluntarily resisted, seizes the helm of their"
12314,II,"thoughts, and the succession of ideas and images becomes the mere"
12315,II,"utterance of an emotion; not, as in other natures, the emotion a mere"
12316,II,ornamental colouring of the thought.
12317,II,
12318,II,Ordinary education and the ordinary course of life are constantly at
12319,II,"work counteracting this quality of mind, and substituting habits more"
12320,II,suitable to their own ends: if instead of substituting they were
12321,II,"content to superadd, there would be nothing to complain of. But when"
12322,II,"will education consist, not in repressing any mental faculty or power,"
12323,II,"from the uncontrolled action of which danger is apprehended, but in"
12324,II,training up to its proper strength the corrective and antagonist
12325,II,power?
12326,II,
12327,II,"In whomsoever the quality which we have described exists, and is not"
12328,II,"stifled, that person is a poet. Doubtless he is a greater poet in"
12329,II,"proportion as the fineness of his perceptions, whether of sense or of"
12330,II,"internal consciousness, furnishes him with an ampler supply of lovely"
12331,II,"images--the vigour and richness of his intellect, with a greater"
12332,II,abundance of moving thoughts. For it is through these thoughts and
12333,II,"images that the feeling speaks, and through their impressiveness that"
12334,II,"it impresses itself, and finds response in other hearts; and from"
12335,II,these media of transmitting it (contrary to the laws of physical
12336,II,nature) increase of intensity is reflected back upon the feeling
12337,II,"itself. But all these it is possible to have, and not be a poet; they"
12338,II,"are mere materials, which the poet shares in common with other people."
12339,II,"What constitutes the poet is not the imagery nor the thoughts, nor"
12340,II,"even the feelings, but the law according to which they are called up."
12341,II,"He is a poet, not because he has ideas of any particular kind, but"
12342,II,because the succession of big ideas is subordinate to the course of
12343,II,his emotions.
12344,II,
12345,II,"Many who have never acknowledged this in theory, bear testimony to it"
12346,II,"in their particular judgements. In listening to an oration, or reading"
12347,II,"a written discourse not professedly poetical, when do we begin to feel"
12348,II,that the speaker or author is putting off the character of the orator
12349,II,"or the prose writer, and is passing into the poet? Not when he begins"
12350,II,"to show strong feeling; _then_ we merely say, he is in earnest, he"
12351,II,feels what he says; still less when he expresses himself in imagery;
12352,II,"then, unless illustration be manifestly his sole object, we are apt to"
12353,II,"say, this is affectation. It is when the feeling (instead of passing"
12354,II,"away, or, if it continue, letting the train of thoughts run on"
12355,II,exactly as they would have done if there were no influence at work but
12356,II,the mere intellect) becomes itself the originator of another train of
12357,II,"association, which expels or blends with the former; when (for"
12358,II,"example) either his words, or the mode of their arrangement, are such"
12359,II,"as we spontaneously use only when in a state of excitement, proving"
12360,II,that the mind is at least as much occupied by a passive state of its
12361,II,"own feelings, as by the desire of attaining the premeditated end which"
12362,II,the discourse has in view.[35]
12363,II,
12364,II,"[35] And this, we may remark by the way, seems to point to"
12365,II,the true theory of poetic diction; and to suggest the true
12366,II,answer to as much as is erroneous of Wordsworth's celebrated
12367,II,"doctrine on that subject. For on the one hand, _all_ language"
12368,II,"which is the natural expression of feeling, is really"
12369,II,"poetical, and will be felt as such, apart from conventional"
12370,II,"associations; but on the other, whenever intellectual culture"
12371,II,has afforded a choice between several modes of expressing the
12372,II,"same emotion, the stronger the feeling is, the more naturally"
12373,II,and certainly will it prefer the language which is most
12374,II,"peculiarly appropriated to itself, and kept sacred from the"
12375,II,contact of more vulgar objects of contemplation.
12376,II,
12377,II,"Our judgements of authors who lay actual claim to the title of poets,"
12378,II,"follow the same principle. Whenever, after a writer's meaning is fully"
12379,II,"understood, it is still matter of reasoning and discussion whether he"
12380,II,"is a poet or not, he will be found to be wanting in the characteristic"
12381,II,"peculiarity of association so often adverted to. When, on the"
12382,II,"contrary, after reading or hearing one or two passages, we"
12383,II,"instinctively and without hesitation cry out, 'This is a poet', the"
12384,II,"probability is, that the passages are strongly marked with this"
12385,II,"peculiar quality. And we may add that in such case, a critic who, not"
12386,II,"having sufficient feeling to respond to the poetry, is also without"
12387,II,"sufficient philosophy to understand it though he feel it not, will be"
12388,II,"apt to pronounce, not 'this is prose', but 'this is exaggeration',"
12389,II,"'this is mysticism', or, 'this is nonsense'."
12390,II,
12391,II,"Although a philosopher cannot, by culture, make himself, in the"
12392,II,"peculiar sense in which we now use the term, a poet, unless at least"
12393,II,he have that peculiarity of nature which would probably have made
12394,II,"poetry his earliest pursuit; a poet may always, by culture, make"
12395,II,himself a philosopher. The poetic laws of association are by no means
12396,II,incompatible with the more ordinary laws; are by no means such as
12397,II,"_must_ have their course, even though a deliberate purpose require"
12398,II,their suspension. If the peculiarities of the poetic temperament were
12399,II,"uncontrollable in any poet, they might be supposed so in Shelley; yet"
12400,II,"how powerfully, in the _Cenci_, does he coerce and restrain all the"
12401,II,"characteristic qualities of his genius; what severe simplicity, in"
12402,II,place of his usual barbaric splendour; how rigidly does he keep the
12403,II,feelings and the imagery in subordination to the thought.
12404,II,
12405,II,"The investigation of nature requires no habits or qualities of mind,"
12406,II,but such as may always be acquired by industry and mental activity.
12407,II,"Because at one time the mind may be so given up to a state of feeling,"
12408,II,that the succession of its ideas is determined by the present
12409,II,"enjoyment or suffering which pervades it, this is no reason but that"
12410,II,"in the calm retirement of study, when under no peculiar excitement"
12411,II,"either of the outward or of the inward sense, it may form any"
12412,II,"combinations, or pursue any trains of ideas, which are most conducive"
12413,II,"to the purposes of philosophic inquiry; and may, while in that state,"
12414,II,"form deliberate convictions, from which no excitement will afterwards"
12415,II,make it swerve. Might we not go even further than this? We shall not
12416,II,pause to ask whether it be not a misunderstanding of the nature of
12417,II,passionate feeling to imagine that it is inconsistent with calmness;
12418,II,"whether they who so deem of it, do not mistake passion in the militant"
12419,II,"or antagonistic state, for the type of passion universally; do not"
12420,II,"confound passion struggling towards an outward object, with passion"
12421,II,brooding over itself. But without entering into this deeper
12422,II,"investigation; that capacity of strong feeling, which is supposed"
12423,II,"necessarily to disturb the judgement, is also the material out of"
12424,II,"which all _motives_ are made; the motives, consequently, which lead"
12425,II,human beings to the pursuit of truth. The greater the individual's
12426,II,"capability of happiness and of misery, the stronger interest has that"
12427,II,"individual in arriving at truth; and when once that interest is felt,"
12428,II,"an impassioned nature is sure to pursue this, as to pursue any other"
12429,II,"object, with greater ardour; for energy of character is commonly the"
12430,II,"offspring of strong feeling. If, therefore, the most impassioned"
12431,II,"natures do not ripen into the most powerful intellects, it is always"
12432,II,"from defect of culture, or something wrong in the circumstances by"
12433,II,which the being has originally or successively been surrounded.
12434,II,"Undoubtedly strong feelings require a strong intellect to carry them,"
12435,II,"as more sail requires more ballast: and when, from neglect, or bad"
12436,II,"education, that strength is wanting, no wonder if the grandest and"
12437,II,swiftest vessels make the most utter wreck.
12438,II,
12439,II,"Where, as in some of our older poets, a poetic nature has been united"
12440,II,"with logical and scientific culture, the peculiarity of association"
12441,II,arising from the finer nature so perpetually alternates with the
12442,II,associations attainable by commoner natures trained to high
12443,II,"perfection, that its own particular law is not so conspicuously"
12444,II,"characteristic of the result produced, as in a poet like Shelley, to"
12445,II,"whom systematic intellectual culture, in a measure proportioned to the"
12446,II,"intensity of his own nature, has been wanting. Whether the superiority"
12447,II,will naturally be on the side of the philosopher-poet or of the mere
12448,II,"poet--whether the writings of the one ought, as a whole, to be truer,"
12449,II,"and their influence more beneficent, than those of the other--is too"
12450,II,obvious in principle to need statement: it would be absurd to doubt
12451,II,whether two endowments are better than one; whether truth is more
12452,II,"certainly arrived at by two processes, verifying and correcting each"
12453,II,"other, than by one alone. Unfortunately, in practice the matter is not"
12454,II,"quite so simple; there the question often is, which is least"
12455,II,"prejudicial to the intellect, uncultivation or malcultivation. For, as"
12456,II,long as education consists chiefly of the mere inculcation of
12457,II,"traditional opinions, many of which, from the mere fact that the human"
12458,II,"intellect has not yet reached perfection, must necessarily be false;"
12459,II,"so long as even those who are best taught, are rather taught to know"
12460,II,"the thoughts of others than to think, it is not always clear that the"
12461,II,poet of acquired ideas has the advantage over him whose feeling has
12462,II,been his sole teacher. For the depth and durability of wrong as well
12463,II,as of right impressions is proportional to the fineness of the
12464,II,material; and they who have the greatest capacity of natural feeling
12465,II,are generally those whose artificial feelings are the strongest.
12466,II,"Hence, doubtless, among other reasons, it is, that in an age of"
12467,II,"revolutions in opinion, the co-temporary poets, those at least who"
12468,II,"deserve the name, those who have any individuality of character, if"
12469,II,"they are not before their age, are almost sure to be behind it. An"
12470,II,observation curiously verified all over Europe in the present century.
12471,II,Nor let it be thought disparaging. However urgent may be the necessity
12472,II,"for a breaking up of old modes of belief, the most strong-minded and"
12473,II,"discerning, next to those who head the movement, are generally those"
12474,II,who bring up the rear of it.

12513,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",a wild admiration for the _Giaour_ or the _Corsair_ (and it is
12514,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","suitable to his age, and he should not be reproached for it), but the"

12533,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",the sole result of the poetry of that time is the harm which it has
12534,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",done. It degraded for a time the whole character of the art. It said

12603,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","think much of, but which _he_ knows by virtue of his art will look"

12609,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","art; meaning not only that it is good, but that its goodness is such"

12713,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",is with _types_; and those types are mirrored in reality. As a painter

12726,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",The first conversation of Goethe and Schiller illustrates this
12727,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",conception of the poet's art. Goethe was at that time prejudiced
12728,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","against Schiller, we must remember, partly from what he considered the"

12733,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",had joyfully embraced: it unfolded the extraordinary qualities which
12734,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",Nature had implanted in him; and in the lively feeling of freedom and
12735,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","self-direction, he showed himself unthankful to the Great Mother, who"
12736,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",surely had not acted like a step-dame towards him. Instead of viewing
12737,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","her as self-subsisting, as producing with a living force, and"

12741,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",directly apply to myself: they exhibited my confession of faith in a
12742,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",false light; and I felt that if written without particular attention
12743,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","to me they were still worse; for in that case, the vast chasm which"
12744,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","lay between us, gaped but so much the more distinctly.' After a casual"

12757,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","awakening; but I smothered it, and merely said: ""I was happy to find"
12758,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","that I had got ideas without knowing it, nay that I saw them before my"

12779,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","specimens aim, the class-characteristic in which they all share, but"
12780,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",which none shows forth fully: Goethe was right in searching for this
12781,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",in reality and nature; Schiller was right in saying that it was an
12782,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","'idea', a transcending notion to which approximations could be found"
12783,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","in experience, but only approximations--which could not be found there"
12784,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","itself. Goethe, as a poet, rightly felt the primary necessity of"

12786,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",felt its imperfection.
12787,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",
12788,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","But in these delicate matters, it is easy to misapprehend. There is,"
12789,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","undoubtedly, a sort of poetry which is produced as it were out of the"
12790,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",author's mind. The description of the poet's own moods and feelings is
12791,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",a common sort of poetry--perhaps the commonest sort. But the
12792,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","peculiarity of such cases is, that the poet does not describe himself"
12793,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",_as_ himself: autobiography is not his object; he takes himself as a
12794,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","specimen of human nature; he describes, not himself, but a"
12795,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",distillation of himself: he takes such of his moods as are most
12796,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","characteristic, as most typify certain moods of certain men, or"
12797,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",certain moods of all men; he chooses preponderant feelings of special
12798,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","sorts of men, or occasional feelings of men of all sorts; but with"
12799,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","whatever other difference and diversity, the essence is that such"
12800,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","self-describing poets describe what is _in_ them, but not _peculiar_"
12801,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","to them,--what is generic, not what is special and individual. Gray's"
12802,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","_Elegy_ describes a mood which Gray felt more than other men, but"
12803,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","which most others, perhaps all others, feel too. It is more popular,"
12804,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","perhaps, than any English poem, because that sort of feeling is the"
12805,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)","most diffused of high feelings, and because Gray added to a singular"
12806,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",nicety of fancy an habitual proneness to a _contemplative_--a
12807,"PURE, ORNATE, AND GROTESQUE ART IN ENGLISH POETRY (1864)",discerning but unbiassed--meditation on death and on life. Other poets

12943,TO THE SAME,"privileged to speak of his own poems, but no other critic could speak"
12944,TO THE SAME,so and not be laughed at.
12945,TO THE SAME,
12946,TO THE SAME,We are disposed to believe that no very sharp definition can be
12947,TO THE SAME,given--at least in the present state of the critical art--of the
12948,TO THE SAME,boundary line between poetry and other sorts of imaginative
12949,TO THE SAME,delineation. Between the undoubted dominions of the two kinds there is
12950,TO THE SAME,a debateable land; everybody is agreed that the _Oedipus at Colonus_
12951,TO THE SAME,_is_ poetry: every one is agreed that the wonderful appearance of Mrs.
12952,TO THE SAME,Veal is _not_ poetry. But the exact line which separates grave novels
12953,TO THE SAME,"in verse like _Aylmer's Field_ or _Enoch Arden_, from grave novels not"
12954,TO THE SAME,"in verse like _Silas Marner_ or _Adam Bede_, we own we cannot draw"
12955,TO THE SAME,"with any confidence. Nor, perhaps, is it very important; whether a"
12956,TO THE SAME,narrative is thrown into verse or not certainly depends in part on the
12957,TO THE SAME,"taste of the age, and in part on its mechanical helps. Verse is the"
12958,TO THE SAME,"only mechanical help to the memory in rude times, and there is little"
12959,TO THE SAME,"writing till a cheap something is found to write upon, and a cheap"
12960,TO THE SAME,something to write with. Poetry--verse at least--is the literature of
12961,TO THE SAME,_all work_ in early ages; it is only later ages which write in what
12962,TO THE SAME,_they_ think a natural and simple prose. There are other casual
12963,TO THE SAME,influences in the matter too; but they are not material now. We need
12964,TO THE SAME,"only say here that poetry, because it has a more marked rhythm than"
12965,TO THE SAME,"prose, must be more intense in meaning and more concise in style than"
12966,TO THE SAME,prose. People expect a 'marked rhythm' to imply something worth
12967,TO THE SAME,marking; if it fails to do so they are disappointed. They are
12968,TO THE SAME,displeased at the visible waste of a powerful instrument; they call it
12969,TO THE SAME,"'doggerel,' and rightly call it, for the metrical expression of full"
12970,TO THE SAME,thought and eager feeling--the burst of metre--incident to high
12971,TO THE SAME,"imagination, should not be wasted on petty matters which prose does as"
12972,TO THE SAME,"well,--which it does better--which it suits by its very limpness and"
12973,TO THE SAME,"weakness, whose small changes it follows more easily, and to whose"
12974,TO THE SAME,"lowest details it can fully and without effort degrade itself. Verse,"
12975,TO THE SAME,"too, should be _more concise_, for long-continued rhythm tends to jade"
12976,TO THE SAME,"the mind, just as brief rhythm tends to attract the attention. Poetry"
12977,TO THE SAME,"should be memorable and emphatic, intense, and _soon over_."
12978,TO THE SAME,
12979,TO THE SAME,"The great divisions of poetry, and of all other literary art, arise"
12980,TO THE SAME,from the different modes in which these _types_--these characteristic
12981,TO THE SAME,"men, these characteristic feelings--may be variously described. There"
12982,TO THE SAME,are three principal modes which we shall attempt to describe--the
12983,TO THE SAME,"_pure_, which is sometimes, but not very wisely, called the classical;"
12984,TO THE SAME,"the _ornate_, which is also unwisely called romantic; and the"
12985,TO THE SAME,"_grotesque_, which might be called the mediaeval. We will describe the"
12986,TO THE SAME,"nature of these a little. Criticism we know must be brief--not, like"
12987,TO THE SAME,"poetry, because its charm is too intense to be sustained--but on the"
12988,TO THE SAME,"contrary, because its interest is too weak to be prolonged; but"
12989,TO THE SAME,"elementary criticism, if an evil, is a necessary evil; a little while"
12990,TO THE SAME,"spent among the simple principles of art is the first condition, the"
12991,TO THE SAME,"absolute pre-requisite, for surely apprehending and wisely judging the"
12992,TO THE SAME,complete embodiments and miscellaneous forms of actual literature.
12993,TO THE SAME,
12994,TO THE SAME,The definition of _pure_ literature is that it describes the type in
12995,TO THE SAME,"its simplicity, we mean, with the exact amount of accessory"
12996,TO THE SAME,circumstance which is necessary to bring it before the mind in
12997,TO THE SAME,"finished perfection, and _no more_ than that amount. The _type_ needs"
12998,TO THE SAME,some accessories from its nature--a picturesque landscape does not
12999,TO THE SAME,consist wholly of picturesque features. There is a setting of
13000,TO THE SAME,"surroundings--as the Americans would say, of _fixings_--without which"
13001,TO THE SAME,"the reality is not itself. By a traditional mode of speech, as soon as"
13002,TO THE SAME,we see a picture in which a complete effect is produced by detail so
13003,TO THE SAME,"rare and so harmonized as to escape us, we say 'how classical'. The"
13004,TO THE SAME,"whole which is to be seen appears at once and through the detail, but"
13005,TO THE SAME,the detail itself is not seen: we do not think of that which gives us
13006,TO THE SAME,the idea; we are absorbed in the idea itself. Just so in literature
13007,TO THE SAME,"the pure art is that which works with the fewest strokes; the fewest,"
13008,TO THE SAME,"that is, for its purpose, for its aim is to call up and bring home to"
13009,TO THE SAME,"men an idea, a form, a character, and if that idea be twisted, that"
13010,TO THE SAME,"form be involved, that character perplexed, many strokes of literary"
13011,TO THE SAME,art will be needful. Pure art does not mutilate its object: it
13012,TO THE SAME,represents it as fully as is possible with the slightest effort which
13013,TO THE SAME,"is possible: it shrinks from no needful circumstances, as little as it"
13014,TO THE SAME,inserts any which are needless. The precise peculiarity is not merely
13015,TO THE SAME,that no incidental circumstance is inserted which does not tell on the
13016,TO THE SAME,main design: no art is fit to be called _art_ which permits a stroke
13017,TO THE SAME,to be put in without an object; but that only the minimum of such
13018,TO THE SAME,circumstance is inserted at all. The form is sometimes said to be
13019,TO THE SAME,"bare, the accessories are sometimes said to be invisible, because the"
13020,TO THE SAME,appendages are so choice that the shape only is perceived.
13021,TO THE SAME,
13022,TO THE SAME,The English literature undoubtedly contains much impure literature;
13023,TO THE SAME,impure in its style if not in its meaning: but it also contains one
13024,TO THE SAME,"great, one nearly perfect, model of the pure style in the literary"
13025,TO THE SAME,"expression of typical _sentiment_; and one not perfect, but gigantic"
13026,TO THE SAME,and close approximation to perfection in the pure delineation of
13027,TO THE SAME,"objective character. Wordsworth, perhaps, comes as near to choice"
13028,TO THE SAME,"purity of style in sentiment as is possible; Milton, with exceptions"
13029,TO THE SAME,"and conditions to be explained, approaches perfection by the"
13030,TO THE SAME,strenuous purity with which he depicts character.
13031,TO THE SAME,
13032,TO THE SAME,"A wit once said, that '_pretty_ women had more features than"
13033,TO THE SAME,"_beautiful_ women', and though the expression may be criticized, the"
13034,TO THE SAME,meaning is correct. Pretty women seem to have a great number of
13035,TO THE SAME,"attractive points, each of which attracts your attention, and each one"
13036,TO THE SAME,of which you remember afterwards; yet these points have not _grown
13037,TO THE SAME,"together_, their features have not linked themselves into a single"
13038,TO THE SAME,inseparable whole. But a beautiful woman is a whole as she is; you no
13039,TO THE SAME,more take her to pieces than a Greek statue; she is not an aggregate
13040,TO THE SAME,"of divisible charms, she is a charm in herself. Such ever is the"
13041,TO THE SAME,"dividing test of pure art; if you catch yourself admiring its details,"
13042,TO THE SAME,it is defective; you ought to think of it as a single whole which you
13043,TO THE SAME,"must remember, which you must admire, which somehow subdues you while"
13044,TO THE SAME,"you admire it, which is a 'possession' to you 'for ever'."
13045,TO THE SAME,
13046,TO THE SAME,Of course no individual poem embodies this ideal perfectly; of course
13047,TO THE SAME,"every human word and phrase has its imperfections, and if we choose an"
13048,TO THE SAME,"instance to illustrate that ideal, the instance has scarcely a fair"
13049,TO THE SAME,chance. By contrasting it with the ideal we suggest its imperfections;
13050,TO THE SAME,"by protruding it as an example, we turn on its defectiveness the"
13051,TO THE SAME,microscope of criticism. Yet these two sonnets of Wordsworth may be
13052,TO THE SAME,"fitly read in this place, not because they are quite without faults,"
13053,TO THE SAME,or because they are the very best examples of their kind of style; but
13054,TO THE SAME,because they are _luminous_ examples; the compactness of the sonnet
13055,TO THE SAME,"and the gravity of the sentiment, hedging in the thoughts,"
13056,TO THE SAME,"restraining the fancy, and helping to maintain a singleness of"
13057,TO THE SAME,expression:

13112,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of a city about to awaken and be alive, are the only ideas left in our"
13113,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",mind. To Wordsworth has been vouchsafed the last grace of the
13114,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","self-denying artist; you think neither of him nor his style, but you"
13115,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","cannot help thinking of--you _must_ recall--the exact phrase, the"

13118,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Milton's purity is more eager. In the most exciting parts of

13122,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of the world. But Milton though always a scholar by trade, though"
13123,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","solitary in old age, was through life intent on great affairs, lived"
13124,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","close to great scenes, watched a revolution, and if not an actor in"
13125,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","it, was at least secretary to the actors. He was familiar--by daily"
13126,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",experience and habitual sympathy--with the earnest debate of arduous
13127,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","questions, on which the life and death of the speakers certainly"
13128,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","depended, on which the weal or woe of the country perhaps depended."
13129,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",He knew how profoundly the individual character of the speakers--their
13130,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",inner and real nature--modifies their opinion on such questions; he
13131,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",knew how surely that nature will appear in the expression of them.
13132,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","This great experience, fashioned by a fine imagination, gives to the"
13133,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",debate of Satanic Council in Pandaemonium its reality and its life. It
13134,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","is a debate in the Long Parliament, and though the _theme_ of"
13135,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",_Paradise Lost_ obliged Milton to side with the monarchical element in
13136,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the universe, his old habits are often too much for him; and his real"
13137,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",sympathy--the impetus and energy of his nature--side with the
13138,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",rebellious element. For the purposes of art this is much better--of a
13139,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","court, a poet can make but little; of a heaven he can make very"
13140,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","little, but of a courtly heaven, such as Milton conceived, he can make"
13141,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",nothing at all. The idea of a court and the idea of a heaven are so
13142,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","radically different, that a distinct combination of them is always"
13143,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","grotesque and often ludicrous. _Paradise Lost_, as a whole, is"
13144,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",radically tainted by a vicious principle. It professes to justify the
13145,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","ways of God to man, to account for sin and death, and it tells you"
13146,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",that the whole originated in a political event; in a court squabble as
13147,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to a particular act of patronage and the due or undue promotion of an
13148,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","eldest son. Satan may have been wrong, but on Milton's theory he had"
13149,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",an _arguable_ case at least. There was something arbitrary in the
13150,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",promotion; there were little symptoms of a job; in _Paradise Lost_ it
13151,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","is always clear that the devils are the weaker, but it is never clear"
13152,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",that the angels are the better. Milton's sympathy and his imagination
13153,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","slip back to the Puritan rebels whom he loved, and desert the courtly"
13154,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",angels whom he could not love although he praised. There is no wonder
13155,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","that Milton's hell is better than his heaven, for he hated officials"
13156,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and he loved rebels, for he employs his genius below, and accumulates"
13157,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",his pedantry above. On the great debate in Pandaemonium all his genius
13158,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","is concentrated. The question is very practical; it is, 'What are we"
13159,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","devils to do, now we have lost heaven?' Satan who presides over and"
13160,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",manipulates the assembly; Moloch
13161,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13162,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the fiercest spirit
13163,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair,"
13164,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13165,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","who wants to fight again; Belial, 'the man of the world', who does not"
13166,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","want to fight any more; Mammon, who is for commencing an industrial"

13173,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","distinct as so many statues. Even Belial, 'the man of the world', the"
13174,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sort of man with whom Milton had least sympathy, is perfectly painted."
13175,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",An inferior artist would have made the actor who 'counselled ignoble
13176,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","ease and peaceful sloth', a degraded and ugly creature; but Milton"
13177,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",knew better. He knew that low notions require a better garb than high
13178,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","notions. Human nature is not a high thing, but at least it has a high"
13179,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","idea of itself; it will not accept mean maxims, unless they are gilded"
13180,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and made beautiful. A prophet in goatskin may cry, 'Repent, repent',"
13181,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","but it takes 'purple and fine linen' to be able to say, 'Continue in"
13182,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","your sins'. The world vanquishes with its speciousness and its show,"
13183,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and the orator who is to persuade men to worldliness must have a share
13184,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",in them. Milton well knew this; after the warlike speech of the fierce
13185,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Moloch he introduces a brighter and a more graceful spirit:
13186,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13187,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","He ended frowning, and his look denounced"
13188,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Desp'rate revenge, and battle dangerous"
13189,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",To less than Gods. On th' other side up rose

13269,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which Milton introduces them, embody, in as short a space as possible,"
13270,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","with as much perfection as possible, the delineation of the type of"
13271,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","character common at all times, dangerous in many times, sure to come"
13272,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","to the surface in moments of difficulty, and never more dangerous than"
13273,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","then. As Milton describes, it is one among several _typical_"
13274,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","characters which will ever have their place in great councils, which"
13275,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","will ever be heard at important decisions, which are part of the"
13276,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",characteristic and inalienable whole of this statesmanlike world. The
13277,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",debate in Pandaemonium is a debate among these typical characters at
13278,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the greatest conceivable crisis, and with adjuncts of solemnity which"
13279,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",no other situation could rival. It is the greatest _classical_
13280,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","triumph, the highest achievement of the pure _style_ in English"
13281,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",literature; it is the greatest description of the highest and most
13282,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",typical characters with the most choice circumstances and in the
13283,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",fewest words.
13284,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13285,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",It is not unremarkable that we should find in Milton and in _Paradise
13286,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Lost_ the best specimen of pure style. He was schoolmaster in a
13287,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","pedantic age, and there is nothing so unclassical--nothing so impure"
13288,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",in style--as pedantry. The out-of-door conversational life of Athens
13289,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",was as opposed to bookish scholasticism as a life can be. The most
13290,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",perfect books have been written not by those who thought much of
13291,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","books, but by those who thought little, by those who were under the"
13292,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","restraint of a sensitive talking world, to which books had contributed"
13293,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","something, and a various eager life the rest. Milton is generally"
13294,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","unclassical in spirit where he is learned, and naturally, because the"
13295,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","purest poets do not overlay their conceptions with book knowledge, and"
13296,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the classical poets, having in comparison no books, were under little"
13297,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",temptation to impair the purity of their style by the accumulation of
13298,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","their research. Over and above this, there is in Milton, and a little"
13299,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in Wordsworth also, one defect which is in the highest degree faulty"
13300,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and unclassical, which mars the effect and impairs the perfection of"
13301,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the pure style. There is a want of _spontaneity_, and a sense of"
13302,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",effort. It has been happily said that Plato's words must have _grown_
13303,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",into their places. No one would say so of Milton or even of
13304,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Wordsworth. About both of them there is a taint of duty; a vicious
13305,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sense of the good man's task. Things seem right where they are, but"
13306,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",they seem to be put where they are. _Flexibility_ is essential to the
13307,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",consummate perfection of the pure style because the sensation of the
13308,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",poet's efforts carries away our thoughts from his achievements. We are
13309,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",admiring his labours when we should be enjoying his words. But this is
13310,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","a defect in those two writers, not a defect in pure art. Of course it"
13311,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",is more difficult to write in few words than to write in many; to take
13312,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the best adjuncts, and those only, for what you have to say, instead"
13313,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",of using all which comes to hand; it _is_ an additional labour if you
13314,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","write verses in a morning, to spend the rest of the day in _choosing_,"
13315,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",or making those verses fewer. But a perfect artist in the pure style
13316,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","is as effortless and as natural as in any style, perhaps is more so."
13317,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Take the well-known lines:
13318,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13319,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",There was a little lawny islet
13320,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","By anemone and violet,"
13321,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Like mosaic, paven:"
13322,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And its roof was flowers and leaves
13323,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Which the summer's breath enweaves,"
13324,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Where nor sun, nor showers, nor breeze,"
13325,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Pierce the pines and tallest trees,"
13326,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Each a gem engraven;--
13327,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Girt by many an azure wave
13328,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",With which the clouds and mountains pave
13329,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",A lake's blue chasm.
13330,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13331,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Shelley had many merits and many defects. This is not the place for a
13332,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",complete or indeed for _any_ estimate of him. But one excellence is
13333,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",most evident. His words are as flexible as any words; the rhythm of
13334,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",some modulating air seems to move them into their place without a
13335,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",struggle by the poet and almost without his knowledge. This is the
13336,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","perfection of pure art, to embody typical conceptions in the choicest,"
13337,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the fewest accidents, to embody them so that each of these accidents"
13338,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","may produce its full effect, and so to embody them without effort."
13339,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13340,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",The extreme opposite to this pure art is what may be called ornate
13341,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",art. This species of art aims also at giving a delineation of the
13342,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","typical idea in its perfection and its fullness, but it aims at so"
13343,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",doing in a manner most different. It wishes to surround the type with
13344,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the greatest number of circumstances which it will _bear_. It works
13345,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","not by choice and selection, but by accumulation and aggregation. The"
13346,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","idea is not, as in the pure style, presented with the least clothing"
13347,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which it will endure, but with the richest and most involved clothing"
13348,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",that it will admit.
13349,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13350,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",We are fortunate in not having to hunt out of past literature an
13351,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",illustrative specimen of the ornate style. Mr. Tennyson has just given
13352,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","one admirable in itself, and most characteristic of the defects and"
13353,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the merits of this style. The story of Enoch Arden, as he has enhanced"
13354,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and presented it, is a rich and splendid composite of imagery and"
13355,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",illustration. Yet how simple that story is in itself. A sailor who
13356,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sells fish, breaks his leg, gets dismal, gives up selling fish, goes"
13357,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","to sea, is wrecked on a desert island, stays there some years, on his"
13358,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","return finds his wife married to a miller, speaks to a landlady on the"
13359,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","subject, and dies. Told in the pure and simple, the unadorned and"
13360,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","classical style, this story would not have taken three pages, but Mr."
13361,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Tennyson has been able to make it the principal--the largest tale in
13362,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",his new volume. He has done so only by giving to every event and
13363,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",incident in the volume an accompanying commentary. He tells a great
13364,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",deal about the torrid zone which a rough sailor like Enoch Arden
13365,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",certainly would not have perceived; and he gives to the fishing
13366,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","village, to which all the characters belong, a softness and a"
13367,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",fascination which such villages scarcely possess in reality.

13403,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",description of Enoch's life before he sailed:
13404,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13405,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,"

13418,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",The essence of ornate art is in this manner to accumulate round the
13419,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","typical object, everything which can be said about it, every"
13420,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",associated thought that can be connected with it without impairing the

13423,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",The first defect which strikes a student of ornate art--the first
13424,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",which arrests the mere reader of it--is what is called a want of
13425,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","simplicity. Nothing is described as it is, everything has about it an"
13426,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","atmosphere of _something else_. The combined and associated thoughts,"
13427,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",though they set off and heighten particular ideas and aspects of the
13428,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","central conception, yet complicate it: a simple thing--'a daisy by the"
13429,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","river's brim'--is never left by itself, something else is put with it;"
13430,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",something not more connected with it than 'lion-whelp' and the
13431,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",'peacock yew-tree' are with the 'fresh fish for sale' that Enoch
13432,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",carries past them. Even in the highest cases ornate art leaves upon a
13433,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","cultured and delicate taste, the conviction that it is not the highest"
13434,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","art, that it is somehow excessive and over-rich, that it is not chaste"
13435,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",in itself or chastening to the mind that sees it--that it is in an
13436,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","unexplained manner unsatisfactory, 'a thing in which we feel there is"
13437,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",some hidden want!'
13438,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13439,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","That want is a want of 'definition'. We must all know landscapes,"
13440,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","river landscapes especially, which are in the highest sense beautiful,"
13441,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",which when we first see them give us a delicate pleasure; which in
13442,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",some--and these the best cases--give even a gentle sense of surprise
13443,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","that such things should be so beautiful, and yet when we come to live"
13444,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in them, to spend even a few hours in them, we seem stifled and"
13445,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",oppressed. On the other hand there are people to whom the sea-shore is
13446,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","a companion, an exhilaration; and not so much for the brawl of the"
13447,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","shore as for the _limited_ vastness, the finite infinite of the ocean"
13448,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","as they see it. Such people often come home braced and nerved, and if"
13449,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they spoke out the truth, would have only to say, 'We have seen the"
13450,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","horizon line'; if they were let alone indeed, they would gaze on it"
13451,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","hour after hour, so great to them is the fascination, so full the"
13452,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sustaining calm, which they gain from that union of form and"
13453,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","greatness. To a very inferior extent, but still, perhaps, to an extent"
13454,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which most people understand better, a common arch will have the same"
13455,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",effect. A bridge completes a river landscape; if of the old and
13456,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",many-arched sort it regulates by a long series of defined forms the
13457,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",vague outline of wood and river which before had nothing to measure
13458,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",it; if of the new scientific sort it introduces still more strictly a
13459,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",geometrical element; it stiffens the scenery which was before too
13460,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","soft, too delicate, too vegetable. Just such is the effect of pure"
13461,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",style in literary art. It calms by conciseness; while the ornate style
13462,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","leaves on the mind a mist of beauty, an excess of fascination, a"
13463,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","complication of charm, the pure style leaves behind it the simple,"
13464,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","defined, measured idea, as it is, and by itself. That which is chaste"
13465,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","chastens; there is a poised energy--a state half thrill, and half"
13466,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","tranquillity--which pure art gives, which no other can give; a"
13467,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",pleasure justified as well as felt; an ennobled satisfaction at what
13468,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","ought to satisfy us, and must ennoble us."
13469,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13470,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Ornate art is to pure art what a painted statue is to an unpainted. It
13471,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",is impossible to deny that a touch of colour _does_ bring out certain
13472,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","parts, does convey certain expressions, does heighten certain"
13473,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","features, but it leaves on the work as a whole, a want, as we say,"
13474,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",'of something'; a want of that inseparable chasteness which clings to
13475,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","simple sculpture, an impairing predominance of alluring details which"
13476,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",impairs our satisfaction with our own satisfaction; which makes us
13477,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",doubt whether a higher being than ourselves will be satisfied even
13478,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","though we are so. In the very same manner, though the _rouge_ of"
13479,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","ornate literature excites our eye, it also impairs our confidence."
13480,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13481,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Mr. Arnold has justly observed that this self-justifying,"
13482,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","self-_proving_ purity of style, is commoner in ancient literature than"
13483,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in modern literature, and also that Shakespeare is not a great or an"
13484,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",unmixed example of it. No one can say that he is. His works are full
13485,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of undergrowth, are full of complexity, are not models of style;"
13486,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",except by a miracle nothing in the Elizabethan age could be a model of
13487,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",style; the restraining taste of that age was feebler and more mistaken
13488,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",than that of any other equally great age. Shakespeare's mind so teemed
13489,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","with creation that he required the most just, most forcible, most"
13490,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","constant restraint from without. He most needed to be guided of poets,"
13491,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and he was the least and worst guided. As a whole no one can call his
13492,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","works finished models of the pure style, or of any style. But he has"
13493,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","many passages of the most pure style, passages which could be easily"
13494,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",cited if space served. And we must remember that the task which
13495,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Shakespeare undertook was the most difficult which any poet has ever
13496,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","attempted, and that it is a task in which after a million efforts"
13497,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",every other poet has failed. The Elizabethan drama--as Shakespeare has
13498,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","immortalized it--undertakes to delineate in five acts, under stage"
13499,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","restrictions, and in mere dialogue, a whole list of dramatis"
13500,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","personae, a set of characters enough for a modern novel, and with the"
13501,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",distinctness of a modern novel. Shakespeare is not content to give two
13502,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","or three great characters in solitude and in dignity, like the"
13503,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",classical dramatists; he wishes to give a whole _party_ of characters
13504,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in the play of life, and according to the nature of each. He would"
13505,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'hold the mirror up to nature', not to catch a monarch in a tragic"
13506,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","posture, but a whole group of characters engaged in many actions,"
13507,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","intent on many purposes, thinking many thoughts. There is life enough,"
13508,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","there is action enough, in single plays of Shakespeare to set up an"
13509,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",ancient dramatist for a long career. And Shakespeare succeeded. His
13510,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","characters, taken _en masse_, and as a whole, are as well-known as any"
13511,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","novelist's characters; cultivated men know all about them, as young"
13512,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",ladies know all about Mr. Trollope's novels. But no other dramatist
13513,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",has succeeded in such an aim. No one else's characters are staple
13514,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","people in English literature, hereditary people whom every one knows"
13515,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","all about in every generation. The contemporary dramatists, Beaumont"
13516,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Marlowe, &c., had many merits, some of them"
13517,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",were great men. But a critic must say of them the worst thing he has
13518,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to say; 'they were men who failed in their characteristic aim;' they
13519,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","attempted to describe numerous sets of complicated characters, and"
13520,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they failed. No one of such characters, or hardly one, lives in common"
13521,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","memory; the Faustus of Marlowe, a really great idea, is not"
13522,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","remembered. They undertook to write what they could not write, five"
13523,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","acts full of real characters, and in consequence, the fine individual"
13524,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","things they conceived are forgotten by the mixed multitude, and known"
13525,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",only to a few of the few. Of the Spanish theatre we cannot speak; but
13526,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",there are no such characters in any French tragedy: the whole aim of
13527,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",that tragedy forbade it. Goethe has added to literature a few great
13528,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",characters; he may be said almost to have added to literature the idea
13529,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of 'intellectual creation',--the idea of describing great characters"
13530,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",through the intellect; but he has not added to the common stock what
13531,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Shakespeare added, a new _multitude_ of men and women; and these not"
13532,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in simple attitudes, but amid the most complex parts of life, with all"
13533,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","their various natures roused, mixed, and strained. The severest art"
13534,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","must have allowed many details, much overflowing circumstance to a"
13535,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",poet who undertook to describe what almost defies description. Pure
13536,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","art would have _commanded_ him to use details lavishly, for only by a"
13537,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",multiplicity of such could the required effect have been at all
13538,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","produced. Shakespeare could accomplish it, for his mind was a"
13539,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","_spring_, an inexhaustible fountain of human nature, and it is no"
13540,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",wonder that being compelled by the task of his time to let the
13541,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","fullness of his nature overflow, he sometimes let it overflow too"
13542,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","much, and covered with erroneous conceits and superfluous images"
13543,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","characters and conceptions which would have been far more justly, far"
13544,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","more effectually, delineated with conciseness and simplicity. But"
13545,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","there is an infinity of pure art _in_ Shakespeare, although there is a"
13546,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",great deal else also.
13547,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13548,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","It will be said, if ornate art be as you say, an inferior species or"
13549,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","art, why should it ever be used? If pure art be the best sort of art,"
13550,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",why should it not always be used?
13551,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13552,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","The reason is this: literary art, as we just now explained, is"
13553,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",concerned with literatesque characters in literatesque situations; and
13554,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the _best_ art is concerned with the _most_ literatesque characters in
13555,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the _most_ literatesque situations. Such are the subjects of pure art;
13556,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","it embodies with the fewest touches, and under the most select and"
13557,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","choice circumstances, the highest conceptions; but it does not follow"
13558,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","that only the best subjects are to be treated by art, and then only in"
13559,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the very best way. Human nature could not endure such a critical
13560,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","commandment as that, and it would be an erroneous criticism which gave"
13561,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",it. _Any_ literatesque character may be described in literature under
13562,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",_any_ circumstances which exhibit its literatesqueness.
13563,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13564,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","The essence of pure art consists in its describing what is as it is,"
13565,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and this is very well for what can bear it, but there are many"
13566,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","inferior things which will not bear it, and which nevertheless ought"
13567,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to be described in books. A certain kind of literature deals with
13568,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","illusions, and this kind of literature has given a colouring to the"
13569,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","name romantic. A man of rare genius, and even of poetical genius, has"
13570,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",gone so far as to make these illusions the true subject of
13571,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","poetry--almost the sole subject. 'Without,' says Father Newman, of one"
13572,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of his characters, 'being himself a poet, he was in the season of"
13573,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","poetry, in the sweet spring-time, when the year is most beautiful"
13574,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",because it is new. Novelty was beauty to a heart so open and cheerful
13575,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","as his; not only because it was novelty, and had its proper charm as"
13576,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","such, but because when we first see things, we see them in a gay"
13577,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","confusion, which is a principal element of the poetical. As time goes"
13578,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","on, and we number and sort and measure things,--as we gain views,--we"
13579,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","advance towards philosophy and truth, but we recede from poetry."
13580,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13581,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'When we ourselves were young, we once on a time walked on a hot"
13582,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","summer-day from Oxford to Newington--a dull road, as any one who has"
13583,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","gone it knows; yet it was new to us; and we protest to you, reader,"
13584,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","believe it or not, laugh or not, as you will, to us it seemed on that"
13585,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",occasion quite touchingly beautiful; and a soft melancholy came over
13586,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","us, of which the shadows fall even now, when we look back upon that"
13587,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","dusty, weary journey. And why? because every object which met us was"
13588,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",unknown and full of mystery. A tree or two in the distance seemed the
13589,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","beginning of a great wood, or park, stretching endlessly; a hill"

13591,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","their green hedges, wound on and vanished, yet were not lost to the"
13592,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",imagination. Such was our first journey; but when we had gone it
13593,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","several times, the mind refused to act, the scene ceased to enchant,"
13594,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",stern reality alone remained; and we thought it one of the most
13595,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","tiresome, odious roads we ever had occasion to traverse.'"
13596,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13597,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","That is to say, that the function of the poet is to introduce a 'gay"
13598,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","confusion', a rich medley which does not exist in the actual"
13599,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",world--which perhaps could not exist in any world--but which would
13600,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",seem pretty if it did exist. Everyone who reads _Enoch Arden_ will
13601,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",perceive that this notion of all poetry is exactly applicable to this
13602,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",one poem. Whatever be made of Enoch's 'Ocean spoil in ocean-smelling
13603,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","osier,' of the 'portal-warding lion-whelp, and peacock yew-tree',"
13604,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",every one knows that in himself Enoch could not have been charming.
13605,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","People who sell fish about the country (and that is what he did,"
13606,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","though Mr. Tennyson won't speak out, and wraps it up) never are"
13607,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","beautiful. As Enoch was and must be coarse, in itself the poem must"
13608,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",depend for its charm on a 'gay confusion'--on a splendid accumulation
13609,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",of impossible accessories.
13610,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13611,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Mr. Tennyson knows this better than many of us--he knows the country
13612,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",world; he has proved it that no one living knows it better; he has
13613,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",painted with pure art--with art which describes what is a race perhaps
13614,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","more refined, more delicate, more conscientious, than the sailor--the"
13615,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Northern Farmer', and we all know what a splendid, what a living"
13616,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","thing, he has made of it. He could, if he only would, have given us"
13617,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the ideal sailor in like manner--the ideal of the natural sailor we
13618,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",mean--the characteristic present man as he lives and is. But this he
13619,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","has not chosen. He has endeavoured to describe an exceptional sailor,"
13620,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","at an exceptionally refined port, performing a graceful act, an act of"
13621,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","relinquishment. And with this task before him, his profound taste"
13622,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",taught him that ornate art was a necessary medium--was the sole
13623,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",effectual instrument--for his purpose. It was necessary for him if
13624,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","possible to abstract the mind from reality, to induce us _not_ to"
13625,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",conceive or think of sailors as they are while we are reading of his
13626,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sailors, but to think of what a person who did not know might fancy"
13627,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sailors to be. A casual traveller on the sea-shore, with the sensitive"
13628,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","mood and the romantic imagination Mr. Newman has described, might"
13629,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","fancy, would fancy, a seafaring village to be like that. Accordingly,"
13630,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Mr. Tennyson has made it his aim to call off the stress of fancy from
13631,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","real life, to occupy it otherwise, to bury it with pretty accessories;"
13632,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","to engage it on the 'peacock yew-tree', and the 'portal-warding"
13633,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","lion-whelp'. Nothing, too, can be more splendid than the description"
13634,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of the tropics as Mr. Tennyson delineates them, but a sailor would not"
13635,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",have felt the tropics in that manner. The beauties of nature would not
13636,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",have so much occupied him. He would have known little of the scarlet
13637,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",shafts of sunrise and nothing of the long convolvuluses. As in
13638,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","_Robinson Crusoe_, his own petty contrivances and his small ailments"
13639,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","would have been the principal subject to him. 'For three years', he"
13640,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","might have said, 'my back was bad, and then I put two pegs into a"
13641,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","piece of drift wood and so made a chair, and after that it pleased God"
13642,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to send me a chill.' In real life his piety would scarcely have gone
13643,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",beyond that.
13644,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13645,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","It will indeed be said, that though the sailor had no words for, and"
13646,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",even no explicit consciousness of the splendid details of the torrid
13647,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","zone, yet that he had, notwithstanding, a dim latent inexpressible"
13648,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",conception of them: though he could not speak of them or describe
13649,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","them, yet they were much to him. And doubtless such is the case. Rude"
13650,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",people are impressed by what is beautiful--deeply impressed--though
13651,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they could not describe what they see, or what they feel. But what is"
13652,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",absurd in Mr. Tennyson's description--absurd when we abstract it from
13653,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the gorgeous additions and ornaments with which Mr. Tennyson distracts
13654,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","us--is, that his hero feels nothing else but these great splendours."
13655,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","We hear nothing of the physical ailments, the rough devices, the low"
13656,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","superstitions, which really would have been the _first_ things, the"
13657,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",favourite and principal occupations of his mind. Just so when he gets
13658,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","home he _may_ have had such fine sentiments, though it is odd, and he"
13659,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","_may_ have spoken of them to his landlady, though that is odder"
13660,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",still--but it is incredible that his whole mind should be made up of
13661,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","fine sentiments. Beside those sweet feelings, if he had them, there"
13662,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","must have been many more obvious, more prosaic, and some perhaps more"
13663,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",healthy. Mr. Tennyson has shown a profound judgement in distracting us
13664,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",as he does. He has given us a classic delineation of the 'Northern
13665,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Farmer' with no ornament at all--as bare a thing as can be--because he
13666,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",then wanted to describe a true type of real men: he has given us a
13667,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sailor crowded all over with ornament and illustration, because he"
13668,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","then wanted to describe an unreal type of fancied men, not sailors as"
13669,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they are, but sailors as they might be wished."
13670,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13671,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Another prominent element in _Enoch Arden_ is yet more suitable to,"
13672,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","yet more requires the aid of, ornate art. Mr. Tennyson undertook to"
13673,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",deal with _half belief_. The presentiments which Annie feels are
13674,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","exactly of that sort which everybody has felt, and which every one has"
13675,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",half believed--which hardly any one has more than half believed.
13676,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Almost every one, it has been said, would be angry if any one else"
13677,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","reported that he believed in ghosts; yet hardly any one, when thinking"
13678,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","by himself, wholly disbelieves them. Just so such presentiments as Mr."
13679,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Tennyson depicts, impress the inner mind so much that the outer"
13680,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",mind--the rational understanding--hardly likes to consider them nicely
13681,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",or to discuss them sceptically. For these dubious themes an ornate or
13682,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",complex style is needful. Classical art speaks out what it has to say
13683,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",plainly and simply. Pure style cannot hesitate; it describes in
13684,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","concisest outline what is, as it is. If a poet really believes in"
13685,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",presentiments he can speak out in pure style. One who could have been
13686,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",a poet--one of the few in any age of whom one can say certainly that
13687,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they could have been, and have not been--has spoken thus:"

13709,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13710,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",But if a poet is not sure whether presentiments are true or not true;
13711,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",if he wishes to leave his readers in doubt; if he wishes an atmosphere
13712,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of indistinct illusion and of moving shadow, he must use the romantic"
13713,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","style, the style of miscellaneous adjunct, the style 'which shirks,"
13714,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","not meets' your intellect, the style which as you are scrutinizing"
13715,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",disappears.
13716,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13717,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Nor is this all, or even the principal lesson, which _Enoch Arden_ may"
13718,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","suggest to us, of the use of ornate art. That art is the appropriate"
13719,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","art for an _unpleasing type_. Many of the characters of real life, if"
13720,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","brought distinctly, prominently, and plainly before the mind, as they"
13721,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","really are, if shown in their inner nature, their actual essence, are"
13722,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",doubtless very unpleasant. They would be horrid to meet and horrid to
13723,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",think of. We fear it must be owned that Enoch Arden is this kind of
13724,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",person. A dirty sailor who did _not_ go home to his wife is not an
13725,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",agreeable being: a varnish must be put on him to make him shine. It is
13726,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",true that he acts rightly; that he is very good. But such is human
13727,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",nature that it finds a little tameness in mere morality. Mere virtue
13728,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","belongs to a charity school-girl, and has a taint of the catechism."
13729,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","All of us feel this, though most of us are too timid, too scrupulous,"
13730,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","too anxious about the virtue of others, to speak out. We are ashamed"
13731,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of our nature in this respect, but it is not the less our nature. And"
13732,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",if we look deeper into the matter there are many reasons why we should
13733,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","not be ashamed of it. The soul of man, and as we necessarily believe"
13734,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of beings greater than man, has many parts beside its moral part. It"
13735,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","has an intellectual part, an artistic part, even a religious part, in"
13736,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which mere morals have no share. In Shakespeare or Goethe, even in"
13737,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Newton or Archimedes, there is much which will not be cut down to the"
13738,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","shape of the commandments. They have thoughts, feelings,"
13739,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",hopes--immortal thoughts and hopes--which have influenced the life of
13740,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","men, and the souls of men, ever since their age, but which the 'whole"
13741,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","duty of man', the ethical compendium, does not recognize. Nothing is"
13742,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",more unpleasant than a virtuous person with a mean mind. A highly
13743,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","developed moral nature joined to an undeveloped intellectual nature,"
13744,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","an undeveloped artistic nature, and a very limited religious nature,"
13745,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",is of necessity repulsive. It represents a bit of human nature--a good
13746,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","bit, of course, but a bit only--in disproportionate, unnatural, and"
13747,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","revolting prominence; and, therefore, unless an artist use delicate"
13748,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","care, we are offended. The dismal act of a squalid man needed many"
13749,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","condiments to make it pleasant, and therefore Mr. Tennyson was right"
13750,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to mix them subtly and to use them freely.
13751,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13752,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",A mere act of self-denial can indeed scarcely be pleasant upon paper.
13753,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","An heroic struggle with an external adversary, even though it end in a"
13754,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","defeat, may easily be made attractive. Human nature likes to see"
13755,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","itself look grand, and it looks grand when it is making a brave"
13756,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",struggle with foreign foes. But it does not look grand when it is
13757,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",divided against itself. An excellent person striving with temptation
13758,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","is a very admirable being in reality, but he is not a pleasant being"
13759,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in description. We hope he will win and overcome his temptation, but"
13760,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","we feel that he would be a more interesting being, a higher being, if"
13761,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",he had not felt that temptation so much. The poet must make the
13762,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","struggle great in order to make the self-denial virtuous, and if the"
13763,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","struggle be too great, we are apt to feel some mixture of contempt."
13764,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",The internal metaphysics of a divided nature are but an inferior
13765,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","subject for art, and if they are to be made attractive, much else must"
13766,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",be combined with them. If the excellence of _Hamlet_ had depended on
13767,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the ethical qualities of Hamlet, it would not have been the"
13768,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","masterpiece of our literature. He acts virtuously of course, and kills"
13769,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the people he ought to kill, but Shakespeare knew that such goodness"
13770,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","would not much interest the pit. He made him a handsome prince, and a"
13771,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",puzzling meditative character; these secular qualities relieve his
13772,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","moral excellence, and so he becomes 'nice'. In proportion as an artist"
13773,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","has to deal with types essentially imperfect, he must disguise their"
13774,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",imperfections; he must accumulate around them as many first-rate
13775,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",accessories as may make his readers forget that they are themselves
13776,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",second-rate. The sudden _millionaires_ of the present day hope to
13777,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","disguise their social defects by buying old places, and hiding among"
13778,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",aristocratic furniture; just so a great artist who has to deal with
13779,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","characters artistically imperfect will use an ornate style, will fit"
13780,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",them into a scene where there is much else to look at.
13781,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13782,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",For these reasons ornate art is within the limits as legitimate as
13783,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",pure art. It does what pure art could not do. The very excellence of
13784,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",pure art confines its employment. Precisely because it gives the best
13785,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","things by themselves and exactly as they are, it fails when it is"
13786,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","necessary to describe inferior things among other things, with a list"
13787,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",of enhancements and a crowd of accompaniments that in reality do not
13788,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","belong to it. Illusion, half belief, unpleasant types, imperfect"
13789,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","types, are as much the proper sphere of ornate art, as an inferior"
13790,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",landscape is the proper sphere for the true efficacy of moonlight. A
13791,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",really great landscape needs sunlight and bears sunlight; but
13792,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",moonlight is an equalizer of beauties; it gives a romantic unreality
13793,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",to what will not stand the bare truth. And just so does romantic art.
13794,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13795,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","There is, however, a third kind of art which differs from these on the"
13796,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",point in which they most resemble one another. Ornate art and pure art
13797,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","have this in common, that they paint the types of literature in as"
13798,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","good perfection as they can. Ornate art, indeed, uses undue disguises"
13799,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and unreal enhancements; it does not confine itself to the best types;
13800,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",on the contrary it is its office to make the best of imperfect types
13801,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","and lame approximations; but ornate art, as much as pure art, catches"
13802,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","its subject in the best light it can, takes the most developed aspect"
13803,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of it which it can find, and throws upon it the most congruous colours"
13804,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",it can use. But grotesque art does just the contrary. It takes the
13805,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","type, so to say, _in difficulties_. It gives a representation of it in"
13806,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","its minimum development, amid the circumstances least favourable to"
13807,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","it, just while it is struggling with obstacles, just where it is"
13808,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","encumbered with incongruities. It deals, to use the language of"
13809,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","science, not with normal types but with abnormal specimens; to use the"
13810,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","language of old philosophy, not with what nature is striving to be,"
13811,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",but with what by some lapse she has happened to become.
13812,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13813,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","This art works by contrast. It enables you to see, it makes you see,"
13814,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the perfect type by painting the opposite deviation. It shows you what
13815,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","ought to be by what ought not to be, when complete it reminds you of"
13816,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the perfect image, by showing you the distorted and imperfect image."
13817,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Of this art we possess in the present generation one prolific master.
13818,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Mr. Browning is an artist working by incongruity. Possibly hardly one
13819,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",of his most considerable efforts can be found which is not great
13820,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",because of its odd mixture. He puts together things which no one else
13821,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","would have put together, and produces on our minds a result which no"
13822,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","one else would have produced, or tried to produce. His admirers may"
13823,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",not like all we may have to say of him. But in our way we too are
13824,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",among his admirers. No one ever read him without seeing not only his
13825,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",great ability but his great _mind_. He not only possesses superficial
13826,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","useable talents, but the strong something, the inner secret something"
13827,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which uses them and controls them; he is great, not in mere"
13828,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","accomplishments, but in himself. He has applied a hard strong"
13829,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",intellect to real life; he has applied the same intellect to the
13830,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",problems of his age. He has striven to know what _is_: he has
13831,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","endeavoured not to be cheated by counterfeits, not to be infatuated"
13832,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",with illusions. His heart is in what he says. He has battered his
13833,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",brain against his creed till he believes it. He has accomplishments
13834,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","too, the more effective because they are mixed. He is at once a"
13835,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","student of mysticism, and a citizen of the world. He brings to the"
13836,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","club sofa distinct visions of old creeds, intense images of strange"
13837,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","thoughts: he takes to the bookish student tidings of wild Bohemia, and"
13838,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",little traces of the _demi-monde_. He puts down what is good for the
13839,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",naughty and what is naughty for the good. Over women his easier
13840,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",writings exercise that imperious power which belongs to the writings
13841,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of a great man of the world upon such matters. He knows women, and"
13842,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",therefore they wish to know him. If we blame many of Browning's
13843,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","efforts, it is in the interest of art, and not from a wish to hurt or"
13844,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",degrade him.
13845,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13846,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",If we wanted to illustrate the nature of grotesque art by an
13847,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",exaggerated instance we should have selected a poem which the chance
13848,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",of late publication brings us in this new volume. Mr. Browning has
13849,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",undertaken to describe what may be called _mind in difficulties_--mind
13850,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",set to make out the universe under the worst and hardest
13851,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","circumstances. He takes 'Caliban', not perhaps exactly Shakespeare's"
13852,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Caliban, but an analogous and worse creature; a strong thinking power,"
13853,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","but a nasty creature--a gross animal, uncontrolled and unelevated by"
13854,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",any feeling of religion or duty. The delineation of him will show that
13855,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Mr. Browning does not wish to take undue advantage of his readers by a
13856,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",choice of nice subjects.
13857,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13858,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,"
13859,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Flat on his belly in the pit's much mire,"
13860,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin;"
13861,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,"
13862,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And feels about his spine small eft-things course,"
13863,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh;"
13864,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And while above his head a pompion-plant,"
13865,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,"
13866,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,"
13867,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And now a flower drops with a bee inside,"
13868,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch:"
13869,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13870,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",This pleasant creature proceeds to give his idea of the origin of the
13871,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Universe, and it is as follows. Caliban speaks in the third person,"
13872,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and is of opinion that the maker of the Universe took to making it on
13873,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",account of his personal discomfort:
13874,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13875,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Setebos, Setebos, and Setebos!"
13876,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Thinketh, He dwelleth i' the cold o' the moon."
13877,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13878,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Thinketh He made it, with the sun to match,"
13879,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",But not the stars: the stars came otherwise;
13880,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that:"
13881,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Also this isle, what lives, and grows thereon,"
13882,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.
13883,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13884,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Thinketh, it came of being ill at ease:"
13885,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","He hated that He cannot change His cold,"
13886,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Nor cure its ache. 'Hath spied an icy fish
13887,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","That longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived,"
13888,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And thaw herself within the lukewarm brine
13889,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","O' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid,"
13890,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",A crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave;
13891,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Only she ever sickened, found repulse"

13895,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And in her old bounds buried her despair,"
13896,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Hating and loving warmth alike: so He.

13898,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,"
13899,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing."

13901,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Yon auk, one fire-eye, in a ball of foam,"
13902,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown
13903,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye
13904,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue
13905,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","That pricks deep into oakwarts for a worm,"
13906,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And says a plain word when she finds her prize,"
13907,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",But will not eat the ants; the ants themselves

13910,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Made all we see, and us, in spite: how else?"
13911,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13912,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",It may seem perhaps to most readers that these lines are very
13913,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","difficult, and that they are unpleasant. And so they are. We quote"
13914,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","them to illustrate, not the _success_ of grotesque art, but the"
13915,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",_nature_ of grotesque art. It shows the end at which this species of
13916,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","art aims, and if it fails, it is from over-boldness in the choice of a"
13917,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","subject by the artist, or from the defects of its execution. A"
13918,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","thinking faculty more in difficulties--a great type,--an inquisitive,"
13919,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","searching intellect under more disagreeable conditions, with worse"
13920,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","helps, more likely to find falsehood, less likely to find truth, can"
13921,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",scarcely be imagined. Nor is the mere description of the thought at
13922,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","all bad: on the contrary, if we closely examine it, it is very clever."
13923,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Hardly any one could have amassed so many ideas at once nasty and
13924,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",suitable. But scarcely any readers--any casual readers--who are not of
13925,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the sect of Mr. Browning's admirers will be able to examine it enough
13926,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","to appreciate it. From a defect, partly of subject, and partly of"
13927,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","style, many of Mr. Browning's works make a demand upon the reader's"
13928,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",zeal and sense of duty to which the nature of most readers is unequal.
13929,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",They have on the turf the convenient expression 'staying power': some
13930,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",horses can hold on and others cannot. But hardly any reader not of
13931,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",especial and peculiar nature can hold on through such composition.
13932,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",There is not enough of 'staying power' in human nature. One of his
13933,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",greatest admirers once owned to us that he seldom or never began a new
13934,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","poem without looking on in advance, and foreseeing with caution what"
13935,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",length of intellectual adventure he was about to commence. Whoever
13936,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",will work hard at such poems will find much mind in them: they are a
13937,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","sort of quarry of ideas, but whoever goes there will find these ideas"
13938,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in such a jagged, ugly, useless shape that he can hardly bear them."
13939,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
13940,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",We are not judging Mr. Browning simply from a hasty recent production.
13941,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","All poets are liable to misconceptions, and if such a piece as"
13942,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","_Caliban upon Setebos_ were an isolated error, a venial and particular"
13943,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","exception, we should have given it no prominence. We have put it"
13944,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",forward because it just elucidates both our subject and the
13945,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",characteristics of Mr. Browning. But many other of his best known
13946,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",pieces do so almost equally; what several of his devotees think his
13947,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",best piece is quite enough illustrative for anything we want. It
13948,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",appears that on Holy Cross day at Rome the Jews were obliged to listen
13949,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","to a Christian sermon in the hope of their conversion, though this is,"
13950,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","according to Mr. Browning, what they really said when they came away:"

14049,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","subjects, and no age where real life was so fit to suggest them. Then,"
14050,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","more than at any other time, good principles have been under great"
14051,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","hardships. The vestiges of ancient civilization, the germs of modern"

14053,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","beginnings of what is, were buried under a cumbrous mass of barbarism"
14054,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and cruelty. Good elements hidden in horrid accompaniments are the
14055,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","special theme of grotesque art, and these mediaeval life and legends"
14056,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",afford more copiously than could have been furnished before
14057,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Christianity gave its new elements of good, or since modern"
14058,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",civilization has removed some few at least of the old elements of
14059,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",destruction. A _buried_ life like the spiritual mediaeval was Mr.
14060,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Browning's natural element, and he was right to be attracted by it."
14061,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","His mistake has been, that he has not made it pleasant; that he has"
14062,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","forced his art to topics on which no one could charm, or on which he,"
14063,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","at any rate, could not; that on these occasions and in these poems he"
14064,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",has failed in fascinating men and women of sane taste.
14065,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
14066,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",We say 'sane' because there is a most formidable and estimable
14067,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",_insane_ taste. The will has great though indirect power over the
14068,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","taste, just as it has over the belief. There are some horrid beliefs"
14069,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","from which human nature revolts, from which at first it shrinks, to"
14070,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which, at first, no effort can force it. But if we fix the mind upon"
14071,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",them they have a power over us just because of their natural
14072,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",offensiveness. They are like the sight of human blood: experienced
14073,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",soldiers tell us that at first men are sickened by the smell and
14074,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","newness of blood almost to death and fainting, but that as soon as"
14075,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they harden their hearts and stiffen their minds, as soon as they"
14076,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","_will_ bear it, then comes an appetite for slaughter, a tendency to"
14077,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","gloat on carnage, to love blood, at least for the moment, with a deep"
14078,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",eager love. It is a principle that if we put down a healthy
14079,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","instinctive aversion, nature avenges herself by creating an unhealthy"
14080,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",insane attraction. For this reason the most earnest truth-seeking men
14081,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",fall into the worst delusions; they will not let their mind alone;
14082,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","they force it towards some ugly thing, which a crotchet of argument, a"
14083,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","conceit of intellect recommends, and nature punishes their disregard"
14084,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","of her warning by subjection to the ugly one, by belief in it. Just so"
14085,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the most industrious critics get the most admiration. They think it
14086,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","unjust to rest in their instinctive natural horror: they overcome it,"
14087,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and angry nature gives them over to ugly poems and marries them to
14088,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",detestable stanzas.
14089,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
14090,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Mr. Browning possibly, and some of the worst of Mr. Browning's"
14091,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","admirers certainly, will say that these grotesque objects exist in"
14092,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","real life, and therefore they ought to be, at least may be, described"
14093,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","in art. But though pleasure is not the end of poetry, pleasing is a"
14094,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",condition of poetry. An exceptional monstrosity of horrid ugliness
14095,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","cannot be made pleasing, except it be made to suggest--to recall--the"
14096,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","perfection, the beauty, from which it is a deviation. Perhaps in"
14097,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",extreme cases no art is equal to this; but then such self-imposed
14098,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",problems should not be worked by the artist; these out-of-the-way and
14099,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",detestable subjects should be let alone by him. It is rather
14100,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",characteristic of Mr. Browning to neglect this rule. He is the most of
14101,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","a realist, and the least of an idealist of any poet we know. He"
14102,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",evidently sympathizes with some part at least of Bishop Blougram's
14103,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",apology. Anyhow this world exists. 'There _is_ good wine--there _are_
14104,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","pretty women--there _are_ comfortable benefices--there _is_ money, and"
14105,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",it is pleasant to spend it. Accept the creed of your age and you get
14106,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","these, reject that creed and you lose them. And for what do you lose"
14107,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","them? For a fancy creed of your own, which no one else will accept,"
14108,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","which hardly any one will call a ""creed"", which most people will"
14109,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","consider a sort of unbelief.' Again, Mr. Browning evidently loves what"
14110,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","we may call the realism, the grotesque realism, of orthodox"
14111,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",christianity. Many parts of it in which great divines have felt keen
14112,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","difficulties are quite pleasant to him. He must _see_ his religion, he"
14113,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",must nave an 'object-lesson' in believing. He must have a creed that
14114,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","will _take_, which wins and holds the miscellaneous world, which stout"
14115,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","men will heed, which nice women will adore. The spare moments of"
14116,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","solitary religion--the 'obdurate questionings', the high 'instincts',"
14117,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the 'first affections', the 'shadowy recollections',"
14118,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
14119,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Which, do they what they may,"
14120,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Are yet the fountain-light of all our day--
14121,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
14122,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
14123,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the great but vague faith--the unutterable tenets seem to him
14124,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","worthless, visionary; they are not enough immersed in matter; they"
14125,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",move about 'in worlds not realized'. We wish he could be tried like
14126,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the prophet once; he would have found God in the earthquake and the
14127,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",storm; he could have deciphered from them a bracing and a rough
14128,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",religion: he would have known that crude men and ignorant women felt
14129,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","them too, and he would accordingly have trusted them; but he would"
14130,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",have distrusted and disregarded the 'still small voice'; he would have
14131,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","said it was 'fancy'--a thing you thought you heard to-day, but were"
14132,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","not sure you had heard to-morrow: he would call it a nice illusion, an"
14133,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",immaterial prettiness; he would ask triumphantly 'How are you to get
14134,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",the mass of men to heed this little thing?' he would have persevered
14135,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",and insisted '_My wife_ does not hear it'.
14136,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",
14137,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","But although a suspicion of beauty, and a taste for ugly reality, have"
14138,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","led Mr. Browning to exaggerate the functions, and to caricature the"
14139,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","nature of grotesque art, we own or rather we maintain that he has"
14140,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",given many excellent specimens of that art within its proper
14141,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","boundaries and limits. Take an example, his picture of what we may"
14142,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",call the _bourgeois_ nature in _difficulties_; in the utmost
14143,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","difficulty, in contact with magic and the supernatural. He has made of"
14144,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","it something homely, comic, true; reminding us of what _bourgeois_"
14145,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","nature really is. By showing us the type under abnormal conditions,"
14146,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",he reminds us of the type under its best and most satisfactory
14147,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",conditions--

14198,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered
14199,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",You heard as if an army muttered;
14200,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
14201,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
14202,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
14203,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"

14211,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","From street to street he piped advancing,"
14212,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","And step for step they followed dancing,"
14213,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Until they came to the river Weser,"
14214,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Wherein all plunged and perished!

14319,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","Something more we had to say of Mr. Browning, but we must stop. It is"
14320,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",singularly characteristic of this age that the poems which rise to the
14321,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","surface should be examples of ornate art, and grotesque art, not of"
14322,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",pure art. We live in the realm of the _half_ educated. The number of
14323,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","readers grows daily, but the quality of readers does not improve"
14324,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","rapidly. The middle class is scattered, headless; it is well-meaning"
14325,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","but aimless; wishing to be wise, but ignorant how to be wise. The"
14326,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","aristocracy of England never was a literary aristocracy, never even in"
14327,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","the days of its full power, of its unquestioned predominance, did it"
14328,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",guide--did it even seriously try to guide--the taste of England.
14329,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",Without guidance young men and tired men are thrown amongst a mass of
14330,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",books; they have to choose which they like; many of them would much
14331,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","like to improve their culture, to chasten their taste, if they knew"
14332,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","how. But left to themselves they take, not pure art, but showy art;"
14333,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",not that which permanently relieves the eye and makes it happy
14334,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","whenever it looks, and as long as it looks, but _glaring_ art which"
14335,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","catches and arrests the eye for a moment, but which in the end"
14336,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",fatigues it. But before the wholesome remedy of nature--the
14337,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","fatigue--arrives, the hasty reader has passed on to some new"
14338,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","excitement, which in its turn stimulates for an instant, and then is"
14339,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",passed by for ever. These conditions are not favourable to the due
14340,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",appreciation of pure art--of that art which must be known before it is
14341,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",admired--which must have fastened irrevocably on the brain before you
14342,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",appreciate it--which you must love ere it will seem worthy of your
14343,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","love. Women too, whose voice in literature counts as well as that of"
14344,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",men--and in a light literature counts for more than that of
14345,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","men--women, such as we know them, such as they are likely to be, ever"
14346,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802",prefer a delicate unreality to a true or firm art. A dressy
14347,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","literature, an exaggerated literature seem to be fated to us. These"
14348,"COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802","are our curses, as other times had theirs."

14378,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14379,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14380,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Forms of intellectual and spiritual culture often exercise their
14381,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),subtlest and most artful charm when life is already passing from them.
14382,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Searching and irresistible as are the changes of the human spirit on
14383,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"its way to perfection, there is yet so much elasticity of temper that"
14384,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),what must pass away sooner or later is not disengaged all at once even
14385,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"from the highest order of minds. Nature, which by one law of"
14386,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"development evolves ideas, moralities, modes of inward life, and"
14387,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"represses them in turn, has in this way provided that the earlier"
14388,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"growth should propel its fibres into the later, and so transmit the"
14389,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),whole of its forces in an unbroken continuity of life. Then comes the
14390,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),spectacle of the reserve of the elder generation exquisitely refined
14391,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),by the antagonism of the new. That current of new life chastens them
14392,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),as they contend against it. Weaker minds do not perceive the change;
14393,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"clearer minds abandon themselves to it. To feel the change everywhere,"
14394,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"yet not to abandon oneself to it, is a situation of difficulty and"
14395,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),contention. Communicating in this way to the passing stage of culture
14396,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the charm of what is chastened, high-strung, athletic, they yet"
14397,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),detach the highest minds from the past by pressing home its
14398,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),difficulties and finally proving it impossible. Such is the charm of
14399,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Julian, of St. Louis, perhaps of Luther; in the narrower compass of"
14400,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"modern times, of Dr. Newman and Lacordaire; it is also the peculiar"
14401,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),charm of Coleridge.
14402,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14403,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Modern thought is distinguished from ancient by its cultivation of the
14404,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),'relative' spirit in place of the 'absolute'. Ancient philosophy
14405,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sought to arrest every object in an eternal outline, to fix thought in"
14406,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a necessary formula, and types of life in a classification by 'kinds'"
14407,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or _genera_. To the modern spirit nothing is, or can be rightly known"
14408,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),except relatively under conditions. An ancient philosopher indeed
14409,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"started a philosophy of the relative, but only as an enigma. So the"
14410,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),germs of almost all philosophical ideas were enfolded in the mind of
14411,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"antiquity, and fecundated one by one in after ages by the external"
14412,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"influences of art, religion, culture in the natural sciences,"
14413,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"belonging to a particular generation, which suddenly becomes"
14414,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"preoccupied by a formula or theory, not so much new as penetrated by a"
14415,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),new meaning and expressiveness. So the idea of 'the relative' has been
14416,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),fecundated in modern times by the influence of the sciences of
14417,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),observation. These sciences reveal types of life evanescing into each
14418,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),other by inexpressible refinements of change. Things pass into their
14419,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),opposites by accumulation of undefinable quantities. The growth of
14420,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),those sciences consists in a continual analysis of facts of rough and
14421,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),general observation into groups of facts more precise and minute. A
14422,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),faculty for truth is a power of distinguishing and fixing delicate and
14423,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),fugitive details. The moral world is ever in contact with the
14424,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),physical; the relative spirit has invaded moral philosophy from the
14425,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),ground of the inductive science. There it has started a new analysis
14426,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of the relations of body and mind, good and evil, freedom and"
14427,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),necessity. Hard and abstract moralities are yielding to a more exact
14428,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"estimate of the subtlety and complexity of our life. Always, as an"
14429,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),organism increases in perfection the conditions of its life become
14430,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),more complex. Man is the most complex of the products of nature.
14431,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Character merges into temperament; the nervous system refines itself
14432,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),into intellect. His physical organism is played upon not only by the
14433,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"physical conditions about it, but by remote laws of inheritance, the"
14434,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),vibrations of long past acts reaching him in the midst of the new
14435,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),order of things in which he lives. When we have estimated these
14436,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),conditions he is not yet simple and isolated; for the mind of the
14437,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"race, the character of the age, sway him this way or that through the"
14438,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),medium of language and ideas. It seems as if the most opposite
14439,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"statements about him were alike true; he is so receptive, all the"
14440,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"influences of the world and of society ceaselessly playing upon him,"
14441,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"so that every hour in his life is unique, changed altogether by a"
14442,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"stray word, or glance, or touch. The truth of these relations"
14443,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),experience gives us; not the truth of eternal outlines effected once
14444,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"for all, but a world of fine gradations and subtly linked conditions,"
14445,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),shifting intricately as we ourselves change; and bids us by constant
14446,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),clearing of the organs of observation and perfecting of analysis to
14447,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"make what we can of these. To the intellect, to the critical spirit,"
14448,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),these subtleties of effect are more precious than anything else. What
14449,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),is lost in precision of form is gained in intricacy of expression. To
14450,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),suppose that what is called 'ontology' is what the speculative
14451,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"instinct seeks, is the misconception of a backward school of"
14452,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),logicians. Who would change the colour or curve of a roseleaf for that
14453,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"[Greek: ousia achrômatos, aschêmatistos, anaphês]. A transcendentalism"
14454,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that makes what is abstract more excellent than what is concrete has
14455,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),nothing akin to the leading philosophies of the world. The true
14456,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"illustration of the speculative temper is not the Hindoo, lost to"
14457,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sense, understanding, individuality; but such an one as Goethe, to"
14458,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"whom every moment of life brought its share of experimental,"
14459,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"individual knowledge, by whom no touch of the world of form, colour,"
14460,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and passion was disregarded.
14461,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14462,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The literary life of Coleridge was a disinterested struggle against
14463,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the application of the relative spirit to moral and religious
14464,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),questions. Everywhere he is restlessly scheming to apprehend the
14465,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),absolute; to affirm it effectively; to get it acknowledged. Coleridge
14466,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"failed in that attempt, happily even for him, for it was a struggle"
14467,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"against the increasing life of the mind itself. The real loss was,"
14468,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that this controversial interest betrayed him into a direction which
14469,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),was not for him the path of the highest intellectual success; a
14470,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),direction in which his artistic talent could never find the conditions
14471,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of its perfection. Still, there is so much witchery about his poems,"
14472,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that it is as a poet that he will most probably be permanently
14473,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"remembered. How did his choice of a controversial interest, his"
14474,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"determination to affirm the absolute, weaken or modify his poetical"
14475,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),gift?
14476,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14477,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),In 1798 he joined Wordsworth in the composition of a volume of
14478,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),poems--the _Lyrical Ballads_. What Wordsworth then wrote is already
14479,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),vibrant with that blithe _élan_ which carried him to final happiness
14480,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and self-possession. In Coleridge we feel already that faintness and
14481,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),obscure dejection which cling like some contagious damp to all his
14482,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),writings. Wordsworth was to be distinguished by a joyful and
14483,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),penetrative conviction of the existence of certain latent affinities
14484,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"between nature and the human mind, which reciprocally gild the mind"
14485,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and nature with a kind of 'heavenly alchemy':
14486,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14487,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),... My voice proclaims
14488,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),How exquisitely the individual mind
14489,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),(And the progressive powers perhaps no less
14490,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Of the whole species) to the external world
14491,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Is fitted:--and how exquisitely, too,"
14492,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The external world is fitted to the mind:
14493,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"And the creation, by no lower name"
14494,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Can it be called, which they with blended might"
14495,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Accomplish.[37]
14496,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14497,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),[37] Preface to the _Excursion_.
14498,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14499,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),In Wordsworth this took the form of an unbroken dreaming over the
14500,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"aspects and transitions of nature, a reflective, but altogether"
14501,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"unformulated, analysis of them."
14502,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14503,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),There are in Coleridge's poems expressions of this conviction as deep
14504,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),as Wordsworth's. But Coleridge could never have abandoned himself to
14505,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the dream as Wordsworth did, because the first condition of such"
14506,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),abandonment is an unvexed quietness of heart. No one can read the
14507,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),_Lines composed above Tintern_ without feeling how potent the physical
14508,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),element was among the conditions of Wordsworth's genius:--'felt in the
14509,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"blood and felt along the heart,'--'My whole life I have lived in"
14510,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),quiet thought.' The stimulus which most artists require from nature he
14511,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),can renounce. He leaves the ready-made glory of the Swiss mountains to
14512,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),reflect a glory on a mouldering leaf. He loves best to watch the
14513,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"floating thistledown, because of its hint at an unseen life in the"
14514,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"air. Coleridge's temperament, [Greek: aei en sphodra orexei], with its"
14515,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"faintness, its grieved dejection, could never have been like that."
14516,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14517,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),My genial spirits fail
14518,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),And what can these avail
14519,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),To lift the smothering weight from off my breast?
14520,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"It were a vain endeavour,"
14521,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Though I should gaze for ever
14522,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),On that green light that lingers in the west:
14523,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),I may not hope from outward forms to win
14524,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The passion and the life whose fountains are within.
14525,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14526,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),It is that flawless temperament in Wordsworth which keeps his
14527,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),conviction of a latent intelligence in nature within the limits of
14528,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sentiment or instinct, and confines it, to those delicate and subdued"
14529,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"shades of expression which perfect art allows. In sadder dispositions,"
14530,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that is in the majority of cases, where such a conviction has existed,"
14531,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it has stiffened into a formula, it has frozen into a scientific or"
14532,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),pseudo-scientific theory. For the perception of those affinities
14533,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),brings one so near the absorbing speculative problems of
14534,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life--optimism, the proportion of man to his place in nature, his"
14535,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),prospects in relation to it--that it ever tends to become theory
14536,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"through their contagion. Even in Goethe, who has brilliantly handled"
14537,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the subject in his lyrics entitled _Gott und Welt_, it becomes"
14538,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),something stiffer than poetry; it is tempered by the 'pale cast' of
14539,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"his technical knowledge of the nature of colours, of anatomy, of the"
14540,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),metamorphosis of plants.
14541,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14542,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"That, however, which had only a limited power over Coleridge as"
14543,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sentiment, entirely possessed him as a philosophical idea. We shall"
14544,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"see in what follows how deep its power was, how it pursued him"
14545,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"everywhere, and seemed to him to interpret every question."
14546,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Wordsworth's poetry is an optimism; it says man's relation to the
14547,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"world is, and may be seen by man to be, a perfect relation; but it is"
14548,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),an optimism that begins and ends in an abiding instinct. Coleridge
14549,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"accepts the same optimism as a philosophical idea, but an idea is"
14550,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),relative to an intellectual assent; sometimes it seems a better
14551,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"expression of facts, sometimes a worse, as the understanding weighs it"
14552,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),in the logical balances. And so it is not a permanent consolation. It
14553,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),is only in the rarer moments of intellectual warmth and sunlight that
14554,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),it is entirely credible. In less exhilarating moments that perfect
14555,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"relation of man and nature seems to shift and fail; that is, the"
14556,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),philosophical idea ceases to be realizable; and with Coleridge its
14557,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"place is not supplied, as with Wordsworth, by the corresponding"
14558,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sentiment or instinct.
14559,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14560,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"What in Wordsworth is a sentiment or instinct, is in Coleridge a"
14561,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"philosophical idea. In other words, Coleridge's talent is a more"
14562,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"intellectual one than Wordsworth's, more dramatic, more"
14563,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"self-conscious. Wordsworth's talent, deeply reflective as it is,"
14564,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"because its base is an instinct, is deficient in self-knowledge."
14565,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Possessed by the rumours and voices of the haunted country, the"
14566,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"borders of which he has passed alone, he never thinks of withdrawing"
14567,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),from it to look down upon it from one of the central heights of human
14568,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life. His power absorbs him, not he it; he cannot turn it round or get"
14569,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),without it; he does not estimate its general relation to life. But
14570,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Coleridge, just because the essence of his talent is the intuition of"
14571,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"an idea, commands his talent. He not only feels with Wordsworth the"
14572,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"expression of mind in nature, but he can project that feeling outside"
14573,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"him, reduce it to a psychological law, define its relation to other"
14574,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"elements of culture, place it in a complete view of life."
14575,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14576,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"And in some such activity as that, varied as his wide learning, in a"
14577,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"many-sided dramatic kind of poetry, assigning its place and value to"
14578,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"every mode of the inward life, seems to have been for Coleridge the"
14579,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),original path of artistic success. But in order to follow that path
14580,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"one must hold ideas loosely in the relative spirit, not seek to"
14581,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),stereotype any one of the many modes of that life; one must
14582,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"acknowledge that the mind is ever greater than its own products,"
14583,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"devote ideas to the service of art rather than of [Greek: gnôsis], not"
14584,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),disquiet oneself about the absolute. Perhaps Coleridge is more
14585,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),interesting because he did not follow this path. Repressing his
14586,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"artistic interest and voluntarily discolouring his own work, he turned"
14587,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"to console and strengthen the human mind, vulgarized or dejected, as"
14588,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"he believed, by the acquisition of new knowledge about itself in the"
14589,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),_éclaircissement_ of the eighteenth century.
14590,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14591,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),What the reader of our own generation will least find in Coleridge's
14592,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),prose writings is the excitement of the literary sense. And yet in
14593,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),those grey volumes we have the production of one who made way ever by
14594,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a charm, the charm of voice, of aspect, of language, above all, by"
14595,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the intellectual charm of new, moving, luminous ideas. Perhaps the"
14596,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"chief offence in Coleridge is an excess of seriousness, a seriousness"
14597,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that arises not from any moral principle, but from a misconception of"
14598,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the perfect manner. There is a certain shade of levity and unconcern,"
14599,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the perfect manner of the eighteenth century, which marks complete"
14600,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"culture in the handling of abstract questions. The humanist, he who"
14601,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"possesses that complete culture, does not 'weep' over the failure of"
14602,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'a theory of the quantification of the predicate', nor 'shriek' over"
14603,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the fall of a philosophical formula. A kind of humour is one of the
14604,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),conditions of the true mental attitude in the criticism of past stages
14605,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of thought. Humanity cannot afford to be too serious about them, any"
14606,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),more than a man of good sense can afford to be too serious in looking
14607,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"back upon his own childhood. Plato, whom Coleridge claims as the first"
14608,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of his spiritual ancestors, Plato, as we remember him, a true"
14609,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"humanist, with Petrarch and Goethe and M. Renan, holds his theories"
14610,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"lightly, glances with a blithe and naïve inconsequence from one view"
14611,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"to another, not anticipating the burden of meaning 'views' will one"
14612,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),day have for humanity. In reading him one feels how lately it was that
14613,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Croesus thought it a paradox to say that external prosperity was not
14614,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),necessarily happiness. But on Coleridge lies the whole weight of the
14615,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sad reflection that has since come into the world, with which for us"
14616,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the air is full, which the children in the market-place repeat to each"
14617,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"other. Even his language is forced and broken, lest some saving"
14618,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"formula should be lost--'distinctities', 'enucleation', 'pentad of"
14619,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"operative Christianity'--he has a whole vocabulary of such phrases,"
14620,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and expects to turn the tide of human thought by fixing the sense of
14621,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"such expressions as 'reason', 'understanding', 'idea'."
14622,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14623,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Again, he has not the jealousy of the true artist in excluding all"
14624,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),associations that have no charm or colour or gladness in them;
14625,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),everywhere he allows the impress of an inferior theological
14626,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),literature; he is often prolix and importunate about most indifferent
14627,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"heroes--Sir Alexander Ball, Dr. Bell, even Dr. Bowyer, the coarse"
14628,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),pedant of the Blue-coat School. And the source of all this is closely
14629,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),connected with the source of his literary activity. For Coleridge had
14630,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),chosen as the mark of his literary egotism a kind of intellectual
14631,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"_tour de force_--to found a religious philosophy, to do something with"
14632,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the 'idea' in spite of the essential nature of the 'idea'. And
14633,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"therefore all is fictitious from the beginning. He had determined,"
14634,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that which is humdrum, insipid, which the human spirit has done with,"
14635,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),shall yet stimulate and inspire. What he produced symbolizes this
14636,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"purpose--the mass of it _ennuyant_, depressing: the _Aids to"
14637,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Reflection_, for instance, with Archbishop Leighton's vague pieties"
14638,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),all twisted into the jargon of a spiritualistic philosophy. But
14639,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sometimes 'the pulse of the God's blood' does transmute it, kindling"
14640,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),here and there a spot that begins to live; as in that beautiful
14641,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"fragment at the end of the _Church and State_, or in the distilled and"
14642,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),concentrated beauty of such a passage as this:
14643,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14644,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The first range of hills, that encircles the scanty vale of"
14645,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"human life, is the horizon for the majority of its"
14646,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),inhabitants. On its ridges the common sun is born and
14647,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"departs. From them the stars rise, and touching them they"
14648,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"vanish. By the many, even this range, the natural limit and"
14649,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"bulwark of the vale, is but imperfectly known. Its higher"
14650,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),ascents are too often hidden by mists and clouds from

14668,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sensitiveness, and passion. From his tenth to his eighteenth year he"
14669,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"was at a rough school in London. Speaking of this time, he says:"

14684,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),inward--'at fourteen I was in a continual state of low fever.' He
14685,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"becomes a dreamer, an eager student, but without ambition."
14686,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14687,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"This depressed boy is nevertheless, on the spiritual side, the child"
14688,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of a noble house. At twenty-five he is exercising a wonderful charm,"
14689,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and has defined for himself a peculiar line of intellectual activity.
14690,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"He had left Cambridge without a degree, a Unitarian. Unable to take"
14691,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"orders, he determined through Southey's influence to devote himself to"
14692,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),literature. When he left Cambridge there was a prejudice against him
14693,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which has given occasion to certain suspicions. Those who knew him
14694,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),best discredit these suspicions. What is certain is that he was
14695,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"subject to fits of violent, sometimes fantastic, despondency. He"
14696,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"retired to Stowey, in Somersetshire, to study poetry and philosophy."
14697,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In 1797 his poetical gift was in full flower; he wrote _Kubla Khan_,"
14698,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the first part of _Christabel_, and _The Ancient Mariner_. His"
14699,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),literary success grew in spite of opposition. He had a strange
14700,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"attractive gift of conversation, or rather of monologue, as De Stael"
14701,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"said, full of _bizarrerie_, with the rapid alternations of a dream,"
14702,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and here and there a sudden summons into a world strange to the
14703,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"hearer, abounding with images drawn from a sort of divided, imperfect"
14704,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life, as of one to whom the external world penetrated only in part,"
14705,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and, blended with all this, passages of the deepest obscurity,"
14706,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"precious only for their musical cadence, the echo in Coleridge of the"
14707,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"eloquence of the older English writers, of whom he was so ardent a"
14708,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),lover. All through this brilliant course we may discern the power of
14709,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the Asiatic temperament, of that voluptuousness which is perhaps"
14710,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"connected with his appreciation of the intimacy, the almost mystical"
14711,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"_rapport_, between man and nature. 'I am much better', he writes, 'and"
14712,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),my new and tender health is all over me like a voluptuous feeling.'
14713,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14714,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"And whatever fame, or charm, or life-inspiring gift he has had is the"
14715,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"vibration of the interest he excited then, the propulsion into years"
14716,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that clouded his early promise of that first buoyant, irresistible"
14717,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),self-assertion: so great is even the indirect power of a sincere
14718,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"effort towards the ideal life, of even a temporary escape of the"
14719,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),spirit from routine. Perhaps the surest sign of his election--that he
14720,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"was indeed, on the spiritual side, the child of a noble house--is that"
14721,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"story of the Pantisocratic scheme, which at this distance looks so"
14722,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"grotesque. In his enthusiasm for the French Revolution, the old"
14723,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),communistic dream with its appeal to nature (perhaps a little
14724,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"theatrical), touched him, as it had touched Rousseau, Saint-Pierre,"
14725,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and Chateaubriand. He had married one, his affection for whom seems to"
14726,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),have been only a passing feeling; with her and a few friends he was to
14727,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),found a communistic settlement on the banks of the Susquehannah--'the
14728,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),name was pretty and metrical.' It was one of Coleridge's lightest
14729,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),dreams; but also one which could only have passed through the liberal
14730,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"air of his earlier life. The later years of the French Revolution,"
14731,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which for us have discredited all such dreams, deprived him of that"
14732,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),youthfulness which is the preservative element in a literary talent.
14733,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14734,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In 1798, he visited Germany. A beautiful fragment of this period"
14735,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"remains, describing a spring excursion to the Brocken. His excitement"
14736,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"still vibrates in it. Love, all joyful states of mind, are"
14737,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"self-expressive; they loosen the tongue, they fill the thoughts with"
14738,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sensuous images, they harmonize one with the world of sight. We hear"
14739,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of the 'rich graciousness and courtesy' of Coleridge's manner, of the"
14740,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"white and delicate skin, the abundant black hair, the full, almost"
14741,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"animal lips, that whole physiognomy of the dreamer already touched"
14742,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"with fanaticism. One says of the text of one of his Unitarian sermons,"
14743,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'his voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes'; another,"
14744,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'he talks like an angel, and does--nothing.'"
14745,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14746,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Meantime, he had designed an intellectual novelty in the shape of a"
14747,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),religious philosophy. Socinian theology and the philosophy of Hartley
14748,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"had become distasteful. 'Whatever is against right reason, that no"
14749,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),faith can oblige us to believe.' Coleridge quotes these words from
14750,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Jeremy Taylor. And yet ever since the dawn of the Renaissance, had"
14751,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"subsisted a conflict between reason and faith. From the first, indeed,"
14752,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the Christian religion had affirmed the existence of such a conflict,"
14753,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and had even based its plea upon its own weakness in it. In face of
14754,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the classical culture, with its deep wide-struck roots in the world as"
14755,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it permanently exists, St. Paul asserted the claims of that which"
14756,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),could not appeal with success to any genuinely human principle.
14757,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Paradox as it was, that was the strength of the new spirit; for how"
14758,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),much is there at all times in humanity which cannot appeal with
14759,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),success for encouragement or tolerance to any genuinely human
14760,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),principle. In the Middle Ages it might seem that faith had reconciled
14761,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),itself to philosophy; the Catholic church was the leader of the
14762,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),world's life as well as of the spirit's. Looking closer we see that
14763,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the conflict is still latent there; the supremacy of faith is only a
14764,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),part of the worship of sorrow and weakness which marks the age. The
14765,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"weak are no longer merely a majority, they are all Europe. It is not"
14766,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that faith has become one with reason; but a strange winter, a strange"
14767,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"suspension of life, has passed over the classical culture which is"
14768,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),only the human reason in its most trenchant form. Glimpse after
14769,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"glimpse, as that pagan culture awoke to life, the conflict was felt"
14770,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),once more. It is at the court of Frederick II that the Renaissance
14771,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),first becomes discernible as an actual power in European society. How
14772,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),definite and unmistakable is the attitude of faith towards that! Ever
14773,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),since the Reformation all phases of theology had been imperfect
14774,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"philosophies--that is, in which there was a religious _arrière"
14775,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),pensée_; philosophies which could never be in the ascendant in a
14776,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sincerely scientific sphere. The two elements had never really mixed.
14777,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Writers so different as Locke and Taylor have each his liberal
14778,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"philosophy, and each has his defence of the orthodox belief; but,"
14779,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"also, each has a divided mind; we wonder how the two elements could"
14780,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"have existed side by side; brought together in a single mind, but"
14781,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"unable to fuse in it, they reveal their radical contrariety. The"
14782,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Catholic church and humanity are two powers that divide the intellect
14783,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and spirit of man. On the Catholic side is faith, rigidly logical as"
14784,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Ultramontanism, with a proportion of the facts of life, that is, all"
14785,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that is despairing in life coming naturally under its formula. On the
14786,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"side of humanity is all that is desirable in the world, all that is"
14787,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sympathetic with its laws, and succeeds through that sympathy."
14788,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Doubtless, for the individual, there are a thousand intermediate"
14789,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"shades of opinion, a thousand resting-places for the religious spirit;"
14790,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"still, [Greek: to diorizein ouk esti tôn pollôn], fine distinctions"
14791,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"are not for the majority; and this makes time eventually a dogmatist,"
14792,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"working out the opposition in its most trenchant form, and fixing the"
14793,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"horns of the dilemma; until, in the present day, we have on one side"
14794,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Pius IX, the true descendant of the fisherman, issuing the Encyclical,"
14795,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),pleading the old promise against the world with a special kind of
14796,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"justice; and on the other side, the irresistible modern culture,"
14797,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which, as religious men often remind us, is only Christian"
14798,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),accidentally.
14799,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14800,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The peculiar temper of Coleridge's intellect made the idea of
14801,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),reconciling this conflict very seductive. With a true speculative
14802,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),talent he united a false kind of subtlety and the full share of
14803,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),vanity. A dexterous intellectual _tour de force_ has always an
14804,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),independent charm; and therefore it is well for the cause of truth
14805,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"that the directness, sincerity, and naturalness of things are beyond a"
14806,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),certain limit sacrificed in vain to a factitious interest. A method so
14807,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),forced as that of Coleridge's religious philosophy is from the first
14808,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"doomed to be insipid, so soon as the temporary interest or taste or"
14809,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"curiosity it was designed to meet has passed away. Then, as to the"
14810,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"manner of such books as the _Aids to Reflection_, or _The"
14811,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Friend_:--These books came from one whose vocation was in the world of
14812,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"art; and yet, perhaps, of all books that have been influential in"
14813,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"modern times, they are farthest from the classical form--bundles of"
14814,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),notes--the original matter inseparably mixed up with that borrowed
14815,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"from others--the whole, just that mere preparation for an artistic"
14816,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),effect which the finished artist would be careful one day to destroy.
14817,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Here, again, we have a trait profoundly characteristic of Coleridge."
14818,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"He often attempts to reduce a phase of thought, subtle and exquisite,"
14819,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),to conditions too rough for it. He uses a purely speculative gift in
14820,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"direct moral edification. Scientific truth is something fugitive,"
14821,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"relative, full of fine gradations; he tries to fix it in absolute"
14822,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"formulas. The _Aids to Reflection_, or _The Friend_, is an effort to"
14823,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),propagate the volatile spirit of conversation into the less ethereal
14824,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),fabric of a written book; and it is only here and there that the
14825,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"poorer matter becomes vibrant, is really lifted by the spirit."
14826,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14827,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"At forty-two, we find Coleridge saying in a letter:"
14828,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14829,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),I feel with an intensity unfathomable by words my utter
14830,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"nothingness, impotence, and worthlessness in and for myself."
14831,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"I have learned what a sin is against an infinite,"
14832,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),imperishable being such as is the soul of man. The
14833,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"consolations, at least the sensible sweetness of hope, I do"
14834,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"not possess. On the contrary, the temptation which I have"
14835,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"constantly to fight up against is a fear that, if"
14836,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),annihilation and the possibility of heaven were offered to
14837,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"my choice, I should choose the former."
14838,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14839,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),What was the cause of this change? That is precisely the point on
14840,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which, after all the gossip there has been, we are still ignorant. At"
14841,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),times Coleridge's opium excesses were great; but what led to those
14842,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),excesses must not be left out of account. From boyhood he had a
14843,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"tendency to low fever, betrayed by his constant appetite for bathing"
14844,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and swimming, which he indulged even when a physician had opposed it."
14845,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In 1803, he went to Malta as secretary to the English Governor. His"
14846,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"daughter suspects that the source of the evil was there, that for one"
14847,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of his constitution the climate of Malta was deadly. At all events,"
14848,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"when he returned, the charm of those five wonderful years had failed"
14849,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),at the source.
14850,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14851,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"De Quincey said of him, 'he wanted better bread than can be made with"
14852,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),wheat.' Lamb said of him that from boyhood he had 'hungered for
14853,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),eternity'. Henceforth those are the two notes of his life. From this
14854,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),time we must look for no more true literary talent in him. His style
14855,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"becomes greyer and greyer, his thoughts _outré_, exaggerated, a kind"
14856,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),of credulity or superstition exercised upon abstract words. Like
14857,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Clifford, in Hawthorne's beautiful romance--the born Epicurean, who by"
14858,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),some strange wrong has passed the best of his days in a prison--he is
14859,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the victim of a division of the will, often showing itself in trivial"
14860,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),things: he could never choose on which side of the garden path he
14861,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"would walk. In 1803, he wrote a poem on 'The Pains of Sleep'. That"
14862,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),unrest increased. Mr. Gillman tells us 'he had long been greatly
14863,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"afflicted with nightmare, and when residing with us was frequently"
14864,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),aroused from this painful sleep by any one of the family who might
14865,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),hear him'.
14866,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14867,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),That faintness and continual dissolution had its own consumptive
14868,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"refinements, and even brought, as to the 'Beautiful Soul' in _Wilhelm"
14869,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Meister_, a faint religious ecstasy--that 'singing in the sails' which"
14870,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is not of the breeze. Here, again, is a note of Coleridge's:"
14871,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14872,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'In looking at objects of nature while I am thinking, as at"
14873,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"yonder moon, dim-glimmering through the window-pane, I seem"
14874,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"rather to be seeking, as it were asking, a symbolical"
14875,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),language for something within me that already and for ever
14876,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"exists, than observing anything new. Even when that latter"
14877,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is the case, yet still I have always an obscure feeling, as"
14878,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),if that new phenomenon were the dim awaking of a forgotten
14879,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or hidden truth of my inner nature.' Then, 'while I was"
14880,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"preparing the pen to write this remark, I lost the train of"
14881,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),thought which had led me to it.'
14882,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14883,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),What a distemper of the eye of the mind! What an almost bodily
14884,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),distemper there is in that!
14885,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14886,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge's intellectual sorrows were many; but he had one singular
14887,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intellectual happiness. With an inborn taste for transcendental
14888,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),philosophy he lived just at the time when that philosophy took an
14889,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"immense spring in Germany, and connected itself with a brilliant"
14890,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"literary movement. He had the luck to light upon it in its freshness,"
14891,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and introduce it to his countrymen. What an opportunity for one reared
14892,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"on the colourless English philosophies, but who feels an irresistible"
14893,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),attraction towards metaphysical synthesis! How rare are such occasions
14894,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of intellectual contentment! This transcendental philosophy, chiefly"
14895,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"as systematized by Schelling, Coleridge applies, with an eager,"
14896,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"unwearied subtlety, to the questions of theology and art-criticism. It"
14897,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),is in his theory of art-criticism that he comes nearest to true and
14898,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),important principles; that is the least fugitive part of his work. Let
14899,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),us take this first; here we shall most clearly apprehend his main
14900,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),principle.
14901,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14902,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"What, then, is the essence of this criticism? On the whole it may be"
14903,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),described as an attempt to reclaim the world of art as a world of
14904,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),fixed laws--to show that the creative activity of genius and the
14905,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),simplest act of thought are but higher and lower products of the laws
14906,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of a universal logic. Criticism, feeling its own unsuccess in dealing"
14907,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"with the greater works of art, has sometimes made too much of those"
14908,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),dark and capricious suggestions of genius which even the intellect
14909,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),possessed by them is unable to track or recall. It has seemed due to
14910,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),their half-sacred character to look for no link between the process by
14911,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which they were produced and the slighter processes of the mind.
14912,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Coleridge assumes that the highest phases of thought must be more, not"
14913,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"less, than the lower, subjects of law."
14914,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
14915,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"With this interest, in the _Biographia Literaria_, he refines"
14916,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Schelling's 'Philosophy of Nature' into a theory of art. 'Es giebt
14917,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"kein Plagiat in der Philosophie' says Heine, alluding to the charge"
14918,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"brought against Schelling of unacknowledged borrowing from Bruno, and"
14919,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),certainly that which is common to Coleridge and Schelling is of far
14920,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"earlier origin than the Renaissance. Schellingism, the 'Philosophy of"
14921,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Nature', is indeed a constant tradition in the history of thought; it"
14922,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),embodies a permanent type of the speculative temper. That mode of
14923,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),conceiving nature as a mirror or reflex of the intelligence of man may
14924,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),be traced up to the first beginnings of Greek speculation. There are
14925,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),two ways of envisaging those aspects of nature which appear to bear
14926,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the impress of reason or intelligence. There is the deist's way, which"
14927,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"regards them merely as marks of design, which separates the informing"
14928,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"mind from nature, as the mechanist from the machine; and there is the"
14929,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"pantheistic way, which identifies the two, which regards nature itself"
14930,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"as the living energy of an intelligence of the same kind as, but"
14931,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"vaster than, the human. Greek philosophy, finding indications of mind"
14932,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"everywhere, dwelling exclusively in its observations on that which is"
14933,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"general or formal, on that which modern criticism regards as the"
14934,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"modification of things by the mind of the observer, adopts the latter,"
14935,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or pantheistic way, through the influence of the previous mythological"
14936,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"period. Mythology begins in the early necessities of language, of"
14937,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which it is a kind of accident. But at a later period its essence
14938,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"changes; it becomes what it was not at its birth, the servant of a"
14939,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"genuine poetic interest, a kind of _vivification_ of nature. Played"
14940,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"upon by those accidents of language, the Greek mind becomes possessed"
14941,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"by the conception of nature as living, thinking, almost speaking to"
14942,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the mind of man. This unfixed poetical prepossession, reduced to an"
14943,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"abstract form, petrified into an idea, is the conception which gives a"
14944,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),unity of aim to Greek philosophy. Step by step it works out the
14945,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"substance of the Hegelian formula: 'Was ist, das ist vernünftig; was"
14946,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"vernünftig ist, das ist'--'Whatever is, is according to reason;"
14947,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"whatever is according to reason, that is.' A science of which that"
14948,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),could be the formula is still but an intellectual aspiration; the
14949,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"formula of true science is different. Experience, which has gradually"
14950,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"saddened the earth's colour, stiffened its motions, withdrawn from it"
14951,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"some blithe and debonair presence, has moderated our demands upon"
14952,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),science. The positive method makes very little account of marks of
14953,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intelligence in nature; in its wider view of phenomena it sees that
14954,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"those incidents are a minority, and may rank as happy coincidences; it"
14955,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),absorbs them in the simpler conception of law. But the suspicion of a
14956,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"mind latent in nature, struggling for release and intercourse with the"
14957,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"intellect of man through true ideas, has never ceased to haunt a"
14958,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),certain class of minds. Started again and again in successive periods
14959,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"by enthusiasts on the antique pattern, in each case the thought has"
14960,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),seemed paler and more evanescent amidst the growing consistency and
14961,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sharpness of outline of other and more positive forms of knowledge.
14962,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Still, wherever a speculative instinct has been united with extreme"
14963,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"inwardness of temperament, as in Jakob Böhme, there the old Greek"
14964,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"conception, like some seed floating in the air, has taken root and"
14965,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sprung up anew. Coleridge, thrust inward upon himself, driven from"
14966,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'life in thought and sensation' to life in thought only, feels in that"
14967,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),dark London school a thread of the Greek mind vibrating strangely in
14968,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"him. At fifteen he is discoursing on Plotinus, and has translated the"
14969,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),hymns of Synesius. So in later years he reflects from Schelling the
14970,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),flitting tradition. He conceives a subtle co-ordination between the
14971,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),ideas of the mind and the laws of the natural world. Science is to be
14972,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"attained, not by observation, analysis, generalization, but by the"
14973,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"evolution or recovery of those ideas from within, by a sort of [Greek:"
14974,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"anamnêsis], every group of observed facts remaining an enigma until"
14975,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the appropriate idea is struck upon them from the mind of Newton or
14976,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Cuvier, the genius in whom sympathy with the universal reason is"
14977,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),entire. Next he supposes that this reason or intelligence in nature
14978,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),gradually becomes reflective--self-conscious. He fancies he can track
14979,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),through all the simpler orders of life fragments of an eloquent
14980,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),prophecy about the human mind. He regards the whole of nature as a
14981,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"development of higher forms out of the lower, through shade after"
14982,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),shade of systematic change. The dim stir of chemical atoms towards the
14983,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"axes of a crystal form, the trance-like life of plants, the animal"
14984,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"troubled by strange irritabilities, are stages which anticipate"
14985,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),consciousness. All through that increasing stir of life this was
14986,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),forming itself; each stage in its unsatisfied susceptibilities seeming
14987,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),to be drawn out of its own limits by the more pronounced current of
14988,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life on its confines, the 'shadow of approaching humanity' gradually"
14989,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"deepening, the latent intelligence working to the surface. At this"
14990,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),point the law of development does not lose itself in caprice; rather
14991,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),it becomes more constraining and incisive. From the lowest to the
14992,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"highest acts of intelligence, there is another range of refining"
14993,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"shades. Gradually the mind concentrates itself, frees itself from the"
14994,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"limits of the particular, the individual, attains a strange power of"
14995,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),modifying and centralizing what it receives from without according to
14996,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"an inward ideal. At last, in imaginative genius, ideas become"
14997,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"effective; the intelligence of nature, with all its elements connected"
14998,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and justified, is clearly reflected; and the interpretation of its"
14999,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),latent purposes is fixed in works of art.
15000,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15001,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In this fanciful and bizarre attempt to rationalize art, to range it"
15002,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"under the dominion of law, there is still a gap to be filled up. What"
15003,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is that common law of the mind, of which a work of art and the"
15004,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),slighter acts of thought are alike products? Here Coleridge weaves in
15005,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Kant's fine-spun theory of the transformation of sense into
15006,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),perception. What every theory of perception has to explain is that
15007,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),associative power which gathers isolated sensible qualities into the
15008,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"objects of the world about us. Sense, without an associative power,"
15009,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"would be only a threadlike stream of colours, sounds, odours--each"
15010,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"struck upon one for a moment, and then withdrawn. The basis of this"
15011,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"association may be represented as a material one, a kind of"
15012,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),many-coloured 'etching' on the brain. Hartley has dexterously handled
15013,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),this hypothesis. The charm of his 'theory of vibrations' is the vivid
15014,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),image it presents to the fancy. How large an element in a speculative
15015,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"talent is the command of these happy images! Coleridge, by a finer"
15016,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"effort of the same kind, a greater delicacy of fancy, detects all"
15017,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sorts of slips, transitions, breaks of continuity in Hartley's"
15018,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"glancing cobweb. Coleridge, with Kant, regards all association as"
15019,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"effected by a power within, to which he gives a fanciful Greek"
15020,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),name.[39] In an act of perception there is the matter which sense
15021,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"presents, colour, tone, feeling; but also a form or mould, such as"
15022,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"space, unity, causation, suggested from within. In these forms we"
15023,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),arrest and frame the many attributes of sense. It is like that simple
15024,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),chemical phenomenon where two colourless fluids uniting reflect a full
15025,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),colour. Neither matter nor form can be perceived asunder; they unite
15026,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),into the many-coloured image of life. This theory has not been able to
15027,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"bear a loyal induction. Even if it were true, how little it would tell"
15028,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"us; how it attenuates fact! There, again, the charm is all in the"
15029,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),clear image; the image of the artist combining a few elementary
15030,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"colours, curves, sounds into a new whole. Well, this power of"
15031,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"association, of concentrating many elements of sense in an object of"
15032,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"perception, is refined and deepened into the creative acts of"
15033,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),imagination.
15034,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15035,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),[39] Esemplastic.
15036,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15037,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),We of the modern ages have become so familiarized with the greater
15038,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),works of art that we are little sensitive of the act of creation in
15039,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),them; they do not impress us as a new presence in the world. Only
15040,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sometimes in productions which realize immediately a profound emotion
15041,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and enforce a change in taste, such as _Werther_ or _Emile_, we are"
15042,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),actual witnesses of the moulding of an unforeseen type by some new
15043,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"principle of association. By imagination, the distinction between"
15044,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which and fancy is so thrust upon his readers, Coleridge means a"
15045,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"vigorous act of association, which, by simplifying and restraining"
15046,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"their natural expression to an artificial order, refines and perfects"
15047,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the types of human passion. It represents the excitements of the
15048,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"human kind, but reflected in a new manner, 'excitement itself"
15049,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"imitating order.' 'Originally the offspring of passion,' he somewhere"
15050,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"says, 'but now the adopted children of power.' So far there is nothing"
15051,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),new or distinctive; every one who can receive from a poem or picture a
15052,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),total impression will admit so much. What makes the view distinctive
15053,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),in Coleridge are the Schellingistic associations with which he colours
15054,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it, that faint glamour of the philosophy of nature which was ever"
15055,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),influencing his thoughts. That suggested the idea of a subtly winding
15056,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"parallel, a 'rapport' in every detail, between the human mind and the"
15057,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"world without it, laws of nature being so many transformed ideas."
15058,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Conversely, the ideas of the human mind would be only transformed"
15059,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),laws. Genius would be in a literal sense an exquisitely purged
15060,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sympathy with nature. Those associative conceptions of the
15061,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"imagination, those unforeseen types of passion, would come, not so"
15062,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"much of the artifice and invention of the understanding, as from"
15063,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),self-surrender to the suggestions of nature; they would be evolved by
15064,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the stir of nature itself realizing the highest reach of its latent
15065,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intelligence; they would have a kind of antecedent necessity to rise
15066,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),at some time to the surface of the human mind.
15067,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15068,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),It is natural that Shakespeare should be the idol of all such
15069,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"criticism, whether in England or Germany. The first effect in"
15070,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Shakespeare is that of capricious detail, of the waywardness that"
15071,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),plays with the parts careless of the impression of the whole. But
15072,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"beyond there is the constraining unity of effect, the uneffaceable"
15073,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"impression, of _Hamlet_ or _Macbeth_. His hand moving freely is"
15074,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"curved round by some law of gravitation from within; that is, there is"
15075,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the most constraining unity in the most abundant variety. Coleridge
15076,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),exaggerates this unity into something like the unity of a natural
15077,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"organism, the associative act that effected it into something closely"
15078,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),akin to the primitive power of nature itself. 'In the Shakespearian
15079,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"drama', he says, 'there is a vitality which grows and evolves itself"
15080,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),from within.' Again:
15081,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15082,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"He, too, worked in the spirit of nature, by evolving the"
15083,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),germ from within by the imaginative power according to the
15084,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"idea. For as the power of seeing is to light, so is an idea"
15085,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),in mind to a law in nature. They are correlatives which
15086,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),suppose each other.
15087,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15088,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Again:
15089,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15090,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The organic form is innate; it shapes, as it develops,"
15091,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"itself from within, and the fulness of its development is"
15092,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),one and the same with the perfection of its outward form.
15093,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Such as the life is, such is the form. Nature, the prime"
15094,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"genial artist, inexhaustible in diverse powers, is equally"
15095,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),inexhaustible in forms; each exterior is the physiognomy of
15096,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the being within, and even such is the appropriate"
15097,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"excellence of Shakespeare, himself a nature humanized, a"
15098,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"genial understanding, directing self-consciously a power and"
15099,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),an implicit wisdom deeper even than our consciousness.
15100,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15101,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),There 'the absolute' has been affirmed in the sphere of art; and
15102,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),thought begins to congeal. Coleridge has not only overstrained the
15103,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"elasticity of his hypothesis, but has also obscured the true interest"
15104,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of art. For, after all, the artist has become something almost"
15105,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),mechanical; instead of being the most luminous and self-possessed
15106,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"phase of consciousness, the associative act itself looks like some"
15107,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),organic process of assimilation. The work of art is sometimes likened
15108,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),to the living organism. That expresses the impression of a
15109,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"self-delighting, independent life which a finished work of art gives"
15110,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),us; it does not express the process by which that work was produced.
15111,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Here there is no blind ferment of lifeless elements to realize a type.
15112,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"By exquisite analysis the artist attains clearness of idea, then, by"
15113,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"many stages of refining, clearness of expression. He moves slowly over"
15114,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"his work, calculating the tenderest tone, and restraining the subtlest"
15115,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"curve, never letting his hand or fancy move at large, gradually"
15116,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),refining flaccid spaces to the higher degree of expressiveness.
15117,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Culture, at least, values even in transcendent works of art the power"
15118,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of the understanding in them, their logical process of construction,"
15119,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the spectacle of supreme intellectual dexterity which they afford.
15120,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15121,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge's criticism may well be remembered as part of the long
15122,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),pleading of German culture for the things 'behind the veil'. It
15123,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"recalls us from the work of art to the mind of the artist; and, after"
15124,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"all, this is what is infinitely precious, and the work of art only as"
15125,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the index of it. Still, that is only the narrower side of a complete"
15126,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"criticism. Perhaps it is true, as some one says in Lessing's _Emilie"
15127,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Galotti_, that, if Michael Angelo had been born without hands, he"
15128,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),would still have been the greatest of artists. But we must admit the
15129,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"truth also of an opposite view: 'In morals as in art', says M. Renan,"
15130,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),'the word is nothing--the fact is everything. The idea which lurks
15131,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),under a picture of Raphael is a slight matter; it is the picture
15132,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),itself only that counts.'
15133,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15134,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"What constitutes an artistic gift is, first of all, a natural"
15135,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"susceptibility to moments of strange excitement, in which the colours"
15136,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"freshen upon our thread bare world, and the routine of things about"
15137,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),us is broken by a novel and happier synthesis. These are moments into
15138,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which other minds may be made to enter, but which they cannot"
15139,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),originate. This susceptibility is the element of genius in an artistic
15140,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"gift. Secondly, there is what may be called the talent of projection,"
15141,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),of throwing these happy moments into an external concrete form--a
15142,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"statue, or play, or picture. That projection is of all degrees of"
15143,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),completeness; its facility and transparence are modified by the
15144,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"circumstances of the individual, his culture, and his age. When it is"
15145,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"perfectly transparent, the work is classical. Compare the power of"
15146,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"projection in Mr. Browning's _Sordello_, with that power in the"
15147,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),_Sorrows of Werther_. These two elements determine the two chief aims
15148,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of criticism. First, it has to classify those initiative moments"
15149,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"according to the amount of interest excited in them, to estimate their"
15150,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"comparative acceptability, their comparative power of giving joy to"
15151,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"those who undergo them. Secondly, it has to test, by a study of the"
15152,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"artistic product itself, in connexion with the intellectual and"
15153,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritual condition of its age, the completeness of the projection."
15154,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"These two aims form the positive, or concrete, side of criticism;"
15155,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),their direction is not towards a metaphysical definition of the
15156,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"universal element in an artistic effort, but towards a subtle"
15157,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),gradation of the shades of difference between one artistic gift and
15158,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),another. This side of criticism is infinitely varied; and it is what
15159,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),French culture more often achieves than the German.
15160,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15161,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge has not achieved this side in an equal degree with the
15162,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"other; and this want is not supplied by the _Literary Remains_, which"
15163,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"contain his studies on Shakespeare. There we have a repetition, not"
15164,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"an application, of the absolute formula. Coleridge is like one who"
15165,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sees in a picture only the rules of perspective, and is always trying"
15166,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"to simplify even those. Thus: 'Where there is no humour, but only wit,"
15167,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or the like, there is no growth from within.' 'What is beauty'? he"
15168,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"asks. 'It is the unity of the manifold, the coalescence of the"
15169,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),diverse.' So of Dante: 'There is a total impression of infinity; the
15170,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"wholeness is not in vision or conception, but in an inner feeling of"
15171,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"totality and absolute being.' Again, of the _Paradise Lost_: 'It has"
15172,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the totality of the poem as distinguished from the _ab ovo_ birth and
15173,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),parentage or straight line of history.'
15174,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15175,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"That exaggerated inwardness is barren. Here, too, Coleridge's thoughts"
15176,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"require to be thawed, to be set in motion. He is admirable in the"
15177,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"detection, the analysis, and statement of a few of the highest general"
15178,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),laws of art-production. But he withdraws us too far from what we can
15179,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"see, hear, and feel. Doubtless, the idea, the intellectual element, is"
15180,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the spirit and life of art. Still, art is the triumph of the senses"
15181,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and the emotions; and the senses and the emotions must not be cheated
15182,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),of their triumph after all. That strange and beautiful psychology
15183,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which he employs, with its evanescent delicacies, has not sufficient"
15184,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"corporeity. Again, one feels that the discussion about Hartley,"
15185,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"meeting us in the way, throws a tone of insecurity over the critical"
15186,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),theory which it introduces. Its only effect is to win for the terms in
15187,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which that criticism is expressed, the associations of one side in a"
15188,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),metaphysical controversy.
15189,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15190,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The vagueness and fluidity of Coleridge's theological opinions have
15191,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"been exaggerated through an illusion, which has arisen from the"
15192,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"occasional form in which they have reached us. Criticism, then, has to"
15193,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),methodize and focus them. They may be arranged under three heads; the
15194,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"general principles of supernaturalism, orthodox dogmas, the"
15195,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"interpretation of Scripture. With regard to the first and second,"
15196,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge ranks as a Conservative thinker; but his principles of
15197,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Scriptural interpretation resemble Lessing's; they entitle him to be
15198,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),regarded as the founder of the modern liberal school of English
15199,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),theology. By supernaturalism is meant the theory of a divine person in
15200,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"immediate communication with the human mind, dealing with it out of"
15201,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that order of nature which includes man's body and his ordinary trains
15202,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of thought, according to fixed laws, which the theologian sums up in"
15203,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the doctrines of 'grace' and 'sin'. Of this supernaturalism, the _Aids"
15204,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),to Reflection_ attempts to give a metaphysical proof. The first
15205,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"necessity of the argument is to prove that religion, with its supposed"
15206,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"experiences of grace and sin, and the realities of a world above the"
15207,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"world of sense, is the fulfilment of the constitution of every man,"
15208,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or, in the language of the 'philosophy of nature', is part of the"
15209,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'idea' of man; so that, when those experiences are absent, all the"
15210,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"rest of his nature is unexplained, like some enigmatical fragment, the"
15211,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),construction and working of which we cannot surmise. According to
15212,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Schelling's principle, the explanation of every phase of life is to be"
15213,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sought in that next above it. This axiom is applied to three supposed
15214,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"stages of man's reflective life: Prudence, Morality, Religion."
15215,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Prudence, by which Coleridge means something like Bentham's"
15216,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'enlightened principle of self-preservation', is, he says, an"
15217,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"inexplicable instinct, a blind motion in the dark, until it is"
15218,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"expanded into morality. Morality, again, is but a groundless"
15219,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),prepossession until transformed into a religious recognition of a
15220,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritual world, until, as Coleridge says in his rich figurative"
15221,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"language, 'like the main feeder into some majestic lake, rich with"
15222,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"hidden springs of its own, it flows into, and becomes one with, the"
15223,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritual life.' A spiritual life, then, being the fulfilment of human"
15224,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"nature, implied, if we see clearly, in those instincts which enable"
15225,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"one to live on from day to day, is part of the 'idea' of man."
15226,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15227,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The second necessity of the argument is to prove that 'the idea',"
15228,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"according to the principle of the 'philosophy of nature', is an"
15229,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),infallible index of the actual condition of the world without us. Here
15230,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge introduces an analogy:
15231,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15232,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In the world, we see everywhere evidences of a unity, which"
15233,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the component parts are so far from explaining, that they"
15234,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),necessarily presuppose it as the cause and condition of
15235,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"their existing as those parts, or even of their existing at"
15236,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"all. This antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each"
15237,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"union, it has, since the time of Bacon and Kepler, been"
15238,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),customary to call a law. This crocus for instance; or any
15239,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"other flower the reader may have before his sight, or choose"
15240,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"to bring before his fancy; that the root, stem, leaves,"
15241,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"petals, &c., cohere to one plant is owing to an antecedent"
15242,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),power or principle in the seed which existed before a single
15243,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),particle of the matters that constitute the size and
15244,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),visibility of the crocus had been attracted from the
15245,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"surrounding soil, air, and moisture. Shall we turn to the"
15246,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"seed? there, too, the same necessity meets us: an antecedent"
15247,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"unity must here, too, be supposed. Analyse the seeds with"
15248,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the finest tools, and let the solar microscope come in aid"
15249,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of your senses, what do you find?--means and instruments; a"
15250,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"wondrous fairy tale of nature, magazines of food, stores of"
15251,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"various sorts, pipes, spiracles, defences; a house of many"
15252,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"chambers, and the owner and inhabitant invisible."
15253,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15254,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),_Aids to Reflection._
15255,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15256,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Nature, that is, works by what we may call 'intact ideas'. It"
15257,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),co-ordinates every part of the crocus to all the other parts; one
15258,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),stage of its growth to the whole process; and having framed its
15259,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"organism to assimilate certain external elements, it does not cheat it"
15260,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of those elements, soil, air, moisture. Well, if the 'idea' of man is"
15261,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"to be intact, he must be enveloped in a supernatural world; and nature"
15262,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),always works by intact ideas. The spiritual life is the highest
15263,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),development of the idea of man; there must be a supernatural world
15264,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),corresponding to it.
15265,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15266,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"One finds, it is hard to say how many, difficulties in drawing"
15267,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge's conclusion. To mention only one of them--the argument
15268,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),looks too like the exploded doctrine of final causes. Of course the
15269,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),crocus would not live unless the conditions of its life were supplied.
15270,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The flower is made for soil, air, moisture, and it has them; just as"
15271,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"man's senses are made for a sensible world, and we have the sensible"
15272,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"world. But give the flower the power of dreaming, nourish it on its"
15273,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"own reveries, put man's wild hunger of heart and susceptibility to"
15274,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"_ennui_ in it, and what indication of the laws of the world without"
15275,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it, would be afforded by its longing to break its bonds?"
15276,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15277,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"In theology people are content with analogies, probabilities, with the"
15278,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),empty schemes of arguments for which the data are still lacking;
15279,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"arguments, the rejection of which Coleridge tells us implies 'an evil"
15280,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"heart of unbelief', but of which we might as truly say that they"
15281,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),derive all their consistency from the peculiar atmosphere of the mind
15282,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which receives them. Such arguments are received in theology because
15283,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"what chains men to a religion is not its claim on their reason, their"
15284,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"hopes or fears, but the glow it affords to the world, its 'beau"
15285,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"ideal'. Coleridge thinks that if we reject the supernatural, the"
15286,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritual element in life will evaporate also, that we shall have to"
15287,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"accept a life with narrow horizons, without disinterestedness, harshly"
15288,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),cut off from the springs of life in the past. But what is this
15289,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritual element? It is the passion for inward perfection, with its"
15290,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sorrows, its aspirations, its joy. These mental states are the"
15291,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"delicacies of the higher morality of the few, of Augustine, of the"
15292,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"author of the 'Imitation', of Francis de Sales; in their essence they"
15293,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"are only the permanent characteristics of the higher life. Augustine,"
15294,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or the author of the 'Imitation', agreeably to the culture of their"
15295,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"age, had expressed them in the terms of a metaphysical theory, and"
15296,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),expanded them into what theologians call the doctrines of grace and
15297,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sin, the fluctuations of the union of the soul with its unseen friend."
15298,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),The life of those who are capable of a passion for perfection still
15299,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),produces the same mental states; but that religious expression of them
15300,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is no longer congruous with the culture of the age. Still, all inward"
15301,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life works itself out in a few simple forms, and culture cannot go"
15302,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),very far before the religious graces reappear in it in a subtilized
15303,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intellectual shape. There are aspects of the religious character which
15304,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"have an artistic worth distinct from their religious import. Longing,"
15305,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a chastened temper, spiritual joy, are precious states of mind, not"
15306,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"because they are part of man's duty or because God has commanded them,"
15307,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"still less because they are means of obtaining a reward, but because"
15308,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"like culture itself they are remote, refined, intense, existing only"
15309,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),by the triumph of a few over a dead world of routine in which there
15310,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is no lifting of the soul at all. If there is no other world, art in"
15311,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),its own interest must cherish such characteristics as beautiful
15312,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spectacles. Stephen's face, 'like the face of an angel,' has a worth"
15313,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of its own, even if the opened heaven is but a dream."
15314,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15315,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Our culture, then, is not supreme, our intellectual life is"
15316,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"incomplete, we fail of the intellectual throne, if we have no inward"
15317,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"longing, inward chastening, inward joy. Religious belief, the craving"
15318,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"for objects of belief, may be refined out of our hearts, but they must"
15319,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"leave their sacred perfume, their spiritual sweetness behind. This law"
15320,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),of the highest intellectual life has sometimes seemed hard to
15321,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),understand. Those who maintain the claims of the older and narrower
15322,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),forms of religious life against the claims of culture are often
15323,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),embarrassed at finding the intellectual life heated through with the
15324,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),very graces to which they would sacrifice it. How often in the higher
15325,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),class of theological writings--writings which really spring from an
15326,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"original religious genius, such as those of Dr. Newman--does the"
15327,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),modern aspirant to perfect culture seem to find the expression of the
15328,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"inmost delicacies of his own life, the same yet different! The"
15329,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"spiritualities of the Christian life have often drawn men on, little"
15330,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"by little, into the broader spiritualities of systems opposed to"
15331,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it--pantheism, or positivism, or a philosophy of indifference. Many in"
15332,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"our own generation, through religion, have become dead to religion."
15333,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),How often do we have to look for some feature of the ancient religious
15334,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"life, not in a modern saint, but in a modern artist or philosopher!"
15335,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"For those who have passed out of Christianity, perhaps its most"
15336,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),precious souvenir is the ideal of a transcendental disinterestedness.
15337,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Where shall we look for this ideal? In Spinoza; or perhaps in Bentham
15338,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),or in Austin.
15339,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15340,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Some of those who have wished to save supernaturalism--as, for"
15341,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"instance, Theodore Parker--have rejected more or less entirely the"
15342,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),dogmas of the Church. Coleridge's instinct is truer than theirs; the
15343,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),two classes of principles are logically connected. It was in defence
15344,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),of the dogmas of the Church that Coleridge elaborated his unhappy
15345,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),crotchet of the diversity of the reason from the understanding. The
15346,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"weakness of these dogmas had ever been, not so much a failure of the"
15347,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"authority of Scripture or tradition in their favour, as their conflict"
15348,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),with the reason that they were words rather than conceptions. That
15349,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),analysis of words and conceptions which in modern philosophy has been
15350,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a principle of continual rejuvenescence with Descartes and Berkeley,"
15351,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"as well as with Bacon and Locke, had desolated the field of scholastic"
15352,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),theology. It is the rationality of the dogmas of that theology that
15353,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge had a taste for proving.
15354,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15355,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Of course they conflicted with the understanding, with the common"
15356,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"daylight of the mind, but then might there not be some mental faculty"
15357,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),higher than the understanding? The history of philosophy supplied many
15358,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"authorities for this opinion. Then, according to the 'philosophy of"
15359,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"nature', science and art are both grounded upon the 'ideas' of genius,"
15360,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"which are a kind of intuition, which are their own evidence. Again,"
15361,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"this philosophy was always saying the ideas of the mind must be true,"
15362,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"must correspond to reality; and what an aid to faith is that, if one"
15363,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"is not too nice in distinguishing between ideas and mere convictions,"
15364,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"or prejudices, or habitual views, or safe opinions! Kant also had"
15365,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"made a distinction between the reason and the understanding. True,"
15366,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),this harsh division of mental faculties is exactly what is most
15367,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sterile in Kant, the essential tendency of the German school of"
15368,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),thought being to show that the mind always acts _en masse_. Kant had
15369,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"defined two senses of reason as opposed to the understanding. First,"
15370,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"there was the 'speculative reason', with its 'three categories of"
15371,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"totality', God, the soul, and the universe--three mental forms which"
15372,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"might give a sort of unity to science, but to which no actual"
15373,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intuition corresponded. The tendency of this part of Kant's critique
15374,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),is to destroy the rational groundwork of theism. Then there was the
15375,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'practical reason', on the relation of which to the 'speculative', we"
15376,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),may listen to Heinrich Heine:
15377,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15378,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),'After the tragedy comes the farce. [The tragedy is Kant's
15379,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),destructive criticism of the speculative reason.] So far
15380,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Immanuel Kant has been playing the relentless philosopher;
15381,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),he has laid siege to heaven.' Heine goes on with some
15382,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),violence to describe the havoc Kant has made of the orthodox
15383,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"belief: 'Old Lampe,[40] with the umbrella under his arm,"
15384,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"stands looking on much disturbed, perspiration and tears of"
15385,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sorrow running down his cheeks. Then Immanuel Kant grows
15386,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"pitiful, and shows that he is not only a great philosopher"
15387,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"but also a good man. He considers a little; and then, half"
15388,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"in good nature, half in irony, he says, ""Old Lampe must have"
15389,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a god, otherwise the poor man will not be happy; but man"
15390,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"ought to be happy in this life, the practical reason says"
15391,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that; let the practical reason stand surety for the
15392,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"existence of a god; it is all the same to me."" Following"
15393,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"this argument, Kant distinguishes between the theoretical"
15394,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and the practical reason, and, with the practical reason for"
15395,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a magic wand, he brings to life the dead body of deism,"
15396,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which the theoretical reason had slain.'

15399,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15400,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Coleridge first confused the speculative reason with the practical,"
15401,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and then exaggerated the variety and the sphere of their combined
15402,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),functions. Then he has given no consistent definition of the reason.
15403,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),It is 'the power of universal and necessary convictions'; it is 'the
15404,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),knowledge of the laws of the whole considered as one'; it is 'the
15405,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"science of all as a whole'. Again, the understanding is 'the faculty"
15406,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"judging according to sense', or 'the faculty of means to mediate"
15407,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),ends'; and so on. The conception floating in his mind seems to have
15408,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"been a really valuable one; that, namely, of a distinction between an"
15409,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),organ of adequate and an organ of inadequate ideas. But when we find
15410,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"him casting about for a definition, not precisely determining the"
15411,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"functions of the reason, making long preparations for the 'deduction'"
15412,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of the faculty, as in the third column of _The Friend_, but never"
15413,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"actually starting, we suspect that the reason is a discovery in"
15414,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"psychology which Coleridge has a good will to make, and that is all;"
15415,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that he has got no farther than the old vague desire to escape from
15416,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the limitations of thought by some extraordinary mystical faculty.
15417,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Some of the clergy eagerly welcomed the supposed discovery. In their
15418,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),difficulties they had often appealed in the old simple way to
15419,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sentiment and emotion as of higher authority than the understanding,"
15420,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and on the whole had had to get on with very little philosophy. Like
15421,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"M. Jourdain, they were amazed to find that they had been all the time"
15422,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),appealing to the reason; now they might actually go out to meet the
15423,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),enemy. Orthodoxy might be cured by a hair of the dog that had bitten
15424,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),it.
15425,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15426,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Theology is a great house, scored all over with hieroglyphics by"
15427,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"perished hands. When we decipher one of these hieroglyphics, we find"
15428,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),in it the statement of a mistaken opinion; but knowledge has crept
15429,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),onward since the hand dropped from the wall; we no longer entertain
15430,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the opinion, and we can trace the origin of the mistake. Dogmas are"
15431,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"precious as memorials of a class of sincere and beautiful spirits, who"
15432,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"in a past age of humanity struggled with many tears, if not for true"
15433,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"knowledge, yet for a noble and elevated happiness. That struggle is"
15434,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the substance, the dogma only its shadowy expression; received"
15435,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"traditionally in an altered age, it is the shadow of a shadow, a mere"
15436,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"[Greek: triton eidôlon], twice removed from substance and reality. The"
15437,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),true method then in the treatment of dogmatic theology must be
15438,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),historical. Englishmen are gradually finding out how much that method
15439,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),has done since the beginning of modern criticism by the hands of such
15440,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),writers as Baur. Coleridge had many of the elements of this method:
15441,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"learning, inwardness, a subtle psychology, a dramatic power of"
15442,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),sympathy with modes of thought other than his own. Often in carrying
15443,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"out his own method he gives the true historical origin of a dogma,"
15444,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"but, with a strange dullness of the historical sense, he regards this"
15445,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"as a reason for the existence of the dogma now, not merely as reason"
15446,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),for its having existed in the past. Those historical elements he could
15447,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"not envisage in the historical method, because this method is only one"
15448,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of the applications, the most fruitful of them all, of the relative"
15449,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),spirit.
15450,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15451,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"After Coleridge's death, seven letters of his on the inspiration of"
15452,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Scripture were published, under the title of _Confessions of an"
15453,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Inquiring Spirit_. This little book has done more than any other of
15454,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge's writings to discredit his name with the orthodox. The
15455,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"frequent occurrence in it of the word 'bibliolatry', borrowed from"
15456,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Lessing, would sufficiently account for this pious hatred. From"
15457,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"bibliolatry Coleridge was saved by the spiritualism, which, in"
15458,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"questions less simple than that of the infallibility of Scripture, was"
15459,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),so retarding to his culture. Bibliolators may remember that one who
15460,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),committed a kind of intellectual suicide by catching at any appearance
15461,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of a fixed and absolute authority, never dreamed of resting on the"
15462,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),authority of a book. His Schellingistic notion of the possibility of
15463,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"absolute knowledge, of knowing God, of a light within every man which"
15464,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"might discover to him the doctrines of Christianity, tended to"
15465,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"depreciate historical testimony, perhaps historical realism"
15466,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),altogether. Scripture is a legitimate sphere for the understanding. He
15467,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"says, indeed, that there is more in the Bible that 'finds' him than he"
15468,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"has experienced in all other books put together. But still, 'There is"
15469,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"a Light higher than all, even the Word that was in the beginning. If"
15470,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),between this Word and the written letter I shall anywhere seem to
15471,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"myself to find a discrepance, I will not conclude that such there"
15472,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),actually is; nor on the other hand will I fall under the condemnation
15473,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of them that would lie for God, but seek as I may, be thankful for"
15474,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),what I have--and wait.' Coleridge is the inaugurator of that _via
15475,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),media_ of Scriptural criticism which makes much of saving the word
15476,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'inspiration', while it attenuates its meaning; which supposes a sort"
15477,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of modified inspiration residing in the whole, not in the several"
15478,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),parts. 'The Scriptures were not dictated by an infallible
15479,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),intelligence;' nor 'the writers each and all divinely informed as
15480,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"well as inspired'. 'They refer to other documents, and in all points"
15481,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),express themselves as sober-minded and veracious writers under
15482,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),ordinary circumstances are known to do.' To make the Bible itself 'the
15483,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"subject of a special article of faith, is an unnecessary and useless"
15484,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),abstraction'.
15485,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15486,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),His judgement on the popular view of inspiration is severe. It is
15487,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),borrowed from the Cabbalists; it 'petrifies at once the whole body of
15488,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Holy Writ, with all its harmonies and symmetrical gradations;--turns"
15489,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"it at once into a colossal Memnon's head, a hollow passage for a"
15490,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"voice, a voice that mocks the voices of many men, and speaks in their"
15491,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"names, and yet is but one voice and the same;--and no man uttered it"
15492,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),and never in a human heart was it conceived'. He presses very hard on
15493,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the tricks of the 'routiniers of desk and pulpit'; forced and
15494,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),fantastic interpretations; 'the strange--in all other writings
15495,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),unexampled--practice of bringing together into logical dependency
15496,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"detached sentences from books composed at the distance of centuries,"
15497,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"nay, sometimes a millennium, from each other, under different"
15498,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"dispensations, and for different objects.'"
15499,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15500,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Certainly he is much farther from bibliolatry than from the perfect
15501,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),freedom of the humanist interpreters. Still he has not freed himself
15502,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),from the notion of a sacred canon; he cannot regard the books of
15503,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Scripture simply as fruits of the human spirit; his criticism is not
15504,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),entirely disinterested. The difficulties he finds are chiefly the
15505,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),supposed immoralities of Scripture; just those difficulties which fade
15506,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"away before the modern or relative spirit, which in the moral world,"
15507,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"as in the physical traces everywhere change, growth, development. Of"
15508,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"historical difficulties, of those deeper moral difficulties which"
15509,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"arise, for instance, from a consideration of the constitutional"
15510,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"unveracity of the Oriental mind, he has no suspicion. He thinks that"
15511,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),no book of the New Testament was composed so late as A.D. 120.
15512,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15513,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Coleridge's undeveloped opinions would be hardly worth stating except
15514,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),for the warning they afford against retarding compromises. In reading
15515,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),these letters one never doubts what Coleridge tells us of himself:
15516,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'that he loved truth with an indescribable awe,' or, as he beautifully"
15517,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"says, 'that he would creep towards the light, even if the light had"
15518,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),made its way through a rent in the wall of the temple.' And yet there
15519,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),is something sad in reading them by the light which twenty-five years
15520,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"have thrown back upon them. Taken as a whole, they contain a fallacy"
15521,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),which a very ardent lover of truth might have detected.
15522,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15523,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The Bible is not to judge the spirit, but the spirit the Bible. The"
15524,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"Bible is to be treated as a literary product. Well, but that is a"
15525,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"conditional, not an absolute principle--that is not, if we regard it"
15526,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"sincerely, a delivery of judgement, but only a suspension of it. If we"
15527,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"are true to the spirit of that, we must wait patiently the complete"
15528,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),result of modern criticism. Coleridge states that the authority of
15529,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),Scripture is on its trial--that at present it is not known to be an
15530,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"absolute resting-place; and then, instead of leaving that to aid in"
15531,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"the formation of a fearless spirit, the spirit which, for instance,"
15532,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"would accept the results of M. Renan's investigations, he turns it"
15533,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),into a false security by anticipating the judgement of an undeveloped
15534,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"criticism. Twenty-five years of that criticism have gone by, and have"
15535,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),hardly verified the anticipation.
15536,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15537,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"The man of science asks, Are absolute principles attainable? What are"
15538,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),the limits of knowledge? The answer he receives from science itself is
15539,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"not ambiguous. What the moralist asks is, Shall we gain or lose by"
15540,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"surrendering human life to the relative spirit? Experience answers,"
15541,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),that the dominant tendency of life is to turn ascertained truth into a
15542,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),dead letter--to make us all the phlegmatic servants of routine. The
15543,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"relative spirit, by dwelling constantly on the more fugitive"
15544,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"conditions or circumstances of things, breaking through a thousand"
15545,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"rough and brutal classifications, and giving elasticity to inflexible"
15546,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"principles, begets an intellectual finesse, of which the ethical"
15547,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),result is a delicate and tender justness in the criticism of human
15548,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),life. Who would gain more than Coleridge by criticism in such a
15549,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),spirit? We know how his life has appeared when judged by absolute
15550,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"standards. We see him trying to apprehend the absolute, to stereotype"
15551,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"one form of faith, to attain, as he says, 'fixed principles' in"
15552,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"politics, morals, and religion; to fix one mode of life as the essence"
15553,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"of life, refusing to see the parts as parts only; and all the time his"
15554,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),own pathetic history pleads for a more elastic moral philosophy than
15555,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"his, and cries out against every formula less living and flexible than"
15556,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),life itself.
15557,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),
15558,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"'From his childhood he hungered for eternity.' After all, that is the"
15559,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),incontestable claim of Coleridge. The perfect flower of any elementary
15560,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"type of life must always be precious to humanity, and Coleridge is the"
15561,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"perfect flower of the romantic type. More than Childe Harold, more"
15562,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"than Werther, more than René, Coleridge, by what he did, what he was,"
15563,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and what he failed to do, represents that inexhaustible discontent,"
15564,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"languor, and home-sickness, the chords of which ring all through our"
15565,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),modern literature. Criticism may still discuss the claims of classical
15566,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"and romantic art, or literature, or sentiment; and perhaps one day we"
15567,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"may come to forget the horizon, with full knowledge to be content with"
15568,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),what is here and now; and that is the essence of classical feeling.
15569,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"But by us of the present moment, by us for whom the Greek spirit, with"
15570,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"its engaging naturalness, simple, chastened, debonair, [Greek:"
15571,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"tryphês, habrotêtos, chlidês, charitôn, himerou pothou patêr], is"
15572,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"itself the Sangraal of an endless pilgrimage, Coleridge, with his"
15573,COLERIDGE'S WRITINGS (1866),"passion for the absolute, for something fixed where all is moving, his"

15589,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","originality. If we require the originality which consists in weaving,"
15590,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","like a spider, their web from their own bowels; in finding clay, and"
15591,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","making bricks, and building the house; no great men are original. Nor"
15592,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",does valuable originality consist in unlikeness to other men. The hero
15593,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","is in the press of knights, and the thick of events; and, seeing what"
15594,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","men want, and sharing their desire, he adds the needful length of"
15595,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sight and of arm, to come at the desired point. The greatest genius is"
15596,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the most indebted man. A poet is no rattlebrain, saying what comes"
15597,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","uppermost, and, because he says everything, saying, at last, something"
15598,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",good; but a heart in unison with his time and country. There is
15599,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","nothing whimsical and fantastic in his production, but sweet and sad"
15600,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","earnest, freighted with the weightiest convictions, and pointed with"
15601,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",the most determined aim which any man or class knows of in his times.

15605,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","to genius. A great man does not wake up on some fine morning, and say,"

15607,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","to-day I will square the circle: I will ransack botany, and find a"

15611,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","contemporaries. He stands where all the eyes of men look one way, and"
15612,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",their hands all point in the direction in which he should go. The
15613,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","church has reared him amidst rites and pomps, and he carries out the"
15614,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","advice which her music gave him, and builds a cathedral needed by her"
15615,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","chants and processions. He finds a war raging: it educates him, by"
15616,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","trumpet, in barracks, and he betters the instruction. He finds two"
15617,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","counties groping to bring coal, or flour, or fish, from the place of"
15618,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","production to the place of consumption, and he hits on a railroad."
15619,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Every master has found his material collected, and his power lay in"
15620,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","his sympathy with his people, and in his love of the materials he"
15621,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",wrought in. What an economy of power! and what a compensation for the
15622,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",shortness of life! All is done to his hand. The world has brought him
15623,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","thus far on his way. The human race has gone out before him, sunk the"
15624,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","hills, filled the hollows, and bridged the rivers. Men, nations,"
15625,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","poets, artisans, women, all have worked for him, and he enters into"
15626,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","their labours. Choose any other thing, out of the line of tendency,"
15627,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","out of the national feeling and history, and he would have all to do"
15628,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",for himself; his powers would be expended in the first preparations.
15629,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Great genial power, one would almost say, consists in not being"
15630,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",original at all; in being altogether receptive; in letting the world
15631,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed"
15632,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",through the mind.
15633,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15634,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Shakespeare's youth fell in a time when the English people were
15635,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",importunate for dramatic entertainments. The court took offence easily
15636,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","at political allusions, and attempted to suppress them. The Puritans,"
15637,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","a growing and energetic party, and the religious among the Anglican"
15638,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","church, would suppress them. But the people wanted them. Inn-yards,"
15639,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","houses without roofs, and extemporaneous enclosures at country fairs,"
15640,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",were the ready theatres of strolling players. The people had tasted
15641,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","this new joy; and, as we could not hope to suppress newspapers"
15642,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","now,--no, not by the strongest party,--neither then could king,"
15643,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","prelate, or puritan, alone or united, suppress an organ, which was"
15644,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","ballad, epic, newspaper, caucus, lecture, punch, and library, at the"
15645,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","same time. Probably king, prelate, and puritan, all found their own"
15646,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","account in it. It had become, by all causes, a national interest,--by"
15647,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","no means conspicuous, so that some great scholar would have thought of"
15648,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","treating it in an English history,--but not a whit less considerable,"
15649,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","because it was cheap, and of no account, like a baker's shop. The best"
15650,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",proof of its vitality is the crowd of writers which suddenly broke
15651,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","into this field: Kyd, Marlowe, Greene, Jonson, Chapman, Dekker,"
15652,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Webster, Heywood, Middleton, Peele, Ford, Massinger, Beaumont, and"
15653,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Fletcher.
15654,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15655,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","The secure possession, by the stage, of the public mind, is of the"
15656,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",first importance to the poet who works for it. He loses no time in
15657,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",idle experiments. Here is audience and expectation prepared. In the
15658,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","case of Shakespeare, there is much more. At the time when he left"
15659,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Stratford, and went up to London, a great body of stage-plays, of all"
15660,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","dates and writers, existed in manuscript, and were in turn produced"
15661,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","on the boards. Here is the Tale of Troy, which the audience will bear"
15662,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","hearing some part of every week; the Death of Julius Cæsar, and other"
15663,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","stories out of Plutarch, which they never tire of; a shelf full of"
15664,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","English history, from the chronicles of Brut and Arthur, down to the"
15665,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","royal Henries, which men hear eagerly; and a string of doleful"
15666,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","tragedies, merry Italian tales, and Spanish voyages, which all the"
15667,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","London prentices know. All the mass has been treated, with more or"
15668,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","less skill, by every playwright, and the prompter has the soiled and"
15669,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",tattered manuscripts. It is now no longer possible to say who wrote
15670,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","them first. They have been the property of the Theatre so long, and so"
15671,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","many rising geniuses have enlarged or altered them, inserting a"
15672,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","speech, or a whole Scene, or adding a song, that no man can any longer"
15673,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","claim copyright in this work of numbers. Happily, no man wishes to."
15674,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","They are not yet desired in that way. We have few readers, many"
15675,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",spectators and hearers. They had best lie where they are.
15676,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15677,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Shakespeare, in common with his comrades, esteemed the mass of old"
15678,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","plays, waste stock, in which any experiment could be freely tried. Had"
15679,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the _prestige_ which hedges about a modern tragedy existed, nothing"
15680,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",could have been done. The rude warm blood of the living England
15681,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","circulated in the play, as in street-ballads, and gave body which he"
15682,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",wanted to his airy and majestic fancy. The poet needs a ground in
15683,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","popular tradition on which he may work, and which, again, may restrain"
15684,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","his art within the due temperance. It holds him to the people,"
15685,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","supplies a foundation for his edifice; and, in furnishing so much"
15686,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","work done to his hand, leaves him at leisure, and in full strength for"
15687,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the audacities of his imagination. In short, the poet owes to his"
15688,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","legend what sculpture owed to the temple. Sculpture in Egypt, and in"
15689,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Greece, grew up in subordination to architecture. It was the ornament"
15690,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","of the temple wall: at first, a rude relief carved on pediments, then"
15691,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the relief became bolder, and a head or arm was projected from the"
15692,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","wall, the groups being still arranged with reference to the building,"
15693,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","which serves also as a frame to hold the figures; and when, at last,"
15694,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the greatest freedom of style and treatment was reached, the"
15695,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",prevailing genius of architecture still enforced a certain calmness
15696,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and continence in the statue. As soon as the statue was begun for
15697,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","itself, and with no reference to the temple or palace, the art began"
15698,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","to decline; freak, extravagance, and exhibition, took the place of the"
15699,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","old temperance. This balance-wheel, which the sculptor found in"
15700,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","architecture, the perilous irritability of poetic talent found in the"
15701,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",accumulated dramatic materials to which the people were already
15702,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","wonted, and which had a certain excellence which no single genius,"
15703,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","however extraordinary, could hope to create."
15704,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15705,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","In point of fact, it appears that Shakespeare did owe debts in all"
15706,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","directions, and was able to use whatever he found; and the amount of"
15707,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",indebtedness may be inferred from Malone's laborious computations in
15708,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","regard to the First, Second, and Third parts of _Henry VI_, in which,"
15709,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","'out of 6043 lines, 1771 were written by some author preceding"
15710,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Shakespeare; 2373 by him, on the foundation laid by his predecessors;"
15711,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and 1899 were entirely his own.' And the proceeding investigation
15712,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",hardly leaves a single drama of his absolute invention. Malone's
15713,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sentence is an important piece of external history. In _Henry VIII_, I"
15714,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",think I see plainly the cropping out of the original rock on which his
15715,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","own finer stratum was laid. The first play was written by a superior,"
15716,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","thoughtful man, with a vicious ear. I can mark his lines, and know"
15717,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","well their cadence. See Wolsey's soliloquy, and the following scene"
15718,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","with Cromwell, where,--instead of the metre of Shakespeare, whose"
15719,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","secret is, that the thought constructs the tune, so that reading for"
15720,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the sense will best bring out the rhythm,--here the lines are"
15721,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","constructed on a given tune, and the verse has even a trace of pulpit"
15722,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","eloquence. But the play contains, through all its length, unmistakable"
15723,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","traits of Shakespeare's hand, and some passages, as the account of the"
15724,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","coronation, are like autographs. What is odd, the compliment to Queen"
15725,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Elizabeth is in the bad rhythm.
15726,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15727,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Shakespeare knew that tradition supplies a better fable than any
15728,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","invention can. If he lost any credit of design, he augmented his"
15729,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","resources; and, at that day, our petulant demand for originality was"
15730,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",not so much pressed. There was no literature for the million. The
15731,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","universal reading, the cheap press, were unknown. A great poet, who"
15732,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","appears in illiterate times, absorbs into his sphere all the light"
15733,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","which is anywhere radiating. Every intellectual jewel, every flower of"
15734,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sentiment, it is his fine office to bring to his people; and he comes"
15735,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",to value his memory equally with his invention. He is therefore little
15736,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",solicitous whence his thoughts have been derived; whether through
15737,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","translation, whether through tradition, whether by travel in distant"
15738,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","countries, whether by inspiration; from whatever source, they are"
15739,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","equally welcome to his uncritical audience. Nay, he borrows very near"
15740,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",home. Other men say wise things as well as he; only they say a good
15741,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","many foolish things, and do not know when they have spoken wisely. He"
15742,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","knows the sparkle of the true stone, and puts it in high place,"
15743,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","wherever he finds it. Such is the happy position of Homer, perhaps; of"
15744,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Chaucer, of Saadi. They felt that all wit was their wit. And they are"
15745,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","librarians and historiographers, as well as poets. Each romancer was"
15746,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","heir and dispenser of all the hundred tales of the world,--"
15747,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15748,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Presenting Thebes' and Pelops' line,"
15749,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",And the tale of Troy divine.
15750,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15751,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",The influence of Chaucer is conspicuous in all our early literature;
15752,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and, more recently, not only Pope and Dryden have been beholden to"
15753,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","him, but, in the whole society of English writers, a large"
15754,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",unacknowledged debt is easily traced. One is charmed with the opulence
15755,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",which feeds so many pensioners. But Chaucer is a huge borrower.
15756,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Chaucer, it seems, drew continually, through Lydgate and Caxton, from"
15757,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Guido di Colonna, whose Latin romance of the Trojan war was in turn a"
15758,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","compilation from Dares Phrygius, Ovid, and Statius. Then Petrarch,"
15759,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Boccaccio, and the Provençal poets are his benefactors: the _Romaunt"
15760,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",of the Rose_ is only judicious translation from William of Lorris and

15765,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",steals by this apology; that what he takes has no worth where he finds
15766,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","it, and the greatest where he leaves it. It has come to be practically"
15767,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","a sort of rule in literature, that a man, having once shown himself"
15768,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","capable of original writing, is entitled thenceforth to steal from the"
15769,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",writings of others at discretion. Thought is the property of him who
15770,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",can entertain it; and of him who can adequately place it. A certain
15771,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","awkwardness marks the use of borrowed thoughts; but, as soon as we"
15772,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","have learned what to do with them, they become our own."
15773,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15774,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Thus, all originality is relative. Every thinker is retrospective. The"

15778,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the crowd of practical and knowing men, who, by correspondence or"

15780,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and it will bereave his fine attitude and resistance of something of
15781,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","their impressiveness. As Sir Robert Peel and Mr. Webster vote, so"
15782,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Locke and Rousseau think for thousands; and so there were fountains
15783,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","all around Homer, Menu, Saadi, or Milton, from which they drew;"
15784,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","friends, lovers, books, traditions, proverbs,--all perished,--which,"
15785,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","if seen, would go to reduce the wonder. Did the bard speak with"
15786,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",authority? Did he feel himself overmatched by any companion? The
15787,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",appeal is to the consciousness of the writer. Is there at last in his
15788,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","breast a Delphi whereof to ask concerning any thought or thing,"
15789,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","whether it be verily so, yea or nay? and to have answer, and to rely"
15790,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","on that? All the debts which such a man could contract to other wit,"
15791,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",would never disturb his consciousness of originality: for the
15792,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","ministrations of books, and of other minds, are a whiff of smoke to"
15793,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",that most private reality with which he has conversed.
15794,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15795,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","It is easy to see that what is best written or done by genius, in the"
15796,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","world, was no man's work, but came by wide social labour, when a"
15797,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","thousand wrought like one, sharing the same impulse. Our English Bible"
15798,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",is a wonderful specimen of the strength and music of the English
15799,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","language. But it was not made by one man, or at one time; but"
15800,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",centuries and churches brought it to perfection; There never was a
15801,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","time when there was not some translation existing. The Liturgy,"
15802,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","admired for its energy and pathos, is an anthology of the piety of"
15803,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","ages and nations, a translation of the prayers and forms of the"
15804,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Catholic church,--these collected, too, in long periods, from the"
15805,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","prayers and meditations of every saint and sacred writer, all over the"
15806,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","world. Grotius makes the like remark in respect to the Lord's Prayer,"
15807,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","that the single clauses of which it is composed were already in use,"
15808,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","in the time of Christ, in the rabbinical forms. He picked out the"
15809,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","grains of gold. The nervous language of the Common Law, the impressive"
15810,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","forms of our courts, and the precision and substantial truth of the"
15811,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","legal distinctions, are the contribution of all the sharp-sighted,"
15812,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",strong-minded men who have lived in the countries where these laws
15813,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",govern. The translation of Plutarch gets its excellence by being
15814,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",translation on translation. There never was a time when there was
15815,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","none. All the truly idiomatic and national phrases are kept, and all"
15816,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","others successively picked out, and thrown away. Something like the"
15817,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","same process had gone on, long before, with the originals of these"
15818,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","books. The world takes liberties with world-books. Vedas, Æsop's"

15823,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","supplies its time with one good word; every municipal law, every"

15854,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","faithfully from poets and intellectual men, as from courtiers and"
15855,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","frivolous people. Bacon, who took the inventory of the human"

15857,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","though we have strained his few words of regard and panegyric, had no"
15858,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",suspicion of the elastic fame whose first vibrations he was
15859,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",attempting. He no doubt thought the praise he has conceded to him
15860,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","generous, and esteemed himself, out of all question, the better poet"

15877,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",in the universe. Our poet's mask was impenetrable. You cannot see the
15878,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",mountain near. It took a century to make it suspected; and not until
15879,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","two centuries had passed, after his death, did any criticism which we"
15880,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",think adequate begin to appear. It was not possible to write the
15881,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",history of Shakespeare till now; for he is the father of German
15882,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","literature: it was on the introduction of Shakespeare into German, by"
15883,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Lessing, and the translation of his works by Wieland and Schlegel,"
15884,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",that the rapid burst of German literature was most intimately
15885,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","connected. It was not until the nineteenth century, whose speculative"
15886,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","genius is a sort of living Hamlet, that the tragedy of Hamlet could"
15887,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","find such wondering readers. Now, literature, philosophy, and thought"
15888,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","are Shakespearized. His mind is the horizon beyond which, at present,"
15889,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",we do not see. Our ears are educated to music by his rhythm. Coleridge
15890,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and Goethe are the only critics who have expressed our convictions
15891,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",with any adequate fidelity; but there is in all cultivated minds a
15892,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","silent appreciation of his superlative power and beauty, which, like"
15893,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Christianity, qualifies the period."
15894,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15895,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","The Shakespeare Society have inquired in all directions, advertised"
15896,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the missing facts, offered money for any information that will lead"
15897,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",to proof; and with what result? Beside some important illustration of
15898,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the history of the English stage, to which I have adverted, they have"
15899,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","gleaned a few facts touching the property, and dealings in regard to"
15900,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","property, of the poet. It appears that, from year to year, he owned a"
15901,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",larger share in the Blackfriars Theatre: its wardrobe and other
15902,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",appurtenances were his; that he bought an estate in his native
15903,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","village, with his earnings, as writer and shareholder; that he lived"
15904,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",in the best house in Stratford; was intrusted by his neighbours with
15905,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","their commissions in London, as of borrowing money, and the like; that"
15906,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",he was a veritable farmer. About the time when he was writing
15907,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","_Macbeth_, he sues Philip Rogers, in the borough-court of Stratford,"
15908,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","for thirty-five shillings, ten pence, for corn delivered to him at"
15909,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","different times; and, in all respects, appears as a good husband, with"
15910,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",no reputation for eccentricity or excess. He was a good-natured sort
15911,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","of man, an actor and shareholder in the theatre, not in any striking"
15912,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",manner distinguished from other actors and managers. I admit the
15913,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",importance of this information. It was well worth the pains that have
15914,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",been taken to procure it.
15915,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15916,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",But whatever scraps of information concerning his condition these
15917,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","researches may have rescued, they can shed no light upon that infinite"
15918,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",invention which is the concealed magnet of his attraction for us. We
15919,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",are very clumsy writers of history. We tell the chronicle of
15920,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","parentage, birth, birthplace, schooling, schoolmates, earning of"
15921,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","money, marriage, publication of books, celebrity, death; and when we"
15922,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","have come to an end of this gossip, no ray of relation appears"
15923,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","between it and the goddess-born; and it seems as if, had we dipped at"
15924,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","random into the _Modern Plutarch_ and read any other life there, it"
15925,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",would have fitted the poems as well. It is the essence of poetry to
15926,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","spring, like the rainbow daughter of Wonder, from the invisible, to"
15927,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","abolish the past, and refuse all history. Malone, Warburton, Dyce, and"
15928,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Collier have wasted their oil. The famed theatres, Covent Garden,"
15929,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Drury Lane, the Park, and Tremont, have vainly assisted. Betterton,"
15930,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Garrick, Kemble, Kean, and Macready dedicate their lives to this"
15931,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","genius; him they crown, elucidate, obey, and express. The genius knows"
15932,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",them not. The recitation begins; one golden word leaps out immortal
15933,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","from all this painted pedantry, and sweetly torments us with"
15934,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","invitations to its own inaccessible homes. I remember, I went once to"
15935,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","see the Hamlet of a famed performer, the pride of the English stage;"
15936,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and all I then heard, and all I now remember, of the tragedian, was"
15937,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","that in which the tragedian had no part; simply, Hamlet's question to"
15938,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",the ghost:
15939,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
15940,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","What may this mean,"
15941,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel"

15947,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",magic spoil for us the illusions of the green-room. Can any biography
15948,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",shed light on the localities into which the _Midsummer Night's Dream_
15949,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","admits me? Did Shakespeare confide to any notary or parish recorder,"
15950,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sacristan, or surrogate, in Stratford, the genesis of that delicate"

15977,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","him, would most import us to know. We have his recorded convictions on"
15978,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","those questions which knock for answer at every heart,--on life and"
15979,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","death, on love, on wealth and poverty, on the prizes of life, and the"
15980,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","ways whereby we come at them; on the characters of men, and the"
15981,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","influences, occult and open, which affect their fortunes; and on those"
15982,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","mysterious and demoniacal powers which defy our science, and which yet"
15983,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",interweave their malice and their gift in our brightest hours. Who
15984,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","ever read the volume of the Sonnets, without finding that the poet had"
15985,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","there revealed, under masks that are no masks to the intelligent, the"
15986,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",lore of friendship and of love; the confusion of sentiments in the
15987,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","most susceptible, and, at the same time, the most intellectual of men?"
15988,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",What trait of his private mind has he hidden in his dramas? One can
15989,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","discern, in his ample pictures of the gentleman and the king, what"
15990,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","forms and humanities pleased him; his delight in troops of friends, in"
15991,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","large hospitality, in cheerful giving. Let Timon, let Warwick, let"
15992,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Antonio the merchant, answer for his great heart. So far from"
15993,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Shakespeare's being the least known, he is the one person, in all"
15994,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","modern history, known to us. What point of morals, of manners, of"
15995,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","economy, of philosophy, of religion, of taste, of the conduct of life,"
15996,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",has he not settled? What mystery has he not signified his knowledge
15997,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","of? What office, or function, or district of man's work, has he not"
15998,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","remembered? What king has he not taught state, as Talma taught"
15999,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Napoleon? What maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy? What
16000,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",lover has he not outloved? What sage has he not outseen? What
16001,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",gentleman has he not instructed in the rudeness of his behaviour?
16002,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16003,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",Some able and appreciating critics think no criticism on Shakespeare
16004,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","valuable, that does not rest purely on the dramatic merit; that he is"
16005,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",falsely judged as poet and philosopher. I think as highly as these
16006,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","critics of his dramatic merit, but still think it secondary. He was a"
16007,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","full man, who liked to talk; a brain exhaling thoughts and images,"
16008,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","which, seeking vent, found the drama next at hand. Had he been less,"
16009,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","we should have had to consider how well he filled his place, how good"
16010,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","a dramatist he was, and he is the best in the world. But it turns out,"
16011,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",that what he has to say is of that weight as to withdraw some
16012,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",attention from the vehicle; and he is like some saint whose history is
16013,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","to be rendered into all languages, into verse and prose, into songs"
16014,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and pictures, and cut up into proverbs; so that the occasion which"
16015,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","gave the saint's meaning the form of a conversation, or of a prayer,"
16016,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","or of a code of laws, is immaterial, compared with the universality of"
16017,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",its application. So it fares with the wise Shakespeare and his book of
16018,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",life. He wrote the airs for all our modern music: he wrote the text of
16019,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",modern life; the text of manners: he drew the man of England and
16020,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Europe; the father of the man in America: he drew the man, and"
16021,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","described the day, and what is done in it; he read the hearts of men"
16022,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and women, their probity, and their second thought, and wiles; the"
16023,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","wiles of innocence, and the transitions by which virtues and vices"
16024,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",slide into their contraries: he could divide the mother's part from
16025,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the father's part in the face of the child, or draw the fine"
16026,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",demarcations of freedom and of fate: he knew the laws of repression
16027,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",which make the police of nature; and all the sweets and all the
16028,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",terrors of human lot lay in his mind as truly but as softly as the
16029,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",landscape lies on the eye. And the importance of this wisdom of life
16030,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sinks the form, as of Drama or Epic, out of notice. 'Tis like making a"
16031,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",question concerning the paper on which a king's message is written.
16032,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16033,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Shakespeare is as much out of the category of eminent authors, as he"
16034,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","is out of the crowd. He is inconceivably wise; the others,"
16035,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","conceivably. A good reader can, in a sort, nestle into Plato's brain,"
16036,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and think from thence; but not into Shakespeare's. We are still out of
16037,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","doors. For executive faculty, for creation, Shakespeare is unique. No"
16038,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",man can imagine it better. He was the farthest reach of subtlety
16039,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","compatible with an individual self,--the subtilest of authors, and"
16040,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",only just within the possibility of authorship. With this wisdom of
16041,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","life, is the equal endowment of imaginative and of lyric power. He"
16042,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","clothed the creatures of his legend with form and sentiments, as if"
16043,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",they were people who had lived under his roof; and few real men have
16044,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",left such distinct characters as these fictions. And they spoke in
16045,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",language as sweet as it was fit. Yet his talents never seduced him
16046,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","into an ostentation, nor did he harp on one string. An omnipresent"
16047,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",humanity co-ordinates all his faculties. Give a man of talents a story
16048,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","to tell, and his partiality will presently appear. He has certain"
16049,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","observations, opinions, topics, which have some accidental prominence,"
16050,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and which he disposes all to exhibit. He crams this part, and starves"
16051,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","that other part, consulting not the fitness of the thing, but his"
16052,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","fitness and strength. But Shakespeare has no peculiarity, no"
16053,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","importunate topic; but all is duly given; no veins, no curiosities:"
16054,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","no cow-painter, no bird-fancier, no mannerist is he: he has no"
16055,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","discoverable egotism: the great he tells greatly; the small,"
16056,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","subordinately. He is wise without emphasis or assertion; he is strong,"
16057,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","as nature is strong, who lifts the land into mountain slopes without"
16058,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","effort, and by the same rule as she floats a bubble in the air, and"
16059,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",likes as well to do the one as the other. This makes that equality of
16060,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","power in farce, tragedy, narrative, and love-songs; a merit so"
16061,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","incessant, that each reader is incredulous of the perception of other"
16062,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",readers.
16063,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16064,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","This power of expression, or of transferring the inmost truth of"
16065,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","things into music and verse, makes him the type of the poet, and has"
16066,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",added a new problem to metaphysics. This is that which throws him into
16067,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","natural history, as a main production of the globe, and as announcing"
16068,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",new eras and ameliorations. Things were mirrored in his poetry without
16069,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","loss or blur; he could paint the fine with precision, the great with"
16070,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","compass; the tragic and the comic indifferently, and without any"
16071,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",distortion or favour. He carried his powerful execution into minute
16072,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","details, to a hair point; finishes an eyelash or a dimple as firmly as"
16073,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","he draws a mountain; and yet these, like nature's, will bear the"
16074,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",scrutiny of the solar microscope.
16075,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16076,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","In short, he is the chief example to prove that more or less of"
16077,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","production, more or fewer pictures, is a thing indifferent. He had the"
16078,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",power to make one picture. Daguerre learned how to let one flower etch
16079,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",its image on his plate of iodine; and then proceeds at leisure to etch
16080,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",a million. There are always objects; but there was never
16081,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","representation. Here is perfect representation, at last; and now let"
16082,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",the world of figures sit for their portraits. No recipe can be given
16083,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",for the making of a Shakespeare; but the possibility of the
16084,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",translation of things into song is demonstrated.
16085,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16086,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","His lyric power lies in the genius of the piece. The sonnets, though"
16087,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","their excellence is lost in the splendour of the dramas, are as"
16088,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","inimitable as they; and it is not a merit of lines, but a total merit"
16089,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","of the piece; like the tone of voice of some incomparable person, so"
16090,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","is this a speech of poetic beings, and any clause as unproducible now"
16091,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",as a whole poem.
16092,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16093,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Though the speeches in the plays, and single lines, have a beauty"
16094,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","which tempts the ear to pause on them for their euphuism, yet the"
16095,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sentence is so loaded with meaning, and so linked with its foregoers"
16096,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","and followers, that the logician is satisfied. His means are as"
16097,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","admirable as his ends; every subordinate invention, by which he helps"
16098,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","himself to connect some irreconcilable opposites, is a poem too. He is"
16099,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","not reduced to dismount and walk, because his horses are running off"
16100,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",with him in some distant direction: he always rides.
16101,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16102,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",The finest poetry was first experience: but the thought has suffered a
16103,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",transformation since it was an experience. Cultivated men often attain
16104,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","a good degree of skill in writing verses; but it is easy to read,"
16105,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","through their poems, their personal history: any one acquainted with"
16106,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","parties can name every figure: this is Andrew, and that is Rachel. The"
16107,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sense thus remains prosaic. It is a caterpillar with wings, and not"
16108,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","yet a butterfly. In the poet's mind, the fact has gone quite over into"
16109,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the new element of thought, and has lost all that is exuvial. This"
16110,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","generosity abides with Shakespeare. We say, from the truth and"
16111,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","closeness of his pictures, that he knows the lesson by heart. Yet"
16112,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",there is not a trace of egotism.
16113,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16114,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",One more royal trait properly belongs to the poet. I mean his
16115,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","cheerfulness, without which no man can be a poet,--for beauty is his"
16116,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","aim. He loves virtue, not for its obligation, but for its grace: he"
16117,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","delights in the world, in man, in woman, for the lovely light that"
16118,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","sparkles from them. Beauty, the spirit of joy and hilarity, he sheds"
16119,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",over the universe. Epicurus relates that poetry hath such charms that
16120,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",a lover might forsake his mistress to partake of them. And the true
16121,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",bards have been noted for their firm and cheerful temper. Homer lies
16122,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","in sunshine; Chaucer is glad and erect; and Saadi says, 'It was"
16123,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",rumoured abroad that I was penitent; but what had I to do with
16124,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","repentance?' Not less sovereign and cheerful,--much more sovereign and"
16125,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","cheerful, is the tone of Shakespeare. His name suggests joy and"
16126,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",emancipation to the heart of men. If he should appear in any company
16127,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","of human souls, who would not march in his troop? He touches nothing"
16128,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",that does not borrow health and longevity from his festal style.
16129,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16130,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",*       *       *       *       *
16131,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16132,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","And now, how stands the account of man with this bard and benefactor,"
16133,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","when in solitude, shutting our ears to the reverberations of his fame,"
16134,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",we seek to strike the balance? Solitude has austere lessons; it can
16135,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",teach us to spare both heroes and poets; and it weighs Shakespeare
16136,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","also, and finds him to share the halfness and imperfection of"
16137,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",humanity.
16138,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",
16139,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Chaucer, saw the splendour of meaning that"
16140,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",plays over the visible world; knew that a tree had another use than
16141,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","for apples, and corn another than for meal, and the ball of the"
16142,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","earth, than for tillage and roads: that these things bore a second and"
16143,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","finer harvest to the mind, being emblems of its thoughts, and"
16144,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",conveying in all their natural history a certain mute commentary on
16145,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",human life. Shakespeare employed them as colours to compose his
16146,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",picture. He rested in their beauty; and never took the step which
16147,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","seemed inevitable to such genius, namely, to explore the virtue which"
16148,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","resides in these symbols, and imparts this power,--What is that which"
16149,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","they themselves say? He converted the elements, which waited on his"
16150,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","command, into entertainments. He was master of the revels to mankind."
16151,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Is it not as if one should have, through majestic powers of science,"
16152,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the comets given into his hand, or the planets and their moons, and"
16153,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",should draw them from their orbits to glare with the municipal
16154,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","fireworks on a holiday night, and advertise in all towns, 'very"
16155,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","superior pyrotechny this evening!' Are the agents of nature, and the"
16156,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","power to understand them, worth no more than a street serenade, or the"
16157,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",breath of a cigar? One remembers again the trumpet-text in the
16158,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","Koran,--'The heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,"
16159,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",think ye we have created them in jest?' As long as the question is of
16160,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","talent and mental power, the world of men has not his equal to show."
16161,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","But when the question is to life, and its materials, and its"
16162,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","auxiliaries, how does he profit me? What does it signify? It is but a"

16164,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",what signifies another picture more or less? The Egyptian verdict of
16165,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","the Shakespeare Societies comes to mind, that he was a jovial actor"
16166,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",and manager. I cannot marry this fact to his verse. Other admirable
16167,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.",men have led lives in some sort of keeping with their thought; but
16168,"SHAKESPEARE; OR, THE POET. 1850.","this man, in wide contrast. Had he been less, had he reached only the"

16204,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16205,WORDSWORTH (1875),A generation has now passed away since Wordsworth was laid with the
16206,WORDSWORTH (1875),family in the churchyard at Grasmere. Perhaps it is hardly yet time to
16207,WORDSWORTH (1875),take a perfectly impartial measure of his value as a poet. To do this
16208,WORDSWORTH (1875),is especially hard for those who are old enough to remember the last
16209,WORDSWORTH (1875),shot which the foe was sullenly firing in that long war of critics
16210,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which began when he published his manifesto as Pretender, and which"
16211,WORDSWORTH (1875),came to a pause rather than end when they flung up their caps with the
16212,WORDSWORTH (1875),rest at his final coronation. Something of the intensity of the _odium
16213,WORDSWORTH (1875),theologicum_ (if indeed the _aestheticum_ be not in these days the
16214,WORDSWORTH (1875),more bitter of the two) entered into the conflict. The Wordsworthians
16215,WORDSWORTH (1875),"were a sect, who, if they had the enthusiasm, had also not a little of"
16216,WORDSWORTH (1875),the exclusiveness and partiality to which sects are liable. The verses
16217,WORDSWORTH (1875),of the master had for them the virtue of religious canticles stimulant
16218,WORDSWORTH (1875),of zeal and not amenable to the ordinary tests of cold-blooded
16219,WORDSWORTH (1875),"criticism. Like the hymns of the Huguenots and Covenanters, they were"
16220,WORDSWORTH (1875),"songs of battle no less than of worship, and the combined ardours of"
16221,WORDSWORTH (1875),conviction and conflict lent them a fire that was not naturally their
16222,WORDSWORTH (1875),"own. As we read them now, that virtue of the moment is gone out of"
16223,WORDSWORTH (1875),"them, and whatever of Dr. Wattsiness there is gives us a slight shock"
16224,WORDSWORTH (1875),of disenchantment. It is something like the difference between the
16225,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Marseillaise_ sung by armed propagandists on the edge of battle, or"
16226,WORDSWORTH (1875),"by Brissotins in the tumbrel, and the words of it read coolly in the"
16227,WORDSWORTH (1875),"closet, or recited with the factitious frenzy of Thérèse. It was"
16228,WORDSWORTH (1875),natural in the early days of Wordsworth's career to dwell most fondly
16229,WORDSWORTH (1875),on those profounder qualities to appreciate which settled in some sort
16230,WORDSWORTH (1875),the measure of a man's right to judge of poetry at all. But now we
16231,WORDSWORTH (1875),"must admit the shortcomings, the failures, the defects, as no less"
16232,WORDSWORTH (1875),essential elements in forming a sound judgement as to whether the seer
16233,WORDSWORTH (1875),and artist were so united in him as to justify the claim first put in
16234,WORDSWORTH (1875),by himself and afterwards maintained by his sect to a place beside the
16235,WORDSWORTH (1875),"few great poets who exalt men's minds, and give a right direction and"
16236,WORDSWORTH (1875),"safe outlet to their passions through the imagination, while"
16237,WORDSWORTH (1875),insensibly helping them toward balance of character and serenity of
16238,WORDSWORTH (1875),"judgement by stimulating their sense of proportion, form, and the nice"
16239,WORDSWORTH (1875),adjustment of means to ends. In none of our poets has the constant
16240,WORDSWORTH (1875),"propulsion of an unbending will, and the concentration of exclusive,"
16241,WORDSWORTH (1875),"if I must not say somewhat narrow, sympathies done so much to make the"
16242,WORDSWORTH (1875),"original endowment of nature effective, and in none accordingly does"
16243,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the biography throw so much light on the works, or enter so largely"
16244,WORDSWORTH (1875),into their composition as an element whether of power or of weakness.
16245,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth never saw, and I think never wished to see, beyond the"
16246,WORDSWORTH (1875),limits of his own consciousness and experience. He early conceived
16247,WORDSWORTH (1875),"himself to be, and through life was confirmed by circumstances in the"
16248,WORDSWORTH (1875),"faith that he was, a 'dedicated spirit',[41] a state of mind likely"
16249,WORDSWORTH (1875),to further an intense but at the same time one-sided development of
16250,WORDSWORTH (1875),the intellectual powers. The solitude in which the greater part of his
16251,WORDSWORTH (1875),"mature life was passed, while it doubtless ministered to the"
16252,WORDSWORTH (1875),"passionate intensity of his musings upon man and nature, was, it may"
16253,WORDSWORTH (1875),"be suspected, harmful to him as an artist, by depriving him of any"
16254,WORDSWORTH (1875),standard of proportion outside himself by which to test the
16255,WORDSWORTH (1875),"comparative value of his thoughts, and by rendering him more and more"
16256,WORDSWORTH (1875),incapable of that urbanity of mind which could be gained only by
16257,WORDSWORTH (1875),"commerce with men more nearly on his own level, and which gives tone"
16258,WORDSWORTH (1875),without lessening individuality. Wordsworth never quite saw the
16259,WORDSWORTH (1875),distinction between the eccentric and the original. For what we call
16260,WORDSWORTH (1875),"originality seems not so much anything peculiar, much less anything"
16261,WORDSWORTH (1875),"odd, but that quality in a man which touches human nature at most"
16262,WORDSWORTH (1875),"points of its circumference, which reinvigorates the consciousness of"
16263,WORDSWORTH (1875),our own powers by recalling and confirming our own unvalued sensations
16264,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and perceptions, gives classic shape to our own amorphous imaginings,"
16265,WORDSWORTH (1875),and adequate utterance to our own stammering conceptions or emotions.
16266,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The poet's office is to be a Voice, not of one crying in the"
16267,WORDSWORTH (1875),"wilderness to a knot of already magnetized acolytes, but singing amid"
16268,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the throng of men, and lifting their common aspirations and"
16269,WORDSWORTH (1875),sympathies (so first clearly revealed to themselves) on the wings of
16270,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his song to a purer ether and a wider reach of view. We cannot, if we"
16271,WORDSWORTH (1875),"would, read the poetry of Wordsworth as mere poetry; at every other"
16272,WORDSWORTH (1875),page we find ourselves entangled in a problem of aesthetics. The
16273,WORDSWORTH (1875),"world-old question of matter and form, of whether nectar _is_ of"
16274,WORDSWORTH (1875),precisely the same flavour when served to us from a Grecian chalice or
16275,WORDSWORTH (1875),"from any jug of ruder pottery, comes up for decision anew. The"
16276,WORDSWORTH (1875),Teutonic nature has always shown a sturdy preference of the solid bone
16277,WORDSWORTH (1875),with a marrow of nutritious moral to any shadow of the same on the
16278,WORDSWORTH (1875),flowing mirror of sense. Wordsworth never lets us long forget the
16279,WORDSWORTH (1875),"deeply rooted stock from which he sprang,--_vien ben dà lui_."
16280,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16281,WORDSWORTH (1875),[41] In the _Prelude_ he attributes this consecration to a
16282,WORDSWORTH (1875),sunrise seen (during a college vacation) as he walked
16283,WORDSWORTH (1875),homeward from some village festival where he had danced all
16284,WORDSWORTH (1875),night:
16285,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16286,WORDSWORTH (1875),"My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows"
16287,WORDSWORTH (1875),Were then made for me; bond unknown to me
16288,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Was given that I should be, else sinning greatly."

16292,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16293,WORDSWORTH (1875),William Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth in Cumberland on the 7th of
16294,WORDSWORTH (1875),"April, 1770, the second of five children. His father was John"
16295,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth, an attorney-at-law, and agent of Sir James Lowther,"
16296,WORDSWORTH (1875),"afterwards first Earl of Lonsdale. His mother was Anne Cookson, the"
16297,WORDSWORTH (1875),daughter of a mercer in Penrith. His paternal ancestors had been
16298,WORDSWORTH (1875),"settled immemorially at Penistone in Yorkshire, whence his grandfather"
16299,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had emigrated to Westmorland. His mother, a woman of piety and wisdom,"
16300,WORDSWORTH (1875),"died in March 1778, being then in her thirty-second year. His father,"
16301,WORDSWORTH (1875),"who never entirely cast off the depression occasioned by her death,"
16302,WORDSWORTH (1875),"survived her but five years, dying in December 1783, when William was"
16303,WORDSWORTH (1875),not quite fourteen years old.
16304,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16305,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The poet's early childhood was passed partly at Cockermouth, and"
16306,WORDSWORTH (1875),partly with his maternal grandfather at Penrith. His first teacher
16307,WORDSWORTH (1875),"appears to have been Mrs. Anne Birkett, a kind of Shenstone's"
16308,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Schoolmistress, who practised the memory of her pupils, teaching them"
16309,WORDSWORTH (1875),"chiefly by rote, and not endeavouring to cultivate their reasoning"
16310,WORDSWORTH (1875),"faculties, a process by which children are apt to be converted from"
16311,WORDSWORTH (1875),natural logicians into impertinent sophists. Among his schoolmates
16312,WORDSWORTH (1875),"here was Mary Hutchinson, who afterwards became his wife."
16313,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16314,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In 1778 he was sent to a school founded by Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of"
16315,WORDSWORTH (1875),"York, in the year 1585, at Hawkshead in Lancashire. Hawkshead is a"
16316,WORDSWORTH (1875),"small market-town in the vale of Esthwaite, about a third of a mile"
16317,WORDSWORTH (1875),"north-west of the lake. Here Wordsworth passed nine years, among a"
16318,WORDSWORTH (1875),people of simple habits and scenery of a sweet and pastoral dignity.
16319,WORDSWORTH (1875),"His earliest intimacies were with the mountains, lakes, and streams of"
16320,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his native district, and the associations with which his mind was"
16321,WORDSWORTH (1875),stored during its most impressible period were noble and pure. The
16322,WORDSWORTH (1875),"boys were boarded among the dames of the village, thus enjoying a"
16323,WORDSWORTH (1875),"freedom from scholastic restraints, which could be nothing but"
16324,WORDSWORTH (1875),beneficial in a place where the temptations were only to sports that
16325,WORDSWORTH (1875),"hardened the body, while they fostered a love of nature in the spirit"
16326,WORDSWORTH (1875),and habits of observation in the mind. Wordsworth's ordinary
16327,WORDSWORTH (1875),"amusements here were hunting and fishing, rowing, skating, and long"
16328,WORDSWORTH (1875),"walks around the lake and among the hills, with an occasional scamper"
16329,WORDSWORTH (1875),on horseback.[42] His life as a schoolboy was favourable also to his
16330,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poetic development, in being identified with that of the people among"
16331,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whom he lived. Among men of simple habits, and where there are small"
16332,WORDSWORTH (1875),"diversities of condition, the feelings and passions are displayed with"
16333,WORDSWORTH (1875),"less restraint, and the young poet grew acquainted with that primal"
16334,WORDSWORTH (1875),"human basis of character where the Muse finds firm foothold, and to"
16335,WORDSWORTH (1875),which he ever afterward cleared his way through all the overlying
16336,WORDSWORTH (1875),drift of conventionalism. The dalesmen were a primitive and hardy race
16337,WORDSWORTH (1875),who kept alive the traditions and often the habits of a more
16338,WORDSWORTH (1875),picturesque time. A common level of interests and social standing
16339,WORDSWORTH (1875),"fostered unconventional ways of thought and speech, and friendly human"
16340,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sympathies. Solitude induced reflection, a reliance of the mind on its"
16341,WORDSWORTH (1875),"own resources, and individuality of character. Where everybody knew"
16342,WORDSWORTH (1875),"everybody, and everybody's father had known everybody's father, the"
16343,WORDSWORTH (1875),interest of man in man was not likely to become a matter of cold
16344,WORDSWORTH (1875),hearsay and distant report. When death knocked at any door in the
16345,WORDSWORTH (1875),"hamlet, there was an echo from every fireside, and a wedding dropped"
16346,WORDSWORTH (1875),its white flowers at every threshold. There was not a grave in the
16347,WORDSWORTH (1875),churchyard but had its story; not a crag or glen or aged tree
16348,WORDSWORTH (1875),untouched with some ideal hue of legend. It was here that Wordsworth
16349,WORDSWORTH (1875),learned that homely humanity which gives such depth and sincerity to
16350,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his poems. Travel, society, culture, nothing could obliterate the deep"
16351,WORDSWORTH (1875),trace of that early training which enables him to speak directly to
16352,WORDSWORTH (1875),the primitive instincts of man. He was apprenticed early to the
16353,WORDSWORTH (1875),difficult art of being himself.

16359,WORDSWORTH (1875),peculiar merit. But he seems to have made up his mind as early as in
16360,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his fourteenth year to become a poet.[43] 'It is recorded', says his"
16361,WORDSWORTH (1875),"biographer vaguely, 'that the poet's father set him very early to"
16362,WORDSWORTH (1875),"learn portions of the best English poets by heart, so that at an early"
16363,WORDSWORTH (1875),"age he could repeat large portions of Shakespeare, Milton, and"

16372,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16373,WORDSWORTH (1875),The great event of Wordsworth's schooldays was the death of his
16374,WORDSWORTH (1875),"father, who left what may be called a hypothetical estate, consisting"
16375,WORDSWORTH (1875),"chiefly of claims upon the first Earl of Lonsdale, the payment of"
16376,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which, though their justice was acknowledged, that nobleman contrived"
16377,WORDSWORTH (1875),in some unexplained way to elude so long as he lived. In October 1787
16378,WORDSWORTH (1875),"he left school for St. John's College, Cambridge. He was already, we"
16379,WORDSWORTH (1875),"are told, a fair Latin scholar, and had made some progress in"
16380,WORDSWORTH (1875),mathematics. The earliest books we hear of his reading were _Don
16381,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Quixote_, _Gil Blas_, _Gulliver's Travels_, and the _Tale of a Tub_;"
16382,WORDSWORTH (1875),but at school he had also become familiar with the works of some
16383,WORDSWORTH (1875),"English poets, particularly Goldsmith and Gray, of whose poems he had"
16384,WORDSWORTH (1875),"learned many by heart. What is more to the purpose, he had become,"
16385,WORDSWORTH (1875),"without knowing it, a lover of Nature in all her moods, and the same"
16386,WORDSWORTH (1875),mental necessities of a solitary life which compel men to an interest
16387,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in the transitory phenomena of scenery, had made him also studious of"
16388,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the movements of his own mind, and the mutual interaction and"
16389,WORDSWORTH (1875),dependence of the external and internal universe.
16390,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16391,WORDSWORTH (1875),Doubtless his early orphanage was not without its effect in confirming
16392,WORDSWORTH (1875),"a character naturally impatient of control, and his mind, left to"
16393,WORDSWORTH (1875),"itself, clothed itself with an indigenous growth, which grew fairly"
16394,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and freely, unstinted by the shadow of exotic plantations. It has"
16395,WORDSWORTH (1875),"become a truism, that remarkable persons have remarkable mothers; but"
16396,WORDSWORTH (1875),perhaps this is chiefly true of such as have made themselves
16397,WORDSWORTH (1875),"distinguished by their industry, and by the assiduous cultivation of"
16398,WORDSWORTH (1875),faculties in themselves of only an average quality. It is rather to be
16399,WORDSWORTH (1875),noted how little is known of the parentage of men of the first
16400,WORDSWORTH (1875),"magnitude, how often they seem in some sort foundlings, and how early"
16401,WORDSWORTH (1875),an apparently adverse destiny begins the culture of those who are to
16402,WORDSWORTH (1875),encounter and master great intellectual or spiritual experiences.
16403,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16404,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Of his disposition as a child little is known, but that little is"
16405,WORDSWORTH (1875),"characteristic. He himself tells us that he was 'stiff, moody, and of"
16406,WORDSWORTH (1875),violent temper'. His mother said of him that he was the only one of
16407,WORDSWORTH (1875),"her children about whom she felt any anxiety,--for she was sure that"
16408,WORDSWORTH (1875),"he would be remarkable for good or evil. Once, in resentment at some"
16409,WORDSWORTH (1875),"fancied injury, he resolved to kill himself, but his heart failed him."
16410,WORDSWORTH (1875),I suspect that few boys of passionate temperament have escaped these
16411,WORDSWORTH (1875),momentary suggestions of despairing helplessness. 'On another
16412,WORDSWORTH (1875),"occasion,' he says, 'while I was at my grandfather's house at Penrith,"
16413,WORDSWORTH (1875),"along with my eldest brother Richard, we were whipping tops together"
16414,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in the long drawing-room, on which the carpet was only laid down on"
16415,WORDSWORTH (1875),"particular occasions. The walls were hung round with family pictures,"
16416,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and I said to my brother, ""Dare you strike your whip through that old"
16417,WORDSWORTH (1875),"lady's petticoat?"" He replied, ""No, I won't."" ""Then,"" said I, ""here"
16418,WORDSWORTH (1875),"goes,"" and I struck my lash through her hooped petticoat, for which,"
16419,WORDSWORTH (1875),"no doubt, though I have forgotten it, I was properly punished. But,"
16420,WORDSWORTH (1875),"possibly from some want of judgement in punishments inflicted, I had"
16421,WORDSWORTH (1875),"become perverse and obstinate in defying chastisement, and rather"
16422,WORDSWORTH (1875),proud of it than otherwise.' This last anecdote is as happily typical
16423,WORDSWORTH (1875),as a bit of Greek mythology which always prefigured the lives of
16424,WORDSWORTH (1875),heroes in the stories of their childhood. Just so do we find him
16425,WORDSWORTH (1875),afterward striking his defiant lash through the hooped petticoat of
16426,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the artificial style of poetry, and proudly unsubdued by the"
16427,WORDSWORTH (1875),punishment of the Reviewers.
16428,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16429,WORDSWORTH (1875),Of his college life the chief record is to be found in _The Prelude_.
16430,WORDSWORTH (1875),"He did not distinguish himself as a scholar, and if his life had any"
16431,WORDSWORTH (1875),"incidents, they were of that interior kind which rarely appear in"
16432,WORDSWORTH (1875),"biography, though they may be of controlling influence upon the life."
16433,WORDSWORTH (1875),"He speaks of reading Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton while at"
16434,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Cambridge,[44] but no reflection from them is visible in his earliest"
16435,WORDSWORTH (1875),published poems. The greater part of his vacations was spent in his
16436,WORDSWORTH (1875),"native Lake-country, where his only sister, Dorothy, was the companion"
16437,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of his rambles. She was a woman of large natural endowments, chiefly"
16438,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of the receptive kind, and had much to do with the formation and"
16439,WORDSWORTH (1875),tendency of the poet's mind. It was she who called forth the shyer
16440,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sensibilities of his nature, and taught an originally harsh and"
16441,WORDSWORTH (1875),"austere imagination to surround itself with fancy and feeling, as the"
16442,WORDSWORTH (1875),rock fringes itself with a sun-spray of ferns. She was his first
16443,WORDSWORTH (1875),"public, and belonged to that class of prophetically appreciative"
16444,WORDSWORTH (1875),temperaments whose apparent office it is to cheer the early solitude
16445,WORDSWORTH (1875),of original minds with messages from the future. Through the greater
16446,WORDSWORTH (1875),part of his life she continued to be a kind of poetical conscience to
16447,WORDSWORTH (1875),him.

16450,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16451,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth's last college vacation was spent in a foot journey upon
16452,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the Continent (1790). In January 1791 he took his degree of B.A., and"
16453,WORDSWORTH (1875),"left Cambridge. During the summer of this year he visited Wales, and,"
16454,WORDSWORTH (1875),after declining to enter upon holy orders under the plea that he was
16455,WORDSWORTH (1875),"not of age for ordination, went over to France in November, and"
16456,WORDSWORTH (1875),remained during the winter at Orleans. Here he became intimate with
16457,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the republican General Beaupuis, with whose hopes and aspirations he"
16458,WORDSWORTH (1875),"ardently sympathized. In the spring of 1792 he was at Blois, and"
16459,WORDSWORTH (1875),"returned thence to Orleans, which he finally quitted in October for"
16460,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Paris. He remained here as long as he could with safety, and at the"
16461,WORDSWORTH (1875),"close of the year went back to England, thus, perhaps, escaping the"
16462,WORDSWORTH (1875),fate which soon after overtook his friends the Brissotins.
16463,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16464,WORDSWORTH (1875),"As hitherto the life of Wordsworth may be called a fortunate one, not"
16465,WORDSWORTH (1875),less so in the training and expansion of his faculties was this period
16466,WORDSWORTH (1875),of his stay in France. Born and reared in a country where the homely
16467,WORDSWORTH (1875),and familiar nestles confidingly amid the most savage and sublime
16468,WORDSWORTH (1875),"forms of nature, he had experienced whatever impulses the creative"
16469,WORDSWORTH (1875),faculty can receive from mountain and cloud and the voices of winds
16470,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and waters, but he had known man only as an actor in fireside"
16471,WORDSWORTH (1875),"histories and tragedies, for which the hamlet supplied an ample stage."
16472,WORDSWORTH (1875),In France he first felt the authentic beat of a nation's heart; he was
16473,WORDSWORTH (1875),a spectator at one of those dramas where the terrible footfall of the
16474,WORDSWORTH (1875),Eumenides is heard nearer and nearer in the pauses of the action; and
16475,WORDSWORTH (1875),he saw man such as he can only be when he is vibrated by the orgasm of
16476,WORDSWORTH (1875),a national emotion. He sympathized with the hopes of France and of
16477,WORDSWORTH (1875),"mankind deeply, as was fitting in a young man and a poet; and if his"
16478,WORDSWORTH (1875),"faith in the gregarious advancement of men was afterward shaken, he"
16479,WORDSWORTH (1875),"only held the more firmly by his belief in the individual, and his"
16480,WORDSWORTH (1875),reverence for the human as something quite apart from the popular and
16481,WORDSWORTH (1875),"above it. Wordsworth has been unwisely blamed, as if he had been"
16482,WORDSWORTH (1875),recreant to the liberal instincts of his youth. But it was inevitable
16483,WORDSWORTH (1875),"that a genius so regulated and metrical as his, a mind which always"
16484,WORDSWORTH (1875),compensated itself for its artistic radicalism by an involuntary
16485,WORDSWORTH (1875),"leaning toward external respectability, should recoil from whatever"
16486,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was convulsionary and destructive in politics, and above all in"
16487,WORDSWORTH (1875),"religion. He reads the poems of Wordsworth without understanding, who"
16488,WORDSWORTH (1875),does not find in them the noblest incentives to faith in man and the
16489,WORDSWORTH (1875),"grandeur of his destiny, founded always upon that personal dignity and"
16490,WORDSWORTH (1875),"virtue, the capacity for whose attainment alone makes universal"
16491,WORDSWORTH (1875),liberty possible and assures its permanence. He was to make men better
16492,WORDSWORTH (1875),by opening to them the sources of an inalterable well-being; to make
16493,WORDSWORTH (1875),"them free, in a sense higher than political, by showing them that"
16494,WORDSWORTH (1875),"these sources are within them, and that no contrivance of man can"
16495,WORDSWORTH (1875),permanently emancipate narrow natures and depraved minds. His politics
16496,WORDSWORTH (1875),"were always those of a poet, circling in the larger orbit of causes"
16497,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and principles, careless of the transitory oscillation of events."
16498,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16499,WORDSWORTH (1875),The change in his point of view (if change there was) certainly was
16500,WORDSWORTH (1875),"complete soon after his return from France, and was perhaps due in"
16501,WORDSWORTH (1875),part to the influence of Burke.
16502,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16503,WORDSWORTH (1875),"While he [Burke] forewarns, denounces, launches forth,"
16504,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Against all systems built on abstract rights,"
16505,WORDSWORTH (1875),Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims

16511,WORDSWORTH (1875),"... Could a youth, and one"
16512,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved"

16518,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16519,WORDSWORTH (1875),He had seen the French for a dozen years eagerly busy in tearing up
16520,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whatever had roots in the past, replacing the venerable trunks of"
16521,WORDSWORTH (1875),"tradition and orderly growth with liberty-poles, then striving vainly"
16522,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to piece together the fibres they had broken, and to reproduce"
16523,WORDSWORTH (1875),artificially that sense of permanence and continuity which is the main
16524,WORDSWORTH (1875),safeguard of vigorous self-consciousness in a nation. He became a Tory
16525,WORDSWORTH (1875),"through intellectual conviction, retaining, I suspect, to the last, a"
16526,WORDSWORTH (1875),certain radicalism of temperament and instinct. Haydon tells us that
16527,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in 1809 Sir George Beaumont said to him and Wilkie, 'Wordsworth may"
16528,WORDSWORTH (1875),"perhaps walk in; if he do, I caution you both against his terrific"
16529,WORDSWORTH (1875),democratic notions'; and it must have been many years later that
16530,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth himself told Crabb Robinson, 'I have no respect whatever"
16531,WORDSWORTH (1875),"for Whigs, but I have a great deal of the Chartist in me'. In 1802,"
16532,WORDSWORTH (1875),"during his tour in Scotland, he travelled on Sundays as on the other"
16533,WORDSWORTH (1875),days of the week. He afterwards became a theoretical churchgoer.
16534,WORDSWORTH (1875),'Wordsworth defended earnestly the Church establishment. He even said
16535,WORDSWORTH (1875),he would shed his blood for it. Nor was he disconcerted by a laugh
16536,WORDSWORTH (1875),raised against him on account of his having confessed that he knew not
16537,WORDSWORTH (1875),"when he had been in a church in his own country. ""All our ministers"
16538,WORDSWORTH (1875),"are so vile,"" said he. The mischief of allowing the clergy to depend"
16539,WORDSWORTH (1875),on the caprice of the multitude he thought more than outweighed all
16540,WORDSWORTH (1875),the evils of an establishment.'
16541,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16542,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In December 1792 Wordsworth had returned to England, and in the"
16543,WORDSWORTH (1875),following year published _Descriptive Sketches_ and the _Evening
16544,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Walk_. He did this, as he says in one of his letters, to show that,"
16545,WORDSWORTH (1875),"although he had gained no honours at the University, he _could_ do"
16546,WORDSWORTH (1875),"something. They met with no great success, and he afterward corrected"
16547,WORDSWORTH (1875),"them so much as to destroy all their interest as juvenile productions,"
16548,WORDSWORTH (1875),without communicating to them any of the merits of maturity. In
16549,WORDSWORTH (1875),"commenting, sixty years afterward, on a couplet in one of these"
16550,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poems,--"
16551,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16552,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And, fronting the bright west, the oak entwines"
16553,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines,--"
16554,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16555,WORDSWORTH (1875),"he says: 'This is feebly and imperfectly expressed, but I recollect"
16556,WORDSWORTH (1875),distinctly the very spot where this first struck me.... The moment was
16557,WORDSWORTH (1875),important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness
16558,WORDSWORTH (1875),of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been
16559,WORDSWORTH (1875),"unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, so far as I was"
16560,WORDSWORTH (1875),"acquainted with them, and I made a resolution to supply in some degree"
16561,WORDSWORTH (1875),the deficiency.'
16562,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16563,WORDSWORTH (1875),"It is plain that Wordsworth's memory was playing him a trick here,"
16564,WORDSWORTH (1875),misled by that instinct (it may almost be called) of consistency which
16565,WORDSWORTH (1875),leads men first to desire that their lives should have been without
16566,WORDSWORTH (1875),"break or seam, and then to believe that they have been such. The more"
16567,WORDSWORTH (1875),distant ranges of perspective are apt to run together in
16568,WORDSWORTH (1875),retrospection. How far could Wordsworth at fourteen have been
16569,WORDSWORTH (1875),"acquainted with the poets of all ages and countries,--he who to his"
16570,WORDSWORTH (1875),dying day could not endure to read Goethe and knew nothing of
16571,WORDSWORTH (1875),Calderon? It seems to me rather that the earliest influence traceable
16572,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in him is that of Goldsmith, and later of Cowper, and it is, perhaps,"
16573,WORDSWORTH (1875),some slight indication of its having already begun that his first
16574,WORDSWORTH (1875),"volume of _Descriptive Sketches_ (1793) was put forth by Johnson, who"
16575,WORDSWORTH (1875),was Cowper's publisher. By and by the powerful impress of Burns is
16576,WORDSWORTH (1875),seen both in the topics of his verse and the form of his expression.
16577,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But whatever their ultimate effect upon his style, certain it is that"
16578,WORDSWORTH (1875),his juvenile poems were clothed in the conventional habit of the
16579,WORDSWORTH (1875),eighteenth century. 'The first verses from which he remembered to have
16580,WORDSWORTH (1875),"received great pleasure were Miss Carter's _Poem on Spring_, a poem in"
16581,WORDSWORTH (1875),the six-line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed
16582,WORDSWORTH (1875),"much in,--for example, _Ruth_.' This is noteworthy, for Wordsworth's"
16583,WORDSWORTH (1875),"lyric range, especially so far as tune is concerned, was always"
16584,WORDSWORTH (1875),"narrow. His sense of melody was painfully dull, and some of his"
16585,WORDSWORTH (1875),"lighter effusions, as he would have called them, are almost"
16586,WORDSWORTH (1875),ludicrously wanting in grace of movement. We cannot expect in a modern
16587,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poet the thrush-like improvisation, the impulsively bewitching"
16588,WORDSWORTH (1875),"cadences, that charm us in our Elizabethan drama and whose last"
16589,WORDSWORTH (1875),"warble died with Herrick; but Shelley, Tennyson, and Browning have"
16590,WORDSWORTH (1875),"shown that the simple pathos of their music was not irrecoverable,"
16591,WORDSWORTH (1875),even if the artless poignancy of their phrase be gone beyond recall.
16592,WORDSWORTH (1875),We feel this lack in Wordsworth all the more keenly if we compare such
16593,WORDSWORTH (1875),verses as
16594,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16595,WORDSWORTH (1875),Like an army defeated
16596,WORDSWORTH (1875),The snow hath retreated
16597,WORDSWORTH (1875),And now doth fare ill
16598,WORDSWORTH (1875),"On the top of the bare hill,"
16599,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16600,WORDSWORTH (1875),"with Goethe's exquisite _Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh_, in which the"
16601,WORDSWORTH (1875),lines (as if shaken down by a momentary breeze of emotion) drop
16602,WORDSWORTH (1875),lingeringly one after another like blossoms upon turf.
16603,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16604,WORDSWORTH (1875),_The Evening Walk_ and _Descriptive Sketches_ show plainly the
16605,WORDSWORTH (1875),"prevailing influence of Goldsmith, both in the turn of thought and the"
16606,WORDSWORTH (1875),mechanism of the verse. They lack altogether the temperance of tone
16607,WORDSWORTH (1875),and judgement in selection which have made the _Traveller_ and the
16608,WORDSWORTH (1875),_Deserted Village_ perhaps the most truly classical poems in the
16609,WORDSWORTH (1875),"language. They bear here and there, however, the unmistakable stamp of"
16610,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the maturer Wordsworth, not only in a certain blunt realism, but in"
16611,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the intensity and truth of picturesque epithet. Of this realism, from"
16612,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which Wordsworth never wholly freed himself, the following verses may"
16613,WORDSWORTH (1875),suffice as a specimen. After describing the fate of a chamois-hunter
16614,WORDSWORTH (1875),"killed by falling from a crag, his fancy goes back to the bereaved"
16615,WORDSWORTH (1875),wife and son:
16616,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16617,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze,"
16618,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Passing his father's bones in future days,"
16619,WORDSWORTH (1875),Start at the reliques of that very thigh
16620,WORDSWORTH (1875),On which so oft he prattled when a boy.
16621,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16622,WORDSWORTH (1875),In these poems there is plenty of that 'poetic diction' against which
16623,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth was to lead the revolt nine years later.
16624,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16625,WORDSWORTH (1875),To wet the peak's impracticable sides
16626,WORDSWORTH (1875),"He opens of his feet the sanguine tides,"
16627,WORDSWORTH (1875),Weak and more weak the issuing current eyes
16628,WORDSWORTH (1875),Lapped by the panting tongue of thirsty skies.
16629,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16630,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Both of these passages have disappeared from the revised edition, as"
16631,WORDSWORTH (1875),well as some curious outbursts of that motiveless despair which Byron
16632,WORDSWORTH (1875),made fashionable not long after. Nor are there wanting touches of
16633,WORDSWORTH (1875),fleshliness which strike us oddly as coming from Wordsworth.
16634,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16635,WORDSWORTH (1875),Farewell! those forms that in thy noontide shade
16636,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Rest near their little plots of oaten glade,"
16637,WORDSWORTH (1875),Those steadfast eyes that beating breasts inspire
16638,WORDSWORTH (1875),To throw the 'sultry ray' of young Desire;
16639,WORDSWORTH (1875),Those lips whose tides of fragrance come and go
16640,WORDSWORTH (1875),Accordant to the cheek's unquiet glow;
16641,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Those shadowy breasts in love's soft light arrayed,"
16642,WORDSWORTH (1875),And rising by the moon of passion swayed.
16643,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16644,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The political tone is also mildened in the revision, as where he"
16645,WORDSWORTH (1875),changes 'despotcourts' into 'tyranny'. One of the alterations is
16646,WORDSWORTH (1875),interesting. In the _Evening Walk_ he had originally written
16647,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16648,WORDSWORTH (1875),And bids her soldier come her wars to share
16649,WORDSWORTH (1875),Asleep on Minden's charnel hill afar.
16650,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16651,WORDSWORTH (1875),"An erratum at the end directs us to correct the second verse, thus:"
16652,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16653,WORDSWORTH (1875),Asleep on Bunker's charnel hill afar.
16654,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16655,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth somewhere rebukes the poets for making the owl a bodeful
16656,WORDSWORTH (1875),"bird. He had himself done so in the _Evening Walk_, and corrects his"
16657,WORDSWORTH (1875),"epithets to suit his later judgement, putting 'gladsome' for 'boding',"
16658,WORDSWORTH (1875),and replacing
16659,WORDSWORTH (1875),

16661,WORDSWORTH (1875),

16666,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Indeed, the character of the two poems is so much changed in the"
16667,WORDSWORTH (1875),revision as to make the dates appended to them a misleading
16668,WORDSWORTH (1875),anachronism. But there is one truly Wordsworthian passage which
16669,WORDSWORTH (1875),already gives us a glimpse of that passion with which he was the first
16670,WORDSWORTH (1875),to irradiate descriptive poetry and which sets him on a level with
16671,WORDSWORTH (1875),Turner.
16672,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16673,WORDSWORTH (1875),'Tis storm; and hid in mist from hour to hour
16674,WORDSWORTH (1875),All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:
16675,WORDSWORTH (1875),The sky is veiled and every cheerful sight;
16676,WORDSWORTH (1875),Dark is the region as with coming night;
16677,WORDSWORTH (1875),But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!
16678,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,"

16680,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Eastward, in long prospective glittering shine"
16681,WORDSWORTH (1875),The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;
16682,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Those eastern cliffs a hundred streams unfold,"
16683,WORDSWORTH (1875),At once to pillars turned that flame with gold;
16684,WORDSWORTH (1875),Behind his sail the peasant tries to shun
16685,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The West that burns like one dilated sun,"
16686,WORDSWORTH (1875),Where in a mighty crucible expire
16687,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The mountains, glowing hot like coals of fire."
16688,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16689,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth has made only one change in these verses, and that for the"
16690,WORDSWORTH (1875),"worse, by substituting 'glorious' (which was already implied in"
16691,WORDSWORTH (1875),'glances' and 'fire-clad') for 'wheeling'. In later life he would have
16692,WORDSWORTH (1875),found it hard to forgive the man who should have made cliffs recline
16693,WORDSWORTH (1875),"over a lake. On the whole, what strikes us as most prophetic in these"
16694,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poems is their want of continuity, and the purple patches of true"
16695,WORDSWORTH (1875),poetry on a texture of unmistakable prose; perhaps we might add the
16696,WORDSWORTH (1875),incongruous clothing of prose thoughts in the ceremonial robes of
16697,WORDSWORTH (1875),poesy.
16698,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16699,WORDSWORTH (1875),"During the same year (1793) he wrote, but did not publish, a political"
16700,WORDSWORTH (1875),"tract, in which he avowed himself opposed to monarchy and to the"
16701,WORDSWORTH (1875),"hereditary principle, and desirous of a republic, if it could be had"
16702,WORDSWORTH (1875),without a revolution. He probably continued to be all his life in
16703,WORDSWORTH (1875),"favour of that ideal republic 'which never was on land or sea', but"
16704,WORDSWORTH (1875),fortunately he gave up politics that he might devote himself to his
16705,WORDSWORTH (1875),"own nobler calling, to which politics are subordinate, and for which"
16706,WORDSWORTH (1875),he found freedom enough in England as it was. Dr. Wordsworth admits
16707,WORDSWORTH (1875),that his uncle's opinions were democratical so late as 1802. I suspect
16708,WORDSWORTH (1875),that they remained so in an esoteric way to the end of his days. He
16709,WORDSWORTH (1875),had himself suffered by the arbitrary selfishness of a great
16710,WORDSWORTH (1875),"landholder, and he was born and bred in a part of England where there"
16711,WORDSWORTH (1875),is a greater social equality than elsewhere. The look and manner of
16712,WORDSWORTH (1875),the Cumberland people especially are such as recall very vividly to a
16713,WORDSWORTH (1875),"New-Englander the associations of fifty years ago, ere the change from"
16714,WORDSWORTH (1875),"New England to New Ireland had begun. But meanwhile, Want, which makes"
16715,WORDSWORTH (1875),"no distinctions of Monarchist or Republican, was pressing upon him."
16716,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The debt due to his father's estate had not been paid, and Wordsworth"
16717,WORDSWORTH (1875),was one of those rare idealists who esteem it the first duty of a
16718,WORDSWORTH (1875),"friend of humanity to live for, and not on, his neighbour. He at first"
16719,WORDSWORTH (1875),proposed establishing a periodical journal to be called _The
16720,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Philanthropist_, but luckily went no further with it, for the receipts"
16721,WORDSWORTH (1875),"from an organ of opinion which professed republicanism, and at the"
16722,WORDSWORTH (1875),same time discountenanced the plans of all existing or defunct
16723,WORDSWORTH (1875),"republicans, would have been necessarily scanty. There being no"
16724,WORDSWORTH (1875),"appearance of any demand, present or prospective, for philanthropists,"
16725,WORDSWORTH (1875),he tried to get employment as correspondent of a newspaper. Here also
16726,WORDSWORTH (1875),it was impossible that he should succeed; he was too great to be
16727,WORDSWORTH (1875),"merged in the editorial We, and had too well defined a private opinion"
16728,WORDSWORTH (1875),on all subjects to be able to express that average of public opinion
16729,WORDSWORTH (1875),which constitutes able editorials. But so it is that to the prophet in
16730,WORDSWORTH (1875),the wilderness the birds of ill omen are already on the wing with food
16731,WORDSWORTH (1875),from heaven; and while Wordsworth's relatives were getting impatient
16732,WORDSWORTH (1875),"at what they considered his waste of time, while one thought he had"
16733,WORDSWORTH (1875),"gifts enough to make a good parson, and another lamented the rare"
16734,WORDSWORTH (1875),"attorney that was lost in him, the prescient muse guided the hand of"
16735,WORDSWORTH (1875),Raisley Calvert while he wrote the poet's name in his will for a
16736,WORDSWORTH (1875),"legacy of £900. By the death of Calvert, in 1795, this timely help"
16737,WORDSWORTH (1875),"came to Wordsworth at the turning-point of his life, and made it"
16738,WORDSWORTH (1875),"honest for him to write poems that will never die, instead of"
16739,WORDSWORTH (1875),"theatrical critiques as ephemeral as play-bills, or leaders that led"
16740,WORDSWORTH (1875),only to oblivion.
16741,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16742,WORDSWORTH (1875),In the autumn of 1795 Wordsworth and his sister took up their abode at
16743,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Racedown Lodge, near Crewkerne, in Dorsetshire. Here nearly two years"
16744,WORDSWORTH (1875),"were passed, chiefly in the study of poetry, and Wordsworth to some"
16745,WORDSWORTH (1875),extent recovered from the fierce disappointment of his political
16746,WORDSWORTH (1875),"dreams, and regained that equable tenor of mind which alone is"
16747,WORDSWORTH (1875),"consistent with a healthy productiveness. Here Coleridge, who had"
16748,WORDSWORTH (1875),contrived to see something more in the _Descriptive Sketches_ than
16749,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the public had discovered there, first made his acquaintance. The"
16750,WORDSWORTH (1875),sympathy and appreciation of an intellect like Coleridge's supplied
16751,WORDSWORTH (1875),him with that external motive to activity which is the chief use of
16752,WORDSWORTH (1875),"popularity, and justified to him his opinion of his own powers. It was"
16753,WORDSWORTH (1875),"now that the tragedy of _The Borderers_ was for the most part written,"
16754,WORDSWORTH (1875),and that plan of the _Lyrical Ballads_ suggested which gave Wordsworth
16755,WORDSWORTH (1875),a clue to lead him out of the metaphysical labyrinth in which he was
16756,WORDSWORTH (1875),"entangled. It was agreed between the two young friends, that"
16757,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth was to be a philosophic poet, and, by a good fortune"
16758,WORDSWORTH (1875),"uncommon to such conspiracies, Nature had already consented to the"
16759,WORDSWORTH (1875),"arrangement. In July 1797, the two Wordsworths removed to Allfoxden in"
16760,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Somersetshire, that they might be near Coleridge, who in the meanwhile"
16761,WORDSWORTH (1875),had married and settled himself at Nether Stowey. In November _The
16762,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Borderers_ was finished, and Wordsworth went up to London with his"
16763,WORDSWORTH (1875),sister to offer it for the stage. The good Genius of the poet again
16764,WORDSWORTH (1875),"interposing, the play was decisively rejected, and Wordsworth went"
16765,WORDSWORTH (1875),"back to Allfoxden, himself the hero of that first tragi-comedy so"
16766,WORDSWORTH (1875),common to young authors.
16767,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16768,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The play has fine passages, but is as unreal as _Jane Eyre_. It shares"
16769,WORDSWORTH (1875),with many of Wordsworth's narrative poems the defect of being written
16770,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to illustrate an abstract moral theory, so that the overbearing thesis"
16771,WORDSWORTH (1875),"is continually thrusting the poetry to the wall. Applied to the drama,"
16772,WORDSWORTH (1875),such predestination makes all the personages puppets and disenables
16773,WORDSWORTH (1875),them for being characters. Wordsworth seems to have felt this when he
16774,WORDSWORTH (1875),"published _The Borderers_ in 1842, and says in a note that it was 'at"
16775,WORDSWORTH (1875),first written ... without any view to its exhibition upon the stage'.
16776,WORDSWORTH (1875),But he was mistaken. The contemporaneous letters of Coleridge to
16777,WORDSWORTH (1875),Cottle show that he was long in giving up the hope of getting it
16778,WORDSWORTH (1875),accepted by some theatrical manager.
16779,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16780,WORDSWORTH (1875),He now applied himself to the preparation of the first volume of the
16781,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Lyrical Ballads_ for the press, and it was published toward the close"
16782,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of 1798. The book, which contained also _The Ancient Mariner_ of"
16783,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Coleridge, attracted little notice, and that in great part"
16784,WORDSWORTH (1875),"contemptuous. When Mr. Cottle, the publisher, shortly after sold his"
16785,WORDSWORTH (1875),"copyrights to Mr. Longman, that of the _Lyrical Ballads_ was reckoned"
16786,WORDSWORTH (1875),"at _zero_, and it was at last given up to the authors. A few persons"
16787,WORDSWORTH (1875),"were not wanting, however, who discovered the dawn-streaks of a new"
16788,WORDSWORTH (1875),day in that light which the critical fire-brigade thought to
16789,WORDSWORTH (1875),extinguish with a few contemptuous spurts of cold water.
16790,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16791,WORDSWORTH (1875),Lord Byron describes himself as waking one morning and finding himself
16792,WORDSWORTH (1875),"famous, and it is quite an ordinary fact, that a blaze may be made"
16793,WORDSWORTH (1875),with a little saltpetre that will be stared at by thousands who would
16794,WORDSWORTH (1875),"have thought the sunrise tedious. If we may believe his biographer,"
16795,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth might have said that he awoke and found himself infamous,"
16796,WORDSWORTH (1875),for the publication of the _Lyrical Ballads_ undoubtedly raised him to
16797,WORDSWORTH (1875),the distinction of being the least popular poet in England. Parnassus
16798,WORDSWORTH (1875),has two peaks; the one where improvising poets cluster; the other
16799,WORDSWORTH (1875),"where the singer of deep secrets sits alone,--a peak veiled sometimes"
16800,WORDSWORTH (1875),from the whole morning of a generation by earth-born mists and smoke
16801,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of kitchen fires, only to glow the more consciously at sunset, and"
16802,WORDSWORTH (1875),after nightfall to crown itself with imperishable stars. Wordsworth
16803,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had that self-trust which in the man of genius is sublime, and in the"
16804,WORDSWORTH (1875),man of talent insufferable. It mattered not to him though all the
16805,WORDSWORTH (1875),reviewers had been in a chorus of laughter or conspiracy of silence
16806,WORDSWORTH (1875),behind him. He went quietly over to Germany to write more Lyrical
16807,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Ballads, and to begin a poem on the growth of his own mind, at a time"
16808,WORDSWORTH (1875),when there were only two men in the world (himself and Coleridge) who
16809,WORDSWORTH (1875),"were aware that he had one, or at least one anywise differing from"
16810,WORDSWORTH (1875),"those mechanically uniform ones which are stuck drearily, side by"
16811,WORDSWORTH (1875),"side, in the great pin-paper of society."
16812,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16813,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In Germany Wordsworth dined in company with Klopstock, and after"
16814,WORDSWORTH (1875),"dinner they had a conversation, of which Wordsworth took notes. The"
16815,WORDSWORTH (1875),"respectable old poet, who was passing the evening of his days by the"
16816,WORDSWORTH (1875),"chimney-corner, Darby and Joan like, with his respectable Muse, seems"
16817,WORDSWORTH (1875),to have been rather bewildered by the apparition of a living genius.
16818,WORDSWORTH (1875),The record is of value now chiefly for the insight it gives us into
16819,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth's mind. Among other things he said, 'that it was the"
16820,WORDSWORTH (1875),"province of a great poet to raise people up to his own level, not to"
16821,WORDSWORTH (1875),"descend to theirs',--memorable words, the more memorable that a"
16822,WORDSWORTH (1875),literary life of sixty years was in keeping with them.
16823,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16824,WORDSWORTH (1875),It would be instructive to know what were Wordsworth's studies during
16825,WORDSWORTH (1875),his winter in Goslar. De Quincey's statement is mere conjecture. It
16826,WORDSWORTH (1875),may be guessed fairly enough that he would seek an entrance to the
16827,WORDSWORTH (1875),"German language by the easy path of the ballad, a course likely to"
16828,WORDSWORTH (1875),confirm him in his theories as to the language of poetry. The
16829,WORDSWORTH (1875),Spinozism with which he has been not unjustly charged was certainly
16830,WORDSWORTH (1875),"not due to any German influence, for it appears unmistakably in the"
16831,WORDSWORTH (1875),_Lines composed at Tintern Abbey_ in July 1798. It is more likely to
16832,WORDSWORTH (1875),have been derived from his talks with Coleridge in 1797. When Emerson
16833,WORDSWORTH (1875),"visited him in 1833, he spoke with loathing of _Wilhelm Meister_, a"
16834,WORDSWORTH (1875),part of which he had read in Carlyle's translation apparently. There
16835,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was some affectation in this, it should seem, for he had read"
16836,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Smollett. On the whole, it may be fairly concluded that the help of"
16837,WORDSWORTH (1875),Germany in the development of his genius may be reckoned as very
16838,WORDSWORTH (1875),"small, though there is certainly a marked resemblance both in form and"
16839,WORDSWORTH (1875),sentiment between some of his earlier lyrics and those of Goethe. His
16840,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poem of the _Thorn_, though vastly more imaginative, may have been"
16841,WORDSWORTH (1875),suggested by Bürger's _Pfarrer's Tochter von Taubenhain_. The little
16842,WORDSWORTH (1875),"grave _drei Spannen lang_, in its conscientious measurement, certainly"
16843,WORDSWORTH (1875),recalls a famous couplet in the English poem.
16844,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16845,WORDSWORTH (1875),"After spending the winter at Goslar, Wordsworth and his sister"
16846,WORDSWORTH (1875),"returned to England in the spring of 1799, and settled at Grasmere in"
16847,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Westmorland. In 1800, the first edition of the _Lyrical Ballads_ being"
16848,WORDSWORTH (1875),"exhausted, it was republished with the addition of another volume, Mr."
16849,WORDSWORTH (1875),Longman paying £100 for the copyright of two editions. The book passed
16850,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to a second edition in 1802, and to a third in 1805. Wordsworth sent a"
16851,WORDSWORTH (1875),"copy of it, with a manly letter, to Mr. Fox, particularly recommending"
16852,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to his attention the poems _Michael_ and _The Brothers_, as displaying"
16853,WORDSWORTH (1875),the strength and permanence among a simple and rural population of
16854,WORDSWORTH (1875),those domestic affections which were certain to decay gradually under
16855,WORDSWORTH (1875),the influence of manufactories and poor-houses. Mr. Fox wrote a civil
16856,WORDSWORTH (1875),"acknowledgement, saying that his favourites among the poems were"
16857,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Harry Gill_, _We are Seven_, _The Mad Mother_, and _The Idiot_, but"
16858,WORDSWORTH (1875),that he was prepossessed against the use of blank verse for simple
16859,WORDSWORTH (1875),subjects. Any political significance in the poems he was apparently
16860,WORDSWORTH (1875),unable to see. To this second edition Wordsworth prefixed an
16861,WORDSWORTH (1875),"argumentative Preface, in which he nailed to the door of the cathedral"
16862,WORDSWORTH (1875),of English song the critical theses which he was to maintain against
16863,WORDSWORTH (1875),all comers in his poetry and his life. It was a new thing for an
16864,WORDSWORTH (1875),author to undertake to show the goodness of his verses by the logic
16865,WORDSWORTH (1875),and learning of his prose; but Wordsworth carried to the reform of
16866,WORDSWORTH (1875),poetry all that fervour and faith which had lost their political
16867,WORDSWORTH (1875),"object, and it is another proof of the sincerity and greatness of his"
16868,WORDSWORTH (1875),"mind, and of that heroic simplicity which is their concomitant, that"
16869,WORDSWORTH (1875),he could do so calmly what was sure to seem ludicrous to the greater
16870,WORDSWORTH (1875),number of his readers. Fifty years have since demonstrated that the
16871,WORDSWORTH (1875),true judgement of one man outweighs any counterpoise of false
16872,WORDSWORTH (1875),"judgement, and that the faith of mankind is guided to a man only by a"
16873,WORDSWORTH (1875),well-founded faith in himself. To this _Defensio_ Wordsworth afterward
16874,WORDSWORTH (1875),"added a supplement, and the two form a treatise of permanent value for"
16875,WORDSWORTH (1875),philosophic statement and decorous English. Their only ill effect has
16876,WORDSWORTH (1875),"been, that they have encouraged many otherwise deserving young men to"
16877,WORDSWORTH (1875),set a Sibylline value on their verses in proportion as they were
16878,WORDSWORTH (1875),unsaleable. The strength of an argument for self-reliance drawn from
16879,WORDSWORTH (1875),the example of a great man depends wholly on the greatness of him who
16880,WORDSWORTH (1875),"uses it; such arguments being like coats of mail, which, though they"
16881,WORDSWORTH (1875),"serve the strong against arrow-flights and lance-thrusts, may only"
16882,WORDSWORTH (1875),suffocate the weak or sink him the sooner in the waters of oblivion.
16883,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16884,WORDSWORTH (1875),"An advertisement prefixed to the _Lyrical Ballads_, as originally"
16885,WORDSWORTH (1875),"published in one volume, warned the reader that 'they were written"
16886,WORDSWORTH (1875),chiefly with a view to ascertain how far _the language of conversation
16887,WORDSWORTH (1875),in the middle and lower classes_ of society is adapted to the purposes
16888,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of poetic pleasure'. In his preface to the second edition, in two"
16889,WORDSWORTH (1875),"volumes, Wordsworth already found himself forced to shift his ground a"
16890,WORDSWORTH (1875),little (perhaps in deference to the wider view and finer sense of
16891,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Coleridge), and now says of the former volume that 'it was published"
16892,WORDSWORTH (1875),"as an experiment which, I hoped, might be of some use to ascertain how"
16893,WORDSWORTH (1875),"far, by fitting to metrical arrangement, _a selection of the real"
16894,WORDSWORTH (1875),"language of men in a state of vivid sensation_, that sort of pleasure"
16895,WORDSWORTH (1875),and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted which a poet may
16896,WORDSWORTH (1875),_rationally endeavour_ to impart'. Here is evidence of a retreat
16897,WORDSWORTH (1875),"towards a safer position, though Wordsworth seems to have remained"
16898,WORDSWORTH (1875),"unconvinced at heart, and for many years longer clung obstinately to"
16899,WORDSWORTH (1875),the passages of bald prose into which his original theory had betrayed
16900,WORDSWORTH (1875),"him. In 1815 his opinions had undergone a still further change, and an"
16901,WORDSWORTH (1875),assiduous study of the qualities of his own mind and of his own poetic
16902,WORDSWORTH (1875),method (the two subjects in which alone he was ever a thorough
16903,WORDSWORTH (1875),scholar) had convinced him that poetry was in no sense that appeal to
16904,WORDSWORTH (1875),the understanding which is implied by the words 'rationally endeavour
16905,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to impart'. In the preface of that year he says, 'The observations"
16906,WORDSWORTH (1875),prefixed to that portion of these volumes which was published many
16907,WORDSWORTH (1875),years ago under the title of _Lyrical Ballads_ have so little of
16908,WORDSWORTH (1875),special application to the greater part of the present enlarged and
16909,WORDSWORTH (1875),"diversified collection, that they could not with propriety stand as an"
16910,WORDSWORTH (1875),introduction to it.' It is a pity that he could not have become an
16911,WORDSWORTH (1875),"earlier convert to Coleridge's pithy definition, that 'prose was words"
16912,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in their best order, and poetry the _best_ words in the best order'."
16913,WORDSWORTH (1875),But idealization was something that Wordsworth was obliged to learn
16914,WORDSWORTH (1875),painfully. It did not come to him naturally as to Spenser and Shelley
16915,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and to Coleridge in his higher moods. Moreover, it was in the too"
16916,WORDSWORTH (1875),frequent choice of subjects incapable of being idealized without a
16917,WORDSWORTH (1875),manifest jar between theme and treatment that Wordsworth's great
16918,WORDSWORTH (1875),"mistake lay. For example, in _The Blind Highland Boy_ he had"
16919,WORDSWORTH (1875),originally the following stanzas:
16920,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16921,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Strong is the current, but be mild,"
16922,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Ye waves, and spare the helpless child!"
16923,WORDSWORTH (1875),"If ye in anger fret or chafe,"
16924,WORDSWORTH (1875),A bee-hive would be ship as safe
16925,WORDSWORTH (1875),As that in which he sails.
16926,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16927,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But say, what was it? Thought of fear!"
16928,WORDSWORTH (1875),Well may ye tremble when ye hear!
16929,WORDSWORTH (1875),--A household tub like one of those
16930,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Which women use to wash their clothes,"
16931,WORDSWORTH (1875),This carried the blind boy.
16932,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16933,WORDSWORTH (1875),In endeavouring to get rid of the downright vulgarity of phrase in the
16934,WORDSWORTH (1875),"last stanza, Wordsworth invents an impossible tortoise-shell, and thus"
16935,WORDSWORTH (1875),robs his story of the reality which alone gave it a living interest.
16936,WORDSWORTH (1875),Any extemporized raft would have floated the boy down to immortality.
16937,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But Wordsworth never quite learned the distinction between Fact, which"
16938,WORDSWORTH (1875),"suffocates the Muse, and Truth, which is the very breath of her"
16939,WORDSWORTH (1875),"nostrils. Study and self-culture did much for him, but they never"
16940,WORDSWORTH (1875),quite satisfied him that he was capable of making a mistake. He
16941,WORDSWORTH (1875),"yielded silently to friendly remonstrance on certain points, and gave"
16942,WORDSWORTH (1875),"up, for example, the ludicrous exactness of"
16943,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16944,WORDSWORTH (1875),"I've measured it from side to side,"
16945,WORDSWORTH (1875),'Tis three feet long and two feet wide.
16946,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16947,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But I doubt if he was ever really convinced, and to his dying day he"
16948,WORDSWORTH (1875),could never quite shake off that habit of over-minute detail which
16949,WORDSWORTH (1875),"renders the narratives of uncultivated people so tedious, and"
16950,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sometimes so distasteful. _Simon Lee_, after his latest revision,"
16951,WORDSWORTH (1875),still contains verses like these:
16952,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16953,WORDSWORTH (1875),And he is lean and he is sick;
16954,WORDSWORTH (1875),"His body, dwindled and awry,"
16955,WORDSWORTH (1875),Rests upon ankles swollen and thick;
16956,WORDSWORTH (1875),His legs are thin and dry;
16957,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16958,WORDSWORTH (1875),*       *       *       *       *
16959,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16960,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Few months of life he has in store,"
16961,WORDSWORTH (1875),"As he to you will tell,"
16962,WORDSWORTH (1875),"For still, the more he works, the more"
16963,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Do his weak ankles swell,--"
16964,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16965,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which are not only prose, but _bad_ prose, and moreover guilty of the"
16966,WORDSWORTH (1875),same fault for which Wordsworth condemned Dr. Johnson's famous parody
16967,WORDSWORTH (1875),"on the ballad-style,--that their '_matter_ is contemptible'. The"
16968,WORDSWORTH (1875),sonorousness of conviction with which Wordsworth sometimes gives
16969,WORDSWORTH (1875),utterance to commonplaces of thought and trivialities of sentiment has
16970,WORDSWORTH (1875),a ludicrous effect on the profane and even on the faithful in
16971,WORDSWORTH (1875),unguarded moments. We are reminded of a passage in _The Excursion_:
16972,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16973,WORDSWORTH (1875),List! I heard
16974,WORDSWORTH (1875),"From yon huge breast of rock _a solemn bleat_,"
16975,WORDSWORTH (1875),_Sent forth as if it were the mountain's voice_.
16976,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16977,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In 1800 the friendship of Wordsworth with Lamb began, and was"
16978,WORDSWORTH (1875),"thenceforward never interrupted. He continued to live at Grasmere,"
16979,WORDSWORTH (1875),"conscientiously diligent in the composition of poems, secure of"
16980,WORDSWORTH (1875),finding the materials of glory within and around him; for his genius
16981,WORDSWORTH (1875),"taught him that inspiration is no product of a foreign shore, and that"
16982,WORDSWORTH (1875),"no adventurer ever found it, though he wandered as long as Ulysses."
16983,WORDSWORTH (1875),Meanwhile the appreciation of the best minds and the gratitude of the
16984,WORDSWORTH (1875),purest hearts gradually centred more and more towards him. In 1802 he
16985,WORDSWORTH (1875),"made a short visit to France, in company with Miss Wordsworth, and"
16986,WORDSWORTH (1875),"soon after his return to England was married to Mary Hutchinson, on"
16987,WORDSWORTH (1875),the 4th of October of the same year. Of the good fortune of this
16988,WORDSWORTH (1875),marriage no other proof is needed than the purity and serenity of his
16989,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poems, and its record is to be sought nowhere else."
16990,WORDSWORTH (1875),
16991,WORDSWORTH (1875),"On the 18th of June, 1803, his first child, John, was born, and on the"
16992,WORDSWORTH (1875),14th of August of the same year he set out with his sister on a foot
16993,WORDSWORTH (1875),journey into Scotland. Coleridge was their companion during a part of
16994,WORDSWORTH (1875),"this excursion, of which Miss Wordsworth kept a full diary. In"
16995,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Scotland he made the acquaintance of Scott, who recited to him a part"
16996,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_, then in manuscript. The travellers"
16997,WORDSWORTH (1875),returned to Grasmere on the 25th of September. It was during this
16998,WORDSWORTH (1875),year that Wordsworth's intimacy with the excellent Sir George
16999,WORDSWORTH (1875),Beaumont began. Sir George was an amateur painter of considerable
17000,WORDSWORTH (1875),"merit, and his friendship was undoubtedly of service to Wordsworth in"
17001,WORDSWORTH (1875),making him familiar with the laws of a sister art and thus
17002,WORDSWORTH (1875),"contributing to enlarge the sympathies of his criticism, the tendency"
17003,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of which was toward too great exclusiveness. Sir George Beaumont,"
17004,WORDSWORTH (1875),"dying in 1827, did not forgo his regard for the poet, but contrived to"
17005,WORDSWORTH (1875),"hold his affection in mortmain by the legacy of an annuity of £100, to"
17006,WORDSWORTH (1875),defray the charges of a yearly journey.
17007,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17008,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In March 1805, the poet's brother, John, lost his life by the"
17009,WORDSWORTH (1875),"shipwreck of the _Abergavenny_ East-Indiaman, of which he was captain."
17010,WORDSWORTH (1875),"He was a man of great purity and integrity, and sacrificed himself to"
17011,WORDSWORTH (1875),his sense of duty by refusing to leave the ship till it was impossible
17012,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to save him. Wordsworth was deeply attached to him, and felt such"
17013,WORDSWORTH (1875),"grief at his death as only solitary natures like his are capable of,"
17014,WORDSWORTH (1875),though mitigated by a sense of the heroism which was the cause of it.
17015,WORDSWORTH (1875),The need of mental activity as affording an outlet to intense emotion
17016,WORDSWORTH (1875),may account for the great productiveness of this and the following
17017,WORDSWORTH (1875),"year. He now completed _The Prelude_, wrote _The Waggoner_, and"
17018,WORDSWORTH (1875),"increased the number of his smaller poems enough to fill two volumes,"
17019,WORDSWORTH (1875),which were published in 1807.
17020,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17021,WORDSWORTH (1875),"This collection, which contained some of the most beautiful of his"
17022,WORDSWORTH (1875),"shorter pieces, and among others the incomparable _Odes_ to Duty and"
17023,WORDSWORTH (1875),"on Immortality, did not reach a second edition till 1815. The"
17024,WORDSWORTH (1875),"reviewers had another laugh, and rival poets pillaged while they"
17025,WORDSWORTH (1875),"scoffed, particularly Byron, among whose verses a bit of Wordsworth"
17026,WORDSWORTH (1875),showed as incongruously as a sacred vestment on the back of some
17027,WORDSWORTH (1875),buccaneering plunderer of an abbey. There was a general combination to
17028,WORDSWORTH (1875),"put him down, but on the other hand there was a powerful party in his"
17029,WORDSWORTH (1875),"favour, consisting of William Wordsworth. He not only continued in"
17030,WORDSWORTH (1875),"good heart himself, but, reversing the order usual on such occasions,"
17031,WORDSWORTH (1875),kept up the spirits of his friends.
17032,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17033,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth passed the winter of 1806-7 in a house of Sir George
17034,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Beaumont's, at Coleorton in Leicestershire, the cottage at Grasmere"
17035,WORDSWORTH (1875),having become too small for his increased family. On his return to the
17036,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Vale of Grasmere he rented the house at Allan Bank, where he lived"
17037,WORDSWORTH (1875),three years. During this period he appears to have written very little
17038,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poetry, for which his biographer assigns as a primary reason the"
17039,WORDSWORTH (1875),smokiness of the Allan Bank chimneys. This will hardly account for the
17040,WORDSWORTH (1875),"failure of the summer crop, especially as Wordsworth composed chiefly"
17041,WORDSWORTH (1875),in the open air. It did not prevent him from writing a pamphlet upon
17042,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the Convention of Cintra, which was published too late to attract much"
17043,WORDSWORTH (1875),"attention, though Lamb says that its effect upon him was like that"
17044,WORDSWORTH (1875),which one of Milton's tracts might have had upon a contemporary. It
17045,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was at Allan Bank that Coleridge dictated _The Friend_, and Wordsworth"
17046,WORDSWORTH (1875),"contributed to it two essays, one in answer to a letter of Mathetes"
17047,WORDSWORTH (1875),"(Professor Wilson), and the other on Epitaphs, republished in the"
17048,WORDSWORTH (1875),Notes to _The Excursion_. Here also he wrote his _Description of the
17049,WORDSWORTH (1875),Scenery of the Lakes_. Perhaps a truer explanation of the comparative
17050,WORDSWORTH (1875),silence of Wordsworth's Muse during these years is to be found in the
17051,WORDSWORTH (1875),"intense interest which he took in current events, whose variety,"
17052,WORDSWORTH (1875),"picturesqueness, and historical significance were enough to absorb all"
17053,WORDSWORTH (1875),the energies of his imagination.
17054,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17055,WORDSWORTH (1875),In the spring of 1811 Wordsworth removed to the Parsonage at Grasmere.
17056,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Here he remained two years, and here he had his second intimate"
17057,WORDSWORTH (1875),"experience of sorrow in the loss of two of his children, Catharine and"
17058,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Thomas, one of whom died 4th June, and the other 1st December, 1812."
17059,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Early in 1813 he bought Rydal Mount, and, having removed thither,"
17060,WORDSWORTH (1875),changed his abode no more during the rest of his life. In March of
17061,WORDSWORTH (1875),this year he was appointed Distributor of Stamps for the county of
17062,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Westmorland, an office whose receipts rendered him independent, and"
17063,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whose business he was able to do by deputy, thus leaving him ample"
17064,WORDSWORTH (1875),leisure for nobler duties. De Quincey speaks of this appointment as an
17065,WORDSWORTH (1875),instance of the remarkable good luck which waited upon Wordsworth
17066,WORDSWORTH (1875),through his whole life. In our view it is only another illustration of
17067,WORDSWORTH (1875),that scripture which describes the righteous as never forsaken. Good
17068,WORDSWORTH (1875),"luck is the willing handmaid of upright, energetic character, and"
17069,WORDSWORTH (1875),conscientious observance of duty. Wordsworth owed his nomination to
17070,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the friendly exertions of the Earl of Lonsdale, who desired to atone"
17071,WORDSWORTH (1875),"as far as might be for the injustice of the first Earl, and who"
17072,WORDSWORTH (1875),respected the honesty of the man more than he appreciated the
17073,WORDSWORTH (1875),originality of the poet. The Collectorship at Whitehaven (a more
17074,WORDSWORTH (1875),"lucrative office) was afterwards offered to Wordsworth, and declined."
17075,WORDSWORTH (1875),"He had enough for independence, and wished nothing more. Still later,"
17076,WORDSWORTH (1875),"on the death of the Stamp-Distributor for Cumberland, a part of that"
17077,WORDSWORTH (1875),"district was annexed to Westmorland, and Wordsworth's income was"
17078,WORDSWORTH (1875),"raised to something more than £1,000 a year."
17079,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17080,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In 1814 he made his second tour in Scotland, visiting Yarrow in"
17081,WORDSWORTH (1875),company with the Ettrick Shepherd. During this year _The Excursion_
17082,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was published, in an edition of five hundred copies, which supplied"
17083,WORDSWORTH (1875),the demand for six years. Another edition of the same number of copies
17084,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was published in 1827, and not exhausted till 1834. In 1815 _The White"
17085,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Doe of Rylstone_ appeared, and in 1816 _A Letter to a Friend of"
17086,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Burns_, in which Wordsworth gives his opinion upon the limits to be"
17087,WORDSWORTH (1875),observed by the biographers of literary men. It contains many valuable
17088,WORDSWORTH (1875),"suggestions, but allows hardly scope enough for personal details, to"
17089,WORDSWORTH (1875),which he was constitutionally indifferent. Nearly the same date may be
17090,WORDSWORTH (1875),ascribed to a rhymed translation of the first three books of the
17091,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Aeneid_, a specimen of which was printed in the Cambridge"
17092,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Philological Museum_ (1832). In 1819 _Peter Bell_, written twenty"
17093,WORDSWORTH (1875),"years before, was published, and, perhaps in consequence of the"
17094,WORDSWORTH (1875),"ridicule of the reviewers, found a more rapid sale than any of his"
17095,WORDSWORTH (1875),"previous volumes. _The Waggoner_, printed in the same year, was less"
17096,WORDSWORTH (1875),successful. His next publication was the volume of _Sonnets on the
17097,WORDSWORTH (1875),"river Duddon_, with some miscellaneous poems, 1820. A tour on the"
17098,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Continent in 1820 furnished the subjects for another collection,"
17099,WORDSWORTH (1875),published in 1822. This was followed in the same year by the volume of
17100,WORDSWORTH (1875),_Ecclesiastical Sketches_. His subsequent publications were _Yarrow
17101,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Revisited_, 1835, and the tragedy of _The Borderers_, 1842."
17102,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17103,WORDSWORTH (1875),"During all these years his fame was increasing slowly but steadily,"
17104,WORDSWORTH (1875),and his age gathered to itself the reverence and the troops of
17105,WORDSWORTH (1875),friends which his poems and the nobly simple life reflected in them
17106,WORDSWORTH (1875),deserved. Public honours followed private appreciation. In 1838 the
17107,WORDSWORTH (1875),University of Dublin conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L. In 1839
17108,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Oxford did the same, and the reception of the poet (now in his"
17109,WORDSWORTH (1875),seventieth year) at the University was enthusiastic. In 1842 he
17110,WORDSWORTH (1875),"resigned his office of Stamp-Distributor, and Sir Robert Peel had the"
17111,WORDSWORTH (1875),honour of putting him upon the civil list for a pension of £300. In
17112,WORDSWORTH (1875),"1843 he was appointed Laureate, with the express understanding that it"
17113,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was a tribute of respect, involving no duties except such as might be"
17114,WORDSWORTH (1875),self-imposed. His only official production was an Ode for the
17115,WORDSWORTH (1875),installation of Prince Albert as Chancellor of the University of
17116,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Cambridge. His life was prolonged yet seven years, almost, it should"
17117,WORDSWORTH (1875),"seem, that he might receive that honour which he had truly conquered"
17118,WORDSWORTH (1875),for himself by the unflinching bravery of a literary life of half a
17119,WORDSWORTH (1875),"century, unparalleled for the scorn with which its labours were"
17120,WORDSWORTH (1875),"received, and the victorious acknowledgement which at last crowned"
17121,WORDSWORTH (1875),"them. Surviving nearly all his contemporaries, he had, if ever any man"
17122,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had, a foretaste of immortality, enjoying in a sort his own posthumous"
17123,WORDSWORTH (1875),"renown, for the hardy slowness of its growth gave a safe pledge of its"
17124,WORDSWORTH (1875),"durability. He died on the 23rd of April, 1850, the anniversary of the"
17125,WORDSWORTH (1875),death of Shakespeare.
17126,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17127,WORDSWORTH (1875),"We have thus briefly sketched the life of Wordsworth,--a life"
17128,WORDSWORTH (1875),"uneventful even for a man of letters; a life like that of an oak, of"
17129,WORDSWORTH (1875),"quiet self-development, throwing out stronger roots toward the side"
17130,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whence the prevailing storm-blasts blow, and of tougher fibre in"
17131,WORDSWORTH (1875),proportion to the rocky nature of the soil in which it grows. The
17132,WORDSWORTH (1875),"life and growth of his mind, and the influences which shaped it, are"
17133,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to be looked for, even more than is the case with most poets, in his"
17134,WORDSWORTH (1875),"works, for he deliberately recorded them there."
17135,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17136,WORDSWORTH (1875),Of his personal characteristics little is related. He was somewhat
17137,WORDSWORTH (1875),"above the middle height, but, according to De Quincey, of indifferent"
17138,WORDSWORTH (1875),"figure, the shoulders being narrow and drooping. His finest feature"
17139,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was the eye, which was grey and full of spiritual light. Leigh Hunt"
17140,WORDSWORTH (1875),"says: 'I never beheld eyes that looked so inspired, so supernatural."
17141,WORDSWORTH (1875),"They were like fires, half burning, half smouldering, with a sort of"
17142,WORDSWORTH (1875),acrid fixture of regard. One might imagine Ezekiel or Isaiah to have
17143,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had such eyes.' Southey tells us that he had no sense of smell, and"
17144,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Haydon that he had none of form. The best likeness of him, in De"
17145,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Quincey's judgement, is the portrait of Milton prefixed to"
17146,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Richardson's notes on _Paradise Lost_. He was active in his habits,"
17147,WORDSWORTH (1875),"composing in the open air, and generally dictating his poems. His"
17148,WORDSWORTH (1875),"daily life was regular, simple, and frugal; his manners were dignified"
17149,WORDSWORTH (1875),and kindly; and in his letters and recorded conversations it is
17150,WORDSWORTH (1875),remarkable how little that was personal entered into his judgement of
17151,WORDSWORTH (1875),contemporaries.
17152,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17153,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The true rank of Wordsworth among poets is, perhaps, not even yet to"
17154,WORDSWORTH (1875),"be fairly estimated, so hard is it to escape into the quiet hall of"
17155,WORDSWORTH (1875),judgement uninflamed by the tumult of partisanship which besets the
17156,WORDSWORTH (1875),doors.
17157,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17158,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Coming to manhood, predetermined to be a great poet, at a time when"
17159,WORDSWORTH (1875),the artificial school of poetry was enthroned with all the authority
17160,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of long succession and undisputed legitimacy, it was almost"
17161,WORDSWORTH (1875),"inevitable that Wordsworth, who, both by nature and judgement was a"
17162,WORDSWORTH (1875),"rebel against the existing order, should become a partisan."
17163,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Unfortunately, he became not only the partisan of a system, but of"
17164,WORDSWORTH (1875),"William Wordsworth as its representative. Right in general principle,"
17165,WORDSWORTH (1875),he thus necessarily became wrong in particulars. Justly convinced that
17166,WORDSWORTH (1875),greatness only achieves its ends by implicitly obeying its own
17167,WORDSWORTH (1875),"instincts, he perhaps reduced the following his instincts too much to"
17168,WORDSWORTH (1875),"a system, mistook his own resentments for the promptings of his"
17169,WORDSWORTH (1875),"natural genius, and, compelling principle to the measure of his own"
17170,WORDSWORTH (1875),"temperament or even of the controversial exigency of the moment, fell"
17171,WORDSWORTH (1875),sometimes into the error of making naturalness itself artificial. If a
17172,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poet resolve to be original, it will end commonly in his being merely"
17173,WORDSWORTH (1875),peculiar.
17174,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17175,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth himself departed more and more in practice, as he grew"
17176,WORDSWORTH (1875),"older, from the theories which he had laid down in his prefaces;[46]"
17177,WORDSWORTH (1875),but those theories undoubtedly had a great effect in retarding the
17178,WORDSWORTH (1875),growth of his fame. He had carefully constructed a pair of spectacles
17179,WORDSWORTH (1875),"through which his earlier poems were to be studied, and the public"
17180,WORDSWORTH (1875),"insisted on looking through them at his mature works, and were"
17181,WORDSWORTH (1875),consequently unable to see fairly what required a different focus. He
17182,WORDSWORTH (1875),forced his readers to come to his poetry with a certain amount of
17183,WORDSWORTH (1875),"conscious preparation, and thus gave them beforehand the impression of"
17184,WORDSWORTH (1875),"something like mechanical artifice, and deprived them of the contented"
17185,WORDSWORTH (1875),repose of implicit faith. To the child a watch seems to be a living
17186,WORDSWORTH (1875),"creature; but Wordsworth would not let his readers be children, and"
17187,WORDSWORTH (1875),did injustice to himself by giving them an uneasy doubt whether
17188,WORDSWORTH (1875),"creations which really throbbed with the very heart's-blood of genius,"
17189,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and were alive with nature's life of life, were not contrivances of"
17190,WORDSWORTH (1875),wheels and springs. A naturalness which we are told to expect has lost
17191,WORDSWORTH (1875),the crowning grace of nature. The men who walked in Cornelius
17192,WORDSWORTH (1875),Agrippa's visionary gardens had probably no more pleasurable emotion
17193,WORDSWORTH (1875),"than that of a shallow wonder, or an equally shallow self-satisfaction"
17194,WORDSWORTH (1875),in thinking they had hit upon the secret of the thaumaturgy; but to a
17195,WORDSWORTH (1875),tree that has grown as God willed we come without a theory and with
17196,WORDSWORTH (1875),"no botanical predilections, enjoying it simply and thankfully; or the"
17197,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Imagination recreates for us its past summers and winters, the birds"
17198,WORDSWORTH (1875),"that have nested and sung in it, the sheep that have clustered in its"
17199,WORDSWORTH (1875),"shade, the winds that have visited it, the cloud-bergs that have"
17200,WORDSWORTH (1875),"drifted over it, and the snows that have ermined it in winter. The"
17201,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Imagination is a faculty that flouts at foreordination, and Wordsworth"
17202,WORDSWORTH (1875),seemed to do all he could to cheat his readers of her company by
17203,WORDSWORTH (1875),laying out paths with a peremptory _Do not step off the gravel!_ at
17204,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the opening of each, and preparing pitfalls for every conceivable"
17205,WORDSWORTH (1875),"emotion, with guide-boards to tell each when and where it must be"
17206,WORDSWORTH (1875),caught.
17207,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17208,WORDSWORTH (1875),[46] How far he swung backward toward the school under whose
17209,WORDSWORTH (1875),"influence he grew up, and toward the style against which he"
17210,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had protested so vigorously, a few examples will show. The"
17211,WORDSWORTH (1875),advocate of the language of common life has a verse in his
17212,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_Thanksgiving Ode_ which, if one met with it by itself, he"
17213,WORDSWORTH (1875),would think the achievement of some later copyist of Pope:
17214,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17215,WORDSWORTH (1875),While the _tubed engine_ [the organ] feels the inspiring blast.
17216,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17217,WORDSWORTH (1875),And in _The Italian Itinerant_ and _The Swiss Goatherd_ we
17218,WORDSWORTH (1875),find a thermometer or barometer called
17219,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17220,WORDSWORTH (1875),The well-wrought scale
17221,WORDSWORTH (1875),Whose sentient tube instructs to time
17222,WORDSWORTH (1875),A purpose to a fickle clime.
17223,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17224,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Still worse in the _Eclipse of the Sun_, 1821:"
17225,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17226,WORDSWORTH (1875),High on her speculative tower
17227,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Stood Science, waiting for the hour"
17228,WORDSWORTH (1875),When Sol was destined to endure
17229,WORDSWORTH (1875),That darkening.
17230,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17231,WORDSWORTH (1875),"So in _The Excursion_,"
17232,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17233,WORDSWORTH (1875),The cold March wind raised in her tender throat
17234,WORDSWORTH (1875),Viewless obstructions.
17235,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17236,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But if these things stood in the way of immediate appreciation, he had"
17237,WORDSWORTH (1875),another theory which interferes more seriously with the total and
17238,WORDSWORTH (1875),permanent effect of his poems. He was theoretically determined not
17239,WORDSWORTH (1875),"only to be a philosophic poet, but to be a _great_ philosophic poet,"
17240,WORDSWORTH (1875),and to this end he must produce an epic. Leaving aside the question
17241,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whether the epic be obsolete or not, it may be doubted whether the"
17242,WORDSWORTH (1875),history of a single man's mind is universal enough in its interest to
17243,WORDSWORTH (1875),"furnish all the requirements of the epic machinery, and it may be more"
17244,WORDSWORTH (1875),"than doubted whether a poet's philosophy be ordinary metaphysics,"
17245,WORDSWORTH (1875),divisible into chapter and section. It is rather something which is
17246,WORDSWORTH (1875),"more energetic in a word than in a whole treatise, and our hearts"
17247,WORDSWORTH (1875),unclose themselves instinctively at its simple _Open sesame!_ while
17248,WORDSWORTH (1875),they would stand firm against the reading of the whole body of
17249,WORDSWORTH (1875),"philosophy. In point of fact, the one element of greatness which _The"
17250,WORDSWORTH (1875),Excursion_ possesses indisputably is heaviness. It is only the
17251,WORDSWORTH (1875),"episodes that are universally read, and the effect of these is diluted"
17252,WORDSWORTH (1875),by the connecting and accompanying lectures on metaphysics. Wordsworth
17253,WORDSWORTH (1875),"had his epic mould to fill, and, like Benvenuto Cellini in casting his"
17254,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Perseus, was forced to throw in everything, debasing the metal, lest"
17255,WORDSWORTH (1875),"it should run short. Separated from the rest, the episodes are perfect"
17256,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poems in their kind, and without example in the language."
17257,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17258,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth, like most solitary men of strong minds, was a good critic"
17259,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of the substance of poetry, but somewhat niggardly in the allowance he"
17260,WORDSWORTH (1875),made for those subsidiary qualities which make it the charmer of
17261,WORDSWORTH (1875),leisure and the employment of minds without definite object. It may be
17262,WORDSWORTH (1875),"doubted, indeed, whether he set much store by any contemporary writing"
17263,WORDSWORTH (1875),"but his own, and whether he did not look upon poetry too exclusively"
17264,WORDSWORTH (1875),as an exercise rather of the intellect than as a nepenthe of the
17265,WORDSWORTH (1875),"imagination. He says of himself, speaking of his youth:"
17266,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17267,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In fine,"
17268,WORDSWORTH (1875),"I was a better judge of thoughts than words,"
17269,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Misled in estimating words, not only"
17270,WORDSWORTH (1875),"By common inexperience of youth,"
17271,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But by the trade in classic niceties,"
17272,WORDSWORTH (1875),The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase
17273,WORDSWORTH (1875),From languages that want the living voice
17274,WORDSWORTH (1875),To carry meaning to the natural heart;
17275,WORDSWORTH (1875),"To tell us what is passion, what is truth,"
17276,WORDSWORTH (1875),"What reason, what simplicity and sense.[47]"
17277,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17278,WORDSWORTH (1875),"[47] _Prelude_, Book VI."
17279,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17280,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Though he here speaks in the preterite tense, this was always true of"
17281,WORDSWORTH (1875),"him, and his thought seems often to lean upon a word too weak to bear"
17282,WORDSWORTH (1875),its weight. No reader of adequate insight can help regretting that he
17283,WORDSWORTH (1875),did not earlier give himself to 'the trade of classic niceties'. It
17284,WORDSWORTH (1875),was precisely this which gives to the blank-verse of Landor the severe
17285,WORDSWORTH (1875),dignity and reserved force which alone among later poets recall the
17286,WORDSWORTH (1875),"tune of Milton, and to which Wordsworth never attained. Indeed,"
17287,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth's blank-verse (though the passion be profounder) is always
17288,WORDSWORTH (1875),essentially that of Cowper. They were alike also in their love of
17289,WORDSWORTH (1875),outward nature and of simple things. The main difference between them
17290,WORDSWORTH (1875),"is one of scenery rather than of sentiment, between the lifelong"
17291,WORDSWORTH (1875),familiar of the mountains and the dweller on the plain.
17292,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17293,WORDSWORTH (1875),It cannot be denied that in Wordsworth the very highest powers of the
17294,WORDSWORTH (1875),poetic mind were associated with a certain tendency to the diffuse and
17295,WORDSWORTH (1875),commonplace. It is in the understanding (always prosaic) that the
17296,WORDSWORTH (1875),great golden veins of his imagination are imbedded. He wrote too much
17297,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to write always well; for it is not a great Xerxes-army of words, but"
17298,WORDSWORTH (1875),"a compact Greek ten thousand, that march safely down to posterity. He"
17299,WORDSWORTH (1875),"set tasks to his divine faculty, which is much the same as trying to"
17300,WORDSWORTH (1875),make Jove's eagle do the service of a clucking hen. Throughout _The
17301,WORDSWORTH (1875),Prelude_ and _The Excursion_ he seems striving to bind the wizard
17302,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Imagination with the sand-ropes of dry disquisition, and to have"
17303,WORDSWORTH (1875),forgotten the potent spell-word which would make the particles cohere.
17304,WORDSWORTH (1875),There is an arenaceous quality in the style which makes progress
17305,WORDSWORTH (1875),wearisome. Yet with what splendours as of mountain-sunsets are we
17306,WORDSWORTH (1875),rewarded! what golden rounds of verse do we not see stretching
17307,WORDSWORTH (1875),heavenward with angels ascending and descending! what haunting
17308,WORDSWORTH (1875),harmonies hover around us deep and eternal like the undying baritone
17309,WORDSWORTH (1875),of the sea! and if we are compelled to fare through sands and desert
17310,WORDSWORTH (1875),"wildernesses, how often do we not hear airy shapes that syllable our"
17311,WORDSWORTH (1875),names with a startling personal appeal to our highest consciousness
17312,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and our noblest aspiration, such as we wait for in vain in any other"
17313,WORDSWORTH (1875),poet!
17314,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17315,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Take from Wordsworth all which an honest criticism cannot but allow,"
17316,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and what is left will show how truly great he was. He had no humour,"
17317,WORDSWORTH (1875),"no dramatic power, and his temperament was of that dry and juiceless"
17318,WORDSWORTH (1875),"quality, that in all his published correspondence you shall not find a"
17319,WORDSWORTH (1875),"letter, but only essays. If we consider carefully where he was most"
17320,WORDSWORTH (1875),"successful, we shall find that it was not so much in description of"
17321,WORDSWORTH (1875),"natural scenery, or delineation of character, as in vivid expression"
17322,WORDSWORTH (1875),of the effect produced by external objects and events upon his own
17323,WORDSWORTH (1875),"mind, and of the shape and hue (perhaps momentary) which they in turn"
17324,WORDSWORTH (1875),took from his mood or temperament. His finest passages are always
17325,WORDSWORTH (1875),"monologues. He had a fondness for particulars, and there are parts of"
17326,WORDSWORTH (1875),his poems which remind us of local histories in the undue relative
17327,WORDSWORTH (1875),importance given to trivial matters. He was the historian of
17328,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworthshire. This power of particularization (for it is as truly a
17329,WORDSWORTH (1875),power as generalization) is what gives such vigour and greatness to
17330,WORDSWORTH (1875),"single lines and sentiments of Wordsworth, and to poems developing a"
17331,WORDSWORTH (1875),single thought or sentiment. It was this that made him so fond of the
17332,WORDSWORTH (1875),sonnet. That sequestered nook forced upon him the limits which his
17333,WORDSWORTH (1875),fecundity (if I may not say his garrulity) was never self-denying
17334,WORDSWORTH (1875),enough to impose on itself. It suits his solitary and meditative
17335,WORDSWORTH (1875),"temper, and it was there that Lamb (an admirable judge of what was"
17336,WORDSWORTH (1875),"permanent in literature) liked him best. Its narrow bounds, but"
17337,WORDSWORTH (1875),"fourteen paces from end to end, turn into a virtue his too common"
17338,WORDSWORTH (1875),fault of giving undue prominence to every passing emotion. He excels
17339,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in monologue, and the law of the sonnet tempers monologue with mercy."
17340,WORDSWORTH (1875),In _The Excursion_ we are driven to the subterfuge of a French verdict
17341,WORDSWORTH (1875),of extenuating circumstances. His mind had not that reach and
17342,WORDSWORTH (1875),"elemental movement of Milton's, which, like the trade-wind, gathered"
17343,WORDSWORTH (1875),to itself thoughts and images like stately fleets from every quarter;
17344,WORDSWORTH (1875),"some deep with silks and spicery, some brooding over the silent"
17345,WORDSWORTH (1875),"thunders of their battailous armaments, but all swept forward in their"
17346,WORDSWORTH (1875),"destined track, over the long billows of his verse, every inch of"
17347,WORDSWORTH (1875),canvas strained by the unifying breath of their common epic impulse.
17348,WORDSWORTH (1875),"It was an organ that Milton mastered, mighty in compass, capable"
17349,WORDSWORTH (1875),"equally of the trumpet's ardours or the slim delicacy of the flute,"
17350,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and sometimes it bursts forth in great crashes through his prose, as"
17351,WORDSWORTH (1875),if he touched it for solace in the intervals of his toil. If
17352,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth sometimes puts the trumpet to his lips, yet he lays it"
17353,WORDSWORTH (1875),"aside soon and willingly for his appropriate instrument, the pastoral"
17354,WORDSWORTH (1875),"reed. And it is not one that grew by any vulgar stream, but that which"
17355,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Apollo breathed through, tending the flocks of Admetus,--that which"
17356,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Pan endowed with every melody of the visible universe,--the same in"
17357,WORDSWORTH (1875),which the soul of the despairing nymph took refuge and gifted with her
17358,WORDSWORTH (1875),"dual nature,--so that ever and anon, amid the notes of human joy or"
17359,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sorrow, there comes suddenly a deeper and almost awful tone,"
17360,WORDSWORTH (1875),thrilling us into dim consciousness of a forgotten divinity.
17361,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17362,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth's absolute want of humour, while it no doubt confirmed his"
17363,WORDSWORTH (1875),self-confidence by making him insensible both to the comical
17364,WORDSWORTH (1875),incongruity into which he was often led by his earlier theory
17365,WORDSWORTH (1875),concerning the language of poetry and to the not unnatural ridicule
17366,WORDSWORTH (1875),"called forth by it, seems to have been indicative of a certain"
17367,WORDSWORTH (1875),dullness of perception in other directions.[48] We cannot help
17368,WORDSWORTH (1875),"feeling that the material of his nature was essentially prose, which,"
17369,WORDSWORTH (1875),"in his inspired moments, he had the power of transmuting, but which,"
17370,WORDSWORTH (1875),"whenever the inspiration failed or was factitious, remained"
17371,WORDSWORTH (1875),obstinately leaden. The normal condition of many poets would seem to
17372,WORDSWORTH (1875),approach that temperature to which Wordsworth's mind could be raised
17373,WORDSWORTH (1875),only by the white heat of profoundly inward passion. And in proportion
17374,WORDSWORTH (1875),to the intensity needful to make his nature thoroughly aglow is the
17375,WORDSWORTH (1875),very high quality of his best verses. They seem rather the productions
17376,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of nature than of man, and have the lastingness of such, delighting"
17377,WORDSWORTH (1875),our age with the same startle of newness and beauty that pleased our
17378,WORDSWORTH (1875),youth. Is it his thought? It has the shifting inward lustre of
17379,WORDSWORTH (1875),diamond. Is it his feeling? It is as delicate as the impressions of
17380,WORDSWORTH (1875),fossil ferns. He seems to have caught and fixed for ever in immutable
17381,WORDSWORTH (1875),"grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions, the very"
17382,WORDSWORTH (1875),ripple-marks on the remotest shores of being. But this intensity of
17383,WORDSWORTH (1875),mood which insures high quality is by its very nature incapable of
17384,WORDSWORTH (1875),"prolongation, and Wordsworth, in endeavouring it, falls more below"
17385,WORDSWORTH (1875),"himself, and is, more even than many poets his inferiors in"
17386,WORDSWORTH (1875),"imaginative quality, a poet of passages. Indeed, one cannot help"
17387,WORDSWORTH (1875),having the feeling sometimes that the poem is there for the sake of
17388,WORDSWORTH (1875),"these passages, rather than that these are the natural jets and"
17389,WORDSWORTH (1875),elations of a mind energized by the rapidity of its own motion. In
17390,WORDSWORTH (1875),"other words, the happy couplet or gracious image seems not to spring"
17391,WORDSWORTH (1875),"from the inspiration of the poem conceived as a whole, but rather to"
17392,WORDSWORTH (1875),have dropped of itself into the mind of the poet in one of his
17393,WORDSWORTH (1875),"rambles, who then, in a less rapt mood, has patiently built up around"
17394,WORDSWORTH (1875),it a setting of verse too often ungraceful in form and of a material
17395,WORDSWORTH (1875),whose cheapness may cast a doubt on the priceless quality of the gem
17396,WORDSWORTH (1875),it encumbers.[49] During the most happily productive period of his
17397,WORDSWORTH (1875),"life, Wordsworth was impatient of what may be called the mechanical"
17398,WORDSWORTH (1875),portion of his art. His wife and sister seem from the first to have
17399,WORDSWORTH (1875),"been his scribes. In later years, he had learned and often insisted"
17400,WORDSWORTH (1875),"on the truth that poetry was an art no less than a gift, and corrected"
17401,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his poems in cold blood, sometimes to their detriment. But he"
17402,WORDSWORTH (1875),"certainly had more of the vision than of the faculty divine, and was"
17403,WORDSWORTH (1875),always a little numb on the side of form and proportion. Perhaps his
17404,WORDSWORTH (1875),"best poem in these respects is the _Laodamia_, and it is not"
17405,WORDSWORTH (1875),uninstructive to learn from his own lips that 'it cost him more
17406,WORDSWORTH (1875),trouble than almost anything of equal length he had ever written'. His
17407,WORDSWORTH (1875),longer poems (miscalled epical) have no more intimate bond of union
17408,WORDSWORTH (1875),than their more or less immediate relation to his own personality. Of
17409,WORDSWORTH (1875),"character other than his own he had but a faint conception, and all"
17410,WORDSWORTH (1875),the personages of _The Excursion_ that are not Wordsworth are the
17411,WORDSWORTH (1875),"merest shadows of himself upon mist, for his self-concentrated nature"
17412,WORDSWORTH (1875),was incapable of projecting itself into the consciousness of other men
17413,WORDSWORTH (1875),and seeing the springs of action at their source in the recesses of
17414,WORDSWORTH (1875),individual character. The best parts of these longer poems are bursts
17415,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of impassioned soliloquy, and his fingers were always clumsy at the"
17416,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_callida junctura_. The stream of narration is sluggish, if varied by"
17417,WORDSWORTH (1875),times with pleasing reflections (_viridesque placido aequore sylvas_);
17418,WORDSWORTH (1875),"we are forced to do our own rowing, and only when the current is"
17419,WORDSWORTH (1875),hemmed in by some narrow gorge of the poet's personal consciousness do
17420,WORDSWORTH (1875),we feel ourselves snatched along on the smooth but impetuous rush of
17421,WORDSWORTH (1875),unmistakable inspiration. The fact that what is precious in
17422,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth's poetry was (more truly even than with some greater poets
17423,WORDSWORTH (1875),than he) a gift rather than an achievement should always be borne in
17424,WORDSWORTH (1875),mind in taking the measure of his power. I know not whether to call
17425,WORDSWORTH (1875),"it height or depth, this peculiarity of his, but it certainly endows"
17426,WORDSWORTH (1875),those parts of his work which we should distinguish as Wordsworthian
17427,WORDSWORTH (1875),with an unexpectedness and impressiveness of originality such as we
17428,WORDSWORTH (1875),feel in the presence of Nature herself. He seems to have been half
17429,WORDSWORTH (1875),"conscious of this, and recited his own poems to all comers with an"
17430,WORDSWORTH (1875),enthusiasm of wondering admiration that would have been profoundly
17431,WORDSWORTH (1875),comic but for its simple sincerity and for the fact that William
17432,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth, Esquire, of Rydal Mount, was one person, and the William"
17433,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth whom he so heartily reverenced quite another. We recognize
17434,WORDSWORTH (1875),"two voices in him, as Stephano did in Caliban. There are Jeremiah and"
17435,WORDSWORTH (1875),"his scribe Baruch. If the prophet cease from dictating, the"
17436,WORDSWORTH (1875),"amanuensis, rather than be idle, employs his pen in jotting down some"
17437,WORDSWORTH (1875),"anecdotes of his master, how he one day went out and saw an old woman,"
17438,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and the next day did _not_, and so came home and dictated some verses"
17439,WORDSWORTH (1875),"on this ominous phenomenon, and how another day he saw a cow. These"
17440,WORDSWORTH (1875),"marginal annotations have been carelessly taken up into the text, have"
17441,WORDSWORTH (1875),"been religiously held by the pious to be orthodox scripture, and by"
17442,WORDSWORTH (1875),dexterous exegesis have been made to yield deeply oracular meanings.
17443,WORDSWORTH (1875),Presently the real prophet takes up the word again and speaks as one
17444,WORDSWORTH (1875),"divinely inspired, the Voice of a higher and invisible power."
17445,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworth's better utterances have the bare sincerity, the absolute"
17446,WORDSWORTH (1875),"abstraction from time and place, the immunity from decay, that belong"
17447,WORDSWORTH (1875),to the grand simplicities of the Bible. They seem not more his own
17448,WORDSWORTH (1875),"than ours and every man's, the word of the inalterable Mind. This gift"
17449,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of his was naturally very much a matter of temperament, and"
17450,WORDSWORTH (1875),accordingly by far the greater part of his finer product belongs to
17451,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the period of his prime, ere Time had set his lumpish foot on the"
17452,WORDSWORTH (1875),pedal that deadens the nerves of animal sensibility.[50] He did not
17453,WORDSWORTH (1875),grow as those poets do in whom the artistic sense is predominant. One
17454,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of the most delightful fancies of the Genevese humorist, Toepffer, is"
17455,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the poet Albert, who, having had his portrait drawn by a highly"
17456,WORDSWORTH (1875),"idealizing hand, does his best afterwards to look like it. Many of"
17457,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth's later poems seem like rather unsuccessful efforts to
17458,WORDSWORTH (1875),"resemble his former self. They would never, as Sir John Harington says"
17459,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of poetry, 'keep a child from play and an old man from the"
17460,WORDSWORTH (1875),chimney-corner'.[51]
17461,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17462,WORDSWORTH (1875),[48] Nowhere is this displayed with more comic
17463,WORDSWORTH (1875),self-complacency than when he thought it needful to rewrite
17464,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the ballad of Helen of Kirconnel,--a poem hardly to be"
17465,WORDSWORTH (1875),matched in any language for swiftness of movement and savage
17466,WORDSWORTH (1875),sincerity of feeling. Its shuddering compression is masterly.
17467,WORDSWORTH (1875),Compare:
17468,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17469,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Curst be the heart that thought the thought,"
17470,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And curst the hand that fired the shot,"
17471,WORDSWORTH (1875),"When in my arms burd Helen dropt,"
17472,WORDSWORTH (1875),That died to succour me!
17473,WORDSWORTH (1875),"O, think ye not my heart was sair"
17474,WORDSWORTH (1875),When my love dropt down and spake na mair?
17475,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17476,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Compare this with,--"
17477,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17478,WORDSWORTH (1875),Proud Gordon cannot bear the thoughts
17479,WORDSWORTH (1875),"That through his brain are travelling,"
17480,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And, starting up, to Bruce's heart"
17481,WORDSWORTH (1875),He launched a deadly javelin:
17482,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Fair Ellen saw it when it came,"
17483,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And, _stepping forth to meet the same_,"
17484,WORDSWORTH (1875),Did with her body cover
17485,WORDSWORTH (1875),"The Youth, her chosen lover."

17490,WORDSWORTH (1875),"_The Gordon_) sailed away to Spain,"
17491,WORDSWORTH (1875),And fought with rage incessant
17492,WORDSWORTH (1875),Against the Moorish Crescent.
17493,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17494,WORDSWORTH (1875),These are surely the versos of an attorney's clerk 'penning a
17495,WORDSWORTH (1875),stanza when he should engross'. It will be noticed that
17496,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth here also departs from his earlier theory of the
17497,WORDSWORTH (1875),language of poetry by substituting a javelin for a bullet as
17498,WORDSWORTH (1875),less modern and familiar. Had he written
17499,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17500,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And Gordon never gave a hint,"
17501,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But, having somewhat picked his flint,"
17502,WORDSWORTH (1875),Let fly the fatal bullet
17503,WORDSWORTH (1875),"That killed that lovely pullet,"
17504,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17505,WORDSWORTH (1875),it would hardly have seemed more like a parody than the rest.
17506,WORDSWORTH (1875),He shows the same insensibility in a note upon the _Ancient
17507,WORDSWORTH (1875),Mariner_ in the second edition of the _Lyrical Ballads_: 'The
17508,WORDSWORTH (1875),"poem of my friend has indeed great defects; first, that the"
17509,WORDSWORTH (1875),"principal person has no distinct character, either in his"
17510,WORDSWORTH (1875),"profession of mariner, or as a human being who, having been"
17511,WORDSWORTH (1875),"long under the control of supernatural impressions, might be"
17512,WORDSWORTH (1875),supposed himself to partake of something supernatural;
17513,WORDSWORTH (1875),"secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted"
17514,WORDSWORTH (1875),"upon; thirdly, that the events, having no necessary"
17515,WORDSWORTH (1875),"connexion, do not produce each other; and lastly, that the"
17516,WORDSWORTH (1875),imagery is somewhat laboriously accumulated.' Here is an
17517,WORDSWORTH (1875),"indictment, to be sure, and drawn, plainly enough, by the"
17518,WORDSWORTH (1875),attorney's clerk aforenamed. One would think that the strange
17519,WORDSWORTH (1875),charm of Coleridge's most truly original poems lay in this
17520,WORDSWORTH (1875),very emancipation from the laws of cause and effect.
17521,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17522,WORDSWORTH (1875),[49]
17523,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17524,WORDSWORTH (1875),"A hundred times when, roving high and low,"
17525,WORDSWORTH (1875),"I have been harassed with the toil of verse,"
17526,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Much pains and little progress, and at once"
17527,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Some lovely Image in the song rose up,"
17528,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea."

17531,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17532,WORDSWORTH (1875),[50] His best poetry was written when he was under the
17533,WORDSWORTH (1875),immediate influence of Coleridge. Coleridge seems to have
17534,WORDSWORTH (1875),"felt this, for it is evidently to Wordsworth that he alludes"
17535,WORDSWORTH (1875),when he speaks of 'those who have been so well pleased that I
17536,WORDSWORTH (1875),"should, year after year, flow with a hundred nameless rills"
17537,WORDSWORTH (1875),"into _their_ main stream' (_Letters, Conversations, and"
17538,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Recollections of S. T. C._, vol. i, pp. 5-6). Wordsworth"
17539,WORDSWORTH (1875),found fault with the repetition of the concluding sound of
17540,WORDSWORTH (1875),the participles in Shakespeare's line about bees:
17541,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17542,WORDSWORTH (1875),The singing masons building roofs of gold.
17543,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17544,WORDSWORTH (1875),"This, he said, was a line that Milton never would have"
17545,WORDSWORTH (1875),"written. Keats thought, on the other hand, that the"
17546,WORDSWORTH (1875),repetition was in harmony with the continued note of the
17547,WORDSWORTH (1875),singers' (Leigh Hunt's _Autobiography_). Wordsworth writes to
17548,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Crabb Robinson in 1837, 'My ear is susceptible to the"
17549,WORDSWORTH (1875),clashing of sounds almost to disease.' One cannot help
17550,WORDSWORTH (1875),thinking that his training in these niceties was begun by
17551,WORDSWORTH (1875),Coleridge.
17552,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17553,WORDSWORTH (1875),[51] In the Preface to his translation of the _Orlando
17554,WORDSWORTH (1875),Furioso_.
17555,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17556,WORDSWORTH (1875),Chief Justice Marshall once blandly interrupted a junior counsel who
17557,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was arguing certain obvious points of law at needless length, by"
17558,WORDSWORTH (1875),"saying, 'Brother Jones, there are _some_ things which a Supreme Court"
17559,WORDSWORTH (1875),of the United States sitting in equity may be presumed to know.'
17560,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth has this fault of enforcing and restating obvious points
17561,WORDSWORTH (1875),till the reader feels as if his own intelligence were somewhat
17562,WORDSWORTH (1875),"underrated. He is over-conscientious in giving us full measure, and"
17563,WORDSWORTH (1875),"once profoundly absorbed in the sound of his own voice, he knows not"
17564,WORDSWORTH (1875),"when to stop. If he feel himself flagging, he has a droll way of"
17565,WORDSWORTH (1875),"keeping the floor, as it were, by asking himself a series of questions"
17566,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sometimes not needing, and often incapable of answer. There are three"
17567,WORDSWORTH (1875),"stanzas of such near the close of the First Part of _Peter Bell_,"
17568,WORDSWORTH (1875),"where Peter first catches a glimpse of the dead body in the water, all"
17569,WORDSWORTH (1875),"happily incongruous, and ending with one which reaches the height of"
17570,WORDSWORTH (1875),comicality:
17571,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17572,WORDSWORTH (1875),Is it a fiend that to a stake
17573,WORDSWORTH (1875),Of fire his desperate self is tethering?
17574,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell,"
17575,WORDSWORTH (1875),"In solitary ward or cell,"
17576,WORDSWORTH (1875),Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?
17577,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17578,WORDSWORTH (1875),The same want of humour which made him insensible to incongruity may
17579,WORDSWORTH (1875),perhaps account also for the singular unconsciousness of disproportion
17580,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which so often strikes us in his poetry. For example, a little farther"
17581,WORDSWORTH (1875),on in _Peter Bell_ we find:
17582,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17583,WORDSWORTH (1875),_Now_--like a tempest-shattered bark
17584,WORDSWORTH (1875),"That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,"
17585,WORDSWORTH (1875),And in a moment to the verge
17586,WORDSWORTH (1875),Is lifted of a foaming surge--
17587,WORDSWORTH (1875),Full suddenly the Ass doth rise!
17588,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17589,WORDSWORTH (1875),"And one cannot help thinking that the similes of the huge stone, the"
17590,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sea-beast, and the cloud, noble as they are in themselves, are"
17591,WORDSWORTH (1875),somewhat too lofty for the service to which they are put.[52]
17592,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17593,WORDSWORTH (1875),[52] In _Resolution and Independence_.
17594,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17595,WORDSWORTH (1875),The movement of Wordsworth's mind was too slow and his mood too
17596,WORDSWORTH (1875),meditative for narrative poetry. He values his own thoughts and
17597,WORDSWORTH (1875),reflections too much to sacrifice the least of them to the interests
17598,WORDSWORTH (1875),"of his story. Moreover, it is never action that interests him, but the"
17599,WORDSWORTH (1875),subtle motives that lead to or hinder it. _The Waggoner_ involuntarily
17600,WORDSWORTH (1875),"suggests a comparison with _Tam O'Shanter_, infinitely to its own"
17601,WORDSWORTH (1875),"disadvantage. _Peter Bell_, full though it be of profound touches and"
17602,WORDSWORTH (1875),"subtle analysis, is lumbering and disjointed. Even Lamb was forced to"
17603,WORDSWORTH (1875),"confess that he did not like it. _The White Doe_, the most"
17604,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Wordsworthian of them all in the best meaning of the epithet, is also"
17605,WORDSWORTH (1875),only the more truly so for being diffuse and reluctant. What charms in
17606,WORDSWORTH (1875),Wordsworth and will charm for ever is the
17607,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17608,WORDSWORTH (1875),Happy tone
17609,WORDSWORTH (1875),Of meditation slipping in between
17610,WORDSWORTH (1875),The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
17611,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17612,WORDSWORTH (1875),"A few poets, in the exquisite adaptation of their words to the tune of"
17613,WORDSWORTH (1875),"our own feelings and fancies, in the charm of their manner,"
17614,WORDSWORTH (1875),"indefinable as the sympathetic grace of woman, _are_ everything to us"
17615,WORDSWORTH (1875),without our being able to say that they are much in themselves. They
17616,WORDSWORTH (1875),rather narcotize than fortify. Wordsworth must subject our mood to his
17617,WORDSWORTH (1875),"own before he admits us to his intimacy; but, once admitted, it is for"
17618,WORDSWORTH (1875),"life, and we find ourselves in his debt, not for what he has been to"
17619,WORDSWORTH (1875),"us in our hours of relaxation, but for what he has done for us as a"
17620,WORDSWORTH (1875),reinforcement of faltering purpose and personal independence of
17621,WORDSWORTH (1875),"character. His system of a Nature-cure, first professed by Dr. Jean"
17622,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Jacques and continued by Cowper, certainly breaks down as a whole. The"
17623,WORDSWORTH (1875),"Solitary of _The Excursion_, who has not been cured of his scepticism"
17624,WORDSWORTH (1875),"by living among the medicinal mountains, is, so far as we can see,"
17625,WORDSWORTH (1875),equally proof against the lectures of Pedlar and Parson. Wordsworth
17626,WORDSWORTH (1875),"apparently felt that this would be so, and accordingly never saw his"
17627,WORDSWORTH (1875),"way clear to finishing the poem. But the treatment, whether a panacea"
17628,WORDSWORTH (1875),"or not, is certainly wholesome inasmuch as it inculcates abstinence,"
17629,WORDSWORTH (1875),"exercise, and uncontaminate air. I am not sure, indeed, that the"
17630,WORDSWORTH (1875),Nature-cure theory does not tend to foster in constitutions less
17631,WORDSWORTH (1875),vigorous than Wordsworth's what Milton would call a fugitive and
17632,WORDSWORTH (1875),cloistered virtue at a dear expense of manlier qualities. The ancients
17633,WORDSWORTH (1875),"and our own Elizabethans, ere spiritual megrims had become"
17634,WORDSWORTH (1875),"fashionable, perhaps made more out of life by taking a frank delight"
17635,WORDSWORTH (1875),in its action and passion and by grappling with the facts of this
17636,WORDSWORTH (1875),"world, rather than muddling themselves over the insoluble problems of"
17637,WORDSWORTH (1875),"another. If they had not discovered the picturesque, as we understand"
17638,WORDSWORTH (1875),"it, they found surprisingly fine scenery in man and his destiny, and"
17639,WORDSWORTH (1875),"would have seen something ludicrous, it may be suspected, in the"
17640,WORDSWORTH (1875),spectacle of a grown man running to hide his head in the apron of the
17641,WORDSWORTH (1875),Mighty Mother whenever he had an ache in his finger or got a bruise in
17642,WORDSWORTH (1875),the tussle for existence.
17643,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17644,WORDSWORTH (1875),"But when, as I have said, our impartiality has made all those"
17645,WORDSWORTH (1875),qualifications and deductions against which even the greatest poet may
17646,WORDSWORTH (1875),"not plead his privilege, what is left to Wordsworth is enough to"
17647,WORDSWORTH (1875),"justify his fame. Even where his genius is wrapped in clouds, the"
17648,WORDSWORTH (1875),"unconquerable lightning of imagination struggles through, flashing out"
17649,WORDSWORTH (1875),"unexpected vistas, and illuminating the humdrum pathway of our daily"
17650,WORDSWORTH (1875),thought with a radiance of momentary consciousness that seems like a
17651,WORDSWORTH (1875),revelation. If it be the most delightful function of the poet to set
17652,WORDSWORTH (1875),"our lives to music, yet perhaps he will be even more sure of our"
17653,WORDSWORTH (1875),maturer gratitude if he do his part also as moralist and philosopher
17654,WORDSWORTH (1875),to purify and enlighten; if he define and encourage our vacillating
17655,WORDSWORTH (1875),perceptions of duty; if he piece together our fragmentary
17656,WORDSWORTH (1875),apprehensions of our own life and that larger life whose unconscious
17657,WORDSWORTH (1875),"instruments we are, making of the jumbled bits of our dissected map of"
17658,WORDSWORTH (1875),experience a coherent chart. In the great poets there is an exquisite
17659,WORDSWORTH (1875),sensibility both of soul and sense that sympathizes like gossamer
17660,WORDSWORTH (1875),"sea-moss with every movement of the element in which it floats, but"
17661,WORDSWORTH (1875),which is rooted on the solid rock of our common sympathies. Wordsworth
17662,WORDSWORTH (1875),shows less of this finer feminine fibre of organization than one or
17663,WORDSWORTH (1875),"two of his contemporaries, notably than Coleridge or Shelley; but he"
17664,WORDSWORTH (1875),"was a masculine thinker, and in his more characteristic poems there is"
17665,WORDSWORTH (1875),always a kernel of firm conclusion from far-reaching principles that
17666,WORDSWORTH (1875),stimulates thought and challenges meditation. Groping in the dark
17667,WORDSWORTH (1875),"passages of life, we come upon some axiom of his, as it were a wall"
17668,WORDSWORTH (1875),that gives us our bearings and enables us to find an outlet. Compared
17669,WORDSWORTH (1875),with Goethe we feel that he lacks that serene impartiality of mind
17670,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which results from breadth of culture; nay, he seems narrow, insular,"
17671,WORDSWORTH (1875),almost provincial. He reminds us of those saints of Dante who gather
17672,WORDSWORTH (1875),brightness by revolving on their own axis. But through this very
17673,WORDSWORTH (1875),limitation of range he gains perhaps in intensity and the
17674,WORDSWORTH (1875),impressiveness which results from eagerness of personal conviction. If
17675,WORDSWORTH (1875),"we read Wordsworth through, as I have just done, we find ourselves"
17676,WORDSWORTH (1875),"changing our mind about him at every other page, so uneven is he. If"
17677,WORDSWORTH (1875),"we read our favourite poems or passages only, he will seem uniformly"
17678,WORDSWORTH (1875),great. And even as regards _The Excursion_ we should remember how few
17679,WORDSWORTH (1875),long poems will bear consecutive reading. For my part I know of but
17680,WORDSWORTH (1875),"one,--the _Odyssey_."
17681,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17682,WORDSWORTH (1875),None of our great poets can be called popular in any exact sense of
17683,WORDSWORTH (1875),"the word, for the highest poetry deals with thoughts and emotions"
17684,WORDSWORTH (1875),"which inhabit, like rarest sea-mosses, the doubtful limits of that"
17685,WORDSWORTH (1875),"shore between our abiding divine and our fluctuating human nature,"
17686,WORDSWORTH (1875),"rooted in the one, but living in the other, seldom laid bare, and"
17687,WORDSWORTH (1875),otherwise visible only at exceptional moments of entire calm and
17688,WORDSWORTH (1875),clearness. Of no other poet except Shakespeare have so many phrases
17689,WORDSWORTH (1875),become household words as of Wordsworth. If Pope has made current more
17690,WORDSWORTH (1875),"epigrams of worldly wisdom, to Wordsworth belongs the nobler praise of"
17691,WORDSWORTH (1875),"having defined for us, and given us for a daily possession, those"
17692,WORDSWORTH (1875),faint and vague suggestions of other-worldliness of whose gentle
17693,WORDSWORTH (1875),ministry with our baser nature the hurry and bustle of life scarcely
17694,WORDSWORTH (1875),ever allowed us to be conscious. He has won for himself a secure
17695,WORDSWORTH (1875),immortality by a depth of intuition which makes only the best minds at
17696,WORDSWORTH (1875),"their best hours worthy, or indeed capable, of his companionship, and"
17697,WORDSWORTH (1875),by a homely sincerity of human sympathy which reaches the humblest
17698,WORDSWORTH (1875),heart. Our language owes him gratitude for the habitual purity and
17699,WORDSWORTH (1875),"abstinence of his style, and we who speak it, for having emboldened us"
17700,WORDSWORTH (1875),"to take delight in simple things, and to trust ourselves to our own"
17701,WORDSWORTH (1875),instincts. And he hath his reward. It needs not to bid
17702,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17703,WORDSWORTH (1875),Renowned Chaucer lie a thought more nigh
17704,WORDSWORTH (1875),"To rare Beaumont, and learned Beaumont lie"
17705,WORDSWORTH (1875),A little nearer Spenser;
17706,WORDSWORTH (1875),
17707,WORDSWORTH (1875),for there is no fear of crowding in that little society with whom he
17708,WORDSWORTH (1875),is now enrolled as fifth in the succession of the great English Poets.
