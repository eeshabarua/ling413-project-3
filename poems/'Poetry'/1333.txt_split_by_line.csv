38,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
39,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
40,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Much is written about success and failure in the career of literature,"
41,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"about the reasons which enable one man to reach the front, and another to"
42,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"earn his livelihood, while a third, in appearance as likely as either of"
43,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"them, fails and, perhaps, faints by the way.  Mr. R. F. Murray, the"
44,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"author of _The Scarlet Gown_, was among those who do not attain success,"
45,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"in spite of qualities which seem destined to ensure it, and who fall out"
46,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of the ranks.  To him, indeed, success and the rewards of this world,"
47,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"money, and praise, did by no means seem things to be snatched at.  To him"
48,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,success meant earning by his pen the very modest sum which sufficed for
49,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his wants, and the leisure necessary for serious essays in poetry.  Fate"
50,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"denied him even this, in spite of his charming natural endowment of"
51,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"humour, of tenderness, of delight in good letters, and in nature.  He"
52,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"died young; he was one of those whose talent matures slowly, and he died"
53,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,before he came into the full possession of his intellectual kingdom.  He
54,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"had the ambition to excel, [Greek text], as the Homeric motto of his"
55,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"University runs, and he was on the way to excellence when his health"
56,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,broke down.  He lingered for two years and passed away.
57,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
58,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"It is a familiar story, the story of lettered youth; of an ambition, or"
59,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,rather of an ideal; of poverty; of struggles in the 'dusty and stony
60,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,ways'; of intellectual task-work; of a true love consoling the last
61,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,months of weakness and pain.  The tale is not repeated here because it is
62,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"novel, nor even because in its hero we have to regret an 'inheritor of"
63,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,unfulfilled renown.'  It is not the genius so much as the character of
64,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"this St. Andrews student which has won the sympathy of his biographer,"
65,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and may win, he hopes, the sympathy of others.  In Mr. Murray I feel that"
66,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"I have lost that rare thing, a friend; a friend whom the chances of life"
67,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"threw in my way, and withdrew again ere we had time and opportunity for"
68,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,perfect recognition.  Those who read his Letters and Remains may also
69,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,feel this emotion of sympathy and regret.
70,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
71,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"He was young in years, and younger in heart, a lover of youth; and youth,"
72,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"if it could learn and could be warned, might win a lesson from his life."
73,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Many of us have trod in his path, and, by some kindness of fate, have"
74,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,found from it a sunnier exit into longer days and more fortunate
75,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,conditions.  Others have followed this well-beaten road to the same early
76,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and quiet end as his.
77,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
78,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,The life and the letters of Murray remind one strongly of Thomas
79,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Davidson's, as published in that admirable and touching biography, _A"
80,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Scottish Probationer_.  It was my own chance to be almost in touch with
81,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"both these gentle, tuneful, and kindly humorists.  Davidson was a"
82,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Borderer, born on the skirts of 'stormy Ruberslaw,' in the country of"
83,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"James Thomson, of Leyden, of the old Ballad minstrels.  The son of a"
84,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Scottish peasant line of the old sort, honourable, refined, devout, he"
85,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,was educated in Edinburgh for the ministry of the United Presbyterian
86,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Church.  Some beautiful verses of his appeared in the _St. Andrews
87,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"University Magazine_ about 1863, at the time when I first 'saw myself in"
88,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,print' in the same periodical.  Davidson's poem delighted me: another of
89,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his, 'Ariadne in Naxos,' appeared in the _Cornhill Magazine_ about the"
90,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"same time.  Mr. Thackeray, who was then editor, no doubt remembered Pen's"
91,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,prize poem on the same subject.  I did not succeed in learning anything
92,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"about the author, did not know that he lived within a drive of my own"
93,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"home.  When next I heard of him, it was in his biography.  As a"
94,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'Probationer,' or unplaced minister, he, somehow, was not successful.  A"
95,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"humorist, a poet, a delightful companion, he never became 'a placed"
96,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"minister.'  It was the old story of an imprudence, a journey made in damp"
97,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"clothes, of consumption, of the end of his earthly life and love.  His"
98,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"letters to his betrothed, his poems, his career, constantly remind one of"
99,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Murray's, who must often have joined in singing Davidson's song, so"
100,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"popular with St. Andrews students, _The Banks of the Yang-tse-kiang_."
101,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Love of the Border, love of Murray's 'dear St. Andrews Bay,' love of"
102,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"letters, make one akin to both of these friends who were lost before"
103,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,their friendship was won.  Why did not Murray succeed to the measure of
104,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his most modest desire?  If we examine the records of literary success,"
105,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"we find it won, in the highest fields, by what, for want of a better"
106,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"word, we call genius; in the lower paths, by an energy which can take"
107,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"pleasure in all and every exercise of pen and ink, and can communicate"
108,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"its pleasure to others.  Now for Murray one does not venture, in face of"
109,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his still not wholly developed talent, and of his checked career, to"
110,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"claim genius.  He was not a Keats, a Burns, a Shelley: he was not, if one"
111,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"may choose modern examples, a Kipling or a Stevenson.  On the other hand,"
112,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his was a high ideal; he believed, with Andre Chenier, that he had"
113,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'something there,' something worthy of reverence and of careful training"
114,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"within him.  Consequently, as we shall see, the drudgery of the pressman"
115,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,was excessively repulsive to him.  He could take no delight in making the
116,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,best of it.  We learn that Mr. Kipling's early tales were written as part
117,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,of hard daily journalistic work in India; written in torrid newspaper
118,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"offices, to fill columns.  Yet they were written with the delight of the"
119,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"artist, and are masterpieces in their _genre_.  Murray could not make the"
120,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"best of ordinary pen-work in this manner.  Again, he was incapable of"
121,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'transactions,' of compromises; most honourably incapable of earning his"
122,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"bread by agreeing, or seeming to agree with opinions which were not his."
123,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,He could not endure (here I think he was wrong) to have his pieces of
124,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,light and mirthful verse touched in any way by an editor.  Even where no
125,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"opinions were concerned, even where an editor has (to my mind) a perfect"
126,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"right to alter anonymous contributions, Murray declined to be edited.  I"
127,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"ventured to remonstrate with him, to say _non est tanti_, but I spoke too"
128,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"late, or spoke in vain.  He carried independence too far, or carried it"
129,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"into the wrong field, for a piece of humorous verse, say in _Punch_, is"
130,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"not an original masterpiece and immaculate work of art, but more or less"
131,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of a joint-stock product between the editor, the author, and the public."
132,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Macaulay, and Carlyle, and Sir Walter Scott suffered editors gladly or"
133,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"with indifference, and who are we that we should complain?  This extreme"
134,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,sensitiveness would always have stood in Murray's way.
135,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
136,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Once more, Murray's interest in letters was much more energetic than his"
137,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"zeal in the ordinary industry of a student.  As a general rule, men of"
138,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,original literary bent are not exemplary students at college.  'The
139,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"common curricoolum,' as the Scottish laird called academic studies"
140,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"generally, rather repels them.  Macaulay took no honours at Cambridge;"
141,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"mathematics defied him.  Scott was 'the Greek dunce,' at Edinburgh."
142,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Thackeray, Shelley, Gibbon, did not cover themselves with college"
143,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"laurels; they read what pleased them, they did not read 'for the"
144,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"schools.'  In short, this behaviour at college is the rule among men who"
145,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"are to be distinguished in literature, not the exception.  The honours"
146,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"attained at Oxford by Mr. Swinburne, whose Greek verses are no less"
147,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"poetical than his English poetry, were inconspicuous.  At St. Andrews,"
148,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Murray read only 'for human pleasure,' like Scott, Thackeray, Shelley,"
149,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and the rest, at Edinburgh, Oxford, and Cambridge.  In this matter, I"
150,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"think, he made an error, and one which affected his whole career.  He was"
151,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"not a man of private fortune, like some of those whom we have mentioned."
152,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,He had not a business ready for him to step into.  He had to force his
153,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"own way in life, had to make himself 'self-supporting.'  This was all the"
154,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"more essential to a man of his honourable independence of character, a"
155,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"man who not only would not ask a favour, but who actually shrunk back"
156,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"from such chances as were offered to him, if these chances seemed to be"
157,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,connected with the least discernible shadow of an obligation.  At St.
158,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Andrews, had he chosen to work hard in certain branches of study, he"
159,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"might probably have gained an exhibition, gone to Oxford or elsewhere,"
160,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and, by winning a fellowship, secured the leisure which was necessary for"
161,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,the development of his powers.  I confess to believing in strenuous work
162,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"at the classics, as offering, apart from all material reward, the best"
163,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and most solid basis, especially where there is no exuberant original"
164,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"genius, for the career of a man of letters.  The mental discipline is"
165,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"invaluable, the training in accuracy is invaluable, and invaluable is the"
166,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"life led in the society of the greatest minds, the noblest poets, the"
167,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"most faultless artists of the world.  To descend to ordinary truths,"
168,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"scholarship is, at lowest, an honourable _gagne-pain_.  But Murray, like"
169,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the majority of students endowed with literary originality, did not share"
170,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,these rather old-fashioned ideas.  The clever Scottish student is apt to
171,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"work only too hard, and, perhaps, is frequently in danger of exhausting"
172,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his powers before they are mature, and of injuring his health before it"
173,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"is confirmed.  His ambitions, to lookers-on, may seem narrow and school-"
174,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"boyish, as if he were merely emulous, and eager for a high place in his"
175,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'class,' as lectures are called in Scotland.  This was Murray's own view,"
176,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and he certainly avoided the dangers of academic over-work.  He read
177,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"abundantly, but, as Fitzgerald says, he read 'for human pleasure.'  He"
178,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"never was a Greek scholar, he disliked Philosophy, as presented to him in"
179,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"class-work; the gods had made him poetical, not metaphysical."
180,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
181,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,There was one other cause of his lack of even such slender commercial
182,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,success in letters as was really necessary to a man who liked 'plain
183,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"living and high thinking.'  He fell early in love with a city, with a"
184,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"place--he lost his heart to St. Andrews.  Here, at all events, his critic"
185,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"can sympathise with him.  His 'dear St. Andrews Bay,' beautiful alike in"
186,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,winter mists and in the crystal days of still winter sunshine; the quiet
187,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,brown streets brightened by the scarlet gowns; the long limitless sands;
188,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the dark blue distant hills, and far-off snowy peaks of the Grampians;"
189,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the majestic melancholy towers, monuments of old religion overthrown; the"
190,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"deep dusky porch of the college chapel, with Kennedy's arms in wrought"
191,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,iron on the oaken door; the solid houses with their crow steps and
192,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"gables, all the forlorn memories of civil and religious feud, of"
193,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"inhabitants saintly, royal, heroic, endeared St. Andrews to Murray.  He"
194,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"could not say, like our other poet to Oxford, 'Farewell, dear city of"
195,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"youth and dream!'  His whole nature needed the air, 'like wine.'  He"
196,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"found, as he remarks, 'health and happiness in the German Ocean,'"
197,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,swimming out beyond the 'lake' where the witches were dipped; walking to
198,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the grey little coast-towns, with their wealth of historic documents,"
199,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,their ancient kirks and graves; dreaming in the vernal woods of Mount
200,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Melville or Strathtyrum; rambling (without a fishing-rod) in the charmed
201,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'dens' of the Kenley burn, a place like Tempe in miniature: these things"
202,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"were Murray's usual enjoyments, and they became his indispensable needs."
203,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"His peculiarly shy and, as it were, silvan nature, made it physically"
204,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,impossible for him to live in crowded streets and push his way through
205,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,throngs of indifferent men.  He could not live even in Edinburgh; he made
206,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the effort, and his health, at no time strong, seems never to have"
207,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,recovered from the effects of a few months spent under a roof in a large
208,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,town.  He hurried back to St. Andrews: her fascination was too powerful.
209,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Hence it is that, dying with his work scarcely begun, he will always be"
210,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"best remembered as the poet of _The Scarlet Gown_, the Calverley or J. K."
211,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"S. of Kilrymont; endowed with their humour, their skill in parody, their"
212,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"love of youth, but (if I am not prejudiced) with more than the tenderness"
213,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and natural magic of these regretted writers.  Not to be able to endure
214,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"crowds and towns, (a matter of physical health and constitution, as well"
215,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"as of temperament) was, of course, fatal to an ordinary success in"
216,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"journalism.  On the other hand, Murray's name is inseparably connected"
217,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"with the life of youth in the little old college, in the University of"
218,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the Admirable Crichton and Claverhouse, of the great Montrose and of"
219,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Ferguson,--the harmless Villon of Scotland,--the University of almost all"
220,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the famous Covenanters, and of all the valiant poet-Cavaliers.  Murray"
221,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"has sung of the life and pleasures of its students, of examinations and"
222,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"_Gaudeamuses_--supper parties--he has sung of the sands, the links, the"
223,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"sea, the towers, and his name and fame are for ever blended with the air"
224,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of his city of youth and dream.  It is not a wide name or a great fame,"
225,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"but it is what he would have desired, and we trust that it may be long-"
226,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"lived and enduring.  We are not to wax elegiac, and adopt a tearful tone"
227,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"over one so gallant and so uncomplaining.  He failed, but he was"
228,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,undefeated.
229,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
230,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,In the following sketch of Murray's life and work use is made of his
231,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"letters, chiefly of letters to his mother.  They always illustrate his"
232,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,own ideas and attempts; frequently they throw the light of an impartial
233,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and critical mind on the distinguished people whom Murray observed from
234,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"without.  It is worth remarking that among many remarks on persons, I"
235,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"have found not one of a censorious, cynical, envious, or unfriendly"
236,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,nature.  Youth is often captious and keenly critical; partly because
237,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"youth generally has an ideal, partly, perhaps chiefly, from mere"
238,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,intellectual high spirits and sense of the incongruous; occasionally the
239,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"motive is jealousy or spite.  Murray's sense of fun was keen, his ideal"
240,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"was lofty; of envy, of an injured sense of being neglected, he does not"
241,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"show one trace.  To make fun of their masters and pastors, tutors,"
242,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"professors, is the general and not necessarily unkind tendency of pupils."
243,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Murray rarely mentions any of the professors in St. Andrews except in
244,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"terms of praise, which is often enthusiastic.  Now, as he was by no means"
245,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"a prize student, or pattern young man for a story-book, this generosity"
246,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,is a high proof of an admirable nature.  If he chances to speak to his
247,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"mother about a bore, and he did not suffer bores gladly, he not only does"
248,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"not name the person, but gives no hint by which he might be identified."
249,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"He had much to embitter him, for he had a keen consciousness of 'the"
250,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"something within him,' of the powers which never found full expression;"
251,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and he saw others advancing and prospering while he seemed to be standing
252,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"still, or losing ground in all ways.  But no word of bitterness ever"
253,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,escapes him in the correspondence which I have seen.  In one case he has
254,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,to speak of a disagreeable and disappointing interview with a man from
255,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,whom he had been led to expect sympathy and encouragement.  He told me
256,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,about this affair in conversation; 'There were tears in my eyes as I
257,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"turned from the house,' he said, and he was not effusive.  In a letter to"
258,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Mrs. Murray he describes this unlucky interview,--a discouragement caused"
259,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"by a manner which was strange to Murray, rather than by real"
260,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"unkindness,--and he describes it with a delicacy, with a reserve, with a"
261,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"toleration, beyond all praise.  These are traits of a character which was"
262,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,greater and more rare than his literary talent: a character quite
263,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"developed, while his talent was only beginning to unfold itself, and to"
264,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,justify his belief in his powers.
265,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
266,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Robert Murray was the eldest child of John and Emmeline Murray: the
267,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"father a Scot, the mother of American birth.  He was born at Roxbury, in"
268,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Massachusetts, on December 26th, 1863.  It may be fancy, but, in his shy"
269,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"reserve, his almost _farouche_ independence, one seems to recognise the"
270,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Scot; while in his cast of literary talent, in his natural 'culture,' we"
271,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,observe the son of a refined American lady.  To his mother he could
272,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"always write about the books which were interesting him, with full"
273,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"reliance on her sympathy, though indeed, he does not often say very much"
274,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,about literature.
275,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
276,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Till 1869 he lived in various parts of New England, his father being a"
277,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Unitarian minister.  'He was a remarkably cheerful and affectionate
278,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"child, and seldom seemed to find anything to trouble him.'  In 1869 his"
279,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"father carried him to England, Mrs. Murray and a child remaining in"
280,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"America.  For more than a year the boy lived with kinsfolk near Kelso,"
281,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,the beautiful old town on the Tweed where Scott passed some of his
282,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"childish days.  In 1871 the family were reunited at York, where he was"
283,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,fond of attending the services in the Cathedral.  Mr. Murray then took
284,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"charge of the small Unitarian chapel of Blackfriars, at Canterbury.  Thus"
285,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Murray's early youth was passed in the mingled influences of Unitarianism
286,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"at home, and of Cathedral services at York, and in the church where"
287,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Becket suffered martyrdom.  A not unnatural result was a somewhat
288,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,eclectic and unconstrained religion.  He thought but little of the
289,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"differences of creed, believing that all good men held, in essentials,"
290,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"much the same faith.  His view of essentials was generous, as he"
291,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"admitted.  He occasionally spoke of himself as 'sceptical,' that is, in"
292,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"contrast with those whose faith was more definite, more dogmatic, more"
293,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"securely based on 'articles.'  To illustrate Murray's religious attitude,"
294,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"at least as it was in 1887, one may quote from a letter of that year"
295,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,(April 17).
296,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
297,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'There was a University sermon, and I thought I would go and hear it."
298,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,So I donned my old cap and gown and felt quite proud of them.  The
299,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,preacher was Bishop Wordsworth.  He goes in for the union of the
300,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Presbyterian and Episcopalian Churches, and is glad to preach in a"
301,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Presbyterian Church, as he did this morning.  How the aforesaid Union"
302,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"is to be brought about, I'm sure I don't know, for I am pretty certain"
303,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"that the Episcopalians won't give up their bishops, and the"
304,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Presbyterians won't have them on any account.  However, that's neither"
305,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,here nor there--at least it does not affect the fact that Wordsworth
306,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"is a first-rate man, and a fine preacher.  I dare say you know he is a"
307,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"nephew or grand-nephew of the Poet.  He is a most venerable old man,"
308,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and worth looking at, merely for his exterior.  He is so feeble with"
309,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,age that he can with difficulty climb the three short steps that lead
310,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"into the pulpit; but, once in the pulpit, it is another thing.  There"
311,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,is no feebleness when he begins to preach.  He is one of the last
312,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"voices of the old orthodox school, and I wish there were hundreds like"
313,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"him.  If ever a man believed in his message, Wordsworth does.  And"
314,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,though I cannot follow him in his veneration for the Thirty-nine
315,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Articles, the way in which he does makes me half wish I could. . . ."
316,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"It was full of wisdom and the beauty of holiness, which even I, poor"
317,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"sceptic and outcast, could recognise and appreciate.  After all, he"
318,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"didn't get it from the Articles, but from his own human heart, which,"
319,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"he told us, was deceitful and desperately wicked."
320,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
321,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'Confound it, how stupid we all are!  Episcopalians, Presbyterians,"
322,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Unitarians, Agnostics; the whole lot of us.  We all believe the same"
323,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"things, to a great extent; but we must keep wrangling about the data"
324,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,from which we infer these beliefs . . . I believe a great deal that he
325,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"does, but I certainly don't act up to my belief as he does to his.'"
326,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
327,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"The belief 'up to' which Murray lived was, if it may be judged by its"
328,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"fruits, that of a Christian man.  But, in this age, we do find the most"
329,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,exemplary Christian conduct in some who have discarded dogma and resigned
330,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,hope.  Probably Murray would not the less have regarded these persons as
331,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Christians.  If we must make a choice, it is better to have love and"
332,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"charity without belief, than belief of the most intense kind, accompanied"
333,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,by such love and charity as John Knox bore to all who differed from him
334,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"about a mass or a chasuble, a priest or a presbyter.  This letter,"
335,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"illustrative of the effect of cathedral services on a young Unitarian, is"
336,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,taken out of its proper chronological place.
337,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
338,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,From Canterbury Mr. Murray went to Ilminster in Somerset.  Here Robert
339,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,attended the Grammar School; in 1879 he went to the Grammar School of
340,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Crewkerne.  In 1881 he entered at the University of St. Andrews, with a"
341,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,scholarship won as an external student of Manchester New College.  This
342,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"he resigned not long after, as he had abandoned the idea of becoming a"
343,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Unitarian minister.
344,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
345,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"No longer a schoolboy, he was now a _Bejant_ (_bec jaune_?), to use the"
346,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"old Scotch term for 'freshman.'  He liked the picturesque word, and"
347,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"opposed the introduction of 'freshman.'  Indeed he liked all things old,"
348,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"and, as a senior man, was a supporter of ancient customs and of _esprit"
349,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,de corps_ in college.  He fell in love for life with that old and grey
350,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"enchantress, the city of St. Margaret, of Cardinal Beaton, of Knox and"
351,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Andrew Melville, of Archbishop Sharp, and Samuel Rutherford.  The nature"
352,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of life and education in a Scottish university is now, probably, better"
353,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"understood in England than it used to be.  Of the Scottish universities,"
354,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"St. Andrews varies least, though it varies much, from Oxford and"
355,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Cambridge.  Unlike the others, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, the"
356,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,United College of St. Leonard and St. Salvator is not lost in a large
357,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,town.  The College and the Divinity Hall of St. Mary's are a survival
358,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,from the Middle Ages.  The University itself arose from a voluntary
359,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,association of the learned in 1410.  Privileges were conferred on this
360,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,association by Bishop Wardlaw in 1411.  It was intended as a bulwark
361,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"against Lollard ideas.  In 1413 the Antipope Benedict XIII., to whom"
362,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Scotland then adhered, granted six bulls of confirmation to the new"
363,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,University.  Not till 1430 did Bishop Wardlaw give a building in South
364,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Street, the Paedagogium.  St. Salvator's College was founded by Bishop"
365,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Kennedy (1440-1466): it was confirmed by Pius II. in 1458.  Kennedy
366,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,endowed his foundation richly with plate (a silver mace is still extant)
367,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,and with gorgeous furniture and cloth of gold.  St. Leonard's was founded
368,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,by Prior Hepburn in 1512.  Of St. Salvator's the ancient chapel still
369,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"remains, and is in use.  St. Leonard's was merged with St. Salvator's in"
370,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the last century: its chapel is now roofless, some of the old buildings"
371,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"remain, much modernised, but on the south side fronting the gardens they"
372,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"are still picturesque.  Both Colleges were, originally, places of"
373,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"residence for the students, as at Oxford and Cambridge, and the"
374,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"discipline, especially at St. Leonard's, was rather monastic.  The"
375,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Reformation caused violent changes; all through these troubled ages the
376,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"new doctrines, and then the violent Presbyterian pretensions to clerical"
377,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"influence in politics, and the Covenant and the Restoration and"
378,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Revolution, kept busy the dwellers in what should have been 'quiet"
379,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"collegiate cloisters.'  St. Leonard's was more extreme, on Knox's side,"
380,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"than St. Salvator's, but was also more devoted to King James in 1715."
381,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,From St. Andrews Simon Lovat went to lead his abominable old father's
382,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"clan, on the Prince Regent's side, in 1745.  Golf and archery, since the"
383,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Reformation at least, were the chief recreations of the students, and the"
384,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"archery medals bear all the noblest names of the North, including those"
385,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,of Argyll and the great Marquis of Montrose.  Early in the present
386,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,century the old ruinous college buildings of St. Salvator's ceased to be
387,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"habitable, except by a ghost!  There is another spectre of a noisy sort"
388,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"in St. Leonard's.  The new buildings are mere sets of class-rooms, the"
389,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"students live where they please, generally in lodgings, which they"
390,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,modestly call _bunks_.  There is a hall for dinners in common; it is part
391,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of the buildings of the Union, a new hall added to an ancient house."
392,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
393,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"It was thus to a university with ancient associations, with a _religio"
394,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"loci_, and with more united and harmonious student-life than is customary"
395,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"in Scotland, that Murray came in 1881.  How clearly his biographer"
396,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"remembers coming to the same place, twenty years earlier! how vivid is"
397,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"his memory of quaint streets, grey towers, and the North Sea breaking in"
398,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,heavy rollers on the little pier!
399,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
400,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Though, like a descendant of Archbishop Sharp, and a winner of the"
401,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"archery medal, I boast myself _Sancti Leonardi alumnus addictissimus_, I"
402,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"am unable to give a description, at first hand, of student life in St."
403,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Andrews.  In my time, a small set of 'men' lived together in what was"
404,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,then St. Leonard's Hall.  The buildings that remain on the site of Prior
405,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Hepburn's foundation, or some of them, were turned into a hall, where we"
406,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"lived together, not scattered in _bunks_.  The existence was mainly like"
407,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,that of pupils of a private tutor; seven-eighths of private tutor to one-
408,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,eighth of a college in the English universities.  We attended the
409,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"lectures in the University, we distinguished ourselves no more than"
410,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Murray would have approved of, and many of us have remained united by"
411,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,friendship through half a lifetime.
412,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,
413,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"It was a pleasant existence, and the perfume of buds and flowers in the"
414,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"old gardens, hard by those where John Knox sat and talked with James"
415,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"Melville and our other predecessors at St. Leonard's, is fragrant in our"
416,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"memories.  It was pleasant, but St. Leonard's Hall has ceased to be, and"
417,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,the life there was not the life of the free and hardy bunk-dwellers.
418,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Whoso pined for such dissipated pleasures as the chill and dark streets
419,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"of St. Andrews offer to the gay and rousing blade, was not encouraged.  We"
420,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"were very strictly 'gated,' though the whole society once got out of"
421,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"window, and, by way of protest, made a moonlight march into the country."
422,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,We attended 'gaudeamuses' and _solatia_--University suppers--but little;
423,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"indeed, he who writes does not remember any such diversions of boys who"
424,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"beat the floor, and break the glass.  To plant the standard of cricket in"
425,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the remoter gardens of our country, in a region devastated by golf, was"
426,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"our ambition, and here we had no assistance at all from the University."
427,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"It was chiefly at lecture, at football on the links, and in the debating"
428,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"societies that we met our fellow-students; like the celebrated starling,"
429,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"'we could not get out,' except to permitted dinners and evening parties."
430,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,Consequently one could only sketch student life with a hand faltering and
431,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,untrained.  It was very different with Murray and his friends.  They were
432,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"their own masters, could sit up to all hours, smoking, talking, and, I"
433,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"dare say, drinking.  As I gather from his letters, Murray drank nothing"
434,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"stronger than water.  There was a certain kind of humour in drink, he"
435,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"said, but he thought it was chiefly obvious to the sober spectator.  As"
436,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,"the sober spectator, he sang of violent delights which have violent ends."
437,R. F. MURRAY--1863-1893,He may best be left to illustrate student life for himself.  The 'waster'

569,A DECEMBER DAY,
570,A DECEMBER DAY,"'I have _not_ worked for my classes this session,' he writes (1884), 'and"
571,A DECEMBER DAY,shall not take any places.'  The five or six most distinguished pupils
572,A DECEMBER DAY,"used, at least in my time, to receive prize-books decorated with the"
573,A DECEMBER DAY,"University's arms.  These prize-men, no doubt, held the 'places' alluded"
574,A DECEMBER DAY,"to by Murray.  If _he_ was idle, 'I speak of him but brotherly,' having"
575,A DECEMBER DAY,"never held any 'place' but that of second to Mr. Wallace, now Professor"
576,A DECEMBER DAY,"of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, in the Greek Class (Mr. Sellar's).  Why"
577,A DECEMBER DAY,"was one so idle, in Latin (Mr. Shairp), in Morals (Mr. Ferrier), in Logic"
578,A DECEMBER DAY,(Mr. Veitch)? but Logic was unintelligible.
579,A DECEMBER DAY,
580,A DECEMBER DAY,"'I must confess,' remarks Murray, in a similar spirit of pensive regret,"
581,A DECEMBER DAY,'that I have not had any ambition to distinguish myself either in
582,A DECEMBER DAY,Knight's (Moral Philosophy) or in Butler's.' {1}
583,A DECEMBER DAY,
584,A DECEMBER DAY,"Murray then speaks with some acrimony about earnest students, whose"
585,A DECEMBER DAY,"motive, he thinks, is a small ambition.  But surely a man may be fond of"
586,A DECEMBER DAY,"metaphysics for the sweet sake of Queen Entelechy, and, moreover, these"
587,A DECEMBER DAY,students looked forward to days in which real work would bear fruit.
588,A DECEMBER DAY,
589,A DECEMBER DAY,"'You must grind up the opinions of Plato, Aristotle, and a lot of other"
590,A DECEMBER DAY,"men, concerning things about which they knew nothing, and we know"
591,A DECEMBER DAY,"nothing, taking these opinions at second or third hand, and never looking"
592,A DECEMBER DAY,"into the works of these men; for to a man who wants to take a place,"
593,A DECEMBER DAY,there is no time for anything of that sort.'
594,A DECEMBER DAY,
595,A DECEMBER DAY,"Why not?  The philosophers ought to be read in their own language, as"
596,A DECEMBER DAY,they are now read.  The remarks on the most fairy of philosophers--Plato;
597,A DECEMBER DAY,"on the greatest of all minds, that of Aristotle, are boyish.  Again 'I"
598,A DECEMBER DAY,"speak but brotherly,' remembering an old St. Leonard's essay in which"
599,A DECEMBER DAY,"Virgil was called 'the furtive Mantuan,' and another, devoted to ridicule"
600,A DECEMBER DAY,of Euripides.  But Plato and Aristotle we never blasphemed.
601,A DECEMBER DAY,
602,A DECEMBER DAY,"Murray adds that he thinks, next year, of taking the highest Greek Class,"
603,A DECEMBER DAY,"and English Literature.  In the latter, under Mr. Baynes, he took the"
604,A DECEMBER DAY,"first place, which he mentions casually to Mrs. Murray about a year after"
605,A DECEMBER DAY,date:--
606,A DECEMBER DAY,
607,A DECEMBER DAY,'A sweet life and an idle
608,A DECEMBER DAY,"He lives from year to year,"
609,A DECEMBER DAY,"Unknowing bit or bridle,"
610,A DECEMBER DAY,There are no Proctors here.'
611,A DECEMBER DAY,
612,A DECEMBER DAY,"In Greek, despite his enthusiastic admiration of the professor, Mr."
613,A DECEMBER DAY,"Campbell, he did not much enjoy himself:--"
614,A DECEMBER DAY,
615,A DECEMBER DAY,'Thrice happy are those
616,A DECEMBER DAY,Who ne'er heard of Greek Prose--
617,A DECEMBER DAY,"Or Greek Poetry either, as far as that goes;"
618,A DECEMBER DAY,For Liddell and Scott
619,A DECEMBER DAY,"Shall cumber them not,"
620,A DECEMBER DAY,Nor Sargent nor Sidgwick shall break their repose.
621,A DECEMBER DAY,
622,A DECEMBER DAY,"But I, late at night,"
623,A DECEMBER DAY,By the very bad light
624,A DECEMBER DAY,"Of very bad gas, must painfully write"
625,A DECEMBER DAY,Some stuff that a Greek
626,A DECEMBER DAY,With his delicate cheek
627,A DECEMBER DAY,"Would smile at as 'barbarous'--faith, he well might."
628,A DECEMBER DAY,
629,A DECEMBER DAY,* * * * *
630,A DECEMBER DAY,
631,A DECEMBER DAY,"So away with Greek Prose,"
632,A DECEMBER DAY,The source of my woes!
633,A DECEMBER DAY,"(This metre's too tough, I must draw to a close.)"
634,A DECEMBER DAY,May Sargent be drowned
635,A DECEMBER DAY,"In the ocean profound,"
636,A DECEMBER DAY,And Sidgwick be food for the carrion crows!'
637,A DECEMBER DAY,
638,A DECEMBER DAY,"Greek prose is a stubborn thing, and the biographer remembers being told"
639,A DECEMBER DAY,"that his was 'the best, with the worst mistakes'; also frequently by Mr."
640,A DECEMBER DAY,"Sellar, that it was 'bald.'  But Greek prose is splendid practice, and no"
641,A DECEMBER DAY,"less good practice is Greek and Latin verse.  These exercises, so much"
642,A DECEMBER DAY,"sneered at, are the Dwellers on the Threshold of the life of letters."
643,A DECEMBER DAY,"They are haunting forms of fear, but they have to be wrestled with, like"
644,A DECEMBER DAY,"the Angel (to change the figure), till they bless you, and make words"
645,A DECEMBER DAY,"become, in your hands, like the clay of the modeller.  Could we write"
646,A DECEMBER DAY,"Greek like Mr. Jebb, we would never write anything else."
647,A DECEMBER DAY,
648,A DECEMBER DAY,"Murray had naturally, it seems, certainly not by dint of wrestling with"
649,A DECEMBER DAY,"Greek prose, the mastery of language.  His light verse is wonderfully"
650,A DECEMBER DAY,"handled, quaint, fluent, right.  Modest as he was, he was ambitious, as"
651,A DECEMBER DAY,"we said, but not ambitious of any gain; merely eager, in his own way, to"
652,A DECEMBER DAY,excel.  His ideal is plainly stated in the following verses:--

686,[GREEK TITLE],Murray was never a great athlete: his ambition did not lead him to desire

741,IMITATED FROM WORDSWORTH,"sea, where, some say, the murdered Cardinal may now and again be seen, in"
742,IMITATED FROM WORDSWORTH,his red hat.  In South Street he hears the roll and rattle of the
743,IMITATED FROM WORDSWORTH,viewless carriage which sounds in that thoroughfare.  He loiters under
744,IMITATED FROM WORDSWORTH,"the haunted tower on Hepburn's precinct wall, the tower where the lady of"

837,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"a proper name) 'against Lowell, on the score of his being an alien."
838,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Mallock, as you learn, was withdrawn, for which I am truly thankful.'"
839,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Unlucky Mr. Mallock!  'Lowell polled 100 and Gibson 92 . . . The
840,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,intrigues and corruption appear to be almost worthy of an American
841,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Presidential election.'  Mr. Lowell could not accept a compliment which
842,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"pleased him, because of his official position, and the misfortune of his"
843,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,birth!
844,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
845,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray was already doing a very little 'miniature journalism,' in the"
846,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,form of University Notes for a local paper.  He complains of the ultra
847,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Caledonian frankness with which men told him that they were very bad.  A
848,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"needless, if friendly, outspokenness was a feature in Scottish character"
849,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,which he did not easily endure.  He wrote a good deal of verse in the
850,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"little University paper, now called _College Echoes_."
851,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
852,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,If Murray ever had any definite idea of being ordained for the ministry
853,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"in any 'denomination,' he abandoned it.  His 'bursaries' (scholarships or"
854,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"exhibitions), on which he had been passing rich, expired, and he had to"
855,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,earn a livelihood.  It seems plain to myself that he might easily have
856,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,done so with his pen.  A young friend of my own (who will excuse me for
857,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,thinking that his bright verses are not _better_ than Murray's) promptly
858,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"made, by these alone, an income which to Murray would have been"
859,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"affluence.  But this could not be done at St. Andrews.  Again, Murray was"
860,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,not in contact with people in the centre of newspapers and magazines.  He
861,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"went very little into general society, even at St. Andrews, and thus"
862,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"failed, perhaps, to make acquaintances who might have been 'useful.'  He"
863,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,would have scorned the idea of making useful acquaintances.  But without
864,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"seeking them, why should we reject any friendliness when it offers"
865,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,itself?  We are all members one of another.  Murray speaks of his
866,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"experience of human beings, as rich in examples of kindness and"
867,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"good-will.  His shyness, his reserve, his extreme unselfishness,--carried"
868,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"to the point of diffidence,--made him rather shun than seek older people"
869,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"who were dangerously likely to be serviceable.  His manner, when once he"
870,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"could be induced to meet strangers, was extremely frank and pleasant, but"
871,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"from meeting strangers he shrunk, in his inveterate modesty."
872,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
873,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"In 1886 Murray had the misfortune to lose is father, and it became,"
874,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"perhaps, more prominently needful that he should find a profession.  He"
875,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,now assisted Professor Meiklejohn of St. Andrews in various kinds of
876,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"literary and academic work, and in him found a friend, with whom he"
877,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"remained in close intercourse to the last.  He began the weary path,"
878,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"which all literary beginners must tread, of sending contributions to"
879,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,magazines.  He seldom read magazine articles.  'I do not greatly care for
880,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"""Problems"" and ""vexed questions.""  I am so much of a problem and a vexed"
881,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,question that I have quite enough to do in searching for a solution of my
882,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"own personality.'  He tried a story, based on 'a midnight experience' of"
883,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,his own; unluckily he does not tell us what that experience was.  Had he
884,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,encountered one of the local ghosts?
885,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
886,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,'My blood-curdling romance I offered to the editor of _Longman's
887,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Magazine_, but that misguided person was so ill-advised as to return it,"
888,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,accompanied with one of these abominable lithographed forms conveying his
889,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,hypocritical regrets.'  Murray sent a directed envelope with a twopenny-
890,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,halfpenny stamp.  The paper came back for three-halfpence by book-post.
891,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,'I have serious thoughts of sueing him for the odd penny!'  'Why should
892,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,people be fools enough to read my rot when they have twenty volumes of
893,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Scott at their command?'  He confesses to 'a Scott-mania almost as
894,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,intense as if he were the last new sensation.'  'I was always fond of
895,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"him, but I am fonder than ever now.'  This plunge into the immortal"
896,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,romances seems really to have discouraged Murray; at all events he says
897,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,very little more about attempts in fiction of his own.  'I am a barren
898,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"rascal,' he writes, quoting Johnson on Fielding.  Like other men, Murray"
899,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,felt extreme difficulty in writing articles or tales which have an
900,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,infinitesimal chance of being accepted.  It needs a stout heart to face
901,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,this almost fixed certainty of rejection: a man is weakened by his
902,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"apprehensions of a lithographed form, and of his old manuscript coming"
903,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"home to roost, like the Graces of Theocritus, to pine in the dusty chest"
904,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,where is their chill abode.  If the Alexandrian poets knew this
905,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"ill-fortune, so do all beginners in letters.  There is nothing for it but"
906,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"'putting a stout heart to a stey brae,' as the Scotch proverb says."
907,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Editors want good work, and on finding a new man who is good, they"
908,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,greatly rejoice.  But it is so difficult to do vigorous and spontaneous
909,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"work, as it were, in the dark.  Murray had not, it is probable, the"
910,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"qualities of the novelist, the narrator.  An excellent critic he might"
911,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"have been if he had 'descended to criticism,' but he had, at this time,"
912,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"no introductions, and probably did not address reviews at random to"
913,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"editors.  As to poetry, these much-vexed men receive such enormous"
914,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"quantities of poetry that they usually reject it at a venture, and obtain"
915,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,the small necessary supplies from agreeable young ladies.  Had Murray
916,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"been in London, with a few literary friends, he might soon have been a"
917,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,thriving writer of light prose and light verse.  But the enchantress held
918,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"him; he hated London, he had no literary friends, he could write gaily"
919,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"for pleasure, not for gain.  So, like the Scholar Gypsy, he remained"
920,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"contemplative,"
921,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
922,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,'Waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.'
923,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
924,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,About this time the present writer was in St. Andrews as Gifford Lecturer
925,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"in Natural Theology.  To say that an enthusiasm for totems and taboos,"
926,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"ghosts and gods of savage men, was aroused by these lectures, would be to"
927,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,exaggerate unpardonably.  Efforts to make the students write essays or
928,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,ask questions were so entire a failure that only one question was
929,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,received--as to the proper pronunciation of 'Myth.'  Had one been
930,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"fortunate enough to interest Murray, it must have led to some discussion"
931,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,of his literary attempts.  He mentions having attended a lecture given by
932,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"myself to the Literary Society on 'Literature as a Profession,' and he"
933,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,found the lecturer 'far more at home in such a subject than in the
934,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Gifford Lectures.'  Possibly the hearer was 'more at home' in literature
935,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"than in discussions as to the origin of Huitzilopochtli.  'Literature,'"
936,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"he says, 'never was, is not, and never will be, in the ordinary sense of"
937,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the term, a profession.  You can't teach it as you can the professions,"
938,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"you can't succeed in it as you can in the professions, by dint of mere"
939,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,diligence and without special aptitude . . . I think all this chatter
940,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,about the technical and pecuniary sides of literature is extremely
941,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,foolish and worse than useless.  It only serves to glut the idle
942,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,curiosity of the general public about matters with which they have no
943,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"concern, a curiosity which (thanks partly to American methods of"
944,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,journalism) has become simply outrageous.'
945,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
946,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Into chatter about the pecuniary aspect of literature the Lecturer need
947,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,hardly say that he did not meander.  It is absolutely true that
948,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,literature cannot be taught.  Maupassant could have dispensed with the
949,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,instructions of Flaubert.  But an 'aptitude' is needed in all
950,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"professions, and in such arts as music, and painting, and sculpture,"
951,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"teaching is necessary.  In literature, teaching can only come from"
952,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"general education in letters, from experience, from friendly private"
953,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,criticism.  But if you cannot succeed in literature 'by dint of mere
954,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"diligence,' mere diligence is absolutely essential.  Men must read, must"
955,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"observe, must practise.  Diligence is as necessary to the author as to"
956,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the grocer, the solicitor, the dentist, the barrister, the soldier."
957,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Nothing but nature can give the aptitude; diligence must improve it, and"
958,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,experience may direct it.  It is not enough to wait for the spark from
959,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"heaven to fall; the spark must be caught, and tended, and cherished.  A"
960,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"man must labour till he finds his vein, and himself.  Again, if"
961,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"literature is an art, it is also a profession.  A man's very first duty"
962,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"is to support himself and those, if any, who are dependent on him.  If he"
963,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"cannot do it by epics, tragedies, lyrics, he must do it by articles,"
964,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"essays, tales, or how he honestly can.  He must win his leisure by his"
965,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"labour, and give his leisure to his art.  Murray, at this time, was"
966,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"diligent in helping to compile and correct educational works.  He might,"
967,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"but for the various conditions of reserve, hatred of towns, and the rest,"
968,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,have been earning his leisure by work more brilliant and more congenial
969,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,to most men.  But his theory of literature was so lofty that he probably
970,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"found the other, the harder, the less remunerative, the less attractive"
971,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"work, more congenial to his tastes."
972,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
973,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"He describes, to Mrs. Murray, various notable visitors to St. Andrews:"
974,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Professor Butcher, who lectured on Lucian, and is 'very handsome,' Mr."
975,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Arthur Balfour, the Lord Rector, who is 'rather handsome,' and delights"
976,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the listener by his eloquence; Mr. Chamberlain, who pleases him too,"
977,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,though he finds Mr. Chamberlain rather acrimonious in his political
978,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"reflections.  About Lucian, the subject of Mr. Butcher's lecture, Murray"
979,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"says nothing.  That brilliant man of letters in general, the Alcibiades"
980,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of literature, the wittiest, and, rarely, the most tender, and, always,"
981,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the most graceful, was a model who does not seem to have attracted"
982,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray.  Lucian amused, and amuses, and lived by amusing: the vein of"
983,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,romance and poetry that was his he worked but rarely: perhaps the
984,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Samosatene did not take himself too seriously, yet he lives through the"
985,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"ages, an example, in many ways to be followed, of a man who obviously"
986,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"delighted in all that he wrought.  He was no model to Murray, who only"
987,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"delighted in his moments of inspiration, and could not make himself happy"
988,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,even in the trifles which are demanded from the professional pen.
989,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
990,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"He did, at last, endeavour to ply that servile engine of which Pendennis"
991,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,conceived so exalted an opinion.  Certainly a false pride did not stand
992,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"in his way when, on May 5, 1889, he announced that he was about to leave"
993,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"St. Andrews, and attempt to get work at proof-correcting and in the"
994,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,humblest sorts of journalism in Edinburgh.  The chapter is honourable to
995,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"his resolution, but most melancholy.  There were competence and ease"
996,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"waiting for him, probably, in London, if he would but let his pen have"
997,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,its way in bright comment and occasional verse.  But he chose the other
998,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"course.  With letters of introduction from Mr. Meiklejohn, he consulted"
999,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,the houses of Messrs. Clark and Messrs. Constable in Edinburgh.  He did
1000,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,not find that his knowledge of Greek was adequate to the higher and more
1001,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"remunerative branches of proof-reading, that weary meticulous toil, so"
1002,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"fatiguing to the eyesight.  The hours, too, were very long; he could do"
1003,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"more and better work in fewer hours.  No time, no strength, were left for"
1004,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"reading and writing.  He did, while in Edinburgh, send a few things to"
1005,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"magazines, but he did not actually 'bombard' editors.  He is 'to live in"
1006,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"one room, and dine, if not on a red herring, on the next cheapest article"
1007,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of diet.'  These months of privation, at which he laughed, and some weeks"
1008,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of reading proofs, appear to have quite undermined health which was never"
1009,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"strong, and which had been sorely tried by 'the wind of a cursed to-day,"
1010,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the curse of a windy to-morrow,' at St. Andrews.  If a reader observes in"
1011,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray a lack of strenuous diligence, he must attribute it less to lack"
1012,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of resolution, than to defect of physical force and energy.  The many bad"
1013,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"colds of which he speaks were warnings of the end, which came in the form"
1014,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of consumption.  This lurking malady it was that made him wait, and dally"
1015,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,with his talent.  He hit on the idea of translating some of Bossuet's
1016,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,orations for a Scotch theological publisher.  Alas! the publisher did not
1017,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"anticipate a demand, among Scotch ministers, for the Eagle of Meaux."
1018,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray, in his innocence, was startled by the caution of the publisher,"
1019,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"who certainly would have been a heavy loser.  'I honestly believe that,"
1020,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"if Charles Dickens were now alive and unknown, and were to offer the MS."
1021,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of _Pickwick_ to an Edinburgh publisher, that sagacious old individual"
1022,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"would shake his prudent old head, and refuse (with the utmost politeness)"
1023,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,to publish it!'  There is a good deal of difference between _Pickwick_
1024,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"and a translation of old French sermons about Madame, and Conde, and"
1025,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,people of whom few modern readers ever heard.
1026,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1027,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Alone, in Edinburgh, Murray was saddened by the 'unregarding'"
1028,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,irresponsive faces of the people as they passed.  In St. Andrews he
1029,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,probably knew every face; even in Edinburgh (a visitor from London
1030,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,thinks) there is a friendly look among the passers.  Murray did not find
1031,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,it so.  He approached a newspaper office: 'he [the Editor whom he met]
1032,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"was extremely frank, and told me that the tone of my article on--was"
1033,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"underbred, while the verses I had sent him had nothing in them.  Very"
1034,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"pleasant for the feelings of a young author, was it not? . . ."
1035,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Unfavourable criticism is an excellent tonic, but it should be a little"
1036,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"diluted . . . I must, however, do him the justice to say that he did me a"
1037,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"good turn by introducing me to ---, . . . who was kind and encouraging in"
1038,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,the extreme.'
1039,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1040,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray now called on the Editor of the _Scottish Leader_, the Gladstonian"
1041,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"organ, whom he found very courteous.  He was asked to write some 'leader-"
1042,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"notes' as they are called, paragraphs which appear in the same columns as"
1043,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"the leading articles.  These were published, to his astonishment, and he"
1044,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,was 'to be taken on at a salary of--a week.'  Let us avoid pecuniary
1045,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"chatter, and merely say that the sum, while he was on trial, was not"
1046,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,likely to tempt many young men into the career of journalism.  Yet 'the
1047,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"work will be very exacting, and almost preclude the possibility of my"
1048,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"doing anything else.'  Now, as four leader notes, or, say, six, can be"
1049,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"written in an hour, it is difficult to see the necessity for this"
1050,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"fatigue.  Probably there were many duties more exacting, and less"
1051,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"agreeable, than the turning out of epigrams.  Indeed there was other work"
1052,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of some more or less mechanical kind, and the manufacture of 'leader"
1053,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,notes' was the least part of Murray's industry.  At the end of two years
1054,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,there was 'the prospect of a very fair salary.'  But there was 'night-
1055,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,work and everlasting hurry.'  'The interviewing of a half-bred
1056,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Town-Councillor on the subject of gas and paving' did not exhilarate
1057,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray.  Again, he had to compile a column of Literary News, from the"
1058,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"_Athenaeum_, the _Academy_, and so on, 'with comments and enlargements"
1059,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"where possible.'  This might have been made extremely amusing, it sounds"
1060,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"like a delightful task,--the making of comments on 'Mr. --- has finished"
1061,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,a sonnet:' 'Mr. ---'s poems are in their fiftieth thousand:' 'Miss ---
1062,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,has gone on a tour of health to the banks of the Yang-tse-kiang:' 'Mrs.
1063,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,--- is engaged on a novel about the Pilchard Fishery.'  One could make
1064,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"comments (if permitted) on these topics for love, and they might not be"
1065,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"unpopular.  But perhaps Murray was shackled a little by human respect, or"
1066,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,the prejudices of his editor.  At all events he calls it 'not very
1067,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"inspiring employment.'  The bare idea, I confess, inspirits me extremely."
1068,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1069,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"But the literary _follet_, who delights in mild mischief, did not haunt"
1070,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Murray.  He found an opportunity to write on the Canongate Churchyard,"
1071,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"where Fergusson lies, under the monument erected by Burns to the boy of"
1072,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,genius whom he called his master.  Of course the part of the article
1073,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"which dealt with Fergusson, himself a poet of the Scarlet Gown, was cut"
1074,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"out.  The Scotch do not care to hear about Fergusson, in spite of their"
1075,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,'myriad mutchkined enthusiasm' for his more illustrious imitator and
1076,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"successor, Burns."
1077,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1078,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"At this time Edinburgh was honouring itself, and Mr. Parnell, by"
1079,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,conferring its citizenship on that patriot.  Murray was actually told off
1080,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"'to stand at a given point of the line on which the hero marched,' and to"
1081,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,write some lines of 'picturesque description.'  This kind of thing could
1082,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,not go on.  It was at Nelson's Monument that he stood: his enthusiasm was
1083,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,more for Nelson than for Mr. Parnell; and he caught a severe cold on this
1084,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,noble occasion.  Murray's opinions clashed with those of the _Scottish
1085,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Leader_, and he withdrew from its service."
1086,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1087,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Just a week passed between the Parnellian triumph and Murray's retreat
1088,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,from daily journalism.  'On a newspaper one must have no opinions except
1089,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,those which are favourable to the sale of the paper and the filling of
1090,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,its advertisement columns.'  That is not precisely an accurate theory.
1091,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Without knowing anything of the circumstances, one may imagine that"
1092,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Murray was rather impracticable.  Of course he could not write against
1093,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"his own opinions, but it is unusual to expect any one to do that, or to"
1094,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,find any one who will do it.  'Incompatibility of temper' probably caused
1095,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,this secession from the newspaper.
1096,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1097,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"After various attempts to find occupation, he did some proof-reading for"
1098,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Messrs. Constable.  Among other things he 'read' the journal of Lady Mary
1099,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Coke, privately printed for Lord Home.  Lady Mary, who appears as a"
1100,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"lively child in _The Heart of Midlothian_, 'had a taste for loo, gossip,"
1101,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"and gardening, but the greatest of these is gossip.'  The best part of"
1102,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,the book is Lady Louisa Stuart's inimitable introduction.  Early in
1103,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,October he decided to give up proof-reading: the confinement had already
1104,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,told on his health.  In the letter which announces this determination he
1105,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"describes a sermon of Principal Caird: 'Voice, gesture, language,"
1106,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"thought--all in the highest degree,--combined to make it the most moving"
1107,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,and exalted speech of a man to men that I ever listened to.'  'The world
1108,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"is too much with me,' he adds, as if he and the world were ever friends,"
1109,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,or ever likely to be friendly.
1110,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1111,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,October 27th found him dating from St. Andrews again.  'St. Andrews after
1112,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Edinburgh is Paradise.'  His Dalilah had called him home to her, and he"
1113,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"was never again unfaithful.  He worked for his firm friend, Professor"
1114,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Meiklejohn, he undertook some teaching, and he wrote a little.  It was at"
1115,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,this time that his biographer made Murray's acquaintance.  I had been
1116,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"delighted with his verses in _College Echoes_, and I asked him to bring"
1117,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,me some of his more serious work.  But he never brought them: his old
1118,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"enemy, reserve, overcame him.  A few of his pieces were published 'At the"
1119,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Sign of the Ship' in _Longman's Magazine_, to which he contributed"
1120,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,occasionally.
1121,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1122,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,From this point there is little in Murray's life to be chronicled.  In
1123,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"1890 his health broke down entirely, and consumption declared itself."
1124,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Very early in 1891 he visited Egypt, where it was thought that some"
1125,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"educational work might be found for him.  But he found Egypt cold, wet,"
1126,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,and windy; of Alexandria and the Mediterranean he says little: indeed he
1127,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,was almost too weak and ill to see what is delightful either in nature or
1128,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,art.
1129,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1130,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"'To aching eyes each landscape lowers,"
1131,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"To feverish pulse each gale blows chill,"
1132,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,And Araby's or Eden's bowers
1133,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Were barren as this moorland hill,'"
1134,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1135,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,says the least self-conscious of poets.  Even so barren were the rich
1136,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Nile and so bleak the blue Mediterranean waters.  Though received by the
1137,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"kindest and most hospitable friends, Murray was homesick, and pined to be"
1138,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"in England, now that spring was there.  He made the great mistake of"
1139,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"coming home too early.  At Ilminster, in his mother's home, he slowly"
1140,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,faded out of life.  I have not the heart to quote his descriptions of
1141,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"brief yet laborious saunters in the coppices, from the letters which he"
1142,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"wrote to the lady of his heart.  He was calm, cheerful, even buoyant.  His"
1143,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"letters to his college friends are all concerned with literature, or with"
1144,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"happy old times, and are full of interest in them and in their happiness."
1145,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1146,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,He was not wholly idle.  He wrote a number of short pieces of verse in
1147,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"_Punch_, and two or three in the _St. James's Gazette_.  Other work, no"
1148,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"doubt, he planned, but his strength was gone.  In 1891 his book, _The"
1149,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Scarlet Gown_, was published by his friend, Mr. A. M. Holden.  The little"
1150,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"volume, despite its local character, was kindly received by the Reviews."
1151,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Here, it was plain, we had a poet who was to St. Andrews what the"
1152,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,regretted J. K. S. was to Eton and Cambridge.  This measure of success
1153,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,was not calculated to displease our _alumnus addictissimus_.
1154,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1155,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Friendship and love, he said, made the summer of 1892 very happy to him."
1156,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"I last heard from him in the summer of 1893, when he sent me some of his"
1157,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"most pleasing verses.  He was in Scotland; he had wandered back, a shadow"
1158,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of himself, to his dear St. Andrews.  I conceived that he was better; he"
1159,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,said nothing about his health.  It is not easy to quote from his letters
1160,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"to his friend, Mr. Wallace, still written in his beautiful firm hand."
1161,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,They are too full of affectionate banter: they also contain criticisms on
1162,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"living poets: he shows an admiration, discriminating and not wholesale,"
1163,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"of Mr. Kipling's verse: he censures Mr. Swinburne, whose Jacobite song"
1164,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,(as he wrote to myself) did not precisely strike him as the kind of thing
1165,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,that Jacobites used to sing.
1166,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1167,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,They certainly celebrated
1168,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1169,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"'The faith our fathers fought for,"
1170,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"The kings our fathers knew,'"
1171,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1172,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,in a different tone in the North.
1173,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1174,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"The perfect health of mind, in these letters of a dying man, is"
1175,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"admirable.  Reading old letters over, he writes to Miss ---, 'I have"
1176,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,known a wonderful number of wonderfully kind-hearted people.'  That is
1177,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"his criticism of a world which had given him but a scanty welcome, and a"
1178,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"life of foiled endeavour, of disappointed hope.  Even now there was a"
1179,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,disappointment.  His poems did not find a publisher: what publisher can
1180,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,take the risk of adding another volume of poetry to the enormous stock of
1181,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,verse brought out at the author's expense?  This did not sour or sadden
1182,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"him: he took Montaigne's advice, 'not to make too much marvel of our own"
1183,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"fortunes.'  His biographer, hearing in the winter of 1893 that Murray's"
1184,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"illness was now considered hopeless, though its rapid close was not"
1185,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"expected, began, with Professor Meiklejohn, to make arrangements for the"
1186,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,publication of the poems.  But the poet did not live to have this poor
1187,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,gratification.  He died in the early hours of 1894.
1188,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1189,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Of the merits of his more serious poetry others must speak.  To the
1190,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,Editor it seems that he is always at his best when he is inspired by the
1191,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Northern Sea, and the long sands and grey sea grasses.  Then he is most"
1192,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"himself.  He was improving in his art with every year: his development,"
1193,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"indeed, was somewhat late."
1194,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1195,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,It is less of the writer than the man that we prefer to think.  His
1196,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"letters display, in passages which he would not have desired to see"
1197,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"quoted, the depth and tenderness and thoughtfulness of his affections.  He"
1198,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"must have been a delightful friend: illness could not make him peevish,"
1199,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,and his correspondence with old college companions could never be taken
1200,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"for that of a consciously dying man.  He had perfect courage, and"
1201,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"resolution even in his seeming irresoluteness.  He was resolved to be,"
1202,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"and continued to be, himself.  'He had kept the bird in his bosom.'  We,"
1203,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"who regret him, may wish that he had been granted a longer life, and a"
1204,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"secure success.  Happier fortunes might have mellowed him, no fortunes"
1205,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,could have altered for the worse his admirable nature.  He lives in the
1206,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"hearts of his friends, and in the pride and sympathy of those who, after"
1207,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"him, have worn and shall wear the scarlet gown."
1208,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,
1209,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,The following examples of his poetry were selected by Murray's biographer
1210,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"from a considerable mass, and have been seen through the press by"
1211,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,"Professor Meiklejohn, who possesses the original manuscript, beautifully"
1212,A TENNYSONIAN FRAGMENT,written.

2838,URSULA,
2839,URSULA,"There is a village in a southern land,"
2840,URSULA,By rounded hills closed in on every hand.
2841,URSULA,"The streets slope steeply to the market-square,"
2842,URSULA,"Long lines of white-washed houses, clean and fair,"
2843,URSULA,"With roofs irregular, and steps of stone"
2844,URSULA,Ascending to the front of every one.
2845,URSULA,"The people swarthy, idle, full of mirth,"
2846,URSULA,Live mostly by the tillage of the earth.
2847,URSULA,
2848,URSULA,"Upon the northern hill-top, looking down,"
2849,URSULA,"Like some sequestered saint upon the town,"
2850,URSULA,Stands the great convent.
2851,URSULA,
2852,URSULA,"On a summer night,"
2853,URSULA,"Ten years ago, the moon with rising light"
2854,URSULA,"Made all the convent towers as clear as day,"
2855,URSULA,While still in deepest shade the village lay.
2856,URSULA,"Both light and shadow with repose were filled,"
2857,URSULA,"The village sounds, the convent bells were stilled."
2858,URSULA,"No foot in all the streets was now astir,"
2859,URSULA,And in the convent none kept watch but her
2860,URSULA,Whom they called Ursula.  The moonlight fell
2861,URSULA,Brightly around her in the lonely cell.
2862,URSULA,"Her eyes were dark, and full of unshed woe,"
2863,URSULA,"Like mountain tarns which cannot overflow,"
2864,URSULA,"Surcharged with rain, and round about the eyes"
2865,URSULA,"Deep rings recorded sleepless nights, and cries"
2866,URSULA,"Stifled before their birth.  Her brow was pale,"
2867,URSULA,And like a marble temple in a vale
2868,URSULA,"Of cypress trees, shone shadowed by her hair."
2869,URSULA,"So still she was, that had you seen her there,"
2870,URSULA,You might have thought you were beholding death.
2871,URSULA,"Her lips were parted, but if any breath"
2872,URSULA,"Came from between them, it were hard to know"
2873,URSULA,By any movement of her breast of snow.
2874,URSULA,
2875,URSULA,"But when the summer night was now far spent,"
2876,URSULA,She kneeled upon the floor.  Her head she leant
2877,URSULA,Down on the cold stone of the window-seat.
2878,URSULA,God knows if there were any vital heat
2879,URSULA,"In those pale brows, or if they chilled the stone."
2880,URSULA,"And as she knelt, she made a bitter moan,"
2881,URSULA,"With words that issued from a bitter soul,--"
2882,URSULA,"'O Mary, Mother, and is this thy goal,"
2883,URSULA,Thy peace which waiteth for the world-worn heart?
2884,URSULA,Is it for this I live and die apart
2885,URSULA,"From all that once I knew?  O Holy God,"
2886,URSULA,"Is this the blessed chastening of Thy rod,"
2887,URSULA,Which only wounds to heal?  Is this the cross
2888,URSULA,"That I must carry, counting all for loss"
2889,URSULA,Which once was precious in the world to me?
2890,URSULA,"If Thou be God, blot out my memory,"
2891,URSULA,"And let me come, forsaking all, to Thee."
2892,URSULA,"But here, though that old world beholds me not,"
2893,URSULA,"Here, though I seek Thee through my lonely lot,"
2894,URSULA,"Here, though I fast, do penance day by day,"
2895,URSULA,"Kneel at Thy feet, and ever watch and pray,"
2896,URSULA,Beloved forms from that forsaken world
2897,URSULA,Revisit me.  The pale blue smoke is curled
2898,URSULA,Up from the dwellings of the sons of men.
2899,URSULA,"I see it, and all my heart turns back again"
2900,URSULA,"From seeking Thee, to find the forms I love."
2901,URSULA,
2902,URSULA,"'Thou, with Thy saints abiding far above,"
2903,URSULA,"What canst Thou know of this, my earthly pain?"
2904,URSULA,"They said to me, Thou shalt be born again,"
2905,URSULA,"And learn that worldly things are nothing worth,"
2906,URSULA,"In that new state.  O God, is this new birth,"
2907,URSULA,Birth of the spirit dying to the flesh?
2908,URSULA,Are these the living waters which refresh
2909,URSULA,"The thirsty spirit, that it thirst no more?"
2910,URSULA,Still all my life is thirsting to the core.
2911,URSULA,"Thou canst not satisfy, if this be Thou."
2912,URSULA,"And yet I dream, or I remember how,"
2913,URSULA,"Before I came here, while I tarried yet"
2914,URSULA,"Among the friends they tell me to forget,"
2915,URSULA,"I never seemed to seek Thee, but I found"
2916,URSULA,"Thou wert in all the loveliness around,"
2917,URSULA,And most of all in hearts that loved me well.
2918,URSULA,
2919,URSULA,"'And then I came to seek Thee in this cell,"
2920,URSULA,"To crucify my worldliness and pride,"
2921,URSULA,"To lay my heart's affections all aside,"
2922,URSULA,As carnal hindrances which held my soul
2923,URSULA,From hasting unencumbered to her goal.
2924,URSULA,"And all this have I done, or else have striven"
2925,URSULA,"To do, obeying the behest of Heaven,"
2926,URSULA,And my reward is bitterness.  I seem
2927,URSULA,To wander always in a feverish dream
2928,URSULA,"On plains where there is only sun and sand,"
2929,URSULA,"No rock or tree in all the weary land,"
2930,URSULA,"My thirst unquenchable, my heart burnt dry."
2931,URSULA,"And still in my parched throat I faintly cry,"
2932,URSULA,"Deliver me, O Lord: bow down Thine ear!"
2933,URSULA,
2934,URSULA,'He will not answer me.  He does not hear.
2935,URSULA,I am alone within the universe.
2936,URSULA,Oh for a strength of will to rise and curse
2937,URSULA,"God, and defy Him here to strike me dead!"
2938,URSULA,"But my heart fails me, and I bow my head,"
2939,URSULA,"And cry to Him for mercy, still in vain."
2940,URSULA,"Oh for some sudden agony of pain,"
2941,URSULA,To make such insurrection in my soul
2942,URSULA,"That I might burst all bondage of control,"
2943,URSULA,"Be for one moment as the beasts that die,"
2944,URSULA,And pour my life in one blaspheming cry!'
2945,URSULA,
2946,URSULA,"The morning came, and all the convent towers"
2947,URSULA,Were gilt with glory by the golden hours.
2948,URSULA,But where was Ursula?  The sisters came
2949,URSULA,"With quiet footsteps, calling her by name,"
2950,URSULA,"But there was none that answered.  In her cell,"
2951,URSULA,"The glad, illuminating sunshine fell"
2952,URSULA,"On form and face, and showed that she was dead."
2953,URSULA,"'May Christ receive her soul!' the sisters said,"
2954,URSULA,"And spoke in whispers of her holy life,"
2955,URSULA,"And how God's mercy spared her pain and strife,"
2956,URSULA,"And gave this quiet death.  The face was still,"
2957,URSULA,"Like a tired child's, that lies and sleeps its fill."

3499,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Then bade them keep such woman's tales to tell an English slave,"
3500,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"For he would hunt to-morrow, though a thousand dreams foretold"
3501,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,All the sorrow and the mischief De Breteuil's brain could hold.
3502,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3503,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"So the Red King's gone a-hunting, for all that they could do,"
3504,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,And an arrow in the greenwood made De Breteuil's dream come true.
3505,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"They said 'twas Walter Tyrrel, and so it may have been,"
3506,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,But there's many walk the forest when the leaves are thick and green.
3507,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3508,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"There's many walk the forest, who would gladly see the sport,"
3509,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"When the King goes out a-hunting with the nobles of his court,"
3510,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"And when the nobles scatter, and the King is left alone,"
3511,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,There are thickets where an English slave might string his bow unknown.
3512,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3513,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"The forest laws are cruel, and the time is hard as steel"
3514,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"To English slaves, trod down and bruised beneath the Norman heel."
3515,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Like worms they writhe, but by-and-by the Norman heel may learn"
3516,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"There are worms that carry poison, and that are not slow to turn."
3517,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3518,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"The lords came back, by one and two, from straying far apart,"
3519,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,And they found the Red King lying with an arrow in his heart.
3520,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Who should have done the deed, but him by whom it first was seen?"
3521,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"So they said 'twas Walter Tyrrel, and so it may have been."
3522,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3523,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"They cried upon Prince Henry, the brother of the King,"
3524,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"And he came up the greenwood, and rode into the ring."
3525,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"He looked upon his brother's face, and then he turned away,"
3526,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"And galloped off to Winchester, where all the treasure lay."
3527,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3528,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"'God strike me,' cried De Breteuil, 'but brothers' blood is thin!"
3529,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,And why should ours be thicker that are neither kith nor kin?'
3530,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"They spurred their horses in the flank, and swiftly thence they passed,"
3531,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,But Walter Tyrrel lingered and forsook his liege the last.
3532,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3533,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"They say it was enchantment, that fixed him to the scene,"
3534,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"To look upon his traitor's work, and so it may have been."
3535,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"But presently he got to horse, and took the seaward way,"
3536,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"And all alone within the glade, in state the Red King lay."
3537,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3538,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Then a creaking cart came slowly, which a charcoal-burner drove."
3539,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"He found the dead man lying, a ghastly treasure-trove;"
3540,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"He raised the corpse for charity, and on his wagon laid,"
3541,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,And so the Red King drove in state from out the forest glade.
3542,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3543,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"His hair was like a yellow flame about the bloated face,"
3544,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,The blood had stained his tunic from the fatal arrow-place.
3545,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Not good to look upon was he, in life, nor yet when dead."
3546,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"The driver of the cart drove on, and never turned his head."
3547,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
3548,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"When next the nobles throng at night the royal banquet-hall,"
3549,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"Another King will rule the feast, the drinking and the brawl,"
3550,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,"While Walter Tyrrel walks alone upon the Norman shore,"
3551,THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS,And the Red King in the forest will chase the deer no more.

3559,AFTER WATERLOO,On the field of Waterloo we made Napoleon rue
3560,AFTER WATERLOO,"That ever out of Elba he decided for to come,"
3561,AFTER WATERLOO,"For we finished him that day, and he had to run away,"
3562,AFTER WATERLOO,And yield himself to Maitland on the Billy-ruffium.
3563,AFTER WATERLOO,
3564,AFTER WATERLOO,"'Twas a stubborn fight, no doubt, and the fortune wheeled about,"
3565,AFTER WATERLOO,"And the brave Mossoos kept coming most uncomfortable near,"
3566,AFTER WATERLOO,"And says Wellington the hero, as his hopes went down to zero,"
3567,AFTER WATERLOO,'I wish to God that Blooker or the night was only here!'
3568,AFTER WATERLOO,
3569,AFTER WATERLOO,"But Blooker came at length, and we broke Napoleon's strength,"
3570,AFTER WATERLOO,And the flower of his army--that's the old Imperial Guard--
3571,AFTER WATERLOO,"They made a final sally, but they found they could not rally,"
3572,AFTER WATERLOO,"And at last they broke and fled, after fighting bitter hard."
3573,AFTER WATERLOO,
3574,AFTER WATERLOO,"Now Napoleon he had thought, when a British ship he sought,"
3575,AFTER WATERLOO,"And gave himself uncalled-for, in a manner, you might say,"
3576,AFTER WATERLOO,"He'd be treated like a king with the best of every thing,"
3577,AFTER WATERLOO,And maybe have a palace for to live in every day.
3578,AFTER WATERLOO,
3579,AFTER WATERLOO,"He was treated very well, as became a noble swell,"
3580,AFTER WATERLOO,"But we couldn't leave him loose, not in Europe anywhere,"
3581,AFTER WATERLOO,"For we knew he would be making some gigantic undertaking,"
3582,AFTER WATERLOO,While the trustful British lion was reposing in his lair.
3583,AFTER WATERLOO,
3584,AFTER WATERLOO,"We tried him once before near the European shore,"
3585,AFTER WATERLOO,"Having planted him in Elba, where he promised to remain,"
3586,AFTER WATERLOO,"But when he saw his chance, why, he bolted off to France,"
3587,AFTER WATERLOO,And he made a lot of trouble--but it wouldn't do again.
3588,AFTER WATERLOO,
3589,AFTER WATERLOO,"Says the Prince to him, 'You know, far away you'll have to go,"
3590,AFTER WATERLOO,"To a pleasant little island off the coast of Africay,"
3591,AFTER WATERLOO,"Where they tell me that the view of the ocean deep and blue,"
3592,AFTER WATERLOO,"Is remarkable extensive, and it's there you'll have to stay.'"
3593,AFTER WATERLOO,
3594,AFTER WATERLOO,"So Napoleon wiped his eye, and he wished the Prince good-bye,"
3595,AFTER WATERLOO,"And being stony-broke, made the best of it he could,"
3596,AFTER WATERLOO,"And they kept him snugly pensioned, where his Royal Highness mentioned,"
3597,AFTER WATERLOO,And Napoleon Boneyparty is provided for for good.
3598,AFTER WATERLOO,
3599,AFTER WATERLOO,"Now of that I don't complain, but I ask and ask in vain,"
3600,AFTER WATERLOO,"Why me, a British soldier, as has lost a useful arm"
3601,AFTER WATERLOO,"Through fighting of the foe, when the trumpets ceased to blow,"
3602,AFTER WATERLOO,"Should be forced to feed the pigs on a little Surrey farm,"
3603,AFTER WATERLOO,
3604,AFTER WATERLOO,"While him as fought with us, and created such a fuss,"
3605,AFTER WATERLOO,"And in the whole of Europe did a mighty deal of harm,"
3606,AFTER WATERLOO,"Should be kept upon a rock, like a precious fighting cock,"
3607,AFTER WATERLOO,"And be found in beer and baccy, which would suit me to a charm?"
