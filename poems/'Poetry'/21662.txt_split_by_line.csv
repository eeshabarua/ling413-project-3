86,ENVOY,_My songs were once of the sunrise_:
87,ENVOY,_They shouted it over the bar_;
88,ENVOY,"_First-footing the dawns_, _they flourished_,"
89,ENVOY,_And flamed with the morning star_.
90,ENVOY,
91,ENVOY,_My songs are now of the sunset_:
92,ENVOY,"_Their brows are touched with light_,"
93,ENVOY,_But their feet are lost in the shadows_
94,ENVOY,_And wet with the dews of night_.
95,ENVOY,

98,ENVOY,_And for his sake who made them_
99,ENVOY,_Let them be dear to You_.

106,PRAELUDIUM,_Largo espressivo_
107,PRAELUDIUM,
108,PRAELUDIUM,"In sumptuous chords, and strange,"
109,PRAELUDIUM,Through rich yet poignant harmonies:
110,PRAELUDIUM,"Subtle and strong browns, reds"
111,PRAELUDIUM,"Magnificent with death and the pride of death,"
112,PRAELUDIUM,"Thin, clamant greens"
113,PRAELUDIUM,And delicate yellows that exhaust
114,PRAELUDIUM,The exquisite chromatics of decay:
115,PRAELUDIUM,"From ruining gardens, from reluctant woods--"
116,PRAELUDIUM,"Dear, multitudinously reluctant woods!--"
117,PRAELUDIUM,"And sering margents, forced"
118,PRAELUDIUM,"To be lean and bare and perished grace by grace,"
119,PRAELUDIUM,"And flower by flower discharmed,"
120,PRAELUDIUM,"Comes, to a purpose none,"
121,PRAELUDIUM,"Not even the Scorner, which is the Fool, can blink,"
122,PRAELUDIUM,The dead-march of the year.
123,PRAELUDIUM,
124,PRAELUDIUM,Dead things and dying!  Now the long-laboured soul
125,PRAELUDIUM,"Listens, and pines.  But never a note of hope"
126,PRAELUDIUM,"Sounds: whether in those high,"
127,PRAELUDIUM,Transcending unisons of resignation
128,PRAELUDIUM,"That speed the sovran sun,"
129,PRAELUDIUM,"As he goes southing, weakening, minishing,"
130,PRAELUDIUM,Almighty in obedience; or in those
131,PRAELUDIUM,"Small, sorrowful colloquies"
132,PRAELUDIUM,"Of bronze and russet and gold,"
133,PRAELUDIUM,"Colour with colour, dying things with dead,"
134,PRAELUDIUM,That break along this visual orchestra:
135,PRAELUDIUM,"As in that other one, the audible,"
136,PRAELUDIUM,"Horn answers horn, hautboy and violin"
137,PRAELUDIUM,"Talk, and the 'cello calls the clarionet"
138,PRAELUDIUM,"And flute, and the poor heart is glad."
139,PRAELUDIUM,There is no hope in these--only despair.
140,PRAELUDIUM,
141,PRAELUDIUM,"Then, destiny in act, ensues"
142,PRAELUDIUM,That most tremendous passage in the score:
143,PRAELUDIUM,When hangman rains and winds have wrought
144,PRAELUDIUM,"Their worst, and, the brave lights gone down,"
145,PRAELUDIUM,"The low strings, the brute brass, the sullen drums"
146,PRAELUDIUM,"Sob, grovel, and curse themselves"
147,PRAELUDIUM,Silent. . . .
148,PRAELUDIUM,But on the spirit of Man
149,PRAELUDIUM,And on the heart of the World there falls
150,PRAELUDIUM,"A strange, half-desperate peace:"
151,PRAELUDIUM,"A war-worn, militant, gray jubilance"
152,PRAELUDIUM,"In the unkind, implacable tyranny"
153,PRAELUDIUM,"Of Winter, the obscene,"
154,PRAELUDIUM,"Old, crapulous Regent, who in his loins--"
155,PRAELUDIUM,"O, who but feels he carries in his loins"
156,PRAELUDIUM,"The wild, sweet-blooded, wonderful harlot, Spring?"

161,I.,
162,I.,
163,I.,Low--low
164,I.,"Over a perishing after-glow,"
165,I.,"A thin, red shred of moon"
166,I.,Trailed.  In the windless air
167,I.,The poplars all ranked lean and chill.
168,I.,"The smell of winter loitered there,"
169,I.,And the Year's heart felt still.
170,I.,Yet not so far away
171,I.,"Seemed the mad Spring,"
172,I.,"But that, as lovers will,"
173,I.,"I let my laughing heart go play,"
174,I.,As it had been a fond maid's frolicking;
175,I.,"And, turning thrice the gold I'd got,"
176,I.,In the good gloom
177,I.,Solemnly wished me--what?
178,I.,"What, and with whom?"

185,II,Moon of half-candied meres
186,II,"And flurrying, fading snows;"
187,II,"Moon of unkindly rains,"
188,II,"Wild skies, and troubled vanes;"
189,II,"When the Norther snarls and bites,"
190,II,"And the lone moon walks a-cold,"
191,II,"And the lawns grizzle o' nights,"
192,II,And wet fogs search the fold:
193,II,Here in this heart of mine
194,II,"A dream that warms like wine,"
195,II,"A dream one other knows,"
196,II,Moon of the roaring weirs
197,II,"And the sip-sopping close,"
198,II,"February Fill-Dyke,"
199,II,Shapes like a royal rose--
200,II,"A red, red rose!"
201,II,
202,II,"O, but the distance clears!"
203,II,"O, but the daylight grows!"
204,II,Soon shall the pied wind-flowers
205,II,"Babble of greening hours,"
206,II,Primrose and daffodil
207,II,"Yearn to a fathering sun,"
208,II,"The lark have all his will,"
209,II,"The thrush be never done,"
210,II,"And April, May, and June"
211,II,Go to the same blythe tune
212,II,As this blythe dream of mine!
213,II,"Moon when the crocus peers,"
214,II,"Moon when the violet blows,"
215,II,"February Fair-Maid,"
216,II,"Haste, and let come the rose--"
217,II,Let come the rose!
218,II,

220,II,
221,III,III
222,III,
223,III,
224,III,"The night dislimns, and breaks"
225,III,Like snows slow thawn;
226,III,An evil wind awakes
227,III,On lea and lawn;
228,III,The low East quakes; and hark!
229,III,"Out of the kindless dark,"
230,III,"A fierce, protesting lark,"
231,III,High in the horror of dawn!
232,III,
233,III,"A shivering streak of light,"
234,III,A scurry of rain:
235,III,Bleak day from bleaker night
236,III,Creeps pinched and fain;
237,III,"The old gloom thins and dies,"
238,III,And in the wretched skies
239,III,"A new gloom, sick to rise,"
240,III,"Sprawls, like a thing in pain."
241,III,
242,III,"And yet, what matter--say!--"
243,III,"The shuddering trees,"
244,III,"The Easter-stricken day,"
245,III,The sodden leas?
246,III,"The good bird, wing and wing"
247,III,"With Time, finds heart to sing,"
248,III,As he were hastening
249,III,The swallow o'er the seas.

253,IV,IV
254,IV,
255,IV,
256,IV,It came with the year's first crocus
257,IV,In a world of winds and snows--
258,IV,"Because it would, because it must,"
259,IV,Because of life and time and lust;
260,IV,And a year's first crocus served my turn
261,IV,As well as the year's first rose.
262,IV,
263,IV,"The March rack hurries and hectors,"
264,IV,The March dust heaps and blows;
265,IV,"But the primrose flouts the daffodil,"
266,IV,And here's the patient violet still;
267,IV,"And the year's first crocus brought me luck,"
268,IV,So hey for the year's first rose!
269,IV,
270,IV,
271,IV,
272,V,V
273,V,
274,V,
275,V,The good South-West on sea-worn wings
276,V,Comes shepherding the good rain;
277,V,"The brave Sea breaks, and glooms, and swings,"
278,V,"A weltering, glittering plain."
279,V,
280,V,"Sound, Sea of England, sound and shine,"
281,V,"Blow, English Wind, amain,"
282,V,"Till in this old, gray heart of mine"
283,V,The Spring need wake again!

286,V,
287,VI,VI
288,VI,
289,VI,
290,VI,"In the red April dawn,"
291,VI,"In the wild April weather,"
292,VI,From brake and thicket and lawn
293,VI,The birds sing all together.
294,VI,
295,VI,The look of the hoyden Spring
296,VI,Is pinched and shrewish and cold;
297,VI,But all together they sing
298,VI,Of a world that can never be old:
299,VI,
300,VI,Of a world still young--still young!--
301,VI,"Whose last word won't be said,"
302,VI,"Nor her last song dreamed and sung,"
303,VI,Till her last true lover's dead!
304,VI,
305,VI,
306,VI,
307,VII,VII
308,VII,
309,VII,
310,VII,"The April sky sags low and drear,"
311,VII,"The April winds blow cold,"
312,VII,"The April rains fall gray and sheer,"
313,VII,And yeanlings keep the fold.
314,VII,
315,VII,"But the rook has built, and the song-birds quire,"
316,VII,And over the faded lea
317,VII,"The lark soars glorying, gyre on gyre,"
318,VII,And he is the bird for me!
319,VII,
320,VII,For he sings as if from his watchman's height
321,VII,"He saw, this blighting day,"
322,VII,The far vales break into colour and light
323,VII,From the banners and arms of May.
324,VII,

326,VII,
327,VIII,VIII
328,VIII,
329,VIII,
330,VIII,Shadow and gleam on the Downland
331,VIII,"Under the low Spring sky,"
332,VIII,Shadow and gleam in my spirit--
333,VIII,Why?
334,VIII,
335,VIII,"A bird, in his nest rejoicing,"
336,VIII,Cheers and flatters and woos:
337,VIII,A fresh voice flutters my fancy--
338,VIII,Whose?
339,VIII,
340,VIII,And the humour of April frolics
341,VIII,And bickers in blade and bough--
342,VIII,"O, to meet for the primal kindness"
343,VIII,Now!

350,IX,"The wind on the wold,"
351,IX,"With sea-scents and sea-dreams attended,"
352,IX,Is wine!
353,IX,The air is as gold
354,IX,In elixir--it takes so the splendid
355,IX,Sunshine!
356,IX,
357,IX,"O, the larks in the blue!"
358,IX,"How the song of them glitters, and glances,"
359,IX,And gleams!
360,IX,The old music sounds new--
361,IX,"And it's O, the wild Spring, and his chances"
362,IX,And dreams!
363,IX,
364,IX,There's a lift in the blood--
365,IX,"O, this gracious, and thirsting, and aching"
366,IX,Unrest!
367,IX,"All life's at the bud,"
368,IX,"And my heart, full of April, is breaking"
369,IX,My breast.

374,X,
375,X,
376,X,Deep in my gathering garden
377,X,A gallant thrush has built;
378,X,And his quaverings on the stillness
379,X,Like light made song are spilt.
380,X,
381,X,"They gleam, they glint, they sparkle,"
382,X,"They glitter along the air,"
383,X,Like the song of a sunbeam netted
384,X,In a tangle of red-gold hair.
385,X,
386,X,"And I long, as I laugh and listen,"
387,X,For the angel-hour that shall bring
388,X,"My part, pre-ordained and appointed,"
389,X,In the miracle of Spring.

394,XI,
395,XI,
396,XI,What doth the blackbird in the boughs
397,XI,Sing all day to his nested spouse?
398,XI,"What but the song of his old Mother-Earth,"
399,XI,In her mighty humour of lust and mirth?
400,XI,"'Love and God's will go wing and wing,"
401,XI,"And as for death, is there any such thing?'--"
402,XI,"In the shadow of death,"
403,XI,"So, at the beck of the wizard Spring"
404,XI,The dear bird saith--
405,XI,So the bird saith!
406,XI,
407,XI,"Caught with us all in the nets of fate,"
408,XI,So the sweet wretch sings early and late;
409,XI,"And, O my fairest, after all,"
410,XI,The heart of the World's in his innocent call.
411,XI,The will of the World's with him wing and wing:--
412,XI,'Life--life--life!  'Tis the sole great thing
413,XI,"This side of death,"
414,XI,Heart on heart in the wonder of Spring!'
415,XI,So the bird saith--
416,XI,The wise bird saith!

423,XII,"This world, all hoary"
424,XII,"With song and story,"
425,XII,Rolls in a glory
426,XII,Of youth and mirth;
427,XII,Above and under
428,XII,Clothed on with wonder.
429,XII,"Sunrise and thunder,"
430,XII,And death and birth.
431,XII,His broods befriending
432,XII,With grace unending
433,XII,And gifts transcending
434,XII,"A god's at play,"
435,XII,Yet do his meetness
436,XII,And sovran sweetness
437,XII,Hold in the jocund purpose of May.
438,XII,
439,XII,"So take your pleasure,"
440,XII,And in full measure
441,XII,"Use of your treasure,"
442,XII,When birds sing best!
443,XII,"For when heaven's bluest,"
444,XII,"And earth feels newest,"
445,XII,"And love longs truest,"
446,XII,And takes not rest:
447,XII,"When winds blow cleanest,"
448,XII,"And seas roll sheenest,"
449,XII,And lawns lie greenest:
450,XII,"Then, night and day,"
451,XII,"Dear life counts dearest,"
452,XII,And God walks nearest
453,XII,"To them that praise Him, praising His May."

460,XIII,_I talked one midnight with the jolly ghost_
461,XIII,"_Of a gray ancestor_, _TOM HEYWOOD hight_;"
462,XIII,"_And_, '_Here's_,' _says he_, _his old heart liquor-lifted_--"
463,XIII,'_Here's how we did when GLORIANA shone_:'
464,XIII,
465,XIII,All in a garden green
466,XIII,Thrushes were singing;
467,XIII,"Red rose and white between,"
468,XIII,Lilies were springing;
469,XIII,It was the merry May;
470,XIII,Yet sang my Lady:--
471,XIII,"'Nay, Sweet, now nay, now nay!"
472,XIII,I am not ready.'
473,XIII,
474,XIII,Then to a pleasant shade
475,XIII,I did invite her:
476,XIII,"All things a concert made,"
477,XIII,For to delight her;
478,XIII,"Under, the grass was gay;"
479,XIII,Yet sang my Lady:--
480,XIII,"'Nay, Sweet, now nay, now nay!"

489,XIV,"Why do you falter and delay,"
490,XIV,"Now that the insolent, high-blooded May"
491,XIV,Comes greeting and to greet?
492,XIV,Comes with her instant summonings to stray
493,XIV,"Down the green, antient way--"
494,XIV,"The leafy, still, rose-haunted, eye-proof street!--"
495,XIV,"Where true lovers each other may entreat,"
496,XIV,Ere the gold hair turn gray?
497,XIV,"Entreat, and fleet"
498,XIV,"Life gaudily, and so play out their play,"
499,XIV,Even with the triumphing May--
500,XIV,"The young-eyed, smiling, irresistible May!"
501,XIV,
502,XIV,"Why do you loiter and linger, O most dear?"
503,XIV,"Why do you dream and palter and stay,"
504,XIV,"When every dawn, that rushes up the bay,"
505,XIV,"Brings nearer, and more near,"
506,XIV,"The Terror, the Discomforter, whose prey,"
507,XIV,"Beloved, we must be?  Nor prayer, nor tear,"
508,XIV,"Lets his arraignment; but we disappear,"
509,XIV,"What time the gold turns gray,"
510,XIV,"Into the sheer,"
511,XIV,"Blind gulfs unglutted of mere Yesterday,"
512,XIV,With the unlingering May--
513,XIV,"The good, fulfilling, irresponsible May!"

532,XV,
533,XV,"Sweet-pea and pansy,"
534,XV,Red hawthorn and white;
535,XV,Gilliflowers--like praising souls;
536,XV,Lilies--lamps of light:
537,XV,"Nurselings of what happy winds,"

539,XV,Joylets good to see and smell--
540,XV,_Cover her with flowers_!
541,XV,
542,XV,Like to sky-born shadows
543,XV,"Mirrored on a stream,"
544,XV,Let their odours meet and mix
545,XV,And waver through her dream!
546,XV,"Last, the crowded sweetness"
547,XV,"Slumber overpowers,"
548,XV,And she feels the lips she loves

559,XVI,"The wind so light it scarce begins to be,"
560,XVI,"As these long days unfold a flower, unfold"
561,XVI,Life's rose in me.
562,XVI,
563,XVI,Life's rose--life's rose!  Red at my heart it glows--
564,XVI,"Glows and is glad, as in some quiet close"
565,XVI,The sun's spoiled darlings their gay life renew!
566,XVI,"Only, the clement rain, the mothering dew,"

579,XVII,
580,XVII,"Come not, dear hands, so near,"

582,XVII,"Dear heart, hold me less dear,"

584,XVII,
585,XVII,"Keep me, dear lips, O, keep"
586,XVII,"The great last word unspoken,"

598,XVIII,A revel of gold and green.
599,XVIII,
600,XVIII,"O, the green dreams and the golden,"

613,XIX,"And sweet-breathed garden-ghosts walk sudden and wide,"
614,XIX,"Hesper, that bringeth all good things,"
615,XIX,Brings me a dream of you.
616,XIX,"And in my heart, dear heart, it comes and goes,"
617,XIX,"Even as the south wind lingers and falls and blows,"
618,XIX,"Even as the south wind sighs and tarries and streams,"
619,XIX,Among the living leaves about and round;
620,XIX,"With a still, soothing sound,"
621,XIX,As of a multitude of dreams
622,XIX,"Of love, and the longing of love, and love's delight,"
623,XIX,"Thronging, ten thousand deep,"
624,XIX,"Into the uncreating Night,"
625,XIX,"With semblances and shadows to fulfil,"

639,XX,Naught else in the night for me!
640,XX,
641,XX,"Over the northern height,"
642,XX,Light--
643,XX,Light and the dawn of a day
644,XX,With nothing for me but a breast
645,XX,"Laboured with love's unrest,"
646,XX,And the irk of an idle May!

663,XXI,Till the very Sides of the Grave fall in.
664,XXI,
665,XXI,"For the strife of Love's the abysmal strife,"
666,XXI,And the word of Love is the Word of Life.

678,XXII,"We caught at a mood as it passed in flight,"
679,XXII,And we bade it stoop and stay.
680,XXII,And what with the dawn of night began
681,XXII,With the dusk of day was done;
682,XXII,"For that is the way of woman and man,"
683,XXII,When a hazard has made them one.
684,XXII,
685,XXII,"Arc upon arc, from shade to shine,"
686,XXII,The World went thundering free;
687,XXII,And what was his errand but hers and mine--
688,XXII,"The lords of him, I and she?"
689,XXII,"O, it's die we must, but it's live we can,"

697,XXIII,
698,XXIII,
699,XXIII,I took a hansom on to-day
700,XXIII,For a round I used to know--
701,XXIII,That I used to take for a woman's sake
702,XXIII,In a fever of to-and-fro.
703,XXIII,
704,XXIII,There were the landmarks one and all--
705,XXIII,What did they stand to show?
706,XXIII,Street and square and river were there--
707,XXIII,Where was the antient woe?
708,XXIII,
709,XXIII,Never a hint of a challenging hope
710,XXIII,"Nor a hope laid sick and low,"
711,XXIII,But a longing dead as its kindred sped
712,XXIII,A thousand years ago!
713,XXIII,
714,XXIII,
715,XXIII,
716,XXIV,XXIV
717,XXIV,
718,XXIV,
719,XXIV,Only a freakish wisp of hair?--
720,XXIV,"Nay, but its wildest, its most frolic whorl"
721,XXIV,"Stands for a slim, enamoured, sweet-fleshed girl!"
722,XXIV,"And so, a tangle of dream and charm and fun,"
723,XXIV,"Its every crook a promise and a snare,"
724,XXIV,"Its every dowle, or genially gadding"
725,XXIV,"Or crisply curled,"
726,XXIV,"Heartening and madding,"
727,XXIV,Empales a novel and peculiar world
728,XXIV,"Of right, essential fantasies,"
729,XXIV,"And shining acts as yet undone,"
730,XXIV,But in these wonder-working days
731,XXIV,"Soon, soon to ask our sovran Lord, the Sun,"
732,XXIV,"For countenance and praise,"
733,XXIV,"As of the best his storying eye hath seen,"
734,XXIV,"And his vast memory can parallel,"
735,XXIV,Among the darling victories--
736,XXIV,"Beneficent, beautiful, inexpressible--"
737,XXIV,Of life on time!--
738,XXIV,Yet have they flashed and been
739,XXIV,"In millions, since 'twas his to bring"
740,XXIV,"The heaven-creating Spring,"
741,XXIV,"An angel of adventure and delight,"
742,XXIV,"In all her beauty and all her strength and worth,"
743,XXIV,"With her great guerdons of romance and spright,"
744,XXIV,"And those high needs that fill the flesh with might,"
745,XXIV,"Home to the citizens of this good, green earth."
746,XXIV,
747,XXIV,Poor souls--they have but time and place
748,XXIV,To play their transient little play
749,XXIV,"And sing their singular little song,"
750,XXIV,Ere they are rushed away
751,XXIV,"Into the antient, undisclosing Night;"
752,XXIV,And none is left to tell of the clear eyes
753,XXIV,"That filled them with God's grace,"
754,XXIV,And turned the iron skies to skies of gold!
755,XXIV,None; but the sweetest She herself grows old--
756,XXIV,"Grows old, and dies;"
757,XXIV,"And, but for such a lovely snatch of hair"
758,XXIV,"As this, none--none could guess, or know"
759,XXIV,"That She was kind and fair,"
760,XXIV,And he had nights and days beyond compare--
761,XXIV,How many dusty and silent years ago!

766,XXV,
767,XXV,
768,XXV,"This is the moon of roses,"
769,XXV,The lovely and flowerful time;

771,XXV,Your dreams about me climb.
772,XXV,
773,XXV,"This is the moon of roses,"
774,XXV,Glad and golden and blue;
775,XXV,"And, as red roses drink of the sun,"
776,XXV,My dreams they drink of you.
777,XXV,
778,XXV,This is the moon of roses!
779,XXV,"The cherishing South-West blows,"

790,XXVI,To a lover in pain
791,XXVI,What lovelier word?
792,XXVI,
793,XXVI,Two of each other fain
794,XXVI,Happily heart on heart:
795,XXVI,So in the wind and rain
796,XXVI,Spring bears his part!
797,XXVI,
798,XXVI,"O, to be heart on heart"
799,XXVI,"One with the warm June rain,"
800,XXVI,"God with us from the start,"
801,XXVI,And no more pain!
802,XXVI,
803,XXVI,
804,XXVI,
805,XXVII,XXVII
806,XXVII,
807,XXVII,
808,XXVII,It was a bowl of roses:
809,XXVII,"There in the light they lay,"
810,XXVII,"Languishing, glorying, glowing"
811,XXVII,Their life away.
812,XXVII,
813,XXVII,"And the soul of them rose like a presence,"
814,XXVII,"Into me crept and grew,"
815,XXVII,And filled me with something--some one--
816,XXVII,"O, was it you?"
817,XXVII,
818,XXVII,
819,XXVII,
820,XXVIII,XXVIII
821,XXVIII,
822,XXVIII,
823,XXVIII,Your feet as glad
824,XXVIII,"And light as a dove's homing wings, you came--"
825,XXVIII,"Came with your sweets to fill my hands,"
826,XXVIII,My sense with your perfume.
827,XXVIII,
828,XXVIII,We closed with lips
829,XXVIII,"Grown weary and fain with longing from afar,"
830,XXVIII,"The while your grave, enamoured eyes"
831,XXVIII,Drank down the dream in mine.
832,XXVIII,
833,XXVIII,Till the great need
834,XXVIII,"So lovely and so instant grew, it seemed"
835,XXVIII,The embodied Spirit of the Spring
836,XXVIII,"Hung at me, heart on heart."

845,XXIX,Love and laughter and song
846,XXIX,The blue day long
847,XXIX,"Going to the same glad, golden tune--"
848,XXIX,The same glad tune!
849,XXIX,
850,XXIX,"Clouds on the dim, delighting skies a-sprinkle;"
851,XXIX,Poplars black in the wake of a setting moon;
852,XXIX,Love and languor and sleep

872,XXX,"Red and white roses, love and death--"

890,XXXI,As it were made for me and you?
891,XXXI,
892,XXXI,"Take it and live it beam by beam,"
893,XXXI,"Motes of light on a gleaming stream,"

906,XXXII,
907,XXXII,"Near and afar in the leafage,"
908,XXXII,That last glad call to the nest!
909,XXXII,And the thought of you hangs and triumphs
910,XXXII,With Hesper low in the west!
911,XXXII,
912,XXXII,"Till the song and the light and the colour,"
913,XXXII,"The passion of earth and sky,"

926,XXXIII,The turn of the Year
927,XXXIII,And the call to decay.
928,XXXIII,
929,XXXIII,"Stately and splendid,"
930,XXXIII,The Summer passes:
931,XXXIII,"Sad with satiety,"
932,XXXIII,Sick with fulfilment;
933,XXXIII,"Spent and consumed,"
934,XXXIII,But august till the end.
935,XXXIII,
936,XXXIII,By wilting hedgerows
937,XXXIII,"And white-hot highways,"
938,XXXIII,Bearing its memories

951,XXXIV,"None of those desperate, exquisite caresses,"
952,XXXIV,"So instant--O, so brief!--and yet so much,"
953,XXXIV,The thought of the swiftest lifts and blesses?
954,XXXIV,"Nor any one of those great royal words,"
955,XXXIV,"Those sovran privacies of speech,"

961,XXXIV,"No, there was none of these,"
962,XXXIV,"Dear one, and yet--"
963,XXXIV,"O, eyes on eyes!  O, voices breaking still,"
964,XXXIV,"For all the watchful will,"
965,XXXIV,Into a kinder kindness than seemed due
966,XXXIV,"From you to me, and me to you!"
967,XXXIV,"And that hot-eyed, close-throated, blind regret"
968,XXXIV,Of woman and man baulked and debarred the blue!--
969,XXXIV,No kiss--no kiss that day?
970,XXXIV,"Nay, rather, though we seemed to wear the rue,"

985,XXXV,"Sing, and once more, as in the prime,"
986,XXXV,There shall be naught but seems the best.
987,XXXV,
988,XXXV,And sing me at the last of love:
989,XXXV,"Sing that old magic of the May,"
990,XXXV,That makes the great world laugh and move
991,XXXV,As lightly as our dream to-day!

1003,XXXVI,That life and its best were done;

1005,XXXVI,In the beat of the living sun.
1006,XXXVI,
1007,XXXVI,"I read the news, and the terms of the news"
1008,XXXVI,Reeled random round my brain
1009,XXXVI,"Like the senseless, tedious buzzle and boom"
1010,XXXVI,Of a bluefly in the pane.
1011,XXXVI,
1012,XXXVI,"So I went for the news to the house of the news,"
1013,XXXVI,"But the words were left unsaid,"
1014,XXXVI,"For the face of the house was blank with blinds,"
1015,XXXVI,And I knew that she was dead.

1025,XXXVII,And in the scything they were dead.
1026,XXXVII,
1027,XXXVII,"Now the high Autumn flames afield,"
1028,XXXVII,And what is all his golden yield
1029,XXXVII,"To that we took, and sheaved, and bound"
1030,XXXVII,In the green dusk that gladdened round?
1031,XXXVII,
1032,XXXVII,Yet must the memory grieve and ache
1033,XXXVII,"Of that we did for dear love's sake,"

1047,XXXVIII,"It must be, Dear, that, late or soon,"
1048,XXXVIII,"Out of the ken of the watching moon,"

1071,XXXIX,
1072,XXXIX,"November, the old, lean widow,"
