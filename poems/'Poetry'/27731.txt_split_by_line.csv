64,I,I
65,I,
66,I,Celia was laughing. Hopefully I said:
67,I,"""How shall this beauty that we share,"
68,I,"This love, remain aware"
69,I,Beyond our happy breathing of the air?
70,I,How shall it be fulfilled and perfected?...
71,I,"If you were dead,"
72,I,"How then should I be comforted?"""
73,I,But Celia knew instead:
74,I,"""He who finds beauty here, shall find it there."""
75,I,A halo gathered round her hair.
76,I,I looked and saw her wisdom bare
77,I,The living bosom of the countless dead.
78,I,... And there
79,I,I laid my head.
80,I,
81,I,"Again when Celia laughed, I doubted her and said:"
82,I,"""Life must be led"
83,I,In many ways more difficult to see
84,I,Than this immediate way
85,I,For you and me.
86,I,"We stand together on our lake's edge, and the mystery"
87,I,"Of love has made us one, as day is made of night and night of day."
88,I,Aware of one identity
89,I,"Within each other, we can say:"
90,I,'I shall be everything you are.'...
91,I,We are uplifted till we touch a star.
92,I,We know that overhead
93,I,"Is nothing more austere, more starry, or more deep to understand"
94,I,"Than is our union, human hand in hand."
95,I,".... But over our lake come strangers--a crowded launch, a lonely sailing boy."
96,I,A mile away a train bends by. In every car
97,I,"Strangers are travelling, each with particular"
98,I,"And unkind preference like ours, with privacy"
99,I,"Of understanding, with especial joy"
100,I,"Like ours. Celia, Celia, why should there be"
101,I,"Distrust between ourselves and them, disunity?"
102,I,.... How careful we have been
103,I,"To trim this little circle that we tread,"
104,I,To set a bar
105,I,"To strangers and forbid them!--Are they not as we,"
106,I,Our very likeness and our nearest kin?
107,I,"How can we shut them out and let stars in?"""
108,I,"She looked along the lake. And when I heard her speak,"
109,I,The sun fell on the boy's white sail and her white cheek.
110,I,"""I touch them all through you,"" she said. ""I cannot know them now"
111,I,"Deeply and truly as my very own, except through you,"
112,I,Except through one or two
113,I,Interpreters.
114,I,But not a moment stirs
115,I,"Here between us, binding and interweaving us,"
116,I,"That does not bind these others to our care."""
117,I,The sunlight fell in glory on her hair....
118,I,"And then said Celia, radiant, when I held her near:"
119,I,"""They who find beauty there, shall find it here."""
120,I,"And on her brow,"
121,I,"When I heard Celia speak,"
122,I,Cities were populous
123,I,With peace and oceans echoed glories in her ear
124,I,And from her risen thought
125,I,"Her lips had brought,"
126,I,As from some peak
127,I,"Down through the clouds, a mountain-air"
128,I,To guide the lonely and uplift the weak.
129,I,"""Record it all,"" she told me, ""more than merely this,"
130,I,"More than the shine of sunset on our heads, more than a kiss,"
131,I,More than our rapt agreement and delight
132,I,Watching the mountain mingle with the night....
133,I,Tell that the love of two incurs
134,I,"The love of multitudes, makes way"
135,I,"And welcome for them, as a solitary star"
136,I,Brings on the great array.
137,I,"Go make a lovers' calendar,"""
138,I,"She said, ""for every day."""
139,I,
140,I,And when the sun had put away
141,I,"His dazzle, over the shadowy firs"
142,I,The solitary star came out.... So on some night
143,I,To eyes of youth shall come my light
144,I,And hers.
145,I,
146,I,
147,II,II
148,II,
149,II,"""Where are you bound, O solemn voyager?"""
150,II,She laughed one day and asked me in her mirth:
151,II,"""Where are you from?"
152,II,"Why are you come?"""
153,II,.... The questions beat like tapping of a drum;
154,II,"And how could I be dumb,"
155,II,I who have bugles in me? Fast
156,II,"The answer blew to her,"
157,II,For all my breath was worth....
158,II,"""As a bird comes by grace of spring,"
159,II,You are my journey and my wing--
160,II,"And into your heart, O Celia,"
161,II,"My heart has flown, to sing"
162,II,Solemn and long
163,II,"A most undaunted song."""
164,II,
165,II,This was the song that she herself had taught me how to sing:
166,II,.... As immigrants come toward America
167,II,"On their continual ships out of the past,"
168,II,"So on my ship America have I, by birth,"
169,II,Come forth at last
170,II,From all the bitter corners of the earth.
171,II,And I have ears to hear the westward wind blowing
172,II,And I have eyes to look beyond the scope Of sea
173,II,And I have hands to touch the hands
174,II,Of shipmates who are going
175,II,Wherever I go and the grace of knowing
176,II,That what for them is hope
177,II,Is hope for me.
178,II,"I come from many times and many lands,"
179,II,"I look toward life and all that it shall hold,"
180,II,Past bound and past divide.
181,II,And I shall be consoled
182,II,By a continent as wide
183,II,As the round invisible sky.
184,II,".... ""The unseen shall become the seen...."
185,II,"O Celia, be my Spanish Queen!"
186,II,"The Genoan am I!"""
187,II,And Celia cried:
188,II,"""My jewels, they are yours,"
189,II,Yours for the journey. Use them well.
190,II,"Go find the new world, win the shores"
191,II,Of which the old books tell!
192,II,".... Yet will they listen, poet? Will they sail with you?"
193,II,Will they not call you dreamer of a dream?
194,II,"Will they not laugh at you, because you seem"
195,II,Concerned with words that people often say
196,II,"And deeds they never do?"""
197,II,The bright sails of my caravel shook seaward in reply:
198,II,"""Though I be told"
199,II,A thousand facts to hold
200,II,"Me back, though the old boundary"
201,II,"Rise up like hatred in my way,"
202,II,"Though fellow-voyagers cry,"
203,II,'A lie!'--
204,II,Here as I come with heaven at my side
205,II,None of the weary words they say
206,II,"Remain with me,"
207,II,I am borne like a wave of the sea
208,II,Toward worlds to be....
209,II,"And, young and bold,"
210,II,I am happier than they--
211,II,"The timid unbelievers who grow old!"""
212,II,
213,II,"She interceded: ""How impatient, how unkind"
214,II,You are! What secret do you know
215,II,To keep you young?
216,II,Age comes with keen and accurate advance
217,II,Against youth's lightly handled lance.
218,II,Age is an ancient despot that has wrung
219,II,"All hearts.""... My answer was the song forever sung:"
220,II,"""This that I need to know I know--"
221,II,"Onpouring and perpetual immigrants,"
222,II,We join a fellowship beyond America
223,II,Yet in America....
224,II,"Beyond the touch of age, my Celia,"
225,II,"In you, in me, in everyone, we join God's growing mind."
226,II,"For in no separate place or time, or soul, we find"
227,II,Our meaning. In one mingled soul reside
228,II,All times and places. On a tide
229,II,Of mist and azure air
230,II,"We journey toward that soul, through circumstance,"
231,II,Until at last we fully care and dare
232,II,"To make within ourselves divinity."""
233,II,
234,II,"""And what of all the others,"" Celia said,"
235,II,"""Who ventured brave as you? What of the dead?"""
236,II,Again I saw the halo in her hair
237,II,"And said: ""The dead sail forward, hid behind"
238,II,This wave that we ourselves must mount to find
239,II,The eternal way.
240,II,Adventurers of long ago
241,II,"Seeking a richer gain than earthy gold,"
242,II,"They have left for us, half-told,"
243,II,"Their guesses of the port, more numerous and blind"
244,II,Than their unnumbered and forgotten faces.
245,II,"... And though today, as then,"
246,II,"Death is a wind blowing them forward out of sight and out of mind,"
247,II,Yet in familiar and in unfamiliar places
248,II,Inquiring by what means I may
249,II,The destination of the wind
250,II,"Of death, I have found signs and traces"
251,II,Of the way they go
252,II,And with a quicker heart I have beheld again
253,II,"In visions, from my ship at sea,"
254,II,"The great new world confronting me,"
255,II,"Where, yesterday,"
256,II,"Today, tomorrow, dwell my countrymen."""
257,II,
258,II,"And then I looked away,"
259,II,"Over the pasture and the valley, to the New Hampshire town...."
260,II,"And my heart's acclaim went down,"
261,II,"To Florida, Wisconsin, California,"
262,II,And brought a good report to Celia:
263,II,"""My ship America,"
264,II,"This whole wide-timbered land,"
265,II,"Well captained and well manned,"
266,II,Ascends the sea
267,II,"Of time, carrying me"
268,II,And many passengers.
269,II,And every cabin stirs
270,II,"With the pulsing of its engine over the sway of time,"
271,II,"Yes, every state and city, every village, every farm,"
272,II,And every heart and everyone's right arm.
273,II,"... Celia, hold out your hand,"
274,II,"Or anyone in any field or street, hold out your hand--"
275,II,And I can see it pulse the massive climb
276,II,And dip
277,II,"Of this America,"
278,II,"My ship!"""
279,II,
280,II,"""Why make your ship so small?"
281,II,"Can your America contain them all?"""
282,II,How wisely I replied
283,II,In the province of my pride:
284,II,"""But these are my own shipmates, these"
285,II,Who share my ship America with me!
286,II,... On many seas
287,II,"On other ships, even the ancient ships of Greece,"
288,II,Have other immigrants set sail for peace.
289,II,But these are my own shipmates whom I see
290,II,"At hand--these are my company."""
291,II,"""What have you said,"" she cried,"
292,II,"""Thinking you knew?"
293,II,Whom have you called your shipmates? You were wrong!
294,II,Your ship is strong
295,II,With a more various crew
296,II,"Than any one man's country could provide,"
297,II,To make it ride
298,II,So high and manifold and so complete.
299,II,This is the engine-beat
300,II,"Of life itself, the ship of ships."
301,II,There is no other ship among the stars than this.
302,II,The wind of death is a bright kiss
303,II,Upon the lips
304,II,"Of every immigrant, as upon yours and mine--"
305,II,Theirs is the stinging brine
306,II,"And sun and open sea,"
307,II,"And theirs the arching sky, eternity."""
308,II,And Celia had my homage. I was wrong.
309,II,"Immigrants all, one ship we ride,"
310,II,Man and his bride
311,II,The journey through.
312,II,O let it be with a bridal-song!...
313,II,"""My shipmates are as many as eternity is long:"
314,II,The unborn and the living and the dead--
315,II,"And, Celia, you!"""
316,II,
317,II,
318,III,III
319,III,
320,III,That midnight when the moon was tall
321,III,I walked alone by the white lake--yet with a vanished race
322,III,"And with a race to come. To walk with dead men is to pray,"
323,III,To walk with men unborn--to find the way.
324,III,
325,III,I have seen many days. That night I watched them all.
326,III,I have seen many a sign and trace
327,III,Of beauty and of hope:
328,III,An elm at night; an arrowy waterfall;
329,III,The illimitable round unbroken scope
330,III,Of life; a friend's unfrightened dying face.
331,III,
332,III,"Though I have heard the cry of fear in crowded loneliness of space,"
333,III,"Dead laughter from the lips of lust,"
334,III,"Anger from fools, falsehood from sycophants,"
335,III,"(My fear, my lips, my anger, my disgrace)"
336,III,"Though I have held a golden cup and tasted rust,"
337,III,Seen cities rush to be defiled
338,III,By the bright-fevered and consuming sin
339,III,"Of making only coin and lives to count it in,"
340,III,"Yet once I watched with Celia,"
341,III,"Watched on a ferry an Italian child,"
342,III,One whom America
343,III,Had changed.
344,III,His cheek was hardy and his mouth was frail
345,III,"For sweetness, and his eyes were opening wild"
346,III,As with wonder at an unseen figure carrying a grail.
347,III,"Perhaps he faced, as I did in his glance,"
348,III,"The spirit of the living dead who, having ranged"
349,III,"Through long reverses, forward without fail"
350,III,Carry deliverance
351,III,"From privilege and disinheritance,"
352,III,Until their universal soul shall prove
353,III,The only answer to the ache of love.
354,III,
355,III,"""America was wistful in that child,"""
356,III,Said Celia afterwards--and smiled
357,III,"Because all three of us were immigrants,"
358,III,Each voyaging into each.
359,III,"Over the city-roofs, the sun awoke"
360,III,Bright in the dew
361,III,"Of a marvellous morning, while she spoke"
362,III,"Of the sun, the dew, the wonder, in a child:"
363,III,"""He who devises tyranny,"" she said,"
364,III,"""Denies the resurrection of the dead,"
365,III,"Beneath his own degree degrades himself,"
366,III,Invades himself with ugliness and wars.
367,III,"But he who knows all men to be himself,"
368,III,"Part of his own experiment and reach,"
369,III,Humbles and amplifies himself
370,III,"To build and share a tenement of stars."""
371,III,
372,III,Once when we broke a loaf of bread
373,III,"And shared the honey, Celia said:"
374,III,"""To share all beauty as the interchanging dust,"
375,III,To be akin and kind and to entrust
376,III,"All men to one another for their good,"
377,III,"Is to have heard and understood,"
378,III,And carried to the common enemy
379,III,"In you and me,"
380,III,"The ultimatum of democracy."""
381,III,
382,III,"""But to what goal?"" I wondered. And I heard her happy speech:"
383,III,"""It is my faith that God is our own dream"
384,III,Of perfect understanding of the soul.
385,III,"It is my passion that, alike through me"
386,III,"And every member of eternity,"
387,III,The source of God is sending the same stream.
388,III,"It is my peace that when my life is whole,"
389,III,"God's life shall be completed and supreme."""
390,III,
391,III,And once when I had made complaint
392,III,"About America, she warned me: ""Be not faint"
393,III,"Of heart, but bold to see the soul's advance."
394,III,The chances are not far nor few....
395,III,"Face beauty,"" Celia said, ""then beauty faces you."""
396,III,
397,III,And under all things her advice was true.
398,III,"... Discovering what she knew,"
399,III,Not only on a mountainous place
400,III,Or by the solving sea
401,III,"But through the world I have seen endless beauty, as the number grows"
402,III,"Of those who, in a child cheated of simple joy"
403,III,Or in a wasted rose
404,III,Or in a lover's immemorial lonely eyes
405,III,Or in machines that quicken and destroy
406,III,A multitude or in a mother's unregarded grace
407,III,"And broken heart, through all the skies"
408,III,"And all humanity,"
409,III,"Seek out the single spirit, face to face,"
410,III,"Find it, become a conscious part of it"
411,III,"And know that something pure and exquisite,"
412,III,"Although inscrutably begun,"
413,III,Surely exalts the many into one.
414,III,
415,III,"""I shall not lose, nor you,"""
416,III,I said to Celia. Over the world the morning-dew
417,III,"Moved like a hymn and sang to us: ""Go now, fulfill"
418,III,Your destiny and joy;
419,III,"Each in the other, both in that Italian boy,"
420,III,"And he in you, like flowers in a hill!"""
421,III,... She was the nearness of imperfect God
422,III,On whom in her perfection was at work.
423,III,Lest I should shirk
424,III,"My share, I asked her for His blessing and His nod--"
425,III,And His breath was in her shining hair like the wind in golden-rod.
426,III,
427,III,"""But, Celia, Celia, tell me what to be,"""
428,III,"I asked, ""and what to do,"
429,III,"To keep your faith in me,"
430,III,"To witness mine in you!"""
431,III,"She answered: ""Dare to see"
432,III,In every man and woman everywhere
433,III,The making of us two.
434,III,See none that we can spare
435,III,From the creation of our soul.
436,III,Swear to be whole.
437,III,"Let not your faith abate,"
438,III,"But establish it in persons and exalt it in the state."""
439,III,
440,III,
441,IV,IV
442,IV,
443,IV,Celia has challenged me....
444,IV,"Be my reply,"
445,IV,"Challenge to poets who, with tinkling tricks,"
446,IV,Meet life and pass it by.
447,IV,"""Beauty,"" they ask, ""in politics?"""
448,IV,"""If you put it there,"" say I."
449,IV,
450,IV,Wide the new world had opened its bright gates.
451,IV,And a woman who had heard of the new world
452,IV,All her life long and had saved her pence
453,IV,"By hard frugality, to be her competence"
454,IV,"In the free home, came eagerly in nineteen seven"
455,IV,"Into These States,"
456,IV,With her little earnings furled
457,IV,In a large handkerchief--but with a heart
458,IV,"Too rich to be contained, for she had done her part:"
459,IV,She had come
460,IV,With faith to Heaven.
461,IV,"But there was a panic that year,"
462,IV,"No work, no wages in These States."
463,IV,And a great fear
464,IV,Seized on the immigrant. And so she took her pence
465,IV,"All of them, furled"
466,IV,"Safe in her handkerchief, to a government cashier--"
467,IV,A clerk in the post-office. (And he relates
468,IV,"Her errand as a joke, yet tenderly"
469,IV,For I watched him telling me.)
470,IV,"... Not knowing English, being dumb,"
471,IV,She had brought with her a thin-faced lad
472,IV,"To interpret. And he made it clear,"
473,IV,While she unfurled
474,IV,"Her handkerchief and poured the heap of coins out of her hand,"
475,IV,That 'she was giving all she had--
476,IV,"To be used no matter how, you understand' ..."
477,IV,Lest harm should come to the new world.
478,IV,
479,IV,"O doubters of democracy,"
480,IV,Undo your mean contemptuous art!--
481,IV,"More than in all that poetry has said,"
482,IV,"More than in mound or marble, in the living live the dead."
483,IV,The past has done its reproductive part.
484,IV,"Hear now the cry of beauty's present needs,"
485,IV,"Of comrades levelling a thousand creeds,"
486,IV,Finding futility
487,IV,"In conflict, selfishness, hardness of heart!"
488,IV,For love has many poets who can see
489,IV,Ascending in the sky
490,IV,Above the shadowy passes
491,IV,The everlasting hills: humanity.
492,IV,"O doubters of the time to be,"
493,IV,"What is this might, this mystery,"
494,IV,"Moving and singing through democracy,"
495,IV,This music of the masses
496,IV,And of you and me--
497,IV,But purging and dynamic poetry!--
498,IV,What is this eagerness from sea to sea
499,IV,But young divinity!
500,IV,
501,IV,"I have seen doubters, with a puny joy,"
502,IV,Accept amusement for their little while
503,IV,And feed upon some nourishing employ
504,IV,But otherwise shake their wise heads and smile--
505,IV,Protesting that one man can no more move the mass
506,IV,For good or ill
507,IV,Than could the ancients kindle the sun
508,IV,By tying torches to a wheel and rolling it downhill.
509,IV,But not the wet circumference of the seas
510,IV,"Can quench the living light in even these,"
511,IV,"These who forget,"
512,IV,"Eating the fruits of earth,"
513,IV,That nothing ever has been done
514,IV,"To spur the spirit of mankind,"
515,IV,Which has not come to pass
516,IV,Forth from the heart and mind
517,IV,"Of some one man, through other men birth after birth,"
518,IV,In thoughts that dare
519,IV,And in deeds that share
520,IV,And in a will resolved to find
521,IV,A finer breath
522,IV,Born in the deep maternity of death.
523,IV,"... If these be ecstasies of youth,"
524,IV,Yet they are news of which all time has need.
525,IV,"If they be lies, tell them yourselves and heed"
526,IV,How poets' twice-told lies become the truth!
527,IV,
528,IV,"There was a poet Celia loved who, hearing all around"
529,IV,The multitudinous tread
530,IV,"Of common majesty,"
531,IV,(A hearty immigrant was he!)
532,IV,Made of the gathering insurgent sound
533,IV,Another continent of poetry?
534,IV,"His name is writ in his blood, mine and yours."
535,IV,"... ""And when he celebrates"
536,IV,"These States,"""
537,IV,"She said, ""how can Americans worth their salt"
538,IV,"But listen to the wavesong on their shores,"
539,IV,"The waves and Walt,"
540,IV,"And hear the windsong over rock and wood,"
541,IV,"The winds and Walt,"
542,IV,And let the mansong enter at their gates
543,IV,"And know that it is good!"""
544,IV,
545,IV,"Walt Whitman, by his perfect friendliness"
546,IV,Has let me guess
547,IV,"That into Celia, into me,"
548,IV,He and unnumbered dead have come
549,IV,"To be our intimates,"
550,IV,To make of us their home
551,IV,Commingling earth and heaven....
552,IV,That by our true and mutual deeds
553,IV,We shall at last be shriven
554,IV,Of these hypocrisies and jealous creeds
555,IV,And petty separate fates--
556,IV,"That I in every man and he in me,"
557,IV,"Together making God, are gradually creating whole"
558,IV,The single soul.
559,IV,Somebody called Walt Whitman--
560,IV,Dead!
561,IV,"He is alive instead,"
562,IV,"Alive as I am. When I lift my head,"
563,IV,"His head is lifted. When his brave mouth speaks,"
564,IV,My lips contain his word. And when his rocker creaks
565,IV,"Ghostly in Camden, there I sit in it and watch my hand grow old"
566,IV,And take upon my constant lips the kiss of younger truth....
567,IV,It is my joy to tell and to be told
568,IV,"That he, in all the world and me,"
569,IV,"Cannot be dead,"
570,IV,"That I, in all the world and him, youth after youth"
571,IV,Shall lift my head.
572,IV,
573,IV,
574,V,V
575,V,
576,V,"There is a vision, Celia, in your face...."
577,V,
578,V,Beauty had lived in India like a mad
579,V,"And withdrawn prophetess, in Greece had set her pace"
580,V,Between a laurelled lad
581,V,"And a singing maiden, pitched her purple tents"
582,V,"In Rome, leaned with a mother's fears"
583,V,In Bethlehem to nurse a son of God upon her breast
584,V,"And learned the tender loneliness of tears,"
585,V,"Awhile had hid in Europe, sad"
586,V,"In the shadow of magnificence,"
587,V,"Brooding, finding no rest,"
588,V,"And then of a sudden she had run forth from her hiding-place,"
589,V,"Rejoicing, desperate, intense"
590,V,"Against her enemy, a rod"
591,V,"Of fire in her hand, her tresses crowned"
592,V,"With liberty, her purpose bold and bound"
593,V,That every son should be a son of God.
594,V,And then she wept for France.... But once more clad
595,V,"In stars, she beckons to America, the land"
596,V,Of hope. Behold her stand
597,V,With her bright finger scorning armaments
598,V,And on her lips the unconquerable common sense
599,V,Of love calling the world to challenge and confound
600,V,The empty idols of her enemy!
601,V,"... Comforter of experience,"
602,V,"Enlightener of old events,"
603,V,Beauty forever dares to widen and retrace
604,V,"Her way, singing the marches of democracy,"
605,V,"Carrying banners of the time to be,"
606,V,Calling companions to her high command.
607,V,
608,V,"There is a banner, Celia, in your hand!"
609,V,
610,V,"Though sons, whose fathers bled"
611,V,"For freedom, struggle now instead"
612,V,With heavier weapons and with weary-waking head
613,V,For bread;
614,V,"Though sons, whose fathers fought in other ages"
615,V,"For fame, bear in their hearts today the scar"
616,V,Of entering where the laborer sleeps
617,V,And rousing him with masterly inquiry where he keeps
618,V,His wages:
619,V,Though all the cunning coil of trade appear a baser thing
620,V,"Than battles are,"
621,V,O trace through time the orbit of this troubled star!
622,V,"... See, from afar off, how the valiant few"
623,V,"Of old, each with a helmet on his head,"
624,V,Practiced their inconclusive feud
625,V,Upon no battlefield of unfeeling dew--
626,V,But on the prostrate stillness of the multitude!
627,V,"Even their knightliest prowess they must rear,"
628,V,"Tamerlane, Alexander, Arthur, every king,"
629,V,Upon the common clay from which they spring.
630,V,"For see how slaves, on whom war falls, renew"
631,V,The strength of war and disappear
632,V,Year after year
633,V,Into the earth--fulfilling it to form and bear
634,V,Democracy!
635,V,Look nearer now along the modern sky
636,V,And watch where every man fastens the electric wing
637,V,"Upon his foot, that he may leave his little sod"
638,V,Of ignorance!
639,V,"And look where, by and by,"
640,V,"Taking his high inheritance,"
641,V,He knows himself and other men as the winged self of God!
642,V,
643,V,The times are gone when only few were fit
644,V,"To view with open vision the sublime,"
645,V,When for the rest an altar-rail sufficed
646,V,To obscure the democratic Christ....
647,V,"Perceiving now his gift, demanding it,"
648,V,"The benison of common benefit,"
649,V,"Men, women, all,"
650,V,"Interpreters of time,"
651,V,Have found that lordly Christ apocryphal
652,V,While Christ the comrade comes again--no wraith
653,V,Of virtue in a far-off faith
654,V,"But a companion hearty, natural,"
655,V,Who sorrows with indomitable eyes
656,V,For his mistreated plan
657,V,"To share with all men the upspringing sod,"
658,V,The unfolding skies--
659,V,"Not God who made Himself the Man,"
660,V,But a man who proved man's unused worth--
661,V,And made himself the God.
662,V,
663,V,"Once you had listened, Celia, to a stream"
664,V,"And lain a long time, silent as a sleeper."
665,V,And then your word arrived as from beyond
666,V,"Your body, bending with its breath the frond"
667,V,Of a fern. You whispered to the listening stream:
668,V,"""As evil is yet wider than we dream,"
669,V,"So good is deeper."" ..."
670,V,O how I try to bring
671,V,Your voice to say in mine that word!--to sing
672,V,Clear-hearted as a mountain-spring
673,V,Of the wonders we see deepening!
674,V,
675,V,"Time cannot bury what the blest have thought,"
676,V,For there is resurrection far and near.
677,V,Often it seems as though a single day had brought
678,V,To each bright hemisphere
679,V,Courage to cast
680,V,The servitude
681,V,And blinded glory of the past
682,V,Away and in a flash had taught
683,V,Purpose and fortitude....
684,V,But not so swiftly are we wrought.
685,V,"By many single days we learn to live,"
686,V,By many flashes read the vision clear
687,V,That every heart is equal debtor
688,V,To its own and every breast
689,V,"For the good before the better,"
690,V,The better toward the best.
691,V,
692,V,When we who hugged awhile the golden bowl
693,V,Of greed behold it now a sieve
694,V,Through which is drained invisibly
695,V,"A nectar we were saving for the soul,"
696,V,Then not in vain have many gone
697,V,The empty ways of stealth
698,V,Seeking a firmer base than honesty
699,V,For building happiness upon....
700,V,And by the ancient agonizing test
701,V,We have slowly guessed
702,V,That a just portion of the whole
703,V,Is all there is of wealth.
704,V,When those who labor wake
705,V,And care ...
706,V,And through the tingling air
707,V,"A dead man's voice, by living men renewed"
708,V,"And women, dares democracy"
709,V,"To self-respect: ""Open the lands! Let mankind share"
710,V,"The ample livelihood they bear!""--"
711,V,"Then not in vain have the poor known distress,"
712,V,Teaching the rich that happiness
713,V,Is something no man may--possess.
714,V,"Little by little we, whose fathers fought"
715,V,"Impassioned, are ashamed"
716,V,Of the familiar thought
717,V,That waste of blood is honourable feud:
718,V,Little by little from the wondering land
719,V,The agitation and the lie of war
720,V,Shall pass; for in the heart disclaimed
721,V,Murder shall be abandoned by the hand.
722,V,And while there grows a fellowship of unshed blood
723,V,To stop the wound and heal the scar
724,V,"Of time, with sudden glorious aptitude"
725,V,Woman assumes her part. Her pity in a flood
726,V,Flings down the gate.
727,V,She has been made to wait
728,V,"Too long, undreaming and untaught"
729,V,The touch and beauty of democracy.
730,V,"But, entering now the strife"
731,V,"In which her saving sense is due,"
732,V,"She watches and she grows aware,"
733,V,"Holding a child more dear than property,"
734,V,"That the many perish to empower the few,"
735,V,That homeless politics have split apart
736,V,The common country of the human heart.
737,V,"(Your heart is beating, Celia, like a song!)"
738,V,.... For man has need
739,V,Not merely of the lips that kiss and hands that feed
740,V,But of the hearts that heed
741,V,And of the minds that speed
742,V,Like rain.
743,V,"Loving a mother or a wife,"
744,V,"Let him release her tenderness, to make him strong,"
745,V,And use her beauty and receive her law:
746,V,The very life of life.
747,V,
748,V,In temporary pain
749,V,The age is bearing a new breed
750,V,"Of men and women, patriots of the world"
751,V,"And one another. Boundaries in vain,"
752,V,"Birthrights and countries, would constrain"
753,V,The old diversity of seed
754,V,To be diversity of soul.
755,V,"O mighty patriots, maintain"
756,V,Your loyalty!--till flags unfurled
757,V,For battle shall arraign
758,V,"The traitors who unfurled them, shall remain"
759,V,"And shine over an army with no slain,"
760,V,And men from every nation shall enroll
761,V,And women--in the hardihood of peace!
762,V,What can my anger do but cease?
763,V,Whom shall I fight and who shall be my enemy
764,V,When he is I and I am he?
765,V,
766,V,Let me have done with that old God outside
767,V,"Who watched with preference and answered prayer,"
768,V,The Godhead that replied
769,V,"Now here, now there,"
770,V,Where heavy cannon were
771,V,Or coins of gold!
772,V,"Let me receive communion with all men,"
773,V,Acknowledging our one and only soul!
774,V,For not till then
775,V,"Can God be God, till we ourselves are whole."
776,V,
777,V,
778,VI,VI
779,VI,
780,VI,"Once in a smoking-car, I saw a scene"
781,VI,That made my blood stand still....
782,VI,"While the sun smouldered in a great ravine,"
783,VI,"And I, with elbow on the window-sill,"
784,VI,"Was watching the dim ember of the west,"
785,VI,"Half-heard, but poignant as a bell"
786,VI,"For fire, there came a moan; the voice of one in hell."
787,VI,"I turned. Across the car were two young men,"
788,VI,"Yet hardly more than boys,"
789,VI,"French by their look, and brothers,"
790,VI,And one was moaning on the other's breast.
791,VI,His face was hid away. I could not tell
792,VI,"What words he said, half English and half French. I only knew"
793,VI,"Both men were suffering, not one but two."
794,VI,"And then that face came into view,"
795,VI,"Gaunt and unshaved, with shadows and wild eyes,"
796,VI,"A face of madness and of desolation. And his cries,"
797,VI,"For all his mate could do,"
798,VI,"Rang out, a shrill and savage noise,"
799,VI,And tears ran down the stubble of his cheek.
800,VI,"The other face was younger, clean and sad"
801,VI,With the manful stricken beauty of a lad
802,VI,Who had intended always to be glad.
803,VI,".... The touch of his compassion, like a mother's,"
804,VI,"Pitied the madman, soothed him and caressed."
805,VI,"And then I heard him speak,"
806,VI,"In a low voice: ""Mon frère, mon frère!"
807,VI,"Calme-toi! Right here's your place."""
808,VI,"And, opening his coat, he pressed"
809,VI,Upon his heart the wanderer's face
810,VI,And smoothed the tangled hair.
811,VI,"After a moment peaceful there,"
812,VI,The maniac screamed--struck out and fell
813,VI,Across his brother's arm. Love could not quell
814,VI,His anger. Wrists together high in air
815,VI,He rose and with a yell
816,VI,Brought down his handcuffs toward his brother's face--
817,VI,"But his hands were pinned below his waist,"
818,VI,"By a burly, silent sheriff, and some hideous thing was bound"
819,VI,Around his arms and feet
820,VI,And he was laid upon the narrow seat.
821,VI,"And then that sound,"
822,VI,That moan
823,VI,Of one forsaken and alone!
824,VI,"""Seigneur! Le createur du ciel et de la terre!"
825,VI,"Forgotten me! Forgotten me!"""
826,VI,.... And when the voice grew weak
827,VI,"The brother leaned again, embraced"
828,VI,The huddled body. But a shriek
829,VI,"Repulsed him: ""Non! Détache-moi! I don't care"
830,VI,For you. Non! Tu es l'homme qui m'a trahi!
831,VI,"Non! Tu n'es pas mon frère!"""
832,VI,
833,VI,But as often as that stricken mind would fill
834,VI,"With the great anguish and the rush of hate,"
835,VI,"The boy, his young eyes older, older,"
836,VI,Would curve his shoulder
837,VI,To the other's pain and hold that haunted face close to his face
838,VI,"And say: ""O wait!"
839,VI,You will know me better by and by.
840,VI,"Mon pauvre petit, be still!"
841,VI,"Right here's your place."""
842,VI,".... The gleam! and then the blinded stare,"
843,VI,The cry:
844,VI,"""Non, tu n'es pas mon frère!"""
845,VI,
846,VI,"I saw myself, myself, as blind"
847,VI,As he. And something smothers
848,VI,My reason. And I do not know my brothers....
849,VI,But every day declare:
850,VI,"""Non, tu n'es pas mon frère!"""
851,VI,
852,VI,"But in the outcome, I can see...."
853,VI,Closer than any brother
854,VI,Shall they be to one another
855,VI,"And to me,"
856,VI,"Closer than mother, father, daughter, son,"
857,VI,"O closer than a lover shall they be,"
858,VI,When madness like a storm shall roll
859,VI,"Away, leaving illumination. Within everyone"
860,VI,The nearness has begun
861,VI,Toward some loved life and toward the soul
862,VI,Perceived therein: the elemental ache to be made whole
863,VI,With beauty and with love.--O I have ached and longed in the embrace
864,VI,Of one I love to be undone
865,VI,"Of differences, to yield and run"
866,VI,"Within the very blood and being of my dear,"
867,VI,"One body and one face,"
868,VI,"One spirit in all space,"
869,VI,Mingled and indissoluble. And I have felt a mortal tear
870,VI,"Smart on my lids, when I had been so near"
871,VI,"To Celia that I knew not which was I,"
872,VI,Yet the day returned between us and the sky
873,VI,Held distances that were not clear
874,VI,To us and we were two again that had been almost one.
875,VI,
876,VI,A mother yields herself to enter
877,VI,"Her child, who nestles close and sleeps"
878,VI,With all his wisdom pressed
879,VI,For comfort to her breast.
880,VI,I can remember my relinquishment
881,VI,"Of consciousness and care,"
882,VI,"Almost of life, upon my mother's heart--the great content"
883,VI,Of being there.
884,VI,
885,VI,"And then I loved a starry boy of three,"
886,VI,"Who looked about him, smiled and took to me,"
887,VI,Held out his arms and chose me among men
888,VI,"For his companion, to confide"
889,VI,His smiles in and to be
890,VI,At ease with. Closely by my side
891,VI,"He sat and touched the world, to see"
892,VI,"If it were solid and worth touching. When he died,"
893,VI,"I too was dead ... and yet I hear him say,"
894,VI,Laughing within my heart today:
895,VI,"""Lo, being you,"
896,VI,"And having lived your years, this will I do,"
897,VI,"And this, and this!"""
898,VI,I have my boy again.
899,VI,I greet him nearer than a kiss.
900,VI,
901,VI,"And so, from birth to death, out of confusion"
902,VI,The secret creeps
903,VI,Across the deeps
904,VI,From its eternal centre
905,VI,In the soul.
906,VI,Communion is the cause and the conclusion
907,VI,And the unfailing sacrament
908,VI,Not only of the mystical frequenter
909,VI,"Of temples, where the body of the dead"
910,VI,Creates divine
911,VI,The living body through the bread
912,VI,"And wine,"
913,VI,But God discovers and discovers
914,VI,His beauty in all lovers.
915,VI,"And, to make His beauty whole,"
916,VI,"Body and body, soul and soul, combine"
917,VI,His one identity with yours and mine.
918,VI,
919,VI,"I know a fellow in a steel-mill who, intent"
920,VI,"Upon his labours and his happiness, had meant"
921,VI,"In his own wisdom to be blest,"
922,VI,Had made his own unaided way
923,VI,"To schooling, opportunity,"
924,VI,"Success. And then he loved and married. And his bride,"
925,VI,"After a brief year, died."
926,VI,I went to him to see
927,VI,If I might comfort him. The comfort came to me.
928,VI,
929,VI,"""David,"" I said, ""under the temporary ache"
930,VI,"There is unwonted nearness with the dead."""
931,VI,I felt his two hands take
932,VI,The sentence from me with a grip
933,VI,Forged in the mills. He told me that his tears were shed
934,VI,"Before her breath went. After that, instead"
935,VI,"Of grief, she came herself. He felt her slip"
936,VI,"Into his being like a miracle, her lip"
937,VI,"Whispering on his, to slake"
938,VI,"His need of her.--""And in the night I wake"
939,VI,With wonder and I find my bride
940,VI,"And her embrace there in our bed,"
941,VI,"Within my very being, not outside!"
942,VI,".... We have each other more, much more,"""
943,VI,"He said, ""now than before."
944,VI,This very moment while I shake
945,VI,"Your hand, my friend,"
946,VI,"Not only I,"
947,VI,But she is touching you--and laughs with me because I cried
948,VI,For her.... People would think me crazy if I told.
949,VI,But something in what you said made me bold
950,VI,"To let you meet my bride!"""
951,VI,
952,VI,It was not madness. David's eye
953,VI,Was clear and open-seeing.
954,VI,His life
955,VI,"Had faced in death and understood in his young wife,"
956,VI,"As I when Celia died,"
957,VI,The secret of God's being.
958,VI,
959,VI,
960,VII,VII
961,VII,
962,VII,"Among good citizens, I praise"
963,VII,"Again a woman whom I knew and know,"
964,VII,A citizen whom I have seen
965,VII,"Most heartily, most patiently"
966,VII,"Making God's mind,"
967,VII,"A citizen who, dead,"
968,VII,Yet shines across her white-remembered ways
969,VII,As the nearness of a light across the snow....
970,VII,"My Celia, mystical, serene,"
971,VII,Laughing and kind.
972,VII,
973,VII,And still I hear among New Hampshire trees
974,VII,Her happy speech:
975,VII,"""Democracy is beauty's inmost reach."""
976,VII,And still her voice announces plain
977,VII,The mystic gain
978,VII,Of friends from adversaries and of peace from pain:
979,VII,Beauty's control
980,VII,Of every soul
981,VII,Surrendering in victory.
982,VII,.... Well I recall how she explained to me
983,VII,With sunlight on her head
984,VII,"When last we looked, as many times before,"
985,VII,Over those hundred foothills rolling like the sea.
986,VII,"""Where mountains are, door after door"
987,VII,"Unlocks within me, opens wide"
988,VII,"And leaves no difference in my heart,"" she said,"
989,VII,"""From anything outside."""
990,VII,
991,VII,"Not only Celia, speaking, taught me these"
992,VII,The tenets of her beauty; but her life was such
993,VII,That I believed as by a palpable touch
994,VII,That heals and tends.
995,VII,Not better nor more learned nor more wise
996,VII,"In many ways than others of my friends,"
997,VII,Celia was happier.
998,VII,Their excellencies and their destinies
999,VII,"Became, contributing, a part of her,"
1000,VII,Anointed her awhile among all men
1001,VII,"An eminent citizen,"
1002,VII,A generous arbiter.
1003,VII,
1004,VII,"Not less bereaved than others of my friends,"
1005,VII,Celia was lovelier.
1006,VII,"And now, though something of her dies,"
1007,VII,Her heart of love assembles and transcends
1008,VII,"Laws, letters, personalities,"
1009,VII,"Beginnings, passages and ends."
1010,VII,
1011,VII,Often I start and look beside me for the stir
1012,VII,Of her sweet presence come again.
1013,VII,"I have cried out to her,"
1014,VII,So vivid has begun
1015,VII,Some dear-remembered sentence in her voice.
1016,VII,"If a deluded wakeful thrush,"
1017,VII,"Seeing a light in a window, sings to the sun,"
1018,VII,Yet he shall soon rejoice;
1019,VII,When the great dawn of day
1020,VII,Opens a thousand windows into one.
1021,VII,
1022,VII,On a path where thrushes wake--called Celia's Way--
1023,VII,Time after time
1024,VII,She led me high among the rills.
1025,VII,And always when I pass again our chosen pine
1026,VII,And feel upon my brow the fine
1027,VII,Soft pressure of an unseen web and brush
1028,VII,It from my face expectantly and climb
1029,VII,"Wide-eyed into the mountains' windy hush,"
1030,VII,Among the green and healing hills
1031,VII,I have found Celia.
1032,VII,For the morning fills
1033,VII,With her and afternoon and twilight. She is always there
1034,VII,As sweet within me as the intimate air.
1035,VII,
1036,VII,We are together still in the deep solitude
1037,VII,"Which is the essence of all companies,"
1038,VII,Not in its loneliness but in its brood
1039,VII,"Of presences, the dawn chanting with birds, the trees"
1040,VII,Translating unremembered memories
1041,VII,Of the returning dead.
1042,VII,"And Celia, who has learned to die,"
1043,VII,Is well aware--and so through her am I--
1044,VII,"That, one by one interpreted,"
1045,VII,All hopes and pains and powers
1046,VII,Are hers and mine to try
1047,VII,"On every star, through every age."
1048,VII,".... And, still together, on this page"
1049,VII,We quote the sun-dial of the sage:
1050,VII,"""_I number none but happy hours._"""
1051,VII,For we remember still
1052,VII,"The morning-hymn we heard: ""Ye shall fulfill"
1053,VII,"Your destiny and joy,"
1054,VII,"Each in the other, both in that Italian boy"
1055,VII,"And he in you, like flowers in a hill."""
1056,VII,
1057,VII,"She said to me one day, where a hill renewed its flowers,"
1058,VII,"""How easy it would be to live and die"
1059,VII,If we would only see the ultimate
1060,VII,"Oneness of life, quicken"
1061,VII,Our hearts with it and know that they who hate
1062,VII,"And strike become by their own blow the stricken!""..."
1063,VII,"""A stranger might be God,"" the Hindus cry."
1064,VII,"But Celia says, importunate:"
1065,VII,"""Everyone must be God and you and I."""
1066,VII,
1067,VII,
1068,VIII,VIII
1069,VIII,
1070,VIII,Almost the body leads the laggard soul; bidding it see
1071,VIII,"The beauty of surrender, the tranquillity"
1072,VIII,Of fusion with the earth. The body turns to dust
1073,VIII,"Not only by a sudden whelming thrust,"
1074,VIII,"Or at the end of a corrupting calm,"
1075,VIII,"But oftentimes anticipates and, entering flowers and trees"
1076,VIII,Upon a hillside or along the brink
1077,VIII,"Of streams, encounters instances"
1078,VIII,Of its eventual enterprise:
1079,VIII,"Inhabits the enclosing clay,"
1080,VIII,In rhapsody is caught away
1081,VIII,On a great tide
1082,VIII,"Of beauty, to abide"
1083,VIII,Translated through the night and day
1084,VIII,"Of time and, by the anointing balm"
1085,VIII,"Of earth, to outgrow decay."
1086,VIII,
1087,VIII,Hark in the wind--the word of silent lips!
1088,VIII,"Look where some subtle throat, that once had wakened lust,"
1089,VIII,"Lies clear and lovely now, a silver link"
1090,VIII,Of change and peace!
1091,VIII,"Hollows and willows and a river-bed,"
1092,VIII,"Anemones and clouds,"
1093,VIII,Raindrops and tender distances
1094,VIII,"Above, beneath,"
1095,VIII,Inherit and bequeath
1096,VIII,Our far-begotten beauty. We are wed
1097,VIII,With many kindred who were seeming dead.
1098,VIII,Only the delicate woven shrouds
1099,VIII,"Are vanished, beauty thrown aside"
1100,VIII,To honor and uncover
1101,VIII,A deeper beauty--as the veil that slips
1102,VIII,Breathless away between a lover
1103,VIII,And his bride.
1104,VIII,
1105,VIII,"So, by the body, may the soul surmise"
1106,VIII,"The beauty of surrender, the tranquillity"
1107,VIII,"Of fusion: when, set free"
1108,VIII,"From semblance of mortality,"
1109,VIII,Yielding its dust the richer to endue
1110,VIII,A common avenue
1111,VIII,"Of earth for other souls to journey through,"
1112,VIII,It shall put on in purer guise
1113,VIII,The mutual beauty of its destiny.
1114,VIII,And who shall fear for his identity
1115,VIII,And who shall cling to the poor privacy
1116,VIII,"Of incompleteness, when the end explains"
1117,VIII,"That what pride forfeits, beauty gains!"
1118,VIII,"Therefore, O spirit, as a runner strips"
1119,VIII,"Upon a windy afternoon,"
1120,VIII,Be unencumbered of what troubles you--
1121,VIII,Arise with grace
1122,VIII,And greatly go!--the wind upon your face!
1123,VIII,
1124,VIII,Grieve not for the invisible transported brow
1125,VIII,"On which like leaves the dark hair grew,"
1126,VIII,Nor for the lips of laughter that are now
1127,VIII,"Laughing inaudibly in sun and dew,"
1128,VIII,"Nor for the limbs that, fallen low"
1129,VIII,"And seeming faint and slow,"
1130,VIII,Shall alter and renew
1131,VIII,Their shape and hue
1132,VIII,Like birches white before the moon
1133,VIII,Or a young apple-tree
1134,VIII,In spring or the round sea
1135,VIII,And shall pursue
1136,VIII,More ways of swiftness than the swallow dips
1137,VIII,Among ... and find more winds than ever blew
1138,VIII,The straining sails of unimpeded ships!
1139,VIII,
1140,VIII,"A sudden music, Celia, through a poplar-bough,"
1141,VIII,"Where leaves are small and new,"
1142,VIII,Comes laughing and goes hastening like you.
1143,VIII,
1144,VIII,Beauty is more than hands or face or eyes
1145,VIII,Or the long curve that lies
1146,VIII,"Upon a bed waiting, more than the rise"
1147,VIII,"Of sun among the birds, more than the oar that plies"
1148,VIII,"Under the moon for lovers, more than a tune that buys"
1149,VIII,Pennies from time. Vision and touch comprise
1150,VIII,"Yesterday's promise, today's token"
1151,VIII,"Of a fulfillment that shall have no need to be perceived or spoken,"
1152,VIII,Wherein all love is the award
1153,VIII,Poured upon beauty and no heart is broken
1154,VIII,And no grief is stored.
1155,VIII,
1156,VIII,For never beauty dies
1157,VIII,That lived. Nightly the skies
1158,VIII,"Assemble stars, the light of hopeful eyes,"
1159,VIII,And daily brood on the communal breath--
1160,VIII,Which we call death.
1161,VIII,Nothing is lost. Nothing I have of loveliness
1162,VIII,Exceeds a minute part
1163,VIII,Of my own loveliness when it shall be fulfilled
1164,VIII,With Celia's and all loveliness that lies
1165,VIII,In every heart.
1166,VIII,All that I have is but the start
1167,VIII,"And the beginning, the bewildering guess"
1168,VIII,Of what shall be distilled
1169,VIII,"Out of my soul by you and you,"
1170,VIII,"Each soul of all souls, till one soul remains"
1171,VIII,Which every beauty shall imbue
1172,VIII,Clean of the differences and pains....
1173,VIII,I shall be Celia's everlastingness.
1174,VIII,
1175,VIII,
1176,IX,IX
1177,IX,
1178,IX,A little hill among New Hampshire hills
1179,IX,Touches more stars than any height I know.
1180,IX,For there the whole earth--like a single being--fills
1181,IX,And expands with heaven.
1182,IX,It is the hill where Celia used to go
1183,IX,To watch Monadnock and the miles that met
1184,IX,In slow-ascending slopes of peace.
1185,IX,"She said: ""When I am here, I find release"
1186,IX,"From every petty debt I owe,"
1187,IX,"The goods I bring with me increase,"
1188,IX,The ills are riven
1189,IX,And blown away. And there remains a single debt
1190,IX,"Toward all the world for me,"
1191,IX,"A single duty and one destiny."""
1192,IX,"""There shall be many births of God"
1193,IX,"In this humanity,"""
1194,IX,"She said, ""and many crucifixions on the hills,"
1195,IX,Before we learn that where Christ trod
1196,IX,We all shall tread; and as he died to give
1197,IX,"Himself to us, we too shall die--and live."""
1198,IX,"""Though slowly knowledge comes, yet in the birth"
1199,IX,"Is joy,"" said Celia, ""joy"
1200,IX,As well as pain:
1201,IX,The clear and clouded beauty of the earth.
1202,IX,.... This I forget in cities. For cities are a great
1203,IX,Impassable gate
1204,IX,Of tumult. But by mountains and by seas I gain
1205,IX,"Path after path of peace."""
1206,IX,
1207,IX,"One evening Celia led me, late,"
1208,IX,"Among the many whispers before rain,"
1209,IX,To touch and climb her hill again.
1210,IX,"I felt it rise invisible as fate,"
1211,IX,Not for the eye but for the soul to see.
1212,IX,"And when at last, among the oaks, we came"
1213,IX,"Upon the top, a perfect voice"
1214,IX,Thrilled in the air like flame--
1215,IX,Was it uprisen death we heard?
1216,IX,"Was it immortal youth,"
1217,IX,"Out of the body, witnessing the truth,"
1218,IX,Attesting glory in an angel's voice?
1219,IX,Blindly we listened to the singer and the single strain
1220,IX,Containing joy.
1221,IX,And then the voice was still and all the world and we--
1222,IX,"Till ""Run,"" she said, ""and bring him back to me!"""
1223,IX,"I ran, I called ... but in the nearing rain,"
1224,IX,"No mortal answered, nothing stirred."
1225,IX,Was it uprisen death we heard?
1226,IX,.... Perhaps the hills and night
1227,IX,"Had made a prophet of some wandering boy,"
1228,IX,Prompting him in that instant to rejoice
1229,IX,As never in his life before.
1230,IX,He must have had his own delight
1231,IX,As well in silence as in song;
1232,IX,"For, though we waited long,"
1233,IX,He sang no more.
1234,IX,
1235,IX,"Afterward Celia said: ""That voice we heard"
1236,IX,"Singing among the oak-leaves, and then still,"
1237,IX,We cannot answer how it sings or how it comes and goes....
1238,IX,But only that its beauty ever grows
1239,IX,"Within us both, in ways no voice has told."
1240,IX,.... So let me be to you. When night has drawn its fold
1241,IX,Of darkness and no word
1242,IX,"May reach your heart from mine,"
1243,IX,"Take then my love, my beauty! Hear me still"
1244,IX,When you are old
1245,IX,And I am ageless as a changing hill!
1246,IX,"O hear me like that voice at night,"
1247,IX,"Clearer than sound, nearer than sight,"
1248,IX,"And let me be--as beauty is--divine!"""
1249,IX,
1250,IX,There is a hill of hills
1251,IX,That holds my heart on high and stills
1252,IX,All other sound
1253,IX,Than joy.
1254,IX,"Robins and thrushes, whip-poor-wills"
1255,IX,And morning-sparrows sing it round
1256,IX,With echoes. Waterfalls abound
1257,IX,And many streams convoy
1258,IX,The breath of music. I have found
1259,IX,"A hill-path rising sudden on a city-street,"
1260,IX,"Out of a quarrel, out of black despair,"
1261,IX,And climbed it with my winged feet.
1262,IX,It hurries me above
1263,IX,"All this illusion, all these ills,"
1264,IX,It rises quickly to the shining air.
1265,IX,".... Celia, I hear you on the hill of hills,"
1266,IX,Announcing love.
1267,IX,
1268,IX,"And O my citizen, perhaps the few"
1269,IX,Whom I shall tell of you
1270,IX,"Will see with me your beauty who are dead,"
1271,IX,Will hear with me your voice and what it said!
1272,IX,"Let but a line of mine,"
1273,IX,"A single one,"
1274,IX,Be made to shine
1275,IX,"With your whole-heartedness as with the sun,"
1276,IX,And I shall so consign
1277,IX,"Your touch to younger and yet younger hands,"
1278,IX,That they shall carry beauty through more lands
1279,IX,Than ever Helen laid her touch upon.
1280,IX,
1281,IX,In your new world I see
1282,IX,The immigrants arriving from the ships....
1283,IX,"O Celia, my democracy,"
1284,IX,"My destiny,"
1285,IX,Beauty has had its answer on your lips!
1286,IX,
1287,IX,
1288,IX,
1289,IX,
1290,IX,
