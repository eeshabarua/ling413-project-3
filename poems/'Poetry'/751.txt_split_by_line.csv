41,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
42,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
43,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,The interruption referred to in the first sentence of the first of these
44,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,papers was just a quarter of a century in duration.
45,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
46,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"Two articles entitled ""The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table"" will be found"
47,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"in the ""New England Magazine,"" formerly published in Boston by J. T. and"
48,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"E. Buckingham.  The date of the first of these articles is November 1831,"
49,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"and that of the second February 1832.  When ""The Atlantic Monthly"" was"
50,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"begun, twenty-five years afterwards, and the author was asked to write"
51,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"for it, the recollection of these crude products of his uncombed literary"
52,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,boyhood suggested the thought that it would be a curious experiment to
53,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"shake the same bough again, and see if the ripe fruit were better or"
54,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,worse than the early windfalls.
55,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
56,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"So began this series of papers, which naturally brings those earlier"
57,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,attempts to my own notice and that of some few friends who were idle
58,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,enough to read them at the time of their publication.  The man is father
59,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"to the boy that was, and I am my own son, as it seems to me, in those"
60,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,papers of the New England Magazine.  If I find it hard to pardon the
61,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"boy's faults, others would find it harder.  They will not, therefore, be"
62,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"reprinted here, nor as I hope, anywhere."
63,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
64,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"But a sentence or two from them will perhaps bear reproducing, and with"
65,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"these I trust the gentle reader, if that kind being still breathes, will"
66,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,be contented.
67,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
68,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"--""It is a capital plan to carry a tablet with you, and, when you"
69,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"find yourself felicitous, take notes of your own conversation.""--"
70,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
71,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"--""When I feel inclined to read poetry I take down my Dictionary."
72,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,The poetry of words is quite as beautiful as that of sentences.  The
73,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"author may arrange the gems effectively, but their fhape and luftre"
74,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,have been given by the attrition of ages.  Bring me the fineft fimile
75,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"from the whole range of imaginative writing, and I will fhow you a"
76,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"fingle word which conveys a more profound, a more accurate, and a"
77,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"more eloquent analogy.""--"
78,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
79,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"--""Once on a time, a notion was ftarted, that if all the people in"
80,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"the world would fhout at once, it might be heard in the moon.  So the"
81,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,projectors agreed it fhould be done in juft ten years.  Some thousand
82,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,fhip-loads of chronometers were diftributed to the selectmen and
83,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,other great folks of all the different nations.  For a year
84,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"beforehand, nothing else was talked about but the awful noise that"
85,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"was to be made on the great occafion.  When the time came, everybody"
86,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"had their ears so wide open, to hear the universal ejaculation of"
87,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"BOO,--the word agreed upon,--that nobody spoke except a deaf man in"
88,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"one of the Fejee Islands, and a woman in Pekin, so that the world was"
89,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"never so ftill fince the creation.""--"
90,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
91,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,There was nothing better than these things and there was not a little
92,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,that was much worse.  A young fellow of two or three and twenty has as
93,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"good a right to spoil a magazine-full of essays in learning how to write,"
94,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,as an oculist like Wenzel had to spoil his hat-full of eyes in learning
95,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"how to operate for cataract, or an _elegant_ like Brummel to point to an"
96,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,armful of failures in the attempt to achieve a perfect tie.  This son of
97,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"mine, whom I have not seen for these twenty-five years, generously"
98,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"counted, was a self-willed youth, always too ready to utter his"
99,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"unchastised fancies.  He, like too many American young people, got the"
100,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,spur when he should have had the rein.  He therefore helped to fill the
101,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,market with that unripe fruit which his father says in one of these
102,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,papers abounds in the marts of his native country.  All these by-gone
103,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"shortcomings he would hope are forgiven, did he not feel sure that very"
104,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,few of his readers know anything about them.  In taking the old name for
105,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"the new papers, he felt bound to say that he had uttered unwise things"
106,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"under that title, and if it shall appear that his unwisdom has not"
107,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"diminished by at least half while his years have doubled, he promises not"
108,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,to repeat the experiment if he should live to double them again and
109,THE AUTOCRAT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY,become his own grandfather.

119,CHAPTER I,
120,CHAPTER I,
121,CHAPTER I,"I was just going to say, when I was interrupted, that one of the many"
122,CHAPTER I,ways of classifying minds is under the heads of arithmetical and
123,CHAPTER I,algebraical intellects.  All economical and practical wisdom is an
124,CHAPTER I,extension or variation of the following arithmetical formula: 2+2=4.
125,CHAPTER I,Every philosophical proposition has the more general character of the
126,CHAPTER I,"expression _a+b=c_.  We are mere operatives, empirics, and egotists,"
127,CHAPTER I,until we learn to think in letters instead of figures.
128,CHAPTER I,
129,CHAPTER I,They all stared.  There is a divinity student lately come among us to
130,CHAPTER I,"whom I commonly address remarks like the above, allowing him to take a"
131,CHAPTER I,"certain share in the conversation, so far as assent or pertinent"
132,CHAPTER I,questions are involved.  He abused his liberty on this occasion by
133,CHAPTER I,"presuming to say that Leibnitz had the same observation.--No, sir, I"
134,CHAPTER I,"replied, he has not.  But he said a mighty good thing about mathematics,"
135,CHAPTER I,"that sounds something like it, and you found it, _not in the original_,"
136,CHAPTER I,"but quoted by Dr. Thomas Reid.  I will tell the company what he did say,"
137,CHAPTER I,one of these days.
138,CHAPTER I,
139,CHAPTER I,--If I belong to a Society of Mutual Admiration?--I blush to say that I
140,CHAPTER I,"do not at this present moment.  I once did, however.  It was the first"
141,CHAPTER I,association to which I ever heard the term applied; a body of scientific
142,CHAPTER I,"young men in a great foreign city who admired their teacher, and to some"
143,CHAPTER I,extent each other.  Many of them deserved it; they have become famous
144,CHAPTER I,since.  It amuses me to hear the talk of one of those beings described by
145,CHAPTER I,Thackeray--
146,CHAPTER I,
147,CHAPTER I,"""Letters four do form his name""--"
148,CHAPTER I,
149,CHAPTER I,about a social development which belongs to the very noblest stage of
150,CHAPTER I,"civilization.  All generous companies of artists, authors,"
151,CHAPTER I,"philanthropists, men of science, are, or ought to be, Societies of Mutual"
152,CHAPTER I,"Admiration.  A man of genius, or any kind of superiority, is not debarred"
153,CHAPTER I,"from admiring the same quality in another, nor the other from returning"
154,CHAPTER I,his admiration.  They may even associate together and continue to think
155,CHAPTER I,"highly of each other.  And so of a dozen such men, if any one place is"
156,CHAPTER I,fortunate enough to hold so many.  The being referred to above assumes
157,CHAPTER I,"several false premises.  First, that men of talent necessarily hate each"
158,CHAPTER I,"other.  Secondly, that intimate knowledge or habitual association"
159,CHAPTER I,destroys our admiration of persons whom we esteemed highly at a distance.
160,CHAPTER I,"Thirdly, that a circle of clever fellows, who meet together to dine and"
161,CHAPTER I,"have a good time, have signed a constitutional compact to glorify"
162,CHAPTER I,themselves and to put down him and the fraction of the human race not
163,CHAPTER I,"belonging to their number.  Fourthly, that it is an outrage that he is"
164,CHAPTER I,not asked to join them.
165,CHAPTER I,
166,CHAPTER I,[Picture: The Old Gentleman Opposite]
167,CHAPTER I,
168,CHAPTER I,"Here the company laughed a good deal, and the old gentleman who sits"
169,CHAPTER I,"opposite said, ""That's it! that's it!"""
170,CHAPTER I,
171,CHAPTER I,"I continued, for I was in the talking vein.  As to clever people's hating"
172,CHAPTER I,"each other, I think a _little_ extra talent does sometimes make people"
173,CHAPTER I,"jealous.  They become irritated by perpetual attempts and failures, and"
174,CHAPTER I,it hurts their tempers and dispositions.  Unpretending mediocrity is
175,CHAPTER I,"good, and genius is glorious; but a weak flavor of genius in an"
176,CHAPTER I,essentially common person is detestable.  It spoils the grand neutrality
177,CHAPTER I,"of a commonplace character, as the rinsings of an unwashed wineglass"
178,CHAPTER I,"spoil a draught of fair water.  No wonder the poor fellow we spoke of,"
179,CHAPTER I,"who always belongs to this class of slightly flavored mediocrities, is"
180,CHAPTER I,puzzled and vexed by the strange sight of a dozen men of capacity working
181,CHAPTER I,and playing together in harmony.  He and his fellows are always fighting.
182,CHAPTER I,With them familiarity naturally breeds contempt.  If they ever praise
183,CHAPTER I,"each other's bad drawings, or broken-winded novels, or spavined verses,"
184,CHAPTER I,nobody ever supposed it was from admiration; it was simply a contract
185,CHAPTER I,between themselves and a publisher or dealer.
186,CHAPTER I,
187,CHAPTER I,"If the Mutuals have really nothing among them worth admiring, that alters"
188,CHAPTER I,"the question.  But if they are men with noble powers and qualities, let"
189,CHAPTER I,"me tell you, that, next to youthful love and family affections, there is"
190,CHAPTER I,no human sentiment better than that which unites the Societies of Mutual
191,CHAPTER I,Admiration.  And what would literature or art be without such
192,CHAPTER I,associations?  Who can tell what we owe to the Mutual Admiration Society
193,CHAPTER I,"of which Shakspeare, and Ben Jonson, and Beaumont and Fletcher were"
194,CHAPTER I,"members?  Or to that of which Addison and Steele formed the centre, and"
195,CHAPTER I,"which gave us the Spectator?  Or to that where Johnson, and Goldsmith,"
196,CHAPTER I,"and Burke, and Reynolds, and Beauclerk, and Boswell, most admiring among"
197,CHAPTER I,"all admirers, met together?  Was there any great harm in the fact that"
198,CHAPTER I,the Irvings and Paulding wrote in company? or any unpardonable cabal in
199,CHAPTER I,"the literary union of Verplanck and Bryant and Sands, and as many more as"
200,CHAPTER I,they chose to associate with them?
201,CHAPTER I,
202,CHAPTER I,"The poor creature does not know what he is talking about, when he abuses"
203,CHAPTER I,this noblest of institutions.  Let him inspect its mysteries through the
204,CHAPTER I,"knot-hole he has secured, but not use that orifice as a medium for his"
205,CHAPTER I,popgun.  Such a society is the crown of a literary metropolis; if a town
206,CHAPTER I,"has not material for it, and spirit and good feeling enough to organize"
207,CHAPTER I,"it, it is a mere caravansary, fit for a man of genius to lodge in, but"
208,CHAPTER I,not to live in.  Foolish people hate and dread and envy such an
209,CHAPTER I,"association of men of varied powers and influence, because it is lofty,"
210,CHAPTER I,"serene, impregnable, and, by the necessity of the case, exclusive.  Wise"
211,CHAPTER I,ones are prouder of the title M. S. M. A. than of all their other honors
212,CHAPTER I,put together.
213,CHAPTER I,
214,CHAPTER I,"--All generous minds have a horror of what are commonly called ""facts."""
215,CHAPTER I,They are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain.  Who does not know
216,CHAPTER I,fellows that always have an ill-conditioned fact or two which they lead
217,CHAPTER I,"after them into decent company like so many bull-dogs, ready to let them"
218,CHAPTER I,"slip at every ingenious suggestion, or convenient generalization, or"
219,CHAPTER I,"pleasant fancy?  I allow no ""facts"" at this table.  What!  Because bread"
220,CHAPTER I,"is good and wholesome and necessary and nourishing, shall you thrust a"
221,CHAPTER I,crumb into my windpipe while I am talking?  Do not these muscles of mine
222,CHAPTER I,represent a hundred loaves of bread? and is not my thought the abstract
223,CHAPTER I,of ten thousand of these crumbs of truth with which you would choke off
224,CHAPTER I,my speech?
225,CHAPTER I,
226,CHAPTER I,[The above remark must be conditioned and qualified for the vulgar mind.
227,CHAPTER I,The reader will of course understand the precise amount of seasoning
228,CHAPTER I,which must be added to it before he adopts it as one of the axioms of his
229,CHAPTER I,life.  The speaker disclaims all responsibility for its abuse in
230,CHAPTER I,incompetent hands.]
231,CHAPTER I,
232,CHAPTER I,This business of conversation is a very serious matter.  There are men
233,CHAPTER I,that it weakens one to talk with an hour more than a day's fasting would
234,CHAPTER I,"do.  Mark this that I am going to say, for it is as good as a working"
235,CHAPTER I,"professional man's advice, and costs you nothing: It is better to lose a"
236,CHAPTER I,pint of blood from your veins than to have a nerve tapped.  Nobody
237,CHAPTER I,"measures your nervous force as it runs away, nor bandages your brain and"
238,CHAPTER I,marrow after the operation.
239,CHAPTER I,
240,CHAPTER I,There are men of _esprit_ who are excessively exhausting to some people.
241,CHAPTER I,They are the talkers who have what may be called _jerky_ minds.  Their
242,CHAPTER I,thoughts do not run in the natural order of sequence.  They say bright
243,CHAPTER I,"things on all possible subjects, but their zigzags rack you to death."
244,CHAPTER I,"After a jolting half-hour with one of these jerky companions, talking"
245,CHAPTER I,with a dull friend affords great relief.  It is like taking the cat in
246,CHAPTER I,your lap after holding a squirrel.
247,CHAPTER I,
248,CHAPTER I,"What a comfort a dull but kindly person is, to be sure, at times!  A"
249,CHAPTER I,ground-glass shade over a gas-lamp does not bring more solace to our
250,CHAPTER I,dazzled eyes than such a one to our minds.
251,CHAPTER I,
252,CHAPTER I,"""Do not dull people bore you?"" said one of the lady-boarders,--the same"
253,CHAPTER I,that sent me her autograph-book last week with a request for a few
254,CHAPTER I,"original stanzas, not remembering that ""The Pactolian"" pays me five"
255,CHAPTER I,dollars a line for every thing I write in its columns.
256,CHAPTER I,
257,CHAPTER I,"""Madam,"" said I, (she and the century were in their teens together,) ""all"
258,CHAPTER I,"men are bores, except when we want them.  There never was but one man"
259,CHAPTER I,"whom I would trust with my latch-key."""
260,CHAPTER I,
261,CHAPTER I,"""Who might that favored person be?"""
262,CHAPTER I,
263,CHAPTER I,"""Zimmermann."""
264,CHAPTER I,
265,CHAPTER I,--The men of genius that I fancy most have erectile heads like the
266,CHAPTER I,"cobra-di-capello.  You remember what they tell of William Pinkney, the"
267,CHAPTER I,great pleader; how in his eloquent paroxysms the veins of his neck would
268,CHAPTER I,"swell and his face flush and his eyes glitter, until he seemed on the"
269,CHAPTER I,verge of apoplexy.  The hydraulic arrangements for supplying the brain
270,CHAPTER I,with blood are only second in importance to its own organization.  The
271,CHAPTER I,bulbous-headed fellows that steam well when they are at work are the men
272,CHAPTER I,that draw big audiences and give us marrowy books and pictures.  It is a
273,CHAPTER I,good sign to have one's feet grow cold when he is writing.  A great
274,CHAPTER I,writer and speaker once told me that he often wrote with his feet in hot
275,CHAPTER I,"water; but for this, _all_ his blood would have run into his head, as the"
276,CHAPTER I,mercury sometimes withdraws into the ball of a thermometer.
277,CHAPTER I,
278,CHAPTER I,--You don't suppose that my remarks made at this table are like so many
279,CHAPTER I,"postage-stamps, do you,--each to be only once uttered?  If you do, you"
280,CHAPTER I,are mistaken.  He must be a poor creature that does not often repeat
281,CHAPTER I,"himself.  Imagine the author of the excellent piece of advice, ""Know"
282,CHAPTER I,"thyself,"" never alluding to that sentiment again during the course of a"
283,CHAPTER I,"protracted existence!  Why, the truths a man carries about with him are"
284,CHAPTER I,his tools; and do you think a carpenter is bound to use the same plane
285,CHAPTER I,"but once to smooth a knotty board with, or to hang up his hammer after it"
286,CHAPTER I,"has driven its first nail?  I shall never repeat a conversation, but an"
287,CHAPTER I,"idea often.  I shall use the same types when I like, but not commonly the"
288,CHAPTER I,"same stereotypes.  A thought is often original, though you have uttered"
289,CHAPTER I,"it a hundred times.  It has come to you over a new route, by a new and"
290,CHAPTER I,express train of associations.
291,CHAPTER I,
292,CHAPTER I,"Sometimes, but rarely, one may be caught making the same speech twice"
293,CHAPTER I,"over, and yet be held blameless.  Thus, a certain lecturer, after"
294,CHAPTER I,"performing in an inland city, where dwells a _Litteratrice_ of note, was"
295,CHAPTER I,invited to meet her and others over the social teacup.  She pleasantly
296,CHAPTER I,"referred to his many wanderings in his new occupation.  ""Yes,"" he"
297,CHAPTER I,"replied, ""I am like the Huma, the bird that never lights, being always in"
298,CHAPTER I,"the cars, as he is always on the wing.""--Years elapsed.  The lecturer"
299,CHAPTER I,visited the same place once more for the same purpose.  Another social
300,CHAPTER I,"cup after the lecture, and a second meeting with the distinguished lady."
301,CHAPTER I,"""You are constantly going from place to place,"" she said.--""Yes,"" he"
302,CHAPTER I,"answered, ""I am like the Huma,""--and finished the sentence as before."
303,CHAPTER I,
304,CHAPTER I,"What horrors, when it flashed over him that he had made this fine speech,"
305,CHAPTER I,"word for word, twice over!  Yet it was not true, as the lady might"
306,CHAPTER I,"perhaps have fairly inferred, that he had embellished his conversation"
307,CHAPTER I,with the Huma daily during that whole interval of years.  On the
308,CHAPTER I,"contrary, he had never once thought of the odious fowl until the"
309,CHAPTER I,recurrence of precisely the same circumstances brought up precisely the
310,CHAPTER I,same idea.  He ought to have been proud of the accuracy of his mental
311,CHAPTER I,"adjustments.  Given certain factors, and a sound brain should always"
312,CHAPTER I,evolve the same fixed product with the certainty of Babbage's calculating
313,CHAPTER I,machine.
314,CHAPTER I,
315,CHAPTER I,"--What a satire, by the way, is that machine on the mere mathematician!"
316,CHAPTER I,"A Frankenstein-monster, a thing without brains and without heart, too"
317,CHAPTER I,"stupid to make a blunder; that turns out results like a corn-sheller, and"
318,CHAPTER I,"never grows any wiser or better, though it grind a thousand bushels of"
319,CHAPTER I,them!
320,CHAPTER I,
321,CHAPTER I,"I have an immense respect for a man of talents _plus_ ""the mathematics."""
322,CHAPTER I,But the calculating power alone should seem to be the least human of
323,CHAPTER I,"qualities, and to have the smallest amount of reason in it; since a"
324,CHAPTER I,"machine can be made to do the work of three or four calculators, and"
325,CHAPTER I,better than any one of them.  Sometimes I have been troubled that I had
326,CHAPTER I,not a deeper intuitive apprehension of the relations of numbers.  But the
327,CHAPTER I,triumph of the ciphering hand-organ has consoled me.  I always fancy I
328,CHAPTER I,can hear the wheels clicking in a calculator's brain.  The power of
329,CHAPTER I,"dealing with numbers is a kind of ""detached lever"" arrangement, which may"
330,CHAPTER I,be put into a mighty poor watch--I suppose it is about as common as the
331,CHAPTER I,"power of moving the ears voluntarily, which is a moderately rare"
332,CHAPTER I,endowment.
333,CHAPTER I,
334,CHAPTER I,"--Little localized powers, and little narrow streaks of specialized"
335,CHAPTER I,"knowledge, are things men are very apt to be conceited about.  Nature is"
336,CHAPTER I,very wise; but for this encouraging principle how many small talents and
337,CHAPTER I,little accomplishments would be neglected!  Talk about conceit as much as
338,CHAPTER I,"you like, it is to human character what salt is to the ocean; it keeps it"
339,CHAPTER I,"sweet, and renders it endurable.  Say rather it is like the natural"
340,CHAPTER I,"unguent of the sea-fowl's plumage, which enables him to shed the rain"
341,CHAPTER I,that falls on him and the wave in which he dips.  When one has had _all_
342,CHAPTER I,"his conceit taken out of him, when he has lost _all_ his illusions, his"
343,CHAPTER I,"feathers will soon soak through, and he will fly no more."
344,CHAPTER I,
345,CHAPTER I,"""So you admire conceited people, do you?"" said the young lady who has"
346,CHAPTER I,come to the city to be finished off for--the duties of life.
347,CHAPTER I,
348,CHAPTER I,"I am afraid you do not study logic at your school, my dear.  It does not"
349,CHAPTER I,follow that I wish to be pickled in brine because I like a salt-water
350,CHAPTER I,plunge at Nahant.  I say that conceit is just as natural a thing to human
351,CHAPTER I,minds as a centre is to a circle.  But little-minded people's thoughts
352,CHAPTER I,move in such small circles that five minutes' conversation gives you an
353,CHAPTER I,arc long enough to determine their whole curve.  An arc in the movement
354,CHAPTER I,of a large intellect does not sensibly differ from a straight line.  Even
355,CHAPTER I,"if it have the third vowel as its centre, it does not soon betray it."
356,CHAPTER I,"The highest thought, that is, is the most seemingly impersonal; it does"
357,CHAPTER I,not obviously imply any individual centre.
358,CHAPTER I,
359,CHAPTER I,"Audacious self-esteem, with good ground for it, is always imposing.  What"
360,CHAPTER I,resplendent beauty that must have been which could have authorized Phryne
361,CHAPTER I,"to ""peel"" in the way she did!  What fine speeches are those two: ""_Non"
362,CHAPTER I,"omnis mortar_,"" and ""I have taken all knowledge to be my province""!  Even"
363,CHAPTER I,"in common people, conceit has the virtue of making them cheerful; the man"
364,CHAPTER I,"who thinks his wife, his baby, his house, his horse, his dog, and himself"
365,CHAPTER I,"severally unequalled, is almost sure to be a good-humored person, though"
366,CHAPTER I,liable to be tedious at times.
367,CHAPTER I,
368,CHAPTER I,"--What are the great faults of conversation?  Want of ideas, want of"
369,CHAPTER I,"words, want of manners, are the principal ones, I suppose you think.  I"
370,CHAPTER I,"don't doubt it, but I will tell you what I have found spoil more good"
371,CHAPTER I,talks than anything else;--long arguments on special points between
372,CHAPTER I,people who differ on the fundamental principles upon which these points
373,CHAPTER I,depend.  No men can have satisfactory relations with each other until
374,CHAPTER I,they have agreed on certain _ultimata_ of belief not to be disturbed in
375,CHAPTER I,"ordinary conversation, and unless they have sense enough to trace the"
376,CHAPTER I,secondary questions depending upon these ultimate beliefs to their
377,CHAPTER I,"source.  In short, just as a written constitution is essential to the"
378,CHAPTER I,"best social order, so a code of finalities is a necessary condition of"
379,CHAPTER I,profitable talk between two persons.  Talking is like playing on the
380,CHAPTER I,harp; there is as much in laying the hand on the strings to stop their
381,CHAPTER I,vibrations as in twanging them to bring out their music.
382,CHAPTER I,
383,CHAPTER I,--Do you mean to say the pun-question is not clearly settled in your
384,CHAPTER I,minds?  Let me lay down the law upon the subject.  Life and language are
385,CHAPTER I,"alike sacred.  Homicide and _verbicide_--that is, violent treatment of a"
386,CHAPTER I,"word with fatal results to its legitimate meaning, which is its life--are"
387,CHAPTER I,"alike forbidden.  Manslaughter, which is the meaning of the one, is the"
388,CHAPTER I,"same as man's laughter, which is the end of the other.  A pun is _prima"
389,CHAPTER I,facie_ an insult to the person you are talking with.  It implies utter
390,CHAPTER I,"indifference to or sublime contempt for his remarks, no matter how"
391,CHAPTER I,"serious.  I speak of total depravity, and one says all that is written on"
392,CHAPTER I,the subject is deep raving.  I have committed my self-respect by talking
393,CHAPTER I,"with such a person.  I should like to commit him, but cannot, because he"
394,CHAPTER I,"is a nuisance.  Or I speak of geological convulsions, and he asks me what"
395,CHAPTER I,"was the cosine of Noah's ark; also, whether the Deluge was not a deal"
396,CHAPTER I,huger than any modern inundation.
397,CHAPTER I,
398,CHAPTER I,A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return.  But if a blow were
399,CHAPTER I,"given for such cause, and death ensued, the jury would be judges both of"
400,CHAPTER I,"the facts and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an aggravated"
401,CHAPTER I,"character, return a verdict of justifiable homicide.  Thus, in a case"
402,CHAPTER I,"lately decided before Miller, J., Doe presented Roe a subscription paper,"
403,CHAPTER I,"and urged the claims of suffering humanity.  Roe replied by asking, When"
404,CHAPTER I,charity was like a top?  It was in evidence that Doe preserved a
405,CHAPTER I,"dignified silence.  Roe then said, ""When it begins to hum.""  Doe"
406,CHAPTER I,"then--and not till then--struck Roe, and his head happening to hit a"
407,CHAPTER I,"bound volume of the Monthly Rag-bag and Stolen Miscellany, intense"
408,CHAPTER I,"mortification ensued, with a fatal result.  The chief laid down his"
409,CHAPTER I,"notions of the law to his brother justices, who unanimously replied,"
410,CHAPTER I,"""Jest so.""  The chief rejoined, that no man should jest so without being"
411,CHAPTER I,"punished for it, and charged for the prisoner, who was acquitted, and the"
412,CHAPTER I,pun ordered to be burned by the sheriff.  The bound volume was forfeited
413,CHAPTER I,"as a deodand, but not claimed."
414,CHAPTER I,
415,CHAPTER I,People that make puns are like wanton boys that put coppers on the
416,CHAPTER I,"railroad tracks.  They amuse themselves and other children, but their"
417,CHAPTER I,little trick may upset a freight train of conversation for the sake of a
418,CHAPTER I,battered witticism.
419,CHAPTER I,
420,CHAPTER I,"I will thank you, B. F., to bring down two books, of which I will mark"
421,CHAPTER I,"the places on this slip of paper.  (While he is gone, I may say that this"
422,CHAPTER I,"boy, our land-lady's youngest, is called BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, after the"
423,CHAPTER I,celebrated philosopher of that name.  A highly merited compliment.)
424,CHAPTER I,
425,CHAPTER I,I wished to refer to two eminent authorities.  Now be so good as to
426,CHAPTER I,"listen.  The great moralist says: ""To trifle with the vocabulary which is"
427,CHAPTER I,the vehicle of social intercourse is to tamper with the currency of human
428,CHAPTER I,intelligence.  He who would violate the sanctities of his mother tongue
429,CHAPTER I,"would invade the recesses of the paternal till without remorse, and"
430,CHAPTER I,"repeat the banquet of Saturn without an indigestion."""
431,CHAPTER I,
432,CHAPTER I,"And, once more, listen to the historian.  ""The Puritans hated puns.  The"
433,CHAPTER I,Bishops were notoriously addicted to them.  The Lords Temporal carried
434,CHAPTER I,them to the verge of license.  Majesty itself must have its Royal
435,CHAPTER I,"quibble.  'Ye be burly, my Lord of Burleigh,' said Queen Elizabeth, 'but"
436,CHAPTER I,ye shall make less stir in our realm than my Lord of Leicester.'  The
437,CHAPTER I,gravest wisdom and the highest breeding lent their sanction to the
438,CHAPTER I,"practice.  Lord Bacon playfully declared himself a descendant of 'Og, the"
439,CHAPTER I,"King of Bashan.  Sir Philip Sidney, with his last breath, reproached the"
440,CHAPTER I,"soldier who brought him water, for wasting a casque full upon a dying"
441,CHAPTER I,"man.  A courtier, who saw Othello performed at the Globe Theatre,"
442,CHAPTER I,"remarked, that the blackamoor was a brute, and not a man.  'Thou hast"
443,CHAPTER I,"reason,' replied a great Lord, 'according to Plato his saying; for this"
444,CHAPTER I,be a two-legged animal _with_ feathers.'  The fatal habit became
445,CHAPTER I,universal.  The language was corrupted.  The infection spread to the
446,CHAPTER I,national conscience.  Political double-dealings naturally grew out of
447,CHAPTER I,verbal double meanings.  The teeth of the new dragon were sown by the
448,CHAPTER I,Cadmus who introduced the alphabet of equivocation.  What was levity in
449,CHAPTER I,the time of the Tudors grew to regicide and revolution in the age of the
450,CHAPTER I,"Stuarts."""
451,CHAPTER I,
452,CHAPTER I,Who was that boarder that just whispered something about the
453,CHAPTER I,Macaulay-flowers of literature?--There was a dead silence.--I said
454,CHAPTER I,"calmly, I shall henceforth consider any interruption by a pun as a hint"
455,CHAPTER I,to change my boarding-house.  Do not plead my example.  If _I_ have used
456,CHAPTER I,"any such, it has been only as a Spartan father would show up a drunken"
457,CHAPTER I,helot.  We have done with them.
458,CHAPTER I,
459,CHAPTER I,--If a logical mind ever found out anything with its logic?--I should say
460,CHAPTER I,that its most frequent work was to build a _pons asinorum_ over chasms
461,CHAPTER I,which shrewd people can bestride without such a structure.  You can hire
462,CHAPTER I,"logic, in the shape of a lawyer, to prove anything that you want to"
463,CHAPTER I,"prove.  You can buy treatises to show that Napoleon never lived, and that"
464,CHAPTER I,no battle of Bunker-hill was ever fought.  The great minds are those with
465,CHAPTER I,"a wide span, which couple truths related to, but far removed from, each"
466,CHAPTER I,other.  Logicians carry the surveyor's chain over the track of which
467,CHAPTER I,these are the true explorers.  I value a man mainly for his primary
468,CHAPTER I,"relations with truth, as I understand truth,--not for any secondary"
469,CHAPTER I,artifice in handling his ideas.  Some of the sharpest men in argument are
470,CHAPTER I,notoriously unsound in judgment.  I should not trust the counsel of a
471,CHAPTER I,"smart debater, any more than that of a good chess-player.  Either may of"
472,CHAPTER I,"course advise wisely, but not necessarily because he wrangles or plays"
473,CHAPTER I,well.
474,CHAPTER I,
475,CHAPTER I,"The old gentleman who sits opposite got his hand up, as a pointer lifts"
476,CHAPTER I,"his forefoot, at the expression, ""his relations with truth, as I"
477,CHAPTER I,"understand truth,"" and when I had done, sniffed audibly, and said I"
478,CHAPTER I,"talked like a transcendentalist.  For his part, common sense was good"
479,CHAPTER I,enough for him.
480,CHAPTER I,
481,CHAPTER I,"Precisely so, my dear sir, I replied; common sense, _as you understand"
482,CHAPTER I,"it_.  We all have to assume a standard of judgment in our own minds,"
483,CHAPTER I,either of things or persons.  A man who is willing to take another's
484,CHAPTER I,"opinion has to exercise his judgment in the choice of whom to follow,"
485,CHAPTER I,which is often as nice a matter as to judge of things for one's self.  On
486,CHAPTER I,"the whole, I had rather judge men's minds by comparing their thoughts"
487,CHAPTER I,"with my own, than judge of thoughts by knowing who utter them.  I must do"
488,CHAPTER I,"one or the other.  It does not follow, of course, that I may not"
489,CHAPTER I,recognize another man's thoughts as broader and deeper than my own; but
490,CHAPTER I,"that does not necessarily change my opinion, otherwise this would be at"
491,CHAPTER I,the mercy of every superior mind that held a different one.  How many of
492,CHAPTER I,our most cherished beliefs are like those drinking-glasses of the ancient
493,CHAPTER I,"pattern, that serve us well so long as we keep them in our hand, but"
494,CHAPTER I,spill all if we attempt to set them down!  I have sometimes compared
495,CHAPTER I,"conversation to the Italian game of _mora_, in which one player lifts his"
496,CHAPTER I,"hand with so many fingers extended, and the other gives the number if he"
497,CHAPTER I,"can.  I show my thought, another his; if they agree, well; if they"
498,CHAPTER I,"differ, we find the largest common factor, if we can, but at any rate"
499,CHAPTER I,"avoid disputing about remainders and fractions, which is to real talk"

842,CHAPTER II,
843,CHAPTER II,
844,CHAPTER II,"I really believe some people save their bright thoughts, as being too"
845,CHAPTER II,precious for conversation.  What do you think an admiring friend said the
846,CHAPTER II,"other day to one that was talking good things,--good enough to print?"
847,CHAPTER II,"""Why,"" said he, ""you are wasting mechantable literature, a cash article,"
848,CHAPTER II,"at the rate, as nearly as I can tell, of fifty dollars an hour.""  The"
849,CHAPTER II,talker took him to the window and asked him to look out and tell what he
850,CHAPTER II,saw.
851,CHAPTER II,
852,CHAPTER II,"""Nothing but a very dusty street,"" he said, ""and a man driving a"
853,CHAPTER II,"sprinkling-machine through it."""
854,CHAPTER II,
855,CHAPTER II,"""Why don't you tell the man he is wasting that water?  What would be the"
856,CHAPTER II,"state of the highways of life, if we did not drive our"
857,CHAPTER II,"_thought-sprinklers_ through them with the valves open, sometimes?"
858,CHAPTER II,
859,CHAPTER II,"""Besides, there is another thing about this talking, which you forget."
860,CHAPTER II,It shapes our thoughts for us;--the waves of conversation roll them as
861,CHAPTER II,the surf rolls the pebbles on the shore.  Let me modify the image a
862,CHAPTER II,little.  I rough out my thoughts in talk as an artist models in clay.
863,CHAPTER II,"Spoken language is so plastic,--you can pat and coax, and spread and"
864,CHAPTER II,"shave, and rub out, and fill up, and stick on so easily when you work"
865,CHAPTER II,"that soft material, that there is nothing like it for modelling.  Out of"
866,CHAPTER II,it come the shapes which you turn into marble or bronze in your immortal
867,CHAPTER II,"books, if you happen to write such.  Or, to use another illustration,"
868,CHAPTER II,writing or printing is like shooting with a rifle; you may hit your
869,CHAPTER II,"reader's mind, or miss it;--but talking is like playing at a mark with"
870,CHAPTER II,"the pipe of an engine; if it is within reach, and you have time enough,"
871,CHAPTER II,"you can't help hitting it."""
872,CHAPTER II,
873,CHAPTER II,The company agreed that this last illustration was of superior
874,CHAPTER II,"excellence, or, in the phrase used by them, ""Fust-rate.""  I acknowledged"
875,CHAPTER II,"the compliment, but gently rebuked the expression.  ""Fust-rate,"" ""prime,"""
876,CHAPTER II,"""a prime article,"" ""a superior piece of goods,"" ""a handsome garment,"" ""a"
877,CHAPTER II,"gent in a flowered vest,""--all such expressions are final.  They blast"
878,CHAPTER II,"the lineage of him or her who utters them, for generations up and down."
879,CHAPTER II,There is one other phrase which will soon come to be decisive of a man's
880,CHAPTER II,"social _status_, if it is not already:  ""That tells the whole story.""  It"
881,CHAPTER II,"is an expression which vulgar and conceited people particularly affect,"
882,CHAPTER II,"and which well-meaning ones, who know better, catch from them.  It is"
883,CHAPTER II,"intended to stop all debate, like the previous question in the General"
884,CHAPTER II,"Court.  Only it doesn't; simply because ""that"" does not usually tell the"
885,CHAPTER II,"whole, nor one half of the whole story."
886,CHAPTER II,
887,CHAPTER II,"--It is an odd idea, that almost all our people have had a professional"
888,CHAPTER II,education.  To become a doctor a man must study some three years and hear
889,CHAPTER II,"a thousand lectures, more or less.  Just how much study it takes to make"
890,CHAPTER II,"a lawyer I cannot say, but probably not more than this.  Now most decent"
891,CHAPTER II,people hear one hundred lectures or sermons (discourses) on theology
892,CHAPTER II,"every year,--and this, twenty, thirty, fifty years together.  They read a"
893,CHAPTER II,"great many religious books besides.  The clergy, however, rarely hear any"
894,CHAPTER II,sermons except what they preach themselves.  A dull preacher might be
895,CHAPTER II,"conceived, therefore, to lapse into a state of _quasi_ heathenism, simply"
896,CHAPTER II,"for want of religious instruction.  And on the other hand, an attentive"
897,CHAPTER II,"and intelligent hearer, listening to a succession of wise teachers, might"
898,CHAPTER II,become actually better educated in theology than any one of them.  We are
899,CHAPTER II,"all theological students, and more of us qualified as doctors of divinity"
900,CHAPTER II,than have received degrees at any of the universities.
901,CHAPTER II,
902,CHAPTER II,"It is not strange, therefore, that very good people should often find it"
903,CHAPTER II,"difficult, if not impossible, to keep their attention fixed upon a sermon"
904,CHAPTER II,treating feebly a subject which they have thought vigorously about for
905,CHAPTER II,"years, and heard able men discuss scores of times.  I have often noticed,"
906,CHAPTER II,"however, that a hopelessly dull discourse acts _inductively_, as"
907,CHAPTER II,"electricians would say, in developing strong mental currents.  I am"
908,CHAPTER II,ashamed to think with what accompaniments and variations and _fioriture_
909,CHAPTER II,"I have sometimes followed the droning of a heavy speaker,--not"
910,CHAPTER II,"willingly,--for my habit is reverential,--but as a necessary result of a"
911,CHAPTER II,"slight continuous impression on the senses and the mind, which kept both"
912,CHAPTER II,in action without furnishing the food they required to work upon.  If you
913,CHAPTER II,"ever saw a crow with a king-bird after him, you will get an image of a"
914,CHAPTER II,dull speaker and a lively listener.  The bird in sable plumage flaps
915,CHAPTER II,"heavily along his straight-forward course, while the other sails round"
916,CHAPTER II,"him, over him, under him, leaves him, comes back again, tweaks out a"
917,CHAPTER II,"black feather, shoots away once more, never losing sight of him, and"
918,CHAPTER II,"finally reaches the crow's perch at the same time the crow does, having"
919,CHAPTER II,cut a perfect labyrinth of loops and knots and spirals while the slow
920,CHAPTER II,fowl was painfully working from one end of his straight line to the
921,CHAPTER II,other.
922,CHAPTER II,
923,CHAPTER II,[I think these remarks were received rather coolly.  A temporary boarder
924,CHAPTER II,"from the country, consisting of a somewhat more than middle-aged female,"
925,CHAPTER II,"with a parchment forehead and a dry little ""frisette"" shingling it, a"
926,CHAPTER II,"sallow neck with a necklace of gold beads, a black dress too rusty for"
927,CHAPTER II,"recent grief and contours in basso-rilievo, left the table prematurely,"
928,CHAPTER II,and was reported to have been very virulent about what I said.  So I went
929,CHAPTER II,"to my good old minister, and repeated the remarks, as nearly as I could"
930,CHAPTER II,"remember them, to him.  He laughed good-naturedly, and said there was"
931,CHAPTER II,considerable truth in them.  He thought he could tell when people's minds
932,CHAPTER II,"were wandering, by their looks.  In the earlier years of his ministry he"
933,CHAPTER II,"had sometimes noticed this, when he was preaching;--very little of late"
934,CHAPTER II,"years.  Sometimes, when his colleague was preaching, he observed this"
935,CHAPTER II,"kind of inattention; but after all, it was not so very unnatural.  I will"
936,CHAPTER II,"say, by the way, that it is a rule I have long followed, to tell my worst"
937,CHAPTER II,"thoughts to my minister, and my best thoughts to the young people I talk"
938,CHAPTER II,with.]
939,CHAPTER II,
940,CHAPTER II,"--I want to make a literary confession now, which I believe nobody has"
941,CHAPTER II,"made before me.  You know very well that I write verses sometimes,"
942,CHAPTER II,because I have read some of them at this table.  (The company
943,CHAPTER II,"assented,--two or three of them in a resigned sort of way, as I thought,"
944,CHAPTER II,"as if they supposed I had an epic in my pocket, and was going to read"
945,CHAPTER II,half a dozen books or so for their benefit.)--I continued.  Of course I
946,CHAPTER II,"write some lines or passages which are better than others; some which,"
947,CHAPTER II,"compared with the others, might be called relatively excellent.  It is in"
948,CHAPTER II,the nature of things that I should consider these relatively excellent
949,CHAPTER II,lines or passages as absolutely good.  So much must be pardoned to
950,CHAPTER II,"humanity.  Now I never wrote a ""good"" line in my life, but the moment"
951,CHAPTER II,after it was written it seemed a hundred years old.  Very commonly I had
952,CHAPTER II,a sudden conviction that I had seen it somewhere.  Possibly I may have
953,CHAPTER II,"sometimes unconsciously stolen it, but I do not remember that I ever once"
954,CHAPTER II,detected any historical truth in these sudden convictions of the
955,CHAPTER II,antiquity of my new thought or phrase.  I have learned utterly to
956,CHAPTER II,"distrust them, and never allow them to bully me out of a thought or line."
957,CHAPTER II,
958,CHAPTER II,This is the philosophy of it.  (Here the number of the company was
959,CHAPTER II,diminished by a small secession.)  Any new formula which suddenly emerges
960,CHAPTER II,in our consciousness has its roots in long trains of thought; it is
961,CHAPTER II,virtually old when it first makes its appearance among the recognized
962,CHAPTER II,growths of our intellect.  Any crystalline group of musical words has had
963,CHAPTER II,a long and still period to form in.  Here is one theory.
964,CHAPTER II,
965,CHAPTER II,[Picture: The schoolmistress]
966,CHAPTER II,
967,CHAPTER II,But there is a larger law which perhaps comprehends these facts.  It is
968,CHAPTER II,this.  The rapidity with which ideas grow old in our memories is in a
969,CHAPTER II,direct ratio to the squares of their importance.  Their apparent age runs
970,CHAPTER II,"up miraculously, like the value of diamonds, as they increase in"
971,CHAPTER II,"magnitude.  A great calamity, for instance, is as old as the trilobites"
972,CHAPTER II,an hour after it has happened.  It stains backward through all the leaves
973,CHAPTER II,"we have turned over in the book of life, before its blot of tears or of"
974,CHAPTER II,blood is dry on the page we are turning.  For this we seem to have lived;
975,CHAPTER II,it was foreshadowed in dreams that we leaped out of in the cold sweat of
976,CHAPTER II,"terror; in the ""dissolving views"" of dark day-visions; all omens pointed"
977,CHAPTER II,to it; all paths led to it.  After the tossing half-forgetfulness of the
978,CHAPTER II,"first sleep that follows such an event, it comes upon us afresh, as a"
979,CHAPTER II,"surprise, at waking; in a few moments it is old again,--old as eternity."
980,CHAPTER II,
981,CHAPTER II,[I wish I had not said all this then and there.  I might have known
982,CHAPTER II,"better.  The pale schoolmistress, in her mourning dress, was looking at"
983,CHAPTER II,"me, as I noticed, with a wild sort of expression.  All at once the blood"
984,CHAPTER II,dropped out of her cheeks as the mercury drops from a broken
985,CHAPTER II,"barometer-tube, and she melted away from her seat like an image of snow;"
986,CHAPTER II,a slung-shot could not have brought her down better.  God forgive me!
987,CHAPTER II,
988,CHAPTER II,"After this little episode, I continued, to some few that remained"
989,CHAPTER II,"balancing teaspoons on the edges of cups, twirling knives, or tilting"
990,CHAPTER II,"upon the hind legs of their chairs until their heads reached the wall,"
991,CHAPTER II,where they left gratuitous advertisements of various popular cosmetics.]
992,CHAPTER II,
993,CHAPTER II,"When a person is suddenly thrust into any strange, new position of trial,"
994,CHAPTER II,he finds the place fits him as if he had been measured for it.  He has
995,CHAPTER II,"committed a great crime, for instance, and is sent to the State Prison."
996,CHAPTER II,"The traditions, prescriptions, limitations, privileges, all the sharp"
997,CHAPTER II,"conditions of his new life, stamp themselves upon his consciousness as"
998,CHAPTER II,the signet on soft wax;--a single pressure is enough.  Let me strengthen
999,CHAPTER II,the image a little.  Did you ever happen to see that most soft-spoken and
1000,CHAPTER II,velvet-handed steam-engine at the Mint?  The smooth piston slides
1001,CHAPTER II,backward and forward as a lady might slip her delicate finger in and out
1002,CHAPTER II,"of a ring.  The engine lays one of _its_ fingers calmly, but firmly, upon"
1003,CHAPTER II,"a bit of metal; it is a coin now, and will remember that touch, and tell"
1004,CHAPTER II,"a new race about it, when the date upon it is crusted over with twenty"
1005,CHAPTER II,centuries.  So it is that a great silent-moving misery puts a new stamp
1006,CHAPTER II,"on us in an hour or a moment,--as sharp an impression as if it had taken"
1007,CHAPTER II,half a lifetime to engrave it.
1008,CHAPTER II,
1009,CHAPTER II,It is awful to be in the hands of the wholesale professional dealers in
1010,CHAPTER II,"misfortune; undertakers and jailers magnetize you in a moment, and you"
1011,CHAPTER II,pass out of the individual life you were living into the rhythmical
1012,CHAPTER II,"movements of their horrible machinery.  Do the worst thing you can, or"
1013,CHAPTER II,"suffer the worst that can be thought of, you find yourself in a category"
1014,CHAPTER II,"of humanity that stretches back as far as Cain, and with an expert at"
1015,CHAPTER II,"your elbow who has studied your case all out beforehand, and is waiting"
1016,CHAPTER II,"for you with his implements of hemp or mahogany.  I believe, if a man"
1017,CHAPTER II,"were to be burned in any of our cities tomorrow for heresy, there would"
1018,CHAPTER II,be found a master of ceremonies that knew just how many fagots were
1019,CHAPTER II,"necessary, and the best way of arranging the whole matter."
1020,CHAPTER II,
1021,CHAPTER II,"--So we have not won the Goodwood cup; _au contraire_, we were a ""bad"
1022,CHAPTER II,"fifth,"" if not worse than that; and trying it again, and the third time,"
1023,CHAPTER II,has not yet bettered the matter.  Now I am as patriotic as any of my
1024,CHAPTER II,"fellow-citizens,--too patriotic in fact, for I have got into hot water by"
1025,CHAPTER II,"loving too much of my country; in short, if any man, whose fighting"
1026,CHAPTER II,"weight is not more than eight stone four pounds, disputes it, I am ready"
1027,CHAPTER II,to discuss the point with him.  I should have gloried to see the stars
1028,CHAPTER II,"and stripes in front at the finish.  I love my country, and I love"
1029,CHAPTER II,"horses.  Stubbs's old mezzotint of Eclipse hangs over my desk, and"
1030,CHAPTER II,"Herring's portrait of Plenipotentiary,--whom I saw run at Epsom,--over my"
1031,CHAPTER II,"fireplace.  Did I not elope from school to see Revenge, and Prospect, and"
1032,CHAPTER II,"Little John, and Peacemaker run over the race-course where now yon"
1033,CHAPTER II,"suburban village flourishes, in the year eighteen hundred and"
1034,CHAPTER II,"ever-so-few?  Though I never owned a horse, have I not been the"
1035,CHAPTER II,"proprietor of six equine females, of which one was the prettiest little"
1036,CHAPTER II,"""Morgin"" that ever stepped?  Listen, then, to an opinion I have often"
1037,CHAPTER II,expressed long before this venture of ours in England.  Horse-_racing_ is
1038,CHAPTER II,not a republican institution; horse-_trotting_ is.  Only very rich
1039,CHAPTER II,"persons can keep race-horses, and everybody knows they are kept mainly as"
1040,CHAPTER II,gambling implements.  All that matter about blood and speed we won't
1041,CHAPTER II,"discuss; we understand all that; useful, very,--_of_ course,--great"
1042,CHAPTER II,"obligations to the Godolphin ""Arabian,"" and the rest.  I say racing"
1043,CHAPTER II,"horses are essentially gambling implements, as much as roulette tables."
1044,CHAPTER II,Now I am not preaching at this moment; I may read you one of my sermons
1045,CHAPTER II,"some other morning; but I maintain that gambling, on the great scale, is"
1046,CHAPTER II,"not republican.  It belongs to two phases of society,--a cankered"
1047,CHAPTER II,"over-civilization, such as exists in rich aristocracies, and the reckless"
1048,CHAPTER II,"life of borderers and adventurers, or the semi-barbarism of a"
1049,CHAPTER II,civilization resolved into its primitive elements.  Real Republicanism is
1050,CHAPTER II,"stern and severe; its essence is not in forms of government, but in the"
1051,CHAPTER II,omnipotence of public opinion which grows out of it.  This public opinion
1052,CHAPTER II,"cannot prevent gambling with dice or stocks, but it can and does compel"
1053,CHAPTER II,it to keep comparatively quiet.  But horse-racing is the most public way
1054,CHAPTER II,"of gambling, and with all its immense attractions to the sense and the"
1055,CHAPTER II,"feelings,--to which I plead very susceptible,--the disguise is too thin"
1056,CHAPTER II,"that covers it, and everybody knows what it means.  Its supporters are"
1057,CHAPTER II,"the Southern gentry,--fine fellows, no doubt, but not republicans"
1058,CHAPTER II,"exactly, as we understand the term,--a few Northern millionnaires more or"
1059,CHAPTER II,"less thoroughly millioned, who do not represent the real people, and the"
1060,CHAPTER II,"mob of sporting men, the best of whom are commonly idlers, and the worst"
1061,CHAPTER II,"very bad neighbors to have near one in a crowd, or to meet in a dark"
1062,CHAPTER II,"alley.  In England, on the other hand, with its aristocratic"
1063,CHAPTER II,"institutions, racing is a natural growth enough; the passion for it"
1064,CHAPTER II,"spreads downwards through all classes, from the Queen to the"
1065,CHAPTER II,"costermonger.  London is like a shelled corn-cob on the Derby day, and"
1066,CHAPTER II,there is not a clerk who could raise the money to hire a saddle with an
1067,CHAPTER II,old hack under it that can sit down on his office-stool the next day
1068,CHAPTER II,without wincing.
1069,CHAPTER II,
1070,CHAPTER II,Now just compare the racer with the trotter for a moment.  The racer is
1071,CHAPTER II,"incidentally useful, but essentially something to bet upon, as much as"
1072,CHAPTER II,"the thimble-rigger's ""little joker.""  The trotter is essentially and"
1073,CHAPTER II,"daily useful, and only incidentally a tool for sporting men."
1074,CHAPTER II,
1075,CHAPTER II,What better reason do you want for the fact that the racer is most
1076,CHAPTER II,"cultivated and reaches his greatest perfection in England, and that the"
1077,CHAPTER II,trotting horses of America beat the world?  And why should we have
1078,CHAPTER II,expected that the pick--if it was the pick--of our few and far-between
1079,CHAPTER II,racing stables should beat the pick of England and France?  Throw over
1080,CHAPTER II,"the fallacious time-test, and there was nothing to show for it but a"
1081,CHAPTER II,"natural kind of patriotic feeling, which we all have, with a thoroughly"
1082,CHAPTER II,"provincial conceit, which some of us must plead guilty to."
1083,CHAPTER II,
1084,CHAPTER II,"We may beat yet.  As an American, I hope we shall.  As a moralist and"
1085,CHAPTER II,"occasional sermonizer, I am not so anxious about it.  Wherever the"
1086,CHAPTER II,"trotting horse goes, he carries in his train brisk omnibuses, lively"
1087,CHAPTER II,"bakers' carts, and therefore hot rolls, the jolly butcher's wagon, the"
1088,CHAPTER II,"cheerful gig, the wholesome afternoon drive with wife and child,--all the"
1089,CHAPTER II,"forms of moral excellence, except truth, which does not agree with any"
1090,CHAPTER II,"kind of horse-flesh.  The racer brings with him gambling, cursing,"
1091,CHAPTER II,"swearing, drinking, the eating of oysters, and a distaste for mob-caps"
1092,CHAPTER II,and the middle-aged virtues.
1093,CHAPTER II,
1094,CHAPTER II,"And by the way, let me beg you not to call a _trotting match_ a _race_,"
1095,CHAPTER II,"and not to speak of a ""thoroughbred"" as a ""_blooded_"" horse, unless he"
1096,CHAPTER II,"has been recently phlebotomized.  I consent to your saying ""blood horse,"""
1097,CHAPTER II,"if you like.  Also, if, next year, we send out Posterior and"
1098,CHAPTER II,"Posterioress, the winners of the great national four-mile race in 7 18.5,"
1099,CHAPTER II,"and they happen to get beaten, pay your bets, and behave like men and"
1100,CHAPTER II,"gentlemen about it, if you know how."
1101,CHAPTER II,
1102,CHAPTER II,[I felt a great deal better after blowing off the ill-temper condensed in
1103,CHAPTER II,"the above paragraph.  To brag little,--to show well,--to crow gently, if"
1104,CHAPTER II,"in luck,--to pay up, to own up, and to shut up, if beaten, are the"
1105,CHAPTER II,"virtues of a sporting man, and I can't say that I think we have shown"
1106,CHAPTER II,them in any great perfection of late.]
1107,CHAPTER II,
1108,CHAPTER II,--Apropos of horses.  Do you know how important good jockeying is to
1109,CHAPTER II,authors?  Judicious management; letting the public see your animal just
1110,CHAPTER II,"enough, and not too much; holding him up hard when the market is too full"
1111,CHAPTER II,of him; letting him out at just the right buying intervals; always gently
1112,CHAPTER II,feeling his mouth; never slacking and never jerking the rein;--this is
1113,CHAPTER II,what I mean by jockeying.
1114,CHAPTER II,
1115,CHAPTER II,--When an author has a number of books out a cunning hand will keep them
1116,CHAPTER II,"all spinning, as Signor Blitz does his dinner-plates; fetching each one"
1117,CHAPTER II,"up, as it begins to ""wabble,"" by an advertisement, a puff, or a"
1118,CHAPTER II,quotation.
1119,CHAPTER II,
1120,CHAPTER II,--Whenever the extracts from a living writer begin to multiply fast in
1121,CHAPTER II,"the papers, without obvious reason, there is a new book or a new edition"
1122,CHAPTER II,coming.  The extracts are _ground-bait_.
1123,CHAPTER II,
1124,CHAPTER II,--Literary life is fun of curious phenomena.  I don't know that there is
1125,CHAPTER II,anything more noticeable than what we may call _conventional
1126,CHAPTER II,reputations_.  There is a tacit understanding in every community of men
1127,CHAPTER II,of letters that they will not disturb the popular fallacy respecting this
1128,CHAPTER II,or that electro-gilded celebrity.  There are various reasons for this
1129,CHAPTER II,forbearance: one is old; one is rich; one is good-natured; one is such a
1130,CHAPTER II,favorite with the pit that it would not be safe to hiss him from the
1131,CHAPTER II,manager's box.  The venerable augurs of the literary or scientific temple
1132,CHAPTER II,may smile faintly when one of the tribe is mentioned; but the farce is in
1133,CHAPTER II,general kept up as well as the Chinese comic scene of entreating and
1134,CHAPTER II,imploring a man to stay with you with the implied compact between you
1135,CHAPTER II,that he shall by no means think of doing it.  A poor wretch he must be
1136,CHAPTER II,who would wantonly sit down on one of these bandbox reputations.  A
1137,CHAPTER II,"Prince-Rupert's-drop, which is a tear of unannealed glass, lasts"
1138,CHAPTER II,"indefinitely, if you keep it from meddling hands; but break its tail off,"
1139,CHAPTER II,and it explodes and resolves itself into powder.  These celebrities I
1140,CHAPTER II,speak of are the Prince-Rupert's-drops of the learned and polite world.
1141,CHAPTER II,See how the papers treat them!  What an array of pleasant kaleidoscopic
1142,CHAPTER II,"phrases, which can be arranged in ever so many charming patterns, is at"
1143,CHAPTER II,"their service!  How kind the ""Critical Notices""--where small authorship"
1144,CHAPTER II,"comes to pick up chips of praise, fragrant, sugary, and sappy--always are"
1145,CHAPTER II,"to them!  Well, life would be nothing without paper-credit and other"
1146,CHAPTER II,fictions; so let them pass current.  Don't steal their chips; don't
1147,CHAPTER II,puncture their swimming-bladders; don't come down on their pasteboard
1148,CHAPTER II,"boxes; don't break the ends of their brittle and unstable reputations,"
1149,CHAPTER II,you fellows who all feel sure that your names will be household words a
1150,CHAPTER II,thousand years from now.
1151,CHAPTER II,
1152,CHAPTER II,"""A thousand years is a good while,"" said the old gentleman who sits"
1153,CHAPTER II,"opposite, thoughtfully."
1154,CHAPTER II,
1155,CHAPTER II,"--Where have I been for the last three or four days?  Down at the Island,"
1156,CHAPTER II,deer-shooting.--How many did I bag?  I brought home one buck shot.--The
1157,CHAPTER II,Island is where?  No matter.  It is the most splendid domain that any man
1158,CHAPTER II,"looks upon in these latitudes.  Blue sea around it, and running up into"
1159,CHAPTER II,"its heart, so that the little boat slumbers like a baby in lap, while the"
1160,CHAPTER II,"tall ships are stripping naked to fight the hurricane outside, and"
1161,CHAPTER II,"storm-stay-sails banging and flying in ribbons.  Trees, in stretches of"
1162,CHAPTER II,"miles; beeches, oaks, most numerous;--many of them hung with moss,"
1163,CHAPTER II,"looking like bearded Druids; some coiled in the clasp of huge,"
1164,CHAPTER II,dark-stemmed grape-vines.  Open patches where the sun gets in and goes to
1165,CHAPTER II,"sleep, and the winds come so finely sifted that they are as soft as"
1166,CHAPTER II,"swan's down.  Rocks scattered about,--Stonehenge-like monoliths."
1167,CHAPTER II,"Fresh-water lakes; one of them, Mary's lake, crystal-clear, full of"
1168,CHAPTER II,flashing pickerel lying under the lily-pads like tigers in the jungle.
1169,CHAPTER II,Six pounds of ditto killed one morning for breakfast.  EGO _fecit._

1171,CHAPTER II,The divinity-student looked as if he would like to question my Latin.
1172,CHAPTER II,"No, sir, I said,--you need not trouble yourself.  There is a higher law"
1173,CHAPTER II,"in grammar, not to be put down by Andrews and Stoddard.  Then I went on."
1174,CHAPTER II,
1175,CHAPTER II,Such hospitality as that island has seen there has not been the like of
1176,CHAPTER II,in these our New England sovereignties.  There is nothing in the shape of
1177,CHAPTER II,"kindness and courtesy that can make life beautiful, which has not found"
1178,CHAPTER II,its home in that ocean-principality.  It has welcomed all who were worthy
1179,CHAPTER II,"of welcome, from the pale clergyman who came to breathe the sea-air with"
1180,CHAPTER II,"its medicinal salt and iodine, to the great statesman who turned his back"
1181,CHAPTER II,"on the affairs of empire, and smoothed his Olympian forehead, and flashed"
1182,CHAPTER II,"his white teeth in merriment over the long table, where his wit was the"
1183,CHAPTER II,keenest and his story the best.
1184,CHAPTER II,
1185,CHAPTER II,[I don't believe any man ever talked like that in this world.  I don't
1186,CHAPTER II,"believe _I_ talked just so; but the fact is, in reporting one's"
1187,CHAPTER II,"conversation, one cannot help _Blair_-ing it up more or less, ironing out"
1188,CHAPTER II,"crumpled paragraphs, starching limp ones, and crimping and plaiting a"
1189,CHAPTER II,little sometimes; it is as natural as prinking at the looking-glass.]
1190,CHAPTER II,
1191,CHAPTER II,--How can a man help writing poetry in such a place?  Everybody does
1192,CHAPTER II,"write poetry that goes there.  In the state archives, kept in the library"
1193,CHAPTER II,"of the Lord of the Isle, are whole volumes of unpublished verse,--some by"
1194,CHAPTER II,"well-known hands, and others quite as good, by the last people you would"
1195,CHAPTER II,"think of as versifiers,--men who could pension off all the genuine poets"
1196,CHAPTER II,"in the country, and buy ten acres of Boston common, if it was for sale,"
1197,CHAPTER II,with what they had left.  Of course I had to write my little copy of
1198,CHAPTER II,"verses with the rest; here it is, if you will hear me read it.  When the"
1199,CHAPTER II,"sun is in the west, vessels sailing in an easterly direction look bright"
1200,CHAPTER II,"or dark to one who observes them from the north or south, according to"
1201,CHAPTER II,the tack they are sailing upon.  Watching them from one of the windows of
1202,CHAPTER II,"the great mansion, I saw these perpetual changes, and moralized thus:--"
1203,CHAPTER II,
1204,SUN AND SHADOW.,SUN AND SHADOW.
1205,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1206,SUN AND SHADOW.,"As I look from the isle, o'er its billows of green,"
1207,SUN AND SHADOW.,"To the billows of foam-crested blue,"
1208,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Yon bark, that afar in the distance is seen,"
1209,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Half dreaming, my eyes will pursue:"
1210,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Now dark in the shadow, she scatters the spray"
1211,SUN AND SHADOW.,As the chaff in the stroke of the flail;
1212,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Now white as the sea-gull, she flies on her way,"
1213,SUN AND SHADOW.,The sun gleaming bright on her sail.
1214,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1215,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shun,--"
1216,SUN AND SHADOW.,Of breakers that whiten and roar;
1217,SUN AND SHADOW.,"How little he cares, if in shadow or sun"
1218,SUN AND SHADOW.,They see him that gaze from the shore!
1219,SUN AND SHADOW.,"He looks to the beacon that looms from the reef,"
1220,SUN AND SHADOW.,"To the rock that is under his lee,"
1221,SUN AND SHADOW.,"As he drifts on the blast, like a wind-wafted leaf,"
1222,SUN AND SHADOW.,O'er the gulfs of the desolate sea.
1223,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1224,SUN AND SHADOW.,Thus drifting afar to the dim-vaulted caves
1225,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Where life and its ventures are laid,"
1226,SUN AND SHADOW.,The dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves
1227,SUN AND SHADOW.,May see us in sunshine or shade;
1228,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Yet true to our course, though our shadow grow dark,"
1229,SUN AND SHADOW.,"We'll trim our broad sail as before,"
1230,SUN AND SHADOW.,"And stand by the rudder that governs the bark,"
1231,SUN AND SHADOW.,Nor ask how we look from the shore!
1232,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1233,SUN AND SHADOW.,--Insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked.  Good
1234,SUN AND SHADOW.,"mental machinery ought to break its own wheels and levers, if anything is"
1235,SUN AND SHADOW.,thrust among them suddenly which tends to stop them or reverse their
1236,SUN AND SHADOW.,motion.  A weak mind does not accumulate force enough to hurt itself;
1237,SUN AND SHADOW.,stupidity often saves a man from going mad.  We frequently see persons in
1238,SUN AND SHADOW.,"insane hospitals, sent there in consequence of what are called"
1239,SUN AND SHADOW.,_religious_ mental disturbances.  I confess that I think better of them
1240,SUN AND SHADOW.,"than of many who hold the same notions, and keep their wits and appear to"
1241,SUN AND SHADOW.,"enjoy life very well, outside of the asylums.  Any decent person ought to"
1242,SUN AND SHADOW.,"go mad, if he really holds such or such opinions.  It is very much to his"
1243,SUN AND SHADOW.,"discredit in every point of view, if he does not.  What is the use of my"
1244,SUN AND SHADOW.,saying what some of these opinions are?  Perhaps more than one of you
1245,SUN AND SHADOW.,hold such as I should think ought to send you straight over to
1246,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Somerville, if you have any logic in your heads or any human feeling in"
1247,SUN AND SHADOW.,"your hearts.  Anything that is brutal, cruel, heathenish, that makes life"
1248,SUN AND SHADOW.,"hopeless for the most of mankind and perhaps for entire races,--anything"
1249,SUN AND SHADOW.,that assumes the necessity of the extermination of instincts which were
1250,SUN AND SHADOW.,"given to be regulated,--no matter by what name you call it,--no matter"
1251,SUN AND SHADOW.,"whether a fakir, or a monk, or a deacon believes it,--if received, ought"
1252,SUN AND SHADOW.,to produce insanity in every well-regulated mind.  That condition becomes
1253,SUN AND SHADOW.,"a normal one, under the circumstances.  I am very much ashamed of some"
1254,SUN AND SHADOW.,"people for retaining their reason, when they know perfectly well that if"
1255,SUN AND SHADOW.,"they were not the most stupid or the most selfish of human beings, they"
1256,SUN AND SHADOW.,would become _non-compotes_ at once.
1257,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1258,SUN AND SHADOW.,[Nobody understood this but the theological student and the
1259,SUN AND SHADOW.,schoolmistress.  They looked intelligently at each other; but whether
1260,SUN AND SHADOW.,"they were thinking about my paradox or not, I am not clear.--It would be"
1261,SUN AND SHADOW.,natural enough.  Stranger things have happened.  Love and Death enter
1262,SUN AND SHADOW.,"boarding-houses without asking the price of board, or whether there is"
1263,SUN AND SHADOW.,"room for them.  Alas, these young people are poor and pallid!  Love"
1264,SUN AND SHADOW.,"_should_ be both rich and rosy, but _must_ be either rich or rosy.  Talk"
1265,SUN AND SHADOW.,about military duty!  What is that to the warfare of a married
1266,SUN AND SHADOW.,"maid-of-all-work, with the title of mistress, and an American female"
1267,SUN AND SHADOW.,"constitution, which collapses just in the middle third of life, and comes"
1268,SUN AND SHADOW.,"out vulcanized India-rubber, if it happen to live through the period when"
1269,SUN AND SHADOW.,health and strength are most wanted?]
1270,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1271,SUN AND SHADOW.,--Have I ever acted in private theatricals?  Often.  I have played the
1272,SUN AND SHADOW.,"part of the ""Poor Gentleman,"" before a great many audiences,--more, I"
1273,SUN AND SHADOW.,"trust, than I shall ever face again.  I did not wear a stage-costume, nor"
1274,SUN AND SHADOW.,"a wig, nor moustaches of burnt cork; but I was placarded and announced as"
1275,SUN AND SHADOW.,"a public performer, and at the proper hour I came forward with the"
1276,SUN AND SHADOW.,"ballet-dancer's smile upon my countenance, and made my bow and acted my"
1277,SUN AND SHADOW.,part.  I have seen my name stuck up in letters so big that I was ashamed
1278,SUN AND SHADOW.,to show myself in the place by daylight.  I have gone to a town with a
1279,SUN AND SHADOW.,"sober literary essay in my pocket, and seen myself everywhere announced"
1280,SUN AND SHADOW.,"as the most desperate of _buffos_,--one who was obliged to restrain"
1281,SUN AND SHADOW.,"himself in the full exercise of his powers, from prudential"
1282,SUN AND SHADOW.,"considerations.  I have been through as many hardships as Ulysses, in the"
1283,SUN AND SHADOW.,pursuit of my histrionic vocation.  I have travelled in cars until the
1284,SUN AND SHADOW.,"conductors all knew me like a brother.  I have run off the rails, and"
1285,SUN AND SHADOW.,"stuck all night in snow-drifts, and sat behind females that would have"
1286,SUN AND SHADOW.,the window open when one could not wink without his eyelids freezing
1287,SUN AND SHADOW.,together.  Perhaps I shall give you some of my experiences one of these
1288,SUN AND SHADOW.,"days;--I will not now, for I have something else for you."
1289,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1290,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Private theatricals, as I have figured in them in country lyceum-halls,"
1291,SUN AND SHADOW.,"are one thing,--and private theatricals, as they may be seen in certain"
1292,SUN AND SHADOW.,"gilded and frescoed saloons of our metropolis, are another.  Yes, it is"
1293,SUN AND SHADOW.,"pleasant to see real gentlemen and ladies, who do not think it necessary"
1294,SUN AND SHADOW.,"to mouth, and rant, and stride, like most of our stage heroes and"
1295,SUN AND SHADOW.,"heroines, in the characters which show off their graces and talents; most"
1296,SUN AND SHADOW.,"of all to see a fresh, unrouged, unspoiled, high bred young maiden, with"
1297,SUN AND SHADOW.,"a lithe figure, and a pleasant voice, acting in those love-dramas which"
1298,SUN AND SHADOW.,"make us young again to look upon, when real youth and beauty will play"
1299,SUN AND SHADOW.,them for us.
1300,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1301,SUN AND SHADOW.,--Of course I wrote the prologue I was asked to write.  I did not see the
1302,SUN AND SHADOW.,"play, though.  I knew there was a young lady in it, and that somebody was"
1303,SUN AND SHADOW.,"in love with her, and she was in love with him, and somebody (an old"
1304,SUN AND SHADOW.,"tutor, I believe) wanted to interfere, and, very naturally, the young"
1305,SUN AND SHADOW.,lady was too sharp for him.  The play of course ends charmingly; there is
1306,SUN AND SHADOW.,"a general reconciliation, and all concerned form a line and take each"
1307,SUN AND SHADOW.,"others' hands, as people always do after they have made up their"
1308,SUN AND SHADOW.,"quarrels,--and then the curtain falls,--if it does not stick, as it"
1309,SUN AND SHADOW.,"commonly does at private theatrical exhibitions, in which case a boy is"
1310,SUN AND SHADOW.,"detailed to pull it down, which he does, blushing violently."
1311,SUN AND SHADOW.,
1312,SUN AND SHADOW.,"Now, then, for my prologue.  I am not going to change my caesuras and"
1313,SUN AND SHADOW.,"cadences for anybody; so if you do not like the heroic, or iambic"

1473,CHAPTER III,"[The ""Atlantic"" obeys the moon, and its LUNIVERSARY has come round again."
1474,CHAPTER III,I have gathered up some hasty notes of my remarks made since the last
1475,CHAPTER III,"high tides, which I respectfully submit.  Please to remember this is"
1476,CHAPTER III,_talk_; just as easy and just as formal as I choose to make it.]
1477,CHAPTER III,
1478,CHAPTER III,"--I never saw an author in my life--saving, perhaps, one--that did not"
1479,CHAPTER III,"purr as audibly as a full-grown domestic cat, (_Felis Catus_, LINN.,) on"
1480,CHAPTER III,having his fur smoothed in the right way by a skilful hand.
1481,CHAPTER III,
1482,CHAPTER III,But let me give you a caution.  Be very careful how you tell an author he
1483,CHAPTER III,"is _droll_.  Ten to one he will hate you; and if he does, be sure he can"
1484,CHAPTER III,"do you a mischief, and very probably will.  Say you _cried_ over his"
1485,CHAPTER III,"romance or his verses, and he will love you and send you a copy.  You can"
1486,CHAPTER III,laugh over that as much as you like--in private.
1487,CHAPTER III,
1488,CHAPTER III,"--Wonder why authors and actors are ashamed of being funny?--Why, there"
1489,CHAPTER III,"are obvious reasons, and deep philosophical ones.  The clown knows very"
1490,CHAPTER III,"well that the women are not in love with him, but with Hamlet, the fellow"
1491,CHAPTER III,in the black cloak and plumed hat.  Passion never laughs.  The wit knows
1492,CHAPTER III,that his place is at the tail of a procession.
1493,CHAPTER III,
1494,CHAPTER III,"If you want the deep underlying reason, I must take more time to tell it."
1495,CHAPTER III,There is a perfect consciousness in every form of wit--using that term in
1496,CHAPTER III,its general sense--that its essence consists in a partial and incomplete
1497,CHAPTER III,"view of whatever it touches.  It throws a single ray, separated from the"
1498,CHAPTER III,"rest,--red, yellow, blue, or any intermediate shade,--upon an object;"
1499,CHAPTER III,never white light; that is the province of wisdom.  We get beautiful
1500,CHAPTER III,"effects from wit,--all the prismatic colors,--but never the object as it"
1501,CHAPTER III,"is in fair daylight.  A pun, which is a kind if wit, is a different and"
1502,CHAPTER III,much shallower trick in mental optics throwing the _shadows_ of two
1503,CHAPTER III,objects so that one overlies the other.  Poetry uses the rainbow tints
1504,CHAPTER III,"for special effects, but always keeps its essential object in the purest"
1505,CHAPTER III,white light of truth.--Will you allow me to pursue this subject a little
1506,CHAPTER III,further?
1507,CHAPTER III,
1508,CHAPTER III,"[They didn't allow me at that time, for somebody happened to scrape the"
1509,CHAPTER III,"floor with his chair just then; which accidental sound, as all must have"
1510,CHAPTER III,"noticed, has the instantaneous effect that the cutting of the yellow hair"
1511,CHAPTER III,"by Iris had upon infelix Dido.  It broke the charm, and that breakfast"
1512,CHAPTER III,was over.]
1513,CHAPTER III,
1514,CHAPTER III,--Don't flatter yourselves that friendship authorizes you to say
1515,CHAPTER III,"disagreeable things to your intimates.  On the contrary, the nearer you"
1516,CHAPTER III,"come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy"
1517,CHAPTER III,"become.  Except in cases of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend"
1518,CHAPTER III,to learn unpleasant truths from his enemies; they are ready enough to
1519,CHAPTER III,tell them.  Good-breeding _never_ forgets that _amour-propre_ is
1520,CHAPTER III,"universal.  When you read the story of the Archbishop and Gil Blas, you"
1521,CHAPTER III,"may laugh, if you will, at the poor old man's delusion; but don't forget"
1522,CHAPTER III,"that the youth was the greater fool of the two, and that his master"
1523,CHAPTER III,served such a booby rightly in turning him out of doors.
1524,CHAPTER III,
1525,CHAPTER III,"--You need not get up a rebellion against what I say, if you find"
1526,CHAPTER III,everything in my sayings is not exactly new.  You can't possibly mistake
1527,CHAPTER III,a man who means to be honest for a literary pickpocket.  I once read an
1528,CHAPTER III,introductory lecture that looked to me too learned for its latitude.  On
1529,CHAPTER III,"examination, I found all its erudition was taken ready-made from"
1530,CHAPTER III,"D'Israeli.  If I had been ill-natured, I should have shown up the little"
1531,CHAPTER III,"great man, who had once belabored me in his feeble way.  But one can"
1532,CHAPTER III,"generally tell these wholesale thieves easily enough, and they are not"
1533,CHAPTER III,worth the trouble of putting them in the pillory.  I doubt the entire
1534,CHAPTER III,"novelty of my remarks just made on telling unpleasant truths, yet I am"
1535,CHAPTER III,not conscious of any larceny.
1536,CHAPTER III,
1537,CHAPTER III,Neither make too much of flaws and occasional overstatements.  Some
1538,CHAPTER III,"persons seem to think that absolute truth, in the form of rigidly stated"
1539,CHAPTER III,"propositions, is all that conversation admits.  This is precisely as if a"
1540,CHAPTER III,musician should insist on having nothing but perfect chords and simple
1541,CHAPTER III,"melodies,--no diminished fifths, no flat sevenths, no flourishes, on any"
1542,CHAPTER III,"account.  Now it is fair to say, that, just as music must have all these,"
1543,CHAPTER III,"so conversation must have its partial truths, its embellished truths, its"
1544,CHAPTER III,"exaggerated truths.  It is in its higher forms an artistic product, and"
1545,CHAPTER III,admits the ideal element as much as pictures or statues.  One man who is
1546,CHAPTER III,a little too literal can spoil the talk of a whole tableful of men of
1547,CHAPTER III,"_esprit_.--""Yes,"" you say, ""but who wants to hear fanciful people's"
1548,CHAPTER III,"nonsense?  Put the facts to it, and then see where it is!""--Certainly, if"
1549,CHAPTER III,"a man is too fond of paradox,--if he is flighty and empty,--if, instead"
1550,CHAPTER III,"of striking those fifths and sevenths, those harmonious discords, often"
1551,CHAPTER III,"so much better than the twinned octaves, in the music of thought,--if,"
1552,CHAPTER III,"instead of striking these, he jangles the chords, stick a fact into him"
1553,CHAPTER III,"like a stiletto.  But remember that talking is one of the fine arts,--the"
1554,CHAPTER III,"noblest, the most important, and the most difficult,--and that its fluent"
1555,CHAPTER III,harmonies may be spoiled by the intrusion of a single harsh note.
1556,CHAPTER III,"Therefore conversation which is suggestive rather than argumentative,"
1557,CHAPTER III,"which lets out the most of each talker's results of thought, is commonly"
1558,CHAPTER III,"the pleasantest and the most profitable.  It is not easy, at the best,"
1559,CHAPTER III,for two persons talking together to make the most of each other's
1560,CHAPTER III,"thoughts, there are so many of them."
1561,CHAPTER III,
1562,CHAPTER III,[The company looked as if they wanted an explanation.]
1563,CHAPTER III,
1564,CHAPTER III,"When John and Thomas, for instance, are talking together, it is natural"
1565,CHAPTER III,enough that among the six there should be more or less confusion and
1566,CHAPTER III,misapprehension.
1567,CHAPTER III,
1568,CHAPTER III,[Our landlady turned pale;--no doubt she thought there was a screw loose
1569,CHAPTER III,"in my intellects,--and that involved the probable loss of a boarder.  A"
1570,CHAPTER III,"severe-looking person, who wears a Spanish cloak and a sad cheek, fluted"
1571,CHAPTER III,"by the passions of the melodrama, whom I understand to be the"

1579,CHAPTER III,"I think, I said, I can make it plain to Benjamin Franklin here, that"
1580,CHAPTER III,there are at least six personalities distinctly to be recognized as
1581,CHAPTER III,taking part in that dialogue between John and Thomas.
1582,CHAPTER III,
1583,CHAPTER III,Three Johns.
1584,CHAPTER III,
1585,CHAPTER III,1.  The real John; known only to his Maker.
1586,CHAPTER III,
1587,CHAPTER III,"2.  John's ideal John; never the real one, and often very unlike him."
1588,CHAPTER III,
1589,CHAPTER III,"3.  Thomas's ideal John; never the real John, nor John's John, but often"
1590,CHAPTER III,very unlike either.
1591,CHAPTER III,
1592,CHAPTER III,Three Thomas.
1593,CHAPTER III,
1594,CHAPTER III,1.  The real Thomas.
1595,CHAPTER III,
1596,CHAPTER III,2.  Thomas's ideal Thomas.
1597,CHAPTER III,
1598,CHAPTER III,3.  John's ideal Thomas.
1599,CHAPTER III,
1600,CHAPTER III,* * * * *
1601,CHAPTER III,
1602,CHAPTER III,Only one of the three Johns is taxed; only one can be weighed on a
1603,CHAPTER III,platform-balance; but the other two are just as important in the
1604,CHAPTER III,"conversation.  Let us suppose the real John to be old, dull, and"
1605,CHAPTER III,ill-looking.  But as the Higher Powers have not conferred on men the gift
1606,CHAPTER III,"of seeing themselves in the true light, John very possibly conceives"
1607,CHAPTER III,"himself to be youthful, witty, and fascinating, and talks from the point"
1608,CHAPTER III,"of view of this ideal.  Thomas, again, believes him to be an artful"
1609,CHAPTER III,"rogue, we will say; therefore he is, so far as Thomas's attitude in the"
1610,CHAPTER III,"conversation is concerned, an artful rogue, though really simple and"
1611,CHAPTER III,"stupid.  The same conditions apply to the three Thomases.  It follows,"
1612,CHAPTER III,"that, until a man can be found who knows himself as his Maker knows him,"
1613,CHAPTER III,"or who sees himself as others see him, there must be at least six persons"
1614,CHAPTER III,"engaged in every dialogue between two.  Of these, the least important,"
1615,CHAPTER III,"philosophically speaking, is the one that we have called the real person."
1616,CHAPTER III,"No wonder two disputants often get angry, when there are six of them"
1617,CHAPTER III,talking and listening all at the same time.
1618,CHAPTER III,
1619,CHAPTER III,[A very unphilosophical application of the above remarks was made by a
1620,CHAPTER III,"young fellow, answering to the name of John, who sits near me at table."
1621,CHAPTER III,"A certain basket of peaches, a rare vegetable, little known to"
1622,CHAPTER III,"boarding-houses, was on its way to me _via_ this unlettered Johannes.  He"
1623,CHAPTER III,"appropriated the three that remained in the basket, remarking that there"
1624,CHAPTER III,was just one apiece for him.  I convinced him that his practical
1625,CHAPTER III,"inference was hasty and illogical, but in the mean time he had eaten the"
1626,CHAPTER III,peaches.]
1627,CHAPTER III,
1628,CHAPTER III,[Picture: The Young Fellow called John]
1629,CHAPTER III,
1630,CHAPTER III,--The opinions of relatives as to a man's powers are very commonly of
1631,CHAPTER III,little value; not merely because they sometimes overrate their own flesh
1632,CHAPTER III,"and blood, as some may suppose; on the contrary, they are quite as likely"
1633,CHAPTER III,to underrate those whom they have grown into the habit of considering
1634,CHAPTER III,like themselves.  The advent of genius is like what florists style the
1635,CHAPTER III,_breaking_ of a seedling tulip into what we may call high-caste
1636,CHAPTER III,"colors,--ten thousand dingy flowers, then one with the divine streak; or,"
1637,CHAPTER III,"if you prefer it, like the coming up in old Jacob's garden of that most"
1638,CHAPTER III,"gentlemanly little fruit, the seckel pear, which I have sometimes seen in"
1639,CHAPTER III,"shop-windows.  It is a surprise,--there is nothing to account for it."
1640,CHAPTER III,All at once we find that twice two make _five_.  Nature is fond of what
1641,CHAPTER III,"are called ""gift-enterprises.""  This little book of life which she has"
1642,CHAPTER III,given into the hands of its joint possessors is commonly one of the old
1643,CHAPTER III,story-books bound over again.  Only once in a great while there is a
1644,CHAPTER III,"stately poem in it, or its leaves are illuminated with the glories of"
1645,CHAPTER III,"art, or they enfold a draft for untold values signed by the million-fold"
1646,CHAPTER III,millionnaire old mother herself.  But strangers are commonly the first to
1647,CHAPTER III,"find the ""gift"" that came with the little book."
1648,CHAPTER III,
1649,CHAPTER III,It may be questioned whether anything can be conscious of its own flavor.
1650,CHAPTER III,"Whether the musk-deer, or the civet-cat, or even a still more eloquently"
1651,CHAPTER III,"silent animal that might be mentioned, is aware of any personal"
1652,CHAPTER III,"peculiarity, may well be doubted.  No man knows his own voice; many men"
1653,CHAPTER III,do not know their own profiles.  Every one remembers Carlyle's famous
1654,CHAPTER III,"""Characteristics"" article; allow for exaggerations, and there is a great"
1655,CHAPTER III,deal in his doctrine of the self-unconsciousness of genius.  It comes
1656,CHAPTER III,under the great law just stated.  This incapacity of knowing its own
1657,CHAPTER III,traits is often found in the family as well as in the individual.  So
1658,CHAPTER III,"never mind what your cousins, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and the"
1659,CHAPTER III,"rest, say about that fine poem you have written, but send it"
1660,CHAPTER III,"(postage-paid) to the editors, if there are any, of the"
1661,CHAPTER III,"""Atlantic,""--which, by the way, is not so called because it is _a"
1662,CHAPTER III,"notion_, as some dull wits wish they had said, but are too late."
1663,CHAPTER III,
1664,CHAPTER III,"--Scientific knowledge, even in the most modest persons, has mingled with"
1665,CHAPTER III,"it a something which partakes of insolence.  Absolute, peremptory facts"
1666,CHAPTER III,"are bullies, and those who keep company with them are apt to get a"
1667,CHAPTER III,"bullying habit of mind;--not of manners, perhaps; they may be soft and"
1668,CHAPTER III,"smooth, but the smile they carry has a quiet assertion in it, such as the"
1669,CHAPTER III,"Champion of the Heavy Weights, commonly the best-natured, but not the"
1670,CHAPTER III,"most diffident of men, wears upon what he very inelegantly calls his"
1671,CHAPTER III,"""mug.""  Take the man, for instance, who deals in the mathematical"
1672,CHAPTER III,sciences.  There is no elasticity in a mathematical fact; if you bring up
1673,CHAPTER III,"against it, it never yields a hair's breadth; everything must go to"
1674,CHAPTER III,pieces that comes in collision with it.  What the mathematician knows
1675,CHAPTER III,"being absolute, unconditional, incapable of suffering question, it should"
1676,CHAPTER III,"tend, in the nature of things, to breed a despotic way of thinking.  So"
1677,CHAPTER III,of those who deal with the palpable and often unmistakable facts of
1678,CHAPTER III,external nature; only in a less degree.  Every probability--and most of

1687,CHAPTER III,science I am referring to.  I know that as well as you.  But mark this
1688,CHAPTER III,which I am going to say once for all: If I had not force enough to
1689,CHAPTER III,project a principle full in the face of the half dozen most obvious facts
1690,CHAPTER III,"which seem to contradict it, I would think only in single file from this"
1691,CHAPTER III,"day forward.  A rash man, once visiting a certain noted institution at"
1692,CHAPTER III,"South Boston, ventured to express the sentiment, that man is a rational"
1693,CHAPTER III,being.  An old woman who was an attendant in the Idiot School
1694,CHAPTER III,"contradicted the statement, and appealed to the facts before the speaker"
1695,CHAPTER III,"to disprove it.  The rash man stuck to his hasty generalization,"
1696,CHAPTER III,notwithstanding.
1697,CHAPTER III,
1698,CHAPTER III,[--It is my desire to be useful to those with whom I am associated in my
1699,CHAPTER III,daily relations.  I not unfrequently practise the divine art of music in
1700,CHAPTER III,"company with our landlady's daughter, who, as I mentioned before, is the"
1701,CHAPTER III,owner of an accordion.  Having myself a well-marked barytone voice of
1702,CHAPTER III,"more than half an octave in compass, I sometimes add my vocal powers to"
1703,CHAPTER III,her execution of

1706,CHAPTER III,
1707,CHAPTER III,"not, however, unless her mother or some other discreet female is present,"
1708,CHAPTER III,to prevent misinterpretation or remark.  I have also taken a good deal of
1709,CHAPTER III,"interest in Benjamin Franklin, before referred to, sometimes called B."
1710,CHAPTER III,"F., or more frequently Frank, in imitation of that felicitous"
1711,CHAPTER III,"abbreviation, combining dignity and convenience, adopted by some of his"
1712,CHAPTER III,"betters.  My acquaintance with the French language is very imperfect, I"
1713,CHAPTER III,"having never studied it anywhere but in Paris, which is awkward, as B. F."
1714,CHAPTER III,devotes himself to it with the peculiar advantage of an Alsacian teacher.
1715,CHAPTER III,"The boy, I think, is doing well, between us, notwithstanding.  The"
1716,CHAPTER III,"following is an _uncorrected_ French exercise, written by this young"
1717,CHAPTER III,gentleman.  His mother thinks it very creditable to his abilities;

1731,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,il est d'une sagacite et d'une vitesse extraordinaire quand il s'agit
1732,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"de saisir un journal nouveau.  On ne sait pas pourquoi il lit,"
1733,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"parcequ'il ne parait pas avoir des idees.  Il vocalise rarement, mais"
1734,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"en revanche, il fait des bruits nasaux divers.  Il porte un crayon"

1752,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"tout, du tout."
1753,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1754,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"I think this exercise, which I have not corrected, or allowed to be"
1755,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"touched in any way, is not discreditable to B. F.  You observe that he is"
1756,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,acquiring a knowledge of zoology at the same time that he is learning
1757,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,French.  Fathers of families in moderate circumstances will find it
1758,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"profitable to their children, and an economical mode of instruction, to"
1759,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,set them to revising and amending this boy's exercise.  The passage was
1760,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"originally taken from the ""Histoire Naturelle des Betes Ruminans et"
1761,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Rongeurs, Bipedes et Autres,"" lately published in Paris.  This was"
1762,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,translated into English and published in London.  It was republished at
1763,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Great Pedlington, with notes and additions by the American editor.  The"
1764,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"notes consist of an interrogation-mark on page 53d, and a reference (p."
1765,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"127th) to another book ""edited"" by the same hand.  The additions consist"
1766,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"of the editor's name on the title-page and back, with a complete and"
1767,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,authentic list of said editor's honorary titles in the first of these
1768,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,localities.  Our boy translated the translation back into French.  This
1769,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"may be compared with the original, to be found on Shelf 13, Division X,"
1770,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,of the Public Library of this metropolis.]
1771,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1772,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,--Some of you boarders ask me from time to time why I don't write a
1773,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"story, or a novel, or something of that kind.  Instead of answering each"
1774,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"one of you separately, I will thank you to step up into the wholesale"
1775,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"department for a few moments, where I deal in answers by the piece and by"
1776,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,the bale.
1777,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1778,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,That every articulately-speaking human being has in him stuff for _one_
1779,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,novel in three volumes duodecimo has long been with me a cherished
1780,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"belief.  It has been maintained, on the other hand, that many persons"
1781,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"cannot write more than one novel,--that all after that are likely to be"
1782,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,failures.--Life is so much more tremendous a thing in its heights and
1783,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"depths than any transcript of it can be, that all records of human"
1784,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"experience are as so many bound _herbaria_ to the innumerable glowing,"
1785,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"glistening, rustling, breathing, fragrance-laden, poison-sucking,"
1786,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"life-giving, death-distilling leaves and flowers of the forest and the"
1787,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,prairies.  All we can do with books of human experience is to make them
1788,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,alive again with something borrowed from our own lives.  We can make a
1789,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,book alive for us just in proportion to its resemblance in essence or in
1790,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,form to our own experience.  Now an author's first novel is naturally
1791,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"drawn, to a great extent, from his personal experiences; that is, is a"
1792,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,literal copy of nature under various slight disguises.  But the moment
1793,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"the author gets out of his personality, he must have the creative power,"
1794,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"as well as the narrative art and the sentiment, in order to tell a living"
1795,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,story; and this is rare.
1796,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1797,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Besides, there is great danger that a man's first life-story shall clean"
1798,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"him out, so to speak, of his best thoughts.  Most lives, though their"
1799,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"stream is loaded with sand and turbid with alluvial waste, drop a few"
1800,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,golden grains of wisdom as they flow along.  Oftentimes a single
1801,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"_cradling_ gets them all, and after that the poor man's labor is only"
1802,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"rewarded by mud and worn pebbles.  All which proves that I, as an"
1803,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"individual of the human family, could write one novel or story at any"
1804,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"rate, if I would."
1805,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1806,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"--Why don't I, then?--Well, there are several reasons against it.  In the"
1807,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"first place, I should tell all my secrets, and I maintain that verse is"
1808,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,the proper medium for such revelations.  Rhythm and rhyme and the
1809,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"harmonies of musical language, the play of fancy, the fire of"
1810,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"imagination, the flashes of passion, so hide the nakedness of a heart"
1811,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"laid open, that hardly any confession, transfigured in the luminous halo"
1812,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"of poetry, is reproached as self-exposure.  A beauty shows herself under"
1813,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"the chandeliers, protected by the glitter of her diamonds, with such a"
1814,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"broad snowdrift of white arms and shoulders laid bare, that, were she"
1815,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"unadorned and in plain calico, she would be unendurable--in the opinion"
1816,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,of the ladies.
1817,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1818,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Again, I am terribly afraid I should show up all my friends.  I should"
1819,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,like to know if all story-tellers do not do this?  Now I am afraid all my
1820,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,friends would not bear showing up very well; for they have an average
1821,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"share of the common weakness of humanity, which I am pretty certain would"
1822,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,come out.  Of all that have told stories among us there is hardly one I
1823,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,can recall who has not drawn too faithfully some living portrait that
1824,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,might better have been spared.
1825,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1826,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Once more, I have sometimes thought it possible I might be too dull to"
1827,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,write such a story as I should wish to write.
1828,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1829,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"And finally, I think it very likely I _shall_ write a story one of these"
1830,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"days.  Don't be surprised at any time, if you see me coming out with ""The"
1831,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Schoolmistress,"" or ""The Old Gentleman Opposite.""  [_Our_ schoolmistress"
1832,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,and _our_ old gentleman that sits opposite had left the table before I
1833,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"said this.]  I want my glory for writing the same discounted now, on the"
1834,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"spot, if you please.  I will write when I get ready.  How many people"
1835,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,live on the reputation of the reputation they might have made!
1836,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1837,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,--I saw you smiled when I spoke about the possibility of my being too
1838,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,dull to write a good story.  I don't pretend to know what you meant by
1839,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"it, but I take occasion to make a remark which may hereafter prove of"
1840,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,value to some among you.--When one of us who has been led by native
1841,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,vanity or senseless flattery to think himself or herself possessed of
1842,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,talent arrives at the full and final conclusion that he or she is really
1843,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"dull, it is one of the most tranquillizing and blessed convictions that"
1844,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"can enter a mortal's mind.  All our failures, our shortcomings, our"
1845,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,strange disappointments in the effect of our efforts are lifted from our
1846,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"bruised shoulders, and fall, like Christian's pack, at the feet of that"
1847,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,Omnipotence which has seen fit to deny us the pleasant gift of high
1848,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"intelligence,--with which one look may overflow us in some wider sphere"
1849,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,of being.
1850,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1851,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"--How sweetly and honestly one said to me the other day, ""I hate books!"""
1852,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"A gentleman,--singularly free from affectations,--not learned, of course,"
1853,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"but of perfect breeding, which is often so much better than learning,--by"
1854,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"no means dull, in the sense of knowledge of the world and society, but"
1855,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"certainly not clever either in the arts or sciences,--his company is"
1856,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,pleasing to all who know him.  I did not recognize in him inferiority of
1857,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,literary taste half so distinctly as I did simplicity of character and
1858,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"fearless acknowledgment of his inaptitude for scholarship.  In fact, I"
1859,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"think there are a great many gentlemen and others, who read with a mark"
1860,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"to keep their place, that really ""hate books,"" but never had the wit to"
1861,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"find it out, or the manliness to own it.  [_Entre nous_, I always read"
1862,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,with a mark.]
1863,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1864,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"We get into a way of thinking as if what we call an ""intellectual man"""
1865,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"was, as a matter of course, made up of nine-tenths, or thereabouts, of"
1866,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"book-learning, and one-tenth himself.  But even if he is actually so"
1867,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"compounded, he need not read much.  Society is a strong solution of"
1868,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"books.  It draws the virtue out of what is best worth reading, as hot"
1869,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"water draws the strength of tea-leaves.  If _I_ were a prince, I would"
1870,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"hire or buy a private literary tea-pot, in which I would steep all the"
1871,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,leaves of new books that promised well.  The infusion would do for me
1872,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,without the vegetable fibre.  You understand me; I would have a person
1873,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"whose sole business should be to read day and night, and talk to me"
1874,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"whenever I wanted him to.  I know the man I would have: a quick-witted,"
1875,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"out-spoken, incisive fellow; knows history, or at any rate has a shelf"
1876,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"full of books about it, which he can use handily, and the same of all"
1877,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"useful arts and sciences; knows all the common plots of plays and novels,"
1878,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,and the stock company of characters that are continually coming on in new
1879,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"costume; can give you a criticism of an octavo in an epithet and a wink,"
1880,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,and you can depend on it; cares for nobody except for the virtue there is
1881,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"in what he says; delights in taking off big wigs and professional gowns,"
1882,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,and in the disembalming and unbandaging of all literary mummies.  Yet he
1883,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"is as tender and reverential to all that bears the mark of genius,--that"
1884,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"is, of a new influx of truth or beauty,--as a nun over her missal.  In"
1885,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"short, he is one of those men that know everything except how to make a"
1886,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,living.  Him would I keep on the square next my own royal compartment on
1887,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"life's chessboard.  To him I would push up another pawn, in the shape of"
1888,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"a comely and wise young woman, whom he would of course take--to wife."
1889,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"For all contingencies I would liberally provide.  In a word, I would, in"
1890,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"the plebeian, but expressive phrase, ""put him through"" all the material"
1891,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"part of life; see him sheltered, warmed, fed, button-mended, and all"
1892,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"that, just to be able to lay on his talk when I liked,--with the"
1893,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,privilege of shutting it off at will.
1894,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1895,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"A Club is the next best thing to this, strung like a harp, with about a"
1896,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"dozen ringing intelligences, each answering to some chord of the"
1897,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,macrocosm.  They do well to dine together once in a while.  A
1898,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,dinner-party made up of such elements is the last triumph of civilization
1899,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,over barbarism.  Nature and art combine to charm the senses; the
1900,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,equatorial zone of the system is soothed by well-studied artifices; the
1901,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"faculties are off duty, and fall into their natural attitudes; you see"
1902,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,wisdom in slippers and science in a short jacket.
1903,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1904,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,The whole force of conversation depends on how much you can take for
1905,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,granted.  Vulgar chess-players have to play their game out; nothing short
1906,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,of the brutality of an actual checkmate satisfies their dull
1907,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,apprehensions.  But look at two masters of that noble game!  White stands
1908,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"well enough, so far as you can see; but Red says, Mate in six"
1909,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"moves;--White looks,--nods;--the game is over.  Just so in talking with"
1910,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"first-rate men; especially when they are good-natured and expansive, as"
1911,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,they are apt to be at table.  That blessed clairvoyance which sees into
1912,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"things without opening them,--that glorious license, which, having shut"
1913,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"the door and driven the reporter from its key-hole, calls upon Truth,"
1914,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,majestic virgin! to get off from her pedestal and drop her academic
1915,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"poses, and take a festive garland and the vacant place on the _medius"
1916,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"lectus_,--that carnival-shower of questions and replies and comments,"
1917,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,large axioms bowled over the mahogany like bomb-shells from professional
1918,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"mortars, and explosive wit dropping its trains of many-colored fire, and"
1919,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,the mischief-making rain of _bon-bons_ pelting everybody that shows
1920,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"himself,--the picture of a truly intellectual banquet is one which the"
1921,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,old Divinities might well have attempted to reproduce in their--
1922,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1923,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"--""Oh, oh, oh!"" cried the young fellow whom they call John,--""that is"

1928,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"""The trail of the serpent is over them all!"""
1929,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,
1930,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"All lecturers, all professors, all schoolmasters, have ruts and grooves"
1931,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,in their minds into which their conversation is perpetually sliding.  Did
1932,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"you never, in riding through the woods of a still June evening, suddenly"
1933,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"feel that you had passed into a warm stratum of air, and in a minute or"
1934,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"two strike the chill layer of atmosphere beyond?  Did you never, in"
1935,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"cleaving the green waters of the Back Bay,--where the Provincial"
1936,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"blue-noses are in the habit of beating the ""Metropolitan"""
1937,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"boat-clubs,--find yourself in a tepid streak, a narrow, local"
1938,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"gulf-stream, a gratuitous warm-bath a little underdone, through which"
1939,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"your glistening shoulders soon flashed, to bring you back to the cold"
1940,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"realities of full-sea temperature?  Just so, in talking with any of the"
1941,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"characters above referred to, one not unfrequently finds a sudden change"
1942,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,in the style of the conversation.  The lack-lustre eye rayless as a
1943,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"Beacon-Street door-plate in August, all at once fills with light; the"
1944,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,face flings itself wide open like the church-portals when the bride and
1945,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"bridegroom enter; the little man grows in stature before your eyes, like"
1946,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"the small prisoner with hair on end, beloved yet dreaded of early"
1947,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"childhood; you were talking with a dwarf and an imbecile,--you have a"

1949,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"of a fifty-dollar lecture.--As when, at some unlooked-for moment, the"
1950,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,mighty fountain-column springs into the air before the astonished
1951,LE RAT DES SALONS A LECTURE.,"passer-by,--silver-footed, diamond-crowned, rainbow-scarfed,--from the"

2080,CHAPTER IV,
2081,CHAPTER IV,"My dear friends, one and all, I can do nothing but report such remarks as"
2082,CHAPTER IV,I happen to have made at our breakfast-table.  Their character will
2083,CHAPTER IV,"depend on many accidents,--a good deal on the particular persons in the"
2084,CHAPTER IV,company to whom they were addressed.  It so happens that those which
2085,CHAPTER IV,follow were mainly intended for the divinity-student and the
2086,CHAPTER IV,"school-mistress; though others, whom I need not mention, saw to"
2087,CHAPTER IV,"interfere, with more or less propriety, in the conversation.  This is one"

2099,CHAPTER IV,"etiquette.  So the bathycolpian Here--Juno, in Latin--sent down Iris"
2100,CHAPTER IV,instead.  But I was mightily pleased to see that one of the gentlemen
2101,CHAPTER IV,"that do the heavy articles for the celebrated ""Oceanic Miscellany"""
2102,CHAPTER IV,"misquoted Campbell's line without any excuse.  ""Waft us _home_ the"

2110,CHAPTER IV,"They are sucked up by two cupping vessels,"
2111,CHAPTER IV,"(""cotyloid""--cup-like--cavities,) and held there as long as you live, and"
2112,CHAPTER IV,"longer.  At any rate, you think you move them backward and forward at"
2113,CHAPTER IV,"such a rate as your will determines, don't you?--On the contrary, they"
2114,CHAPTER IV,"swing just as any other pendulums swing, at a fixed rate, determined by"
2115,CHAPTER IV,"their length.  You can alter this by muscular power, as you can take hold"

2134,CHAPTER IV,"Such or such a thought comes round periodically, in its turn.  Accidental"

2139,CHAPTER IV,"week, but that a year would hardly go round without your having them pass"
2140,CHAPTER IV,through your mind.  Here is one which comes up at intervals in this way.
2141,CHAPTER IV,"Some one speaks of it, and there is an instant and eager smile of assent"
2142,CHAPTER IV,"in the listener or listeners.  Yes, indeed; they have often been struck"
2143,CHAPTER IV,by it.

2145,CHAPTER IV,_All at once a conviction flashes through us that we have been in the

2149,CHAPTER IV,"O, dear, yes!--said one of the company,--everybody has had that feeling."
2150,CHAPTER IV,
2151,CHAPTER IV,The landlady didn't know anything about such notions; it was an idee in
2152,CHAPTER IV,"folks' heads, she expected."
2153,CHAPTER IV,
2154,CHAPTER IV,"The schoolmistress said, in a hesitating sort of way, that she knew the"
2155,CHAPTER IV,"feeling well, and didn't like to experience it; it made her think she was"
2156,CHAPTER IV,"a ghost, sometimes."
2157,CHAPTER IV,
2158,CHAPTER IV,The young fellow whom they call John said he knew all about it; he had
2159,CHAPTER IV,"just lighted a cheroot the other day, when a tremendous conviction all at"
2160,CHAPTER IV,once came over him that he had done just that same thing ever so many
2161,CHAPTER IV,"times before.  I looked severely at him, and his countenance immediately"
2162,CHAPTER IV,"fell--_on the side toward me_; I cannot answer for the other, for he can"
2163,CHAPTER IV,wink and laugh with either half of his face without the other half's
2164,CHAPTER IV,knowing it.
2165,CHAPTER IV,
2166,CHAPTER IV,--I have noticed--I went on to say--the following circumstances connected
2167,CHAPTER IV,"with these sudden impressions.  First, that the condition which seems to"
2168,CHAPTER IV,"be the duplicate of a former one is often very trivial,--one that might"
2169,CHAPTER IV,"have presented itself a hundred times.  Secondly, that the impression is"
2170,CHAPTER IV,"very evanescent, and that it is rarely, if ever, recalled by any"
2171,CHAPTER IV,"voluntary effort, at least after any time has elapsed.  Thirdly, that"
2172,CHAPTER IV,"there is a disinclination to record the circumstances, and a sense of"
2173,CHAPTER IV,"incapacity to reproduce the state of mind in words.  Fourthly, I have"
2174,CHAPTER IV,often felt that the duplicate condition had not only occurred once
2175,CHAPTER IV,"before, but that it was familiar and, as it seemed, habitual.  Lastly, I"
2176,CHAPTER IV,have had the same convictions in my dreams.
2177,CHAPTER IV,
2178,CHAPTER IV,"How do I account for it?--Why, there are several ways that I can mention,"
2179,CHAPTER IV,and you may take your choice.  The first is that which the young lady
2180,CHAPTER IV,hinted at;--that these flashes are sudden recollections of a previous
2181,CHAPTER IV,existence.  I don't believe that; for I remember a poor student I used to
2182,CHAPTER IV,know told me he had such a conviction one day when he was blacking his
2183,CHAPTER IV,"boots, and I can't think he had ever lived in another world where they"
2184,CHAPTER IV,use Day and Martin.
2185,CHAPTER IV,
2186,CHAPTER IV,"Some think that Dr. Wigan's doctrine of the brain's being a double organ,"
2187,CHAPTER IV,"its hemispheres working together like the two eyes, accounts for it.  One"
2188,CHAPTER IV,"of the hemispheres hangs fire, they suppose, and the small interval"
2189,CHAPTER IV,between the perceptions of the nimble and the sluggish half seems an
2190,CHAPTER IV,"indefinitely long period, and therefore the second perception appears to"
2191,CHAPTER IV,"be the copy of another, ever so old.  But even allowing the centre of"
2192,CHAPTER IV,"perception to be double, I can see no good reason for supposing this"
2193,CHAPTER IV,"indefinite lengthening of the time, nor any analogy that bears it out."
2194,CHAPTER IV,It seems to me most likely that the coincidence of circumstances is very
2195,CHAPTER IV,"partial, but that we take this partial resemblance for identity, as we"
2196,CHAPTER IV,occasionally do resemblances of persons.  A momentary posture of
2197,CHAPTER IV,circumstances is so far like some preceding one that we accept it as
2198,CHAPTER IV,"exactly the same, just as we accost a stranger occasionally, mistaking"
2199,CHAPTER IV,"him for a friend.  The apparent similarity may be owing perhaps, quite as"
2200,CHAPTER IV,"much to the mental state at the time, as to the outward circumstances."
2201,CHAPTER IV,
2202,CHAPTER IV,"--Here is another of these curiously recurring remarks.  I have said it,"
2203,CHAPTER IV,"and heard it many times, and occasionally met with something like it in"
2204,CHAPTER IV,"books,--somewhere in Bulwer's novels, I think, and in one of the works of"
2205,CHAPTER IV,"Mr. Olmsted, I know."
2206,CHAPTER IV,
2207,CHAPTER IV,"_Memory_, _imagination_, _old sentiments and associations_, _are more"
2208,CHAPTER IV,readily reached through the sense of_ SMELL _than by almost any other
2209,CHAPTER IV,channel_.
2210,CHAPTER IV,
2211,CHAPTER IV,Of course the particular odors which act upon each person's
2212,CHAPTER IV,"susceptibilities differ.--O, yes!  I will tell you some of mine.  The"
2213,CHAPTER IV,smell of _phosphorus_ is one of them.  During a year or two of
2214,CHAPTER IV,"adolescence I used to be dabbling in chemistry a good deal, and as about"
2215,CHAPTER IV,"that time I had my little aspirations and passions like another, some of"
2216,CHAPTER IV,these things got mixed up with each other: orange-colored fumes of
2217,CHAPTER IV,"nitrous acid, and visions as bright and transient; reddening"
2218,CHAPTER IV,"litmus-paper, and blushing cheeks;--_eheu_!"
2219,CHAPTER IV,
2220,CHAPTER IV,"""Soles occidere et redire possunt,"""
2221,CHAPTER IV,
2222,CHAPTER IV,but there is no reagent that will redden the faded roses of eighteen
2223,CHAPTER IV,"hundred and--spare them!  But, as I was saying, phosphorus fires this"
2224,CHAPTER IV,train of associations in an instant; its luminous vapors with their
2225,CHAPTER IV,penetrating odor throw me into a trance; it comes to me in a double sense
2226,CHAPTER IV,"""trailing clouds of glory.""  Only the confounded Vienna matches, _ohne"
2227,CHAPTER IV,"phosphor-geruch_, have worn my sensibilities a little."
2228,CHAPTER IV,
2229,CHAPTER IV,"Then there is the _marigold_.  When I was of smallest dimensions, and"
2230,CHAPTER IV,"wont to ride impacted between the knees of fond parental pair, we would"
2231,CHAPTER IV,sometimes cross the bridge to the next village-town and stop opposite a
2232,CHAPTER IV,"low, brown, ""gambrel-roofed"" cottage.  Out of it would come one Sally,"
2233,CHAPTER IV,"sister of its swarthy tenant, swarthy herself, shady-lipped, sad-voiced,"
2234,CHAPTER IV,"and, bending over her flower-bed, would gather a ""posy,"" as she called"
2235,CHAPTER IV,"it, for the little boy.  Sally lies in the churchyard with a slab of blue"
2236,CHAPTER IV,"slate at her head, lichen-crusted, and leaning a little within the last"
2237,CHAPTER IV,"few years.  Cottage, garden-beds, posies, grenadier-like rows of seedling"
2238,CHAPTER IV,"onions,--stateliest of vegetables,--all are gone, but the breath of a"
2239,CHAPTER IV,marigold brings them all back to me.
2240,CHAPTER IV,
2241,CHAPTER IV,"Perhaps the herb _everlasting_, the fragrant _immortelle_ of our autumn"
2242,CHAPTER IV,"fields, has the most suggestive odor to me of all those that set me"
2243,CHAPTER IV,dreaming.  I can hardly describe the strange thoughts and emotions that
2244,CHAPTER IV,"come to me as I inhale the aroma of its pale, dry, rustling flowers.  A"
2245,CHAPTER IV,"something it has of sepulchral spicery, as if it had been brought from"
2246,CHAPTER IV,"the core of some great pyramid, where it had lain on the breast of a"
2247,CHAPTER IV,"mummied Pharaoh.  Something, too, of immortality in the sad, faint"
2248,CHAPTER IV,sweetness lingering so long in its lifeless petals.  Yet this does not
2249,CHAPTER IV,tell why it fills my eyes with tears and carries me in blissful thought
2250,CHAPTER IV,to the banks of asphodel that border the River of Life.
2251,CHAPTER IV,
2252,CHAPTER IV,"--I should not have talked so much about these personal susceptibilities,"
2253,CHAPTER IV,if I had not a remark to make about them which I believe is a new one.
2254,CHAPTER IV,It is this.  There may be a physical reason for the strange connection
2255,CHAPTER IV,between the sense of smell and the mind.  The olfactory nerve--so my
2256,CHAPTER IV,"friend, the Professor, tells me--is the only one directly connected with"
2257,CHAPTER IV,"the hemispheres of the brain, the parts in which, as we have every reason"
2258,CHAPTER IV,"to believe, the intellectual processes are performed.  To speak more"
2259,CHAPTER IV,"truly the olfactory ""nerve"" is not a nerve at all, he says, but a part of"
2260,CHAPTER IV,"the brain, in intimate connection with its anterior lobes.  Whether this"
2261,CHAPTER IV,"anatomical arrangement is at the bottom of the facts I have mentioned, I"
2262,CHAPTER IV,"will not decide, but it is curious enough to be worth remembering."
2263,CHAPTER IV,"Contrast the sense of taste, as a source of suggestive impressions, with"
2264,CHAPTER IV,that of smell.  Now the Professor assures me that you will find the nerve
2265,CHAPTER IV,"of taste has no immediate connection with the brain proper, but only with"
2266,CHAPTER IV,the prolongation of the spinal cord.
2267,CHAPTER IV,
2268,CHAPTER IV,"[The old gentleman opposite did not pay much attention, I think, to this"
2269,CHAPTER IV,hypothesis of mine.  But while I was speaking about the sense of smell he
2270,CHAPTER IV,"nestled about in his seat, and presently succeeded in getting out a large"
2271,CHAPTER IV,"red bandanna handkerchief.  Then he lurched a little to the other side,"
2272,CHAPTER IV,and after much tribulation at last extricated an ample round snuff-box.
2273,CHAPTER IV,"I looked as he opened it and felt for the wonted pugil.  Moist rappee,"
2274,CHAPTER IV,and a Tonka-bean lying therein.  I made the manual sign understood of all
2275,CHAPTER IV,"mankind that use the precious dust, and presently my brain, too,"
2276,CHAPTER IV,"responded to the long unused stimulus--O boys,--that were,--actual papas"
2277,CHAPTER IV,"and possible grandpapas,--some of you with crowns like"

2279,CHAPTER IV,"sabled,--do you remember, as you doze over this, those after-dinners at"
2280,CHAPTER IV,"the Trois Freres when the Scotch-plaided snuff-box went round, and the"
2281,CHAPTER IV,dry Lundy-Foot tickled its way along into our happy sensoria?  Then it
2282,CHAPTER IV,"was that the Chambertin or the Clos Vougeot came in, slumbering in its"
2283,CHAPTER IV,"straw cradle.  And one among you,--do you remember how he would have a"
2284,CHAPTER IV,"bit of ice always in his Burgundy, and sit tinkling it against the sides"
2285,CHAPTER IV,"of the bubble-like glass, saying that he was hearing the cow-bells as he"
2286,CHAPTER IV,"used to hear them, when the deep-breathing kine came home at twilight"
2287,CHAPTER IV,"from the huckleberry pasture, in the old home a thousand leagues towards"
2288,CHAPTER IV,the sunset?]
2289,CHAPTER IV,
2290,CHAPTER IV,Ah me! what strains and strophes of unwritten verse pulsate through my
2291,CHAPTER IV,soul when I open a certain closet in the ancient house where I was born!
2292,CHAPTER IV,On its shelves used to lie bundles of sweet-marjoram and pennyroyal and
2293,CHAPTER IV,lavender and mint and catnip; there apples were stored until their seeds
2294,CHAPTER IV,"should grow black, which happy period there were sharp little milk-teeth"
2295,CHAPTER IV,"always ready to anticipate; there peaches lay in the dark, thinking of"
2296,CHAPTER IV,"the sunshine they had lost, until, like the hearts of saints that dream"
2297,CHAPTER IV,"of heaven in their sorrow, they grew fragrant as the breath of angels."
2298,CHAPTER IV,The odorous echo of a score of dead summers lingers yet in those dim
2299,CHAPTER IV,recesses.
2300,CHAPTER IV,
2301,CHAPTER IV,"--Do I remember Byron's line about ""striking the electric chain""?--To be"
2302,CHAPTER IV,sure I do.  I sometimes think the less the hint that stirs the automatic
2303,CHAPTER IV,"machinery of association, the more easily this moves us.  What can be"
2304,CHAPTER IV,more trivial than that old story of opening the folio Shakspeare that
2305,CHAPTER IV,used to lie in some ancient English hall and finding the flakes of
2306,CHAPTER IV,"Christmas pastry between its leaves, shut up in them perhaps a hundred"
2307,CHAPTER IV,"years ago?  And, lo! as one looks on these poor relics of a bygone"
2308,CHAPTER IV,"generation, the universe changes in the twinkling of an eye; old George"
2309,CHAPTER IV,"the Second is back again, and the elder Pitt is coming into power, and"
2310,CHAPTER IV,"General Wolfe is a fine, promising young man, and over the Channel they"
2311,CHAPTER IV,"are pulling the Sieur Damiens to pieces with wild horses, and across the"
2312,CHAPTER IV,Atlantic the Indians are tomahawking Hirams and Jonathans and Jonases at
2313,CHAPTER IV,Fort William Henry; all the dead people who have been in the dust so
2314,CHAPTER IV,long--even to the stout-armed cook that made the pastry--are alive again;
2315,CHAPTER IV,"the planet unwinds a hundred of its luminous coils, and the precession of"
2316,CHAPTER IV,the equinoxes is retraced on the dial of heaven!  And all this for a bit
2317,CHAPTER IV,of pie-crust!
2318,CHAPTER IV,
2319,CHAPTER IV,"--I will thank you for that pie,--said the provoking young fellow whom I"
2320,CHAPTER IV,"have named repeatedly.  He looked at it for a moment, and put his hands"
2321,CHAPTER IV,"to his eyes as if moved.--I was thinking,--he said indistinctly--"
2322,CHAPTER IV,
2323,CHAPTER IV,--How?  What is't?--said our landlady.
2324,CHAPTER IV,
2325,CHAPTER IV,--I was thinking--said he--who was king of England when this old pie was
2326,CHAPTER IV,"baked,--and it made me feel bad to think how long he must have been dead."
2327,CHAPTER IV,
2328,CHAPTER IV,"[Our landlady is a decent body, poor, and a widow, of course; _cela va"
2329,CHAPTER IV,sans dire_.  She told me her story once; it was as if a grain of corn
2330,CHAPTER IV,that had been ground and bolted had tried to individualize itself by a
2331,CHAPTER IV,"special narrative.  There was the wooing and the wedding,--the start in"
2332,CHAPTER IV,"life,--the disappointments,--the children she had buried,--the struggle"
2333,CHAPTER IV,"against fate,--the dismantling of life, first of its small luxuries, and"
2334,CHAPTER IV,"then of its comforts,--the broken spirits,--the altered character of the"
2335,CHAPTER IV,"one on whom she leaned,--and at last the death that came and drew the"
2336,CHAPTER IV,black curtain between her and all her earthly hopes.
2337,CHAPTER IV,
2338,CHAPTER IV,"I never laughed at my landlady after she had told me her story, but I"
2339,CHAPTER IV,"often cried,--not those pattering tears that run off the eaves upon our"
2340,CHAPTER IV,"neighbors' grounds, the _stillicidium_ of self-conscious sentiment, but"
2341,CHAPTER IV,those which steal noiselessly through their conduits until they reach the
2342,CHAPTER IV,cisterns lying round about the heart; those tears that we weep inwardly
2343,CHAPTER IV,with unchanging features;--such I did shed for her often when the imps of
2344,CHAPTER IV,the boarding-house Inferno tugged at her soul with their red-hot
2345,CHAPTER IV,pincers.]
2346,CHAPTER IV,
2347,CHAPTER IV,"Young man,--I said,--the pasty you speak lightly of is not old, but"
2348,CHAPTER IV,"courtesy to those who labor to serve us, especially if they are of the"
2349,CHAPTER IV,"weaker sex, is very old, and yet well worth retaining.  May I recommend"
2350,CHAPTER IV,"to you the following caution, as a guide, whenever you are dealing with a"
2351,CHAPTER IV,"woman, or an artist, or a poet--if you are handling an editor or"
2352,CHAPTER IV,"politician, it is superfluous advice.  I take it from the back of one of"
2353,CHAPTER IV,those little French toys which contain pasteboard figures moved by a
2354,CHAPTER IV,small running stream of fine sand; Benjamin Franklin will translate it
2355,CHAPTER IV,"for you: ""_Quoiqu'elle soit tres solidement montee_, _il faut ne pas_"
2356,CHAPTER IV,"BRUTALISER _la machine_.""--I will thank you for the pie, if you please."
2357,CHAPTER IV,
2358,CHAPTER IV,"[I took more of it than was good for me--as much as 85, I should"
2359,CHAPTER IV,"think,--and had an indigestion in consequence.  While I was suffering"
2360,CHAPTER IV,"from it, I wrote some sadly desponding poems, and a theological essay"
2361,CHAPTER IV,which took a very melancholy view of creation.  When I got better I
2362,CHAPTER IV,"labelled them all ""Pie-crust,"" and laid them by as scarecrows and solemn"
2363,CHAPTER IV,warnings.  I have a number of books on my shelves that I should like to
2364,CHAPTER IV,"label with some such title; but, as they have great names on their"
2365,CHAPTER IV,"title-pages,--Doctors of Divinity, some of them,--it wouldn't do.]"
2366,CHAPTER IV,
2367,CHAPTER IV,"--My friend, the Professor, whom I have mentioned to you once or twice,"
2368,CHAPTER IV,told me yesterday that somebody had been abusing him in some of the
2369,CHAPTER IV,journals of his calling.  I told him that I didn't doubt he deserved it;
2370,CHAPTER IV,"that I hoped he did deserve a little abuse occasionally, and would for a"
2371,CHAPTER IV,number of years to come; that nobody could do anything to make his
2372,CHAPTER IV,neighbors wiser or better without being liable to abuse for it;
2373,CHAPTER IV,"especially that people hated to have their little mistakes made fun of,"
2374,CHAPTER IV,and perhaps he had been doing something of the kind.--The Professor
2375,CHAPTER IV,"smiled.--Now, said I, hear what I am going to say.  It will not take many"
2376,CHAPTER IV,"years to bring you to the period of life when men, at least the majority"
2377,CHAPTER IV,"of writing and talking men, do nothing but praise.  Men, like peaches and"
2378,CHAPTER IV,"pears, grow sweet a little while before they begin to decay.  I don't"
2379,CHAPTER IV,"know what it is,--whether a spontaneous change, mental or bodily, or"
2380,CHAPTER IV,whether it is thorough experience of the thanklessness of critical
2381,CHAPTER IV,"honesty,--but it is a fact, that most writers, except sour and"
2382,CHAPTER IV,"unsuccessful ones, get tired of finding fault at about the time when they"
2383,CHAPTER IV,"are beginning to grow old.  As a general thing, I would not give a great"
2384,CHAPTER IV,"deal for the fair words of a critic, if he is himself an author, over"
2385,CHAPTER IV,fifty years of age.  At thirty we are all trying to cut our names in big
2386,CHAPTER IV,letters upon the walls of this tenement of life; twenty years later we
2387,CHAPTER IV,"have carved it, or shut up our jack-knives.  Then we are ready to help"
2388,CHAPTER IV,"others, and care less to hinder any, because nobody's elbows are in our"
2389,CHAPTER IV,way.  So I am glad you have a little life left; you will be saccharine
2390,CHAPTER IV,enough in a few years.
2391,CHAPTER IV,
2392,CHAPTER IV,--Some of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me very much
2393,CHAPTER IV,in what I have heard or seen here and elsewhere.  I just now spoke of the
2394,CHAPTER IV,sweetening process that authors undergo.  Do you know that in the gradual
2395,CHAPTER IV,passage from maturity to helplessness the harshest characters sometimes
2396,CHAPTER IV,have a period in which they are gentle and placid as young children?  I
2397,CHAPTER IV,"have heard it said, but I cannot be sponsor for its truth, that the"
2398,CHAPTER IV,"famous chieftain, Lochiel, was rocked in a cradle like a baby, in his old"
2399,CHAPTER IV,"age.  An old man, whose studies had been of the severest scholastic kind,"
2400,CHAPTER IV,used to love to hear little nursery-stories read over and over to him.
2401,CHAPTER IV,One who saw the Duke of Wellington in his last years describes him as
2402,CHAPTER IV,very gentle in his aspect and demeanor.  I remember a person of
2403,CHAPTER IV,singularly stern and lofty bearing who became remarkably gracious and
2404,CHAPTER IV,easy in all his ways in the later period of his life.
2405,CHAPTER IV,
2406,CHAPTER IV,And that leads me to say that men often remind me of pears in their way
2407,CHAPTER IV,"of coming to maturity.  Some are ripe at twenty, like human Jargonelles,"
2408,CHAPTER IV,"and must be made the most of, for their day is soon over.  Some come into"
2409,CHAPTER IV,"their perfect condition late, like the autumn kinds, and they last better"
2410,CHAPTER IV,"than the summer fruit.  And some, that, like the Winter-Nelis, have been"
2411,CHAPTER IV,"hard and uninviting until all the rest have had their season, get their"
2412,CHAPTER IV,glow and perfume long after the frost and snow have done their worst with
2413,CHAPTER IV,the orchards.  Beware of rash criticisms; the rough and stringent fruit
2414,CHAPTER IV,"you condemn may be an autumn or a winter pear, and that which you picked"
2415,CHAPTER IV,up beneath the same bough in August may have been only its worm-eaten
2416,CHAPTER IV,windfalls.  Milton was a Saint-Germain with a graft of the roseate
2417,CHAPTER IV,"Early-Catherine.  Rich, juicy, lively, fragrant, russet skinned old"
2418,CHAPTER IV,Chaucer was an Easter-Beurre; the buds of a new summer were swelling when
2419,CHAPTER IV,he ripened.
2420,CHAPTER IV,
2421,CHAPTER IV,--There is no power I envy so much--said the divinity-student--as that of
2422,CHAPTER IV,seeing analogies and making comparisons.  I don't understand how it is
2423,CHAPTER IV,that some minds are continually coupling thoughts or objects that seem
2424,CHAPTER IV,"not in the least related to each other, until all at once they are put in"
2425,CHAPTER IV,"a certain light, and you wonder that you did not always see that they"
2426,CHAPTER IV,were as like as a pair of twins.  It appears to me a sort of miraculous
2427,CHAPTER IV,gift.
2428,CHAPTER IV,
2429,CHAPTER IV,"[He is rather a nice young man, and I think has an appreciation of the"
2430,CHAPTER IV,higher mental qualities remarkable for one of his years and training.  I
2431,CHAPTER IV,"try his head occasionally as housewives try eggs,--give it an"
2432,CHAPTER IV,"intellectual shake and hold it up to the light, so to speak, to see if it"
2433,CHAPTER IV,"has life in it, actual or potential, or only contains lifeless albumen.]"
2434,CHAPTER IV,
2435,CHAPTER IV,"You call it _miraculous_,--I replied,--tossing the expression with my"
2436,CHAPTER IV,"facial eminence, a little smartly, I fear.--Two men are walking by the"
2437,CHAPTER IV,"polyphloesboean ocean, one of them having a small tin cup with which he"
2438,CHAPTER IV,"can scoop up a gill of sea-water when he will, and the other nothing but"
2439,CHAPTER IV,"his hands, which will hardly hold water at all,--and you call the tin cup"
2440,CHAPTER IV,"a miraculous possession!  It is the ocean that is the miracle, my infant"
2441,CHAPTER IV,"apostle!  Nothing is clearer than that all things are in all things, and"
2442,CHAPTER IV,that just according to the intensity and extension of our mental being we
2443,CHAPTER IV,shall see the many in the one and the one in the many.  Did Sir Isaac
2444,CHAPTER IV,"think what he was saying when he made _his_ speech about the ocean,--the"
2445,CHAPTER IV,"child and the pebbles, you know?  Did he mean to speak slightingly of a"
2446,CHAPTER IV,pebble?  Of a spherical solid which stood sentinel over its compartment
2447,CHAPTER IV,"of space before the stone that became the pyramids had grown solid, and"
2448,CHAPTER IV,has watched it until now!  A body which knows all the currents of force
2449,CHAPTER IV,that traverse the globe; which holds by invisible threads to the ring of
2450,CHAPTER IV,Saturn and the belt of Orion!  A body from the contemplation of which an
2451,CHAPTER IV,archangel could infer the entire inorganic universe as the simplest of
2452,CHAPTER IV,"corollaries!  A throne of the all-pervading Deity, who has guided its"
2453,CHAPTER IV,every atom since the rosary of heaven was strung with beaded stars!
2454,CHAPTER IV,
2455,CHAPTER IV,"So,--to return to _our_ walk by the ocean,--if all that poetry has"
2456,CHAPTER IV,"dreamed, all that insanity has raved, all that maddening narcotics have"
2457,CHAPTER IV,"driven through the brains of men, or smothered passion nursed in the"
2458,CHAPTER IV,"fancies of women,--if the dreams of colleges and convents and"
2459,CHAPTER IV,"boarding-schools,--if every human feeling that sighs, or smiles, or"
2460,CHAPTER IV,"curses, or shrieks, or groans, should bring all their innumerable images,"
2461,CHAPTER IV,"such as come with every hurried heart-beat,--the epic which held them"
2462,CHAPTER IV,"all, though its letters filled the zodiac, would be but a cupful from the"
2463,CHAPTER IV,infinite ocean of similitudes and analogies that rolls through the
2464,CHAPTER IV,universe.
2465,CHAPTER IV,
2466,CHAPTER IV,[The divinity-student honored himself by the way in which he received
2467,CHAPTER IV,"this.  He did not swallow it at once, neither did he reject it; but he"
2468,CHAPTER IV,"took it as a pickerel takes the bait, and carried it off with him to his"
2469,CHAPTER IV,hole (in the fourth story) to deal with at his leisure.]
2470,CHAPTER IV,
2471,CHAPTER IV,--Here is another remark made for his especial benefit.--There is a
2472,CHAPTER IV,natural tendency in many persons to run their adjectives together in
2473,CHAPTER IV,"_triads_, as I have heard them called,--thus: He was honorable,"
2474,CHAPTER IV,"courteous, and brave; she was graceful, pleasing, and virtuous.  Dr."
2475,CHAPTER IV,Johnson is famous for this; I think it was Bulwer who said you could
2476,CHAPTER IV,"separate a paper in the ""Rambler"" into three distinct essays.  Many of"
2477,CHAPTER IV,"our writers show the same tendency,--my friend, the Professor,"
2478,CHAPTER IV,"especially.  Some think it is in humble imitation of Johnson,--some that"
2479,CHAPTER IV,it is for the sake of the stately sound only.  I don't think they get to
2480,CHAPTER IV,"the bottom of it.  It is, I suspect, an instinctive and involuntary"
2481,CHAPTER IV,effort of the mind to present a thought or image with the _three
2482,CHAPTER IV,"dimensions_ that belong to every solid,--an unconscious handling of an"
2483,CHAPTER IV,"idea as if it had length, breadth, and thickness.  It is a great deal"
2484,CHAPTER IV,"easier to say this than to prove it, and a great deal easier to dispute"
2485,CHAPTER IV,"it than to disprove it.  But mind this: the more we observe and study,"
2486,CHAPTER IV,the wider we find the range of the automatic and instinctive principles
2487,CHAPTER IV,"in body, mind, and morals, and the narrower the limits of the"
2488,CHAPTER IV,self-determining conscious movement.
2489,CHAPTER IV,
2490,CHAPTER IV,--I have often seen piano-forte players and singers make such strange
2491,CHAPTER IV,motions over their instruments or song-books that I wanted to laugh at
2492,CHAPTER IV,"them.  ""Where did our friends pick up all these fine ecstatic airs?"" I"
2493,CHAPTER IV,"would say to myself.  Then I would remember My Lady in ""Marriage a la"
2494,CHAPTER IV,"Mode,"" and amuse myself with thinking how affectation was the same thing"
2495,CHAPTER IV,in Hogarth's time and in our own.  But one day I bought me a Canary-bird
2496,CHAPTER IV,and hung him up in a cage at my window.  By-and-by he found himself at
2497,CHAPTER IV,"home, and began to pipe his little tunes; and there he was, sure enough,"
2498,CHAPTER IV,"swimming and waving about, with all the droopings and liftings and"
2499,CHAPTER IV,languishing side-turnings of the head that I had laughed at.  And now I
2500,CHAPTER IV,"should like to ask, WHO taught him all this?--and me, through him, that"
2501,CHAPTER IV,the foolish head was not the one swinging itself from side to side and
2502,CHAPTER IV,"bowing and nodding over the music, but that other which was passing its"
2503,CHAPTER IV,shallow and self-satisfied judgment on a creature made of finer clay than
2504,CHAPTER IV,the frame which carried that same head upon its shoulders?
2505,CHAPTER IV,
2506,CHAPTER IV,"--Do you want an image of the human will, or the self-determining"
2507,CHAPTER IV,"principle, as compared with its prearranged and impassable restrictions?"
2508,CHAPTER IV,"A drop of water, imprisoned in a crystal; you may see such a one in any"
2509,CHAPTER IV,mineralogical collection.  One little fluid particle in the crystalline
2510,CHAPTER IV,prism of the solid universe!
2511,CHAPTER IV,
2512,CHAPTER IV,"--Weaken moral obligations?--No, not weaken, but define them.  When I"

2517,CHAPTER IV,
2518,CHAPTER IV,I should have to begin with one most formidable preliminary.  You saw an
2519,CHAPTER IV,"article the other day in one of the journals, perhaps, in which some old"
2520,CHAPTER IV,Doctor or other said quietly that patients were very apt to be fools and
2521,CHAPTER IV,cowards.  But a great many of the clergyman's patients are not only fools
2522,CHAPTER IV,"and cowards, but also liars."

2599,CHAPTER IV,"improvement in modern theology, it is in getting out of the region of"
2600,CHAPTER IV,pure abstractions and taking these every-day working forces into account.
2601,CHAPTER IV,The great theological question now heaving and throbbing in the minds of
2602,CHAPTER IV,Christian men is this:--
2603,CHAPTER IV,
2604,CHAPTER IV,"No, I wont talk about these things now.  My remarks might be repeated,"
2605,CHAPTER IV,and it would give my friends pain to see with what personal incivilities
2606,CHAPTER IV,"I should be visited.  Besides, what business has a mere boarder to be"
2607,CHAPTER IV,talking about such things at a breakfast-table?  Let him make puns.  To
2608,CHAPTER IV,"be sure, he was brought up among the Christian fathers, and learned his"
2609,CHAPTER IV,"alphabet out of a quarto ""Concilium Tridentinum.""  He has also heard many"
2610,CHAPTER IV,thousand theological lectures by men of various denominations; and it is
2611,CHAPTER IV,"not at all to the credit of these teachers, if he is not fit by this time"
2612,CHAPTER IV,to express an opinion on theological matters.
2613,CHAPTER IV,
2614,CHAPTER IV,I know well enough that there are some of you who had a great deal rather
2615,CHAPTER IV,see me stand on my head than use it for any purpose of thought.  Does not
2616,CHAPTER IV,"my friend, the Professor, receive at least two letters a week, requesting"
2617,CHAPTER IV,"him to. . . . ,--on the strength of some youthful antic of his, which, no"
2618,CHAPTER IV,"doubt, authorizes the intelligent constituency of autograph-hunters to"
2619,CHAPTER IV,address him as a harlequin?
2620,CHAPTER IV,
2621,CHAPTER IV,"--Well, I can't be savage with you for wanting to laugh, and I like to"
2622,CHAPTER IV,"make you laugh, well enough, when I can.  But then observe this: if the"
2623,CHAPTER IV,"sense of the ridiculous is one side of an impressible nature, it is very"
2624,CHAPTER IV,"well; but if that is all there is in a man, he had better have been an"
2625,CHAPTER IV,"ape at once, and so have stood at the head of his profession.  Laughter"
2626,CHAPTER IV,and tears are meant to turn the wheels of the same machinery of
2627,CHAPTER IV,"sensibility; one is wind-power, and the other water-power; that is all."
2628,CHAPTER IV,I have often heard the Professor talk about hysterics as being Nature's
2629,CHAPTER IV,cleverest illustration of the reciprocal convertibility of the two states
2630,CHAPTER IV,of which these acts are the manifestations; But you may see it every day
2631,CHAPTER IV,in children; and if you want to choke with stifled tears at sight of the
2632,CHAPTER IV,"transition, as it shows itself in older years, go and see Mr. Blake play"
2633,CHAPTER IV,_Jesse Rural_.
2634,CHAPTER IV,
2635,CHAPTER IV,It is a very dangerous thing for a literary man to indulge his love for
2636,CHAPTER IV,the ridiculous.  People laugh _with_ him just so long as he amuses them;
2637,CHAPTER IV,"but if he attempts to be serious, they must still have their laugh, and"
2638,CHAPTER IV,"so they laugh _at_ him.  There is in addition, however, a deeper reason"
2639,CHAPTER IV,for this than would at first appear.  Do you know that you feel a little
2640,CHAPTER IV,"superior to every man who makes you laugh, whether by making faces or"
2641,CHAPTER IV,"verses?  Are you aware that you have a pleasant sense of patronizing him,"
2642,CHAPTER IV,"when you condescend so far as to let him turn somersets, literal or"
2643,CHAPTER IV,"literary, for your royal delight?  Now if a man can only be allowed to"
2644,CHAPTER IV,"stand on a dais, or raised platform, and look down on his neighbor who is"
2645,CHAPTER IV,"exerting his talent for him, oh, it is all right!--first-rate"
2646,CHAPTER IV,performance!--and all the rest of the fine phrases.  But if all at once
2647,CHAPTER IV,"the performer asks the gentleman to come upon the floor, and, stepping"
2648,CHAPTER IV,"upon the platform, begins to talk down at him,--ah, that wasn't in the"
2649,CHAPTER IV,programme!
2650,CHAPTER IV,
2651,CHAPTER IV,"I have never forgotten what happened when Sydney Smith--who, as everybody"
2652,CHAPTER IV,"knows, was an exceedingly sensible man, and a gentleman, every inch of"
2653,CHAPTER IV,him--ventured to preach a sermon on the Duties of Royalty.  The
2654,CHAPTER IV,"""Quarterly,"" ""so savage and tartarly,"" came down upon him in the most"
2655,CHAPTER IV,"contemptuous style, as ""a joker of jokes,"" a ""diner-out of the first"
2656,CHAPTER IV,"water,"" in one of his own phrases; sneering at him, insulting him, as"
2657,CHAPTER IV,"nothing but a toady of a court, sneaking behind the anonymous, would ever"
2658,CHAPTER IV,"have been mean enough to do to a man of his position and genius, or to"
2659,CHAPTER IV,any decent person even.--If I were giving advice to a young fellow of
2660,CHAPTER IV,"talent, with two or three facets to his mind, I would tell him by all"
2661,CHAPTER IV,means to keep his wit in the background until after he had made a
2662,CHAPTER IV,reputation by his more solid qualities.  And so to an actor: _Hamlet_
2663,CHAPTER IV,"first, and _Bob Logic_ afterwards, if you like; but don't think, as they"
2664,CHAPTER IV,"say poor Liston used to, that people will be ready to allow that you can"
2665,CHAPTER IV,do anything great with _Macbeth's_ dagger after flourishing about with
2666,CHAPTER IV,"_Paul Pry's_ umbrella.  Do you know, too, that the majority of men look"
2667,CHAPTER IV,"upon all who challenge their attention,--for a while, at least,--as"
2668,CHAPTER IV,"beggars, and nuisances?  They always try to get off as cheaply as they"
2669,CHAPTER IV,can; and the cheapest of all things they can give a literary man--pardon
2670,CHAPTER IV,the forlorn pleasantry!--is the _funny_-bone.  That is all very well so
2671,CHAPTER IV,"far as it goes, but satisfies no man, and makes a good many angry, as I"
2672,CHAPTER IV,told you on a former occasion.
2673,CHAPTER IV,
2674,CHAPTER IV,"--Oh, indeed, no!--I am not ashamed to make you laugh, occasionally.  I"
2675,CHAPTER IV,think I could read you something I have in my desk which would probably
2676,CHAPTER IV,"make you smile.  Perhaps I will read it one of these days, if you are"
2677,CHAPTER IV,patient with me when I am sentimental and reflective; not just now.  The
2678,CHAPTER IV,"ludicrous has its place in the universe; it is not a human invention, but"
2679,CHAPTER IV,"one of the Divine ideas, illustrated in the practical jokes of kittens"
2680,CHAPTER IV,and monkeys long before Aristophanes or Shakspeare.  How curious it is
2681,CHAPTER IV,that we always consider solemnity and the absence of all gay surprises
2682,CHAPTER IV,and encounter of wits as essential to the idea of the future life of
2683,CHAPTER IV,those whom we thus deprive of half their faculties and then call
2684,CHAPTER IV,"_blessed_!  There are not a few who, even in this life, seem to be"
2685,CHAPTER IV,preparing themselves for that smileless eternity to which they look
2686,CHAPTER IV,"forward, by banishing all gayety from their hearts and all joyousness"
2687,CHAPTER IV,"from their countenances.  I meet one such in the street not unfrequently,"
2688,CHAPTER IV,"a person of intelligence and education, but who gives me (and all that he"
2689,CHAPTER IV,"passes) such a rayless and chilling look of recognition,--something as if"
2690,CHAPTER IV,"he were one of Heaven's assessors, come down to ""doom"" every acquaintance"
2691,CHAPTER IV,"he met,--that I have sometimes begun to sneeze on the spot, and gone home"
2692,CHAPTER IV,"with a violent cold, dating from that instant.  I don't doubt he would"
2693,CHAPTER IV,"cut his kitten's tail off, if he caught her playing with it.  Please tell"
2694,CHAPTER IV,"me, who taught her to play with it?"
2695,CHAPTER IV,
2696,CHAPTER IV,"No, no!--give me a chance to talk to you, my fellow-boarders, and you"
2697,CHAPTER IV,"need not be afraid that I shall have any scruples about entertaining you,"
2698,CHAPTER IV,"if I can do it, as well as giving you some of my serious thoughts, and"
2699,CHAPTER IV,perhaps my sadder fancies.  I know nothing in English or any other
2700,CHAPTER IV,"literature more admirable than that sentiment of Sir Thomas Browne ""EVERY"

2898,CHAPTER V,"fond of poetry when he was a boy,--his mother taught him to say many"
2899,CHAPTER V,"little pieces,--he remembered one beautiful hymn;--and the old gentleman"
2900,CHAPTER V,"began, in a clear, loud voice, for his years,--"
2901,CHAPTER V,
2902,CHAPTER V,"""The spacious firmament on high,"
2903,CHAPTER V,"With all the blue ethereal sky,"
2904,CHAPTER V,"And spangled heavens,""--"
2905,CHAPTER V,
2906,CHAPTER V,"He stopped, as if startled by our silence, and a faint flush ran up"
2907,CHAPTER V,beneath the thin white hairs that fell upon his cheek.  As I looked
2908,CHAPTER V,"round, I was reminded of a show I once saw at the Museum,--the Sleeping"
2909,CHAPTER V,"Beauty, I think they called it.  The old man's sudden breaking out in"
2910,CHAPTER V,"this way turned every face towards him, and each kept his posture as if"
2911,CHAPTER V,"changed to stone.  Our Celtic Bridget, or Biddy, is not a foolish fat"
2912,CHAPTER V,"scullion to burst out crying for a sentiment.  She is of the serviceable,"
2913,CHAPTER V,"red-handed, broad-and-high-shouldered type; one of those imported female"
2914,CHAPTER V,"servants who are known in public by their amorphous style of person,"
2915,CHAPTER V,"their stoop forwards, and a headlong and as it were precipitous"
2916,CHAPTER V,"walk,--the waist plunging downwards into the rocking pelvis at every"
2917,CHAPTER V,"heavy footfall.  Bridget, constituted for action, not for emotion, was"
2918,CHAPTER V,"about to deposit a plate heaped with something upon the table, when I saw"
2919,CHAPTER V,"the coarse arm stretched by my shoulder arrested,--motionless as the arm"
2920,CHAPTER V,of a terra-cotta caryatid; she couldn't set the plate down while the old
2921,CHAPTER V,gentleman was speaking!
2922,CHAPTER V,
2923,CHAPTER V,"He was quite silent after this, still wearing the slight flush on his"
2924,CHAPTER V,cheek.  Don't ever think the poetry is dead in an old man because his
2925,CHAPTER V,"forehead is wrinkled, or that his manhood has left him when his hand"
2926,CHAPTER V,"trembles!  If they ever _were_ there, they _are_ there still!"
2927,CHAPTER V,
2928,CHAPTER V,By and by we got talking again.--Does a poet love the verses written
2929,CHAPTER V,"through him, do you think, Sir?--said the divinity-student."
2930,CHAPTER V,
2931,CHAPTER V,"So long as they are warm from his mind, carry any of his animal heat"
2932,CHAPTER V,"about them, _I know_ he loves them,--I answered.  When they have had time"
2933,CHAPTER V,"to cool, he is more indifferent."
2934,CHAPTER V,
2935,CHAPTER V,"A good deal as it is with buckwheat cakes,--said the young fellow whom"
2936,CHAPTER V,they call John.
2937,CHAPTER V,
2938,CHAPTER V,"The last words, only, reached the ear of the economically organized"
2939,CHAPTER V,"female in black bombazine.--Buckwheat is skerce and high,--she remarked."
2940,CHAPTER V,"[Must be a poor relation sponging on our landlady,--pays nothing,--so she"
2941,CHAPTER V,must stand by the guns and be ready to repel boarders.]
2942,CHAPTER V,
2943,CHAPTER V,"I liked the turn the conversation had taken, for I had some things I"
2944,CHAPTER V,"wanted to say, and so, after waiting a minute, I began again.--I don't"
2945,CHAPTER V,"think the poems I read you sometimes can be fairly appreciated, given to"
2946,CHAPTER V,you as they are in the green state.
2947,CHAPTER V,
2948,CHAPTER V,"--You don't know what I mean by the _green state_?  Well, then, I will"
2949,CHAPTER V,tell you.  Certain things are good for nothing until they have been kept
2950,CHAPTER V,a long while; and some are good for nothing until they have been long
2951,CHAPTER V,"kept and _used_.  Of the first, wine is the illustrious and immortal"
2952,CHAPTER V,example.  Of those which must be kept and used I will name
2953,CHAPTER V,"three,--meerschaum pipes, violins, and poems.  The meerschaum is but a"
2954,CHAPTER V,poor affair until it has burned a thousand offerings to the
2955,CHAPTER V,cloud-compelling deities.  It comes to us without complexion or
2956,CHAPTER V,"flavor,--born of the sea-foam, like Aphrodite, but colorless as _pallida"
2957,CHAPTER V,"Mors_ herself.  The fire is lighted in its central shrine, and gradually"
2958,CHAPTER V,the juices which the broad leaves of the Great Vegetable had sucked up
2959,CHAPTER V,from an acre and curdled into a drachm are diffused through its thirsting
2960,CHAPTER V,"pores.  First a discoloration, then a stain, and at last a rich, glowing,"
2961,CHAPTER V,umber tint spreading over the whole surface.  Nature true to her old
2962,CHAPTER V,"brown autumnal hue, you see,--as true in the fire of the meerschaum as in"
2963,CHAPTER V,the sunshine of October!  And then the cumulative wealth of its fragrant
2964,CHAPTER V,reminiscences! he who inhales its vapors takes a thousand whiffs in a
2965,CHAPTER V,single breath; and one cannot touch it without awakening the old joys
2966,CHAPTER V,that hang around it as the smell of flowers clings to the dresses of the
2967,CHAPTER V,daughters of the house of Farina!
2968,CHAPTER V,
2969,CHAPTER V,"[Don't think I use a meerschaum myself, for _I do not_, though I have"
2970,CHAPTER V,"owned a calumet since my childhood, which from a naked Pict (of the"
2971,CHAPTER V,"Mohawk species) my grandsire won, together with a tomahawk and beaded"
2972,CHAPTER V,knife-sheath; paying for the lot with a bullet-mark on his right check.
2973,CHAPTER V,On the maternal side I inherit the loveliest silver-mounted
2974,CHAPTER V,"tobacco-stopper you ever saw.  It is a little box-wood Triton, carved"
2975,CHAPTER V,with charming liveliness and truth; I have often compared it to a figure
2976,CHAPTER V,"in Raphael's ""Triumph of Galatea.""  It came to me in an ancient shagreen"
2977,CHAPTER V,"case,--how old it is I do not know,--but it must have been made since Sir"
2978,CHAPTER V,"Walter Raleigh's time.  If you are curious, you shall see it any day."
2979,CHAPTER V,Neither will I pretend that I am so unused to the more perishable smoking
2980,CHAPTER V,contrivance that a few whiffs would make me feel as if I lay in a
2981,CHAPTER V,ground-swell on the Bay of Biscay.  I am not unacquainted with that
2982,CHAPTER V,"fusiform, spiral-wound bundle of chopped stems and miscellaneous"
2983,CHAPTER V,"incombustibles, the _cigar_, so called, of the shops,--which to ""draw"""
2984,CHAPTER V,"asks the suction-power of a nursling infant Hercules, and to relish, the"
2985,CHAPTER V,"leathery palate of an old Silenus.  I do not advise you, young man, even"
2986,CHAPTER V,"if my illustration strike your fancy, to consecrate the flower of your"
2987,CHAPTER V,"life to painting the bowl of a pipe, for, let me assure you, the stain of"
2988,CHAPTER V,a reverie-breeding narcotic may strike deeper than you think for.  I have
2989,CHAPTER V,seen the green leaf of early promise grow brown before its time under
2990,CHAPTER V,"such Nicotian regimen, and thought the umbered meerschaum was dearly"
2991,CHAPTER V,bought at the cost of a brain enfeebled and a will enslaved.]
2992,CHAPTER V,
2993,CHAPTER V,"Violins, too,--the sweet old Amati!--the divine Stradivarius!  Played on"
2994,CHAPTER V,by ancient _maestros_ until the bow-hand lost its power and the flying
2995,CHAPTER V,"fingers stiffened.  Bequeathed to the passionate, young enthusiast, who"
2996,CHAPTER V,"made it whisper his hidden love, and cry his inarticulate longings, and"
2997,CHAPTER V,"scream his untold agonies, and wail his monotonous despair.  Passed from"
2998,CHAPTER V,"his dying hand to the cold _virtuoso_, who let it slumber in its case for"
2999,CHAPTER V,"a generation, till, when his hoard was broken up, it came forth once more"
3000,CHAPTER V,"and rode the stormy symphonies of royal orchestras, beneath the rushing"
3001,CHAPTER V,bow of their lord and leader.  Into lonely prisons with improvident
3002,CHAPTER V,"artists; into convents from which arose, day and night, the holy hymns"
3003,CHAPTER V,with which its tones were blended; and back again to orgies in which it
3004,CHAPTER V,learned to howl and laugh as if a legion of devils were shut up in it;
3005,CHAPTER V,then again to the gentle _dilettante_ who calmed it down with easy
3006,CHAPTER V,melodies until it answered him softly as in the days of the old
3007,CHAPTER V,"_maestros_.  And so given into our hands, its pores all full of music;"
3008,CHAPTER V,"stained, like the meerschaum, through and through, with the concentrated"
3009,CHAPTER V,hue and sweetness of all the harmonies which have kindled and faded on
3010,CHAPTER V,its strings.
3011,CHAPTER V,
3012,CHAPTER V,"Now I tell you a poem must be kept _and used_, like a meerschaum, or a"
3013,CHAPTER V,violin.  A poem is just as porous as the meerschaum;--the more porous it
3014,CHAPTER V,"is, the better.  I mean to say that a genuine poem is capable of"
3015,CHAPTER V,"absorbing an indefinite amount of the essence of our own humanity,--its"
3016,CHAPTER V,"tenderness, its heroism, its regrets, its aspirations, so as to be"
3017,CHAPTER V,gradually stained through with a divine secondary color derived from
3018,CHAPTER V,ourselves.  So you see it must take time to bring the sentiment of a poem
3019,CHAPTER V,"into harmony with our nature, by staining ourselves through every thought"
3020,CHAPTER V,and image our being can penetrate.
3021,CHAPTER V,
3022,CHAPTER V,"Then again as to the mere music of a new poem; why, who can expect"
3023,CHAPTER V,anything more from that than from the music of a violin fresh from the
3024,CHAPTER V,maker's hands?  Now you know very well that there are no less than
3025,CHAPTER V,fifty-eight different pieces in a violin.  These pieces are strangers to
3026,CHAPTER V,"each other, and it takes a century, more or less, to make them thoroughly"
3027,CHAPTER V,"acquainted.  At last they learn to vibrate in harmony, and the instrument"
3028,CHAPTER V,"becomes an organic whole, as if it were a great seed-capsule which had"
3029,CHAPTER V,"grown from a garden-bed in Cremona, or elsewhere.  Besides, the wood is"
3030,CHAPTER V,"juicy and full of sap for fifty years or so, but at the end of fifty or a"
3031,CHAPTER V,hundred more gets tolerably dry and comparatively resonant.
3032,CHAPTER V,
3033,CHAPTER V,Don't you see that all this is just as true of a poem?  Counting each
3034,CHAPTER V,"word as a piece, there are more pieces in an average copy of verses than"
3035,CHAPTER V,"in a violin.  The poet has forced all these words together, and fastened"
3036,CHAPTER V,"them, and they don't understand it at first.  But let the poem be"
3037,CHAPTER V,repeated aloud and murmured over in the mind's muffled whisper often
3038,CHAPTER V,"enough, and at length the parts become knit together in such absolute"
3039,CHAPTER V,solidarity that you could not change a syllable without the whole world's
3040,CHAPTER V,"crying out against you for meddling with the harmonious fabric.  Observe,"
3041,CHAPTER V,"too, how the drying process takes place in the stuff of a poem just as in"
3042,CHAPTER V,that of a violin.  Here is a Tyrolese fiddle that is just coming to its
3043,CHAPTER V,"hundredth birthday,--(Pedro Klauss, Tyroli, fecit, 1760,)--the sap is"
3044,CHAPTER V,pretty well out of it.  And here is the song of an old poet whom Neaera
3045,CHAPTER V,cheated.--
3046,CHAPTER V,
3047,CHAPTER V,"""Nox erat, et coelo fulgebat Luna sereno"
3048,CHAPTER V,"Inter minora sidera,"
3049,CHAPTER V,Cum tu magnorum numen laesura deorum
3050,CHAPTER V,"In verba jurabas mea."""
3051,CHAPTER V,
3052,CHAPTER V,Don't you perceive the sonorousness of these old dead Latin phrases?  Now
3053,CHAPTER V,"I tell you that, every word fresh from the dictionary brings with it a"
3054,CHAPTER V,certain succulence; and though I cannot expect the sheets of the
3055,CHAPTER V,"""Pactolian,"" in which, as I told you, I sometimes print my verses, to get"
3056,CHAPTER V,"so dry as the crisp papyrus that held those words of Horatius Flaccus,"
3057,CHAPTER V,"yet you may be sure, that, while the sheets are damp, and while the lines"
3058,CHAPTER V,"hold their sap, you can't fairly judge of my performances, and that, if"
3059,CHAPTER V,"made of the true stuff, they will ring better after a while."
3060,CHAPTER V,
3061,CHAPTER V,"[There was silence for a brief space, after my somewhat elaborate"
3062,CHAPTER V,exposition of these self-evident analogies.  Presently _a person_ turned
3063,CHAPTER V,towards me--I do not choose to designate the individual--and said that he
3064,CHAPTER V,"rather expected my pieces had given pretty good ""sahtisfahction.""--I had,"
3065,CHAPTER V,"up to this moment, considered this complimentary phrase as sacred to the"
3066,CHAPTER V,"use of secretaries of lyceums, and, as it has been usually accompanied by"
3067,CHAPTER V,"a small pecuniary testimonial, have acquired a certain relish for this"
3068,CHAPTER V,moderately tepid and unstimulating expression of enthusiasm.  But as a
3069,CHAPTER V,"reward for gratuitous services, I confess I thought it a little below"
3070,CHAPTER V,"that blood-heat standard which a man's breath ought to have, whether"
3071,CHAPTER V,"silent, or vocal and articulate.  I waited for a favorable opportunity,"
3072,CHAPTER V,"however, before making the remarks which follow.]"
3073,CHAPTER V,
3074,CHAPTER V,"--There are single expressions, as I have told you already, that fix a"
3075,CHAPTER V,man's position for you before you have done shaking hands with him.
3076,CHAPTER V,"Allow me to expand a little.  There are several things, very slight in"
3077,CHAPTER V,"themselves, yet implying other things not so unimportant.  Thus, your"
3078,CHAPTER V,"French servant has _devalise_ your premises and got caught.  _Excusez_,"
3079,CHAPTER V,"says the _sergent-de-ville_, as he politely relieves him of his upper"
3080,CHAPTER V,garments and displays his bust in the full daylight.  Good shoulders
3081,CHAPTER V,"enough,--a little marked,--traces of smallpox, perhaps,--but white. . . ."
3082,CHAPTER V,. _Crac_! from the _sergent-de-ville's_ broad palm on the white shoulder!
3083,CHAPTER V,Now look!  _Vogue la galere_!  Out comes the big red V--mark of the hot
3084,CHAPTER V,"iron;--he had blistered it out pretty nearly,--hadn't he?--the old rascal"
3085,CHAPTER V,"VOLEUR, branded in the galleys at Marseilles!  [Don't!  What if he has"
3086,CHAPTER V,got something like this?--nobody supposes I _invented_ such a story.]
3087,CHAPTER V,
3088,CHAPTER V,"My man John, who used to drive two of those six equine females which I"
3089,CHAPTER V,"told you I had owned,--for, look you, my friends, simple though I stand"
3090,CHAPTER V,"here, I am one that has been driven in his ""kerridge,""--not using that"
3091,CHAPTER V,"term, as liberal shepherds do, for any battered old shabby-genteel"
3092,CHAPTER V,"go-cart which has more than one wheel, but meaning thereby a four-wheeled"
3093,CHAPTER V,"vehicle _with a pole_,--my man John, I say, was a retired soldier.  He"
3094,CHAPTER V,"retired unostentatiously, as many of Her Majesty's modest servants have"
3095,CHAPTER V,"done before and since.  John told me, that when an officer thinks he"
3096,CHAPTER V,"recognizes one of these retiring heroes, and would know if he has really"
3097,CHAPTER V,"been in the service, that he may restore him, if possible, to a grateful"
3098,CHAPTER V,"country, he comes suddenly upon him, and says, sharply, ""Strap!""  If he"
3099,CHAPTER V,"has ever worn the shoulder-strap, he has learned the reprimand for its"
3100,CHAPTER V,"ill adjustment.  The old word of command flashes through his muscles, and"
3101,CHAPTER V,his hand goes up in an instant to the place where the strap used to be.
3102,CHAPTER V,
3103,CHAPTER V,"[I was all the time preparing for my grand _coup_, you understand; but I"
3104,CHAPTER V,"saw they were not quite ready for it, and so continued,--always in"
3105,CHAPTER V,illustration of the general principle I had laid down.]
3106,CHAPTER V,
3107,CHAPTER V,"Yes, odd things come out in ways that nobody thinks of.  There was a"
3108,CHAPTER V,"legend, that, when the Danish pirates made descents upon the English"
3109,CHAPTER V,"coast, they caught a few Tartars occasionally, in the shape of Saxons,"
3110,CHAPTER V,"who would not let them go,--on the contrary, insisted on their staying,"
3111,CHAPTER V,"and, to make sure of it, treated them as Apollo treated Marsyas, or an"
3112,CHAPTER V,"Bartholinus has treated a fellow-creature in his title-page, and, having"
3113,CHAPTER V,"divested them of the one essential and perfectly fitting garment,"
3114,CHAPTER V,"indispensable in the mildest climates, nailed the same on the church-door"
3115,CHAPTER V,"as we do the banns of marriage, _in terrorem_."
3116,CHAPTER V,
3117,CHAPTER V,[There was a laugh at this among some of the young folks; but as I looked
3118,CHAPTER V,"at our landlady, I saw that ""the water stood in her eyes,"" as it did in"
3119,CHAPTER V,"Christiana's when the interpreter asked her about the spider, and I"
3120,CHAPTER V,"fancied, but wasn't quite sure that the schoolmistress blushed, as Mercy"
3121,CHAPTER V,"did in the same conversation, as you remember.]"
3122,CHAPTER V,
3123,CHAPTER V,"That sounds like a cock-and-bull-story,--said the young fellow whom they"
3124,CHAPTER V,"call John.  I abstained from making Hamlet's remark to Horatio, and"
3125,CHAPTER V,continued.
3126,CHAPTER V,
3127,CHAPTER V,"Not long since, the church-wardens were repairing and beautifying an old"
3128,CHAPTER V,"Saxon church in a certain English village, and among other things thought"
3129,CHAPTER V,"the doors should be attended to.  One of them particularly, the"
3130,CHAPTER V,"front-door, looked very badly, crusted, as it were, and as if it would be"
3131,CHAPTER V,all the better for scraping.  There happened to be a microscopist in the
3132,CHAPTER V,"village who had heard the old pirate story, and he took it into his head"
3133,CHAPTER V,to examine the crust on this door.  There was no mistake about it; it was
3134,CHAPTER V,"a genuine historical document, of the Ziska drum-head pattern,--a real"
3135,CHAPTER V,"_cutis humana_, stripped from some old Scandinavian filibuster, and the"
3136,CHAPTER V,legend was true.
3137,CHAPTER V,
3138,CHAPTER V,"My friend, the Professor, settled an important historical and financial"
3139,CHAPTER V,question once by the aid of an exceedingly minute fragment of a similar
3140,CHAPTER V,document.  Behind the pane of plate-glass which bore his name and title
3141,CHAPTER V,"burned a modest lamp, signifying to the passers-by that at all hours of"
3142,CHAPTER V,the night the slightest favors (or fevers) were welcome.  A youth who had
3143,CHAPTER V,"freely partaken of the cup which cheers and likewise inebriates,"
3144,CHAPTER V,"following a moth-like impulse very natural under the circumstances,"
3145,CHAPTER V,"dashed his fist at the light and quenched the meek luminary,--breaking"
3146,CHAPTER V,"through the plate-glass, of course, to reach it.  Now I don't want to go"
3147,CHAPTER V,"into _minutiae_ at table, you know, but a naked hand can no more go"
3148,CHAPTER V,"through a pane of thick glass without leaving some of its cuticle, to say"
3149,CHAPTER V,"the least, behind it, than a butterfly can go through a sausage-machine"
3150,CHAPTER V,without looking the worse for it.  The Professor gathered up the
3151,CHAPTER V,"fragments of glass, and with them certain very minute but entirely"
3152,CHAPTER V,satisfactory documents which would have identified and hanged any rogue
3153,CHAPTER V,"in Christendom who had parted with them.--The historical question, _Who"
3154,CHAPTER V,"did it_? and the financial question, _Who paid for it_? were both settled"
3155,CHAPTER V,before the new lamp was lighted the next evening.
3156,CHAPTER V,
3157,CHAPTER V,"You see, my friends, what immense conclusions, touching our lives, our"
3158,CHAPTER V,"fortunes, and our sacred honor, may be reached by means of very"
3159,CHAPTER V,insignificant premises.  This is eminently true of manners and forms of
3160,CHAPTER V,speech; a movement or a phrase often tells you all you want to know about
3161,CHAPTER V,"a person.  Thus, ""How's your health?"" (commonly pronounced"
3162,CHAPTER V,"_haalth_)--instead of, How do you do? or, How are you?  Or calling your"
3163,CHAPTER V,"little dark entry a ""hall,"" and your old rickety one-horse wagon a"
3164,CHAPTER V,"""kerridge.""  Or telling a person who has been trying to please you that"
3165,CHAPTER V,"he has given you pretty good ""sahtisfahction.""  Or saying that you"
3166,CHAPTER V,"""remember of"" such a thing, or that you have been ""stoppin""' at Deacon"
3167,CHAPTER V,"Somebody's,--and other such expressions.  One of my friends had a little"
3168,CHAPTER V,"marble statuette of Cupid in the parlor of his country-house,--bow,"
3169,CHAPTER V,"arrows, wings, and all complete.  A visitor, indigenous to the region,"
3170,CHAPTER V,"looking pensively at the figure, asked the lady of the house ""if that was"
3171,CHAPTER V,"a statoo of her deceased infant?""  What a delicious, though somewhat"
3172,CHAPTER V,"voluminous biography, social, educational, and aesthetic in that brief"
3173,CHAPTER V,question!
3174,CHAPTER V,
3175,CHAPTER V,[Please observe with what Machiavellian astuteness I smuggled in the
3176,CHAPTER V,particular offence which it was my object to hold up to my
3177,CHAPTER V,"fellow-boarders, without too personal an attack on the individual at"
3178,CHAPTER V,whose door it lay.]
3179,CHAPTER V,
3180,CHAPTER V,"That was an exceedingly dull person who made the remark, _Ex pede"
3181,CHAPTER V,"Herculem_.  He might as well have said, ""From a peck of apples you may"
3182,CHAPTER V,"judge of the barrel.""  _Ex_ PEDE, to be sure!  Read, instead, _Ex ungue"
3183,CHAPTER V,"minimi digiti pedis_, _Herculem_, _ejusque patrem_, _matrem_, _avos et"
3184,CHAPTER V,"proavos_, _filios_, _nepotes et pronepotes_!  Talk to me about your!"
3185,CHAPTER V,"Tell me about Cuvier's getting up a megatherium from a tooth, or"
3186,CHAPTER V,Agassiz's drawing a portrait of an undiscovered fish from a single scale!
3187,CHAPTER V,"As the ""O"" revealed Giotto,--as the one word ""moi"" betrayed the Stratford"
3188,CHAPTER V,"atte-Bowe-taught Anglais,--so all a man's antecedents and possibilities"
3189,CHAPTER V,are summed up in a single utterance which gives at once the gauge of his
3190,CHAPTER V,education and his mental organization.
3191,CHAPTER V,
3192,CHAPTER V,"Possibilities, Sir?--said the divinity-student; can't a man who says"
3193,CHAPTER V,_Haow_? arrive at distinction?
3194,CHAPTER V,
3195,CHAPTER V,"Sir,--I replied,--in a republic all things are possible.  But the man"
3196,CHAPTER V,_with a future_ has almost of necessity sense enough to see that any
3197,CHAPTER V,odious trick of speech or manners must be got rid of.  Doesn't Sydney
3198,CHAPTER V,Smith say that a public man in England never gets over a false quantity
3199,CHAPTER V,uttered in early life?  _Our_ public men are in little danger of this
3200,CHAPTER V,"fatal misstep, as few of them are in the habit of introducing Latin into"
3201,CHAPTER V,"their speeches,--for good and sufficient reasons.  But they are bound to"
3202,CHAPTER V,"speak decent English,--unless, indeed, they are rough old campaigners,"
3203,CHAPTER V,"like General Jackson or General Taylor; in which case, a few scars on"
3204,CHAPTER V,Priscian's head are pardoned to old fellows who have quite as many on
3205,CHAPTER V,"their own, and a constituency of thirty empires is not at all particular,"
3206,CHAPTER V,provided they do not swear in their Presidential Messages.
3207,CHAPTER V,
3208,CHAPTER V,"However, it is not for me to talk.  I have made mistakes enough in"
3209,CHAPTER V,conversation and print.  I never find them out until they are
3210,CHAPTER V,"stereotyped, and then I think they rarely escape me.  I have no doubt I"
3211,CHAPTER V,"shall make half a dozen slips before this breakfast is over, and remember"
3212,CHAPTER V,them all before another.  How one does tremble with rage at his own

3234,CHAPTER V,"Did you never, in walking in the fields, come across a large flat stone,"
3235,CHAPTER V,"which had lain, nobody knows how long, just where you found it, with the"
3236,CHAPTER V,"grass forming a little hedge, as it were, all round it, close to its"
3237,CHAPTER V,"edges,--and have you not, in obedience to a kind of feeling that told you"
3238,CHAPTER V,"it had been lying there long enough, insinuated your stick or your foot"
3239,CHAPTER V,or your fingers under its edge and turned it over as a housewife turns a
3240,CHAPTER V,"cake, when she says to herself, ""It's done brown enough by this time""?"
3241,CHAPTER V,"What an odd revelation, and what an unforeseen and unpleasant surprise to"
3242,CHAPTER V,"a small community, the very existence of which you had not suspected,"
3243,CHAPTER V,until the sudden dismay and scattering among its members produced by your
3244,CHAPTER V,"turning the old stone over!  Blades of grass flattened down, colorless,"
3245,CHAPTER V,"matted together, as if they had been bleached and ironed; hideous"
3246,CHAPTER V,"crawling creatures, some of them coleopterous or"
3247,CHAPTER V,"horny-shelled,--turtle-bugs one wants to call them; some of them softer,"
3248,CHAPTER V,but cunningly spread out and compressed like Lepine watches; (Nature
3249,CHAPTER V,"never loses a crack or a crevice, mind you, or a joint in a tavern"

3252,CHAPTER V,"sticking out like the whips of four-horse stage-coaches; motionless,"
3253,CHAPTER V,"slug-like creatures, young larvae, perhaps more horrible in their pulpy"
3254,CHAPTER V,stillness than even in the infernal wriggle of maturity!  But no sooner
3255,CHAPTER V,is the stone turned and the wholesome light of day let upon this
3256,CHAPTER V,"compressed and blinded community of creeping things, than all of them"
3257,CHAPTER V,which enjoy the luxury of legs--and some of them have a good many--rush
3258,CHAPTER V,"round wildly, butting each other and everything in their way, and end in"
3259,CHAPTER V,a general stampede for underground retreats from the region poisoned by
3260,CHAPTER V,sunshine.  _Next year_ you will find the grass growing tall and green
3261,CHAPTER V,where the stone lay; the ground-bird builds her nest where the beetle had
3262,CHAPTER V,"his hole; the dandelion and the buttercup are growing there, and the"
3263,CHAPTER V,"broad fans of insect-angels open and shut over their golden disks, as the"
3264,CHAPTER V,rhythmic waves of blissful consciousness pulsate through their glorified
3265,CHAPTER V,being.
3266,CHAPTER V,
3267,CHAPTER V,"--The young fellow whom they call John saw fit to say, in his very"
3268,CHAPTER V,"familiar way,--at which I do not choose to take offence, but which I"
3269,CHAPTER V,"sometimes think it necessary to repress,--that I was coming it rather"
3270,CHAPTER V,strong on the butterflies.
3271,CHAPTER V,
3272,CHAPTER V,"No, I replied; there is meaning in each of those images,--the butterfly"
3273,CHAPTER V,as well as the others.  The stone is ancient error.  The grass is human
3274,CHAPTER V,nature borne down and bleached of all its colour by it.  The shapes which
3275,CHAPTER V,"are found beneath are the crafty beings that thrive in darkness, and the"
3276,CHAPTER V,weaker organisms kept helpless by it.  He who turns the stone over is
3277,CHAPTER V,"whosoever puts the staff of truth to the old lying incubus, no matter"
3278,CHAPTER V,whether he do it with a serious face or a laughing one.  The next year
3279,CHAPTER V,stands for the coming time.  Then shall the nature which had lain
3280,CHAPTER V,blanched and broken rise in its full stature and native hues in the
3281,CHAPTER V,sunshine.  Then shall God's minstrels build their nests in the hearts of
3282,CHAPTER V,a new-born humanity.  Then shall beauty--Divinity taking outlines and
3283,CHAPTER V,"color--light upon the souls of men as the butterfly, image of the"
3284,CHAPTER V,"beatified spirit rising from the dust, soars from the shell that held a"
3285,CHAPTER V,"poor grub, which would never have found wings, had not the stone been"
3286,CHAPTER V,lifted.
3287,CHAPTER V,
3288,CHAPTER V,You never need think you can turn over any old falsehood without a
3289,CHAPTER V,terrible squirming and scattering of the horrid little population that
3290,CHAPTER V,dwells under it.
3291,CHAPTER V,
3292,CHAPTER V,--Every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of
3293,CHAPTER V,"somebody or other.  As soon as his breath comes back, he very probably"
3294,CHAPTER V,begins to expend it in hard words.  These are the best evidence a man can
3295,CHAPTER V,have that he has said something it was time to say.  Dr. Johnson was
3296,CHAPTER V,"disappointed in the effect of one of his pamphlets.  ""I think I have not"
3297,CHAPTER V,"been attacked enough for it,"" he said;--""attack is the reaction; I never"
3298,CHAPTER V,"think I have hit hard unless it rebounds."""
3299,CHAPTER V,
3300,CHAPTER V,--If a fellow attacked my opinions in print would I reply?  Not I.  Do
3301,CHAPTER V,"you think I don't understand what my friend, the Professor, long ago"
3302,CHAPTER V,called _the hydrostatic paradox of controversy_?
3303,CHAPTER V,
3304,CHAPTER V,"Don't know what that means?--Well, I will tell you.  You know, that, if"
3305,CHAPTER V,"you had a bent tube, one arm of which was of the size of a pipe-stem, and"
3306,CHAPTER V,"the other big enough to hold the ocean, water would stand at the same"
3307,CHAPTER V,height in one as in the other.  Controversy equalizes fools and wise men
3308,CHAPTER V,"in the same way,--_and the fools know it_."
3309,CHAPTER V,
3310,CHAPTER V,"--No, but I often read what they say about other people.  There are about"
3311,CHAPTER V,"a dozen phrases which all come tumbling along together, like the tongs,"
3312,CHAPTER V,"and the shovel, and the poker, and the brush, and the bellows, in one of"
3313,CHAPTER V,"those domestic avalanches that everybody knows.  If you get one, you get"
3314,CHAPTER V,the whole lot.
3315,CHAPTER V,
3316,CHAPTER V,"What are they?--Oh, that depends a good deal on latitude and longitude."
3317,CHAPTER V,Epithets follow the isothermal lines pretty accurately.  Grouping them in
3318,CHAPTER V,"two families, one finds himself a clever, genial, witty, wise, brilliant,"
3319,CHAPTER V,"sparkling, thoughtful, distinguished, celebrated, illustrious scholar and"
3320,CHAPTER V,"perfect gentleman, and first writer of the age; or a dull, foolish,"
3321,CHAPTER V,"wicked, pert, shallow, ignorant, insolent, traitorous, black-hearted"
3322,CHAPTER V,"outcast, and disgrace to civilization."
3323,CHAPTER V,
3324,CHAPTER V,"What do I think determines the set of phrases a man gets?--Well, I should"
3325,CHAPTER V,"say a set of influences something like these:--1st.  Relationships,"
3326,CHAPTER V,"political, religious, social, domestic.  2d.  Oyster, in the form of"
3327,CHAPTER V,suppers given to gentlemen connected with criticism.  I believe in the
3328,CHAPTER V,"school, the college, and the clergy; but my sovereign logic, for"
3329,CHAPTER V,regulating public opinion--which means commonly the opinion of half a
3330,CHAPTER V,dozen of the critical gentry--is the following _Major proposition_.
3331,CHAPTER V,"Oysters _au naturel_.  _Minor proposition_.  The same ""scalloped."""
3332,CHAPTER V,"_Conclusion_.  That--(here insert entertainer's name) is clever, witty,"
3333,CHAPTER V,"wise, brilliant,--and the rest."
3334,CHAPTER V,
3335,CHAPTER V,"--No, it isn't exactly bribery.  One man has oysters, and another"
3336,CHAPTER V,"epithets.  It is an exchange of hospitalities; one gives a ""spread"" on"
3337,CHAPTER V,"linen, and the other on paper,--that is all.  Don't you think you and I"
3338,CHAPTER V,"should be apt to do just so, if we were in the critical line?  I am sure"
3339,CHAPTER V,I couldn't resist the softening influences of hospitality.  I don't like
3340,CHAPTER V,"to dine out, you know,--I dine so well at our own table, [our landlady"
3341,CHAPTER V,"looked radiant,] and the company is so pleasant [a rustling movement of"
3342,CHAPTER V,"satisfaction among the boarders]; but if I did partake of a man's salt,"
3343,CHAPTER V,with such additions as that article of food requires to make it
3344,CHAPTER V,"palatable, I could never abuse him, and if I had to speak of him, I"
3345,CHAPTER V,suppose I should hang my set of jingling epithets round him like a string
3346,CHAPTER V,of sleigh-bells.  Good feeling helps society to make liars of most of
3347,CHAPTER V,"us,--not absolute liars, but such careless handlers of truth that its"
3348,CHAPTER V,sharp corners get terribly rounded.  I love truth as chiefest among the
3349,CHAPTER V,"virtues; I trust it runs in my blood; but I would never be a critic,"
3350,CHAPTER V,because I know I could not always tell it.  I might write a criticism of
3351,CHAPTER V,a book that happened to please me; that is another matter.
3352,CHAPTER V,
3353,CHAPTER V,"--Listen, Benjamin Franklin!  This is for you, and such others of tender"
3354,CHAPTER V,age as you may tell it to.
3355,CHAPTER V,
3356,CHAPTER V,"When we are as yet small children, long before the time when those two"
3357,CHAPTER V,"grown ladies offer us the choice of Hercules, there comes up to us a"
3358,CHAPTER V,"youthful angel, holding in his right hand cubes like dice, and in his"
3359,CHAPTER V,"left spheres like marbles.  The cubes are of stainless ivory, and on each"
3360,CHAPTER V,is written in letters of gold--TRUTH.  The spheres are veined and
3361,CHAPTER V,"streaked and spotted beneath, with a dark crimson flush above, where the"
3362,CHAPTER V,"light falls on them, and in a certain aspect you can make out upon every"
3363,CHAPTER V,"one of them the three letters L, I, E.  The child to whom they are"
3364,CHAPTER V,offered very probably clutches at both.  The spheres are the most
3365,CHAPTER V,convenient things in the world; they roll with the least possible impulse
3366,CHAPTER V,just where the child would have them.  The cubes will not roll at all;
3367,CHAPTER V,"they have a great talent for standing still, and always keep right side"
3368,CHAPTER V,up.  But very soon the young philosopher finds that things which roll so
3369,CHAPTER V,"easily are very apt to roll into the wrong corner, and to get out of his"
3370,CHAPTER V,"way when he most wants them, while he always knows where to find the"
3371,CHAPTER V,"others, which stay where they are left.  Thus he learns--thus we"
3372,CHAPTER V,learn--to drop the streaked and speckled globes of falsehood and to hold
3373,CHAPTER V,"fast the white angular blocks of truth.  But then comes Timidity, and"
3374,CHAPTER V,"after her Good-nature, and last of all Polite-behavior, all insisting"
3375,CHAPTER V,"that truth must _roll_, or nobody can do anything with it; and so the"
3376,CHAPTER V,"first with her coarse rasp, and the second with her broad file, and the"
3377,CHAPTER V,"third with her silken sleeve, do so round off and smooth and polish the"
3378,CHAPTER V,"snow-white cubes of truth, that, when they have got a little dingy by"
3379,CHAPTER V,"use, it becomes hard to tell them from the rolling spheres of falsehood."
3380,CHAPTER V,
3381,CHAPTER V,The schoolmistress was polite enough to say that she was pleased with
3382,CHAPTER V,"this, and that she would read it to her little flock the next day.  But"
3383,CHAPTER V,"she should tell the children, she said, that there were better reasons"
3384,CHAPTER V,for truth than could be found in mere experience of its convenience and
3385,CHAPTER V,the inconvenience of lying.
3386,CHAPTER V,
3387,CHAPTER V,"Yes,--I said,--but education always begins through the senses, and works"
3388,CHAPTER V,up to the idea of absolute right and wrong.  The first thing the child
3389,CHAPTER V,"has to learn about this matter is, that lying is"
3390,CHAPTER V,"unprofitable,--afterwards, that it is against the peace and dignity of"
3391,CHAPTER V,the universe.
3392,CHAPTER V,
3393,CHAPTER V,"--Do I think that the particular form of lying often seen in newspapers,"
3394,CHAPTER V,"under the title, ""From our Foreign Correspondent,"" does any harm?--Why,"
3395,CHAPTER V,"no,--I don't know that it does.  I suppose it doesn't really deceive"
3396,CHAPTER V,"people any more than the ""Arabian Nights"" or ""Gulliver's Travels"" do."
3397,CHAPTER V,"Sometimes the writers compile _too_ carelessly, though, and mix up facts"
3398,CHAPTER V,"out of geographies, and stories out of the penny papers, so as to mislead"
3399,CHAPTER V,those who are desirous of information.  I cut a piece out of one of the

3616,CHAPTER VI,of the sayings of the Seven Wise Men of Boston you were speaking of the
3617,CHAPTER VI,other day.
3618,CHAPTER VI,
3619,CHAPTER VI,"I thank you, my young friend,--was my reply,--but I must say something"
3620,CHAPTER VI,"better than that, before I could pretend to fill out the number."
3621,CHAPTER VI,
3622,CHAPTER VI,--The schoolmistress wanted to know how many of these sayings there were
3623,CHAPTER VI,"on record, and what, and by whom said."
3624,CHAPTER VI,
3625,CHAPTER VI,"--Why, let us see,--there is that one of Benjamin Franklin, ""the great"
3626,CHAPTER VI,"Bostonian,"" after whom this lad was named.  To be sure, he said a great"
3627,CHAPTER VI,"many wise things,--and I don't feel sure he didn't borrow this,--he"
3628,CHAPTER VI,speaks as if it were old.  But then he applied it so neatly!--

3650,CHAPTER VI,"A jaunty-looking person, who had come in with the young fellow they call"

3653,CHAPTER VI,it.--A civil curiosity was manifested by the company to hear the fourth
3654,CHAPTER VI,wise saying.  I heard him distinctly whispering to the young fellow who
3655,CHAPTER VI,"brought him to dinner, _Shall I tell it_?  To which the answer was, _Go"
3656,CHAPTER VI,"ahead_!--Well,--he said,--this was what I heard:--"

3661,CHAPTER VI,
3662,CHAPTER VI,"Sir,--said I,--I am gratified with your remark.  It expresses with"
3663,CHAPTER VI,pleasing vivacity that which I have sometimes heard uttered with
3664,CHAPTER VI,malignant dulness.  The satire of the remark is essentially true of
3665,CHAPTER VI,"Boston,--and of all other considerable--and inconsiderable--places with"
3666,CHAPTER VI,which I have had the privilege of being acquainted.  Cockneys think
3667,CHAPTER VI,London is the only place in the world.  Frenchmen--you remember the line
3668,CHAPTER VI,"about Paris, the Court, the World, etc.--I recollect well, by the way, a"
3669,CHAPTER VI,"sign in that city which ran thus: ""Hotel l'Univers et des Etats Unis"";"
3670,CHAPTER VI,"and as Paris _is_ the universe to a Frenchman, of course the United"
3671,CHAPTER VI,"States are outside of it.--""See Naples and then die.""--It is quite as bad"
3672,CHAPTER VI,"with smaller places.  I have been about, lecturing, you know, and have"
3673,CHAPTER VI,found the following propositions to hold true of all of them.
3674,CHAPTER VI,
3675,CHAPTER VI,1.  The axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of each
3676,CHAPTER VI,and every town or city.

3679,CHAPTER VI,"affectionately styled by the inhabitants the ""_good old_ town"
3680,CHAPTER VI,"of""--(whatever its name may happen to be.)"
3681,CHAPTER VI,
3682,CHAPTER VI,3.  Every collection of its inhabitants that comes together to listen to
3683,CHAPTER VI,"a stranger is invariably declared to be a ""remarkably intelligent"
3684,CHAPTER VI,"audience."""
3685,CHAPTER VI,
3686,CHAPTER VI,4.  The climate of the place is particularly favorable to longevity.
3687,CHAPTER VI,
3688,CHAPTER VI,5.  It contains several persons of vast talent little known to the world.
3689,CHAPTER VI,"(One or two of them, you may perhaps chance to remember, sent short"
3690,CHAPTER VI,"pieces to the ""Pactolian"" some time since, which were ""respectfully"
3691,CHAPTER VI,"declined."")"
3692,CHAPTER VI,
3693,CHAPTER VI,"Boston is just like other places of its size;--only perhaps, considering"
3694,CHAPTER VI,"its excellent fish-market, paid fire-department, superior monthly"
3695,CHAPTER VI,"publications, and correct habit of spelling the English language, it has"
3696,CHAPTER VI,"some right to look down on the mob of cities.  I'll tell you, though, if"
3697,CHAPTER VI,"you want to know it, what is the real offence of Boston.  It drains a"
3698,CHAPTER VI,"large water-shed of its intellect, and will not itself be drained.  If it"
3699,CHAPTER VI,"would only send away its first-rate men, instead of its second-rate ones,"
3700,CHAPTER VI,"(no offence to the well-known exceptions, of which we are always proud,)"
3701,CHAPTER VI,we should be spared such epigrammatic remarks as that which the gentleman
3702,CHAPTER VI,"has quoted.  There can never be a real metropolis in this country, until"
3703,CHAPTER VI,the biggest centre can drain the lesser ones of their talent and
3704,CHAPTER VI,"wealth.--I have observed, by the way, that the people who really live in"
3705,CHAPTER VI,"two great cities are by no means so jealous of each other, as are those"
3706,CHAPTER VI,"of smaller cities situated within the intellectual basin, or"
3707,CHAPTER VI,"_suction-range_, of one large one, of the pretensions of any other."
3708,CHAPTER VI,Don't you see why?  Because their promising young author and rising
3709,CHAPTER VI,lawyer and large capitalist have been drained off to the neighboring big
3710,CHAPTER VI,"city,--their prettiest girl has been exported to the same market; all"
3711,CHAPTER VI,"their ambition points there, and all their thin gilding of glory comes"
3712,CHAPTER VI,from there.  I hate little toad-eating cities.
3713,CHAPTER VI,
3714,CHAPTER VI,"--Would I be so good as to specify any particular example?--Oh,--an"
3715,CHAPTER VI,"example?  Did you ever see a bear-trap?  Never?  Well, shouldn't you like"
3716,CHAPTER VI,to see me put my foot into one?  With sentiments of the highest
3717,CHAPTER VI,consideration I must beg leave to be excused.
3718,CHAPTER VI,
3719,CHAPTER VI,"Besides, some of the smaller cities are charming.  If they have an old"
3720,CHAPTER VI,"church or two, a few stately mansions of former grandees, here and there"
3721,CHAPTER VI,"an old dwelling with the second story projecting, (for the convenience of"
3722,CHAPTER VI,shooting the Indians knocking at the front-door with their
3723,CHAPTER VI,"tomahawks,)--if they have, scattered about, those mighty square houses"
3724,CHAPTER VI,"built something more than half a century ago, and standing like"
3725,CHAPTER VI,"architectural boulders dropped by the former diluvium of wealth, whose"
3726,CHAPTER VI,"refluent wave has left them as its monument,--if they have gardens with"
3727,CHAPTER VI,elbowed apple-trees that push their branches over the high board-fence
3728,CHAPTER VI,"and drop their fruit on the side-walk,--if they have a little grass in"
3729,CHAPTER VI,"the side-streets, enough to betoken quiet without proclaiming decay,--I"
3730,CHAPTER VI,"think I could go to pieces, after my life's work were done, in one of"
3731,CHAPTER VI,"those tranquil places, as sweetly as in any cradle that an old man may be"
3732,CHAPTER VI,rocked to sleep in.  I visit such spots always with infinite delight.  My
3733,CHAPTER VI,"friend, the Poet, says, that rapidly growing towns are most unfavorable"
3734,CHAPTER VI,to the imaginative and reflective faculties.  Let a man live in one of
3735,CHAPTER VI,"these old quiet places, he says, and the wine of his soul, which is kept"
3736,CHAPTER VI,"thick and turbid by the rattle of busy streets, settles, and, as you hold"
3737,CHAPTER VI,"it up, you may see the sun through it by day and the stars by night."
3738,CHAPTER VI,
3739,CHAPTER VI,--Do I think that the little villages have the conceit of the great
3740,CHAPTER VI,towns?--I don't believe there is much difference.  You know how they read
3741,CHAPTER VI,"Pope's line in the smallest town in our State of Massachusetts?--Well,"
3742,CHAPTER VI,they read it
3743,CHAPTER VI,
3744,CHAPTER VI,"""All are but parts of one stupendous HULL!"""
3745,CHAPTER VI,
3746,CHAPTER VI,--Every person's feelings have a front-door and a side-door by which they
3747,CHAPTER VI,may be entered.  The front-door is on the street.  Some keep it always
3748,CHAPTER VI,"open; some keep it latched; some, locked; some, bolted,--with a chain"
3749,CHAPTER VI,"that will let you peep in, but not get in; and some nail it up, so that"
3750,CHAPTER VI,nothing can pass its threshold.  This front-door leads into a passage
3751,CHAPTER VI,"which opens into an ante-room, and this into the inferior apartments."
3752,CHAPTER VI,The side-door opens at once into the sacred chambers.
3753,CHAPTER VI,
3754,CHAPTER VI,There is almost always at least one key to this side-door.  This is
3755,CHAPTER VI,"carried for years hidden in a mother's bosom.  Fathers, brothers,"
3756,CHAPTER VI,"sisters, and friends, often, but by no means so universally, have"
3757,CHAPTER VI,"duplicates of it.  The wedding-ring conveys a right to one; alas, if none"
3758,CHAPTER VI,is given with it!
3759,CHAPTER VI,
3760,CHAPTER VI,If nature or accident has put one of these keys into the hands of a
3761,CHAPTER VI,"person who has the torturing instinct, I can only solemnly pronounce the"
3762,CHAPTER VI,"words that Justice utters over its doomed victim,--_The Lord have mercy"
3763,CHAPTER VI,"on your soul_!  You will probably go mad within a reasonable time,--or,"
3764,CHAPTER VI,"if you are a man, run off and die with your head on a curb-stone, in"
3765,CHAPTER VI,"Melbourne or San Francisco,--or, if you are a woman, quarrel and break"
3766,CHAPTER VI,"your heart, or turn into a pale, jointed petrifaction that moves about as"
3767,CHAPTER VI,"if it were alive, or play some real life-tragedy or other."
3768,CHAPTER VI,
3769,CHAPTER VI,Be very careful to whom you trust one of these keys of the side-door.
3770,CHAPTER VI,The fact of possessing one renders those even who are dear to you very
3771,CHAPTER VI,"terrible at times.  You can keep the world out from your front-door, or"
3772,CHAPTER VI,receive visitors only when you are ready for them; but those of your own
3773,CHAPTER VI,"flesh and blood, or of certain grades of intimacy, can come in at the"
3774,CHAPTER VI,"side-door, if they will, at any hour and in any mood.  Some of them have"
3775,CHAPTER VI,"a scale of your whole nervous system, and can play all the gamut of your"
3776,CHAPTER VI,"sensibilities in semitones,--touching the naked nerve-pulps as a pianist"
3777,CHAPTER VI,strikes the keys of his instrument.  I am satisfied that there are as
3778,CHAPTER VI,great masters of this nerve-playing as Vieuxtemps or Thalberg in their
3779,CHAPTER VI,lines of performance.  Married life is the school in which the most
3780,CHAPTER VI,accomplished artists in this department are found.  A delicate woman is
3781,CHAPTER VI,the best instrument; she has such a magnificent compass of sensibilities!
3782,CHAPTER VI,From the deep inward moan which follows pressure on the great nerves of
3783,CHAPTER VI,"right, to the sharp cry as the filaments of taste are struck with a"
3784,CHAPTER VI,"crashing sweep, is a range which no other instrument possesses.  A few"
3785,CHAPTER VI,exercises on it daily at home fit a man wonderfully for his habitual
3786,CHAPTER VI,"labors, and refresh him immensely as he returns from them.  No stranger"
3787,CHAPTER VI,can get a great many notes of torture out of a human soul; it takes one
3788,CHAPTER VI,"that knows it well,--parent, child, brother, sister, intimate.  Be very"
3789,CHAPTER VI,careful to whom you give a side-door key; too many have them already.
3790,CHAPTER VI,
3791,CHAPTER VI,"--You remember the old story of the tender-hearted man, who placed a"
3792,CHAPTER VI,"frozen viper in his bosom, and was stung by it when it became thawed?  If"
3793,CHAPTER VI,"we take a cold-blooded creature into our bosom, better that it should"
3794,CHAPTER VI,sting us and we should die than that its chill should slowly steal into
3795,CHAPTER VI,our hearts; warm it we never can!  I have seen faces of women that were
3796,CHAPTER VI,"fair to look upon, yet one could see that the icicles were forming round"
3797,CHAPTER VI,these women's hearts.  I knew what freezing image lay on the white
3798,CHAPTER VI,breasts beneath the laces!
3799,CHAPTER VI,
3800,CHAPTER VI,A very simple _intellectual_ mechanism answers the necessities of
3801,CHAPTER VI,"friendship, and even of the most intimate relations of life.  If a watch"
3802,CHAPTER VI,"tells us the hour and the minute, we can be content to carry it about"
3803,CHAPTER VI,"with us for a life-time, though it has no second-hand and is not a"
3804,CHAPTER VI,"repeater, nor a musical watch,--though it is not enamelled nor"
3805,CHAPTER VI,"jewelled,--in short, though it has little beyond the wheels required for"
3806,CHAPTER VI,"a trustworthy instrument, added to a good face and a pair of useful"
3807,CHAPTER VI,"hands.  The more wheels there are in a watch or a brain, the more trouble"
3808,CHAPTER VI,they are to take care of.  The movements of exaltation which belong to
3809,CHAPTER VI,"genius are egotistic by their very nature.  A calm, clear mind, not"
3810,CHAPTER VI,subject to the spasms and crises which are so often met with in creative
3811,CHAPTER VI,"or intensely perceptive natures, is the best basis for love or"
3812,CHAPTER VI,"friendship.--Observe, I am talking about _minds_.  I won't say, the more"
3813,CHAPTER VI,"intellect, the less capacity for loving; for that would do wrong to the"
3814,CHAPTER VI,"understanding and reason;--but, on the other hand, that the brain often"
3815,CHAPTER VI,"runs away with the heart's best blood, which gives the world a few pages"
3816,CHAPTER VI,"of wisdom or sentiment or poetry, instead of making one other heart"
3817,CHAPTER VI,"happy, I have no question."
3818,CHAPTER VI,
3819,CHAPTER VI,If one's intimate in love or friendship cannot or does not share all
3820,CHAPTER VI,"one's intellectual tastes or pursuits, that is a small matter."
3821,CHAPTER VI,"Intellectual companions can be found easily in men and books.  After all,"
3822,CHAPTER VI,"if we think of it, most of the world's loves and friendships have been"
3823,CHAPTER VI,between people that could not read nor spell.
3824,CHAPTER VI,
3825,CHAPTER VI,But to radiate the heat of the affections into a clod which absorbs all
3826,CHAPTER VI,"that is poured into it, but never warms beneath the sunshine of smiles or"
3827,CHAPTER VI,"the pressure of hand or lip,--this is the great martyrdom of sensitive"
3828,CHAPTER VI,"beings,--most of all in that perpetual _auto da fe_ where young womanhood"
3829,CHAPTER VI,is the sacrifice.
3830,CHAPTER VI,
3831,CHAPTER VI,"--You noticed, perhaps, what I just said about the loves and friendships"
3832,CHAPTER VI,"of illiterate persons,--that is, of the human race, with a few exceptions"
3833,CHAPTER VI,"here and there.  I like books,--I was born and bred among them, and have"
3834,CHAPTER VI,"the easy feeling, when I get into their presence, that a stable-boy has"
3835,CHAPTER VI,among horses.  I don't think I undervalue them either as companions or as
3836,CHAPTER VI,instructors.  But I can't help remembering that the world's great men
3837,CHAPTER VI,"have not commonly been great scholars, nor its great scholars great men."
3838,CHAPTER VI,"The Hebrew patriarchs had small libraries, I think, if any; yet they"
3839,CHAPTER VI,"represent to our imaginations a very complete idea of manhood, and, I"
3840,CHAPTER VI,"think, if we could ask in Abraham to dine with us men of letters next"
3841,CHAPTER VI,"Saturday, we should feel honored by his company."
3842,CHAPTER VI,
3843,CHAPTER VI,What I wanted to say about books is this: that there are times in which
3844,CHAPTER VI,every active mind feels itself above any and all human books.
3845,CHAPTER VI,
3846,CHAPTER VI,"--I think a man must have a good opinion of himself, Sir,--said the"
3847,CHAPTER VI,"divinity-student,--who should feel himself above Shakspeare at any time."
3848,CHAPTER VI,
3849,CHAPTER VI,"My young friend,--I replied,--the man who is never conscious of a state"
3850,CHAPTER VI,of feeling or of intellectual effort entirely beyond expression by any
3851,CHAPTER VI,form of words whatsoever is a mere creature of language.  I can hardly
3852,CHAPTER VI,"believe there are any such men.  Why, think for a moment of the power of"
3853,CHAPTER VI,music.  The nerves that make us alive to it spread out (so the Professor
3854,CHAPTER VI,tells me) in the most sensitive region of the marrow just where it is
3855,CHAPTER VI,widening to run upwards into the hemispheres.  It has its seat in the
3856,CHAPTER VI,region of sense rather than of thought.  Yet it produces a continuous
3857,CHAPTER VI,"and, as it were, logical sequence of emotional and intellectual changes;"
3858,CHAPTER VI,but how different from trains of thought proper! how entirely beyond the
3859,CHAPTER VI,reach of symbols!--Think of human passions as compared with all phrases!
3860,CHAPTER VI,"Did you ever hear of a man's growing lean by the reading of ""Romeo and"
3861,CHAPTER VI,"Juliet,"" or blowing his brains out because Desdemona was maligned?  There"
3862,CHAPTER VI,"are a good many symbols, even, that are more expressive than words.  I"
3863,CHAPTER VI,remember a young wife who had to part with her husband for a time.  She
3864,CHAPTER VI,"did not write a mournful poem; indeed, she was a silent person, and"
3865,CHAPTER VI,perhaps hardly said a word about it; but she quietly turned of a deep
3866,CHAPTER VI,orange color with jaundice.  A great many people in this world have but
3867,CHAPTER VI,"one form of rhetoric for their profoundest experiences,--namely, to waste"
3868,CHAPTER VI,"away and die.  When a man can _read_, his paroxysm of feeling is passing."
3869,CHAPTER VI,"When he can _read_, his thought has slackened its hold.--You talk about"
3870,CHAPTER VI,"reading Shakspeare, using him as an expression for the highest intellect,"
3871,CHAPTER VI,and you wonder that any common person should be so presumptuous as to
3872,CHAPTER VI,suppose his thought can rise above the text which lies before him.  But
3873,CHAPTER VI,"think a moment.  A child's reading of Shakspeare is one thing, and"
3874,CHAPTER VI,Coleridge's or Schlegel's reading of him is another.  The
3875,CHAPTER VI,saturation-point of each mind differs from that of every other.  But I
3876,CHAPTER VI,think it is as true for the small mind which can only take up a little as
3877,CHAPTER VI,"for the great one which takes up much, that the suggested trains of"
3878,CHAPTER VI,"thought and feeling ought always to rise above--not the author, but the"
3879,CHAPTER VI,"reader's mental version of the author, whoever he may be."
3880,CHAPTER VI,
3881,CHAPTER VI,I think most readers of Shakspeare sometimes find themselves thrown into
3882,CHAPTER VI,exalted mental conditions like those produced by music.  Then they may
3883,CHAPTER VI,"drop the book, to pass at once into the region of thought without words."
3884,CHAPTER VI,"We may happen to be very dull folks, you and I, and probably are, unless"
3885,CHAPTER VI,there is some particular reason to suppose the contrary.  But we get
3886,CHAPTER VI,"glimpses now and then of a sphere of spiritual possibilities, where we,"
3887,CHAPTER VI,"dull as we are now, may sail in vast circles round the largest compass of"
3888,CHAPTER VI,earthly intelligences.
3889,CHAPTER VI,
3890,CHAPTER VI,--I confess there are times when I feel like the friend I mentioned to
3891,CHAPTER VI,"you some time ago,--I hate the very sight of a book.  Sometimes it"
3892,CHAPTER VI,"becomes almost a physical necessity to talk out what is in the mind,"
3893,CHAPTER VI,before putting anything else into it.  It is very bad to have thoughts
3894,CHAPTER VI,"and feelings, which were meant to come out in talk, _strike in_, as they"
3895,CHAPTER VI,say of some complaints that ought to show outwardly.
3896,CHAPTER VI,
3897,CHAPTER VI,I always believed in life rather than in books.  I suppose every day of
3898,CHAPTER VI,"earth, with its hundred thousand deaths and something more of"
3899,CHAPTER VI,"births,--with its loves and hates, its triumphs and defeats, its pangs"
3900,CHAPTER VI,"and blisses, has more of humanity in it than all the books that were ever"
3901,CHAPTER VI,"written, put together.  I believe the flowers growing at this moment send"
3902,CHAPTER VI,up more fragrance to heaven than was ever exhaled from all the essences
3903,CHAPTER VI,ever distilled.
3904,CHAPTER VI,
3905,CHAPTER VI,--Don't I read up various matters to talk about at this table or
3906,CHAPTER VI,"elsewhere?--No, that is the last thing I would do.  I will tell you my"
3907,CHAPTER VI,"rule.  Talk about those subjects you have had long in your mind, and"
3908,CHAPTER VI,listen to what others say about subjects you have studied but recently.
3909,CHAPTER VI,"Knowledge and timber shouldn't be much used, till they are seasoned."
3910,CHAPTER VI,
3911,CHAPTER VI,--Physiologists and metaphysicians have had their attention turned a good
3912,CHAPTER VI,deal of late to the automatic and involuntary actions of the mind.  Put
3913,CHAPTER VI,"an idea into your intelligence and leave it there an hour, a day, a year,"
3914,CHAPTER VI,"without ever having occasion to refer to it.  When, at last, you return"
3915,CHAPTER VI,"to it, you do not find it as it was when acquired.  It has domiciliated"
3916,CHAPTER VI,"itself, so to speak,--become at home,--entered into relations with your"
3917,CHAPTER VI,"other thoughts, and integrated itself with the whole fabric of the"
3918,CHAPTER VI,mind.--Or take a simple and familiar example; Dr. Carpenter has adduced
3919,CHAPTER VI,"it.  You forget a name, in conversation,--go on talking, without making"
3920,CHAPTER VI,"any effort to recall it,--and presently the mind evolves it by its own"
3921,CHAPTER VI,"involuntary and unconscious action, while you were pursuing another train"
3922,CHAPTER VI,"of thought, and the name rises of itself to your lips."

3925,CHAPTER VI,
3926,CHAPTER VI,There are some curious observations I should like to make about the
3927,CHAPTER VI,"mental machinery, but I think we are getting rather didactic."
3928,CHAPTER VI,
3929,CHAPTER VI,"--I should be gratified, if Benjamin Franklin would let me know something"
3930,CHAPTER VI,of his progress in the French language.  I rather liked that exercise he
3931,CHAPTER VI,"read us the other day, though I must confess I should hardly dare to"
3932,CHAPTER VI,"translate it, for fear some people in a remote city where I once lived"
3933,CHAPTER VI,might think I was drawing their portraits.
3934,CHAPTER VI,
3935,CHAPTER VI,"--Yes, Paris is a famous place for societies.  I don't know whether the"
3936,CHAPTER VI,piece I mentioned from the French author was intended simply as Natural
3937,CHAPTER VI,"History, or whether there was not a little malice in his description.  At"
3938,CHAPTER VI,"any rate, when I gave my translation to B. F. to turn back again into"
3939,CHAPTER VI,"French, one reason was that I thought it would sound a little bald in"
3940,CHAPTER VI,"English, and some people might think it was meant to have some local"
3941,CHAPTER VI,"bearing or other,--which the author, of course, didn't mean, inasmuch as"
3942,CHAPTER VI,he could not be acquainted with anything on this side of the water.

3944,CHAPTER VI,"[The above remarks were addressed to the school-mistress, to whom I"
3945,CHAPTER VI,handed the paper after looking it over.  The divinity-student came and
3946,CHAPTER VI,"read over her shoulder,--very curious, apparently, but his eyes wandered,"
3947,CHAPTER VI,"I thought.  Fancying that her breathing was somewhat hurried and high, or"
3948,CHAPTER VI,"_thoracic_, as my friend, the Professor, calls it, I watched her a little"
3949,CHAPTER VI,"more closely.--It is none of my business.--After all, it is the"
3950,CHAPTER VI,"imponderables that move the world,--heat, electricity, love.  _Habet_?]"

4052,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4053,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,I'll tell you how I came to know so much about averages.  There was one
4054,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"season when I was lecturing, commonly, five evenings in the week, through"
4055,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"most of the lecturing period.  I soon found, as most speakers do, that it"
4056,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,was pleasanter to work one lecture than to keep several in hand.
4057,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4058,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,--Don't you get sick to death of one lecture?--said the landlady's
4059,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"daughter,--who had a new dress on that day, and was in spirits for"
4060,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,conversation.
4061,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4062,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"I was going to talk about averages,--I said,--but I have no objection to"
4063,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"telling you about lectures, to begin with."
4064,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4065,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,A new lecture always has a certain excitement connected with its
4066,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"delivery.  One thinks well of it, as of most things fresh from his mind."
4067,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"After a few deliveries of it, one gets tired and then disgusted with its"
4068,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"repetition.  Go on delivering it, and the disgust passes off, until,"
4069,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"after one has repeated it a hundred or a hundred and fifty times, he"
4070,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"rather enjoys the hundred and first or hundred and fifty-first time,"
4071,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"before a new audience.  But this is on one condition,--that he never lays"
4072,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the lecture down and lets it cool.  If he does, there comes on a loathing"
4073,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"for it which is intense, so that the sight of the old battered manuscript"
4074,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,is as bad as sea-sickness.
4075,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4076,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,A new lecture is just like any other new tool.  We use it for a while
4077,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"with pleasure.  Then it blisters our hands, and we hate to touch it."
4078,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"By-and-by our hands get callous, and then we have no longer any"
4079,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"sensitiveness about it.  But if we give it up, the calluses disappear;"
4080,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"and if we meddle with it again, we miss the novelty and get the"
4081,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"blisters.--The story is often quoted of Whitefield, that he said a sermon"
4082,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,was good for nothing until it had been preached forty times.  A lecture
4083,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,doesn't begin to be old until it has passed its hundredth delivery; and
4084,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"some, I think, have doubled, if not quadrupled, that number.  These old"
4085,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"lectures are a man's best, commonly; they improve by age, also,--like the"
4086,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"pipes, fiddles, and poems I told you of the other day.  One learns to"
4087,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,make the most of their strong points and to carry off their weak
4088,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"ones,--to take out the really good things which don't tell on the"
4089,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"audience, and put in cheaper things that do.  All this degrades him, of"
4090,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"course, but it improves the lecture for general delivery.  A thoroughly"
4091,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,popular lecture ought to have nothing in it which five hundred people
4092,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"cannot all take in a flash, just as it is uttered."
4093,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4094,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"--No, indeed,--I should be very sorry to say anything disrespectful of"
4095,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"audiences.  I have been kindly treated by a great many, and may"
4096,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,occasionally face one hereafter.  But I tell you the _average_ intellect
4097,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"of five hundred persons, taken as they come, is not very high.  It may be"
4098,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"sound and safe, so far as it goes, but it is not very rapid or profound."
4099,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"A lecture ought to be something which all can understand, about something"
4100,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"which interests everybody.  I think, that, if any experienced lecturer"
4101,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"gives you a different account from this, it will probably be one of those"
4102,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,eloquent or forcible speakers who hold an audience by the charm of their
4103,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"manner, whatever they talk about,--even when they don't talk very well."
4104,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4105,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"But an _average_, which was what I meant to speak about, is one of the"
4106,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,most extraordinary subjects of observation and study.  It is awful in its
4107,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"uniformity, in its automatic necessity of action.  Two communities of"
4108,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"ants or bees are exactly alike in all their actions, so far as we can"
4109,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"see.  Two lyceum assemblies, of five hundred each, are so nearly alike,"
4110,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,that they are absolutely undistinguishable in many cases by any definite
4111,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"mark, and there is nothing but the place and time by which one can tell"
4112,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the ""remarkably intelligent audience"" of a town in New York or Ohio from"
4113,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"one in any New England town of similar size.  Of course, if any principle"
4114,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"of selection has come in, as in those special associations of young men"
4115,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"which are common in cities, it deranges the uniformity of the assemblage."
4116,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"But let there be no such interfering circumstances, and one knows pretty"
4117,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"well even the look the audience will have, before he goes in.  Front"
4118,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"seats: a few old folk,--shiny-headed,--slant up best ear towards the"
4119,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"speaker,--drop off asleep after a while, when the air begins to get a"
4120,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"little narcotic with carbonic acid.  Bright women's faces, young and"
4121,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"middle-aged, a little behind these, but toward the front--(pick out the"
4122,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"best, and lecture mainly to that.)  Here and there a countenance, sharp"
4123,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"and scholarlike, and a dozen pretty female ones sprinkled about.  An"
4124,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"indefinite number of pairs of young people,--happy, but not always very"
4125,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"attentive.  Boys, in the background, more or less quiet.  Dull faces"
4126,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"here, there,--in how many places!  I don't say dull _people_, but faces"
4127,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,without a ray of sympathy or a movement of expression.  They are what
4128,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,kill the lecturer.  These negative faces with their vacuous eyes and
4129,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,stony lineaments pump and suck the warm soul out of him;--that is the
4130,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,chief reason why lecturers grow so pale before the season is over.  They
4131,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,render _latent_ any amount of vital caloric; they act on our minds as
4132,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,those cold-blooded creatures I was talking about act on our hearts.
4133,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4134,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Out of all these inevitable elements the audience is generated,--a great"
4135,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"compound vertebrate, as much like fifty others you have seen as any two"
4136,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"mammals of the same species are like each other.  Each audience laughs,"
4137,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"and each cries, in just the same places of your lecture; that is, if you"
4138,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"make one laugh or cry, you make all.  Even those little indescribable"
4139,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"movements which a lecturer takes cognizance of, just as a driver notices"
4140,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"his horse's cocking his ears, are sure to come in exactly the same place"
4141,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"of your lecture always.  I declare to you, that as the monk said about"
4142,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the picture in the convent,--that he sometimes thought the living tenants"
4143,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"were the shadows, and the painted figures the realities,--I have"
4144,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"sometimes felt as if I were a wandering spirit, and this great unchanging"
4145,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,multivertebrate which I faced night after night was one ever-listening
4146,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"animal, which writhed along after me wherever I fled, and coiled at my"
4147,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"feet every evening, turning up to me the same sleepless eyes which I"
4148,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,thought I had closed with my last drowsy incantation!
4149,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4150,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"--Oh, yes!  A thousand kindly and courteous acts,--a thousand faces that"
4151,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"melted individually out of my recollection as the April snow melts, but"
4152,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"only to steal away and find the beds of flowers whose roots are memory,"
4153,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"but which blossom in poetry and dreams.  I am not ungrateful, nor"
4154,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,unconscious of all the good feeling and intelligence everywhere to be met
4155,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,with through the vast parish to which the lecturer ministers.  But when I
4156,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"set forth, leading a string of my mind's daughters to market, as the"
4157,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"country-folk fetch in their strings of horses--Pardon me, that was a"
4158,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"coarse fellow who sneered at the sympathy wasted on an unhappy lecturer,"
4159,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"as if, because he was decently paid for his services, he had therefore"
4160,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,sold his sensibilities.--Family men get dreadfully homesick.  In the
4161,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,remote and bleak village the heart returns to the red blaze of the logs
4162,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,in one's fireplace at home.
4163,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,

4167,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"a man, but only one nest."
4168,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4169,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,--It is a fine thing to be an oracle to which an appeal is always made in
4170,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"all discussions.  The men of facts wait their turn in grim silence, with"
4171,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,that slight tension about the nostrils which the consciousness of
4172,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"carrying a ""settler"" in the form of a fact or a revolver gives the"
4173,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"individual thus armed.  When a person is really full of information, and"
4174,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"does not abuse it to crush conversation, his part is to that of the real"
4175,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,talkers what the instrumental accompaniment is in a trio or quartette of
4176,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,vocalists.
4177,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4178,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"--What do I mean by the real talkers?--Why, the people with fresh ideas,"
4179,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"of course, and plenty of good warm words to dress them in.  Facts always"
4180,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"yield the place of honor, in conversation, to thoughts about facts; but"
4181,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"if a false note is uttered, down comes the finger on the key and the man"
4182,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,of facts asserts his true dignity.  I have known three of these men of
4183,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"facts, at least, who were always formidable,--and one of them was"
4184,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,tyrannical.
4185,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4186,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"--Yes, a man sometimes makes a grand appearance on a particular occasion;"
4187,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"but these men knew something about almost everything, and never made"
4188,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,mistakes.--He?  _Veneers_ in first-rate style.  The mahogany scales off
4189,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"now and then in spots, and then you see the cheap light stuff--I"
4190,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"found--very fine in conversational information, the other day when we"
4191,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,were in company.  The talk ran upon mountains.  He was wonderfully well
4192,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"acquainted with the leading facts about the Andes, the Apennines, and the"
4193,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Appalachians; he had nothing in particular to say about Ararat, Ben"
4194,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Nevis, and various other mountains that were mentioned.  By and by some"
4195,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Revolutionary anecdote came up, and he showed singular familiarity with"
4196,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the lives of the Adamses, and gave many details relating to Major Andre."
4197,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"A point of Natural History being suggested, he gave an excellent account"
4198,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,of the air-bladder of fishes.  He was very full upon the subject of
4199,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"agriculture, but retired from the conversation when horticulture was"
4200,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,introduced in the discussion.  So he seemed well acquainted with the
4201,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"geology of anthracite, but did not pretend to know anything of other"
4202,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,kinds of coal.  There was something so odd about the extent and
4203,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"limitations of his knowledge, that I suspected all at once what might be"
4204,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the meaning of it, and waited till I got an opportunity.--Have you seen"
4205,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the ""New American Cyclopaedia?"" said I.--I have, he replied; I received"
4206,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"an early copy.--How far does it go?--He turned red, and answered,--To"
4207,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Araguay.--Oh, said I to myself,--not quite so far as Ararat;--that is the"
4208,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,reason he knew nothing about it; but he must have read all the rest
4209,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"straight through, and, if he can remember what is in this volume until he"
4210,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"has read all those that are to come, he will know more than I ever"
4211,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,thought he would.
4212,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4213,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Since I had this experience, I hear that somebody else has related a"
4214,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"similar story.  I didn't borrow it, for all that.--I made a comparison at"
4215,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"table some time since, which has often been quoted and received many"
4216,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,compliments.  It was that of the mind of a bigot to the pupil of the eye;
4217,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"the more light you pour on it, the more it contracts.  The simile is a"
4218,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"very obvious, and, I suppose I may now say, a happy one; for it has just"
4219,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,been shown me that it occurs in a Preface to certain Political Poems of
4220,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,Thomas Moore's published long before my remark was repeated.  When a
4221,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"person of fair character for literary honesty uses an image, such as"
4222,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"another has employed before him, the presumption is, that he has struck"
4223,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"upon it independently, or unconsciously recalled it, supposing it his"
4224,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,own.
4225,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4226,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"It is impossible to tell, in a great many cases, whether a comparison"
4227,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,which suddenly suggests itself is a new conception or a recollection.  I
4228,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,told you the other day that I never wrote a line of verse that seemed to
4229,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"me comparatively good, but it appeared old at once, and often as if it"
4230,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,had been borrowed.  But I confess I never suspected the above comparison
4231,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"of being old, except from the fact of its obviousness.  It is proper,"
4232,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"however, that I proceed by a formal instrument to relinquish all claim to"
4233,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,any property in an idea given to the world at about the time when I had
4234,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,just joined the class in which Master Thomas Moore was then a somewhat
4235,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,advanced scholar.
4236,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4237,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"I, therefore, in full possession of my native honesty, but knowing the"
4238,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"liability of all men to be elected to public office, and for that reason"
4239,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"feeling uncertain how soon I may be in danger of losing it, do hereby"
4240,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,renounce all claim to being considered the _first_ person who gave
4241,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,utterance to a certain simile or comparison referred to in the
4242,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"accompanying documents, and relating to the pupil of the eye on the one"
4243,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,part and the mind of the bigot on the other.  I hereby relinquish all
4244,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"glory and profit, and especially all claims to letters from autograph"
4245,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"collectors, founded upon my supposed property in the above"
4246,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"comparison,--knowing well, that, according to the laws of literature,"
4247,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,they who speak first hold the fee of the thing said.  I do also agree
4248,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"that all Editors of Cyclopedias and Biographical Dictionaries, all"
4249,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"Publishers of Reviews and Papers, and all Critics writing therein, shall"
4250,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,be at liberty to retract or qualify any opinion predicated on the
4251,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,supposition that I was the sole and undisputed author of the above
4252,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"comparison.  But, inasmuch as I do affirm that the comparison aforesaid"
4253,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"was uttered by me in the firm belief that it was new and wholly my own,"
4254,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,and as I have good reason to think that I had never seen or heard it when
4255,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"first expressed by me, and as it is well known that different persons may"
4256,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"independently utter the same idea,--as is evinced by that familiar line"
4257,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"from Donatus,--"
4258,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4259,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"""Pereant illi qui ante nos nostra dixerunt,""--"
4260,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4261,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"now, therefore, I do request by this instrument that all well-disposed"
4262,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,persons will abstain from asserting or implying that I am open to any
4263,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"accusation whatsoever touching the said comparison, and, if they have so"
4264,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"asserted or implied, that they will have the manliness forthwith to"
4265,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,retract the same assertion or insinuation.

4268,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,
4269,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,I think few persons have a greater disgust for plagiarism than myself.
4270,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"If I had even suspected that the idea in question was borrowed, I should"
4271,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"have disclaimed originality, or mentioned the coincidence, as I once did"
4272,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,in a case where I had happened to hit on an idea of Swift's.--But what
4273,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,shall I do about these verses I was going to read you?  I am afraid that
4274,LES SOCIETES POLYPHYSIOPHILOSOPHIQUES.,"half mankind would accuse me of stealing their thoughts, if I printed"

4344,CHAPTER VII,[This particular record is noteworthy principally for containing a paper
4345,CHAPTER VII,"by my friend, the Professor, with a poem or two annexed or intercalated."
4346,CHAPTER VII,I would suggest to young persons that they should pass over it for the
4347,CHAPTER VII,"present, and read, instead of it, that story about the young man who was"
4348,CHAPTER VII,"in love with the young lady, and in great trouble for something like nine"
4349,CHAPTER VII,"pages, but happily married on the tenth page or thereabouts, which, I"
4350,CHAPTER VII,"take it for granted, will be contained in the periodical where this is"
4351,CHAPTER VII,"found, unless it differ from all other publications of the kind."
4352,CHAPTER VII,"Perhaps, if such young people will lay the number aside, and take it up"
4353,CHAPTER VII,"ten years, or a little more, from the present time, they may find"

4357,CHAPTER VII,"My friend, the Professor, began talking with me one day in a dreary sort"
4358,CHAPTER VII,"of way.  I couldn't get at the difficulty for a good while, but at last"
4359,CHAPTER VII,it turned out that somebody had been calling him an old man.--He didn't
4360,CHAPTER VII,"mind his students calling him _the_ old man, he said.  That was a"
4361,CHAPTER VII,"technical expression, and he thought that he remembered hearing it"
4362,CHAPTER VII,applied to himself when he was about twenty-five.  It may be considered
4363,CHAPTER VII,as a familiar and sometimes endearing appellation.  An Irishwoman calls
4364,CHAPTER VII,"her husband ""the old man,"" and he returns the caressing expression by"
4365,CHAPTER VII,"speaking of her as ""the old woman.""  But now, said he, just suppose a"
4366,CHAPTER VII,case like one of these.  A young stranger is overheard talking of you as
4367,CHAPTER VII,a very nice old gentleman.  A friendly and genial critic speaks of your
4368,CHAPTER VII,green old age as illustrating the truth of some axiom you had uttered
4369,CHAPTER VII,with reference to that period of life.  What _I_ call an old man is a
4370,CHAPTER VII,"person with a smooth, shining crown and a fringe of scattered white"
4371,CHAPTER VII,"hairs, seen in the streets on sunshiny days, stooping as he walks,"
4372,CHAPTER VII,"bearing a cane, moving cautiously and slowly; telling old stories,"

4376,CHAPTER VII,"upset, and there is only a careful hand held round it to prevent the"
4377,CHAPTER VII,puffs of wind from blowing the flame out.  That's what I call an old man.
4378,CHAPTER VII,
4379,CHAPTER VII,"Now, said the Professor, you don't mean to tell me that I have got to"
4380,CHAPTER VII,"that yet?  Why, bless you, I am several years short of the time when--[I"
4381,CHAPTER VII,"knew what was coming, and could hardly keep from laughing; twenty years"
4382,CHAPTER VII,ago he used to quote it as one of those absurd speeches men of genius
4383,CHAPTER VII,"will make, and now he is going to argue from it]--several years short of"
4384,CHAPTER VII,the time when Balzac says that men are--most--you know--dangerous to--the
4385,CHAPTER VII,"hearts of--in short, most to be dreaded by duennas that have charge of"
4386,CHAPTER VII,"susceptible females.--What age is that? said I, statistically.--Fifty-two"
4387,CHAPTER VII,"years, answered the Professor.--Balzac ought to know, said I, if it is"
4388,CHAPTER VII,true that Goethe said of him that each of his stories must have been dug
4389,CHAPTER VII,out of a woman's heart.  But fifty-two is a high figure.
4390,CHAPTER VII,
4391,CHAPTER VII,"Stand in the light of the window, Professor, said I.--The Professor took"
4392,CHAPTER VII,"up the desired position.--You have white hairs, I said.--Had 'em any time"
4393,CHAPTER VII,"these twenty years, said the Professor.--And the crow's-foot,--_pes"
4394,CHAPTER VII,"anserinus_, rather.--The Professor smiled, as I wanted him to, and the"
4395,CHAPTER VII,"folds radiated like the ridges of a half-opened fan, from the outer"
4396,CHAPTER VII,corner of the eyes to the temples.--And the calipers said I.--What are
4397,CHAPTER VII,"the _calipers_? he asked, curiously.--Why, the parenthesis, said"
4398,CHAPTER VII,"I.--_Parenthesis_? said the Professor; what's that?--Why, look in the"
4399,CHAPTER VII,"glass when you are disposed to laugh, and see if your mouth isn't framed"
4400,CHAPTER VII,"in a couple of crescent lines,--so, my boy ( ).--It's all nonsense, said"
4401,CHAPTER VII,the Professor; just look at my _biceps_;--and he began pulling off his
4402,CHAPTER VII,"coat to show me his arm.  Be careful, said I; you can't bear exposure to"
4403,CHAPTER VII,"the air, at your time of life, as you could once.--I will box with you,"
4404,CHAPTER VII,"said the Professor, row with you, walk with you, ride with you, swim with"
4405,CHAPTER VII,"you, or sit at table with you, for fifty dollars a side.--Pluck survives"
4406,CHAPTER VII,"stamina, I answered."
4407,CHAPTER VII,
4408,CHAPTER VII,The Professor went off a little out of humor.  A few weeks afterwards he
4409,CHAPTER VII,"came in, looking very good-natured, and brought me a paper, which I have"
4410,CHAPTER VII,"here, and from which I shall read you some portions, if you don't object."
4411,CHAPTER VII,"He had been thinking the matter over, he said,--had read Cicero ""De"
4412,CHAPTER VII,"Senectute,"" and made up his mind to meet old age half way.  These were"
4413,CHAPTER VII,some of his reflections that he had written down; so here you have.

4415,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.
4416,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4417,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,There is no doubt when old age begins.  The human body is a furnace which
4418,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"keeps in blast three-score years and ten, more or less.  It burns about"
4419,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"three hundred pounds of carbon a year, (besides other fuel,) when in fair"
4420,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"working order, according to a great chemist's estimate.  When the fire"
4421,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"slackens, life declines; when it goes out, we are dead."
4422,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4423,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"It has been shown by some noted French experimenters, that the amount of"
4424,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"combustion increases up to about the thirtieth year, remains stationary"
4425,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"to about forty-five, and then diminishes.  This last is the point where"
4426,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,old age starts from.  The great fact of physical life is the perpetual
4427,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"commerce with the elements, and the fire is the measure of it."

4429,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"About this time of life, if food is plenty where you live,--for that, you"
4430,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"know, regulates matrimony,--you may be expecting to find yourself a"
4431,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,grandfather some fine morning; a kind of domestic felicity that gives one
4432,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"a cool shiver of delight to think of, as among the not remotely possible"
4433,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,events.
4434,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4435,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"I don't mind much those slipshod lines Dr. Johnson wrote to Thrale,"
4436,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,telling her about life's declining from _thirty-five_; the furnace is in
4437,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"full blast for ten years longer, as I have said.  The Romans came very"
4438,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,near the mark; their age of enlistment reached from seventeen to

4440,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4441,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"What is the use of fighting against the seasons, or the tides, or the"
4442,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"movements of the planetary bodies, or this ebb in the wave of life that"
4443,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,flows through us?  We are old fellows from the moment the fire begins to
4444,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,go out.  Let us always behave like gentlemen when we are introduced to
4445,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,new acquaintance.

4449,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Old Age, this is Mr. Professor; Mr. Professor, this is Old Age."
4450,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4451,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"_Old Age_.--Mr. Professor, I hope to see you well.  I have known you for"
4452,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"some time, though I think you did not know me.  Shall we walk down the"
4453,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,street together?
4454,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4455,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"_Professor_ (drawing back a little).--We can talk more quietly, perhaps,"
4456,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,in my study.  Will you tell me how it is you seem to be acquainted with
4457,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"everybody you are introduced to, though he evidently considers you an"
4458,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,entire stranger?
4459,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4460,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Old Age_.--I make it a rule never to force myself upon a person's
4461,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,recognition until I have known him at least _five years_.
4462,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4463,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Professor_.--Do you mean to say that you have known me so long as that?
4464,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4465,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"_Old Age_.  I do.  I left my card on you longer ago than that, but I am"
4466,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,afraid you never read it; yet I see you have it with you.
4467,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4468,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Professor_.--Where?
4469,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4470,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"_Old Age_.--There, between your eyebrows,--three straight lines running"
4471,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"up and down; all the probate courts know that token,--""Old Age, his"
4472,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"mark.""  Put your forefinger on the inner end of one eyebrow, and your"
4473,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,middle finger on the inner end of the other eyebrow; now separate the
4474,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"fingers, and you will smooth out my sign-manual; that's the way you used"
4475,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,to look before I left my card on you.
4476,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4477,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Professor_.--What message do people generally send back when you first
4478,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,call on them?
4479,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4480,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Old Age_.--Not at home.  Then I leave a card and go.  Next year I call;
4481,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"get the same answer; leave another card.  So for five or six,--sometimes"
4482,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"ten years or more.  At last, if they don't let me in, I break in through"
4483,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,the front door or the windows.
4484,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4485,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,We talked together in this way some time.  Then Old Age said
4486,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"again,--Come, let us walk down the street together,--and offered me a"
4487,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"cane, an eyeglass, a tippet, and a pair of over-shoes.--No, much obliged"
4488,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"to you, said I.  I don't want those things, and I had a little rather"
4489,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"talk with you here, privately, in my study.  So I dressed myself up in a"
4490,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"jaunty way and walked out alone;--got a fall, caught a cold, was laid up"
4491,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"with a lumbago, and had time to think over this whole matter."
4492,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4493,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_Explicit Allegoria Senectutis_.
4494,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4495,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"We have settled when old age begins.  Like all Nature's processes, it is"
4496,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"gentle and gradual in its approaches, strewed with illusions, and all its"
4497,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,little griefs soothed by natural sedatives.  But the iron hand is not
4498,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,less irresistible because it wears the velvet glove.  The button-wood
4499,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"throws off its bark in large flakes, which one may find lying at its"
4500,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"foot, pushed out, and at last pushed off, by that tranquil movement from"
4501,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"beneath, which is too slow to be seen, but too powerful to be arrested."
4502,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"One finds them always, but one rarely sees them fall.  So it is our youth"
4503,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"drops from us,--scales off, sapless and lifeless, and lays bare the"
4504,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"tender and immature fresh growth of old age.  Looked at collectively, the"
4505,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,changes of old age appear as a series of personal insults and
4506,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"indignities, terminating at last in death, which Sir Thomas Browne has"
4507,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"called ""the very disgrace and ignominy of our nature."""
4508,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4509,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,My lady's cheek can boast no more
4510,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,The cranberry white and pink it wore;
4511,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"And where her shining locks divide,"
4512,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,The parting line is all too wide--
4513,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4514,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"No, no,--this will never do.  Talk about men, if you will, but spare the"
4515,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,poor women.
4516,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4517,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,We have a brief description of seven stages of life by a remarkably good
4518,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"observer.  It is very presumptuous to attempt to add to it, yet I have"
4519,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,been struck with the fact that life admits of a natural analysis into no
4520,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"less than fifteen distinct periods.  Taking the five primary divisions,"
4521,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, old age, each of these has its own"
4522,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"three periods of immaturity, complete development, and decline.  I"
4523,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"recognize on _old_ baby at once,--with its ""pipe and mug,"" (a stick of"
4524,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"candy and a porringer,)--so does everybody; and an old child shedding its"
4525,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,milk-teeth is only a little prototype of the old man shedding his
4526,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"permanent ones.  Fifty or thereabouts is only the childhood, as it were,"
4527,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,of old age; the graybeard youngster must be weaned from his late suppers
4528,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"now.  So you will see that you have to make fifteen stages at any rate,"
4529,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"and that it would not be hard to make twenty-five; five primary, each"
4530,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,with five secondary divisions.
4531,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4532,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,The infancy and childhood of commencing old age have the same ingenuous
4533,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,simplicity and delightful unconsciousness about them as the first stage
4534,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,of the earlier periods of life shows.  The great delusion of mankind is
4535,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,in supposing that to be individual and exceptional which is universal and
4536,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,according to law.  A person is always startled when he hears himself
4537,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,seriously called an old man for the first time.
4538,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4539,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Nature gets us out of youth into manhood, as sailors are hurried on board"
4540,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"of vessels,--in a state of intoxication.  We are hustled into maturity"
4541,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"reeling with our passions and imaginations, and we have drifted far away"
4542,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,from port before we awake out of our illusions.  But to carry us out of
4543,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"maturity into old age, without our knowing where we are going, she drugs"
4544,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"us with strong opiates, and so we stagger along with wide open eyes that"
4545,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,see nothing until snow enough has fallen on our heads to rouse our
4546,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,comatose brains out of their stupid trances.
4547,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4548,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,There is one mark of age that strikes me more than any of the physical
4549,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,ones;--I mean the formation of _Habits_.  An old man who shrinks into
4550,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,himself falls into ways that become as positive and as much beyond the
4551,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,reach of outside influences as if they were governed by clock-work.  The
4552,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"_animal_ functions, as the physiologists call them, in distinction from"
4553,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"the _organic_, tend, in the process of deterioration to which age and"
4554,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"neglect united gradually lead them, to assume the periodical or"
4555,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"rhythmical type of movement.  Every man's _heart_ (this organ belongs,"
4556,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"you know, to the organic system) has a regular mode of action; but I know"
4557,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"a great many men whose _brains_, and all their voluntary existence"
4558,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"flowing from their brains, have a _systole_ and _diastole_ as regular as"
4559,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,that of the heart itself.  Habit is the approximation of the animal
4560,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,system to the organic.  It is a confession of failure in the highest
4561,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"function of being, which involves a perpetual self-determination, in full"
4562,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"view of all existing circumstances.  But habit, you see, is an action in"
4563,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,present circumstances from past motives.  It is substituting a _vis a
4564,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,tergo_ for the evolution of living force.
4565,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4566,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"When a man, instead of burning up three hundred pounds of carbon a year,"
4567,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"has got down to two hundred and fifty, it is plain enough he must"
4568,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,economize force somewhere.  Now habit is a labor-saving invention which
4569,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"enables a man to get along with less fuel,--that is all; for fuel is"
4570,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"force, you know, just as much in the page I am writing for you as in the"
4571,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"locomotive or the legs that carry it to you.  Carbon is the same thing,"
4572,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"whether you call it wood, or coal, or bread and cheese.  A reverend"
4573,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"gentleman demurred to this statement,--as if, because combustion is"
4574,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"asserted to be the _sine qua non_ of thought, therefore thought is"
4575,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,alleged to be a purely chemical process.  Facts of chemistry are one
4576,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"thing, I told him, and facts of consciousness another.  It can be proved"
4577,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"to him, by a very simple analysis of some of his spare elements, that"
4578,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"every Sunday, when he does his duty faithfully, he uses up more"
4579,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,phosphorus out of his brain and nerves than on ordinary days.  But then
4580,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"he had his choice whether to do his duty, or to neglect it, and save his"
4581,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,phosphorus and other combustibles.
4582,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4583,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,It follows from all this that _the formation of habits_ ought naturally
4584,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"to be, as it is, the special characteristic of age.  As for the muscular"
4585,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"powers, they pass their maximum long before the time when the true"
4586,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"decline of life begins, if we may judge by the experience of the ring.  A"
4587,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"man is ""stale,"" I think, in their language, soon after thirty,--often, no"
4588,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"doubt, much earlier, as gentlemen of the pugilistic profession are"
4589,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,exceedingly apt to keep their vital fire burning _with the blower up_.
4590,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4591,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,--So far without Tully.  But in the mean time I have been reading the
4592,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"treatise, ""De Senectute.""  It is not long, but a leisurely performance."
4593,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,The old gentleman was sixty-three years of age when he addressed it to
4594,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"his friend T. Pomponius Atticus, Eq., a person of distinction, some two"
4595,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"or three years older.  We read it when we are schoolboys, forget all"
4596,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"about it for thirty years, and then take it up again by a natural"
4597,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"instinct,--provided always that we read Latin as we drink water, without"
4598,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"stopping to taste it, as all of us who ever learned it at school or"
4599,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,college ought to do.
4600,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4601,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,Cato is the chief speaker in the dialogue.  A good deal of it is what
4602,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"would be called in vulgar phrase ""slow.""  It unpacks and unfolds"
4603,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"incidental illustrations which a modern writer would look at the back of,"
4604,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,and toss each to its pigeon-hole.  I think ancient classics and ancient
4605,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,people are alike in the tendency to this kind of expansion.
4606,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4607,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,An old doctor came to me once (this is literal fact) with some
4608,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,contrivance or other for people with broken kneepans.  As the patient
4609,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"would be confined for a good while, he might find it dull work to sit"
4610,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"with his hands in his lap.  Reading, the ingenious inventor suggested,"
4611,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"would be an agreeable mode of passing the time.  He mentioned, in his"
4612,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"written account of his contrivance, various works that might amuse the"
4613,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"weary hour.  I remember only three,--Don Quixote, Tom Jones, and _Watts"
4614,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,on the Mind_.
4615,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4616,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,It is not generally understood that Cicero's essay was delivered as a
4617,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"lyceum lecture, (_concio popularis_,) at the Temple of Mercury.  The"
4618,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"journals (_papyri_) of the day (""Tempora Quotidiana,""--""Tribuinus"
4619,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Quirinalis,""--""Praeco Romanus,"" and the rest) gave abstracts of it, one"
4620,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"of which I have translated and modernized, as being a substitute for the"
4621,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,analysis I intended to make.
4622,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4623,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,IV.  Kal.  Mart. . . . .
4624,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4625,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"The lecture at the Temple of Mercury, last evening, was well attended by"
4626,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,the _elite_ of our great city.  Two hundred thousand sestertia were
4627,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,thought to have been represented in the house.  The doors were besieged
4628,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"by a mob of shabby fellows, (_illotum vulgus_,) who were at length"
4629,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,quieted after two or three had been somewhat roughly handled (_gladio
4630,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"jugulati_).  The speaker was the well-known Mark Tully, Eq.,--the subject"
4631,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Old Age.  Mr. T. has a lean and scraggy person, with a very unpleasant"
4632,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"excrescence upon his nasal feature, from which his nickname of"
4633,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,_chick-pea_ (Cicero) is said by some to be derived.  As a lecturer is
4634,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"public property, we may remark, that his outer garment (_toga_) was of"
4635,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"cheap stuff and somewhat worn, and that his general style and appearance"
4636,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"of dress and manner (_habitus_, _vestitusque_) were somewhat provincial."
4637,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4638,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,The lecture consisted of an imaginary dialogue between Cato and Laelius.
4639,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"We found the first portion rather heavy, and retired a few moments for"
4640,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"refreshment (_pocula quaedam vini_).--All want to reach old age, says"
4641,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Cato, and grumble when they get it; therefore they are donkeys.--The"
4642,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,lecturer will allow us to say that he is the donkey; we know we shall
4643,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"grumble at old age, but we want to live through youth and manhood, _in"
4644,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,spite_ of the troubles we shall groan over.--There was considerable
4645,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"prosing as to what old age can do and can't.--True, but not new."
4646,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Certainly, old folks can't jump,--break the necks of their thigh-bones,"
4647,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"(_femorum cervices_,) if they do; can't crack nuts with their teeth;"
4648,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,can't climb a greased pole (_malum inunctum scandere non possunt_); but
4649,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,they can tell old stories and give you good advice; if they know what you
4650,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"have made up your mind to do when you ask them.--All this is well enough,"
4651,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,but won't set the Tiber on fire (_Tiberim accendere nequaquam potest_.)
4652,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4653,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"There were some clever things enough, (_dicta hand inepta_,) a few of"
4654,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,which are worth reporting.--Old people are accused of being forgetful;
4655,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,but they never forget where they have put their money.--Nobody is so old
4656,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,he doesn't think he can live a year.--The lecturer quoted an ancient
4657,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"maxim,--Grow old early, if you would be old long,--but disputed"
4658,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"it.--Authority, he thought, was the chief privilege of age.--It is not"
4659,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"great to have money, but fine to govern those that have it.--Old age"
4660,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"begins at _forty-six_ years, according to the common opinion.--It is not"
4661,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,every kind of old age or of wine that grows sour with time.--Some
4662,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"excellent remarks were made on immortality, but mainly borrowed from and"
4663,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"credited to Plato.--Several pleasing anecdotes were told.--Old Milo,"
4664,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"champion of the heavy weights in his day, looked at his arms and"
4665,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"whimpered, ""They are dead.""  Not so dead as you, you old fool,--says"
4666,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,Cato;--you never were good for anything but for your shoulders and
4667,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,flanks.--Pisistratus asked Solon what made him dare to be so obstinate.
4668,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Old age, said Solon."
4669,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4670,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"The lecture was on the whole acceptable, and a credit to our culture and"
4671,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,civilization.--The reporter goes on to state that there will be no

4677,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4678,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"--After all, the most encouraging things I find in the treatise, ""De"
4679,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Senectute,"" are the stories of men who have found new occupations when"
4680,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"growing old, or kept up their common pursuits in the extreme period of"
4681,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"life.  Cato learned Greek when he was old, and speaks of wishing to learn"
4682,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"the fiddle, or some such instrument, (_fidibus_,) after the example of"
4683,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Socrates.  Solon learned something new, every day, in his old age, as he"
4684,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,gloried to proclaim.  Cyrus pointed out with pride and pleasure the trees
4685,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,he had planted with his own hand.  [I remember a pillar on the Duke of
4686,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Northumberland's estate at Alnwick, with an inscription in similar words,"
4687,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"if not the same.  That, like other country pleasures, never wears out."
4688,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"None is too rich, none too poor, none too young, none too old to enjoy"
4689,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"it.]  There is a New England story I have heard more to the point,"
4690,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"however, than any of Cicero's.  A young farmer was urged to set out some"
4691,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"apple-trees.--No, said he, they are too long growing, and I don't want to"
4692,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,plant for other people.  The young farmer's father was spoken to about
4693,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"it, but he, with better reason, alleged that apple-trees were slow and"
4694,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,life was fleeting.  At last some one mentioned it to the old grandfather
4695,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"of the young farmer.  He had nothing else to do,--so he stuck in some"
4696,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,trees.  He lived long enough to drink barrels of cider made from the
4697,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,apples that grew on those trees.
4698,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4699,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"As for myself, after visiting a friend lately,--[Do remember all the time"
4700,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,that this is the Professor's paper.]--I satisfied myself that I had
4701,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,better concede the fact that--my contemporaries are not so young as they
4702,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"have been,--and that,--awkward as it is,--science and history agree in"
4703,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,telling me that I can claim the immunities and must own the humiliations
4704,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,of the early stage of senility.  Ah! but we have all gone down the hill
4705,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,together.  The dandies of my time have split their waistbands and taken
4706,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,to high-low shoes.  The beauties of my recollections--where are they?
4707,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,They have run the gantlet of the years as well as I.  First the years
4708,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,pelted them with red roses till their cheeks were all on fire.  By and by
4709,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"they began throwing white roses, and that morning flush passed away.  At"
4710,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"last one of the years threw a snow-ball, and after that no year let the"
4711,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,poor girls pass without throwing snow-balls.  And then came rougher
4712,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"missiles,--ice and stones; and from time to time an arrow whistled, and"
4713,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,down went one of the poor girls.  So there are but few left; and we don't
4714,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"call those few _girls_, but--"
4715,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,
4716,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"Ah, me!  Here am I groaning just as the old Greek sighed _Ai_, _ai_! and"
4717,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"the old Roman, _Eheu_!  I have no doubt we should die of shame and grief"
4718,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,"at the indignities offered us by age, if it were not that we see so many"
4719,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,others as badly or worse off than ourselves.  We always compare ourselves
4720,THE PROFESSOR'S PAPER.,with our contemporaries.

4787,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4788,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,As to _giving up_ because the almanac or the Family-Bible says that it is
4789,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"about time to do it, I have no intention of doing any such thing.  I"
4790,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,grant you that I burn less carbon than some years ago.  I see people of
4791,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"my standing really good for nothing, decrepit, effete, _la levre"
4792,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"inferieure deja pendante_, with what little life they have left mainly"
4793,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,concentrated in their epigastrium.  But as the disease of old age is
4794,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"epidemic, endemic, and sporadic, and everybody that lives long enough is"
4795,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"sure to catch it, I am going to say, for the encouragement of such as"
4796,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"need it, how I treat the malady in my own case."
4797,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4798,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"First.  As I feel, that, when I have anything to do, there is less time"
4799,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"for it than when I was younger, I find that I give my attention more"
4800,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"thoroughly, and use my time more economically than ever before; so that I"
4801,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"can learn anything twice as easily as in my earlier days.  I am not,"
4802,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"therefore, afraid to attack a new study.  I took up a difficult language"
4803,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"a very few years ago with good success, and think of mathematics and"
4804,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,metaphysics by-and-by.
4805,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4806,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Secondly.  I have opened my eyes to a good many neglected privileges and
4807,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"pleasures within my reach, and requiring only a little courage to enjoy"
4808,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,them.  You may well suppose it pleased me to find that old Cato was
4809,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"thinking of learning to play the fiddle, when I had deliberately taken it"
4810,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"up in my old age, and satisfied myself that I could get much comfort, if"
4811,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"not much music, out of it."
4812,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4813,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Thirdly.  I have found that some of those active exercises, which are"
4814,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"commonly thought to belong to young folks only, may be enjoyed at a much"
4815,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,later period.
4816,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4817,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,A young friend has lately written an admirable article in one of the
4818,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"journals, entitled, ""Saints and their Bodies.""  Approving of his general"
4819,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"doctrines, and grateful for his records of personal experience, I cannot"
4820,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,refuse to add my own experimental confirmation of his eulogy of one
4821,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"particular form of active exercise and amusement, namely, _boating_.  For"
4822,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the past nine years, I have rowed about, during a good part of the"
4823,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"summer, on fresh or salt water.  My present fleet on the river Charles"
4824,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,consists of three row-boats.  1. A small flat-bottomed skiff of the shape
4825,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of a flat-iron, kept mainly to lend to boys.  2. A fancy ""dory"" for two"
4826,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"pairs of sculls, in which I sometimes go out with my young folks.  3. My"
4827,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"own particular water-sulky, a ""skeleton"" or ""shell"" race-boat, twenty-two"
4828,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"feet long, with huge outriggers, which boat I pull with ten-foot"
4829,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"sculls,--alone, of course, as it holds but one, and tips him out, if he"
4830,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"doesn't mind what he is about.  In this I glide around the Back Bay, down"
4831,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the stream, up the Charles to Cambridge and Watertown, up the Mystic,"
4832,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"round the wharves, in the wake of steamboats which leave a swell after"
4833,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"them delightful to rock upon; I linger under the bridges,--those"
4834,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"""caterpillar bridges,"" as my brother professor so happily called them;"
4835,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,rub against the black sides of old wood-schooners; cool down under the
4836,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"overhanging stern of some tall Indiaman; stretch across to the Navy-Yard,"
4837,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"where the sentinel warns me off from the Ohio,--just as if I should hurt"
4838,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"her by lying in her shadow; then strike out into the harbor, where the"
4839,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"water gets clear and the air smells of the ocean,--till all at once I"
4840,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"remember, that, if a west wind blows up of a sudden, I shall drift along"
4841,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"past the islands, out of sight of the dear old State-house,--plate,"
4842,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"tumbler, knife and fork all waiting at home, but no chair drawn up at the"
4843,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"table,--all the dear people waiting, waiting, waiting, while the boat is"
4844,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"sliding, sliding, sliding into the great desert, where there is no tree"
4845,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,and no fountain.  As I don't want my wreck to be washed up on one of the
4846,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"beaches in company with devil's-aprons, bladder-weeds, dead horse-shoes,"
4847,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"and bleached crab-shells, I turn about and flap my long narrow wings for"
4848,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"home.  When the tide is running out swiftly, I have a splendid fight to"
4849,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"get through the bridges, but always make it a rule to beat,--though I"
4850,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"have been jammed up into pretty tight places at times, and was caught"
4851,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"once between a vessel swinging round and the pier, until our bones (the"
4852,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"boat's, that is) cracked as if we had been in the jaws of Behemoth.  Then"
4853,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"back to my moorings at the foot of the Common, off with the rowing-dress,"
4854,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"dash under the green translucent wave, return to the garb of"
4855,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"civilization, walk through my Garden, take a look at my elms on the"
4856,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Common, and, reaching my habitat, in consideration of my advanced period"
4857,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of life, indulge in the Elysian abandonment of a huge recumbent chair."
4858,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4859,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,When I have established a pair of well-pronounced feathering-calluses on
4860,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"my thumbs, when I am in training so that I can do my fifteen miles at a"
4861,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"stretch without coming to grief in any way, when I can perform my mile in"
4862,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"eight minutes or a little less, then I feel as if I had old Time's head"
4863,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"in chancery, and could give it to him at my leisure."
4864,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4865,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,I do not deny the attraction of walking.  I have bored this ancient city
4866,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"through and through in my daily travels, until I know it as an old"
4867,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"inhabitant of a Cheshire knows his cheese.  Why, it was I who, in the"
4868,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"course of these rambles, discovered that remarkable avenue called _Myrtle"
4869,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Street_, stretching in one long line from east of the Reservoir to a"
4870,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,precipitous and rudely paved cliff which looks down on the grim abode of
4871,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Science, and beyond it to the far hills; a promenade so delicious in its"
4872,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"repose, so cheerfully varied with glimpses down the northern slope into"
4873,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"busy Cambridge Street with its iron river of the horse-railroad, and"
4874,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"wheeled barges gliding back and forward over it,--so delightfully closing"
4875,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"at its western extremity in sunny courts and passages where I know peace,"
4876,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"and beauty, and virtue, and serene old age must be perpetual tenants,--so"
4877,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"alluring to all who desire to take their daily stroll, in the words of"
4878,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Dr. Watts,--"
4879,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4880,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"""Alike unknowing and unknown,""--"
4881,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4882,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,that nothing but a sense of duty would have prompted me to reveal the
4883,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"secret of its existence.  I concede, therefore, that walking is an"
4884,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"immeasurably fine invention, of which old age ought constantly to avail"
4885,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,itself.
4886,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4887,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Saddle-leather is in some respects even preferable to sole-leather.  The
4888,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,principal objection to it is of a financial character.  But you may be
4889,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,sure that Bacon and Sydenham did not recommend it for nothing.  One's
4890,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"_hepar_, or, in vulgar language, liver,--a ponderous organ, weighing some"
4891,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"three or four pounds,--goes up and down like the dasher of a churn in the"
4892,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"midst of the other vital arrangements, at every step of a trotting horse."
4893,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,The brains also are shaken up like coppers in a money-box.  Riding is
4894,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"good, for those that are born with a silver-mounted bridle in their hand,"
4895,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"and can ride as much and as often as they like, without thinking all the"
4896,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,time they hear that steady grinding sound as the horse's jaws triturate
4897,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,with calm lateral movement the bank-bills and promises to pay upon which
4898,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,it is notorious that the profligate animal in question feeds day and
4899,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,night.
4900,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4901,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Instead, however, of considering these kinds of exercise in this"
4902,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"empirical way, I will devote a brief space to an examination of them in a"
4903,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,more scientific form.
4904,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4905,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"The pleasure of exercise is due first to a purely physical impression,"
4906,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,and secondly to a sense of power in action.  The first source of pleasure
4907,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,varies of course with our condition and the state of the surrounding
4908,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"circumstances; the second with the amount and kind of power, and the"
4909,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,extent and kind of action.  In all forms of active exercise there are
4910,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"three powers simultaneously in action,--the will, the muscles, and the"
4911,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,intellect.  Each of these predominates in different kinds of exercise.
4912,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"In walking, the will and muscles are so accustomed to work together and"
4913,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"perform their task with so little expenditure of force, that the"
4914,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"intellect is left comparatively free.  The mental pleasure in walking, as"
4915,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"such, is in the sense of power over all our moving machinery.  But in"
4916,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"riding, I have the additional pleasure of governing another will, and my"
4917,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"muscles extend to the tips of the animal's ears and to his four hoofs,"
4918,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,instead of stopping at my hands and feet.  Now in this extension of my
4919,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"volition and my physical frame into another animal, my tyrannical"
4920,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,instincts and my desire for heroic strength are at once gratified.  When
4921,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,the horse ceases to have a will of his own and his muscles require no
4922,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"special attention on your part, then you may live on horseback as Wesley"
4923,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"did, and write sermons or take naps, as you like.  But you will observe,"
4924,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"that, in riding on horseback, you always have a feeling, that, after all,"
4925,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"it is not you that do the work, but the animal, and this prevents the"
4926,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,satisfaction from being complete.
4927,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4928,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Now let us look at the conditions of rowing.  I won't suppose you to be
4929,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"disgracing yourself in one of those miserable tubs, tugging in which is"
4930,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,to rowing the true boat what riding a cow is to bestriding an Arab.  You
4931,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"know the Esquimaux _kayak_, (if that is the name of it,) don't you?  Look"
4932,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"at that model of one over my door.  Sharp, rather?--On the contrary, it"
4933,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"is a lubber to the one you and I must have; a Dutch fish-wife to Psyche,"
4934,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"contrasted with what I will tell you about.--Our boat, then, is something"
4935,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of the shape of a pickerel, as you look down upon his back, he lying in"
4936,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,the sunshine just where the sharp edge of the water cuts in among the
4937,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"lily-pads.  It is a kind of a giant _pod_, as one may say,--tight"
4938,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"everywhere, except in a little place in the middle, where you sit.  Its"
4939,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"length is from seven to ten yards, and as it is only from sixteen to"
4940,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"thirty inches wide in its widest part, you understand why you want those"
4941,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"""outriggers,"" or projecting iron frames with the rowlocks in which the"
4942,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,oars play.  My rowlocks are five feet apart; double the greatest width of
4943,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,the boat.
4944,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4945,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Here you are, then, afloat with a body a rod and a half long, with arms,"
4946,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"or wings, as you may choose to call them, stretching more than twenty"
4947,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,feet from tip to tip; every volition of yours extending as perfectly into
4948,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"them as if your spinal cord ran down the centre strip of your boat, and"
4949,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,the nerves of your arms tingled as far as the broad blades of your
4950,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"oars,--oars of spruce, balanced, leathered, and ringed under your own"
4951,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"special direction.  This, in sober earnest, is the nearest approach to"
4952,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,flying that man has ever made or perhaps ever will make.  As the hawk
4953,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"sails without flapping his pinions, so you drift with the tide when you"
4954,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"will, in the most luxurious form of locomotion indulged to an embodied"
4955,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"spirit.  But if your blood wants rousing, turn round that stake in the"
4956,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"river, which you see a mile from here; and when you come in in sixteen"
4957,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"minutes, (if you do, for we are old boys, and not champion scullers, you"
4958,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"remember,) then say if you begin to feel a little warmed up or not!  You"
4959,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"can row easily and gently all day, and you can row yourself blind and"
4960,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"black in the face in ten minutes, just as you like.  It has been long"
4961,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,agreed that there is no way in which a man can accomplish so much labor
4962,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"with his muscles as in rowing.  It is in the boat, then, that man finds"
4963,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,the largest extension of his volitional and muscular existence; and yet
4964,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"he may tax both of them so slightly, in that most delicious of exercises,"
4965,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"that he shall mentally write his sermon, or his poem, or recall the"
4966,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"remarks he has made in company and put them in form for the public, as"
4967,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,well as in his easy-chair.
4968,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4969,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"I dare not publicly name the rare joys, the infinite delights, that"
4970,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"intoxicate me on some sweet June morning, when the river and bay are"
4971,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"smooth as a sheet of beryl-green silk, and I run along ripping it up with"
4972,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"my knife-edged shell of a boat, the rent closing after me like those"
4973,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"wounds of angels which Milton tells of, but the seam still shining for"
4974,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"many a long rood behind me.  To lie still over the Flats, where the"
4975,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"waters are shallow, and see the crabs crawling and the sculpins gliding"
4976,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"busily and silently beneath the boat,--to rustle in through the long"
4977,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"harsh grass that leads up some tranquil creek,--to take shelter from the"
4978,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"sunbeams under one of the thousand-footed bridges, and look down its"
4979,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"interminable colonnades, crusted with green and oozy growths, studded"
4980,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"with minute barnacles, and belted with rings of dark muscles, while"
4981,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,overhead streams and thunders that other river whose every wave is a
4982,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,human soul flowing to eternity as the river below flows to the
4983,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"ocean,--lying there moored unseen, in loneliness so profound that the"
4984,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,columns of Tadmor in the Desert could not seem more remote from
4985,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"life,--the cool breeze on one's forehead, the stream whispering against"
4986,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the half-sunken pillars,--why should I tell of these things, that I"
4987,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,should live to see my beloved haunts invaded and the waves blackened with
4988,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,boats as with a swarm of water-beetles?  What a city of idiots we must be
4989,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"not to have covered this glorious bay with gondolas and wherries, as we"
4990,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,have just learned to cover the ice in winter with skaters!
4991,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
4992,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"I am satisfied that such a set of black-coated, stiff-jointed,"
4993,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"soft-muscled, paste-complexioned youth as we can boast in our Atlantic"
4994,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,cities never before sprang from loins of Anglo-Saxon lineage.  Of the
4995,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,females that are the mates of these males I do not here speak.  I
4996,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,preached my sermon from the lay-pulpit on this matter a good while ago.
4997,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Of course, if you heard it, you know my belief is that the total climatic"
4998,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"influences here are getting up a number of new patterns of humanity, some"
4999,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of which are not an improvement on the old model.  Clipper-built, sharp"
5000,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"in the bows, long in the spars, slender to look at, and fast to go, the"
5001,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"ship, which is the great organ of our national life of relation, is but a"
5002,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,reproduction of the typical form which the elements impress upon its
5003,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,builder.  All this we cannot help; but we can make the best of these
5004,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"influences, such as they are.  We have a few good boatmen,--no good"
5005,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"horsemen that I hear of,--I cannot speak for cricketing,--but as for any"
5006,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"great athletic feat performed by a gentleman in these latitudes, society"
5007,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,would drop a man who should run round the Common in five minutes.  Some
5008,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of our amateur fencers, single-stick players, and boxers, we have no"
5009,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"reason to be ashamed of.  Boxing is rough play, but not too rough for a"
5010,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,hearty young fellow.  Anything is better than this white-blooded
5011,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,degeneration to which we all tend.
5012,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
5013,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,I dropped into a gentlemen's sparring exhibition only last evening.  It
5014,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,did my heart good to see that there were a few young and youngish youths
5015,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,left who could take care of their own heads in case of emergency.  It is
5016,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"a fine sight, that of a gentleman resolving himself into the primitive"
5017,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"constituents of his humanity.  Here is a delicate young man now, with an"
5018,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"intellectual countenance, a slight figure, a sub-pallid complexion, a"
5019,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"most unassuming deportment, a mild adolescent in fact, that any Hiram or"
5020,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Jonathan from between the ploughtails would of course expect to handle
5021,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"with perfect ease.  Oh, he is taking off his gold-bowed spectacles!  Ah,"
5022,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"he is divesting himself of his cravat!  Why, he is stripping off his"
5023,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"coat!  Well, here he is, sure enough, in a tight silk shirt, and with two"
5024,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,things that look like batter puddings in the place of his fists.  Now see
5025,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"that other fellow with another pair of batter puddings,--the big one with"
5026,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the broad shoulders; he will certainly knock the little man's head off,"
5027,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"if he strikes him.  Feinting, dodging, stopping, hitting,"
5028,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"countering,--little man's head not off yet.  You might as well try to"
5029,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,jump upon your own shadow as to hit the little man's intellectual
5030,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,features.  He needn't have taken off the gold-bowed spectacles at all.
5031,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Quick, cautious, shifty, nimble, cool, he catches all the fierce lunges"
5032,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"or gets out of their reach, till his turn comes, and then, whack goes one"
5033,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of the batter puddings against the big one's ribs, and bang goes the"
5034,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"other into the big one's face, and, staggering, shuffling, slipping,"
5035,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"tripping, collapsing, sprawling, down goes the big one in a miscellaneous"
5036,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"bundle.--If my young friend, whose excellent article I have referred to,"
5037,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"could only introduce the manly art of self-defence among the clergy, I am"
5038,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,satisfied that we should have better sermons and an infinitely less
5039,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,quarrelsome church-militant.  A bout with the gloves would let off the
5040,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"ill-nature, and cure the indigestion, which, united, have embroiled their"
5041,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,subject in a bitter controversy.  We should then often hear that a point
5042,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"of difference between an infallible and a heretic, instead of being"
5043,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"vehemently discussed in a series of newspaper articles, had been settled"
5044,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"by a friendly contest in several rounds, at the close of which the"
5045,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"parties shook hands and appeared cordially reconciled,"
5046,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
5047,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"But boxing you and I are too old for, I am afraid.  I was for a moment"
5048,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"tempted, by the contagion of muscular electricity last evening, to try"
5049,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the gloves with the Benicia Boy, who looked in as a friend to the noble"
5050,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"art; but remembering that he had twice my weight and half my age, besides"
5051,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the advantage of his training, I sat still and said nothing."
5052,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
5053,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,There is one other delicate point I wish to speak of with reference to
5054,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,old age.  I refer to the use of dioptric media which correct the
5055,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"diminished refracting power of the humors of the eye,--in other words,"
5056,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"spectacles.  I don't use them.  All I ask is a large, fair type, a strong"
5057,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"daylight or gas-light, and one yard of focal distance, and my eyes are as"
5058,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"good as ever.  But if _your_ eyes fail, I can tell you something"
5059,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"encouraging.  There is now living in New York State an old gentleman who,"
5060,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"perceiving his sight to fail, immediately took to exercising it on the"
5061,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"finest print, and in this way fairly bullied Nature out of her foolish"
5062,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"habit of taking liberties at five-and-forty, or thereabout.  And now this"
5063,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"old gentleman performs the most extraordinary feats with his pen, showing"
5064,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,that his eyes must be a pair of microscopes.  I should be afraid to say
5065,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"to you how much he writes in the compass of a half-dime,--whether the"
5066,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Psalms or the Gospels, or the Psalms _and_ the Gospels, I won't be"
5067,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,positive.
5068,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
5069,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,But now let rue tell you this.  If the time comes when you must lay down
5070,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"the fiddle and the bow, because your fingers are too stiff, and drop the"
5071,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"ten-foot sculls, because your arms are too weak, and, after dallying"
5072,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"awhile with eye-glasses, come at last to the undisguised reality of"
5073,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"spectacles,--if the time comes when that fire of life we spoke of has"
5074,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,burned so low that where its flames reverberated there is only the sombre
5075,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"stain of regret, and where its coals glowed, only the white ashes that"
5076,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"cover the embers of memory,--don't let your heart grow cold, and you may"
5077,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,carry cheerfulness and love with you into the teens of your second
5078,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"century, if you can last so long.  As our friend, the Poet, once said, in"
5079,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,some of those old-fashioned heroics of his which he keeps for his private
5080,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"reading,--"
5081,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,
5082,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Call him not old, whose visionary brain"
5083,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Holds o'er the past its undivided reign.
5084,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,For him in vain the envious seasons roll
5085,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,Who bears eternal summer in his soul.
5086,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"If yet the minstrel's song, the poet's lay,"
5087,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Spring with her birds, or children with their play,"
5088,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Or maiden's smile, or heavenly dream of art"
5089,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Stir the few life-drops creeping round his heart,--"
5090,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Turn to the record where his years are told,--"
5091,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"Count his gray hairs,--they cannot make him old!"

5106,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,some of them might take my convictions as a personal indignity to
5107,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,themselves.  But having read our company so much of the Professor's talk
5108,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"about age and other subjects connected with physical life, I took the"
5109,THE LAST BLOSSOM.,"next Sunday morning to repeat to them the following poem of his, which I"

5190,CHAPTER VIII,"One has to dismount from an idea, and get into the saddle again, at every"

5192,CHAPTER VIII,
5193,CHAPTER VIII,"--The old gentleman who sits opposite, finding that spring had fairly"
5194,CHAPTER VIII,"come, mounted a white hat one day, and walked into the street.  It seems"
5195,CHAPTER VIII,"to have been a premature or otherwise exceptionable exhibition, not"
5196,CHAPTER VIII,unlike that commemorated by the late Mr. Bayly.  When the old gentleman
5197,CHAPTER VIII,"came home, he looked very red in the face, and complained that he had"
5198,CHAPTER VIII,"been ""made sport of.""  By sympathizing questions, I learned from him that"
5199,CHAPTER VIII,"a boy had called him ""old daddy,"" and asked him when he had his hat"
5200,CHAPTER VIII,whitewashed.
5201,CHAPTER VIII,
5202,CHAPTER VIII,"This incident led me to make some observations at table the next morning,"
5203,CHAPTER VIII,which I here repeat for the benefit of the readers of this record.
5204,CHAPTER VIII,
5205,CHAPTER VIII,--The hat is the vulnerable point of the artificial integument.  I
5206,CHAPTER VIII,learned this in early boyhood.  I was once equipped in a hat of Leghorn
5207,CHAPTER VIII,"straw, having a brim of much wider dimensions than were usual at that"
5208,CHAPTER VIII,"time, and sent to school in that portion of my native town which lies"
5209,CHAPTER VIII,"nearest to this metropolis.  On my way I was met by a ""Port-chuck,"" as we"
5210,CHAPTER VIII,"used to call the young gentlemen of that locality, and the following"
5211,CHAPTER VIII,dialogue ensued.
5212,CHAPTER VIII,
5213,CHAPTER VIII,[Picture: The Port-chuck]
5214,CHAPTER VIII,
5215,CHAPTER VIII,"_The Port-chuck_.  Hullo, You-sir, joo know th' wuz gon-to be a race"
5216,CHAPTER VIII,to-morrah?
5217,CHAPTER VIII,
5218,CHAPTER VIII,"_Myself_.  No.  Who's gon-to run, 'n' wher's't gon-to be?"
5219,CHAPTER VIII,
5220,CHAPTER VIII,"_The Port-chuck_.  Squire Mico 'n' Doctor Wiliams, round the brim o' your"
5221,CHAPTER VIII,hat.
5222,CHAPTER VIII,
5223,CHAPTER VIII,These two much-respected gentlemen being the oldest inhabitants at that
5224,CHAPTER VIII,"time, and the alleged race-course being out of the question, the"
5225,CHAPTER VIII,"Port-chuck also winking and thrusting his tongue into his cheek, I"
5226,CHAPTER VIII,"perceived that I had been trifled with, and the effect has been to make"
5227,CHAPTER VIII,me sensitive and observant respecting this article of dress ever since.
5228,CHAPTER VIII,Here is an axiom or two relating to it.
5229,CHAPTER VIII,
5230,CHAPTER VIII,"A hat which has been _popped_, or exploded by being sat down upon, is"
5231,CHAPTER VIII,never itself again afterwards.
5232,CHAPTER VIII,
5233,CHAPTER VIII,It is a favorite illusion of sanguine natures to believe the contrary.
5234,CHAPTER VIII,
5235,CHAPTER VIII,Shabby gentility has nothing so characteristic as its hat.  There is
5236,CHAPTER VIII,"always an unnatural calmness about its nap, and an unwholesome gloss,"
5237,CHAPTER VIII,suggestive of a wet brush.
5238,CHAPTER VIII,
5239,CHAPTER VIII,The last effort of decayed fortune is expended in smoothing its
5240,CHAPTER VIII,dilapidated castor.  The hat is the _ultimum moriens_ of
5241,CHAPTER VIII,"""respectability."""
5242,CHAPTER VIII,
5243,CHAPTER VIII,"--The old gentleman took all these remarks and maxims very pleasantly,"
5244,CHAPTER VIII,"saying, however, that he had forgotten most of his French except the word"
5245,CHAPTER VIII,"for potatoes,--_pummies de tare_.--_Ultimum moriens_, I told him, is old"
5246,CHAPTER VIII,"Italian, and signifies _last thing to die_.  With this explanation he was"
5247,CHAPTER VIII,"well contented, and looked quite calm when I saw him afterwards in the"
5248,CHAPTER VIII,entry with a black hat on his head and the white one in his hand.

5251,CHAPTER VIII,
5252,CHAPTER VIII,--I think myself fortunate in having the Poet and the Professor for my
5253,CHAPTER VIII,"intimates.  We are so much together, that we no doubt think and talk a"
5254,CHAPTER VIII,good deal alike; yet our points of view are in many respects individual
5255,CHAPTER VIII,and peculiar.  You know me well enough by this time.  I have not talked
5256,CHAPTER VIII,with you so long for nothing and therefore I don't think it necessary to
5257,CHAPTER VIII,draw my own portrait.  But let me say a word or two about my friends.
5258,CHAPTER VIII,
5259,CHAPTER VIII,"The Professor considers himself, and I consider him, a very useful and"
5260,CHAPTER VIII,worthy kind of drudge.  I think he has a pride in his small
5261,CHAPTER VIII,technicalities.  I know that he has a great idea of fidelity; and though
5262,CHAPTER VIII,I suspect he laughs a little inwardly at times at the grand airs
5263,CHAPTER VIII,"""Science"" puts on, as she stands marking time, but not getting on, while"
5264,CHAPTER VIII,"the trumpets are blowing and the big drums beating,--yet I am sure he has"
5265,CHAPTER VIII,"a liking for his specially, and a respect for its cultivators."
5266,CHAPTER VIII,
5267,CHAPTER VIII,But I'll tell you what the Professor said to the Poet the other day.--My
5268,CHAPTER VIII,"boy, said he, I can work a great deal cheaper than you, because I keep"
5269,CHAPTER VIII,all my goods in the lower story.  You have to hoist yours into the upper
5270,CHAPTER VIII,"chambers of the brain, and let them down again to your customers.  I take"
5271,CHAPTER VIII,"mine in at the level of the ground, and send them off from my doorstep"
5272,CHAPTER VIII,"almost without lifting.  I tell you, the higher a man has to carry the"
5273,CHAPTER VIII,"raw material of thought before he works it up, the more it costs him in"
5274,CHAPTER VIII,"blood, nerve, and muscle.  Coleridge knew all this very well when he"
5275,CHAPTER VIII,advised every literary man to have a profession.
5276,CHAPTER VIII,
5277,CHAPTER VIII,"--Sometimes I like to talk with one of them, and sometimes with the"
5278,CHAPTER VIII,other.  After a while I get tired of both.  When a fit of intellectual
5279,CHAPTER VIII,"disgust comes over me, I will tell you what I have found admirable as a"
5280,CHAPTER VIII,"diversion, in addition to boating and other amusements which I have"
5281,CHAPTER VIII,"spoken of,--that is, working at my carpenter's-bench.  Some mechanical"
5282,CHAPTER VIII,"employment is the greatest possible relief, after the purely intellectual"
5283,CHAPTER VIII,"faculties begin to tire.  When I was quarantined once at Marseilles, I"
5284,CHAPTER VIII,got to work immediately at carving a wooden wonder of loose rings on a
5285,CHAPTER VIII,"stick, and got so interested in it, that when we were set loose, I"
5286,CHAPTER VIII,"""regained my freedom with a sigh,"" because my toy was unfinished."
5287,CHAPTER VIII,
5288,CHAPTER VIII,"There are long seasons when I talk only with the Professor, and others"
5289,CHAPTER VIII,when I give myself wholly up to the Poet.  Now that my winter's work is
5290,CHAPTER VIII,"over and spring is with us, I feel naturally drawn to the Poet's company."
5291,CHAPTER VIII,I don't know anybody more alive to life than he is.  The passion of
5292,CHAPTER VIII,"poetry seizes on him every spring, he says,--yet oftentimes he complains,"
5293,CHAPTER VIII,"that, when he feels most, he can sing least."
5294,CHAPTER VIII,
5295,CHAPTER VIII,"Then a fit of despondency comes over him.--I feel ashamed,"
5296,CHAPTER VIII,"sometimes,--said he, the other day,--to think how far my worst songs fall"
5297,CHAPTER VIII,"below my best.  It sometimes seems to me, as I know it does to others who"
5298,CHAPTER VIII,"have told me so, that they ought to be _all best_,--if not in actual"
5299,CHAPTER VIII,"execution, at least in plan and motive.  I am grateful--he continued--for"
5300,CHAPTER VIII,all such criticisms.  A man is always pleased to have his most serious
5301,CHAPTER VIII,"efforts praised, and the highest aspect of his nature get the most"
5302,CHAPTER VIII,sunshine.
5303,CHAPTER VIII,
5304,CHAPTER VIII,"Yet I am sure, that, in the nature of things, many minds must change"
5305,CHAPTER VIII,"their key now and then, on penalty of getting out of tune or losing their"
5306,CHAPTER VIII,"voices.  You know, I suppose,--he said,--what is meant by complementary"
5307,CHAPTER VIII,"colors?  You know the effect, too, which the prolonged impression of any"
5308,CHAPTER VIII,one color has on the retina.  If you close your eyes after looking
5309,CHAPTER VIII,"steadily at a _red_ object, you see a _green_ image."
5310,CHAPTER VIII,
5311,CHAPTER VIII,"It is so with many minds,--I will not say with all.  After looking at one"
5312,CHAPTER VIII,"aspect of external nature, or of any form of beauty or truth, when they"
5313,CHAPTER VIII,"turn away, the _complementary_ aspect of the same object stamps itself"
5314,CHAPTER VIII,irresistibly and automatically upon the mind.  Shall they give expression
5315,CHAPTER VIII,"to this secondary mental state, or not?"
5316,CHAPTER VIII,
5317,CHAPTER VIII,"When I contemplate--said my friend, the Poet--the infinite largeness of"
5318,CHAPTER VIII,"comprehension belonging to the Central Intelligence, how remote the"
5319,CHAPTER VIII,"creative conception is from all scholastic and ethical formulae, I am led"
5320,CHAPTER VIII,"to think that a healthy mind ought to change its mood from time to time,"
5321,CHAPTER VIII,"and come down from its noblest condition,--never, of course, to degrade"
5322,CHAPTER VIII,"itself by dwelling upon what is itself debasing, but to let its lower"
5323,CHAPTER VIII,faculties have a chance to air and exercise themselves.  After the first
5324,CHAPTER VIII,and second floor have been out in the bright street dressed in all their
5325,CHAPTER VIII,"splendors, shall not our humble friends in the basement have their"
5326,CHAPTER VIII,"holiday, and the cotton velvet and the thin-skinned jewelry--simple"
5327,CHAPTER VIII,"adornments, but befitting the station of those who wear them--show"
5328,CHAPTER VIII,"themselves to the crowd, who think them beautiful, as they ought to,"
5329,CHAPTER VIII,though the people up stairs know that they are cheap and perishable?
5330,CHAPTER VIII,
5331,CHAPTER VIII,"--I don't know that I may not bring the Poet here, some day or other, and"
5332,CHAPTER VIII,let him speak for himself.  Still I think I can tell you what he says
5333,CHAPTER VIII,"quite as well as he could do it.--Oh,--he said to me, one day,--I am but"
5334,CHAPTER VIII,"a hand-organ man,--say rather, a hand-organ.  Life turns the winch, and"
5335,CHAPTER VIII,"fancy or accident pulls out the stops.  I come under your windows, some"
5336,CHAPTER VIII,"fine spring morning, and play you one of my _adagio_ movements, and some"
5337,CHAPTER VIII,"of you say,--This is good,--play us so always.  But, dear friends, if I"
5338,CHAPTER VIII,"did not change the stop sometimes, the machine would wear out in one part"
5339,CHAPTER VIII,and rust in another.  How easily this or that tune flows!--you
5340,CHAPTER VIII,"say,--there must be no end of just such melodies in him.--I will open the"
5341,CHAPTER VIII,"poor machine for you one moment, and you shall look.--Ah!  Every note"
5342,CHAPTER VIII,marks where a spur of steel has been driven in.  It is easy to grind out
5343,CHAPTER VIII,"the song, but to plant these bristling points which make it was the"
5344,CHAPTER VIII,painful task of time.
5345,CHAPTER VIII,
5346,CHAPTER VIII,"I don't like to say it,--he continued,--but poets commonly have no larger"
5347,CHAPTER VIII,stock of tunes than hand-organs; and when you hear them piping up under
5348,CHAPTER VIII,"your window, you know pretty well what to expect.  The more stops, the"
5349,CHAPTER VIII,better.  Do let them all be pulled out in their turn!
5350,CHAPTER VIII,
5351,CHAPTER VIII,"So spoke my friend, the Poet, and read me one of his stateliest songs,"
5352,CHAPTER VIII,"and after it a gay _chanson_, and then a string of epigrams.  All"
5353,CHAPTER VIII,"true,--he said,--all flowers of his soul; only one with the corolla"
5354,CHAPTER VIII,"spread, and another with its disk half opened, and the third with the"
5355,CHAPTER VIII,heart-leaves covered up and only a petal or two showing its tip through
5356,CHAPTER VIII,"the calyx.  The water-lily is the type of the poet's soul,--he told me."
5357,CHAPTER VIII,
5358,CHAPTER VIII,"--What do you think, Sir,--said the divinity-student,--opens the souls of"
5359,CHAPTER VIII,poets most fully?
5360,CHAPTER VIII,
5361,CHAPTER VIII,"Why, there must be the internal force and the external stimulus.  Neither"
5362,CHAPTER VIII,"is enough by itself.  A rose will not flower in the dark, and a fern will"
5363,CHAPTER VIII,not flower anywhere.
5364,CHAPTER VIII,
5365,CHAPTER VIII,What do I think is the true sunshine that opens the poet's corolla?--I
5366,CHAPTER VIII,"don't like to say.  They spoil a good many, I am afraid; or at least they"
5367,CHAPTER VIII,shine on a good many that never come to anything.
5368,CHAPTER VIII,
5369,CHAPTER VIII,Who are _they_?--said the schoolmistress.
5370,CHAPTER VIII,
5371,CHAPTER VIII,"Women.  Their love first inspires the poet, and their praise is his best"
5372,CHAPTER VIII,reward.
5373,CHAPTER VIII,
5374,CHAPTER VIII,"The schoolmistress reddened a little, but looked pleased.--Did I really"
5375,CHAPTER VIII,think so?--I do think so; I never feel safe until I have pleased them; I
5376,CHAPTER VIII,"don't think they are the first to see one's defects, but they are the"
5377,CHAPTER VIII,first to catch the color and fragrance of a true poem.  Fit the same
5378,CHAPTER VIII,"intellect to a man and it is a bow-string,--to a woman and it is a"
5379,CHAPTER VIII,"harp-string.  She is vibratile and resonant all over, so she stirs with"
5380,CHAPTER VIII,"slighter musical tremblings of the air about her.--Ah, me!--said my"
5381,CHAPTER VIII,"friend, the Poet, to me, the other day,--what color would it not have"
5382,CHAPTER VIII,"given to my thoughts, and what thrice-washed whiteness to my words, had I"
5383,CHAPTER VIII,"been fed on women's praises!  I should have grown like Marvell's fawn,--"
5384,CHAPTER VIII,
5385,CHAPTER VIII,"""Lilies without; roses within!"""
5386,CHAPTER VIII,
5387,CHAPTER VIII,"But then,--he added,--we all think, _if_ so and so, we should have been"
5388,CHAPTER VIII,"this or that, as you were saying the other day, in those rhymes of yours."
5389,CHAPTER VIII,
5390,CHAPTER VIII,--I don't think there are many poets in the sense of creators; but of
5391,CHAPTER VIII,those sensitive natures which reflect themselves naturally in soft and
5392,CHAPTER VIII,"melodious words, pleading for sympathy with their joys and sorrows, every"
5393,CHAPTER VIII,literature is full.  Nature carves with her own hands the brain which
5394,CHAPTER VIII,"holds the creative imagination, but she casts the over-sensitive"
5395,CHAPTER VIII,creatures in scores from the same mould.
5396,CHAPTER VIII,
5397,CHAPTER VIII,"There are two kinds of poets, just as there are two kinds of blondes."
5398,CHAPTER VIII,[Movement of curiosity among our ladies at table.--Please to tell us
5399,CHAPTER VIII,"about those blondes, said the schoolmistress.]  Why, there are blondes"
5400,CHAPTER VIII,"who are such simply by deficiency of coloring matter,--_negative_ or"
5401,CHAPTER VIII,"_washed_ blondes, arrested by Nature on the way to become albinesses."
5402,CHAPTER VIII,"There are others that are shot through with golden light, with tawny or"
5403,CHAPTER VIII,"fulvous tinges in various degree,--_positive_ or _stained_ blondes,"
5404,CHAPTER VIII,"dipped in yellow sunbeams, and as unlike in their mode of being to the"
5405,CHAPTER VIII,others as an orange is unlike a snowball.  The albino-style carries with
5406,CHAPTER VIII,"it a wide pupil and a sensitive retina.  The other, or the leonine"
5407,CHAPTER VIII,"blonde, has an opaline fire in her clear eye, which the brunette can"
5408,CHAPTER VIII,hardly match with her quick glittering glances.
5409,CHAPTER VIII,
5410,CHAPTER VIII,"Just so we have the great sun-kindled, constructive imaginations, and a"
5411,CHAPTER VIII,far more numerous class of poets who have a certain kind of
5412,CHAPTER VIII,moonlight-genius given them to compensate for their imperfection of
5413,CHAPTER VIII,nature.  Their want of mental coloring-matter makes them sensitive to
5414,CHAPTER VIII,those impressions which stronger minds neglect or never feel at all.
5415,CHAPTER VIII,"Many of them die young, and all of them are tinged with melancholy."
5416,CHAPTER VIII,There is no more beautiful illustration of the principle of compensation
5417,CHAPTER VIII,which marks the Divine benevolence than the fact that some of the holiest
5418,CHAPTER VIII,lives and some of the sweetest songs are the growth of the infirmity
5419,CHAPTER VIII,which unfits its subject for the rougher duties of life.  When one reads
5420,CHAPTER VIII,"the life of Cowper, or of Keats, or of Lucretia and Margaret"
5421,CHAPTER VIII,"Davidson,--of so many gentle, sweet natures, born to weakness, and mostly"
5422,CHAPTER VIII,"dying before their time,--one cannot help thinking that the human race"
5423,CHAPTER VIII,"dies out singing, like the swan in the old story.  The French poet,"
5424,CHAPTER VIII,"Gilbert, who died at the Hotel Dieu, at the age of twenty-nine,--(killed"
5425,CHAPTER VIII,"by a key in his throat, which he had swallowed when delirious in"
5426,CHAPTER VIII,"consequence of a fall,)--this poor fellow was a very good example of the"
5427,CHAPTER VIII,"poet by excess of sensibility.  I found, the other day, that some of my"
5428,CHAPTER VIII,"literary friends had never heard of him, though I suppose few educated"
5429,CHAPTER VIII,"Frenchmen do not know the lines which he wrote, a week before his death,"
5430,CHAPTER VIII,upon a mean bed in the great hospital of Paris.
5431,CHAPTER VIII,
5432,CHAPTER VIII,"""Au banquet de la vie, infortune convive,"
5433,CHAPTER VIII,"J'apparus un jour, et je meurs;"
5434,CHAPTER VIII,"Je meurs, et sur ma tombe, ou lentement j'arrive,"
5435,CHAPTER VIII,"Nul ne viendra verser des pleurs."""
5436,CHAPTER VIII,
5437,CHAPTER VIII,"At life's gay banquet placed, a poor unhappy guest,"
5438,CHAPTER VIII,"One day I pass, then disappear;"
5439,CHAPTER VIII,"I die, and on the tomb where I at length shall rest"
5440,CHAPTER VIII,No friend shall come to shed a tear.
5441,CHAPTER VIII,
5442,CHAPTER VIII,You remember the same thing in other words some where in Kirke White's
5443,CHAPTER VIII,poems.  It is the burden of the plaintive songs of all these sweet
5444,CHAPTER VIII,"albino-poets.  ""I shall die and be forgotten, and the world will go on"
5445,CHAPTER VIII,just as if I had never been;--and yet how I have loved! how I have
5446,CHAPTER VIII,"longed! how I have aspired!""  And so singing, their eyes grow brighter"
5447,CHAPTER VIII,"and brighter, and their features thinner and thinner, until at last the"
5448,CHAPTER VIII,"veil of flesh is threadbare, and, still singing, they drop it and pass"
5449,CHAPTER VIII,onward.
5450,CHAPTER VIII,
5451,CHAPTER VIII,* * * * *
5452,CHAPTER VIII,
5453,CHAPTER VIII,--Our brains are seventy-year clocks.  The Angel of Life winds them up
5454,CHAPTER VIII,"once for all, then closes the case, and gives the key into the hand of"
5455,CHAPTER VIII,the Angel of the Resurrection.
5456,CHAPTER VIII,
5457,CHAPTER VIII,Tic-tac! tic-tac! go the wheels of thought; our will cannot stop them;
5458,CHAPTER VIII,"they cannot stop themselves, sleep cannot still them; madness only makes"
5459,CHAPTER VIII,"them go faster; death alone can break into the case, and, seizing the"
5460,CHAPTER VIII,"ever-swinging pendulum, which we call the heart, silence at last the"
5461,CHAPTER VIII,clicking of the terrible escapement we have carried so long beneath our
5462,CHAPTER VIII,wrinkled foreheads.
5463,CHAPTER VIII,
5464,CHAPTER VIII,"If we could only get at them, as we lie on our pillows and count the dead"
5465,CHAPTER VIII,beats of thought after thought and image after image jarring through the
5466,CHAPTER VIII,"overtired organ!  Will nobody block those wheels, uncouple that pinion,"
5467,CHAPTER VIII,"cut the string that holds those weights, blow up the infernal machine"
5468,CHAPTER VIII,with gunpowder?  What a passion comes over us sometimes for silence and
5469,CHAPTER VIII,"rest!--that this dreadful mechanism, unwinding the endless tapestry of"
5470,CHAPTER VIII,"time, embroidered with spectral figures of life and death, could have but"
5471,CHAPTER VIII,one brief holiday!  Who can wonder that men swing themselves off from
5472,CHAPTER VIII,beams in hempen lassos?--that they jump off from parapets into the swift
5473,CHAPTER VIII,and gurgling waters beneath?--that they take counsel of the grim friend
5474,CHAPTER VIII,who has but to utter his one peremptory monosyllable and the restless
5475,CHAPTER VIII,machine is shivered as a vase that is dashed upon a marble floor?  Under
5476,CHAPTER VIII,"that building which we pass every day there are strong dungeons, where"
5477,CHAPTER VIII,"neither hook, nor bar, nor bed-cord, nor drinking-vessel from which a"
5478,CHAPTER VIII,"sharp fragment may be shattered, shall by any chance be seen.  There is"
5479,CHAPTER VIII,"nothing for it, when the brain is on fire with the whirling of its"
5480,CHAPTER VIII,"wheels, but to spring against the stone wall and silence them with one"
5481,CHAPTER VIII,"crash.  Ah, they remembered that,--the kind city fathers,--and the walls"
5482,CHAPTER VIII,"are nicely padded, so that one can take such exercise as he likes without"
5483,CHAPTER VIII,damaging himself on the very plain and serviceable upholstery.  If
5484,CHAPTER VIII,anybody would only contrive some kind of a lever that one could thrust in
5485,CHAPTER VIII,"among the works of this horrid automaton and check them, or alter their"
5486,CHAPTER VIII,"rate of going, what would the world give for the discovery?"
5487,CHAPTER VIII,
5488,CHAPTER VIII,"--From half a dime to a dime, according to the style of the place and the"
5489,CHAPTER VIII,"quality of the liquor,--said the young fellow whom they call John."
5490,CHAPTER VIII,
5491,CHAPTER VIII,"You speak trivially, but not unwisely,--I said.  Unless the will maintain"
5492,CHAPTER VIII,"a certain control over these movements, which it cannot stop, but can to"
5493,CHAPTER VIII,"some extent regulate, men are very apt to try to get at the machine by"
5494,CHAPTER VIII,some indirect system of leverage or other.  They clap on the brakes by
5495,CHAPTER VIII,means of opium; they change the maddening monotony of the rhythm by means
5496,CHAPTER VIII,of fermented liquors.  It is because the brain is locked up and we cannot
5497,CHAPTER VIII,"touch its movement directly, that we thrust these coarse tools in through"
5498,CHAPTER VIII,"any crevice, by which they may reach the interior, and so alter its rate"
5499,CHAPTER VIII,"of going for a while, and at last spoil the machine."
5500,CHAPTER VIII,
5501,CHAPTER VIII,Men who exercise chiefly those faculties of the mind which work
5502,CHAPTER VIII,"independently of the will,--poets and artists, for instance, who follow"
5503,CHAPTER VIII,"their imagination in their creative moments, instead of keeping it in"
5504,CHAPTER VIII,hand as your logicians and practical men do with their reasoning
5505,CHAPTER VIII,"faculty,--such men are too apt to call in the mechanical appliances to"
5506,CHAPTER VIII,help them govern their intellects.
5507,CHAPTER VIII,
5508,CHAPTER VIII,"--He means they get drunk,--said the young fellow already alluded to by"
5509,CHAPTER VIII,name.
5510,CHAPTER VIII,
5511,CHAPTER VIII,Do you think men of true genius are apt to indulge in the use of
5512,CHAPTER VIII,inebriating fluids? said the divinity-student.
5513,CHAPTER VIII,
5514,CHAPTER VIII,"If you think you are strong enough to bear what I am going to say,--I"
5515,CHAPTER VIII,"replied,--I will talk to you about this.  But mind, now, these are the"
5516,CHAPTER VIII,"things that some foolish people call _dangerous_ subjects,--as if these"
5517,CHAPTER VIII,"vices which burrow into people's souls, as the Guinea-worm burrows into"
5518,CHAPTER VIII,"the naked feet of West-Indian slaves, would be more mischievous when seen"
5519,CHAPTER VIII,than out of sight.  Now the true way to deal with those obstinate
5520,CHAPTER VIII,"animals, which are a dozen feet long, some of them, and no bigger than a"
5521,CHAPTER VIII,"horse hair, is to get a piece of silk round their _heads_, and pull them"
5522,CHAPTER VIII,"out very cautiously.  If you only break them off, they grow worse than"
5523,CHAPTER VIII,"ever, and sometimes kill the person who has the misfortune to harbor one"
5524,CHAPTER VIII,of them.  Whence it is plain that the first thing to do is to find out
5525,CHAPTER VIII,where the head lies.
5526,CHAPTER VIII,
5527,CHAPTER VIII,"Just so of all the vices, and particularly of this vice of intemperance."
5528,CHAPTER VIII,"What is the head of it, and where does it lie?  For you may depend upon"
5529,CHAPTER VIII,"it, there is not one of these vices that has not a head of its own,--an"
5530,CHAPTER VIII,"intelligence,--a meaning,--a certain virtue, I was going to say,--but"
5531,CHAPTER VIII,"that might, perhaps, sound paradoxical.  I have heard an immense number"
5532,CHAPTER VIII,"of moral physicians lay down the treatment of moral Guinea-worms, and the"
5533,CHAPTER VIII,vast majority of them would always insist that the creature had no head
5534,CHAPTER VIII,"at all, but was all body and tail.  So I have found a very common result"
5535,CHAPTER VIII,"of their method to be that the string slipped, or that a piece only of"
5536,CHAPTER VIII,"the creature was broken off, and the worm soon grew again, as bad as"
5537,CHAPTER VIII,"ever.  The truth is, if the Devil could only appear in church by"
5538,CHAPTER VIII,"attorney, and make the best statement that the facts would bear him out"
5539,CHAPTER VIII,"in doing on behalf of his special virtues, (what we commonly call vices,)"
5540,CHAPTER VIII,the influence of good teachers would be much greater than it is.  For the
5541,CHAPTER VIII,arguments by which the Devil prevails are precisely the ones that the
5542,CHAPTER VIII,Devil-queller most rarely answers.  The way to argue down a vice is not
5543,CHAPTER VIII,"to tell lies about it,--to say that it has no attractions, when everybody"
5544,CHAPTER VIII,"knows that it has,--but rather to let it make out its case just as it"
5545,CHAPTER VIII,"certainly will in the moment of temptation, and then meet it with the"
5546,CHAPTER VIII,weapons furnished by the Divine armory.  Ithuriel did not spit the toad
5547,CHAPTER VIII,"on his spear, you remember, but touched him with it, and the blasted"
5548,CHAPTER VIII,angel took the sad glories of his true shape.  If he had shown fight
5549,CHAPTER VIII,"then, the fair spirits would have known how to deal with him."
5550,CHAPTER VIII,
5551,CHAPTER VIII,That all spasmodic cerebral action is an evil is not perfectly clear.
5552,CHAPTER VIII,"Men get fairly intoxicated with music, with poetry, with religious"
5553,CHAPTER VIII,"excitement, oftenest with love.  Ninon de l'Enclos said she was so easily"
5554,CHAPTER VIII,"excited that her soup intoxicated her, and convalescents have been made"
5555,CHAPTER VIII,tipsy by a beef-steak.
5556,CHAPTER VIII,
5557,CHAPTER VIII,"There are forms and stages of alcoholic exaltation which, in themselves,"
5558,CHAPTER VIII,"and without regard to their consequences, might be considered as positive"
5559,CHAPTER VIII,improvements of the persons affected.  When the sluggish intellect is
5560,CHAPTER VIII,"roused, the slow speech quickened, the cold nature warmed, the latent"
5561,CHAPTER VIII,"sympathy developed, the flagging spirit kindled,--before the trains of"
5562,CHAPTER VIII,"thought become confused or the will perverted, or the muscles"
5563,CHAPTER VIII,"relaxed,--just at the moment when the whole human zoophyte flowers out"
5564,CHAPTER VIII,"like a full-blown rose, and is ripe for the subscription-paper or the"
5565,CHAPTER VIII,"contribution-box,--it would be hard to say that a man was, at that very"
5566,CHAPTER VIII,"time, worse, or less to be loved, than when driving a hard bargain with"
5567,CHAPTER VIII,"all his meaner wits about him.  The difficulty is, that the alcoholic"
5568,CHAPTER VIII,"virtues don't wash; but until the water takes their colors out, the tints"
5569,CHAPTER VIII,are very much like those of the true celestial stuff.
5570,CHAPTER VIII,
5571,CHAPTER VIII,[Here I was interrupted by a question which I am very unwilling to
5572,CHAPTER VIII,"report, but have confidence enough in those friends who examine these"
5573,CHAPTER VIII,records to commit to their candor.
5574,CHAPTER VIII,
5575,CHAPTER VIII,"_A person_ at table asked me whether I ""went in for rum as a steady"
5576,CHAPTER VIII,"drink?""--His manner made the question highly offensive, but I restrained"
5577,CHAPTER VIII,"myself, and answered thus:--]"
5578,CHAPTER VIII,
5579,CHAPTER VIII,Rum I take to be the name which unwashed moralists apply alike to the
5580,CHAPTER VIII,product distilled from molasses and the noblest juices of the vineyard.
5581,CHAPTER VIII,"Burgundy ""in all its sunset glow"" is rum.  Champagne, ""the foaming wine"
5582,CHAPTER VIII,"of Eastern France,"" in rum.  Hock, which our friend, the Poet, speaks of"
5583,CHAPTER VIII,as
5584,CHAPTER VIII,
5585,CHAPTER VIII,"""The Rhine's breastmilk, gushing cold and bright,"
5586,CHAPTER VIII,"Pale as the moon, and maddening as her light,"""
5587,CHAPTER VIII,
5588,CHAPTER VIII,"is rum.  Sir, I repudiate the loathsome vulgarism as an insult to the"
5589,CHAPTER VIII,first miracle wrought by the Founder of our religion!  I address myself
5590,CHAPTER VIII,"to the company.--I believe in temperance, nay, almost in abstinence, as a"
5591,CHAPTER VIII,rule for healthy people.  I trust that I practice both.  But let me tell
5592,CHAPTER VIII,"you, there are companies of men of genius into which I sometimes go,"
5593,CHAPTER VIII,where the atmosphere of intellect and sentiment is so much more
5594,CHAPTER VIII,"stimulating than alcohol, that, if I thought fit to take wine, it would"
5595,CHAPTER VIII,be to keep me sober.
5596,CHAPTER VIII,
5597,CHAPTER VIII,"Among the gentlemen that I have known, few, if any, were ruined by"
5598,CHAPTER VIII,drinking.  My few drunken acquaintances were generally ruined before they
5599,CHAPTER VIII,"became drunkards.  The habit of drinking is often a vice, no"
5600,CHAPTER VIII,"doubt,--sometimes a misfortune,--as when an almost irresistible"
5601,CHAPTER VIII,"hereditary propensity exists to indulge in it,--but oftenest of all a"
5602,CHAPTER VIII,_punishment_.
5603,CHAPTER VIII,
5604,CHAPTER VIII,"Empty heads,--heads without ideas in wholesome variety and sufficient"
5605,CHAPTER VIII,"number to furnish food for the mental clockwork,--ill-regulated heads,"
5606,CHAPTER VIII,"where the faculties are not under the control of the will,--these are the"
5607,CHAPTER VIII,"ones that hold the brains which their owners are so apt to tamper with,"
5608,CHAPTER VIII,"by introducing the appliances we have been talking about.  Now, when a"
5609,CHAPTER VIII,"gentleman's brain is empty or ill-regulated, it is, to a great extent,"
5610,CHAPTER VIII,"his own fault; and so it is simple retribution, that, while he lies"
5611,CHAPTER VIII,"slothfully sleeping or aimlessly dreaming, the fatal habit settles on him"
5612,CHAPTER VIII,"like a vampyre, and sucks his blood, fanning him all the while with its"
5613,CHAPTER VIII,hot wings into deeper slumber or idler dreams!  I am not such a
5614,CHAPTER VIII,"hard-souled being as to apply this to the neglected poor, who have had no"
5615,CHAPTER VIII,"chance to fill their heads with wholesome ideas, and to be taught the"
5616,CHAPTER VIII,lesson of self-government.  I trust the tariff of Heaven has an _ad
5617,CHAPTER VIII,valorem_ scale for them--and all of us.
5618,CHAPTER VIII,
5619,CHAPTER VIII,But to come back to poets and artists;--if they really are more prone to
5620,CHAPTER VIII,"the abuse of stimulants,--and I fear that this is true,--the reason of it"
5621,CHAPTER VIII,"is only too clear.  A man abandons himself to a fine frenzy, and the"
5622,CHAPTER VIII,"power which flows through him, as I once explained to you, makes him the"
5623,CHAPTER VIII,medium of a great poem or a great picture.  The creative action is not
5624,CHAPTER VIII,"voluntary at all, but automatic; we can only put the mind into the proper"
5625,CHAPTER VIII,"attitude, and wait for the wind, that blows where it listeth, to breathe"
5626,CHAPTER VIII,"over it.  Thus the true state of creative genius is allied to _reverie_,"
5627,CHAPTER VIII,or dreaming.  If mind and body were both healthy and had food enough and
5628,CHAPTER VIII,"fair play, I doubt whether any men would be more temperate than the"
5629,CHAPTER VIII,"imaginative classes.  But body and mind often flag,--perhaps they are"
5630,CHAPTER VIII,"ill-made to begin with, underfed with bread or ideas, overworked, or"
5631,CHAPTER VIII,"abused in some way.  The automatic action, by which genius wrought its"
5632,CHAPTER VIII,"wonders, fails.  There is only one thing which can rouse the machine; not"
5633,CHAPTER VIII,"will,--that cannot reach it; nothing but a ruinous agent, which hurries"
5634,CHAPTER VIII,the wheels awhile and soon eats out the heart of the mechanism.  The
5635,CHAPTER VIII,"dreaming faculties are always the dangerous ones, because their mode of"
5636,CHAPTER VIII,action can be imitated by artificial excitement; the reasoning ones are
5637,CHAPTER VIII,"safe, because they imply continued voluntary effort."
5638,CHAPTER VIII,
5639,CHAPTER VIII,"I think you will find it true, that, before any vice can fasten on a man,"
5640,CHAPTER VIII,"body, mind, or moral nature must be debilitated.  The mosses and fungi"
5641,CHAPTER VIII,"gather on sickly trees, not thriving ones; and the odious parasites which"
5642,CHAPTER VIII,fasten on the human frame choose that which is already enfeebled.  Mr.
5643,CHAPTER VIII,"Walker, the hygeian humorist, declared that he had such a healthy skin it"
5644,CHAPTER VIII,"was impossible for any impurity to stick to it, and maintained that it"
5645,CHAPTER VIII,was an absurdity to wash a face which was of necessity always clean.  I
5646,CHAPTER VIII,don't know how much fancy there was in this; but there is no fancy in
5647,CHAPTER VIII,"saying that the lassitude of tired-out operatives, and the languor of"
5648,CHAPTER VIII,"imaginative natures in their periods of collapse, and the vacuity of"
5649,CHAPTER VIII,"minds untrained to labor and discipline, fit the soul and body for the"
5650,CHAPTER VIII,germination of the seeds of intemperance.
5651,CHAPTER VIII,
5652,CHAPTER VIII,"Whenever the wandering demon of Drunkenness finds a ship adrift,--no"
5653,CHAPTER VIII,"steady wind in its sails, no thoughtful pilot directing its course,--he"
5654,CHAPTER VIII,"steps on board, takes the helm, and steers straight for the maelstrom."

5657,CHAPTER VIII,
5658,CHAPTER VIII,--I wonder if you know the _terrible smile_?  [The young fellow whom they
5659,CHAPTER VIII,"call John winked very hard, and made a jocular remark, the sense of which"
5660,CHAPTER VIII,seemed to depend on some double meaning of the word _smile_.  The company
5661,CHAPTER VIII,was curious to know what I meant.]
5662,CHAPTER VIII,
5663,CHAPTER VIII,There are persons--I said--who no sooner come within sight of you than
5664,CHAPTER VIII,"they begin to smile, with an uncertain movement of the mouth, which"
5665,CHAPTER VIII,"conveys the idea that they are thinking about themselves, and thinking,"
5666,CHAPTER VIII,"too, that you are thinking they are thinking about themselves,--and so"
5667,CHAPTER VIII,"look at you with a wretched mixture of self-consciousness, awkwardness,"
5668,CHAPTER VIII,"and attempts to carry off both, which are betrayed by the cowardly"
5669,CHAPTER VIII,behaviour of the eye and the tell-tale weakness of the lips that
5670,CHAPTER VIII,characterize these unfortunate beings.
5671,CHAPTER VIII,
5672,CHAPTER VIII,"--Why do you call them unfortunate, Sir?--asked the divinity-student."
5673,CHAPTER VIII,
5674,CHAPTER VIII,Because it is evident that the consciousness of some imbecility or other
5675,CHAPTER VIII,"is at the bottom of this extraordinary expression.  I don't think,"
5676,CHAPTER VIII,"however, that these persons are commonly fools.  I have known a number,"
5677,CHAPTER VIII,and all of them were intelligent.  I think nothing conveys the idea of
5678,CHAPTER VIII,_underbreeding_ more than this self-betraying smile.  Yet I think this
5679,CHAPTER VIII,peculiar habit as well as that of _meaningless blushing_ may be fallen
5680,CHAPTER VIII,"into by very good people who met often, or sit opposite each other at"
5681,CHAPTER VIII,table.  A true gentleman's face is infinitely removed from all such
5682,CHAPTER VIII,"paltriness,--calm-eyed, firm-mouthed.  I think Titian understood the look"
5683,CHAPTER VIII,of a gentleman as well as anybody that ever lived.  The portrait of a
5684,CHAPTER VIII,"young man holding a glove in his hand, in the Gallery of the Louvre, if"
5685,CHAPTER VIII,"any of you have seen that collection, will remind you of what I mean."
5686,CHAPTER VIII,
5687,CHAPTER VIII,--Do I think these people know the peculiar look they have?--I cannot
5688,CHAPTER VIII,"say; I hope not; I am afraid they would never forgive me, if they did."
5689,CHAPTER VIII,"The worst of it is, the trick is catching; when one meets one of these"
5690,CHAPTER VIII,"fellows, he feels a tendency to the same manifestation.  The Professor"
5691,CHAPTER VIII,"tells me there is a muscular slip, a dependence of the _platysma"
5692,CHAPTER VIII,"myoides_, which is called the _risorius Santorini_."
5693,CHAPTER VIII,
5694,CHAPTER VIII,"--Say that once more,--exclaimed the young fellow mentioned above."
5695,CHAPTER VIII,
5696,CHAPTER VIII,The Professor says there is a little fleshy slip called Santorini's
5697,CHAPTER VIII,"laughing muscle.  I would have it cut out of my face, if I were born with"
5698,CHAPTER VIII,one of those constitutional grins upon it.  Perhaps I am uncharitable in
5699,CHAPTER VIII,"my judgment of those sour-looking people I told you of the other day, and"
5700,CHAPTER VIII,"of these smiling folks.  It may be that they are born with these looks,"
5701,CHAPTER VIII,as other people are with more generally recognized deformities.  Both are
5702,CHAPTER VIII,"bad enough, but I had rather meet three of the scowlers than one of the"
5703,CHAPTER VIII,smilers.
5704,CHAPTER VIII,
5705,CHAPTER VIII,"--There is another unfortunate way of looking, which is peculiar to that"
5706,CHAPTER VIII,amiable sex we do not like to find fault with.  There are some very
5707,CHAPTER VIII,"pretty, but, unhappily, very ill-bred women, who don't understand the law"
5708,CHAPTER VIII,"of the road with regard to handsome faces.  Nature and custom would, no"
5709,CHAPTER VIII,"doubt, agree in conceding to all males the right of at least two distinct"
5710,CHAPTER VIII,"looks at every comely female countenance, without any infraction of the"
5711,CHAPTER VIII,rules of courtesy or the sentiment of respect.  The first look is
5712,CHAPTER VIII,necessary to define the person of the individual one meets so as to avoid
5713,CHAPTER VIII,it in passing.  Any unusual attraction detected in a first glance is a
5714,CHAPTER VIII,"sufficient apology for a second,--not a prolonged and impertinent stare,"
5715,CHAPTER VIII,"but an appreciating homage of the eyes, such as a stranger may"
5716,CHAPTER VIII,inoffensively yield to a passing image.  It is astonishing how morbidly
5717,CHAPTER VIII,sensitive some vulgar beauties are to the slightest demonstration of this
5718,CHAPTER VIII,"kind.  When a lady walks the streets, she leaves her virtuous-indignation"
5719,CHAPTER VIII,countenance at home; she knows well enough that the street is a
5720,CHAPTER VIII,"picture-gallery, where pretty faces framed in pretty bonnets are meant to"
5721,CHAPTER VIII,"be seen, and everybody has a right to see them."
5722,CHAPTER VIII,
5723,CHAPTER VIII,--When we observe how the same features and style of person and character
5724,CHAPTER VIII,"descend from generation to generation, we can believe that some inherited"
5725,CHAPTER VIII,weakness may account for these peculiarities.  Little snapping-turtles
5726,CHAPTER VIII,snap--so the great naturalist tells us--before they are out of the
5727,CHAPTER VIII,"egg-shell.  I am satisfied, that, much higher up in the scale of life,"
5728,CHAPTER VIII,character is distinctly shown at the age of -2 or -3 months.
5729,CHAPTER VIII,
5730,CHAPTER VIII,"--My friend, the Professor, has been full of eggs lately.  [This remark"
5731,CHAPTER VIII,excited a burst of hilarity which I did not allow to interrupt the course
5732,CHAPTER VIII,of my observations.]  He has been reading the great book where he found
5733,CHAPTER VIII,the fact about the little snapping-turtles mentioned above.  Some of the
5734,CHAPTER VIII,things he has told me have suggested several odd analogies enough.
5735,CHAPTER VIII,
5736,CHAPTER VIII,"There are half a dozen men, or so, who carry in their brains the _ovarian"
5737,CHAPTER VIII,eggs_ of the next generation's or century's civilization.  These eggs are
5738,CHAPTER VIII,not ready to be laid in the form of books as yet; some of them are hardly
5739,CHAPTER VIII,ready to be put into the form of talk.  But as rudimentary ideas or
5740,CHAPTER VIII,"inchoate tendencies, there they are; and these are what must form the"
5741,CHAPTER VIII,"future.  A man's general notions are not good for much, unless he has a"
5742,CHAPTER VIII,"crop of these intellectual ovarian eggs in his own brain, or knows them"
5743,CHAPTER VIII,as they exist in the minds of others.  One must be in the _habit_ of
5744,CHAPTER VIII,talking with such persons to get at these rudimentary germs of thought;
5745,CHAPTER VIII,"for their development is necessarily imperfect, and they are moulded on"
5746,CHAPTER VIII,"new patterns, which must be long and closely studied.  But these are the"
5747,CHAPTER VIII,men to talk with.  No fresh truth ever gets into a book.
5748,CHAPTER VIII,
5749,CHAPTER VIII,"--A good many fresh lies get in, anyhow,--said one of the company."
5750,CHAPTER VIII,
5751,CHAPTER VIII,"I proceeded in spite of the interruption.--All uttered thought, my"
5752,CHAPTER VIII,"friend, the Professor, says, is of the nature of an excretion.  Its"
5753,CHAPTER VIII,"materials have been taken in, and have acted upon the system, and been"
5754,CHAPTER VIII,reacted on by it; it has circulated and done its office in one mind
5755,CHAPTER VIII,before it is given out for the benefit of others.  It may be milk or
5756,CHAPTER VIII,"venom to other minds; but, in either case, it is something which the"
5757,CHAPTER VIII,producer has had the use of and can part with.  A man instinctively tries
5758,CHAPTER VIII,to get rid of his thought in conversation or in print so soon as it is
5759,CHAPTER VIII,"matured; but it is hard to get at it as it lies imbedded, a mere"
5760,CHAPTER VIII,"potentiality, the germ of a germ, in his intellect."
5761,CHAPTER VIII,
5762,CHAPTER VIII,--Where are the brains that are fullest of these ovarian eggs of
5763,CHAPTER VIII,"thought?--I decline mentioning individuals.  The producers of thought,"
5764,CHAPTER VIII,"who are few, the ""jobbers"" of thought, who are many, and the retailers of"
5765,CHAPTER VIII,"thought, who are numberless, are so mixed up in the popular apprehension,"
5766,CHAPTER VIII,that it would be hopeless to try to separate them before opinion has had
5767,CHAPTER VIII,time to settle.  Follow the course of opinion on the great subjects of
5768,CHAPTER VIII,"human interest for a few generations or centuries, get its parallax, map"
5769,CHAPTER VIII,"out a small arc of its movement, see where it tends, and then see who is"
5770,CHAPTER VIII,"in advance of it or even with it; the world calls him hard names,"
5771,CHAPTER VIII,"probably; but if you would find the _ova_ of the future, you must look"
5772,CHAPTER VIII,into the folds of his cerebral convolutions.
5773,CHAPTER VIII,
5774,CHAPTER VIII,"[The divinity-student looked a little puzzled at this suggestion, as if"
5775,CHAPTER VIII,"he did not see exactly where he was to come out, if he computed his arc"
5776,CHAPTER VIII,too nicely.  I think it possible it might cut off a few corners of his
5777,CHAPTER VIII,"present belief, as it has cut off martyr-burning and witch-hanging;--but"
5778,CHAPTER VIII,"time will show,--time will show, as the old gentleman opposite says.]"

5863,CHAPTER IX,
5864,CHAPTER IX,"If I should ever make a little book out of these papers, which I hope you"
5865,CHAPTER IX,"are not getting tired of, I suppose I ought to save the above sentence"
5866,CHAPTER IX,"for a motto on the title-page.  But I want it now, and must use it.  I"
5867,CHAPTER IX,"need not say to you that the words are Spanish, nor that they are to be"
5868,CHAPTER IX,"found in the short Introduction to ""Gil Blas,"" nor that they mean, ""Here"
5869,CHAPTER IX,"lies buried the soul of the licentiate Pedro Garcias."""
5870,CHAPTER IX,
5871,CHAPTER IX,I warned all young people off the premises when I began my notes
5872,CHAPTER IX,referring to old age.  I must be equally fair with old people now.  They
5873,CHAPTER IX,are earnestly requested to leave this paper to young persons from the age
5874,CHAPTER IX,"of twelve to that of fourscore years and ten, at which latter period of"
5875,CHAPTER IX,life I am sure that I shall have at least one youthful reader.  You know
5876,CHAPTER IX,"well enough what I mean by youth and age;--something in the soul, which"
5877,CHAPTER IX,has no more to do with the color of the hair than the vein of gold in a
5878,CHAPTER IX,rock has to do with the grass a thousand feet above it.
5879,CHAPTER IX,
5880,CHAPTER IX,"I am growing bolder as I write.  I think it requires not only youth, but"
5881,CHAPTER IX,"genius, to read this paper.  I don't mean to imply that it required any"
5882,CHAPTER IX,whatsoever to talk what I have here written down.  It did demand a
5883,CHAPTER IX,"certain amount of memory, and such command of the English tongue as is"
5884,CHAPTER IX,given by a common school education.  So much I do claim.  But here I have
5885,CHAPTER IX,"related, at length, a string of trivialities.  You must have the"
5886,CHAPTER IX,imagination of a poet to transfigure them.  These little colored patches
5887,CHAPTER IX,"are stains upon the windows of a human soul; stand on the outside, they"
5888,CHAPTER IX,"are but dull and meaningless spots of color; seen from within, they are"
5889,CHAPTER IX,glorified shapes with empurpled wings and sunbright aureoles.
5890,CHAPTER IX,
5891,CHAPTER IX,My hand trembles when I offer you this.  Many times I have come bearing
5892,CHAPTER IX,"flowers such as my garden grew; but now I offer you this poor, brown,"
5893,CHAPTER IX,"homely growth, you may cast it away as worthless.  And yet--and yet--it"
5894,CHAPTER IX,is something better than flowers; it is a _seed-capsule_.  Many a
5895,CHAPTER IX,"gardener will cut you a bouquet of his choicest blossoms for small fee,"
5896,CHAPTER IX,but he does not love to let the seeds of his rarest varieties go out of
5897,CHAPTER IX,his own hands.
5898,CHAPTER IX,
5899,CHAPTER IX,It is by little things that we know ourselves; a soul would very probably
5900,CHAPTER IX,"mistake itself for another, when once disembodied, were it not for"
5901,CHAPTER IX,individual experiences which differ from those of others only in details
5902,CHAPTER IX,"seemingly trifling.  All of us have been thirsty thousands of times, and"
5903,CHAPTER IX,"felt, with Pindar, that water was the best of things.  I alone, as I"
5904,CHAPTER IX,"think, of all mankind, remember one particular pailful of water, flavored"
5905,CHAPTER IX,"with the white-pine of which the pail was made, and the brown mug out of"
5906,CHAPTER IX,"which one Edmund, a red-faced and curly-haired boy, was averred to have"
5907,CHAPTER IX,"bitten a fragment in his haste to drink; it being then high summer, and"
5908,CHAPTER IX,little full-blooded boys feeling very warm and porous in the
5909,CHAPTER IX,"low-""studded"" school-room where Dame Prentiss, dead and gone, ruled over"
5910,CHAPTER IX,"young children, many of whom are old ghosts now, and have known Abraham"
5911,CHAPTER IX,for twenty or thirty years of our mortal time.
5912,CHAPTER IX,
5913,CHAPTER IX,"Thirst belongs to humanity, everywhere, in all ages; but that white-pine"
5914,CHAPTER IX,"pail, and that brown mug belong to me in particular; and just so of my"
5915,CHAPTER IX,special relationships with other things and with my rice.  One could
5916,CHAPTER IX,never remember himself in eternity by the mere fact of having loved or
5917,CHAPTER IX,hated any more than by that of having thirsted; love and hate have no
5918,CHAPTER IX,more individuality in them than single waves in the ocean;--but the
5919,CHAPTER IX,accidents or trivial marks which distinguished those whom we loved or
5920,CHAPTER IX,"hated make their memory our own forever, and with it that of our own"
5921,CHAPTER IX,personality also.
5922,CHAPTER IX,
5923,CHAPTER IX,"Therefore, my aged friend of five-and-twenty, or thereabouts, pause at"
5924,CHAPTER IX,"the threshold of this particular record, and ask yourself seriously"
5925,CHAPTER IX,whether you are fit to read such revelations as are to follow.  For
5926,CHAPTER IX,"observe, you have here no splendid array of petals such as poets offer"
5927,CHAPTER IX,"you,--nothing but a dry shell, containing, if you will get out what is in"
5928,CHAPTER IX,"it, a few small seeds of poems.  You may laugh at them, if you like.  I"
5929,CHAPTER IX,shall never tell you what I think of you for so doing.  But if you can
5930,CHAPTER IX,"read into the heart of these things, in the light of other memories as"
5931,CHAPTER IX,"slight, yet as dear to your soul, then you are neither more nor less than"
5932,CHAPTER IX,"a POET, and can afford to write no more verses during the rest of your"
5933,CHAPTER IX,"natural life,--which abstinence I take to be one of the surest marks of"
5934,CHAPTER IX,your meriting the divine name I have just bestowed upon you.
5935,CHAPTER IX,
5936,CHAPTER IX,May I beg of you who have begun this paper nobly trusting to your own
5937,CHAPTER IX,imagination and sensibilities to give it the significance which it does
5938,CHAPTER IX,"not lay claim to without your kind assistance,--may I beg of you, I say,"
5939,CHAPTER IX,to pay particular attention to the _brackets_ which enclose certain
5940,CHAPTER IX,"paragraphs?  I want my ""asides,"" you see, to whisper loud to you who read"
5941,CHAPTER IX,"my notes, and sometimes I talk a page or two to you without pretending"
5942,CHAPTER IX,that I said a word of it to our boarders.  You will find a very long
5943,CHAPTER IX,"""aside"" to you almost as soon as you begin to read.  And so, dear young"
5944,CHAPTER IX,"friend, fall to at once, taking such things as I have provided for you;"
5945,CHAPTER IX,"and if you turn them, by the aid of your powerful imagination, into a"
5946,CHAPTER IX,"fair banquet, why, then, peace be with you, and a summer by the still"
5947,CHAPTER IX,"waters of some quiet river, or by some yellow beach, where, as my friend"
5948,CHAPTER IX,"the Professor, says, you can sit with Nature's wrist in your hand and"
5949,CHAPTER IX,count her ocean-pulses.]
5950,CHAPTER IX,
5951,CHAPTER IX,I should like to make a few intimate revelations relating especially to
5952,CHAPTER IX,"my early life, if I thought you would like to hear them."
5953,CHAPTER IX,
5954,CHAPTER IX,"[The schoolmistress turned a little in her chair, and sat with her face"
5955,CHAPTER IX,directed partly towards me.--Half-mourning now;--purple ribbon.  That
5956,CHAPTER IX,"breastpin she wears has _gray_ hair in it; her mother's, no doubt;--I"
5957,CHAPTER IX,"remember our landlady's daughter telling me, soon after the"
5958,CHAPTER IX,"schoolmistress came to board with us, that she had lately ""buried a"
5959,CHAPTER IX,"payrent.""  That's what made her look so pale,--kept the poor dying thing"
5960,CHAPTER IX,alive with her own blood.  Ah! long illness is the real vampyrism; think
5961,CHAPTER IX,"of living a year or two after one is dead, by sucking the life-blood out"
5962,CHAPTER IX,"of a frail young creature at one's bedside!  Well, souls grow white, as"

5966,CHAPTER IX,"than when she came.--Too late!  ""It might have been.""--Amen!--How many"
5967,CHAPTER IX,"thoughts go to a dozen heart-beats, sometimes!  There was no long pause"
5968,CHAPTER IX,"after my remark addressed to the company, but in that time I had the"

5977,CHAPTER IX,"articles,--curtains, sofas, tables, and others, and could draw the"
5978,CHAPTER IX,"patterns of them at this moment,--a brick house, I say, looking out on"
5979,CHAPTER IX,"the water, with a fair parlor, and books and busts and pots of flowers"
5980,CHAPTER IX,"and bird-cages, all complete; and at the window, looking on the water,"
5981,CHAPTER IX,"two of us.--""Male and female created He them.""--These two were standing"
5982,CHAPTER IX,"at the window, when a smaller shape that was playing near them looked up"
5983,CHAPTER IX,"at me with such a look that I -- -- poured out a glass of water, drank it"
5984,CHAPTER IX,"all down, and then continued.]"
5985,CHAPTER IX,
5986,CHAPTER IX,"I said I should like to tell you some things, such as people commonly"
5987,CHAPTER IX,"never tell, about my early recollections.  Should you like to hear them?"
5988,CHAPTER IX,
5989,CHAPTER IX,"Should we _like_ to hear them?--said the schoolmistress;--no, but we"
5990,CHAPTER IX,should love to.
5991,CHAPTER IX,
5992,CHAPTER IX,"[The voice was a sweet one, naturally, and had something very pleasant in"
5993,CHAPTER IX,"its tone, just then.--The four-story brick house, which had gone out like"
5994,CHAPTER IX,"a transparency when the light behind it is quenched, glimmered again for"
5995,CHAPTER IX,"a moment; parlor, books, busts, flower-pots, bird-cages, all"
5996,CHAPTER IX,"complete,--and the figures as before.]"
5997,CHAPTER IX,
5998,CHAPTER IX,"We are waiting with eagerness, Sir,--said the divinity-student."
5999,CHAPTER IX,
6000,CHAPTER IX,[The transparency went out as if a flash of black lightning had struck
6001,CHAPTER IX,it.]
6002,CHAPTER IX,
6003,CHAPTER IX,"If you want to hear my confessions, the next thing--I said--is to know"
6004,CHAPTER IX,whether I can trust you with them.  It is only fair to say that there are
6005,CHAPTER IX,a great many people in the world that laugh at such things.  _I_ think
6006,CHAPTER IX,"they are fools, but perhaps you don't all agree with me."
6007,CHAPTER IX,
6008,CHAPTER IX,Here are children of tender age talked to as if they were capable of
6009,CHAPTER IX,"understanding Calvin's ""Institutes,"" and nobody has honesty or sense"
6010,CHAPTER IX,enough to tell the plain truth about the little wretches: that they are
6011,CHAPTER IX,"as superstitious as naked savages, and such miserable spiritual"
6012,CHAPTER IX,"cowards--that is, if they have any imagination--that they will believe"
6013,CHAPTER IX,"anything which is taught them, and a great deal more which they teach"
6014,CHAPTER IX,themselves.
6015,CHAPTER IX,
6016,CHAPTER IX,"I was born and bred, as I have told you twenty times, among books and"
6017,CHAPTER IX,those who knew what was in books.  I was carefully instructed in things
6018,CHAPTER IX,temporal and spiritual.  But up to a considerable maturity of childhood I
6019,CHAPTER IX,believed Raphael and Michael Angelo to have been superhuman beings.  The
6020,CHAPTER IX,central doctrine of the prevalent religious faith of Christendom was
6021,CHAPTER IX,utterly confused and neutralized in my mind for years by one of those too
6022,CHAPTER IX,"common stories of actual life, which I overheard repeated in a"
6023,CHAPTER IX,whisper.--Why did I not ask? you will say.--You don't remember the rosy
6024,CHAPTER IX,pudency of sensitive children.  The first instinctive movement of the
6025,CHAPTER IX,"little creatures is to make a cache, and bury in it beliefs, doubts,"
6026,CHAPTER IX,"dreams, hopes, and terrors.  I am uncovering one of these _caches_.  Do"
6027,CHAPTER IX,you think I was necessarily a greater fool and coward than another?
6028,CHAPTER IX,
6029,CHAPTER IX,"I was afraid of ships.  Why, I could never tell.  The masts looked"
6030,CHAPTER IX,"frightfully tall,--but they were not so tall as the steeple of our old"
6031,CHAPTER IX,yellow meeting-house.  At any rate I used to hide my eyes from the sloops
6032,CHAPTER IX,"and schooners that were wont to lie at the end of the bridge, and I"
6033,CHAPTER IX,confess that traces of this undefined terror lasted very long.--One other
6034,CHAPTER IX,source of alarm had a still more fearful significance.  There was a great
6035,CHAPTER IX,"wooden HAND,--a glove-maker's sign, which used to swing and creak in the"
6036,CHAPTER IX,"blast, as it hung from a pillar before a certain shop a mile or two"
6037,CHAPTER IX,"outside of the city.  Oh, the dreadful hand!  Always hanging there ready"
6038,CHAPTER IX,"to catch up a little boy, who would come home to supper no more, nor yet"
6039,CHAPTER IX,"to bed,--whose porringer would be laid away empty thenceforth, and his"
6040,CHAPTER IX,half-worn shoes wait until his small brother grew to fit them.
6041,CHAPTER IX,
6042,CHAPTER IX,"As for all manner of superstitious observances, I used once to think I"
6043,CHAPTER IX,"must have been peculiar in having such a list of them, but I now believe"
6044,CHAPTER IX,that half the children of the same age go through the same experiences.
6045,CHAPTER IX,No Roman soothsayer ever had such a catalogue of _omens_ as I found in
6046,CHAPTER IX,the Sibylline leaves of my childhood.  That trick of throwing a stone at
6047,CHAPTER IX,"a tree and attaching some mighty issue to hitting or missing, which you"
6048,CHAPTER IX,"will find mentioned in one or more biographies, I well remember."
6049,CHAPTER IX,Stepping on or over certain particular things or spots--Dr. Johnson's
6050,CHAPTER IX,especial weakness I got the habit of at a very early age.--I won't swear
6051,CHAPTER IX,that I have not some tendency to these not wise practices even at this
6052,CHAPTER IX,present date.  [How many of you that read these notes can say the same
6053,CHAPTER IX,thing!]
6054,CHAPTER IX,
6055,CHAPTER IX,"With these follies mingled sweet delusions, which I loved so well I would"
6056,CHAPTER IX,"not outgrow them, even when it required a voluntary effort to put a"
6057,CHAPTER IX,momentary trust in them.  Here is one which I cannot help telling you.
6058,CHAPTER IX,
6059,CHAPTER IX,The firing of the great guns at the Navy-yard is easily heard at the
6060,CHAPTER IX,"place where I was born and lived.  ""There is a ship of war come in,"" they"
6061,CHAPTER IX,"used to say, when they heard them.  Of course, I supposed that such"
6062,CHAPTER IX,"vessels came in unexpectedly, after indefinite years of"
6063,CHAPTER IX,"absence,--suddenly as falling stones; and that the great guns roared in"
6064,CHAPTER IX,their astonishment and delight at the sight of the old war-ship splitting
6065,CHAPTER IX,"the bay with her cutwater.  Now, the sloop-of-war the Wasp, Captain"
6066,CHAPTER IX,"Blakely, after gloriously capturing the Reindeer and the Avon, had"
6067,CHAPTER IX,"disappeared from the face of the ocean, and was supposed to be lost.  But"
6068,CHAPTER IX,"there was no proof of it, and, of course, for a time, hopes were"
6069,CHAPTER IX,entertained that she might be heard from.  Long after the last real
6070,CHAPTER IX,"chance had utterly vanished, I pleased myself with the fond illusion that"
6071,CHAPTER IX,"somewhere on the waste of waters she was still floating, and there were"
6072,CHAPTER IX,_years_ during which I never heard the sound of the great guns booming
6073,CHAPTER IX,"inland from the Navy-yard without saying to myself, ""The Wasp has come!"""
6074,CHAPTER IX,"and almost thinking I could see her, as she rolled in, crumpling the"
6075,CHAPTER IX,"water before her, weather-beaten, barnacled, with shattered spars and"
6076,CHAPTER IX,"threadbare canvas, welcomed by the shouts and tears of thousands.  This"
6077,CHAPTER IX,was one of those dreams that I nursed and never told.  Let me make a
6078,CHAPTER IX,"clean breast of it now, and say, that, so late as to have outgrown"
6079,CHAPTER IX,"childhood, perhaps to have got far on towards manhood, when the roar of"
6080,CHAPTER IX,"the cannon has struck suddenly on my ear, I have started with a thrill of"
6081,CHAPTER IX,"vague expectation and tremulous delight, and the long-unspoken words have"
6082,CHAPTER IX,"articulated themselves in the mind's dumb whisper, _The Wasp has come_!"
6083,CHAPTER IX,
6084,CHAPTER IX,"--Yes, children believe plenty of queer things.  I suppose all of you"
6085,CHAPTER IX,have had the pocket-book fever when you were little?--What do I mean?
6086,CHAPTER IX,"Why, ripping up old pocket-books in the firm belief that bank-bills to an"
6087,CHAPTER IX,"immense amount were hidden in them.--So, too, you must all remember some"
6088,CHAPTER IX,"splendid unfulfilled promise of somebody or other, which fed you with"
6089,CHAPTER IX,"hopes perhaps for years, and which left a blank in your life which"
6090,CHAPTER IX,nothing has ever filled up.--O. T. quitted our household carrying with
6091,CHAPTER IX,him the passionate regrets of the more youthful members.  He was an
6092,CHAPTER IX,"ingenious youngster; wrote wonderful copies, and carved the two initials"
6093,CHAPTER IX,"given above with great skill on all available surfaces.  I thought, by"
6094,CHAPTER IX,"the way, they were all gone; but the other day I found them on a certain"
6095,CHAPTER IX,door which I will show you some time.  How it surprised me to find them
6096,CHAPTER IX,so near the ground!  I had thought the boy of no trivial dimensions.
6097,CHAPTER IX,"Well, O. T., when he went, made a solemn promise to two of us.  I was to"
6098,CHAPTER IX,"have a ship, and the other a mar_tin_-house (last syllable pronounced as"
6099,CHAPTER IX,"in the word _tin_).  Neither ever came; but, oh, how many and many a time"
6100,CHAPTER IX,"I have stolen to the corner,--the cars pass close by it at this"
6101,CHAPTER IX,"time,--and looked up that long avenue, thinking that he must be coming"
6102,CHAPTER IX,"now, almost sure, as I turned to look northward, that there he would be,"
6103,CHAPTER IX,"trudging toward me, the ship in one hand and the mar_tin_-house in the"
6104,CHAPTER IX,other!
6105,CHAPTER IX,
6106,CHAPTER IX,"[You must not suppose that all I am going to say, as well as all I have"
6107,CHAPTER IX,"said, was told to the whole company.  The young fellow whom they call"
6108,CHAPTER IX,"John was in the yard, sitting on a barrel and smoking a cheroot, the"
6109,CHAPTER IX,"fumes of which came in, not ungrateful, through the open window.  The"
6110,CHAPTER IX,divinity-student disappeared in the midst of our talk.  The poor relation
6111,CHAPTER IX,"in black bombazine, who looked and moved as if all her articulations were"
6112,CHAPTER IX,"elbow-joints, had gone off to her chamber, after waiting with a look of"
6113,CHAPTER IX,soul-subduing decorum at the foot of the stairs until one of the male
6114,CHAPTER IX,sort had passed her and ascended into the upper regions.  This is a
6115,CHAPTER IX,"famous point of etiquette in our boarding-house; in fact, between"
6116,CHAPTER IX,"ourselves, they make such an awful fuss about it, that I, for one, had a"
6117,CHAPTER IX,great deal rather have them simple enough not to think of such matters at
6118,CHAPTER IX,"all.  Our landlady's daughter said, the other evening, that she was going"
6119,CHAPTER IX,"to ""retire""; whereupon the young fellow called John took up a lamp and"
6120,CHAPTER IX,insisted on lighting her to the foot of the staircase.  Nothing would
6121,CHAPTER IX,"induce her to pass by him, until the schoolmistress, saying in good plain"
6122,CHAPTER IX,"English that it was her bed-time, walked straight by them both, not"
6123,CHAPTER IX,seeming to trouble herself about either of them.
6124,CHAPTER IX,
6125,CHAPTER IX,I have been led away from what I meant the portion included in these
6126,CHAPTER IX,"brackets to inform my readers about.  I say, then, most of the boarders"
6127,CHAPTER IX,had left the table about the time when I began telling some of these
6128,CHAPTER IX,"secrets of mine,--all of them, in fact, but the old gentleman opposite"
6129,CHAPTER IX,and the schoolmistress.  I understand why a young woman should like to
6130,CHAPTER IX,"hear these simple but genuine experiences of early life, which are, as I"
6131,CHAPTER IX,"have said, the little brown seeds of what may yet grow to be poems with"
6132,CHAPTER IX,leaves of azure and gold; but when the old gentleman pushed up his chair
6133,CHAPTER IX,"nearer to me, and slanted round his best ear, and once, when I was"
6134,CHAPTER IX,"speaking of some trifling, tender reminiscence, drew a long breath, with"
6135,CHAPTER IX,"such a tremor in it that a little more and it would have been a sob, why,"
6136,CHAPTER IX,then I felt there must be something of nature in them which redeemed
6137,CHAPTER IX,"their seeming insignificance.  Tell me, man or woman with whom I am"
6138,CHAPTER IX,"whispering, have you not a small store of recollections, such as these I"
6139,CHAPTER IX,"am uncovering, buried beneath the dead leaves of many summers, perhaps"
6140,CHAPTER IX,"under the unmelting snows of fast-returning winters,--a few such"
6141,CHAPTER IX,"recollections, which, if you should write them all out, would be swept"
6142,CHAPTER IX,"into some careless editor's drawer, and might cost a scanty half-hour's"
6143,CHAPTER IX,"lazy reading to his subscribers,--and yet, if Death should cheat you of"
6144,CHAPTER IX,"them, you would not know yourself in eternity?]"
6145,CHAPTER IX,
6146,CHAPTER IX,"--I made three acquaintances at a very early period of life, my"
6147,CHAPTER IX,introduction to whom was never forgotten.  The first unequivocal act of
6148,CHAPTER IX,wrong that has left its trace in my memory was this: refusing a small
6149,CHAPTER IX,"favor asked of me,--nothing more than telling what had happened at school"
6150,CHAPTER IX,one morning.  No matter who asked it; but there were circumstances which
6151,CHAPTER IX,saddened and awed me.  I had no heart to speak;--I faltered some
6152,CHAPTER IX,"miserable, perhaps petulant excuse, stole away, and the first battle of"
6153,CHAPTER IX,"life was lost.  What remorse followed I need not tell.  Then and there,"
6154,CHAPTER IX,"to the best of my knowledge, I first consciously took Sin by the hand and"
6155,CHAPTER IX,turned my back on Duty.  Time has led me to look upon my offence more
6156,CHAPTER IX,"leniently; I do not believe it or any other childish wrong is infinite,"
6157,CHAPTER IX,"as some have pretended, but infinitely finite.  Yet, oh if I had but won"
6158,CHAPTER IX,that battle!
6159,CHAPTER IX,
6160,CHAPTER IX,"The great Destroyer, whose awful shadow it was that had silenced me, came"
6161,CHAPTER IX,"near me,--but never, so as to be distinctly seen and remembered, during"
6162,CHAPTER IX,"my tender years.  There flits dimly before me the image of a little girl,"
6163,CHAPTER IX,"whose name even I have forgotten, a schoolmate, whom we missed one day,"
6164,CHAPTER IX,and were told that she had died.  But what death was I never had any very
6165,CHAPTER IX,"distinct idea, until one day I climbed the low stone wall of the old"
6166,CHAPTER IX,burial-ground and mingled with a group that were looking into a very
6167,CHAPTER IX,"deep, long, narrow hole, dug down through the green sod, down through the"
6168,CHAPTER IX,"brown loam, down through the yellow gravel, and there at the bottom was"
6169,CHAPTER IX,"an oblong red box, and a still, sharp, white face of a young man seen"
6170,CHAPTER IX,"through an opening at one end of it.  When the lid was closed, and the"
6171,CHAPTER IX,"gravel and stones rattled down pell-mell, and the woman in black, who was"
6172,CHAPTER IX,"crying and wringing her hands, went off with the other mourners, and left"
6173,CHAPTER IX,"him, then I felt that I had seen Death, and should never forget him."
6174,CHAPTER IX,
6175,CHAPTER IX,One other acquaintance I made at an earlier period of life than the habit
6176,CHAPTER IX,"of romancers authorizes.--Love, of course.--She was a famous beauty"
6177,CHAPTER IX,afterwards.--I am satisfied that many children rehearse their parts in
6178,CHAPTER IX,the drama of life before they have shed all their milk-teeth.--I think I
6179,CHAPTER IX,won't tell the story of the golden blonde.--I suppose everybody has had
6180,CHAPTER IX,"his childish fancies; but sometimes they are passionate impulses, which"
6181,CHAPTER IX,anticipate all the tremulous emotions belonging to a later period.  Most
6182,CHAPTER IX,children remember seeing and adoring an angel before they were a dozen
6183,CHAPTER IX,years old.
6184,CHAPTER IX,
6185,CHAPTER IX,[The old gentleman had left his chair opposite and taken a seat by the
6186,CHAPTER IX,"schoolmistress and myself, a little way from the table.--It's true, it's"
6187,CHAPTER IX,"true,--said the old gentleman.--He took hold of a steel watch-chain,"
6188,CHAPTER IX,"which carried a large, square gold key at one end and was supposed to"
6189,CHAPTER IX,have some kind of time-keeper at the other.  With some trouble he dragged
6190,CHAPTER IX,"up an ancient-looking, thick, silver, bull's-eye watch.  He looked at it"
6191,CHAPTER IX,"for a moment,--hesitated,--touched the inner corner of his right eye with"
6192,CHAPTER IX,"the pulp of his middle finger,--looked at the face of the watch,--said it"
6193,CHAPTER IX,"was getting into the forenoon,--then opened the watch and handed me the"
6194,CHAPTER IX,"loose outside case without a word.--The watch-paper had been pink once,"
6195,CHAPTER IX,"and had a faint tinge still, as if all its tender life had not yet quite"
6196,CHAPTER IX,"faded out.  Two little birds, a flower, and, in small school-girl"
6197,CHAPTER IX,"letters, a date,--17 . .--no matter.--Before I was thirteen years"
6198,CHAPTER IX,"old,--said the old gentleman.--I don't know what was in that young"
6199,CHAPTER IX,"schoolmistress's head, nor why she should have done it; but she took out"
6200,CHAPTER IX,"the watch-paper and put it softly to her lips, as if she were kissing the"
6201,CHAPTER IX,poor thing that made it so long ago.  The old gentleman took the
6202,CHAPTER IX,"watch-paper carefully from her, replaced it, turned away and walked out,"
6203,CHAPTER IX,holding the watch in his hand.  I saw him pass the window a moment after
6204,CHAPTER IX,with that foolish white hat on his head; he couldn't have been thinking
6205,CHAPTER IX,what he was about when he put it on.  So the schoolmistress and I were
6206,CHAPTER IX,"left alone.  I drew my chair a shade nearer to her, and continued.]"
6207,CHAPTER IX,
6208,CHAPTER IX,"And since I am talking of early recollections, I don't know why I"
6209,CHAPTER IX,"shouldn't mention some others that still cling to me,--not that you will"
6210,CHAPTER IX,attach any very particular meaning to these same images so full of
6211,CHAPTER IX,"significance to me, but that you will find something parallel to them in"
6212,CHAPTER IX,"your own memory.  You remember, perhaps, what I said one day about"
6213,CHAPTER IX,smells.  There were certain _sounds_ also which had a mysterious
6214,CHAPTER IX,"suggestiveness to me,--not so intense, perhaps, as that connected with"
6215,CHAPTER IX,"the other sense, but yet peculiar, and never to be forgotten."
6216,CHAPTER IX,
6217,CHAPTER IX,"The first was the creaking of the wood-sleds, bringing their loads of oak"
6218,CHAPTER IX,"and walnut from the country, as the slow-swinging oxen trailed them along"
6219,CHAPTER IX,"over the complaining snow, in the cold, brown light of early morning."
6220,CHAPTER IX,Lying in bed and listening to their dreary music had a pleasure in it
6221,CHAPTER IX,"akin to the Lucretian luxury, or that which Byron speaks of as to be"
6222,CHAPTER IX,"enjoyed in looking on at a battle by one ""who hath no friend, no brother"
6223,CHAPTER IX,"there."""
6224,CHAPTER IX,
6225,CHAPTER IX,"There was another sound, in itself so sweet, and so connected with one of"
6226,CHAPTER IX,those simple and curious superstitions of childhood of which I have
6227,CHAPTER IX,"spoken, that I can never cease to cherish a sad sort of love for it.--Let"
6228,CHAPTER IX,"me tell the superstitious fancy first.  The Puritan ""Sabbath,"" as"
6229,CHAPTER IX,"everybody knows, began at ""sundown"" on Saturday evening.  To such"
6230,CHAPTER IX,"observance of it I was born and bred.  As the large, round disk of day"
6231,CHAPTER IX,"declined, a stillness, a solemnity, a somewhat melancholy hush came over"
6232,CHAPTER IX,"us all.  It was time for work to cease, and for playthings to be put"
6233,CHAPTER IX,"away.  The world of active life passed into the shadow of an eclipse, not"
6234,CHAPTER IX,to emerge until the sun should sink again beneath the horizon.
6235,CHAPTER IX,
6236,CHAPTER IX,It was in this stillness of the world without and of the soul within that
6237,CHAPTER IX,the pulsating lullaby of the evening crickets used to make itself most
6238,CHAPTER IX,"distinctly heard,--so that I well remember I used to think that the"
6239,CHAPTER IX,"purring of these little creatures, which mingled with the batrachian"
6240,CHAPTER IX,"hymns from the neighboring swamp, _was peculiar to Saturday evenings_.  I"
6241,CHAPTER IX,don't know that anything could give a clearer idea of the quieting and
6242,CHAPTER IX,subduing effect of the old habit of observance of what was considered
6243,CHAPTER IX,"holy time, than this strange, childish fancy."
6244,CHAPTER IX,
6245,CHAPTER IX,"Yes, and there was still another sound which mingled its solemn cadences"
6246,CHAPTER IX,with the waking and sleeping dreams of my boyhood.  It was heard only at
6247,CHAPTER IX,"times,--a deep, muffled roar, which rose and fell, not loud, but vast,--a"
6248,CHAPTER IX,"whistling boy would have drowned it for his next neighbor, but it must"
6249,CHAPTER IX,have been heard over the space of a hundred square miles.  I used to
6250,CHAPTER IX,wonder what this might be.  Could it be the roar of the thousand wheels
6251,CHAPTER IX,and the ten thousand footsteps jarring and trampling along the stones of
6252,CHAPTER IX,"the neighboring city?  That would be continuous; but this, as I have"
6253,CHAPTER IX,"said, rose and fell in regular rhythm.  I remember being told, and I"
6254,CHAPTER IX,"suppose this to have been the true solution, that it was the sound of the"
6255,CHAPTER IX,"waves, after a high wind, breaking on the long beaches many miles"
6256,CHAPTER IX,distant.  I should really like to know whether any observing people
6257,CHAPTER IX,"living ten miles, more or less, inland from long beaches,--in such a"
6258,CHAPTER IX,"town, for instance, as Cantabridge, in the eastern part of the Territory"
6259,CHAPTER IX,"of the Massachusetts,--have ever observed any such sound, and whether it"
6260,CHAPTER IX,was rightly accounted for as above.
6261,CHAPTER IX,
6262,CHAPTER IX,"Mingling with these inarticulate sounds in the low murmur of memory, are"
6263,CHAPTER IX,the echoes of certain voices I have heard at rare intervals.  I grieve to
6264,CHAPTER IX,"say it, but our people, I think, have not generally agreeable voices."
6265,CHAPTER IX,"The marrowy organisms, with skins that shed water like the backs of"
6266,CHAPTER IX,"ducks, with smooth surfaces neatly padded beneath, and velvet linings to"
6267,CHAPTER IX,"their singing-pipes, are not so common among us as that other pattern of"
6268,CHAPTER IX,"humanity with angular outlines and plane surfaces, and integuments, hair"
6269,CHAPTER IX,like the fibrous covering of a cocoa-nut in gloss and suppleness as well
6270,CHAPTER IX,"as color, and voices at once thin and strenuous,--acidulous enough to"
6271,CHAPTER IX,"produce effervescence with alkalis, and stridulous enough to sing duets"
6272,CHAPTER IX,"with the katydids.  I think our conversational soprano, as sometimes"
6273,CHAPTER IX,"overheard in the cars, arising from a group of young persons, who may"
6274,CHAPTER IX,"have taken the train at one of our great industrial centres, for"
6275,CHAPTER IX,"instance,--young persons of the female sex, we will say, who have bustled"
6276,CHAPTER IX,"in full-dressed, engaged in loud strident speech, and who, after free"
6277,CHAPTER IX,"discussion, have fixed on two or more double seats, which having secured,"
6278,CHAPTER IX,"they proceed to eat apples and hand round daguerreotypes,--I say, I think"
6279,CHAPTER IX,"the conversational soprano, heard under these circumstances, would not be"
6280,CHAPTER IX,"among the allurements the old Enemy would put in requisition, were he"
6281,CHAPTER IX,getting up a new temptation of St. Anthony.
6282,CHAPTER IX,
6283,CHAPTER IX,"There are sweet voices among us, we all know, and voices not musical, it"
6284,CHAPTER IX,"may be, to those who hear them for the first time, yet sweeter to us than"
6285,CHAPTER IX,any we shall hear until we listen to some warbling angel in the overture
6286,CHAPTER IX,to that eternity of blissful harmonies we hope to enjoy.--But why should
6287,CHAPTER IX,"I tell lies?  If my friends love me, it is because I try to tell the"
6288,CHAPTER IX,truth.  I never heard but two voices in my life that frightened me by
6289,CHAPTER IX,their sweetness.
6290,CHAPTER IX,
6291,CHAPTER IX,"--Frightened you?--said the schoolmistress.--Yes, frightened me.  They"
6292,CHAPTER IX,made me feel as if there might be constituted a creature with such a
6293,CHAPTER IX,"chord in her voice to some string in another's soul, that, if she but"
6294,CHAPTER IX,"spoke, he would leave all and follow her, though it were into the jaws of"
6295,CHAPTER IX,"Erebus.  Our only chance to keep our wits is, that there are so few"
6296,CHAPTER IX,"natural chords between others' voices and this string in our souls, and"
6297,CHAPTER IX,that those which at first may have jarred a little by and by come into
6298,CHAPTER IX,harmony with it.--But I tell you this is no fiction.  You may call the
6299,CHAPTER IX,"story of Ulysses and the Sirens a fable, but what will you say to Mario"
6300,CHAPTER IX,and the poor lady who followed him?
6301,CHAPTER IX,
6302,CHAPTER IX,--Whose were those two voices that bewitches me so?--They both belonged
6303,CHAPTER IX,"to German women.  One was a chambermaid, not otherwise fascinating.  The"
6304,CHAPTER IX,"key of my room at a certain great hotel was missing, and this Teutonic"
6305,CHAPTER IX,maiden was summoned to give information respecting it.  The simple soul
6306,CHAPTER IX,"was evidently not long from her mother-land, and spoke with sweet"
6307,CHAPTER IX,"uncertainty of dialect.  But to hear her wonder and lament and suggest,"
6308,CHAPTER IX,"with soft, liquid inflexions, and low, sad murmurs, in tones as full of"
6309,CHAPTER IX,serious tenderness for the fate of the lost key as if it had been a child
6310,CHAPTER IX,"that had strayed from its mother, was so winning, that, had her features"
6311,CHAPTER IX,"and figure been as delicious as her accents,--if she had looked like the"
6312,CHAPTER IX,"marble Clytie, for instance,--why, all can say is--"
6313,CHAPTER IX,
6314,CHAPTER IX,"[The schoolmistress opened her eyes so wide, that I stopped short.]"
6315,CHAPTER IX,
6316,CHAPTER IX,I was only going to say that I should have drowned myself.  For Lake Erie
6317,CHAPTER IX,"was close by, and it is so much better to accept asphyxia, which takes"
6318,CHAPTER IX,"only three minutes by the watch, than a _mesalliance_, that lasts fifty"
6319,CHAPTER IX,"years to begin with, and then passes along down the line of descent,"
6320,CHAPTER IX,(breaking out in all manner of boorish manifestations of feature and
6321,CHAPTER IX,"manner, which, if men were only as short-lived as horses, could be"
6322,CHAPTER IX,readily traced back through the square-roots and the cube-roots of the
6323,CHAPTER IX,family stem on which you have hung the armorial bearings of the De
6324,CHAPTER IX,"Champignons or the De la Morues, until one came to beings that ate with"
6325,CHAPTER IX,"knives and said ""Haow?"") that no person of right feeling could have"
6326,CHAPTER IX,hesitated for a single moment.
6327,CHAPTER IX,
6328,CHAPTER IX,"The second of the ravishing voices I have heard was, as I have said, that"
6329,CHAPTER IX,of another German woman.--I suppose I shall ruin myself by saying that
6330,CHAPTER IX,such a voice could not have come from any Americanized human being.
6331,CHAPTER IX,
6332,CHAPTER IX,"--What was there in it?--said the schoolmistress,--and, upon my word, her"
6333,CHAPTER IX,"tones were so very musical, that I almost wished I had said three voices"
6334,CHAPTER IX,"instead of two, and not made the unpatriotic remark above reported.--Oh,"
6335,CHAPTER IX,"I said, it had so much _woman_ in it,--_muliebrity_, as well as"
6336,CHAPTER IX,"_femineity_;--no self-assertion, such as free suffrage introduces into"
6337,CHAPTER IX,"every word and movement; large, vigorous nature, running back to those"
6338,CHAPTER IX,"huge-limbed Germans of Tacitus, but subdued by the reverential training"
6339,CHAPTER IX,and tuned by the kindly culture of fifty generations.  Sharp business
6340,CHAPTER IX,"habits, a lean soil, independence, enterprise, and east winds, are not"
6341,CHAPTER IX,"the best things for the larynx.  Still, you hear noble voices among"
6342,CHAPTER IX,"us,--I have known families famous for them,--but ask the first person you"
6343,CHAPTER IX,"meet a question, and ten to one there is a hard, sharp, metallic,"
6344,CHAPTER IX,"matter-of-business clink in the accents of the answer, that produces the"
6345,CHAPTER IX,effect of one of those bells which small trades-people connect with their
6346,CHAPTER IX,"shop-doors, and which spring upon your ear with such vivacity, as you"
6347,CHAPTER IX,"enter, that your first impulse is to retire at once from the precincts."
6348,CHAPTER IX,
6349,CHAPTER IX,"--Ah, but I must not forget that dear little child I saw and heard in a"
6350,CHAPTER IX,French hospital.  Between two and three years old.  Fell out of her chair
6351,CHAPTER IX,"and snapped both thigh-bones.  Lying in bed, patient, gentle.  Rough"
6352,CHAPTER IX,"students round her, some in white aprons, looking fearfully"
6353,CHAPTER IX,"business-like; but the child placid, perfectly still.  I spoke to her,"
6354,CHAPTER IX,and the blessed little creature answered me in a voice of such heavenly
6355,CHAPTER IX,"sweetness, with that reedy thrill in it which you have heard in the"
6356,CHAPTER IX,"thrush's even-song, that I hear it at this moment, while I am writing, so"
6357,CHAPTER IX,"many, many years afterwards.--_C'est tout comme un serin_, said the"
6358,CHAPTER IX,French student at my side.
6359,CHAPTER IX,
6360,CHAPTER IX,These are the voices which struck the key-note of my conceptions as to
6361,CHAPTER IX,"what the sounds we are to hear in heaven will be, if we shall enter"
6362,CHAPTER IX,through one of the twelve gates of pearl.  There must be other things
6363,CHAPTER IX,besides aerolites that wander from their own spheres to ours; and when we
6364,CHAPTER IX,"speak of celestial sweetness or beauty, we may be nearer the literal"
6365,CHAPTER IX,truth than we dream.  If mankind generally are the shipwrecked survivors
6366,CHAPTER IX,"of some pre-Adamitic cataclysm, set adrift in these little open boats of"
6367,CHAPTER IX,"humanity to make one more trial to reach the shore,--as some grave"
6368,CHAPTER IX,"theologians have maintained,--if, in plain English, men are the ghosts of"
6369,CHAPTER IX,"dead devils who have ""died into life,"" (to borrow an expression from"
6370,CHAPTER IX,"Keats,) and walk the earth in a suit of living rags which lasts three or"
6371,CHAPTER IX,"four score summers,--why, there must have been a few good spirits sent to"
6372,CHAPTER IX,"keep them company, and these sweet voices I speak of must belong to them."
6373,CHAPTER IX,
6374,CHAPTER IX,"--I wish you could once hear my sister's voice,--said the schoolmistress."
6375,CHAPTER IX,
6376,CHAPTER IX,"If it is like yours, it must be a pleasant one,--said I."
6377,CHAPTER IX,
6378,CHAPTER IX,"I never thought mine was anything,--said the schoolmistress."
6379,CHAPTER IX,
6380,CHAPTER IX,"How should you know?--said I.--People never hear their own voices,--any"
6381,CHAPTER IX,more than they see their own faces.  There is not even a looking-glass
6382,CHAPTER IX,"for the voice.  Of course, there is something audible to us when we"
6383,CHAPTER IX,speak; but that something is not our own voice as it is known to all our
6384,CHAPTER IX,"acquaintances.  I think, if an image spoke to us in our own tones, we"
6385,CHAPTER IX,"should not know them in the least.--How pleasant it would be, if in"
6386,CHAPTER IX,another state of being we could have shapes like our former selves for
6387,CHAPTER IX,"playthings,--we standing outside or inside of them, as we liked, and they"
6388,CHAPTER IX,being to us just what we used to be to others!
6389,CHAPTER IX,
6390,CHAPTER IX,"--I wonder if there will be nothing like what we call ""play,"" after our"
6391,CHAPTER IX,"earthly toys are broken,--said the schoolmistress."
6392,CHAPTER IX,
6393,CHAPTER IX,"Hush,--said I,--what will the divinity-student say?"
6394,CHAPTER IX,
6395,CHAPTER IX,"[I thought she was hit, that time;--but the shot must have gone over her,"
6396,CHAPTER IX,or on one side of her; she did not flinch.]
6397,CHAPTER IX,
6398,CHAPTER IX,"Oh,--said the schoolmistress,--he must look out for my sister's heresies;"
6399,CHAPTER IX,I am afraid he will be too busy with them to take care of mine.
6400,CHAPTER IX,
6401,CHAPTER IX,"Do you mean to say,--said I,--that it is _your sister_ whom that"
6402,CHAPTER IX,student--
6403,CHAPTER IX,
6404,CHAPTER IX,"[The young fellow commonly known as John, who had been sitting on the"
6405,CHAPTER IX,"barrel, smoking, jumped off just then, kicked over the barrel, gave it a"
6406,CHAPTER IX,"push with his foot that set it rolling, and stuck his saucy-looking face"
6407,CHAPTER IX,in at the window so as to cut my question off in the middle; and the
6408,CHAPTER IX,"schoolmistress leaving the room a few minutes afterwards, I did not have"
6409,CHAPTER IX,a chance to finish it.
6410,CHAPTER IX,
6411,CHAPTER IX,"The young fellow came in and sat down in a chair, putting his heels on"
6412,CHAPTER IX,the top of another.
6413,CHAPTER IX,
6414,CHAPTER IX,"Pooty girl,--said he."
6415,CHAPTER IX,
6416,CHAPTER IX,"A fine young lady,--I replied."
6417,CHAPTER IX,
6418,CHAPTER IX,"Keeps a first-rate school, according to accounts,--said he,--teaches all"
6419,CHAPTER IX,"sorts of things,--Latin and Italian and music.  Folks rich once,--smashed"
6420,CHAPTER IX,up.  She went right ahead as smart as if she'd been born to work.  That's
6421,CHAPTER IX,"the kind o' girl I go for.  I'd marry her, only two or three other girls"
6422,CHAPTER IX,"would drown themselves, if I did."
6423,CHAPTER IX,
6424,CHAPTER IX,I think the above is the longest speech of this young fellow's which I
6425,CHAPTER IX,"have put on record.  I do not like to change his peculiar expressions,"
6426,CHAPTER IX,"for this is one of those cases in which the style is the man, as M. de"
6427,CHAPTER IX,"Buffon says.  The fact is, the young fellow is a good-hearted creature"
6428,CHAPTER IX,"enough, only too fond of his jokes,--and if it were not for those"
6429,CHAPTER IX,"heat-lightning winks on one side of his face, I should not mind his fun"
6430,CHAPTER IX,much.]
6431,CHAPTER IX,
6432,CHAPTER IX,* * * * *
6433,CHAPTER IX,
6434,CHAPTER IX,"[Some days after this, when the company were together again, I talked a"
6435,CHAPTER IX,little.]
6436,CHAPTER IX,
6437,CHAPTER IX,--I don't think I have a genuine hatred for anybody.  I am well aware
6438,CHAPTER IX,that I differ herein from the sturdy English moralist and the stout
6439,CHAPTER IX,American tragedian.  I don't deny that I hate _the sight_ of certain
6440,CHAPTER IX,people; but the qualities which make me tend to hate the man himself are
6441,CHAPTER IX,"such as I am so much disposed to pity, that, except under immediate"
6442,CHAPTER IX,"aggravation, I feel kindly enough to the worst of them.  It is such a sad"
6443,CHAPTER IX,"thing to be born a sneaking fellow, so much worse than to inherit a"
6444,CHAPTER IX,"hump-back or a couple of club-feet, that I sometimes feel as if we ought"
6445,CHAPTER IX,"to love the crippled souls, if I may use this expression, with a certain"
6446,CHAPTER IX,tenderness which we need not waste on noble natures.  One who is born
6447,CHAPTER IX,with such congenital incapacity that nothing can make a gentleman of him
6448,CHAPTER IX,"is entitled, not to our wrath, but to our profoundest sympathy.  But as"
6449,CHAPTER IX,"we cannot help hating the sight of these people, just as we do that of"
6450,CHAPTER IX,"physical deformities, we gradually eliminate them from our society,--we"
6451,CHAPTER IX,"love them, but open the window and let them go.  By the time decent"
6452,CHAPTER IX,people reach middle age they have weeded their circle pretty well of
6453,CHAPTER IX,"these unfortunates, unless they have a taste for such animals; in which"
6454,CHAPTER IX,"case, no matter what their position may be, there is something, you may"
6455,CHAPTER IX,"be sure, in their natures akin to that of their wretched parasites."
6456,CHAPTER IX,
6457,CHAPTER IX,"--The divinity-student wished to know what I thought of affinities, as"
6458,CHAPTER IX,well as of antipathies; did I believe in love at first sight?
6459,CHAPTER IX,
6460,CHAPTER IX,"Sir,--said I,--all men love all women.  That is the _prima-facie_ aspect"
6461,CHAPTER IX,"of the case.  The Court of Nature assumes the law to be, that all men do"
6462,CHAPTER IX,so; and the individual man is bound to show cause why he does not love
6463,CHAPTER IX,"any particular woman.  A man, says one of my old black-letter law-books,"
6464,CHAPTER IX,"may show divers good reasons, as thus: He hath not seen the person named"
6465,CHAPTER IX,"in the indictment; she is of tender age, or the reverse of that; she hath"
6466,CHAPTER IX,"certain personal disqualifications,--as, for instance, she is a"
6467,CHAPTER IX,"blackamoor, or hath an ill-favored countenance; or, his capacity of"
6468,CHAPTER IX,"loving being limited, his affections are engrossed by a previous comer;"
6469,CHAPTER IX,and so of other conditions.  Not the less is it true that he is bound by
6470,CHAPTER IX,duty and inclined by nature to love each and every woman.  Therefore it
6471,CHAPTER IX,is that each woman virtually summons every man to show cause why he doth
6472,CHAPTER IX,"not love her.  This is not by written document, or direct speech, for the"
6473,CHAPTER IX,"most part, but by certain signs of silk, gold, and other materials, which"
6474,CHAPTER IX,"say to all men,--Look on me and love, as in duty bound.  Then the man"
6475,CHAPTER IX,"pleadeth his special incapacity, whatsoever that may be,--as, for"
6476,CHAPTER IX,"instance, impecuniosity, or that he hath one or many wives in his"
6477,CHAPTER IX,"household, or that he is of mean figure, or small capacity; of which"
6478,CHAPTER IX,"reasons it may be noted, that the first is, according to late decisions,"
6479,CHAPTER IX,of chiefest authority.--So far the old law-book.  But there is a note
6480,CHAPTER IX,"from an older authority, saying that every woman doth also love each and"
6481,CHAPTER IX,"every man, except there be some good reason to the contrary; and a very"
6482,CHAPTER IX,"observing friend of mine, a young unmarried clergyman, tells me, that, so"
6483,CHAPTER IX,"far as his experience goes, he has reason to think the ancient author had"
6484,CHAPTER IX,fact to justify his statement.
6485,CHAPTER IX,
6486,CHAPTER IX,I'll tell you how it is with the pictures of women we fall in love with
6487,CHAPTER IX,at first sight.
6488,CHAPTER IX,
6489,CHAPTER IX,"--We a'n't talking about pictures,--said the landlady's daughter,--we're"
6490,CHAPTER IX,talking about women.
6491,CHAPTER IX,
6492,CHAPTER IX,"I understood that we were speaking of love at sight,--I remarked,"
6493,CHAPTER IX,"mildly.--Now, as all a man knows about a woman whom he looks at is just"
6494,CHAPTER IX,"what a picture as big as a copper, or a ""nickel,"" rather, at the bottom"
6495,CHAPTER IX,"of his eye can teach him, I think I am right in saying we are talking"
6496,CHAPTER IX,"about the pictures of women.--Well, now, the reason why a man is not"
6497,CHAPTER IX,desperately in love with ten thousand women at once is just that which
6498,CHAPTER IX,prevents all our portraits being distinctly seen upon that wall.  They
6499,CHAPTER IX,"all _are_ painted there by reflection from our faces, but because _all_"
6500,CHAPTER IX,"of them are painted on each spot, and each on the same surface, and many"
6501,CHAPTER IX,"other objects at the same time, no one is seen as a picture.  But darken"
6502,CHAPTER IX,"a chamber and let a single pencil of rays in through a key-hole, then you"
6503,CHAPTER IX,have a picture on the wall.  We never fall in love with a woman in
6504,CHAPTER IX,"distinction from women, until we can get an image of her through a"
6505,CHAPTER IX,"pin-hole; and then we can see nothing else, and nobody but ourselves can"
6506,CHAPTER IX,see the image in our mental camera-obscura.
6507,CHAPTER IX,
6508,CHAPTER IX,"--My friend, the Poet, tells me he has to leave town whenever the"
6509,CHAPTER IX,anniversaries come round.
6510,CHAPTER IX,
6511,CHAPTER IX,"What's the difficulty?--Why, they all want him to get up and make"
6512,CHAPTER IX,"speeches, or songs, or toasts; which is just the very thing he doesn't"
6513,CHAPTER IX,"want to do.  He is an old story, he says, and hates to show on these"
6514,CHAPTER IX,"occasions.  But they tease him, and coax him, and can't do without him,"
6515,CHAPTER IX,and feel all over his poor weak head until they get their fingers on the
6516,CHAPTER IX,"_fontanelle_, (the Professor will tell you what this means,--he says the"
6517,CHAPTER IX,"one at the top of the head always remains open in poets,) until, by"
6518,CHAPTER IX,"gentle pressure on that soft pulsating spot, they stupefy him to the"
6519,CHAPTER IX,point of acquiescence.
6520,CHAPTER IX,
6521,CHAPTER IX,"There are times, though, he says, when it is a pleasure, before going to"
6522,CHAPTER IX,"some agreeable meeting, to rush out into one's garden and clutch up a"
6523,CHAPTER IX,"handful of what grows there,--weeds and violets together,--not cutting"
6524,CHAPTER IX,"them off, but pulling them up by the roots with the brown earth they grow"
6525,CHAPTER IX,in sticking to them.  That's his idea of a post-prandial performance.
6526,CHAPTER IX,"Look here, now.  These verses I am going to read you, he tells me, were"
6527,CHAPTER IX,"pulled up by the roots just in that way, the other day.--Beautiful"
6528,CHAPTER IX,"entertainment,--names there on the plates that flow from all"
6529,CHAPTER IX,English-speaking tongues as familiarly as _and_ or _the_; entertainers
6530,CHAPTER IX,known wherever good poetry and fair title-pages are held in esteem; guest
6531,CHAPTER IX,"a kind-hearted, modest, genial, hopeful poet, who sings to the hearts of"
6532,CHAPTER IX,"his countrymen, the British people, the songs of good cheer which the"
6533,CHAPTER IX,"better days to come, as all honest souls trust and believe, will turn"
6534,CHAPTER IX,"into the prose of common life.  My friend, the Poet, says you must not"
6535,CHAPTER IX,read such a string of verses too literally.  If he trimmed it nicely
6536,CHAPTER IX,"below, you wouldn't see the roots, he says, and he likes to keep them,"
6537,CHAPTER IX,and a little of the soil clinging to them.
6538,CHAPTER IX,
6539,CHAPTER IX,"This is the farewell my friend, the Poet, read to his and our friend, the"

6616,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"When my friend, the Professor, found that my friend, the Poet, had been"
6617,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"coming out in this full-blown style, he got a little excited, as you may"
6618,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"have seen a canary, sometimes, when another strikes up.  The Professor"
6619,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"says he knows he can lecture, and thinks he can write verses.  At any"
6620,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"rate, he has often tried, and now he was determined to try again.  So"
6621,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"when some professional friends of his called him up, one day, after a"
6622,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"feast of reason and a regular ""freshet"" of soul which had lasted two or"
6623,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"three hours, he read them these verses.  He introduced them with a few"
6624,A GOOD TIME GOING!,"remarks, he told me, of which the only one he remembered was this: that"
6625,A GOOD TIME GOING!,he had rather write a single line which one among them should think worth

6925,"""MAN-TAMING EXTRAORDINARY.",The largest actual girth I have ever found at five feet from the ground

6928,"""MAN-TAMING EXTRAORDINARY.",the appearance of having been formed by the union of two trunks growing

6974,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"Photographs of New England Elms and other Trees, taken upon the Same"
6975,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"Scale of Magnitude.  With Letter-Press Descriptions, by a"
6976,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,Distinguished Literary Gentleman.  Boston -- -- & Co. 185..
6977,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
6978,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"The same camera should be used,--so far as possible,--at a fixed"
6979,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"distance.  Our friend, who has given us so many interesting figures in"
6980,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"his ""Trees of America,"" must not think this Prospectus invades his"
6981,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"province; a dozen portraits, with lively descriptions, would be a pretty"
6982,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"complement to his large work, which, so far as published, I find"
6983,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"excellent.  If my plan were carried out, and another series of a dozen"
6984,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,English trees photographed on the same scale the comparison would be
6985,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,charming.
6986,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
6987,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,It has always been a favorite idea of mine to bring the life of the Old
6988,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"and the New World face to face, by an accurate comparison of their"
6989,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"various types of organization.  We should begin with man, of course;"
6990,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,institute a large and exact comparison between the development of _la
6991,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"pianta umana_, as Alfieri called it, in different sections of each"
6992,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"country, in the different callings, at different ages, estimating height,"
6993,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"weigh, force by the dynamometer and the spirometer, and finishing off"
6994,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"with a series of typical photographs, giving the principal national"
6995,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,physiognomies.  Mr. Hutchinson has given us some excellent English data
6996,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,to begin with.
6997,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
6998,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,Then I would follow this up by contrasting the various parallel forms of
6999,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,life in the two continents.  Our naturalists have often referred to this
7000,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,incidentally or expressly; but the _animus_ of Nature in the two half
7001,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"globes of the planet is so momentous a point of interest to our race,"
7002,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,that it should be made a subject of express and elaborate study.  Go out
7003,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"with me into that walk which we call _the Mall_, and look at the English"
7004,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"and American elms.  The American elm is tall, graceful, slender-sprayed,"
7005,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"and drooping as if from languor.  The English elm is compact, robust,"
7006,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"holds its branches up, and carries its leaves for weeks longer than our"
7007,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,own native tree.
7008,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
7009,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"Is this typical of the creative force on the two sides of the ocean, or"
7010,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,not?  Nothing but a careful comparison through the whole realm of life
7011,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,can answer this question.
7012,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
7013,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,There is a parallelism without identity in the animal and vegetable life
7014,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"of the two continents, which favors the task of comparison in an"
7015,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"extraordinary manner.  Just as we have two trees alike in many ways, yet"
7016,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"not the same, both elms, yet easily distinguishable, just so we have a"
7017,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"complete flora and a fauna, which, parting from the same ideal, embody it"
7018,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,with various modifications.  Inventive power is the only quality of which
7019,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,the Creative Intelligence seems to be economical; just as with our
7020,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"largest human minds, that is the divinest of faculties, and the one that"
7021,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,most exhausts the mind which exercises it.  As the same patterns have
7022,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"very commonly been followed, we can see which is worked out in the"
7023,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"largest spirit, and determine the exact limitations under which the"
7024,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,Creator places the movement of life in all its manifestations in either
7025,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"locality.  We should find ourselves in a very false position, if it"
7026,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"should prove that Anglo-Saxons can't live here, but die out, if not kept"
7027,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"up by fresh supplies, as Dr. Knox and other more or less wise persons"
7028,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"have maintained.  It may turn out the other way, as I have heard one of"
7029,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"our literary celebrities argue,--and though I took the other side, I"
7030,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"liked his best,--that the American is the Englishman reinforced."
7031,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
7032,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,--Will you walk out and look at those elms with me after breakfast?--I
7033,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,said to the schoolmistress.
7034,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,
7035,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"[I am not going to tell lies about it, and say that she blushed,--as I"
7036,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"suppose she ought to have done, at such a tremendous piece of gallantry"
7037,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"as that was for our boarding-house.  On the contrary, she turned a little"
7038,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"pale,--but smiled brightly and said,--Yes, with pleasure, but she must"
7039,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,walk towards her school.--She went for her bonnet.--The old gentleman
7040,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"opposite followed her with his eyes, and said he wished he was a young"
7041,SYLVA NOVANGLICA.,"fellow.  Presently she came down, looking very pretty in her"

7051,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"she was ten minutes early, so she could go round."
7052,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7053,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,We walked under Mr. Paddock's row of English elms.  The gray squirrels
7054,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"were out looking for their breakfasts, and one of them came toward us in"
7055,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"light, soft, intermittent leaps, until he was close to the rail of the"
7056,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,burial-ground.  He was on a grave with a broad blue-slate-stone at its
7057,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"head, and a shrub growing on it.  The stone said this was the grave of a"
7058,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"young man who was the son of an Honorable gentleman, and who died a"
7059,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"hundred years ago and more.--Oh, yes, _died_,--with a small triangular"
7060,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"mark in one breast, and another smaller opposite, in his back, where"
7061,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,another young man's rapier had slid through his body; and so he lay down
7062,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"out there on the Common, and was found cold the next morning, with the"
7063,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,night-dews and the death-dews mingled on his forehead.
7064,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7065,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Let us have one look at poor Benjamin's grave,--said I.--His bones lie"
7066,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"where his body was laid so long ago, and where the stone says they"
7067,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"lie,--which is more than can be said of most of the tenants of this and"
7068,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,several other burial-grounds.
7069,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7070,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,[The most accursed act of Vandalism ever committed within my knowledge
7071,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,was the uprooting of the ancient gravestones in three at least of our
7072,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"city burialgrounds, and one at least just outside the city, and planting"
7073,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,them in rows to suit the taste for symmetry of the perpetrators.  Many
7074,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"years ago, when this disgraceful process was going on under my eyes, I"
7075,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,addressed an indignant remonstrance to a leading journal.  I suppose it
7076,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"was deficient in literary elegance, or too warm in its language; for no"
7077,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"notice was taken of it, and the hyena-horror was allowed to complete"
7078,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,itself in the face of daylight.  I have never got over it.  The bones of
7079,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"my own ancestors, being entombed, lie beneath their own tablet; but the"
7080,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"upright stones have been shuffled about like chessmen, and nothing short"
7081,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,of the Day of Judgment will tell whose dust lies beneath any of those
7082,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"records, meant by affection to mark one small spot as sacred to some"
7083,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,cherished memory.  Shame! shame! shame!--that is all I can say.  It was
7084,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"on public thoroughfares, under the eye of authority, that this infamy was"
7085,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,enacted.  The red Indians would have known better; the selectmen of an
7086,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,African kraal-village would have had more respect for their ancestors.  I
7087,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"should like to see the gravestones which have been disturbed all removed,"
7088,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"and the ground levelled, leaving the flat tombstones; epitaphs were never"
7089,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"famous for truth, but the old reproach of ""Here _lies_"" never had such a"
7090,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"wholesale illustration as in these outraged burial-places, where the"
7091,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"stone does lie above, and the bones do not lie beneath.]"
7092,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7093,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Stop before we turn away, and breathe a woman's sigh over poor Benjamin's"
7094,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"dust.  Love killed him, I think.  Twenty years old, and out there"
7095,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"fighting another young fellow on the Common, in the cool of that old July"
7096,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"evening;--yes, there must have been love at the bottom of it."
7097,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7098,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"The schoolmistress dropped a rosebud she had in her hand, through the"
7099,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"rails, upon the grave of Benjamin Woodbridge.  That was all her comment"
7100,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,upon what I told her.--How women love Love! said I;--but she did not
7101,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,speak.
7102,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7103,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,We came opposite the head of a place or court running eastward from the
7104,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"main street.--Look down there,--I said,--My friend the Professor lived in"
7105,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"that house at the left hand, next the further corner, for years and"
7106,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"years.  He died out of it, the other day.--Died?--said the"
7107,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"schoolmistress.--Certainly,--said I.--We die out of houses, just as we"
7108,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,die out of our bodies.  A commercial smash kills a hundred men's houses
7109,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"for them, as a railroad crash kills their mortal frames and drives out"
7110,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the immortal tenants.  Men sicken of houses until at last they quit them,"
7111,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,as the soul leaves its body when it is tired of its infirmities.  The
7112,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"body has been called ""the house we live in""; the house is quite as much"
7113,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,the body we live in.  Shall I tell you some things the Professor said the
7114,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,other day?--Do!--said the schoolmistress.
7115,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7116,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"A man's body,--said the Professor,--is whatever is occupied by his will"
7117,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"and his sensibility.  The small room down there, where I wrote those"
7118,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"papers you remember reading, was much more a portion of my body than a"
7119,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,paralytic's senseless and motionless arm or leg is of his.
7120,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7121,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"The soul of a man has a series of concentric envelopes round it, like the"
7122,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"core of an onion, or the innermost of a nest of boxes.  First, he has his"
7123,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"natural garment of flesh and blood.  Then, his artificial integuments,"
7124,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"with their true skin of solid stuffs, their cuticle of lighter tissues,"
7125,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"and their variously-tinted pigments.  Thirdly, his domicile, be it a"
7126,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"single chamber or a stately mansion.  And then, the whole visible world,"
7127,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,in which Time buttons him up as in a loose outside wrapper.
7128,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7129,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"You shall observe,--the Professor said,--for, like Mr. John Hunter and"
7130,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"other great men, he brings in that _shall_ with great effect"
7131,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"sometimes,--you shall observe that a man's clothing or series of"
7132,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,envelopes does after a certain time mould itself upon his individual
7133,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"nature.  We know this of our hats, and are always reminded of it when we"
7134,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,happen to put them on wrong side foremost.  We soon find that the beaver
7135,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"is a hollow cast of the skull, with all its irregular bumps and"
7136,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"depressions.  Just so all that clothes a man, even to the blue sky which"
7137,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"caps his head,--a little loosely,--shapes itself to fit each particular"
7138,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"being beneath it.  Farmers, sailors, astronomers, poets, lovers,"
7139,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"condemned criminals, all find it different, according to the eyes with"
7140,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,which they severally look.
7141,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7142,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,But our houses shape themselves palpably on our inner and outer natures.
7143,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,See a householder breaking up and you will be sure of it.  There is a
7144,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,shell-fish which builds all manner of smaller shells into the walls of
7145,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,its own.  A house is never a home until we have crusted it with the
7146,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,spoils of a hundred lives besides those of our own past.  See what these
7147,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,are and you can tell what the occupant is.
7148,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7149,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"I had no idea,--said the Professor,--until I pulled up my domestic"
7150,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"establishment the other day, what an enormous quantity of roots I had"
7151,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"been making during the years I was planted there.  Why, there wasn't a"
7152,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,nook or a corner that some fibre had not worked its way into; and when I
7153,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"gave the last wrench, each of them seemed to shriek like a mandrake, as"
7154,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,it broke its hold and came away.
7155,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7156,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"There is nothing that happens, you know, which must not inevitably, and"
7157,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"which does not actually, photograph itself in every conceivable aspect"
7158,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,and in all dimensions.  The infinite galleries of the Past await but one
7159,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,brief process and all their pictures will be called out and fixed
7160,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,forever.  We had a curious illustration of the great fact on a very
7161,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"humble scale.  When a certain bookcase, long standing in one place, for"
7162,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"which it was built, was removed, there was the exact image on the wall of"
7163,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the whole, and of many of its portions.  But in the midst of this picture"
7164,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"was another,--the precise outline of a map which had hung on the wall"
7165,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,before the bookcase was built.  We had all forgotten everything about the
7166,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"map until we saw its photograph on the wall.  Then we remembered it, as"
7167,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,some day or other we may remember a sin which has been built over and
7168,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"covered up, when this lower universe is pulled away from before the wall"
7169,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"of Infinity, where the wrong-doing stands self-recorded."
7170,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
7171,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"The Professor lived in that house a long time,--not twenty years, but"
7172,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"pretty near it.  When he entered that door, two shadows glided over the"
7173,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,threshold; five lingered in the doorway when he passed through it for the
7174,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"last time,--and one of the shadows was claimed by its owner to be longer"
7175,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,than his own.  What changes he saw in that quiet place!  Death rained
7176,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"through every roof but his; children came into life, grew to maturity,"
7177,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"wedded, faded away, threw themselves away; the whole drama of life was"
7178,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"played in that stock-company's theatre of a dozen houses, one of which"
7179,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"was his, and no deep sorrow or severe calamity ever entered his dwelling."
7180,MY FIRST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Peace be to those walls, forever,--the Professor said,--for the many"

7413,CHAPTER XI,"[The company looked a little flustered one morning when I came in,--so"
7414,CHAPTER XI,"much so, that I inquired of my neighbor, the divinity-student,) what had"
7415,CHAPTER XI,been going on.  It appears that the young fellow whom they call John had
7416,CHAPTER XI,taken advantage of my being a little late (I having been rather longer
7417,CHAPTER XI,than usual dressing that morning) to circulate several questions
7418,CHAPTER XI,"involving a quibble or play upon words,--in short, containing that"
7419,CHAPTER XI,"indignity to the human understanding, condemned in the passages from the"
7420,CHAPTER XI,distinguished moralist of the last century and the illustrious historian
7421,CHAPTER XI,"of the present, which I cited on a former occasion, and known as a _pun_."
7422,CHAPTER XI,"After breakfast, one of the boarders handed me a small roll of paper"
7423,CHAPTER XI,containing some of the questions and their answers.  I subjoin two or
7424,CHAPTER XI,"three of them, to show what a tendency there is to frivolity and"
7425,CHAPTER XI,"meaningless talk in young persons of a certain sort, when not restrained"
7426,CHAPTER XI,"by the presence of more reflective natures.--It was asked, ""Why tertian"
7427,CHAPTER XI,"and quartan fevers were like certain short-lived insects.""  Some"
7428,CHAPTER XI,interesting physiological relation would be naturally suggested.  The
7429,CHAPTER XI,"inquirer blushes to find that the answer is in the paltry equivocation,"
7430,CHAPTER XI,"that they _skip_ a day or two.--""Why an Englishman must go to the"
7431,CHAPTER XI,"Continent to weaken his grog or punch.""  The answer proves to have no"
7432,CHAPTER XI,"relation whatever to the temperance-movement, as no better reason is"
7433,CHAPTER XI,"given than that island--(or, as it is absurdly written, _ile and_) water"
7434,CHAPTER XI,"won't mix.--But when I came to the next question and its answer, I felt"
7435,CHAPTER XI,"that patience ceased to be a virtue.  ""Why an onion is like a piano"" is a"
7436,CHAPTER XI,query that a person of sensibility would be slow to propose; but that in
7437,CHAPTER XI,an educated community an individual could be found to answer it in these
7438,CHAPTER XI,"words,--""Because it smell odious,"" _quasi_, it's melodious,--is not"
7439,CHAPTER XI,"credible, but too true.  I can show you the paper."
7440,CHAPTER XI,
7441,CHAPTER XI,"Dear reader, I beg your pardon for repeating such things.  I know most"

7507,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Where he could find the strongest oak,"
7508,A LOGICAL STORY.,"That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--"
7509,A LOGICAL STORY.,That was for spokes and floor and sills;
7510,A LOGICAL STORY.,He sent for lancewood to make the thills;
7511,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees;"
7512,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,"
7513,A LOGICAL STORY.,But lasts like iron for things like these;
7514,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The hubs of logs from the ""Settler's ellum,""--"
7515,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em,"
7516,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Never an axe had seen their chips,"
7517,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the wedges flew from between their lips,"
7518,A LOGICAL STORY.,Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
7519,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,"
7520,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,"
7521,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Steel of the finest, bright and blue;"
7522,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;"
7523,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide"
7524,A LOGICAL STORY.,Found in the pit when the tanner died.
7525,A LOGICAL STORY.,"That was the way he ""put her through.""--"
7526,A LOGICAL STORY.,"""There!"" said the Deacon, ""naow she'll dew."""
7527,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7528,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Do!  I tell you, I father guess"
7529,A LOGICAL STORY.,"She was a wonder, and nothing less!"
7530,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,"
7531,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Deacon and deaconess dropped away,"
7532,A LOGICAL STORY.,Children and grand-children--where were they?
7533,A LOGICAL STORY.,But there stood the stout old one-hoss-shay
7534,A LOGICAL STORY.,As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!
7535,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7536,A LOGICAL STORY.,EIGHTEEN HUNDRED;--it came and found
7537,A LOGICAL STORY.,The Deacon's Masterpiece strong and sound.
7538,A LOGICAL STORY.,Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--
7539,A LOGICAL STORY.,"""Hahnsum kerridge"" they called it then."
7540,A LOGICAL STORY.,Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--
7541,A LOGICAL STORY.,Running as usual; much the same.
7542,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Thirty and forty at last arrive,"
7543,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And then come fifty, and FIFTY-FIVE."
7544,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7545,A LOGICAL STORY.,Little of all we value here
7546,A LOGICAL STORY.,Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
7547,A LOGICAL STORY.,Without both feeling and looking queer.
7548,A LOGICAL STORY.,"In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,"
7549,A LOGICAL STORY.,"So far as I know, but a tree and truth."
7550,A LOGICAL STORY.,(This is a moral that runs at large;
7551,A LOGICAL STORY.,Take it.--You're welcome.--No extra charge.)
7552,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7553,A LOGICAL STORY.,"FIRST OF NOVEMBER,--the Earthquake-day.--"
7554,A LOGICAL STORY.,There are traces of age in the one-hoss-shay.
7555,A LOGICAL STORY.,"A general flavor of mild decay,"
7556,A LOGICAL STORY.,"But nothing local, as one may say."
7557,A LOGICAL STORY.,"There couldn't be,--for the Deacon's art"
7558,A LOGICAL STORY.,Had made it so like in every part
7559,A LOGICAL STORY.,That there wasn't a chance for one to start.
7560,A LOGICAL STORY.,"For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,"
7561,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the floor was just as strong as the sills,"
7562,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the panels just as strong as the floor,"
7563,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the whippletree neither less nor more,"
7564,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,"
7565,A LOGICAL STORY.,And spring and axle and hub _encore_.
7566,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And yet, _as a whole_, it is past a doubt"
7567,A LOGICAL STORY.,In another hour it will be _worn out_!
7568,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7569,A LOGICAL STORY.,"First of November, 'Fifty-five!"
7570,A LOGICAL STORY.,This morning the parson takes a drive.
7571,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Now, small boys, get out of the way!"
7572,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Here comes the wonderful one-horse-shay,"
7573,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay."
7574,A LOGICAL STORY.,"""Huddup!"" said the parson.--Off went they."
7575,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7576,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The parson was working his Sunday's text,--"
7577,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Had got to _fifthly_, and stopped perplexed"
7578,A LOGICAL STORY.,At what the--Moses--was coming next.
7579,A LOGICAL STORY.,"All at once the horse stood still,"
7580,A LOGICAL STORY.,Close by the meet'n-house on the hill.
7581,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--First a shiver, and then a thrill,"
7582,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Then something decidedly like a spill,--"
7583,A LOGICAL STORY.,"And the parson was sitting upon a rock,"
7584,A LOGICAL STORY.,"At half-past nine by the meet'n-house clock,--"
7585,A LOGICAL STORY.,Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!
7586,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--What do you think the parson found,"
7587,A LOGICAL STORY.,When he got up and stared around?
7588,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,"
7589,A LOGICAL STORY.,As if it had been to the mill and ground!
7590,A LOGICAL STORY.,"You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,"
7591,A LOGICAL STORY.,"How it went to pieces all at once,--"
7592,A LOGICAL STORY.,"All at once, and nothing first,--"
7593,A LOGICAL STORY.,Just as bubbles do when they burst.
7594,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7595,A LOGICAL STORY.,End of the wonderful one-hoss-shay.
7596,A LOGICAL STORY.,Logic is logic.  That's all I say.
7597,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7598,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--I think there is one habit,--I said to our company a day or two"
7599,A LOGICAL STORY.,afterwards--worse than that of punning.  It is the gradual substitution
7600,A LOGICAL STORY.,of cant or flash terms for words which truly characterize their objects.
7601,A LOGICAL STORY.,I have known several very genteel idiots whose whole vocabulary had
7602,A LOGICAL STORY.,deliquesced into some half dozen expressions.  All things fell into one
7603,A LOGICAL STORY.,"of two great categories,--_fast_ or _slow_.  Man's chief end was to be a"
7604,A LOGICAL STORY.,"_brick_.  When the great calamities of life overtook their friends, these"
7605,A LOGICAL STORY.,last were spoken of as being a _good deal cut up_.  Nine-tenths of human
7606,A LOGICAL STORY.,"existence were summed up in the single word, _bore_.  These expressions"
7607,A LOGICAL STORY.,come to be the algebraic symbols of minds which have grown too weak or
7608,A LOGICAL STORY.,indolent to discriminate.  They are the blank checks of intellectual
7609,A LOGICAL STORY.,bankruptcy;--you may fill them up with what idea you like; it makes no
7610,A LOGICAL STORY.,"difference, for there are no funds in the treasury upon which they are"
7611,A LOGICAL STORY.,drawn.  Colleges and good-for-nothing smoking-clubs are the places where
7612,A LOGICAL STORY.,these conversational fungi spring up most luxuriantly.  Don't think I
7613,A LOGICAL STORY.,undervalue the proper use and application of a cant word or phrase.  It
7614,A LOGICAL STORY.,"adds piquancy to conversation, as a mushroom does to a sauce.  But it is"
7615,A LOGICAL STORY.,"no better than a toadstool, odious to the sense and poisonous to the"
7616,A LOGICAL STORY.,"intellect, when it spawns itself all over the talk of men and youths"
7617,A LOGICAL STORY.,"capable of talking, as it sometimes does.  As we hear flash phraseology,"
7618,A LOGICAL STORY.,"it is commonly the dishwater from the washings of English dandyism,"
7619,A LOGICAL STORY.,"school-boy or full-grown, wrung out of a three-volume novel which had"
7620,A LOGICAL STORY.,"sopped it up, or decanted from the pictured urn of Mr. Verdant Green, and"
7621,A LOGICAL STORY.,diluted to suit the provincial climate.
7622,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7623,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--The young fellow called John spoke up sharply and said, it was ""rum"" to"
7624,A LOGICAL STORY.,"hear me ""pitchin' into fellers"" for ""goin' it in the slang line,"" when I"
7625,A LOGICAL STORY.,used all the flash words myself just when I pleased.
7626,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7627,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--I replied with my usual forbearance.--Certainly, to give up the"
7628,A LOGICAL STORY.,"algebraic symbol, because _a_ or _b_ is often a cover for ideal nihility,"
7629,A LOGICAL STORY.,would be unwise.  I have heard a child laboring to express a certain
7630,A LOGICAL STORY.,"condition, involving a hitherto undescribed sensation (as it supposed,)"
7631,A LOGICAL STORY.,all of which could have been sufficiently explained by the
7632,A LOGICAL STORY.,"participle--_bored_.  I have seen a country-clergyman, with a one-story"
7633,A LOGICAL STORY.,"intellect and a one-horse vocabulary, who has consumed his valuable time"
7634,A LOGICAL STORY.,"(and mine) freely, in developing an opinion of a brother-minister's"
7635,A LOGICAL STORY.,discourse which would have been abundantly characterized by a
7636,A LOGICAL STORY.,peach-down-lipped sophomore in the one word--_slow_.  Let us
7637,A LOGICAL STORY.,"discriminate, and be shy of absolute proscription.  I am omniverbivorous"
7638,A LOGICAL STORY.,"by nature and training.  Passing by such words as are poisonous, I can"
7639,A LOGICAL STORY.,"swallow most others, and chew such as I cannot swallow."
7640,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7641,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Dandies are not good for much, but they are good for something.  They"
7642,A LOGICAL STORY.,invent or keep in circulation those conversational blank checks or
7643,A LOGICAL STORY.,"counters just spoken of, which intellectual capitalists may sometimes"
7644,A LOGICAL STORY.,"find it worth their while to borrow of them.  They are useful, too, in"
7645,A LOGICAL STORY.,"keeping up the standard of dress, which, but for them, would deteriorate,"
7646,A LOGICAL STORY.,"and become, what some old fools would have it, a matter of convenience,"
7647,A LOGICAL STORY.,"and not of taste and art.  Yes, I like dandies well enough,--on one"
7648,A LOGICAL STORY.,condition.
7649,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7650,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--What is that, Sir?--said the divinity-student."
7651,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7652,A LOGICAL STORY.,--That they have pluck.  I find that lies at the bottom of all true
7653,A LOGICAL STORY.,"dandyism.  A little boy dressed up very fine, who puts his finger in his"
7654,A LOGICAL STORY.,"mouth and takes to crying, if other boys make fun of him, looks very"
7655,A LOGICAL STORY.,"silly.  But if he turns red in the face and knotty in the fists, and"
7656,A LOGICAL STORY.,"makes an example of the biggest of his assailants, throwing off his fine"
7657,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Leghorn and his thickly-buttoned jacket, if necessary, to consummate the"
7658,A LOGICAL STORY.,"act of justice, his small toggery takes on the splendors of the crested"
7659,A LOGICAL STORY.,helmet that frightened Astyanax.  You remember that the Duke said his
7660,A LOGICAL STORY.,"dandy officers were his best officers.  The ""Sunday blood,"" the"
7661,A LOGICAL STORY.,"super-superb sartorial equestrian of our annual Fast-day, is not imposing"
7662,A LOGICAL STORY.,or dangerous.  But such fellows as Brummel and D'Orsay and Byron are not
7663,A LOGICAL STORY.,"to be snubbed quite so easily.  Look out for ""la main de fer sous le gant"
7664,A LOGICAL STORY.,"de velours,"" (which I printed in English the other day without"
7665,A LOGICAL STORY.,"quotation-marks, thinking whether any _scarabaeus criticus_ would add"
7666,A LOGICAL STORY.,"this to his globe and roll in glory with it into the newspapers,--which"
7667,A LOGICAL STORY.,"he didn't do it, in the charming pleonasm of the London language, and"
7668,A LOGICAL STORY.,therefore I claim the sole merit of exposing the same.)  A good many
7669,A LOGICAL STORY.,powerful and dangerous people have had a decided dash of dandyism about
7670,A LOGICAL STORY.,"them.  There was Alcibiades, the ""curled son of Clinias,"" an accomplished"
7671,A LOGICAL STORY.,"young man, but what would be called a ""swell"" in these days.  There was"
7672,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Aristoteles, a very distinguished writer, of whom you have heard,--a"
7673,A LOGICAL STORY.,"philosopher, in short, whom it took centuries to learn, centuries to"
7674,A LOGICAL STORY.,"unlearn, and is now going to take a generation or more to learn over"
7675,A LOGICAL STORY.,"again.  Regular dandy, he was.  So was Marcus Antonius; and though he"
7676,A LOGICAL STORY.,"lost his game, he played for big stakes, and it wasn't his dandyism that"
7677,A LOGICAL STORY.,spoiled his chance.  Petrarca was not to be despised as a scholar or a
7678,A LOGICAL STORY.,"poet, but he was one of the same sort.  So was Sir Humphrey Davy; so was"
7679,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Lord Palmerston, formerly, if I am not forgetful.  Yes,--a dandy is good"
7680,A LOGICAL STORY.,for something as such; and dandies such as I was just speaking of have
7681,A LOGICAL STORY.,"rocked this planet like a cradle,--aye, and left it swinging to this"
7682,A LOGICAL STORY.,"day.--Still, if I were you, I wouldn't go to the tailor's, on the"
7683,A LOGICAL STORY.,"strength of these remarks, and run up a long bill which will render"
7684,A LOGICAL STORY.,"pockets a superfluity in your next suit.  _Elegans_ ""_nascitur_, _non"
7685,A LOGICAL STORY.,"fit_.""  A man is born a dandy, as he is born a poet.  There are heads"
7686,A LOGICAL STORY.,that can't wear hats; there are necks that can't fit cravats; there are
7687,A LOGICAL STORY.,jaws that can't fill out collars--(Willis touched this last point in one
7688,A LOGICAL STORY.,"of his earlier ambrotypes, if I remember rightly); there are _tournures_"
7689,A LOGICAL STORY.,"nothing can humanize, and movements nothing can subdue to the gracious"
7690,A LOGICAL STORY.,suavity or elegant languor or stately serenity which belong to different
7691,A LOGICAL STORY.,styles of dandyism.
7692,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7693,A LOGICAL STORY.,"We are forming an aristocracy, as you may observe, in this country,--not"
7694,A LOGICAL STORY.,"a _gratia-Dei_, nor a _juredivino_ one,--but a _de-facto_ upper stratum"
7695,A LOGICAL STORY.,"of being, which floats over the turbid waves of common life like the"
7696,A LOGICAL STORY.,iridescent film you may have seen spreading over the water about our
7697,A LOGICAL STORY.,"wharves,--very splendid, though its origin may have been tar, tallow,"
7698,A LOGICAL STORY.,"train-oil, or other such unctuous commodities.  I say, then, we are"
7699,A LOGICAL STORY.,"forming an aristocracy; and, transitory as its individual life often is,"
7700,A LOGICAL STORY.,"it maintains itself tolerably, as a whole.  Of course, money is its"
7701,A LOGICAL STORY.,corner-stone.  But now observe this.  Money kept for two or three
7702,A LOGICAL STORY.,"generations transforms a race,--I don't mean merely in manners and"
7703,A LOGICAL STORY.,"hereditary culture, but in blood and bone.  Money buys air and sunshine,"
7704,A LOGICAL STORY.,"in which children grow up more kindly, of course, than in close, back"
7705,A LOGICAL STORY.,"streets; it buys country-places to give them happy and healthy summers,"
7706,A LOGICAL STORY.,"good nursing, good doctoring, and the best cuts of beef and mutton.  When"
7707,A LOGICAL STORY.,"the spring-chickens come to market--I beg your pardon,--that is not what"
7708,A LOGICAL STORY.,I was going to speak of.  As the young females of each successive season
7709,A LOGICAL STORY.,"come on, the finest specimens among them, other things being equal, are"
7710,A LOGICAL STORY.,apt to attract those who can afford the expensive luxury of beauty.  The
7711,A LOGICAL STORY.,physical character of the next generation rises in consequence.  It is
7712,A LOGICAL STORY.,plain that certain families have in this way acquired an elevated type of
7713,A LOGICAL STORY.,"face and figure, and that in a small circle of city-connections one may"
7714,A LOGICAL STORY.,sometimes find models of both sexes which one of the rural counties would
7715,A LOGICAL STORY.,find it hard to match from all its townships put together.  Because there
7716,A LOGICAL STORY.,"is a good deal of running down, of degeneration and waste of life, among"
7717,A LOGICAL STORY.,"the richer classes, you must not overlook the equally obvious fact I have"
7718,A LOGICAL STORY.,"just spoken of,--which in one or two generations more will be, I think,"
7719,A LOGICAL STORY.,much more patent than just now.
7720,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7721,A LOGICAL STORY.,The weak point in our chryso-aristocracy is the same I have alluded to in
7722,A LOGICAL STORY.,"connection with cheap dandyism.  Its thorough manhood, its high-caste"
7723,A LOGICAL STORY.,"gallantry, are not so manifest as the plate-glass of its windows and the"
7724,A LOGICAL STORY.,more or less legitimate heraldry of its coach-panels.  It is very curious
7725,A LOGICAL STORY.,to observe of how small account military folks are held among our
7726,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Northern people.  Our young men must gild their spurs, but they need not"
7727,A LOGICAL STORY.,win them.  The equal division of property keeps the younger sons of rich
7728,A LOGICAL STORY.,people above the necessity of military service.  Thus the army loses an
7729,A LOGICAL STORY.,"element of refinement, and the moneyed upper class forgets what it is to"
7730,A LOGICAL STORY.,count heroism among its virtues.  Still I don't believe in any
7731,A LOGICAL STORY.,aristocracy without pluck as its backbone.  Ours may show it when the
7732,A LOGICAL STORY.,"time comes, if it ever does come."
7733,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7734,A LOGICAL STORY.,--These United States furnish the greatest market for intellectual _green
7735,A LOGICAL STORY.,"fruit_ of all the places in the world.  I think so, at any rate.  The"
7736,A LOGICAL STORY.,demand for intellectual labor is so enormous and the market so far from
7737,A LOGICAL STORY.,"nice, that young talent is apt to fare like unripe gooseberries,--get"
7738,A LOGICAL STORY.,plucked to make a fool of.  Think of a country which buys eighty thousand
7739,A LOGICAL STORY.,"copies of the ""Proverbial Philosophy,"" while the author's admiring"
7740,A LOGICAL STORY.,countrymen have been buying twelve thousand!  How can one let his fruit
7741,A LOGICAL STORY.,"hang in the sun until it gets fully ripe, while there are eighty thousand"
7742,A LOGICAL STORY.,such hungry mouths ready to swallow it and proclaim its praises?
7743,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Consequently, there never was such a collection of crude pippins and"
7744,A LOGICAL STORY.,half-grown windfalls as our native literature displays among its fruits.
7745,A LOGICAL STORY.,"There are literary green-groceries at every corner, which will buy"
7746,A LOGICAL STORY.,"anything, from a button-pear to a pine-apple.  It takes a long"
7747,A LOGICAL STORY.,apprenticeship to train a whole people to reading and writing.  The
7748,A LOGICAL STORY.,temptation of money and fame is too great for young people.  Do I not
7749,A LOGICAL STORY.,remember that glorious moment when the late Mr.--we won't say
7750,A LOGICAL STORY.,"who,--editor of the--we won't say what, offered me the sum of fifty cents"
7751,A LOGICAL STORY.,_per_ double-columned quarto page for shaking my young boughs over his
7752,A LOGICAL STORY.,foolscap apron?  Was it not an intoxicating vision of gold and glory?  I
7753,A LOGICAL STORY.,"should doubtless have revelled in its wealth and splendor, but for"
7754,A LOGICAL STORY.,learning that the _fifty cents_ was to be considered a rhetorical
7755,A LOGICAL STORY.,"embellishment, and by no means a literal expression of past fact or"
7756,A LOGICAL STORY.,present intention.
7757,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7758,A LOGICAL STORY.,--Beware of making your moral staple consist of the negative virtues.  It
7759,A LOGICAL STORY.,"is good to abstain, and teach others to abstain, from all that is sinful"
7760,A LOGICAL STORY.,or hurtful.  But making a business of it leads to emaciation of
7761,A LOGICAL STORY.,"character, unless one feeds largely also on the more nutritious diet of"
7762,A LOGICAL STORY.,active sympathetic benevolence.
7763,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7764,A LOGICAL STORY.,"--I don't believe one word of what you are saying,--spoke up the angular"
7765,A LOGICAL STORY.,female in black bombazine.
7766,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7767,A LOGICAL STORY.,"I am sorry you disbelieve it, Madam,--I said, and added softly to my next"
7768,A LOGICAL STORY.,"neighbor,--but you prove it."
7769,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7770,A LOGICAL STORY.,"The young fellow sitting near me winked; and the divinity-student said,"
7771,A LOGICAL STORY.,"in an undertone,--_Optime dictum_."
7772,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7773,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Your talking Latin,--said I,--reminds me of an odd trick of one of my old"
7774,A LOGICAL STORY.,"tutors.  He read so much of that language, that his English half turned"
7775,A LOGICAL STORY.,"into it.  He got caught in town, one hot summer, in pretty close"
7776,A LOGICAL STORY.,"quarters, and wrote, or began to write, a series of city pastorals."
7777,A LOGICAL STORY.,"Eclogues he called them, and meant to have published them by"
7778,A LOGICAL STORY.,"subscription.  I remember some of his verses, if you want to hear"
7779,A LOGICAL STORY.,"them.--You, Sir, (addressing myself to the divinity-student,) and all"
7780,A LOGICAL STORY.,"such as have been through college, or, what is the same thing, received"
7781,A LOGICAL STORY.,"an honorary degree, will understand them without a dictionary.  The old"
7782,A LOGICAL STORY.,"man had a great deal to say about ""aestivation,"" as he called it, in"
7783,A LOGICAL STORY.,"opposition, as one might say, to _hibernation_.  Intramural aestivation,"
7784,A LOGICAL STORY.,"or town-life in summer, he would say, is a peculiar form of suspended"
7785,A LOGICAL STORY.,"existence, or semi-asphyxia.  One wakes up from it about the beginning of"
7786,A LOGICAL STORY.,the last week in September.  This is what I remember of his poem:--
7787,A LOGICAL STORY.,
7788,AESTIVATION.,AESTIVATION.
7789,AESTIVATION.,
7790,AESTIVATION.,"_An Unpublished Poem_, _by my late Latin Tutor_"
7791,AESTIVATION.,
7792,AESTIVATION.,IN candent ire the solar splendor flames;
7793,AESTIVATION.,"The foles, languescent, pend from arid rames;"
7794,AESTIVATION.,"His humid front the cive, anheling, wipes,"
7795,AESTIVATION.,And dreams of erring on ventiferous ripes.
7796,AESTIVATION.,
7797,AESTIVATION.,"How dulce to vive occult to mortal eyes,"
7798,AESTIVATION.,"Dorm on the herb with none to supervise,"
7799,AESTIVATION.,"Carp the suave berries from the crescent vine,"
7800,AESTIVATION.,And bibe the flow from longicaudate kine!
7801,AESTIVATION.,
7802,AESTIVATION.,"To me, alas! no verdurous visions come,"
7803,AESTIVATION.,"Save yon exiguous pool's conferva-scum,--"
7804,AESTIVATION.,No concave vast repeats the tender hue
7805,AESTIVATION.,That laves my milk-jug with celestial blue!
7806,AESTIVATION.,
7807,AESTIVATION.,Me wretched!  Let me curr to quercine shades
7808,AESTIVATION.,"Effund your albid hausts, lactiferous maids!"
7809,AESTIVATION.,"Oh, might I vole to some umbrageous clump,--"
7810,AESTIVATION.,"Depart,--be off,--excede,--evade,--erump!"
7811,AESTIVATION.,
7812,AESTIVATION.,"--I have lived by the sea-shore and by the mountains.--No, I am not going"
7813,AESTIVATION.,to say which is best.  The one where your place is is the best for you.
7814,AESTIVATION.,"But this difference there is: you can domesticate mountains, but the sea"
7815,AESTIVATION.,"is _ferae naturae_.  You may have a hut, or know the owner of one, on the"
7816,AESTIVATION.,"mountain-side; you see a light half-way up its ascent in the evening, and"
7817,AESTIVATION.,"you know there is a home, and you might share it.  You have noted certain"
7818,AESTIVATION.,"trees, perhaps; you know the particular zone where the hemlocks look so"
7819,AESTIVATION.,"black in October, when the maples and beeches have faded.  All its"
7820,AESTIVATION.,reliefs and intaglios have electrotyped themselves in the medallions that
7821,AESTIVATION.,hang round the walls of your memory's chamber.--The sea remembers
7822,AESTIVATION.,"nothing.  It is feline.  It licks your feet,--its huge flanks purr very"
7823,AESTIVATION.,"pleasantly for you; but it will crack your bones and eat you, for all"
7824,AESTIVATION.,"that, and wipe the crimsoned foam from its jaws as if nothing had"
7825,AESTIVATION.,happened.  The mountains give their lost children berries and water; the
7826,AESTIVATION.,"sea mocks their thirst and lets them die.  The mountains have a grand,"
7827,AESTIVATION.,"stupid, lovable tranquillity; the sea has a fascinating, treacherous"
7828,AESTIVATION.,"intelligence.  The mountains lie about like huge ruminants, their broad"
7829,AESTIVATION.,"backs awful to look upon, but safe to handle.  The sea smooths its silver"
7830,AESTIVATION.,"scales until you cannot see their joints,--but their shining is that of a"
7831,AESTIVATION.,"snake's belly, after all.--In deeper suggestiveness I find as great a"
7832,AESTIVATION.,difference.  The mountains dwarf mankind and foreshorten the procession
7833,AESTIVATION.,of its long generations.  The sea drowns out humanity and time; it has no
7834,AESTIVATION.,"sympathy with either; for it belongs to eternity, and of that it sings"
7835,AESTIVATION.,its monotonous song forever and ever.
7836,AESTIVATION.,
7837,AESTIVATION.,Yet I should love to have a little box by the seashore.  I should love to
7838,AESTIVATION.,"gaze out on the wild feline element from a front window of my own, just"
7839,AESTIVATION.,"as I should love to look on a caged panther, and see it, stretch its"
7840,AESTIVATION.,"shining length, and then curl over and lap its smooth sides, and"
7841,AESTIVATION.,by-and-by begin to lash itself into rage and show its white teeth and
7842,AESTIVATION.,"spring at its bars, and howl the cry of its mad, but, to me, harmless"
7843,AESTIVATION.,"fury.--And then,--to look at it with that inward eye,--who does not love"
7844,AESTIVATION.,"to shuffle off time and its concerns, at intervals,--to forget who is"
7845,AESTIVATION.,"President and who is Governor, what race he belongs to, what language he"
7846,AESTIVATION.,"speaks, which golden-headed nail of the firmament his particular"
7847,AESTIVATION.,"planetary system is hung upon, and listen to the great liquid metronome"
7848,AESTIVATION.,"as it beats its solemn measure, steadily swinging when the solo or duet"
7849,AESTIVATION.,"of human life began, and to swing just as steadily after the human chorus"
7850,AESTIVATION.,has died out and man is a fossil on its shores?
7851,AESTIVATION.,
7852,AESTIVATION.,"--What should decide one, in choosing a summer residence?--Constitution,"
7853,AESTIVATION.,"first of all.  How much snow could you melt in an hour, if you were"
7854,AESTIVATION.,planted in a hogshead of it?  Comfort is essential to enjoyment.  All
7855,AESTIVATION.,sensitive people should remember that persons in easy circumstances
7856,AESTIVATION.,"suffer much more cold in summer--that is, the warm half of the year--than"
7857,AESTIVATION.,"in winter, or the other half.  You must cut your climate to your"
7858,AESTIVATION.,"constitution, as much as your clothing to your shape.  After this,"
7859,AESTIVATION.,consult your taste and convenient.  But if you would be happy in
7860,AESTIVATION.,"Berkshire, you must carry mountains in your brain; and if you would enjoy"
7861,AESTIVATION.,"Nahant, you must have an ocean in your soul.  Nature plays at dominos"
7862,AESTIVATION.,"with you; you must match her piece, or she will never give it up to you."
7863,AESTIVATION.,
7864,AESTIVATION.,"--The schoolmistress said, in a rather mischievous way, that she was"
7865,AESTIVATION.,"afraid some minds or souls would be a little crowded, if they took in the"
7866,AESTIVATION.,Rocky Mountains or the Atlantic.
7867,AESTIVATION.,
7868,AESTIVATION.,"Have you ever read the little book called ""The Stars and the"
7869,AESTIVATION.,"Earth?""--said I.--Have you seen the Declaration of Independence"
7870,AESTIVATION.,photographed in a surface that a fly's foot would cover?  The forms or
7871,AESTIVATION.,"conditions of Time and Space, as Kant will tell you, are nothing in"
7872,AESTIVATION.,"themselves,--only our way of looking at things.  You are right, I think,"
7873,AESTIVATION.,"however, in recognizing the category of Space as being quite as"
7874,AESTIVATION.,applicable to minds as to the outer world.  Every man of reflection is
7875,AESTIVATION.,vaguely conscious of an imperfectly-defined circle which is drawn about
7876,AESTIVATION.,his intellect.  He has a perfectly clear sense that the fragments of his
7877,AESTIVATION.,intellectual circle include the curves of many other minds of which he is
7878,AESTIVATION.,cognizant.  He often recognizes these as manifestly concentric with his
7879,AESTIVATION.,"own, but of less radius.  On the other hand, when we find a portion of an"
7880,AESTIVATION.,"are on the outside of our own, we say it _intersects_ ours, but are very"
7881,AESTIVATION.,slow to confess or to see that it _circumscribes_ it.  Every now and then
7882,AESTIVATION.,"a man's mind is stretched by a new idea or sensation, and never shrinks"
7883,AESTIVATION.,"back to its former dimensions.  After looking at the Alps, I felt that my"
7884,AESTIVATION.,"mind had been stretched beyond the limits of its elasticity, and fitted"
7885,AESTIVATION.,so loosely on my old ideas of space that I had to spread these to fit it.
7886,AESTIVATION.,
7887,AESTIVATION.,--If I thought I should ever see the Alps!--said the schoolmistress.
7888,AESTIVATION.,
7889,AESTIVATION.,"Perhaps you will, some time or other,--I said."
7890,AESTIVATION.,
7891,AESTIVATION.,"It is not very likely,--she answered.--I have had one or two"
7892,AESTIVATION.,"opportunities, but I had rather be anything than governess in a rich"
7893,AESTIVATION.,family.
7894,AESTIVATION.,
7895,AESTIVATION.,"[Proud, too, you little soft-voiced woman!  Well, I can't say I like you"
7896,AESTIVATION.,any the worse for it.  How long will school-keeping take to kill you?  Is
7897,AESTIVATION.,"it possible the poor thing works with her needle, too?  I don't like"
7898,AESTIVATION.,those marks on the side of her forefinger.
7899,AESTIVATION.,
7900,AESTIVATION.,_Tableau_.  Chamouni.  Mont Blanc in full view.  Figures in the
7901,AESTIVATION.,foreground; two of them standing apart; one of them a gentleman
7902,AESTIVATION.,"of--oh,--ah,--yes! the other a lady in a white cashmere, leaning on his"
7903,AESTIVATION.,shoulder.--The ingenuous reader will understand that this was an
7904,AESTIVATION.,"internal, private, personal, subjective diorama, seen for one instant on"
7905,AESTIVATION.,"the background of my own consciousness, and abolished into black"
7906,AESTIVATION.,"nonentity by the first question which recalled me to actual life, as"
7907,AESTIVATION.,suddenly as if one of those iron shop-blinds (which I always pass at dusk
7908,AESTIVATION.,"with a shiver, expecting to stumble over some poor but honest shop-boy's"
7909,AESTIVATION.,"head, just taken off by its sudden and unexpected descent, and left"
7910,AESTIVATION.,"outside upon the sidewalk) had come down in front of it ""by the run.""]"
7911,AESTIVATION.,
7912,AESTIVATION.,--Should you like to hear what moderate wishes life brings one to at
7913,AESTIVATION.,"last?  I used to be very ambitious,--wasteful, extravagant, and luxurious"
7914,AESTIVATION.,"in all my fancies.  Read too much in the ""Arabian Nights.""  Must have the"
7915,AESTIVATION.,"lamp,--couldn't do without the ring.  Exercise every morning on the"
7916,AESTIVATION.,brazen horse.  Plump down into castles as full of little milk-white
7917,AESTIVATION.,princesses as a nest is of young sparrows.  All love me dearly at
7918,AESTIVATION.,"once.--Charming idea of life, but too high-colored for the reality.  I"
7919,AESTIVATION.,have outgrown all this; my tastes have become exceedingly
7920,AESTIVATION.,"primitive,--almost, perhaps, ascetic.  We carry happiness into our"
7921,AESTIVATION.,"condition, but must not hope to find it there.  I think you will be"
7922,AESTIVATION.,willing to hear some lines which embody the subdued and limited desires
7923,AESTIVATION.,of my maturity.

8019,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8020,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,I can't say just how many walks she and I had taken together before this
8021,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,one.  I found the effect of going out every morning was decidedly
8022,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"favorable on her health.  Two pleasing dimples, the places for which were"
8023,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"just marked when she came, played, shadowy, in her freshening cheeks when"
8024,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,she smiled and nodded good-morning to me from the school-house-steps.
8025,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8026,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"I am afraid I did the greater part of the talking.  At any rate, if I"
8027,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,should try to report all that I said during the first half-dozen walks we
8028,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"took together, I fear that I might receive a gentle hint from my friends"

8030,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,be the proper method of bringing them before the public.

8032,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,--I would have a woman as true as Death.  At the first real lie which
8033,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"works from the heart outward, she should be tenderly chloroformed into a"
8034,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"better world, where she can have an angel for a governess, and feed on"
8035,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"strange fruits which will make her all over again, even to her bones and"
8036,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"marrow.--Whether gifted with the accident of beauty or not, she should"
8037,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"have been moulded in the rose-red clay of Love, before the breath of life"

8039,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"and I think, after a while, one gets to know the warm-hued natures it"
8040,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,belongs to from the pretty pipe-clay counterfeits of them.--Proud she may
8041,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"be, in the sense of respecting herself; but pride in the sense of"
8042,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"contemning others less gifted than herself, deserves the two lowest"
8043,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"circles of a vulgar woman's Inferno, where the punishments are Smallpox"
8044,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"and Bankruptcy.--She who nips off the end of a brittle courtesy, as one"
8045,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"breaks the tip of an icicle, to bestow upon those whom she ought"
8046,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"cordially and kindly to recognize, proclaims the fact that she comes not"
8047,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"merely of low blood, but of bad blood.  Consciousness of unquestioned"
8048,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,position makes people gracious in proper measure to all; but if a woman
8049,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"puts on airs with her real equals, she has something about herself or her"
8050,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"family she is ashamed of, or ought to be.  Middle, and more than"

8052,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"An official of standing was rude to me once.  Oh, that is the maternal"

8055,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Nature is working for her; while she talks, she is working for"

8060,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"--Whether I said any or all of these things to the schoolmistress, or"

8076,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"--My idea was, in the first place, to search out the picturesque spots"
8077,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"which the city affords a sight of, to those who have eyes.  I know a good"
8078,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"many, and it was a pleasure to look at them in company with my young"
8079,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,friend.  There were the shrubs and flowers in the Franklin-Place
8080,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,front-yards or borders; Commerce is just putting his granite foot upon
8081,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"them.  Then there are certain small seraglio-gardens, into which one can"
8082,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"get a peep through the crevices of high fences,--one in Myrtle Street, or"
8083,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"backing on it,--here and there one at the North and South Ends.  Then the"
8084,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,great elms in Essex Street.  Then the stately horse-chestnuts in that
8085,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"vacant lot in Chambers Street, which hold their outspread hands over your"
8086,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"head, (as I said in my poem the other day,) and look as if they were"
8087,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"whispering, ""May grace, mercy, and peace be with you!""--and the rest of"
8088,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"that benediction.  Nay, there are certain patches of ground, which,"
8089,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"having lain neglected for a time, Nature, who always has her pockets full"
8090,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"of seeds, and holes in all her pockets, has covered with hungry plebeian"
8091,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"growths, which fight for life with each other, until some of them get"
8092,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"broad-leaved and succulent, and you have a coarse vegetable tapestry"
8093,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,which Raphael would not have disdained to spread over the foreground of
8094,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,his masterpiece.  The Professor pretends that he found such a one in
8095,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Charles Street, which, in its dare-devil impudence of rough-and-tumble"
8096,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"vegetation, beat the pretty-behaved flower-beds of the Public Garden as"
8097,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,ignominiously as a group of young tatterdemalions playing pitch-and-toss
8098,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,beats a row of Sunday-school-boys with their teacher at their head.
8099,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8100,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"But then the Professor has one of his burrows in that region, and puts"
8101,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,everything in high colors relating to it.  That is his way about
8102,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"everything.  I hold any man cheap,--he said,--of whom nothing stronger"
8103,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"can be uttered than that all his geese are swans.--How is that,"
8104,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,Professor?--said I;--I should have set you down for one of that
8105,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"sort.--Sir,--said he,--I am proud to say, that Nature has so far enriched"
8106,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"me, that I cannot own so much as a duck without seeing in it as pretty a"
8107,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,swan as ever swam the basin in the garden of the Luxembourg.  And the
8108,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Professor showed the whites of his eyes devoutly, like one returning"
8109,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,thanks after a dinner of many courses.
8110,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8111,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,I don't know anything sweeter than this leaking in of Nature through all
8112,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,the cracks in the walls and floors of cities.  You heap up a million tons
8113,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,of hewn rocks on a square mile or two of earth which was green once.  The
8114,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"trees look down from the hill-sides and ask each other, as they stand on"
8115,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"tiptoe,--""What are these people about?""  And the small herbs at their"
8116,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"feet look up and whisper back,--""We will go and see.""  So the small herbs"
8117,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"pack themselves up in the least possible bundles, and wait until the wind"
8118,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"steals to them at night and whispers, ""Come with me.""  Then they go"
8119,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"softly with it into the great city,--one to a cleft in the pavement, one"
8120,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"to a spout on the roof, one to a seam in the marbles over a rich"
8121,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"gentleman's bones, and one to the grave without a stone where nothing but"
8122,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"a man is buried,--and there they grow, looking down on the generations of"
8123,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"men from mouldy roofs, looking up from between the less-trodden"

8125,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"when there is only a light breath stirring, and you will hear them saying"

8127,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"those narrow green lines that border the roads leading from the city,"
8128,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"until they reach the slope of the hills, and the trees repeat in low"
8129,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"murmurs to each other,--""Wait awhile!""  By-and-by the flow of life in the"
8130,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"streets ebbs, and the old leafy inhabitants--the smaller tribes always in"
8131,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"front--saunter in, one by one, very careless seemingly, but very"
8132,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"tenacious, until they swarm so that the great stones gape from each other"
8133,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"with the crowding of their roots, and the feldspar begins to be picked"
8134,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,out of the granite to find them food.  At last the trees take up their
8135,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"solemn line of march, and never rest until they have encamped in the"
8136,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,market-place.  Wait long enough and you will find an old doting oak
8137,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,hugging a huge worn block in its yellow underground arms; that was the
8138,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"cornerstone of the State-House.  Oh, so patient she is, this"
8139,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,imperturbable Nature!
8140,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8141,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,--Let us cry!--
8142,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8143,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,But all this has nothing to do with my walks and talks with the
8144,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,schoolmistress.  I did not say that I would not tell you something about
8145,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"them.  Let me alone, and I shall talk to you more than I ought to,"
8146,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,probably.  We never tell our secrets to people that pump for them.
8147,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8148,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"Books we talked about, and education.  It was her duty to know something"
8149,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"of these, and of course she did.  Perhaps I was somewhat more learned"
8150,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"than she, but I found that the difference between her reading and mine"
8151,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,was like that of a man's and a woman's dusting a library.  The man flaps
8152,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,about with a bunch of feathers; the woman goes to work softly with a
8153,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"cloth.  She does not raise half the dust, nor fill her own eyes and mouth"
8154,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"with it,--but she goes into all the corners, and attends to the leaves as"
8155,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"much as the covers.--Books are the _negative_ pictures of thought, and"
8156,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the more sensitive the mind that receives their images, the more nicely"
8157,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the finest lines are reproduced.  A woman, (of the right kind,) reading"
8158,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"after a man, follows him as Ruth followed the reapers of Boaz, and her"
8159,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,gleanings are often the finest of the wheat.
8160,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8161,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,But it was in talking of Life that we came most clearly together.  I
8162,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"thought I knew something about that,--that I could speak or write about"
8163,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,it somewhat to the purpose.
8164,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8165,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,To take up this fluid earthly being of ours as a sponge sucks up
8166,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"water,--to be steeped and soaked in its realities as a hide fills its"
8167,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"pores lying seven years in a tan-pit,--to have winnowed every wave of it"
8168,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,as a mill-wheel works up the stream that runs through the flume upon its
8169,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"float-boards,--to have curled up in the keenest spasms and flattened out"
8170,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"in the laxest languors of this breathing-sickness, which keeps certain"
8171,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"parcels of matter uneasy for three or four score years,--to have fought"
8172,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"all the devils and clasped all the angels of its delirium,--and then,"
8173,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,just at the point when the white-hot passions have cooled down to
8174,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"cherry-red, plunge our experience into the ice-cold stream of some human"
8175,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"language or other, one might think would end in a rhapsody with something"
8176,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,of spring and temper in it.  All this I thought my power and province.
8177,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8178,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"The schoolmistress had tried life, too.  Once in a while one meets with a"
8179,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,single soul greater than all the living pageant which passes before it.
8180,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,As the pale astronomer sits in his study with sunken eyes and thin
8181,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"fingers, and weighs Uranus or Neptune as in a balance, so there are meek,"
8182,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"slight women who have weighed all which this planetary life can offer,"
8183,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,and hold it like a bauble in the palm of their slender hands.  This was
8184,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"one of them.  Fortune had left her, sorrow had baptized her; the routine"
8185,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,of labor and the loneliness of almost friendless city-life were before
8186,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"her.  Yet, as I looked upon her tranquil face, gradually regaining a"
8187,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"cheerfulness which was often sprightly, as she became interested in the"
8188,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"various matters we talked about and places we visited, I saw that eye and"
8189,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"lip and every shifting lineament were made for love,--unconscious of"
8190,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"their sweet office as yet, and meeting the cold aspect of Duty with the"
8191,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,natural graces which were meant for the reward of nothing less than the
8192,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,Great Passion.
8193,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8194,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,--I never addressed one word of love to the schoolmistress in the course
8195,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,of these pleasant walks.  It seemed to me that we talked of everything
8196,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"but love on that particular morning.  There was, perhaps, a little more"
8197,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,timidity and hesitancy on my part than I have commonly shown among our
8198,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"people at the boarding-house.  In fact, I considered myself the master at"
8199,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the breakfast-table; but, somehow, I could not command myself just then"
8200,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"so well as usual.  The truth is, I had secured a passage to Liverpool in"
8201,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the steamer which was to leave at noon,--with the condition, however, of"
8202,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,being released in case circumstances occurred to detain me.  The
8203,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"schoolmistress knew nothing about all this, of course, as yet."
8204,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8205,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"It was on the Common that we were walking.  The _mall_, or boulevard of"
8206,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"our Common, you know, has various branches leading from it in different"
8207,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,directions.  One of these runs down from opposite Joy Street southward
8208,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,across the whole length of the Common to Boylston Street.  We called it
8209,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"the long path, and were fond of it."
8210,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,
8211,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,I felt very weak indeed (though of a tolerably robust habit) as we came
8212,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,opposite the head of this path on that morning.  I think I tried to speak
8213,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,twice without making myself distinctly audible.  At last I got out the
8214,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"question,--Will you take the long path with me?--Certainly,--said the"
8215,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"schoolmistress,--with much pleasure.--Think,--I said,--before you answer;"
8216,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"if you take the long path with me now, I shall interpret it that we are"
8217,MY LAST WALK WITH THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.,"to part no more!--The schoolmistress stepped back with a sudden movement,"

8291,CHAPTER XII,Mistress in her stone girdle--_alta maenia Romae_--rose before me and
8292,CHAPTER XII,whitened my cheek with her pale shadow as never before or since.
8293,CHAPTER XII,
8294,CHAPTER XII,"I used very often, when coming home from my morning's work at one of the"
8295,CHAPTER XII,"public institutions of Paris, to stop in at the dear old church of St."
8296,CHAPTER XII,"Etienne du Mont.  The tomb of St. Genevieve, surrounded by burning"
8297,CHAPTER XII,"candles and votive tablets, was there; the mural tablet of Jacobus"
8298,CHAPTER XII,Benignus Winslow was there; there was a noble organ with carved figures;
8299,CHAPTER XII,the pulpit was borne on the oaken shoulders of a stooping Samson; and
8300,CHAPTER XII,there was a marvellous staircase like a coil of lace.  These things I
8301,CHAPTER XII,"mention from memory, but not all of them together impressed me so much as"
8302,CHAPTER XII,an inscription on a small slab of marble fixed in one of the walls.  It
8303,CHAPTER XII,told how this church of St. Stephen was repaired and beautified in the
8304,CHAPTER XII,"year 16**, and how, during the celebration of its reopening, two girls of"
8305,CHAPTER XII,"the parish (_filles de la paroisse_) fell from the gallery, carrying a"
8306,CHAPTER XII,"part of the balustrade with them, to the pavement, but by a miracle"
8307,CHAPTER XII,"escaped uninjured.  Two young girls, nameless, but real presences to my"
8308,CHAPTER XII,"imagination, as much as when they came fluttering down on the tiles with"
8309,CHAPTER XII,a cry that outscreamed the sharpest treble in the Te Deum.  (Look at
8310,CHAPTER XII,"Carlyle's article on Boswell, and see how he speaks of the poor young"

8316,CHAPTER XII,"Not the great historical events, but the personal incidents that call up"
8317,CHAPTER XII,"single sharp pictures of some human being in its pang or struggle, reach"

8319,CHAPTER XII,which Theobald Weinzapfli's restive horse sprung with him and landed him
8320,CHAPTER XII,"more than a hundred feet beneath in the lower town, not dead, but sorely"
8321,CHAPTER XII,"broken, and no longer a wild youth, but God's servant from that day"
8322,CHAPTER XII,"forward.  I have forgotten the famous bears, and all else.--I remember"
8323,CHAPTER XII,"the Percy lion on the bridge over the little river at Alnwick,--the"
8324,CHAPTER XII,"leaden lion with his tail stretched out straight like a pump-handle,--and"
8325,CHAPTER XII,why?  Because of the story of the village boy who must fain bestride the
8326,CHAPTER XII,"leaden tail, standing out over the water,--which breaking, he dropped"
8327,CHAPTER XII,"into the stream far below, and was taken out an idiot for the rest of his"
8328,CHAPTER XII,life.

8330,CHAPTER XII,"Arrow-heads must be brought to a sharp point, and the guillotine-axe must"

8332,CHAPTER XII,pierces to the seat of our sensibilities more readily than huge
8333,CHAPTER XII,occurrences and catastrophes.  A nail will pick a lock that defies
8334,CHAPTER XII,"hatchet and hammer.  ""The Royal George"" went down with all her crew, and"
8335,CHAPTER XII,Cowper wrote an exquisitely simple poem about it; but the leaf which
8336,CHAPTER XII,"holds it is smooth, while that which bears the lines on his mother's"
8337,CHAPTER XII,portrait is blistered with tears.
8338,CHAPTER XII,
8339,CHAPTER XII,My telling these recollections sets me thinking of others of the same
8340,CHAPTER XII,"kind which strike the imagination, especially when one is still young."
8341,CHAPTER XII,You remember the monument in Devizes market to the woman struck dead with
8342,CHAPTER XII,"a lie in her mouth.  I never saw that, but it is in the books.  Here is"
8343,CHAPTER XII,"one I never heard mentioned;--if any of the ""Note and Query"" tribe can"
8344,CHAPTER XII,"tell the story, I hope they will.  Where is this monument?  I was riding"
8345,CHAPTER XII,on an English stage-coach when we passed a handsome marble column (as I
8346,CHAPTER XII,remember it) of considerable size and pretensions.--What is that?--I
8347,CHAPTER XII,"said.--That,--answered the coachman,--is _the hangman's pillar_.  Then he"
8348,CHAPTER XII,"told me how a man went out one night, many years ago, to steal sheep.  He"
8349,CHAPTER XII,"caught one, tied its legs together, passed the rope over his head, and"
8350,CHAPTER XII,"started for home.  In climbing a fence, the rope slipped, caught him by"
8351,CHAPTER XII,"the neck, and strangled him.  Next morning he was found hanging dead on"
8352,CHAPTER XII,one side of the fence and the sheep on the other; in memory whereof the
8353,CHAPTER XII,lord of the manor caused this monument to be erected as a warning to all
8354,CHAPTER XII,who love mutton better than virtue.  I will send a copy of this record to
8355,CHAPTER XII,him or her who shall first set me right about this column and its
8356,CHAPTER XII,locality.
8357,CHAPTER XII,
8358,CHAPTER XII,And telling over these old stories reminds me that I have something which
8359,CHAPTER XII,may interest architects and perhaps some other persons.  I once ascended
8360,CHAPTER XII,"the spire of Strasburg Cathedral, which is the highest, I think, in"
8361,CHAPTER XII,"Europe.  It is a shaft of stone filigree-work, frightfully open, so that"
8362,CHAPTER XII,the guide puts his arms behind you to keep you from falling.  To climb it
8363,CHAPTER XII,"is a noonday nightmare, and to think of having climbed it crisps all the"
8364,CHAPTER XII,"fifty-six joints of one's twenty digits.  While I was on it, ""pinnacled"
8365,CHAPTER XII,"dim in the intense inane,"" a strong wind was blowing, and I felt sure"
8366,CHAPTER XII,that the spire was rocking.  It swayed back and forward like a stalk of
8367,CHAPTER XII,rye or a cat-o'nine-tails (bulrush) with a bobolink on it.  I mentioned
8368,CHAPTER XII,"it to the guide, and he said that the spire did really swing back and"
8369,CHAPTER XII,"forward,--I think he said some feet."
8370,CHAPTER XII,
8371,CHAPTER XII,Keep any line of knowledge ten years and some other line will intersect
8372,CHAPTER XII,it.  Long afterwards I was hunting out a paper of Dumeril's in an old
8373,CHAPTER XII,"journal,--the ""Magazin Encyclopedique"" for _l'an troisieme_, (1795,) when"
8374,CHAPTER XII,I stumbled upon a brief article on the vibrations of the spire of
8375,CHAPTER XII,Strasburg Cathedral.  A man can shake it so that the movement shall be
8376,CHAPTER XII,"shown in a vessel of water nearly seventy feet below the summit, and"
8377,CHAPTER XII,higher up the vibration is like that of an earthquake.  I have seen one
8378,CHAPTER XII,of those wretched wooden spires with which we very shabbily finish some
8379,CHAPTER XII,of our stone churches (thinking that the lidless blue eye of heaven
8380,CHAPTER XII,"cannot tell the counterfeit we try to pass on it,) swinging like a reed,"
8381,CHAPTER XII,"in a wind, but one would hardly think of such a thing's happening in a"
8382,CHAPTER XII,stone spire.  Does the Bunker-Hill Monument bend in the blast like a
8383,CHAPTER XII,blade of grass?  I suppose so.
8384,CHAPTER XII,
8385,CHAPTER XII,"You see, of course, that I am talking in a cheap way;--perhaps we will"
8386,CHAPTER XII,have some philosophy by and by;--let me work out this thin mechanical
8387,CHAPTER XII,vein.--I have something more to say about trees.  I have brought down
8388,CHAPTER XII,this slice of hemlock to show you.  Tree blew down in my woods (that
8389,CHAPTER XII,"were) in 1852.  Twelve feet and a half round, fair girth;--nine feet,"
8390,CHAPTER XII,"where I got my section, higher up.  This is a wedge, going to the centre,"
8391,CHAPTER XII,of the general shape of a slice of apple-pie in a large and not opulent
8392,CHAPTER XII,"family.  Length, about eighteen inches.  I have studied the growth of"
8393,CHAPTER XII,"this tree by its rings, and it is curious.  Three hundred and forty-two"
8394,CHAPTER XII,"rings.  Started, therefore, about 1510.  The thickness of the rings tells"
8395,CHAPTER XII,the rate at which it grew.  For five or six years the rate was
8396,CHAPTER XII,"slow,--then rapid for twenty years.  A little before the year 1550 it"
8397,CHAPTER XII,"began to grow very slowly, and so continued for about seventy years.  In"
8398,CHAPTER XII,1620 it took a new start and grew fast until 1714 then for the most part
8399,CHAPTER XII,"slowly until 1786, when it started again and grew pretty well and"
8400,CHAPTER XII,"uniformly until within the last dozen years, when it seems to have got on"
8401,CHAPTER XII,sluggishly.
8402,CHAPTER XII,
8403,CHAPTER XII,Look here.  Here are some human lives laid down against the periods of
8404,CHAPTER XII,"its growth, to which they corresponded.  This is Shakspeare's.  The tree"
8405,CHAPTER XII,was seven inches in diameter when he was born; ten inches when he died.
8406,CHAPTER XII,A little less than ten inches when Milton was born; seventeen when he
8407,CHAPTER XII,"died.  Then comes a long interval, and this thread marks out Johnson's"
8408,CHAPTER XII,"life, during which the tree increased from twenty-two to twenty-nine"
8409,CHAPTER XII,inches in diameter.  Here is the span of Napoleon's career;--the tree
8410,CHAPTER XII,doesn't seem to have minded it.
8411,CHAPTER XII,
8412,CHAPTER XII,I never saw the man yet who was not startled at looking on this section.
8413,CHAPTER XII,"I have seen many wooden preachers,--never one like this.  How much more"
8414,CHAPTER XII,striking would be the calendar counted on the rings of one of those awful
8415,CHAPTER XII,"trees which were standing when Christ was on earth, and where that brief"
8416,CHAPTER XII,"mortal life is chronicled with the stolid apathy of vegetable being,"
8417,CHAPTER XII,which remembers all human history as a thing of yesterday in its own
8418,CHAPTER XII,dateless existence!
8419,CHAPTER XII,
8420,CHAPTER XII,I have something more to say about elms.  A relative tells me there is
8421,CHAPTER XII,"one of great glory in Andover, near Bradford.  I have some recollections"
8422,CHAPTER XII,"of the former place, pleasant and other.  [I wonder if the old Seminary"
8423,CHAPTER XII,"clock strikes as slowly as it used to.  My room-mate thought, when he"
8424,CHAPTER XII,"first came, it was the bell tolling deaths, and people's ages, as they do"
8425,CHAPTER XII,in the country.  He swore--(ministers' sons get so familiar with good
8426,CHAPTER XII,words that they are apt to handle them carelessly)--that the children
8427,CHAPTER XII,"were dying by the dozen, of all ages, from one to twelve, and ran off"
8428,CHAPTER XII,"next day in recess, when it began to strike eleven, but was caught before"
8429,CHAPTER XII,"the clock got through striking.]  At the foot of ""the hill,"" down in"
8430,CHAPTER XII,"town, is, or was, a tidy old elm, which was said to have been hooped with"
8431,CHAPTER XII,"iron to protect it from Indian tomahawks, (_Credat Hahnemannus_,) and to"
8432,CHAPTER XII,"have grown round its hoops and buried them in its wood.  Of course, this"
8433,CHAPTER XII,is not the tree my relative means.
8434,CHAPTER XII,
8435,CHAPTER XII,"Also, I have a very pretty letter from Norwich, in Connecticut, telling"
8436,CHAPTER XII,me of two noble elms which are to be seen in that town.  One hundred and
8437,CHAPTER XII,twenty-seven feet from bough-end to bough-end!  What do you say to that?
8438,CHAPTER XII,"And gentle ladies beneath it, that love it and celebrate its praises!"
8439,CHAPTER XII,"And that in a town of such supreme, audacious, Alpine loveliness as"
8440,CHAPTER XII,"Norwich!--Only the dear people there must learn to call it Norridge, and"
8441,CHAPTER XII,not be misled by the mere accident of spelling.
8442,CHAPTER XII,
8443,CHAPTER XII,Nor_wich_.
8444,CHAPTER XII,
8445,CHAPTER XII,Por_ch_mouth.
8446,CHAPTER XII,
8447,CHAPTER XII,Cincinnat_ah_.
8448,CHAPTER XII,
8449,CHAPTER XII,What a sad picture of our civilization!
8450,CHAPTER XII,
8451,CHAPTER XII,I did not speak to you of the great tree on what used to be the Colman
8452,CHAPTER XII,"farm, in Deerfield, simply because I had not seen it for many years, and"
8453,CHAPTER XII,"did not like to trust my recollection.  But I had it in memory, and even"
8454,CHAPTER XII,"noted down, as one of the finest trees in symmetry and beauty I had ever"
8455,CHAPTER XII,"seen.  I have received a document, signed by two citizens of a"
8456,CHAPTER XII,"neighboring town, certified by the postmaster and a selectman, and these"
8457,CHAPTER XII,"again corroborated, reinforced, and sworn to by a member of that"
8458,CHAPTER XII,extraordinary college-class to which it is the good fortune of my friend
8459,CHAPTER XII,"the Professor to belong, who, though he has _formerly_ been a member of"
8460,CHAPTER XII,"Congress, is, I believe, fully worthy of confidence.  The tree ""girts"""
8461,CHAPTER XII,"eighteen and a half feet, and spreads over a hundred, and is a real"
8462,CHAPTER XII,beauty.  I hope to meet my friend under its branches yet; if we don't
8463,CHAPTER XII,"have ""youth at the prow,"" we will have ""pleasure at the 'elm."""
8464,CHAPTER XII,
8465,CHAPTER XII,"And just now, again, I have got a letter about some grand willows in"
8466,CHAPTER XII,"Maine, and another about an elm in Wayland, but too late for anything but"
8467,CHAPTER XII,thanks.
8468,CHAPTER XII,
8469,CHAPTER XII,"[And this leads me to say, that I have received a great many"
8470,CHAPTER XII,"communications, in prose and verse since I began printing these notes."
8471,CHAPTER XII,"The last came this very morning, in the shape of a neat and brief poem,"
8472,CHAPTER XII,"from New Orleans.  I could not make any of them public, though sometimes"
8473,CHAPTER XII,"requested to do so.  Some of them have given me great pleasure, and"
8474,CHAPTER XII,encouraged me to believe I had friends whose faces I had never seen.  If
8475,CHAPTER XII,"you are pleased with anything a writer says, and doubt whether to tell"
8476,CHAPTER XII,"him of it, do not hesitate; a pleasant word is a cordial to one, who"
8477,CHAPTER XII,"perhaps thinks he is tiring you, and so becomes tired himself.  I purr"
8478,CHAPTER XII,"very loud over a good, honest letter that says pretty things to me.]"
8479,CHAPTER XII,
8480,CHAPTER XII,--Sometimes very young persons send communications which they want
8481,CHAPTER XII,forwarded to editors; and these young persons do not always seem to have
8482,CHAPTER XII,"right conceptions of these same editors, and of the public, and of"
8483,CHAPTER XII,"themselves.  Here is a letter I wrote to one of these young folks, but,"
8484,CHAPTER XII,"on the whole, thought it best not to send.  It is not fair to single out"
8485,CHAPTER XII,"one for such sharp advice, where there are hundreds that are in need of"
8486,CHAPTER XII,it.
8487,CHAPTER XII,
8488,CHAPTER XII,"DEAR SIR,--You seem to be somewhat, but not a great deal, wiser than"
8489,CHAPTER XII,"I was at your age.  I don't wish to be understood as saying too much,"
8490,CHAPTER XII,"for I think, without committing myself to any opinion on my present"
8491,CHAPTER XII,"state, that I was not a Solomon at that stage of development."
8492,CHAPTER XII,
8493,CHAPTER XII,"You long to ""leap at a single bound into celebrity.""  Nothing is so"
8494,CHAPTER XII,common-place as to wish to be remarkable.  Fame usually comes to
8495,CHAPTER XII,"those who are thinking about something else,--very rarely to those"
8496,CHAPTER XII,"who say to themselves, ""Go to, now, let us be a celebrated"
8497,CHAPTER XII,"individual!""  The struggle for fame, as such, commonly ends in"
8498,CHAPTER XII,"notoriety;--that ladder is easy to climb, but it leads to the pillory"
8499,CHAPTER XII,which is crowded with fools who could not hold their tongues and
8500,CHAPTER XII,rogues who could not hide their tricks.
8501,CHAPTER XII,
8502,CHAPTER XII,"If you have the consciousness of genius, do something to show it."
8503,CHAPTER XII,"The world is pretty quick, nowadays, to catch the flavor of true"
8504,CHAPTER XII,"originality; if you write anything remarkable, the magazines and"
8505,CHAPTER XII,"newspapers will find you out, as the school-boys find out where the"
8506,CHAPTER XII,"ripe apples and pears are.  Produce anything really good, and an"
8507,CHAPTER XII,intelligent editor will jump at it.  Don't flatter yourself that any
8508,CHAPTER XII,article of yours is rejected because you are unknown to fame.
8509,CHAPTER XII,Nothing pleases an editor more than to get anything worth having from
8510,CHAPTER XII,a new hand.  There is always a dearth of really fine articles for a
8511,CHAPTER XII,"first-rate journal; for, of a hundred pieces received, ninety are at"
8512,CHAPTER XII,"or below the sea-level; some have water enough, but no head; some"
8513,CHAPTER XII,"head enough, but no water; only two or three are from full"
8514,CHAPTER XII,"reservoirs, high up that hill which is so hard to climb."
8515,CHAPTER XII,
8516,CHAPTER XII,"You may have genius.  The contrary is of course probable, but it is"
8517,CHAPTER XII,"not demonstrated.  If you have, the world wants you more than you"
8518,CHAPTER XII,"want it.  It has not only a desire, but a passion, for every spark of"
8519,CHAPTER XII,genius that shows itself among us; there is not a bull-calf in our
8520,CHAPTER XII,"national pasture that can bleat a rhyme but it is ten to one, among"
8521,CHAPTER XII,"his friends, and no takers, that he is the real, genuine, no-mistake"
8522,CHAPTER XII,Osiris.
8523,CHAPTER XII,
8524,CHAPTER XII,_Qu'est ce qu'il a fait_?  What has he done?  That was Napoleon's
8525,CHAPTER XII,"test.  What have you done?  Turn up the faces of your picture-cards,"
8526,CHAPTER XII,my boy!  You need not make mouths at the public because it has not
8527,CHAPTER XII,accepted you at your own fancy-valuation.  Do the prettiest thing you
8528,CHAPTER XII,can and wait your time.
8529,CHAPTER XII,
8530,CHAPTER XII,"For the verses you send me, I will not say they are hopeless, and I"
8531,CHAPTER XII,"dare not affirm that they show promise.  I am not an editor, but I"
8532,CHAPTER XII,"know the standard of some editors.  You must not expect to ""leap with"
8533,CHAPTER XII,"a single bound"" into the society of those whom it is not flattery to"
8534,CHAPTER XII,"call your betters.  When ""The Pactolian"" has paid you for a copy of"
8535,CHAPTER XII,"verses,--(I can furnish you a list of alliterative signatures,"
8536,CHAPTER XII,"beginning with Annie Aureole and ending with Zoe Zenith,)--when ""The"
8537,CHAPTER XII,"Rag-bag"" has stolen your piece, after carefully scratching your name"
8538,CHAPTER XII,"out,--when ""The Nut-cracker"" has thought you worth shelling, and"
8539,CHAPTER XII,"strung the kernel of your cleverest poem,--then, and not till then,"
8540,CHAPTER XII,"you may consider the presumption against you, from the fact of your"
8541,CHAPTER XII,"rhyming tendency, as called in question, and let our friends hear"
8542,CHAPTER XII,"from you, if you think it worth while.  You may possibly think me too"
8543,CHAPTER XII,"candid, and even accuse me of incivility; but let me assure you that"
8544,CHAPTER XII,"I am not half so plain-spoken as Nature, nor half so rude as Time."
8545,CHAPTER XII,If you prefer the long jolting of public opinion to the gentle touch
8546,CHAPTER XII,"of friendship, try it like a man.  Only remember this,--that, if a"
8547,CHAPTER XII,"bushel of potatoes is shaken in a market-cart without springs to it,"
8548,CHAPTER XII,the small potatoes always get to the bottom.
8549,CHAPTER XII,
8550,CHAPTER XII,"Believe me, etc., etc."
8551,CHAPTER XII,
8552,CHAPTER XII,"I always think of verse-writers, when I am in this vein; for these are by"
8553,CHAPTER XII,"far the most exacting, eager, self-weighing, restless, querulous,"
8554,CHAPTER XII,unreasonable literary persons one is like to meet with.  Is a young man
8555,CHAPTER XII,in the habit of writing verses?  Then the presumption is that he is an
8556,CHAPTER XII,"inferior person.  For, look you, there are at least nine chances in ten"
8557,CHAPTER XII,that he writes _poor_ verses.  Now the habit of chewing on rhymes without
8558,CHAPTER XII,"sense and soul to match them is, like that of using any other narcotic,"
8559,CHAPTER XII,at once a proof of feebleness and a debilitating agent.  A young man can
8560,CHAPTER XII,get rid of the presumption against him afforded by his writing verses
8561,CHAPTER XII,only by convincing us that they are verses worth writing.
8562,CHAPTER XII,
8563,CHAPTER XII,"All this sounds hard and rough, but, observe, it is not addressed to any"
8564,CHAPTER XII,"individual, and of course does not refer to any reader of these pages.  I"
8565,CHAPTER XII,would always treat any given young person passing through the meteoric
8566,CHAPTER XII,showers which rain down on the brief period of adolescence with great
8567,CHAPTER XII,tenderness.  God forgive us if we ever speak harshly to young creatures
8568,CHAPTER XII,"on the strength of these ugly truths, and so sooner or later, smite some"
8569,CHAPTER XII,tender-souled poet or poetess on the lips who might have sung the world
8570,CHAPTER XII,"into sweet trances, had we not silenced the matin-song in its first low"
8571,CHAPTER XII,"breathings!  Just as my heart yearns over the unloved, just so it sorrows"
8572,CHAPTER XII,for the ungifted who are doomed to the pangs of an undeceived
8573,CHAPTER XII,self-estimate.  I have always tried to be gentle with the most hopeless
8574,CHAPTER XII,"cases.  My experience, however, has not been encouraging."
8575,CHAPTER XII,
8576,CHAPTER XII,"--X. Y., aet. 18, a cheaply-got-up youth, with narrow jaws, and broad,"
8577,CHAPTER XII,"bony, cold, red hands, having been laughed at by the girls in his"
8578,CHAPTER XII,"village, and ""got the mitten"" (pronounced mitt_i_n) two or three times,"
8579,CHAPTER XII,"falls to souling and controlling, and youthing and truthing, in the"
8580,CHAPTER XII,"newspapers.  Sends me some strings of verses, candidates for the"
8581,CHAPTER XII,"Orthopedic Infirmary, all of them, in which I learn for the millionth"
8582,CHAPTER XII,time one of the following facts: either that something about a chime is
8583,CHAPTER XII,"sublime, or that something about time is sublime, or that something about"
8584,CHAPTER XII,"a chime is concerned with time, or that something about a rhyme is"
8585,CHAPTER XII,sublime or concerned with time or with a chime.  Wishes my opinion of the
8586,CHAPTER XII,"same, with advice as to his future course."
8587,CHAPTER XII,
8588,CHAPTER XII,"What shall I do about it?  Tell him the whole truth, and send him a"
8589,CHAPTER XII,ticket of admission to the Institution for Idiots and Feeble-minded
8590,CHAPTER XII,"Youth?  One doesn't like to be cruel,--and yet one hates to lie."
8591,CHAPTER XII,Therefore one softens down the ugly central fact of
8592,CHAPTER XII,"donkeyism,--recommends study of good models,--that writing verse should"
8593,CHAPTER XII,"be an incidental occupation only, not interfering with the hoe, the"
8594,CHAPTER XII,"needle, the lapstone, or the ledger,--and, above all that there should be"
8595,CHAPTER XII,no hurry in printing what is written.  Not the least use in all this.
8596,CHAPTER XII,The poetaster who has tasted type is done for.  He is like the man who
8597,CHAPTER XII,has once been a candidate for the Presidency.  He feeds on the madder of
8598,CHAPTER XII,"his delusion all his days, and his very bones grow red with the glow of"
8599,CHAPTER XII,his foolish fancy.  One of these young brains is like a bunch of India
8600,CHAPTER XII,crackers; once touch fire to it and it is best to keep hands off until it
8601,CHAPTER XII,"has done popping,--if it ever stops.  I have two letters on file; one is"
8602,CHAPTER XII,"a pattern of adulation, the other of impertinence.  My reply to the"
8603,CHAPTER XII,"first, containing the best advice I could give, conveyed in courteous"
8604,CHAPTER XII,"language, had brought out the second.  There was some sport in this, but"
8605,CHAPTER XII,"Dulness is not commonly a game fish, and only sulks after he is struck."
8606,CHAPTER XII,"You may set it down as a truth which admits of few exceptions, that those"
8607,CHAPTER XII,"who ask your _opinion_ really want your _praise_, and will be contented"
8608,CHAPTER XII,with nothing less.
8609,CHAPTER XII,
8610,CHAPTER XII,"There is another kind of application to which editors, or those supposed"
8611,CHAPTER XII,"to have access to them, are liable, and which often proves trying and"
8612,CHAPTER XII,painful.  One is appealed to in behalf of some person in needy
8613,CHAPTER XII,circumstances who wishes to make a living by the pen.  A manuscript
8614,CHAPTER XII,accompanying the letter is offered for publication.  It is not commonly
8615,CHAPTER XII,"brilliant, too often lamentably deficient.  If Rachel's saying is true,"
8616,CHAPTER XII,"that ""fortune is the measure of intelligence,"" then poverty is evidence"
8617,CHAPTER XII,"of limited capacity which it too frequently proves to be, notwithstanding"
8618,CHAPTER XII,a noble exception here and there.  Now an editor is a person under a
8619,CHAPTER XII,contract with the public to furnish them with the best things he can
8620,CHAPTER XII,afford for his money.  Charity shown by the publication of an inferior
8621,CHAPTER XII,article would be like the generosity of Claude Duval and the other
8622,CHAPTER XII,"gentlemen highwaymen, who pitied the poor so much they robbed the rich to"
8623,CHAPTER XII,have the means of relieving them.
8624,CHAPTER XII,
8625,CHAPTER XII,"Though I am not and never was an editor, I know something of the trials"
8626,CHAPTER XII,to which they are submitted.  They have nothing to do but to develope
8627,CHAPTER XII,enormous calluses at every point of contact with authorship.  Their
8628,CHAPTER XII,"business is not a matter of sympathy, but of intellect.  They must reject"
8629,CHAPTER XII,"the unfit productions of those whom they long to befriend, because it"
8630,CHAPTER XII,would be a profligate charity to accept them.  One cannot burn his house
8631,CHAPTER XII,down to warm the hands even of the fatherless and the widow.

8640,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8641,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,He was mightily pleased with the reception of that poem of his about the
8642,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,chaise.  He spoke to me once or twice about another poem of similar
8643,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"character he wanted to read me, which I told him I would listen to and"
8644,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,criticize.
8645,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8646,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"One day, after dinner, he came in with his face tied up, looking very red"
8647,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"in the cheeks and heavy about the eyes.--Hy'r'ye?--he said, and made for"
8648,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"an arm-chair, in which he placed first his hat and then his person, going"
8649,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,smack through the crown of the former as neatly as they do the trick at
8650,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,the circus.  The Professor jumped at the explosion as if he had sat down

8655,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8656,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,At the same time he let off one of those big words which lie at the

8661,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"After he had got calm, he pulled out a sheet or two of manuscript,"
8662,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"together with a smaller scrap, on which, as he said, he had just been"
8663,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,writing an introduction or prelude to the main performance.  A certain
8664,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"suspicion had come into my mind that the Professor was not quite right,"
8665,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,which was confirmed by the way he talked; but I let him begin.  This is
8666,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,the way he read it:--
8667,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8668,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,_Prelude_.

8684,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,Here sh' goes for hit 'm ag'in!
8685,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8686,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"Here I thought it necessary to interpose.--Professor,--I said,--you are"
8687,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"inebriated.  The style of what you call your ""Prelude"" shows that it was"
8688,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,written under cerebral excitement.  Your articulation is confused.  You
8689,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"have told me three times in succession, in exactly the same words, that I"
8690,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,was the only true friend you had in the world that you would unbutton
8691,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"your heart to.  You smell distinctly and decidedly of spirits.--I spoke,"
8692,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"and paused; tender, but firm."
8693,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8694,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"Two large tears orbed themselves beneath the Professor's lids,--in"
8695,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,obedience to the principle of gravitation celebrated in that delicious
8696,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"bit of bladdery bathos, ""The very law that moulds a tear,"" with which the"
8697,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"""Edinburgh Review"" attempted to put down Master George Gordon when that"
8698,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,young man was foolishly trying to make himself conspicuous.
8699,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8700,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,One of these tears peeped over the edge of the lid until it lost its
8701,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"balance,--slid an inch and waited for reinforcements,--swelled"
8702,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"again,--rolled down a little further,--stopped,--moved on,--and at last"
8703,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,fell on the back of the Professor's hand.  He held it up for me to look
8704,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"at, and lifted his eyes, brimful, till they met mine."
8705,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,
8706,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"I couldn't stand it,--I always break down when folks cry in my face,--so"
8707,THE PROFESSOR UNDER CHLOROFORM.,"I hugged him, and said he was a dear old boy, and asked him kindly what"

8745,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"You'll look at a horse's hinder leg,--"
8746,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"First great angle above the hoof,--"
8747,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,That's the gambrel; hence gambrel-roof.)
8748,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--Nicest place that ever was seen,--"
8749,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Colleges red and Common green,"
8750,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Sidewalks brownish with trees between.
8751,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Sweetest spot beneath the skies
8752,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"When the canker-worms don't rise,--"
8753,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"When the dust, that sometimes flies"
8754,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Into your mouth and ears and eyes.
8755,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"In a quiet slumber lies,"
8756,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,_Not_ in the shape of unbaked pies
8757,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Such as barefoot children prize.
8758,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8759,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"A kind of harber it seems to be,"
8760,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Facing the flow of a boundless sea.
8761,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Rows of gray old Tutors stand
8762,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Ranged like rocks above the sand;
8763,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Rolling beneath them, soft and green,"
8764,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Breaks the tide of bright sixteen,--"
8765,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"One wave, two waves, three waves, four,"
8766,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Sliding up the sparkling floor;
8767,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Then it ebbs to flow no more,"
8768,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Wandering off from shore to shore
8769,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,With its freight of golden ore!
8770,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,--Pleasant place for boys to play;--
8771,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Better keep your girls away;
8772,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Hearts get rolled as pebbles do
8773,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Which countless fingering waves pursue,"
8774,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And every classic beach is strown
8775,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,With heart-shaped pebbles of blood-red stone.
8776,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8777,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,But this is neither here nor there;--
8778,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,I'm talking about an old arm-chair.
8779,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"You've heard, no doubt, of PARSON TURELL?"
8780,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Over at Medford he used to dwell;
8781,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Married one of the Mathers' folk;
8782,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Got with his wife a chair of oak,--"
8783,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Funny old chair, with seat like wedge,"
8784,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Sharp behind and broad front edge,--"
8785,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"One of the oddest of human things,"
8786,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Turned all over with knobs and rings,--"
8787,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"But heavy, and wide, and deep, and grand,--"
8788,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Fit for the worthies of the land,--"
8789,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Chief-Justice Sewall a cause to try in,"
8790,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Or Cotton Mather to sit--and lie--in.
8791,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,--Parson Turell bequeathed the same
8792,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"To a certain student,--SMITH by name;"
8793,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"These were the terms, as we are told:"
8794,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"""Saide Smith saide Chaire to have and holde;"
8795,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"When he doth graduate, then to passe"
8796,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,To ye oldest Youth in ye Senior Classe.
8797,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"On Payment of""--(naming a certain sum)--"
8798,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"""By him to whom ye Chaire shall come;"
8799,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"He to ye oldest Senior next,"
8800,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And soe forever,""--(thus runs the text,)--"
8801,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"""But one Crown lesse then he gave to claime,"
8802,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"That being his Debte for use of same."""
8803,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8804,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Smith_ transferred it to one of the BROWNS,"
8805,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And took his money,--five silver crowns."
8806,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Brown_ delivered it up to MOORE,"
8807,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Who paid, it is plain, not five, but four."
8808,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Moore_ made over the chair to LEE,"
8809,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Who gave him crowns of silver three.
8810,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Lee_ conveyed it unto DREW,"
8811,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And now the payment, of course, was two."
8812,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Drew_ gave up the chair to DUNN,--"
8813,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"All he got, as you see, was one."
8814,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"_Dunn_ released the chair to HALL,"
8815,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And got by the bargain no crown at all.
8816,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--And now it passed to a second BROWN,"
8817,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Who took it, and likewise _claimed a crown_."
8818,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"When _Brown_ conveyed it unto WARE,"
8819,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Having had one crown, to make it fair,"
8820,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,He paid him two crowns to take the chair;
8821,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And _Ware_, being honest, (as all Wares be,)"
8822,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"He paid one POTTER, who took it, three."
8823,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Four got ROBINSON; five got DIX;
8824,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,JOHNSON _primus_ demanded six;
8825,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And so the sum kept gathering still
8826,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Till after the battle of Bunker's Hill
8827,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--When paper money became so cheap,"
8828,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Folks wouldn't count it, but said ""a heap,"""
8829,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"A certain RICHARDS, the books declare,"
8830,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,(A. M. in '90?  I've looked with care
8831,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Through the Triennial,--_name not there_.)"
8832,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"This person, Richards, was offered then"
8833,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Eight score pounds, but would have ten;"
8834,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Nine, I think, was the sum he took,--"
8835,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Not quite certain,--but see the book."
8836,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--By and by the wars were still,"
8837,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,But nothing had altered the Parson's will.
8838,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"The old arm-chair was solid yet,"
8839,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,But saddled with such a monstrous debt!
8840,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Things grew quite too bad to bear,"
8841,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Paying such sums to get rid of the chair!
8842,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"But dead men's fingers hold awful tight,"
8843,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And there was the will in black and white,"
8844,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Plain enough for a child to spell.
8845,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"What should be done no man could tell,"
8846,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"For the chair was a kind of nightmare curse,"
8847,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And every season but made it worse.
8848,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8849,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"As a last resort, to clear the doubt,"
8850,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,They got old GOVERNOR HANCOCK out.
8851,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"The Governor came, with his Light-horse Troop"
8852,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And his mounted truckmen, all cock-a-hoop;"
8853,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Halberds glittered and colors flew,"
8854,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"French horns whinnied and trumpets blew,"
8855,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,The yellow fifes whistled between their teeth
8856,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And the bumble-bee bass-drums boomed beneath;
8857,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"So he rode with all his band,"
8858,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Till the President met him, cap in hand."
8859,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--The Governor ""hefted"" the crowns, and said,--"
8860,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"""A will is a will, and the Parson's dead."""
8861,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"The Governor hefted the crowns.  Said he,--"
8862,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"""There is your p'int.  And here's my fee."
8863,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"These are the terms you must fulfil,--"
8864,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"On such conditions I BREAK THE WILL!"""
8865,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,The Governor mentioned what these should be.
8866,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,(Just wait a minute and then you'll see.)
8867,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"The President prayed.  Then all was still,"
8868,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And the Governor rose and BROKE THE WILL!
8869,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--""About those conditions?""  Well, now you go"
8870,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And do as I tell you, and then you'll know."
8871,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Once a year, on Commencement-day,"
8872,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"If you'll only take the pains to stay,"
8873,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"You'll see the President in the CHAIR,"
8874,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Likewise the Governor sitting there.
8875,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,The President rises; both old and young
8876,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"May hear his speech in a foreign tongue,"
8877,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"The meaning whereof, as lawyers swear,"
8878,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Is this: Can I keep this old arm-chair?
8879,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And then his Excellency bows,"
8880,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,As much as to say that he allows.
8881,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,The Vice-Gub. next is called by name;
8882,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"He bows like t'other, which means the same."
8883,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"And all the officers round 'em bow,"
8884,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,As much as to say that _they_ allow.
8885,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And a lot of parchments about the chair
8886,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Are handed to witnesses then and there,"
8887,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And then the lawyers hold it clear
8888,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,That the chair is safe for another year.
8889,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8890,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"God bless you, Gentlemen!  Learn to give"
8891,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Money to colleges while you live.
8892,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,Don't be silly and think you'll try
8893,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"To bother the colleges, when you die,"
8894,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"With codicil this, and codicil that,"
8895,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,That Knowledge may starve while Law grows fat;
8896,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"For there never was pitcher that wouldn't spill,"
8897,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,And there's always a flaw in a donkey's will!
8898,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8899,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"--Hospitality is a good deal a matter of latitude, I suspect.  The shade"
8900,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,of a palm-tree serves an African for a hut; his dwelling is all door and
8901,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,no walls; everybody can come in.  To make a morning call on an Esquimaux
8902,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"acquaintance, one must creep through a long tunnel; his house is all"
8903,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"walls and no door, except such a one as an apple with a worm-hole has."
8904,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"One might, very probably, trace a regular gradation between these two"
8905,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"extremes.  In cities where the evenings are generally hot, the people"
8906,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"have porches at their doors, where they sit, and this is, of course, a"
8907,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"provocative to the interchange of civilities.  A good deal, which in"
8908,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"colder regions is ascribed to mean dispositions, belongs really to mean"
8909,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,temperature.
8910,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8911,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Once in a while, even in our Northern cities, at noon, in a very hot"
8912,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"summer's day, one may realize, by a sudden extension in his sphere of"
8913,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"consciousness, how closely he is shut up for the most part.--Do you not"
8914,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"remember something like this?  July, between 1 and 2, P. M., Fahrenheit"
8915,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"96, or thereabout.  Windows all gaping, like the mouths of panting dogs."
8916,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"Long, stinging cry of a locust comes in from a tree, half a mile off; had"
8917,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,forgotten there was such a tree.  Baby's screams from a house several
8918,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,blocks distant;--never knew there were any babies in the neighborhood
8919,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"before.  Tinman pounding something that clatters dreadfully,--very"
8920,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"distinct, but don't remember any tinman's shop near by.  Horses stamping"
8921,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"on pavement to get off flies.  When you hear these four sounds, you may"
8922,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,set it down as a warm day.  Then it is that one would like to imitate the
8923,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"mode of life of the native at Sierra Leone, as somebody has described it:"
8924,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"stroll into the market in natural costume,--buy a water-melon for a"
8925,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"halfpenny,--split it, and scoop out the middle,--sit down in one half of"
8926,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"the empty rind, clap the other on one's head, and feast upon the pulp."
8927,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8928,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,--I see some of the London journals have been attacking some of their
8929,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"literary people for lecturing, on the ground of its being a public"
8930,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,exhibition of themselves for money.  A popular author can print his
8931,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"lecture; if he deliver it, it is a case of _quaestum corpore_, or making"
8932,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"profit of his person.  None but ""snobs"" do that.  _Ergo_, etc.  To this I"
8933,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"reply,--_Negatur minor_.  Her Most Gracious Majesty, the Queen, exhibits"
8934,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,herself to the public as a part of the service for which she is paid.  We
8935,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"do not consider it low-bred in her to pronounce her own speech, and"
8936,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"should prefer it so to hearing it from any other person, or reading it."
8937,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"His Grace and his Lordship exhibit themselves very often for popularity,"
8938,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"and their houses every day for money.--No, if a man shows himself other"
8939,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"than he is, if he belittles himself before an audience for hire, then he"
8940,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"acts unworthily.  But a true word, fresh from the lips of a true man, is"
8941,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"worth paying for, at the rate of eight dollars a day, or even of fifty"
8942,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,dollars a lecture.  The taunt must be an outbreak of jealousy against the
8943,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,renowned authors who have the audacity to be also orators.  The
8944,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,sub-lieutenants (of the press) stick a too popular writer and speaker
8945,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"with an epithet in England, instead of with a rapier, as in France.--Poh!"
8946,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"All England is one great menagerie, and, all at once, the jackal, who"
8947,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,"admires the gilded cage of the royal beast, must protest against the"
8948,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,vulgarity of the talking-bird's and the nightingale's being willing to
8949,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,become a part of the exhibition!
8950,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8951,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8952,A MATHEMATICAL STORY.,
8953,THE LONG PATH.,THE LONG PATH.
8954,THE LONG PATH.,
8955,THE LONG PATH.,
8956,THE LONG PATH.,(_Last of the Parentheses_.)
8957,THE LONG PATH.,
8958,THE LONG PATH.,"Yes, that was my last walk with the _schoolmistress_.  It happened to be"
8959,THE LONG PATH.,"the end of a term; and before the next began, a very nice young woman,"
8960,THE LONG PATH.,"who had been her assistant, was announced as her successor, and she was"
8961,THE LONG PATH.,provided for elsewhere.  So it was no longer the schoolmistress that I
8962,THE LONG PATH.,"walked with, but--Let us not be in unseemly haste.  I shall call her the"
8963,THE LONG PATH.,schoolmistress still; some of you love her under that name.
8964,THE LONG PATH.,
8965,THE LONG PATH.,When it became known among the boarders that two of their number had
8966,THE LONG PATH.,"joined hands to walk down the long path of life side by side, there was,"
8967,THE LONG PATH.,"as you may suppose, no small sensation.  I confess I pitied our landlady."
8968,THE LONG PATH.,"It took her all of a suddin,--she said.  Had not known that we was keepin"
8969,THE LONG PATH.,"company, and never mistrusted anything particular.  Ma'am was right to"
8970,THE LONG PATH.,"better herself.  Didn't look very rugged to take care of a femily, but"
8971,THE LONG PATH.,"could get hired haalp, she calc'lated.--The great maternal instinct came"
8972,THE LONG PATH.,"crowding up in her soul just then, and her eyes wandered until they"
8973,THE LONG PATH.,settled on her daughter.
8974,THE LONG PATH.,
8975,THE LONG PATH.,"--No, poor, dear woman,--that could not have been.  But I am dropping one"
8976,THE LONG PATH.,"of my internal tears for you, with this pleasant smile on my face all the"
8977,THE LONG PATH.,time.
8978,THE LONG PATH.,
8979,THE LONG PATH.,The great mystery of God's providence is the permitted crushing out of
8980,THE LONG PATH.,flowering instincts.  Life is maintained by the respiration of oxygen and
8981,THE LONG PATH.,of sentiments.  In the long catalogue of scientific cruelties there is
8982,THE LONG PATH.,hardly anything quite so painful to think of as that experiment of
8983,THE LONG PATH.,putting an animal under the bell of an air-pump and exhausting the air
8984,THE LONG PATH.,from it.  [I never saw the accursed trick performed.  _Laus Deo_!]  There
8985,THE LONG PATH.,"comes a time when the souls of human beings, women, perhaps, more even"
8986,THE LONG PATH.,"than men, begin to faint for the atmosphere of the affections they were"
8987,THE LONG PATH.,made to breathe.  Then it is that Society places its transparent
8988,THE LONG PATH.,bell-glass over the young woman who is to be the subject of one of its
8989,THE LONG PATH.,fatal experiments.  The element by which only the heart lives is sucked
8990,THE LONG PATH.,out of her crystalline prison.  Watch her through its transparent
8991,THE LONG PATH.,"walls;--her bosom is heaving; but it is in a vacuum.  Death is no riddle,"
8992,THE LONG PATH.,"compared to this.  I remember a poor girl's story in the ""Book of"
8993,THE LONG PATH.,"Martyrs.""  The ""dry-pan and the gradual fire"" were the images that"
8994,THE LONG PATH.,frightened her most.  How many have withered and wasted under as slow a
8995,THE LONG PATH.,torment in the walls of that larger Inquisition which we call
8996,THE LONG PATH.,Civilization!
8997,THE LONG PATH.,
8998,THE LONG PATH.,"Yes, my surface-thought laughs at you, you foolish, plain, overdressed,"
8999,THE LONG PATH.,"mincing, cheaply-organized, self-saturated young person, whoever you may"
9000,THE LONG PATH.,"be, now reading this,--little thinking you are what I describe, and in"
9001,THE LONG PATH.,blissful unconsciousness that you are destined to the lingering asphyxia
9002,THE LONG PATH.,of soul which is the lot of such multitudes worthier than yourself.  But
9003,THE LONG PATH.,it is only my surface-thought which laughs.  For that great procession of
9004,THE LONG PATH.,"the UNLOVED, who not only wear the crown of thorns, but must hide it"
9005,THE LONG PATH.,"under the locks of brown or gray,--under the snowy cap, under the"
9006,THE LONG PATH.,"chilling turban,--hide it even from themselves,--perhaps never know they"
9007,THE LONG PATH.,"wear it, though it kills them,--there is no depth of tenderness in my"
9008,THE LONG PATH.,"nature that Pity has not sounded.  Somewhere,--somewhere,--love is in"
9009,THE LONG PATH.,"store for them,--the universe must not be allowed to fool them so"
9010,THE LONG PATH.,"cruelly.  What infinite pathos in the small, half-unconscious artifices"
9011,THE LONG PATH.,by which unattractive young persons seek to recommend themselves to the
9012,THE LONG PATH.,"favor of those towards whom our dear sisters, the unloved, like the rest,"
9013,THE LONG PATH.,are impelled by their God-given instincts!
9014,THE LONG PATH.,
9015,THE LONG PATH.,Read what the singing-women--one to ten thousand of the suffering
9016,THE LONG PATH.,"women--tell us, and think of the griefs that die unspoken!  Nature is in"
9017,THE LONG PATH.,earnest when she makes a woman; and there are women enough lying in the
9018,THE LONG PATH.,next churchyard with very commonplace blue slate-stones at their head and
9019,THE LONG PATH.,"feet, for whom it was just as true that ""all sounds of life assumed one"
9020,THE LONG PATH.,"tone of love,"" as for Letitia Landon, of whom Elizabeth Browning said it;"
9021,THE LONG PATH.,"but she could give words to her grief, and they could not.--Will you hear"
9022,THE LONG PATH.,a few stanzas of mine?
9023,THE LONG PATH.,
9024,THE VOICELESS.,THE VOICELESS.
9025,THE VOICELESS.,
9026,THE VOICELESS.,We count the broken lyres that rest
9027,THE VOICELESS.,"Where the sweet wailing singers slumber,--"
9028,THE VOICELESS.,But o'er their silent sister's breast
9029,THE VOICELESS.,The wild flowers who will stoop to number?
9030,THE VOICELESS.,"A few can touch the magic string,"
9031,THE VOICELESS.,And noisy Fame is proud to win them;--
9032,THE VOICELESS.,"Alas for those that never sing,"
9033,THE VOICELESS.,But die with all their music in them!
9034,THE VOICELESS.,
9035,THE VOICELESS.,"Nay, grieve not for the dead alone"
9036,THE VOICELESS.,"Whose song has told their hearts' sad story,--"
9037,THE VOICELESS.,"Weep for the voiceless, who have known"
9038,THE VOICELESS.,The cross without the crown of glory!
9039,THE VOICELESS.,Not where Leucadian breezes sweep
9040,THE VOICELESS.,"O'er Sappho's memory-haunted billow,"
9041,THE VOICELESS.,But where the glistening night-dews weep
9042,THE VOICELESS.,On nameless sorrow's churchyard pillow.
9043,THE VOICELESS.,
9044,THE VOICELESS.,O hearts that break and give no sign
9045,THE VOICELESS.,"Save whitening lip and fading tresses,"
9046,THE VOICELESS.,Till Death pours out his cordial wine
9047,THE VOICELESS.,"Slow-dropped from Misery's crushing presses,--"
9048,THE VOICELESS.,If singing breath or echoing chord
9049,THE VOICELESS.,"To every hidden pang were given,"
9050,THE VOICELESS.,"What endless melodies were poured,"
9051,THE VOICELESS.,"As sad as earth, as sweet as heaven!"
9052,THE VOICELESS.,
9053,THE VOICELESS.,"I hope that our landlady's daughter is not so badly off, after all.  That"
9054,THE VOICELESS.,young man from another city who made the remark which you remember about
9055,THE VOICELESS.,"Boston State-house and Boston folks, has appeared at our table repeatedly"
9056,THE VOICELESS.,"of late, and has seemed to me rather attentive to this young lady.  Only"
9057,THE VOICELESS.,last evening I saw him leaning over her while she was playing the
9058,THE VOICELESS.,"accordion,--indeed, I undertook to join them in a song, and got as far as"
9059,THE VOICELESS.,"""Come rest in this boo-oo,"" when, my voice getting tremulous, I turned"
9060,THE VOICELESS.,"off, as one steps out of a procession, and left the basso and soprano to"
9061,THE VOICELESS.,finish it.  I see no reason why this young woman should not be a very
9062,THE VOICELESS.,proper match for a man that laughs about Boston State-house.  He can't be
9063,THE VOICELESS.,very particular.
9064,THE VOICELESS.,
9065,THE VOICELESS.,The young fellow whom I have so often mentioned was a little free in his
9066,THE VOICELESS.,"remarks, but very good-natured.--Sorry to have you go,--he"
9067,THE VOICELESS.,said.--School-ma'am made a mistake not to wait for me.  Haven't taken
9068,THE VOICELESS.,anything but mournin' fruit at breakfast since I heard of it.--_Mourning_
9069,THE VOICELESS.,"fruit,--said I,--what's that?--Huckleberries and blackberries,--said"
9070,THE VOICELESS.,"he;--couldn't eat in colors, raspberries, currants, and such, after a"
9071,THE VOICELESS.,solemn thing like this happening.--The conceit seemed to please the young
9072,THE VOICELESS.,"fellow.  If you will believe it, when we came down to breakfast the next"
9073,THE VOICELESS.,"morning, he had carried it out as follows.  You know those odious little"
9074,THE VOICELESS.,"""saas-plates"" that figure so largely at boarding-houses, and especially"
9075,THE VOICELESS.,"at taverns, into which a strenuous attendant female trowels little dabs,"
9076,THE VOICELESS.,"sombre of tint and heterogeneous of composition, which it makes you feel"
9077,THE VOICELESS.,"homesick to look at, and into which you poke the elastic coppery"
9078,THE VOICELESS.,"tea-spoon with the air of a cat dipping her foot into a wash-tub,--(not"
9079,THE VOICELESS.,"that I mean to say anything against them, for, when they are of tinted"
9080,THE VOICELESS.,"porcelain or starry many-faceted crystal, and hold clean bright berries,"
9081,THE VOICELESS.,"or pale virgin honey, or ""lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon,"" and the"
9082,THE VOICELESS.,"teaspoon is of white silver, with the Tower-stamp, solid, but not"
9083,THE VOICELESS.,"brutally heavy,--as people in the green stage of millionism will have"
9084,THE VOICELESS.,"them,--I can dally with their amber semi-fluids or glossy spherules"
9085,THE VOICELESS.,"without a shiver,)--you know these small, deep dishes, I say.  When we"
9086,THE VOICELESS.,"came down the next morning, each of these (two only excepted) was covered"
9087,THE VOICELESS.,"with a broad leaf.  On lifting this, each boarder found a small heap of"
9088,THE VOICELESS.,"solemn black huckleberries.  But one of those plates held red currants,"
9089,THE VOICELESS.,"and was covered with a red rose; the other held white currants, and was"
9090,THE VOICELESS.,"covered with a white rose.  There was a laugh at this at first, and then"
9091,THE VOICELESS.,"a short silence, and I noticed that her lip trembled, and the old"
9092,THE VOICELESS.,gentleman opposite was in trouble to get at his bandanna handkerchief
9093,THE VOICELESS.,
9094,THE VOICELESS.,"--""What was the use in waiting?  We should be too late for Switzerland,"
9095,THE VOICELESS.,"that season, if we waited much longer.""--The hand I held trembled in"
9096,THE VOICELESS.,"mine, and the eyes fell meekly, as Esther bowed herself before the feet"
9097,THE VOICELESS.,"of Ahasuerus.--She had been reading that chapter, for she looked up,--if"
9098,THE VOICELESS.,there was a film of moisture over her eyes there was also the faintest
9099,THE VOICELESS.,"shadow of a distant smile skirting her lips, but not enough to accent the"
9100,THE VOICELESS.,"dimples,--and said, in her pretty, still way,--""If it please the king,"
9101,THE VOICELESS.,"and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before"
9102,THE VOICELESS.,"the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes""--"
9103,THE VOICELESS.,
9104,THE VOICELESS.,I don't remember what King Ahasuerus did or said when Esther got just to
9105,THE VOICELESS.,"that point of her soft, humble words,--but I know what I did.  That"
9106,THE VOICELESS.,"quotation from Scripture was cut short, anyhow.  We came to a compromise"
9107,THE VOICELESS.,"on the great question, and the time was settled for the last day of"
9108,THE VOICELESS.,summer.
9109,THE VOICELESS.,
9110,THE VOICELESS.,"In the mean time, I talked on with our boarders, much as usual, as you"
9111,THE VOICELESS.,"may see by what I have reported.  I must say, I was pleased with a"
9112,THE VOICELESS.,"certain tenderness they all showed toward us, after the first excitement"
9113,THE VOICELESS.,"of the news was over.  It came out in trivial matters,--but each one, in"
9114,THE VOICELESS.,"his or her way, manifested kindness.  Our landlady, for instance, when we"
9115,THE VOICELESS.,"had chickens, sent the _liver_ instead of the _gizzard_, with the wing,"
9116,THE VOICELESS.,for the schoolmistress.  This was not an accident; the two are never
9117,THE VOICELESS.,"mistaken, though some landladies _appear_ as if they did not know the"
9118,THE VOICELESS.,difference.  The whole of the company were even more respectfully
9119,THE VOICELESS.,"attentive to my remarks than usual.  There was no idle punning, and very"
9120,THE VOICELESS.,"little winking on the part of that lively young gentleman who, as the"
9121,THE VOICELESS.,"reader may remember, occasionally interposed some playful question or"
9122,THE VOICELESS.,"remark, which could hardly be considered relevant,--except when the least"
9123,THE VOICELESS.,"allusion was made to matrimony, when he would look at the landlady's"
9124,THE VOICELESS.,"daughter, and wink with both sides of his face, until she would ask what"
9125,THE VOICELESS.,"he was pokin' his fun at her for, and if he wasn't ashamed of himself."
9126,THE VOICELESS.,"In fact, they all behaved very handsomely, so that I really felt sorry at"
9127,THE VOICELESS.,the thought of leaving my boarding-house.
9128,THE VOICELESS.,
9129,THE VOICELESS.,"I suppose you think, that, because I lived at a plain widow-woman's plain"
9130,THE VOICELESS.,"table, I was of course more or less infirm in point of worldly fortune."
9131,THE VOICELESS.,"You may not be sorry to learn, that, though not what _great merchants_"
9132,THE VOICELESS.,"call very rich, I was comfortable,--comfortable,--so that most of those"
9133,THE VOICELESS.,moderate luxuries I described in my verses on _Contentment_--_most_ of
9134,THE VOICELESS.,"them, I say--were within our reach, if we chose to have them.  But I"
9135,THE VOICELESS.,"found out that the schoolmistress had a vein of charity about her, which"
9136,THE VOICELESS.,"had hitherto been worked on a small silver and copper basis, which made"
9137,THE VOICELESS.,"her think less, perhaps, of luxuries than even I did,--modestly as I have"
9138,THE VOICELESS.,expressed my wishes.
9139,THE VOICELESS.,
9140,THE VOICELESS.,"It is a rather pleasant thing to tell a poor young woman, whom one has"
9141,THE VOICELESS.,"contrived to win without showing his rent-roll, that she has found what"
9142,THE VOICELESS.,"the world values so highly, in following the lead of her affections."
9143,THE VOICELESS.,That was an enjoyment I was now ready for.
9144,THE VOICELESS.,
9145,THE VOICELESS.,I began abruptly:--Do you know that you are a rich young person?
9146,THE VOICELESS.,
9147,THE VOICELESS.,"I know that I am very rich,--she said.--Heaven has given me more than I"
9148,THE VOICELESS.,ever asked; for I had not thought love was ever meant for me.
9149,THE VOICELESS.,
9150,THE VOICELESS.,"It was a woman's confession, and her voice fell to a whisper as it"
9151,THE VOICELESS.,threaded the last words.
9152,THE VOICELESS.,
9153,THE VOICELESS.,"I don't mean that,--I said,--you blessed little saint and seraph!--if"
9154,THE VOICELESS.,"there's an angel missing in the New Jerusalem, inquire for her at this"
9155,THE VOICELESS.,"boarding house!--I don't mean that!  I mean that I--that is,"
9156,THE VOICELESS.,you--am--are--confound it!--I mean that you'll be what most people call a
9157,THE VOICELESS.,lady of fortune.  And I looked full in her eyes for the effect of the
9158,THE VOICELESS.,announcement.
9159,THE VOICELESS.,
9160,THE VOICELESS.,There wasn't any.  She said she was thankful that I had what would save
9161,THE VOICELESS.,"me from drudgery, and that some other time I should tell her about it.--I"
9162,THE VOICELESS.,never made a greater failure in an attempt to produce a sensation.
9163,THE VOICELESS.,
9164,THE VOICELESS.,"So the last day of summer came.  It was our choice to go to the church,"
9165,THE VOICELESS.,but we had a kind of reception at the boarding-house.  The presents were
9166,THE VOICELESS.,"all arranged, and among them none gave more pleasure than the modest"
9167,THE VOICELESS.,"tributes of our fellow-boarders,--for there was not one, I believe, who"
9168,THE VOICELESS.,did not send something.  The landlady would insist on making an elegant
9169,THE VOICELESS.,"bride-cake, with her own hands; to which Master Benjamin Franklin wished"
9170,THE VOICELESS.,"to add certain embellishments out of his private funds,--namely, a Cupid"
9171,THE VOICELESS.,"in a mouse-trap, done in white sugar, and two miniature flags with the"
9172,THE VOICELESS.,"stars and stripes, which had a very pleasing effect, I assure you.  The"
9173,THE VOICELESS.,landlady's daughter sent a richly bound copy of Tupper's Poems.  On a
9174,THE VOICELESS.,"blank leaf was the following, written in a very delicate and careful"
9175,THE VOICELESS.,hand:--
9176,THE VOICELESS.,
9177,THE VOICELESS.,Presented to . . . by . . .
9178,THE VOICELESS.,
9179,THE VOICELESS.,On the eve ere her union in holy matrimony.
9180,THE VOICELESS.,
9181,THE VOICELESS.,May sunshine ever beam o'er her!
9182,THE VOICELESS.,
9183,THE VOICELESS.,"Even the poor relative thought she must do something, and sent a copy of"
9184,THE VOICELESS.,"""The Whole Duty of Man,"" bound in very attractive variegated sheepskin,"
9185,THE VOICELESS.,the edges nicely marbled.  From the divinity-student came the loveliest
9186,THE VOICELESS.,"English edition of ""Keble's Christian Year.""  I opened it, when it came,"
9187,THE VOICELESS.,"to the _Fourth Sunday in Lent_, and read that angelic poem, sweeter than"
9188,THE VOICELESS.,"anything I can remember since Xavier's ""My God, I love thee.""--I am not a"
9189,THE VOICELESS.,"Churchman,--I don't believe in planting oaks in flower-pots,--but such a"
9190,THE VOICELESS.,"poem as ""The Rosebud"" makes one's heart a proselyte to the culture it"
9191,THE VOICELESS.,"grows from.  Talk about it as much as you like,--one's breeding shows"
9192,THE VOICELESS.,itself nowhere more than in his religion.  A man should be a gentleman in
9193,THE VOICELESS.,"his hymns and prayers; the fondness for ""scenes,"" among vulgar saints,"
9194,THE VOICELESS.,contrasts so meanly with that--
9195,THE VOICELESS.,
9196,THE VOICELESS.,"""God only and good angels look"
9197,THE VOICELESS.,"Behind the blissful scene,""--"
9198,THE VOICELESS.,
9199,THE VOICELESS.,"and that other,--"
9200,THE VOICELESS.,
9201,THE VOICELESS.,"""He could not trust his melting soul"
9202,THE VOICELESS.,"But in his Maker's sight,""--"
9203,THE VOICELESS.,
9204,THE VOICELESS.,"that I hope some of them will see this, and read the poem, and profit by"
9205,THE VOICELESS.,it.
9206,THE VOICELESS.,
9207,THE VOICELESS.,My laughing and winking young friend undertook to procure and arrange the
9208,THE VOICELESS.,"flowers for the table, and did it with immense zeal.  I never saw him"
9209,THE VOICELESS.,"look happier than when he came in, his hat saucily on one side, and a"
9210,THE VOICELESS.,"cheroot in his mouth, with a huge bunch of tea-roses, which he said were"
9211,THE VOICELESS.,"for ""Madam."""
9212,THE VOICELESS.,
9213,THE VOICELESS.,"One of the last things that came was an old square box, smelling of"
9214,THE VOICELESS.,"camphor, tied and sealed.  It bore, in faded ink, the marks, ""Calcutta,"
9215,THE VOICELESS.,"1805.""  On opening it, we found a white Cashmere shawl with a very brief"
9216,THE VOICELESS.,"note from the dear old gentleman opposite, saying that he had kept this"
9217,THE VOICELESS.,"some years, thinking he might want it, and many more, not knowing what to"
9218,THE VOICELESS.,"do with it,--that he had never seen it unfolded since he was a young"
9219,THE VOICELESS.,"supercargo,--and now, if she would spread it on her shoulders, it would"
9220,THE VOICELESS.,make him feel young to look at it.
9221,THE VOICELESS.,
9222,THE VOICELESS.,"Poor Bridget, or Biddy, our red-armed maid of all work!  What must she do"
9223,THE VOICELESS.,"but buy a small copper breast-pin and put it under ""Schoolma'am's"" plate"
9224,THE VOICELESS.,"that morning, at breakfast?  And Schoolma'am would wear it,--though I"
9225,THE VOICELESS.,"made her cover it, as well as I could, with a tea-rose."
9226,THE VOICELESS.,
9227,THE VOICELESS.,"It was my last breakfast as a boarder, and I could not leave them in"
9228,THE VOICELESS.,utter silence.
9229,THE VOICELESS.,
9230,THE VOICELESS.,"Good-by,--I said,--my dear friends, one and all of you!  I have been long"
9231,THE VOICELESS.,"with you, and I find it hard parting.  I have to thank you for a thousand"
9232,THE VOICELESS.,"courtesies, and above all for the patience and indulgence with which you"
9233,THE VOICELESS.,have listened to me when I have tried to instruct or amuse you.  My
9234,THE VOICELESS.,"friend the Professor (who, as well as my friend the Poet, is unavoidably"
9235,THE VOICELESS.,absent on this interesting occasion) has given me reason to suppose that
9236,THE VOICELESS.,he would occupy my empty chair about the first of January next.  If he
9237,THE VOICELESS.,"comes among you, be kind to him, as you have been to me.  May the Lord"
9238,THE VOICELESS.,bless you all!--And we shook hands all round the table.
9239,THE VOICELESS.,
9240,THE VOICELESS.,Half an hour afterwards the breakfast things and the cloth were gone.  I
9241,THE VOICELESS.,looked up and down the length of the bare boards over which I had so
9242,THE VOICELESS.,"often uttered my sentiments and experiences--and--Yes, I am a man, like"
9243,THE VOICELESS.,another.
9244,THE VOICELESS.,
9245,THE VOICELESS.,"All sadness vanished, as, in the midst of these old friends of mine, whom"
9246,THE VOICELESS.,"you know, and others a little more up in the world, perhaps, to whom I"
9247,THE VOICELESS.,"have not introduced you, I took the schoolmistress before the altar from"
9248,THE VOICELESS.,"the hands of the old gentleman who used to sit opposite, and who would"
9249,THE VOICELESS.,insist on giving her away.
9250,THE VOICELESS.,
9251,THE VOICELESS.,And now we two are walking the long path in peace together.  The
9252,THE VOICELESS.,"""schoolmistress"" finds her skill in teaching called for again, without"
9253,THE VOICELESS.,going abroad to seek little scholars.  Those visions of mine have all
9254,THE VOICELESS.,come true.
9255,THE VOICELESS.,
9256,THE VOICELESS.,I hope you all love me none the less for anything I have told you.
9257,THE VOICELESS.,Farewell!
9258,THE VOICELESS.,
9259,THE VOICELESS.,
9260,THE VOICELESS.,
9261,THE VOICELESS.,
9262,THE VOICELESS.,
9263,THE VOICELESS.,
