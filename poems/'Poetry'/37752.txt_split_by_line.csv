102,LONDON DAWN,
103,LONDON DAWN,Dawn over London; all the pearly light
104,LONDON DAWN,"Trembles and quivers over street and park,"
105,LONDON DAWN,"The houses are a strange, unearthly white;"
106,LONDON DAWN,"Pavement and roof grow slowly, palely bright;"
107,LONDON DAWN,"There is no shadow, neither light nor dark"
108,LONDON DAWN,But everything is steeped in glimmering dawn.
109,LONDON DAWN,
110,LONDON DAWN,"Oh, purity of dawn; oh, milk-and-pearl"
111,LONDON DAWN,"Translucent splendour, spreading far and wide,"
112,LONDON DAWN,As on a yellow beach the small waves curl
113,LONDON DAWN,--Almost as noiselessly as buds unfurl--
114,LONDON DAWN,"On windless mornings with the rising tide,"
115,LONDON DAWN,"So flows the dawn o'er London, all asleep."
116,LONDON DAWN,
117,LONDON DAWN,"Indeed, I think that heaven is a sea,"
118,LONDON DAWN,And London is a city of old rhymes
119,LONDON DAWN,"Sunk fathoms deep in its transparency,"
120,LONDON DAWN,That folk of living lands may dream they see
121,LONDON DAWN,"And muse on, and have thoughts about our times,"
122,LONDON DAWN,"How we were great and splendid, and now gone."
123,LONDON DAWN,
124,LONDON DAWN,"For never light the common earth has born,"
125,LONDON DAWN,This crystalline pale wonder that so falls
126,LONDON DAWN,"On streets and squares the daily toil has worn,"
127,LONDON DAWN,"On blind-eyed houses, holding lives forlorn,"
128,LONDON DAWN,"For the grey roads and wide, blank, grey-brick walls"
129,LONDON DAWN,Shine with a glory that is new and strange.
130,LONDON DAWN,
131,LONDON DAWN,"And not more wonderful, nor otherwise"
132,LONDON DAWN,"Shall dawn come up upon the dewy hills,"
133,LONDON DAWN,"Nor in the mountains, where the rivers rise"
134,LONDON DAWN,That water Eden; and no lovelier lies
135,LONDON DAWN,"The dawn on Paradise, than this that fills"
136,LONDON DAWN,The space 'twixt house and house with tremulous light.
137,LONDON DAWN,
138,LONDON DAWN,"Yet, on the pavement, huddled fast asleep,"
139,LONDON DAWN,"A thing of dusty, ragged misery,"
140,LONDON DAWN,"Grotesque in wretchedness, from London's deep"
141,LONDON DAWN,"Spumed off, a strange, distorted thing to creep"
142,LONDON DAWN,"From God knows where, and lie, and let all be"
143,LONDON DAWN,"Unheeding, whether of the day or night."
144,LONDON DAWN,
145,LONDON DAWN,"Such tired, hopeless angles of the knees"
146,LONDON DAWN,And neck and elbows--and the dawning grey
147,LONDON DAWN,Trembling to sunrise; in the park the trees
148,LONDON DAWN,"Begin to shiver lightly in a breeze,"
149,LONDON DAWN,And turning watchful kindly eyes away
150,LONDON DAWN,The policeman passes slowly on his beat.

156,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
157,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"A dash of rain on the pavement,"
158,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"In the air a gleam of sun,"
159,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"And the clouds are white, and rolling high"
160,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,From Marble Arch all down the sky
161,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,--And that's the spring begun!
162,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
163,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,The sky is all a-shining
164,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"With sunniest blue and white,"
165,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,The flags are streaming out full cry
166,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"As the crisp North wind comes bustling by,"
167,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,And all the roofs are bright.
168,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
169,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,And all the shops and houses
170,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"Of sunlit Oxford Street,"
171,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"--Pearl behind amber, gold by rose--"
172,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,To grey the long perspective goes;
173,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,Till all the houses meet.
174,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
175,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"And there, in every gutter,"
176,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,The glory of spring flowers
177,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"The whole long street with colour fills,"
178,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,And across the yellow daffodils
179,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,Sharp sunshine and soft showers.
180,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
181,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,And among the drabs and greys and browns
182,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,Of folk going to and fro
183,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"Are trays of violets, darkly bright,"
184,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"And yellow, like the spring moon's light,"
185,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,Pale primrose-bunches show.
186,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,
187,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"There's blue in every puddle,"
188,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,And every pane of glass
189,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"Has a thousand little dancing suns,"
190,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,"--And up and down the glad news runs,"
191,SPRING IN OXFORD STREET,That spring has come to pass.

202,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",It's fine as any king's;
203,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",For there I see on either hand
204,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",The whole great stretch of London lie;
205,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",--Just so as any king might stand

207,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",The flashing pigeon wings.
208,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",

212,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",Who'd acquiesce with gravity
213,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","--But that I do without,"
214,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",For all of lord there is up here
215,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","Is this impassive chimney-stack,"
216,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",And cloudy be my view or clear
217,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",My courtier will not answer back;
218,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","All silent I look out,"
219,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",
220,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",And see the flight of roofs that fade
221,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","Towards the West in golden haze,"
222,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",And all this work men's hands have made
223,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",Like jewels in the sun's last rays--
224,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",I have a dwelling wide;
225,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","Three rooms are mine, but I can go"
226,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","Up to this roof in shade or shine,"
227,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS",And watch all London change and glow
228,"JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS","Rose, purple, gold; three rooms are mine--"

237,SPARROWS,"I like to think, when I hear them chatter,"
238,SPARROWS,"How, when the brazen noise was gone"
239,SPARROWS,"Of the chariot-wheels, with the sparks a-scatter,"
240,SPARROWS,Their chirp was heard in old Babylon.
241,SPARROWS,
242,SPARROWS,"In Babylon, and more ancient Memphis,"
243,SPARROWS,"They chattered and quarrelled, pecked and fumed,"
244,SPARROWS,"And loved their loves, and flew their ways,"
245,SPARROWS,Where the royal Pharaohs lay entombed
246,SPARROWS,Deep from the daylight's vulgar gaze.
247,SPARROWS,
248,SPARROWS,"Then, just such little homely fellows"

253,SPARROWS,
254,SPARROWS,"So did they sit, on the roofs of Rome,"
255,SPARROWS,And preen themselves in the morning sun;
256,SPARROWS,"And Caesar saw them, brown and grey,"
257,SPARROWS,"Whisk in the dust, when his course was run"
258,SPARROWS,And he took to the Forum his fated way.
259,SPARROWS,
260,SPARROWS,"Oh, changing time; oh, sun and birds"
261,SPARROWS,How little changing.  In the Square
262,SPARROWS,This winter morning I have met

273,THE MOON IN JANUARY,Black on a delicate sky;
274,THE MOON IN JANUARY,"Upright they stand, across they lie,"
275,THE MOON IN JANUARY,"In changeless angles fixed and bound,"
276,THE MOON IN JANUARY,"The sunset light in mist is drowned,"

297,THE MOON IN JANUARY,"The lamps go dotting, row on row,"

370,THE GERMAN BAND,"And lived very near the sky,"
371,THE GERMAN BAND,A German band was wonderful music

373,THE GERMAN BAND,
374,THE GERMAN BAND,It was to me of a beauty
375,THE GERMAN BAND,"That I could not understand,"

378,THE GERMAN BAND,

382,THE GERMAN BAND,"In such guise, years ago."

384,THE GERMAN BAND,And now when on Friday mornings
385,THE GERMAN BAND,"I hear my own child run,"
386,THE GERMAN BAND,"When the German band in the street starts playing,"
387,THE GERMAN BAND,The wonder is never done;
388,THE GERMAN BAND,

390,THE GERMAN BAND,"May take for itself to rise,"

414,I,"Prim, starched nurses, and ladies fair"
415,I,"With taffeta dresses and shining hair,"

418,I,(Out-at-elbows and out-at-heel)
419,I,That they've a right to the morning sun;
420,I,And so with gnarled old hands he'll play
421,I,"For an hour, perhaps, then take his way,"
422,I,"Dragging his knobby, lame old feet"
423,I,In the gutter of this quiet street.

429,I,"Hunching his shoulders, age and pain"

456,II,Wagging his head and stamping his feet

883,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
884,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"One of God's blessed pitying saints one day,"
885,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Reaching out hands to touch the azure throne:
886,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"""Because it is my birthday, Lord,"" he said,"
887,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"""That I was born in heaven, when I was known"
888,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"By an earthly name, and stoned and left for dead,"
889,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
890,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"""Because it is the custom, Lord, of men"
891,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"To keep their birthdays gladly, and with gifts"
892,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Grant me a blessing from your blesséd stores."""
893,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And from the cloudy rose and amber drifts
894,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"About the Throne, God answered: ""It is yours."""
895,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
896,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Then sprang the glad Saint earthwards; at his feet
897,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Were little golden flames, and all his hair"
898,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Was blown about his head like tongues of fire,"
899,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And like a star he burned through the dark air,"
900,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And came, and stood by farm and shed and byre"
901,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
902,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Before the earliest grey was in the East,"
903,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Or the first smoke above the chimney-stack
904,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"From earliest-rising housewife, yet the cheep"
905,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And twitter of birds did gladly welcome back
906,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Him who such love for earth in heaven could keep,"
907,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
908,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And who on earth such love had had for men
909,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And bird and beast, and all that lived and grew:"
910,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,The sparrows in the eaves remembered him
911,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And chirrupped in the gables, while the dew"
912,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Was dark still, and the day below the rim."
913,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
914,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"He stood there, in the village of his life"
915,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Ere he won heaven, and the breath of cows"
916,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Came as a benediction, and the smell"
917,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Of rain-sweet copses, and, where cattle browse,"
918,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Long grass, and running water in the dell."
919,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
920,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And his heart opened with the love he had
921,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,For the dear toil-worn dwelling-place of men;
922,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"To hear the sheep crop, see the glimmering grey"
923,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Lighten the waiting windows once again,"
924,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And garden roses opening to the day.
925,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
926,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Not otherwise was Eden once--he thought--
927,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And by God's blessing it may be anew:
928,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And so put forth the power God had lent
929,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And took away all labour, and he drew"
930,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Heaven to earth, till earth and heaven were blent."
931,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
932,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Time ceased to be; and yet the sun and shade
933,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Shifted to make new beauty with the hours,"
934,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"And the ripe earth, unlaboured, gave her yields,"
935,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"No pain there was, no age, and all the flowers"
936,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Unwitheringly lovely filled the fields.
937,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
938,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And all day long the birds in ecstasy
939,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Sang without shadow of hawk or thought of death,"
940,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,And the saint happily went about the ways
941,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Filling each home with plenty--his very breath
942,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,Was like a little thrilling note of praise.
943,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
944,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"When all was done he stepped back, childish-wise,"
945,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"To see and love his handiwork, and then"
946,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Came a sharp pain, and pierced him through and through;"
947,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"He had wrought lovingly for the days of men,"
948,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,But the heart of men his love could not renew:
949,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
950,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"The weary heart, the ever-questioning,"
951,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"The loving, lacking, lonely, incomplete"
952,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,For ever longing to be merged in one
953,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,With something other than itself; to beat
954,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,To another's pulse; to be for ever done
955,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,
956,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,With its sad weight of personality.
957,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Then God leaned down to his poor saint, and said:"
958,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"""Dear soul, would you make heaven upon the earth:"
959,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Nor know indeed My purpose in all birth,"
960,THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY,"Nor that My blessing is upon the dead?"""

1715,FINIS,Rare moments when our senses are a mist
1716,FINIS,"That the truth shines through:--oh, most strange and rare,"
1717,FINIS,Such ecstasies as unimprisoned souls
1718,FINIS,Experience in that thin empyrean
1719,FINIS,Beyond the gross world; this we two have known
1720,FINIS,We two together.  There are memories
1721,FINIS,Of such high happiness in a fence of pain
1722,FINIS,As martyrs in their fiery heart of death
1723,FINIS,"Have blessed their God for; passion and holiness,"
1724,FINIS,"When all the body (sinew, bone, and brain)"
